I don't know what made us pick this recipe but I'm SO GLAD we did. I'm not kidding when I say these were the BEST sloppy joes I've ever tasted, ever. I was a bit concerned that there weren't spices in the recipe, and the soy sauce seemed a bit weird, but it came out incredible. It had tons of flavor, and almost tasted like it had been cooking all day. I even like the canned sloppy joe's and will NEVER buy the cans again. If you are a sloppy joe fan, do yourself a favor and make these ASAP. Thanks for a great easy recipe that I will be making for many years to come.

Great recipe!  Better than Manwich for sure.  I add 2T of yellow mustard and 2t of Worcestershire sauce.  Served on Onion Rolls and topped with Colby Jack cheese is the knockout punch! Thanks for the recipe!

My husband is a big fan of sloppy joes but I've always thought of them as just "meh".

He was begging for them so I went searching for a recipe.  I chose this one because of the sauce (instead of just ketchup).  When I mixed it all up together, I thought it was missing "something" so I squired in some yellow mustard.

I also like to let flavors "marry" so I popped this in my slow cooker, on low, for 4-5 hours.
This is a GREAT recipe!!  Thanks you!!

I am very picky about sloppy joe recipes but I did like this one. I had an accident with the soy sauce and added to much and still knew that I would like it with less soy sauce!  My mom and dad ate it and they decreased the soy sauce to 1 Tbsp.  They gave it 5 stars!  I love that it is a tomato sauce based recipe.  It was not tangy and I love that. Thanks for a great recipe!  11/10 update  My aunt and uncle also tried this recipe on my suggestion and they give it 5 stars also!  I will definitely be making this for my son's upcoming birthday party!  Thanks!

This was a really simple, yet great tasting recipe. My only - yet very tiny - complaint was that it tasted just a tad too sweet for me. However, everyone else loved it. Plus, just for a small kick, I added some cayenne to spice it up just a bit. It definitely filled us up and I'm sure I will use it again in the near future!

Great taste. My hubby said it was better than Manwhich. I added approx. 2 Tbsp. yellow mustard; cut the soy sauce to 2 Tbsp., and added 1 Tbsp. worcestershire sauce. Doubled the recipe so I can freeze some for later.

I ran out of Manwich sauce so I was looking for a quick substitute. I followed the recipe exactly. My teenage son said it was the best sloppy joe he'd ever had. My husband said I should never make it any other way.

Love it! I never buy canned sloppy joe sauce anymore. I make this recipe with ground lean turkey and I also top each sandwich with cheddar cheese and a few french's fried onions. My kids just can't get enough. I only end up using half the recipe then I freeze the other half to use later.

Wow - this is by far the best Sloppy Joes recipe I have found.  It was so flavorful and everybody in my house ate it up quickly.  I used both green and red peppers for a bit of color, and I had no tomato paste on hand.  Instead, I used a bit of extra tomato sauce.

Very good. Possibly the best I've ever had!  It works really well with ground turkey.   I only used one pound of meat and cut the onion and tomato paste by half and came out with the perfect amount of sauce, so I would probably double the tomato sauce, ketchup and brown sugar if I made a full.  I added a big splash of Worcestershire and a half of a chopped bell pepper to the meat as it cooked.  

Toss a buttered hoagie bun under the broiler for a few minutes, add a bit of shredded cheddar and your meat and it's perfect!

I made half a batch and left out the soy sauce simply because I didn't have any. This came out delicious! This reminds me of the home-made Sloppy Joes that I grew up with. I'll never buy canned sloppy joes again!

These were great sloppy joes!  I think they are the best yet that Ive had.  I am usually opening a can of my favorite mix and then sprucing it up with added ingredients.  I chose to pick this recipe since it had the tomato paste/sauce combo other than all ketchup like others.  I really liked the addition of the soy sauce!  It really gave it a unique richness in flavor, and it almost in a way gave these sloppy joes an asian twist.  I went by the recipe except sauteed in some celery as well as only used 1 lb of beef to the sauce mixture.  We like em saucy!  And also simmered them just a touch longer.  All in all this was a great sloppy joe mix that gave me the zip and richness that I like in my joes.  Thanks for this great recipe!  I will definitely be using again.

SO good!! I had intended to just make some for myself, but once my hubby tasted it, he helped me eat it! :-) I liked that it wasn't overly sweet and that it had so much flavor!! This will become a weekly meal for me!

This was amazing.  It was a bit sweet for sloppy joe mix.  Next time we make this, we will cut the brown sugar in half, add 1 Tbs dry mustard and maybe add in some green chilli peppers

I thought these were a bit "sweet" with the called for amount of Brown sugar. I put in about 2 Tbsp of prepared mustard, which cut down the sweetness and they were just right. Since I cut the recipe down for just my husband and I, i used only the tomato sauce, no tomato paste sicne I did not want to waste half a can of each. This made it a bit 'juicier' but it was still great!

Very good homemade recipe.  Tasty and not too sweet or tangy.  Like other reviewers, I also added one tablespoon of yellow mustard and one tablespoon of Lea & Perrin's Worcestershire sauce.   It's nice not having to use a prepackage/preprocessed can or mix.

This was a great recipe.  Only change I made was adding 1/2 green pepper chopped with onion and garlic.  The soy sauce really worked in this recipe.  Thanks.

I read this review and it said it would taste better then the sloppy joe mix...well i agree, and so do my parents...follow this exactly with a little added mustard and delish! I read someone put worchester sauce as well..i didn't have any at the time but 2 tablespoons of mustard add a great flavor :)

Loved these! My husband, who rarely comments on what we eat, said these were the best ever! YUM! :) Also, I put the kids on hot dog buns and they were easier to eat! Will definitely make again--no changes needed to this recipe!! :)

So easy that we made it for our Christmas family get-together.  After it was cooked, we put it in a crock-pot. We'll be doing this for Super Bowl Sunday!

These are really yummy, just be aware they are on the sweeter side of sloppy joes.  Not the recipe for you if you like spice.

When I realized that I was out of canned sloppy joe after my meat was browned, I almost panicked.  I came across this recipe and decided, "what the heck".  So, here I am to tell you it was AWESOME!!  I will definitely keep this for use again and again.

I have never made a sloppy joe before so I really can't compare to anything, but this was pretty good. The only complaint I have is that it was too sweet. All the other flavors were terrific so next time I make this I will cut the sugar in half.

I thought this was pretty good, one of the better Sloppy Joe recipes I've come across.  I felt like there was too much garlic and soy sauce.  I'll cut the soy sauce in half, maybe add Worch.  Stick with one clove of garlic and half an onion.  
I always just add the mustard and cheese on the buns, usually add a pickle slice too.  I'll be making this again though.

I will make this again for sure!  Simple and oh so easy but tastes more complex.  Hubby Loved it and I wil; not change a thing.  Much better than the popular canned mix.  If you enjoy chopping and feel you must add green peppers or celery, go ahead but does not need it.

Awesome! I used tomato sauce instead of paste and just reduced the amount of water. Really good.

Loved it!  And it was so easy.  I took the advice of previous reviewers and made the following changes.  1) Added one green bellpepper.  2) Added 2 T Mustard 3) Added two T Worchester Sauce 4) Decreased low sodium Soy Sauce to 2 T 5) I used half ground beef and half ground chicken because that's what I had on hand. 6) Onced I browned the meat/onion/green bellpepper/garlic, I placed the mixture in a slow cooker.  I mixed all the other ingredients, then added it to the slow cooker for 4.5 hours on low.  Husband loved it and said it was a keeper, although 3 year old daughter wasn't interested (that's the only reason I gave it four vs. five stars).  But I will make this again.

This is the best Sloppy Joe I have ever tasted. Even my picky 3 year old ate it. I did add a splash of white wine and Colby cheese. Thank you very much for posting this recipe.

Very good.  I made a few alterations, and cooked it on low in the slow cooker for 4 hours and it was so mouth watering and the meat was so tender.  Thank you for the recipe.

Thanks Ona for a super great recipe. I tried this for the first time last night, and boy was I surprised of the great taste and all the flavors it has. I made it exactly how it was written, and it was perfect. My wife is very picky when it comes to "Joes", and she loved it. You are my hero, I never cared for the canned stuff. This is a definate keeper, thanks again.

These sloppy joes were so tasty! A great idea when you need dinner done quickly. I followed the recipe exactly, except I scaled it down to 6 servings since I was only using 1 lb of ground beef. So much tastier and less salty than those packaged seasoning mixes. Had it with french fries and it was delish :)

I made the following modifications: used 1 1/4 of meat (that's all I had), added diced onion and green peppers, decreased the soy sauce to 1 tbsp then added 2 tbsp of yellow mustard and 2 of Worcestershire sauce. Both my roommate and I loved it! It tasted like the sloppy joes I had when I was a kid.

This was so disappointing for us! With all the rave reviews we got quite excited about it.  Next time we will reduce the sugar by half...if still too sweet, then we will reduce more; and we will leave out the katchup completely!  This recipe makes for a VERY high sugar content sloppy joe (sugar, tomatoe sauce in a can...we used my homemade with very little sugar...and katchup).  Kid loved it...'tastes like katchup'! Guess what her favorite 'food' is?

This recipe was so easy and my kids loved it. I don't eat meat so I can only go off of the review of the family, but my son LOVES mamwich and didn't even know this wasn't it. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added the yellow mustard. I didn't have brown sugar so I went with one tb white sugar and 1 1/2 tb molasses, no one seemed to mind the change. I also used ground turkey because our family doesn't eat beef and added 2 tb bar-b-que sauce because the kids like the bbq mamwich. It was a big hit on a night I couldn't think of anything to make for dinner.

Didn't like it at all with soy sauce.  Had to use worcestershire sauce the next time and they were perfect.

my sloppy joes also have 2 stalks celery, half a pepper, diced, no tomato paste, 1 lb ground beef, about 2 tsp mustard, about 3 tbs brown sugar, no soya sauce but a tbsp Worcestershire sauce...along with the onion, ketchup, garlic and tomato sauce. As I make it is great!

I liked these very much, and I am not a sloppy joe fan.  I didn't use tomato paste, and subbed worcestershire for the soy.  I had 1 lb ground beef, so I used 3/4 onion, 2 garlic cloves, 1 can tomato sauce, 1/4 c ketchup, 1 heaping T brown sugar, 1.5 T worcestershire, and salt and pepper to taste.  Served with toasted buns from the oven - will make again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe

This is the greatest sloppy joe recipe ever!!   Only thing I did different was to saute some yellow bell peppers I had in the fridge.  Made a big batch for my roommate to take to the bar where he cooks.  Three days later, I had to make another batch.  They're selling like crazy.   Yikes!   Didn't plan to make a living out of this!   :-)    Thanks for the recipe, Ona.

I didn't have tomato sauce so I substituted a 1/2 cup bbq sauce for that, the brown sugar, and the ketchup.  Used salt and garlic salt to taste.  A.Maze.Ing!!

Grandpa and me had the 2 yr old grandaughter today. This kid will not eat anything but green peas, chicken nuggets, and apple juice. She is  even more picky than our oldest daughter (her mother) and thats really saying something. I have tried giving her Manwich, which is our go to sloppy joe and she will not eat it. She has just devoured 2 halves of bread filled with this AWESOME sloppy joe recipe. I did not change a thing, went exactly by the ingredients and directions. Gramps and I both thought this was the Bomb and much better than the canned stuff. Goodbye cans, hello Simple Sloppy Joes...Thank you Ona Allen for adding another food to our 2 yr olds diet. I plan on making this with turkey next time and bet it will be just as good.

i really enjoyed this recipe, i did add green and red peppers, and black beans. I typically do not put it in bread but just put it in a bowl and enjoy with some fresh fruit and a glass of sweet red.

good. added mustard per other reviewers, also used powdered garlic and onion powder (in add'n to the onion called for) skipped the tomato paste-- used more tomato sauce (didn't want to waste what I had left). also sauteed the onion with a small bit of celery. was really good. my hubby who is tough critic, liked it, as did my will-eat-no-meat-right-now 18mo. old!

This was a very good recipe.  The only thing I can say about it is that it was just very slightly too sweet for me.  I think next time I will try reducing the brown sugar to 1/4 c and maybe try a little mustard or even a touch of vinegar.  My grandsons loved it just as it is though.

I had majority of the ingredients on hand and was so happy to make this. It turned out delicious! So fast and easy. My substitutions were worcestershire sauce, instead of soy and ground turkey, instead of beef. I also added a small squirt of yellow mustard. I was also out of onion, so I used a dash of onion powder. I will definitely be making this again.

I hid some veggies in mine to add some more nutrition...minced carrots and chopped spinach. I'm sure there are other veggie options, but this is what I had in my refrigerator. I also thought it was a little too sweet, so I added some vinegar for contrast. I think I might add some cayenne next time as well as mustard powder and worcestershire sauce, as others have suggested.

Ran out of my McCormick Sloppy Joe's packets and was in a pinch to make them.  Looked this one up and made a double batch. AWESOME!!!  Gave half the batch to a new mom in the neighborhood and got rave reviews from her and her husband.  Sent the recipe to her.  I did add the Worchestershire and mustard. Making them for the 3rd time tonight!!

This recipe is great! I halved the recipe, but I'll make the full batch next time. I used a little less sugar and soy sauce than the recipe called for — 2T brown sugar and 1T soy sauce for the half batch.

Very good basic sloppy joe recipe. I need to note that I used 3 T dark soy sauce (that's all I had) and next time I will either cut it back or use regular soy sauce. This didn't completely wow me or my husband. (Thus the 4 stars.)

I made this exactly has written and thought it was good. However, next time I would cut back on the amount of brown sugar. I did think it was too sweet. Sloppy Joes should not be sweet.

I harken back to the days I spent as a young child in elementary school.  I remember what the homemade sloppy joes tasted like.  I have found a recipe that almost matches that exactly.  Thank you very much for sharing this one!  My 4 year old daughter actually said she liked it.  She doesn't eat much meat.  My 2 year old, my wife and I absolutely love it!!!!!!

My family of 6 LOVES these sloppy joes!  Our youngest, who is a very picky eater, will eat at least 2 of these sandwiches!  They're his favorite.  I don't change a thing...yummy!!  Thank you for this great recipe.

I grew up on sloppy joes and didn't see how the recipe could compare without the vinegar and mustard.  I made it with the excption that I used chili sauce instead of ketchup.  But then I added a tablespoon of mustard to give it that long remembered flavor.  This is a real keeper!!!

These are really good!  My family will not eat sloppy joes when I use canned sauce.  This is quick & easy and tasty with the right amount of tang and sweet.  I did swap out part of the soy sauce for worcestershire sauce as other reviewers have done.  I also added finely diced onion and celery (got to get those veggies in where I can!)-I browned the hamburger with the veggies and then threw everything into the crockpot since I wanted to have the main dish ready and waiting for my guests.  I made these for a family get together and everyone from the grandparents to the 2 year old liked them!  This will be my standard sloppy joe recipe from now on :)

This was great.  I won't buy canned sloppy joe sauce again.  I followed others comments and added mustard and worcesterchire sauce.  I might cut back on the sugar just a tad next time but my roommate loved it just the way it is.  Thank you for sharing!

This was a really good recipe for my kids.  Dh and I have a favorite that includes baked beans, but its not appreciated by the kids.  I took this to a potluck and got many positive comments.  I used a chopper to make the onions very small and unnoticable to the kids.

Meh... this was okay but I wouldn't eat it again. I didn't care much for the soy flavor, it didn't blend in well and gave it an odd taste for a Sloppy Joe. Fast and easy but not my style. Thanks anyway.

I made this recipe for the first time in a huge batch for my daughter's high school graduation party.  It was simple and everyone raved over them.  I added some chili powder and worchestershire sauce to taste.  I will make this recipe over and over again.

Tasty! But in my opinion, don't add the mustard, as one reviewer suggested. A splash of worcester is good but it doesn't take much.

Soooo good!  I usually use the pouch of seasoning from the store and I never will again!  This recipe was perfect and even with the veggies in it, my 3-year-old ate one and a half sloppy joes!  (he doesn't like vegetables and loved these).  A definite keeper... yummy!

Easy, Fast, and REALLY Good!!  I'm not normally a Sloppy Joe fan and HATE any of the canned ones. We thought we'd give this one a try though and I'm glad we did!! Definitely a keeper and a quick go to!

This is a wonderful recipe! I got into making this and realized I did not have any tomato paste so I added about 1/2 of a can of Hunt's Fire Roased Diced Tomatoes with Garlic. It was great!! My husband loved it too.  I have always used a packaged Sloppy Joe Mix - - but never again! Thanks for sharing!!

I refused for years to eat sloppy joes because the idea of meat in can bothers me.  I finally decided to look for recipes. I decided on this one because of the good reviews and it seemed easy.  I loved it and now this is a regular in my house.  I like other have said added mustard and worcestershire.

I made it. I veganized it.  We all loved it!  The only substitution I made was the meat.  I used half Gardein crumbles and half minced baby portobello mushrooms.  This was chewy, tasty and delicious and most cannot tell it isn’t meat and only know because they realize I don’t cook with meat.  It is a big hit whenever I make it.  I serve it with a horseradish cold slaw on top for texture along with pickles.  Big burly men who would never dream of eating vegan chow down on these like no tomorrow and after being told they are vegan concede the food is pretty darn good.  Thanks for this recipe.

I will never make sloppy joes any other way! Great for cold or hot months and parties. I typically follow the recipe exactly, with the except of holding back on the brown sugar a tad. My whole family loves these "joes" and requests them often. Thanks for sharing!!

Very tasty. I followed the recipe with the exception of the soy sauce (used 2 tbsp instead). Looking forward to doing this again and tweaking. I have a can of tomato sauce (basil, garlic, oregano). Bon apetit!

Delicious, but a lot sweeter than a regular can of manwich--which is great for me because I love sweet!! I didn't have tomato sauce and paste, but I did have a can of tomato soup, then added a little extra ketchup. I may never go back to the can again! :)

Perfect recipe!!!!  I had ground venison that needed to be used and a 30 person picnic to host. The game taste of the venison was completely non-existent because of the tomato and sugar combo and probably the soy sauce secret weapon.  Everyone loved them and I ran out in less than an hour.  Thanks so much!

This was great!!!  First time I made sloppy joes from scratch and not using the canned sauce.  This recipe is so much better.  I will have to make this from now on.  My kids ate it without any problems.

Really great. I used Worcester rather than soy and ground turkey rather than beef but otherwise as written-outstanding. If you haven't tried ground turkey as an alternative to beef, you'd be shocked (and I'm REALLY a big food lover so if I can do it, EVERYONE can!!)

My family of five all gave this recipe a thumbs down.  I thought it was a little too sweet, my husband couldn't quite figure out what was wrong with it...and my kids just didn't like it.  Sorry this review isn't more helpful - but the recipe just seems to be missing something.

Way too much soy sauce. Overpowers the other flavors. Might be very good with a lot less soy sauce. May try again.

Wow!!! I've never been a big fan of sloppy joes, but my hubby asked me to make them so I found this recipe and I LOVE it!!  The hint of sweetness really does it for me.  Slight alterations - I used ground turkey thigh meat instead of beef. And I sauteed the onions and garlic in coconut oil before throwing the meat in. Served on onion buns. Delicious!!!

I have never made sloppy joes before...I have only had the canned kind.  This recipe was incredibly easy to make! Like some of the other reviewers, I found that adding 2 T of Worcestershire and 2 T of yellow mustard gave it that extra zip! Fantastic recipe!!!!

Super yummy recipe that was a big hit. My only modifications are: 1. Cut the sugar by 1/3 2. Add the onions and garlic after you drain the fat. If you cook the onions and garlic with the meat then drain the fat, you're going to drain some of the yummy flavor right into the trash. 3. Simmer the stew for an hour to 1 1/2 hours stirring occasionally. The ground meat will be so nice and tender, it will also soften the onions, and the flavors will have time to blend smoothly. Well worth the time! Tripled the recipe and used turkey meat and it still came out delicious! Thank you for a great recipe!

I made this yesterday. I added cayenne & red pepper flakes to give it a bit of a kick. I find that the ketchup taste is overwhelming. Other than that it tastes okay. I probably won't make this again.

Absolutely delicious! I added a touch more soy sauce & brown sugar, didn't have tomato paste so used a small can of tomato soup. It is so scrumptious and will definitely be a make again meal! Thanks for the recipe :-)

My husband absolutely LOVES this recipe. I too ran out of Manwich sauce one night and had to whip up a quick sub. This worked perfectly. I have since started adding bread crumbs to the mixture when preparing this.  This may be a cardinal sin to some but it has allowed me to continue to make my hubby's favorite meal on an ever tightening budget. The bread crumbs act as filler and have allowed me to stretch the meat 2-3x as much. Definite life saver on the checkbook and the sauce is so much cheaper than the prepared cans.

I have tried other sloppy joes recipes and this is by far the best. The only minor alteration I made to the recipe was that I used ground turkey instead of ground beef. I also only used 1.3lbs instead of 2lbs. Regardless, this came out absolutely delicious and I will definitely make it again!

We made a vegetarian version.  We used 1 lb equivalent of soy burger.  We cooked the garlic and onion until soft, then added the soy burger, cooking and breaking it up, added the rest of the ingredients.  The soyburger soaks up more than regular burger, so at the end of cooking we added another couple of spoonsful of ketchup and a couple of tablespoons of barbecue sauce to taste.  Easy, quick, and a great Friday night meal.  Thanks!

I hated sloppy joes, but this one is good.  Now my boys (husband and 12 yr old) tell me I make the best sloppy joes ever.  We top with shredded cheese, and scrap the onion.

This recipe is easily put together, and was attractive to this family because of the lack of green peppers that most sloppy joe recipes call for.  The sauce is a little sweet, a little tangy, and has a little different taste than most sloppy joe recipes that we have tried.  All in all, we enjoyed this one and it was indeed simple.

Thanks for this great and easy recipie.  My guys love to do LARGE pork roasts, spiced and slow cooked on the grill.  After several meals, I had about 2 lbs of left overs.  I used the base proportions of the tomatoe sauce and paste, ketchup, brown sugar and soy sauce for a great sauce that enhanced the spicey (now pulled) pork.  I added just a little vinegar as it was a bit sweet for that particular pork roast.  The guys raved about it.  Definitely will make again!

Im normally a health nut and sloppy joes don't really fit into my normal rotation but I thought I would try it. This recipe was very good. Since there is only 2 adults and 1 toddler, we didn't need 12 servings. I scaled it down but it made the measurements crazy like 3/8 of a 8 oz can of tomato sauce. So I had to improvise and just add some of this and some of that. I didnt add tomato paste and used just tomato sauce instead. I added a squirt or two of yellow mustard as others recommended. It really helped. My husband doesn't like onions so I use onion powder and garlic powder since I didn't have garlic cloves. All in all, I am happy with the way dinner turned out. I served the meat mixture on whole wheat buns to make myself feel like I am trying to be healthy :)

This is a good recipe with a nice, thick sauce that is sweet and has a little tang to it.  Very tasty.

Very good.  Very easy to prepare.  I used only 1 T soy sauce & added 1 T mustard & 1 T Wort. sauce.  Way better than the canned stuff!  Even my picky 4-year old ate all of it.  My husband's only complaint was..."next time, double the recipe so I can have more leftovers."

I just made this and absolutely love it. The flavor is excellent and the consistency is perfect! Will always make this for sloppy joes from now on. I did add some mustard and worchestshire sauce to taste.

This is my first time ever trying to make Sloppy Joes. The taste is very good. I also added 1 tablespoon of mustard to, and only use 2 tbspoon soya sauce. I did not put any sugar in it, and it was already very good to my taste.

I made this recipe for my son's birthday party.  I had never made sloppy joe's from scratch before.  Since the canned stuff isn't available in NZ, I searched for a recipe. They were a hit and tasted perfect!

I really liked this recipe but I too added 2T yellow mustard and Worcestershire sauce instead of Soy. It helps break up the tomato pasty taste. I also had a red pepper on hand that needed to be eaten so I chopped it up with the onion. Tastes good now but I made it ahead for dinner tomorrow! Hope it will taste even better then!

I will never buy canned sloppy joe sauce again! I have friends who swear that ketchup, mustard and brown sugar is sloppy joe sauce and laugh at me because I buy canned stuff because it's more flavorful. This was so easy and so good. I made it just as the recipe stated and it was the perfect amount of flavor and wetness.

I wanted a recipe that would make sloppy joes like I used to eat as a kid - you know, the canned variety - and would appeal to my kids today.  This recipe is that and more.  It has the yummy taste I remember as a kid but fresher and better.  And so easy to make.  This recipe is a keepter.

Our family loves this recipe!  I have never been a fan of sloppy joes, but I love this.  My very picky 10 year old eats them up and begs for more.  I make it exactly like the recipe reads and wouldn't change a thing.  I make the 12 servings for my family of 4 and the leftovers disappear.  Easy to double or triple for large groups.

Very good, very easy!  Even my picky 5 year old and 3 year old daughters and my super picky husband liked it.  I made the recipe exactly as shown and it was great.  Next time I'll probably add some diced red or green peppers or possibly some shredded carrot and just a bit less of the brown sugar.  Excellent quick dinner recipe!

I love this recipe.  I did leave out the onion and used onion powder instead, since I hate the texture of onions. Let me just say, this recipe is easy and delicious, my two favorite things when cooking dinner after a long day at work. This is so much better than any canned sauce (yuck!) that it will make you actually like sloppy joes again!

I made this last night.  As other reviewers recommended, I replaced a tablespoone of soy sauce with one of Worchestershire, and I added 2 tablespoons of mustard.  FANTASTIC!  I put some in the freezer and the leftovers in the fridge, and it was just as good, maybe even better reheated for lunch.  Thank you!

How do you give Sloppy Joes 5 stars? I guess the flavor just suits me. I usually make everything as the recipe says and this one has a slightly sweet flavor that makes it taste so good to me and kids like it better too because it cuts down on the acidity of the tomato sauce. It is a keeper for sure!

My girls loved this! I made it with hand cut fries and veggies on the side and it was a hit! They also like it with american cheese on their bun. I lightly seasoned my meat, added bell pepper(have to sneak the veggies in where I can), 1 tsp mustard and only 1/4 cup brown sugar and it was perfect.

Made this once, a few months back and everyone liked it. Forgot about it until talking with my daughter about school lunch ideas. She remembered it and wants the meat in a thermos and a dinner roll for lunches from home. She's 6! It is really yummy and obviously the kids loved it. Had to come back to look it up so I can make and freeze some lunch size warm ups to send her off with. Thanks!!!

This recipe was awesome. I was a little wary because of the soy sauce but.. it was perfect!!! I didn't have the brown sugar, so I used equal amount of sugar with 1/2 tblsp. of molasses. I also added a squirt of mustard, a little bit of tobasco and red pepper.. my husband told me I'm not allowed to make any other sloppy joes :)

I think this is the first recipe on this site i've really been dissapointed in. This did not have a good flavor, very VERY dry! I think no name sloppy joe canned mix would taste better then this, will not try again. I don't think most the people that commented on here have not had a real sloppy joe before, if this is the best tasting recipe you've had. I got really excited of all the positive reviews, to be left stunned when my taste buds were so let down! EDIT: i bumped this up to a 3 from a one cuz my dad and sister just finished eating it outside and loved it, maybe I just dont' have the taste for this, but if they like it it can't be that bad.

I hated sloppy joes growing up, but these were really good!  I did have to do a little bit of tweaking though, so I am only giving it 4 stars.  I halved the recipe, so maybe that was the problem, but it seemed like they were a bit dry, so I added mustard and a little bit more of all the ingredients, besides meat and onions.  I don't normally like my meat sweet, so I didn't use as much sugar at first, but I think by the time I was done messing with it, I was at the listed amount, if not a little more and it was perfect - not too sweet.  We ate them on kaiser rolls with a slice of colby-jack cheese.  For anyone who just isn't sure about sloppy joes, I would try this recipe and then just mess around with the ingredients until you get it right for your tastes!  :)

This was a wonderful recipe for sloppy Joes. I always go half and half on the meat. Half ground beef and half ground turkey. It helps take some of the fat and calories away. Other than that I followed the recipe. I will be adding this to my collection of recipes and using over and over.

This was a traditional sloppy joe.  I added bit of garlic powder and a teaspoon of mustard.  In addition, I used ground turkey and the result was delicious - I didn't taste a noticeable difference between ground beef and ground turkey, but the change resulted in a slightly healthier meal.  I served with friend potatoes and cole slaw.

Mine's still cooking, but it smells -- funky.  We'll see....  NOPE.  May have improved slightly as it cooked, but it's just not good. I went with only 2T soy and added a bit of prepared mustard.  Didn't help. 2 stars for being easy, but - wouldn't try again. Sorry.

Wow! I would give these more stars but I can't. It has been a long time since I have done Sloppy Joes and I would use the canned sauce. I am not going back. These are soooo good! I love it. I followed the recipe for 12 servings and barely had enough to bring for lunch. They are fantastic!!! I will do these again and again and will not use Manwich, as another user stated, again.

I'm giving this 5 stars because this taste just like Manwich!!! I wanted to make something quick and I didn't have much in the fridge or the freezer, but luckily I had everything on your ingredient list (I did add mustard like some the other reviewers suggested) and I threw them together in no time and it was sooo good... My 7 year old said "It was her favorite" and my boyfriend gobbled up 3 by himself!!! Great, Great, Great recipie!!!

I just made this recipe for a summer children's camp and the sloppy joes were a hit!  One counselor said it was the best recipe all summer.  I did follow the suggestions of many of the reviewers and added 2 TB yellow mustard and 2 tsp w. sauce.  I cooked for 60 and scrapped the roaster to make the last few.  Great recipe!

I have a very picky bunch with five kids all having different tastes and my husband to boot, but everybody agreed on this one. This was great. I will make this again. Also i tried adding a few teaspoons of mustard to the mix and it was good that way.

I combined this recipe with the Cabbage Sloppy Joes and it turned out delicious!  Kids and husband gobbled it up with 2nd helpings!

Made this and my family liked it-said it wasn't bad.  But I thought it wasn't all that great.  Really wish my mom could remember how she made hers!  I can't say I'll be making this again.

This is a great recipe, my kids loved it.  The only change I made is to use a bit more tomato sauce (15 oz) and only 2 tablespoons of soy sauce.

I do not like store package sloppy joe mix so I gave this a try.  It is a hit in my house.  I doubled the recipe and let it simmer for 30 mins.  Keep it on warm so my family could come and go during the afternoon and eat when they were hungry.  The longer this sat on the stove the more flavor it had.

My wife and I tried this recipe and were a bit disappointed.  The 3 tbs. of Soy Sauce was a bit much.  If you are not a big fan of Soy sauce, I recommend backing off of the suggested 3 tablespoons.  We attempted to counteract the soy flavor with 2 tsp. of garlic powder, 2 tsp onion powder, and 2 tsp. worcestershire sauce.  We also added shredded cheddar cheese to each individual sandwich.  It still wasn't the greatest, but it saved us from throwing it all away.  If you love Soy Sauce, this may be up your alley though.

I ended up only having one pound of hamburger, but we tried it anyway.  Turned out really good. I can't wait to try it the way it is supposed to be made. HAHA

This is the best sloppy joe dish I have ever had! Everyone raved. It's very easy to make. I made it with the spicy sweet potato  fries recipe found on here. It was so good I will never make Manwich again.

Good sandwich! I think next time I will add some onion powder, and maybe have sliced onion to go with the pickles we served on the side. Good job!

Because I'm currently living in Iran, I don't have access to many ingredients commonly found in recipes for the U.S. This recipe was great because it was super simple with ingredients I was able to find easily. However, I jazzed up this basic sauce recipe by adding chopped onion and red bell pepper, garlic powder, and a shake each of red and black pepper. I also topped the meat mix with sliced cheese for serving - it cuts the sweetness. I've also made them using less white sugar.

Thank you!  Thank you!  My son is so picky lately, it's hard to find something he'll eat other than oatmeal.  He gobbled this up and begged me to make it again today!  The soy sauce is a nice change from the other recipes I've tried.  I'll definitely make these again!
