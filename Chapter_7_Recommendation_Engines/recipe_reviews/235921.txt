Just made 'em. Nothing wrong with this recipe, but it's not for beginners. It helps to have someone show you if you're not used to working with this kind of dough. It's the standard old-country pastry dough for kiffles and rugelach, ratio 1 C butter: 1 C cream cheese: 2 C flour... no added sugar to please  American tastes. A few more thoughts. The cookie sheet is ungreased since there's so much butter in the dough. The dough has to be chilled and stay that way, otherwise it will spread everywhere. The filling (any kind you like, from apricot to nut to chocolate to poppyseed), also should stay to a minimum so it doesn't explode on your pan, and you might want to use a little H2O to pinch the "arms" together so they don't open during cooking.

I would make this again.  They were light, buttery, and airy.  I could really taste the walnut flavor.  I got several compliments on them.  It was a bit tricky rolling them.  I rolled the dough as thin as I could and used slightly less filling so they wouldn't break open.  Sprinkled with powdered sugar.

These are great!  I used a jelly glass to cut them after rolling. Instead of the walnut filling (which I will try next time), I used Solo canned cake and pastry filling (strawberry) and rolled them in confectioners sugar after they cooled a couple of minutes.  I only chilled the dough about two hours and it was fine. Really good.  Thank you!

This dough was the easiest kifli dough I ever worked with, and I made kifli over half a dozen times.. The dough was never ever too sticky. These made very nice, puffy cookies!

1. Roll them in powered sugar instead of flour. 2. Only use a little bit of filling, like less than a teaspoon, and you can buy filling in the baking aisle...apricot is a good filling if you’re not into walnuts. 3. Make sure your kiffles are totally closed, almost like a ravioli. I actually fold mine into a triangle, pinch edges, then roll. For some reason, totally closed kiffles taste better and prevent the filling from getting dried out as it does when it oozes out of the cookie while baking. Honestly, an ugly kiffle can taste much better than a beautifully rolled pastry kiffle. I keep my square small before I fold them over

This is actually a pretty good recipe. It doesn’t turn out exactly like the kiflis I’ve had but it’s really close to it! I used half of all the measurements as I didn’t want to make too much and ended up with about  40. Instead of only using white sugar, I used half white and half brown then added a bit of cinnamon to the filling mixture. This is good stuff
