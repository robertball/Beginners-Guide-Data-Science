Fan-freaking-tastic!   Wow, this was soo good, and my kids loved it as well.  

I did use regular white vinegar instead of the called for ACV since I didn't have any on hand.  Will try that next time.  

I also assumed the amount of sugar called for would be way too much for my tastes, and it was.  I cut it in half and I still feel it was a little too sweet.  

Also, not sure if my cabbage was particularly large or what, but I had WAY more cabbage left over than I expected (especially since the batch I made was enough for 8 people easy, if not 10).

I also love that this seems to be a very forgiving recipe - adjusting to taste for particularly the sugar, but also vinegar and oil amounts.

Comments I received:  'the bleu cheese makes it'.  'perfect!' 'so good!'

Excellent recipe, with some minor modifications - thanks OP!      Can't wait to try this again with the suggested ACV.

It's really good, but I may add more vinegar and sugar next time.  I'll see how it melds together., though.

Used 1 tsp. onion powder and mixed in oil and vinegar for the liquid.  Mom and sister couldn't stop eating it.
