With no flavor development for this, made for a bland dish, as expected. Not bad. Bland. I added some shredded cheese, a dab of Crystals and a sprinkling of red pepper. 
I added 1/2 cup of water, as directed and it took about 30 minutes for it to all simmer off.

We like all of these ingredients separately, but I wasn't sure how it was gonna go with them combined...we liked it!  I only ended up adding a few Tbsps. of water instead of the full 1/2 cup, and that worked great. We really liked the flavors and different textures. This was nice for  a different side. Thanks for sharing. :)
