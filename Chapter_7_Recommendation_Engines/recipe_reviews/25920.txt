These are fabulous. I can't believe this recipe doesn't have more reviews!  The real secret to making this great is that you need to food process the filling until it's smooth. My friends and especially my finance and his family LOVE this recipe. Definitely worth trying. It does take a little time, but it's SO worth it!

This is fabulous!  My husband and I are trying a low-cholesterol, low-far diet, and this satisfies both requirements beautifully.  The taste is almost 'meaty', and one 107-calorie serving is a meal in itself.

This dish is definately a new favorite! Really simple, and SO tasty! I used a melon baller to remove the flesh from the zucchini with ease and had the excess stuffing in pita bread for lunch the next day!

My husband and I loved this dish. I used a little less coriander and added about 2 TBSP curry and an extra garlic clove.
It didn't have an Indian flavor at all. I sprinkled it with shredded Parmesan cheese before serving. The salt of the cheese was perfect. It cooked for a good 40 minutes.

I make almost the same recipe, only I add minced onions, sausage, mushrooms, Italian bread crumbs, salt and pepper. I heap the mixture onto the zucchini. Sometimes I used yellow zucchini. It's a whole meal.

This recipe turned out really well. My favourite part was the presentation. I love chickpeas, but i think it could stand to have a little less. I also think that the coriander was a little much for me, i don't really care for the taste of it, so i would either eliminate it or add a lot less. Unlike the other reviews, i liked the cumin and actually added half a teaspoon extra. Would totally make this again!!!!

I made these to go with our Easter ham.  They were very easy to make and my guests raved about them!  These can be prepared a day ahead of time and then baked when needed.

It had very interesting taste. I served it with cous-cous. I used less than half of zucchini flesh. Next time I will use more mushrooms, zucchini flesh and lemon juice and less chick peas. Thank you, Jackie, for an interesting recipe!

Easy and delicious.  After trying it once with a whole can of chick peas, I  now also use only half a can.

This was flavorful and delicious. I used home-grown crimini mushrooms; otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I thought the cumin was just right. Next time, I'll probably chop the zucchini shells and mix them in with the stuffing before baking, because it was a little difficult to eat and keep everything together.

We really liked this recipe but found it to be a lot of work.  The second time we made this we just chopped the zucchini into 3/8 inch slices and, after sauteeing the mushrooms/onions, we added everything else into the saucepan, covered on low until zucchini were done, and served it with rice.  We can't wait to make it again, it was so fast and the perfect combination of flavors (and cheap too!).  As a note, we've never had parsley on hand, so both times we've used intead a small handful of "mixed herbs" (basil, oregano, sage, etc...).

pretty good. The 3 ppl who joined me for dinner liked it. One did not like mushrooms, but liked this. Disregard ppls opinions on cumin. I made this as the recipe states. Obviously, any adjustment in spices is to a personal taste. I liked it as is.

Flavours were all wrong, the flesh of the zucchini didn't cook because the dish wasn't covered, and the filling on top got a bit too crispy. Would not make again.

I liked it. Made it twice already, but the second time I didn't have mushrooms so I used onions and carrots. Hardly used any zucchini as part of the stuffing though. I dislike how it all seems to fall apart in the end, but maybe it is just me. The zucchini's I've used were fairly small though. It looks very pretty though!

I enjoyed this especially because it is healthy, but it was also tasty and flavorful. My husband doesn't like zucchini, but he ate a portion anyway. I baked this covered with foil for 20 minutes then removed the foil, sprinkled some parmesan on top, and baked it another 15.

As recommended by previous reviewers, I used less cumin in this recipe (1/2 teaspoon).  With this change, the zucchini wasn't overwhelmed and the mix of flavors was really tasty.  Thank you for this recipe; i'll use it again!

Dished turned out almost perfect.  I added just a touch of fresh grated parmesan cheese inside the zucchini.

really tasty, but the filling doesn't hold very well.  I tried to use feta as a "binder" and it helped.  Its a really cute idea and healthy too!

This is pretty good.  Don't forget the lemon juice... I did and I thought something was missing but I couldn't put my finger on it until a re-read the ingredients list. Also, instead of making zucchini boats like the recipe instructs, I just sliced the zucchini using my food processor.   I then mixed the cooked mushroom/chickpea mixture in with raw zucchini in a baking pan and baked the "stuffing" as directed.

This was very tasty and healthy!  The only thing I would change is to use a hand blender on half of the chick peas to help the stuffing mixture stick together and stay in the succhini halves.  I really enjoyed this dish!  Thanks!

Creative dish. Used only 1/4 tsp. coriander for my preference. Seasonings smelled like felafel when cooking.  I felt like it needed something, so I offered plain yogurt and a RED SAUCE to serve atop (one 15 oz. can of crushed tomatoes OR one can pureed diced, 1-2 Tbs. of red wine vinegar, two minced/pressed garlic cloves, salt and red pepper flakes to taste). This sauce is used on another Egyptian dish, kushari. I will try Arabic pepper in the filling next time for more complexity, which will taste more Mid-Eastern. Israeli couscous accompanied this nicely. Thanks for the recipe!

This was tasty but I thought the cumin over powered the other flavors. I only put 1 teaspoon, but I think next time I'll just put half or none at all. Good budget friendly recipe though.

We loved this!  Didn't add in the zucchini flesh but used browned turkey sausage instead.  It will be one of our favorites.

So many reviewers are saying that the mixture didn't "hold together". Simply dice the whole zucchini and saute it with the rest of the ingredients. It won't look as pretty, but it will be easier to eat.

Even though both my husband and I love all of the ingredients separately, they just did not go well together. The zucchinis did not make good vessels to hold anything and are very difficult to eat out of and the stuffing did not hold together at all.

This dish was absolutely one of the best. I added roasted red pepper and omitted coriander since I don't have any. I might add more lemon next time.

Very healthy! Can do without so much cumin but is great with the chickpeas. Goes well with a side of chicken and salad.

We thought it was lacking in flavor.  It needs some sort of sauce, cheese on top, etc.  Very healthy, though.

Our entire family including our 11 month old and 3 1/2 year old loved this dish.  We used one giant zucchini from our garden picked the day before.  I followed this recipe exactly except I used 3/4 tsp coriander and 1 1/4 tsp cumin and used a leek instead of an onion.  I did use the entire can of chickpeas.  I took other's advice and pureed half of the mixture in the blender since i didn't have a Cuisinart.  The only thing I would mention is our mixture was really wet so it probably would have been fine without blending half.  It made it a little like a paste and had the texture of dahl but we still really liked it.  I topped it with some parmesan the last 15 minutes or so of baking.  For our 11 month old I blended the mixture before I added all the salt and he LOVED it.  Our 3 1/2 year old scooped out all the filling and then ate some of the zucchini cut up.  Overall a success! Oh and I covered it with foil for about half of the baking.

Well, the flavors were fine - all the flavors of hummus.  But, it really needed a binder of some sort.  The filling just rolled out of the zucchini boats.  Also, it really needed color.  The parsley didn't even perk up the color.  Next time I think I'll add some breadcrumbs and maybe an egg as a binder, and some shredded carrots for color.

This recipe was pretty good. I had to hollow  my zucchini out an extra lot so that it could cook properly. overall it looks nice for  a potluck or something. It might be good with rice in it to make it more filling

This recipe was delicious!  Some changes: I mashed 1/2 the chickpeas, added a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar, used sage instead of coriander, and I crumbled a little bit of goat cheese on top of the zucchini. My husband loved them too!

I love vegetarian dishes and was eager to try this stuffing.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.  I'm also very suprised that so many others enjoyed it.  Too many chick peas for my taste, and it didn't hold together like a stuffing would.  Thanks for the recipe but I don't think I'll try it again.

What an easy, healthy dinner. I replaced the mushrooms with wild rice since my husband doesn't like mushrooms. Wonderful! The lemon and the herbs make it taste so fresh. A few of these and a side of pasta would be a great weeknight meatless meal. I used 2 regular size zucchini's and stuffed 3 little baby ones. Those were so cute. Hollowed them out with a little spoon.

I served these with tomato sauce and it was 'ok'. But, couple of adjustments would rather work. 1- Add some grated cheddar on top. 2- Listen to other people's suggestions, puree half the mixture, otherwise it's impossible to eat!

The first time I made this as written and that's why I gave it 2 star.  But then I went off the advice of some other reviewers; I added chopped roasted red pepper, grated parmesan and Italian style bread crumbs to the stuffing.  I also roughly chopped the chickpeas for improved stuffing texture.  I omitted the coriander, and as much as I usually enjoy cumin, I did not care for the flavor with this dish.  When I made it more Italian-style, omitting the cumin and adding Italian seasoning and topping with a dallop of tomato sauce, my husband and I found it MUCH more enjoyable.

Okay, I'm going to rate this on the overall flavors of the dish, since my preparation ended up being waaaaaay different that suggested, due to my inability to properly scoop the zucchini meat out. I ended up trying to chop up the zucchini in the blender with some tomatoes, but I accidentally set it on liquefy instead of chop, and ended up with zuccini in applesauce consistency. ooops. So I added it in with the chickpeas, onions and spices (I left out the mushrooms). I added some chili powder and poured it all over some white rice and baked it. It would have been good, except there wasn't quite enough liquid to make all of the rice cook. Half of it was, but the rice up top was still hard. Still, I picked around those pieces just to taste how it came out, and the flavors of the spices with eveything were quite good, so I'm sure if I would have prepared this dish as it is listed, it would have been quite tasty. So if you choose to do something like I did, make sure you add some extra water to the dish so that all the rice cooks!

I made this for Thanksgiving....we all enjoyed it. I added sage to this and other seasonings that I would normally put in stuffing. I cooked it longer, about one hour and thirty min. The zucchini was thick so I would recommend scooping out more than the recipe states. Very tasty.

This was so tasty!! Just a note though -- get the largest zucchini you can and use a melon baller. I used teeny zucchini and while it was easy to eat, they were hard to stuff and chickpeas were rolling everywhere.

im always looking for ways to use chickpeas and loved this recipe. The flavor was good.  Next time I'll add a little less chickpeas and more veggies like diced tomatoes and spinach.

Good vegetable dish. Didn't have the chick peas, but I increased the onions & mushrooms, (used fresh mushrooms). Also added some garlic and parmesan cheese on top. Cover during cooking, then uncover for just a few minutes to brown, this keeps it a bit moister.

This dish was unexpectedly delicious.  Following the advice of another reviewer, I chopped the zucchini innards and chick peas in my food processor (left the mushrooms whole).  I think pureeing the chick peas is key to keep their flavor from being too concentrated and overwhelming.  I also added only one tsp. of cumin.  Topped with queso fresco (mexican cheese), and this made a perfect, low-calorie meal.

I'm sorry, but I just didn't care for this recipe.  I found the cumin overpowering and I didn't care for the chick peas.  Might like it better if I reduced the amount of cumin that the recipe calls for.  My husband enjoyed it though.

Used the basic idea of the recipe, but changed it up.  Sauteed CHOPPED onion, carrot, garlic, mushrooms, chickpeas, and zucchini insides.  I didn't want the seasonings, as I've recently had a meal with those same seasonings.  Decided to add some moisture and flavor by adding into the saute 1/2 water plus a scoop of chicken bouillon. Microwaved the hollowed squash and chopped potatoes (6 min each) in the microwave so I would have a head start on the cook process.  Placed stuffed zucchini (with chopped potatoes around the sides with a little lemon pepper seasoning on them) in a covered dish and cooked 30 minutes.  The stuffing held together and everything was nicely done.  It was a tasty meal in one dish.  When I am not burnt out on the recipe spices, I will try them. Fabulous meal that really hit the spot!

The zucchinis were hard to keep in tact, but the presentation was great and everything was ultimately delicious

Very good recipe.  Could have had more garlic and I used two huge cloves for this preparation.  Also, stuffing the zucchini was difficult.  Will try using a food processor next time, as one reviewer suggested.

I have zucchini coming out of my ears, my garden is so full. So I tried this, among many other stuffed zucchini recipes. I pureed half of the filling and then added the chunky half to that, which seemed to help hold the filling together, but it was still not of a stuffing consistency. The spices were good, but next time I will add bell pepper, maybe celery, and maybe sweet white corn: it needed some more veggies. It's a very workable recipe, so if you are comfortable, try adding some veggies that you like. I will make this again, but definitely with some self-refining.

Sadly, this recipe did not go over well at our house.  The "stuffing" isn't held together at all so eating it was awkward. The flavors didn't seem to meld together. The best word we could come up with for it was "odd".  I'm glad others liked it but it wasn't for us.

The chickpeas dried out too much in the oven. The overall flavor was lacking for our family and I didn't have the urge to change the recipe.

After reading all the rave reviews, I was really looking forward to this recipe. I'm not sure what happened, but I was underwhelmed. I added a splash of stewed tomatoes, but it didn't enhance too much. Maybe a little parmesan cheese over the top? Thanks anyway.

Don't know what went wrong as I followed the recipe exactly.  We ate some of it and through the rest out.  Didn't seem to have much flavour and the texture was odd.

I made it exactly as instructed and it was underwhelming. It was a lot of work and not very exciting in flavor. Fell apart while trying to eat it, chickpeas rolling everywhere. Definitely not worth the time.

Made it according to the recipe. Very tasty. Next time I may try to smash the chickpeas a bit because they were rolling all over the place which made it hard to eat.

I loved the flavors! They are not something I'm used to but loved it. The hint of lemon was really special on this. What I'd try differently next time is to par cook the zucchini boat a bit, perhaps when the other veggies are cooking in the fry pan I'll put the boats upside down on top and then put the lid on the pan, only until it's a bit softened, I just felt it took way too long for the original method to bake. You do want it bake the whole thing because it adds another level of flavor.

O.M.G. These are so good! Definitely would give them 10 stars if I could! They only thing I did differently was to add paprika along with the other spices. And my zucchini were a little bit bigger so they took about 48 minutes to cook. These are absolutely delicious, thank you so much for the recipe!

Wonderful! Took other reviewers advice and did not make the "boats." Sliced the zucchini instead. Mashed 2/3 of the chickpeas, kept same amount of cumin, omitted coriander and doubled the lemon juice. I cooked it completely in the skillet. I am a fan of cumin and saw others saying it was too powerful, maybe adding the extra juice helped "lessen" the overwhelming flavor?

These were a pretty great meatless main dish. Extra thanks to the reviewer that suggested a melon baller to scoop out the zucchini, that tip was a big time saver.

Oh my god this is amazing!!! I added a few extra things to it but it is now my new favorite dish! So I added mashed potatoes on top of all this... it's a must! And I made a tomato, roasted garlic, caramelized onions chutney. Yumm can't wait to make this again!

I made a couple small adjustments: added a second clove of garlic, and added some additional seasoning (maybe too much of it). Great blend of ingredients, will definitely make again but cut back on the spices for my Fiance.

Love this. Super easy -I made it while my arm was in a sling.  I used Italian seasoning instead of the coriander and cumin, but the rest was the same. Delicious!

I made a few changes to the original recipe and I really enjoyed how it came out! I'm not a big fan of cumin and coriander so I used thyme and oregano instead. I highly recommend cutting back on the lemon juice or at least using a really small lemon. After I sauteed the vegetables I put them all in a blender. I stuffed that mixture into my zucchini and then topped it with crushed walnuts for some texture. Sooo good!

These are delicious. Easy to make as well. I added more mushrooms and cut the coriander. Topped with some Asiago cheese. Will be making these again!

Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.  I wouldn't have changed a thing, but I used some cilantro I had dried since I didn't have ground coriander.  Such a healthy option for people like me who don't eat animal protein.  The chickpeas offered great protein substitution.

This was a wonderful dish, I used a food processor to make the stuffing as someone suggested and processed the zucchini and mushrooms and added that mixture to the frying pan with the onions and garlic. (Added one more clove of garlic) I also smashed the chickpeas slightly before adding them and a little turmeric. Cooked a little longer than suggested and served with jasmine rice and fresh tomatoes. So yummy

This is not great. I pureed the stuffing like one reviewer recommended. I don't recommend that. It looks and tastes like a chickpea based dogfood smushed into a zucchini. If I had to make again, I would not puree, would use way way less chickpeas and more mushrooms. Heavily salt it, not lemon juice --which made it taste sour and not fresh as was probably the intention. Needs some additional spice too--not sure what. It was very plain. And maybe cover with tin foil to have the zucchini cook to a more tender state.

Loved this recipe....with a few augmentations :-)  I put the chick peas in the food processor and pulsed them till they got to the texture I wanted. I also added the cumin to taste. Cumin can be very overpowering so use it sparingly.

I would definitely make this again. In addition to the chickpeas I added black beans just because I wanted more variety of color and some crushed red pepper just to kick it up a notch. It was delicious and quite easy.

I really loved these. Made exactly as written except used dried parsley for fresh as it's what I had on hand. I think from here on out I'll just use whole zucchini for the mixture rather than scooping and refilling shell with filling, unless for presentation's sake. But it was delicious!

Food processor is a must! I feel the shells needed seasoning. Next time I think I'll salt and pepper them before filling. Mushrooms could benefit from being sauteed before adding zucchini. The filling seems a bit watery, next time I will let it reduce more. Flavors are solid!

I'm giving it a good rating, but I haven't made it or tried it. I have a final project in my food, nutrition, and wellness class, and our requirements are to make a vegan or vegetarian dish. I wanted to do something that'd be challenging to me. I'm hoping this dish will help me win that 100 on my final. Crossing my fingers.

Loved it.
I made a few changes...took out the chick peas and was going to replace them with black beans.....but forgot to add them haha.

Instead of zuchini i used an eggplant and it tasted great. Also served with a 1/2 cup of rice mixed with each half

The flavors were nice, but the recipe is missing something.  Not sure if I'll make it again.  If I did, I'd try pureeing some of the mixture, and either add cheese over the tomato sauce or try it with a curry sauce instead.

These were simple and great! I really like the fresh flavor of the zucchini with the texture of the chick peas. A little hard to eat when you don't halve the zucchini, especially if it's a long one! Try these!

This is a great, healthy recipe. The zucchini boats would make nice side items, and my husband and I even ate them as the main course. As one reviewer already stated, the secret is in pureeing the filling before baking in the zucchini shells. I used my Magic Bullet to puree the cooked filling. It was so good, even my 2-year-old daughter ate it!

I didn't have any plum tomatoes, so left those out and added one chopped vine tomato. Used juice of a whole lemon, lovely. Ran out of coriander, so used a little extra cumin and s&p. I tasted the mixture in the pan before I filled the zucchini, and it was delicious. However, the end product wasn't that sensational. I think the sauteed mixture would have tasted better just poured over rice, but perhaps it dried out a bit too much in the oven. I actually had leftovers in the pan after stuffing, which I added rice to. When I asked my boyfriend if he liked the meal, he said he really liked the rice but didn't comment on the zucchini. I thought zucchini tasted fine, just not sensational.
