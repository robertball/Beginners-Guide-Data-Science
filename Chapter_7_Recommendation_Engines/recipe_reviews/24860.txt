Even my husband chose this one!  A friend suggested adding mini marshmallows to sweeten it a little...used "Cool Whip" instead of the whipped cream (for time-saver)-very good!

I gave this a pre holiday test run.  It was a fine salad but too bland for my personal taste. Approx. 3 TB powdered sugar could be pre mixed with the cream cheese for improvement.

I added some extra sugar to the whipping cream and then added one large can of mandarins & pineapple, it needed a bit more fruit for me. I'm sure it will taste even better tomorrow after it chills.
