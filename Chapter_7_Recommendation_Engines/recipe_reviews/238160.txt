Everyone loved it! Made it as listed. Just be sure to really grill/blacken the corn. This adds an incredible sweetness. Great with fish tacos!

A killer slaw! I doubled the lime juice, cumin and cilantro.  I used feta I place of queso fresco and it was delicious! I ate it by itself and kept coming back for more! So so good!

This was fantastic!  I'm making it again to serve with white chicken chili.  The colors are beautiful.

Served this as a side dish with fish and shrimp tacos. It was delicious! I followed recipe exactly as instructed. Huge hit with my family, even my very picky daughter loved it. Will definitely use this recipe again and again!
