This was a nice change from the typical jello for Thanksgiving.  Nice and light-even better left over!

We grew up eating Jello Salad, and this is a great recipe.  The only negative is that anytime Mandarin oranges are used, the salad gets watery.  Other than that, there is a lot of flavor and textures in this salad.  Thanks for the recipe!

I usually leave out the maraschino cherries and nuts when I make this and it's always good.

This is a very good recipe that has been on here for many years with few reviews.  Not sure how I found this recipe with the title of it, but I am glad I did.  I took this salad to a ladies dinner at church and came home with an empty bowl.  I also made some in jell-o molds for my family.  I used all the ingredients, but halved the maraschino cherry amount.  Make sure you drain your fruit really well.  I did not cut the mandarin oranges in half, they broke up nicely when I folded in the whipped topping.  You could easily change up the jell-o flavor in this salad.  Thanks bestrachan for sharing your Thanksgiving salad recipe.

My Grandmother has been making this salad for Thanksgiving for as long as I can remember.  Everyone loves it!  We affectionately refer to it as "Orange Stuff."

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe! It wasn't as thick as I was hoping for it to be so the next time I make it I'll double the cottage cheese. Great dessert!

this recipe has been a very popular one in my family for years, however we like it with a little more texture, so we double the cottage cheese.  pretty darn close to perfect

My daughters loved this and took half the leftovers of it from Thanksgiving.  I bought a 6 oz. package of Orange Jello and used probably 4 oz. of it.  Great!

To cut the sweetness of this salad, I usually leave out cherries and nuts, add 2t lemon juice and add finely chopped celery.The flavor is excellent.

I loved this receipe. I made it for the family Christmas dinner without trying it first but it was wonderful. I read the prior reviews about the mandarin oranges making it a little juicy. Instead of adding another container of cottage cheese as some of the other reviewers did, I added thickness by throwing in 1 1/2 cups of mini marshmallows. It was a hit. NO leftovers!

I wanted to try something different for a salad at Easter and found this recipe. I  did not vary from the recipe. I served this to my family and the concensus was that although they thought it had good flavor, they did not like the consistency of the cottage cheese in it.  Most of them did not finish their serving. My hubby and I liked it, and would make it again. If I make it for a family gathering again, I would probably substitute yogurt or  puree the cottage cheese however.
