Made as written and this was excellent! It wasn't the prettiest sauce but it sure was tasty! I thought the black pepper was going to be overpowering but it wasn't at all. Not sure if it was the brandy and cream or what but the sauce had an espresso taste about it that worked perfectly with the peppered steak. Hubs gave this two thumbs up and mentioned it several times throughout the rest of the evening. Definite keeper!

Came out really good!  Only change I made, was I used some green onions, instead of shallots, because we donâ€™t like a strong onion flavor.  Also, I used a cast iron frying pan, which worked well.  I will make this again!
