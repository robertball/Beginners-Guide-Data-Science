For those of you having trouble with the cookies being, dry, crumbly, or are having trouble removing them from the cookie sheet, it's probably because there is not enough butter in the dough.  Try a full cup of butter, not 3/4 cup. For those having trouble with flat cookies, simply refrigerate your dough until it is somewhat firm.

These cookies are sooo yummy! I took some of the suggestions and lowered the temperature to 350 also and baked for about 9 minutes.  I also refrigerated the dough for about 5 minutes and greased the cookie sheets with Pam.  They turned out chewy and disappeared quickly! Thanks for the great recipe! :-)

These cookies are scrumptious!  I can remember my mom making these for me when I was younger and we called them "Oatmeal Scotties" - I did make a few changes in the cooking temperature.  I lowered the baking temperature to 350 degrees, and baked for 8 minutes.  I lined the cookie sheet w/ parchment, and after I had baked the cookies, I let them cool for about 5 minutes, and had no problem w/ the cookies sticking to the pan, or breaking, etc.,  They were very soft, and not brittle...great recipe!

This was a nice, classic cookie. I like my cookies to be soft and chewy so I took the advice of another review and cooked at 350 for about 9 minutes. Those were perfect for me. My husband likes crunchy cookies, so his were cooked for about 12-13 minutes. He's thrilled - I'm thrilled. Everyone's happy!

These cookies taste great, just as I remember as a kid.  However, my cookies spread significantly and were very thin and lacy.  I prefer a somewhat thicker cookie, and after adding extra four to the remaining dough, had the perfect oatmel butterscotch cookie.  I would strongly suggest adding an additional 1/2 cup of flour to the batter for thicker cookies that don't spread too much.

These are good, but they're PERFECT if you only bake them 6.5-7 minutes.  Nice and chewy and just PERFECT.  These are now my trademark cookies.

This recipe is verbatim the same recipe from the Nestle bag. Having said that, I usually have to increase the butter for the "bag" recipes. I increased butter to 1 cup, and baked a test batch. They spread a little more than I like, so I added a tablespoon of flour, and insted of dropping them on the cookie sheet, I rolled the dough into 1" balls. The rest of them came out perfect!

These cookies were very yummy!  I only used 1 cup of mini butterscotch chips, and they turned out fine! I think I will use a little less sugar, and a little more cinamon and vanilla the next time I make them.  Using parchment paper definitely made it easier.  They did stick to the cookie sheet on the first batch.

Neither myself or my fiance really care for butterscotch, but I decided to make these for a welcomed change... and WOW!!! We both loved these- the textures and tastes were fantastic.   I found it useful to cool the dough a little in order to keep them from flattening out.   I made cookies twice the stated size and baked them for a few minutes more and they were delicious.  Thanks Jolene!  This recipe is a keeper- next time I'll try raisins in place of the chips.  Mmmmmm.

These are fantastic tasting cookies!!! The only reccomendation I have is to grease the cookie sheet, as they are a little hard to get off of the pan. Other than that would not change a thing. Huge Hit!!!

This is a solid oatmeal cookie recipe. I followed the recipe as written and agree with other reviews that one cup of butter is better but may be a bit much unless you adore rich and buttery. I suspect some of the other issues in the reviews may be due to technique, not the recipe. With any mix, such as cookies, brownies or bars, over mixing causes a flat hard product. After creaming the butter, eggs, sugars and vanilla, mix the remaining dry ingredients by hand or very carefully with a mixer. You do not want to mix the flour completely in and should clearly still see flour in the mix. With a recipe where you are adding oats, nuts, or chips at the end...mix the flour even less. I cheat and use my mixer...I just pop it on and off, scrap the sides of the bowl (yeah, that's important) and do it again til the flour is just barely mixed in. For those getting a lacy cookie...did you use quick oats or the full "old fashioned" oats? I would suggest the old fashioned type oats that have all the fiber or add more flour for the quick oats. I baked at 375 for 9 mins and got a cookie that was brown on the edge and just barely cooked in the middle. Shiny not doughy. Bake for 11 minutes for a crunchy cookie. I hope this helps out.

I loved these cookies growing up! This recipe is pretty good. I like them more soft and chewy, so make them big drops and take them out just as the edges are set, just a touch golden brown.

These are AWESOME!!! Even my aunt who doesn't like buterscotch loved them. Couple suggestions that were super helpful from other readers.
1. Refrigerate dough for about 10-15 mins before baking. (helps keep them from flattening out)
2. Line the cookie sheet with wax or parchment paper so they peel off easily.
3. Let cool for 10 mins before removing from cookie sheet so they don't break apart.
I also added some chopped pecans because my family loves nuts! ENJOY!

I will be making these over and over! I was short on the butterscotch chips but, my mom wanted oatmeal raisin so I split the dough and some got raisins, some got butterscotch chip and some had both.  I did take other people's advice and used a full cup of butter. These were outrageously good!

These turned out wonderful!  They were perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  Two tips for making these turn out great - 1) Use parchment paper so they don't stick, and 2) refrigerate the dough slightly so they don't turn out like pancakes.

Thank you, Jolene, for a truly marvelous butterscotch oatmeal cookie.  I used slightly rounded teaspoons and ended up with 108 cookies rather than the 48 that were advertised. Each slightly rounded teaspoon gave me a ball just 1" in diameter, and they baked lovely nicely mounded cookies 1 3/4" in diameter. Anyway, great cookies, just a bit off on the yield.

These were very good. I just made a few slight changes for personal preference  and followed some other reviewer's tips. I used closer to one cup of butter for softness, used 1 tsp. cinnamon instead of 1/2 (which I thought brought out the flavor nicely without being overwhelming), used only 1/2 c. of white sugar (which turned out great) and baked them at 350F for 9 mins (after letting the dough refrigerate for approx 30 mins). The batch made 45 mini cookies and they turned out very soft and delicious :)

This is the exact recipe from Hershey's, but it really is the best one I've tried.  I found that if I roll the dough into little balls, it holds together better and doesn't run. Sometimes I add a little nutmeg with the cinnamon.  My boyfriend is always asking me to make these for him, and he's not even big on sweets.

These are delicious!  I made according to the directions, but my oven must not be hot enough, because even at 375 I baked them for 13 minutes.  I used a small cookie scoop.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe.  I added about 1/4 of coconut for some extra chewiness...FANTASTIC.  Cook on 325 to avoid spreading. Yes, they are very sweet so if you are concerned, use a bit less sugar.

These cookies are very good. I did take the advice of a few reviewers regarding the baking temperature,time,amount of sugar,butter, and flour. I also put them in the fridge for a while. I would say about 30 minutes as someone suggested. My cookies came out just right not too flat not too thick. The only ones that flattened a bit were the ones that had less dough and had more butterscotch morsels in it. This happended with my last batch. I highly recommend using 1/2 a cup of each of the sugars,because the butterscotch morsels will add the rest. Add the full cup of butter and 1 1/2 cup of flour. Bake for no more than 8 minutes and always do a test cookie according to the baking sheet you have. Darker sheets tend to brown them faster than the lighter colored ones. I also have a rule of letting the sheets cool off completely before putting more cookies on the same sheet. The principle is simple: a warm cookie sheet will start the melting of the butter much faster and therefore your cookie has a higher chance of spreading and burning. Please do refrigerate the dough before baking it this will also contribute to decrease the spreading. EDIT: I just made these cookies after a long time without baking them. I strongly suggest to lower the temperature to 350F and bake for 8 minutes only. This should be enough to prevent over baking of the cookie, spreading, and burning of the morsels.

I've made these cookies a few times for parties, and they're a real hit -- even for those who don't go for oatmeal cookies!  I agree with others who have said to lower the temp and bake for a shorter time.

Also, I highly recommend parchment paper.  I was convinced the first time I used it.

I am giving this one a 5 Star rating.  The hands down winner in this house has always been Nestles Tollhouse Chocolate Chip cookies for years.  I made this for something different and my daughter swiped a few and brought them over to her boyfriends parents house.  From what I heard, the dad was grabbing them by the handful.  Compliments were received for several days and my daughter said these were the best cookies I had ever made.  Poor, poor Tollhouse...  ; )  I thought that they were on the sweet side, but I was the only one to mention it.  I have to highly recommend these.

These were great.  I gave it four stars instead of five because I changed two things.  I used 2 sticks of unsalted butter and set the oven at 350 instead of 375 and baked for 10 minutes for a couple of batches and 9 minutes for the rest.  I will definitely make them again.  I love butterscotch!

I honestly wondered how bad these cookies were going to look based on the reviews others had made about how they do not look pretty.  I was pleasantly surprised... they looked like a regular choc chip cookie and we really enjoyed the flavor!!  I took the advise of others and greased the cookie sheet, they came off the pan perfectly!  A great recipe!  I will make it again, thanks!

These are so good they are almost painful.  Such a great butterscotch flavor to them.  I made them exactly as the recipe stated and cooked for 10 minutes so they would be crispy and they are just perfect.

I cut the butterscotch down to 1 and 1/3 cup, and then added some chocolate chips (for me!).  THe texture is great, not to cakey but chewy and crispy on the edges.

Easy to make......easy to eat! These cookies were very good. Next time I think I will add walnuts or coconut. The cookies took no time to mix and they held together well and had a nice gold color.
The kids liked them as well.

i halved the recipe and it made 43 mini-scooper-ful (the small ice-cream scooper things) cookies. i was pleasantly surprised b/c the batter was stiff and i thought i had done something wrong, but these cookies are oatmeal-hearty with rich, sweet butterscotch chips for balance. baking for 8 minutes was perfect for my little cookies--they came out crispy on the outside and soft&chewy on the inside. thanks for the recipe!

Very Easy/Very Good! Made these for a hydroplane boat race driver who "LOVES" butterscotch, & the crew. Received lots of compliments and requests to please bring more!! It even got a A+ from my husband who claims "there is no cookie in the world other than chocolate chip"....but he gobbled these up, and had to admit that they were pretty darn good--These butterscotch cookies sat side by side to a batch of choc. chip cookies at our SeaFair party and these were the ones that were GONE in no time.  The kids loved them too. I had several neighbors come over to "taste test" prior to bringing them down to the boat crew--then I ended up having to HIDE the cookies so there would be some left for our party!! Now the wives of the crew members are requesting the recipe, so thanks for sharing!!

These cookies were very easy to make. I halved the recipe myself and even though I took a guess on a few measurements, they were great. Chewy on the inside and crisp on the edges. They look like they are very doughy when they come out of the oven but they are done around 9 mins. Yum!

THE SECRET: If you have trouble with this cookies turning out too thin and sticking to the cookie sheet, simply substitute 1 cup of butter-flavored shortening for the butter. The cookies will turn out with a much better texture--denser, more height. So simple, yet so effective!

My new favorite cookie. These were excellent. Slightly crispy on the outside, but moist on the inside. Chilling the dough helped to make a cookie that doesn't flatten out.

If you have trouble with the cookie spreading too much, try buttering the cookie sheet lightly, then coat the buttered surface lightly with flour.

This is actually almost identical to the Nestle Scotchies recipe, just less butter. Welcome change, as it firms them up some.

My advice would be to increase the butter to a full cup and lower the temp to 350. They edges browned way too quickly at 375 and the centers were runny. Once I made the adjustments they were decent. I would also suggest using wax paper as they stuck SO badly.

My rating is a four only because I don't care for the butterscotch chips.  The cookie part is very good, will probably add raisins or chocolate chips next time.

This is a very good, tasty cookie! One change that I made is I added about 3/4's of the butterscotch chips and then added some chopped pecans. Also keep a careful eye on your 1st batch, the temp was too high for my oven. I baked them at 350. A GREAT treat!!!!!

Great recipe base here!
For healthier cookies,use wholewheat flour, cut back 1/3d of the sugars, substitute 1c. of organic milled flax seed. WOW, it's fabulous and nutty flavour with a health kick even for the pickiest eaters. 
REMEMBER, using BUTTER in baking is a must, those margarines and other shortenings don't deliver that creamy, fullfilling taste. Margarine-based baking's taste is flat and hollow and the texture is much different. All traditional recipes have called for butter, pastry chefs swear by it. Every culinary expert can tell the difference immediately, so butter up and unsalted is the correct choice. Happy cooking and baking!

Turned out delicious with a few modifications: increased to 1 cup butter to make them very moist, and reduced the white and brown sugar so they were not overly hurt your teeth sweet. I set the oven to 350 and baked for 8 minutes so they came out very soft and not dry. I was disappointed that the butterscotch chips didn't melt, next time I would probably pre-melt these for a more unified butterscotch flavour throughout. I also had extra butterscotch chips left over and made a cookie glaze for an extra punch of flavour! -CW

I increased the butter to 1 cup, used my big cookie scoop and cooked them 12 minutes at 350 degrees.  Perfect big, chewy, crispy edged, cookies.  I had no trouble removing them from the parchment paper after allowing them to cool for about 10 minutes.  Very good!  I will make these again!

I was disappointed with these cookies. They did not hold together at all while baking, even when I covered the baking sheet with parchment paper. It did make good granola, once I crumbled it, though. Not healthy granola, but good.

We love these cookies; however, I did make some changes. I decreased the oats to 2 3/4 cups and increased the flour to 1 1/2 cups. I cooked them at 300 degrees for 15 minutes and turned the cookie sheet around halfway through. This lower temperature made it so that they did not spread too much and over cook the edges. They came out perfect!

I loved it!  It turned out great. Thanks for the comments on this site. I, too, put the dough in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes before I put it on the cookie sheet.  I also, modified the recipe.  I used 1 cup of butter - baked it at 350 for 10 mins - my cookies dough were about 1 tablespoon on the cookie sheet.

I found it was easier to lift the cookies off of the pan when I had aluminum foil underneath.  I also substituted apple sauce for butter and egg beaters for eggs.  They were wonderful!

These taste wonderful, but for me they were not at all fluffy enough and too thin. They thin out when you back them and there is nothing to them.

I was not very thrilled when my brother wanted to make these cookies.  Butterscotch is really not at the top of my list.  I decided to go for it anyway.  Baking cookies with your brother on a Saturday evening is just pain fun and out of the ordinary.  Just the smell of these cookies make your mouth water and mmmmm when they hit your taste buds...EXPLOSION of yummy goodness.  Very easy recipe to follow and the suggestions are right on.  Bake at 350 for about 7 minutes for chewy cookies to die for.  Have ample milk on hand to wash these delicious treats down.

I followed these exactly and they turned out perfect.  I LOVE butterscotch and oatmeal.  Next time, just for fun, I may add raisins and nuts! My first batch I didn't grease the pan as it said not to~ and they stuck horribly!  PLEASE use wax paper! Wonderful recipe!

Chewy yet crunchy in all the right places. I cooked these at 350 for 8 minutes. They were just turning golden around the edges - thought they weren't done but took them out anyway to cool. Glad I did - they were perfect if you don't like hard and crunchy cookies. I will make again for sure. P.S. - These are also great for icecream sandwiches!

We loved these cookies. I made exactly as written and baked them for 8 minutes at 375.  They turned out mostly chewy with just a slight crispness and they didn't stick to the pans at all. I might try to reduce the sugar a little next time as they were a tad on the sweet side.

These cookies are delicious!  Followed the recipe exactly except for the chopped up walnuts I threw in at the end.  And lowered oven temp to 350, cooking for 11 minutes.  If I loved sweets the way some people do, these cookies would have been gone before my husband got home from work!  Thanks for sharing!

My taste testers said they were crispy on the outside, with a nice chewy center. My only difficulty with the recipe was removing them from the pan. I used a Sil-Pat and needed to wait until they were completely cooled to pull them off in one piece.

I made these into bars!  I used 2 tbsp more of butter than specified, as others have suggested and cut the white sugar to just 1/4 cup.  I omitted the cinnamon and the chips.  I took the batter and divided between two small baking pans (brownie size) - then because everyone in the house has different tastes - I sprinkled peanut butter chips and chopped pecans over the top of one and chocolate chips and chopped pecans over the other.  I baked them for about 20 minutes and they came out great - almost like a cake - not too sweet - so perfect to microwave and top with vanilla ice cream!  Thanks for the base recipe!!!!

Oh my is this cookie tasty! My husband and I can't stop eating them! The first time I made them, our only complaint was that they came out a little thin and crispy. The second time... THE PERFECT COOKIE. So I'm updating to tell you what I did to get it perfect. The only change I made to the listed ingrediants the second time was to add 5 teaspoons of flour. That's it. Cooked for 9 min at 350, and it was perfect. The cookies will look "undone" or "undercooked", but give them a minute to cool and they will be perfect. For me, what killed me the first time was adding the 1/4 cup butter back in that was on the Tollhouse bag. DO NOT DO. Tollhouse is wrong, Jolene is right. I made 70 cookies for a house of 10 and they were gone in a day.

OH MY!  These cookies are delicious!  They went to the top of my list in a heartbeat!  I made them according to the recipes, but added a little more chips (because you can never have TO much, am I right?).  They came out beautifully, and were wonderfully right off of the tray, and even the next day.  One thing to note:  Be careful not to over-bake, which may be easy because they never really looked "done".  8 minutes is perfect for those who like their cookies with a little gooeyness.  You must try this recipe!  5 stars.

Great cookies, although i haven't baked for many years. Recently i took up baking more and more. I made these cookies once before and gave it to some of the people at my work and they loved them. I have people always wanting to know when i will be baking more of these cookies. Over all I would suggest the 8 mins to baking, as that is perfect for this recipe. The outcome is chewy and soft, it easily triumphed some of my favorite cookies.

These cookies are really good. I wasn't too sure about the butterscotch so I only mixed the chips in enough to make one batch and try it. To my delight they were very yummy! I did reduce the heat to 350 and I think next time I'll use 1/2 the salt. I'll make this again.

EDIT (Dec 12)// I made these tonight and decided to add a dash of nutmeg... so good! Try it!

EDIT (Oct 2010)// Made these twice in the last week except instead of oatmeal and butterscotch I added muesli. They are delicious!

I am so disappointed in what I thought would be a delicious cookie for the holidays. I didn't read any of the reviews, I just saw that it had a high rating so I assumed they would be great. The taste isn't bad, but these cookies stuck to the pan so badly that I am unable to get half of them off. Some of them broke while I was trying to remove them. I tried to remove them when they were still warm, and they were falling apart, so I waited a few more minutes and now they are like hard rocks glued to my pan. I've made the same cookies several times before with a different recipe and NEVER had a problem like this. I would not recommend these.

These cookies turned out awful. The flavor was good but they crumbled in your hands before you could eat them. I was surprised because it got good reviews. Too bad, I love oatmeal butterscotch.

I first used this recipe when it was on the back of a Hershey's label. Instead of butterscotch chips, I used milk chocolate toffee pieces.  Made them DELICIOUS!  One of my husband's friends kept saying, "Man, what are in these things? they're awesome!"

This is a great cookie. I use milk chocolate chips, sometimes by themselves or sometimes combined with the butterscotch (cut back to about 1 cup to 1 1/4 cup of chips). I also cut the white sugar back to 1/2 cup and add 1 tablespoon of honey.

Amazing recipe. Followed the tip of other reviewers: I decreased both sugars to a half cup each, AND only added  one cup of butterscotch chips (and 2/3 cups chocolate chips). It was still insanely sweet. I also added 3/4 cup dried cranberries, half cup chopped walnuts, and half cup raw sunflower seeds. The cookies were demolished very quickly. LOVE the recipe, and will put even less sugar (or butterscotch chips) next time!!!

Also... 9 minutes does seem to be the magic number (I dropped by level tablespoons).

These are positively deadly. I just had one warm from the oven. I better give some of these away or else we're in trouble! The recipe is similar to the one on the chips bag, only that one calls for 2 sticks of butter, not 1 1/2 sticks like this one. I used two sticks. May as well, right? Delicious recipe, thanks.

These were just ok for me.  I think there are too many butterscotch chips for my taste.  They really stuck to my new cookie sheets but came off fine when I used my "seasoned" cookie sheets.  I think I'll try them again using half butterscotch, half choc. chips.

These cookies stick to the cookie sheet like nothing else!  To anyone making these, I definitely suggest using a greased cookie sheet over an ungreased one.  Making the cookies larger and/or removing them before they begin to brown also seemed to help.  

That said, I did get some of them to turn out just right and they're quite good.  A little less sugar next time and I think I'll like them much better.

I'm not sure what I did wrong - but the cookies came out very thin and too crispy.  I'll have to try it again...

I wanted to make these cookies again but had to substitute because didn't have all ingredients on hand.  Here is what I did and they were still great.
-  Sub maple syrup for the white sugar
-  Sub 1/2 white chocolate chips and 1/2 coconut for the butterscotch chips.  Excellent!

Fantastically awesome cookies! Soft and chewy, stayed moist for weeks, and were greeted by rave reviews. I will definitely make them again, and soon!

I made an account just to warn people about these cookies. I have baked 1000 batches of cookies in my life and these are some of the worst. If using a new recipe, I'll come on here, look for a well reviewed one and follow the agreed upon suggestions in the comments. So for this recipe, since I like chewy cookies, I went for the full cup of butter, chilled the dough and did 9 minutes cooking time. I basically had a giant flat cookie in the pan time after time because the amount of butter was way too much. At nine minutes they were not done and required about 5 more minutes. The cookies were very greasy. I didn't see anyone mention the amount of sugar so I went with it against my better judgement, but it is way too much, and I have a major sweet tooth. Butterscotch chips are incredibly sweet as it is, you don't need 1.5 cups of sugar on top of that. I would suggest 1/2 cup white and 1/4 cup brown. This was a waste of ingredients and I urge you not to make them unless you want a sugar-induced headache.

These turn out fantastic (and will not fall flat) when you up the butter to 1 cup, up the flour to 2 cups and decrease the oats to 2 1/2 cups. Some tips: use whole oats, not quick oats. Make sure your butter and eggs are room temperature. Be sure your baking soda is fresh - it goes flat quickly in your pantry. Let these cookies rest on the cookie sheet for at least five minutes before removing to cooling rack. And lastly, (and this is just personal preference) I decrease the sugars to 2/3 cup each. The butterscotch morsels are very, very sweet. The decreased sugar allows for that so the cookies don't become overpoweringly sweet.

I have made these cookies several times. I use 1/2 cup applesauce or pumpkin in place of 1/2 cup of butter and use 1/4 cup butter. Also only 1/2 cup white and brown sugar or less. Reduce amount of chips to 1 cup and add a cup of cashews. Soooo good! Never dry and always a hit.

These cookies were fantastic!  The whole family loved them.  I'm sure I will make these again and again.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I reduced the sugars.  I used 1/2 cup each white and brown sugars as opposed to the 3/4 cup each the recipe called for.  That made 1/2 cup less dry ingredients in the recipe which may have been why I did not experience the dry cookie that some of the other reviewers reported.

Thank you!!

I made these for the first time for Thanksgiving. It was so easy to make these cookies.  By Thanksgiving day, more than have of the cookies were gone.  The only thing I omitted was the cinnamon, which I do not prefer.  They came out prefect without it.

I used Pam cooking spray and they stuck. Wax paper and they stuck. Oil and flour and they stuck :(.  They also came out like an old cookie that spent too much time in the sun. As much as I bake I think the problem is somewhere in the wet ingredients (most likely butter/margarine  choice).  I gave two stars because the crisps I made were edible, but the kids were not interested due to looks.  May add more butter to the rest that I  didn't even bother to cook tomorrow, but tonight just feeling disappointed

Used whole wheat flour instead of white flour (it was all I had in the kitchen!). They still turned out perfectly.  Would recommend using some parchment paper if you go this route, or a greased cookie sheet.

When I told my husband I was making oatmeal cookies, he turned up his nose and said "I guess." When my husband ate THESE oatmeal cookies, he couldn't get enough!! - To make these cookies faster I use a cookie sheet and my muffin tin. Surprisingly, the ones in the muffin tin got nice and thick and were even better tasting! Just a fun idea if you're in a rush

These cookies turned out amazing. I don't think the first dozen even made it to the cookie jar.

I followed a few of the suggestions and used a full cup of butter instead of 3/4. I also added another 1/2 cup of flour and 1/2 of oats and greased the pan. Bake time was 10 mins at 375. Cookies had to cool on pan first or they would have crumbled. Definitely recommend!

I really enjoyed these cookies, although they were a bit too sweet for me personally. Because there were many separate components in them, such as the oats and the butterscotch chips, they tended to fall apart more easily, so be sure to wait until they have cooled down (although they were delicious warm as well). All of my roommates kept eating them and coming back for more of the chewy, butterscotch-y goodness.

I needed a recipe for a cookie to send to my sons preschool as they were creating a mini cookbook. I do not do a lot of baking, not because i dont like to, but because ill eat it and I dont enjoy having things like that in the house. But, this being an exception i thought I would make this cookie before sending the recipe to the preschool. All i can say is the cookies turned out fabulous. I read some other reviews and added a little more butter then what was called for, and also cooked the cookies at a lower temp

I reduced the amount of sugars to 2/3 cup each and also added 1/2 cup of applesauce after mixing the dough (because it seemed too dry).  I also used 1 stick of Crisco instead of the butter.  I favor cinnamon so I doubled that amount, too.  Everyone loved the cookies.  I think I'll use even less sugar next time.  Bonus: I mixed 1/3 of the dough with 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts and that turned out really good, too.  It really changed the taste, was less sweet but still a good cookie.  =)

I love a cook cookie and have had many great Butterscotch cookies. However, this was way too sweet, even for a sweet tooth like me. Perhaps the instructions were suppose to say, 3/4 cup or white sugar OR 3/4 cup of brown sugar. Dangerously sweet.

I had to modify this recipe so much from the actual recipe here that it is no longer the same.  When I followed the recipe exactly, mixture wouldn't even hold together.

Yum!  Soft in the middle, crunchy on the outside.  Mine turned out perfect!  And the cinnamon added just a great touch, to keep the cookies from tasting too sweet.  Thank you for a new fave!

I made these cookies and they were fantastic.  I added to the  mix a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts.  My husband went back for more.  I did not add the cinnomon, I don't think that it mattered but I forgot to add it.  I also did not add the salt cause I used salted butter. They are a very sweet cookie.  I put in 48 serving size on this web site and ended up with 27  small cookies.  I would recommend these cookies and I will definatly make again.

I recommend using the recipe on the bag of butterscotch chips.  They come out perfect every time and I have never had problems with the dough or the shape of cookies.

I am so glad that I decided to make these!  They are crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside, perfection!  I did use a full cup of butter, but kept all of the other measurements the same. Even my husband, who says he doesn't like butterscotch, raved about these. The kids loved them, I loved them, and they will definately be going into my recipe box to make again!

Amazing cookies!!! Try adding a full teaspoon of cinnamon... It adds delicious flavor and makes the entire house smell incredible.  I use whole wheat flour and you can't tell the difference.

These taste really good, but they lack a little body.

Edit: I made these a second time with 1 c Butter Crisco instead of butter and an additional 1/2 c Flour. They had the same great taste but much better consistency. I'll make them that way from now on.

These are excellent cookies. I made them exactly to the recipe and didn't get flat or super crunchy cookies like some other reviews said. I baked them 10 minutes at 375. The only thing is that if you leave them on the pan to cool for more than a minute after you pull them out of the oven, they will stick really bad to the pan. This is easily remedied by taking them off the hot pan almost immediately after you pull them out. I think I let mine sit for just a minute. My first pan stuck really bad and a couple cookies got mutilated. Maybe next time I'll use parchment paper, but I was all out of it today.

Very disappointed. I read all the reviews and I had even rejected other similar recioes in favor of this one. I followed one recommendation and added extra butter, one fourth cup. The flavor was fine but in the baking the cookie flattened a lot, ended up lace like. And even at eight minutes which I usually do my cookies at, the cookies crisped up a lot. I wanted a soft, chewy, chubby cookie.

Delicious!!!  I used old fashioned oats, 1c butterscotch chips and 2/3c white chocolate chips, cut the butter a tad, and baked on a baking stone.  I think I will try them with a little less sugar next time.  Perfectly bound together, lovely texture,  warm and satisfying flavor--a nice change from our usual chocolate chip variety.

Great taste, I love the butterscotch. Baking at 360 degrees works better though. When baking at 375 I found that the cookies burnt.

Overall good cookie, though not to my or my husband's personal liking.  I discovered I didn't have brown sugar after I began making the recipe but substituted with 1/2 c. white sugar and 1/4 c. dark corn syrup and the consistency was still lovely.  I also abhor an abundance of cookie sheets so I spread the entire batter to make bars, again it worked just fine.  I was guilty of overcooking them, but had I not done that I think they would have been moister.  Good recipe if you are a raving fan of butterscotch.

I would try another recipe before I make these again.  Must underbake to make sure they are not too crispy. Taste good but don't look very appealing.  Maybe too much butter in the recipe.

I grabbed this recipe the other day because my boyfriend LOVES butterscotch.  I saw a few reviews that had tweaked the recipe but I made it as is.  The cookies turned out AMAZING!  I use silicon baking sheets so I had no issues with sticking and the flavor is outstanding.  He's going to love them!  Thank you Jolene! :)

Great, basic butterscotch cookie, and very easy to make.  I used parchment paper and baked at 350 (well, really 325 in my convection oven) and they turned out great, no sticking problems.

Great tasting cookie! I would say they're a little sweet, but I love sweet.  I will try refrigerating the dough next time before scooping and baking as they did spread too much and weren't as visually appealing as I would have liked.  I may also try adding more butter as some have suggested. They are a great mixture of crispy and chewy though! Thanks for the recipe!

A few tips: I followed the recipe exactly (except I used I Can't Believe It's not Butter sticks). I mixed the brown and white sugar first. Make sure "butter" is softened so a knife goes right thru without resistance. thorughly mixing in sugar and later the oatmeal is key. I used a large serving spoon. The oatmeal must be well coated. Mine were perfect.  Chewy and a little crispy. Sooooo delicious!!!

This recipe was Cindy McCain's submitted in Family Circle magazine.  Not sure who copied whom.  The cookies are good, although very sweet.  I did as others and added extra cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg.  Baked at 350 for about 9 to 10 minutes.

Everyone ate at least two of these at a recent BBQ.  I added almost a full cup of butter, 1tsp cinnamon, a sprinkle of nutmeg and cooked at 350.  They look like they are not cooked all the way after about 9 min. But take them out...they ARE done

My husband and kids were a little ho-hum when I told them what I was baking, but after they took the first bite, it was as if a tornado hit the entire batch. This is a keeper.

This is a great recipe. I was looking for a recipe to use some butterscotch chips that I had. I followed some suggestions made by others. I cooked these at 350 instead of 375 and for 9min. they turned out perfect. I also added 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips. My husband who doesn't really like cookies had 4 before bed. thanks for the recipe, I will use this again.

These cookies are really sweet.  Next time, I intend to decrease the sugar by 1/4 each and decrease the flour to 1 cup only.  I also used 1 stick of butter and 1/4 cup of veg. shortening to help the cookies stay extra soft.

These were pretty good. Everyone that tried them told me how excellent they were, and my husband especially loved them! I'm not too big on oatmeal cookies, that's the only reason these don't get a 5.

Very easy to make. It's the traditional butterscotch oatmeal cookie recipe - can't go wrong with these cookies! I always bake my cookies at about 365 degrees instead of 375 - I find that temp. too high. Thanks for the recipe!

These were ok. I only had quick oats so I don't know if that changed the texture at all. They were way too sweet so I added some chocolate chips and that helped a little. I probably won't make these again.

These were pretty good cookies but I am really glad that I cut back on the sugar to 1/2 a cup of each because otherwise they would have been really sweet. I used whole wheat flour (added 1/2 a cup more than the recipe called for) and greased the cookie sheet - I had no problems with them being flat or sticking to the pan.

These are yummy! They taste almost like they had marshmellows in them.

I used trans-fat free butter flavoured shortening, 3/4 C unbleached all-purpose and 1/2 cup whole wheat for flour, 1 1/4 C white sugar and 1/4 C molasses, organic quick oats, 2 C butterscotch chips, shaped with a tablespoon and baked 12 at a time at 350 for 12 minutes. I omitted the salt (there was some in the shortening) and they turned out great.

Crispy on the edges, soft in the middle, my baby and I thank you!

I followed the recipe to the letter, but for some reason, they turned out crumbly and I had trouble removing them from the pan. They were much easier to handle after letting them cool. Yummy; I will try the recipe again, it's worth it to get the right consistency.  Thanks Jolene

These were good, but I thought the flavor of the chips kind of overpowered the flavor of the cookies. I'll make these agai, next time just reducing the amount of the chips a bit.

I have been impressed by just about every recipe I have ever tried from this website. Well.. I was barely satisfied... let alone impressed.  These cookies weren't bad, they just weren't good. I made sure to rate this recipe after I had  a chance to taste them again the next day (since a few reviews had said they were a lot more flavorful on the second day).  Still .. blah.  I won't be making these again.

Pretty good cookies. After reading the reviews that cookie tended to spread and become too thin, I added 1/2C extra flour to the mixture and these came out perfect!

These cookies are incredible! They turned out perfectly. I followed the recipe exactly (except for the chips). I also baked them on a stone, and had no problem with them sticking. The only thing I changed is the amount of butterscotch chips. I used about 1 1/4 cups instead of 1 2/3 cups. I think butterscotch chips are a little too sweet. But, my family just raved about the cookies. I definitely will be making them again!

These are quite good.  I was tempted to add the whole bag of chips, but I'm glad I didn't...they would have been too sweet.  I cooked them on a parchment-lined sheet, so there were no problems with them sticking.  Also, allow them to rest a few minutes after coming out of the oven before transfering them to the cooling rack.  9 1/2 minutes seemed to be perfect.  They end up crispy on the outside and still soft on the inside.  Recipe doubles well.

They tasted ok. I tried to make them with a greased sheet and a ungreased sheet. Either way they turned out the same. The cookies still stuck to the the bottom of the sheet. I Substituted nutmeg for cinnamon. I still was not impressed.

I am not a big butterscotch fan but these cookies were great.  I made this batch for a friend who loves them but I ate more than a few myself.  I think the oats balance the over-sweet butterscotch flavor.

A few years ago I dug a very similar cookie recipe out of the back of my mom's recipe box (the only differences are using 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of butter and greasing the cookie sheet), and just a couple days ago I decided to make these for some friends who came over for dinner. They were a *huge* hit, and everyone asked for the recipe. These cookies are very simple to make, and the dough refrigerates well, too. The batch I made only made about 36 cookies, though. Still, worth making again!

I've made this recipe 3-4 times now, and each time the cookies turn out perfectly!  They are a hit everywhere I take them, and my hubby LOVES them.  Easy and yummy.  I haven't varied the recipe a bit -- wonderful every time!!!

Pretty good cookies!  I underbaked them so they stayed soft.  They spread out a little more than I like, though.

My husbands favorite cookies are oatmeal butterscotch.  His favorite for the past 25 years have been his moms.  I decided to try a new recipe and he LOVED them!  He said they were better than any he'd ever had.  I also greased the cookie sheet, doubled the serving size, and baked for 9 minutes.  Thanks!

These cookies sure don't look pretty, but they are awesome! You might think they are burnt and too hard to eat but they are surprisingly chewy. Awesome recipe!

These got a bit hard/crunchy for my taste after they cooled down.  Still, they were a hit with the office.  I wasn't fond of the butterscotch chips - make sure you find them tasty before embarking on this recipe :)

Excellent cookies! I love this recipe. You can use it as a base and add any chips and nuts you like.
I make them without eggs using egg replacer and they still turn out fantastic.

Yummy cookie!  I used 2 cups of butterscotch chips (to finish off the package) and 1 cup of chopped pecans (because my husband loves pecans) and they turned out great.

These were very easy to make but even with the pan greased the chips stuck.  I found them very sweet but the rest of the family ate them down.

Easy unpretentious recipe that makes enough for a good size party or reunion.  

Easily dressed up by dipping the tines of a fork into melted white chocolate and quick-draping rows on cooled cookies.

Not the prettiest cookie but wow do they taste good!
Baked at 350 instead of 375. Be careful not to make them too big or they won't bake properly.

Very disappointed.  Especially with all the 4 and 5 star reviews. If you have to add more butter or flour, chill the dough or otherwise tweak the original recipe you shouldn’t be giving it 5 stars.  Having said that, these were a total disaster.  Intended to serve these for Christmas Eve tomorrow but now have to come up with something else.

These were a big hit! I made a batch per the recipe and they were incredible. Then I made another batch with raisins instead of butterscotch. It was so easy to swap out and the cookies all came out nice and chewy!

Excellent cookie. From time to time- I add orange zest or flavoring to the ingredients. I vaguely remember orange extract instead of vanilla extract was the original flavoring. And I think it pairs PERFECTLY with the butterscotch cchips. Try it-

These were a huge hit!!! I made a few changes that led me to a really yummy cookie: I used bread flour instead of AP, used 1 c. butter, and added a little more cinnamon than suggested (probably closer to 1 tsp.). Definitely adding these to my repertoire!

Ok- I messed up the recipe but it ended up being for the best!  I added 1/2 cup each of brown, regular and powdered sugar. I accidentally added the powdered sugar and wasn’t sure how it was going to turn out. I ended up adding 2 cups of flour and a teaspoon of cinnamon and 2 cups of butter. I did up cooking one batch thinking I may have to redo the entire batch. They turned out fantastic and soft. No refrigeration needed.  I would definitely make again

I made these gluten free and they were some of the best cookies! They were much thicker than regular flour and where super soft. I used gluten free quick oats, coconut flour and xantham gum. Will definitely be making these again!

Make these exactly how the recipe is written and they were excellent!  I did bake at 350 only because I had banana bread in the oven already. I tried to take some off the pan while they were hot and they did fall apart a little. They were perfect after cooling for a few minutes

Worked like a charm in my Kitchen Aid. A complete success at work and at home. I used only one cup of butterscotch because it’s all I had and felt like it was a perfect touch of butterscotch flavor.

I made it as written, except for the baking temp. I baked at 350 degrees for 10 minutes, and they're delish - also super crispy, but I like that. To get them off of the cookie sheet, I had to bake on parchment, otherwise they required a presidential pardon to leave their baking sheet behind.

Wasnt exactly what I was looking for  it still really good! I would agree on recommending putting it in the fridge before baking. I'd go closer to the 2 hours in there.

I added half a box of vanilla pudding mix along with the dry ingredients which adds more flavor and makes the cookies stay really chewy. Sometimes I add 2/3 cup of chocolate chips to a batch to change them up a little bit, which my kids love!

These were a huge success with my boyfriend and his football team! One think I did was substitute in ? cup of emu sweet chocolate chips instead of 100% butterscotch. I refrigerated the dough which helped my cookies not flatten. I suggest watching the cookies for the last 2 mins because each of my batches cooked differently. Also, to know when done look at the bottom corner of the cookies and when they begin to turn brown they’re close to being done! Don’t wait for them to “get golden”... it’s all about the edges to get the perfect and chewy cookie

I had trouble with them spreading flat when I took the first batch out of the oven.  I added about a 1/2 cup of flour  the rest of the batter and the rest came out fine.  Very tasty....my kids are devouring them!  Great cookies!

I left off a star because I modified the recipe a teeny bit. I used 1 cup of butter and a teaspoon more flour,  the only changes I made. These are delicious! My last pan is in the oven now. I've 'taste tested' a couple and they're wonderful. I did a combination of spoon-drop and rolling 1" inch balls and both worked well. Baked at 375. I'm using two sizes/types cookie sheet, one's the dark, heavy kind, the other smaller and lighter so varied the bake times.  And I chilled the dough too. Thanks for the recipe!

I don't like butterscotch, but  I had some butterscotch chips and decided to make them for a cookie swap.  I took suggestions from the reviews and decreased the sugar, increased the butter to 1 cup, and doubled the cinnamon.  They tasted ok, but a little on the sweet side because of too many butterscotch chips.

Turned out great and added 1/2 cup toasted pecans. Baked at 350 for about 11 min. And then let sit on the cookie sheet an additional 5. Know your oven!  Moist and chewy with crunch from the pecans. Definitely a keeper and a repeater!

Since I was a kid, these are one of my very favorite cookies.  
~ Change baking temp to 350
~ Use one cup of butter
~ ADD 1/2 tsp orange extract.  
I know, it sounds odd, but somewhere in the past, my Mom's original recipe from the 1970's called for orange extract, and they are just not as good without it!

Outstanding cookies!  I have been baking for many (MANY!) decades.  I have been looking for a 'chip' recipe that uses butter.  I almost always put oatmeal in my cookies, and usually use semi-sweet and butterscotch chips combined.  

I tried these with just a couple of tweaks based on comments.  I used 1 c. (2 sticks) of butter, and increased the flour to 1 1/2 c.  Cookies came off the sheet perfectly (let cool 6 minutes before removing to rack) and held their shape perfectly.  

They are moist and chewy and perfect.  I left them out, uncovered on counter to see how they were on day #2 and they had not changed at all.  Hurray!!

I recommend Guittard's Butterscotch chips for incredible flavor.  Head and shoulders above Nestle's and store brands.  Made 3 dozen nice-sized cookies using my medium scoop.  Neighbors and SIL raved.

I made this exactly as written and I loved it. To get them off the tray easier I used Pam on the tray before each set of cookies, and gave them about 30 seconds to 1 min before taking them off the sheet. Worked perfect!! Will make them again!!

Great recipe! Made as directed 14 years ago, which deserved 5 stars as is but over the years I've modified slightly....  I add dried cranberries and chocolate chips (sometimes dark chocolate, sometimes white). With white chocolate, they turn out almost too sweet so I cut back a little on the sugar.

These were tasty little buggers, I did cut back on the butterscotch chips a little bit I find the flavour can become over powering very quickly. Added a bit more vanilla because... Why not?! 
Wil be making them again :)

I made this verbatim and just loved the taste. Out of the oven, it was crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. After one day, the cookies got more chewy, so if people like a crispy texture, they may want to bake it longer. I shared this with a group of 7 women, and everyone loved it. This was a hit indeed!

I did as some other reviewers suggested.. Increased butter to full cup, added some flour, chilled the dough, and lowered the temp to 350.. These cookies came out glorious. I am huge butterscotch fan and my youngest son begged me to make these... Glad I did.  Would give thanks to recipe author, however this recipe is straight off of the Nestle butterscotch morsels bag and it's been republished.  I give credit where credit is due.

Perfection!  I followed another reviewers tip to up the butter to one cup instead of 3/4 and let them completely cool before removing from the cookie sheet and they held together beautifully.  They are heavenly.

This recipe was super easy and family loved the cookies. I will definitely make again and as others suggested, increase butter a tad. I did bake them on parchment so there was zero problems with them sticking. Dough is a little crumbly but the extra butter next time should resolve that issue. Thanks Jolene!

Delicious! My batter was sticky but not out of control.  I baked mine for 7 minutes at 375 degrees. I also let mine sit on the pan to cool before moving. For me this recipe was great as is.

Nice flavor.  This is the recipe on the Nestle bag except that recipe uses a full cup of butter.  I chose to do that as well and thought they might be better with a bit less, so next time I'll try the 3/4 cup.  You can just dump the entire bag of butterscotch chips in.

Thank you so much for the delicious cookie recipe!

Yummy, and not too sweet. It has a good texture.  Others have suggested changes, but I stuck with the recipe.  They did not spread out too much for me and are some lovely thick good cookies.

3 1/2 stars....I substituted peanut butter chips in place of butterscotch. They had a powdery after taste. But I also didn't have access to a hand mixer, had to use a whisk. On a  good note my brother and dad loved them.

The only change I made was also using 1 cup of butter and added a tad more flour to compensate.  I had no issues with it being runny or falling apart.  I cooked mine for 9 minutes at 350 and let them sit for another 3-4 minutes on the pan and they were perfect!  Great recipe! Definitely a keeper!

Plowed through 2 dozen of these within 10 minutes between the 6 of us. They may replace chocolate chip cookies. I did not cook the full time, I don't like crunchy cookies. Another reviewer said it's the same as on the bag, lol, which I find funny. I didn't even look. Whatever, good cookies! Sometimes you don't need to reinvent the wheel.

I reduced the temp to 350, they cooked in 10 min. I did not add more butter as previous commentators recommended. I added both butterscotch and chocolate chips. The cookies came out nice. The recipe worked well.

These were the best cookies I've ever made. They had the perfect texture and butterscotch-y taste I was looking for when I bought my butterscotch chips. They definitely don't make 4 dozen, though. I used rounded teaspoons and ended up with around 8 dozen cookies total.

Great cookie. My husband and I love butterscoitch and I love oatmeal cookies so it was a perfect combination. Only thing I changed was cooked at 350 andused a whole cup of butter as well as greased the pan a little with som pam. I did find that when I used a cookie scooper for the first batch the edges browned while the center was still a little runny so I flattened them down a little for the next 2 batches and they were perfect. Will definitely be making these again. I think I will use this same recipe for oatmmeal raisin cookies instead of butterscitch for a change when we feel like oatmeal raisin cookies. These were soft and fluffy and absolutely delicious.

Very taste, but cut the white sugar out completely and you won't miss it. Also, I used half whole wheat flour instead of all white and it was great. I also only used 1 full cup of the butterscotch chips, which turned out to be more than enough. Yummy!!!

Like most other reviewers, I also baked at 350F for 9 minutes.  They turned out perfectly.

Perfect cookies--exactly what I was looking for. These were SOOOO good! Even my anti-oatmeal and anti-butterscotch teens were gobbling them up! :) I had to adjust the measurements since I only had 1 cup of butterscotch chips, but they still turned out plump, soft and chewy. I took other reviewers recommendations and lowered the temperature to 350 degrees & chilled the dough for 10-15 minutes for the butter to firm back up a bit. My cookies were perfect at 350 degrees for 9 minutes, although all ovens vary--watch them closely and don't let them get too golden or they'll over bake. As soon as the edges are golden and the tops are set, pull them out and let them cool. I also used parchment paper and had no issues at all with sticking. If you love oatmeal and butterscotch, this recipe will tickle your sweet tooth for sure!

I'm not a cookie lover, however my girlfriend is. This is her favorite. After removing them from the oven and allowing them to cool a bit.. I gave her one.. all I could hear was her moaning and remarking about how good they were. She did say that this recipe was a bit on the sweet side compared to others. On my next batch I think I will use a bit less sugar.  Based on her reaction I'm giving this 5 stars! Great recipe!!

This is the Nestle recipe except they now call for 1c. of butter. I always use the full cups (and I love butter) and get soft chewy, delicious cookies. I usually only bake half the batch and eat the dough right out of the refrigerator!

I LOVE THESE COOKIES! I followed the recipe but took Naples suggestions to up the butter to 1 cup and to let the dough slightly harden. Plus I lowered the temp to 350 cooked for about 10-13 min. Depending on how large my cookies were. I had perfect fluffy moist delicious cookies in the end!

I made this using 9 T margarine and 3 T shortening. Also, 1 c chips was plenty. These alterations made nice slightly rounded cookies that did not spread like crazy. Because I altered it I gave it a 4.

I should have read more of the reviews before making.  I followed the recipe as is and got very thin cookies that I had to almost overbake in order to remove them from the baking sheet.  Taste ok but very disappointed overall.  Next time I would add more butter and flour as suggested, but I don't think they'll be a next time for this recipe.  Surely I can find one that works well without having to read several additional reviews to get it right.

AMAZING oatmeal cookie. WOW. I cut the recipe in half to make 24 cookies. Like other reviewers said, I added a little bit of extra butter ( 1 extra tablespoon for half the cookies so 2 tablespoons for the whole batch of 48). I also added 3/4 of a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I love to add a little bit of extra vanilla to my cookies - they always come out better. Also put them in the oven at 350 degrees for 8 1/2 minutes. They came out beautifully! Also, I always make sure to stack my cookies up high before I put them into the oven. That way, even when they flatten out, they are still puffy and fluffy! Last thing - next time I will omit the butterscotch - maybe peanut butter chips instead, but probably just nothing at all.

I tried this recipe tonight and it was GREAT!  I had two variations from the recipe:  I used 1 cup of butter and 3 cups of quick oats.  I baked them for 9 minutes.  I had one cookie sheet that is a darker metal and they need less baking time on that sheet.  Dough held together well and as of right now, I've eaten too many!

These were pretty good cookies, basicly a oatmeal cookie recipe with butterscotch chips. The cookies were not a chewy as i would have liked i will decrease the cook time by a minute or two next time.

Easy to make, I agree with the 1/2 cup of butter versus the 3/4th's as I don't like crispy cookies. I added caramel bits to compliment the butterscotch & WOW that was a good decision!

Made some last night- they we're ok. I have a sweet tooth, and these are, dare I say it, too sweet. A bit on the greasy side for my taste too. I may have made them too large too cook properly- mine are about 2x the size shown in the picture.

I made these cookies just as the recipe said, and they turned out terrible. The dough tasted really good, but the cookies were so flat the pan was showing through and the cookies were so stuck to the pan I was literally prying them off. I was very disappointed with this. I will not be making these cookies again.

Great taste, cookies will be FLAT, not thick, no matter what. Significant flour vs oats ratio needed. Also, took 8 minutes to cook for me, no idea why. Not making ever again.

These cookies are fantastic.  I baked them for 10 minutes at 350 and they came out chewy and perfect, that was the only change I made to the recipe.  I found them very sweet though, and  the recipe made more cookies than I expected.  Worth making for sure, and I would definitely make again over the holidays.

Great Recipe. I also added more butter and because of the comments on the sweetness reduced the butterscotch chips slightly and reduced the heat to 350. I chilled for 10 minutes before baking and sprayed cooking sheet. These tips made the cookies turn out perfect. Plan on sending a batch to my son!

These cookies were good. Chewy with a touch of sweetness from the butterscotch chips. Unfortunately, the boyfriend isn't a big fan of oats, so I ended up bringing them to work. They were almost all gobbled up by the end of the day and I couldn't stop snacking on them either.

I had a really hard time not just grabbing the bowl of cookie dough and eating with a spoon. Turns out the cookies were really good when they were baked too! However, I did follow a couple of the other reviews - extra 1/4 of butter, extra 1/2 cup of flour and reduce temp to 350 F

I was looking for a recipe without raisin for my daughter inlaw and I was a little worried. I put a whole stick of butter flavor crisco baking sticks and an extra 1 teaspoon of vanlla extract. They are great!! I usually don't eat cookies when I bake, but these I have ate 4 of them. I give them a 10!!!! I hand rolled 1/2 of the dough by the teaspoon and dropped the rest. The hand rolled stayed together better.

Really good! The original recipe was a little too sweet for me, so I cut the sugar amount in half (3/4 cup total) and only put a cup of butterscotch chips in. They turned out very delicious!

Great recipe! Upped the butter to 1 cup based on other reviewers comments. Baked (not cooked) at 375 for 13 minutes on un-greased stoneware pans. Came out perfectly...lightly browned and crisp on the edges, soft and chewy in the middle.  A tip for those that found they stuck to the cookie sheet...only allow them to cool for 3-5 min before transferring to cooling racks. That will allow them to firm up slightly without getting stuck. Thanks Jolene! This one's a keeper!

I tried this as written the first time, The cookies were hard to work with and ended up kind-of crumbly and dry. So a few days later I tried this again using the other people's recommendations. I used 1 stick of butter and also did lightly spray the cookie sheets with pam for baking and also i let the dough sit in the fridge for 5 minutes. Since my gas oven tends to bake a little hot i baked them at 350 degrees for 10 minutes. They turned out perfectly!!! I don't know if giving the recipe 4 stars instead of 5 is very nice, but the cookies didn't turn out well until I re-tried them with the recommendations from others who posted. thank you !

Delicious and oh so easy.  I made the batter last night in about 5-10 minutes.  I did add about 1/4 cup more flour simply b/c I like my cookies to be fluffy and not flat.  But either way very good cookie

These taste incredible! I used 1 cup butter and added about 1/2 cup flour and they came out pretty nicely. I need to play around with the proportions more to get them more full.

this was a bit too sweet for me.  It made me wish i was eating oatmeal raisin.  but as for my fiance and sister - they couldn't get enough (they have a bigger sweet tooth than cookie monster lol)  I followed alot of suggestions on this site and they came out soft and i removed them ok, but i was nervous about them sticking so i used wax paper and cooking spray and maybe thats why my kitchend looked like a jimi hendrix concert!!! so much smoke!!!  Thats probably why the other reviewer who said theirs smoked too did.  they did the same thing.

The recipe was on the bag of Nestle chips I was using EXCEPT that it called for 1 cup of butter and 375*.  I used those changes, lined my pans with parchment paper and baked delicious cookies.  We took tham out of the oven after 8 minutes to be sure they were nice and chewy.

These cookies are wonderful!  I added raisins, a little honey, and cocoa powder.  I reduced the temperature to 350 which made the cookies crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  For the oats, I used a combination of original instant oatmeal and flavored (apples and spice) which gave it a GREAT extra kick.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe, my whole family enjoyed every crumb and asking for more.

Delicious.  I did use 1/4 c butter & 1/2 c crisco, and 1/2 c white sugar, 1 c brown sugar.  Also refrigerated overnight because it was a hot and humid day when I mixed up the batter.  Don't know what difference my modifications made, but they turned out great!

Perfection as is.  I just made some and I have been eating them fresh out of the oven as as they cool down to a crispy golden outside, and soft and moist inside.    I added about 2 Tablepoons of Flour because I wanted to make them without refrigerating the dough first, but it wasn't necesary.  Try them as is.  They are very sweet, but also amazing.  And perfect with milk.

Excellent! These were awesome! One of the best cookies I have ever had in my life! Maybe they could've been a tincy bit less sweet? But that besides, these were great, and got snapped up. (people were grabbing four at a time and walking away with them)

Delicious! not a huge butterscotch cookie fan but these are great. I used some of the suggestions. 1 cup of butter, lowered temp to 350 and chilled dough for about 10 minutes. I had to bake mine for 10 minutes because they were to raw. Will definitely make these again.

Good cookies!  I wasn't sure how the butterscotch would come out.  I too dropped the temp to 350, and baked for 9-10 mins.  I also only used 2 cups of oats and they came out delicious!

INCREDIBLE.  Don't over bake.  Bake until 1/2 to 3/4 of a inch on the sides are brown.  Middle will still look slightly underdone.  Leave on cookie sheet for 5 minutes after you pull out of the oven.  YUM!

I had baked another recipe prior to this one so I mistakenly baked this recipe at 325 degrees for 10 minutes and they came out great. I also accidentally overbaked one sheet of cookies and my mom loved the crunchy version!  I added 1 cup of pecans to my version (everyone loved the cookies!) however, for my next batch, I'm going to use 1 cup butterscotch chips and 2/3 cup milk chocolate chips plus the 1 cup chopped pecans.  I can't wait!

Used some suggestions from the reviews and upped the butter to 1 cup. Refrigerated the dough and formed into balls before baking. I found these cookies overly sweet, and will reduce the sugar if I make them again. The rest of my family liked them, though. Thanks!

The ideal cookie--a little chewy, crisp and buttery around the edges, and packed with yummy flavor. Yes, these are very sweet cookies, primarily because butterscotch chips are super sweet.   Taking the advice of some other reviewers, I added a few extra tablespoons of butter to the recipe. I also chilled the dough for 3-4 hours before I scooped them onto sheets and baked. This was primarily because I was serving them warm for a dessert after dinner but I do think that helped them not spread so much, as these sorts of cookies have for me before.   I wasn't sure about the cinnamon before baking--I wasn't sure if they'd overwhelm the cookie but they add the perfect dimension to the cookie. I would leave it in again for sure.  As far as baking time went, for me it was around 10 minutes. I wanted them lightly browned on the edges and not too terribly pale on top. Use your instinct or do a test batch on just a few if you're not sure. Times are so relative depending on your own oven and size of cookie.   My guests raved--they're addictive!

I added extra cinnamon and also put half butterscotch chips and half chooclate chips. They were really good cookies! Next time i would underbake them a little more because they were a bit too crunchy for my liking. Overall though, very tasty!

The only thing I did differently was with the oatmeal.  I used 1 1/2 cups quick oats and 1 1/2 cups old fashoned oats.  It worked great and my cookies didn't have the flat problem.

My fiancee and I really liked these, but I was a little disappointed with the outcome. They got pretty brown on the outside of the cookie, but it seemed pretty raw in the middle, so the edges were pretty burnt by the time I brought them out, even though I baked them for eight minutes as suggested. For that reason, I'll probably cook them a little cooler next time . It was still okay, though. We'll be making them again!

Yum Yum Yum. Simple, quick and tasty. I lowered the cooking temp to 350 like the others suggested, because I like soft and chewy cookies, with crispy edges. I cooked them for 11-12 minutes and they were HEAVENLY!

These cookies tasted very good...they were moist and had a perfect taste...but they didn't hold together well.  The only thing that I changed was with the brown sugar/white sugar.  I didn't have enough of brown sugar, so I added a little bit more white and added a tbsp. of molasses (that is all that brown sugar is anyhow).  I have had this problem before with oatmeal cookies, though.

This was a great recipe.  I did make a few variations in that I used 2 sticks of “I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter” and I was unsure about adding the cinnamon so I didn’t.  The chewy oatmeal and then a bite of butterscotch here and there.  Oh, these cookies were delicious!  (FYI:  I baked mine for 9 minutes - don't overcook or they will be hard after they cool.)

This is pretty much the same recipe on the Butterscotch Morsels bag.  The cookies came out delicious; my husband and I couldn't stop eating them.  He doesn't like oatmeal cookies but he loved these.  I followed others' tip and baked at 350 for 9 minutes for a soft cookie.

I dont know what happened, I consider myself a pretty good baker, I did everything the other recipes said to do, and I am baffled. both of my ovens smoked really bad making every batch of cookies. They tasted good but were hard to get off cookie sheet even using wax paper and cooking spray... not very happy

I followed the recipe exactly and while they didn't look like the picture, they turned out fine-not flat, didn't stick or crumble.  I'm not a fan of butterscotch, but I've made them at a friend's request.  I'll find out tomorrow how they really turned out!  :)

These cookies were great! I made a few changes: skipped the white sugar, doubled the vanilla, and used a fat free butter spread--and they were still delicious! I was looking for a crispy cookie, and this was it! Thanks!

After reading the reviews, I thought I would take the recipe at face value and see for my self. Well, the flavor is good. But they should be called crisps instead of cookies. After the first batch that I had to scrape off of the pan, I tried a little Pam on the baking sheet. They still came out flat & crispy. I tried refridgerating the dough but that didn't change anything. Like I said, they're good tasting just not a soft/chewy cookie like we'd prefer.

MY FAVORITE COOKIE none the less and i'm a cookie lovin fool!

When my husband tasted these cookies he asked, "How many did you make?"  I paused to think and he said, "The correct answer is not enough!"  I thought these were very good as well, a little on the sweet side but next time I will just sneak in a little less sugar and see if hubby notices.  Great recipe.

Very good. They didn't taste like the ones I tried that made me want to make them so badly. Kind of dry/flat-I'm not much of a baker so I don't know how to change that.  I added the 1/2 c. extra flour as someone recommended but something seemed off.

I used crumbled Heath Bars (R) instead of chips.  Delicious!  they were very thin, which was fine - shortning instead of butter would probably give them a thicker heft.

Mmmm....these cookies are so yummy and were really popular with my co-workers.  I did make a few changes though:  increased the vanilla to 2 tsp., only used 1/2 c butter and compensated with applesauce, and added 1 cup of shredded coconut, which helped to keep the cookies extra moist.

This recipe kind of sucked for me. Every cookie was either too thin, burnt on the bottom, or had dark brown blotches on them. Why????? My guess would be that the butter was semi-melted; but this never has been a problem with previous cookies. They are still being eaten super fast so that's good. I don't think I'd care to add more flour as suggested..This recipe should not be five stars if everybody changed the amount!! That totally screwed me. Thanks, though.

Great Recipe. I used Pampered Chef Stoneware and had no problems with sticking. I did let the cookies sit on stone for 8 minutes or so before moving to a rack. Very nice flavor.

I thought the recipe turned out really well.  I altered the recipe slightly after reading some of the suggestions.  I only put in half a bag of butterscotch chips - I think the whole bag would have been too sweet.  I also used parchment paper.  It was easy clean up and the cookies didn't stick to the paper - this was a common complaint with many of the reviews. I'll make this recipe again for sure!

These didn't come out very pretty for me. they were VERY flat and unattractive. They didn't taste too bad, though.

These cookies were GREAT!  I'm a terrible cookie baker, but these came out perfect.  I did substitute some of the butter with a little bit of butter flavored crisco.  Even with the substitution they were still wonderful.

These are very good.  They were a little difficult to get off the cookie sheet and onto the cooling rack.  I had to cook them longer than it said, and then they were more crispy than I like in a cookie.  Great flavor though, and if you prefer a sweet, and crispy cookie,this is the one for you.

This got great reviews at the 4th of July party we went to. I made these into cookie bars instead of cookies to make them easier! I also added chocolate chips to this recipe and used slightly less butterscotch chips. Really good!!!! Will make again and again

This recipe was really tastey, and I will definitely make them again. However, I wasn't sure whether to use quick or old fashioned oats because it wasn't clear in the recipe. I ended up using quick oats, and it came out very well.

This cookie is just delicious!!!! Nice and chewy. My kids love them and can't even wait until they have cooled off before digging in. I like that they contain oatmeal to make a more filling and healthy cookie.
Excellent submission Jolene!

This cookie was very sweet, and butterscotch chips taste kind of fake to me, but if you like that flavor, this is a consistent recipe that turns out well. I also cut the amount of chips by 25%.

These cookies were delicious, my husband loved them.  I reduced the amount of butterscotch chips by 1/2 after the sweetness of the first batch.  I used an ungreased cookie sheet and they came off with ease.

This is the first time I've ever made oatmeal cookies. These things are amazing and addictive. I had no problem with them sticking. I used parchment paper. It's definitely worth the few bucks to get the paper and avoid the sticky cleanup or the cooking spray mess.

These cookies are wonderful!  The only problem i had was getting them off the cookie sheet.  I did try to spray the next batch's sheet, but still no luck.  Great even though they didn't look pretty.

When you bake these, make sure you take them out of the oven before they look done otherwise they do not turn out well. Almost tastes like cinnamon rolls. Thanks for sharing.

These cookies really are fantastic.  My husband gobbled them up and he is NOT a butterscotch fan.  I also added 1 cup of largly chopped pecans and it really gave the cookies great flavor.  I think next time I would reduce the sugar a little since the butterscotch chips are so sweet.

I just made a batch of these cookies and they came out perfect - no problems.  I added a cup of coconut to mine.  Thanks, Jolene, these are great!

Great cookies!  Easy to make.  I ended up with almost eight dozen instead of four dozen, but that's okay.  I shared some with the neighbors!
