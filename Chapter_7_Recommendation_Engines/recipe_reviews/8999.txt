Val, how do I thank you.  My Jewish husband asked me to make chopped liver when we were planning to entertain some of our Jewish friends.  I had never made any kind of liver, so I didn't even know where to begin.  I found your recipe and followed it to the letter, even down to the Hungarian Paprika (which was wonderful).  Everyone raved about the chopped liver, and there was not a drop left.  I was worried when I saw the first person reach for the liver, but when she commented that it was wonderful, everyone stood at the dish, eating until it was gone.  Thank You Val, for a wonderful recipe.

I made this for my in-laws on Mother’s Day and it was a hit. The only thing I changed, to make this recipe more traditional, was I use chicken fat instead of oleo. My in-laws couldn’t get enough. It’s a little time consuming but worth every minute. I will definitely be making this again. My husband said, “It’s the best he’s ever had”!

5 stars isn't enough! I made this for an appetizer and served with small pita breads and thinly sliced pumpernickel bread. I did omit the additional white onion and parsley in the mixture.
My husband saw it in the fridge before the company got here and had a sandwich prior to dinner! He ate so much chicken liver that night, I thought he was going to grow feathers! Keeper? Definatly....and thanks!

This turned out very good.  I may have over salted it a bit, but I rectified that by adding about a quarter cup of white wine.  This made it really good and helped the consistency as well.  Don't rate this recipe until you've tried it chilled, the flavor really comes together.  Everyone I shared it with loved it! It was very easy to make.

For this recipe to be KOSHER the butter should be substituted. Butter and all dairy products are not to be cooked with meat.

Excellent! I have been looking for a recipe to make like my mothers. This was great and simple. I used a little less paprika and I like less raw onion. Other than that, this was wonderful.

This was very good.  I made the full version as written, And the instructions are great and it came out yummy. My mother-in-law makes a simpler version with only butter, onion, chicken livers, eggs, paprika and salt/pepper.

Very good. A couple of tips, soak your chicken livers in milk anywhere from 2 hours to overnight, it makes the flavor creamier and more delicate. I made this into a pate and i used a food processor, it is just easier. This recipes makes MUCH more than for 6 people, more like a small army of 30.I gave it away to neighbors and we still have a ton left.

I don't know what I did wrong - I followed the recipe to the letter - but this was just horrible. I'm a big fan of chicken liver, but this tasted terrible. Sorry.

I was a little disappointed, after reading such rave reviews.  I followed the instructions (though I used regular paprika), and it got lukewarm comments at best.  While it was ok, it wasn't outstanding as I thought it would be.  I think the recipe serves far more than 8, and while I thought it would have been devoured at last night's dinner, I'm left with nearly the entire bowl this morning.

I made both this recipe (Val's Hungarian Jewish Chopped Liver) and Grandma's Chopped Liver for a gathering of six friends, including 3 chopped-liver lovers, 2 who'd never had it, and one who grew up with it but does NOT like it. Everyone was required to taste it, and I took a vote on who liked which one the best. All 6 people declared both recipes delicious, but two people voted this one their favorite.

I didn't have Hungarian paprika in the house, so I used 1 T of plain paprika. Next time, I will try Hungarian just to taste the difference. I was hesitant about adding the parsley. I was worried that it might overpower the other flavors, but I was wrong. It blended nicely in the background. I might try sauteing celery with the onion next time just to add another layer of flavor. 

This is definitely a great recipe, and I'll be making it again when I have friends over. However, Grandmas Chopped Liver is my favorite recipe. But I would gladly eat both--and lots of 'em.

This was great. Fairly easy and Well Cheap to make. I ended up with a ton of Chopped Liver which is fine because so many people wanted to take some home. I added 1/2 stick of Butter mashed in with the livers. It was definitely better the next day after it had time to for the flavours to meld. I will make this again. I wish my Mommo was alive she would have gone nuts for this.

This is truly a most wonderful chopped liver recipe altho I must admit that I do like mine without lumps so I use my food processor. I also enjoy adding a bit of garlic and some cognac. Thank you Valerie!

This was a very good appetizer for my guests. I don't eat liver myself but I was convinced to give it a little taste. I'm still not a liver fan but if I "had" to eat it this would be the only way I would take it.

With out question, this is the chopped liver I had in PA when I was a kid!  Rich and flavorful.    I made this then went to the store for sandwhich fixens and a roast to make Beef Wellington with it tonite and good deli sandwiches for the week.    It can be used as a Pate' it is so good.  I like it a little more minced that the author but it's good either way.    It makes a lot so plan on using it in more reciepts or having freinds over!   Also, if you have pets, they will tackel you to get at it.  The smell is that wonderful.

"Val's Hungarian Jewish Chopped Liver" has a delicious strong paprika flavor (no unpleasant "liverish" flavor). I did not like the lumpy texture, so I processed mine to make it smooth in my food processor. I would not hesitate to make this recipe again, although I will be inclined to change it up a little bit according to my own personal taste. Thanks Valerie Alia for sharing your recipe.

Really close to the one I grew up on, I just have to figure out what was different.... I think my mom used to put a little mayo in it as well.  I really enjoyed it. Thanks from one Val to another. :) This was delicious!!

I was trying to find a recipe to duplicate the chopped liver we used to buy when we lived in South Florida.  This was right on target.  It was a little dry and my husband insisted that the store bought stuff was a little "sweet" so we added about two tablespoons of sweet gherkin brine.  Once the livers were cooked and sorted out we put it all in a food processer but be careful not to make mush.  Also, I forgot the paprika (but mine was so old it probably had no flavor anyway).  A keeper.

this recipe is outstanding exactly as written, Like other reviewers I found the result a little dry... that being said, the second time through I made the following modifications. 1. as a single person the recipe makes too much for me to eat in a week. So I used 400g of liver and one cup of chopped onion, 4 chopped cloves of garlic for the first step. When my livers where mostly done I added 1 tablespoon of white vinegar, 1/2 tablespoon of tomato paste in 1/2 cup of water to the pan with about a teaspoon of grey salt and let simmer for a couple of minutes until the liver was barely pink in the middle. (if you don't live in Saudi Arabia you could use 1/2 cup of white wine.)  I removed the contents of the pan to a large bowl and let it cook while 2. I separated the cooked egg yokes from the whites - mashed the yokes with a fork and chopped the whites very fine. 3. mashed the livers with a potato masher until an even, but still fairly course texture before incorporating the egg yokes, then the egg whites and finally one small minced onion with a rubber spatula - basically beating in air and refining the texture with each addition, ending with the addition of 2 teaspoons of normal paprika and one teaspoon of smoked mexican chili (ground). It definitely tastes better the next day but it was pretty good right out of the bowl. I let it come to room temperature before serving. I only used parsley as a garnish.

Love this recipe!!!
I made it exactly as noted in recipe, with the exception of putting it in the food processor for about 3 seconds.  I had a tough time with getting all the tough veins out of the liver, so this  helped with the consistency.  This recipe is in my favorites now.   Thanks for posting!

This recipe was close to my mother-in-law's recipe she uses for holidays.  I cut the recipe in half, and I still ended up with plenty!  It's my first attempt, and like another reviewer said, it did end up being a little on the dry side.  I added a few extra ingredients, and I got it to the consistency I prefer.  I added the onions towards the end (regular chopped onions--not green onions) so that it had more than just a liver taste.  I would try it with the green onions next time.  Overall, I'm satisfied with the recipe and would make it again.

I never had chopped liver before, altho I love liver. This recipe wasn't as strong-tasting as I anticipated. Easy & tasty. My hubby hates liver, so I get it all!
