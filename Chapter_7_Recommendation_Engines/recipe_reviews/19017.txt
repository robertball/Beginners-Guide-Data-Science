WOW!

I made this two times - once exactly according to recipe, and second with a few alterations.

The recipe version was fantastic, and I did not think it was too sweet.  It was very rich, and I thought there was a strong cool whip flavor, and not enough chocolate.  Nonetheless, it was delicious and everyone agreed.

The second time I followed some suggestions here, and the dessert won me first place in a contest this weekend!  I mixed the pudding and water, and in a separate bowl whipped 1/2 pint heavy cream and 3 tbsp sugar, then folded in the cream with the pudding/water.  I also did use the french vanilla cool whip in place of the plain (12 oz).  So, I layered brownies, caramel, heath toffee bits, chocolate whipped cream, and french vanilla cool whip.  Repeat!

It was PHENOMENAL.  I had so many requests for the recipe, and I saw numerous people going back for 2nds and 3rds.  It was a major hit, and will be a staple dessert dish for me!

Thank you!!

This review is a little late but this recipe is EXCELLENT!   I made it first for a fake thanksgiving a week early with family that was going out of town, it was very good, but I don't like whipped topping and I found it had entirely too much of that.  So i made it again for Thanksgiving the next week and it was soooo amazing!  But I made a few adjustments... in the brownie layer I addred about half a bottle of caramel topping (as you would use on ice cream) in the brownie pan before it went into the oven.  (really good...) then in the pudding layer, instead of folding in the whipped topping, i bought half a pint of heavy whipping cream and whipped that for about 10 minutes myself and then folded that into the pudding.  It made such an incredible difference.  The pudding tasted so mych richer, like custard, instead of fluffy like whipped topping.  I also added bailey's in the pudding and cut strawberries, chocolate chunks - per my husband's request, and toffee bits, which made it look so pretty.  But you can add pretty much anything you want and it still tastes EXCELLENT!  EVERYONE who tried it loved it and my mother-in-law asked for the recipe, along with everyone else.  Always nice to confirm that her son didn't make a mistake marrying me:-)  YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS DESSERT, YUMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This is now known among our friends as "The Dessert".  Before every party, I'm asked if I'm bringing "The Dessert".  It is so good!  I use the brownie mixes that have some sort of chunk in them (ie. triple chocolate chunk brownies, chocolate peanut butter cup).  I also whip up one cup of heavy whipping cream and add that to the condensed milk/water/pudding mix instead of using cool whip.  I think this helps to make sure the sweetness isn't overdone.  And for the cool whip layer, I use French Vanilla flavor instead of plain, because it gives the whole dish more flavor.  You have GOT to try this, and try it my way because like I said, it's getting quite a cult following!

I had great expectations for this  recipe which has such high reviews.  I wasn't impressed with the "synthetic" taste of instant pudding and cool whip.  It was too sweet and had a syrupy, filmy mouthfeel.  I think it would be worthwhile to use cooked pudding, cooled of course, and real whipped cream which can be prepared simply by beating 1 cup of cream with 1/4 cup powdered sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla.

This is an easy, delicious, and pretty dessert. If you opt to use a trifle bowl as opposed to a regular glass bowl, you might want to third the brownies and pudding mix instead of half them for the layers. Trifle bowls are tall, and you will run out of brownies for more than two layers. Also, I topped this with mini chocolate chips instead of shaved chocolate. A lot easier.

This was an excellent and attractive dessert!  I used fudgy brownie mix (be sure not to use the mix you pour the chocolate syrup in yourself or the brownies will be too gooey for the trifle).  I gave it four stars because I didn't use the 8oz frozen whipped topping in the pudding mixture.  As other reviews advised, I whipped 1/2 pint heavy whipping cream and folded that in the pudding mixture instead.  I think it's better this way to avoid the dessert being TOO SWEET!  This is a great recipe, and I will definitely make again...but I'll be making it my way.

So tasty and so easy to make!  I brought this to a neighborhood holiday party and everyone loved it.

I refrigerated the pudding after I mixed it with the water, condensed milk and cool whip.  It thickened it up and made it easy to spread into a nice layer.  (Also made for yummy clean-up with a spoon for my 5 year old!)  And instead of cutting the brownies into 1 inch squares, I wound up crumbling them with my hands to provide smaller bite-size pieces.  I also garnished the top with fresh raspberries.  It was delicious!

I wonder how it would be if you substituted some Bailey's for the water?  ;)  I'll bet strong coffee would also be good in place of the water.  I think I'll try some variations in the future.

I needed a quick, easy dessert that would please a large group of people, each with their own picky tastes. Who wouldn't love this?  They all did. :) This is a safe and pretty dessert. Pleases just about everybody, and is fool proof to make. I topped this with Heath Bars.

Very good dessert. Light and easy to prepare. The next time I will try choclate cake instead of brownie mix. I think I will like the texture of the cake part better. My family loved it.

First of all, the Ingredient changes I made are as follows: I bought Smucker's Caramel Sundae Syrup, Heath Toffee Bits, heavy whipping cream, and I also used the French Vanilla Cool Whip in place of the plain (12 oz), and deleted the 8oz Cool Whip. Everything else was the same.
I baked a regular brownie package in a 7x11 dish to make the brow nies come out thinner for layering. Then in a separate bowl I whipped 1 cup of heavy cream until stiff peaks.  I mixed the pudding, water, and condensed milk thoroughly in another bowl then folded in the cream with the pudding/water mix. In a triffle bowl I layered brownies (just cut & crumbled to make them fit), caramel, chocolate whipped cream, french vanilla cool whip, and then Heath toffee bits; Repeat!
This was a MAJOR hit with everyone...especially the kids!! I'm adding this one to the recipe box...EASY & DELISH!

WOW!!!  I made this recipe with using some recommendations from other reviewers.  Used heavy whipping cream instead of cool whip in pudding mixture and added toffee pieces on top of brownie layer.  topped with pieces of crumbled brownie.  presented so well and was so rich and tasty!  everyone loved it at memorial day party i brought it too!!!    (UPDATE:  for easier cutting of the brownies, i inverted brownies out of pan onto cookie sheet after about five minutes out of oven and cut into one inch squares with a pizza cutter!  so much easier)

I made this for my mom's birthday.  She is the ultimate chocoholic and has an almost insatiable sweet tooth.  As I usually do when I make a recipe here, I asked the family how they would rate this...with a mouthful of trifle, my mom mumbled "15!" and my kids agreed.  So why did I only give it 3 stars?  Because what I ended up with was quite different from the recipe thanks to the comments here.  First, I used real whipping cream instead of cool whip.  I used only 1/3 cup sweetened condensed milk plus 1-2/3 cups milk to prepare the pudding and folded in UNSWEETENED whipped cream.  For the rest of the cream, I lightly sweetened it and added a generous amount of vanilla. I layered the trifle as directed except that I added a layer of crushed oreo cookie crumbs between the first mousse/cream layer.  It was RICH but not overpoweringly sweet and sickly. I left the remaining trifle with my mom and she's a happy camper.

I have been making a version of this for YEARS, and every time there is a get-together, I am asked to bring this.  If you make the mousse first, and let set up in the fridge for a few hours or overnight, it whips up and becomes a lot creamier.  Then I layer it with brownies, whipped cream, a jar of Mrs. Richardson's caramel topping, and chopped pecans.  You end up with a turtle trifle that is to DIE for!

It was a very good recipe. Very easy just plan 9 hrs before you serve it. All said though ,It was very VERY sweet. So sweet that half was definitely left on the plate from even my most chocolate chocolate lovers. The Espresso of desserts Id say! next time I will make real thin brownie layers. (mine were very thick and had walnuts)I might even try to make more of a mousse instead of the pudding and condensed milk so the sweet will be more balanced. We didnt have coffee with it,but every one did mention that "its a coffee desert". We made it for a birthday cake and it was a little much but it is a very unique recipe and if your having a very special occasion at night drinking coffee Id say it would be a real winner. Remember only small portions a little goes a long way. Im talking no more than a 3 x 4 inch pile or slice or what ever you want to call it. Thanks for the recipe its opened up a new avenue in desserts

I've made this a few times and it is def a crowd pleaser.  Of course I change it around each time and the one that got the most reviews is- I use homemade brownie layer, Hershey's chocolate mouse layer (recipe from this sight), and last fresh whipped cream (2cups heavy cream, 3/4 cup sifted confectioners sugar and a squirt of vanilla-whip in chilled bowl with chilled wisk or paddles)
and WOW talk about rich, sweet and delicious!  You really have to be a chocolate lover for this.  I've made with the pudding layer and cool whip and it is still very very tasty.  But nothing beats fresh whipped cream.  Next time I'll toss in cherries or strawberries for a fruity taste.
Thanks

It was MUCH too sweet for our taste.  I think making your own whipped cream and leaving out the sweetended condensed milk would make a big difference.

This was so yummy!  I can see why awards were won on this recipe.  I followed the suggestions of Roxanne323 and did the following.  

1. Prepare brownie mix according to package directions and cool completely.  Cut into 1 inch squares.
2. In a large bowl, combine pudding mix and water, and in a separate bowl whipped 1/2 pint heavy cream and 3 tbsp sugar, then fold in the 8 oz container frozen whipped topping with the pudding/water. Because I the french vanilla cool whip was discontinued, I found another recipe for Vanilla Chantilly Cream.  Whip on high in a mixer 4 c of heavy whipping cream, 4 tbsps sugar, 2 tsps vanilla until soft peaks form.  
3. In a large bowl or glass serving dish, layer brownies, caramel, heath toffee bits, chocolate whipped cream, and french vanilla cool whip. Repeat.  Then on top sprinkled a few more toffee bits.  Yum was this good.

For Halloween, I used some finely crushed Oreo cookies on top to look like dirt, some Milano cookies for headstones, and cut-out sugar cookies dipped in white chocolate for ghosts. I finished it off with a brown/purple/orange mixture of sprinkles. It was a big hit! I like to call this "Chocolate Graveyard Trifle." =)

This dessert is always requested at our family get togethers.  I always make it with chocolate cake.  It tastes better if you make it a day before, which makes it so convenient.    I make mine with skor or heath bars (which I unwrap and place in a ziplock and freeze for 20 min, to make chopping them up easy).  You can't go wrong with this dessert, and it is a good basic to add variations according to your family and friends likings.
***I recently made this again with the following variation:
Chocolate Creme de Menthe Trifle.  Instead of Heath Bars, I bought a bag of chopped Andes (found in baking aisle) and put them over the whipped cream layers.  Then I bought a box of Andes and put the whole pieces of Andes in a arrangement on top (so the guests would know what type of trifle it was).  It was delicious!  For Christmas I will be making a Peppermint one.  There are so many options!

I've made this a few times; each time I'm the hit of the party! Ha! Brownies must be cold or it gets a little soupy, learned that the hard way. Yum!

Really yummy!  I made a couple substitutions.  I actually used all whipped cream since I couldnt find the whipped topping with any bad stuff in it. I didnt use that much whip cream. I also didnt have time to make it with brownie so I used chocolate pound cake. I topped it with strawberries.  It was delicious-very decadent though!

I make this recipe all the time to take to gatherings, with a few changes.  After the brownies have baked, I drizzle them with apox. 1/4 cup kahlua, and instead of chocolate on top, I sprinkle with chopped toffee candy bars like skor or heath.

I made a few alterations as I read all the reviews and chose to do it the way the very first review appears after the recipe. I whipped up a batch of heavy whip cream and mixed it with the chocolate pudding, which by the way 1/2 cup of water to pudding makes it waaayy too sticky and hard to mix, so the next batch I added 1 whole cup of milk. Anyway, I did it like this: brownie, caramel, choc pudding/cream, cool whip, choc pudding/cream, then layered whip cream on top. I didn't continue with the cool whip cause to me cool whips nasty and I just couldn't bring myself to top it off with it so real whip cream I did. It tasted really good and I am glad the way it turned out. Next time and there will be a next time, I am going to use chocolate mousse, (theres a great recipe on allrecipes, amazing, its my go to for mousse always!) and white chocolate mousse, and keep the whip cream and the caramel.

This is a real attention-getter!  I tried using real whipping cream for the layers, but I should have used two instead of only one. It didn't have the
height that cool whip provides.  I found it interesting that the pudding layer changed consistency and became whipped rather than blah when refrigerated for awhile.  Next time I
will try putting fruit between the layers...I bet it will be fabulous!

This was wonderful and gone w/i minutes but I found it to be a little too sweet.  I may try a previous reviewer's suggestion and use heavy cream rather than Cool Whip.

Talk about a choholic's dream! Most of my chocolate lovers couldn't get enough. Some of my guests who aren't into chocolate thought it was a bit sweet and too rich. I even added my favorite raspberry sauce from this site between the layers. I felt that the tartness would cut the sweetness of the chocolate. Also I cut the whipped cream in half. Thanks for sharing, Wayne. This is a keeper!

This is a easy & delicious recipe. BUT it's even better (to us) if you (1)layer brownies, (2)chocolate pudding mix (made according to pkg directions), (3) then Heath toffee bits, (4) then Cool Whip, and repeat! Top with shaved chocolate! YUMMY!!

Beat 1/2 c whipping cream till soft peaks formed and folded that into the chocolate pudding instead of cool whip, thanks to the advice of many other reviewers. Also drizzled a little caramel ice cream topping in between chocolate mousse layer and cool whip layer. I thought everyone at the party that I took this to were going to lick their bowls! Took the tiny bit that was left over to a couple of the girls at work and their eyes rolled back in their heads at the first bite. I used a fudgy brownie mix with chocolate chunks in it. The combination of that, the amazing chocolate mousse, caramel, and cool whip were enough. I think any other additions of candy bars, toffee, etc. would have been too many flavors competing with each other. I did garnish the top with chocolate curls and received many compliments about how pretty this was. This is my new go to dessert for anything to which I have to bring a dish and want to impress. Made the brownies and put the mixer bowl and beaters for the cream in freezer the night before, threw this together in about 20 minutes the next morning.

I have been making this recipe for years.  It is always a crowd pleaser.  Definately best made the night before.  I also have substituted Irish Cream and pepermint liquour for water when taking to adult only affairs.

I made this for a New Year's Eve party and every last bit was eaten! We are chocoholics here and could not get enough. I did make adjustments. I followed reviewer's [Christina] tip and mixed up heavy whipped cream (about 3 minutes in my Kenmore mixer) and added that to the pudding mix. It tasted sooo good that I doubled the pudding. The next time I make it, I will add less whipped topping. It was too much for us....and probably make an additional batch of chocolate pudding since that was to die for. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this to take to a party. Before I took it, I decided to taste it and was glad I did! This is way too sweet... and I love chocolate . I would be embarassed to have taken this to a party and had people eat it because it didn't taste good at all. I would suggest to leave out the brownies and replace with pound cake.

It's good but I definately think that you should use homeade whipped cream with the pudding (I just used heavy cream with no sugar) I also added frozen raspberries over the brownie mix so when they dethawed they added a really rich taste to the dish. The tartness of the raspberries helped with the richness of the dish.

Such a fun recipe to assemble & so delish! Few tips:
Prepare at least 24 hours before serving. 48 hours combined the flavors as if it was a devine dessert from the finest restaurant.  Since it is a rich dessert you will find it will stretch further than the 12 servings.  Because of ease and awesome flavors you won't want to pass this up at your next gathering. (Used bagged toffee bits instead of chocolate curls)

VERY GOOD WITH SOME CHANGES.I OMITTED THE CONDENSED MILK AND COOL WHIP FELT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO SWEET. MADE THE CHOCOLATE PUDDING ACCORDING TO THE PACKAGE DIRECTIONS WITH REGULAR MILK.   WHIPPED SOME HEAVY CREAM WITH A LITTLE POWDER SUGAR USED THAT INSTAED OF THE COOL WHIP . ALSO DRIZZELED CHOCOLATE SYRUP IN BETWEEN THE LAYERS. THIS WAS REALLY GOOD WITH JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF SWEETNESS

I made this for book club and my family. I got rave reviews!  I used a homemade brownie recipe which people said made a difference.  I also mixed the pudding with 1/2 c. water, condensed milk (fat free), and then 1/2 c. milk.  It still tasted great without as much sugar.  Whipped topping was also fat free.  Very rich and delicious!

I prepared this trifle to take to my parent's house on Christmas.  Everyone in my family couldn't believe how gorgeous it was!  And the taste...something that tastes this good should be illegal!!  Everyone was commenting on how delicious it was and most of it was gone in just a few minutes!  I will definitely be making this again!!

This is an excellent chocolate recipe!  I added a layer of strawberry cool-whip in the middle and "kicked-it-up" a notch.  It was a refreshing addition to the chocolate.

This was fabulous! It was such a big hit, all of it was eaten, which was surprising judging how decadent it was. First suggestion: Add rosewater to your whipped cream. You can't actually "taste" the rosewater, but you can definitely smell it...and taste is 90% smell. It is traditional to add rosewater to the whipping cream in a trifle. Second suggestion: Use real whipping cream (SUPER stiff peaks). The difference is surprising. Cool-whip and real whipping cream is to the savory comparison of "Miracle whip" versus "real mayo." A world of difference there, if you know what I mean.

I make this (I call it Brownie trifle). I don't use the sweetened condensed milk at all just mix in some cream or cool whip with the pudding.Sometimes I add strawberries over the brownies, drizzle them with Hershey's syrup, then layer on the pudding etc.. OR mix some strong coffee into the pudding and drizzle brownies with either chocolate or caramel syrup.....YUM!!!!!!!!

OH MY GOODNESS!  This was so GOOD!  I did use heavy cream as advised by the other reviewers.  However, I used the whole pint and added some hershey's syrup. That in and of itself was absolute killer - I licked the bowl and the beaters!!! I made it for Christmas.  I ended up having to hide what was left.  My finicky husband has already requested it for our family reunion in August.

This was a huge hit at my housewarming party. I used fat-free everything (the pudding, sweetened-condensed milk, 'No-Pudge' brand brownies, and homemade whipped cream from FF half & half and a little sugar and vanilla - so much better than gross Cool Whip). Then since I saved so many calories that way I felt no guilt in swapping out the water with Kahlua! It's all about balance, right? This turned out SO GOOD! :)

Made this recipe with Thanksgiving dinner and I must say this was the most delicious dessert I've ever made!  My boyfriend says it's perfectly balanced, sweet but not too sweet. You can't go wrong making this for your next party. I made substitutions as follows.    Instead of the 8 oz cool whip mixed into the chocolate pudding mixture I used a 1/2 pint of heavy whipping cream that I whipped up with a beater until it got fluffy.   I added pecan bits and heath toffee bits ontop of the cool whip layer.  I also added a light drizzle of caramel ice cream topping ontop of the bottom brownie layer.  I think the brownies you select make a big difference in flavor. I used one that had big chunks of chocolate and baked up really fudgy.  I decorated it with extra pecan bits, rasberries and blackberries and Ghiradellis milk chocolate/dark chocolate bar shavings. Would even taste great with some sliced bananas. Serve with coffee, espresso or a latte to top it off with the perfect compliment.  I will be making this many times more in the future and my man will love me more for it.  :)

Very rich and sweet so a small serving is all most can really handle. I topped the brownies in the second layer with some dulce de leche sauce which made it even sweeter. Not a good idea and I won't do that next time. I would love to try this with a nice, dark cake mix like devils food instead of the brownies.This would make it more like a trifle. I will also be putting a layer of cherry pie filling in between so it is more like a Black forest version.

For all of those who don't like the too sweetness of this recipe, I've been making this for years and I use chocolate cake instead of brownies and chocolate pudding made the regular way with milk.  It always gets raves and requests for the recipe.  I like using real whipped cream and toffee bits. Yum!

UPDATE: I have whipped up this yummy trifle five times since Thanksgiving. Such a simple dessert that has people begging me for this recipe. I plan on making it again this weekend...with Andes mints!!!Incredible! I brought this dessert to a party and it was gone in a flash! Everyone was in heaven eating the chocolate trifle. I should have made two trifles!!! I did change two things (as suggested by other reviewers) - used french vanilla cool whip and whipped 1/2 pint of heavy cream.

After reading the reviews of others, I made the following changes.  I used a cup of whipping cream (whipped) instead of the frozen whipped topping in the pudding mixure and also added some Bailey's to the pudding mixture.  Instead of plain whipped topping, I substituted french vanilla whipped topping.  I also added strawberries and raspberry sauce over the brownie layers.  I know I changed it quite a bit, but when I took it to my pot-luck dinner, it disappeared fast!

This trifle is wonderful!  It's quick and easy and the presentation is beautiful!  I have made differnt variations of this recipe, and have found triple chocolate cake mix as a substitute for the brownies to be the best.  I also enjoyed chocolate cake with vanilla pudding and bananas.  The possibilities are endless.  I'm thinking of experimenting with a pumpkin version of this recipe.  All my family really enjoyed it, and is always eaten quite quickly!  Overall, a wonderful dessert fit for entertaining!

I made this for my family on Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit.  It actually caused fights between the adults and children over who got to lick the bowl.  I've been asked to make it for every holiday to come now.  As a little change to add some color and flavor I added a layer of fresh strawberries and bananas which worked perfectly.

This was a easy and simple wonderful delight. I have made this several times for my cheerleaders, co-workers, and my husband's co-workers. The review is always the same "that really taste good". Tip: Make sure you brownie are soft and chewy.  OO.. it's so good.

Seems as though am in the minority with this dessert.  I found the trifle to be too sweet, with overpowering whip cream, as well time consuming.  I made home baked brownies, should have stopped there.

This is one recipe that I consistently use!  I usually sprinkle chocolate chips over the whipped topping layers instead of shaving chocolate on top.  Recently, I made this and added 1/2 cup of creamy peanut butter to the pudding/water/condensed milk mix and then using 48 small (or 24 large) coarsely chopped peanut butter cups sprinkled over the whipped topping layers.  Very rich but extra yummy!

Looked beautiful, tasted absolutely delicious.  I used my own homemade brownies, and used Mr. Goodbar on top of each of the whipped cream layers.  I took this to a large get-together, and people were lining up for it while they were still eating their food.  Not a spoonful left...I saw that someone actually scraped the trifle glass with a spoon to get whatever scraps were left.  :)

I made a slight adjustment to this recipe.  I though the brownies would be a little too dense, so I used Chocolate Lover's Chocolate Cake (also on this site) instead.  While the cake turned out more dense than I anticipated, it was fabulous.  Additionally, I used fresh whipped cream instead of cool-whip and felt this helped this recipe not be a "sugar-bomb".  It went over swimmingly at my party and I'll definately make it again.  UPDATE:  This has officially become a "forever" recipe.  Everytime I've made it, I gotten nothing but rave reviews and people begging me to make it again.

Wow. I was very skeptical of this recipe due to the instant jello and the "very Sweet" reviews. However, let me just say, people @ my dinner party kept asking me where I purchased such a delicacy! It was SCRUMPTIOUS! Following the advice of other reviewers, I made my own whipped topping/cream out of 24 oz. heavy cream + 1/2 c. powdered sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla extract. If you don't want it to be too rich, don't add the sugar and vanilla to the whipped heavy cream that you fold into the jello mixture! This keeps the flavor very light and tasty. Other than doubling the amount of brownies (because who doesn't love good brownies,) I stayed true to the recipe.  Overall it was such a hit that I think I'm going to make it for every big event that comes along in the next,.... oh say.... FOREVER!

Ok, so I made this a little different. I used turtle brownies, the Ghiradelli ones. Then I used chocolate chips and chocolate syrup and added them to the layers. Instead of using any sweetened condensed milk, I just made the pudding as normal. I ran out of time before our Young Marrieds Christmas Party at Church, so i had to do it quick. Everyone was like, "WHO MADE THIS?!?" and stole some of it up until the end. I will always be known as the killer dessert maker at our potlucks! LOL.

Used real whipped cream, caramel sauce, and heath bar chunks.  This is SO good!  Even better 2 days later after the brownie has had a chance to absorb more caramel and cream.

I made this recipe and the changes I made were as follows: I added one teas. of almond extract to the water, used whipped cream instead of cool whip in the chocolate pudding mixture and I used french vanilla cool whip instead of plain. I also put a couple of crushed heath bars on top. Next time I'm going to add either bananas or strawberries as an additional layer. Everyone wanted the recipe. YUMMY!

This trifle was incredible!  The pudding mixture was like a mousse and was delicious! My family loved it and because of the presentation (I made it the centerpiece for our family dinner) my husband is now going to let me get the nice trifle bowl that I wanted to purchase originally!  Provided, of course, I make this more frequently!  :)

Too sweet as is...but is great with changes.  I prepared the pudding as the package directs (no condensed milk) then added unsweetened whipping cream and for the whip cream layer, I used very lightly sweetened whipping cream.  Added crushed skor bar to the whip cream layers and on top.  I always get asked for the recipe on this one....and never any leftovers.

I have made this numerous times and it has had rave reviews every time.  My son requests it instead of cake for his birthday.  I do modify it somewhat, though - I use a turtle brownie mix and add extra caramel topping to the brownie layers.  I buy the "no mess" bottle of caramel ice cream topping and squirt some on top of the brownies after adding it to the bowl.  I also use only about 1/4 of a can of the sweetened condensed milk, since I think it is too sweet if you use the whole can.  Wonderful recipe, and looks good, too!

This gets points for taste and ease in making it. I added about 3 oz. of cream cheese to the whip cream layer and used heavy whipping cream. It was marvelous. I made it the night before and it held up great. I will make it again.

I made this for a food contest at work (category = chocolate) and won! As others suggested, I also used heavy whipping cream (beat in my Kitchen Aid mixer for about 5 min.) instead of Cool Whip.  When making the pudding, I used 1/4 c. water and 1/4 c. milk plus the sweetened, condensed milk, and about a cup of the whipping cream. I added a layer of strawberries in the middle and also a layer of caramel topping towards the top. I put smashed Heath bars and chocolate shavings on top.  Next time I will put a layer of smashed Heath within and will try the suggestion of caramel in the brownie pan.

Oh my goodness!!  I made this for Christmas and it was a huge hit.  I think if my guests didn't have manners they would have licked the bowl!!  It was very easy to make.  I followed the recommendations of previous reviewers and only used 16 oz of Cool Whip - that was plenty!  Will make again and again!

Delicious recipe!  I did not use the brownie mix instead I made the Absolutely Best Brownies recipe here on AR.  Also made my own whipped  cream topping and sprinkled mini chocolate chips on top of trifle. There were no  leftovers :)  Thanks Wayne for sharing your recipe!

I made this by making the pudding per the instructions on the box.  I left out the water and condensed milk.  It was delicious.  I topped it with Heath Bar bits found in the baking aisle.  I served it at Easter and it was gone in an hour.  I'm not a big sweet lover - but I loved this!  One other note:  I tore the brownies in smaller pieces - easier to eat than a one inch square.  Next time I'm going to add a little Bailey's.

Though I found this recipe to be a bit too sweet, it was a hit at one of our holiday meals this year.  Next time I will use more brownie and overcook it a bit and less cool whip.  I topped it with chunks of snickers.  At a dinner where the hostess apparently asked everyone to bring dessert, this was the number one choice for everyone.

This is a great recipe with additional ideas from others along the way!  Another idea thrown into the mix is to soak the brownies in 1 cup of kahlua before layering (for adults of course)...mmmmm

Another great potluck hit in my office! I made it exactly as directed this time for my office but I can't wait to try the suggestions from ROXANNE323 Reviewed on Jun. 10, 2007.  There is no doubt it will be a smash as well!

I was lucky enough to find a seasonal box of instant "Turtle" jello pudding in my pantry!  The carmel/pecan flavor in this choc. pudding gave this recipe a nice variation.  The only thing I changed was I added skim milk vs. water.  A must for chocolate lovers everywhere!!

I followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased with the results. I am not a big fan of pudding based desserts, but this one was very good. I really think the denseness of the brownies is what sets this dessert off. I think next time I will also add a layer of chopped nuts and perhaps brownies with chunks of chocolate in them. A very pretty, tasty and easy dessert. I plan on making it again soon.

I made this trile to serve to guests last night and the end result was just ok - although I did change the recipe based on other reviews. I used cooked pudding and omitted the condensed milk as a result. I also used 'real' whipped cream as opposed to cool whip and ended up folder some of it into the pudding to lighten it a bit. The only other change I made was to sprinkle toffee bits and mini chocolate chips between the layers and on top. The end result was very rick and quite dense (although the whipped cream did lighten it somewhat). I may try again, but will replace the brownies with a less dense chocolate cake mix.

Made this today for our monthly "First Sunday Family Dinner", my duty was dessert....And this was a hit! But because I bake for a living, I made a few modifications. I used chocolate fudge cake(instead of brownie) and I topped it off with a nice thick drizzles of caramel and taosted (makes a difference) pecans all over the top. FABULOUS!!!
P.S. It didnt take eight hours to set, we ate it after 2hrs.

I am on weight watchers, so thought I would change this into a healther version.  I used 95% fat free Cool Whip, Lite Sweetened Condensed milk, fat free chocolate pudding, and Betty Crocker Low Fat Fudge Brownies and added Skor bits to each layer.  This made it not so sweet, it tasted silky with a nice toffee crunch.  
= 12 points for 1 Cup serving, 
= 6 points for 1/2 Cup serving.

Extremely too sweet. It had the flavor of those fancy pastries you get at a grocery store bakery. Just a fake, sweet, extremely rich flavor.  I had another version for a chocolate trifle but thought I would try this for a change. I definitely like mine better. The difference is that you make the pudding according to the directions and pour this over the brownies.  You also add chopped candy bars to the layers.  I use either Heath bars or Resses' Cups.   Anyway, I will not make this version again.

We tried this trifle and it turned out perfect.  We didn't change the recipe, just added toasted slivered almonds and mini chocolate chips as an additional layer.  It turned out perfect.  I will upload a picture.

This dessert is very rich but delicious!  I used real whipped cream instead of whipped topping as I don't really like the taste of Cool Whip.  I added Skor toffee bits and used the chocolate chunk brownie mix as recommended by other reviewers.  I topped with chocolate shavings but next time I might try rasberries.  I will definitely make this again, thanks for the recipe - it was a devoured by everyone who tried it!

I wanted to use the french vanilla whipped cream  as others suggusted, buy my grocer didn't have it. So I whipped my own using one cup heaving whipping cream, 1tbsp sugar, and 1tsp vanilla. My first time making homemade whip. crm. Added it to the pudding mix, used reg. store bought whip crm for the other layer. I drizzled on a little caramel over the brownies, and added crushed toffee chips. YUMMY, huge success at my in-laws for christmas.

This recipe sounded so good. I made it for my husband who usually loves my chocolate trifle made with devils good cake, choc pudding and cool whip with crushed Heath bar on top. Well, our whole family agreed that this recipe was WAY too sweet. My kids didn't even want to finish theirs. I think I'll stick to my usual trifle recipe.

This is good. Not the best dessert I have ever had but good. Disappears fast. I would love to try a different pudding then chocolate-- maybe a mocha flavored-- or would like to try flavoring with the chocolate like mint to add more flavor.

This has to be one of the most sinfully delicious desserts I have ever had! It was SOOOO good, and my guests were just raving about it all night long. The only minor changes I made, I added caramel topping on top of the brownie layers. I used cool whip for the pudding mixture, but then I also whipped a pint of fresh whipping cream and didn't add any sugar to it. That was used instead of cool whip on top of the pudding mixture. I also sprinkled the top with heath bar bits. This was DELICIOUS!!! Thank you for an outstanding recipe!

I have to agree with Paula's review below. The recipe sounded like it had a lot of potential and I was extremely excited to try it, but I also didn't like the feel or taste of the pudding mix. The final product also ended up tasting too dry. I had some a day later with some ice cream and that helped. I think the recipe might be better with cake pieces and real pudding.

This was DIVINE. I took a couple suggestions on this. I subbed the 8 oz. of whipped cream for the handmade stuff, whisking heavy cream, 2 Tbsp sugar and a tad of mexican vanilla together. This gave the chocolate pudding wonderful flavor. I also left out about 1/4 cup of the water and used irish cream liquer in its place and sprinkled heath bits over the brownies when I layered everything up. EXCELLENT substitutions if you want more depth to your already decadent dish and very pretty!!

Made this for my sisters first baby shower. Everyone devoured it first thing. I thought it was very good (after licking what was left on the spoon and scraping the empty trifle dish) Very simple recipe just be sure to remember that it needs to sit in the fridge as stated!!!

I did not care for this.  It is over sweet and tastes completely artificial.  I substituted real whipped cream and cut the sugar drastically and it didn't help.  Only one person at Thanksgiving could finish his serving.

This was such a hit at my sister's bridal shower and my friend's baby shower! I made some changes - To keep the cake non-dairy/parve - I mixed the instant chocolate pudding powder with 2 cups of soy milk instead of the water and condensed milk. I topped the cake with chopped cookies and peanut chews. This is always a big hit for a crowd!

I have made this recipe over and over for potlucks, reunions, etc over the past 5 years. As written the trifle is wonderful, but very sweet.  I cut the sweetness by using homemade whipped cream for the layer mixed with the pudding. I sometimes modify this recipe by adding a 4th layer of fresh fruit such as strawberries or raspberries.  My favorite is to add caramel sauce over the brownie layer and toffee chips and pecans over the whipped cream layer for a turtle trifle!

I added strawberries to this and OH BOY! It was fantastic. I don't think I would have liked it as much without the strawberries though. I also used whipping cream....soooo good! This is definitely for chocolate lovers!

This was not good at all. Too much whipped cream and not really chocolaty. My family was very disappointed.

Excellent and so easy!  Took this to a church event and it was the first thing gone. I used french vanilla cool whip instead of plain, and on the top of each layer drizzled some caramel sauce and sprinkled with Heath bar bits instead of shaving chocolate.  Also, I was in a time crunch when I made it, so instead of making my own brownies, I bought a sheet of pre-made Pillsbury chocolate-chunk brownies that I found at Sam's and diced them up -- they were perfect and saved me a ton of time.  I couldn't believe how good this was and how extravagant it seemed.  I made it the night before and let it sit...although I worried it would get mushy, it was absolutely perfect.  People asked me for the recipe after taking just one bite.  This is definitely one that I will make again and again!

This is soooo delicious and easy to make.  I double the brownie recipe to fill my dish and follow the rest of the recipe exactly.  My neighbor calls it the Chocolate Trifecta!  I never have any leftovers.

Soooo Delicious!  My only change was to add 1/2 cup strong ice coffee instead of water to the pudding mixture.  It was gobbled up in minutes.  Both impressive looking and tasting, how can you go wrong?

This is a really easy, very impressive dessert.

Following other suggestions, I used a pint of whipping cream and 3T of sugar added into the pudding mix, water, and condensed milk mixture, instead of Cool Whip.  I also use French Vanilla Cool Whip for the 12 oz. that you layer.  My layers were brownie, caramel, pudding, Heath, whipped topping, repeat, then put caramel and Heath on top.

I have made it three times so far.  The second time, I was in a hurry, and only refrigerated it about four hours and it wasn't as good.  Definitely refrigerate it overnight!

I made this for thanksgiving this year and it was great! I did change some things like most people did. I also used a half pint of whipping cream instead of cool whip. I also crumbled up a Hersheys bar and put it on top of the brownies,and used the chunk brownies.I used strawberry whip cream instead of the regular.Next time i will use 2 boxes of brownies everyone loved it ,just said it needed more chocolate and suggested more brownies,but this is a great recipe and you can do so many things with it!

This dessert was absolutely amazing.  I followed some suggestions and added caramel on the brownies when layering, as well as making my own cool whip (pt whipping cream, 1/3 cup of powdered sugar, 1 tsp vanilla) for one of the layers as opposed to container cool whip.  My daughter has determined this will be her birthday dessert, and several guests at a small get together asked for the recipe after it was totally devoured.  GREAT RECIPE!!!!

SORRY ABOUT PREVIOUS REVIEW.  ANYWAY. JUST WANTED TO TELL EVERYONE THAT I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS RECIPE.  THE ONLY THING THAT I CHANGED IS THE BROWNIE MIX.  INSTEAD OF USING BROWNIES, I USED CHOCOLATE CAKE.  AND YOU COULD USE WHATEVER KIND OF CHOCOLATE CAKE YOU WANT.  TALK ABOUT PEOPLE BEGGING FOR YOUR RECIPE.  THIS IS THE ONE RECIPE THAT EVERYONE IS ALWAYS ASKING ME HOW TO MAKE.

OMG!!!  If you like a rich desert you must try this!  I made it for family a couple of days ago and was immediately asked to bring it for Father's Day!  I also changed it up a little bit after reading some of the suggestions.  I poured a little caramel over each layer of brownie and used Heath Topping on top of both layers of whipped cream.  I thought the original whipped cream that was called for in the recipe with the pudding and sweetened condensed milk worked just great!  I will definitely be making this many more times in the future- it is my new favorite desert!

Made this recipe the first time exactly according to the directions and it was really good.  BUT, the second time I made it using the suggestions I received from reading the reviews: 1/2 pint heavy whipping cream, whipped (in place of the 8 oz. coolwhip), french vanilla coolwhip (in place of the 12 oz. coolwhip)and chocolate peanut butter brownie mix(instead of regular brownie mix) - also, used a grater to shave the chocolate for the top ... These suggestions turned a great dessert into a simply fabulous dessert... brought the dish to work and got tons of compliments and requests for the recipe ....yummy!

as written, this recipe gets 4 stars. with a few modifications as suggested by past reviews it is a 5 star recipe. i replaced some of the whipped topping with heavy whipping cream, i added a layer of strawberries, and drizzled caramel over the brownie layers. i made two for mother's day, one for my family and one for my boyfriend's family... both trifle dishes came back empty and everyone loved it! will definitely make again.

We found too sweet the first time, but since then, I've added ~1T. instant coffee (dissolved in the tiniest bit of hot water) and crushed Heath bars on top.  Gives a deeper, but less sweet, taste. Now everyone raves.

WOW!  This was a hit at Easter dinner this year.  All the kids went back for seconds, the adults could only handle one helping -- it is VERY sweet!  But it was SO easy to put together, and what a pretty presentation it makes in the bowl.  I bought already prepared Brownie Bites from Costco so that made the recipe even easier to assemble!

I added the 8 oz. package of cream cheese per the advice of previous posts.  It is wonderful!  I am serving it tomorrow for Easter and can't wait to see what everyone thinks!  Definitely for chocolate lovers like myself!

I can only rate this on ease ... I never got any!  Excellent for a potluck since it was so easy to throw together.

Update!  YUM! This time around I used kahlua instead of water and not as much whipped cream in the cream only layer. I also crumbled the brownies instead of cubing them. Next time, I will use even less whipped cream - that was just too sweet. I wouldn't change the pudding-whipped cream layer at all (except for the kahlua substitution).

This wasn't as good as I thought it would be. It got great reviews from my family, but it wasn't spectacular. It tasted like topped brownies, not like a sophisticated dessert. This is something I might make again for my family, but I wouldn't take it to work or a party.

This is a great tasting desert that is easy to make.  It also makes a great presentation which I feel is important.  It looks as appetizing as it tastes.  I have been searching for something unique to bring to family gatherings and this is it!  I can't wait to debut it at the next party!
I will make this again and again.

This dessert is delicious.  Every time I make it I just hope that no one really likes it so that I can take home the leftovers for myself!  But that Never happens.  Whenever I am invited to a function that requires that I bring something, the host always requests that I make this chocolate trifle.  I am more than happy to prepare it, it's easy to make and even tastes great the next day after being refrigerated over night.  It's awesome.  THANKS!

This was a good trifle.  It was very sweet so a little went a long way in portion size.  I followed the recipe exactly this time but next time I might jazz it up with some crushed Heath bars or another candy in the layers.  I also used a trifle bowl and made three layers with the brownies and cream.

This was scrumptious, but I changed it so much it's not really the same recipe anymore.  I wanted a Brownie Cheesecake Trifle so this is what I did:  used cheesecake flavored pudding, 8 oz softened cream cheese, half the can of sweetened condensed milk, 1/2 cup water, and 1/2 an 8 oz tub of whipped cream...beat well.  I also used turtle brownies.  I put the cream cheese mix on top of both layers of brownies and then topped with a layer of whipped cream and milk chocolate chips.  Everyone raved over how good it was.  Thanks for a great recipe that can be adjusted to just about anything!  Fabulous.

This is very yummy... hits right in the chocolate spot!  I have also made it with a chocolate cake mix baked up and cut into chunks when I didn't have a brownie mix or didn't feel like baking them from scratch.  But the brownie is better than the cake.

I make a more 'adult' version. Use chocolate or devils food cake mix. Bake cake according to directions (a sheet cake is fine). Crumble up cake and drizzle with Kahlua. Make chocolate instant pudding according to directions. Layer cake, pudding and cool whip in trifle bowl. On top layer of cool whip, decorate be drizzling chocolate syrup and sprinkle with Heath bar crumbles (found in baking aisle). This is YUMMY! Use as much Kahlua or as little as you want. If serving to the under -21 crowd you can drizzle with some coffee instead.

Made this over the weekend for a large family dinner and everyone loved it. I did change it a bit: instead of using cool whip with the pudding, I mixed a half pint of whipping cream for 10 minutes with the Kitchen Aid mixer and folded that in. I used vanilla Jello pudding instead of chocolate pudding to contrast the chocolate in the brownies, and then I mistakenly forgot to put in the sweetened condensed milk but it was so delicious! The pudding and cream tasted just like the French pastries I had in France! I didn't put candy on top but brought a bowl of crushed butterfingers (couldn't find Heath bar which would have been perfect) so people could sprinkle them on if they wanted. I used a trifle bowl so I did 3 layers rather than 2. I baked the brownies in a 9x13 glass Pyrex so it felt like I had more to cut up for the recipe. Will make this again just the way I did it here!

This dessert is amazing!  I followed other reviewer's suggestions and used heavy whipping cream instead of Cool Whip with the pudding to cut down the sweetness.  I also added Heath bits between the two layers and fresh strawberries on top.

What a beautiful presentation this made for the table on Easter.  Everyone really enjoyed this dessert and it was gone in no time.  Only change I did per other reviews was to make the pudding per the package directions.  This dish is so easy to make and it tastes great......

I stuck pretty closely to this recipe except crushed some heath bars for a topping.  i used a fudgy brownie mix.  if you like chocolate (which i do!) then this is the dessert for you! My mom makes a version of this she calls death by chocolate with additional ingredients of kaluha over the brownies.  It is divine.

This was absolutely delicious!! I made it for our family Christmas gathering and it was a big hit. I did do a few things differently - I used real whipping cream and added vanilla extract to get the french vanilla flavor. I used cook and serve pudding instead of instant. And I added strawberries and kiwis. It was excellent!

I made this for a church luncheon and the gals told me I was evil!  It was a hit.  Very rich and delicious! I used some of the suggestions about using whipping cream and I actually had some Heath toffee bits that I sprinkled over each layer.  In my pantry, I had the brownie cookie bar mix and it was so wonderful - I chopped them into very small squares to layer in the trifle.

I made this for Easter (the night before). I took the advice of others and tweaked it a bit. I used Triple Chunk Brownie mix and Chocolate Fudge Jello. I made my own whipped cream instead of the frozen in a tub. I put a layer of Hershey's Caramel syrup over both brownie layers along with Hershey's Special Dark chocolate chips. I also used the chips on top instead of the shaved candy bar. I also added a bit of vanilla to the pudding mix. This was very rich but OH, SO DELICIOUS!! I plan to make this for our next neighborhood get-together!

Wow! I have made this several times and got top dollar at our church bake auctions. My daughter used this for her cake at her last birthday and everyone loved it. Everyone is always asking for the recipe. I have made it exactly as described, but I prefer a little less of a sweet overload. In the mouse mixture, instead of cool whip I fold in some unsweetened whipping cream. Yum, Yum, Yum!

Clearly a lot of people have made this, but here's my 2 cents.  Very sweet and the brownies from a mix taste metallic to me... so not my fave but it's a crowd pleaser.  I used REAL whipped cream (why not? just as cheap, not as sweet, better for you!) and next time I'll make real brownies to improve the taste.

I love this recipe!  No only is it delicious and everyone likes it, but it's also a pretty dessert!  Very easy to make and can be made the day before, which makes it convenient for holidays when there is so much food to prepare.

I made this for Thanksgiving and was told that it was a MUST for Christmas as well. I used my own homemade whipped cream as suggested on here. I also used a larger box of pudding than called for in the recipe. On the brownie layer, I drizzled chocolate syrup and caramel topping. Fantastic Recipe! Even my pickiest family members loved it!

This was a big hit at my holiday party.  Several people asked for the recipe and requested that I make it again next year.  I only gave it 4 stars however because I thought it was a bit too sweet (even though I used real whipped cream instead of whipped topping).  Maybe if I add strawberries next time (a little tart to mello the sweet), I might like it better.

This is sooooo good.  I used my favorite brownie recipe from scratch and made my own whip cream.  It might be a little more work but definitely worth the effort.

All I can say is that this is a huge hit whenever I make it and with whoever I make it for.  I always add lots of toffee candy bar bits to it because I love them and love the crunch they provide.  Other than that, I make just as written.  Phenomenal and easy dessert that holds up even a few days later!

This recipe was delicious (but I tweeked it a bit)!  I added heavy whipping cream with 2 tbs of sugar to the pudding mixture instead of cool whip. I also sprinkled Hershey's chocolate syrup on the brownie layer with Reeses ice cream toppings (sprinkles) between each layer.  My coworkers went crazy over it!  This dessert makes a beautiful presentation & was very rich! I loved every bite!

OMG this was sooooo good. As other reviews, I added fresh whipped cream with the chocolate mixture as well as drizzled caramel topping on top of the brownies and some crumbles of Butterfinger candies bars.  On the top just drizzled a little caramel and Butterfinger candies . It turned out great and everyone loved it.

Fabulous!!  First time I made this I followed the recipe and it was entirely too sweet.  The second time I made it I followed the suggestions of other reviewers.  I made a fudgey brownie and for the chocolate pudding layer I used half a pint of heavy whipping cream.  I whipped the cream and added the chocolate fudge pudding mix and water to it.  I also layered crushed oreos between the chocolate whipped cream and the regular whipped cream.  In my opinon the oreos were what made it in the end.  If you make this it MUST be made a day in advance!

OH MY GOD. I wanted to make a trifle, because I'd never had, and I had a Pampered Chef trifle dish to try, etc etc. I saw this recipe and decided to make and serve it at a little dinner party we were having last Saturday. First of all, it looked SO PRETTY in the dish. Second... IT TASTED AWESOME! Third....IT WAS EASY. Fourth...EVERYONE LOVED IT. All in all, I will be making this wonderful yummy dessert again and again. THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!!!

I added a drizzle of coffee caramel sauce (by Stonewall kitchen) and a light sprinkling of crumbled Heathbar (two bars total used) on top of the brownie layer.  Also took the suggestion of using whipped heavy cream in with the pudding mix.  So, brownie layer, coffee caramel sauce, heathbar, chocolate pudding, cool whip, and repeat.  Topped it with a sprinkling of heathbar for decoration.

I'm sure this would have been good as is, but with changes was GREAT! I took the advice of previous reviewers and used 1 pint of heavy cream, whipped with 5-6 tbsp of sugar and 1 tsp. of vanilla. I also drizzled caramel ice cream topping over the brownie layers and topped the whipped topping layers with toffee bits. Make sure it sits overnight. It is very sweet and rich, so some may prefer it after a light meal only. My GF said it was 10 stars :)

Wow! I just had to write about this dish. I made this for dessert when I had my family/in-laws over for dinner,It was my first time making chocolate trifle and we were not disappointed. It was very easy to make and is a family favorite. Some reviews say this is to sweet but I say wash it down with a little milk and you be good to go. Thank you for the fantastic recipe.

I make this for a community dinner the Grange puts on once a year.  This is perfect when asked to bring a desert for 20 people.  I assemble individual ones in clear solid plastic cups (7-8oz), and they look wonderful.  Kids love this desert.  Whipped topping, pudding, and brownies....yum.

Awesome!!  Even better if you add toffee chips and chopped pecans to brownie mix and mini chocolate chips to pudding mix.  Then top final layer of whipped topping w/ toffee chips and chocolate syrup!!!

By far...the BEST DESSERT I have ever had!!!! Every time I make this...we never have any leftover. I followed the suggestion from another user and in the pudding layer, instead of folding in the whipped topping, I bought half a pint of heavy whipping cream and whipped that for about 10 minutes myself and then folded that into the pudding. I have trouble finding it...but vanilla flavored cool whip is the best on this! I am not a huge fan of vanilla flavored foods...but it is just the right amount on this rich chocolate treat! I have also used brownies with peanut butter chips in them and that was a big hit too! So yummy!!!

This recipe was delicious! I changed a few things, I used chocolate mouse (Martha Stewart recipe) instead of chocolate pudding, and it added to the fluffy and lightness of the trifle.  I also used Martha's fudge brownie recipe.

I love this recipe!  I had a trifle bowl for years, but had never used it.  This recipe gave me an excuse to put it to good use.  I added a couple of tweaks when I made the recipe.  I followed the suggestions made by the top reviewer.  I made my own whipped cream and added Bailey's Irish Cream to it for extra flavor.  I also added cherry pie filling to the layers for the extra pop of color.  I will definitely make this one again for a special occasion.

Good concept but definitely needs some tweaking. I followed the exact recipe the first time I made it (except I used Oreo pudding instead of chocolate) and I agree with others that this dessert is WAY too sweet (sickeningly sweet). HOWEVER it is absolutely necessary to let it sit overnight -- this drastically changes the taste and makes it way better. Still, I changed it up a bit the 2nd time: 1. I got rid of the whipped topping altogether. 2. To balance out the sweetness, I used real whipped cream and a moist chocolate cake instead of brownies. I also reduced the condensed milk to half the amount and used regular milk for the other half. I wouldn't advise omitting the condensed milk entirely, because that's what gives the pudding a more firm/silky texture, but definitely leave the whipped topping out. I liked it much better this way.

My husband said this was the best desert I'd made in a long time!!! I didn't use the sweetened condensed milk, I used skim milk only. I also used 4 Reeses cups and chopped them up, I put some in the middle and some on top. It was really good, and even better the next day! I will definitely make this again. Thanks for a great recipe.

I have made a variation of this several times and I am always asked to make this.  Try sprinkling Kahlua over the brownie layers.  Also, use white chocolate pudding mix and combine with the cool whip to combine the pudding and cool whip layer.  Freezing the Heath bars and crushing them is much easier, or just use a package of Skor bits.  Yum...great recipe, very very easy!!

This was amazingly good! I used fat free Cool Whip. I didn't use any sweetened condensed milk. This was perfect! It tasted like chocolate mousse with brownies!

For me this was a three star dessert because it tasted like brownies with whipped cream and thick chocolate custard. It was also too rich for me and made me feel a little sick. Hubby on the other hand loved it LOVED IT loved it. He kept repeating 'this is good, this is goooood' lol. He gave 4 1/2 stars, but the man rarely ever gives a 4. It tasted a hundred times better the next day - like all trifles do - the flavours had a chance to meld together.  So, all up I'm giving this 4 stars and I will try to enhance the recipe for a Christmas dessert. UPDATE: I made a chocolate cake for a party and the bottom half stuck to the pan, perfectly cooked even though I greased it. I used the cake cut up in chunks in this recipe. Dh said as he was eating it, "Thank goodness for stuff ups." I used chocolate custard, 1/2 tin cond. milk, and whipped cream for the chocolate layer. Cake, chocolate cream, chopped macadamias, whipped cream, crumbled violet crumble bar and repeat until all finished. So, if you mess a cake up and it's still cooked, try this recipe. Oh yeah, don't eat until it sits in the fridge for 2-3 days. Perrrffection!!!!

Highly Recommended!  I added raspberries (see photo) and it just made it perfect.  I used fat free/sugar free instant pudding too.  My boxes weren't the same measurements as the ingredients list states but I used 2 boxes and it came out good.  Simple recipe and it looks like it took forever!

Amazing! It is very sweet, but it is still awesome. I have made it twice now and the second time I made it with real whipped cream to cut down on some of the sweetness. Also I put strawberries on top and its delicious that way.

I'm giving this three stars, but it really depends on your audience.  I made it with the heath topping/caramel/real whip cream for mousse and vanilla cool whip for a work party.  It seems to be something that the older crowd liked--I got huge compliments on it from them.  The younger crowd was scared of it I think, and honestly, it tasted like chocolate pudding and whipped cream--not that 'wow!' really.  Also, the heath bits looked sort of like peanuts to some people so they didn't try it, beware of that if you go that route.

This is super easy to  make, really delicious, and a real crowd pleaser! I made a few adjustments: 1) fat-free cool whip, 2) fat-free condensed milk, and 3) sliced strawberries instead of candy. Its a great method and I can't wait to try other variations!

I just made this for a baby shower at work.  The bowl was completely empty in about 10 minutes!  I used the suggestions of others... (whipping cream, caramel, sliced strawberries, mini chocolate chips and French vanilla cool whip) and it was absolutely perfect.  I was able to make three layers instead of two and it filled the bowl right up to the top.  The way everyone is talking about it I'm sure I will be making this again and again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

We are chocolate lovers so we thought this was great!  Sometimes I add toffee bits or add walnuts to the brownies for a little crunch.  My next plan is to try making with blonde brownies with butterscotch chips and using a butterscotch pudding.

This review is a little late, but I've been making this since last year for christmas!! It is one of the easiest desserts to make ever!!! I'm always the desingnated one for dessert!!! I have people begging me for this recipe!!! I follow it exactly but did try the vanilla whip cream but really didn't care to much for it and I also LOVE putting caramel and chocolate suyrup in the layers to give it an extra kick!! Works like a charm everytime!! Will be making this for years!!!

I am asked to bring this to every family get-together for my Husband's family.  I follow the recipe but add frozen strawberries.  I let the strawberries defrost and then put them on top of the plain cool whip layers, except the top.  I usually put about 4 strawberries in the middle on the top and then put M&M's around the edge.  It looks pretty and tastes sooooo good!

This recipe was super simple and fabulous!  I whipped my own cream to fold into the pudding mixture as per other reviewers suggestions.  I also used french vanilla whipped topping as well.  To break up the monotany of chocolate, I cut in 2 bananas to each layer for a total of 4 bananas.  Perfectly delicious!

This recipe is a DISASTER!!! Do NOT make it.  I followed other reviewers opinions by making my own whipped cream and I ended up with a chocolate paste.  It has yet to be eaten so there is a chance I will update my review.  This recipe is extremely time consumig to make and in my opinion shouldn't even be on this website.

I have smoked pumpkin pie every Thanksgiving with this recipe.  Just about made my sister-in-law cry when no one wanted her lowfat pumpkin pie.  Made it exactly to recipe, making sure to use a 9x13 pan so that there was enough brownie chunks for multiple layers.  The only change I made was to use mini chocolate chips instead of the shaved chocolate.  Even a novice like myself can bring this dessert and get everyone talking!!

This was okay, but it didn't really impress me.  I can see how children might like this but it wasn't great.  If your idea of a great dessert is Jello Pudding mix with cool whip then you would like this, but you could save yourself some energy and just make the pudding and cool whip.

I followed this recipe exactly and the result was amazing. It's pretty fool proof and looks nice enough to impress your guests. I was a little concerned when I mixed together the pudding, water, and condensed milk because there were tiny little lumps in the mixture but, in the end, I didn't even notice them. The only problem I had was with shaving the candy bar before it melted all over me. Maybe it would help to regrigerate it slightly before shaving but not so long as to make it brittle. I'm going to make this next time I have guests over.

What a wonderful recipe! When I make this I add chopped pecans and heath bits on top of the whipped topping. It is also great with homemade whipped cream in place of the whipped topping as many others have stated.

This was excellent.  Quite messy but well worth it.  Next time I would probably make a point of using the low fat/sugar free versions of the main ingredients.  I thought it was quite rich and could be taken down a notch by using "healthier" ingredients.

Great recipe.   I prefer to make this a day ahead. The chocolate pudding mixture seems mousse-like after it has been refrigerated for a day. It would probably be good with french vanilla flavored cool whip too.

This is AMAZING!! Everyone LOVED it! I took someone's advice and drizzled some warm caramel over the brownies when layering it and I used Heath bar (all smashed up)over the cool whip layer to give it some more texture. It was SOOOO yummy, I have been asked for the recipe 3 times in a week!

Wonderful! This was the most popular dessert at my baby shower. I used the Betty Crocker brand of brownie mix, which is my personal favorite. Sooo delish!

A huge holiday hit!  Everyone called it sinful and went on and on!  
I followed some of the advice of the other reviews and made my own whipped cream using 1/2 pint of whipping cream and 3 TBS of sugar.  I then folded that (instead of the cool whip) into the pudding mixture.  
A couple layers of toffee chips added a bit of crunch and extra flavor!
I also added an extra egg into the brownie mixture to make it more cake like and extremely moist!  People didn't stop talking about it!!! 
Great recipe!

This was super rich, but I followed some of the advice of others, and instead of folding cool whip into the pudding mixture, I whipped 1/2 a pint heavy cream for 10 minutes and then folded into the pudding mixture.  I also drizzled caramel (the kind for ice cream) over the brownies as I was layering and topped the dish off with heath toffee pieces.  This was a fun and yummy recipe...thanks for sharing it.

I made this for a family gathering this weekend and it was a huge hit! I used 3 eggs for the brownies to make it softer and added cut up kit kat bars on top of the cool whip layers. For the topping I added additional kit kat pieces and shaved milk chocolate Hershy bars. This is now a new family fav.
Thank You!!

I made this for a dinner party. It was soooo good! However, in my opinion, a critical change is using a bag of Heath toffee peices (1/2 layered on top of the first whip cream layer and the rest on the very top) instead of the chocolate curls. As the dish sits in the fridge, some of the toffee moistens into the most yummy caramel, while other pieces stay crunchy. It is a wonderful addition to all the chocolate and whip cream layers. Try it! I promise you'll love it this way!

This is a good recipe, but not my favorite. It was a little too sweet. I served to 4 guests, and they didn't go for seconds. The sweetened condensed milk is a bit much. I think making my own whipped cream with heavy whipping cream will lighten the dessert. Brownies were good, but for a lighter dessert I might use chocolate cake instead next time. Good for some, but I'll be doing lots of modifications.

THIS WAS WONDERFUL!!!  EVERYBODY LOVED IT...SCRAPPED THE BOWL...I READ SOME OTHER COMMENTS THAT WERE LEFT AND MADE A FEW SUBSTITUTIONS AS WELL...AND WOULDNT CHANGE A THING.  MY FIRST LAYER WAS HALF THE BROWNIES AS STATED, BUT I COOKED THE BROWNIES IN A PAN LINED WITH CARMEL & ALSO FOLDED THE CARMEL ON TOP OF THE BROWIES, SECOND LAYER WAS HALF THE CHOC PUDDING MIX AS STATED AGAIN I MIXED THE PUDDING MIX WITH THE COND. MILK AND ETRA CREAMY WHIPPED TOPPING, THEN THE NEXT LAYER WITH THE WHIPED TOPPING I LAYERED IT WITH TOFFEE AND CARMEL SWIRLS...REPEATED THE LAYERS AND ON THE TOP LAYER I DECORATED IT WITH THE TOFFEE CHIPS, CARMEL SWIRLS AND MINI PEANUT BUTTER CUPS....YUMMMMMM : )
AND AS IF IT WASNT GOOD ENOUGH...NEXT TIME I MIGHT ADD ONE LAYER IN THE MIDDLE OF MARSHMELLOW FLUFF...JUST TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS, BECAUSE THE WAY I DID IT WAS WONDERFUL IN ITS SELF.

OK, so I didn't think this was great at first, but the taste is definetly in the wait!!  I made this 2 days ahead of time, and it tasted just OK on the day I served it.  BUT, after sitting for 5 days, this was AWESOME!!!  Like others, I just followed the directions on the pudding box and used real whipped cream with vanilla and a tad bit of sugar whipped in.  Impressive and easy dessert.  I would double this recipe next time and fill the trifle bowl ALL the way up (my Pampered Chef trifle bowl only got 2/3's of the way filled up--which is fine if you don't want seconds!).

This is definitely NOT  for people watching their weight! (me).  You only need a small portion because it is so sweet - and this is coming from a sweets lover!  It's very delicious but I'm positive I could feel my waist expanding with every spoonful.

This recipe was hands-down the best dessert my office has ever had!  The presentation was great and the comments that I received included "down right ridiculous"! I added a layer of strawberries on the first layer of cool-whip and crushed heath bar on top.  Thank you!

When I first made this review, I had only tasted it after it sat for 24 hours and thought it okay.  THEN I tried it again after more than 36 hours and it made quite a difference! Next time, I will make changes as others have suggested, such as caramel sauce in between the layers, maybe some fruit - something to add some pizazz to it.  My family seemed to like it, but there was a lot left (hmmm, maybe cause there were lots of desserts to choose from?) I will definitely make it again - thanks for the recipe.

This was okay - nothing special. It tasted exactly like the combination of prepackaged ingredients it is, and I prefer a more homemade flavor. Still, if you like chocolate pudding and cool whip, perhaps this is for you.

Excellent!  I used Ghirridelli (sp?) brownie mix.  I love the "mousse" which is a nice switch from the boring puddings that most trifles call for in their recipes; however, I think the recipe needed something to break up the richness of the dessert so I added a few layers of fresh raspberries and omitted the candybar...perfection! Thank you so much!

Loved this!  We made it with sugar-free pudding and Lite Cool Whip.  We also topped it with Heath bar bits.  So good.  One tip:  be sure your whipped topping is nice and cold or it will runn everywhere (still tastes good, though!).

This recipe was amazing.....I was looking for something different for our Christmas dinner and I found this and tried it.  I can't even explain how much everyone raved about this dessert.  One person told me that I should make it and sell it by the plate. I now have a new favorite and most requested dessert for every holiday and function.
Thank you!!!

I made this two days in a row for different parties and the response was phenomenal. Many people asked for the recipe to make on their own. When I made it, though, I followed the ideas of others and used heavy whip instead of cool whip and added strawberries on top of the cool whip layer above the chocolate layer. The strawberries mixed well with the chocolate and gave it some texture.

Very good, but very rich.  A little goes a long way!!!  My 6 and 11 year lod made this with a little help from me for a Christmas Eve family get-to-gether and it was a hit.  They put crushed candycanes on top.

Awesome recipe, the only thing is that one brownie mix package is not nearly enough to complete this recipe.  

I guess I had a really large bowl that I used, because I had to basically double this recipe to fill the bowl.  I used one brownie mix package, and one white case mix package, two packages each of vanilla pudding and chocolate pudding.  Then layered, cake & brownies, vanilla pudding, chocolate pudding, whipping cream, and repeated those layers twice more.

This was my first time making this type of dessert. the family loved it. they said it reminded them of a chocolate mousse type pie. It wasn't too sweet. Very nice presentation. Even though I arrived for dinner late, it was mostly gone when I left. The other desserts had only been barely touched! As one reviewer once said "Nothing says good,than gone!!!!

It IS too sweet.  But I still love it!  Maybe we could use UNsweetened condensed milk and then add a little sugar, but not too much.  Then it would be just as easy, but we could control how sweet it is a little bit more.

I made this for a lady's birthday at work and it was amazing! I'll definitely make it again. Something this delicious shouldn't be so easy to make!

This recipe is soooo delicious. I loved it and my husband made sure he let's me know that he loved it just as much as i did. I used the BEST BROWNIES recipe from this site, and didn't have any condensed milk, nor do they have instant chocolate pudding where i am. So i used regular ready made chocolate pudding (dark) and chocolate cookie pudding (light). I layered it this way. 1. brownies. 2. dark pudding 3.light pudding. 4. dark pudding. 5 brownies. 6 whipped cream. 7. chocolate chip morsels. 
This is definately a keeper. I love the idea. Next time i will try it with fresh strawberries somewhere in between.

Yuck! I used 4 oz. LESS whip cream than the recipe called for and it was still so sickly sweet with whip cream that we had to throw away the entire bowl. What a dissapointment!

If I could rate this a 10 I would, the bowl will be empty after you put it out.  I've been making this for years but a little different version.  A few less items then the original recipe calls for and you may have them in your pantry.   I use 2 cans of already prepapred pudding or 8 - 9 little handipacks of pudding and just one 8oz tub of whipped topping and pan of brownies. Chop up a chocolate bar and add between layers of brownie and pudding.  Shave chocolate on last later of whipped topping.  Any way you make this you won't be disappointed.

Very yummy!  My husband doesn't like these kind of desserts, and he loved this!  I added chopped oreos in both layers.  I made it for a gathering of 6 adults and it was almost entirely gone by the end of the night!

This is an awesome dessert.  I have been making it regularly for over a year now!!  I always get rave reviews and everyone wants the recipe.

I made this for Halloween and colored the white cool whip orange and layered crushed oreos between the orange cool whip and second brownie layer and then put crushed oreos on top.  Added some Milano cookies cut in 1/2 with "RIP" written on them as headstones, and added some gummy worms for a very cute Halloween dessert.
You absolutely can't go wrong with this recipe!!

This is a wonderful dessert. I took this to a potluck at work and was devoured in now time. Everyone wanted the recipe. The only thing I did different was layered crushed heath bars or score candy bars with the choc. pudding and some on top. This gave a little crunch to go along with the soft brownies. This is a very sweet dessert so a little goes along way on your plate. But so good!!!!! Thanks for the recipe Wayne!

Can I just first of all say that my husband loves this recipe more than he loves me. Seriously, if we were getting divorced, he would give me all his assets just to have this recipe. He raves about it all over town to his friends, but his friends never get any because he eats it all before they can get any. This is really a great recipe.

WOW WOW WOW!  The only suggestion I have for this recipe is that it could use a little crunch.  The next time I make it, I think I'll top it with chopped nuts.

WOW!!!  This is really amazing!  I used heavy whipping cream instead of cool whip for the chocolate mixture so it wasn't so sweet and it was perfect!  I sliced some strawberries that were about to go bad and put them in the layers.  Oh boy is it ever good!  Next time I might try layering caramel in stead of fruit.  (BTW,  I added no sugar to the heavy cream when I whipped it :)

I made this for Christmas and it was a big hit.
Nobody found it too sweet.  I used a chocolate fudge brownie mix and baked them in a 9x13 pan.  Cut them into 1 inch squares and put double layers of brownies in the trifle.  It was very very yummy.

What a pretty dessert!  I used white chocolate pudding and 1/2 cup of strong, brewed coffee in place of the water.  I also sprinkled toffee bits on the whipped topping layers.  Served it to the non-pumpkin pie eating crowd at Thanksgiving...I caught the pumpkin-eaters enjoying it too!

This was a great dessert, but rich!  I made the mistake of substituting whipped topping for the real whipped cream and you could tell the difference - still good though.

Made this for my family's big Christmas Eve get together. Used Ghirardelli boxed brownie mix, which is the best, used half the amount of sweetened condensed milk and the other half whole milk, made my own whipped cream instead of cool whip. Put chopped nuts on top. Sooo good!

I followed the suggestions to use 1/2 pint whipping cream in the chocolate pudding mixture, but I still used frozen whipped topping for the layer. I also added a can of cherry pie filling on top of the cool whip layer so I had four layers instead of three, that way it tasted good and it looked great in the trifle bowl! Overall this deseret tasted good but it is really heavy and sweet for me.  A few bites is all you need.  My husband (a chocaholic) loved it and begged me to make it again.

This was PERFECT. Once a month I cook dinner for your staff at our church youth group.  There are about 30 youth workers. It was so fun to see ALL of them SAVORING this dessert. Some asked that I make this every month. I made this the night before. I was lucky enough to have leftovers and rewarded my self durning nap time. Thanks for this recipe it has won me many friends.

I have made this recipie to bring to cookouts twice in the past month. I have gotten rave reviews at both parties. They love the moose-like mixture it really makes the dish. The only thing I added was a straight pudding layer and only because my trifle bowl was to big. Thanks for this recipie I will use over and over!

I thought this was very good but some of my guests for dinner thought it was too sweet.  I used a trifle dish and made three layers instead of the two.  I wish I would have left it as two because it seemed like every time I took a scoop out for someone it was all cream, not brownie.

I followed the advice of others and used real whipped cream.  I also added a block of low-fat cream cheese to the pudding mixture.  I gave this to my best friend for her birthday as she is a choc-o-holic.  She was thrilled and declared that she was not going to share!

This recipe was so yummy and easy! I undercooked the brownies slightly to add to their chewiness and richness. The only thing I might add for cruch is a some broken up heath or skor bars. Or maybe even some nuts. It is a keeper - great for parties!

This is a very attractive and easy to make desert. I and my guests did however find it a trifle (no pun intended, ha) sweet. I think I will try the suggestions from Christina the next time I make. All in all it was delicious!!

This has to be the most awesome dessert recipe I have ever made!  It is just perfect the way it is! I bought the new Allrecipes.com cookbook and found this recipe in it. When I seen the photo of this trifle, I  knew I  had to make it!  Well, my husband and I just love it. I made it last night and just between the 2 of us, 1/2 of the bowl is already gone!  I plan on making this for our church Christmas Party this Saturday and cannot wait for everyone to try it!  If this trifle were the only thing I was to ever make from that cookbook, then I have to say the cookbook is worth every single penny just for this recipe! I wish I could give it more than 5 stars!

I made this trifle form Thanksgiving yesterday, but prepared it the night before.  I was such a hit.  There was also 2 pumpkin pies, 2 apple pies, pumpkin bars and a cheesecake.  The trifle was completely gone (people were scraping the sides of the bowl) and the other stuff barely got touched.  Great Recipe!  I will DEFINITELY make it again.

Yum! I went the extra mile when making this lovely dessert for dinner guests and whipped my own cream rather than using whipped topping. Hope you're not counting calories!

The finished product tasted great.  When making this, I found the pudding layer 
to be very runny.  When I layered it in the trifle bowl, it sunk down and covered the
brownies so it looked like I only had 2 layers instead of 3.  Because the brownies 
and the pudding become sort of 1 layer, I had to buy more cool whip for the top 
so it would reach near the top of the trifle bowl.  Also beware of the melting factor.
If you leave this out of the refrigerator for too long the pudding layer becomes 
all runny again.  As long as it stays cold, the trifle stays in a firm state.

This was amazing, I made it for a party but had to make some last minute improvises. I thought I had chocolate pudding but was wrong. I had vanilla. So I folded in vanilla with nutella and if you are using heath bar which was suggested by a reviewer.. The nutella  paired perfectly and added this needed element to it.. This is an amazing recipe!!

I was asked to make a trifle, and everyone liked it. So it's a crowed pleaser. Personally, all the packaged and boxed ingredients made me think of something I would eat at a school cafeteria. Overly sweet and one-note. Still, others liked it.

The "next" generation is responsible for cooking for our large family Christmas get-together, so my daughter chose this recipe. Her only change was using pre-made deli brownies (iced), using "lite" whipped topping (it's actually a bit richer than the regular), and adding about 2 tablespoons of instant coffee granules to the chocolate mixture. It was fantastic! And it feeds a LOT of people! Perfect recipe for beginner cooks and a hit dessert!

Reading other reviews, I decided to use 1/2 pint heavy whipping cream instead of the 8 oz. frozen whipped cream and it was still too sweet.

If you like chocolate it is wonderful but the second layer could have cherry pie filling then the  cream then chocolate cake again then more cream topped with maraschino cherries strategically placed.

I have a similar recipe for this trifle which includes one layer of strawberry preserves, 1 layer of devils food cake (cooked and cubed)  
the chocolate pudding, and cool whip.   Then I began a second layer of each.

I made this recipe once but changed it. Instead of putting whipped topping in the chocolate mixture, I put a half a pint of heavy cream and beat it for a minute or until it gets thicker. It is WAY too sweet when you make it with the whipped topping.

Ok, I don't believe I am going to say this....but this was WAY too much chocolate!!  Don't get me wrong, it isn't horrible and I can see how other people absolutely loved it but it was just too much for me (and even my kids!) and it was definitely too sweet.

Most of those who rated this high tweaked the recipe so the overall rating is misleading. I made this exactly as per recipe and found it too sweet. It could have all been changed with omitting the condensed milk and just making the pudding as the box directions. I can guarantee it would have made 5 stars otherwise in my book!

This recipe does not need a review to know it is good.  How can you go wrong with layers of Brownies, Chocolate Pudding and Whipped Topping???  It is every bit as good as you would imagine, no surprises at all.  The kids raved about it and protested when it was gone.

I followed the advice of Roxanne323 and added heavy cream in place of cool whip.  I also doubled the ingredients because there was a lot of people I was serving.  It was a major hit, so easy to make and DELICIOUS!!

Delicious! I skipped the water and condensed milk and made pudding as directed, after folding in the cool whip it created a chocolate mousse layer. Yummy! Also layered caramel and crushed heath bar.
A huge hit at parties!

This is amazing!  I had a couple modifications that other reviewers suggested.  I added caramel sauce and chopped butterfinger pieces after the whipped cream layer.  I also made my own whipped cream using a recipe from this site to mix with the pudding, and then used french vanilla cool whip to layer.  Still very rich, but delicious.  Everyone loved it.  Doesn't last long even though it makes a ton!  Only problem with this dessert is that its a little expensive--but well worth it!!

I was excited to try this but I never got past the pudding stage, made the way the recipe stated, I just had a goopy weird substance that did not resemble anything I could put in a trifle and was so sweet it was nauseating. I tried this because of the high reviews- thought I'd share my disappointing experience.

4 Stars as writted, excellent Dessert. After tasting the original recipe, I decided to make a couple changes the next time I made it. I added Caramel on top of the brownies, and put Toffee chips on top of the cool whip layers, this turned an already wonderful creation into what my family and friends refer to as Death by Chocolate. Even my godson brought in the makings for a home ec class for a project. everyone loved it.

Fabulous!  I had never made a trifle before, but I had to make desserts for a crowd and wanted to bring something that looked fantastic.  I followed the recipe, but I used a store-bought fudgy brownie and cut it into small squares.  I also crumbled Oreo cookies over the first three layers for added texture.  Everyone loved it, and I will definitely make it again.

At first I was giving this 3 stars because I wasnt't all that impressed with it.  I only had it in the refrigerator about 6 hrs before we ate it.  I had it again today and it definitely got better after it sat.  Im still not in love with it, however.  I followed it to a T because I don't like to alter recipes often until I try the original version first.  My husband and I found this very rich and sweet.  If I do make it again, I will use homemade whipped cream, since many reviewers have done this and feel its better that way and I might omit the condensed milk and use regular milk, since it was so sweet.  I may also add some caramel to break up the monotony of all the chocolate, which is odd since I am a huge chocolate lover.

I made this dessert for a family bbq this past weekend and it was a hit. It was a last minute decision to make this Trifle, and becasue I was pressed for time I used a couple packages of Two-Bite Brownies instead of the brownie mix. Following the advice of many other reviews I drizzled each brownie layer with caramel syrup and used real whipped cream for pudding mixture. I used a crushed up Skor bar for the top. I will make this again for sure, next time I will try it with homemade brownies.

Very good and very easy to make. I think next time I will try doing whipped cream as other reviewers suggested, just to see the difference. This recipe is definitely a crowd pleaser as written.

This was very, very good.  I made it for several potlucks and family get-togethers and I always bring the bowl home empty....The only minor substitute I used was to use mini chocolate chips as my garnish instead of shaving a chocolate bar.  Awesome dessert!

I made this for Christmas with a few changes.  Instead of fake whipped topping, I used real light whipped cream in the can and left off the top layer until serving.  I also poured a little hazelnut liqueur over the brownies as I layered and used  chocolate pudding that was already mixed up in containers for ease of prep.   This was so easy, it turned out fabulous!

I definitely agree that it was very "processed" tasting, like another cook said. But I guess, what should I expect? Lol! Anyway, if you're used to processed foods, I'm sure it's fantastic. For those who aren't, I would at least advise homemade whipped cream (REALLY easy) and pudding.

I omitted condensed milk, used a tablespoon of caramel topping spread over the cake before cutting, and subbed heavy whipping cream for cool whip. Used Heath chips as suggested. However, the serving size was ENORMOUS..i could not even fit half a cake in my trifle despite multiple layers. Best for a big party, and even then, it's so filling it still may not get finished. I like the flavor but in a house with only six people, i know it will get wasted :((  Ingredient cost: cake mix 1.79, 3 eggs 0.60, caramel topping  2.09 jar (0.20 in recipe), pudding 0.65, heavy cream 1.89, heath chips 2.49 (0.50 in recipe). Total cost: $5.63 for recipe/$8.91 for full size ingredients.

First time I've ever made a trifle and it turned out amazing! It was the only desert touched at our family Christmas. I added fresh raspberries on top and people really liked that tartness to break up the sweet. I also used Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free 20oz brownies and not one person could tell the difference. They said the brownies were perfect!

I took this trifle to a church potluck, and like many of you had lots of rave reviews.  I did make a few tweaks. To save time, I purchased brownies from the bakery department at my grocery store. I followed the suggestions for adding freshly whipped cream to the pudding mix and layered with plain whipped cream.  But, to add a holiday twist I sprinkled crushed peppermint sticks on the plain whipped cream and toffee bits on the chocolate whipped cream layer.

I made a double batch of this recipe, using Ghirardelli Triple Chocolate brownie mix from Costco. Even after 2 days, the brownie didn't soak up moisture from the pudding and whipped cream. The pudding was too sweet and the brownie was too dry... perhaps chocolate cake would have worked better.

Hosted party then found my husband eating it for breakfast the next morning ~ everyone loved it.  Few adjustments: Mixed pudding, water & sweetened condensed milk then in separate bowl whipped 1/2 pt heavy cream... then folded in the cream w/the pudding mixture.  Layered brownies, caramel syrup, heath toffee bits, choc. whipped cream, then cool whip & repeated.  Options: substitue baileys for water... add strawberries to toffee layer??

After making the One Bowl Brownie recipe from this site and attempting to broil some marshmallows on top of it in the oven and starting an oven fire which nearly amounted to an apartment fire, I had to find a way to salvage the brownies when voila!---I came upon this wonderful recipe.  It was quick, easy, and you can really add anything to it that you want.  I topped mine with chopped almond rocca sitting around which gave it the perfect crunch.  I could practically eat the chocolate pudding on its own =).  Next time, I will drizzle caramel on top of the brownies (which I completely forgot to do the first time).  What a happy ending to a horrible brownie story!

This has been a family favorite for years!  To break up the sweetness of the chocolate, I had a thick layer of fresh sliced strawberries in between the two layers.  It not only tastes amazing but looks beautiful with a layer of red in the center.  I also sprinkle the top with the heath bar pieces sold in the Chocolate chip section of the grocery store.  Great Recipe!

I made this to bring to a cookout and it was a huge hit! A lot of other reviewers found the pudding mix too sweet, but I have a huge sweet tooth and thought it was fine. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 only because I wasn't a huge fan of using brownies. I've made trifles before and usually use chocolate cake, which I prefer. The edges of the brownies were a bit tough compared to the rest of the textures. Edges could be cut off, but then there wouldnt be enough brownie for the dessert and 2 boxes would probably need to be used. Other than that, delish!

This is a delicious recipe.  I did refrigerate the pudding mixture before layering to make it less runny, which makes the layers look neater. I also included sliced strawberries and toffee chips on top of the pudding layer.  It was absolutely yummy!

This was FANTASTIC! it looks pretty too! I did take somebodys advice and instead of putting cool whip in with the pudding i whipped 1/2 pint of heavy whipping cream and used that instead. it was really creamy and i could tell it made a difference.  my boyfriend doesnt even really like sweets, but he LOVED this. this will be a regular.

This is soooo good.  It is awfully sweet thou, 1/2 cup serving per person is good I'd say.  Next time I'll use sugar free puddings & cool whip.  Thanks for sharing!

I hate when people review a recipe based on the alterations they made to it.  I made this exactly as written and while it was SUPER sweet for me, I got rave reviews!  I think if I make it again, I wouldn't make the pudding with the evaporated milk or might try making my own whipped cream.

This is one of the best chocolate desserts I have ever eaten!  And I love chocolate.  It was so easy to prepare and I was able to make it a day ahead of time as it is better if it sits all day or night.

I make this for small group events all the time. Everyone loves it and request it by name. I had to buy a second trifle dish. I changed the recipe and I don't use sweetened condensed milk.  I follow the instant pudding mix directions and use real milk.  I often sprinkle heath bar on top, or m &ms depending on  the season.

My husband LOVES this!! I use real whipping cream instead of Cool Whip as the flavor is so much better Also, use a good quality brownie mix, or make your own. I made this several times over the summer and it is always a hit. How can you go wrong with Brownies, chocolate and cream?!?!

This trifle is far too sweet, I hardley tasted the chocolate. I may make it again but replace it with a different chocolate cream recipe and use whipped cream over the whipped topping.

I used someone elses suggestion of layering brownies, carmel, heath toffey bits, pudding mixture, and whipped cream.  It was very good.  I mixed the pudding and water, then whipped in 1/2 pint heavy cream instead of stiring in whipped cream.  I have a large trifle bowl, so I had to use 2 boxes of pudding and 1 pint of heavy cream.  It was gone so quickly I didn't even get any, but everyone enjoyed it very much.

This recipe is fantastic for chocolate lovers! I did as several others had suggested and added caramel topping. Yum! I could eat just the chocolate layer straight out of the bowl, but its worth it to put the whole dessert together!

When I want to impress someone I make this dessert! I use brownies with chocolate chunks in them already for more chocolate, and I chop up strawberries (fresh or frozen) and put them in there!

Way too sweet!!  This looks pretty, but isn't very good.  The only thing that made the taste was the brownies.  I am so surprised that so many rave about this recipe.  Maybe if you made it with a mousse instead of pudding & sweetened condensed milk.  If you want to try this at all, don't add any sweetened condensed milk!

This is a great and easy recipe!  I did change a few things, as per other's suggestions (and some of my own).  First, instead of using brownies, I used leftover "Too much chocolate cake" (a recipe from this site).  Then I had frozen raspberries that I had picked over the summer.  I put those in a bowl with some sugar. As the berries unthawed it created a raspberry syrup.  I drizzled this syrup over each layer of cake.  For the pudding mixture, I made my own whipped cream to add in instead of the cool whip.  I beat 1 cup of heavy cream, 1/4 cup of confectioners sugar, and a splash of vanilla (and then folded it in).  For the cool whip layers, I used french vanilla.  Then, right before I served it, I strategically placed the raspberries on top.  Not only did it taste great, but it looked amazing too!

Mmm!  This was such a decadent recipe that was easy to prepare.  Followed the directions pretty straight forward.  The only thing I changed was I used fresh whipped cream instead of whipped topping; not a fan of cool whip. I decided to use Heath bars between the layers for an added crunch.

I followed all the reviewers suggestions and it still came out too sweet and sticky.  I made the pudding with the sweetened condensed milk and regular milk first, then blended it with whipped heavy cream.  I also used caramel over the brownies and toffee bits and french vanilla cool whip.  Next time I will SKIP the caramel and reduce the condensed milk by half and use regular cool whip.  Sorry but the toffee bits have to stay... Then it will be just right!  Otherwise what a beautiful dish!

This was excellent!  The only changes that I made was to make home made brownies.  I made brooks best bombshell brownies from this site and to use real whip cream not the artificial stuff.  I did not add sugar to the whip cream that I folded into to pudding because of the sugar in the pudding mix and the sweetened condensed milk.  It was perfect.  Not to sweet My guest loved it and ate it up and took doggy bags.

Need to rename this "A diabetic coma waiting to happen!  *LOL* As with others I "trifled" with this recipe.  (Do you think that is where the term originated?) I did make my own whipped cream to mix with the pudding as suggested, drizzled the brownie layer with caramel topping, and layered Heath toffee bits between the chocolate and white cream layer.  I did intend to buy the French vanila whipped topping, but my store didn't carry it. So here is my own twist on this recipe! I added praline liqueur to the Cool Whip and beat it. Oh my, it was PERFECT with the caramel and toffee.  To a 16 oz container I only added 6 "bottle cap" fulls, so no one is going to leave in a stupor as a result of the alcohol.  Cool Whip never tasted so good!

Amazing!!! Made for X-Mas Eve & everyone loved it! Some said that it was the best they ever had. Followed other suggestions and used french vanilla cool whip and choc cool whip instead of the reg flavor. Crushed up 2 to 3 Heath bars and put in between layers. Added a great crunch! Could put 4 to 5 reg sized bars depending on preference to the taste of Heath. Would definately make again!

After tasting the pudding mixture, I decided I wanted more chocolate flavor, so I whipped up another box of chocolate pudding in a seperate bowl using only 1 cup of milk and folded it into the pudding mixture.   I think next time, I will add the caramel and toffee bits as another reviewer suggested.  But I think 2 boxes of pudding with extra milk definitely improves it.  Thanks for sharing your great recipe!

I have made this so many times and it continues to be my most requested item. You can play with the ingredients a little - add drizzled caramel in between layers, add chopped toffee bits or mini chocolate morsels - whatever you have on hand. Delicious!

We just made this dessert for a Christmas dinner, and no one could get enough!
a few minor revisions: we used real whipping cream like many others suggested as well as toffee pieces on top of both pudding mixture layers, and we also added a small layer of raspberries...
we can't wait to make this again soon! thanks for the recipe!

We just had our x-mas party with a bunch of friends of ours and it was a big hit!!! I even heard someone say that it was like eating a piece of heaven. I did change it up a little. I did follow some of the suggestion here. Thanks for a great recipe will do this one again.

Awesome bowl of delicousness!!  I forgot to buy a chocolate bar...or I ate it on the way home!  Instead of chocolate shavings, I used those heath bar chips that I always have on hand! ;)  Other than that...made it just like the recipe...LOVED it!  So did my kids, of course, and my dinner guests!

I had some left over home made chocolate cake and I took it to work today and it was a huge hit. I followed as per recipe, no modifications necessary. I just crumbled a pack of oreo cookies on top with 3 cherries. I'm all about pesentation.  Everybody says it was wonderful. I don't know who said this was sweet but 17 people can't be wrong. I will defintely make this again in the very near future because I still have some more chocolate cake in the fridge. I think will make a one for my sister. 
THIS WAS MAGNIFICENT ! Need I saw more.

This recipe is great!! I made this recipe for my coworkers and I had no complaints about the sweetness. There is no need to make your own whipped topping--the ready made brand is just fine.  I made the recipe as written with just a few tweaks.  Instead of a whole can of condensed milk I added about 2/3.  Also, I added mini chocolate chips after the first layer of whipped topping and heath bar bits on the top layer.  Other than that I followed the written recipe and it was perfect!

Wonderful! I made it for a family dinner and there were no leftovers! I used 1 large hersey's symphony bar (chopped) instead of the plain chocolate, and added on top of each pudding layer.

I used 1/2C of coffee instead of water in the pudding, and whipped 1/2 pint of cream to mix into the pudding mixture.  Used a chunk brownie mix, and this turned out decadent!  It had about 10 hours in the fridge before serving, but it was better the following day.  I suggest making it a day ahead.  Also, it was very sweet, I couldn't imagine making the whole thing with cool whip.  Next time I make this I'll mix in real whipped cream with cool whip for the white layer to take the sugary edge off.  Great recipe, it's a keeper with those modifications.

This was fantastic and yet so simple to make.  The only thing I changed was I made my own brownies instead of a mix.  This was gobbled up fast!

I decided to make this for a work potluck. My husband (who is the choc. lover of us) made me promise to bring some home. Well I had to fight just to get a bowl saved for him. IT was wonderful and so easy to make. Thank you for a great trifle recipe.

I made this for a dinner party i had... a friend with generally good manners literally licked the plate!  although a little too sweet for me, at the next party I went too, someone asked me if I had brought "that dessert".  Pretty easy to make.  I used the godiva chunky brownie mix.

Oh- SO GOOD! I brought it to a group dinner and everyone was fighting over it. I have been asked to bring it to the next dinner already! It would have been perfect exactly according to the recipe, but I added just a few things for my own personal taste. I used brownies with chocolate chips in them, I crumbled the brownie rather than cut into squares, on top of the layer of brownies I drizzled a little caramel sauce, then on the top of the last layer of whipped cream I added crumbled Heath bar pieces. YUM!

Very, very good.  I took the suggestions of other reviewers and made real pudding instead of instant and also made real whipped cream.  I also made 2 batches of turtle brownies.  This turned out great! Everyone loved it.

This dessert is AWESOME.  I made it for a family party.  I don't cook much but found it on this site.  It is so easy and so delicious.  Everyone loved it and was going back for 2nd's (including me!).  It was kind of like French Silk Pie with brownies.  I used mini chocolate chips on top instead of shavings.  It was easier and looked as nice.  Highly recommended!!

I was a little disappointed in this recipe.  I even used real whipped cream and it still wasn't that great.  I am not a big fan of jello pudding so that may be the problem.  The jello just made it taste fakey, if that makes any sense.

This was WAY too sweet for us, but I think it could be excellent with a few changes.  Next time I'll try either using fresh whipped cream instead of the whipped topping, or use regular milk in the pudding mix instead of condensed milk (skip the water).  It needs something to cut the sugar!  My husband loved it, though!

This only gets five stars with my adjustments.  I made the chocolate stuff exactly the way the recipe said with cool whip, instant pudding and condensed milk and thats exactly how it tasted, very artificial.  So I threw it in the garbage.  Then I made my own home made chocolate pudding from scratch [canadian living recipe very easy] and covered the brownies with that and then real whip cream.  I also used scor bits and it was excellent.  I did not mix any of the whip cream in the pudding.  I tried it with a small amount and the pudding was better all by itself with cream on top.  This in not low calorie for sure but good.

Everyone loved this. I left out the sweetened condensed milk COMPLETELY...that would be too sweet. So, I just made the pudding as directed on the box (w/ 2 cups milk) and then mixed in the Cool Whip as directed. I actually ended up not having enough Cool Whip to do 2 layers of the plain Cool Whip - so you may need more. Oh, and I used Ghirardelli brownie mix; make sure you make chewy brownies, the cakey kinds would be too crumby and fall apart.

I made this recipe for a family get together and even those who generally don't eat dessert gobbled this up. I made just a few changes, 1st I used fat free Eagle brand milk and since I hate cool whip I subbed real whipping cream. I didn't add any sugar to the cream when I beat it and I am so glad that I didn't because it would have been tooo sweet! It was the perfect balance. I also drizzled Hershey's syrup over the brownie layers which I undercooked by just a few minutes. They were gooey and delicious. My DH has added this to his list of favorite recipes.

What a wonderful and easy dessert recipe! I made it for a family gathering and it was a show stopper. I have made this twice, the first time I made it as described except that I added some vanilla extract to the coolwhip to make it taste a little more homemade. The second time I made it using bannana pudding mix. Yummy!

This was a hit.  I took others advice and used heavy cream that I whipped to mix in with the pudding.  I also added a couple of "rows" of strawberries which was great.  I couldn't find toffee chips, so I ground up Skor bars and that worked great, Oreo cookies gound up would be good too.  I did layer carmel over the brownies, but not before they baked, I'll try that next time.  I used a chunk brownie mix and forgot to put the first layer of actual cool whip so it didn't look as nice as it could, but this isn't really meant to look pretty as the main feature is it tastes AWESOME!  Took to a church function and everybody was asking for the recipe. I made the night before and it sat in the fridge for almost 20 hours and was great.  Need a heavy spool to serve it with.  It's not pretty but the taste is killer!

okay, this recipe took some work to get it the way i wanted but in the end it was well worth it. I am always reluctant to made trifles as i don't like cool whip or instant pudding. After reading many reviews from people who had used real whipped cream instead of cool whip i decided to try it and also used cooked pudding. The whipping cream does not need sugar added as the sweet milk and pudding is plenty sweet.I made caramel sauce to pour over the brownies as suggested by others. I'm sure the real cream and pudding will separate before too long but no worries as this trifle is so good i'm sure it won't last long!

Oh my gosh, this is heavy, but SOOO good!  I used homemade brownies (Best Brownies on allrecipes.com...my all-time favorite recipe!)  I agree with the reviewer who stated to put something chunky into the brownies (I used cooking reeces pb cups...chocolate chunks would work well too).  I also used light everything (milk and cool whip), but like others have suggested, I made my own whipped cream using whipping cream for the middle layer. This is good!! Hubby and I both really enjoyed it!

this was so easy, my husband and little boys made this for me.  next time I will just make the pudding straight and fold in the cool whip because I think the sweetened condensed milk was way too sweet, probably would be great with just half a can of sweetened condensed milk.  overall a very yummy recipe.  we added some crushed oreos inbetween the pudding layer and the cool whip layer, extra yum

I made this for a memorial wake for a friend of mine and the it was the first thing gone off the dessert table! I used regular Cool Whip to mix with the chocolate pudding and milk, and I used Cool Whip Lite for the layers between. I also used a dark chocolate brownie mix from Duncan Hines. I think those two changes made it a touch less sweet but it was still plenty sweet enough! Sprinkled semi-sweet mini chocolate chips on top and it was beautiful and delicious! Definitely going into my regular dessert for company rotation!

I made this chocolate trifle for a party last weekend.  Everybody loved it!  I made the brownies from the scratch.  I also follow some people advice to only use 1/3 cup of sweet condensed milk instead of the whole can.  I also made my own whip cream because the prepared one in the store is too sweet.  The bottom line is everybody love it!  It's chocolate but yet it's not too sweet.  I believe if you follow the original recipe, it might have been way too sweet for me.

FABULOUS! I borrowed a few other ideas. I made my own whipped cream to add to the chocolate pudding mixture. I used 1/2 pint of heavy whipping cream and put it in my mixer on high until I thought the consistency was sufficient. I also used the french vanilla whipped topping for the middle and top of the trifle. I made this for Easter and everybody RAVED about it!

I followed others and used whip cream.  I also add a layer of fresh raspberries after the cream layer and also on top around the edge on the last cream layer.  In addition, I add coffee liquer on each brownie piece ~2cups for one trifle bowl...do I need to say more?

I first made this delicious dessert last spring for my daughter, her prom date and several other couples going to prom (we hosted a progressive dinner and I made desserts).  It was such a big hit.  It looked fantastic in the trifle bowl and tasted out of this world!  I have made it a couple times since then for get togethers and receive so many compliments on it.  I do use the brownie mix with chocolate chunks!  For special occasions this is definitely a great treat!!!

This is truly death by chocolate. Everyone loved this when I made it for a family gathering. I drizzled caramel topping lightly over each layer of the brownie's before finishing the layers. Then on top, I sliced strawberries and placed them on top with the chocolate shavings, and then drizzled a little more caramel for the finishing touches.  I also used the brownies with the walnuts in them.

Amazing Recipe!! The one thing that I add, because of the peanut butter lovers in my house, is alternating layers between brownies and crushed Reese's Peanut Butter cups.

This is hands down the Best Chocolate Trifle.  We added Butterfinger candy bar pieces on the top for a nice finished look.  We made it in individual dessert dishes, looked beautiful and tasted fantastic! Thanks for the great and versatile recipe.

I gave this recipe 2 stars mostly because it is so quick and easy to make.  But it is incredibly thick and heavy.  Also, I like a more traditional trifle that has a spongier cake that can absorb the flavors.

This was an excellent recipe!  I too whipped 1/2 pint of whipping cream with 3 Tblsp of sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla.  I then added this to the sweetened condensed/pudding mixture.  I also spooned caramel sauce over the brownies, added chocolate chunks and heath bar.  This was rich but delicious!  Thanks for sharing.

I love this trifle cuz it's CHOCOLATE!!!! When I made it, I used chocolate candy pieces suchs as m&m's, snicker bites, kit kats, oreos, hershey's milk chocolate bars. I layered it first the cake, candy, mousse and whipped cream and continued to layered it til I reached to the top. The toplayer was chocolate mousse and all the extra candies and oreos.  It was the best I had ever made.

I made this for a bachelorette party and everyone loved it. The next day the groom, best man, and minister split the leftovers. I added 2 Tb. instant coffee granules to the brownie batter, which gave the dessert a deeper flavor to compliment the sweetness. On top I shaved milk & dark chocolate for an eye-pleasing presentation.

Excellent dessert recipe; it's so easy & delicious!  I've made it for 3 functions so far & every single time I'm asked for the recipe & everyone raves about it!  I've made it with both regular milk & with the sweetened condensed milk & also with bought Cool Whip & homemade cool whip; the substitutions made no difference, they still came out great!  My only tip is to have some extra Cool Whip on hand; because the mouth of my bowl is much wider than the base, I find out that I use a bit more.  Great Recipe!!!

I used Ghiradelli Brownie mix.  After breaking up the pieces I poured some caramel topping over them.  I used a 5 oz package of cooked pudding for the pudding layer.  To give it a deeper chocolate flavor, I added a tablespoon of chocolate powder to it and after I took it off the heat I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1 and 1/2 tablespoons of butter.  I cut the pudding with home make whipped cream and also used home made whipped cream for the "white" layer instead of using cool whip.  I used a vegetable peeler to shave a chocolate bar on the topmost layer for garnish.  These alterations to the pudding layer are a must to give the pudding a richer more developed flavor.

WARNING:  You have to use an actual trifle bowl.  Do not make the mistake I made and use a large salad bowl that looks like a trifle bowl but holds much more volume.  I had to double the recipe to try to reach the top of the bowl and the kitchen now looks like a cyclone hit it.

I don't know how this dessert is going to be received so I will update this review tomorrow morning.  Fingers crossed.

UPDATE:  This will satisfy the undeveloped palates of children and adore-anything-chocolate lovers.  It is NOT amazing by any means.  It tastes like pudding with brownies and whipped cream.  If you are aiming to impress more erudite palates, look elsewhere.

This is really good for what it is, but make sure you read the changes people suggested because that'll reduce the fake-ness (i.e. use real whipping cream in place of some of the cool whip). I made this for my chocoholic dad for father's day. My dad absolutely loved the mousse part and it was easy to do--great results for not a lot of work.

This was awesome!  Very sweet but that's what dessert is all about.  I loved the chewy brownies.  I added skor bits on top and carmel syrup to the layers.  Everyone loved it!  Wonderful!

I made this last night for a scrapbooking party, and by the time I left, it was the ONLY dessert completely gone. Everyone just raved over it! The only thing I changed was that I mixed up a pint of whipping cream, added 1 tsp vanilla, and 1/3 cup sugar and used that in place of all the Cool Whip. I think it might have been too sweet with Cool Whip. It was a BIG hit, so I will definitely be making it again! Next time I'm going to add some chopped pecans for crunch.

This dessert is sooooo good and definately deserving of all the high reviews.  I actually used mint chocolate pudding (it was what I had) but will try with half chocolate/ half cheesecake next time....you really can't go wrong with this; however, I did have to make a few changes.  First I folded whipping cream into the pudding instead of whipped topping.  Then, for the whipped topping I folded in 8 ounces softened cream cheese, about 6 ounces powdered sugar and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice (mixed together)into the topping before spreading.  I did this because I wanted to avoid a strong cool whip taste (a common complaint of other reviews).  The finished product was fantastic!  Just make sure you serve this to a large group because it's very tempting to eat it all yourself.

Good with toffee bits sprinkled over the creamy layers. You can also sprinkle the brownie with a bit of kahlua.

This was amazing! I made it with whipping cream instead of cool whip and I used homemade brownies. I also topped it with raspberries. It was almost too pretty to eat! Lots of compliments. SO GOOD!

This was fabulous! Extremely rich - Definitely add some fruit (yummy strawberries!) and I followed suggestions on here and used real whipping cream. Great for potlucks!

This was gone in minutes!  And I was asked to make it again twice w/in 2 weeks.  I also like to make it w/ variations of candy bars & fruit like strawberries or bananas.

This is an excellent recipe. I followed the recipe exactly except for two things. I added extra layers of cheesecake pudding which was mixed with a little cool whip. I also sprinkled Heath Toffee Bits on top of cheesecake pudding layer and on top of finished product. This is even better the next day.

When I first came across this recipe, it really didnt sound like anything to special to me...but my boyfriend really wanted me to make it so I gave in.. and boy was i wrong.. this dessert was AWESOME! 

I porued half a bottle of caramel over the first brownie layer and topped the whole thing off with some crushed heath bar and it was perfect! Also, it tastes MUCH better the next day (the brownies soften up) so if you are making it for a special occasion I reccomend that you do it a day ahead of time...Im sure I will be making this one again!

Very good!  I used a half pint of whipping cream, whipped, instead of cool whip in the pudding layer.  I do recommend letting it chill for 8 hours like the recipe states.  I tried some after only a couple hours and it was much better the longer it chilled.  Also, I found that grating the chocolate bar on top was kind of a hassle, so next time I will probably just use mini chocolate chips or sprinkles or something.

Oh my goodness.  This was awesome.  I made this for a birthday party at work....It was gone in a matter of minutes.  I made a few changes based on previous comments.  I replaced the water with Kahlua and replaced the sweeten condensed milk with regular milk.  I'm a big fan of homemade whipped cream, so I used that also.

Great idea.  Thank you!!!!

Way way way too ridiculously rich and sweet for most of mine and my families tastes.  The real sweet tooth of the family enjoyed it though.  After reading over the other reviews I decided to use heavy whipping cream instead of cool whip and still found it too sweet for my taste.  As stated by another reviewer, it's nothing special and does just taste like a bunch of pre-packaged ingredients.  Will definitely not be making it again.

--Edit: Wow sort of surprising but I have changed my mind about this desert after letting it sit in the fridge for almost 2 days.  The flavors seem to have mellowed some and now blend together much better and I do actually enjoy it.  Still will not go into my regular rotation but it was an enjoyable desert after allowing it to sit for quite a while.

Fantastic!!!  I added Baileys to the whipcream/pudding mix and cut the brownies into squares.  You HAVE to refrigerate it for a very long time--it was ok the first night, but delicious the next day.  Heaven.

It was really good I made it for a party and the next day 4 people called to ask for the recipe. I used brownie bites rather that make my own brownines. I refrigerated it for only 2 hours and it tasted great. But next time I think I will use real whipping cream  for the layering part, I am not a big fan of whipped topping.

This was good but I could only eat a little bit, it was very sweet/rich...and I'm a chocoholic!!  I would use a simple brownie with it (not one that has anything added to it, will just make it too sweet if you do).  The presentation was very nice.

So easy, quick and delicious!!! I ran out of time around the holidays and made up a recipe of this sinfully rich dessert to take to a party. As a result of my procrastination, I modified it a little - I used whipped cream in place of the frozen whipped topping (I didn't have time to wait for it to defrost - something to keep in mind for next time). Since I didn't have time to bake brownies, I cut up one and a half bags of store bought "two bite brownies". I also added some skor baking bits between the whipped cream and brownie layers, and on top. I did replace the sweetened condensed milk with whole and skim milk after reading some of the suggestions on this site. It was still so good!! I got many compliments on this recipe.

Fabulous recipe.  I got many compliments. I changed it slightly.  I used Lite Coolwhip and sugarfree pudding instead.  I also added sliced bananas to the side of the bowl in the coolwhip layers.  I will save this recipe.  Thanks

I made this dessert as the finishing touch of our nontraditional Christmas dinner. It was a little too sweet for our taste. Even my three daughters thought is was pretty rich and they are little chocoholics. I think that this is a great base recipe and will add layers of fresh strawberries, raspberries, or blackberries (or maybe all three!) to try to balance the overwhelming richness of this dessert the next time I make it. Thank you for the great recipe!!!!

It would have been way too sweet for us if I had followed the recipe, so I followed the review advice, thank you everyone. In the pudding mix I replaced the cool-whip with whipped heavy cream unsweetened (since the sweetened condensed milk is sweet enough) and added a tablespoon of instant coffee to the water. Taste it, if you need more sugar add. I also used whipped heavy cream slightly sweetened with powdered sugar for the whipped cream layers and added a sprinkle of crushed Heath/Scor bar on top. Letting it set up makes it better. You can play with this one!

This recipe is awesome. I have had it with both cake and brownies. If you love chocolate this is the one for you. This is both easy to prepare and impressive looking. I like using 2-3 broken-up toffee bars instead of the plain chocolate. But I don't think you can go wrong with this recipe. It's a no-brainer

This was fantastic!  It always gets rave reviews at my husband's work.  I make it the night before so that it can set up overnight.  I like to use a Hershey's Symphony bar, chopped up, for the candy.  Beware..this is a very rich dessert.  Keep the serving sizes small!

Yep, I took this to a church function and had many requests for the recipe. I do not know how it tasted because it was gone before I had a chance to try it!  I followed the recipe but used toffee chocolates pieces instead of a chocolate bar.  Makes a pretty presentation in a trifle dish.  Definitely a keeper.

This was great! My husband said it was the best dessert I have ever made. I also made it for a Bunco party and there was none left. I did add Heath Bar crumbles on top of the pudding layers and then on top of the entire trifle. It is a sin!!!

Really tasty and easy to make.  It looks impressive.  After reading the reviews, I did add 4 ounces of cream cheese to the pudding mixture to cut the sweetness.  Next time I'll add the entire block (8 oz.) b/c the condensed milk makes this an incredibly sweet dessert.

Good for chocolate lovers.  I used Girahdeli brownie mix which I think put it over the top. I also made my own whipped cream.  I probably would not make it again.

I made this for Christmas exactly as recipe states. My teenage boy cousins called this the dessert from heaven and my husband told me that I can make this anytime. Definately a keeper! I made this again but used fresh whipped cream. I didn't think it was possible to make this dessert any better, but OMG! It made the filling taste like a french silk, and it was divine!

I've been using this site for a while, but this is my first review.  I made this for Christmas, and I must say to call it a hit is an understatement.  I didn't change a thing about the recipe, and I did find it VERY sweet, but it was great for the chocoholic in me!  I also noticed that after sitting in the fridge for another day or two, the sweet factor kinda wore off.  Two words..simply delicious!

Fantastic, I used 6 heath bars and crushed them, put about three in the middle over the whipped topping and then the other 3 over the top. Everyone loved this! brought to a family reunion and should have tripled it! It was gone in 5 minutes!

hit with my guests, definitely a keeper. I used the suggestion of using whipping cream instead of the 8oz cool whip. Much better with the heavy whipping cream! I also would suggestions using a 9x9 pan or larger as I used a 8x8 pan and ran out of brownies. Very rich.

Excellent recipie, I gave it 4 stars because I changed it around a bit.  I added carmel to the brownies before they went in the oven.  To keep it from being too sweet, I only used  half of the sweetened condenced milk and used skim milk for the rest. For the same reason I did not use the cool whip for the pudding. I whipped 1/2 pint of heavy wipping cream to make my own cream and added that to the pudding.  I also added heath bar topping to each pudding layer.  This recipie was great this way.  Next time it I will double the pudding, it definitly could have used more of it.

I hate to be the party pooper, but I wasnt thrilled. It was good but VERY sweet and I used a boxed brownie which didnt  absorb the pudding and cream and get all mucky like a traditional trifle would. It might be better with chocolate cake substituted for the brownie. Otherwise, it was just a brownie with pudding and cream on your plate.

Lovely presentation, definitely got the OOHS and AAHS people raved about but for me, it was WAY too sweet...next time I will make a homemade chocolate mousse for the layers and definitely heed the other reviewers and add something for texture..I opted for the crushed health bars and topped with chopped hazelnuts..that was yummy!!!  Just overall too sweet.

This was good but VERY rich!  Even the hard core chocolate lovers in my family thought it was too rich.  I drizzled carmel over the brownies before baking.  I wish I wouldn't have.  The carmalized topping made the brownies too hard.  It definately pays to let it sit for 8 hours; which I didn't since I ran out of time.

The first time I made this was for a Labor Day BBQ and it was delicious.  I did use vanilla pudding instead of chocolate and added fresh strawberries to the layers.  Today I'm making it for a book group and adding fresh rasberries instead.  I also discovered this recipe gets a lot better with age.  Thanks Wayne for a wonderful dessert.

I made this dessert for a house Christmas get-together and it was a huge hit.  Everyone absolutley loved.  I shaved just the chocolate part (not the green part)of Andes candies mints over the top of the whole thing and it worked out great. It added a little mint flavor that kept everyone guessing.  I will make again and again!

I made this for a family Christmas Eve gathering and everyone just loved it!  As my 5-year-old son said, it's yummerific.  I sprinkled 2 crused Skor bars overtop of each whipped cream layer.  I will make this again and again.

I just made this for a birthday party at work and it was fabulous!! Everyone raved about it. I used dark chocolate brownies which cut down on the sweetness a bit. Also, I got almost twice the amount of servings out of it - it was so sweet that people didn't take as much. Definitely a winner!!

Very rich but very good!!! I used my own brownie recipe and used only half of the condensed milk called for replacing it with evaporated milk. I also used whipping cream to control the amount of sweetness in it. Overall a very indulging dessert!

One word - Yummylicious!!! I brought this to a BBQ served in a gigantic brandy glass (I sometimes use it for floating candles or flowers) and the reviews were nothing but positive. Brownies, pudding, candy - how can you go wrong?? Only thing different I did - used only half the condensed milk as the pudding and brownie mixes are sweet enough. Also cut down on whipped topping coz the hubby does not like it too much. I topped it with Terry's Chocolate Orange which I grated/chopped. Did I say yummylicious??!!?? 5 star for taste.. 4 star for ease as you do need to take time to put this altogether. Thanks!

OMG!  This was just the best.  I did take the advise of other reviews and used Turtle Brownie Mix, real whipping cream instead of Cool Whip and added chopped pecans and carmel sauce - to make a Turtle Trifle.  It filled up my whole trifle bowl and everybody enjoyed!  No leftovers!

Very scrumptious. I used a Turtle brownie mix and put some broken up caramel cruch bar ontop, and it turned out great.

I made this in fifty minutes (including brownie cooke time) for a cookout that evening. Everyone loved it!!! I had virtually no leftovers. Very rich, but so very much worth it. I forgot to buy a candy bar to add to the top, so I just sprinkled some chocolate chips on top. That looked great!

I made this for my daughter's bridal shower. Very rich but everyone loved it. I did use the crushed Heath bar on the top at my daughter's request.

AWESOME! I usually prepare a fancy complicated dessert but had to try this. Rave reviews all around!!!! Made the brownies early in the day, assembled trifle at night and served next night. Even better the following day! No separation as others reported, maybe they used regular pudding or wrong milk. I blended milk,water and milk with hand held mixer.I probably used less in each coolwhip layer and added smashed Heath bar crumbs atop pudding layer. DO NOT LOSE THIS ONE!!!

I am generally a huge chocolate fan, but this recipe was almost too chocolaty for me.  If I ever make it again, I might try adding a layer of homemade raspberry sauce to cut the sweetness a little.  Or maybe add a butterscotch or caramel layer for a change of pace.  It does look beautiful, however.

This is soooo fantastic.  Took it to the NASCAR kickoff race today and there wasn't a bite left!  I added a layer of toffee bits to the middle and it was a nice touch.  I made it the night before and took it the next day.  It let the ingredients mesh together well.  I had 3 people ask me for the recipe in the first 15 minutes!  This one is a keeper!!!!

Thanks for this recipe. I made a few modifications because I do not like the taste of Coolwhip and evaporated milk would have been too sweet. Instead I whipped up a 473 mL carton of whipping cream and added 3 Tbsp sugar and a generous amount of vanilla. I folded in about 2 cups of this with the pudding and omitted the evaporated milk. I also included a cherry pie filling layer in between the pudding  layer and whipped cream layer. This came out delicious and was devoured by my family.

Pretty boring as is. Not worth the calories. Needs help. Chocolate chips, chocolate or caramel syrup, liquor,  fruit filling, something.   Pretty presentation, though.  Gave 3 stars for average.

Great recipe!! Made it for a special service and they were scraping the bowl. My changes are as follows;

1) chunky brownie mix (made according to box)
2) made whipped cream (1c whipping cream and 3tbsp sugar) whipped until stiff peaks formed. 
3) mixed chocolate pudding, water and condensed milk then added the whipped cream. 
4. made another batch of whipped cream (2cup sugar, 6tbsp sugar and vanilla)

Cut brownie into 1 inch squares placed layer of brownie, drizzled caramel topped with shaved milk and dark chocolate then the layer of choco pudding and lastly vanilla whipped cream and then repeat. Topped with drizzled caramel and shaved chocolate.

This was an awesome recipe. This is very rich so don't be surprised. Still, this was a HUGE hit.  Hint: An easy way to grate the chocolate is by using a vegetable peeler. Great recipe @Wayne !!!!!!!!!!!!

I followed the recipe exactly. It was wayyyy to sweet. It's a great simple dessert to make for last minute parties. Next time I will add toffee bits and I will use heavy whipping cream instead of cool whip layer to minimize the sweetness. The pudding/cool whip/condensed milk/water layer was pretty good and came out a bit mousse like! I let that portion cool for a bit before layering.

I loved this- used the suggestion of making real whipped cream to add to the pudding mixture and vanilla cool whip. Everyone loved this. I also used milk instead of water and increased it to 3/4 cup. Next time I will actually probably use a little more milk. The pudding started to thicken a little too quickly as I layered it, but I did extra layers. Will definitely make this again.

Made it with real whip instead, and added white chocolate chips and fresh strawberries to the top. If you don't have a trifle bowl, like me, try using wide mouth mason jars instead for personal-sized portions!

OMG BEST DESSERT EVER! Made this for my school and family on Thanksgiving. People went insane over it! This is a HUGE hit with kids, I should know. The layers do get a little tedious though if you're making many individuals. Its so worth it! Be sure not to use a spongy or cake-like brownie mix. Fudgy is the best effect. Also, if you dont like going skimpy on the layers, make sure to get extra of everything. I had to start putting REALLY thin layers towards the end due to running out of ingrediants. But overall, AMAZING :D

I showed this recipe to my friend who is a pastry chef, and she suggested one little simple change that will put it over the top. Instead of using 1/2 cup of water, she suggested using cold coffee. She said it will bring out the chocolate flavor and add richness. Next time I make this I am going to try that. Even as the recipe is written, it is 5 star delicious!

This was so easy and so delicious. My 9 year old was making a family dinner and we picked this recipe for her dessert. She followed the instructions to a "t" with little help from me and it was a huge hit! We'll be making this again for sure!

This is a lovely desert and so easy to make!  I will make this again with one change.  I will use a dark chocolate mouse in lieu of the pudding and condensed milk.

Easy to make, attractive and tasty.  I used leftover chocolate cake rather than making brownies, which made it even easier. Thank you for the recipe.

The pudding mix is so runny I don't dare pour it on the brownies for fear they'll turn soggy and mushy! It's also a very pale brown, not at all like chocolate pudding.

I made this Trifle as one of two desserts for Easter dinner. I thought I made too much but it was all gone in a flash. Everyone remarked how good it was and swore there was chocolate mousse in it. For me, the best part was that I could make it the day before the dinner. I did add crushed Heath Bars to each layer to add some crunch.

This sounded so good, but I don't do sugar. After reading some reviews, I figured I could leave out the condensed milk, and use Pillsbury Sugar Free Brownie Mix, Jell-O Sugar Free Chocolate Pudding Mix, Smuckers S.F. Caramel Topping, pecans, and real whipping cream, all of which I had on hand. I brought it to a church lunch today where there were about 8 desserts and a sugar-free cake. My sugar free chocolate turtle trifle was completely gone before 95% of the other desserts were touched. I know most of those people didn't need sugar free, but ate it anyway. The pastor had two helpings. If I'd have known, I would have warned him about the side effects of Splenda. Bet he had quite a lot of intestinal discomfort this afternoon and evening. I'll make it regular and sugar free for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Yum.

This was very good for a sweet tooth. It could get a little too sweet if eaten in big portions ( at least for me), but preparing these in little glass cups and having them was yummy. :) This is a keeper.

So good!   I followed other reviewers suggestions about using heavy cream in place of cool whip for the pudding mixtures.   I made a box cake mix, instead of brownies.   While the cake was still hot, I poked holes in the cake and poured a cup of coffee over it.   I added about a teaspoon of vanilla to the cool whip before using it.   There was nothing left of this dessert!

I added Oreos instead of the chocolate candy bar.  And adding the sweetened condensed milk made things almost unbearably sweet.  I added a little to the whipped topping but that made it sort of like marshmallow topping.

I used my GF's brownie recipe which makes the brownie turn out very fudgey, and might I say perfect for this recipe.  So, so good!  I found myself eating the rest of this at 3 in the morning straight from the trifle dish!  Thanks!

Made this for a birthday party and went home with an empty trifle bowl! I made the following changes: used a 6.4 oz (whatever the large size instant pudding mis is) box of instant pudding per the instructions on the box since I read the reviews that it was too sweet with the condensed milk and water; added strawberries which helped cut the sweetness.  I couldn't find vanilla cool whip as suggested in reviews but regualr cool whip was just fine.  I also made three layers and added a heath bar to the first two layers.  Next time I will leave out the heath and add bananas instead.

This was an awesome dessert. I fixed it for the family on Valentines Night and everyone loved it. It only refrigerated 4 hours but tasted fine....of course, much better the second day.
If you have a small family like us (4 people), then this is way too much dessert -- however, we have been snacking on it for three days now and it tastes better than ever.  Or you could cut the recipe in half

After reading all the reviews, i definitely did NOT add the sweet condensed milk, and it tasted fine -- very sweet and delicious.

I am sure I will make it again.

Very good.  Took this to a Super Bowl party and got rave reviews.    Only thing I changed was to add toffee bits and carmel sauce to the layers.  I don't have a trifle bowl so I used a medium sized glass mixing bowl and had plenty with this recipe as is.   Very tasty.

In my opinion, way too much chocolate. Kind of disappointing, and don't get me wrong, I LOVE chocolate! But this was too much. And the brownies didn't mix in well enough. Will not make again.

Very easy to put together.  Instead of using the condensed milk, I made the pudding according to package directions to try & cut the sweetness.  I also added a layer of smashed up Heath Bars.

This is my first time making a trifle. I needed a desert for a Christmas dinner function I was attending and a work colleague suggested a trifle.
I got this recipe online and made it. 
I reduced the sweetened condensed milk to only 2 tablespoons (because all the ingredients were already sweet).
I also added some blackberries and a few blueberries on top.
The trifle was a big hit at the dinner.  Everyone loved it.
My son suggested that I make this my signature desert, since I didn't have one.  
I think I will.
Thanks "allrecipes.com", for saving my day.

This was a great recipe!  It was a little too sweet because I made the pudding with sweetened condensed milk instead of cool whip.  Next time I will make the pudding with 1 1/2 cups of whole milk.   I also added chocolate chip cookies and colored the Cool Whip red and green for Christmas.  I also put Christmas sprinkles on top.  This recipe was great for Gluten Free people.  I used GF brownie and cookie mix.

I made this recipe recently for a Christmas party and, like many of the reviews, it was a huge success and very simple to make. The dinner table was very quiet as everyone was busy eating the dessert. :) I would definitely recommend making 1-2 days before.

A couple of changes I made that really seemed to make a difference included: added a couple of tablespoons of kahlua to the brownies. I used a double chocolate chunk brownie mix and added it to the very bottom layer. For the layer following the chocolate pudding/mousse layer, I used a large box of oreo cookies which I crushed (by putting them in a large ziploc bag and then pounded with a hammer--great stress reliever!). I also added a layer of strawberries to cut the sweetness, which everyone LOVED, especially since the trifle itself is very very sweet and rich. The strawberries, as well as decorative cupcake picks (with reindeer, stars, birds, etc) were used to top the trifle and to add a Christmasy touch. 

Very fun to make. I was very pleased.

I followed the adjustments as per Roxanne323 with the heavy cream whipped with sugar till thick and creamy. It was great except I didnt think it needed the caramel at all. It was already sweet enough and definately better made the day before!

This just had no wow factor.  It was OK but I wouldn't go to the bother of making it again.  I made all the components from scratch as our grandson has nut allergies and I hoped this would hit our daughter's chocolate tooth but it wasn't chocolatey enough and not worth all the calories.  It did look pretty.

Too sweet!!!  I followed the suggestion regarding the heavy cream, but just wasn't that impressed.  I think it might be better if you just add regular pudding without mixing it with heavy cream.

My mother-in-law makes this and it is the best.  This is the exact recipe except she uses heath bar on top.  Personally I think the shaved chocolate bar would be better since I don't really like heath but either way would be good.

This was really delicious and incredibly rich!  The sweetened condensed milk adds a nice flavor to the pudding mixture.  I used crushed Butterfinger candy bars between the two sets of layers and also as a garnish on top, and it was a huge hit.

Excellent recipe.  I used chocolate cake instead of brownies and wasn't as rich.  I also alternated strawberries and rasberries on top for garnish. (around rim of dish)  Looked amazing and fruit balances out sugar.  I also sprinkled crushed Heath bar on top.

Easy, delicious and attractive dessert....made better with a few changes! First, i prefer to use 2 boxes of the double chocolate ghirardelli brownies (yummy). It is easier to combine pudding and water first before adding condensed milk. Use heavy whipping cream rather then cool whip

Yum, yum, yum. I followed the review below regarding the heavy cream and vanilla whipped cream. It was delicious! Just remember to mix the condensed milk wiht the jello and water. The instruction didn't seem clear to me. The BEST after about 8 hours in the fridge!

To. Die. For.  Easiest thing in the world.  You can either bake the brownies yourself, or buy a few packages of the Two Bite brownies to throw it together quickly.  Either way it's awesome. I have yet to find someone that doesn't like it.

Can't go wrong with this. You can make it less unhealthy (but not healthier, lol) by using fat free whipped cream and pudding mix.  I prefer using real whipped cream (pint of heavy whipping cream + sugar + beat in chilled bowl with beater until forms peaks.  I don't think it'll take a full pint - I start with a cup of liquid.

Followed recipe as stated.  Decadent without being too rich.  I usually use chocolate pudding without anything mixed in, so this was different for my family and they really liked it.  :)

Try using Brooke's Best Bombshell Brownies from this site. These are out of the world good. For chocolate shavings on top. I put a Hershey's chocolate cand bar in the freezer and then use my cheese grater. Works great. If you want curls - use the cheese grater when the candy bar is at room temp.

I saw this recipe and got so excited... I love sweets! However, when I made this for a family BBQ, it was even too sweet for my sugar-loving family. Maybe it would have been better if I had added something else to balance out the sweetness... like strawberries. A little of this goes a long way!

I have made this several times, is always a success. Many requests to make it again. Would recommend using a Skor candy bar, and add it to the middle layer as well as the top for garnish.

This was very good. I served it to company and it was well received. I made the recipe exactly as the recipe stated. Next time I will try some of the other suggestions, but don't hesitate to make as stated!

my mom and aunts have been making this dessert for years. A couple great variations to this is to use chocolate cake instead of brownie mix and also to mix through the chocolate pudding, chopped up Heath bar. That adds an amazing crunch. Amazing old tradition in my family

VERY easy to make and should be made the day before so it's ideal for parties (that way you won't be stressing last minute). Pretty tasty and it was a big hit with my guests. I've already made it twice!

I changed the recipe up a little bit, and my layers were as follows.  Brownies, homemade chocolate mousse, crunched up kit kat bars, cool whip.  Another layer of the same, and then topped it with raspberries and chocolate shavings.  It was definitely a hit.  I was afraid that it was going to be too rich and too sweet, and while it was a heavenly dessert, it wasn't too rich.  Everyone LOVED it, and told me not to make it again, but only because it was so loaded with calories!  Turned out really good, was def a hit :)  Try it!!!

I'm so surprised at the number of people just catching on to the "trifle thing". I've done these for years, because they are sooo versitile. You can use up stale cake, cake or pies that flop, left over fruits, any pudding or jello. Nuts ,candy,liquores. Endless as your imagination!!  Always a hit with any age group.

Excellent recipe!  This always gets devoured at parties.  My only hint is to always use Betty Crocker brownies and make them extra thick (I use two boxes and serve the leftovers separately)...out of all the ones I make, these brownies are an overwhelming favorite.  I use chocolate chips on top to save time.  The mousse is to die for and I've made it separately with red raspberries and whipped topping for a parfait like dessert too!  Thanks for posting this delicious dessert!

Awesome!  This went so fast at my pampered chef party this weekend.  Everyone raved!  There were several kids too who just loved this :)   I did follow a few tips from previous reviews (although I am sure the original would have been fine too).  I don't love cool whip, but I do agree that it holds up better in this type of recipe.  I used 8oz heavy cream whipped and folded that into the chocolate mixture.  I used a tsp of vanilla in the cool whip layers (my store didnt have the french vanilla) and I thought that was a major improvement to the overall flavor.  I used store brand chunk brownie mix and cut them into very small pieces, then layered with caramel sauce, then chopped heath bar, then the chocolate, then the coolwhip and repeat.  I topped with additional chopped heath bar.   It looked beautiful and tasted great. I will definitely make this again and again :)

Super Yummy.... I took the advice from another comment to make it all with REAL whipping Cream and Cooked Pudding.  I also used Triple Chocolate Brownie mix that I purchased from Costco (Super delicious). For those of you that can't ignore that Chocolate craving ... This recipe is PERFECT.

Great and super easy. The only change I made was to add Heath bits to every layer and top. It's really rich. I may try this again using sugar free pudding, low fat condensed milk and lite cool whip to make it a little less sinful to eat!

Very appetizing presentation! Simple to put together. The pudding with the sweetened condensed milk is genius (I've already thought of half a dozen other ways to use that component elsewhere)! Don't let my three-star rating fool you, our family ate the whole thing in one sitting! My hubs and I just felt like it really needed something to really connect all the different layers. This is super-rich already, so maybe this would put it over the top, but next time we make this (and we will!), we're going to try drizzling Hershey's syrup over the brownie layer before adding the mouse layer. Ya, I know, more chocolate, but the layers just didn't meld together the way we thought they would. We're hoping the syrup will act as a cohesive element between the layers. Then again, maybe we're overthinking. Anyway, this was worth making, especially if you REALLY like chocolate, and REALLY like rich desserts.

I made this for my fiance and he LOVED it. It was absolutely amazing. He's been requesting it constantly since the first time I made it. I changed a few things (as per other people's suggestions) and used heavy cream to fold into the pudding rather than coolwhip. I also added heath toffee bits and layered in the following way: brownie, caramel sauce, heath bits, pudding mix, coolwhip, browni, caramel sauce, pudding mix, cool whip--then topped with crumbled brownie and toffee bits. it was AMAZING. tastes better the next day! This is best if prepared a day ahead and allowed ample time to chill

I followed this recipe with the addition of caramel on top of the cake layers and then a final drizzel on the top with the chocolate curls.  My husband took it to work for a co-worker's birthday almost a year ago and they are still talking about it!

I love this dessert! I have made it a few times, each using a different combination of ingredients. The latest was cheesecake pudding, cherry pie filling, and angel food cake with the cool whip and condensed milk from the original recipe. It was a huge hit. When making the original recipe, I added some crushed up heath bar in between the layers. It gave it a nice crunch. Thanks for a wonderful recipe. I will continue to make with different combinations of pudding and cake.

I followed the suggestion to use cool whip with the pudding mix, water (actually, I used brewed coffee instead of water), and condensed milk, and whipped cream instead of cool whip as a layer in the trifle. Yum! It's really fun to make, too.

I have made this probably 10 times now for Christmas and Thanksgiving family dinners.  I always get rave reviews, requests for the recipe, and an empty dish when I make this.  You can put almost anything on top to dress it up: brownie crumbs, chocolate-covered strawberries, crunched up butterfingers...whatever you have on hand.

This is a KEEPER!  So delicious and rich.  I can't eat a lot of this at one time which makes it all the better.  I completely flubbed this recipe and it still turned out incredible.  Instead of mixing the pudding, water, and sweetened milk together...I made the pudding per the package directions.  Since there was no turning back I mixed in the sweetened milk and whipped topping to my already prepared pudding.  It turned out fabulous.  What a delicious and delectable treat - thank you for this recipe!

Extremely easy to make, good for a kids birthday party, or a make ahead dessert-however i did not think it was anything very special, and it was a little to sweet.

made this on the fly for my daughters varsity soccer potluck.  All the girls raved.  Very easy.  I used store bought brownies to save time.  Also added caramel and heath bar bits as another reviewer suggested.

Oh SO rich, I've also made this adding NOT ONLY the brownies, but broken up soft chocolate chip cookies TOO...mmm. My mom and I wondered if, instead of chocolate, the new Jello brand pumpkin spice pudding would make a good fall dessert such as this, maybe with Nilla wafers or graham crackers instead of brownies??? :)

AMAZING! I was very impressed with this recipe and will be making it many, many more times. I made it exactly as directed and still wouldn't change anything, although next time I may add some strawberries for fun.

BEST ever.  Normally I have NO luck with stuff like this - it turned out perfectly.  I am definately an amateur cook - so if I could do this - anyone can.  We had a small dinner party and they LOVED it, raved about it and asked for the recipe.  This NEVER happens to me, I was delighted AND it's super easy too.  Totally awesome.  Thanks for this amazing recipe.  My hubby is still bragging about it.  One last thing - it looked soooo amazing in my bowl I bought just for this dessert.  Totally worth it.  Thank-you, thank-you.

This was very good!  I have a family of three so I made two smaller dishes - one is frozen.  I did not use a 3.9 pudding mix, instead I went for the larger size of 5 oz. just to give it more chocolate flavoring.  The brownies I baked and then sent directly into the fridge and they were nice and cakey for us!  I will definately be making this again!

At every family dinner get together I challenge myself by including something new. It's a kind of an addictive adrenaline rush for me. Not always such a wise idea but so far I haven't had any grand flops. I splurged, treating myself to a long wanted trifle bowl, to best present this dessert's layers. I did follow directions as written, only subbing real whipped cream. As the bowl was tall I was able to add 1 more layer, sprinkling a scant teaspoon of Skor toffee bits on each. It was fun decorating the top with shaved   chocolate, coloured sugar, a pinch of toffee bits and thin strips of candied orange peel.   http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Sugary-Orange-Peel/Detail.aspxAt  This trifle caused quite a stir as we took first bites. I was treated to "awesome, OMG too good, fabulous". Everyone loved it and they all left with a copy of the recipe. I couldn't have asked for better results.

I made this for a family gathering and had NO leftovers.  I've made it 2x now once with cool whip and once with homemade whip cream. Homemade was way too rich and sweet and for me to say that is really something.  I think I'll try the vanilla cool whip but so far the cool whip was the best

This was very good, but I think I took away from the overall flavor by trying to go light.  I used fat free sweetened condensed milk and lite Cool Whip.  It was still good, but not as good as I wanted it to be.  Next time I'm going to skip the "light" and add a little peanut butter to the SCM before I add it to the pudding mix.

I have made this several times.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time.  Everyone loved it.  The second time I heated half of a jar of raspberry jam on the stove with a couple of tablespoons of water to thin it out.  Once the raspberry sauce was through I poured it over the baked brownies.  I followed the rest of the recipe the same except instead of using a candy bar I saved chocolate on top of the trifle.  It turned out great and once again everyone loved it.

This recipe is to die for. I made it exactly as stated in the recipe. The second time I made it, I added nuts and summer berries. The third time, I added caramel sundae topping and toffee bits. Each time was splendid and each time the dessert was gobbled up in a flash!!

Made half the recipe by using an 8*8 brownie mix and making the pudding according to the box. It filled 6 individual trifle dishes. Topped each dish with a cherry... a great presentation for Daddy's birthday.

Made this for Father's Day and it was a big hit with a huge WOW factor! The pudding mixed with the sweetened condensed milk tastes like a yummy mouse! Next time, I am going to throw some heath bar, other candy bar, or chocolate chips into the brownie mix before they cook for some added texture. I highly recommend refrigerating overnight before eating. Oh, this keeps well in the fridge for nearly a week if you don't eat it all the first try :)

Wow!  I followed Roxanne's advice and used toffee chips and made my own whipped cream and then used french vanilla cool whip.  It was amazing... I took it to work and it disappeared.

Absolutely delicious!  I've made this several times and every time got rave reviews.  I didn't use the entire can of sweetened condensed milk the second time, as the first time I think it was a tad on the sweet side.  Both kids and adults have loved this when I've brought it places.  Super easy and looks & tastes great!

It was so good I didn't have a chance to taste it. Served for Mothers's Day. In- laws & his side of family definitely impressed. I read reviews and added Heath toffee bars. (Had a problem crushing them up. Broke apart w/ hammer by placing candies in several plastic baggies.)

This is a wonderful recipe. I made a few modifications. Instead of cool whip added to the pudding, I used one pint of heavy whipping cream and mixed until I had a nice, thick consistency. Since it wasn't quite chocolatey enough for me after adding the whipping cream, I added 3 tablespoons of dark (unsweetened) cocoa.

Delicious!  I used 1/2 pint whipping cream with 3 Tbls sugar to fold into pudding mix as others suggested.  I also used 1/2 regular brownies and 1/2 blonde brownies and layer of caramel sauce over the brownies.  The rest of the recipe as stated and everyone loved it.

Very good but too rich for me.  I would like this better with chocolate pudding as-is, without the condensed milk.  Beautiful presentation and very easy.

This was my first trifle.  It was very good.  I used one bowl chocolate cake III from this site and I used real whipping cream and mousse (1st time too).  I shredded dark chocolate on the layers and top.  This was very easy and very good.

This was DELICIOUS, I only gave it a four because I made some adjustments, I used french vanilla whipcream and chocolate whip cream to do layers with including the chocolate pudding.  I added fresh cut strawberries which I thought gave it some texture, definitely is important to let sit so the ingredients can marry, so delicious I will make this again!!!

Gorgeous and incredibly easy.  Tasted like heaven.  I did add a layer of caramel sauce and it was superb.  Might try drizzling the brownie layer nextime with some liquer to soften it a bit more.

This recipe is a good basic recipe and you can adjust it to your preference. I made chocolate pudding as the recipe called for on the box except I used half of the milk and half of half and half cream. Condensed milk was too sweet when I made it the last time. I then added a layer of thawed raspberries and everyone cleaned their plates!! Thanks for sharing the recipe. Its really easy to make.

This was incredibly easy to prepare, and the outcome was beautiful and delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, and did not add any special twists this time, but next time I might consider spicing it up a bit with chocolate chips or something of that sort.  Great recipe - super easy - will use this one again!

I love this recipe. This is my go to receipe for a last minute pot luck at work. The only thing I do different is substituate the brownies for canned cherry pie filling. Just me, but I think the brownies make it a little too heavy. Other than that, dont mess with perfection.

Absolutely FANTASTIC. Made my own whipped cream and topped each whipped cream layer with heath bar chunks--I loved the extra crunch. Made again and topped the brownie layer with half a jar of caramel sauce BEFORE baking, per another user's review. I think next time I would add the caramel sauce AFTER baking, but other than that it was absolutely delicious--mom and fiance are still begging for another one!

Thank You!  My mom has been making this for years.  I like to have an actual recipe to keep in my book so I was very excited when I saw this.  My mom does not mix the whipped topping and pudding but it really makes a difference.

I made this back to back for a couple of different parties.  First time, I followed previous suggestion and used chunky brownies, toffee chips, caramel, french vanilla coolwhip and whipping cream...it was awesome!!  Second time, I used regular cool whip since I couldn't find the vanilla.  Also, didn't let it setup as long.  I noticed the difference - wasn't as good.  But I got lots of requests for the recipe both times.  I'll definitely make it again

I made this for one of my desserts for x-mas. Out standing! Everyone that ate it loved it. I used "Cool Whip" because I like it. And instead of the water I made chocolate milk with half and half. I wanted it to be kid friendly. The adults loved it just as much as the kids. Great recipe.

This was pretty good.  I doubled the recipe, used real whipped cream for the white whipped cream layer (Dream whip to mix in with the chocolate) and omitted one can of condensed milk.  I also added a layer of cherries jubilee between the brownie and chocolate layer.  It definitely makes way more than 12 servings though - a single recipe is probably enough for 16 people.

This is seriously one of the best recipes at Allrecipes!  People fawn over this stuff:  You will absolutely not go wrong with this dish.  It's gorgeous on the table and in your belly.

My only suggestion is to skip the cool whip and go with real hand-whipped cream, for the pudding layer and the whip cream layer.  But that's just me, I'm not a cool whip fan.  Drizzling caramel sauce over the brownie layer and on the top makes it yummier and prettier.

Thanks for this recipe, it's honestly my favorite!

It was easy and turned out beautifully, I used the heavy whipping cream with a little sugar to mix with the pudding and I used fudge pudding and french vanilla cool whip like some of the reviews suggested. I will be making this again for sure

Great for a company party, and sure to be liked by most.  My only complaint is that it was really dense, but not in a way that made it desirable.  I mean that it was sort of syrupy, the chocolate pudding to be more specific.  I will definitely be making homemade pudding next time, or lightening it up with homemade whipped cream, which I also recommend for this recipe.  Overall, I think most people will enjoy this, just not really my thing!

Per other reviewers, I omitted the sweetened condensed milk and used regular milk in it's place. I added 2 teaspoons instant coffee granules to the chocolate pudding. Also divided mixture into thirds for pretty layers. To the top layer of cool whip, I added 1/2 cup toffee bits, chocolate sprinkles, and red and green colored sugar for a festive look for a recent girl's night out. It was a hit, and the kids got to eat the leftovers...will keep for a special dessert. Thanks for the post!

This trifle is fabulous. However,I did change it alittle. Instead of coolwhip, I used 1 pint of whipping cream and 3T sugar in the condensed milk/water/pudding mix mixture. I also added health bar toffe bits and caramel sauce on top of the brownie lawyer. This is one dessert that never had leftovers.

This was so good and so easy to make!  I needed more cool whip for the layers, though.  I used almost 2x what the recipe called for.  I let it set for about 6 hours before it was served and it was delicious.  I will definitely make this again!

Yesterday, I auditioned this recipe for my family to see if it was worthy to share at an upcoming church pot-luck.  It was a huge hit with my husband and kids!  I made one minor adjustment out of necessity.  I only had one 8oz container of cool whip, so I whipped some heavy cream with sugar, strawberry extract, and a few drops of red food coloring.  This was used in place of the white cool whip layer (the cool whip I had was folded it into the pudding mixture per recipe instructions).  It not only looked beautiful, but it tasted amazing!  I can't wait to make this again.  Great recipe!

One or two bites is all you really need! If you're looking for a chocolate overload/diabetic coma- this is it. I didn't use a trifle bowl, instead I used 10 wine glasses. The majority of people who tried it were blown away by how rich it was and agreed that next time we only need a shot glass. I used whipping cream in the pudding/custard instead of whipped topping. I think next time I will not use the condensed milk as it made the pudding very, very thick! Trifles are usually very light and fluffy, this was not. I was a little impatient and I tried some the night before... it was gross! I let it sit overnight (w/ my fingers crossed!) & the next day the flavours were well blended. It was delicious! I wouldn't really call this a trifle, due to the fact that the only 2 things in common are the layering & a need for refrigeration. This is more like a chocolate mousse cake, but yummy regardless. I'll make this again for a Girl's night where tons of chocolate is appreciated, but other than that it's not something I'd make very often. I prefer fresh tasting trifles!

Thanks for the great recipe!  I made this and brought it to work for a co-workers b-day.  She loved it.  I used the Betty Crocker box fudge brownies, and I followed the recipe to a T!  I will try to make my own whipped cream next time, but I like how super easy it was.

I made this recipe for a church gathering.  It was very easy to make.  The taste was delicious.  Also, I made it prior to going to sleep the night before and ate it for lunch the next day.  I was afraid that the brownies would be soggy, but it was amazing.  I think making it before I went to sleep saved a lot of stress the next day.

Easy to make, beautiful, and very yummy.  Took it to a work function and it was gobbled up.  Even people that usually avoid desserts had some (and sent me e-mails about it).  Thank you!

After reading the rave reviews of this recipe I couldn't help but try it out at my sister-in-law's bridal shower. It was a total hit, even with the guests who didn't typically like chocolate. I personally found it to be a bit too sweet for my liking but everyone else loved it! Next time I might try it with a cake mix as another reviewer suggested.

Delicious!  I made the original recipe as posted, everyone loved it!  I made the same recipe but layered cherry pie filling and used cheesecake pudding in place of vanilla, I also added chopped walnuts to the layers, it turned out like a black forest trifle.  Love it!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This is the ultimate indulgence!!!!   It is a huge hit and is the most often requested dessert in my family.  It is very rich though and a small portion is very filling.  I would give it more 'stars' if I could!

This recipe was very good, and my daughter loved it, but it was far too rich for me and my boyfriend.  But that is just personal taste, the recipe itself is great.  Perfect recipe for an eye pleasing, impressive dessert and so easy!

This recipe got rave reviews at a potluck. I used a low-fat brownie mix, fat-free Sweetened Condensed milk and  Cool Whip Lite and it still tasted great!  Used another reviewers suggestion and topped w/ mini chocolate chips.  I didn't own a Trifle dish but found one at Walmart for $6.97.

I made a similar recipe from Kraft for my boss's birthday and it was a huge hit! Instead of candy it had fresh raspberries and it substituted vanilla flavored whipped topping.

Husband, who is one big giant sweet tooth, said this is the best dessert I have ever made and quite possibly the best he has ever tasted! I modified it according to other reviews. Added the Heath Bar Toffee bits and folded the pudding mixture in with the heavy whipping cream (that I had whipped in my kitchenaid mixer until stiff.) WOW was this good.

This was yummy!  I didn't have condensed milk so I used fat free half and half for the pudding.  I layered this in individual glasses for my guests.  There were rave reviews... and no left-overs.

Try this recipe with peanut butter cups or heath bar to change it up a little.  I also used a chocolate chip brownie mix as well as a regular brownie mix to change it up a little.

I've made this several times and it is absolutely delicious! Friends raved and gobbled it up! My husband requested it for his bday. The only change I made was putting Heath toffee chips on the top instead of the choc candy bar. Yes it is sweet, but what do you expect from a chocolate dessert?!

this chocolate trifle was reallly good and i made some adjustments as well. i used dark chocolate pudding and dark chocolate shavings on top. i also baked the brownies 1 or 2 days before, because they always taste better a few days old! i used regular cool whip and i feel like whipping heavy cream might taste better, but if you refrigerate it overnight will it get "watered down"? oh, the last change i made was sprinkle oreo crumbs on top of the brownies before adding on the cool whip. YUMMMMMY :)

Wow! That is all my family and friends had to say. I have never made one of these dishes and for Father's Day I wanted something fun and new. I followed the recipe mostly. I did change up the pudding mix and instead of using cool whip, I used 8oz of heavy whip cream (like other's suggested). I also was trying to find the french vanilla cool whip instead of just plain old coll whip, but the store I went to was out. I compromised and used the plain old cool whip but I added in about 4Tablespoons of French Vanilla Instant Pudding Mix. Strange I know, but it worked. :) I also drizzled caramel over the brownies, before putting the pudding layer on. And the shaves off the candy bar...small ingredient, but REALLY put the finishing touch on it. :) Thanks to everyone's suggestions, we LOVED it and I am sure I will make it again. Thanks!

Probably a 4 1/2!  I take off 1/2 as it is VERY rich.  You can't eat a lot of it.  Next time will definitely 1/2 the sw. con. milk as otheres suggested.  Used the lg pudding boxes, used whip cream in w/ the pudding and doubled the amount of Cool Whip layer.  Doubled the recipe, which filled my largest glass bowl, and medium glass bowl (probably not necessary to do for a BBQ/potluck--but maybe for a large church one)  Still have the full medium bowl left!

The mousse substance was more like flubber vs a smooth mouse (still yummy though!).  I will have to try some alterations to see if I can get it smoother.

I have made this dessert countless times! It is an extremely easy dessert. I've shared this at potlucks, birthdays, family dinners, etc. Everyone loves it and can not seem to get enough! I like to use the Ghiradhelli Brownie Mix with this...it makes it EXTRA yummy! I've made this recipe exactly as it says and I think it's perfect!

I was really looking forward to eating this after reading all the reviews and drooling over the picture.  I was unimpressed.  It had way too much cool whip.  Would have been better if the chocolate pudding was made regularly insetad of with the cool whip and stuff.  I ended up throwing most of this out, which says a lot since I'm a pregnant chocoholic!

I would give this 10 stars if possible, it is that good.  I made a change to the recipe that I think was crucial to it's success.  I whipped heavy whipping cream and only sweetened it very slightly, instead of using Cool Whip.  I think this helped the dessert not to be sickly sweet.  I also used chopped Heath Toffee bits on top for extra crunch.

I've made this several times, and there are never leftovers--everyone asks for the recipe.  I did make few alterations suggested by previous reviews.  I used french vanilla cool whip instead, only 1/2 can of condensed sweetened milk and whipped 1/2 pint of whipping cream with ~3 tbls. of sugar and added to pudding mixture.  I've also used crushed malted balls between layers and used as a garnish on top.  Great dessert!!!

I made this and it was wonderful. It was exactly what we were looking for to end our BBQ. It was a bit sweet so I think I will try the whipping cream idea instead of cool whip.

I made this for my sister in law's birthday dinner.  Instead of using a big serving bowl, I made individual trifles in stemmed wine glasses.  I remember that I added an extra layer... maybe of a candybar or something.  They were a huge hit and made a creative alternative to birthday cake!

Yum! This trifle turned out delicious and beautiful! I followed the suggestion of others and used 1/2 pint of whipping cream mixed with 3 Tbsp of sugar instead of the 8 oz cool whip. The chocolate mixture was thick and wonderful! I also used a peanut butter cup brownie mix and everyone kept asking what tasted so good in the brownies. I garnished with mini chocolate chips and Oreo crumbs I had left over from another dessert I was making.

I followed this recipe exactly, except I buy an extra 12oz cool whip because I like more for the topping.  I like to change it up a bit and add carmel or fudge sauce on top of the browines and sprinkle toffee chips...YUM

I thought this was just pretty good but everyone else seemed to love it.  To me, it tasted like a brownie with whipped cream on top.  (Note:  I had a cold when I made this so my taste may have been a bit off!)  I put Heath bar bits on top of the brownie layer and I liked the crunch and extra flavor that it added.  I also put a few strawberries on top and more health bar bits.  I will probably make this again just because it is something different and has a very nice presentation.

I made this as one of the desserts for Easter this year and it was the first one they dug into and the first one to be finished off.  Everyone raved about it!  Its very simple and I will be making this again.  I had to borrow my mother-in-law's trifle dish but I'll be buying my own soon so I can make this all the time.  THANK YOU!

words cannot describe this dessert.  i was shocked how absolutely perfect it was.  i'm not a fan of whipped topping, so i replaced the chocolate/whipped topping layer with a counterfeit chocolate mousse (pint heavy whipping cream, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 box instant chocolate pudding) and used vanilla whipped topping for the whipped topping layer instead of plain.  i added a layer of caramel sauce between the brownie and mousse, but i'm not sure that added to it.  this dessert is easy, delicious, and so worth the time.

Two words...OUTSTADING, OUTSTANDING!  However, we make fresh whipped cream, and more than what the recipe calls for.

Made this for my birthday party and holy cow! I couldn't believe all of the rave reviews it got. I actually served it with the brownies still a little warm and a bit gooey (that's how we like them) and crumbled some additional brownie bits on top (didn't have any chocolate shavings). People absolutely loved it!

Elegant-delicious-quick-easy.  Absolutely wonderful recipe.  I was looking for something using brownies, but something a bit different.  This was perfect.  I did make my own homemade brownies instead of the boxed (which would have been just as good).  The pudding mix I used was a small box of sugar free chocolate fudge (maybe it cut down on the overall sweetness because I didn't find this overly sweet as some reviews suggested).  I was really surprised how the pudding mixture turned out with texture and taste.  This is great for the chocolate-fanatic.    Worked out fantastically.  For sure this will be made again and again for various events and get-togethers.  Although I think the original recipe is great as-is, I may take some of the suggestions on this site and change it up a bit- I especially like the caramel addition idea or cherry for a black forrest dessert.  I did use just a large glass bowl since I didn't have a trifle bowl.  Had a bit left over but not bad.  I think as well as I enjoyed this recipe, I may have to buy a trifle dish to use for future makings of this dessert.  I highly recommend this recipe.

I made this for a family gathering yesterday and it was a hit. My husband says this is now his all time favorite dessert. I have been famous for my great cheesecakes, but my family is telling me that this is now my signature dessert. Theonly changes I made to this recipe were ready-made brownies from the supermarket, crushed heath bars on top of the brownie layer and mini chocolate chips sprinkled on top. This is an easy recipie with a great presentation. This dish will make you look like a gourmet chef.

This is a beautiful dessert.  Followed others' suggestions and used a half pint of whipped cream in place of Cool Whip in the pudding layer.  Topped it with halved strawberries for Valentines Day (looked like red hearts and gave GREAT flavor)  The toffee chips sprinkled over the brownie layer stayed crunchy overnight under the chocolate mousse later.  The chocolate mousse is SO thick!  Fabulous! The first dessert killed at our huge potluck. *** one addition - I used cheap brownie mix and put lots of chocolate chips in it.   This added another texture of chocolate - VERY important to yumminess.  Baked chocolate chips are SO much better than sprinkling uncooked ones.  Drizzled Dulce de Leche over the diced brownie layers - Absolutely awesome.  And Noone thought it was too sweet.  (also used two boxes of brownies - could have used a little more chocolate mousse - may double that next time)

This was an awesome dessert! I made it in an 8x8 pan the first time, but had leftover pudding stuff and brownies. I made it a second time for a birthday "cake," but I made it in a 9x13 pan and all of the ingredients fit perfectly! Both times I only made three layers instad of six.

This was delicious, and I will definitely make it again, but with a few changes.  There was not enough pudding to cover the brownies, so I will use two packages next time.  I also added some fresh sliced strawberries to the cool whip.  Definitely a keeper!

This was awesome!  I did use whipping cream instead of whipped cream in the pudding.  And I used vanilla wipped cream in for the whipped cream layer.  I also let it refrigerate for 12 hours.  I cannot say enough about these!  SOOO GOOD!

This is a frequently requested recipe among my friends.  Instead of boxed brownies, I use my favorite brownie recipes from this site "dump bars". YUM!

I made this for Christmas lunch dessert. It was waaaaay too rich. I don't know who can eat more than 2 brownies in a sitting let alone pile it with the cream and sauces! Just felt ill. I don't think I'll be making it again...

I've been making my own version of this recipe for years and thought I would give this one a try given it's high rating. My family thought this was much to sweet with the condensed milk added.  I make it with fresh whipped cream, cooked chocolate pudding and Skor Candy bars.  If I'm serving adults, I soak a bit of coffee liquor over the cake and for children I use chocolate syrup. At my family's request, I will stick to my stick to my original recipe.

I have made this recipe twice, first I followed the recipe to the t, it was great but very, very sweet. The 2nd time I made some adjustments, used whipped cream w/ 3 Tb sugar in the condesnsed milk and puding mix; also used some of the whipped cream and mixed with the cool whip to reduce the sweetness and added a layer of crumbled heath bar on top of cool whip layers. It was fantastic!!! Definately a keeper...

I made this for Christmas using some of the suggestions made - added caramel sauce, used whipping cream in the pudding mixture, and used French Vanilla cool whip vs. regular.  Also added the Heath bar chips.  YUM!!!!

This is definitely for those with a sweet tooth!  I did make my own whipped cream as I have never seen frozen whipped topping in South Africa.  I made my own brownies as well using the "Chewiest Brownies" from this site and it was good.  I added strawberries.  I think next time I would double the strawberries and add another whipped cream layer to dry and balance the sweetness from the brownies and the chocolate pudding layer. Very good though.

This is superb! One of my coworkers named this "Heaven In A Dixie", as people ran out of plates and were eating it out of paper cups :-) I only made two changes... #1, I make two batches of boxed brownies in 8x8 pans- this gives me thicker. chewier brownie chunks. I also trim off a very thin layer of the brownie edges to makes sure each brownie chunk is soft, not at all crispy... #2, I have made this recipe both using cool whip as instructed, or by making my own homemade whipped cream instead. It's suprisingly easy after you've done it a couple times, and it tones down the sweetness a tiny bit (which seems to be more universally appealing among the crowds I've served it to). I always get requests for the recipe, and I happily pass it along! Thank you so much for sharing! This has become my widely requested pot luck staple!!!

To die for!  I whipped heavy whipping cream to mix with the chocolate pudding and replaced the plain Cool Whip with French Vanilla Cool Whip.  I have to take the recipe with me everywhere I go!  Thanks for sharing!

I had to double the recipe to get to the top of my trifle bowl.  I figured I would have tons of leftovers but people were licking the bowl!  I used fat free cool whip (couldn't find the vanilla this year) and low fat sweetened condensed milk to lessen the sweetness.  I whip up 1/2 pt of heavy whipping cream and add that to the condensed milk/water/pudding mix instead of using cool whip.  I also added skor bar bits and caramel sauce to every layer.  It was a hit!

WOW I made this for a Christmas gathering this weekend. Most of my family ate this dessert before food!!! Everyone raved about this dessert. I made it just like instructions said. I will make a few adjustments next time (ex: caramel, whipping cream  and more brownies) but I will be asked to bring this from now on!!!

This is just insanely good! I made the brownies very soft-set so they were all gooey. After reading other reviews, I used heavy whipping cream in the chocolate mousse and the French vanilla Cool Whip. I could eat this entire trifle in one sitting!!!! Mmm, mmmm good!!

This is a hit every time I make it! It's so easy. Even though it says you should let it chill in the refrigerator for several hours - you don't have to if you're in a pinch. People will still go crazy for it the instant you're finished making it! Great recipe, Wayne!

I needed a dessert in a hurry for a gathering I was having and was able to throw this together in 10 minutes using brownies from the bakery section of the grocery store. Total life saver being pressed for time. I've also done this with my own whipping cream and I think it's well worth the time for the improved taste!

Amazing!  I followed the comments from Roxanne323 dated 6/10/07, and this was a huge hit at a school mixer.  Just remember to remove your cool whip from the freezer and place it in your fridge at least 4 hours before planning to use it.  I forgot and had to wait for it to thaw enough to spread.  As a result the dish was served 4 hours after it was made instead of the 8 hours the recipe called for.  Still tasted great (consider the ingredients!)  Excellent dessert.

This recipe is a definite keeper! My family devoured it at my mom's birthday party, and I got nothing but rave reviews. I did, however, do a few things different. I used a 16oz cool whip in the chocolate filling and a 12oz to make the whipped topping layer. I also added a layer of hot fudge sundae topping with toasted pecans. I drizzled the top with more fudge and pecans for a perfect finish. It's very rich, but well worth the calories. Thanks for this recipe! Oh, I forgot to mention that I also doubled the amount of brownies since I making it for a large group!

I made this trifle using some of the variations recommended in other reviews and literally had coworkers licking the bowl.  Made it 2 weeks ago and had people asking for it again already this weekend.  My changes:

1.  I used fat free sweetened condensed milk.
2.  Light cool whip.
3.  Whipped my own whipping cream to mix with the chocolate pudding.
4.  And used apple sauce in the brownies.

Very good!

This is an absolute standard in our house and my teenage daughter HAS to make it a couple of times a month just for her friends.  Make sure you follow the recipe and don't just automatically make the pudding with milk (been there done that).  We use more coolwhip (my son prefers the vanilla flavor cool whip) as we find the amount suggested doesn't cover enough to make definition between the layers.

I made this dessert for a gathering with my family.  I used vanilla pudding instead of chocolate, because all that chocolate seemed like a little too much.  It was unfortunately a little to sweet for my liking.  I would maybe suggest using cake instead of the brownies next time to cut the sweetness. Overall great recipe and idea.

OUTSTANDING!!! My new favorite trifle, replacing a Death by Chocolate trifle! I used one container Vanilla Cool-Whip and one regular (mostly for the top/white color.) Added choc chips to brownie batter and barely cooked them all the way to keep sinfully moist. Called it "Trailer Trash Trifle" and made it in a 16 cup Pyrex measuring cup/bowl for a Redneck/White Trash costume party we went to - was devoured quickly!

Everyone really liked this, though it is very rich!  I didn't bother cutting the brownies into 1" pieces, just crumbled them all over for the layers.  I let it sit overnight, and it was great.

Believe it or not, I've made this but not tasted it. I dropped it off at my care group after I had signed up to bring the dessert but couldn't make the study. My friend returned the trifle bowl the next day at church. She said it was so good that there were only chocolate streaks left on the bowl. For that...I give it 5 stars.

I had high expectations for this dessert because of all the rave reviews it had received, but found it didn't live up to the hype. I liked it, but found it a bit too dry and too sweet, without enough variety of flavours. All in all, I prefer a traditional English trifle.

Update: I found this is much yummier served warm with ice cream. One minute in the microwave does the trick. That way, it tastes more like a chocolate pudding.

You can never go wrong with this recipe, when I am in a crunch I go to the local farmers market and buy the brownies pre-made. then just put everything together. Its a very easy dessert with very little work.

I used this recipe as a base for a fruit-and-chocolate trifle.  I added a layer of strawberries and raspberries as well as a white chocolate pudding layer.  I took reviewers' advice and used heavy whipping cream instead of cool-whip.  I made "Fabulous Fudge Chocolate Cake" from this site instead of brownies--my friends were impressed and ate the entire thing by the end of the night!

This was good, but a little boring.  It tasted like chocolate whipcream on top of brownies.  I was looking for something a little more sinful!

Oh my gosh.  Soooooo yummy!  I used only half the sweetened condensed milk and made my own whipped cream for the middle and topping.  I sprinkled crushed Heath bars over both of the pudding mixture layers and on top.  Took to a friends house for a bbq and it was a huge hit.

This was good.  To make it even faster i used the two bite brownies that you can by in the groceery store.  It made it good for the kids to get involved as well.  They had fun.

This is wonderful!  I added instant coffee to the pudding mix, and I used extra creamy Cool Whip.  I also didn't fold in as much as the recipe called for.  Next time I'm going to blend in whipped sour cream into the Cool Whip for the non-chocolate layers.  I'm afraid that may be too much, though.  This is really good, but really sweet.

I tasted the pudding while I was making this trifle and thought it might be too sweet, but when it was all put together and refrigerated, it was just right. I used leftover (week-old) brownies and you couldn't tell at all -- there was no leftover trifle!

My mom used to make something she called "Death by Chocolate" and this is the closest to it I could find. I added Heath pieces on top which not only added to the beauty of the dessert, but went really well with the chocolately flavors!

This trifle is heaven.  I made it for work once and people have never forgotten it.  I like to sprinkle mini M&M's on top.  It is truly delicious.

I've made this twice and got rave reviews both times. To make it extra sinful, I doubled the recipe for Deep Dish Brownies on this site (4 eggs and no baking powder) instead of using a box  brownie mix. A decadent treat and pretty, too!

This dessert was wonderful.  I followed the recipe exactly except used fat-free Cool Whip,low-fat sweetened condensed milk and fat-free, sugar-free pudding mix.   Also, I used  1/4 cup canola oil and 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce to make the brownies.  If you didn't know, I guarantee you wouldn't have guessed.  It was absolutely sinful.  The one caveat, however, is make sure you have a nice handful of folks to serve, as it makes A LOT! I made the mistake of making this recipe this evening for our small family of 4 and we will probably be eating off this for the next week! FYI, my husband did say it was a bit too much chocolate for his taste. What does he know, anyway, LOL??

I made a DIET FRIENDLY version of this dish and it was fantastic!  I also made a quick version.  I bought the chocolate muffins that are made by weight watchers instead of making my own brownies.  The fat-free instant pudding and the light cool-whip are just as good as the full-fat versions, so that was a no brainer substitution for me!  The thing I love the most about this recipe is how easy it is to customize!  I did strawberry slices instead of the chocolate shavings and put a layer of the strawberries in the middle too.  Chocolate and strawberries... always a big hit!  I can't wait for more events so I can share this with people!  I also want to try cherries with the chocolate, and maybe sometime switch up the chocolate pudding for another flavor...maybe a key lime pie version!!  FUN!

Let me start by saying that I did not have high hopes for this recipe...my daughter wanted to try it and I'm not a chocolate pudding fan myself, but I agreed to make it. So glad I did! It's a wonderfully delicious and easy dessert. I used a box mix for the brownie and slightly undercooked it so it would be more fudgy..crumbled them up and layered the brownie crumbles, then drizzled caramel sauce over the brownies, then the chocolate layer (made with the pudding mix, water, swt.condensed milk, and whipping cream that was whipped with just a spoonful of powdered sugar), then half of only an 8oz container of Cool Whip, then sliced fresh strawberries, then repeated. Made it the night before and everyone raved! I like that the chocolate layer doesn't taste like pudding...it's more whipped in texture too. We will make this again..soon!!!

This was yummy!  I made it for a work party and it didn't last very long. I used a glass bowl since that is all I had.  I went out and bought a trifle bowl to make this again and again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was sooo good.  I plan on making this dessert any time there is a large group of folks to feed.  I added some vanilla extract to the whipped topping layer so it wouldn't be quite so plain.  Next time I plan on adding in some chunks of toffee.

YUM! It's a winner!!! I'm not a big chocolate fan but this was fantastic. I'd like to try it once using a chocolate cake instead of the brownie for a little "lighter" version.

This recipe was wonderful! So good in fact that it's new name, accoding to friends is, "Yummy Good Stuff". I made it for a get-together last weekend and everyone ate it up in no time. Something fun to try is dipping pretzels into the trifle. It makes it taste like chocolate covered pretzels. Overall, I wouldn't change a thing and would reccomend this to everyone.

INCREDIBLE!! Very rich and yummy!  I made it for a potluck and everyone wanted the recipe!  There was hardly any left to take home to my husband!  It was a big hit and I will be making this again and again!

Made this twice within one week - got rave reviews at both picnics. Used Ghirardelli chocolate brownies (has 3 types of chocolate chunks in them) and sliced strawberries the first time and blueberries the second. Definitely needs some type of fruit - looks so pretty in the trifle. Also took the advice to use heavy whipping cream in the moose instead of cool whip. Excellent!!!

At Christmas I add a layer of canned cherry pie filling mixed with a 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract stirred into the cherries. This is the last layer before the whipped topping.  You can alternate this with the other layers if you have a big enough trifle dish.  If you do it that way you'll need 2 cans of pie filling.  Half of a can just isn't quiet enough to make a layer. I also add a sprinkling of toasted almonds along with the shaved chocolate on top of the whipped topping.  Beautiful and delicious!  Reminiscent of a Black Forrest cake.

I've made this for two parties now, and I have a feeling if I don't for the next, I will have some upset guests.  Everyone loved this trifle!  No one needs to know how easy it was to put together! The only thing I change is that  I double batched the brownies.  My trifle bowl might be a bit larger.  Great recipe!

I've made a trifle recipe similar to this in the past but was intrigued by the sweetened condensed milk.  I only used half the can after reading some of the reviews about it being too sweet and I also replaced the water with strongly brewed coffee (from another reviewer).  It was awesome.  My son refused to lick the spoon because of the coffee but that just means I got to lick it for a change.

Followed as written except cut the cool whip part down to 8 oz.  Lots of oohs and ahhs, very easy.  One recommendation - make sure you stir the cool whip before layering it so it spreads easier.

Very impressive-looking dessert and easy to make.  I served this for the extended family Christmas dinner and got lots of compliments and oohs and ahhs.  A keeper for sure.  I followed the recipe exactly and added some crushed Almond Roca to the top.  No one thought it too sweet.

This is sooooo yummy!!  Instead of the Eagle brand milk & water we just use milk.  Also, try it with a package of crushed Heath bar (find with the chocolate chips)...  This is the easiest dessert!!!  It will definitely cure a sweet craving!!!!

Very Yummy!  I DOUBLED this recipe for a large church get together and it was gone!  I used 1 1/4 cans of sweetened condensed milk so it wouldn't be too sweet, then used regular milk to get it the consistency that I wanted it.  It was delish!

I made this with sugar-free, fat-free pudding and sugar-free, fat-free frozen whipped topping, to cut down on some of the bad stuff.  It lost a little in the way of texture, but was still very good.  I will definitely make this again.

I really wanted to like this one and it looked beautiful, but it's basically just a big mound of whipped topping with some brownies.  Not the most tasty recipe - very pretty though.

This is easy and produces such an impressive looking dessert. My kids have made it for their classmates, and it was gobbled right up.

This dessert is AWESOME!  Based on prior reviews regarding sweetness, the only change I made was adding 8oz of cream cheese to the pudding layer.  This dessert was well received and was gone FAST!  I would make again.

This recipe is one of our favorites. I use fresh whipped cream so it is less sweet and I used homemade brownies.

Excellent recipe, we all loved it!  If you like your brownies real fudgy like we do, make sure to cut them into very small bites because they get pretty firm.  Fantastic....Thanks.

Delicious! My family loved the trifle and it was gone in a flash! I cooked my brownies for the least amount of time so that they were nice and gooey, this probably helped the pudding flavor soak in.I also added chopped milk chocolate Hershey's to the pudding. Yum! I think, as with every trifle, it tastes best after sitting for a day or so. This trifle is very rich, so only the brave hearted sugar addicts should eat it (like me, ha!) Five Star trifle that is a snap to make!

I've made this recipe 3 times now and it is always a huge hit.  If I'm feeling like having something a little less rich, I simply replace the brownie mix with regular chocolate cake mix.  Either way, it always goes very quickly

If you want to be the star of any company or group gathering, make this dessert.  I made this for a church function and got rave reviews. It was interesting how many thought I made an icecream dessert. It had the appearance of creamy soft-serve icecream but tasted like a chocolate dream.  I called this dessert, "Heaven in a bowl".

Just gorgeous looking. I too used fresh whip instead of frozen. What an eye-pleaser! Next time I would underbake the brownies, as especially the brownies at the side of the pan got quite crunchy and I think it'd be just fine to leave them soft or gooey.

I had some of this leftover the day that I went to pick fresh strawberries and instead of putting the strawberries over a yellow cake that I made for my bf, who isn't very into chocolate, we ended up splitting the leftovers with sliced strawberries on top.  I would recommend not sugaring them though, as it would be too sweet and the trifle doesn't need any more moisture.  Would be great with fresh strawberries layered in as well.  Overall, great recipe, don't be afraid to experiment with it- Definitely worth buying a trifle bowl for!

I am the world's biggest chocoholic and sweet freak but this was too rich even for me. I think it would probably be less rich if next time I cut the condensed milk in half.Overall,it was an ok dessert.

This trifle was a huge hit.  I've made it twice so far and both times I came home with an empty bowl.  It is excellent.

Made this with homemade brownies and real whipping cream and it was decadent.  Have used crushed Heath bars and chopped snickers bars, both are excellent.  Beautiful dessert!

Brilliant recipe.. I used fudge brownie mix.. Only problem I had was that I had to defrost the Cool Whip completely to spread well. My guests loved it and my kids finished it!! Easy to do.

What can I say about this recipe other than I made it twice in one week, once was for a dinner party with friends and the next for a work holiday party and both times it went within 1/2 hr.  I put skor bar througout each layer of the trifle!! I also used boxed brownie mix with hershey bar pieces in the mix!!  Fabulous!

OOOOOMMMMMGGGGGG... This was Heavenly! 

The brownies definatly make this 100 times better then the traditional Trifle that most people make w/ cake mix. 

I read the reviews and although this is very rich I must have the biggest sweet tooth ever b/c I didn't think this was too sweet at all. The only things I did differently was to get dark chocolate pudding mix and I made the fudge type brownies according to the brownie directions and I used toffee pieces and carmel sauce to just add that extra "zing" to the dessert. This is a very rich dessert so alittle goes a long way and since your not eating as much it's definatly better to make for a larger gathering! But every single person who tried this for Thanksgiving loved it and told me I must make it again for Christmas. This is definatly a Keeper! THANKS!!!!

I have been using this recipe for many years now. I follow it exactly as written for my guests and then make one using gluten free ingredients for myself;)I have been asked again to make it for Thanksgiving this year. It is by far the most popular dessert at the dinner!

This dessert was great!  I needed to bring a dessert to a company potluck, but had very little time to spare.  This was a big hit and took me about 5-10 minutes of actual prep time.

I guess you have to be a choco-holic to like this one.  My husband and I thought it was too much and too rich.  I'd rather use my trifle bowl for colorful fruit desserts.

It was really easy to make, and great for a last minute desert. However, i found it a bit too sweet, and the pudding layer becomes quite runny.

Easy and fabulous!  I didn't change a thing and the family was literally fighting over it and the dish was empty in no time.  My only complaint is that it didn't layer nicely, the pudding layer seeped through the brownies so it looked messy in the trifle bowl.  No matter, it was great.

This dessert has a NICE presentation when served in a nice glass bowl or trifle dish. After you start scooping it is a huge glob of gooieness though! I used double chocolate brownies and added one layer of strawberries in the middle. Next time I will you use a little less whip cream. So easy to prepare. Thanks for a great recipe.

Perfect.  My family and our guests went nuts over this one.  It looks pretty, too, until you serve it.  Once it's removed from the bowl, it becomes a mixed blob of colors on the plate.  But don't let that stop you from making this.  It tastes SO good.  It's really, really rich -- so if rich chocolaty desserts aren't your thing, stay away from this one -- or serve yourself just a tiny bit.

Put this delicious concoction in your prettiest bowl, and don't forget the chocolate shavings on top.  They'll think you spent hours on this.  Delicious, fool-proof, and heavily requested!  A sure hit!

I made this for a baby shower - it was a hit!!  I've had several people ask for the recipe since then.  Even though I had plenty of food, and everyone said they were stuffed by the time dessert was served, there was barely a brownie left at the end of the shower!

My husband and I consider this to be a fair recipe. It was easy to prepare, but it's not the best we've ever tasted, not the worst either. As far as kid friendly, none of our grandchildren we're here to give their opinion. I would rather prepare something that takes time with a great taste, as to prepare something that's easy and so, so. I doubt if I'll make it again.

Very delicious!  I would recommend doubling the recipe for a large crowd...it goes quick!  I also added chopped walnuts to my brownie mix and topped it off with cherries! Try making it with fat free products...just as good!

This trifle was a big hit!  It was easy to assemble and looked like I really fussed.  I've had several requests for the recipe already.  I am going to make it again for a family gathering this weekend and I'm sure they are going to love it!

EXCELLENT!!!! I made this recipe using my own brownie recipe and sprinkled orange flavoured shaved chocolate over top.  This gave it a nice orange flavouring.  Served it to guests on night and it was so good they took some home.

Made 20 individual trifles using 7-8 oz. plastic serving dishes. Perfect amount. I used freshly whipped cream and gluten free brownies,  since many in the group are GF. Topped with 1/2 a strawberry.  It's more work but  individual servings are often better with a buffet meal.  The trifle stays a trifle instead of a blob on a piece of key lime pie.

So I somehow managed to miss some of the directions going off my memory ended up making the pudding as box directs.  So I did not use sweetened condensed milk.  It was still really good and kept in the fridge better than I expected.  I did throw in some Reeses peanut butter chips for fun.  I think this is a pretty easy and versatile recipe.  Thanks!

We added crème de mint shavings to the top and colored sprinkles for a pop of color. It was an enormous success. I will definitely make it again.

This is an AMAZING dessert. So easy and our friends were so impressed by it!!! 
We needed more brownies though, one box was not enough. 
We used high quality ingredients: godiva pudding mix, godiva chocolate bar, gheridelli brownie mix. 

Highly suggested.

Made this for a holiday gathering using some alterations as suggested by others.  I used basic brownies baked in a 9x13 pan,’cooled and cut into 1 inch squares.  When making the pudding, I used condensed milk and then folded in about 8-10oz of real whipping cream that mixed up without any sugar.  I drizzled a little caramel on top of the brownies when I layered it all together and let it sit overnight, about 16 hours in all.  

My results:
1) the dessert was still a bit sweet in my opinion.  I think the caramel was too much. 
2) the brownies were an unpleasant texture to the mix and were chewy.  My little kids thought it was difficult to eat.

Next time I will omit the caramel but still make the pudding mixture as I had mentioned above.  I think using a pound cake would be better and result in a more even texture in the trifle.   Overall, this is a great recipe that can easily be altered to fit your specific tastes.

I took this to a bereavement dinner today and came back with an empty bowl! I did follow suggestions of others and whipped fresh heavy cream to fold into the chocolate pudding and condensed milk in order to keep that layer from being so overly sweet as others mentioned. I also used chocolate cake instead of brownie mix because that’s what I had in the pantry. I definitely think this version with the condensed milk/pudding mixture is far superior to just a milk/pudding mixture.

Good as is.....but lends itself to individual adjustments! That said, I'm sick of people like Paula complaining all the time about the 'synthetic' taste of instant pudding! The stuff has been around forEVER, some of us never had anything else.... and it's always good!!!  For those of you who don't like it..... then DON'T make recipes that call for it! Same goes for Cool Whip!  don't make the recipe then complain about the taste if you knew what it was before you started!!  Sheesh!

So good!  I followed someone’s suggestions and used whipped cream in the place of cool whip in entire recipe. Also layered on chocolate chips and crushed heath bar and caramel sauce. Poured half a jar of caramel sauce on top of brownie dough in a 8” square pan before baking.  Delicious! Would be good with Oreos too!

Unlike most of the reviews I read, I actually made this as written, so I wanted to leave a review for the other poor souls like me who assumed this was the top recipe and bought the ingredients as listed.

First, I had no complaints about the sweetness, as other commenters did. It served my purposes just fine, although it wasn't life changing or award worthy.

If you are fortunate to read the comments ahead of time, I agree that the pudding could benefit from being made and chilled rather than essentially just used as a flavoring the way it is here. That would make for a richer chocolate flavor which this lacked. Should you have the time, it seems only natural that the other main suggestion about making your own whipped cream would also improve the dish.

Next time!

I made no changes to the recipe. It is superb!!  My family loved it. I cannot wait to takes it to a church dinner. The only thing was, I didn't have time to refrigerate for 6 hours and it still set up beautifully at approx. 6 hours. Even after you cut it, it doesn't turn into a big blobby dessert. It is just beautiful. I feel really happy that I decided to try the recipe.

Made this for church “eating meeting” and it was the hit of the dinner. Everyone wanted the recipe. I did follow a few recommendations from other reviewers. Added some Smuckers salted caramel topping over the brownies and whipped cream with a bit of Splenda and vanilla to fold into the pudding mixture. I chose Heath toffee crunch crumbs for the candy. Not hard to make although there were a few pans and bowls to clean up. I don’t have a trifle bowl and my crystal pedestal dish is not as deep so I didn’t repeat the layers. This one’s a winner!

Wow. This is the trifecta of desserts! Easy to make, beautiful presentation, so delicious! I followed Roxanne323's tips, except I didn't add caramel and used regular low fat Cool Whip instead of French Vanilla.  Scrumptious!

For the most part it tasted very good, though it was extremely sweet. I feel like if you just made the instant pudding as is on the box instructions instead of making it with the sweetened condensed milk, it won’t come out as unbearably sweet. That’s what I’m trying next time.

Great recipe. i made my own whip cream using half and half and read through reviews for changes.  I made ghirardelli brownies and needed to cut them thinner. It was too rich with thick pieces of triple chocolate brownies. Overall, a hit. I'll make again

The pudding in this is so easy to make and while it isn't mousse, it isn't supposed to be!  Easy modifications are endless with this.  I made a Devil's Food chocolate cake in a cookie sheet instead of brownies because I didn't have any brownie mix.  I drizzled chocolate syrup on half the cake to make it gooey yummy, and Bailey's Irish Crème on the other half.  I used the chocolate syrup cake layer first, pudding next and on top of the pudding I added crushed oreo's and sliced strawberry's.  Then the Cool Whip.  Repeated with the Bailey's flavored cake next.  I topped the last Cool Whip with shaved chocolate and some strawberries for decoration.  It took some time, but real easy and YES! A crowd pleaser!

I followed some changes: I used Cool Whip for the chocolate layer, but I used real whipped cream for the white layer.  I also sprinkled the layers with Heath toffee bits and squirted some caramel sauce on the brownie layer.  The moans of pleasure could be heard as the kids and grandkids dug into this.  It's a keeper.
12/24/19: I forgot the chocolate bar and I couldn't find any toffee bits. I instead chopped up some roasted peanuts to top each layer.

i added some cubed pound cake to the brownies and on the top layer whipped up whipping cream just before serving.  I added chopped walnuts to the top and loved the crunch.  Our dinner group liked this at our New Years Eve gathering.  It was nice that it can be made ahead of time.

Yup. Super easy, super delicious! Followed others suggestions and used real whipped cream to fold into the chocolate pudding mixture. Also, I cheated and just bought freshly baked brownies from the grocery store to chop up and use.  Came out just like the pitcure. TONS of compliaments. No leftovers. YUMMY!

Definitely give this a try.  I recommend that you put some chocolate chunks in a layer to add a little crunch to the dessert.  I will definitely make it again.

You could easily name this "Gone in 60 Seconds Dessert" because that's how quickly it goes whenever I make it. The first time I followed the recipe. After that, I read through a lot of the comments for variation suggestions. Caramel and Heath bits were a big hit, but you can get really creative with this depending on your tastes.

Hi! I made this twice. And I loved it. After reading the recipe I knew I would make a couple of changes. I used a brownie recipe that used chocolate chips which made for nice little chunks of chocolate in the trifle. I also made stabilized whipped cream, instead of using store-bought, which makes such a huge difference. AND, I drizzled a little dulce de leche over the brownie layer. The first time I made this I served it after 8 or so hours in the refrigerator. This really is at its best after 24 hours or so. The second time I made it I prepared it on Thursday evening for Saturday afternoon, and it was perfect! The chocolate has a chance to mellow, the flavors have a chance to marry, and the texture is great. Thanks for the recipe, Wayne!

Used the Oreo cool whip for layering and made whipped cream from scratch to fold into the pudding.

Marvelous chocolate creation and delightful presentation in a trifle bowl!  Folks "oohed and ahhed" as it was carried from the fridge to the dining room table!  I read a number of reviews before making this for the first time and followed some of the suggestions.  I made real whipped cream instead of using non-dairy whipped topping.  For the trifle bowl, which is more narrow and taller than large serving bowls, I made 3 levels instead of 2.  I also took the easy way out and used mini chocolate chips on the top--my husband said it needed these for a texture contrast.  Everyone loved it and I will make it again for sure!

I made it by the book, but not after first failing with whipping cream and Bailey's Irish Cream. The pudding and cream were happy together, and they were light and fluffy. But then when I drizzled in about 1/4 cup of Bailey's, the cream just collapsed.  You can't fold a liquid, really.

So I retreated to using Cool Whip and water, just like the recipe called for.  I used Heath Bar for the topping. 

It was OK, but nothing to get excited about. I would maybe double the amount of brownie to make the whole thing more substantial. It just needs more.

I made it as written (didn't have chocolate shavings and I think it would be better without them anyway) and it turned out great. I really think ice cream would go great layered inside so maybe next time I make it, I will add some.  Make sure to give it ample time in the fridge!

I have been making this dessert for quite some time. It is amazing! I always get asked for the recipe. The last time I made it, I made a double batch and made individual trifles for a dinner at our church. People were fighting over them! Very simple, but amazing!!!

Everyone loved this dessert at the Super Bowl party! I did add a little bit of surprise and crunch in the layers. In-between the first pudding and cool whip layers I added dark chocolate chips and crushed up Oreo cookie candy bars. And then uses the same to sprinkle on the top. The extra crunch of chocolate and Oreo flavoring gave this trifle a wonderful kick of crunchy chocolate goodness!! Will plan to make this again and again!

I fantasized about this dessert a week before i bought the stuff to make it. The idea was amazing, but it doesn't taste anything like I thought it would. 

This makes a heaping 8x8 glass dish. Finished, it was about an inch or more over the top of the dish.

It's super dry. and bland. The pudding mix with the sweet milk and cool whip is almost bitter. It's not sweet and tasty at all. I had hoped that once it got good and cold in the fridge, that it would taste better. My husband said he liked it, but the whole container sits in the fridge uneaten. In another day, it will be out in the compost bin.

What a waste of good brownies and a ton of cool whip!

My family LOVED this trifle and couldn't rave enough about it! I changed it up only a bit out of necessity since my trifle bowl was very large and I needed to improvise in order to fill it. I made up the mousse layer as the recipe called for, but also made up a package of chocolate fudge pudding and a package of French vanilla pudding to add layers. I drizzled caramel syrup on top and voila! Dessert heaven!

Mine looks different because I did in in 1 layer in a 13x9 pan with a carrier. I took it to a party. I'm handicap & bowl is to heavy. Used crushed Heath Toffee Bars. Put layer on top of dessert before finishing with extra whip topping, than added another layer crushed candy on top of  topping. Coffee gang loved it.  Gone quickly. Everyone said they could have licked the foam plates. I'll never make pudding again with regular milk! No one believed it was made with pudding.

This was a hit on Thanksgiving as our chocolate dessert. I did substitute the cool whip for whipped cream in the chocolate pudding. I also substituted whipped cream in the cool whip layer but added a teaspoon of vanilla and sifted powder sugar. My choice for the chocolate topping was crushed Heath bars. I used day old brownies drizzled with a little bourbon too!

I loved it!! But I made a few changes. First instead of buying brownie mix from the store  I made home made brownies from scratch. I also bought whipping cream and whipped it when I was making the trifle. With these changes it was fantastic!!
Thanks for the recipe.

This is definitely a crowd favorite! It is both delicious and eye appealing!  I added canned cherries after the brownie layers and continued with the layers as in the recipe. It is great for chocolate lovers and it's not too heavy after a big meal! - I served it after a back yard BBQ and it was a big hit! Your sure to get rave reviews for this recipe!

I love creamy brownie-ish trifles, and this was one of the best. My husband told me in place of a cake for his birthday, he wanted a brownie trifle, so I ran to allrecipes to find one. I'm so delighted to have picked this one. The only change I made was to bake a batch of chocolate chip cookies (I cheated and went with the Nestle premade dough instead of making it from scratch, though my grandmother is probably turning in her grave) along with the brownies, and then split both batches in half, and layered them in the trifle bowl as the recipe called for. It took delicious to a whole new level. :) Highly recommend! I'll be making this again.

This is really good.  I did make it with chocolate cake as some reviewers suggested.  And, after reading labels on non dairy whipped topping I made my own whipped cream with heavy cream sweetened with stevia.  Gotta cut a few calories, right?  I also sprinkled some toasted chopped pecans on top of each layer and grated a little chocolate bar on the very top.  Let's just say I doubt this will last three days.  :-)

I imagine you could make with white cake or coconut flavored cake and coconut pudding with toasted coconut.  Or, maybe lemon flavor with strawberries?  Or, French vanilla with bananas?  I haven't had lunch today.  Can you tell??

Very good-followed reviews and whipped heavy cream with sugar in the stand mixer with whisk attachment for pudding layer instead of cool whip. Used from-scratch fudge brownie recipe (Better Homes & Gardens) instead of box. It was a hit!

I made this for my daughters birthday and it was super sweet, even for me. My daughter told me my sweet tooth must be broken. I think I"m going to try it again and substitute half  of the condensed milk and use heavy whipping cream instead of cool whip

Loved it from the first time and just have to keep making it!  It's always a hit when I bring it to a party, work potluck, summer barbeque, etc., so everyone seems to love it no matter what the occasion is.  Plus, it's easy to change up with a simple substitute to keep things interesting. For example, instead of brownies, we'll substitute moist strawberry cake, and may also swap out the chocolate shaving topping to go along with the cake switchup.  We've also done a version including an even lighter cake option and cocoa powder dusting on top for a tiramisu-like trifle that's super tasty and a healthier alternative.  But the base of the recipe for the non-cake part always stays the same because it's the best of all the recipes we've tried so far and always comes out the perfect texture/consistency and sweetness/richness that compliments whatever kind of cake/brownie goes with it!  I sometimes make just that part of the recipe when I crave chocolate mousse but only have time to whip up something super quick.

Plan ahead for this one! It MUST chill for 8 hours, add time for the brownies to cool before even starting to make this. I only refrigerated it for 4 hours, and when I topped it with whipped cream it just melted. Also, it was a holiday and the fridge was opened and closed so many times it wasn't cold enough in there to keep whipped cream from turning to liquid. This recipe didn't work for me, but  it was operator error. I must say, though, the next day the gooey mess in my trifle dish was delightful!

This was so easy to make and everyone loved it. For Christmas, I used Ghiradelli Peppermint Bark with Dark Chocolate. Everyone said it "tasted just like Christmas!" This is very decadent so a little goes a long way.

This is so rich and delicious! I'm pretty sure every bite you take is over 500 calories. This is one of the most unhealthy deserts I have ever made, but I have never gotten so many compliments before. The only thing I changed was use store bought brownies and I also added caramel and heath bar crumbles.

This is a spectacular dessert. It's easy to make, delicious to eat, and was still good several days later.  This is going to my go-to-dessert.  There are opportunities to add different kinds of chocolate candy bars and flavorings (peppermint maybe?)

Delicious!! Used dark chocolate boxed cake mix cut into cubes.  Used Hershey's chocolate pudding mix for the mousee.  Instead of cool whip for the mousse I used 1 cup of heavy whipping cream whipped as per other reviews (did not add sugar to this).  Sprinkled mini chocolate chips in between layers and on the top!  WOW, s so good!!  The mousse makes this recipe, not overly sweet.

This is the bomb! I used Carmel filled chocolate chips in place of the shredded chocolate topping. I also made Brooke's Best Bombshell Brownies from this website in place of boxed Brownies. This was so rich and delicious. You have got to try this recipe out, you won't be disappointed.

I'm a self admitted chocoholic. This earned 5 stars with some tweaking. I made a double batch of the pudding because I didn't want anything about this to be skimpy and left over chocolate pudding is never a bad thing. When making chocolate pudding from a box I always add 1 Tb baking cocoa, 1tsp pure vanilla extract and use half and half instead of 4% milk. Instead of whipped topping, which I cannot stand, I use beaten heavy cream stabilized with unflavored gelatin and sweetened with powdered sugar. I topped it with chopped Heath bars. This is not too sweet nor too rich, at least not for me.

This dessert  was delicious. I made it twice.  I followed the recipe as written.  The only thing I found is that the brownies were somewhat hard.  Refrigerating the dessert for eight hours really did bring the flavors together nicely and took some of the sweetness out of it.  My family loved it
And I will definitely make it again.

This was ok...it was too sweet for my taste, and I love chocolate and rich desserts, and I also made my own whipped cream. The sweetened condensed milk is just too much. I think I would make it again but leave it out or make homemade pudding, and use homemade whipped cream, but then it would be an entirely different recipe.

Recipe was very easy to make but turned out very sweet.  If I make it again, I would mix one box of chocolate and one box of vanilla instant pudding (following instructions on boxes for making).  I would skip altogether the water, sweetened condensed milk and the 8 oz Cool Whip.  This hopefully cuts down on the sweetness.

Fabulous recipe! Very impressive to take to friends. I made the following changes. 1 cup of heavy cream and 3 tbsp whipped together and added to chocolate pudding mixture instead of cool whip and chopped Reese's peanut butter cups instead of chocolate bars added to each layer. My guests couldn't quit raving about this!!

I'm not a big sweet eater but this was absolutely delicious! So good that I had 2 helpings. A little on the rich side but I will definitely be making it again. Unlike some of the other reviews, I didn't tweak anything. It's amazing just as is!!!!

This is a regular request for birthday desserts in my family.  It is a hit every time I take it somewhere. I am always asked for the recipe.  I never take leftovers home with me which makes my family sad.

I made this recipe with a Halloween twist for a small get together with friends. I followed the recommendations of users and whipped 1/2 pint of heavy whipping cream until fluffy; this was folded into the water/pudding/condensed milk - this layer becomes thick and almost custard-like and contrasted nicely with the whipped cream layers. As I was concerned about the "processed taste" of cool whip, I whipped a second 1/2 pint of heavy whipping cream for the whipped cream layers. These were whipped in divided doses (two 1/4 pints). The first batch was whipped with 1 tbsp powdered sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla, and orange food colouring. The second was whipped with 1 tsp powdered sugar, as I didn't want this layer to be overwhelmingly sweet. I didn't have a trifle dish, so I layered the trifle into a deep glass bowl. It may have been due to the size of the bowl (although it was only medium sized), I was wishing I had more of all the layers; I was forced to carefully ration and spread each layer, because I didn't have enough. Next time, I will ensure to increase the recipe (or at least the pudding abdominal whipped topping layers) by 50-100% to avoid this mishap (unless making a smaller trifle). Nevertheless, I made it work. I layered brownie with few dispersed candy corns, pudding mix, orange vanilla flavoured sweet cream, brownie & candy corns, pudding mix, plain whipped cream, topped with a dusting of unsweetened cocoa powder and candy corn. 

This is a delicious but very heavy dessert

I have made this recipe with instant pudding mix and Cool Whip, but it is way better if you make homemade whipped cream and homemade chocolate custard. Add layers of raspberries to make it truly brilliant; I gave it 5 stars if you make it the way I recommend.  Otherwise, it tastes, well, like Cool whip and instant pudding, if you like those flavors.

My coworkers loved this so much when I brought this on top of the banana trifle I normally bring. It's even better when I added a homemade caramel sauce on top of the brownies. 
Warning though, it's very rich, but EXTREMELY delicious!

I brought this dessert in a trifle bowl to an event, and it got rave reviews. I was short on time, so used 2 pkgs of Two Bite Brownies for the brownies, and I used Mousse instead of the pudding. It would delicious! I didn't want to totally double the recipe, but needed alot, so used more cool whip than the recipe called more. You could use alot of different variations, like Heath Bar on the top and so forth, but it's definitely a keeper.

I have made this several times now and EVERYONE loves it.  I use regular milk instead of sweetened condensed milk and dark chocolate chips instead of a crushed candy bar b/c it is VERY sweet.  It's a delight though and now my go to trifle!!!

This recipe was for sure a complete, total hit with my family. I made this dessert for Christmas, and I put a FAKE poinsetta flower on the top for decoration. It definetly got that "ohh ahh" reaction. I used heath peices of candy and everyone LOVED it. I baked brownies with chocolate chip peices inside so there was an extra crunch factor. I am saving this recipe for another time =)

I did make my brownies from scratch.  I also made my whipped cream for the second layer, but I did get lazy and use Cool Whip for the Cool Whip layer.  I think it was delicious like that, but next time I think I will make my own whipped cream for the Cool Whip layer as well.  It's just so much better than way!  This desert is amazing!

I've made this twice, with variations, and it was wonderful. The first time I used toffee bits instead of a candy bar.  The second time I decided to make a Christmas variation.  I used sugar cookies instead of brownies, and I added a few drops of mint flavoring to the pudding mixture.  Instead of a candy bar, I used crushed candy canes and chocolate chips. I sprinkled crushed candy canes on top. Pretty and gorgeous!

This was a HUGE hit.  We used the fudge version of the brownies, and kit kats for our chocolate bar.  It was a great Christmas Day dessert after our awesome meal!

Taste-wise a 5.  Way too rich for for some of my guests but overall a big hit.  It makes a ton.  I used fun sized Butterfingers.

It was a hit at the party, but I felt it was too sweet. I think some sort of cream cheesy layer would cut the sweetness well. It was beautiful though.

I tried this and it was delicious. I did make some changes I used heavy whipping cream and half and half instead of condensed milk. Also I added strawberries and used Ghirardelli Brownies as the base.

I made the pudding following the directions on the box minus a half cup of milk then substituted the other half cup with a half cup of sour cream, it's less sweet without the condensed milk  and also I added 1tsp coffee crystals  in the brownie mix.  WONDERFUL

This was an easy, tasty dessert that also looked great! I substituted layers of strawberries for the 12 oz of whipped cream - so mine was brownies, the pudding layer, strawberries/blueberries as the layers and was really happy with it!

I tried to follow the recipe as it was and the pudding mixture was gooey and clumpy. I ended up using another recipe to make chocolate mousse and used that in place of the pudding mixture and it was really good.

I fixed this for Valentines Day and my BF loved it. It really isn't too sweet and much better after being in the fridge a day or two. I will be making this again. I did use skor candy bars chopped - already in the bag and I also drizzled the caramel topping over the brownie chunks.  It was very good. Make sure you have lots of people to share it with otherwise you will eat more of it than you want! Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I agree with others in that this recipe "needed something" to make it complete, otherwise it would have just been a chocolate cool whip treat with a little brownie on top. Of course I didn't have the fancy ingredients that other reviewers had recommended but also I am always accommodating the needs of a little one that has peanut allergies so instead I made a quick fix and it was good. Fix #1 - I only mixed half of the cool whip called for into the pudding mixture to cut down on the fluffiness; Fix #2 - I layered as follows Brownie, pudding mixture, brownie, pudding mixture and cool whip on top. I would have added a third layer of a rich fudgy syrup over the brownie but we had to serve it on the side again to accommodate food allergies. This way it tasted more like a rich gooey brownie treat with a little cool whip on top. The contrast between the cool whip and brownie wasn't as harsh this way. Yes, I know, not true to original recipe but this worked for us.

It's better if you use a cake mix instead, and Thankyou Brand pudding.I drizzle about 1/2 cup of Irish Cream on the cake layers before I put the pudding layer on and then sprinkle crushed Heath Candy bars on top of each layer of Cool Whip. The cake isn't as heavy as the brownie is, so you can eat a lot more of it.

LOVE THIS RECIPE!  Once you make it, be prepared to make it AGAIN and AGAIN!  I've made this trifle at least 20 times - it's requested at each and every church function.  Ignore suggestions to modify the recipe, as it's just perfect as written (and extremely easy to make).  Looks almost too pretty to eat in a trifle bowl, especially with melted milk chocolate drizzled on top!  :)

Wow!  This was really wonderful!  Very rich and delicious!  I did save a few calories by using sugar-free pudding and light whipped topping.  Also didn't have the chocolate bar for garnish so used Oreo cookie crumbles instead which worked very well.  Will certainly make again!

I made this for a family dinner and it was a HUGE success! I have three adult sons, two daughter-in-laws, husband and myself and we STILL had half leftover. It is RICH and DELICIOUS for not a lot of effort. I followed ROXANNE'S modifications because they sounded GREAT! It was! Thanks for the terrific recipe!

i made this for christmas! People loved it. i took some advice like using the heavy whipping cream and awesome! also i used vanilla flavored cool whip instead of regular and it was good but i didnt like it so much it added more sugary taste. overall everyone love it but note to self use regular cool whip:) but if you have a sweet tooth then definately use vanilla!

This was good!!  The only set back is that the brownie pieces were a bit too hard for my grandmother.  I also added caramel sauce (drizzled heavily)and crushed heath bar pieces on top of each whip topping layer.  DELICIOUS!!!!!

I followed many people's advice and did not add cool whip to the pudding but instead whipped heavy whipping cream. I also added a layer of raspberries on top.  I did put a very small layer of cool whip between the pudding/cream mixture and the raspberries for color variation.

I have been told not to make this again by my husband, because he couldn't stop eating it :) I followed other's suggestions of using whipping cream with the pudding mix, toffee bits, caramel, and french vanilla cool whip. I also used homemade brownies, but it would have  good with a good boxed brownie too. Since there's no fruit, it didn't get soggy the next day, and in fact was just as good for at least 3 days after making (that's as long as it lasted around here). I'll be making this easy, delicious recipe again soon!

This has become the replacement for my birthday cakes in our house (my OWN birthdays, that is). The one change I make, which another user here mentioned, is to replace one layer of the whipped topping with the French Vanilla flavored topping. I'd also suggest that you use/make brownies that are "cakey" enough to be able to soak a lot of the pudding and cream. And a brownie with chocolate chips or chunks in it is nice, because having them in some of your bites makes for a nice contrast in textures.

Also, make the day before and let it sit in the fridge to give the brownies a chance to soak up more of the creams and pudding.

This is really good!  I doubled the recipe to make a huge amount for a cookout.   The only thing I did different was use real whipping cream, and used brownies with nuts in them.   Make sure to make it a day ahead so the pudding can set up.   Will be making this again!

This is an easy dessert  and  big hit with everyone.  I used angel food cake in place of the brownies. It made it very light dessert and not too sweet.  It was  a perfect end to Thanksgiving dinner.

I make this for nearly every event that I need to bring a dessert.  If I venture out and make something different, I disappoint the crowd.  I mix it up a little and add different candy toppings.  Sometimes peanut butter cups other times Snickers.
The only problem is there is never enough:)

YUM YUM YUM!!! I have made this dish about 5 times already...so delish!! My husband requests this all time time and he doesn't have as much of a sweet tooth as I do so I was surprised he raved about it so much. I added some fresh cut strawberries which gives it a great flavor and really gives a beautiful presentation. I also took the advice of another reviewer and made fresh whipped cream in lieu of the prepackaged. Thanks for sharing!

Had this for dessert at super bowl party - it was a huge hit.  I had never made a trifle before, so was a little worried.  I did use the french vanilla cool whip and think it was a good choice.  Will definitely be making this for office parties.

I made this for my book club ladies, following the suggestion to use chocolate pudding (not instant) and wgipping cream. also used Baileys.   next time I will not include the condensed milk, it was too rich for most of us.

What a fun and time-saving recipe! Followed some of the user recommendations to tweak a bit: Used store-bought brownies (one package iced, one package uniced), used cheesecake pudding instead of chocolate, used homemade whipped cream instead of Cool Whip, excluded sweetened condensed milk and candy, drizzled caramel sauce on each layer of whipped cream. Folks could not get enough of it! Next time I will add graham crackers or graham cracker crumbs to it - super yum!

I have made this several times now, everyone just loves it. My mother isn't a big chocolate eater and she loved it. I have made it exactly by the recipe and a few times differently. Once I used chocolate chips in the layers and another time I used a container of Chocolate cool whip instead of the regular mixed in with the chocolate pudding. Loved it that way! Thanks for the recipe!

I used King Arthur's Brownie mix (for those of us with allergies). It was AWESOME! Even my picky husband, who doens't like dessert, except silk pie, liked it. I did add vanilla to the one cool whip. I sprinkled with Enjoy Life chocolate chips. Will make again!

This recipe was so easy and so awesome!  I didn't have a candy bar on hand (after my Husband ate it) so I used mini chocolate chips on top and added them to my brownies to make them extra fudgy.  This recipe is very filling so we are eating it in small portions even though it makes alot!

This was great!  I made double chocolate brownies from scratch for the recipe, but I think what made it really good was the chocolate pudding mixture, which I followed exactly but mixed in a block of cream cheese...it was amazing!  I also drizzled caramel sundae syrup over the brownie peices, as suggested by another reviewer.  Oh, and I also used the extra creamy cool whip which made it nice and rich. Thanks for the recipe; I will definitely make it again!

I found this recipe on here several years ago and have been making it ever since. The first time I made it my hubby fell in love, as did I. I have made this for several family functions and everyone raved over this. This recipe is a keeper!

I made this with ROXANNE323's suggestions, and it is very good.  I mixed up the whipping cream/pudding and put it in a covered container because I didn't want to make the whole trifle just yet, but I wanted one for myself.  Everything is in its respective container if I want to make more mini-trifles or one bigger trifle. Keeping the ingredients on hand would be a good way to ensure a quick dessert if needed. I'm having mine right now, and it's a very indulgent but oh-so-worth-it snack.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This is absolutely divine! I have made this twice for two different parties and recieved huge praise! The first time I made it, I added strawberries on the top of each cool whip layer, which was delcious, but my strawberries started going bad the next day, so I don't think we were able to finish the leftovers. The 2nd time I made it, I added chocolate syrup and caramel sauce on top of the brownie layers and then on top for decoration! That was absolutely amazing!!! I highly suggest giving it a try!

I have made this recipe now several times and every time it is a huge hit!  I have also made alterations and use real whip cream and sugar.  Because I love short cuts I do use Two Bite Brownies instead of making them - Yum!!  I too add Skor bits but also put in some Butterscotch syrup as it adds a lovely texture to the trifle.  Last alteration, I dress it up with fresh strawberries when in season!  Great recipe to play with and make your own - thanks for the base!!!

Great dessert!  It has everything I love (chocolate and, pudding, and whipped cream) rolled into one!   To make this recipe 5 stars, I'd take the advice of some of the other reviews and replace the cool whip layer with actual homemade whipped cream (made from heavy whipping cream and some sugar).  The flavor made a huge difference...much more sophisticated.  As a twist, I also made this with a layer of sliced strawberries and I really enjoyed it.  The only thing about adding fresh fruit, however, is that the leftovers don't refridgerate as well.

Wow!  This is a great recipe.  I did follow the advice of others and make my own whipped cream.  I also make my brownies with Milkways, so drizzled a bit more caramel sauce over the brownie layer.  It is defiantely rich, but soooo worth it.  Rave reviews from all my friends.  One of my new favorite recipes for guests and family.

I rarely do reviews, but I had to rave about this one! This is incredibly yummy and even tasted better the next day.  I had never mixed dry pudding mix w/ sweetened condensed milk...sensational!  Next time, I'm going to add Heath bits to the layers for an extra crunch! :)

Excellent! I added Heath Crunch bits and caramel over the brownie layers. A ring of walnuts to the outter top layer and in the center A huge heep of finely shaved chocolate. Took this to a block party where it was a sensation! Also used all fat free sugar free ingredients if available for a slightly lower calorie count.

Very rich, but very delicious.  I used carmel syrup and heath bits instead of candy bars.  I would like to try it with a little less carmel and possiblly vanilla pudding to make it a a little less chocolatey, but it is excellent as is too.

Oh my gosh, this is pure heaven in a bowl! And very very versatile! Make as as is... OR... replace brownies with angel food cake or pound cake, use vanilla, cheesecake, or lemon pudding instead of chocolate, and add berries!

This recipe is very rich, but very good!  I followed other's advice and added the toffee pieces and the caramel.  I also made my own whipped cream for one of the layers.  Everyone loved this and I have shared the recipe with numerous people.  It's definitely a keeper!

I made this for Valentines Day and it was really good. You have to like chocolate and whip cream to like this.

This was okay. I won't make it again though. To me there was too much pudding / whip cream and it left an icky film in my mouth after eating. :-( And I can't believe I'm saying this, but this was even too sweet for me!

So easy, and so awesome !!  Too make it even easier I used 2 store-bought marble pound cakes.  I also used a 16 oz size whipped cream.  (instead of 12) You can never have too much Cool Whip! YUM...

This was delicious!!  Although, we layered ours a little differently.  The first 2 layers were the same but then we combined 2 (8 oz) frozen whipped toppings for the 3rd layer because we couldn't find the 12oz. Then we followed that with the other half of the pudding mix and then the rest of the brownies.  Everyone raved about it!!

AMAZING!! So Delicious. I couldn't find the vanilla cool whip, and so I decided to use homemade whipped cream for both the cool whips called for. I do not regret it! It actually sat in my fridge for 3 days before we ate it (tempting me the whole time!) and when we finally ate it, I couldn't believe how thick and mousse-like the chocolate pudding and whipped cream were. I think letting it sit a long time contributed to that. We loved it!

The type brownies probably make a huge difference, but, this just wasn't that good. The mixture was not as creamy as I had hoped either.

This scored in at a 4.5 by my hubbie. Made this for a dish to pass at a super bowl party and went over well. I used reduced fat brownie mix, fat free cool whip, fat-free sweetened condensed milk. I drizzled a little bit of carmel topping on the layers of brownie (a little will go along way) and crushed up a few heath candy bars and sprinkled them on the brownie layer for extra crunch. This is very rich but definitely hits the spot for chocolate lovers! It filled up my trifle bowl to the top.

My friend makes requests for this trifle.  I made it for dinner and everyone asked if they could take some home.  I like to make it the day before, the brownies soak up more moisture and melt in your mouth.

My trifle bowl got a workout over the holidays because I made this 3 times in 2 weeks for different crowds and everyone loved it.  It turned out perfectly every time.  I used 1/2 pint whipping cream mixed with the pudding instead of another Cool Whip llike someone suggested.  Rich and delicious!!

I have made a lot of truffles in the past couple of years but this one is my favorite.   I made it just as the recipe called except I added a little bit of milk in the jello mixture and also added a layer of canned cherries.  So good!!! I took it to my parents on Christmas day for the dessert and everyone just loved it.

I made this recipe yesterday for New Year's Day dinner.  OMG...it was the biggest hit!  I used the Bits of Brickle on top of the Cool Whip for a little crunch.  It is absolutely decadent!!  Everybody loved it!  I will make this over and over again.  It would be wonderful with crushed Oreo's on top, drizzled with hot fudge, caramel. You are only limited by your imagination and taste. It is awesome just the way it is!  Thank you so much to the person who sent in this recipe!!! What a winner!  I'm not a dessert person, but this one got me!

Great dessert!  I made individual trifles and added strawberries.  They were a huge hit!  Im making this again for a Holiday party tomorrow but in a trifle bowl this time instead of the individuals.  I also decided to double up on all the ingredients since I found there wasnt a whole lot last time.  This is so easy to make and a definite crowd pleaser!

This tasted very good, but you have to be a chocolate lover! I made my own brownies for the recipe and they were fudgy brownies so it was all very chocolaty! My family members liked it though.

Sooo rich!  Had it for Thanksgiving as a change of pace and oh my it was perfect!  It goes a long way too!  Only change was that I used dark chocolate brownies because that is what I had on hand.

This is so easy and so delicious! I ended up doubling the chocolate pudding mixture and used 2 containers of whipped topping in order to fill up my bowl with the layers.   I put a Hersey bar in the freezer for a couple of hours then shaved it with a knife then sprinkled the shavings over the top.   I will definitely be making this over and over again! Thanks for sharing!

I loved this!  I didn't use sweetened condensed milk, i just mixed some real milk and the whipped topping until it was pretty thick.  This made the dessert not so overpowering.  Not to sweet.

Too sweet. The condensed milk is what makes it too sweet in my opinion. Next time if I make it I will use the pudding mix with regular milk and add the whipped cream.

I didn't have a trifle bowl so I made it in my cake plate/punch bowl combo because I couldn't find another glass bowl that would give the same visual appearance of the layered presentation.  I topped it with crushed heath bars for a little added flavor and crunch.  It turned out beautifully and everyone really enjoyed this.

My husband and I enjoyed this dessert.  I followed directions to the exact ingredients.  It wasn't too sweet for us.  Next time I do think I'll make my own whipping for the pudding mixture and use vanilla cool whip as suggested by others.

I made this dessert twice and the bowl came back to me empty both times! Took all the suggestions from Roxanne323. Definitely a dessert I am now known for in the neighborhood. Thanks for sharing

Made this for a Brownie lover for labor day cook out, it was so pretty I was taking pictures on the camera phone and sending it out..anyway followed all of the directions but added a layer of strawberries into the rotation, which was a mouth watering with all the chocolate. Broke the brownie up in bite size..and instead of toffee or candy bar used mini chocolate chips, SO pretty, SO good!

I did not like the taste of the condensed milk in this trifle at all. I added heavy cream to try to mellow it out. I prefer the Death by Chocolate recipe from this site more, which is almost the same thing as this trifle only way way [in my opinion]. I only tried this one because it had more ratings so I thought it must be better. But I'll be sticking with that one from now on

This is a very rich desert but can be altered a little to make a wonderful summer cookout finisher! I used fat free sweetened condensed milk, light cool whip for the layers and topped with blue berries- I totally left out the chocolate candy because the brownies make this desert rich enough! This a total crowd pleaser!!! Enjoy :)

Awesome recipe, however, I altered it a bit.  I baked the brownies in paper liners in muffin tins.  When I removed them, I pressed down the center of each brownie cupcake w/the back of a spoon, making a well.  When the brownies cooled, I added the chocolate mousse recipe and added the cool whip on top.  Everyone loved them!   Debbi

This is a great dessert for a big gathering - it makes a lot.  The women loved it and wanted the recipe.  It is easy to prepare.  I did not allow enough refidgerater time and so I put it in the freezer for an hour to speed up the set-up process.  It worked great!

I made this trifle for my husband to take to a work party. Everyone thought the dish was so pretty and tasted wonderful! I made brownies using the MMMMM...Brownies recipe from this site. I also made the Thick Chocolate Pudding recipe from this site. I topped with a coarsly broken Symphony Toffee & Nut Candy Bar. Making everything from scratch was time consuming, but it tastes so good! I'll be making this trifle again. Thanks for sharing!

I've made this recipe many times and the result was always a clean trifle bowl.  I couldn't say enough positive things about this dessert!  So easy, yet a masterpiece.  Not only is it beautiful, but you can add your favorite toppings, like caramel or hot fudge (drizzled lightly over the top of the brownie layer), toffee bits on top, or even some delicious berries.  Try it, you won't regret it!

A chocolate lover's dream!  I made minor changes - I used a little less Cool Whip in the layers to make it fit in my serving dish, and I also crumbled up the brownies instead of cutting them into squares.  Delicious!

I made this today for Easter dinner dessert.  Everybody loved it and my husband couldn't have enough or been prouder (his family).  The only changes I made to the recipe is I used mint chocolate pudding and sprinkled Heath toffee pieces between the pudding layer and whipped cream.  Came out great and only one serving left in the bowl.  Thanks for a great recipe and one so easy to make!

I've made this several times for big parties and it's always completely gone!!!  When I bake the brownies (with walnuts..yum), I add an extra egg so it's more cake-like and I add heavy whipping cream to the pudding rather than Cool Whip.  I add toffee bits to the layers.  It's a beautiful, fun and easy dish!

Very good!!!  I'd pour the coffee over the cake next time to make the cake more moist (instead I put instant coffee into the pudding mix- good flavour).  It almost needed more pudding.....or less cake...good with 1 Skor crushed up onto each whipped cream layer.

This dessert was fabulous. I used real whipping cream and made my own, sweetening with 1 c. confectioners sugar and 1 t. vanilla in place of the tub of cool whip.  I added freshed sliced strawberries between the layers since they are in season right now and the splash of color made for such beautiful presentation.  This recipe is absolutely decadent and chocolate lovers will go crazy over this one. Be prepared to share the recipe.

Great recipe to play with!  I made "Quick and Easy brownies" and  "Hasty Chocolate pudding" from allrecipes to go in my trifle.  I layered cubed brownies, caramel sundae sauce, choc pudding, chopped up Mars bars, and real whipped cream.  It was beautiful and delicious!  Everyone was AMAZED!

chocolate heaven. so delicious. i did make my own whipped cream to replace cool whip, and sprinkled heath bar over any cool whip layer and drizzled caramel on top.  without the heath, or the caramel, it would've been way too 'meh'..but WITH those ingredients, it was pefect! people went back for FOURTHS!

This was excellent. Bewar:, this is very rich, very chocolatey.  But very good.  I did add caramel over the brownies and added chocolate toffee pieces for crunch.  It looks nice to when presented in a trifle bowl.

This is great!  I make it with devils food cake and after the cake cools I poke holes in it and pour in 1/4 cup of amoretto liqeur.  Also, I make the whipped cream from scratch.  On top of each layer of whipped cream I sprinkle crumbled up bits of Heath bar, so it ends with the heath bar topping on top.

This is a great recipe! I did not have a brownie mix so I used a chocolate fudge cake mix instead. I just crumbed the warm cake into a bowl and used it in the layers. It is even better after it has been in the refrigerator over night!! Yummy!!

Divine, heavenly, and other out of this world descriptions.  This is so good.  It makes a lot, so I have to wait until I need to take a dessert somewhere to make it again.  My husband and I do not need to eat this by ourselves, and trust me we would!  I used a brownie mix with chocolate chunks and I used French Vanilla flavored cool whip in the layers.  Enjoy

Everyone loved this. It was gone by the time we left on Christmas Eve. It was a little sweet for my taste, but it's a crowd pleaser. 
I used French Vanilla Cool Whip, real whipping cream, toffee bits and caramel. 
For the chocolate curls, I used mini hershey's bars, a little bit warmer than room temp and shaved the curls off with the carrot peeler. Gorgeous!!! Thanks, this was fun to make. Less annoying than baking myriads of cookies.

Another hit from Allrecipes!  I took this to a holiday party and it was gone in no time.  Looks lovely and based on the reviews, I too made my own whipped cream in lieu of Cool Whip (I don't like the taste of Cool Whip).  I also used store bought pudding instead of instant.  But everyone loved it!  Topped with sliced strawberries!

I LOVE THIS DESSERT!  I have made this a couple times now and everyone loves it!  I will continue to make it over and over.  I need to make this with my new favorite brownies by Ghirardelli.

This was my first attempt at a trifle. I'm not a dessert maker, but I had so much fun making this. I added strawberries to the edge of the brownie layer - it looked even prettier and they tasted great. Next time I'll add more. I followed other suggestions and used real cream in the pudding layer. However, next time I'll beat it longer because it was a little runny. Tasted great, but thicker would have been prettier.

This recipe was very good.  I drizzled the brownies in kahluah and added crushed heath bars to the layers, which definitly enhanced the trifle.  It was quite heavy and I think I may use chocolate cake insead of brownie next time, but overall, very good

ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!
I MADE THIS FOR THE SECOND TIME NOW.  I FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS ACCORDING TO THE MOST HELPFUL REVIEW, AND WHIPPED MY OWN CREAM.  I HAD NO POWDERED SUGAR, SO I DISOLVED A COUPLE TSP. IN 1/4C. HOT WATER.  IT WHIPPED UP WITH IT JUST FINE. 
I'D RECOMMEND NOT MIXING THE PUDDING W/ WATER UNTIL JUST RIGHT BEFORE YOU MIX THE WHIPPING CREAM & PUDDING TOGETHER.  I ALSO ADDED STRAWBERRIES TO THE LAYER, AND DID A HOLIDAY TWIST BY ADDING SOME MINT CHIPS AS SNOWFLAKES, W/ A STRAWBERRY FLOWER IN THE MIDDLE, AS I SAW IN A PICTURE. WONDERFUL.  MIXING THE PUDDING & WHIPPING CREAM FOR THE ONE LAYER MADE IT TASTE LIKE CHOCOLATE MOOSE!

We first found this recipe on Mother's day 2006. Everyone raved. Have since made it one of our favorites and always have someone ask for the recipe when I bring it. This truly is a great recipe you will love. I have made it with fresh berries instead of chocolate bars and that is just as heavenly.

As is, this dessert is MUCH too sweet and way too processed whipped cream. I made it for my hubby, and he loved it. I think this would definitely be a 5 star if I make again following suggestions here to make my own whipped creme with less sugar. It'll also taste less processed. Overall a good recipe though.

This was SO YUMMY and soooo easy! I made it the day before Thanksgiving and covered it. I also used real whipping cream instead of cool whip. It was gone in 5 minutes of me putting it out!

My first impression and my company's was not 5 stars, actually I was disappointed bec I planned on impressing company based on the reviews. I discovered the next day that you have to let it sit in the frige for awhile and let the flavors settle into one and another. Make in the a.m. to serve in the evening is fine. Then, pure heaven!

This recipe was a huuuuuge hit at Thanksgiving.  I ended up doubling the recipe and used vanilla pudding for one of the layers instead of the chocolate.  Personally, I thought this was too sweet.  However, my guests all loved it.  For Christmas I will modify this recipe by using only 1/2 can of condensed milk and regular milk for the other half, and make my own heavy whipping cream instead of the cool whip.  I also added chocolate pieces with caramel drizzle inside.  I will also omit this since it was too sweet.

You must be doing something wrong if this doesn't turn out perfect!  This recipe is so simple and delicious.  I made it for a work function and now I have people ask me to make it for their birthdays.  They tell me it is their new favorite.  I will be taking it to Thanksgiving dinner...where it has been requested the last 3 years!

Great dessert.  Very easy to make.  It does make a lot though.  Followed the recipe but made the following additions:  drizzled the brownies with some Grand Marnier and added some orange sections on top of each brownie layer.

I didn't love the recipe as written - it was too sweet for me - and thats saying a lot.  The next time i made it, I used unsweetened real whipped cream to mix in the pudding - and it was way better.  I also through in some strawberries.

This is amazing!  I have made this for more than a dozen parties, and it is raved about every time.  The only problem with it is that it is just sooooooo rich and yummy!  When I want to impress I make it in a trifle dish.  When I just want a quick and easy dessert, I bake the brownies in a 9X12 and then add the 2 layers on top.  Simple and delicious!

This is a great recipe to make for parties.  I used dark brownie mix and whipped my own whipped cream omitting any extra sugar because reviews said it was too sweet.  And I added fresh raspberries in the layer.  Mmmm

Not sure how it tasted since I don't like Chocolate but it looked AMAZING.  The people I made it for loved it.  The only thing I did different was add some chocolate chip cookies (they were broken bits that were in the freezer) to the layers with the brownies and then used full cookies to line the top of the dish like I saw on the recipe for Chocolate Chip Trifle on this site.   Very easy and looks impressive!

This was pretty good but I thought with all of the great reviews, I would have liked it more.  I usually just layer the chocolate cake, prepared sugar free chocolate pudding, cool whip and toffee bits and my husband said that he likes my version better.  I did make my own whipped cream for the mousse layer so between that and the condensed milk, it added a ton of calories.  I think I'll stick to my version.

This was very good.  As others suggested, I used skim milk in place of the condenced milk. I also used devils food pudding instead of regular chocolate.  I made this for a bridal shower and the left overs were eaten by my husband (who doesnt love chocolate) within an hour of bringing it home. Would definately make again!

Very Very Very Yummy! I made this recipe twice...First, I followed it exactly to the instructions and it was good and I recieved many compliments. However, I did "tweak" it a bit and it made it super duper easy. I baked the brownies as specified...for the filling I used the pre-made chocolate pudding cups (that you find in the refridgerator section of the supermarket) and cool whip chocolate & creamy varieties. I layer the brownies, then the pudding, then the chocolate cool whip then the creamy variety and repeat.

Another keeper!!! My sister called and said she needed some brownies for a going away gathering at work. I thought ok brownies, but let me boost it up a notch.  So I decided to go with this recipe.  It was an office hit, she called and said the trifle bowl was empty, and it was terrific!!!  I used the Duncan Hines chewy fudge brownies.  Maybe next time I'll be able to try it personally :(

I've made this a few times and every time it is gone in minutes. Everyone seems to enjoy this sweet trifle.
In addition to the shaved chocolate, I have placed squares of chocolate on top.Makes a nice presentation.

We love this trifle, but we always use choc. cake  instead of the brownies, just a preference.  Love the sweetened condensed milk with the pudding! Update: only had about 1/3 can sweetened condensed milk after using it in a different recipe, so added 1/3 cup caramel ice cream topping and 1/2 cup whipping cream!  Turned out just as good, if not better!! Also, if I don't have chocolate pudding I will use cheesecake or white chocolate and add a couple teaspoons of cocoa powder to it.

This recipe was awesome! Its easy and so good! Everyone in our family loved it! We followed the advice of some reviewers and only used half a cup of the sweet milk and made home made whip cream for the pudding. We also used 1/4 of baileys instead of water and used vanilla cool whip. Sooooo good! We will be making this  a lot!

I have made this recipe twice now and did it differently both times. The first time I followed the directions precisely and it turned out very good. The second time I added my own touch to it by using homemade whipped cream rather than store bought as well as toasting pecans and adding them in between the layers with mini choc. chips. This version is to die for! My guests absolutely loved it. I think the little bit that was left over was even better the second day, too! (I also used fat free sw. cond. milk and couldn't taste a difference)

I made this desert for a family gathering and EVERYONE loved it! I did make a couple changes though. Instead of putting chocolate shavings on top i put crushed oreos and i also added some in between the layers, and instead of making one big thing, i bought miniature cups and made individual ones. They were gone within an hour and i had several requests to make them again!

This recipe is fantastic! I used chunky chocolate brownies and Heath topping which added some nice crunch. My chocolate layer came out a little thinner than I would have liked, but the taste was phenomenal. It was very rich, though so goes a long way. It was so easy to make, and looked great. I will definitely be making this one again!!

I was responsible for making a dessert for my womens group that meets once a month.  EVERYONE asked for the recipe.  Made it exactly as described.  Very rich and very easy to make.  Next time I will do what others suggested by using heavy whipping cream.  If you love chocolate, you'll love this.

This is an easy dessert that everyone will love.  I used about 1 1/4 cup of heavy cream wipped into the pudding mixture instead of the whipped cream the recipe called for. Once the browines came out of the oven i coverd them in Chocolate fudge ice cream topping, while it cooled. I also took carmel and drizzled over the top of each browine layer and took one heath bar and crumbled it and put half on each browine layer.  It was awsome, the heath bar gave it a good crunch every now and then.

I found this way too sweet, even with the following changes: 1) added just 1/3 cup of sweetened condensed milk to the pudding mixture, and substituted a 1/2 pint unsweetened whipped cream for the whipped topping (in the pudding mixture), and  2)substituted a 1/2 pint of lightly sweetened vanilla-extract-flavored whipped cream (for the whipped topping) in between the layers. I used a broken up Skor bar on top which added a nice touch. My family loved it, but, again, I found it to be too sweet. I think that next time I'll use my own not-so-sweet brownie recipe.

For a divorced middle-agged man, this is great! I took it to a Church function, and it was a big hit. I added strawberries and did the whipping cream as suggested, and the ladies kept saying that chocolate and strawberries were going to get me a woman real quick! I don't know about that, but I do know I am going to keep this recipe on hand.

10 stars. Everyone loved it. I used heavy whipping cream in place of cool whip, since the cream tastes so much better and richer.

I will be making this many, many times.

I made this recipe for the 4th of July holiday and it turned out delicious.  My kids begged me to let them eat the whole thing in one sitting and my guests have emailed me requesting "my" recipe.  I added some toffee and chocolate bits to the turtle brownie mix I used and whipped some heavy cream as others suggested.  It was really good and not too sweet.  It's a really flexible and easy recipe too so thumbs up from me and for me!!!

You cannot beat this for presentation and taste.  It is a family favorite, and I had to stop "saving" it for special occasions only, as we all love it.

Made this for a cookout this summer and it turned out great!! I did cheat though to save time and dishes and bought already made brownies unfrosted from the grocery store bakery.

Do not use sweetened condensed milk with the pudding, because it would be wayyyyy too sweet.  I would follow the instant pudding recipe from the pudding box.  If you don't like too much cool whip, you can use heavy whipping cream to the pudding, but do not use all 8 oz of it, cause then it's going to turn into mousse (unless that's what you want).  I would definitely make this dessert again, but with a few alternations.

This dish was fantastic - a huge hit at our party, we had 15 people so it's a good dessert to make for a crowd. I did have some problems - my pudding didn't set (waited 20 mins) and only set when it was put together and left in the fridge for a few hours....not a big deal except I didn't get the distict layers of brownie, whip cream and pudding - the pudding sunk into the brownie. Also I decided to use real whip cream to cut the sweetness and only added a little of real vanilla while whipping. For a crowd of 15 I doubled the recipe - such a GREAT dessert!!

UPDATE - The second time I made it I used even more brownie and let the pudding set longer before assembling the dish....so yummy!!!

This is the first thing I made from this website and all I can say It is wonderful. I made it for a baby shower and everybody went on and on about it. I think the only one that was upset was the grandma of the mom to be because she made homemade apple pie and not one piece was taken out of either of them. A+++ thanks for a great recipe

Everyone loved this!  I used Banana Angel Delight instead of instant chocolate pudding mix as I'm in the UK (and Banana was the only flavour I had at the time) and folded in whipped fresh cream to that instead of coolwhip, layering with the whipped cream too.  I then crumbled a Cadbury's Flake bar over the top - mmm.  If I used Banana Angel Delight again I would also layer in some sliced banana on top of the brownie too.  Will definately use this recipe again as it is so easy to make - just a shame you have to leave it in the fridge so long before eating!

I used the suggestions about the heavy whipping cream and caramel.  I don't think I used enough caramel because the taste was not very noticable.  I made a double recipe for a party and I also made individual cups of the trifle.  It was like those mud cups for kids only the adult version.  It was a little more time consuming but created less of a mess and the cups were easily disposed.  Great combo with the brownie!  I will probably make this again

I was a bit hesitant to make this since I'm not a fan of instant pudding and Cool Whip.  However, I needed a quick and simple recipe so I went for it... FABULOUS!  I used a brownie mix with mini Hershey's kisses and it was delightful.  Very rich, a small portion will definitely satisfy a sweet tooth!

This recipe is always requested among my family and co-workers.  I make a more simplified version. I use a layer of brownies, a layer of regular chocolate pudding (prepared with a little less milk for a richer pudding) and a layer of crushed Skor candy bars then repeat those three layers again then top with cool whip.  For the cook on the go I will substitute the crushed candy bars with the toffee chips and use triple chunk brownie mix for the added chocolate which is left out if you do not use the Skor candy bars.  This is for the chocolate lover.  We call this dish Chocolate Goop.

WOW!  This is absolutely delicious!  But next time, I am going to omit the sweetened milk as it was little too sweet for our taste.  I also only used 16 oz. of whipped topping.

This was wonderful and the longer it sits in the fridge, the better it gets!!  I did go by the view reccomendations to use heavy cream, instead of whipping cream, in the mouse.  I also added the carmel and used bitter sweet chocolate to the top for garnish (which was a nice contrast to the really sweet brownies)  I highly recommend this and I will be making it again, and again, and again!

Addicting, but really not worth the calories.  Yes it tastes good, but I would have been better off just eating the brownies alone for a chocolate fix, with the amount of fat in this recipe.  Also, I tried the modification someone mentioned where they used heavy cream in the chocolate mixture and left out the evaporated milk and cool whip.  I would not recommend this.  First of all, you end up mixing the pudding mix just with a 1/2 cup water, when it normally requires 2 cups of milk, so you start with a very pasty chocolate thing, to which you add your whipped cream.  Although the chocolate mixture had a good overall taste, it was very heavy, and there was much less of it than there would have been had I made it with evaporated milk and cool whip.

IF YOU NEED TO CUT THE PREP TIME IN HALF READ THIS REVIEW!!! 
This recipe is absolutely yummy! If you are tight on time, I used Little Debbie Fudge Brownies instead of making my own and it was delicious! I also drizzle caramel on top of the brownie layer and on top. Instead of shaving my own chocolate, I just used chocolate sprinkles. It really cuts down on the time to bake your own brownies and shave the chocolate. Hope this review helps! :)

so easy, and exceptionally tasty!  i've made it plenty of times using the recipe as is, but have also prepared it adding just a touch of mint flavor to the pudding mix, a few crushed up andes candies in the layers and then curled andes candies shaving to the top for a little taste twist!

When I first tasted this I thought it was just so so. And too sweet like some others. However, my company thought it was very good. The next day I ate some and thought it was really pretty good. I think the next time I make it I will still whip my cream fresh but not add the 3 TBLS. of sugar. Thanks.

Yum, made this for a small group mothers day church event and it was amaizing.  I used a turtle recipe brownie mix for the brownies and used heavy whipping cream instead of the whipped topping in the pudding layer.  I also used French Vanilla whipped topping and got a bag of Heath Bar peices and used that as a 4th layer and a garnish.  I made cookies and a carrot cake from scatch and this trifle was hands down everyones favorite.

I really liked this recipe.  I wanted a chilled dessert for our Mother's Day lunch and this was great!  I did a few modifications though.  First off, I added a layer of graham crackers to the bottom of the dish.  Also, I pretty much lightened everything up.  I used a lower-fat brownie mix, low calorie/sugar free pudding mixes, and fat free sweetened condensed milk and didn't think it tasted "lightened" at all!  Also, I used fat free milk instead of water for the pudding.  Next, instead of making both layers chocolate flavored pudding, I mixed a chocolate layer and white chocolate layer separately, using only half of the ingredients called for for each mixture.  Also, instead of chocolate shavings on top, I crumbled about 3 graham crackers into fine crumbs and sprinkled that on the top.  Just a few alterations but they were good.  Can't say how the original would taste as this was my first try.  It is a keeper though!

Out of this world! I did as others have suggested and used a little caramel sauce on the brownie bits. Also used homemade whipped cream in between the layers as well as the crumbled heath topping. Crazy rich and yummy!

This is soooo yummy!  The first time I made it, I follow the directions to a T.  The second time I made it, I changed it up a bit. For the brownie layer, I used store-bought brownie bites cut into chunks, drizzled caramel syrup over the top, and chopped up Reeces cups.  To the pudding layer, I added heavy cream (about a cup) and reduced some of the cool whip.  Both ways were delicious!  I can't wait to make this again!  It's very easy to make, beautiful, and easy to modify to suit your tastes!

My bible study group loved it!
I used Dark choclate brownie mix and drizzled caramel on the brownie layer after it was in the trifle bowl. I used crushed toffee for the candy bits.

Everyone loved the presentation and it got lots of compliments, I only gave it 4 stars just b/c I wasn't as impressed as I thought I'd be based on the other reviews.  It was good, but not amazing.

I did what many other reviewers suggested and that was to use 1/2 pint whipping cream w/ 3 T sugar as a substitute for the cool whip in the chocolate mousse layer, I think this was a good idea b/c otherwise it really would have just tasted like brownies w/ cool whip.  I also used the triple chunk brownie mix.  Will make again.

I made this for a party and everyone there loved it. By the end of the evening it was all gone. I made the recipe exactly as it was written and I loved it. It was really simply as well. I only chilled it for about 6 hours though instead of eight, but it still came out great.

FANTASTIC!! As suggested, I whipped my own topping (half pint of cream with 3 T. sugar)and folded it into the pudding and used french vanilla cool-whip for the cool-whip layer. I also added half a jar of caramel topping to the brownies before I cooked them. It was more than a hit! I was requested to make a double batch the next time I bring it. Even though it is rich, they couldn't get a big enough piece. I plan to exchange the french vanilla cool-whip layer for homemade whipped topping in the future.

So I totally cheated on this - I have a full time job with extensive travel and no time to bake.

I took the jist of the recipe and suggestions, came up with: 

1-22oz container of pre-made Chocolate Pudding (I used "Missys" brand)
1-container of French Vanilla Cool whip
1 pkg of Hersheys Raspberry creme filled baking chips
1 pkg fresh raspberries
1 9x9 pan of brownies from the bakery section of the supermarket

Prep: 
-Thaw cool whip
-divide brownies in 1/2 and break into pieces
-Divide the cool whip in 1/2, Fold 1/2 the cool whip to the full container of pudding in a bowl.

Then assemble:

Line bottom of a nice crystal bowl with 1/2 brownie pieces

Put the topping/pudding mixture on top of brownie layer 

Top that layer with 2/3 the raspberries and 2/3 of the raspberry hershey chips.

Place the remaining crumbled 1/2 of brownies on that layer

Place the remaining cool whip on that layer and garnish with remaining chips and raspberries.

Cover and fridge overnight.

Then step back and accept gracious compliments. I also suggest you lie and say you made it from scratch, cuz it sure tastes like you did.  The pudding tastes like chocolate mousse and the fresh raspberries and the raspberry filled chips add contrast and texture.

I tried it first with toffee bits and caramel sauce and whipped the heavy cream, but the whipped cream didnt matter since the quality of the prepackaged pudding I used is much better than instant and quite frankly, it was a little too cream rich for my s

This is really good. I sometimes omit the brownies and have used oreo's, chocolate wafer cookies, etc. And it is just as good. I have also used just strawberries or raspberries in place of the brownies. You can add, omit and play around with this recipe and every time it tastes like a million bucks! It's also really easy too and everyone thinks you went to a lot of trouble.

I made this to take to a Super Bowl party and it was half eaten within 15 minutes of being made!  There were 10 people there, multiple desserts and we came home with a tiny bit left.  Everyone seemed to like it, but I was a little disappointed.  The changes I made were to add 4 ounces cream cheese to the chocolate layer and use an 8 ounce container of Cool Whip instead of 12 ounce.  It turned out SO sweet though and even after the leftovers sat in the fridge for a day, the chocolate pudding and Cool Whip layers are difficult to tell apart.  While a lot of people liked it a lot, next time I'm going to make something different.

I made the chocolate pudding from scratch since i don't like packaged mixes. Also layered a couple of ripe bananas i had on hand. Very rich and filling!

Yumm!  I used chocolate cool whip in the pudding mixture which made it richer and fr. vanilla cool whip for the rest.  Everyone loved it and it only took about 10 minutes to assemble.

Added the french vanilla to the whipping cream, carmel and toffee bits as suggested by other readers.  This was really good but it was almost too rich (if that is possible). I'd like to lighten up the whipping cream and pudding layer next  time.

This recipe is so YUMMY!!!! I did make a few changes this time around.....I used the store bought 2 bite brownies instead of making my own.I also sliced up some fresh strawberries,sprinkled them with sugar and let them sit to bring out their juices and then layered them in the trifle as well.Also instead of using the condensed milk I mixed the chocolate pudding with some of the whipped topping .Oh so Yummy!!!! Enjoy!!!!!

WOW!!!  I made this for the family for Christmas and it was one of about 15 desserts - this is the one they all went for seconds!!  After reading the reviews, I did a little tweaking and added caramel and heath bits.  Very easy to make and the presentation makes it look like you spent all day on it......Will be making again!!!!

This is an awesome dessert; although I have to say that it was a little bit too sweet for my taste.  I opted for the whipping cream w/3 Tbs sugar as one reviewer suggested.  Next time I think I'll omit the sugar altogether and cut back on the sweetened condensed milk by about 1/4 cup.  Definitely recommend and it was so easy to make, not to mention you can make ahead of time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this last Thanksgiving and it was a big hit! Some people complained about it being too sweet, but I thought it was perfect! It is also very easy to make. I had 5 dishes to make that Thanksgiving and this one was by far the easiest and most delicious. This chocolate trifle tastes so good it should be a sin!

This was awesome, but very rich! I used whipping cream to mix with the pudding, and also used a container of french vanilla cool whip for layering.Also, I crushed up Heath toffee bars and added that to the mix. Next time, I think I will try it with peanut butter cups!

I used Kozy Shack chocolate pudding, negating the need for the condensed milk, some of the whipped topping and the pudding mix. An easy shortcut that helped cut the sweetness a tad. Also added strawberries and topped with Andes mint pieces.

everyone thought this was really good - the one drawback is that you can only eat so much of it. i followed some of the suggestions - i added bailey's cream and used real cream instead of cool whip. if i had used the cool whip maybe it wouldnt have been as rich as it was. however, if you are a chocoholic, this recipe is for you.

This trifle was my first such endeavor.  It was absolutely delicious.  I did add some caramel sauce over the brownie layer.  I will probably continue to explore different variations, although this recipe was great just the way it is!

This dessert is a favorite of my family and friends.  Based on other reviewers, I have made a couple of alterations to the recipe.  First, I use triple chunk brownies and drizzle about 1/2 bottle of caramel ice cream topping on the batter before baking.  Second, I use mini chocolate chips and sliced strawberries between layers and on top for decoration.

I love this and have made it three times with rave reviews every time.  I took another reviewer's advice and changed one cup of the Cool Whip to whipped cream and used a Triple Chunk Brownie Mix by Betty Crocker.

I'm not a big fan of chocolate like my husband and daughter are but I made this for them for Christmas dessert.  IT WAS WONDERFUL!!!! Like others suggested, I used whipping cream with 3Tbls sugar instead of frozen whip cream.  I also used brownies with walnuts. I can't wait to take it to the office and share with co-workers.  Thanks for sharing. Will make again and again.  Susan H.

Ok, so its Christmas Day and I am exhausted.  I needed to make yet another dessert for a gathering tomorrow.  You can't go wrong with leftover pound cake & brownies.  I diced up both, layered it with chocolate pudding, cool whip and chopped up Reese's PB cups.  I ended up calling it my "I Can't Possibly Bake Another Thing Trifle".  Thanks for the idea.

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly and it was good but a not as light. I made a modified version for a Christmas Eve party and it was a hit. For the pudding layer I skipped the condensed sweetened milk and instead combined the pudding mix with about 1 1/2 cups of milk then let it thicken in the fridge. I whipped 8 oz of heavy cream and folded it into the pudding. I substituted cream whipped with about a tablespoon of sugar for the cool whip layer. In the middle of the layers I drizzled about 1/4 cup of caramel sauce. For the top I used a chopped Heath bar instead of shaved chocolate. Yummy!

I took other reviewers' advise and modified the original recipe, using vanilla flavored cool whip, chocolate chunk brownies, and whipping up heavy whipping cream instead of cool whip to lessen the sweetness.  What a disappointment - it wasn't nearly as good as what people said.  WAY too sweet.  The brownies were hard, I think if I were to make it again, I would use regular brownies instead of the chocolate chunk ones, the chocolate pieces were rock hard.  Maybe my mistake was modifing the original recipe, I may try again, this time following the recipe to a tee.  There are far better desserts out there.

I'm not the best cook, as my name implies, but this trifle was SUPER easy and SO good, everyone wanted the recipe.  It also makes a nice presentation.  Since I brought it for a holiday party, I added currants on top with the chocolate curls.  You could vary this recipe in many ways, but this basic recipe is FAB!  PS-Do use real whipping cream, it makes a difference.

I made this recipe with some of the suggestions of other reviewers included.  I used the 12 oz french vanilla coolwhip in place of the regular coolwhip, and I whipped 1 cup of heavy cream in place of the 8 oz. cool whip.  It was very good, but very, very, very sweet.  Although I refrigerated for 8 hrs before serving, the brownies were still chewy.  The following day they had softed up more and the flavors had blended better.  Next time I will make a day ahead of time and will substitute softer chocolate cake for the chewy brownie texture.

It tastes just as good as it looks.  Very Easy & Yummy.  My 10 year old daughter & I made it for my daughter's softball christmas party potluck and it was one of the first desserts to go.  A keeper.

Great dish, pretty simple to put together, and it just looks great in a glass bowl with all the layers. Warning do not feed this to your kids in big servings, this desert is so sweet that it turns kinds into little hyper sugar monsters lol !

I made this desert for the first time a couple weeks ago for the office, everyone just loved it. I got compliments on how wonderful it was and also how beautiful it looked. And of course I was asked for the recipe.
I made it just as directed with the exception of adding strawberries between the 2 brownie layers.
I am making it again as we speak for a birthday at the office.
Very easy too make, I highly recommend it!

Made this for a dinner party and followed the recipe exactly.  For chocolate lovers this is absolutely perfect.  If you use cool whip it does keep that flavor.  I think I'll try the fresh cream next time because I enjoy that more.  But it definately is a keeper!

Very easy to make.  The first time I made it, I had only bought 2 8-oz tubs of Cool Whip (didn't read the recipe throughly enough), but it still worked out.  Everyone loved it, and I have made it a few more times since.

I gave this recipe 4 stars b/c of the ease in preparation. I thought the chocolate pudding mixture was a bit too sweet though. I would follow the suggestion of another reviewer and add more whipped topping to the pudding to tame down the sweetness.

I slightly modified the recipe by adding mini chocolate chips to the pudding for some different texture and a layer of bananas.  Both were great additions, along with chocolate syrup drizzled over the banana layer.  I also served in 8 mini trifle bowls which worked out really nice as I was able to use the desert for 2 different occasions that week.  Great recipe by itself or modified.

This was absloutely awesome!!  I made a few changes- I used chocolate pudding with carmel bits, and got half way through preparing the pudding the way it says on the box before I realized I was not supposed to do that!! :-)  It was completely fine, though, I just folded in the whipped cream and it turned out amazing!  Everyone at my party loved it.

Thanks for sharing!

WOW! This was amazing. This was the first trifle that I had made so I was a little nervous. It was soooo easy. I made the brownies the day before to cut down on the prep time. I also undercooked them by about 2 minutes so that they were really fudgy. I made this for a family function and can't even tell you how many compliments that I got. There was hardly any left, but it was even better the next day!

Thank you for the recipe! Everyone at my party thought it looked beautiful and tasted great! I followed the recipe exactly and added strawberries as decoration. Maybe next time instead of baking brownies I will subsitute it was two-bite brownies. What a party hit!

This trifle was so good.  My husband craves it all the time now.  I did what alot of other people suggested and whipped the pudding mix with heavy cream.  I tried it once with the extra chocolate chips for crunch but that just made it way too sweet.  I use 2 packages of strwberries and the Heath bits.  This trifle is absolutly to die for.

Made this for a church dinner last night.  Everyone LOVED it.  I made the variations as others suggested; home made whip cream, 3 chopped heath bars & carmel sauce for each layer.  No leftovers & everyone asked for the recipe.

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly, but it was WAY to sweet for us (though all of the kids gobbled it right up!).  So the next time I made it I cut out the sweetened condensed milk and used milk with a little bit of coffee added which cut the sweetness right down.  I also added coffee to my brownie mix (I was always told that it brings out the chocolate flavor, can't guarantee it but I listen to my mother's advice about cooking).  This also gives a great presentation on the desert table.  Thanks for the recipe, we'll be keeping this one!

This is sooo good, and easy to make! I left out the sweetened con. milk and just made the pudding as directed on the box... it was definitely sweet enough! It's a versatile recipe too... I've added strawberries... toffee, try anything that sounds good!!!

I love this recipe!!! It flew off the bowl when I made it. Although, I did use whipping cream for the pudding layer as people suggested and I didnt use the condensed milk as I thought it would be too sweet for the family...turned out fabulous !

Loved it.  Almost completely gone.  If you're like me and you read 'refrigerate 8 hours) about 3 hours before your event, I refrigerated the pudding mix alone and it came out perfect...no worries.

This dessert is great!  I made it for a wedding shower and it went fast.  I also received requests for the recipe.  I did cut out some of the condensed milk and increased the regular milk in the pudding.  I also added toffee chips on top of the pudding layers and to the top of the dish.  
I chose a brownie mix that came with a pouch of chocolate syrup, which made the brownie moister.

This was delicious but I did add the toffee bits, caramel sauce, and nuts. Took it to work and every last bite was gone. I prefer cooked pudding to the instant but when mixed with cool whip, it's hard to tell the difference.

Excellent! Very simple and quick. I saved time on a hot day with store-bought brownies and it was still great. After settling in the fridge, it becomes very rich and goes great with coffee.
I'd make this again in a heartbeat. :)

I loved this recipe, and so did my DH and 4 children.  I made fudge brownies from scratch, and used cheesecake pudding.  I also added cherry pie filling on top of the pudding layers and on top.  MMMmmmm!

I made this for a potluck my husband and I attended last night, and it was a huge hit.  I didn't have time to bake brownies (nor did I want to turn on the oven in this heat) so I bought a chocolate loaf from the bakery.  I only wish I would have had more time to let it sit and get 'gooey' :).  I threw in some raspberries for contrasting flavor, and it was great.

This was great, I used dark choclate pudding. I used brownie bites and rizzled with carmel, then added pudding, I then topped with chopped strawberries and bananas and then whip cream. On the very top I added more strawberries and the grated chocolate.

I made this last night. i did the heavy whipping cream thing in with the pudding instead of the whip topping, as per suggestions here. I also made double choc chip cookies and crumbled them up with the brownie layers. The cookies are my favourite part because it's something to chew on. It definitely works with it. 
Very indulgent dessert.

I took this to a Memorial Day Picnic/Family Reunion and everyone LOVED it! So easy! I followed the recipe and didn't make any changes. I will make this again and try it with some reviewers suggestions with adding caramel.

I made this for my son's birthday party last week and it was a hit.  I was already requested to make it for the cookout this week.  I also added the heavy whipping cream to the chocolate pudding layer instead of the Cool Whip.

This recipe was amazing. I made it for my mother's birthday and it was a hit! The pudding/sweetened condensed milk mixture is soooo delicious. Instead of using a boxed brownie mix, I homemade them. I will definately make this again.

If you want to save time try substituting the ready made frozen chocolate cakes (like McCain's)in place of the brownies. I buy 2 and scrape the icing off, then cut into cubes.  Of course not as good as the original but an acceptable substitute when you're in a hurry!

I don't really like chocolate so this wasn't my favorite (though it was very good as far as chocolate deserts go) but everyone else loved it!! Of the 3 different trifles we made this one was gone first.

Holy Cow this is a chocolate lovers dream!  If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars I would!  This dessert is so easy to make and everyone loves it!  I had people asking me for the recipe!  Caution...you will need a tall glass of milk as this is super rich!

This is also a party favorite with our friends.  I add raspberries to my layers of brownie, pudding & cool whip and decorate the top with a few raspberries.  It's the first thing to run out at each gathering!  :)

This is super sweet but usually a big hit. A nice addition is alternating oreo cookies with the brownies in layers. They get very soft over time, and it is delicious.

this is a delious and easy dessert that my family and friends enjoy.  all you have to do is make sure you give yourself enough time to allow it to refigerate before serving.  in a pinch, i've served it after only refigerating a few hours and it was still very very good!

This is too sweet, even for a college chocoholic. it also started to get syrupy  in the fridge. im trying to freeze it now,see if that helps it. if i did make this next time, i would cut back on the evaporated milk. still tasty though!

How can this NOT be good?! With a Betty Crocker classic brownie mix, this is simple and quick. Allow time for cooling, however. We used regular whipped cream with sugar and vanilla due to the NASTY ingredients in "frozen whipped topping"--read the label! It is a rich dessert. Hubby felt it was a bit over the top--definitely not a refreshing dessert, but rather indulging! Yum!

I also layered Health bar bits and sugar free cherry pie filling when I made the dessert. I used sugar-free or low fat everything, and it turned out great. The chocolate mouse layer made with the sweetened condensed milk was a bit too sweet for me, so I would probably use less and make up the difference with regular milk. I'll definitely make this again. Good for large groups, it makes a lot!

I made this for New Year's Eve and it was a huge hit.  It is a delicious trifle that gets better as the flavors mature.  I substituted coffee for the water in the brownie mix and used real whipped cream.  I "eyeballed" how much whipped cream I put in the layers and ended up using a little too much whipped cream.  Other than that, it was delicious and everyone loved it.

This was a good recipe!  I made some major changes to make it a Banana Turtle Trifle for my husband for Valentines day.  I used half banana and half chocolate pudding mix.  I left out the chocolate bar for topping and put some chocolate chunks in the brownie mix instead.  When I layered it I added toasted pecans, caramel sauce, and bananas. My husband loved it!!  I was able to use all sugar free items as well!

On of our favorites.  I generally do not like desserts with frozen whipped topping (Cool Whip) in them.  They seem too commercial, but this one is wonderful.

I seem to be the only one in my family that doesn't care for this. Way too rich for my liking but it was devoured by everyone  else.

Oh my God!! This is always a crowd pleaser and the perfect finish at any party. I really enjoy making it and the shaved chocolate on top gives it a professional look. You won't be disappointed.

I took this to work for my "treat day".  It went so fast, I didn't even have a chance to save some for my husband.  This was very easy and wonderful "as is".  If only I could give it six stars instead of five!

This was great, super easy and tasted wonderful...and it looks pretty too.  I bought some milk chocolate chip chunks and scattered them over the top.  I also used a little less than the whole can of condensed milk per the advice of other users.

I made this today for a party.  Everyone loved it and told me at our next church dinner to make sure that i brought this..

Update: a long time after making my first one, I constantly get requests for this dessert.  It's easy, and very popular.

Wow!  I made this up for Thanksgiving, and once I set it on the table, people started eyeing it.  It was the first desert to get dug into, and everyone really liked it.  Unfortunately, it was very, very rich, and I quickly found out that I couldn't eat very much of it without getting sick!  It's good and I'll make it again, but I'll be sure to watch how much I'm eating.

Thank you for sharing this great recipe!  This was the hit of the family pot luck.  It was so easy and fast.  I didn't have the time to bake the brownies, so I bought the brownie bites from Albertson's.  Delicious!

Made this for a office birthday party a couple months ago, everyone gave complimetns.  They still request encores.  This is easy to make and delicious to eat.  Also, it makes a great presentation in a triple of inverted glass cake dish.

This one is a keeper!  I followed the recipe exactly and took it to a church dinner.  The trifle dish wash scraped clean!  I took it to a dinner at my kids' school the next week and came home with another empty bowl.  I plan to make it again for a party.  This rich dessert is super easy to prepare and looks very impressive in a trifle bowl.  I couldn't get the chocolate curls to look as nice as I wanted.  I may try chocolate sprinkles or mini chocolate trips if I'm in a rush.  I definitely recommend this on for potlucks!

Very good recipe.  Makes quite alot, maybe next time I will cut the recipe in half and try to lighten it up because it's very heavy.

Oh my gosh this was SO GOOD!  I made it for a progressive dinner, and after debating over many recipes for trifles, I decided on this one.  I had never made a trifle before, and it was so beautiful and easy!  Everyone raved about it and wants the recipe!!  The chocolate mixture turns into a mousse, and its so light and delicious.  I was very impressed, thanks for a great recipe!  I'm sure I will use it again!

Very good and  easy to make. My  13  yr  old daughter, Brittany made this dessert  for  a dinner we had and she  didnt layer  it , as she  is  new  to cooking,  it  was very sweet, but  still really  good. I think it  would have been less sweet if  she had layered it  properley :)

I made this EXACTLY as the recipe stated and it was fabulous.  I'm sure that the addition of Heath bits and caramel would be great.  But, I made it as stated and it was wonderful.  I let it sit in the fridge for about 5 hours and it was really good.

I had made something very similar to this before without the sweetened condensed milk, but I believe I like this recipe better.  It was not too sweet to me at all, as some reviewers thought it was too sweet so I was a little skeptical...it was very yummy!  I did add some bits of brickle on top of the pudding layer for some crunch and used 4 cups whipping cream whipped with 1 cup powdered sugar in place of the cool whip.  I would definitely make again!

I made this for a Church Function- EVERYBODY loved it! Big Hit!!!!! So easy to make! I did however bake the brownies too long, but it still worked! Instead of using shaved chocolate on top, I crumbled a toffee bar and mixed in a couple of pieces between layers and on the top. Looks great in the trifle dish..This is one of my favorite recipes, will definetly keep this one!

Great dessert!  Very rich, so small portions go along way.  I added Skor candy bar broken into pieces.  I also used cheesecake pudding inplace of the chocolate.  My family thought that I should cut back on the whipping cream and double the brownies. Thanks!

This was the best recipe!  It tasted like you spent hours in the kitchen but it really didn't take long at all.  I took it to a church dinner.  Someone had taken a spoon and gotten EVERY drop off of the sides of the trifle bowl!  Thanks for such a great recipe.

I have made this recipe a couple of times now and there is never any left. I made it for Christmas, everyone was supposed to bring a new dessert, this was mine.  My family was very impressed.  The recipe is so easy also.  I used French vanilla cool whip instead of regular. YUM!

Very sweet! We needed lots of good strong black coffee! I made this recipe again with chocolate pound cake instead of brownies and lightly sweetened whipped cream instead of whipped topping. Much less sweet and a different texture. My family likes both!

Wow!!! What a fantastic recipe!!!  I made this for a Christmas party and this got eaten before all the other desserts were practically touched.
The only things I did differently were I used a 1/2 pint of whipping cream in place of the cool whip in the chocolate layer.  I also added strawberries and crushed Skore bars between the cool whip layers.  It was not too sweet at all.  SOOOO GOOD.  I have been requested to make this every year from now on.

This is sinfully delicious!  Only change made was a special request by my husband that I put some toffee pieces in it.  So I put some on top of the whip cream layer in the center and on top.  Brought this to a family dinner and my brother's jaw dropped and the kids were squealing with delight.  Easy to make and heavenly to eat!

A delicious, easy dessert!  Great when you have a big croud to make for.  We love toffee chocolate bars broken up on top!

I have served this for company several times and everyone has LOVED it. It is easy, but impressive looking. Nice to have a dessert dish that is not only delicious and easy but can be made ahead. This takes such a load off when you are preparing a large meal. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is the best! I serve it at get togethers and church gatherings. It is quickly gone, and I should probably make two it's so easy to make. I have even gotten around the having to make it the night before. If it's a little soft, no one seems to mind!!

I have made this dessert for two get togethers this summer and it was a hit both times. Didn't get to bring any home with me! Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. It's so easy to make! Wouldn't change a thing. Quick, easy, and delicious!

This was a HUGE hit at the Teacher's back to school luncheon for my son's school.  I have to make another one because so many of them didn't get any!  It is already rich, but I added Heath bits on top of the chocolate layer and diced almonds on top of the whipped cream.  I topped it with a few of each.  I can't wait to make this again!

Follow CHRISTINAI's suggestion!  I did, and this is the most popular recipe I've ever made!!!  Make sure you add strawberries; it is a little too sweet without them.

This is a great recipe for a chocolate trifle.  I used my homemade whipped cream instead of cool whip.  I took it to a family gathering, and everyone loved it.

Fabulous recipe!  I very rarely give 5 stars but this recipe deserves it.  I did NOT think that it was too sweet at all as some others said.  I did, however, use whipping cream instead of already made frozen whipped cream.  I will make this again and again.

Very, very good!  I just took this to a church get together, and it was a hit!  Everyone loved it!  I followed the recipe exactly, the only change I made was I added crushed Heath bars on top instead of the shaved chocolate (I was afraid I would mess that up).  I will definately be making this again!

Too rich? Serve it over ice cream to cut the richness? Don't quite get that. Anyway Wayne, the delicious RICH ingredients speak for themselves, which is exactly why most of us decided to make this delicious and wonderful dessert to begin with! Loved by all, including this rare sweet eater!

This turned out looking as good as the picture.
I did follow some other suggestions like making my own whipped cream so it wasn't as sweet. It is very sweet and best served to a large group of people since small servings are best. I was very impressed and loved the different options it opened up. I did layer and top the trifle with crushed chocolate toffee pieces as well. It tasted as good 2 days later. LOVED IT!!!!!

I have made this twice.  Both times I ran out of the whipped topping so I suggest making at least another 80z more whipped topping.  The other layers are enough to make a good 3 layers.  This is a chocolate lovers dream dessert and so easy to make.  I usually top with sliced almonds or nut topping in addition to the shaved chocolate.

Brought this to a church luncheon and it was a big hit.  Very rich so most people took small portions.   I used crushed heath bar between layers and also made three layers instead of two.

This was just okay.  It tasted like the different parts just stacked together... I didn't really feel like the layers particularly added anything to each other.  It was beautiful, though.  I did serve it at a dinner party, and we were all so excited because it was so pretty, but then it kind of disappointed.  Maybe our expectations were too high, but we did not have the out-of-the-ball park experience that other reviewers experienced.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone raved about it.  I liked it, but I think it would have been better with a homemade whipped topping.  Otherwise, great for the chocolate lovers.

The only thing I found disappointing about this,was that I did not get to bring any home with me when I took it to a dinner. It is very easy and delicious. It is a definite keeper!!!

I made this for T-giving and it was a HUGE hit.  I had actually made it once before for my boyfriend and I but this time it was so much fun to get all the 'mmmmmm's from a larger crowd!  So simple but sooooo delicious!

Was pretty easy.  It tasted really good initially, but after a couple spoonfuls it started feeling too rich.  I am gonna make it less creamy next time.

Just took this dessert to a party and everyone raved about it.  I loved being able to make it the night before.  I, too, added the strawberries for extra color and flavor - it was a hit!

My daughter had this cake last summer.  She decided it is what she wanted for her birthday.  So in the net I went and found this recipe.  The only difference she wanted was a layer  strawberries which I bought pie/topping in a can and added over the cool whip.. Sure made it tasty and pretty.  Everyone just raved over it.

This trifle is wonderful.  I vary the recipe a bit by adding layers of crushed Heath bars.  I have been asked for the recipe everytime I take it anywhere. Juanita Barber

This is a FANTASTIC dessert!  I made it for a 4th of July gathering, along with 3 other desserts.  This was the first (and only) to go!  Everyone wanted the recipe.  Definitely include the chocolate shavings!  Makes it pretty!

WOW! Great taste and look.  Definitly a must for special occasions.  Very rich.  The best part is how easy and relatively inexpensive it is to make this impressive dessert.  The candy shavings on top is a great added touch.

This was an excellent dessert.  Strawberries were added between the layers, which went well with the chocolate.  This is nice to serve for dinner guests.
