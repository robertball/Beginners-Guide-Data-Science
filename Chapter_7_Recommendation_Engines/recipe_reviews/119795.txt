WOW this stuff is AWESOME! My family requests it for every gathering. We like ours a little more robust. I up it to  1/4 cup rice vinegar; 1 1/2 cups mayo and add a dash of season salt. I swear I could eat this stuff for breakfast lunch and dinner. Oh, wait, I HAVE!!

Wow, we really liked this macaroni salad!  I followed the recipe as good as I could, but since I didn't have any green onions, I added about 2 tablespoons of dried chives.  I also didn't have enough mayo so I used Miracle Whip!  It was delicious!!!  Thanks, this is a keeper!

Very easy to make. I did end up adding a half package of coleslaw mix and used half light mayo, half ff sour cream. I also used a tri-color rotini, because that was all I had. Came together in a hot minute and it was great for such a hot day. Next time, I might add a few spices.

This is the first time I have ever made macaroni salad and it turned out wonderful!  I brought this to a bbq and it was gone within 5 minutes.  I think it is a wonderful twist to traditional macaroni salad and I will make it again and again!!!

This was sooo good! A real crowd pleaser, gone before I could get a scoop of the salad. They were begging for the recipe. This is a definite keeper in my recipe box.

This is one of the best macaroni salads I have ever eaten!  I really enjoyed the mix of the bacon and tomatoes.  I did however add 3 hard boiled eggs, chopped, because I couldn't imagine macaroni salad without them.  But then that's just me.  I also added an additional 1/2 cup mayo.    I will say it didn't last 24 hours.  My whole family raved about it.  We will be having this many times this summer.  Thanks Norene for a great tasting twist on the usual macaroni salad.

Very refreshing.  I waited til serving to put in the bacon, so it stayed crispy longer.  I also put cherry tomatoes and halved them, it was great!

This is the best recipe I have tried in a long time. I didn't end up using the full 16oz of bacon. I cooked it all and just stirred in what I thought looked right. It was probably 12oz instead. My hubbie loved it!

This salad is amazing!! I made it for the first time about 3 weeks ago and I have made it 5x since then.  Everytime I make it, I get recipe requests.  I use the grape tomatoes sliced in half or quartered.  But other than that stick to the recipe word for word!

Took it for a potluck today and it was an ABSOLUTE HIT! I added more bacon since everything is better with bacon. It was devoured quickly and is now my new summer salad favorite!

This was okay but not worth 5 stars by any means.  It really soaks up the mayo mixture. If I make this again I will add more of the mayo and omit the celery. I could taste the celery and there is no celery in BLT's. I may try this once more but this time I made it exactly as the recipe says and it was just o.k.

Supreme!  Served to 6th graders as part of their in-school Thanksgiving dinner and they loved it.  One girl asked if my granddaughter would make it for her upcoming b'day party! I doubled the recipe, used about 10 halved cherry tomatoes and cut back a little on the onion in consideration for some kids not liking it.  I especially liked this since it contained no eggs or nuts (food allergies).  I followed AllRecipe's hints for cooking pasta and had no soggy or dry pasta.  Can't wait to make for my family, now.

This was a really great recipe.  I made it exactly as called for, except used penne pasta (it's what I had on hand).  In the future, I'd use macaroni as called for and less celery, for personal preference.  I'd definitely give this one a try, if I were you.  Its easy and worth it!

Great!!! I read a lot of reviews and I reduced the sugar and vinegar and I thought it was just great.  I do agree with lots of other members that you should make extra mayo mixture because it absorbs after sitting for a while.  overall a great great recipe!!!!

I think you should change the name to BLT Pasta Salad, cause it seems there's a big hangup on this being a "macaroni salad," right down to having to add boiled eggs.  I saw it as more of a bacon-pasta salad, and not at all a "macaroni salad."  That bacon makes a HUGE difference.  And I never even put lettuce on my BLT sandwiches, so certainly didn't miss it here -- I thought the celery sub was fine.  I halved grape tomatoes (chopping regular tomatoes is just wet and sloppy).  I also used Miracle Whip, but since I grew up in a house that used it for "mayo," I think of it as mayo and always use it.  (And don't care for real mayo.)  It didn't make it too tangy for me cause that's what I'm used to doing.  But otherwise made as is.  This was good and certainly was enjoyable - could've used MORE bacon.  LOL.  But I'm a bacon freak, which is why I try to avoid buying it very often or I'll eat it. :-)  I couldn't decide between 4 and 5 stars, but since I hate chopping, and that plus cooking two individual things adds to my "hassle factor" so I chose the 4.  Despite liking it, it's not something I'd make often.   And I really have to disagree w/someone who said the onion is over-powering.  Green onion is fairly mild and I hardly noticed it.  Unless of course you hate green onion...

Very good. I used a whole box of penne pasta since I was feeding a crowd but I didnt up the bacon I used a package which isnt quite a pound anymore. I omitted the celery I didnt have it and I cant eat it at the moment. Everyone really liked this.

YUMMY!!  I prepared the salad, minus tomato, and let it set in the fridge overnight. I added the tomatoes and bacon an hour before serving.  I will definitely be making this again.  P.S.  I think it would taste just as good without the bacon.

Good but a little bland for my taste. I think with a little spice (some Creole seasoning maybe) and subbing out some of the mayo for sour cream it could give it more pop. Will try next time

This was so good.  I made it just as it says.  I took this to a luncheon and I had 3 people email me the same day asking for the recipe.  There was nothing left in the bowl.

so very good.  Always add plenty of celery, the crispness is a must.

Left out the onions (allergies), but followed the rest.  I had to add extra mayo (did 1.5 cups then extra later) as the pasta soaks it up in the fridge. Everyone loved it and will definitely make again!

Made this for Memorial Day to go with ribs.  It was EXCELLENT!  Best macaroni salad I have ever eaten.  Adhered to the recipe except didn't put in near the amount of bacon, maybe ten slices.  That was plenty. My husband doesn't particularly like macaroni salad but he loved this!

Made this salad following directions exaclty.  I thought it was a little bland.  I would add more spices if I were to make it again.

No offense to Betty Crocker but I will never buy a box of ranch bacon salad again, this totally replaces it! A few family members don't like celery so I added 1/2 tsp of celery seed.  I refrigerated it for about 4 or 5 hrs before serving.  This definitely allowed the flavors to blend and the mixture to thicken.  I cannot repeat how my husband felt about this, not quite PG, what I can say is he requested it "all the time"!  A winner, thank you!

I made this for my twins baptism.  To make it look fancy, I lined the bowl with romaine lettuce leaves like in the picture and rather than mixing the tomatoes in, I just garnished with sliced tomatoes on top (to make it more kid-friendly).  I didn't have any leftovers.  The only thing I would say is that it is worth using real bacon for - I used bacon pieces and they were kind of hard and chewy rather than crumbly like real bacon (although my guests didn't seem to mind).

We really liked this salad! The celery becomes the "L" in the BLT-very good! I made the night before. My only complaint would be that the vinegar lost it's umph after sitting overnight so I added more before serving. I also added the tomatoes just before serving so they didn't get mushy. I'll definately make this one again!!

This was good but really just tasted like regular macaroni salad with bacon and tomatoes and I guess I was expecting more.  But it was eaten and it was good so you can't ask for much more than that.

I thought this salad was very good. My husband loves macaroni salad so I made this for him and I ended up eating most of it. The bacon, celery and tomato compliment each other nicely. I left out the onion since I'm not a big raw onion fan but I added onion powder and chili powder for a little kick. I also left out the vinegar (I forgot to pick it up at the store) and it was still good. I will be making this recipe again!

My boyfriend's father HATES pasta but insisted that this recipe was a "keeper".  I followed the recipe exactly but I think next time I may add a little extra mayo before serving as the pasta absorbed a lot in the refrigerator.

I love the simplicity of this recipe, but found it to be a little TOO creamy. I made it as is the first time, but the next time I put 1/4 cup less mayo and 1 tsp less vinegar. I also put in a bag of chopped romaine because a BLT salad should have lettuce.

One word....PERFECT! Fresh, flavorful, just the right consistency...I've made my own versions of macaroni salad for years and they don't even compare to this recipe!  Changes? Didn't use a full pound of bacon-a little over a half pound. We need to cut the salt content in our diets-I made the eggs the day before to cut down on the prep time, and I used 3/4 cup lite Miracle Whip and 3/4 cup regular Miracle Whip. Made this on Sunday for a Memorial Day get together and every person that ate it complimented me on it! This recipe will be passed on for years to come!  Thank you !!

I am not used to eating macaroni salad, but wanted something different. By the time it was over, I had left out the celery (used celery seed instead), halved the green onion (still too much) and doubled the tomato.  It was good, mainly due to the bacon, but needed a good bit of salt.

great recipe. I did not change a thing except did not add onions. I loved it but my family said "leave out the celery next time blts don't have celery".  Not going to take their advice.

This was a very easy and tasty salad to make. I do believe the key to it is to let it sit for a couple of hours before eating tho. I tasted it right after mixing and it was really plain. After a few hours, when served at a party, it was a big hit with everyone, including myself. I substitued miracle whip for some of the mayo just for a little more tang, and split some cherry tomatoes in half. It turned out quite pretty as well.

First time i made a macaroni salad and it turned out fantastic! I didn't use quite as much bacon and still thought it was a bit too much though ( i think i used half a package) but it was great. Everyone loved it...my mom said my grandmother would have been proud! haha loved it will make it again & again!

Like most cooking recipes, I just used this as a guideline and adjusted it to my tastes and ingredients on hand.  Thus said, I omitted the onions, subsituted green pepper for the celery, and used rotini.  I greatly reduced the amount of bacon used as well as the dressing ingredients.  And it turned out delicious.

Too tangy. I guess I shouldn't have used Miracle Whip b/c there may be a big difference in the flavor, had I followed the directions which stated to use Mayonaise, it MIGHT have tasted better.

This was good but our family did not eat it before it went bad. Definitely let it sit for a few hours before eating, it was not good at all before letting it sit.

I have made this several times it is soooo yummy. Thank you so much for the recipe. The only thing I do different than the recipe is not add as much vinegar maybe 3 instead of 5, other than that I follow the recipe exactly and it's wonderful.

I would give it five stars, but I didn't make the recipe quite as written. I added some diced chicken breast and substituted romaine lettuce for the celery- it came out fantastic!! Also found i didn't need to use so much vinegar since I use Miracle Whip in the first place. Amazing pasta salad recipe that is definitely going to be kept on hand.

This was very good but i think that it needs lettuce added for the "L".  I added some crunchy romaine to it and that made it a 5 star recipe. The dressing was very good and tasted amazing with the bacon. I used small seashell pasta (that is what i had on hand) and it worked out very well. I served it with Italian beef sandwiches and corn on the cob for labor day weekend.

This was so good, I literally JUST made it for a picnic in an hour.  I used plum tomatoes and put more in, maybe 4 or 5. We keep "testing" it, hope there's still some left for the picnic! What a great recipe!  Thank you!

Wow is this good - Now, STOP if you want something healthy...this is not it.  But for a special occasional treat, it is fantastic.  Perfect for a bbq or potluck.  It really does taste like a BLT & my husband, who loves BLT's but not macaroni salad, likes this...who wouldn't?

Great taste.  However for a macaroni salad it is quite expensive to make. I will make it again but only for a special
occasion.

**Omit the celery or reduce the amount greatly** Even when I was making this I kept thinking it doesn't smell right, celery and blts??  I would omit the celery and add crispy pieces of romaine lettuce instead.  Also don't substitute a sweet vinegar I used apple cider vinegar that was a no.  I didn't have white or rice.

Very good! Used bagged bacon bits but next time will try real bacon. We are also more of a Miracle Whip family than mayo so will probably try that next time as well.

We LOVED it.  Due to the tomato/salmonella scare I didn't use tomatoes.  However, I did use diced red bell pepper in it's place.  Very delicious!  Can't wait to use tomatoes another time.

I made this for a very large family gathering. I got so many raves from everybody! It was excellent! I doubled the recipe, but didn't use the amount of bacon it called for, it seemed like it would be too much. The flavors were wonderful.

Didn't think it was good at all.  I had to really increase the recipe due to large party, so I used your conversion chart.  I felt that I followed it to the letter, but still turned out too heavy and "greasy" (yes, bacon was drained by papertowel).  Also felt that it really didn't taste any different than "traditional" macaroni" salad.  Maybe something gets lost when the recipe is increased.
