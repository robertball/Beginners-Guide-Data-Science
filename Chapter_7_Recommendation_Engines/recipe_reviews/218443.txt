Got a few tips. 
Don't mix different greens; they have a variety of cooking times. 
Washing greens is VERY important. I soak for 1 hour in a large stockpot. I pull them from the water, (pour on your plants) and individually rinse each leaf in running water, placing each wet leaf on a large cutting board, facing the same way for easier cutting. In batches, I chop off the tip of the stem (hello, compost pile). Then I chop the stems all up in 1/4" slices and put in the cold skillet, reserving the leaf. 
I use my largest cast-iron skillet that has a tight fitting lid. Bacon fat is great, or olive oil, but my fave is my own homemade chicken broth. I add  1/2 cup in the bottom of the skillet to stems with 4-5 minced garlic cloves, cover and cook on  medium heat while I am chopping up the leaves. (This lets the tougher stems and garlic tenderize a bit and flavor the broth.)
I chop up all the wet leaves into bite-sized pieces, toss them in the skillet (be careful, it is hot!) and cover, cook on low heat and set the timer for 10 minutes (because you may need more broth). Depending on your burner, you may need to add more broth to this concoction to keep it moist every 10 minutes. I have eaten them after 10 minutes; I have also waited until the rest of dinner was ready, after an hour (better)! Just keep 'em wet. Serving time... drizzle on Bragg's Amino Acid to kick up a salty flavor, without adding sodium! For high blood pressure, it's the best salt substitute EVER!
Thanks rjkuns!

Delicious! I used Broccoli Rabe tossed into the pan with the bacon drippings, a pinch of salt and hot pepper flakes to taste. Simple and very tastey. The bacon drippings add a level of flavor and depth not  achieved by using oil. Very very good.

I consider myself to be an expert at cooking collard greens. I had heard about stir-frying or sautéing greens, so when I came across this recipe, it seemed like it might be worth a try. Well, I could not be more wrong. 
I did not use a mix of greens, just collard greens. I  had more than a "mess" of green, probably about 3 bunches and it took way too long to sauté them. I thought this would be a quick way to get delicious greens, but it was more work preparing greens this way than my normal way. After what seemed to be at least 45 min., maybe more, I sampled the greens. They were still tough and the stems did not cook down enough for me.  The taste was also very bland. 
I added some broth, water and additional season and boiled for at least another 45 min. Still did not like the greens. They were still tough, bland and the stems were not to my liking. I added more water and cooked for at least another hour. The same results. It does not seem as if the greens were any more tender than before I added the additional liquids. After the rave reviews, I am definitely disappointed and won't be making this dish again.

I started with two bunches of collard greens, rinsed them and removed the stems, and tore the greens into bite-sized pieces.  Next, I rendered a skillet full of sliced salt pork, pulled the semi-cooked pork out and used the renderings to wilt the greens.  I placed the rendered pork into a pot with 4 cups of water and brought it to a boil.  After the greens cooked down, I added them to the boiling water, covered and simmered on low heat for an hour.  I added no more salt and they were perfect!  If my southern-raised mother were still alive, she would be impressed!  This is easy and fantastic!

I loved it and I did not make any changes. I used the recipe for kale and collards and it worked well for both. It was easy, quick and delicious.

Thanks, RJ. I never thought to wilt them before and you are entirely correct that the bacon fat really complements the greens.My mustard greens were super-tender and not bitter at all. I used canola and about 5 strips of smoked bacon (not maple). I left about 2.5 strips in the pan for flavoring the liquor.
I went ahead with the broth approach and differed substantially enough to make a new recipe (Come check it out!) The green's liquor takes about 2 1/2 hours to really get good. On the other hand, more ready supplied liquor of the other type will allow you to bide your time waiting!

I made this with too much bacon, if there is such a thing.  Used high quality maple bacon which I think added a little. First time my non southern boyfriend has had collards, and it will def be a do again

I mix my greens, but I also start them cooking in my skillet at different times! I start off with the greens that take the longest to cook, so DON'T worry about mixing greens just use common sense and start with the greens that take the longest time to cook, adding each green one at a time depending on how long they need to cook!

Tried Collard Greens for the first time and this was fantastic!  Huge hit with all the adults at dinner (kids still aren't too sure about anything green!)  Added some minced garlic while cooking and then crumbled some bacon on top right before serving.

This is definitely the way to do it.  I followed the recipe exactly and made it with Collard Greens.  I was feeling my roots so I fixed it with corn casserole and pork chops.  My husband and I loved it and my two teenagers who aren't the best veggie eaters both gave it a thumbs up!  I was happy to get veggies in them even if I had to do it with bacon grease!!  And what doesn't taste good cooked in bacon grease, right?!

Nothing about this tasted good. The title is very misleading. It needs meat, more seasoning, one type of greens, and a longer cook time to be the "RIGHT WAY' to cook greens.

Thank you rjkuns for posting. There are sooo many recipes for greens with some requiring many ingredients and cooking time. We have brought it down to your simplicity level. BAM! 20 minutes we had perfect collards. Anybody could add anything to the pot, but this is just the base that showcases the ease of cooking greens!

Thanks for this recipe!  It was perfect!  My husband walked in with fresh turnip greens that the neighbor had given him, it was late and I needed a quick recipe. I fried some bacon in my black skillet, and after cutting the stems out of the greens and soaking them in salt water with a little white vinegar, I rinsed them and sautéed them in the black skillet with the bacon drippings. While they sautéed, I started boiling some water and tossed the pieces of bacon right in there to continue the flavor. As the greens wilted and turned a beautiful bright green I added them to the boiling water and continued adding greens until they were all wilted and in the boiling water. I poured the remaining bacon drippings from the skillet into the boiling greens and added some chicken broth and fresh ground black pepper. Put the lid on the pot of greens and let boil about 30 minutes - perfect!

Worked well with beet greens. I cut out the stems and tore the greens into slightly larger than postage stamps. Sautéed half an onion with it. Tasty

A great simple recipe, very good for when you don't feel like frying up bacon, but have that jar of bacon grease in the fridge :)  Flavorful, and I recommend serving it with a wedge of lemon, citrus makes it even more over the top!
