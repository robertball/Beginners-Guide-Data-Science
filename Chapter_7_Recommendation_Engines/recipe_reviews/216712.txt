Thanks for this recipe! I made a few modifications.   I substituted carrots for the celery, and added fresh spinach at the end for some extra nutrition and flavor. I also added smoky tempeh for enhanced protein, while still keeping it meatless. It was simple, delicious and fast to make. I'll definitely make this again!

This was a great soup. I didn't use canned beans, so that added quite a bit of time, but we just like dried beans better. When finished, I did blend part of the bean mixture to change the final texture, and I was very happy with that.

I omitted the oil, and used wild onions for garnish instead of using the regular onion. This has good taste.

I added maybe a table spoon of lime juice because I felt it couldn't hurt. Carrots would have been a nice idea too.

I'm not a Vegan, so I added ground turkey breast.  Good flavors, also used less liquid so it was a bit heartier an stew-like.

Absolutely awesome just the way it is. Kids really like this and the house smells wonderful after cooking. My son prefers to eat it cold the next day. Definitely a keeper!

This is thinner than I like a bean soup to be, but the flavor is excellent.
