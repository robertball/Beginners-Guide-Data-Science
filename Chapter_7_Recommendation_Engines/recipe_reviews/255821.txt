10.31.16  Used SilkÂ® Vanilla Almondmilk which I think elevated the flavor a bit.  The texture was just about perfect, firm but not dry, and the oatmeal itself is the star in this recipe.  The sweet potato not only enhances the texture, but it lends itself to a sweetness balance that is spot on.  Was good with a drizzle of maple syrup.

I made the recipe exactly as written, except didn't add nutmeg because I didn't have any. I baked it in an 11 x 8 inch rimmed cookie sheet sprayed with cooking spray for the full 30 minutes. It made 8 good sized portions. The texture was soft and firm. It's not overly sweet which was fine for me.  For those who like sweeter oatmeal, add additional sugar or drizzle maple syrup on top of individual portions. I think a splash of vanilla would enhance the flavor. The sweet potato flavor is subtle and a perfect compliment to the oatmeal. I plan to freeze individual potions and pop in the microwave for a quick breakfast. Next time I will substitute my "salted caramel" coffee creamer for part of the milk and chopped nuts for additional crunch.  Raisins or dried cranberries would also add a little more sweetness.

Great recipe. Only change I made was to substitute Almond Milk (original unsweetened) instead of dairy milk. Topped with toasted pecans and drizzled with maple syrup to serve.

We really liked this and will definitely be making again!  I substituted an equal amount of applesauce for the oil and as another reviewer suggested, added some vanilla.  

Definitely give this one a try!!

Friggin delicious! I did not add the salt, but it tasted great to me. Oats were a little hard, but it may be because I used steel oats. Will try adding more milk or changing the oats.
