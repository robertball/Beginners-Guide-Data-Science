Just like I remembered them!  Easier than I remembered also. Thanks!!!  A hint: before you spoon onto wax paper, let mixture cool for just a moment so it's easier to control size of cookie.

This must be one of the easiest cookies to make, and it has been a family favorite in both my husband and my families for years and years. A lot of people complain that the cookies don't always set up well, but I found if you follow the advice in this recipe about bringing it to slow boil and not boiling for more than 90 seconds, I get perfect results every time. I use creamy instead of crunchy peanut butter.

Excellent, but I was eating these non stop and felt I needed a lower in calories version. I have not added up the calories in this version, but I use a lot less butter, sugar, and peanut butter - so I assume it is lighter :-)  Less Sweet, Fewer Calories, BUT nearly as good version 1/2+ cup sugar 1/2 cup milk 1/8 cup butter  Bring to a boil and let boil for 1 1/2 minutes Remove from heat Stir in:  3 Tblsp cocoa >1/4 cup peanut butter 2 1/2 cup oats 1/2 tsp vanilla  drop on a cookie sheet and let cool

WAY too sweet, even after I added an extra 1/2 c. of oatmeal and reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups! I recommend using 1/2 the amount of sugar (1 c.) and upping the oatmeal by a 1/2 a cup. They were, however, very easy to make--a perfect dessert to make in the summer when it's too hot to turn on the oven. If I reduce the sugar next time, they'd easily get 5 stars.

WOW! What a blast from the past!! I've always loved these cookies, and now my children do also. Wish I would have had this recipe years ago. I microwaved my ingredients for 3 1/2 min.  stirred then microwaved for another 3 1/2 min. then added pb, oatmeal and vanilla. Texture of the cookies were perfect. Thanks for the recipe Sherrie!

WOW!!!  I made no bake cookies that turned out right!!  This has rarely happened in the past, LOL.  Actually, I made a batch from a recipe I had, and they wouldn't set, as usual.  I was determined to make some that would set.  I came to my favorite recipe site and found this one... perfection!!  I'm throwing all my other no bake recipes away!  Thanks to the original poster of this recipe!!!

I made a double batch with my toddler - ended up with about 95 cookies.  I ended up with cocoa and oats on my floor, but it was worth it!  The cookies are perfect, and we both had fun making them.

I've read all the no bake cookie recipes on this site and most of them are identical to the one I've had for almost 40 yrs.  The only difference is the time you should boil the butter, sugar, cocoa and milk.  I bring the cocoa mixture to a soft rolling boiling on medium high heat then I turn the heat down to medium and stir constantly for 2 minutes.  A nice twist is to add almond extract instead of vanilla.  For a glossy finish to the cookie only use real butter.  These are my husbands favorite cookies than I've made them probably a thousand times and they have always turned out.  I also use 5 T cocoa instead of the 3 or 4 the other recipes listed.

Oh my stars! This recipe is DEE-LISH! The crunchy peanut butter makes all the difference! I added a few extra crushed nuts to mine and it was very good...I have found that if I don't double the recipe, the batch turns out better..I'm not sure why but the cookies end up with a nice glossy finish this way! :)

Yum...this is a great, easy recipe.  I like mine a bit more chocolaty, so I add 1/4 C chocolate chips to the stove-top mixture.

I have made these for years. A tip for the people having problems with them setting right, I have found one method that makes them always turn out right. Bring to a boil, have a cold glass of water with you, after the time mentioned is up drop a tiny amount in it, if it "splatters" in the water it is not done cooking yet. I usually end up having to cook them for 5 minutes sometimes a tad longer before they are done.

This recipe is great! I made 2 batches, one with peanut butter, and for us hazelnut fans, one with nutella. And they were awesome. Delicious!

Great recipe!  I just pulled the pot off the heat after boiling, added the PB, Vanilla and oats and mixed.  Scooped cookies out onto some tin foil and let cool.  Easy and fast.  90 seconds was the perfect boiling time.  Thanks for a great recipe.

OLD TIME FAVORITE! I've made these for years and love them! They never last long. I also add a dash of salt to the butter mixture and usually don't boil longer than 60 seconds with great results every time. Using old-fashioned oats seems to work better than the quick-cooking oats (they soak up more of the mixture). Thanks for the post! Wonderful! Simply wonderful!

Up until this recipe I have never been able to make these cookies without them drying out or not setting well. I had no problems here. I think the difference may have been pouring the hot mixture over the oats and not visa versa like how I always used to do. And I did follow a comment about letting the mixture cool for a minute before dropping on the wax paper. Very easy and very good no bake recipe. Thanks for sharing.

These are my husband's favorite cookies, and they are so easy to make. I just cut it down to one cup of sugar because I didn't want these to turn out too sweet, but other than that, excellent cookies.

Great recipe.  The first time I made it though, they didn't set AT ALL.  After researching other recipes I want to note that you start the timing of the boil once it reaches a full rolling boil not when it just comes to the boiling point and starts a few bubbles.  It has to reach a full boil first otherwise it won't set up.  That's the mistake I made the first time.  Now I know!

These are awesome!  Taste just like I remember the ones from the school cafeteria over 40 years ago.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I used my hands to mix the oats and peanut butter because I wasn't getting anywhere with that wooden spoon.  I can't imagine someone thinking they were dry, because they are not at all.  Neither are they too sweet, IMHO.

Perfect just the way it is! At first I was a little skeptical of the 1 tablespoon of vanilla, but it worked out in the end. MMMMM!

I have made these for years, this works Much Better; after removing the pot from the heat you add the peanut butter ( I prefer crunchy ) and stir until it melts and blends in, then add the vanilla (I like the mexican vanilla with the rooster on the bottle - Much Richer flavor! ) and stir it in as well. Now, with all of the liquid parts together, the oatmeal mixes in Much better.  Set out on waxed paper and try to keep the kids away...

Simple and to the point.  The recommendation to SLOWly boil it was good idea.  I added another 1/2 cup of oats to make it more solid and less gooey

I cut this recipe in half.  At first my cookies were gooey, so I put them in the fridge and they were still gooey.  I left them out overnight and this morning they were perfect!  I think I may be using the wrong oatmeal, I'm sure it's something I'm not doing right.  Anyway, I'm going to use this recipe until I get them right cause the taste I enjoyed as a child is still there!  YUM!  Thank you for sharing!

I have also made other of these no bakes with not so great success.  This recipe/instructions maybe because of others tips came out perfect every time.  Followed the slow boil(medium heat 5)basically until the butter was melted then turned heat up to 7ish on an electric stove.  Boiled for 90-120 seconds poured into oatmeal/peanut butter bowl mixed it up and let sit a minute like someone else said and spooned onto pans. Thank you for the recipe and all the readers tips.

Followed recipe as-is without reading reviews. Should have boiled longer than it said. Mine turned out runny and the oatmeal is still hard .

Delicious. The key is to bring the ingredients to a slow boil, they really do turn out better.

Delicious. I only used 1/4 c of butter and they still turned out good. IMO, 1/2 c of butter is too much! Another poster said they used old fashioned oats. I used them too because it was what I had on hand. Let teh cookies cool and they turned out delicious. A great recipe!

Great -- just give them time! I thought for sure that I had failed when I saw that the cookies were still just goo ten minutes afterwards, but I let them sit for a couple of hours and they were perfect. Great by themselves or used as topping on vanilla ice cream!

This is the best no bake oatmeal cookie recipe I've ever used. I have tried several no bake recipes in the past, and the cookies never would set up. I've made this one several times now, with success every time! The ingredients are the same as many other recipes, but the technique is slightly different. Great recipe!

These were what my Mom called chocolate oatmeal cookies. They were a big hit with my brother and sisters and all her grand kids  and great grand kids. It was a recipe that her great grandmother had passed down to her grandmother and so on. My Mom passed it on to my daughter and me.

I followed the directions, including the boil time to the Tee and there wasn't enough liquid for all the oatmeal, so I was left with a pile of chocolate oatmeal dust?
very disappointed, considering I've used other recipes before and have never failed to make them perfectly

The ingredients and measurements are spot on, but the fact that the mixture must be stirred constantly during the cooking process to keep from burning the dairy was not mentioned.  It's also worth noting that overcooking can lead to dry cookies.

Thank you for posting this version of this classic recipe. I had lost my grandmothers recipe, and so I thought I would try this one. I dd alter the recipe a lttle. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT!!!!!

I used 4 Tbsp. of cocoa, and added the peanut butter to the cocoa  mixture during the last couple of minutes. I increased the oats to 3 1/2 cups and added to the cocoa mixture after removng from the stove. It was alot easier than mixing the peanut butter and oats, and then pouring the stovetop mixture over the top and then mixing. It was quick and easy....and tasted absolutely delicious! The grandkids loved them!

to make these almost no fat, I use coconut oil for butter and agave in place of the sugar. 
is delicious, because it has a little bit of coconut flavor like a almond joy!

These are my go to cookies when I need to provide cookies for an event.  They are so delicious and so easy!  
I reduce the sugar by 1/2 a cup, they are sweet enough.  Peanut butter can be left out when peanut allergies are a concern and it does not effect the recipe.

I was having a chocolate craving last night and decided on quick and easy. I had no cocoa powder so I decided to use chocolate chips. I added 1&1/2 cups with the peanut butter and oats and ended up with fudgy little rounds! Still excellent and really conquered my craving!

These were great.  I simmered on low for 15 - 20 mins and turned up the heat towards the last minute or two.  When a softball formed in cold water I was done.

These are so great. I made a batch before that asked for shortening. These are much better. The peanut butter makes the cookie creamy! After you mix the oatmeal with the choc' sauce. wait for it to cool. It is alot easier to from cookies that are chilled. Also, I put the cookies in the fridge about 10 min's for the cookies to set. This recipe is a KEEPER!

THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!  My recipe box disappeared along with a lot of other stuff when we moved across the country 6 years ago. Each year I make up cookie tins & boxes, filled with all kinds of homemade goodies for neighbors, friends, & esp hubby's office. No Bakes were always a HUGE hit with adults & kids alike... so thanks to you Sherrie T., this year nobody's going to be asking me where those yummy chewy chocolate cookies are! (And I missed them too! Thought I'd looked everywhere...joined this site a week ago and VOILA!  No better or easier cookie to make with kids and for them too! :-) TYTYTY!!!

This is the recipe to use.  This is the best and most consistent no bake recipe that I have found.  Turns out perfect each time.  Used the recipe just as is.

Absolutely Lovely, had a bit of a hard time solidifying, and had to add more oats.

These are really great cookies!  They remind me of my childhood.  They were really easy to make and quick.  My 3 year old enjoyed helping!  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great.

I am shocked that I haven't seen anyone added raisins to these!  So delicious when adding about one cup to the original recipe!  I add a little extra peanut butter and boil them a little longer.  Enjoy!

My Granny would roll over if she knew how easy you made these cookies with timing. She would boil her chocolate and then test it over and over till it was ready, by dropping some chocolate in a cup of cold water until it formed a ball. This way of testing never worked for me. 
I checked on this site today (CHRISTmas Eve) to see if this recipe was available and "VOILA", there it was! Thanks to you, my deceased 94 year old Grandmother's memory, who made these no-bakes for about 25 grandchildren as gifts on occasions (because she didn't have much money but tons of love and good cookin')will be much alive tomorrow as we celebrate CHRISTmas and as I share these with my sisters and cousins. I bet right now she's making them for Jesus for His birthday!!! Thank you Sherrie T.

I have tried for 26 years of marriage to make no bake cookies and failed every time.  They were either so soft we ate them with a spoon or so hard they could be used as doorstops.  This is the first recipe that has worked perfectly for me.  The secret must be in bringing it to a slow boil.  I followed the recipe to the letter and they were great.  Thank you for this recipe.

I LOVE these cookies, I followed this recipe the first time I made them and then made some changes the second time I made them.  I added 3.5 tbs cocoa powder to make them more Chocolaty and I used creamy peanut butter instead of chunky.  YUM YUM YUM!

This is an excellent no bake recipe. I do have one issue, though. "Boil no more than 120 seconds." Reading through the reviews it is humorous to see the different opinions on slow boil to rolling boil, and timing from one minute to five minutes. These cookies are basically a boiled fudge with oatmeal added, and anyone who makes candy must take into consideration the weather. On a rainy or humid day, the boiling takes much longer to reach that "soft-ball stage." On a dry day, it might be ready in a minute. It is true the best test is to drop a drip of the boiling mixture in ice water and see if it holds together with the texture of soft caramel. If it spreads or melts into the water, keep boiling!

So easy and just like my Grandma made. These bring back great memories and help create new ones with my children. These are so simple that my 10 year old can make them herself with just a bit of supervision. I prefer this recipes to others.

this is a recipe I have been making for about 30 years.  I bring the cocoa, sugar, milk and butter to a rolling boil for 90 seconds then remove it from heat and stir in the peanut butter and vanilla. Stir until the pb is melted, then stir in the oats.  They are a kid favorite.

this recipe was a hit, everyone loved it. Very simple. I figured out from making this recipe so many times that if you boil it slowly the cookies turn out better. I am definitely making these again.

I love this recipe so much. But I have a few suggestions. For the best results, I use only 2 tablespoons of cocoa, and I add another 1/2 cup of oatmeal. Only let it boil for 1 minute. If you do it any longer, your cookies will boil to long, making them not harden or crumbly. Make sure to start your timer when you can no longer stir the boils out. I hope this helps! Belive me...this tastes so much better then the original recipe! :)

These are really good regardless, but if you place them in a baking dish instead of making individual cookies & place in the freezer for about 40-45 min. - they're  awesome! 
Also, adding a dash of cherry rum into the mix is highly recommended!!

Loved them! Much easier to mix if you put vanilla and peanut butter in before the oats. I add a half to one cup of coconut with the oats-great filler and adds more texture. Both my husband and daughter hate coconut except in these cookies!! I use an ice cream scoop to put them on wax paper.

can't really go wrong here - only change I made was to use soy milk and I add the PB to the chocolate and let it melt together, THEN remove from heat and add the oats - way easier to get a good coating and uses fewer dishes.

These turned out great! I added some caramel syrup, and even with the additional sugar, these were not too sweet. My toddler loves these.

These are just like the ones from my childhood!  I used to have problems getting them to set up but if you let them boil for 90 seconds like the directions say you will have no problem!  Yummy!

I absolutely love these! I used creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy (I like the texture of the oats personally) and if you choose to make these follow the recipe to a t! If not they may end up dry or runny!

Just as I remember them from childhood! I used a #40 scoop for perfect shape and portioning (for a bake sale) and got approx 30 cookies. I dropped them onto silicon mats instead of waxed paper. The best part is that the cook gets the pan leftovers!

I used a cookie scoop and they formed beautifully.  These were very simple to make....however...the best response I got from the 6 people who ate them was these are "alright".  The texture is awful.  I was expecting them to be cookie like and they were not.  They looked beautiful and delicous but in this case, looks were very deceiving.  Thank you for posting your recipe!  I'm bumbbed I didn't like it.  A LOT of people do though so good luck!  :)

Excellent directions, thank you!!! This recipe is EVERYWHERE!!! I have this one, with the same measurements, in a church cookbook, but less than helpful directions. It is absolutely crucial that the oats be added last, or they will become soft an your cookies will lose its yummy texture. For me, 7 worked perfectly on the stove. Next time I gotta remember to wear an apron though!! Ughh..Well, THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!! ~~No matter what I tell myself or how healthy I try to eat, I can't resist these!!!!! OMG good

These have been a family favorite in our home for years!  I do, however, double the recipe and spread the mixture on a waxed paper lined cookie sheet.  When set, cut into bars. They do freeze well, too. Thank you for posting!

Wow!  Just Wow!!  These turned out PERFECT and I've never ever had a batch of these turn out perfectly.  All other recipes I've tried have turned out too soft, too hard, or tasting "off".  The only thing that I did differently from the recipe was used Old Fashioned oats instead of quick ones, because they were what I had on hand, and in past struggles, I've noticed that they do "soak things up" better.  I prefer a firm no bake, so this was excellent this way.  This recipe yielded 2 dozen for my family.  i made them yesterday afternoon and they are almost GONE already!  I really think the key is that slow and short boil.  I've never been told to do that before, so maybe that IS the trick!  Thanks so much for this recipe!

I love it these are just what I was looking for. I would suggest that when boiling the ingredients to make sure that you get to the "soft ball" stage. If you pull them too early they will not harden. I loved them!

I made over 200 of these great little cookies to send to my son and his friends in the Army! They were easy to make and turned out great. They were a BIG hit because they all loved them! Try this recipe, you'll love them!

I've made these cookies for years, the only difference is that I add 1 c. of coconut when asdding the oatmeal, etc. The coconut gives them a chewier texture.

I made this recipe for a Young Artist's party and they ALL disappeared! I made the recipe X 4, and found that it made a bit extra chocolate. Other than that, it made about 100 cookies.

My husbands favorite. I always take some into work and everybody notices the chunky peanut butter, they think that is a great idea, as do I. Thanks for the recipe, I always make sure I have these ingredients in the house at all times.

This is the weirdest thing I've ever made. They taste good but they are a little strange. The oatmeal stays somewhat firm and the cookies themselves don't get completely hard if you don't refrigerate them. If you have a problem with texture you probably won't like these, like my husband. The kid seems to like them so far. I will keep the recipe but probably won't make them too often.

I Really loved this recipe. I used margarine instead of butter... I don't know if that makes a difference or not. Now, I on the other hand love my no bakes a little gooey/soft.  I let them set out for a little while. This is one of my husbands favorites.

Very good!
I used regular oats, makes a thicker chewier cookie. Also added 2 T of hazelnut-chocolate spread. Excellent. Quick, easy & very few dirty dishes!

These were very sticky even though I kept them refrigerated. They did not easily come off of the waxed paper.  I couldn't layer them on a serving tray or they would end up in a goopy mess.  I kept them on the waxed paper and stacked in layers for storage. I wouldn't suggest making these for guests, but for family at home it's a yummy treat.

YUMMY comfort food! When I was in high school in little Kingsport, Tennessee, the cafeteria ladies at the high school would make these for us and call them "Cow Patties". LOL! I have never made these before, today was my first attempt. These came out beautifully! The only thing that I did different was add a shake of salt to the oat mixture. Thanks for the post and the memories!

OMG!  This recipe is going to KILL me!!  LOL  I had gastric bypass surgery 3 months ago and hubby has been asking me to make cookies for him.  Well, I have NEVER liked no bake cookies, so thought I was safe to make these.  Boy was I wrong!!  I took a little taste and have now worked myself up to 3 cookies today, which is A LOT for a gastric bypass patient!!  Very addicting!!  Hubby is in heaven though and just had to write that these are the best no bakes I have ever had!!

They served them in my school the whole time I was growing up. I got the recipe and made these all the time in my grandmother's kitchen. We also added more oats and peanut butter and served them in bar form. I substituted chunky PB for smooth. I liked this recipe but I will add more PB next time. Thanks for recipe!

I've made this recipe several times and have always thought that it was necessary to boil for around 5 minutes...at least that's what my old recipe instructs.  I boiled this a little longer than 90 seconds and they came out a little softer than what I would of liked..but were still eaten.  I think the addition of chopped pecans would be nice but they are great as is.  Thanks

I always love these cookies. I prefer them with 3/4 cup sugar. I also use almond milk. When I do that I wait for the mixture to come to a full rolling boil and then time it for a minute and a half before removing from heat and adding peanut butter and oats. That works for me.

Love them!!! Such a reliable recipe, just make sure you bring it to a boil slowly.

Love this recipe, blast from the past.  I will often substitute one cup of shredded coconut for one cup oatmeal.  Just changes it up a little.

I’ve been making these since I was a kid! 
If you melt the milk, butter and sugar and bring to a boil, then stir in the peanut butter, it works better. Also, add the cocoa to the dry oats and mix, then pour the hot mixture over it. Sometimes we would skip the cocoa and just have peanut butter no-bakes!

Ohh these were SO good... I love them!! I do definitely recommend reducing the sugar by at least a half a cup, because  they were pretty sweet even when I only used 1 1/2 cups. Also, I like a lot of chocolate, so next time I will probably increase the cocoa powder by a Tbsp or 2 :) Mmmm!

I wanted dairy and gluten free so I used coconut oil and coconut milk instead of butter and milk. They still turned out great. My family loves them.

I’ve been eating these cookies since 1965. My Mom made them for us 5 kids all the time. This recipe is the same one I have. I always add the coconut for added flavor and texture. I place them by heaping teaspoon fulls onto parchment paper spread out over the table. Don’t use waxed paper! My cookie dough was a bit too hot one time and the wax was transferred to my table. Took forever to get it out. I also don’t mash the cookies flat either. My family likes them nice and thick. Almost like the thickness of fudge. You can’t go wrong with these cookies. I’ve added peanuts in the past as well as toffee pieces. Great recipe!

This is the same recipe my family and I have used forever. I've made these a bazillion times and have a few tips for newbies that make perfect cookies every time: 
1. measure the oats, peanut butter, and vanilla into bowls before you start so you don't have to rush and risk the mixture cooling too much
2. melt the peanut butter in the microwave before so it doesn't cool your mixture too much before you can spoon it out. 
3. stir the entire time it is boiling and try to get all the sugar off the sides of the pot while it is boiling.
4. start the 90 second timer after it comes to a FULL boil, this ensures the cookies will set.

I made a review of this yesterday, and I would like to revise it. I love this cookie, it is my favorite! I tried lowering the amount of sugar in it yesterday to 1 1/2 cups, and in my review I said the cookie didn't set. It did, it just took several hours. I will continue to use less sugar. They are still delicious!

I’ve made different variations of this for as long as I’ve been alive (we won’t talk about how long that is…) and this is, by far, the best recipe. It’s the easiest and they always come out good. I’ve had others that wouldn’t come out good if it was humid outside or raining outside but these come out perfect every single time. Plus, my family loves, loves, loves them! And, one taking them to work for any type of potluck, everyone asks for the recipe. So, definitely five stars in my opinion!

These are such a great and quick way to satisfy your sweet tooth! They don't last very long in my house, my husband and I eat them right up. My only regret after making these is not making more!!! I have used this recipe for over a year, as the recipe states. The only time it's ever messed up is when I didn't have enough sugar and it became runny. Love this recipe. Thanks!

Simple & delicious! I've been making a slightly healthier version: substitute the same portions of butter for coconut oil & almond milk for cow's milk. Instead of sugar & cocoa powder, I use 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips (or any kind you like). I also like the texture of rolled oats instead of quick cooking oats. Also liked the suggestion of letting the mixture cool a little bit to make the shaping easier.

First time mine came out right!  Thanks for this recipe . The only thing I changed was the amount of sugar.  I used 1 1/2 cups. I will make these again. I had given up on these cookies for so long decided to try one more time glad I used this recipe.

The last time I made these was when I was a Girl Scout leader, Omgosh, that was about 28 years ago!!!! So, the only thing that I did different was, instead of dropping them on  wax paper as a round cookie, I spread the whole mixture onto a cookie sheet lined with foil!!

I used an extra tablespoon of cocoa powder and about 1/2 c fewer oats. Turned out perfect - according to my sweets-loving husband!

Use to make these for my sons when they were young. Make them for myself a few years back and realized I was really addicted to the sugar content...so i thought of ways to tweek it for me to enjoy and be healthier. I use less sugar, and can add honey if want. Have even added a bit of brown sugar once. Then sometimes i will substitute some of the butter with coconut oil. Then I add frozen strawberries and blueberries (my two favorite for this), which makes it healthier. Then throw in some walnuts, sunflower seeds if i have them, and they are YUMMY....I actually just eat it in a bowl instead of even  bothering with making the cookies!!! haha  Seems like i eat it in the wintertime only tho. I never had oatmeal in my whole life either and I love this. You can alter it to fit your taste buds even more. TRY IT...

This is about the fourth time I've made these.  I'm in the large number of people who have complained that it's too sweet. I concur!!  BUT!! GREAT NEWS!!!  I FOUND A WAY TO FIX THE"TOO SWEET" ISSUE!! Cut the sugar in half, replace the peanut butter with Nutella. Best ever.  I'll never make it another way ever again

I doubled it and had to add another cup of oats. Then I only added 1.5 Tbsp vanilla because 2 sounded like too much. They taste perfect!

Love these!! They are so simple and quick to make. These are my go to cookies if I have to make something last minute. I usually add 2-3 tablespoons more peanut butter and 1 tablespoon more cocoa. I also add only 2.5 cups of oats if I use old fashioned oats.

I am always afraid they will be too runny.  I did add 4 cups of oatmeal instead of the 3 and that worked fine as well.  So simple and so fun.

These are the ones I remember!  If you cook the chocolate mixture too long it will break apart, and you will have the opportunity to check it out as yoghurt topper!

I added just a touch more milk and heaping spoonfuls of cocoa instead of normal spoonfuls and it came out better the second time.  The first time was  a bit dry. Plus I add an extra tablespoon of vanilla.  Yum!

The first time I tried this recipe, they tasted  good, but they were dry and crumbly, which is weird because usually they turn into goopy messes.  

I've figured out the secret: you really do have to warm the sugar mixture SLOWLY. And 90 seconds of boiling is plenty.  

Then give them a quick moment to cool, then spoon them quickly before they cool into a crumbly state. These are so freakin good and easy it's crazy!

I have an older version of this cookie that uses 1/4 C cocoa and 1 C peanut  butter.  All other ingredients are the same but my old recipe is more chocolatey and more peanut buttery and less sweet.  I'll stick to my old recipe.

Perfect. Made this recipe yesterday and had to make again today cause yesterdays batch are all gone! I had poor luck with no bake recipes before but I've found my saving grace! I love these cookies and the recipe even had some leeway to add extra pb without any fail. (Looking at you, fellow pb lovers.) Here's hoping this batch is just as popular.

It doesn't get much easier than this!  After boiling the syrup I added the oats to ensure they were cooked through.  Then added the vanilla and peanut butter.  Due to time constraints I dumped the entire lot into a pan and will cut into squares once set.

My mom used to make them all the time when I was a kid and forgot the measurements of the recipe.  This recipe tastes exactly how I remember it, although I used 2 cups of oats instead of 3 the second time I made it.
This is so easy and simple to make.
Thank you for posting this!

Love that this recipe uses butter instead of margarine and simple ingredients I tend to have around most of the time.  We called these CPO cookies when I was a kid and brought all those memories back. Recommend waiting until all the other ingredients are blended before putting in oatmeal. Makes it much easier and comes out the same to me.

After using an old "given to me" recipe the other day with the same usual result of having to eat them with a spoon (which is, I guess, fine for me but kinda rude for guests), I decided that SOMETHING had to change. Every few years I try again to make these, one of my favorite cookies.
Today I made this recipe EXACTLY as provided, including timing with the stopwatch on my phone. Even down to adding the peanut butter and vanilla to the dry oatmeal, which was counter-intuitive.
HOORAY! Success! They set up just right!
Thank you, AllRecipes. (I am now throwing that other recipe in the trash!)

I really like these cookies with the slight adjustments I have made (which is my reason for four stars). I use a bit more cocoa (over tbsp more), a bit less vanilla (around half), I add a little salt (quarter tsp) and I use just a little less oatmeal (third cup less). I do not really measure these adjustments but they do make a huge difference. Five stars with these changes!

I made this recipe with the proper measurements, but slight variations to the ingredients. For example: I only had Dutch processed cocoa, I used clarified butter (hence unsalted), natural peanutbutter (also minimal salt and did not have crunchy on hand nor the kind that has partially hydrogenated oils). So I'd like to say it turned out with just the right salt to sugar mix, but no such luck. I anticipated it to be a little sweeter and put about a teaspoon of salt, but just want to say the ingredients Will vary the taste and salt content. Hope that helps someone else out!

Best to have oats, peanut butter and vanilla mixed in kitchen aid before adding hot chocolate mixture. Kitchen aid for mixing made this very easy. Two thumbs up.

Made these and they turned out okay. Doubled it then accidentally added a quarter cup more butter than supposed too. (whoops, haha) Fixed it with a little bit of extra oats and they were fine. I've used other recipes and can't say this is the best because the oats are a little too hard but it's not the worst.

I'm giving this recipe three stars because I had to adjust the amount of peanut butter. 1/2 cup simply wasn't enough, and I don't think it would have been possible to mix 3 cups of oats with that little peanut butter. I doubled the peanut butter to one cup, and I used creamy peanut butter because I don't like crunchy. Also, make sure to measure the ingredients as accurately as possible. I made them once with just a tiny bit too much milk, and the cookies were extremely soft and fell apart too easily (basically, you couldn't hold one like a normal cookie and expect it not to break in half under its own weight). That being said, only adjusting the peanut butter, these were the best no bakes I've had in a long time. They remind me of the ones I used to make in school. Just be sure to bring the chocolate mixture to a rolling boil all the way through before timing it for two minutes. I have made this recipe about five times now. The cookies have taken anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour and a half to set depending on composition and ingredients. I also recommend using pancake or maple syrup as a substitute for vanilla because it gives these cookies a distinct difference in flavor that I believe has more body instead of just being "sweet chocolate-peanut butter cookie." It makes them taste more interesting and have a slight toastiness to them. Either way, these are excellent cookies if made right! I can't stop eating them.

P.S. DO NOT use almond milk. It will ruin them!

This is a great and easy recipe! I've tried several before and never had much luck. I took a reviewers suggestion, and only used 1 c of sugar, and added 1/2 c of oats. I only had old fashioned oats and creamy peanut butter, and it was fine! Will definitely make again!

Recipe very good. I used old-fashioned oats versus the quick oats. I put the old-fashioned oats in a food processor and grinded the oats to give the cookie a smoother texture for the  cookie.

No eggs? Sweet tooth? No problem! This recipe is perfect for whipping up a quick treat when you're in a hurry. I sometimes add a little more peanut butter, but other than that, it's perfect.

Wow!!! I am trying to cut calories so I substituted almond milk, margarine and sugar substitute.  Absolutely amazing!  Turned out perfect and I didn't notice any difference with the substitutions.  I will definitely make this again...and again...and again

Easy and quick. 2 cups of sugar was too sweet (for my husband) so I make them now with 1 and 1/2 cups of sugar.

I love this simple recipe for no bakes. I make these all the time with my 9 year old, and with supervision, she can make them on her own. I've already got it memorized! I would highly recommend this to anyone with kids because it is easy for them to help.

these are so incredibly delicious. I took a chance and halved the sugar, it seemed like wayyyy too much, and indeed with only 1 cup still seemed too sweet which is why only a 4 star. I will definitely make these again, but i will probably try only 1/2 cup sugar next time.

Always a crowd pleaser at my house.  I ran out of sugar so I substituted 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar for the last 1 cup of sugar.  Perfectly sweet still and a bit more like candy.  Very good.

I love these and I use gluten free oats for my wife. I'm always in the mood for these. Throw in some raisins or coconut too. Just remember to make a second batch for yourself. They don't have to know why your not eating from there share.

I agree with a reviewer who cut the sugar in half - these are too sweet; less sugar, more cocoa. My kids always love nobakes, and they are the easiest cookie to make!

I have been making this recipe (amounts are a little different) for years.  They are my son's favorite cookie and they still ask me to make them for them on their birthdays.  So simple and so easy but once you take them off the heat, you have to work quickly as the tend to harden fast.  Don't overcook!  plc

I love these cookies - my husband's favorite.  Only thing is my recipe from "Home Mec" in jr high school used the old fashioned oats.  Not the minute ones.  Makes the cookies chewy.

I have a similar recipe that calls for hazelnut spread instead of peanut butter but I like the idea of peanut butter...in fact a combo of both.  But it was way too sweet.  Less sugar would be better.  Next time I make this recipe for my great grandchildren I will cut the sugar to one cup.
This particular recipe calls  for one Tablespoon of vanilla.  Really?  I cut the amount down to one teaspoon and it was good. 
Years ago I made the mistake of not questioning the amount of vanilla in a recipe and it was a big mistake.  If someone has used the whole tablespoon, in this recipe let me know how it turned out.

We never added peanut butter to ours in Virginia.  The key to making sure they set up is to bring the mixture to a boil while constantly stirring.  Boil it until it doesn't stop boiling as you're stirring.

I cut the sugar in half, removed the milk, upped the cocoa to 1/4 cup and added nuts and coconut and it was delish. This would have been way too sweet with 2 cups of sugar.

I have made a LOT of no bake cookies in my life. It's my go-to chocolate fix cookie, and my mom taught me how to make them. Having moved over the ocean, sometimes I have to desperately search online for a recipe I want ... These are the best no bake cookies I have ever made. EASY AS PIE, and I'm not joking, you would have to be really out of it to mess them up. Do as instructions say and boil syrup only 2 minutes. I also recommend that you use real butter as the recipe says!

I remembered my mom making something like these when I was young and thought they would be great for Christmas! I followed the directions to a tee and they turned out perfect!!  The crunchy peanut butter really made them tasty! Oh yeah I did let them cool a minute before dropping on wax paper like GollyGeeDamn suggested.

i brought the chocolate to a rolling boil and timed it for 120 seconds - cookies came out dry crumbly.  Did the next batch at 90 seconds, they were a little wet but better.  3rd batch at 100 seconds, crumbly.  You need to experiment to find the right time. Very good cookies.

If you make these just as directed, you cannot go wrong! Delicious. Make sure you heat the cocoa/butter mixture slowly, let it all melt, and then bring it to a boil. Holy yumness!!

Just like mom used to make!  Just make sure to use quick baking oats.  I accidentally used regular oats for a batch and they were way too chewy.  Also, I suggest using peanut butter without sugar, such as Adams.

Its ok but i like to double the peanut butter. You can hardly tell peanut butter is in it if you dont . Also makes them softer when they set up otherwise a little to hard.

So easy and so good! I did add extra nuts for a special treat, but "as is" is good. Also use very little sugar, as I am not supposed to have it. Used substitute sugar for baking and a third of what is called for one batch-pretty good. Glad I found this recipe.

Excellent recipe. But when I was a kid our Cub Scout Den made the same cookies with no peanut butter. I like our simpler version better... just chocolate flavor.

The first time i made these i took them to work with me and end up only getting one cookie.  So the next time I'm making 3 to 4 batches.  These is the same recipe that my grandma had.  Thank you so much for sharing this I was having a hard time finding my grandma's recipe but now I don't have to.

Made these about 5 times. If you can get the sugar to dissolve, it will not be gritty, and will taste way better!

This recipe is awesome. I have made this like a million times and just noticed I hadn't reviewed!! (I mean, 3 years!) We just made these again recently. Just try it, they are great. If you are like me and eyeball it after a while, sometimes you get a more or less crumbly result, but they are *always* good!!

Great! Can't leave a recipe alone, so I did 1/2 really good quality cocoa, and added a bit of flour, used 1/2 quick oats and 1/2 slow oats, used 1/2 nutella and 1/2 peanut butter, awesome!!!

These are just as good as I remembered them being. Very easy and quick for that immediate sweet tooth fix. My daughter has a peanut allergy so I replaced it with almond butter! Couldn't tell the difference. I also added pecans, coconut, and raisins! Yummy!!!

Very good but way too much sugar, I only used 1.5 cups but it was plenty in my opinion. Probably will reduce that even another 1/4 cup. Otherwise very good.

This is a great recipe! I've tried no-bakes so many times but they would never set. Great tip about bringing it to a boil slowly. I would prefer more chocolate and no peanut butter- reason for 4 stars. But my husband loves the peanut butter. Will definitely be making again.

Very simple recipe for the one cookie that I can not seem to keep in my house, no matter where I may hide them. So with this recipe is it easy to make them daily if I need to. When I make them for bake food sales, they are always the first to go. Sometimes for a little twist, we like to also add coconut. Thanks

Perfect! I do like my no-bakes a little less sweet, so I decreased the sugar to 1 cup. I also added my peanut butter to the chocolate mixture once it was removed from the heat, which made mixing much easier! Yum!

I have made a few batches of this recipe that I had gotten from this site and this one is the best. I followed the recipe down to the letter and they turned out perfect. The batch was gone by this morning at breakfast..(it has oatmeal in it after all ;) 
FIVE stars.

Perfect!

I hate when people make them too dry. These have the exact ratio of wet to oats. Wouldn't change a thing!

This tasted good, but didn't come out quite right.  I thought I timed it perfectly and did let it come to a boil very slowly as stated.  It still came out somewhat grainy & not as firm as they should've been.  Not my ideal no-bakes & DH didn't like them (said they tasted like frosting with oatmeal in it), so I'll keep looking.

They were a little extra chewy. I blame myself; I used rolled oats instead of quick oats.

They are too sweet and too moist to be called a cookie. Increased the cocoa to 1/2 cup to give it more chocolate flavor. These are more like a piece of candy or fudge than a cookie. Easy enough to do and the kids liked them.

My youngest brother adores these even though he usually doesn't like chocolate and peanut butter together. Very easy! Don't worry if it's pretty runny when you are dishing them out - they firm up. At least mine did. :D Anyway, very good. I didn't use quite as much sugar as some people suggested, and it was still great!

Okay, I've tried many no bake recipies for these cookies and FINALLY they came out right!!! I followed the recipe exactly and I guess the trick is the slow boil. Most recipies don't tell you that part. Also adding the peanut butter to the oats and NOT the chocolate, helps.   We ate them and they tasted the way I remembered them as a kid. Awesome! Thank you Sherrie T!

These cookies were great. Everyone in the family loved them. They were sweet but that is how I remember them from my childhood. I was looking for these cookies for awhile because I want my kids to grow up with them, too. Thanks for posting it....

My oven broke and I found this recipe to be perfect since it doesnt require any baking! The cookie turned out perfectly. They were very soft and did not stay there form, so i left them out on the wax paper overnight. In the morning they were perfect and could bag them for friends.

These are the best!  This is the recipe my Grandmother would make when we stayed w/ her as kids (she just pressed them into a pan as bars).  They NEVER cooled or hardened, cuz we ate them too fast!  My kids love them & so does my very fussy hubby!

I was so sad when I lost my mum's recipe for no-bakes.... They were my brother's favorite cookie and he was down in the dumps so I wanted to cheer him up and with a treat so I started my search and ended up with this recipe and I have to say I am so happy I lost my orginal recipe. These are the best....better then mom's...sorry mom. My first batch I think I  boiled a little too long so they had trouble setting but I was not going to waste any of the yummy goodness so I put them in the fridge and they set up perfectly melt in your mouth goodness!!! Many thanks

A great recipe.  I had lost my old no-bake recipe and now I'm no longer looking for it.  It's been replaced!  Follow the directions exactly and they come out perfectly.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is so easy and so good.  It reminds me exactly of cookies that my mother used to make.   My mom has passed on and I never got the recipe, so I was very happy to find this.  It brings back a lot of good memories.  I do add 3/4 c. of crunchy peanut butter instead of 1/2 c. because I love peanut butter!

I have made these twice now and they are oh so yummy!  Very sweet, as someone said before, one is enough for that craving.  Made them for my kids the first time and they loved them!  Second time made them to take to my Mom's group, hit there as well.  I put the chocolate mixture on VERY LOW as recommended and when it started to boil I let it boil for 2 minutes.  Came out great!  Thanks!

These are good, and easy to make.  They are so much like the ones my Mom used to make when I was a kid.  
I didn't like the chunky peanut butter in it though, so I used creamy for the second batch. Very delicious!

YAY!!!! Finally a no bake recipe I can't screw up! These were perfect. Thank you for the great tip on boiling them slowly for the right length of time. I was so pleased that these turned out the way I remembered them.

Easily done. Ok, I hate making no bakes! They never seem to come out right. Thank you for an easy recipe. You can't go wrong if you follow the instructions. The peanut butter gave them an extra richness and I LOVE THAT CRUNCH! A real hit.

very good no bake cookie, nice moist texture.  I didn't have chunky peanutbutter so I used the smooth and threw in a handful of chopped nuts.  My pregnant sister loved them (but then again, she likes pretty much everything right now)
