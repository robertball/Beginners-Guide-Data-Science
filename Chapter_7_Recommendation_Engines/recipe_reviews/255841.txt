This is terrific!  I made up all the ingredients quickly, and added the yogurt at the last minute.  Wonderful!  Everyone loved it.  The crunch, the tang, the healthy pieces throughout. Can't think of how to make it better.

10.28.16  I liked the option of using yogurt in place of the traditional mayo you always find in a Waldorf salad.  My apple and pear were ripe and very juicy, and as I suspected, that  juice thinned out the yogurt dressing, making the salad a bit watery.  Would recommend making just what you plan to eat because I don’t think this would hold up in the fridge overnight.  After one hour, it was already very wet.  In spite of the dressing comment, it tasted fresh and wonderful!  I used vanilla Greek yogurt (what I had on hand), and included all of the “optional” ingredients, as well.  Probably won’t use the nutmeg the next time, but the cinnamon was spot on.  ALLIDAWN thanks for sharing!

Delicious! I used vanilla yogurt (it’s what I had on hand) so I did not add the brown sugar. Used less celery than stated but next time I’ll use the full amount. The cinnamon was a nice touch, didn’t use the nutmeg because I don’t care much for it. Will definitely make again.

Awesome change of pace.   Used up my grapes instead of raisins and only had vanilla yogurt in the house so I skipped the brown sugar , the cinnamon and nutmeg make this smell delightful.  The first time I made this I followed the recipe and served it for thanksgiving desert, lately I make it for desert or snack.   Really love the aroma of this.

This was such a hit at our New Year's dinner party, the first dish cleared. Since it was for 14 people I used 4 pears, 4 golden apples, left out the celery. I used plain Greek yogurt, added brown sugar and honey in to sweeten the yogurt. I peeled the apples and pears, chopped them about 1 inch thick (bite size), squeezed 1 lemon over the fruit, mixed and refrigerate. I roasted pecans and sunflower seeds in the oven til golden brown, this gives it a better nutty flavor. I added the cinnamon in the yogurt, then dried mixed fruits (raisins, cranberries, blueberries) also in the yogurt. About an hour before dinner I mixed the fruits in the yogurt then topped with the pecans and sunflower seeds. When the guest sat down to eat I mixed the nuts (last to keep it crunchy) in with the yogurt.

I didn’t measure anything.  I used vanilla yogurt and real mayo, brown sugar, and a dash of cinnamon. 

I also added some slice red grapes. 

This was delicious!!
