This was such an excellent combination of flavors and textures! Sweet, savory, creamy, crispy--wonderful! And it was so easy to make. I think this would also make a great salad--with the oil from the mushrooms and the avocado, you wouldn't even need dressing. This was my first time cooking plantains, but it definitely won't be my last.

Excellent, beats a burger any day.  Added a little horseradish for extra flavor. Loved it!

This was really good.  The flavor is so complex and exciting.  I couldn't find coconut oil, so I just used canola... I'm sure it would have been even better with the coconut.  Also, I used a little less arugula, because I didn't have that much on hand.  It was still really yummy.  Highly recommended!

I don't know whether it was just because I was starving or what but this was one of the most delicious things I've ever tasted.  Can't wait to have the leftovers...

This was SO good. I couldn't find coconut oil so I used sesame instead. It turned out great, but I am going to try and find the coconut. The flavors compliment each other so well and the textures blend beautifully.

Surprisingly good. I like all of the ingredients separately, but I was unsure of how they would go together. We only needed 1/2 cup of oil and about 1/4 of the cup was left over after cooking. Great flavor.

I did not care for this.  I thought is was bland.  Interesting dish though.

Excellent!  Love the flavors.  Don't substitute a thing!  We had more mushrooms than we could fit in the pitas, though.  Use smaller portobella caps if you don't want extra.  Another tip, it didn't taste quite as good as leftovers, so only make what you can eat right away.

Delicious!  Very unique flavor.  I didn't use any coconut oil because I didn't have any on hand, but it was light and yummy nonetheless.
