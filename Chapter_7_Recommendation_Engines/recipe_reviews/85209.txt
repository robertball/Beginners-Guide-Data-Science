Great way to use leftover grilled steak!  I added a couple of sliced hard boiled eggs and some shredded cheddar cheese.  This was perfect for a quick lunch on a hot day with a tall glass of iced tea.

I made a few substitutions - I used minced green onions and chopped red bell pepper.  This is a great way to get one steak to feed several people, plus it gave us the satisfaction of eating meat even while the majority of the meal was veggies.  A success!

This was a very good and refreashing in the summer but I didn't add the onion and I used blue cheese. To make sure that the steak had some flavor I added some teriyaki sauce from Trader Joes and it really added a kick to the steak to give it some great flavor. Great Recipe though!!!

I was looking to use some left over steak and this was great! I already had some onions, peppers and tomatoes seasoned in Salad Seasoning Supreme that I threw in the salad. I topped it with smoked gouda cheese and crumbled some Melba Toast on top for crunch and used a sweet vidalia onion dressing. I know I didn't follow the recipe exact, but it is very versatile and needed some cheese. Everything is better with cheese. I look forward to having left over steak now, so I can have a good lunch the next day. Thanks for great recipe.

What a nice lunch this made for hubby and I. I don't know how to use the grill though and he was at work so I just broiled a t-bone and used that. I don't eat onions or tomatoes, yuck, so I left them off. Hubby didn't miss them anyway. I used chunky bleu cheese dressing on my salad while hubby used ranch as stated. Just a grind or two of fresh pepper and we were ready to eat! What a great way to stretch a steak, as this fed two of us easily on 1 t-bone. A great way to still enjoy steak even on a budget.

This is a really good salad.  I slice my steak and cook it with Goya Sazon seasoning (it's orange and comes in little packets) for some really good flavoring and spice.  I also bake crinkle cut french fries and throw them right into the salad---verrrrry good!  The kids love it.

This recipe was delicious and so simple.  I used a bourbon-glazed steak and sliced it thin.  I will definitely make this again!

I had some presliced beef that I used for this, it wasn't a whole lb. just like 1/4 of the package ( I used the rest in a fried rice recipe from this site ). I used green and red onion and left out the green pepper because I didn't have any, need to get to the store!! My brother ended up eating it and he said he really liked it.
