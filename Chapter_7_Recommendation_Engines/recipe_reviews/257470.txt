To be honest, I thought these would just be a nice change of pace to our usual spaghetti and meatballs.  What I hadn't anticipated was the rave reviews and requests to make these again soon.   These were an absolute hit with the family.  The only suggestion my daughter made was to use more of Barilla's tomato and basil sauce the next time.

These are fun for picnics or race day munchies! I think next time I'll add some cheese. I served a bit more sauce on the side for dipping. I used Barilla gluten free spaghetti and gluten free crescent roll using Barilla gf flour mix. Thank you for the recipe.

These were fun to make and tasted pretty good! I used my own homemade meatballs. My complaints would be that 1 pound of pasta is waaaaay too much for the amount of  pies you get out of this (only got 5 pies out of the package of 2 crusts).  This was fun to try, but For the amount I got out of it it's not really worth the effort to me.  Thanks for sharing. :)

What a fun treat for football game viewing, or a family game night! Nothing better than a favorite meal of every kid stuffed into something you can pick up with your hands.
