I made a double in two separate crock pots. Interestingly, the first came out much thicker than the other (I think I left it too long, so there was less liquid at the end to reduce... it produced much less apple butter than the other did but the consistency was nice.) I used dark brown sugar rather than light and added about a half tablespoon or so of allspice because I wanted a warmer flavor. The lack of extra sugars made for a really nice balance of sweet and sour. Definitely would recommend.

I added another 1/4 cup of brown sugar, another teaspoon of cinnamon, and 2 teaspoons of allspice. These additions really rounded out and deepened the flavor. Splendid!

I was very happy to find a recipe with little sugar. I omitted the cloves just because i personally don't care for cloves I also only put in 3 tsp cinnamon because I didn't want it to be over powering I figured I could add more after cooking if it needed it which I did not end up doing just because of personal preference I cooked it for five hours on low then turned the crock pot to high for about 2 hrs just because I was running short on time then I blended it as directed filled some jelly canning jars put them in boiling water for ten min to can the extra for later use. Thank you for such a great recipe. It's a great way to use up apples when they get over ripe and soft.

This recipe is wonderful . I have dietetic friends so for them they really enjoyed it. Not to hot on cloves so cut that in half, it turned out perfect.

The cloves threw us off, but we were happy without the ton of sugar normally put into apple butter.  Thanks!
