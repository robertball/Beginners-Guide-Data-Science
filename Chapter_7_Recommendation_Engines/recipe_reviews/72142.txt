This is delicious and soooo easy! I toss all ingredients in a screw top jar, just shake to mix.  None of that bowl and mixer business.  My hubbie requests this by saying 'I'd like to eat more salad'.  I cut WAY back on the sugar (3.5 Tblsp) and onion (4-5 Tblsp), and reduced the oil to 1/4C.  Didn't have horseradish, so I used cayenne (to taste), and I really like garlic, so I used 1.5 teaspoon of minced.  And LOTS of fresh ground pepper.  I think I could probably use even less oil to make it healthier.  Thanks a lot for the recipe, it is a winner at our house!

Used Ketsup instead of tomato soup, and left out the horseradish.  Used it for Taco Salad.  Delicious!

I used only 3.5 Tb of sugar; 1 Tb (not one ts) prepared horseradish; 2 ts onion powder instead of fresh onion; garlic-flavored red wine vinegar instead of cider vinegar; only 1/4 cup oil; and I added (don't laugh) a dash of red vermouth.  Very tasty.  Will definitely make again.

This was tasty - a little sweeter than I expected, but I really enjoyed it. I'm not really sure why the garlic clove is scewered on a toothpick. I really couldn't taste garlic at all.

Easy, delicious and a decent quantity.  Some dressing recipes make enough for 1 salad.  Very close to bottled dressing.

I did not have some of ingredients so I  used chili sauce instead of tomatoes soup, omitted horseradish. I put in a little diced garlic. The rest were as listed. We enjoyed the dressing on a salad and I used in a baked chicken dish with other ingredients.  It was very good.

Excellent recipe.  I added 1/2 cup of katsup and one large minced clove of garlic, but otherwise used the recipe just as shown, except I did use a blender because the mixer just didn't make the grated onion and other ingredients smooth enough. Don't understand why a blender shouldn't be used.  Great dip for cooked artichokes!
