I am a Religious Cajun & Creole Cook and have been cooking Chicken Gumbo for many years. This recipe is very good. I would delete the mushrooms, add some Cayenne Pepper in place of Hot Sauce and add 1/2 tsp. dried thyme leaves for more spice. Now you are close to Creole Cooking.

Outstanding! Very flavorful. I omitted the mushrooms and added celery. I also took the advice of others and added 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth. It made for a better soupier consistency. Also, in my experience, roux made with butter is much better than making it with oil. You can even use products such as Smart Balance if you are watching fats and cholesterol.

This dish was very good.  My husband even went back for 2nd's.  The only thing better was if I had made Louisiana style Gumbo.  The only part of the recipe I would change is when making the mixture of flour and oil is to stir continously over low to medium heat.  When followed the directions I burnt the pan.

definitely a keeper. but, you MUST use 1 can of chicken stock. otherwise, it will be too thick. also, i prefer to use fresh vegetables. i used fresh shitake mushrooms and tossed in a couple of half tomatos. I served over brown rice.  and to make sure that it doesnt stick to the pot, spray the pot with pam before heating the oil and flour.  good luck

This is a five star recipe with some alterations.  First, add some chicken stock, about 1 1/2 cups.  Also, to kick it up some, I cut up a jalepeno and simmered it with the other peppers.  I added a little of cayanne pepper and the finishing touch- a little sherry.  Magnificent.  Serve over white rice!

This was really good, with a few changes. First, like alot of others have said, it doesn't take 5 mins for the flour/oil to brown. You should do it over low/medium heat. I also used fresh mushrooms, a red pepper instead of green, and added about 1 cup of chicken broth. I also threw in some smoked sausage & doubled up on the sauce/spices(except for the garlic). I served over brown rice & it was very tasty! It reminds me of one of our fave South Beach diet recipes that also includes Bacon & Shrimp...yummy!!

We actually made a few changes to this receipie which gave it a real nice kick.  To make it a bit more soup-like we added 2 cups of chicken stock.  We also added kielbasa (chirozo would work as well!), and threw in a few more spicies because we like it flavorful and spicy.  This turned out to be one of our favorites, and we'll definitly be using it more in the future.

I made this and added a can of black beans to it. Everyone i gave it to loved it so much! It seems that this dish has a callback now :) It would also be great with a can of chicken stock added too, and served over jasmine rice.

I thought this recipe was great. I, too, omitted mushrooms...just didn't seem right for the recipe. I didn't have Worcestershire Sauce, so I just used three tsp of soy sauce and I added Creole seasoning. My husband had thirds. It was a bit spicy for the kids, but because I served it over rice, it was tolerable. I will make this again...especially on a cold winter day.

YUM! This recipe is great as a base...but I definitely would recommend some changes/additions. I used butter in place of the oil (isn't roux always made with butter??) and used 1/2 chicken and 1/2 chorizo or andouille sausage for the meat. I omitted the mushrooms and added in celery, okra, cajun seasoning, chili powder, and thyme. Definitely add in some chicken broth (about 1 1/2 cups) and use 2 cans of Rotell tomatoes. Serve over rice...delish!

Dang this is good. I made a huge batch of chicken caccatori in the slow-cooker and recycled the leftovers in this dish. I didn't have mushrooms so I left them out, I used honey in place of white sugar but splashed a little lemon juice in it as I found it a bit too sweet. Tossed in some crushed chili peppers and some chile powder, also added some BC spot prawns. As a quick cook after a busy work day this recipe is awesome, I really enjoyed cooking and eating this meal. I served it with brown rice and garlic bread. Five stars may not be enough. Thanks for the recipe.

Oh my! I love creole style food and always thought of it as fatty, high calorie, indulgent food. This recipe, though, dispells that notion, completely. I can have all the flavor and (almost) none of the calories and fat. Yes!! Diet jitters be gone. I'm ready to lose weight and eat great! 

I made this exactly as written and my whole family, including their overnight guests, asked for seconds and told me I just had to make this again.

My sister-in-law, who was not even there, heard about this meal and asked me for the recipe, based on word of mouth, alone. Yes, it was that good.

Thank you so much for this recipe.

Delicious, but I modified it based on other reviews. I added celery instead of mushrooms. Added a whole can of chicken broth because I thought it was too thick. Doubled all sauces and spices and served it over white rice. Oh and I also added a teaspoon of thyme and used a red instead of green pepper because I like red better. IT WAS AWESOME!

This was very good.  I followed others' suggestions and added thyme, 1.5 C of low sodium chicken broth, about 1/2 pound of andouille sausage, okra and doubled the seasonings except salt.  It still was not spicy enough for my family's palate so I will add more hot sauce next time.

If I could give this more stars I would. This was so simple to make and I did tweak it just a bit. First off I sautéed the peppers and onions for a bit then added a couple of sausages sliced in pieces. I did this because of a personal preference but not sure I would take this extra step next time. I used a cast dutch oven to make the roux as recommended by other reviews. Next I skipped the hot sauce but put in about 1 tsp cayenne. I just like the flavor. I used leftover turkey because I wanted to get it used up. I didn't have tomatoes with green chiles so I used a can of tomatoes and added a can of green chiles separately. I put everything together in the slow cooker to keep it warm for about 4 hours on low. I decided to add 1 cup of chicken broth part way through the cooking time just to have a soupier dish to serve over white rice. About 1/2 hour before we were ready to eat I added some pre cooked shrimp to warm. This was so delicious and what a great way to use up extra turkey. Thanks for this recipe it will go into my rotation.

Definitely spicy as written.  The only change I made was to add a can of chicken broth and left out the mushrooms (don't like them).  Next time I will add sausage too (upon husband's request) and celery.  So that you understand what I mean when I say it was spicy enough, I like medium buffalo wings (especially if ordering at Duffs in Buffalo, those tend to be a little spicier than standard medium and it pushes my tolerance edge a bit, much like this recipe) and for Thai I tend to order at a 3 (on a scale of 1-10).

I would give this a 5 but I made some adjustments and figured it wasn't fair to judge it based on my changes.  However, this was very good.  I took the advice of others and added Polish sausage.  Easy and tasty!

This was a great dish.  I followed the recipe with only these exceptions.  1.  Used cayenne pepper AND hot sauce, we like things to bite back, and that did the trick.  2.  I did not have the tomatoes w/ green chilies on hand, but italian style tomatoes w/ garlic, basil, and orgeno.  So I used these.  I was going to omit the mushrooms as others suggested, but when I realized that would have to use the italian style tomatoes, I decided to go ahead and throw the mushrooms in anyway.  Absolutely fantastic.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks!!

Maybe it's just me, but I was always raised that you can't cook cajun or creole without the trinity/mirepoix- onion, celery, and bell pepper.  In my opinion it would be top notch with the addition of the celery and the adding in some dried thyme and cajun or creole seasoning.  I think the last just adds nice needed kick to the spices of the dish.

Overall, I like this recipe but with several alterations.  We like garlic, so we used 8 cloves of garlic and to make it gluten-free, we used brown rice flour.   We added chopped celery, 1 1/2 cups chix broth, and increased the tomatoes to 2 cans (next time will try to find Cajun Style Stewed Tomatoes).  Added 1 \+ cup sliced Andoullie sausage, 1+ cup small cooked shrimp, and 1 bag frozen okra.  Used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and cooked them with the onion and green pepper.  It turned into a very substantial quick gumbo.  Will definitely make it again with the Cajun tomatoes and probably add a bay leaf.

Good, easy recipe.  I did omit the mushrooms and added celery. The consistency was a little dry so I added some chicken broth.I brought it up a notch in seasoning, using cayenne instead of hot sauce.  I also added a little Creole seasoning.  We'll be celebrating Mardi Gras with it tonight!

Everyone went back for seconds!  I added chicken stock (quite a bit) and chorizo sausage, as well as substituting the hot sauce for cayenne.  Instead of tomatoes with chilli pepper I added regular chopped tomatoes and two habanero/Scotch Bonnet peppers.  A huge hit!

Very good, my husband and I loved it! Instead of diced tomatoes with chilies, I used fire roasted diced tomatoes and added 3 chopped jalapenos. I also took the suggestion to add some thyme. Really good and really easy!

This was very, very good. Once I changed to my liking it became a 5 star recipe. I left out the mushrooms. added a sprinkle of cayenne pepper. added 3/4 bag of frozen chopped okra (added last 5 minutes). added 1 can of chicken broth. 
Next time I will double the sauce recipe and add a pound of shrimp/ sausage (per my husbands request).

Really, really enjoyed this Gumbo! I think that this recipe is likely best used as a 'base' recipe, to be modified a little bit depending on the tastes of the cook. Personally, I followed the advice of others and made a few alterations/additions:

1. Added one, chopped, smoked sausage coil.
2. Used Cayenne pepper in place of hot sauce.
3. Omitted mushrooms.. but doubled bell peppers.
4. Used 1 can of chicken stock.
5. 20 minutes is not NEARLY enough cook time. I simmered this for 2 hours before serving. It gave the flavours a chance to really develop and deepen. 

Absolutely divine! I am looking desperately forward to lunch today when I'll get to have it as leftovers… I imagine it'll only be tastier!

Great flavor easy to make. To add my own twist I added chopped green onions and Andouille Sausage.

Very easy and very good; can use a small rotisserie chicken from the grocery store if you don't have an already roasted chicken.

This was great, and super easy!  I omitted the mushrooms and hot sauce, and added celery, chicken broth, thyme and cayenne per suggestions - we loved it!

Great recipe! I followed the suggestion to add a can of chicken broth. I also used Cajun style tomatoes (instead of tomatoes with green chiles) & added about a pound of shrimp & a cup of sliced okra. Delicious!!

I've followed the directions exactly, minus mushrooms, and it's wonderful. But these days, I have to make this without the flour and using Splenda instead of sugar, and it's still delicious. I also usually add some thyme, as Paul Schultz suggested. UPDATE: I am just so in love with this recipe. Tonight, I started to make it and then realized I didn't have the diced tomatoes with chilis, made it just the same as always - just without the tomatoes/chilis, and it was STILL delicious!

This recipe was really good! A bit time consuming but worth it. The only changes I made were I used Extra Virgin Olive Oil instead of the vegetable oil and only cooked it with the flour for about a minute. I was afraid it was going to dry out. Also I didn't add in any parsley because as I was making it I realized I didn't have any. You couldn't tell anything was missing. I seasoned the chicken with red pepper, hot sauce, Tastefully Simple Chili Powder and Fiesta Party dip mix while it cooked in a crock pot during the day. I served it all over rice and it was delicious!

I prepared this recipe for a "Fat Tuesday" celebration at work.  Everyone loved it, including a fellow employee who is a Louisiana native.  In fact it was the first item on the buffet table to be completely devoured.
Although I prepared the recipe for 20 servings, it was very easy.  My hat is off to Stacey!

Made this with a  few alterations and it turned out AMAZING! 
Made the roux with butter and brown rice flour because I was out of all-purpose flour.  The roux took about 3 minutes to change colour. Next I added a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes instead of 14 oz and 2 cups of water with 1 chicken bouillon.  The reason I added more liquid is because I used uncooked chicken thighs instead of cooked chicken breast because that's what I had in my fridge.  I cooked the chicken in the liquid for about 50 mins covered and on medium-low, just about all the extra liquid evaporated during the cooking process.  Once the chicken was cooked I took it off the bones (it literally fell off the bones).  

Oh I also used a whole green chile pepper and added 1 tsp of cayenne.  The spice was perfect for my family!  I omitted the mushrooms and added half a Portuguese sausage. Everyone loved it and it tasted even better the next day.  I think next time I will used white meat to cut back on the fat.  Overall, dinner was a great success!

Wow!  This is so simple and amazingly delicious!  I used leftover roasted chicken, so this came together in a snap.  The flavors are rich and complex.  I did use butter instead of oil for the roux, fresh mushrooms, and 2 stalks of celery in addition to the other veggies because it needed using.  Absolutely delicious and easy enough for a weeknight meal if you use leftover chicken.  Yum!

Loved this recipe! The only thing is you have to watch the flour mixture and stir it constantly over low to medium heat or it will burn. I left out the mushrooms, and use a little sriracha sauce instead of regular hot sauce, since my husband is not a fan of spicy food. It was just the right amount of flavor!

Very tasty!  I did have to make some adjustments to the recipe, though.  I used a 1/4 of butter instead of oil, only because I've never heard of making a rue with oil.  I didn't add the mushrooms because they just don't belong in gumbo!  I also had to add a lot more hot sauce than the recipe calls for and 1 1/2 cups of chicken stock. I'm not sure why that isn't listed in the ingredients, but without the extra liquid this would have been inedible goo.

This was good, though, I don't think it tasted anything like gumbo. It also needed more liquid. (I should have read the reviews first. Everyone added liquid!)

Very good, I doubled the recipe, used butter instead of oil and added 3 cups of chicken broth, served over rice.  Family loved it and so did my guests.  There were 8 of us and there was only a little left over, so I don't see how the original recipe would feed five without the addition of the broth.

This was so so good! I left out the mushrooms (don't care for them), and added smoked sausage. I also added 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth which is definitely needed. I'm sure adding creole seasoning as others suggested would make this an awesome dish, but I prepared it as written because my three two-year olds were eating this too.  They also liked it. They even asked for more. I will be making this often.

I sliced, browned, drained, & added an Italian sausage link for some extra flavor. Also added 1c chicken broth & used fresh crimini mushrooms, along with a few dashes of a homemade cajun seasoning. Served over steamed brown basmati rice with a harvest grain bread & garlic butter. My DH loved this!  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Stacey!

I loved this recipe!  It was easy, and so rich in flavor.  I'm glad I read the reviews and added about a cup of chicken stock to the mix, and used fresh mushrooms, and also found some Emeril's creole seasoning I'd made for another recipe and cooked the chicken in a large quantity of that.  At first I was afraid the worcestshire would be overpowering but after simmering it wasn't at all.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I made this for dinner tonight without reading any reviews first.  That's something I don't usually do, but I was running late, and it looked good and easy enough.  It was delicious!  I did use butter instead of oil  with the flour.  I think it makes for a tastier dish, and I also added a couple of cups of chicken broth because it was way too thick.  After simmering for about a half hour, covered, it was perfect.  Will definitely make again when I have more time, add some sausage and shrimp and more spice for a company-worthy main course.

This was a hearty dish that was rich in flavor. We enjoyed having this tonight. There are a couple of changes I made that were great suggestions from other reviewers. ½ tsp of dried thyme was used and instead of a few dashes of hot sauce, I used ¼ tsp cayenne pepper. This brought a delightful warmth. Because I served it with rice, I wanted more of a saucy element. I felt 1 ½ cups of chicken stock went well here. This was very filling and pleasing.

Definitely don't add the flour to the oil on high. After 30 seconds of stirring, it was burned to my pot, my spoon was melted, which then dripped on my hand causing a 2nd degree burn to my palm. Tried again over medium low heat and it worked great. Despite the dramatic events, this recipe was delicious.

This was OK.  I thought it had some sweetness in the background that did not appeal to me.  There's only a teaspoon of sugar so not sure if it was from that or maybe because I used a yellow pepper instead of a green pepper.

It was good but it needed more flavor. I omitted the hot sauce(blah) in exchange for 1 tsp. curry powder and 1 tsp cayenne pepper. I added an extra clove of garlic, a dash or two of more salt and I omitted the mushrooms and used celery instead. It turned out to be delicious this way. More my style.

I made this last night when we only had 6 pieces of chicken and 7 mouths to feed. As with many of the other reviews, I used butter instead of oil and omitted the mushrooms and Worcestershire sauce. I also forgot to pick up celery while at the grocery store, so I just added 1 tsp of celery seed. Other additions: Creole seasoning, a little extra soy sauce and 2 serrano peppers. Everyone scarfed it up. It rocked. Thank you for a great jumping off point. Next time, I'll add okra.

Very Nice - Thanks to other reviews, added some sausage and shrimp, okra, celery.  DOUBLED the recipe - Great the next day.  
Used the Store-Bought rotisserie chicken and made broth with the remains after stripping off the meat.  Added perhaps a cup of the broth.  Big Hit!

i thought this recipe was missing something.  it wasn't super flaorful and didn't really taste like a gumbo to me. it certainly wasn't bad in any way, but it was just so-so.  i don't think i'll make this again, although it was very easy.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly.  At the end I added about one cup chicken stock to thin it out a bit.  I will be making this again soon.

my husband and i love this - my husband actually asks for this dish which never happens.  i use regular tomatoes and that way i can add chilis to our tasting, some days we like it hotter some days milder.  sometimes we use the mushrooms, sometimes we don't, but we always add chicken broth to make it soupier.  so glad you shared this recipe, we have it at least twice a month if not once a week.

Wish there were more stars!!! Kept going back for more and more! I used everything listed except bell peppers (didn't have any).  I also added a can of diced tomatoes and a small can of roasted garlic tomato sauce (the small can). Also, I put the chicken in raw and added extra water (eyeballed it) and put in a bay leaf and let it all simmer for about 30-45 minutes or so (to fully cook the chicken). Also I used hot sauce instead of Tabasco sauce.  I used the Louisiana One Drop Does It Hot Sauce.  Can we say YUMMMOOOO!!!  I'd even add shrimp and/or sausage, it'd go in great I'm sure.  I'd also add celery too like many reviewers say, I'm sure it'd be good in this too!  My 5-yr old lil girl neighbor tried it and loved it! When she went home, she told her parents and the father came back asking to try, of course I wanted to share and oblige! I'm sure they'll enjoy!! GREAT RECIPE and SO EASY to make!

Gumbo Style Chicken Creole Haiku: "Holy amazing! Spicy, can't-stop-eating-good. Followed some reviews." Adored this dish, and took helpful tips from many of the reviews, such as swapping mushrooms for celery, adding chick. broth (1 c.), adding 1/2 tsp. dried thyme, swapping hot sauce for 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper, and I also threw in some turkey smoked sausage. Out-freaking-standing! Not sure why there's so much discord over preparing the roux; perhaps there are different methods, but I've found the med. heat (oil, not butter, and flour), constant stir, not for a measured amount of time, but til it bubbles and darkens (deeper than peanut butter, which might as well be a gravy-thickener and not a true roux) always works for me. This "gumbo" was the perfect heat, texture, and taste, and I look forward to making it again and again.

I was looking for a way to use up some leftover turkey - and this was a winner. As several reviewers noted, adding some chicken broth helped with the consistency. And to make this a one-pot meal, I added some rice directly into the gumbo instead of serving it separately. Yummy!

Loved this!  My husband told me it was a "keeper."  I did not use the mushrooms, but added a cup of chopped celery. Also added a half of a bag of frozen okra. It was dry, so I added 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth.  This definitely goes in the favorite file!!!!!7

Great recipe. Received raves from family. Slight changes. Mushrooms were not necessary. Added File powder to give it added zest. Because of family taste buds, I left out the hot sauce. The tomatoes with chili peppers was hot enough for most. The others added their own additional hot sauce or cajun seasoning. Also used brown rice for added nourishment and flavor.

As written, this recipe is a solid 4 stars.  With the modifications - celery instead of mushrooms, cayenne pepper and smoked sausage - this is 5 stars!  Don't forget to add some Cajun seasoning, too.  The wife went for seconds - that told me a lot right there!

Excellent recipe, so easy and really good.  I followed the modifications of Paul Schulz, no mushrooms, add thyme and skip the hot sauce, put in cayenne, (just a little will do).  I loved it and my boyfriend who lived in Louisiana for a number of years loved it.

Made this last night... my husband and I both LOVED it.  I did omit the mushrooms, peppers, soy sauce, Worcestershire and used Emeril's "Essence" (the recipe for that is on Food Network)  in place of all the spices ( I guess I made something different but something that was inspired by this recipe) I added a can a green chiles and a can of diced tomatoes...I also had to add a little water, it was a little too thick for our taste but I served it over brown rice &  it was Yummy!  He even took the leftovers to work for lunch today - and he NEVER does that.

I made this recipe following the suggestions of the "religious creole cook" that rated the recipe before me. I added 1/2 tsp thyme, used fresh celery instead of mushrooms, and substituted cayenne pepper for the hot sauce. Served with jasmine rice for a truly hearty and delicious meal. Thank you! I only gave it a 4 because of the changes I made; otherwise, it's a 5 for sure!

This is my first ever attempt at making a gumbo.  Boy, was my family blown away!!!!  My 13 year old son took 2 bites of this (over white rice) and says to me, "mom this is a keeper...if you ever get rid of this recipe, I will never talk to you again!"  He scarfed this down so fast!  I added Creole Sausage in small slices and I cooked some chicken thigh meat and added that (since that was all I had in the freezer).  I added 1 small yellow bell pepper, 1 small green bell pepper (both from my garden).  I omitted the mushrooms as others have done.  This was all served over white rice.  This is a must-try recipe!!!

The only thing I changed was using crushed red pepper flakes instead of hot pepper sauce. I served the kids up first before adding the spice. My husband said that it would be even better with chopped zuccini added. He gave it an 8 out of 10. I will make this again for sure. I served it over rice.

Great Recipe! If you have family that does not like spicey food, you may want to use 1/2 can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, with liquid and 1/2 can of diced tomatoes.

Changes made:    Skipped the frying step and put it all in the crockpot.  Used hot turkey sausage instead of chicken.  Added 1 cup broth and 1 cup frozen okra.  Next time, I'll use less onion since that flavor took over the dish.

EDIT: Made the dish more as written the second time with the roux on the stove.  We much preferred the crockpot version.

This was really good! Didn't have precooked chicken so threw 3 breast halves (S & P) in the skillet, browned and cooked while getting rest of ingredients together. Removed and continued with recipe in same skillet. I agree it needed more liquid but I added another can of the diced tomatoes/chili instead of broth. A few shakes of Red Hot and this had LOTS of flavor and a nice touch of heat. No mushrooms. Served over white rice.

What a delicious recipe.  Very flavorful.  I used 1/2 oil and 1/2 margarine, and also added chopped celery.  Although I'm sure just adding cooked chicken would be fine, I sauted uncooked chicken first, removed, and continued to saute the vegetables, adding the chicken back in where indicated.  Took the advice of adding some chicken broth and deleting the mushrooms, as well.  The recipe definitely had a "kick" to it, and I loved it!

I found this a quick to assemble, easy to complete, great tasting weeknight meal.  I am not one who loves food spicy, rather I like things with a little kick, nothing overwhelming.  I enjoyed the not too strong heat at the back of the throat, and thought the sauce had a nice thickness due to the roux.  The flavor would not lead anyone to believe I had spent a mere 30-40 mins making dinner.  Plus, most of the ingredients I have on hand.  I did omit the mushrooms, and added a tsp of creole seasoning to my dish.

This was wonderful! I also added some already cooked turkey kielbasa. We thought this gave it a nice smokey flavor.

I put all the seasonings in first along with about 1/2 cup of chicken broth put the chicken in last with about 2 bayleafs and I used file powder (how can you have gumbo without it) let it simmer for 20 min and served over rice.  This is a keeper

I wasn't very impressed with this dish when I made it, all I could really taste was tomatoes.  HOWEVER, when I heated up the leftovers the following night, it tasted GREAT.  I might suggest based on this that the dish should actually simmer much longer while cooking, in order to really let all the flavors blend properly.  Either that or just make it up the day before and let it all come together in the fridge overnight!

First cooked diced chicken with Creole Seasoning Blend (from this website) in olive oil.  Omitted mushrooms and hot sauce.  Added 1 can reduced sodium chicken broth and a few teaspoons of some more Creole Seasoning Blend to simmering mixture.  Simmered for 35 minutes, which was fine.  Served with two cups hot white minute rice...and needed more rice!  This was outstanding!  I love gumbo and never thought I'd be able to make it so easily.  Follow the directions and it really does turn out great!

This was a winner!  At the suggestions of others, I added a can of light chicken broth.  I omitted the hot sauce and found the diced tomatoes with green chiles was hot enough.  Instead of chicken, I used jumbo shrimp and it was excellent!  I had both rice and linguine as options...both were great.  The four of us loved it!  If your family is hungry, deffiently double the recipe...I know I will next time.

Loved it! We just moved from New Orleans, after 8 years. I love this kind of food. There was no liquid so I add chicken broth and I did add Creole seasoning to the chicken when cooking the chicken in olive oil.

Excellent dish! I took the advice of other reviewers and added a cup of chicken broth, without it the dish seemed too thick and oily. Also, instead of the hot sauce, I used a good dose of Creole seasoning, and I left out the mushrooms.

We really liked this!  It came together pretty quickly and was devoured even quicker.  And it is healthy! For me, the flour and oil was ready in 2 minutes, but my mom said it was because we had a gas stove.  I mistakenly drained the tomatoes and had to replace the liquid with bloody mary mix (we had no plain tomato juice) but it worked very well.  Also we had no leftover chicken so I just poached a chicken breast and it worked fine.  I can't wait to make it again.

This recipe was wonderful, but as others have said, definently turn the heat to low/medium on the flour step. It was very easy to make and the flavor was wonderful (tastes even better as a leftover). It is also very easy to modify spice wise; just add cayenne, hot sauce, or hot chilis.

This was very good. I added grilled chicken thighs, smoked
sausage and celery, no mushrooms  (I don't think they go with gumbo). Who ever said in these reviews to add 2 cans diced tomatoes ( I added Ro-Tel),were absolutely right! I made the Roux it took approximately 5 min. I will be making this again,
I've already put it in my recipe rotation! P.S.I did add 1 1/2C of chicken stock.

Nothing irks me more than giving a recipe a title that is not descriptive of what it really is. It is either gumbo or it is Creole. It isn't going to be both. And in the absence of okra and a roux (which would give it that nutty flavor if you made a roux right) it isn't gumbo. 

Now as a Creole dish, it is meh. Once you've got to doctor it up, it means the recipe is lacking something, so all those who rate it 5 stars after changing it, you're not rating THIS recipe, you're rating YOURS.

I made this without mushrooms. otherwise as called for. Not the greatest found to be bitter and too hot for palate even with sugar  Only found okay for something different for leftovers. Will we have it again, I would say no.

Made this for dinner last night. It was just wonderful. My partner had two large helpings and kept saying how great it was. I did a couple of small changes, I used 1/2 green bell pepper also 1/2 red and 1/2 yellow for color and added a extra can of the tomatoes (19 oz) size as I like it a little moist. This is going to become a recipe that I will use time and time again as the flavour is great. Doreen Chopp, AB Canada 06/05/2115

Pretty good…Add the chicken stock and use butter for the roux…sub the mushrooms with celery…I also used fresh chicken breasts so the cook time will be longer...

So, modified b/c lack of ingredients in the house... We used coconut oil instead of olive oil, added black beans and okra, no chili peppers no peppers no sugar no mushrooms no onions. My guy ate it all! Bummer, no left overs.

I made this for dinner tonight. After reading all the reviews over the last few days, I made my adjustments. I used half the butter(not oil) and flour which I used when sauteeing the onions, peppers, garlic, and sausage. Because I used only 2 tablespoons of flour, there was no need to add any chicken stock. I added 1/4 tsp. of chili powder, Creole seasoning, and ground thyme. I cut the Worcestershire and soy sauces and salt in half. I did not add sugar or Tabasco. I simmered the pot of all ingredients for 30 minutes while I made the white rice. When I initially tasted the juice, it didn't seem to be spicy enough. However, after 30 minutes, the flavor and spice were perfect! My husband and I loved this dish. I'm the more critical of eaters. I wouldn't change a thing I did. We have leftovers for one more bowl apiece. Yum!

I absolutely loved this recipe. I was borned and raised in LA and this is really close to home. I only added some thyme, Zatarain's creole seasoning, sausage, and crushed red pepper because I like a lil kick to mine. I also felt it wasn't enough salt and pepper so I added more of those as well.

followed the recommendations such as using one and a half cup chicken broth,omitting the mushrooms although next time I will add them as I think it would go well. I also pre cooked the lentils. This is a keeper.

I really loved this recipe. It is easy to make with easy ingredients. It was quite tasty. I did make a few alterations with more hot sauce and salt but it had just the right amount of spice with the chicken absorbed in the tomatoes. Yum!!!! Kudos

This was delicious. I did modify the recipe a little..I added sausage and shrimp and increased my liquids by using chicken broth (can) and a little more Worchestershire, soy sauce, salt and pepper. I also added a can of stewed tomatoes. It has a awesome flavor and will definately make this again.

This was the best Chicken Creole that I've ever had! My 9 year old even went back for seconds which is unheard of unless it's junk food! The secret to a good roux is a cast iron skillet or dutch oven. I used my dutch oven and it didn't even take 5 minutes to get the right color.

This recipe is very good.  I took the advice of other reviewers and added one can of chicken stock.  I had a lot of chicken so I added an extra can of diced tomatoes with green chilies.  I plan on making this again and add some shrimp to the ingredients.

Absolutely love this recipe!  I followed some of the advice in the other reviews and made the roux with butter instead of oil.  I also omitted the mushrooms and used extra chicken broth.  Some of my own additions were andouille sausage, shrimp, celery, Cajun seasoning, thyme and some chili powder.  I add some rice, too. This is by far one of our favorite meals, especially when we let it simmer for hours on the wood stove!

Really good! I added sliced celery, sliced about 5 fresh okra pods from my balcony garden, added a teaspoon of red pepper flakes, added sliced chicken andouille sausage links (2), omitted the sugar, salt, and the mushrooms. Served this over instant white rice (it's all I had), but it was delicious. M said "good, but needs more meat and less veggies" (he's not a fan of "food that my food eats") but he made do. Thanks, SMFLRN.

Absolutely delicious! I honestly don't know why it turned out so well, it seems like more than the sum of its ingredients. I added a can of chicken broth to the roux to make it more soup like and served it over rice. I ended up having thirds. It's fast and easy. After browning the flour and adding the broth, I just threw in all the other ingredients and cooked for 20 min and that was it. Best recipe I've ever had from this site and that's saying a lot.

We really loved the flavor of this dish.  I did alter it a little so I will put it out there for everyone how I altered and let them decide.  
1st I used some canola oil and some butter (about 4 tablespoons of each with the flour.  I only let it bubble for 2 or 3 minutes 
2nd at this point is was a little too goey so added about 1 cup of homemade chicken stock.
3rd I used frozen chopped onion and green pepper about 1/3 cup each (defrosted in the microwave)  Mixed with the roux and let simmer while I got the rest of the ingredients together
4th-Added the rest of the ingedients as stated, but omitted the salt.
5th I added about a half a pound of diced smoked sausage and about 1 Tablespoon of cajun seasoning blend.  Let this simmer for about 10-15 minutes.
Served over rice for hubby and noodles for me.  I think I said this before, but I loved the flavor.

Surprisingly good...I was excited to make this for Fat Tuesday, but when it was coming together, I was like "ewwww"...so I just put a teeny bit on my plate over some rice and was wishing I had put more. It was a little spicy, but that's what Cajun cookin' is, right?

This recipe would be great but for a few things. For one thing, the name needs to be changed. It should be Creole Style Chicken Gumbo. For another, Worcestershire and soy sauces need to go. And, please, NO sugar. Mushrooms and chile peppers are okay. Those things do actually grow in South Louisiana and could realistically be in a gumbo, though Cajun gumbo is more likely to have the peppers. Also, please don't sprinkle with filet powder. That ingredient really doesn't taste all that good and its only purpose is to somewhat thicken the gumbo -- not needed here unless you leave out the roux. Then, it should be stirred in at the end, just before serving. Also, even though celery was not originally in Creole gumbo, it has been for so long now that it is pretty much expected. And yes, definitely add more liquid. Gumbo is a soup, not a sauce.

Sounds great...I have been looking for a way to use leftover turkey and this might just add the kick that it needs.  I agree to either omit mushrooms or at least use fresh.  Also, I will be adding the stock as I want this to be more soupy than not.  I always brown flower with butter and for that hot kick either add cayenne or some jalapenos.  Probably some Zatarain seasoning.   I don't usually use okra but in cajun food I like it better than usual.  I think that would add a bit of cajun to it but not a necessity.

Made it exactly by the recipe...HOLY COW...it was great! Goes great over rice. If you have a lot of guests, just double the ingredients. (this doesn't work with a lot of recipes, but it fine's with this one) In addition to being super just as it is, it make a great base if you want to experiment. For instances I made a  double batch with half chichen and half shrimp. My family and friends loved it. The ultimate comfort food!

This was my first time eating or making gumbo.  Used Quorn naked chik'n filets to make this a vegetarian dish.  Turned out great!  Added a can of drained black eyed peas and some veggie broth, and served over rice.  YUM YUM!  (If you like spicy, don't be afraid to add more hot sauce!)

This is a recipe I've been making for a while, but tonight I made a few tweaks and it was fantastic! I subbed some leftover pork tenderloin for the chicken, and added a can of rinsed & drained pinto beans that I needed to use up. At the end, I used a few tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken the finished product to a rich, gravy-like stew. Served over rice, this tasted fabulous and was amazingly hearty!

great. Made a few changes per other reviewers.  Used butter instead of oil, couldn't find frozen okra, so used canned. Added morel mushrooms (because I had some on hand).  Everyone was able to adjust the heat.

This was really good.  It was very flavorful.  It doesn't make as much as the description says (to last several days for leftovers).  It made about 6 servings for us.  It did seem to be a tad thick for my liking.  I think next time I may add some tomato juice or broth or something to make it more juicy.  We served it over rice.

A good recipe for a quick family dinner... I would definitely have to agree that without the chicken stock the consistency is far too thick. I also found the recipe a bit bland for my taste and doubled up on all the spices including cayenne pepper. All in all a good recipe.

Not crazy about this.  It did not have enough liquid at all and the flavor was lacking.  My husband is cajun, so I guess we are just used to more authentic dishes.

Cooked up in a stock pot. Used 1 b/l, s/l chicken breast oven roasted with lemon pepper, wrapped in foil, at 375 for 40 minutes. Also about 5 oz. of Turkey Smoked Sausage, sliced and browned slightly in a skillet, and about 20 raw shrimp. Substituted a pinch of dry Italian Seasoning for the parsley, 1 rib of celery for the bell pepper, and didn't use any mushrooms. I only had plain diced tomatoes. Added 1 can of chicken broth, and a few shakes of ground red pepper along with the hot sauce. Added the shrimp about 10 minutes before it was done. Served over white rice. Very good.

This recipe was very good.  I read alot of the reviews and did a combination of ideas.  I boiled 2 chicken breast with salt, pepper, garlic and some onion, then shredded the chicken before I added it in.  I left in the mushrooms, added celery, chicken broth, cayenne, thyme, sherry and some frozen okra, I deleted the hot sauce.  It was so tasty my family enjoyed it.  I asked if I should make it again and got a yes.

ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS! One of my top 5 favorite new recipes.  I did make the changes that were suggested by others.  Added 1 1/2 cup chicken broth, cayenne pepper instead of hot sauce, no mushrooms, red peppers instead of green, 1/2 tsp. thyme, and I used Smart Balance butter instead of oil.  I can't exactly say how much butter, but I just kept adding until it made a nice yellow paste consistency with the flour.    I didn't serve it with rice and ate it more like a soup and served with a spinach salad.  EXCELLENT!

I, like most changed the initial makeup of this recipe.After reading some of the other reviews, I changed the mushrooms and used extra celery, I also added a jalapeno, chopped and seeded. And to the tomatoes, I added a small can of green chile for added heat. Instead of the hot sauce, I went with the cayenne pepper. Like Emeril, I wanted to kick it up a few!! And this is a great way to get rid of left over turkey!!!!

We really liked it but I had to add Smoked Sausage, another can of tomatoes and chiles to make it more better.  I did it with our the hot sauce for the kids but it was still hot.  Just not hot enough!

My hubbie called this "restaurant style" and he meant a good restaurant.  This was very flavorful.  The 3 dashes of hot sauce were a little too spicy for my little ones so I'll cut it down to 1-2 next time.  I also added 1 can of chicken broth as suggested in other reviews.  That gave a great consistency.  This was so delish!

Well with omitting the mushrooms and adding a 1/4 of my black-n-tan that I had opened to drink, I found it to be a great dish!  I spiced it up too much for the baby to enjoy, but the rest of the family found it tasty, too!

My husband loved this.  I made changes as some suggested.  I used creole seasoning when cooking my chicken and I used beef sausage.  I added celery and left out the mushrooms.  I also used two cans of Rotel tomatoes w/chilies.  It is important to add the chicken broth.  Make rice and garlic bread and ooooh my it is good!

Made this recipe the other night and followed some suggestions. Added 1 cup chicken broth, creole seasoning,and a large dash of cayenne. To make it more authentic I omitted the mushrooms and substitued chopped Okra, added 1 bay leaf and used breast of cooked chicken bought at deli grocery, served it over plain rice. Dee-lish.

Another good recipe for leftover chicken.  I made a few changes to suit our tastes:  Replaced mushrooms with 1 1/2 cups frozen cut okra; added 2 cups chicken broth, as suggested by other reviewers; used 1/2 red pepper and 1/2 green pepper, because that's what was in the fridge; substituted 1/2 tsp cajun/creole seasoning for the liquid pepper. Accompanied by whole-grain rustic bread for soaking up the sauce.

I was surprised by the overall mild flavor. I expected the spiciness associated with Cajun food, but it was surprisingly easy on the heat-sensitive tongue. Still, I have to say that my audience was pleased with it. I used pork instead of chicken (it needed used). I think the only down side is how incredibly greasy it is. Otherwise, I thought it was excellent and will be serving it again in the future. Thanks for the recipe!

It was a little too rich for our family.  I did cook the chicken in some cajun spice before throwing it in and that was probably our favorite part of the meal.  I also added 1 1/2 cups of chicken stock.  Not sure if I'll make it again.

Really good recipe.  I didn't have all of the ingredients that were in the recipe but survived.  I also added some celery for a little bit of crunch.  Next time I think I will add some chicken broth to thin it out a bit.  Very tasty!

Well.........I didnt really like it. My daughter (12yrs old) did. It just didnt turn out like I expected. If I do make it again and thats a big if, I'll do like someone else suggested and add a cup or so of broth to it. I really enjoy cajun and creole but this just didn't do it for me. Sorry.

It was really good and different considering that I'm Aussie and I've never had a gumbo before. However I found I had to add a cup of chicken stock because it was really dry - maybe my onion and capsicum were too big. But nonetheless my friends loved it!

Super good!  We used a Oat flour because my daughter is allergic to wheat.  Added quite a bit of chicken stock to moisten the recipe.

Great recipe!  I'm on a low cholestrol diet and this was great because it had real flavor--I felt like I was cheating!!!  I had to add a little tomato juice during the final simmer but otherwise the recipe was perfect.  My husband loved it, especially since it was spicy.  It will be fixed often at our house.

I made this dinner last night with my girlfriend.  By the time we get home from work we have only a little time before watching the O.C., so a quick and easy recipe like this with excellent results made for a perfect evening.  I would agree that when cooking the oil with the flour to used a medium/low heat.  I served it with some dirty rice as well.  Can't wait to tackle the leftovers. Thanks, Stacey!!!

This is a favorite! You can control the spicy heat to make to your taste. It is an excellent leftover dish, and I am VERY fussy about what I eat as a leftover. It goes great over rice, and I'm sure it would go well with noodles. It's a snap to make, ready in minutes, and it was liked by all of my family members, who are pretty fussy and don't like "spicy" foods.

Absolutely delicious and so much wonderful flavor! I added a little bit of fresh okra to the recipe (I couldn't imagine a gumbo-like dish without it!) and used a mix of green, yellow, and red peppers. Add some extra hot sauce or even some cayenne pepper if you like it spicy.

This is delicious and super authentic gumbo! I made it in a crockpot after making the roux and sautéing the garlic, onions, celery and green peppers. The amount of water should be halved. Added the ochre and seafood about 10 minutes prior to serving. Served with Zateran’s adobo brown rice.

Really delicious! Great combination of flavors. We did add 2 cups chicken broth after combining all the ingredients to make more of a sauce. This resulted in a beautiful sauce that contained all the flavors of the ingredients, and still not soupy. Otherwise, it seems it would just have been pasty. Also, I used 2 Anaheim peppers instead of the bell pepper and added chopped celery with the peppers. Definitely will be making this again. Yummy!!

I made a lot of changes which I hate doing and then rating a recipe 5 stars, but the base was really good to work off of and, it was really good. I took a lot of suggestions from other reviews.  First of all, butter instead of oil.  red bell pepper instead of green, fresh mushrooms, I added 2 stalks of celery, chopped, I used chicken thighs and cut them into strips and also added smoked sausage, I doubled the worcestershire, soy sauce, salt, pepper, added a dash of cayenne pepper, a dash of Cajun seasoning, and 2 dashes of crushed thyme, and used 1 1/2 cups of chicken stock (instead of of broth).  It was awesome.

Used Shrimp rather than chicken.  Used flax meal instead of flour (must use 2 times flax to flour).  Used butter rather than oil, oil would have worked just my choice.  Will add the shrimp to the heated ingredients just  before serving.  Added more chicken broth 1/2 cup.
Left out the hot sauce, will allow individual family members to add when served.

The flavors were good after the twenty minute period. But I expected more of a soup. Instead it was more of a thick goulash. I added lemon pepper and garlic powder, in addition to the garlic. I liked it but will probably not make again. I did serve with rice on top.

I made it with chicken only but next time will either use or include shrimp and andouille sausage. I did add chicken broth to thin for a soupier mixture. And I also added Emeril's to the rice just to add a little flair. Very good...my husband is still talking about it!

This is a deceptively simple recipe that delivers outstanding results!  Even the picky eaters at my house thought it was wonderful and wanted to know how soon we could have it again.  

Following the suggestions of other reviewers, I left out the mushrooms and added 1/2 lb of andouille sausage.  I also used a red bell pepper instead of green, but green is definitely the traditional choice and I'll probably use whatever I have on hand next time.   

I also substituted red teff flour in place of the regular flour, in order to make it gluten-free.

I followed many suggestions listed here n reviews. 1. Definitely butter with the roux. 2. 2 cups of chicken stock when adding second ingredients makes it more saucy. 3. No mushrooms, added okra in last 10 minutes and celery with the onion and peppers (red and green). 4. Halfed  the chicken and added andouille chx sausage (awesome spice). 5. Will definitely add some shrimp or crawfish next time around!!!!  Overall completely satisfied and will make again.

good with changes. I followed suggestions of others and added 2 cups of chicken broth and doubled all spices. I cooked veggies in butter and after they finished left them in the pot, added flour and followed recipe from there.

I feel like the recipe is incomplete.  In the picture you can clearly see sausage and okra. The recipe does not reflect that.  I would also expect the holy Trinity for creole cooking.  Celery is not listed.

Despite the reviews from people that do not know a gumbo from a creole, I decided to try this.  I think it is very unfair to rate a recipe that says "gumbo style" as a true gumbo.  I took the advice of a few reviews and added a 1/2 t of thyme and took it upon myself to add 1/2 pound of andouille.  Everyone loved it.  If you are expecting a gumbo, please reread the title.  I also did not cook the chicken prior to fixing this dish and it worked out perfect.

Made this morning before leaving for work.  Can't wait until this evening.  In sampling, the roux it is just right!  Added chicken stock and omitted mushrooms. I think I may add sausage and simmer for 15 min before serving this evening. 
 Can't wait!  Yummy!!!

Straight-forward recipe but made a few changes having just returned from New Orleans. Marinated chicken thighs in Crystal hot sauce for 15 minutes and BBQ'd over Pecan wood chips. Added Country Sausage we had brought back. Added diced fresh okra purchased locally. Changed green bell peppers to half green/half red bell peppers. Used fresh sliced mushrooms. Sauce was initially too thick so added home-made chicken stock to thin and simmer. This is not a traditional gumbo but is a riff on it with the acidic tomato base. Served with white rice. Was very well received with all having two servings.

The picture shows sausage and okra- neither of which is listed in the ingredients!  Not sure where they got the pic, but it wasn’t from this recipe.

Loving it!!! When I lived in the USA there was a restaurant in Telluride where I first had gumbo. It became my go to in the winter months! This really was delicious! Also made the roux with butter and flour, add 1/2 tsp thyme, skipped the mushrooms and hot sauce and added about 2 cups of chicken stock. Chopped up a red chili and added it since I only had a can of tomato and onion mix. Included celery and chorizo. I added the thyme and cayenne to my chicken while cooking. I was lazy so I added the rice while everything was simmering to make it a one pot wonder. I had to add about another cup of water then just to get a more liquid consistency. Added a dash more cayenne just for an additional kick. Was perfect!!

I added 11/2 cups stock and cayenne pepper instead of hot sauce. I didn't add the mushrooms, instead I pan fried sweet italian sausage, sliced it and when everything had simmered for a few minutes I put it in a crock pot for the afternoon! I don't think I've ever received so many compliments from my family - great recipe!

Recipe is a little different and you forgot the celery.  Onion, bell pepper, and celery are always used together when cooking creole/cajun dishes.

Good basic recipe but needs a few adjustments. Added chicken broth because sauce was too thick, eliminated mushrooms and added celery instead.  Also, the recipe is missing thin slices of smoke sausage and WHERE IS THE OKRA!!  LOL.  Don't use salt, pepper and hot sauce... use Slap Ya Mama seasoning to taste, and you are good to go!

Easy recipe. So good. I took some advice and added tyme. No shrooms. Cayenne instead of hot sauce. And I added okra. Because I’ve never heard of a gumbo made w/o it. And I added to much garlic as per the recipe. But I say it can never have to much garlic.

Not bad but not really Cajun. Rid of the mushrooms, add okra and andouille  sausage. Go dark on the roux.

Just finished making this and oh my, love it. I did use 2x the seasoning "mix" mostly because I do like spice. The key is in the continual stirring/sifting after 10 mins until it cools substantially, and again doing that after the next 6 mins of cooking and completion. I say "key" because the liquid is going to be drawn into the nuts and/or evaporate a bit, and by stirring you 1) allow that to happen and not create a solid ball, and 2) get to the end result, being lots of the seasoning by itself on the sheet!!! The liquid goes, leaving (added a pic) lots of very, very GOOD seasonings to add that final coat to the nuts. I'm just proud of the fact that I only ate about half of them!!!  As a bonus, I'm going to try some of the liquid on my next grilled salmon --- I'm pretty sure the flavors will go well :)

I tried it as is and honestly wasn't wild about it.  I'm going back to my regular Cajun style gumbo recipe, which starts with a roux more the color of melted chocolate, includes celery, okra and andouille sausage, and leaves out the mushrooms.

Not umbo without okra and hot sauce.  Never mushrooms in true gumbo.

I left out mushrooms and added a little chicken broth and cayenne instead of hot pepper sauce. It had a little kick but my four year old still ate 3 servings. Could easily leave out chicken for a meatless option.

This was a great meal. Instead of chicken I used andouille sausage because that was what I had on hand. My husband added some shrimp.  Made a double batch and sent it as lunch with my husband and son the next day. Even better than.  We will make this again!

Was outstanding, with a little changes, was my first ever gumbo made and will not be my last! So easy to make, easier than I thought it might be. Gumbo has always been a favorite since moving to the the Louisiana area and now can proudly say can make it. Thank you! :)

We definitely liked this dish (family with 2 tween boys) BUT I have the following changes: 
-i tried making the roux with butter and failed 3x, guess i need to go back to drawing board on that
-then made the roux with oil and you MUST slowly add the flour, do not add all at once and use a whisk
-after  you achieve a roux color you're looking for (the 'copper penny' color didn't occur after 5 mins! Not even after 15!) I grew impatient and threw in the veggies- turned out fine
-I used peppers, onions, celery and jalapeño for veggies
after you toss in your veggies you must add chicken stock- maybe 1.5 cups or so or veggies are too sticky!
-I also doubled spices, added chili powder, cumin
-omitted the sugar and added a tsp of honey (not even sure it's needed)
-used chicken and added andouille sausage and it was super
-added hot sauce, which gave it an amazing kick
We will definitely be eating this again! Now I just need to learn how to make a proper roux

A good base recipe but like others I modified based on reviews.  Added fresh mushrooms, 1 1/2 cups of chicken stock, andouille sausage and a lot more hot sauce.  Served it over leftover Costa Rica rice and beans.  Family said it was a keeper so that is good with me!

I make this every couple of weeks, and if it were up to my daughters it would be made weekly. I omit the mushrooms and added chopped celery. Turns out great every time.

This was so delicious. Definitely needs the chicken broth. 1.5 cups was just the right amount. Added raw shrimp right before serving and let it cook in the sauce till opaque. Also, I make a batch of the creole seasoning from this site. (I divided by 1/3 as it makes a lot). Made the dish so flavorful! Added 5 teaspoons. Served over rice. This is company worthy.

Cooked the onions & garlic for a bit in butter (not oil), then added the peppers & cooked a bit longer.  THEN added the flour & stirred well to incorporate it. Used celery instead of mushrooms, added 1.5 cups chicken broth, and 1 andoullie sausage, all suggestions by other reviewers.  Served it with some quinoa. Made this way, it is more like a spicy, thick soup or stew. We liked it very much and will definitely make it again.

We will make this again. I also added 2 andouille links cut up as well as the chicken.  The roux was made with butter.  I omitted the mushrooms and added an extra can of regular diced tomatoes.   The celery and onion were cooked before adding in a bit of evoo.

I used fresh chicken thighs instead of precooked chicken, so had to cook it a bit longer than the recipe called for.  I expect that it was the longer cooking time that made it so tasteless.  My daughter said it best at dinner - "i. An taste the chicken and the rice and a lot of spice, but nothing else."  So all of the vegetables got overwhelmed by the spice.  Maybe using fresh instead of canned vegetables would also have helped.

Like other reviews, I used butter instead of cooking oil.  I also omitted the mushrooms and added about 1 1/2 cups of cubed kielbasa sausage instead.  I boiled the chicken breasts in chicken broth and then later added 1 1/2 cups of the chicken broth to the pot.  I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  Served over rice.  Had leftovers and I have to say, it tasted even better the next day.  I will definitely make this again.

It's very tasty even though I left out the hot sauce and just used the diced tomatoes without the chile.  It's great over hot rice.

One of the best tasting dishes I've ever made. I agree with the reviewer who suggested adding cayenne and thyme in place of mushrooms and hot sauce. If it seems to dry, be sure to add in some chicken broth.

It was delicious ... following modifications. 2 cups of low salt chicken broth added to the roux was imperative. Next time I will  quickly saute all vegetables *first*;  it took forever for the onions to soften slightly in the modified roux (I live at 7300 ft altitude and ended up using a 3rd cup of broth). I doubled all spices, omitted the green chilies due to allergies;  added  Berbere blend/spice, which is largely made up of cayenne pepper. It still lacked something so I chopped a turkey kielbasa sausage and added it at the end; it was the perfect touch. Everyone loved it.

I didn't add the mushrooms; added some thyme, cayenne pepper with the hot sauce; also added shrimp with cayenne on them. And put it over linguine. Was awesome and very tasty!

I began with the basic recipe but made a lot of changes.  I cut back some on the chicken and added smoked sausage and shrimp.  I also upped the garlic and added both Cajun spice mix and file powder.  The roux is key to the flavor.  My result was thick, rich and tasty.  I will definitely make this dish again.

Came out very good. Lots of flavor. We used a chicken breast marinated in olive oil, minced garlic, and S&P, and barbequed on the green egg. No tomatoes w/ chiles, so we used canned tomatoes and a small can of chopped green chiles. No mushrooms, and I like the idea of cayenne rather than Tabasco. May use a little more liquid, and serve over rice.

This is definitely a keeper recipe in our home. It's relatively easy to make. About the only change we made to the recipe was to cut the chicken breast as if making cordon blue, sprinkling it with salt and pepper, pounding to approximately one-quarter inch thickness then folding it together again. We let it sit in a Zip-lock bag for three hours before cooking. We found that with an 18-year-old in the house that it didn't last several days. The tenderness of the chicken stood out.

Yes. I added audoulli sausage shrimp and gumbo file plus doubled the onion and green pepper. It was a hit at the potluck-did not have any to take home.

First I seasoned the chicken breast with Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning, then broiled in oven in my cast iron skillet.. Finally, I kicked it up a notch by adding a half teaspoon of chili flakes.

Really enjoyed this! I used rotisserie chicken to save on time, and it worked great.  Lots of flavor, relatively easy to make and tasted even better the 2nd day, after the flavors had settled in.

Delicious and fast...had all ingredients on hand except mushrooms and it was still wonderful.  I did make some changes that other reviewers had mentioned by adding 1 1/2 cup of chicken broth, 1 tsp of cayenne pepper and also made a roux with butter and flour vs. oil...turned out great.  Whole family loved...will add andouille sausage to it next time!

I followed the advice of others and ditched the mushrooms. I added fresh chopped green chilis (without the seeds) and 1 cup of chicken broth. I also seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and cayenne pepper before cooking and added 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper to the gumbo mix. In the end, it made for a hearty, spicy and flavorful meal on a cold snowy day.

Really liked this recipe, as we call it in our house, "it's a keeper". I made a few modifications based on Paul Schultz's comment - I omitted the mushrooms, added 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper (maybe it was a little heaped, but we love spice) AND added 3 large dollops of Yin Yang hot sauce (my favourite). 
I actually misread the ingredients and put the chicken in raw first, stirred it around a bit, then slowly added the rest of the ingredients. I brought it to a simmer before covering and cooking for 20 minutes and found the chicken to be deliciously tender when we ate it.

I made this exactly what the recipe said. I tasted it, felt like something was off. I added 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth, 3 tsp of parsley instead of two, 2 tsp of oregano, 2 tsp of soy  sauce, 3 tsp of cayenne pepper, 6 dashes of hot sauce, 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of salt and pepper. It's kinda spicy but I think it added lots more flavor. Other then that I liked this recipe.

This is a very good recipe with a few tweaks.  I omit the mushrooms and add celery instead which I sauté with the onions and pepper. I used leftover smoked chicken and add sliced andouille or kielbasa (whatever I have on hand).  I substitute cayenne pepper for the hot sauce (to taste).  And with pretty much everything we cook, we increase the amount of garlic.  I also add some homemade chicken stock to think it out and we serve it over rice.  The last batch I made was really spicy as we used jalapeño kielbasa and had just opened a fresh container of cayenne.  Delish (little much for the kiddos, normally they devour it).

Great Recipe!! I made gumbo for the first time with this recipe and my family LOVED IT.  I made a big pot and my sons ate most of it leaving only a little for me. I took the advice of the others and added chicken broth and left out the mushrooms. This is a keeper for sure!!!! Thank you!

I made this for dinner tonight.  I omitted the mushrooms and added two stalks of chopped celery.  I also added 1-1\2 cups of chicken broth so I could let it simmer for a couple hours on low heat.  I also added some small uncooked shrimp the last few minutes.  I served over jasmine rice, with cheddar biscuits.  We enjoyed this immensely.  Thank you for an excellent recipe to add to dinner rotation.

This was delicious! I followed the directions and used the ingredients listed except for the mushrooms. I really like mushrooms but it just didn't seem to fit with gumbo. I added garlic to my gumbo and some creole seasoning and a dash of cayenne pepper. I left out the hot sauce. The creole seasoning really took it up a notch and and brought out the Cajun taste to my buds!  Try it out and make it your own. It's worth it. Also, I made fried cornbread to go with it. The family devoured all of it. Yum, yum!!! ??

Great. I did do as others have and omitted the mushrooms in favor of celery and I added some cayenne and thyme and about a cup of chicken stock. Good as is or over rice.

Love this recipe. My family knows I am not the best cook, but when I made this they wouldn't stop talking about how great it tastes. They also begged me to make this more often. Super glad I found this. You made me the talk of my family for days.

Really good.  Per other comments we skip the mushrooms, salt, and hot sauce.  I don't like any of those three, and the Ro*Tel tomatoes are spicy enough for me.  Add celery, 1/2 t. thyme, and 1 can chicken broth.

Fantastic!  I used leftover chicken from a roasted whole bird.  I added smoked sausage, which I really liked.  My husband requested that we add shrimp next time.  This was delicious!

This was great! I only had a red pepper, so I used that instead of green. Added a can of diced chiles and a small can of olives - May have made it less authentic but it was still tasty. Also added a 10oz can of chicken broth after reading reviews, but we wanted it like a stew, not a soup. The longer you simmer, the tastier it gets. Great use of cooked chicken!

This is a keeper. Replaced the tinned mushrooms with fresh ones and added1/2 a tin of mushroom soup. Did not have diced tomatos with chiles just regular diced tomatos so I added a chopped jalopeno (seeds and all)

I skipped the whole "burn the flour in the pan, get frustrated and start all over" step.  I have made this 4 times in the last 6 months - it is really good.  I saute the veggies in oil until tender then add the flour (I use 1/2 the amount), stir it all together then add all the other ingredients.  Very easy.  I have to add some chicken broth - about a cup to a cup and a half to get it to a smooth consistency.  I cut the chicken down a couple cups and add in a package of keilbasa.  I use rotel tomatoes and cut the black pepper in half - some of the kids don't like that much spice.  Also, we add the hot sauce at the table.

Great Recipe! Definitely recommend adding chicken broth for more soup like texture. I made 10 servings and half of it was in soup form. I also added extra hot sauce!!

4.5 Stars: Using other reviews, I added one can of chicken broth.  I also added some andouille sausage.  It was a hit for our Mardi Gras dinner.

This is a great recipe, but I confess to altering a bit.. I sautéed the onion, pepper and fresh mushrooms prior to making the rioux. I also roasted the chicken which gave an additional depth of flavor to the dish. I also added roasted red peppers and about one cup of wine. This is a keeper!

Very good! Was tempted to add chicken broth as others but in the end found it wasn't necessary. Once it simmers the liquid comes out nicely. Adding broth would have made it too soupy IMO. One thing I did that I think really gave it a lot of flavor was cook the chicken with Emeril's Essence (homemade). Used a heaping tablepoon's worth. Very impressed with how it came out.

Outstanding recipe!  Took reviewers' recommendation to make roux with butter (actually low fat margarine), add a jalapeno and some broth (only 1/2 cup as I like it as a stew).  Great flavor and very easy.

I made this for a group of 6 and everybody absolutely loved it.  I will definitely be making it again.  I made brown rice for this to be put on top of.  It made the dish go further and the flavor was awesome.

it was good but i needed to add about 3/4ths cup of water to keep it from lumping up on me while simmering, and at first i served it over rice, and then i just mixed the cooked rice in with it for delicious flavor and texture.

Made this last night for my husband and me, it was a tad spicy, very tasty, he loved it but a bit too hot for me.  All in all it is a great recipe and I will definitely make it again.  :)

This was wonderful! I followed the recipe EXCEPT for the 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper, I am a non-spicy person and it turned out perfect for me. I did use the Tabasco sauce as stated. It would be wonderful with shrimp and sausage. Will make again for guests!

Pretty tasty.  I added a 14.5 oz can of chicken broth, used a fresh jalapeno with a can of diced tomatoes,  threw in a couple of bay leaves, 1 tbsp of thyme, and added sausage to the chicken.  I made the roux out of the sausage drippings with a little butter.  If I was cooking just for me I would omit the sugar but my daughter likes the sweetness.

I thought this recipe was fantastic. I used fresh mushrooms and had to leave out the onions b/c my husband doesn't like them. So could have even been better.

Excellent!!  I will be making this alot!  It wasn't too spicy for my 7 year old and she really liked it too!  I took the advice of others and added a can of chicken broth, omitted the mushrooms (for my taste), used 2 cans of tomatoes with green chiles, chose to use a red pepper, added some Thyme and smoked sausage and served over rice.  So so good and easy!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Made this recipe to use up my leftover green pepper slices from a veggie tray.  After reading a few reviews, I chose to substitute celery (also leftover) for the mushrooms.  Didn't have tomatos with green chili peppers, so used a can of tomatos with lime and cilantro.  Also, added  jalepenos from my garden and some various other peppers frozen from the summer.  Agreed with others that it needed chicken broth.  For some odd reason, this recipe tasted sweet.  My husband commented that it tasted like it had pickle relish in it.  I think I will try it again and leave out the worcestershire sauce and soy sauce.  I think this recipe just needs some tinkering with!

I made this entire recipe for 2 hoping it would turn out great and we could eat the leftovers.   I'm so glad I did.   My boyfriend, who does not compliment my cooking absolutely raved about this. He says "perfect amount of spice and flavor." He ate it for lunch, dinner and the next day for breakfast. haha.   I used dried parsley since thats what I had, splenda in place of sugar, I added a couple dashes of cayenne and 2  extra dashes of hot sauce (we like spicy!).  I cooked the chicken with Cajun seasoning (made from a recipe on this site) and I also seasoned the brown rice I served this over with it.   I was worried because of other reviews this might be too thick. It was perfect for serving over rice. But I wasn't looking for a soup!   This will definitely be a weekly dinner in our kitchen. Id like to try things like shrimp and kielbasa as well. Thanks!

Tasted pretty good and will make again.  Added half a small can of chicken broth to let it simmer because it was already really thick.  Made the roux in a smaller pan that was easier for me to stir without burning and then transferred over to the bigger pan.

This was simply fantastic. I don't normally take the time to rate recipes, but this one merited it for sure. I made some of the changes that others offered in here and found it them to be quite helpful. Cook this one with confidence! It is great!

This was yummy! I left in the mushrooms (omitted the green pepper) and per other suggestions added celery and some dried thyme, along with red pepper flakes to give it a nice kick (instead of the hot sauce), and lastly added about 1/2 can of chicken stock. Definitely a keeper - thank you!

In the future I will try everyone's suggestion to add chicken stock. Also, I may substitue the green bell with a red bell. I always add extra spice to add "umph."

My boyfriend's family is from Mississippi so I had to make some changes in order for this to be even close to "gumbo style." I added frozen okra, corn, beans, and subbed cayenne pepper for hot sauce.  After those changes it was great, but the recipe as-is would be lacking.

I love this recipe. I followed it exactly as written. I enjoyed the addition of mushrooms since I'm not an okra fan. So easy and even better the next day. Served with brown rice and French bread.

Main change was to add a can of chicken broth to loosen this up to serve on rice.  Any other changes were just based on what I had in the pantry and not because of the recipe.  I will definitely make this again, as it was quick and tasty, even tho I cooked the roux on med/low and it took about 15 minutes to get a little darker than peanut butter...  Not quite coffee colored for this one, but close.  This was a little too spicy for my kids, but I was expecting that, so it's all good.  Thanks for a great, easy recipe.

I really liked this. I did add an additional can of tomatoes and some kilbasa but otherwise followed the recipe to a "T".  I served this over brown rice.  Next time I'm going to kick it up a notch with more spice.

OH MY CAN'T GET ENOUGH.  THIS WAS THE BEST.  The only thing is that my chidren thought it was too spicy so I will split the recipe and make one batch just with diced tomatoes.  Also I used two cans of tomatoes.  GREAT EATS

Great recipe. Simple to prepare yet it tasted like it took all day to make.  We added hot links and some Cajun seasoning to spice it up.

This was a good recipe especially when taking some of the suggestions here. I omitted the mushrooms, added okra, celery, cayenne, thyme, brown sugar for white, and 1 cup of chicken broth. I will definitely use this recipe again.

This recipe was AWESOME!  I did it just as stated and it turned out GREAT!  I did add some smoked sausage towards the end...just for a little extra zip.  My husband really liked it and asked me to add it to the list of things for dinner.  It was super easy, too.

Very Good recipe!  We don't know much about creole but my family really enjoyed it.  I basically followed the recipe but I did't have a green pepper so I added a 4oz can of green chilies.  I did leave out the mushrooms as many suggeted and addded celery with the onion instead.  I also added 1/2 lb cooked chorizo with the chicken and about 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  That loosened it up just a bit so it wasn't too thick but it wasn't soupy either.  We will be making this again soon.  Thanks for your recipe.

Excellent & absolutely delicious recipe!  Since others advised using chicken broth, but I did not have any, I added a cup of water and a boullion packet.  I also added a little more hot sauce, since we like things spicy.  It was wonderful!

Had so much taste to it!!!  Also added black beans and served over basmati rice.  Used hot canned tomatoes, and didn't go easy on the hot sauce, ended up pretty spicy so just watch out for that! Next time I will watch the hot sauce, but pass the heat and the flavor was gorgeous!

This was so good, and so good looking! I saw a lot of reviewers added extra liquid - I added maybe a couple of tablespoons, but I did not let it get 'soupy' at all, like gumbo. I put some cooked shrimp in the food processer and stirred that in along with the chicken, loaded the whole thing up with Tony's Chachere's seasoning, and served it to my husband over white rice. He absolutely loved it - and being born and raised in New Orleans, anything Cajun/Creole that gets his  stamp of approval is a hit for me!

I stuck pretty close to the recipe. Used red instead of green pepper, and used a small can of tomato/chili and a can of regular diced tomato (I feed two varsity football players- I made A LOT). Everyone RAVED about this recipe. Really easy and great for using up whatever you have on hand or left over- you can throw anything in this and it will be great.

I don't have anything to compare this to, but we still really liked it.  I used chicken and turkey sausage, 2 cups of chix broth and cooked the chicken first in the creole seasoning mix(recommended by another reviewer and found on this site) it was spicy but not overly spicy (my 4 yr old ate it)followed the rest of the recipe as written but instead of the hot sauce just sprinkled a bit more creole mix in.  It makes quite a bit but that's good for me so I don't have to cook tonight! Will make this again.

thankyou so much for sharing this recipe, I have 4 really picky kids and guess what they actually liked it, I changed a couple of things I left out the mushrooms, used celery instead, and I didn't have canned tomatoes, so I used tomato sauce instead saves everyone picking out the tomatoes. hubby doesn't even like cooked tomatoes.  I also used chinese hot oil instead of hot sauce,  just 3 drops like the recipe said, it gave it some flavor but it wasn't to hot for everyone to eat.

I made adjustment as others did. I  added the garlic in with the onions and pepper( I used red pepper instead of green). I added one can of low sodium chicken broth to deglaze pan after onions, garlic and pepper were cooked, then I added the tomatoes. ( I didn't have the tomatoes with green chiles but I had both ingredients in separate cans) . I didn't have fresh parsley so I added dried. increased the soy and worcestshire sauce and sugar by half. Added about 1/4 tsp of cayenne and sprinkled some Essence of Emeril in there. Also a squirt of tomato paste. I bought some chipolte chicken sausage from Trader Joe's and added that with the chicken. Five minutes before it was done I added frozen peas, When done I added a dollop of heavy cream. It was very good. A keeper!

What a spicy, delicious dish! I followed some other reviewers' advice, and I substituted butter for oil, cut out the mushrooms, added 2 stalks of celery, a jalapeno, 1 cup chicken broth, 1/2 cup red wine and a few solid dashes of cayenne. Served it with dirty rice and homemade biscuits on the side. I've mixed the leftover dirty rice and gumbo together for leftovers tomorrow, when the gumbo will be a little less soupy.

I followed the recipe almost to a "T" and it came out wonderfully. I'm a novice cook at best and I've never cooked Thai before so I was nervous. However it came out amazing and my husband loved it as well.

The only thing I did differently was follow someone else's advice and cooked the curry paste in some oil and then added the chicken. I let that simmer for 5-10 minutes and finally added the coconut milk. 

FYI two cans of coconut milk was WAY more then I needed.

:)

Fantastic!  I added another can of Rotel, kielbasa, chicken broth, and substituted cayenne pepper for hot sauce.  I loved the heat, but it was a bit much for my husband - next time I will probably use one can of rotel and one of plain diced toms and leave out the cayenne.

I added quite a bit more spice to mine and it was really good. O added cayenne pepper and chli pepper. I also added a few shrimp cut it pieces. I took the advise from other reviewers and added a cup of chicken broth and celery. I think I will add potatoes next time as well.

Wow! This was amazing. I added chicken broth as others suggested, and also a little cayenne and some celery. I kept in the mushrooms because I love mushrooms! I served this with jasmine rice and my boyfriend could not get enough of it. Next time I'll have to double the recipe!

So Good!!!  I did a few alterations of my own.  While cooking up the chicken I seasoned it with cayenne pepper, salt, pepper and garlic.  Along with the chicken, I used kielbasa and shrimp. Made it more hearty!  For the mushrooms, I used fresh, don't care for the canned.  Also, instead of hot sauce I used Tony's seasoning. I also did my roux with butter. This one is a keeper!

This was pretty good.  I didn't make it too spicy so my son could eat it too.  I did add some dried thyme to it.  It was a good dish to use up my leftover chicken and veggie kabobs.  Very quick and easy for me to make.

As always, I benefited from reading reviews before making this recipe.  I made my roux with butter and added browned flour (la farine brulee) that I prepare and keep in a jar for Creole, Cajun and French Canadian recipes.  I added okra, omitted mushrooms and on reviewers advice, added more chicken broth.  Jazzed up the spicing a bit with a few homegrown jalapeno peppers that I pickle and preserve each year.  This is my kind of food!  Thanks so much for this easy gumbo.

Quick and easy.  I had never seen a "gumbo" recipe that did not include okra.  So I added 1/2 of a bag of frozen okra.  Also I had to add liquid (I used chicken broth) to the original recipe...there was none.  I made a double batch for a group and it was well received.

This was a yummy dish that was easy to make.  I opted for cayenne pepper over the hot sauce and added some thyme as another suggested and it did give it some more flavor.  With those adjustments, I still felt like it was missing a little something in the flavor department.  I still recommend this recipe and think that many would enjoy it.

Very good.  Omitted mushrooms. Added  chicken broth. Served with warm French bread to sop up juice. Will add Andouille, crab and/or shrimp next time.  For those who said it wasn't spicy, Creole food and Cajun food differ.  Creole isn't hot.  Just a friendly note, it's file powder, not filet.

This was pretty tasty, I used dried parsley and no mushrooms, served with jasmine rice.  Also had to add 2 cups of chicken broth when adding the tomatoes and other ingredients to make more of a sauce to go over the rice.

Family loved this! I did add the can of chicken broth as others recommended. I used 2 cans of the Rotel brand 10 oz diced tomatoes and chilies, 6 Market Day Southwest chicken breasts and added a little leftover cubed ham. I left out the hot sauce because one of my kids doesn't like spicy. It was just spicey enough for her and the rest of us added it at the table. This is a great recipe with lots of flavor and can be modified to your taste very easily.

I really thought my husband and i would enjoy this recipe. The chicken just didn't flow with the other flavors, in fact, it was quite bland. I added okra, which tasted awful in the dish as well. For some reason there was just no flavor. I would suggest using a spicy sausage or marinated chicken of some sort. Otherwise, be prepared for a very bland dish.

Too goopy, not enough veggies, and very simple flavor profile... I wanted something a little more complex, not just spicy.
