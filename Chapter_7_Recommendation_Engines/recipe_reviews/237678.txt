Although it had some flavour, it did not have enough kick to it for me.

I used this spice mix to make chicken fried chicken. I scaled to 3 servings to make 2 tbsps. I am on a low sodium diet so I used onion and garlic powder for the salts, omitted the tomato soup mix as I didn't have it and used Herbox Salt Free Chicken granules. I didn't grind the mixture either and it was fine. It was tasty but my family agreed it didn't taste like KFC.
