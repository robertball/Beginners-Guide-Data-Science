This recipe is very good and can be used with a variety of vegetables. But I made one significant change: I strongly recommend that you use fish sauce rather than soy sauce, if you can find it. I believe it is called nuoc mam in Vietnam, and nam pla in Thailand; those with expertise please feel free to correct me. Fish sauce gives the curry a characteristic flavor and aroma like what you find in Thai restaurant curries. IMHO soy sauce muddies the flavor.

Great recipe - but not quite perfect.  To avoid frying my tofu, I marinated it in the soy sauce, maple syrup and lime juice for about an hour and a half, and then baked for an hour at about 325 degrees, turning over once halfway through.  (Sounds excessive, I know, but it totally transforms the tofu - makes it chewier and more flavorful.)  Since I wasn't frying the tofu, I only used one tablespoon of oil.  I used lite coconut milk and it was fine.  I somehow managed to resist the incredibly strong urge to use fish sauce instead of soy sauce, figuring that (at least the first time) I should trust the recipe author; next time, I'll save my willpower for something with chocolate in it.  Although the soy sauce was totally fine, fish sauce would be better.  And I'm looking forward to adding a greater variety of veggies.  Still, this was a really good, simple recipe, and my favorite use to date of curry paste!  Thanks so much!  EDIT:  The second time I made this, I tried it with all fish sauce.  DON'T DO IT.  It's too much.  I had to throw the marinade away and start over.  2 T of soy sauce and 1 T of fish sauce seems to be about right; a pinch of salt really livens things up.  Still a great recipe!

This dish was really tasty. I cooked for my steak and potatoes fiance (who hates bell peppers) and he loved it. We are trying to get healthier and slimmer for our wedding and this fit the bill. 

I would add 1 1/2 tablespoon more of the curry paste and 1 tablespoon more of the ginger. Also, I would use only 3/4 of a pound of zucchini and add a fresh diced tomato. 

Otherwise, this was WONDERFUL!

This is a super easy curry to make!!  The only thing I did differently was I added only 1 tablespoon of soy sauce and 2 tablespoons of fish sauce.  You need the fish sauce to give it that authentic thai flavor.  I also added garlic and green onions with the ginger.  I will definitely make this again!!!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This dish was really flavorful--sweet and sour, it's the perfect non-spicy Thai dish.

The one thing I would add is that it works really well served over brown rice. On its own, the stir fry can be a little too soupy.

Delicious.  I did substitute fish sauce for the soy sauce. This was the first time I had used fish sauce, and I think it made a huge difference in the flavor of the curry.  Other than that, I didn't change much.  I thought the basil was a little heavy, but the hubby disagreed and said he wanted more, so I guess this was a good compromise.  Will be making this again.

Amazing! This is easily one of my new favs!  I fried the tofu up with garlic, ginger and a dash of soya sauce. Also added garlic to the recipe, and did sub in fish sauce which I think made a huge difference... My boyfriend does not like seafood, but doesn't even notice a fish taste at all. The end result was delicious, and I have a feeling I am going to be making this a lot more! Thank-you for the wonderful recipe!

Yum!!  We really enjoyed this.  I did marinate and bake the tofu first, and I subbed 2 T. of Thai fish sauce as suggested.  I also used agave syrup instead of maple (and way less of it...maybe 2 tsp.).  We didn't have any basil so I used cilantro instead, but not a ton of it (just a few leaves sprinkled over the top as a garnish).  Oh, and I let the veggies simmer a little bit longer than the recipe instructs.  The combination of flavors in this dish is excellent.  I served in shallow bowls over brown rice, with plenty of the sauce for slurping.  :)  **Be sure to drain your tofu really well before chopping, and don't use any substitutions for the red curry paste.

GREAT recipe-- this was delicious. A few changes: 1) I used string beans instead of bell pepper because that's what I had on hand. 2) I also used cilantro instead of basil, and 3) I minced a couple cloves of garlic and stir-fried it along with the ginger and curry paste. I make coconut/curry stir fries a lot, and I never thought to use zucchini. It worked so well with the flavors in this dish. I love the "soupy"-ness of this; it reminds me of the hot pots I've had at Thai/Malaysian restaurants. Will definitely make this again.

Yum! Yum! and more Yum! I basicly followed the recipe with just a few alterations. I only had 1/2 of a large red bell pepper. I think one whole, as the recipe states, really is necessary. My tofu was just 12 oz. but was fine.I used 1 tbsp. of peanut oil and 1 tbsp of red chili oil for some spice. That was a perfect amount for us.Changed out soy for fish as recommended by others to make the sauce more authentic Thai. Topped with scallion onions. This is now my favorite red curry recipe! Thank you, kprzy!

As a new vegetarian, I was looking for a yummy new recipe and tried this.  I thought this was very tasty, but I wanted to caution others that my children (ages 10 and 13) did NOT like it at all.  They thought the flavors were too strong and the tofu was too mushy.  I marinated and baked the tofu, and also stir-fried it to brown it.  Maybe best to think if this as an adult meal.  It would be good with shrimp also, for added protein.

This is so delicious! The only thing I "changed" was that I let my Tofu sit in the lime juice, soy sauce, maple syrup, coconut milk overnight, which gives it a bit of the flavor. It was so great that my dad, an absolute meat lover and tofu hater, ate almost half the pan, he totally loved it!

It's sometimes challenging for me to find dishes that my whole family enjoys, adding to my challenge I'm trying a meatless diet. That said, I doubled this recipe and made it as is and my family of 6 (kids ranging in age from 5 to 19) really enjoyed this! Definitely adding this one to our favorites collection.

I have made this recipe several times now, and I think it may be one of my favorite dishes I have EVER eaten.  I can't believe my own hands can make something so good!  I follow the recipe exactly as is - I don't recommend making any changes (I use low-sodium soy sauce and reduced-fat coconut milk and it is still delicious).  It's even good without the basil, if you don't have any on hand.  And of course I always serve with rice.  A life-long favorite, thank you so much for the recipe!

Five stars for the sauce alone! It tastes like it's from a Thai restaurant! I couldn't stop eating it!  I followed the recipe exactly as written and feel that it came out too soupy. I ended up eating this with a spoon because of the extra liquid. I think next time I will use 1/2-3/4  of the can of coconut milk instead of a full can. Or, I will throw in more vegetables and maybe thicken the sauce with a bit of cornstarch.  I will also take other reviewers' suggestion to substitute part of the soy sauce with fish sauce.  I might also try adding garlic. Either way, this is SO good and I can see myself making this often!  Make sure to press and dry off your tofu before frying, otherwise it'll splatter. And substituting curry powder for the red curry paste is not even close to the same thing. Definitely use the paste!

This is one of my favourite recipes. I've been making it a few times a month for about a year and still am not sick of it! 
I press the tofu then cut it into cubes and marinate it in some soy sauce and cornstarch, then fry it in a pan until crispy and I swear it tastes like bacon! I add it to the dish in the last few minutes of cooking. 
I use more than 1 red pepper because I love red peppers so much, I usually use about 3. 
Also use a high quality coconut milk, it makes a world of difference. When I use a cheaper one it's more watery and less flavourful than a full fat good quality one.
I'm so glad I found this recipe and would recommend it to anyone.

A great recipe - full of flavor! I do add garlic with the ginger and curry paste, and an extra tblspn of Maple Syrup (a sorta picky 8 yr old). I also sub 2 tblspn's fish sauce for the soy, add a tsp of salt, and add a yellow squash in place of one of the zucc's. This is FANTASTIC!!!

New to cooking tofu, I was quite happy with this recipe (and my skills I if must say!) Use fish sauce for sure and freeze the tofu first before using.  Allows for much of the water to evaporate out and you can just chip it off it one scrape.  Plus someone told me it makes the tofu seem more the texture of meat.  Even the kids loved it!

Excellent.  I added a tablespoon of sugar because I can't resist a slightly sweet coconut curry, but it's still great without.

This is very good just the way it is.  This recipe is vegetarian and I noticed a lot of reviewers adding fish sauce.  It would not be vegetarian if you add the fish sauce.  We served it over jasmine rice.  If you want more of a spicy flavor, add more red curry paste or garlic chili sauce.  You can also substitue cilantro instead of basil if that is all you have on hand.  My whole family loved it, especially my kids!!

Delicious! I didn't have red curry paste on hand so I made my own and added diced carrots. Other than that I didn't change a thing. I served it with jasmine rice and slices of lime.

I thought this meal was tangy and tasty.  I wanted to use tofu, but my husband nixed that idea.  So, I used chicken tenderloins.  I also used grapeseed oil, dried ginger, and honey (instead of syrup).  I forgot basil, and I didn't want the red bell pepper.  I mixed all the liquids minus the coconut milk first before adding to the mixture.  oh, and i used frozen vegetables not zucchini.  i apologize for not using the recipe as it was presented - i can't stand when people do that!  but it definitely did inspire me.  thanks!

Very good curry, especially for those who are new to curry.  I didn't have curry paste, so I made my own with curry powder.  I would make it hotter next time, but the people who ate it weren't used to curry so this was perfect.  This one is very sweet and sour, with an even better taste the next day.

Overall, a quicky, yummy dish. I used a red curry paste that packed a little heat (hubby liked it more than I did). I also used cooked chicken and let it simmer for 20 minutes at the end. The only thing missing, I thought, was a bit of crunch. I'll probably throw in cashews or peanuts next time.

Good but a little too much liquid for me.  I did use lite coconut milk so perhaps that is why.  will not use quite the whole can next time.  I made a cup of marinate buy doubling the sauces (I did sub 2 Tbs of fish sauce for 2 Tbs of soy) and I let the tofu marinate in that for about an hour before stir frying it then I just added 8 Tbs of the remining marinate in place of the sauces since the measurements ended up being the same.  will make again and will try with different veggies too.

This was soooo good and I didnt have to buy anything.  I used fish sauce instead ofsoy as other reviews suggested and added green onions, garlic, and white onion. I din't use the ginger, zucchini, or bell pepper but it still tasted amazing! I think the maple syrup makes all the differance from the usual curry I make.  Will be making this again!

Absolutely delicious and quite easy to make.  Like the other reviewers, we also used fish sauce - vegan fish sauce actually - instead of the soy sauce.  I reckon that you can get creative with the veggies and have great results.  It is the sauce that makes this delicious.

Man oh man this was good.  I'm a big fan of Thai Red Curry Paste, but this takes that flavor to a whole new level.  Stunningly good.

The only changes I made were 1) pressing and then marinating the tofu in some lime juice and soy sauce, then 2) using cold-pressed coconut oil in place of the peanut oil to stir-fry the tofu and veggies in.  

Will make this again -- SOON and often!!

The flavor of this was pretty good, but the way the milk curdled up when mixed with the lime juice made it pretty unappealing.

My boyfriend and I made this and it turned out scrumptiously delicious! We marinated and baked the tofu beforehand as suggested and I think this step really made the dish a success. Adjustments made were to marinate the tofu in a mixture of peanut sauce, soy sauce, maple syrup, lime juice, and red curry paste. For the original sauce in the wok, we didn't have peanut oil so we used canola oil and we put in all the listed ingredients minus the peanut sauce we had. We like foods with a kick to it so we were a little generous with the red curry and it was definitely worth it...it came out with a hotness to it that was hot but not enough to make you grab for the glass of water after every few bites. Will definitely make again!

I substituted mushrooms for the tofu and added one cup of cashews at the end.  Also a 1/2 t of red pepper flakes for spice.  Yum!

Loved this dish!! I added garlic, mushrooms and chili paste to make it hotter!! I did make up the sauce a few hours ahead of time and cut up the tofu and marinated it then remade the sauce again for the stir fry. Basil was perfect and I used Lite coconut milk. Tasty~

I really enjoyed this, not having much experience with curry. My husband, curry enthusiast, was less than enthusiastic about it. I did use lowfat coconut milk, which may have made the difference. I won't make it again, just because I'm the only one who really enjoyed it.

Unbelievably yummy! The only change I made was to sauteed minced green onions and chopped garlic with the ginger. I love the maple syrup/lime juice in this! Don't skimp on the basil at the end. This will be a staple in my house for tofu or chicken or anything!!!

I didn’t have zucchini or basil, sadly. So I added extra peppers, as well as an onion, carrots, and a tomato. It was still too watery, so I made some rice and added it as well. I also threw in some cilantro and garlic, plus a bit of chili garlic paste. The result was probably quite different from the original recipe, but still delicious.

This dish surprised me. I'm not a fan of tofu but my son is trying to eat healthier so I made this dish with him in mind. The whole family loved it . I did marinate the tofu in the sauce for 20 mins then baked it in a 375 degree oven before I fried it . I also used low sodium soy sauce.

Very yummy and easy to make.  I suggest serving on top of jasmine rice.  It’s not really spicy so if you are sensitive to spicy, feel free to eat.

I made this with two packages of frozen California blend vegetables instead of the zucchini and bell pepper.  I put together the lime juice, maple syrup, coconut milk, and soy sauce and put the tofu in it to marinate for a couple of hours before dinner.   I used a slotted spoon to take the tofu out and saute it (I substituted coconut oil for peanut oil).  I also added a few drops of Thai fish sauce, when I added the coconut milk mixture to the pan with the vegetables and tofu.  The flavor was delicate; it could have used a little more pop from something.  I think the leftovers will be better tomorrow!

Very good! Definitely press the water out of the tofu, and I think next time I will marinate the tofu in the milk sauce prior to cooking. The only change I made was by adding crushed red pepper to give it a little zing...delicious!

Awesome dish, would recommend if you have the ingredients. 
Note: you can use curry powder if you aren't able to find curry paste. you just mix the curry powder with 1 part water and 1 part peanut oil.

Great flavor! I did add onion, more curry paste, and a dash of chili powder to make it spicy. Very pleased!

I made these swaps based on what I had in the kitchen:
Avocado oil instead of peanut oil.
1/8 tsp dried ginger instead of fresh ginger.
Fish sauce instead of soy sauce.
Vegetables - used summer squash, zucchini, red peppers and when it was done simmering, I added chunks of fresh tomato (got the idea from Tom Yum soup).
I would definitely recommend making some jasmine rice with it to pour the amazing broth over.  This recipe is a keeper for sure!

Very delicious and quick to make stir fry.  I had pre cubed tofu by a happy accident so that cut down my prep time  by a lot.  One mistake I made was frying the tofu at medium heat rather than high so it took longer to brown and was thus chewier than I would have liked (my bad).  I served this over some forbidden rice I had on hand and it was wonderful!

Very good quick and easy curry dish.  I subbed out 1 tbsp of the soy sauce for fish sauce and added some cayenne to give it some bite.  Also subbed out the tofu for chicken.  Family loved it and will definitely make again!

wow this came out amazing despite unintentionally deviating from the original recipe.. i've never bought canned coconut milk and didn't know you needed to shake it (even though it said so on the can.. DOH!).. so i basically used coconut cream for the milk.. and used a little less than called for.. i added a little more lime (bottled).. used a combo of julienned baby carrots and zucchini instead of just zucchini.. subbed brown sugar for the maple syrup and cut it by 1/3.. i left out the basil.. and lastly i added some cornstarch to thicken up the sauce.. i was making this for bf and his daughter to have for dinner and i was going to make myself something a little lighter.. but now i'm having second thoughts.. it's THAT good! ty for the recipe

I love this recipe! I love the mixture of sweet and spicy, I've added in more veggies like onion and mushroom when I make it. Also a can of chickpeas.  But it's fantastic!

Overall it was good but at the step where you add the curry paste, our kitchen got very smoky. Maybe I had the temperature too high. Not sure but it turned out alright. I think I'll attempt this one again but with only half of the ingredients. I didn't pay attention to the amounts and my hubby and I had plenty left over.

Followed the recipe, but the food was neither sweet nor sour - it was only really tasteless. :( The only thing I could taste was the tofu and tofu is tasteless in itself. I dont understand. :(

Second time I make this recipe.  This time I followed these reviewers recommendations : Marinating and baking the tofu.   Doubled the ginger.  1/2 soy sauce, 1/2 fish sauce.  Will try 1 soy to 2 fish sauce next time.  3/4 cup coconut milk, right amount for how soupy I want it.  Cilantro and one chopped green onion at the end.  Two Tbsp of  red curry paste too much for me, but I  can't eat very spicy.  Delicious both times!

After looking at previous reviews, I made the following changes. First, I marinated the tofu for a couple of hours in the lime juice, syrup, soy sauce, and less than half of the coconut milk, then baked it at 325 for 30-40min with a small amount of the marinade. When heating the curry paste and ginger, I used grapeseed oil as I didn't have peanut oil and wanted to use a safe high-heat oil. For the vegetables, I used 1 red bell pepper, broccoli, and carrots and cooked them for about 5 minutes before adding the tofu and remaining marinade. I served it with rice and sprinkled peanuts on top. It was delicious!!

Delicious! I will definitely make this recipe again. So much flavour and so much colour. I took the advice of some of the other reviewers- I used 2 tbsp soy and 1 tbsp fish sauce.  I added an extra 1 1/2 tbsp of the curry paste and 1 tbsp more of the ginger. I used diced green onion at the end for colour. And I used less zucchini and added an extra pepper (orange). I also threw in a diced tomato that I needed to use up. It is nice and saucy and goes great over rice.

I made this last night for dinner, and I loved it!! I actually left out the coconut milk and ginger root, and it still tasted delicious! It took over an hour though, so I would definitely recommend starting early because it definitely takes longer than 10 minutes to cook!! Overall, it was incredible and will be making again very soon!

A great change of pace and a flexible recipe.  I didn't have coconut milk, so I substituted (less) sweetened condensed milk.  If you do this, leave out some or all of the maple syrup.

It is a good start although I think it is a little too sweet. Perhaps one can cut down on the maple syrup to just 1 tbsp? I agree with the other reviewers that fish sauce is the way to go but add to taste as it is saltier than soy sauce. I personally would prefer a little spicier and would suggest adding more curry paste than called for.

Used canola oil and a bit of sesame oil because my son has a peanut allergy (any other ideas for substituting the peanut oil?). The lime and ginger give it a very fresh zesty taste. Was very quick to prepare and delicious. Only my two-year old didn't like it. He said 'it not tasty'.

I took ZeldaSayre's advice and marinated/baked the tofu.  SCORE!  I subbed Agave syrup for the maple syrup and low-sodium Tamari for the soy sauce and it was perfect.  I served it over brown basmati rice.

I used a Korean stir fry sauce, add a little more red curry paste, and leave out the maple syrup. It gives it a little more heat which I love! I use this base recipe over and over again. So quick, easy, savory, spicy, and delicious!

Really good.  I did sub one Tbsp of fish sauce for one of the Tbsp of soy as some others suggested.  My zucchini had gone bad so I subbed in some broccoli instead and it was good that way.  Thought I'd note that it also was great with a side of pineapple.  Next time I'll try the zucchini and add some scallions... and perhaps a bit more basil.

This is a very flavorful main dish, and my family loved it.  I marinated and oven baked the tofu first, as suggested by some reviewers.  To avoid curdling the milk, I added the milk last, after the lime juice is absorbed by the other ingredients.  Keep in mind that the final product is a little soupy, so cut and cook the veggies to preserve their crunch.  Great dish!

Sounded appetizing, but I wasn't that big of a fan. I might have put too much coconut milk. That wasn't the whole problem though. The hint of lime was good, but the rest of the flavor was too heavy. The pepper should be cut length-wise, not diced. Don't fry the tofu too much, it probably would have tasted better a little softer. I don't think I'll be making this one again.

Made this last night... Really good! I changed things up a bit... My ginger went bad so I used crushed ginger. And I had curry sauce on hand, not paste. It still turned out yummy! Seems like this recipe is pretty forgiving. Will definitely make it again!

Love this! My kids also did not like it, they tried it at least. I would love to try this with fish next time. I only had brown basmati rice, and instead of zucchini I only had eggplant and half a red bell pepper. Would have loved to put in some green beans if I'd had them. I will try another reviewer's suggestion for the fish sauce next time as well. 

Overall, my husband and I LOVED it.

Made this tonight - followed other reviewer's suggestions and substituted fish sauce for soy sauce, plus added onions and mushrooms for more veggies. I used 1/2 can of the red curry paste - gave it a bite but lots of flavor!  Yum!  I served over brown rice and forgot all about the basil - never missed it!

Turned out great.  No joke, it was very much restaurant quality.  I made a few changes for convenience purposes, changed out peanut oil with a combo of olive oil and sesame oil.  Exchanged 1 tbls of soy sauce with fish sauce.  Simply used plain ole concentrated lemon juice in place of lime juice.  I also had fun trekking through a Vietnamese grocery store finding some of the ingredients.
