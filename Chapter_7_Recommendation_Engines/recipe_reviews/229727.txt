I tried this recipe for the first time yesterday evening as a carry-in for some friends and I was concerned that it was going to be too sweet or just not a really quality dessert but as it turned out it was fantastic! I didn't add the nuts because I didn't have any on hand and I found it not necessary. I will certainly make this again! Everyone raved about it and it was the simplest dessert that I've ever put together. I do suggest to use REAL butter and to make sure you distribute all of the ingredients evenly throughout the pan. Let this get a golden brown on the top and if you choose to serve this just warm it will still be delicious. We served this in small bowls and poured some milk in with it. It stayed warm for hours after it came out of the oven. Next time I will serve it warm but with vanilla ice cream. It makes a large 9x13 pan and even with ten adults there was enough for all of us. As the Amish say "this was definitely 'more-ish'" :)

Made exactly as written. Delicious , easy to make dessert for that evening when you want something sweet and yummy, but don't want to have to work hard for it. Also made it with oat & honey granola on top instead of nuts and vanilla ice cream to boot. It was our over all favorite. Thanks LuckyLeaf!

Everyone loved it.  The only change I made to ingredients was to use about 3 c. frozen blueberries as that's what I had on hand.  I added about 1/4 c. sugar to them and let them sit for about 15 min.  For the topping I cut cold butter into the cake mix, then mixed the nuts in and sprinkled it all on top of the fruit.  Delicious!
