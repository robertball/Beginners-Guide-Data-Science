These were yummy. Followed the recipe as is... except for using flax seed meal instead of seeds and cooking with non stick spray. I've served this on a bun and by itself.. tasty both ways

A really tasty veggie! I used pecans instead of the walnuts, butternut squash in place of the sweet potato, and added a couple tablespoons of nutritional yeast. Served it on whole grain diet bread with (don't judge me!) American cheese slices, ketchup, yellow mustard, diced onion and dill pickle slices with a side of my purple cole slaw. This low carb burger will stick to your ribs!

Awesome burgers! The walnuts really do the trick in giving it more of an earthy quality. I used all the same ingredients except I left out the flaxseed and subbed cooked barley since it has a lower glycemic index than oats. My vegetarian husband approved. I did whip up my own burger sauce instead of just plain mayo or ketchup (mayo, spicy mustard, chili sauce and sweet baby rays)......oh yeah!

These were pretty good. Not the best. That's why 4 stars. I think it's just a matter of taste, that's all. But the recipe worked, I didn't change anything.

These are very good although I am not sure whether regular condiments are right on it. I am sure lettuce would be good and am looking for right sauce. Maybe chili garlic sauce from the Asian market.

Ok first of all I have tried several veggie burgers but this recipe by far is supreme! I only had one can of black beans and one can of red kidneys but it worked. Since I love mushrooms and onions I tripled the amount, doubled walnuts, coarsely chopped for crunch, doubled oats and sat in refrigerator overnight for maximum absorption. This babies are moist and delish! Yield: 9 good sized burgers

I rated this a five for a couple reasons. It looks like a beef burger which is wonderful because we eat with our eyes too! I didn't have sweet potato on hand so I subbed in zucchini raw and added a 1/4 cup more oats for soaking up moisture. I also added an egg because I added more mushrooms because I love them. Definitely a win! I'll be making them again. Making them thicker is ideal. I don't suggest a thin burger even if you think you like that type usually, it's very crumbly that way. Enjoy!

This recipe got a thumbs up from 3 non-vegetarians. I was worried it might taste too walnutty but it didn't. I only made a couple altercations because I didn't have a few ingredients. I didn't add cumin, I only had white mushrooms and I didn't have the pepper so I added 1/4c rotel diced tomatoes and green chilies.
