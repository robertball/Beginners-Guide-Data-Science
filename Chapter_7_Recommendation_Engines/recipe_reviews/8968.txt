This was delicious, but I was a little confused about the directions.  I didn't know why I needed to simmer it for 2 hours when the chicken was already cooked, so I simmered for less than 1/2 and hour and put it in the oven.  I also made more than 2 layers because I had enough ingredients. It was still very yummy and I will make it again!

Delicious, delicious, delicious,  this receipe is perfect!  I followed it entirely the first time we made it and then improved the second...it was fabulous both times!  We added more of a variety of vegetables the second time and there wasn't any complaining from the kids for 'having' to eat their vegies!

My wife and I liked this a lot. I made a few touch-ups: 

- I veganized the recipe by using seitan instead of chicken. I lightly browned the seitan in a couple tablespoons of canola oil. Seitan is a high-protein veggie meat made primarily from wheat gluten; it's available in Whole Foods-type stores and sometimes "regular" grocery stores. In recipes, it has a taste and texture similar to chicken. There are lots of recipes for it online, but I always buy it ready-made from a package. I also used Follow Your Heart vegan cheddar (though my first choice, had I not had leftovers to use up, would have been Daiya vegan cheddar).

- Mindful of other reviewers' comments, I added some garlic powder to the mixture as well as some corn starch for thickening.

I served it kind of half over, half next to rice, for which I added a bit of Mexcan spices to the broth. I lightly spooned salsa verde on top of the dish.

This was outstanding...my daughter and I had seconds, and my son had thirds!!!  The only disappointment I had was that it was a little too soupy for my liking.  I will make it again, but I think I will had a little cornstarch to thicken it up a bit.  Thanks for an awesome dinner!

I made this for 4 servings. I oven baked the chicken breasts ahead of time. Since the chicken was already cooked, I put all the ingredients in the frying pan and simmered it for 15 minutes. I also added 3/4 cup of raw rice while simmering. After arranging all ingredients in the baking dish, I covered it and baked it for 35 minutes, uncovered it and let it bake for another 15 minutes. Adding the rice really helped it from being too soupy.

My family loved this recipe.  These are the changes I made: 
*omitted water 
*added 1/2 tsp cumin 
*added additional garlic   
*used sharp cheddar cheese and about a cup more than the recipe calls for 
*used shallots in place of onion
*added 1 cup of shredded potato to thicken it some.  
It was still a little soupy but did thicken as it cooled a bit.  So it turned out just right after adding the potato.
I served this with red rice on the side and I got rave reviews from my picky family!  This will become a regular in my home.

We didn't care for this at all, unfortunately. The flavors just didn't blend very well, it wasn't very appetizing to look at, and the tortillas were mushy and unpleasant. Not recommended. Sorry.

I made the recipe exactly as is and this did not go over well with my family.  My husband said it was too bland, my 3 year old only ate it because we made him, and my 16 month old had fun smearing it (he usually eats ANYTHING).  It came out way to liquidy.  Almost like a thick soup.

My husband liked the flavor, but it was way too soupy for me.  If there is a next time making this for me, I'll leave out the extra water and thicken with a little corn starch.

In this recipe I do not see that it calls for cooked chicken as one reader suggested or am I missing something?

YUM!, I used the leftover dark turkey from Thanksgiving diner. I didn't have quite 4cups of gravy so I used a can of condensed cream of chicken soup plus I added a cup of chopped cilantro. PS- the pic is from me :-) AND I used real Hatch green chili!!! BEST enchiladas EVER!

Taste great just too soupy and that was with adding only 1/4c of water and the recipe recommended 1c. Added mozarella cheese, about 1/2c. Served with black bean and corn salsa, shredded lettuce and sour cream. Next time not as much chicken gravy.

I probably shouldn't rate this recipe because I changed it so much but it turned out great so I thought I'd pass in on.  I used left over chicken from Roast Sticky Chicken-Rotisserie Style on this site (also made Chicken Tortilla Soup V, both awesome recipes).  I used about a cup of cooked brown rice, onion, bell pepper, brocolli and garlic (really you could use any veggies: zuchinni, mushrooms) and about 1 1/2 Tablespoons of the Taco Seasoning I (also from this site).  I sauteed the veggies in a little oil with the Taco Seasoning, then added the rice and chicken to re-heat.  I made a double batch of Simple Chicken Gravy (again, from this site) from the dripping from the roasted chicken the night before.  Put a little of the gravy at the bottom of the pan and layered 6 corn torillas then rice and veggie mix half the gravy over the rice a little cheese.  I had enough for 2 full layers with the top being 6 more corn tortillas a little gravy for moisture and some cheese.  Cooked it as directed.  Wasn't watery like other reviews.  Very tasty, my two kids and husband loved it.

I thought that by reading all these great reviews that we'd be happy with this recipe.......NOT! It looked gross, and the tortillas were soggy, kind of a gummy texture. Good luck with making this one

Very good & easy to assemble. I like celery, but will omit it the next time. Had only one cup of leftover gravy & no green chilies so I substituted 1 cup of already made chunky salsa. The result was still very moist. Will make again, thanks Tracy.

wow, this was good. The changes I made:  I added some thinly sliced potatoes to the mix and substituted a bit of the liquid from a jar of jalapenos instead of water. I didn't have corn tortillas so I used flour (loved it but I'll go to corn to save some calories next time), and I made one layer just of shredded cheese, red pepper bits and salsa.

Added a lot of veggies, all I had at home while making a quick gravy. Used tofu instead of chicken and I did not even get to taste what was made.....all eaten up!! The idea is great!

I made my own chicken gravy with some chicken broth and flour so I could control the sodium. I also used about 1/4 cup of sour cream in the gravy. Yum!! I will Never roll another enchilada!

This was pretty good, but I don't think I'll make it again. It didn't have the wow factor, but it was a great way to use a bunch of leftovers. I like enchiladas better.
