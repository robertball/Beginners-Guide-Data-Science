I LOVE this recipe!! Especially in the summer with my beans and tomatoes from the garden. It's so easy to prepare too.  I love the tomato mixture so much that now i use it as my spaghetti sauce! I roast the tomatoes according to the recipe, but instead of adding the beans at the end, i just cook a heavy pasta (I like rigatoni) and pour the tomatoes over the pasta. Lots of flavor with the garlic clove!

This recipe is amazingly tasty, and so simple! The taste of the roasted tomatoes combine perfectly with the green beans and the garlic. Don't change a thing.

Love it, I've made it for just us as well as company. This time I added some fresh spicy globe basil, oregano and German thyme. I'm sure it will just take it to a new level of yummy

Greens beans are bland so after steaming or boiling them (don't over do it) I threw them in the last 7 min with the tomatoes, added more salt and mixed all together and continued to stew/bake with tomatoes till done. It turned out pretty good.

These were good and a nice change from steamed green beans. My husband commented he liked them even better the next day!

Giving up potatoes for our health has been hard. Veggies have become a bore so I'm trying new things. This one is a perfect compliment to any meal. I didn't change a thing and it was quick and easy, a real winner!

This was excellent. I didn't have garden ingredients  since it's Feb, but I used haricot vert that I bought at Costco and it was delicious. No changes needed.
