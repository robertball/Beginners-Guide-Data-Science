Be careful with the basil, too much and the taste changes dramatically.

I like this, but the family was not a huge fan.  I make a similar dip with bacon (and real tomatoes) and it reminded me of that dip, so I kept expecting bacon.  I love the fresh basil taste.

This was a hit in my house.  I pur√©ed the sun dried tomatoes to get a smooth consistency and used dry basil.  As I filled the dish for the second time I realized I had forgotten the lemon juice so I added a bit.  It helped cut the richness but it was fine without it. Thanks, Terry!

I added more basil and lemon juice, and left out the sun dried tomatoes. It was a BIG hit with veggies.

Made it..ate it...loved it! I used Italian Herbs Crackers with it and made it to snack on for Thanksgiving. week while working on the heavy hitters...So quick...So easy. Recommend you put the Sun Dried Tomatoes and the Basil in the food processor together...so much faster & easier!

I used this as a sandwich spread like another reviewer suggested.  I cooked some seasoned chicken breast and sliced it.  Then I pan toasted some sourdough, put the chicken on it with sliced of provolone.  Then added lettuce and onion with the spread and yum yum.

I made this yesterday for a snack dip. I mixed up 1/3 of the recipe and got about 1/2 cup of dip. After I made it, I realized I forgot the lemon juice. However, it tasted fine. For the fresh basil I used 1 tsp. of dried as a subtitute. I used lite mayo and sour cream with no problems. I wasn't sure what would be good to dip with. I used some pretzels and that was tasty. The dip looked somewhat like the classic vegetable dips but had a very slight pizza after taste with pretzels.

This is so good! I spread it on panini sandwiches with grilled chicken & provolone cheese! Yummy! Mixed it all in my mini food processor. We also didn't let it sit for an hour. We served it right away & it was awesome!
