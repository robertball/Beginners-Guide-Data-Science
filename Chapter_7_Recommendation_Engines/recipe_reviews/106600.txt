We really like this recipe. Our first try, we did not like all of the sausage because it didnt taste like a hamburger at all, you could only taste sausage. But if you modify the sausage content from 1 roll to only half a roll it is a lot better.

We tried this recipe for summer entertaining, and everyone really liked the burgers.  I think it's difficult to get 8 patties out of this recipe, so I'd say it actually yields about 6 burgers (we like ours bigger).

This was a good burger...very different twist on the regular hamburger. I took advise from other reviewers and used half the sausage. My husband thought it was great. We will definitely use this recipe for our next cook out...next time i will use a little more worcestershire sauce and a pinch of salt.

Great burgers, even better if you cut back the sausage by at least half.

I knew I would like these, becuz even though it has been a long time, years even, since I have fixed sausage on a sandwich (w/mayo) I enjoy that, so I knew I would enjoy this burger.  My hamburger was a 1.5 lb package and the sausage was a 1 lb.  I thought the ratio was perfect.  This was a very moist burger.  You could add this or that if you wanted, but it really doesnt need it.  I was able to get 8 medium size burgers.  Fit just about right on the bun.  I didnt grill them though.  I meant to use the NuWave and forgot, it was just habit I guess to heat a pan on the stove so that is how I fixed them.  I will definitely make these again.

Not bad at all.  I had never tried sausage in my burger before.  The next time I make however I may use a little under the full pound of sausage.  But still, was a rather good burger.

I orginally thought that the addition of sausage would add a nice kick. We did not care for these at all and we will not be making this again.

Our family loved these burgers.  We decided to broil them rather than grill, and they turned out so juicy and yummy.  Was able to get 7 burgers out of this.
