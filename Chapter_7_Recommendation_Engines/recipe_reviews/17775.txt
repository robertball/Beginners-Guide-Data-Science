This cake is excellent.  It's rich, moist and intensely chocolate.  I tweaked the recipe slightly and used 2 cups of mini chips in the batter instead of the regular chocolate chips, substituted 1/2 cup Kahlua for the water, and used a BC Chocolate Fudge cake mix instead of Devil's Food.  As most reviewers discovered, it takes about an hour to bake and as a matter of fact, I think mine took longer.  I made a Chocolate Kahlua Glaze instead of the one in the recipe.

Absolutely wonderful.  I have made this cake 3 times already, and every CRUMB is eaten.  I don't even bother with the frosting. I've found it makes it too rich for me.  A little powdered sugar sprinkled on the top is perfect! Very,very moist and delicious.

This is one FANTASTIC recipe!  I made this yesterday for a friend's dinner party and it was a huge hit.  I took the advice of previous reviewers and cooked it for one hour.  After one look at that horrendous nutritional table (not for the faint hearted) I used low fat milk and sour cream in an attempt to reduce the fat content.  I filled the centre of the bundt with whole strawberries, then drizzled the glaze over both the cake and the strawberries.  I served it with vanilla ice-cream, and it was heaven!  I chilled it in the fridge for a few hours, which resulted in a sort of dense, but fudgey cake.  Onto the treadmill for me today!

I wasn't a big fan of this. It is a fairly average, pudding enhanced doctored cake mix but even at that, certainly not the best I've ever tried.  Dare I say that it was TOO rich, too heavy and dense? It was just overkill.  Also, as others have noted, the baking time is not within the range of being accurate.  As written, if you're using the pan as directed, you'll find you need to bake this at least an hour, if not 75 minutes.  If I had to do this all over, I would have eliminated the chocolate chips in the batter, or maybe used half the amount in miniature chocolate chips.

Could chocolate cake actually be TOO rich? If so this is it. Extremely moist. Make sure you use a large bundt pan, mine overflowed.

Incredibly moist!  Everyone loved this!  The only problem I had was that I had too much batter for my bundt pan and I filled it so full that it flowed over and burned on the oven.  I will dump out excess batter next time so that my house doesn't smell of burned cake....

very easy and good. I used mini chips, chocolate milk instead of white and lite sour cream. I baked for about 55 min. I thought it was going to overflow but it didn't. I used non-stick aluminum foil on top for the last few minutes of baking to prevent the top from getting too hard and brown. I topped with Chocolate Glaze from this site.Excellent cake. Thanks Jackie

This one is decadnet.  No one would know it was so easy to make.  It is soooo moist.  I used german choc. cake mix and chocolate chips (in mix and for frosting) to keep it from being too rich and chocolatey.  It was great this way too.

This was AMAZING! I turned it into Black Forest Cake for my best friends Birthday. Only change I made was that I used mini choc chips.
I made it in 2 round cake pans and made sure I cooked it so it was alllmost cooked, but just a little gooey still. I let it cool completely and cut each round in half so that I had 4 round flat chunks. I put a can of Cherry Pie Filling between the top layers, and one between the bottom layers, and a layer of whipping cream in the middle layer. I iced it in whipping cream and dusted it with coco powder and let it set in the fridge for about 6 hours before serving it. It was TO DIE FOR!

I made this into cupcakes.  It yielded about 27 cupcakes that I baked for 22-25 minutes depending on size.  I did not use the glaze.  Serve them warm with some ice cream...the chocolate chips melt and it's SO good!  I also used 3 oz sour cream, and 13 oz milk as that's what I had on hand.  They were light and airy and delicious!  I didn't ice them, but if I did I was thinking a whipped cream or cream cheese icing would be good.

After reading other reviews I only added one cup of mini semi-sweet chips. 
I baked it in two 8"rounds and it turned out great.  Don't try to use this cake for a fondant covered cake though, I tried it and the cake can't support the weight of the fondant.  It still tasted great though.

I thought this cake was fabulous!  I made it in a 13 x 9 inch pan with a buttercream/whipping cream frosting.  It is so moist and delicious!  I don't think anyone would know it was a mix!

I made baby bundt cakes with this recipe and they were a huge holiday hit both at home and at work.  Easy to make and tastes great.  Cooking time for baby bundt cakes is much shorter, makes 12.

OH MY GAWD!  This has got to be the BEST CHOCOLATE CAKE EVER!  I can't believe how great this turned out...holy moly!  Only some slight mods: I used fat free sour cream &  ff milk, I used chocolate fudge pudding mix, & I baked for 60 minutes.  Try this, you will not be disappointed!  Thanks a million for the recipe!  Yum yum!

Wow Jackie, this cake was incredible! I made this for a 4th of July party and everyone, young and old raved! I used mini chips, but other than that I kept it as is. I think this cake would be equally as good using powdered sugar in lieu of the glaze. Either way, it's easy, quick, fudgy  extremely moist and definitely worth every last calorie! Thanks so much Jackie!

Definitely one of the better chocolate cakes I ever made.  Extremely moist, dense and flavorful.  I only added 1 cup of choc. chips to the mix because others complained of the cake needing more baking time; 1 cup was plenty. I stuck with the 50 minute bake time too.  For the glaze I used 'Satiny Choc. Glaze' from this site since I have used before and loved, and it requires only 3 T of butter, not 6 like this recipe. I subbed low fat sour cream too.  Just some little tweaks in attempt to curb the monstrous fat and calories in this awesome cake.

This is the best cake I have ever made...ever.  And SO easy.  I almost felt guilty about how much people were raving about this super easy cake at a recent family gathering and everyone else's dessert was ignored.  Try serving with vanilla ice cream.

WOW! Moist,rich, chocolately and EASY. This is a fantastic cake.I just took it to a church dessert buffet where it received rave reviews. I've made it several times for different functions and get the same great comments from everyone who tries it.Sometimes I use strong coffee in place of the water and add 1t vanilla and other times I use whiskey in place of the water. These additions seem to "enhance" the flavor.....AS IF IT REALLY NEEDS ANY ENHANCING. ;O) Wonderful treat!Thanks Jackie.

There are many variations of this recipe, and they are all good. This one is buttery, rich, and delicious. No need for the icing. Great served with a bit of unsweetened whipped cream.

Definatly USE flour to coat the pan after spraying with baking spray. I skipped this step, and am now kicking myself in the rear as part of the cake got stuck. I was luckily able to try to camoflauge this with the drizzle and candles, but still not my finest hour. It is very moist, and I followed (like most) and used the light sour cream, and 2% milk instead. I also used Choc fudge cake instead of devils food. She is a chocoholic! I can't wait to try a peice tonight.

I didn't have any cake pans to make this in, so I just made them into muffins. They turned out great! You can't taste the sour cream, it was really moist, and my co-workers whom I've shared them with said the chocolate chips inside the muffins reminded them of the candy Gushers - the chocolate just bursts in your mouth after taking a bite.

This is always a crowd favorite at my house. However, I always have to cook it about 15-20 min. longer than the recipe states. It is always moist and tasty. You do have to be careful when flipping it out of the pan. It is so moist it tends to be heavy and falls out in pieces. Nothing icing won't fix!

I modified the recipe a tad to lower the calorie count and fat content.  I used a Betty Crocker fudge cake mix and the 4 eggs, but used Fat Free Milk, applesauce for the oil, fat free sour cream.  I also used those new plastic molds for the mini bundt pans (30 minutes @ 350 degrees).  The recipe is perfect. My daughter was thrilled when she realized the glaze hardens like "shell" on her icecream - which will become a staple in our house since it costs $3.00 a bottle). Modified recipe resulted in 32 mini bundts with 240 calories, 11 fat grams, 5 Sat. fat, 218 sodium, 27 cholesterol, 13 potassium, 32 carbs, 23 sugars, 2 protein, 4 calcium, 5 Iron, 2 vit a.

OK PEOPLE!!! My God, this cake is wonderful!  Thank you Jackie for sharing this recipe with us.  I wanted to make a birthday cake that would satisfy a major chocolate connoisseur, and boy, did this cake get rave reviews.  It is perfectly moist and one of the best parts is finding the chocolate chips still softened into smaller morsels inside.  What more can one ask for but more chocolate on chocolate?  Wait...there is more!  This cake is best refridgerated as it hardens the chocolate coating it gets from the chocolate icing.  Also, make sure to use gourmet dark chocolate chips, there is a difference.  Lastly, for variation also try adding Heath Butter Toffee Chips, coffee, or mint tea to the recipe.  This cake is so good, heck, I'm making one for my own birthday.  Thanks again Jackie!

This cake was incredible.  I was afraid my bundt pan was too small; however, so I baked this cake in a 9-x-13 pan for about 35-40 minutes with excellent results.  Also, I frosted cake with "Cool Whipped Frosting" from shirley on this site instead of the glaze.  Stored in fridge; easy to transport; it was fabulous.  I used Devils Food Flavor pudding.  You could pour glaze on, allow to dry, and then top with Cool Whipped Frosting and I bet that would be phenomenal.  Next time I will use mini chocolate chips instead of regular sized ones.

This cake was incredible. I took it to a party and was beseiged by recipe requests. I used another reviewers advice about using coffee instead of water. Next time I'll try the whiskey. I left out the chips. Sometimes you can get just too much chocolate.

A very moist and delicious cake.  I used cake mix with a syrup packet and melted green chocolate for the icing and sprinkled with miniature green four-leaf clovers in honor of St. Patrick.

Breathtaking! I made extra glaze so I cut back in the amount of chocolate chips that went into the cake batter. I also didn't have chocolate pudding but I had vanilla. I can't imagine it with chocolate. I think it would be too much chocolate. This was ABSOLUTELY fantastic!

My daughter wanted a chocolate cake for her birthday. Came across this recipe and thought I would give it a shot. Wow! Chocolate is what she wanted, chocolate is what she got! Very rich, very moist, very good! I thought about adding a few walnuts but thought I'd try it as it first. Next time I will be adding a few nuts to give it an even more "fudgey" taste.

This cake is super dooper good! I made a 2-layer cake with 8"baking rounds and it came out pretty good. I used semi sweet MINI chocolate chips in the batter instead of the regular sized ones. And in place of the glaze this recipe called for, I made a whipped chocolate ganache for the filling. I chilled the cake in the fridge and served it cold. It is really sooo good! I was so happy with it. And the ganache was a great filling for it. I used heavy whipping cream and 62% bittersweet chocolate to make that--in case you wanted to know. The cake is sooo moist and really has that "homemade" cake taste. Restaurant quality, really.

I can't rightfully eat this much fat in one sitting, hence I modified the recipe as much as I could to lower the fat content. I used applesauce in place of the oil, egg beaters in place of the whole eggs, 1% milk and fat free sour cream.  I did not make an chocolate glaze because this cake still tasted so decadent!!!!! SINFUL!!!!!

When I read the recipe, it sounded really good.  I'm not a fan of box cakes, so I usually bake from scratch. I made an exception with this cake, and now I know again why I'm not a fan of box cakes.  Despite the added ingredients, the cake came out tasting very artificial, like a typical box cake.  And I think the pudding made it even worse, added a few more chemicals. Maybe next time, I'll try to bake a from-scratch chocolate cake along the idea of this one.  But as this recipes stands, I threw away the cake.  Maybe good for people who are used to using processed ingredients, but definitely not for from-scratch bakers.  Sorry.

I used dark chocolate cake (my cake had pudding in the mix so I left that out)  and full sized chocolate chips.   Also, instead of water I used coffee. Next time, if I use chocolate chips they will be the mini ones, the big ones were just too much for me.   I want to try kahlua too! I will make again.

This cake is okay, but I am ticked because the cook time was waaaaayyyyy off & caused me to be very late to the event I was taking it to.  Also, it started to get slightly browned on the outside & was still pratially jiggly in the middle; though I did use a bundt pan as specified and cooked it at 350.  Due to this fact, I removed it from the oven (hoping it was done for the most part) and the whole thing fell apart into a huge blob.  Meh.  :(  On a positive note, it tasted pretty good, but I am still pretty bitter over the ordeal...

This was a funky texture, so unusual that I can't tell if I liked it. I love cake so i hate to say I didn't like it but it was very dense. I don't think I'll make it again. My picture is a photo of this cake. It looked great. Thanks for the recipe, It wasn't bad just not my favorite.

Took this to a Christmas party last night to rave reviews.  It's a quick and easy cake to put together.  However, like another reviewer, I found that it did have that artificial boxed cake taste.  But, I think it's because I've gotten used to making cakes from scratch (allergies) so I noticed it more.  I did add 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of cinnamon and liked the flavour that added.  Served it with vanilla bean whipped cream.

My hubby went nuts for this cake heated up and topped with vanilla ice cream!
I used low fat sour cream, fat & sugar free chocolate pudding, applesauce for the oil, fat free milk and egg beaters and it was the best thing ever! Didn't even glaze it, just sifted a touch of powered sugar on top. Will use this recipe again and again! Thanks!!

Excellent! Didn't read the reviews prior to making, so could have used the advice on not using the devil's food cake w/pudding mix (but that's all the store had!). I should have left out the instant pudding. Otherwise, very tasty and chocolatey cake. Hubby and I found that it tasted better the next day after it had been in the fridge - it was yummy cold and moist!

SO MANY GREAT REVIEWS! I REALLY HAD A FLOP ON MY HANDS! The cake did not bake in 55 minutes! It did not come out of the pan, it is just a pile of goo! I am a chocoholic and this is too much for my taste! There are quite a few of the same recipes on this site...a couple of them have less chocolate chips... i will try that.One of the other recipes also has you bake the cake for 60 minutes...IT IS A MYSTERY.....

This is an excellent cake. And easy, too!! It's very moist and great for chocolate lovers.  It is a pudding cake, so be careful not to overcook.  I baked the first one too long because I was waiting for the toothpick to come out clean and it won't.  It's supposed to be really moist!!

I made this cake for my Dad who is a chocolate lover!  He loved it, along with everyone else.  The only change I made was that I used light sour cream.  I couldn't believe how easy this was to put together.  We served this with vanilla ice cream and it was perfect!  Thank you Jackie for sharing.

This cake is absolutely delicious!  I have made it twice now and definitely will be making it again.  I have never made the glaze because I found the cake perfect without it.

Very rich, moist, flavorful cake.  I reduced glaze recipe by half, and I'm glad I did.  Didn't need that much extra sweetness.  Easy, easy, preparation.

I have made a similar cake several times and used this recipe by mistake once.  It was terrible, there is way too much liquid in this cake.  It took way too long to cook and was wet like bread pudding inside.

Amazing cake! I have made this several times and everyone loves it, even the ones that dont normally like cake!!!--- I tweak this recipe a little and use 2 blocks of the bakers semi sweet chocolate instead of the semi sweet chocolate chips. I chunk it up and add it in. I also use two 9 inch rounds instead of a bundt pan. 350 degrees for about 30-35 minutes *dont over cook* For the frosting I use... a small tub of cool whip and the remaining 6 blocks of the semi sweet bakers chocolate *melted together in the microwave for 1 minutes and then cooled* It is so rich, dense, and chocolately!! Even better when the cake is kept chilled in the fridge!

Just finished baking this cake.  After it cooled I had to taste it!!  It's moist and rose up almost to the top of my 10" angel food pan.  Bakers beware! a 10" bundt pan is not deep enough for this cake.  I had to omit the choc. chips from the cake as I had only enough for the glaze.  I put 1/2 cup of nuts in it instead.  It was still a very good cake, but the flavor is only as good as the cake mix and the pudding mix - buy the best.  I forgot to say it took 55 minutes to bake and the last 10 minutes I turned the oven back to 325 so it wouldn't burn.  The cake was getting brown around the edges at 45 minutes but still jiggled in the center.

i made cupcakes with this recipe and they turned out great! i baked them for 20 minutes and they came out just right. i thought they were a little runny right after i took them out of the oven, but i think that was just the 'pudding' part of the cake. it set up fine and gained consistency as it cooled off. very yummy and moist!

If you want dense, rich, heavenly chocolate- this is it.  For half of the pudding mix we used banana creme- and it was really yummy!

I agree with the one reviewer who said it still tastes like a box cake . . . it kinda does.  But, i had a box cake and wanted to make something fun with it . . . i'm not sure I couldnt have done better without the mixes tho.  If you usually cook with mixes, you'll probably like it.  If you generally avoid boxes and cans, its just ok.

Made this for Valentine's Day and it was gone in less than a day.  Made a few changes though.  Used sugar-free pudding mix, low-fat buttermilk, applesauce in place of oil, and white chocolate chips in batter.  Also, made these into cup cakes.  Yielded about 2 and a half dozen cup cakes and baked for only 20 minutes.  For the topping used white and semi-sweet chocolate chips drizzled on top.  Great presentation!

This cake is quite yummy (I made it for my boss's birthday and several people asked for the recipe), but don't put it in a really detailed bundt pan as all the chocolate chips went to the bottom.  When I made it in a plain bundt pan it came out fine (grease really really well with Crisco and flour).  But when I put it in my new castle bundt pan with lots of detail, the top wouldn't come out of the pan because of all the chocolate chips.  I even tried dusting the chips with flour and they still sunk to the bottom.  So great on taste, but not so much on removal from pan.

DELICIOUS!  I sprayed Pam in my bundt pan and the cake slid right out.  I also didn't use all the batter. I poured it to where there was about an inch and a half left in the pan to give the cake room to rise.  I put the rest of the batter in cupcakes. It was DELICIOUS...sprinkle it with tons of powdered sugar right before serving.  Make SURE you get cake mix that doesn't already have pudding in the mix. Another good suggestion is to serve it warm with ice cream. Yum yum!  Soooo easy, and sooo delicious! I"m a teacher, and it got rave reviews at a staff party! Ally

OMG, this is a Chocaholic's dream!  I have made this twice, both to rave reviews. I slice it and freeze leftovers, take out what I need, nuke it for a few seconds and top with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream. Tastes like I slaved all day.
Thank you.

To let EVERYONE out there be clear about this recipe.....  I bake a lot and like to try new recipes.  I tried this one during the summer for a large group of family and it was a HUGE hit.  There was not a person that did not love it.  It is rich so you need to eat it in small portions.  The chocolate chips are a great addition.  I served it hot, if not straight out of the oven, with vanilla bean ice cream.  I have made it a few times since, by request, and people cannot believe that it is not store-bought.  Advice: if you fill your pan too much it will overflow, so make sure you place a cookie tray underneath while baking.  It makes the clean-up and the worry of this turning out perfect as simple as ..... pie (or should we say cake?).

I made this for my husband's birthday. He loved it. But he said he'd give it four stars because it needs more frosting. This is a guy, though, that if you cut him open you wouldn't find internal organs you'd find chunks of chocolate where internal organs should be. This is very, very, very rich. It also had to cook longer than the recipe stated. Overall, it was a very good cake.

This recipe was awesome!  My boyfriend is a total chocoholic so I doubled the glaze and covered every inch of the cake with it and he LOVED it!  I will absolutely make this again and again. It was so easy, yet impressive at the same time.

This recipe is fantastic.  I bake part time for my brother-in-laws restaurant and the customers go nuts for it.  We use individual bundt pans and serve them warm with sliced strawberries and whipped cream.

Wonderful! Very rich and creamy.  Next time I will cut the glaze by 1/2 (too sweet).  This receipe is very easy to follow.  All my friends want the receipe but I am reluctant to give it away!

This cake recipe was awesome!! And so easy!  I made it for my husbands birthday and he loved it (and he's not a big sweets person).  The cake was so moist and stayed moist until it was all gone!

The only change I made was that I only made half of the amount of glaze. It was stilll enough for the whole cake without overdoing it.  You must try this recipe for yourself!!

I make this all the time and thought I would share some advice from experimenting with the recipe.  One tip is to make the day before serving.  We have found that the flavour is enhanced. Also, I have found that the results are better when I use name-brand cake mixes and puddings as opposed to the discount variety.  Do NOT use low-fat sour cream, which contains gelatin. You can also use Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream.  As for serving, try a raspberry or mango purée to pour on the plate when serving each slice.

I don't want to be the "Debbie downer" of the group, but this cake was kind of horrible. I made a devils food cake from scratch a couple of weeks ago, to which I added a box of pudding mix, and it turned out fantastically moist, rich, and chocolate-y. This one, however, turned out with a reddish/orangish/brown color, it settled in a freakish way, with a strip of gross pudding as the middle- and it literally has NO chocolate taste to it what-so-ever. I have no idea how that happened, since I didn't stray from this recipe at all, aside from cooking it longer. This cake seriously disappointed me with how horribly it turned out. Next time, I'll just take the extra time and energy to make the cake from scratch- at least I won't be wasting ingredients.

I made this for a chocolate lover and thought it would be perfect.  I loved the moistness/texture, but it was really way too rich for even the chocolate lover.  Since it was such a great texture, I think I'll try to change it up a little.  Maybe no chocolate chips and vanilla pudding.

I used a Pilsbury Moist supreme cake mix, used 1/2 cup of veg oil and a 1/4 cup of Apple sauce.  Pleased that I tried this recipe as my family love chocolate cake, but this one just didn't wow us.  In fact it tasted too much like a standard box chocolate cake with a few chocolate chips thrown in...  NOTE ~ I made two batches of this mixture, for the cupcakes I baked at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.

Excellent, moist chocolate cake!  I have made it twice in the last week.  The only thing that was different from the original recipe was that I used Dark Chocolate Fudge cake mix instead of devil's food because we prefer dark chocolate in our house!  Other than that, followed the recipe to a "T".   The first time I made it in a 9 x 13 pan and it took about 50 minutes to bake.  It was close to dripping over the side of the pan while baking so it might not be a bad idea to place something underneath it to catch drips...just in case.  The second time I made it in a bundt pan and it took an hour.  Came out great both times!    Didn't do the icing...there's definitely enough chocolate goodness without it and I'm a chocoholic to the core!!!  Just sprinkled the top with a little powdered sugar.

This is an awesome cake.  Each time I make this it's always a hit.  This chocolate cake is perfect as originally written.  This is my husbands favorite and so easy that he made it for my birthday.  He is not a baker.   Now, I have tried peanut butter chips(instead of choc chips) once and I don't recommend it.  However, mint choc chips are a good variation around holidays.   Just recently, I used this recipe to make a white cake, only changing the choc cake mix and choco pudding mix to white cake mix and vanilla pudding and just omitting the chocolate chips.  This makes for a very moist white cake two layered cake which I iced with buttercream icing.  It was also a hit.

my mom has made a cake like this for years and she misplaced her original recipe. we have tried a handful of recipes in hopes to find one similar, and this is pretty close to the original.  delicious! i have already made it three times! i did find that it took a lot longer to bake (til the toothpick came out clean) i also did not have chocolate pudding so i used vanilla (couldnt tell the difference)

This tasted great and is a great way to seriously improve on a store bought cake mix.  I used Pam to spray the bundt pan and  must have missed a section because about 1/4 of the cake stuck. Rather than try to fix it using frosting, I clean cut the 3/4 that came out well and made it pretty with the glaze.  With the 1/4 that stuck, I made cake cups for the kids.  This was a Christmas Eve dessert, so I put a scoop of the cake in the bottom of a Christmas designed platstic cup. Then I added a spoonful of whipped cream, then a spoonful of cake, then whipped cream & topped with a little glaze.  The kids really liked the cups and I didn't waste any of the yummy cake.

Very delicious! I couldn't find devils cake food mix in the Netherlands so I used a regular kinda chocolate pound-cake mix. I added vanilla and instead of water I added a mix of port and raspberry preserves. I also had to break a cocoa bar into pieces because of a lack of chips. It turnout Mmmm, although I keep thinking it would be better to have used devils food cake mix. I'd do it again soon!

Perhaps the bundt pan I own is smaller than recommended...I really don't know what size I have but it seems like a regular one to me.  The cake did not bake completely even though I baked it ten extra minutes.  I have a convection oven, so it bakes at a lower temperature but the circulation fan is so supposed to compensate for the temperature.  I inserted a toothpick into the center and it came out clean except for the very tip...I figured I inserted it to the bottom and waited another 3 minutes and took it out...a small pile of cake was deposited on the bottom of my oven...I quickly cleaned the oven while it was still hot.  The cake slowly deflated into a sunken mass...even so, I waited 15 minutes and determined to have my chocolate fix turned it over onto my cooling rack...what a mess emerged oozing onto my stove and counter...it almost looks like an unfinished brownie that tastes like cakemix...my recommendation is make sure your pan can accommodate this cake when its finished baking or use a 9x13 glass pan...that way you can be sure your cake is really done...bundt cakes are hard to bake through because of the density and you cant be sure if the cake is done until its too late to do anything about it.

Really easy recipe. I used the butter flavor chocolate cake mix because it was on sale and it was delicious. Even without the glaze this is a simple and moist cake. Cook for the full time indicated and add a couple of tablespoons flour for high-altitudes. I floured my bundt pant with hot chocolate so it would not look like flour on the outside of the cake.

Heed my warning: only cook this in a bundt pan and not in traditional round cake pans....I thought I could make this in round pans, and it was a HUGE mistake. That was lesson 1. Lesson 2: use a huge bundt pan. I used what I had, and who knows if it was 10 cups or not. But the cake was falling over the middle when it was baking, and then when I pulled it out, it shrank down so much, I couldn't believe it.  Also, the recipe doesn't say on what SPEED to mix at for 4 minutes, so I did it at medium. I left out the chocolate chips and sprinkled w/ pwd. sugar at the end. With all these things being said, it was quite tasty and very very moist. My sister in law said she was going to call me the "new martha stewart" after tasting this. Try it, it really is good.

Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo yummy! The only thing I would do differently next time is to use MINI chocolate chips in the batter. My guests devoured it! My mother-in-law kept commenting on the delicious glaze. Perhaps next time I'll omit the chocolate chips from the batter and just cover the cake in the glaze, instead. Definitely a keeper!

Ok, well first off let me say I used a 9x13 pan.  I cooked it 45 minutes until a toothpick was clean. I cooled it and then went to put it onto a wire rack and the whole cake fell apart into this gooey mess.  What a disaster. It tastes pretty good, but boy did it make a mess!!

This recipie has been around quite a long time with slightly different variations.  I suggest adding some toasted almonds or walnuts. Another nice touch is to add a couple of tbsp. of almond extract and/or flavoured liquor such as Tia Maria to the wet ingredients as well as a touch to the chocolate glaze. Many commented that the cake was indeed dense and rich.  A cup of chocolate chips is quite enough is more than enough.

Fantastic Cake!! Made for party but afraid was too soft and that I'd messed up.  Took to school the next day to share with office and raves began.  Someone even requested another cake for our Thanksgiving luncheon the next day.  Will cook a little bit longer but change nothing else. Yummy!!!!

Excellent! Moist and delicious...Very easy to make. We couldn't keep our hands off it. My family and I agree that it was better the day after baking. I will make sure to keep the ingredients on hand. A definate keeper. Update 10/2003... My son 18yo son requested this as his birthday cake this year. He is just mad about it!

This is awesome!!  I've made it 3 times using a regular tube pan instead of a bundt pan, and I've also used chocolate chunks instead of chips. It has been a big hit all around. Very easy to make, with ingredients most of us have on hand.  Definitely a keeper.

Everyone loved this recipe & I even messed it up (on accident!) by putting in a larger box of instant pudding than the recipe called for!  I was worried that it was not going to turn out, but it still did.  Next time I'll follow the recipe exactly and I have a feeling there will be alot of requests for this one.

When it comes to chocolate this recipe takes the cake! Very moist, very chocolately, the best I,ve ever experienced. The glaze can be omitted and the results still outstanding.

Fabulous and this recipe is SO flexible, try--Vanilla cake mix with vanilla pudding and chocolate chips (with chocolate sauce); Chocolate cake mix, chocolate pudding and pecans (with caramel sauce); Vanilla cake mix with banana pudding (with whipped cream and banana slices); endless possibilities!!

this was really good.  Only a few changes not by choice, the box of cake mix I had was I believe only 16.5 oz, and I didn't have enough sour cream, probably only about 7/8 cup.  By choice I omitted the chocolate chips.  And instead of using the glaze recipe given here, I made a ganache topping and poured it over the cake.  Still very good cake.

Very frustrating! They don't make 18.25 packages any more. They are 15.25 now. So, I got out the chemistry set and with 2 boxes of cake mix,  a scale, I mixed up my cake.  I'm curious if anyone made this with the new 15.25 boxes.

Couldn't give it five stars cuz it's still in the oven! But I'm waiting with baited breath! Of course, I "tweaked" the recipe also. I aded Spearmint Schnapps for part of the liquid, mint chocolate chips, and a chocolate pudding. Over-kill you say? Huuuum ... I'll let you know!!!

This cake is amazingly delicious, but it deflated... I made cupcakes and regular cakes with the recipe, and every single time I have cooked it past the recommended time, and it still deflates. I have no Idea what I am doing wrong. I will continue to eat it because the taste is perfect, but it makes for an ugly decorated cake :-(

Loved it! I did bake it 50 minutes, and the top bit of the cake stuck in the pan and had tons of chocolate chips in it, so maybe it wasn't quite long enough, but it was incredibly moist and went perfectly with vanilla ice cream!

I made this cake for my husbands birthday and he loved it. It is very moist and almost brownie like. The only substitution I made was to use milk chocolate chips rather than semi-sweet because I prefer milk chocolate.

Wow, This was great. Light and easy to make. I only added 3 eggs and a little Flax. The choc. chips are good and it doesn't weigh the cake. I you are having a chocolate attack try this recipe. It's also nice if you slice it up you can bring it to a potluck because it's not full of frosting.

I just made this last night and it was very good! I didn't make the glaze though b/c I didn't have enough chocolate chips. I just sprinkled powdered sugar over the top. I did only use a little over a cup of mini chocolate chips and I must say I wish I would've used the whole bag!! But very good!

This is my husbands absolute FAVORITE dessert.  I have learned to make it in the mini-bundt molds to help with his "serving size".  It goes FAST and it is wonderful chilled. Yum, yum, yum.

Yummy and very very chocolaty.  Reduced amount of chocolate chips and didn't make the glaze as it was so rich without it, I felt it didn't need it.  Mine needed to be baked a bit longer than it stated.  Nice treat and very easy!

This cake is awesome!!!!  My co-workers ate it up like there was no tomorrow!  I did leave out the glaze as I read a lot of reviews saying it was "too chocolatey" (as if that was possible...) it didn't even need a glase!  It was moist and delicious.  I didn't use mini chocolate chips b/c I like to bite into the actual chip.  Kudos to whomevers recipe this is!

The entire family loved this cake!  It is by far the best chocolate cake I have ever made.  The only recommendation I have is to reserve this one for larger gatherings.  It is incredibly rich and my family of four could not put it away before it hardened up and we had to waste about 30% of it.  Small slices are in order unless you have an insane tolerance for chocolate.

Every member of my family agrees that this is a five star cake.  The only change I made was with the chocolate chips- I omitted them from the batter but did use half a bag for the glaze.  This beats the pants off of any other chocolate cake I've ever had.

Excellent recipe!  Very rich, like a brownie.  If you don't love semi-sweet chocolate, use your favorite kind of chips.  I made this exactly as directed and got rave reviews.  Not to mention, it was a BEAUTIFUL cake - like out of a magazine.  I wish I had remembered to take a pic to post!

This recipe is delicious! So easy and so moist! It makes a lot though, keep an eye in it in the oven to make sure it does not spill over as it bakes.

Very very good.  I loved it while still hot. I didnt have enough choc chips for the topping so I just used regular choc icing. Almost too much chocolate but just perfect!

I’ve made this cake several times.  It is very dense, rich and decadent.  The only changes that I made is substitute half of the semi-sweet chocolate ships for dark chocolate.

Sooooo good!! I had devils food mix and vanilla instant pudding. I think chocolate pudding might have put it over the edge (for me). I used one cup of semi-sweet choc. chips, I think I'll leave them out next time-or use a grated high quality chocolate. There will definitly be a next time! Can't wait to try other combinations of pudding/cake mix. 
I almost went with a similiar recipe from this site that calls for one cup oil. I'm glad I chose this one. Very moist, easy, delicious!

This cake was rich,moist and soooo chocolatey! And the presentation looked like a decadent dessert from a bakery.
I used a 1/2 cup of milk chocolate chips and 1/2 cup semi-sweet for the glaze. I think next time I'll try dusting the cake with powdered sugar instead of the chocolate for a change. Serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Yum-O!!

This cake was totally easy to make and absolutely delicious.  It was extremely rich, and I used fat free sour cream and skim milk!  I skipped the frosting - I am a  chocoholic/sugar fiend, but this cake was enough without the frosting, even for me!

This does take a little over an hour to bake. I wish I had known that before I made it but it still turned out perfectly and was the hit of the party. Very easy to make and so tasty. It was also a very pretty cake with the glaze on it. My mother thought it came from a bakery!

This is an excellent cake. Instead of Devil's Food, I used a chocolate fudge cake mix. The cake was super moist and full of chocolate! It did need about 8 more minutes of cooking time, but that was probably because I bought a super moist cake mix. Although it's great as is with the glaze, for the major chocolate cake lover I would probably make it with a thicker chocolate icing or frosting.

This recipe was ok. I was expecting it to taste like a cake but to me and my family it tasted like a chocolate muffin.. I was too happy with it.. and the glaze was a bit on the salty side.. I recommend using salt free butter. Oh and it took alot longer than 50 mins in my oven and I have a pretty decent oven.

This cake was really easy to make, and very good. I don't have a bundt pan, so I made it in two round pans for a layer cake. The one thing that I didn't like were the chocolate chips mixed into the batter. They seemed like they had been over heated and taken on that grainy burnt-chocolate texture. Next time I think I'll leave them out of the cake, and perhaps mix in some chopped nuts instead. I made the chocolate-butter glaze and used it as a filling between the layers and drizzled over the top as well. Next time I'll make more glaze and entirely cover the top and sides of the cake. The glaze hardens to a very nice finish. I served the cake with fresh whipped cream and raspberries, which were a nice complement to the rich chocolate.

Overall, this was a good cake.  I cut up strawberries and piled them in the "hole" and also around the edges of the cake plate and it looked really pretty! Got rave reviews from my co-workers!  While I did like it though, I've tried a lot of recipes and I'd say that I still like Lisa's Chocolate Chocolate Chip cake best.  That one is amazing!  The texture of this cake is slightly spongier (for lack of a better word).  Lisa's Chocolate Chocolate Chip is more of a firm, slightly more solid or dense cake.

I was looking up chocolate recipes & realized I had made this using a recipe by a different name -- but my friends absolutely raved about it!  The only difference was that the liquids I used were 1/2 c. each of oil, flavored coffee, and milk.  But absolutely delicious!

This turned out to be a favorite!  It's so wonderful it deserves a more creative name, I think!  I do agree it needs more than 40-50 minutes to bake (at least in my oven) and definitely the larger Bundt pan.  It did not spill over in my case but came all the way to the top.  The results were terrific!

Excellent recipe.  I used bakers chocolate chunks instead of the chips but it was devoured within a half an hour from the first cut.

I'm NOT a chocolate cake fan. But I loved this one! I tested it today to see if it would be good to make for a baby shower I'm in charge of this weekend. It will definitely be a part of the menu now! Having been warned about too much batter, I set aside enough to make 4 cupcakes, and it was perfect- no dripping over the edge. It baked for about 50 minutes, only because I turned the oven to 325 at about 30 minutes. It came out beautifully- I used the Pam spray with flour and it was perfect, very easy to get out. I did wait about 25 minutes before taking it out, though. Thanks for the great recipe!

WOW! I followed the recipe exactly and was not disappointed. This was very easy to make and the result was nothing less than gourmet. This is the best cake I've made. My family couldn't get enough of it!!!

It is really good- but make sure that you are using a good pan. I have what I thought was a good bundt pan but 1/2 of the cake came out and the other did not. If you question your pan make it in a loaf pan or pan that you can just scoop out the cake. It is VERY VERY moist and dense. Yummy- and although mine is currently being scooped out of its pan- it still tastes good although looks horrible...

I've been baking for 40 years so I'm not a beginner. This cake was a disaster. I read all the reviews and I see that only a few had a bad thing to say. Maybe it's me but I thought that two cups of chips in the batter was too much and maybe that is why I thought the cake was not done. I ended up baking it for 70 minutes and so the top was hard and it still appeared not to be done. Also it stuck to the pan, yes I greased and floured it, what a mess. I was going to toss it but my son-in-law will eat anything. Another recipe bites the dust.

Great!! I added whisky instead of water, baked for about 65 minutes and refrigerated over night as suggested by some. I would suggest using mini chocolate chips for the cake. Everybody loved it & it was a super duper hit!! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Eh, to me this was just an average, regular chocolate cake.  It is a little denser than regular cakes & the chips are a nice addition, but it's nothing to write home about.  If you need just a plain chocolate cake, this is a good recipe, but if you need something special, keep looking.  In all likelihood, I won't be making this again.

Excellent cake, very moist. Needs more baking than recipe suggests: I needed 1 hour in a convection oven (conventional should be 1.5 hours). Also, I would prefer a sweeter taste, so I will replace water with sweetened condensed milk the next time.

I have NEVER been a cake eater, but this cake is heavenly,and so easy to make.  I made it with Raspberry Chocolate Chips, but I'm sure Peanut Butter Chips would work wonderful also.  The sky is the limit with working with this cake.  I used Cool Whip for the topping which I sprinkeled some Toffee Coffee granuals (from Tastefully Simple)over.  I had so many raves, and the only bad thing about this cake is....I can't keep my fingers off it!!!  Yum!!!

This is definitely a chocolate lover's cake!! It's extremely moist and rich.  The chocolate chip frosting gives it the right balance of flavor.  I was a little unsure though of how moist the inside really should be.  I ended up baking it the total amount of time and it still seemed pretty soft in the middle.  My family really liked this cake.  Also, it seemed even better the next day.

I used coffee instead of water and added l tsp. vanilla. For the glaze I used leftover frosting from Barb's Chocolate Cake which also contains coffee. Very easy and moist. It disappeared fast.

Very easy and rich dessert.  It mixes up in no time and I generously oiled and floured a bundt pan that was probably 50 years old and it came right out.  Loved this cake.

The first time I made this, it came out a little underdone.  This time...it was perfect.  I cooked it a full 70 minutes and it was perfect.  I served this warm with icecream on the side.  This is a terrific recipe especially if you like chocolate!

I made this cake as a chocolate dessert option for easter lunch.  I haven't served it yet but am a little disappointed.  The top of the cake stuck to the bundt pan.  I had to cut out the top and put it back on.  Hopefully the chocolate glaze and some powdered sugar will hide the mess.  And yes, I did grease and flour the pan.  Maybe I didn't cook it long enough...  But what I ate out of the pan did taste great!

Don't look at the nutritional guide on this one, but OH MY! This was so decadent, sinful -- you pick the word.  Just plain old YUMMY!  Pick up some milk to go with it. I've made it at least 10 times now.  It is always the talk of the party.  Thanks Jackie!

This cake had rose beautifully when it was removed from the oven.  After resting for 10 minutes it had sunk into the Bundt pan.  Luckily, it flipped out okay.   I found this cake very hard to judge when it was finished baking.  At the 40 minute mark the tester came out clear in 3 different spots, but it clearly wasn't done baking.  I removed it from the oven at the 55 minute mark. My family enjoyed the cake, but I was not pleased with the appearance. Lots of chocolate cakes to choose from, not sure if I'll try this one again.

This cake has a very intense semi sweet chocolate flavor.  It is also extremely moist.  We prefer a milder chocolate flavor in our cakes so next time we are going to try milk chocolate chips and see what happens.  We also might switch out the Devils Food Cake mix with a milk chocolate cake mix just to see what happens.

This is the most wonderful, moist cake ever.  So easy to make, too.  I added peanut butter and chocolate chips to the recipe and omitted the chocolate topping.  I felt it didn't need the added sugar.

This was very moist. :) I really liked the drizzle on it as well. Not too sweet, in my opinion. My husband loved it! I do not have a BUNDT pan, so I used two 9 inch round pans. The 40 minutes baking time was perfect.

I have made this cake several times for gatherings w/ friend/family and has been a huge hit. Very easy to make and super moist. Funny I am posting this now because I am making it and forgot how long to bake it. Ooops. This definately worth a try and trust me you will got back to it time and time again. Quick go to for last minute.

WOW,  Craving chocolate make this cake.  Family loved it,  even
the non chocolate lover in the house.  The only thing I did different was I used vanilla pudding, but that was because I was out of chocolate.  I don't think it made any difference to the taste it was still very CHOCOLATE cake.  Have a tall glass of cold milk  to drink you will need it.  Will definitely make again and again and again.

I made this the first time for my husbands birthday, as pudding cake is his favorite...but I had never made one before.  He said he never had one like it, and he loved it!  Easy to make and it is all gone every time!  Like she said below..Every CRUMB is eaten.

This turned out great. I made a few small changes. I used low fat sour cream and skim milk, and substituted Kahlua for the water.  I didn't add all the chocolate chips because I thought it might be too much chocolate--sounds crazy I know. I spooned a rum glaze (from another recipe on this site) over the top after I had poked some holes in the cake and put in the fridge over night. Yum yum yum. It is excellent and the rum glaze added some extra moisture and sweetness without adding more chocolate. I will definitely make this again.

I have made this cake more than once and it is always a favorite.  I usually have to cook it longer (by about 20 minutes).  My stove is calibrated, and my pan is standard-size, so I am not sure why this is.

Anyway, to avoid burning, I turn off the oven and let the ambiant heat finish the cake off.  Perfect!

Also, it is dense so it takes a while to cool.  Be patient; it's tasty enough to make the wait worth while.

Amazing!!  I wanted something quick and easy to make that would please picky eaters.  I whipped this cake up in no time and served it to rave reviews.  It is so rich you'd never guess it came from a plain old cake mix - and you never have to tell, either! :)

The Best! I also had to bake a little longer, just 10 min., and also used a chocolate fudge cake mix. Took it to our tailgate and 8 people ate the entire cake! Thanks so much for a great recipe!

I don't like cake and made this for my son's 19th birthday party.  I doubled the recipe and cooked it in two 9 x 13 cake pans.  Otherwise followed recipe.  It was fantastic.  All the kids wanted the recipe and I even liked it.

This is the best cake EVER!! It tastes like lava cake...moist and fudgy and delightful- don't make it if you're on a diet! If there's any left, it freezes well too-I just took a slice out of the freezer and popped it in the microwave for a bit. It's awesome warm with ice cream!

We absolutely loved this cake! It is so moist we couldn't believe it! I am recommending it to my friends. I used half a cup less of choc chips in the batter other than that everything was exactly the same! I was glad this recipe came with a glaze because I don't like making cakes without a frosting/glaze/etc. Thanks for sharing this with us. It will definetly be made again at our house!

Great cake!  It is very moist.  I took it to Easter dinner and everyone raved about it.  You can smell the chocolate a mile away!
A couple of weeks later, I took it to a cake auction.  The person who won the recipe took the cake to work and everyone asked for the recipe!

Very rich chocolate cake!  My husband took it to work and everyone loved it and thought it tasted like a chocolate torte.  I did make a few changes though.  I followed advice from one of the other reviewers and took out batter because my bundt pan only holds 10 cups.  I made an additional 9 regular sized cupcakes, but took them out after 25 minutes in the oven. The bundt took 50 minutes due to less batter.  Also, I used  softened butter instead of oil and 1 1/2 cups of mini chocolate chips and a 1/2 tsp. of vanilla.  Because there's less batter, I didn't have an overflow and it didn't take over an hour to bake.  What I did notice was the cake rose really high in the oven, but shrunk down a lot after it cooled.  I left it in the pan for nearly an hour and it just came out of the Nordic pan with no problems.  Only disappointment was the size, until I tasted it.  The decadence makes up for the size since no one can eat too much of this cake even if they are chocoholics.  This will definitely satisfy your chocolate craving!

Wow!  This is the best way I've ever found to dress up a chocolate cake mix!   The flavor is similar to those giant chocolate-chocolate chip muffins you get at bakeries, but it's even more moist.  My only issue was that the chocolate chips made it stick to the bundt pan really bad--I think next time I'll tweak the baking time to make a 9 x 13 pan.  Or cupcakes!  I'll never make a cake mix plain from the box again.

I bet you could alter this recipe using different cake mixes and pudding flavors...

To Die For.

This cake was a hit at a family get together we had a few weeks ago.  The platter was practically licked clean.  Super chocolaty, moist, and delicious.  A definite for chocolate lovers.  

The recipe was easy to follow, and turned out beautifully.

This cake was excellent! Very moist, and the glaze turned out perfect. I used Devil's Food cake and pudding, and it turned out wonderful. I may try making this with lowfat sour cream and applesauce instead of oil, to try and cut some of the fat. Just beware, it is hard to stay away from this one!

Delicous!  Made for Valentines Day for my family and they loved.  Substituted light sour cream and margarine (had a  guilt trip) and kept everything else the same.  Will definetly make this again.  I did have to bake for about 15 more minutes but the cake was beautiful and you could not tell that it came from a box (by taste or looks).  (see photo)  Thanks for a great recipe!!

The Best and EASIEST cake I've ever made.  However if you use a rubbermaid bundt cake pan, let it cool longer than 10 minutes in the pan.  Otherwise it falls apart.

I put this cake in my office lounge at 8:30am... it was gone by 10!  I substituted half of the semi-sweet chocolate chips for milk chocolate chips - in the cake and the glaze.  Took a lot longer to cook, but worth the wait.  My husband loved it warm with a scoop of ice cream.  A definate must try for a choc-a-holic.

I thought this was very good and it received rave reviews at the picnic I took it to.  I had to bake it longer than suggested, I baked it until a toothpick came out clean.  I also forget to add the chocolate chips, so I added more chocolate glaze to the outside.

Very good, but took so long to make first time i made it came out perfect. Second time took a long time to cook. Third time didn't cook all the way and cooked it for 55-65 minutes and still wasn't done.  But very good when it is done.

I was really excited to try this recipe. I decided that I would try it for New Year's. When I made it it overflowed over the sides, and when I took it out it was a mess.  Get an extra large bundt pan, or maybe split it up into two pans. It seems like it would be so good, but I'm not willing to mess up my oven trying.

This is a really good chocolate cake.  I checked mine after 40 minutes and the toothpick wasn't clean, checked it at 50 minutes and the toothpicks still didn't come out clean.  At 55 minutes (still not clean) I decided that the chocolate chips must be preventing the toothpicks from ever coming out clean.  I took the cake out of the oven anyway, it was pretty moist and I was sure it wasn't done, but the next day it was perfect.  It is a very moist cake and worth all the worrying.

This was very good and SO moist - it lasted in our house for a week (there are only two of us) and never became dry.  The only complaint I have is that you can taste the "box mixture" flavor.

Tasted delicious, albeit very rich.  I served with whipped cream.  It really fell apart when I tried to remove it from the wire rack.  I wasn't a fan of all the chocolate chips, but that is because I don't like chocolate chips very much.  I really liked the cake part though!

An excellent, dense chocolate cake that is better the second day (seems to oily when first out of the oven).  Of the cake mix/pudding/sour cream recipes I have tried, I like this one the best. I don't think it needs 2 cups of choc chips--I prefer about 1 cup of minis.  I don't care for the glaze; a good soft chocolate frosting is much better in my opinion.

Cake took an hour to cook, and even then I was afraid it wasn't done -- tasted it the night I made it and it was so smooshy that I thought it was underdone.  However, after sitting overnight it firmed up some and tasted really fudgy and had a good moist consistancy.  Almost has a dark chocolate flavor.  Everyone at work loved it.  Thanks!

My daughter and I loved the recipe.   My husband thought it was slightly too gooey and too dense for his taste.   It was pretty wet in texture the first time I made it, but the second day was fantastic.   I did make it a second time, but this time used 2/3 cup sour cream and 1 1/4 cup water.   It turned out great.   Not as gooey, more cakey, but still dense and delicious.   I used a traditional ganache frosting made with heavy cream and chocolate chips.   VERY GOOD!

Incredibly simple recipe!  Made two to take to work!  Only changes I made were substituting 1/2 cup of amaretto liqueur for the water.  And I added 1/8 tsp. Salt and 1 tsp. Vanilla Extract.  They look great!  I can't wait to try it with the ganache.

I love this chocolate cake! Has anyone ever tried doing a vanilla version? I have mine in the oven right now. The vanilla cake mix calls for less milk so I used a little less and I used white chocolate chips. I make my own icing instead of the glaze and I will do the same with the vanilla. I guess we'll see how it turns out! Oh, and I also use 2 9" round cake pans and cut the time to about 35 min.

Delicious cake and easy to make. I used 3 eggs and 1/4 cup of oil and it was plenty moist.  I heated some chocolate frosting until it was pourable and drizzled it over the cake.

I'm a chocolate lover and this cake is definitely for chocoholics. I followed the recipe to a tee and it was absolutely delicious. I was a little nervous because the cake mix that I used was 15 oz vs 18 oz as the recipe calls for but it came out perfect. I dredged the chocolate chips in flour before adding to the cake batter so they wouldn't all drop to the bottom of the cake. I also cooked it in a 9 x 13 pan as I didn't have a bundt pan and ended up cooking it for 45 mins and it was perfect.

This cake is so moist and chocolately. I think I will try a glaze that's not so chocolately next time though. But other then that, great recipe.

I have been making chocolate cakes from scratch for a long time, but thought I would try this as it sounded like a cake that would deliver a chocolate fix without the mess and labor involved. True, the cake is very easy to make; very little fuss. The presentation is terrific, rich and dark. The cake is scrumptiously moist with a tender crumb, very pleasing to the palate. But -- you must use the chocolate chips in order to get any kind of chocolate flavor out of this cake. I was really hoping for something that would give me a nice chocolate fix, but that unfortunately did not happen.

This was a hit. I only changed the added morsels to mini ones and that was it. Oh and we didn't add the frosting, it really did not need it. This cake is so moist and dense all on its own. Its perfect.

This cake is excellent. It's rich, moist and intensely chocolate. I didn't have two cups of chocolate chips left so I added one. didn't missed a bit at all.

I made this last night for dessert.  I was hoping to find something that was the same consistensy as one of the grocery stores cakes I bought (and now they don't carry any more).  This cake is very good, but I though it was very rich.  I think next time I make it, I'll leave out the chocolate chips.  I didn't put the glaze on it either.  I think it's sweet enough on its own.  But still a great cake.

This is my go to...sometimes topped with chocolate glaze and sometimes with chocolate buttercream.  I use a bit if coconut oil for a nicer texture. If you like a light coconut flavour then use half regular oil or butter and half coconut oil melted.

I made this last night. It is too chocolately!!   I should of read the reviews before I made it, and used half the chocolate chips. All the chocolate chips went to the bottom of the bundt pan. This cake is too rich for me! Also it took 100 minutes to make.
I suggest do not put the icing on the cake.

It was really good! I love it! I did it with two 9" round cake pans then I poured to glaze over it with powered sugar. I also baked it for an hour like the rest suggested. It came out perfect! Thanks for the recipe!

This is by far one of the best cakes I have EVER made. It is exactly what everyone says. Moist, decadent, and very chocolately. I baked mine for one hour after the other reviews that I read. I took it out and sliced off a piece after about an hour from taking it out of the oven. I thought maybe it was still undercooked but NO. It's just fudgy. Delicious. I didn't even add an icing to it. Adding the icing maybe overkill. I loved it.

Perfectly wonderful for the chocoholic craving a fix - after a piece with a cold glass of milk, your PMS problems are over!!! Even my hubby agrees; he says "After eating a piece, I can honestly say I don't have PMS." (The weirdo!) Rich, dense, chocolatey - this cake is amazing. Next time I will add a tsp or two of cinnamon - I love what cinnamon does for chocolate!

My son volunteered me to bring cupcakes to his school meeting. So I searched and found this recipe. I doubled the batch since I needed 3 dozen cupcakes. I used unsweetened applesauce instead of oil and used a full bag of mini chocolate chips in the batter. I didn't make the glaze. I ended up using store bought chocolate fudge frosting. The batter was the consistency of whipped mousse. I filled the cups 3/4 full and baked for 23 minutes in a gas oven. I ended up with 51 cupcakes. The tops did sink in a little but after topping it with frosting, you couldn't tell. I ate one without frosting and they were great. Then I couldn't help myself and ate another with frosting and it was chocolate heaven. This reminded me of the recipe of Too Much Chocolate Cake, but not as dense. I guess I have to thank my son for volunteering me to make cupcakes for I'd pass up this recipe. I will definitely make it again.

I have been making this recipe almost exactly as written for over two years now and EVERYONE loves it. Whether it be in cake or cupcake form it always gets rave reviews!!! The only thing i tweak is I use melted butter instead of oil; it just feels right! Try substituting different flavor chips, if you want variety but its a real CHOCOLATE cake.mmmmmm

This is my family's potluck cake of choice and we always get asked for the recipe. The melted chocolate chips scattered throughout the moist cake are just heavenly. However, instead of a chocolate drizzle on top, we usually just dust it with a little powdered sugar because it really doesn't need any more chocolate. Using a butter cake mix in lieu of the devil's food is also very good.

Awesome!! The only thing I changed was only putting 1 cup of chocolate chips in the cake after reading a few reviewers saying it was too rich with two. It was delicious. Everyone scraped up every bite and my husband said it was the best cake he's ever tasted. Very rich and moist.

Quick and easy, yet was the hit of the Fall Festival.  A chocolate lover's dream.  The cake is light, yet is packed with chocolate.  The cake is wonderful with or without the topping.  I did cut back on the fudge topping.  If you loved Molten Chocolate Cake, this is the simple alternative!

This cake is amazing. I cook it for 1 hour and 5 mins, let it cool for ten, and every single time I've made it, it comes out of the bundt pan beautifully. My family absolutely loves it! I have three brothers and a sister and it's rare when there's a piece left over!

A lot of the reviews said to bake this for a longer time, which is correct, but be sure not to overbake this!! I made this a few weeks ago and I think I accidentally baked it for too long. The cake ended up dry (except for the parts with the chocolate chips in it- that part was DELICIOUS!). I topped this with Mr. Goodbar frosting, and it tasted great! It will satisfy your peanut butter and chocolate cravings.

Definately had to increase the bake time, but WORTH IT! WOW! Everyone loves this cake and its sooo easy! I made the topping in the microwave in a glass pyrex measuring cup (the 2 cup size) and it was a breeze to pour over the cake.

Excellent! To save time, I just used Hershey's syrup as the glaze over the top--pretty good! Probably not as good as the glaze given but tasty, gooey and fast! Thanks!

This is delicious.  I reduced the amount of chocolate chips to 1 C. in the cake and sprinkled the top with confectioner's sugar instead of the topping just to reduce the calories a tad.  Still very rich and delicious. I know the chocolate topping would have been incredible, but since it's hard to only eat one piece....:)

This cake is the best!  It turns out so moist and delicious.  I usually have to cook it longer than the recipe says, but every time it turns out great and it gets devoured.  I don't add the glaze on top and I serve it warm with vanilla ice cream.  Yum - death by chocolate!

Holy Cow this was good. I was worried it had been too overhyped in my head, but it delivered on every chocolate promise. Took a little longer to bake, but SO worth it.

This cake was magnificent!!  I made it for my family for Valentines Day.  It was quite a hit.  I took the leftover cake to work and they LOVED it.  Said how decadent  and moist it was.  It made too much batter and I used others advice and made cupcakes too.  I also cooked it for 60 minutes.  I will make this again definitely!!

Excellent cake!  It took ALOT longer (about 35 minutes longer) to cook than indicated, and the edges turned out burnt, so next time I will probably make 2 bundts with this recipe.  Also, instead of making the glaze, I zig-zagged ready-made frosting over the entire cake (using a zip-loc with a hole cut in the corner) and sprinkled it with more mini chocolate chips and chocolate curls before the frosting hardened. AWESOME! Thanks for the recipe! :D

This cake is definitely for the chocolate lovers. My family loved it. I wasn't quite as impressed as they were. I thought the texture was too fudgy. It took a good 75-80 minutes for this cake to bake and it wasn't overdone. I made two small "taster cakes" for my granddaughter and her friend (using mini bundt pans), if I had used the full amount of batter in my bundt pan, it would have overflowed. The glaze was delicious and I will use it again on other cakes. It was a good cake, just not the type that is my favorite.

OK, I'm not willing to eat raw cake to get a "fudgy" texture.  This one took 75 minutes to cook thoroughly.  That said, the cake was incredibly light and moist.  The chocolate chips sank to the bottom, so perhaps next time I'll try sprinkling them on top of the batter before it's baked.  Easy recipe; good flavor.

Good cake! A little hard to check for doneness because of choc.chips but worth it. Dusted with powdered sugar instead of glaze. I thought glaze would be too sweet. Got many complients!

A good moist chocolate cake. However, i would prefer if it were a little more moist and crumbly - i thought it was a little bit rubbery in consistency. A garnish of chopped strawberries that have been marinated in sugar added on top makes a nice decorative touch.

Definitely the best chocolate cake!  But, it comes out a little too moist.  I cut down on the chocolate chips and baked it about 15 mins. longer.  Also, I don't use the glaze, just sprinkled a little powdered sugar on top!  Delicious!

Good tasting cake, very dense and rich.  I am sure it was done but it sunk after about an hour and seemed undercooked inside then.  Next time I will cut down the number of chocolate chips because they add to that denseness.  To get it out of the pan, I greased it (the pan) with shortening and dusted it with cocoa, then ran a cake-testing stick around the edges of the bundt pan.  As it cools, the cake sort of pulls away from the edge of the pan so that helped.

Moist, almost too moist, but very delicious. I thought the cake was better the next day as opposed to eating it just after it had cooled. This is definately a keeper.

I baked this cake for a friend's b-day so I didn't get to try it but she called to say it was delicious (when warmed up, served w/ ice cream!) and that she could indeed taste the 1 cup coffee I put in for the water. When I made it the day before, I sniffed the cake and couldn't smell the coffee/mocha flavor but I guess it developed overnight. It is sooo easy and baked for 40min when oven's at exactly 350F.

Excellent warmed up in mircowave. Rave reviews from taste testers, but could do without the frosting as it's rich enough and nice and moist by itself.  Definetely need milk to follow this one.

WORDS CANNOT EXPRESS HOW WONDERFUL THIS CAKE REALLY IS. YOU HAVE TO TRY IT TO BELIEVE IT. I ADDED A MASHED BANANA TO THE CAKE INGREDIANTS. THIS CAKE IS VERY MOIST, IT FALLS APART.

Just made this cake tonight - Wow!  A great cake for which my company asked the recipe for.  As others have said though, the cake might spill over a bit and you really must cook it closer to 1 hour. I'm going to try it with chocolate chunks next time because the chips mostly melted & I think a bite of chocolate would be a nice surprise.  Also, it's a very rich cake, so I just dusted it with powdered sugar. A great recipe to fiddle with.

Very good.  Easy to make.  The hubby says leave out the chocolate chips.  Made several times in the last few months.  We didn't care for the glaze and used frosting the second time.  I also had trouble with the cooking time but my oven is funny so I have trouble with cooking times for everything.

When I made this cake, I followed the directions exactly.  Unfortunately, it overflowed from my bundt pan and I ended up with a bit of a mess.  

Even so, I cut away the overflow when the cake had cooled, and found what remained moist, rich, and delicious.  Guests raved, comparing it to a truffle.  I was sure to cut it into thin slices so that no one would be overwhelmed with the dessert.  

I think it might be good served warm with a bit of whipped cream or ice cream, though I did not do that for my guests.

Raves aside, it is almost *too* rich and *too* moist for my tastes.
