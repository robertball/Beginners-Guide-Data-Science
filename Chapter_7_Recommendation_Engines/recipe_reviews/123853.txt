Wow! This salad really is "That Good" and it's a nice twist on a BLT salad! Plus it's perfect for BBQ's - I mean who doesn't like bacon? I used cherry tomatoes that I cut in half and pretty much just eyeballed the ingredients. Since I made a ton of this for a BBQ I served this with three different dressings: the one listed with the recipe which was light and refreshing, "Ranch-Style Buttermilk Dressing", and "Double Nickel Dressing" all from this site. I have to say the clear winner was the "Double Nickel Dressing"! This recipe is a definite keeper and one I'll be making again over the summer!

What a beautiful salad! I like the fact that it was not overloaded with salt, and I agree with previous reviewers that it is light and would go with anything. The lemon juice, oil & garlic dressing is light and not highly seasoned like commercial dressings, and it allows the wonderful combo of ingredients to meld without overwhelming any of the flavor. I only had provolone, but I think the swiss would be better, and the touch of toasted almonds made it very special. I halved the recipe for 3 of us, and still had leftovers. I can foresee adding a touch of honey to the dressing, grilled chicken as suggested by isabelleaucoin, green onions, or feta cheese--the possibilities are endless. However, this salad is delicious exactly as written!

This was a very good salad.  I cut the recipe in half since it was just for 2 of us.  I put a blob of anchovy essence (which I got at an International Market) into the dressing.  Also, since I don't care for store bought croutons, I made my own.  Just tossed some bread cubes with olive oil and garlic powder and baked for 10 to 15 minutes.  Much better than the boxed kind. Cheaper too.  We loved the salad.

Used spinach, toasted pecans, grape tomatoes halved (on hand).  Fresh lemon juice is key.  Used garlic powder instead of garlic.  Swiss cheese really makes this salad.

I made this salad for a potluck today, and there are no leftovers. I put the almonds alongside the dish to let people add them if they wanted, I didn't use croutons, & used Mrs. Dash instead of pepper but other than that I followed the recipe. It turned out very flavorful. I got everything ready the night before, put the ingredients in seperate baggies, then mixed it all right before the party. People said they liked it a lot, and I enjoyed it too. It was quick and easy to make. I'll make it again the next time we have a potluck.

Beautiful, refreshingly delicious salad with a beautiful, light dressing that showcased the assembly of ingredients ideally.  I loved everything about this salad except for the vegetable oil in the dressing, so other than using olive oil in its place, I prepared this just as the submitter intended, including both the Swiss and Parmesan cheeses.  (I did, however, have to skip the croutons, as I sent Hubs to buy some and all he was able to find was the boxed variety – yuck)

Made it just as written, except with olive oil instead of veg oil and grape tomatoes cut in half. Added 2 or 3 cups chopped chicken. Delicious! Make sure your romaine is nice and crisp.  UPDATE: The second day it's not *quite* as good - only because lettuce gets a little soggy from the dressing. This makes a huge amount of salad so if you're only making for 2, either cut in half or don't put dressing on until its on your plate.

This was a beautiful salad. It looked wonderful and tasted great too. Dressing was very light not strong flavored or heavy at all. This went well with our spaghetti supper. This would go with almost anything, it is mellow flavored. Thanks for sharing! I will definitely make this one again.

This was just o.k.  I took it to a large dinner party last night and no one even commented on it.  The dressing was way too light - really almost no flavor at all.  I would not make again.

Good salad!  I used sunflower seeds instead of almonds, and to the lemon dressing I added poppy seeds and extra lemon juice.  Very good dressing!

Yummy.  This is a BLT salad in English.  Don't skip the swiss and parmesan cheeses.    I emulsified the dressing before pouring on the salad and liked it more blended that way.  A little heavy on the salt, could safely drop s/p to 1/4 t.

The first couple bites of this salad didn't wow me.  But as I kept eating it and getting all the ingredients mixed together, it got better and better and I ended up loving it!  Hubby loved it right away!  I love the lightness and simplicity of the dressing.

An excellent salad that goes with any dinner....the dressing is so simple but so very tasty and it's got the right amount of everything in it, in my opinion.  I think the dressing benefits from a few hours of "melding" in the fridge before it's served.

Can't remember if I've ever had a salad that was as good as THAT GOOD SALAD. It really lives up to its name! I scaled down to seven servings (for one head of romaine) and was concerned whether this salad would be fine for leftovers in the metal bowl I had. No worries! DH and I ate EVERY BITE of those seven servings in one sitting! I think you could leave out the almonds if that's what's stopping you from making this; almonds are yummy but they didn't play a starring role. Delicious!

This salad lives up to the nickname though given to it by Betty's kids.  It really is a GOOD salad.  Make more than the number of people you are serving, as "seconds" is very common.  I make this salad when I want more than romaine, Parmesan, and croutons with Caesar dressing or something different to get away from the traditional iceberg with carrot, cucumber, celery, etc.

Any good "chef" will look at a recipe, know what to add for that extra little kick, consider the invitees preference, and make adaptions accordingly.

Hints for Recipe as proposed:
- Let the dressing "chill" at least a few hours for the flavors to really have a chance to mix.  I also shake the jar a few times to keep the dressing mixed.  The dressing is light and quite perfect, as it is understated and allows for the flavors of the ingredients to be tasted without being dry.
- large garlic cloves
- salt is not needed
- used cherry tomatoes and quartered them
- make sure you use Swiss cheese
- buy the slivered almonds and toast them yourself
- if short on time to cook bacon, at least get the real bacon pieces.  Don't ruin the salad with baco bits!

Additions:
- dried cranberries (a must! extra colorful, nice texture addition, turns it from a good salad to a great one!)
- purple onion

great recipe! I made it for a potluck to go with gumbo. It can go with anything, It is mild, but still wonderful. I agree that the swiss cheese and bacon really makes the salad.

If you are looking for a different salad to make, this is the one.  I made it for a side dish at a friends gathering and it was a hit!!  I added an extra head of lettuce (they were smaller) omitted the almonds and had none left.  The dressing was made exactly as was called... very light.  The key is definitely the real lemon juice.  I will make this again and again.

This is a great potluck dish because you can throw it together in about 15 minutes right before you run out the door (especially if you buy shredded Swiss cheese).  The dressing is light, but very flavorful.  I sometimes put grilled chicken strips in, and that also goes over well.  I also sometimes use about 1/2 olive oil and half vegetable oil.  I've found that the taste is not as good if you completely substitute olive oil for vegetable oil.

Oh my gosh! This was THE BEST salad ever! I can't say enough about how good this was. We all REALLY enjoyed it. My husband said I needed to make this salad everytime we fix salad from now on. The only thing different I did was to add some red wine vinegar to the dressing mix. Perfect!! Thank you so very much!!

One of our most favorite salads ~ I actually got this recipe from a local Amish lady.  She said she makes this for all their large community functions and it is a hit and always requested.

Salad was pretty basic and tasted OK - didn't change the recipe.  I would make again, but use a different dressing.

Excellent!  I did change the cheese from Swiss to Pepper Jack and added about a tsp or so of grated Parm to the dressing, awesome! I took it to a small gathering, so I had enough ingredients to make a second salad the next day, bonus!!  Everything works so well together.

We christened our new kitchen by having our neighbors come for dinner.  I served this salad as part of the dinner, they were awed by it and ended up taking the rest home.  Thanks for sharing Betty.  Will be using this recipe a lot!

This was amazing. The dressing was perfect.  Had a light yet distinctive flavor.  I substituted sunflower seeds (toasting them first) for the almonds because that is what I had.  I also used turkey bacon because I knew a couple of my guests couldn't eat red meat.  This was the only item at my party that the guests completely finished.  Everyone was in heaven over this salad.  Even my 8 year old daughter (who likes nothing) went nuts over this salad.  I'm making it again very soon as it can serve as a full meal.  Thanks so much for posting this one.

I made this salad for a gathering and it was amazing. I put regular shredded cheese instead of Swiss, I omitted the bacon and I put olive oil instead of v.oil. There was leftover the next day, and it was still very delicious even though I never eat the salad if it stays one more day.

WOW is this ever a good salad. One of the best I've ever had. The dressing just makes it. I used concentrated lemon juice rather then fresh since that is what I had, but other then that followed it to the letter. Made it for a dinner party and everyone was eating their salads before they even touched the rest of the meal on their plates lol. That is how you know it is good!! :)

I've been making this salad for years and it is the best.  The thing that I changed though was to use mayo instead of the oil.  My kids call it "secret sauce".  We love it.  Thanx for sharing.

By far my favorite green salad!   Blending the garlic, oil and lemon juice in a blender works nicely too.

My partner and I loved this salad. I used rice bran oil instead of vegetable and added a touch of sugar. I also toasted my almonds in a dry frying pan before adding them to the salad, it makes a whole lot a difference to flavour. It's best not to add the dressing to the salad until right before serving. Just lovely!

I sure wasn't impressed with the dressing but the salad was good.  
I made this a 2nd time and made a balsamic based dressing and it was so much better.

Excellent salad! Served this for guests visiting from out of state.  It was a big hit.  Next time I would not toss with dressing ahead of time (my error) - it got soggy quickly.  I skipped the croutons - they were not missed, but would be a good addition.

This salad was soggy(swiss cheese got soggy-skip it)  and the dressing was dredful, too much oil , make sure you use fresh lemon juice as the recipe says not concentrate. I re made it with 1/3 cup oil, 2 cloves garlic, the juice from 3/4 lemon and added the parmesan to the dressing(beat all in a chopper-like magic bullet) and poured on at the end. It is really a caesar salad this way with tomatoes. Much better once I redid the recipe.

This was amazing. My family and I absolutely loved this salad. The dressing was delicious, not sour at all. I don't think I'll ever buy bottled dressing again. Fresh lemon juice does wonders. The ingredients for the salad are perfect. I wll be making this again today for my hubby and me. Yummo!!!

Awesome! I used olive oil instead of veg oil. I also added chopped green onions and sliced avocados.  Drizzled the dressing over it, instead of tossing. We also had filet mignon and a chilled Tabali Reserva - wouldn't change a thing and I can't wait for leftovers tomorrow!!

Took this for supper club last night and everyone loved it.  Just sent the recipe off to everyone per their request.  It was almost like a caesar salad but not creamy.  Thanks for a lovely, refreshing and easy salad.  I will make this often!

Simple and Delish!!!!! I added hard boiled eggs to mine because I love it in my salad. Bf couldn't stop raving about how delicious it was which is nice because it is hard enough to get men to even look at salad.

This is one of my favorite salads.  Easy to make, good flavor, and you take home the empty bowl.

Great salad, amazing how the dressing complimented the tomatoes and bacon.  I made a few changes because of what I had on hand.  I used Monterrey jack cheese instead of Swiss and Parmesan.  I also used various types of lettuce, added sweet yellow pepper, and skipped the croutons.  I let the dressing sit and bit before adding it to the salad, not sure if that help mix the flavors or not.  Overall, excellent recipe!

I made this salad last night and served it with shrimp scampi which was a hit.  I would reduce the lemon juice by half and add some other seasonings.  I also added avocado which was really good with the bacon, lettuce and tomato theme of the salad.  I will definitely be serving this again.

This salad was amazing! I couldnt find swiss cheese so I had to use Mozzarella. The dressing was fabulou seven though I was nervous about it. I made it last weekend for a bbq and I am having another one with the same people and they requested I make it again. :) So it was a big hit.

I made this exactly as written with the exception of substituting Crispy Onions for the almonds.  The salad was excellent, but the dressing was AWFUL!  My husband "fixed" it by adding some apple cider vinegar, honey and Blackberry Brandy, which was good but not great.  I'll make the salad again, but it needs a different dressing.

Great recipe. We make it all the time. We also add ramen noodles (we roast the almonds and the ramen noodles for a few minutes to make them extra crunchy). The swiss cheese really does make the salad.

I made this for a potluck and got some compliments, but I thought the bacon overwhelmed the salad a little bit. Otherwise though, it lives up to its name.

Magnificent!  I left out the almonds because it already had so much good stuff in it.  I also cheated by using garlic powder and soya bacon bits.  This recipe is fantastic.  I already look forward to making it again.  Thanks.

Good salad.  It looked  nice but I didn't think that the dressing was that great.  I cut recipe in half since only hubby and I would eat with all that is in it.  Both of us ended up adding some of our favorite dressings to ours.  As to the salad itself it was enjoyable.  The cheeses, slivered almonds and bacon are a great complement.

I found this recipe in "Taste of Home" several years ago...I tried and knew it WAS "THAT GOOD SALAD." I have made this salad many times after.  On this recipe I haven't ever changed anything except for maybe a little less swiss cheese.   This salad is one of my all time favorites!!

I have made this several times for family gatherings and parties and it always gets rave reviews. I agree with others that the dressing needs time to sit on the salad for the flavors to meld. I also use grape tomatoes halved instead of chopped tomatoes. A definite keeper!

Okay, I was so excited to make this.  I usually am 100 percent impressed with any recipe I have picked.  I have to agree with another poster.  It was just okay. Hubby complained, as well as myself that dressing had no taste.  Not enough bacon taste.(I am going to give this another try) I added some sugar to the dressing, had to add more bacon, and just needed some more flavor, imho.  I have read the other posters comments stating "light dressing, nice," so it must be me.  I am going to tweek, it seems like I am missing something.

I love to serve this to guests with a good bowl of soup and a wonderful, fresh loaf of bread. Makes a great, filling meal. As other reviewers advised, I made the dressing with half Olive Oil and half Vegetable Oil.

Fantastic salad.  The reviews before me were all good, so I wasn't really worried when I brought it for Easter.  I was surprised with how much everyone LOVED the salad.  Apparently they have named me the "official salad maker" because they loved it so much.

Used 3 heads romaine; 12 oz Swiss cheese (didn't want leftover cheese); pre-cooked & crumbled bacon pieces and grape tomatoes that I halved & seeded.  Made the dressing with 1/2 C vegetable oil and 1/4 C olive oil.  Added a few splashes of red wine vinegar as suggested by another user.   Used about 3/4 of the dressing, which was plenty, even with the extra head of romaine.

I got this recipe from an old "Taste of Home" magazine that someone gave me a few years ago. My kids are not big salad eaters so I was surprised that they loved this salad! I make it at least once a week now and it's almost always on the menu when we have friends over.

good for a change but a lot went into making this salad and I'm not sure it was worth it.  don't think the company liked it much as they didn't comment at all.

I received this recipe originally several years ago when a co-worker brought it to a potluck luncheon.  The name of the salad on the recipe card was "Miramonte Salad", and the ingredients are the same.  I have made this salad many times since and always receive many compliments.  It is definitely awesome and one to keep in the front of your recipes!!

I was amazed at how much I loved this salad.  It seems too simple to taste so great.  It was a big hit with all my guests.  I am a vegetarian, so I made two versions—one with turkey bacon and another with soy “bacon”.  Both were great!
