I don't know what I did wrong. If I did anything wrong, but it was a waste of ingredients. The tops did not brown and the bottoms did. They are not fluffy and still a good bit doughy inside. And I cooked them an additional 6 minutes. Couldn't bake them any longer or the bottoms would have been completely burnt up. Maybe if the lard had not been melted they would have been fluffier and not so hard and HEAVY! Well at least I can give them to the dog as a treat for going potty outside......

Rarely, do I give a bad review because I'm adept enough to know what might work and won't. Sorry to say, this just didn't work. First off, it makes far too many. I scaled back to make 10 using the serving calculator. Somehow, the ingredients were still off and there was no way that this would roll out. I had to add an additional 1/2-3/4 C of flour to even bind it. It was still a loose dough and opted to make drop biscuits rather than rolled & cut. They came out doughy and not flaky or even tender. Baked an additional 5 minutes in a 400 oven.  I agree with the last reviewer.....almost 4 years ago, that it was a waste of ingredients. Sorry, but I'll stick to my tnt recipe.

I think something is definitely wrong with this recipe.  I thought the biscuits in the photo were uncooked and couldn't figure out why that photo would have been posted.  Biscuits really do look horrible when they come out of the oven and they were way too wet and gooey after being cooked.  Could not eat them.  Sorry.

If there was a negative star that's what I would give this. Why is this even on here. It is like it was posted as a joke. I never seen something that was so obvious as this that it just can't be for real. It is as if it is adult play dough. This recipe is offensive.
