I used Billy's Homemade Gingerbread Syrup in this coffee. This was so comforting this morning, the smells just 
made my stressful morning melt away.

You can purchase gingerbread syrup at Starbucks for $9.95.  They even gave me a pump to go with it!

The recipe itself was fantastic. I buy the Archer Farms (Target brand) Gingerbread syrup. I don't agree with the assembly. Typically you wouldn't mix the syrup with the espresso - rather the syrup would be steamed and frothed with the milk then pour over the espresso.

This was pretty good, but definitely sweet! I think 1 Tblsp. of syrup would have been plenty. I always had to tell them that at the coffee shops to. I have not seen gingerbread syrup at the stores, plus I wouldn't want to buy a huge bottle for one drink. I just microwaved: an equal amount of sugar and water, in a very small covered cup, and added a pinch or two of cinnamon, ground nutmeg, allspice, ground cloves, and ginger for one minute. I also just microwaved the milk and used my Aerolatte whisk. I thought the vanilla powder on the whipped cream was a nice touch. TY!

This recipe was very good. I substituted vanilla soymilk in for the milk, and it still turned out wonderfully. Thanks so much for posting this!

It came out great. We didn't, however, have the syrup and vanilla powder. But, the latte was good with everything else.
