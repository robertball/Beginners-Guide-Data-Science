I saut√©ed a white onion and half a red onion added garlic and onion spices (clubhouse) finely chopped carrots, minced red and yellow peppers  and 700grams of marble cheddar cheese. I used a sweet potatoe instead also. Everything was heated in a deep skillet and added in order of how I listed. Placed it in a tender flake double pie crust to help save extra time. I basically made a whole new recipe but with guide lines from this one and it was so good the family asked to add it to our favourite meals rotation!!  Try it you won't be disappointed and always add in your families favourite veggies finely minced for those picky eaters, the sweetness made it almost like a savery desert I will be making this every month and trying new add in and flavour combos.

I love this! I used cheddar instead of American cheese and added bacon. I like that you can add other ingredients without compromising the entire recipe. Even my picky 4-yr-old ate it, which definitely means something. Perfect for a chilly autumn dinner!

Added bacon and green onions to the mashed potatoes. I didn't have cheddar so I used mozzarella cheese - next time I'd like to try it with cheddar.
