This is a standard recipe for the most part, but it has one bastardized element that really ought not to go undeclared. Linguine is a sorry substitute for 'reshte,' the traditional noodles used in this dish. The reshte is featured in its name. Now, I really don't want to debate the practical purposes of using Italian pasta, fine if that's what you like, but it is never going to taste as perfect as with reshte. And in an ever increasingly cosmopolitan world, you owe it to yourself to eat the dish in its authentic, more aromatic and lighter original version with reshte.

Very unique! The recipe definitely needed more stock and plenty of salt and pepper, but it was a good start.

Complex flavor with different variations of sweetness from the caramelized onions and mint to tang from the cilantro. I also added dill in with it to round out the flavor profile.  Very delicious and definitely a meal that stands on its own.

I needed way more broth.  I used about 12 cups and could have used closer to 16-20 to make it soupier.

Excellent recipe! Tastes like my grandma used to make it! Ended up adding more vegetable stock because it wasnâ€™t liquidy enough.
