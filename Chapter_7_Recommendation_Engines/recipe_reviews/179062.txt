I had a few turnips from a local farm and decided to use one for this recipe.  I was really surprised how flavorful this soup was.

Easy and delicious!  Its good without the pesto as well.  I like pesto, but here i wasn't sure it was needed.  I did like that it used all the winter veggies that we had in the fridge.   I added the carrots later to make sure they were not too mushy.

I've made this a couple of times now, both with and without the pesto, and I'm not sure it's needed.  This soup is really good!  I did make a few minor changes; I used adzuki beans-just to give it some interesting color, omitted the red pepper, as I didn't have any on hand, and chopped the vegs small, so reduced the simmer time to about 20 min. I also added some cooked rice toward the end, to make it a bit heartier.  This recipe is a keeper!

This was a pretty simple, basic soup, but it had good flavor! I did use chicken broth and some cabbage that needed used up as well. I felt it needed some seasoning, so I also added some salt and pepper, to taste. I did not make or use the pesto...maybe next time. All in all, this was nice for something light and tasty! Thanks for sharing. :)
