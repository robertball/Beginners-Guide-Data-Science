I have a suggestion. Instead of mixing the ingredients in a tight fitting container, use a blender, mix all the ingredients except the oil.  Once all of the other eparateingredients are blended well, with the blender running slowly pour the oil in, as you do it creates an emulsion that won't  separate even if you have unused dressing left.  Refrigerate and it shouldn't have to be mixed/shook up when you want to use it.

Very Nice!  The chili sauce gives it a good zing.  I used red wine vinegar and olive oil and added a little white pepper and garlic powder for more punch. I did use only 1/4 cup of fructose and a little pineapple juice versus the full 3/4 cup sugar because I have to watch my sugar intake. Will definitely use this again!

This is some serious salad dressing!  We liked it, but I would be scared to give it to guests because it has some major kick.

Great dressing.  I think you can cut down the oil a bit to cut the fat.

I like this recipe but used red wine vinegar and added salt, fresh ground pepper and Herbs de Provence. In addition, I make mine in a food processor.
