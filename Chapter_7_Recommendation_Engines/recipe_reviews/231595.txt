I tested this recipe so I could give a review.The recipe was easy to make and turned out perfect for the products used. It did not say when to add the pumpkin puree so I put it in after I completely blended the eggs into the butter and sugar mixture. Also I made my own crust and the recipe did not say to spread it on the bottom only so I extended it up the sides and I also baked the crust for 10 minutes and then added the filler to it. The baking time was spot on. This turned out as expected it just needed a little more direction.
