Yummy!! There is nothing misleading about this recipe. It amazes me how people will give a negative review about how they think it is too ketchupy or too sweet. The title says Hamburgers and KETCHUP gravy and the discription says it thickens into a SWEET gravy. Gee, I mean what do you expect? I thought it was very good.

I have to rated this recipe a 5 because my family really enjoyed it. I would not rate this a very "special" meal...more of an "everyday" dish.
 I served it with pasta and a green salad and a week later my family requested that I make it again.This time I served it with mashed potatos and fresh green beans.  This is a versatile dish and easy to make. Since my family liked it so much I think I will get several pounds of ground beef and make the patties up and store them in the freezer so they are available for a quick but easy meal.  Thanks Jennifer this will make the summer meal planning a little easier.

This recipe was great! At first I didn't simmer it enough then after about 45 min.  I stirred it and couldn't believe how thick and sweet it was.  No way did this taste like ketchup after it has simmered!  The meatballs were really flavorful too! Make sure you add enough onion chunks because that's what make this gravy so good.  My husband added hot sauce on his plate because he likes everything hot.  I didn't make it with noodles tho,  I just made them as is and had some veggies and made some biscuits and it was wonderful!  I will definatly make this again!

We really liked this recipe, but as some other reviewers experienced, there was a problem with the meatballs not holding together. To overcome this we cut the ketchup to 1/4 cup in the meat mixture, and added a beaten egg. If you are alergic to eggs.... add 1 tablespoon all purpose flour instead... and go back to the 1/2 cup ketchup. We also added garlic powder, which enhanced the flavor even more. YUMMMMMMM.

My family loved this recipe! I made the meat into meatballs, and had no problem with them trying to fall apart. They stayed together nicely. I made them pretty small so maybe that helped.. I didnt think that the gravy or the meatballs tasted like ketchup at all. The trick must be in adding a large onion and really simmering it. (Even though I didnt eat the chunks of onion.) We didnt think it tasted like sloppy joes or meatloaf at all either. Myself, my husband and my 3 year old really liked it. He said "yummy yummy mommy". Also we didnt serve them over noodles, just by themselves with side dishes of mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. We all agreed that it would probably be gross if it were to be served over noodles. Anyways, I think you should give it a try!

Made this tonight and loved it.  Good food for a cold night.  I read all of the reviews and the only thing I changed was that I added an egg to help the meat stick together.  I made meatballs rather than patties and it was very good.  This is a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

We call this Serbian Steak at our house(kind of a joke, we Serbs didn't have money for real steak) and make it with round steak and lots of onions.  Takes a few hours of simmering in a slow oven.  We serve with fried potatoes and rustic bread. Use organic ketchup to avoid high fructose corn syrup. You really don't need seasoning other than onions.  Many people tend to forget that ketchup is quite a complex sauce, which you'll find if you ever make it at home.

For taste 5 stars. For ease of cooking 3 1/2 stars and for family health 2 stars. 1463 mg of sodium is far too much for my families arteries to process. Good? YES, good for you NO. I'll pass on this one.

At first reading I was skeptical as I'm not overly fond of ketchup. I made this as written the first time and really enjoyed the flavour and simplicity.  Last night I made it with a touch of garlic and 1/2 pkg of onion soup mix.  For our tastes it was even better than the first time.  Thanks for the recipe

Very easy, quick and pretty tasty. My husband loved it! Like others, the patties did not stay together well but I thought it added to the charm. Nothing wrong with all those bit of burger in the delicious red gravy! I served with mashed potatoes to which I added sour cream and chives! Really good for such a simple and quick dish!

I loved it, husband and son thought it was OK. You have to love ketchup with this one. Reminds me of mini-meatloaves cooked in ketchup. Used ground venison and an egg to bind, along with fresh bread crumbs (all I had). Cut back on the ketchup in the meat as I added the egg. They were very tender, but did stay together. I did saute the onions until tender in the pan after browning the meat. I think they tasted better that way rather than cooked in the ketchup sauce.

EFFORTLESS, EASY, SIMPLE, DELICIOUS are just some of the words that describe this meal!!!  YUM YUM YUM! 

SOOOOO good, my husband was also raving about this meal as well.  You have got to try it! 

Here are some things I did different:  
I made more of a "stuffed" meatball.  I added onions and mushrooms inside the meat, like a meatloaf. 

I served this with MASHED POTATOES which went sooo great with the red sauce.  

I will def make this again and highly recommend it to others!

Mmmmmmm - yummy!  Nice and tangy!  The hamburger part tended to fall apart a bit - especially when removing from the pan at the end.  But it's such a hearty delicious dinner, who cares?  :)

Very Good comfort food. Recipe easily changed to suit different tastes. Added red pepper cause hubby likes foods on the spicier side and it turned out great. Thanks for the super easy (and thrifty) recipe!!

I was looking for another way to make  meatballs and the ingredients sounds good. But the TASTE was wayyyyyy too sweet and the meat balls did not stay together at all. I followed the directions exactly . I ended up trying to make a meat sauce out it but again the sauce was too sweet.

My family loves this! I made it one night when I wanted meatloaf but was short on time. This is fantastic, we now have it on a weekly basis, and I get cheers each time!

The only thing that I changed was using crispy onions instead of bread crumbs and replacing the other onions with bacon. Oh, and I replaced the steak seasoning with a bullion cube just because I never have steak seasoning on hand.

Tastes good, but didn't work out the way I hoped. I did meatballs and they fell apart....then I let them simmer and it soaked up all of the water and I ended up burning them. Next time I will just use my common sense. =(

I followed this recipe to the letter and was not very impressed with it. I made meatballs instead of patties and even used others suggestions such as adding an egg to keep them together. They completely fell apart. I wont use this recipe again.

This is wonderful.  I make the same recipe with round steak and I just cook it until it falls apart.  I never thought of using burgers.  I serve mine with mash potatoes and cream corn. Wonderful!

I make this same type recipe using sirloin steak, S & P, ketchup & loads of
onions.  I just brown the cutlet size steak pieces in margarine or butter, add the onions, ketchup & some water and simmer it in the pan.  Then I bake it in the oven for about 20 minutes & it's delicious!  Ketchup gravy makes the difference.

I admit I had to change a few ingredients, because I didn't have the listed. For instance I used garlic powder instead of onion powder, I used A1 in stead of steak seasoning....I did add a couple eggs to the hamburger mixture....BUT! The ketchup gravy, simmering and all was absolutely fabulous! This will be made again and again in my home! The meat held together very well, and the taste is out of this world. Comfort food is absolutely right!
Thanks Jennifer for sharing this awesome recipe with us all!

This is exactly what it is meant to be be. Wonderful comfort food. Nothing fancy but something the kids love. This is also very similar to our grandma's meatloaf recipe, so of course we loved it even more. We put the burgers & gravy on top of steamed white rice. Delicious!

I really did not enjoy this receipe - when it comes to simmering hamburger it simply does fall apart -- it won't withstand long simmering.  I also did'nt like the flavor combinations.

This recipe had such mixed reviews I wasn't sure what to expect, but our family enjoyed it.  I don't think its "company" food, but for a simple, home cooked, hearty dish, it was good, and fit the budget too.  I couldn't quite imagine it over noodles, and not even mashed potatoes really.  I made home fries with some green peppers and onions and served the patties with these.  I'll definitely be making again, this was just plain good "comfort" food.  It will probably be a popular winter dish around our house.

My husband and I weren't crazy about this. It tasted like sloppy joes, but sloppy joes are easier and have a better flavor. One tip I wanted to pass on for people trying this - to help avoid the "ketchup" taste some reviewers complained about, I deglazed the skillet with red wine, then sauteed the onion before putting in the ketchup for the sauce. I cooked the sauce for an hour and did not have any problems with an overly ketchup-y flavor.

I didnt have the onion powder or steak seasoning, but deciced to try the meatball version of this recipie. I actually put in some canned pineapple chunks and it turned out pretty good! Very much like sweet and sour. I think it needs less ketchup in the hamburger though, the meatballs couldnt quite hold together.

Hubby is a burger "freak". Once a week, while I'm working evenings the studio, he has to have his burger fix. I didn't think he'd enjoy this recipe, which is fine because I made it for myself and Tyler using ground turkey. Ground turkey begs for moisture, so this was perfect. Ty is starving when we get home from dance and she inhaled these burgers. Nice and moist Jennifer!

The meal was simple and surprisingly delicious.  I increased the ground beef to 2 lbs and seasoned as follows:  1 ½ tblsp. McCormick Smokehouse Maple  Grillmate seasoning, 1 ½ tblsp. McCormick Hamburger Grillmate seasoning, 1 cup 4c Panko seasoned bread crumbs, 1 cup ketchcup, fresh ground black pepper to taste and fresh ground sea salt to taste..  I also formed the meat into meatballs, as I thought this would be easier for my kids to handle.  2 whole onions cut into chunks worked well (next time I’ll probably add 1 more since we just like onions!)  I also used a total of 3 cups of ketchup for the gravy with about 1 ½ cup water.  I seasoned the ketchup gravy with onion powder, garlic powder, fresh ground black pepper and oregano to taste.  This was a fun meal to make.  I will definitely be making again.  Who would have thought ketchup could create such a good meal. Thanks for sharing.

Very good, family friendly meal.  I jazzed it up with some baby bell peppers and a teaspoon of beef base added to the sauce.  Next time will try adding garlic powder to the burgers and a bit less ketchup because they were a bit loose.  Also used organic ketchup, which has more flavor than standard ketchup.

Very good, my youngest said it was like meatloaf patties. I used dehydrated onions as that all I had but it was good. Served it over mashed potatoes and the leftivers over some rice. This recipe is very adaptable  to your taste, could spice it up, add veggies and use turkey. Will make this again.

For such a simple recipe, this was surprisingly delicious. The trick is to simmer for a while. Like others, I added garlic powder to the meat mixture (which I made using 2/3 beef, 1/3 chicken) as well as one egg. I still had a problem with it falling apart, so next time I'd use two eggs. For the gravy, I used only 3/4 cup of ketchup and an equal amount of water. This was fabulous served over bulgur.

This is a good recipe. Adding egg to the meat for a binder is a must! I did not do this and my husband and I agree that it is similar to Sloppy Joes only because it all falls apart... but it was still good over egg noddles.

If you like this recipe, then try thin bone in pork chops, simmering the ketchup and onions while the chops tenderize.  It'll make the same sauce to drizzle on top of butter & parsley potatoes.

Nice base recipe.  Made meatballs instead of patties - baked/broiled 400 degrees for 20 minutes instead of frying.  Like the idea of simmering in ketchup sauce - tastes good.  Next time i will add salt/pepper, minced garlic, beef bouillon, and green pepper/onion to the meat mixture

This is similar to what my beloved, late mother-in-law  used to make.  She didn't write this one down, but I think the essence lives on with this recipe.   Added a few finely (finely) minced shallots to the meat mixture and threw in 2 sage leaves, and a few rosemary leaves during the simmering phase.    Will make again.   Really very comforting.  Somehow slightly over-salted this the first time -- something to keep an eye on.  since i've added a pinch of ground sausage.  Great flavor.

This was okay...kinda like Salisbury Steak.  Reminded me of those 1950s meals, simple but heavy. If you want to keep the meat bound together good, instead of bread crumbs use a slice of bread soaked in milk with the crust removed. Press the milk out and mix the bread into your meat. It also makes the burgers tender. A good tip for your meatballs, too.

I make this recipe but use beef cubed steaks instead. I don't add anything to the cube steaks,just brown them add ketchup and onions to the skillet, put the lid on and simmer until the ketchup is the desired thickness and the onios are good. Serve this on a steak bun  with chips and cottage cheese. Great lunch!

Tasted pretty good over wide noodles, but the hamburgers completely fell apart and got mushy which was kind of unappetizing.  Will make again but add egg to the meat mixture.

Okay, wow. My 2 year old daughter had thirds! I still can't believe how much she ate. I served this with rice and broccoli and it tasted terrific. I didn't have a problem with my meat patties falling apart but they were a little delicate so beware. I loved this but I do not like how much sodium is in this so I'm going to try to make again in a healthier fashion.

No, I would not eat every day, but it was great.  I spiced it up a little and added more onions.  Other than that it was outstanding.  I made it with ground turkey as well and other than being a little on the soft side it was great.

This was suprisingly good. I served this with mashed potatoes and "creamy lettuce salad" (also from allrecipes). Really simple to do, had everything on hand, and like my hubby said, "Who doesn't love ketchup?!!" Was more of a meatloaf texture, and did tend to fall apart when I tried removing them from the skillet, but it is a great comfort food, so presentation wasn't important here. Quite tasty and we all voted to make this one again. I did add a splash of worcestershire to this. Thanks for sharing your family recipe, this was a nice change from the usual.

This recipe was GREAT! I think that if the patties fell apart during simmering then they were made wrong to begin with.  They turned out PERFECT for me and my entire family loved this.  I've made it several times now and this is more like a "the more you make it the better you'll get at it" recipe, each time it gets better and better.  A real downhome kind of a meal.

This is very good. It is quick and easy and yet if you have to keep it warm for a while longer it just gets better.

I enjoyed this dish. It was a good little week night recipe. Fairly quick and easy.  The hamburgers were very moist and favorful. I served it with mashed potatoes.

I made this Friday, didn't have any ground hamburger so I just used the frozen patties I had on hand  and seasoned with my regular buger mix seasoning.  My son loved I enjoyed it also thanks for the recipe will make again.

I had the same problem as others.  My hamburgers got soggy in the sauce and began to fall apart.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Maybe if there had been an egg mixed in with the meat, it would have bound it together better.  Don't know.

Mine got soggy in the sauce. Im not sure what I did wrong since I pretty much went by the recipe. The taste was good, so I would like to try again and just make the meat mixture chunkier some how

I didn't have a peice of meat or sauce in the pan. I loved it and so did my children and customers. I think this is how I am going to fix my meatloaf from now on. Plus, I added a little something extra to mines. Thanks.

I've made this twice now, and both times I added an egg, like others suggested, and my patties stayed together pretty well. The first time I made this, I stuck to the recipe, except for the egg, but found I didn't have much gravy at the end. The 2nd time, I added a cup of beef broth, and halved the ketchup, and it was plenty of gravy, and everyone loved it (even my picky 5 year old). Hubby likes it so much, he said he'll never go back to 'regular' meatloaf again.

perfect inexpensive comfort food, I served it with mashed potato and it really hit the spot.  Make sure to let it simmer, the longer the better.

My kids really love this recipe.  I did have a problem with the meat staying together so next time I will try adding an egg.  We serve it over steamed white rice instead of biscuits or noodles and all agree that's the best way!!  It's super easy to make, too!

The burgers fell apart and basically turned to mush. It would have been better as a meatloaf.  The sauce was very sweet and ketchupy.  Most likely won't try again.

I personally thought this recipe was very tasty, the family wasn't big on the sweet sauce but that dislike has nothing to do with the quality of this recipe.  I found it to be very remanicent of Costco's meatloaf they have for ready to bake meals, which I also enjoy but now I can make it at home myself! Thanks for the recipe!!!

I MADE THIS  THE OTHER NIGHT. BOTH MY HUSBAND AND SON SAW THAT ONE OF THE MAIN INGREDIENTS WAS KETCHUP (WHICH THEY BOTH LIKE) AND THOUGHT IT WOULD NOT TURN OUT SO GREAT. THEY BOTH LOVED IT! AS A MATTER OF FACT MY SON HAD SECONDS. IT WAS VERY GOOD SERVED OVER EGG NOODLES. WILL DEFINITELY MAKE AGAIN. FITS IN WITH THE ECONOMIC CLIMATE AS WELL.

I made this for my husband & I last week.  My husband is a huge ketchup fan, so he just ate the gravy alone after all the patties were gone (I made a little extra gravy for this reason).  I added 2 cloves of minced garlic, slices of green bel pepper, 2 beef boullion cubes to the gravy & a beaten egg to the meat mixture.  The flavor of the meat was really good & they were extremely moist.  I guess I need to add more bread crumbs or take the suggestion of another reviewer and soak the bread in milk before mixing with the meat.  My patties were a little "loose".  I handled them gingerly so they wouldn't fall apart, but some pieces did manage to fall off the patties.  I served them with homemade mashed red potatoes & broccoli.  My husband was in love.  I will definitley make it again.  Thanks for an quick & easy weeknight recipe.

Surprisingly it was pretty good, very flavorful. I didn't chnge a thing! I too did have a problem with the burgers staying together but I think it was because it was previously frozen hamburger, maybe to much moisture. I will make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

My family jumped right on this one.  We served it over rice which I highly recommend.  Although I did meatballs next time I will make patties.  Patties are easier to brown crispy on the outside then the meatball.  The mixture is a little fragile and meatballs require a little more handling in the frying pan.

The taste of the gravy is good but I think it would be better as a sauce for a meatlong.  The meat patties were falling apart and I did not like that part.  I did not adjust the recipe so you may not need so mouch ketchup in the meat (or none).

This is a really tasty recipe.  The meatballs turn out super moist.  I took the advice of other reviewers and added an egg and diminished the ketchup to make the meatballs still together.  My only complaint is that there wasn't enough gravy!  I think next time I might double the sauce to try to make up for this.

Ny husband has a sweet tooth and I have a freezer full of venison burger.  So this recipe looked likely.  DH moaned with delight.  It was as if How-have-you-kept-this-away-from-me.  The kicker is that he came home with a mixed bouquet from the florist.  I found the results a tad tangy from the vinegar in the ketchup.  I cooked maybe 55 minutes until all the onion looked soft and translucent.  As the venison is so lean I left in the EEOV I browned the burgers in as I can always use the MUFA's, Monounsaturated Fatty Acids.  The burger was real soft so I want to experiment with less breadcrumb and/or an egg addition.

Sigh. I hate to rain on anyone's parade, but this dish was mediocre, at best. There was no complexity or subtlety to the flavors. It was ketchup and hamburger. To tell you the truth, I wish I had just made burgers and slapped some ketchup on them. I felt it was a waste of some good ground beef.

Loved this recipe. I ran out of ketchup for the sauce so instead of 1/2 cup ketchup I did half of it ketchup and the other half bbq sauce. I used meatballs instead of patties and I poured it over rice.

I haven't tried this with ground beef, I have made the gravy with chicken breasts and a diet cola, delicious.  You can then shred the chicken if you want and make a barbeque sandwich.  Will definately try it this way!!!

This was very good, but the kids did not like it.  I added 1 T Liquid Smoke to the hambuger mix before cooking and 1 T Worchester sauce to the ketchup and water mix before simmering.  Made it very rich, but delicious!

This was pretty good and the grandkids loved it.  We used lean ground beef and added fresh diced garlic along with about 1/2 tsp. of sugar.  Served with fresh baked bread, salad and frozen corn on the cob.  Thanks for the post.

I was kind of hesitant about this one but after it was finshed it was wonderful.  My whole family and best friend really enjoyed it.  And it's great to feed several people.

My husband, the ketchup lover, enjoyed this dinner- I thought it was just "OK".  I accidentally left the ketchup out of the meatballs, but it still turned out fine.  I served it with mashed potatoes for a good, plain, comfort-food kind of meal.  I'll probably be make this again.

I have made this several times and keep forgetting to rate the recipe! My family really enjoys this and it is quick and easy. The key to getting a gravy that is not too ketchupy is the scraping of the bits of ground beef stuck to the pan and onions! Even if you don't eat the onions i think it adds to the flavor !Then adding the ground beef patties to simmer adds even more flavor!!We eat it over egg noodles! Yummy!

I tried this based on the 4 star overall rating, I am not really sure what to say about it. If you like sweet meatloaf, then you will like. The mini loafs I made were very moist, almost too moist, a mushy consistency. I don't know how to improve, but will not be a keeper.

These burgers were pretty good.  It tasted like meatloaf to me, which is OK since I love meatloaf.  We ate them on a plate with a fork.  They were very moist.

These were good but a little too moist from so much ketchup in the mix.  The ketchup taste is a bit overwhelming and makes the burgers taste more like sloppy joes.  Like others, the burgers didn't want to hold together real well.  I will probably just stick with hamburgers or sloppy joes in the future.

"Outstanding" was what my husband said about this dish. I disagree with a previous reviewer that it tasted too much like ketchup. I will definitely make this dish again and again.  A switch from plain hamburgers.

Pretty easy to make - but not really worth the effort.  I made meatballs instead of patties and while they were tender and pretty good, the "gravy", no matter how long you simmer - tastes like ketchup.  My 7 year old, who puts ketchup on everything, liked it, but I just felt like I was eating meatballs and noodles drowned in ketchup.  If you LOVE ketchup then this is worth trying - otherwise, keep scrolling.  I will not be making this again.

My meat-and-potatoes fella said I could make this dish again.  Made it into four patties following directions as written except for the steak seasoning (how'd I miss that?).  Had to be gentle when moving the patties, flipping, transferring etc., but they stayed pretty much intact.  It's certainly a ketchup gravy.  Served with steamed cauliflower and a side salad.

I made this tonight! I used Worcestshire instead of steak sauce and I did add small amount of garlic powder in the meatballs along with an egg. I used a Lodge heavy enameled cast iron pot which really holds the heat so my meatballs did fall apart, but I'm glad they did. Really made it a meat gravy, that to me tastes much like my meatloaf . I served over dumpling noodles with a side of broccoli and rolls. It's a hit with everyone, and so easy too once you get your sauce simmering you can walk away. I will def make again and maybe try with mashed potatoes and green beans to change it up! Great meal on a school night as I have all the ingredients anyways, and I run out of ideas for hamburger meat sometimes! Thanks!

This was really good! It definitely needs some tweaking the next time though...and there will be a next time! The taste was 5 star worthy, but the patties fell apart badly and after simmering 30 minutes, the patties were kind of mushy. It looked more like sloppy joe than a burger but it was still yummy served over oven baked french fries though! Next time I will use less ketchup in the patties and add an egg as a binder. I needed to add a lot more water(wound up using close to a cup and a half)to keep it from sticking and burning, then when it was almost done, I left the lid off for 5 minutes to thicken up. This is definitely some really good comfort food, thanks so much for the recipe!

This is a great quick weekday recipe. I sliced the onion thin and substituted worcestershire for the steak sauce. I also added a pinch of garlic powder as did another reviewer. Served it with a grocery-brand prepared mashed potatoes. 45 minutes of simmering (30 covered,stir,then 10- 15 minutes uncovered REAL low)gave me good results with a just right thick gravy.  A keeper!

I found this recipe on here roughly 3 years ago and have been making it ever since! To rise having issues with the oasis falling apart- Add an egg to your meat mixture and use sliced bead for breadcrumbs. Break the bread into small pieces and mix it in. This should keep it together. I've always done this with my hamburgers and they are some of the most flavorful you will eat!

We've made it a couple times now and it's always a hit with the hubby and kids.  Although it's definitely best to follow the recipe...  In a mad rush, I threw some frozen hamburgers in a crockpot with diced green onions, ketchup, and water.  It was a close enough second.  Following the recipe is MUCH better but frozen burgers simmering in sauce was okay too.

This very simple recipe was a hit with everyone in the family.  The only change that I made was doubling the sauce and I let it simmer uncovered to thicken a bit.  Served with mashed potatoes.

This is a really good , fast, easy to make dish. I had leftovers which made also a really good lunch for me the next day too!  This recipe is a "keeper".  Great on the food budget and finicky husband liked it also.

This was okay. Taste like hamburgers with warm ketchup and onion. Who knew? Maybe melted cheese would be good on this...

Crazy as it sounds, this wasn't half bad. We added worcestershire and made them as meatballs. It really helps to like ketchup a lot!

I didn't really like this recipe.  The burgers were very soft and ketchup gravy wasn't all that.  This reminded me of meatloaf so I would choose meatloaf over these burgers.

This was different and fun. I made oven roasted potatoes to go with it. I used Italian Bread crumbs and it gave a nice flavor. Also, added a shot or to of worcestershire to the "gravy". It reminded me of meat loaf on the stove top. We normally prefer something a little more complex, but this is good for a simple meal. I would NEVER make this for company.

I tried this with the advice of adding an egg.  It turned out great.  My husband doesn't even like ketchup, but he really liked this.  Thanks for sharing.

This was so yummy! When I started cooking I noticed I only had about 1/2 cup of ketchup on hand. So, I substituted about 3/4 can of tomato sauce for the rest of the ketchup, and it turned out wonderfully! I added about 1/2 c water total, also some minced onion and garlic to the meat mixture. Next time I'll add an egg to hold the patties together better. I wish I had made more of this...when my 5 year old saw the onions in it, he almost refused to eat it. But when he took the first bite, his face lit up...he loved it! Very good, and very much like mini meatloaves.

This was really good. It tastes a lot better than it sounds. Reminds me of meatloaf in a skillet. I would add more bread crumbs next time and less ketchup to the meat. I made the meat into balls and by the time the dish was done they had fallen apart.

Made with ground Elk and threw in an egg like a meat loaf. Meat balls came out sooo good!! I think if I had some fennel seed that would have spiced them up even more.

The idea of this recipe sounded like a great one.  Even while it was cooking, my husband asked "what smells so good?".  When the dish was completed, I was disappointed to find my "meat patties" had fallen apart, like some of the other reviewers.  Something in my heart told me I should have added a beaten egg to the meat mixture, but staying true to the recipe and to be able to review honestly, I followed the steps exactly.  Flavor-wise, this dish was full of it, just not that appealling to the eyes.  I would say this would make a great sloppy joe recipe, with just a little less ketchup and water and some bell peppers.

Definitely 5 stars!! I made small, thick patties and they held together nicely. My husband loved them and they tasted like stuffed cabbage without the cabbage.  This time I'll make steamed cabbage and mashed 'taters to go with.

I made exactly like the recipe calls for.  I did find that the burgers fell apart.  I will adjust the hamburger/meatball part next time.  We all liked them though.  Very good taste.  Even though they fell apart, we ate them like sloppy joes.

Made this for dinner last week, it was very easy and quick.  I would add an egg or two also, the patties were a little loose.  However, hubby loved it for dinner and our dog Hank loved a little for his breakfast. Will make it again soon. :-)

This recipe was really good and easy to make.  I put mine over mashed potatoes.  The sauce made a great gravy.  My husband thought it was kind of sweet but still liked it.  Maybe a tangier ketchup would help.  Either way I will make this again.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I made it for my wife and my mother in law.  I made white rice on the side and a salad.  I really loved how the onions added to the taste of the gravy.  My wife thought it was a little too sweet for her taste, but I thought it was really good and I will make it again

This was really good!!!... My husband kept saying "I REALLY LIKE THIS!".. I used 1 cup of cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs, added 1 egg, 1/4 ketchup and formed 6 smallish but thick patties.  They didn't fall apart, and were extremely moist and tasty!  I added a couple of dashes or worchestire sauce to the gravy.  I served with creamed corn, spinach, and english pea salad.  Would be excellent with mashed potatoes!

What a great recipe, I'm not a big ketchup person so I was a bit leary but once everything simmers together it was super yummy and CHEAP (love that) and I served it on mashed potato. Definately a keeper!!

Was kinda disappointed, from all the reviews I thought it was going to be really good.  I fixed it and my DIL wouldn't even try it without being forced.  Grandbaby wouldn't eat it either.  I followed recipe completely. I won't make again, I thought it wasn't to bad but I felt it could of been better.

Wow!  I just made this for dinner tonight and my mother and husband loved it!  I doubled the recipe because we love left overs.  When I suggested to my husband that he take some extra to work to share with his co-workers, he said "NO WAY!"  I guess he didn't want to share!  It did not taste like ketchup either.  Sweet, but tasty!  It hit the spot!  This recipe is definately a keeper!

They do tend to be fragile so handle with care.Maybe an egg added would bind them but also it could change the taste.
I didn't have quite enough ketchup for the cup in the sauce so I added a little bottled barbeque sauce to make up the difference. These were so good. They would be good on a nice bun too but I served them plated with Dad's Pan-Fried Green Beans (from all recipes) and a homemade banana raisin bread. Such good comfort food on a cold night.

I was happily surprised with this recipe.  My family liked it too - even my husband who does not like ketchup ate it - and said it was good :)  I served with egg noodles for dinner...but when I reheated it for lunch the next day I served it over rice, which was yummy!

Definitely will make and serve again.  Served it with rice (that I cooked with beef broth instead of water), green beans, tossed salad and biscuits.  The men in the household went back for seconds...always a good sign.

I thought that this dish was 3 stars, but my hubby thought more highly of it.  I should have known to add an egg to the patties but didn't, and they completely fell apart.  The flavor is pretty good with the seasonings as written.  It ended up being more like a sloppy joe gravy that went over mashed potatoes instead of hamburger patties with gravy.  Not super impressive but it's easy to make.

I was eager to try this recipe because of the ratings...but was disappointed with the results.  I added an egg to the meat mixture as recommended by reviewers and had no problem with them falling apart...but the flavor of the meat and the sauce left me flat.  I'm giving this a 4 star rating only because I think the recipe has great potential with tweaking.  I will try again adding garlic to the meatballs and garlic and diced celery to the sauce.  Will also try adding oregano and thyme to the ketchup gravy.  As is...rather flat and boring...but definitely has potential with exploration.

We really enjoyed this. It reminded me a lot of what my mom called 'salsbury steak'. I didn't have any hamburger on hand but I did have some frozen beef patties. I served it over egg noodles and we both loved it. I'll be making this one often.
NOTE: Seems a few reviewers missed the step where you put the burgers BACK INTO the sauce BEFORE you simmer it for 30 minutes.

I tried  to marinate this overnight and cook in a slow oven.It smelled good but the meat was so tough you couldn't chew it. The only one who could chew it was my teenage son. Would not try this again.

I hate ketchup but this was great!!! I just wanted something different for dinner for a change and decided to give it a try; I was not sorry at all.   I don't know if I made it quite right but the burgers were a little "loose" and that may be due to adding too much of something.  It hit the spot, definite would make it again and again.

This is how I make my meatloaf now.  No need to cook for ever in an oven.  And the ketchup carmalizes and infuses with the flavor of the beef.  I love it!  Add your favorite meatloaf veggies and have a tangy meatloaf any night of the week.

This is very good and very simple.  Great over noodles.  The only problem I had was the hamburger fell apart  somewhat.  It didn't effect the flavor, so it doesn't bother me. The only changes were I add more ketchup to the gravy and some garlic.  Thanks.

This dish tasted good, but very crumbly  I had to break it up and use it in pasta sauce  The ketchup in the meat was enough  Didn't make the gravy   I probably won't make this again, but it is good with pasta!

I made this recipe one night for some very picky children...they loved it!  We have this almost once a week!
