These are really good.  Being a kitchen soldier I had to modify the recipe just a bit. I increased the amount of bacon to 6 strips instead of 4 because bacon makes anything better.  I added a little olive oil and season all to the cabbage and onion while they were sauteing.  Everything else was done per the recipe. I think they have an aprodisiac kind of effect to them because my wife couldn't keep her hands off of me after I made these.  I made them with another recipe found here for meat loaf and it was just scrupious.  Hope you all enjoy my review and remember, don't let your meat loaf.

For St. Patrick's Day 2004, I made this side dish to go with our corned beef.  I made it again today for this year's St. Patty's feast.  My family loves it.

The only thing I changed, following a reviewers suggestion, was to use a 16 oz. bag of cole slaw mix instead of the 1/2 head of cabbage.  It turned out great and I liked the little bit of color the carrot added.

This one's definitely a keeper.

This was a hearty, warming vegetarian main dish for a cold evening. I omitted the bacon and subbed olive oil and butter to saute the cabbage mix and added 2 lg cloves of garlic to compensate for the flavor.  I boiled the potato in veggie broth for the same reason.  I also increased the relative proportions of cabbage and onion to potato.  Lastly, I added about a 1/4 c. or so of aged white cheddar with a little extra as garnish with more dill too.   Next time I will try carrots, turnips or rutabagas with the potato for a change of pace, or perhaps try some Guiness Stout instead of the milk for a vegan dish.

Always trying ways to enhance mashed potatoes.  This one is TERRIFIC.  I make a double batch and save the leftovers for use on Shepherds pie.

Made this on St. Pat's Day when the family asked to try a traditional Irish dish.  The kids watched me making it, announced that it looked "strange" and said they would try just a little.  They loved it and wanted me to make it again a week later!  I used some baby yellow potatoes since that was what I had on hand & a bag of shredded cabbage for coleslaw.  The first time I used some liquid from my corned beef to sort of steam the cabbage rather than saute it, and the second time I prepared it following the recipe.  It was great either way.

I didn't think the whole idea of blending mashed potatoes with cooked cabbage would appeal to my family, but it was an excellent way to get the kids to eat their "greens" and they loved it!  I followed the recipe exactly and found it very tasty.

traditional colcannon uses kale rather than cabbage...try this substitution and you will be pleasantly suprised.

I still love making/eating this stuff and am so delighted that there are so many others who've enjoyed it over the years as well! Just thought I'd share a tip that I've come to love over the years... sometimes I forget to melt the butter used to pour into the well and when that happens I don't make a well but I simply cut the 1/4 cup butter into chunks and press them slightly into the surface of the colcannon. Within minutes there are multiple "mini wells" of melted buttery yumminess! Everybody gets to have a good shot at getting a serving with melted butter! Oh, and I've also started using more bacon! Life's too short not to! :-)

This was really good, although I made some adjustments to suite our taste.  I used about half the potatoes (adjust the milk accordingly), only 2 slices of bacon, and sauteed the onions prior to adding the cabbage.  The butter seemed unnecessary at the end, and no one missed it because  of the bacon in the recipe.  This made a great side to a pork roast and was perfect for a chilly night.

I decided to make this to go along with the Corned Beef cooking in the crockpot instead of throwing all the veggies in with the meat as usual. Let me just say it was SO much better - and before yesterday neither my husband nor I even had heard of colannon! This is definitely what we will be having with our corned beef from now on - thanks for the recipe!!  Update: the next day, I chopped up the leftover corned beef and added it to the colcannon - the best comfort food ever!

I usually make my potatoes in the same pot as my corned beef, but decided to try this recipe.  I must say my family loved this.  From now on I will be making this quite frequently.  The only thing I did differently was add a little more bacon (2 slices) because I made more than 2 1/2 lbs of potatoes.  I thought I would have leftovers but between my daughter and son (both adults) they polished it off.  Thanks so much for the recipe, it was wonderful and very tasty.!

In my imagination, this recipe was created by a frugal housewife, who during the bleak and barren days of winter, combined the remaining vegetables stored in her root cellar to feed her family something filling and delicious.   In days of greater abundance this recipe is still satisfying, comforting, and delicious.  I made it exactly as written and my beloved and I enjoyed every bite.  This will be made many, many times.  thank you Diane.  This is a keeper!!

I looked at other recipes for Colcannon and ended up using this one. I used kielbasa instead of bacon. After it was all together I put it into a greased casserole and baked it for 30 min. YUMMY!

i would rate my version 4 stars only cuz i kno the bacon wouldve made it 5 and i didnt have any. the only thing i did different was cooked the potatoes in the oven at 400 degrees for 45 minutes. the way you do it is coat them in olive oil then in sea salt and the rest as previously mentioned. i also had to saute the onions and cabbage in olive oil and butter as suggested by another reviewer since i didnt have bacon of course, hence no bacon grease. also we didnt have milk so i substituted with sour cream.. not much changing.. mostly substitutions for lack of ingredients.. but my version was pretty good. hope my suggestions helped!

Increased bacon just a bit & like others, added 1 clove of garlic when frying the cabbage & onion then whipped the butter with potatoes. The absolute HIT of St. Patrick's day dinner. This will be a staple in our house from now on!

Love this recipe and have made it several times.  Sometimes I add more bacon, sometimes more cabbage.  Works well either way.  Makes quite a bit for two people but I use the leftovers to top a 
Shepherd's pie and have shared this recipe with everyone who has tasted it.  Rave reviews from all.  It has become a standard at our St. Patricks Day pot luck.

I made this recipe exactly as stated (I even weighed the potatoes). This was simply too bland for our palates. If I ever try it again, there will be garlic, ground caraway seed and a more equal amount of cabbage and onion to potato ratio. Also some browned sausage broken up may add something for more flavor.

Even without the melted butter (trying to cut at least some calories), this is fabulous!  I added a can of Campbell's chicken broth to the water for cooking the potatoes, as suggested in a review.  And it's a breeze to add the cabbage if you use a bag of pre-cut coleslaw, plus the orange of the carrot looks nice.  Anyway, this is a simple dish that is absolutely delicious.  Did I mention that on its own, it makes a complete meal?  A keeper!

Regarding the cabbage versus kale debate:  why not both?  Regarding the amount of bacon:  why not more?  I made this for the first time this year for St. Patrick's Day, and after reading the many comments, I decided to use both cabbage and kale.  I also decided to use more bacon than the recipe called for, because... well, you know... it's bacon!  It was delicious, and the whole family really loved it.  I have made it once since then, and plan on doing so many times in the future.  It was a wonderful complement to my own famous Guinness slow-cooked corned beef.  This will become a staple recipe in our household to replace traditional mashed spuds.  It'll give me a chance to show off my Irish heritage in future meals, even when it's not St. Patrick's Day!

Making this was a lot of fun, and it's hard to mess it up. There are a lot of good variations you can try with this. The last time I made this, I added a whole half a pack of bacon, rather than just 4 slices (I find it easier to dice up the bacon with some kitchen scissors prior to cooking it), reduced the potatoes to about 1 1/2 to 2 lbs of diced red potatoes (with skins), and threw in more cabbage. I used some left over heavy cream instead of milk (sour cream works good too). You can also add in a half a cup of green onions and/or leeks instead of onion.

I made this for our "St. Patty's Day" celebration yesterday...Everyone raved about it. It is so full of taste and easy to make. I followed the advice from other reviewers and used a 16 oz bag of shredded cabbage (cole slaw) which made this recipe even easier to make. Thanks so much for sharing...I will make this every year. Can't wait to eat the left overs tonight.

We love this recipe. I keep it pretty much as is but occasionally I will substitute chopped hot Italian sausage for the bacon. It gives a nice spicey flavour. The next day I fry the leftovers in a pan sprayed with Pam and serve it with fied eggs for breakfast. Not for the cholestrol counters but really tasty!

OHMYGOSH!!!  Awesome recipe!  My husband, who despises cabbage, LOVED this, as did my kids.  I took a few steps to make it a bit healthier, like steaming the cabbage & onions, using butter flavoring instead of actual butter, etc. but the combination was delicious!

Shocked and amazed! My husband has never "liked" mashed potatoes, but loves cabbage...he finished off the pot as a snack the next day! I used the pre-shredded bag of cabbage (for coleslaw)instead of a head and also added sour cream to the mix with double the bacon. It was a great new Irish recipe and I am passing it on to the rest of the O'Dell clan.  Thanks!

Being from Ireland, this is exactly how I grew up have Colcannon.   Since I hate Kale, I'm glad you went with cabbage.  Maybe it depends on what part of Ireland you grew up in.  very simple recipe.  Exactly how my whole family makes it.  We adjust measurements according to how many people are coming for dinner!!  Keeper!!  Thanks

Followed exactly, turned out great. I am serving a Guinness Beef Stew over the top of the colcannon with a side of Irish Soda Bread. I KNOW this will be a new St. Paddy's Day hit for our household :)

This is a good one. Putting it together was delicous and fun. Was strange for everyone at first, but the next thing you know the pot is empty. Thinking about just frying the cabbage and one with some other ingredients to see what happes.

This was really, really good.  I am not a big fan of cooked cabbage but my Irish DH requires corned beef & cabbage in some form for St. Patricks Day.  Since I don't like corned beef either I just made my meal out of this wonderfully delicious Colcannon.  Who knew?  I know have my cabbage recipe from now on!  Thank you, thank you for the post!

Absolutely delicious!  I made this on St. Patrick's Day with our corned beef and cabbage dinner.  My husband and I both thought it was so good, we finished it the next night.  Since then I have made it with ground sausage instead oh bacon, and not used the melted butter, still delicious.  We may never eat a regular mashed potato again.  Great, easy to follow recipe too.  Thanks for posting!

Colcannon is delicious! I made it for a St. Patrick's Day dinner with family and we all loved it! It was better than your typical homemade mashed potatoes with chunks of cabbage and flavorful bacon.  Who doesn't love bacon, right?!

Phenomenal!! I did do a few things different. I upped the bacon as suggested as well as the onion. While the cabbage and onion were sauteing I added Nature's Own seasoning and plenty of black pepper and salt. I found the vegetables to not cook very quickly, so I added about a cup of water while they were cooking. To add flavor, I added a dash of Worchestershire and Liquid Smoke. I let the water cook out and the vegetables were oh so tender. Great all on its own as a main course!

I love his recipe as it is, but I did make some changes the next time that I think made it more to my taste and have gotten rave reviews.  I prepped early: nuked a pound of turkey bacon and tore the slices apart (approx .75 inches) rather than crumble,  smashed the ptotaoes (red with skin on-lazy) and added enough milk to add some moisture,  added some minced garlic to the chopped onion (softened in a little oil)and put it all in a casserole dish. I baked it for approximately 30 minutes before serving.

This is the best version of Colcannon I have found. I have made it this way many times but, have also used leeks instead of onions, and used all the bacon drippings in the mashing of the potatoes, serve with out the melted butter then. Also turnips can be used with the potatoes, strange enough my veggie hating boyfriend loved that better than just straight potatoes. Apples can be chopped and cooked with the onions for a slightly sweeter dish.

Diane's Colcannon Haiku: "Wow, talk about rich! Decadent butter bacon, mixed in potatoes." Not a terribly attractive side dish, but ignoring the appearances, this is a wicked good way to eat mashed potatoes. I think I'll save this for Ye Olde St. Patrick's time of the year b/c I felt guilty w/ every heaping bite that I shoveled in my mouth.

Loved this recipe!! I added turnips to the potatoes and mashed with chicken broth instead of milk and I also added red peppers and an entire head of cabbage since there are 5 in our family. I could've ate the whole pan myself! I will definately make again.

As cabbage lovers, our family is always on the lookout for new ways to use it and this recipe was a great way to use it!  I used vegetarian bacon and it was fabulous.

My fiance and I LOVE this recipe!  When we came back from our first trip to Ireland we searched for a recipe for Colcannon that would bring us back to our trip.  This is definitely it!  It's super easy and the flavor is fabulous.  While sauteeing the cabbage in the bacon grease isn't exactly the healthiest thing in the world, you can't beat the flavor!

Personally, I prefer leeks, but onions really are faster. I have a vegetarian, so we use fake bacon bits, which means cooking the cabbage differently, but this still came out beautifully and we've made it several times since we first found the recipe. It was even a hit at a pot luck in March.

I have a very picky daughter who doesn't like to try new things.  She does love mashed potatoes, so I decided to serve the cabbage and potatoes seperate and let each person mix it themselves.  My husband, younger daughter and myself loved the cabbage so much that we didn't even bother with the potatoes!  The only thing I changed with the cabbage is to drain some of the bacon grease and add some butter.  Needless to say but, the oldest didn't like the cabbage.  Maybe someday we will try it with the potatoes.

This was good.  I thought I had softened my cabbage enough, but it was still a little too al dente for me.  I realized after that my fiance did not cut the stems out as he was chopping.  Great accompaniment to the Guiness Corned Beef.

Wow. HUGE hit with the Irish family gathering. Small variation - added 1/2 C Sour Cream and 1/2 stick of Cream Cheese to the main recipe (with cole slaw and 6 strips of bacon).  I made this the prior to to the dinner and kept it in a covered casserole dish. Heated at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes and came out perfect. My wife HATES cabbage, but LOVED this!

I loved this recipe! It's a total keeper. This was the first time I made it and served it with corned beef for St. Patrick's Day. I didn't have bacon but used some of the corned beef fat to saute the cabbage and onions. It worked out great.

Proving, once again, that bacon makes everything taste good! Who knew that I could get my kids to eat cabbage? I was ready to serve it up before adding the potatoes. The combination of flavors and textures is very nice - plus, it's reasonably easy to make. I left off the final 1/4 cup of butter because it really didn't need it and we certainly don't need the extra fat.

There are so many wonderful reviews for the recipe that I would be only mimicking what most have said but this was delicious!  I had been dying to try it and it was very simple.  The ONLY change I made was to ADD more bacon because as one reviewer stated "you can never have too much bacon" :) We had it for two days with leftovers and my mother even made her leftover colcannon into potato pancakes for dinner the night after St. Patrick's Day and said it was even better! I did finely shred the cabbage to hide it from my kids and it worked! Thanks for posting!

This was part of my St. Patrick's Day themed meal last night. I don't care for cabbage, so I didn't think I would personally care for this dish but I was wrong. It was really good. For convenience, I used a 16 oz bag of shredded cabbage. The only thing I'd do differently next time is to add more bacon because my family loves it.

My mom used to make this when I was a kid, except she used cooked ground beef instead of bacon and added a fair amount of sour cream to make it creamy.  It's basically your favorite mashed potatoes with onions, cabbage and ground beef.  YUM!

Excellent recipe!  I used 3 pounds of red potatoes and left the skins on.  I cheated by using cole slaw simply because I was too lazy to cut up a head of cabbage.  lol  Everyone thought this dish was fabulous.  It was just as good the next day.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this during Christmas, when I volunteered to bring an Irish dish to an international-themed potluck. I didn't make the 'butter well' as suggested, mixing the butter throughout the potatoes instead. I also used a peppered bacon, and even went high-calorie by keeping the bacon drippings in the recipe (my mother groaned in dieting agony when I mentioned this to her). I had to add more salt than called for, but this was still a very good recipe. My friends all loved it, and I still had some leftovers that tasted good for lunch at work.

Diane - this a great way to serve mashed potatoes.  Made on St. Patricks day with our corned beef, and I too wondered what to do with the bacon.  Blended in worked fine with us.  Very tasty.  Then needed something for today, Friday and needed to get rid of the leftover partial head of cabbage.  As we don't eat meat on Fridays, just made the recipe omitting the bacon and it was very tasty.  Will be making again.  Thanks Diane.

The best Colcannon recipe out there. I've made it with the bacon, but I've also made it using diced up ham. I like the ham better. I make this and the Beer Braised Irish Stew for St. Patty's Day.

This is not just for St.P day; I made it for Xmas dinner and my family insists it should be a new tradition and I should make it every year. So good! 1/2 cabbage isn't an exact amount so I did equal parts cabbage to potato and it was a success! I used a lot of pepper and found the bacon was salty enough so didn't add much salt. I left the skin on the potato and don't have a masher so this was a chunky dish rather than mashed. I didn't bother with the pool of butter and, having never tried Colcannon before, it wasn't missed. It's a great way to trick the starchoholics into eating some leafy greens. I won't reserve this for St.P day or Xmas, I will make this all year round and recommend it highly.

These potatoes are absolutely amazing!!!!  I've probably made them 5 times or more by now.  I add minced garlic to the cabbage & onions when they are cooking, but that's just a matter of personal preference.  They would still be 5 stars without it.   Definately give this one a try.  Don't try to make them "healthier", it's not like you're going to eat them every day. For sure a keeper in my house!  Thanks Diane!

Excellent recipe! We actually omitted the bacon to make it vegetarian and it was just as tasty, in my opinion. Quick and easy to make, definitely one we'll do over and over.

This is soo good. I wanted to try something out incase we have a st.patty's day carry in at work. If we do I will be taking this. Next time I make this I would use more bacon crumbles than just 4 slices and season it more than I did. Very filling and very good and it was pretty easy too!

i first used this recipe a few years ago for our neighbourhood St. Patrick's Day Feast.  It is now a tradition on the Sunday Before, and it grows each year.  The only addition I have ever made is the addition of seasoning to all layers.  I salt the water the potatoes boil in, add a little Celtic Grey Salt  and ground mixed peppercorns to the Cabbage and Onions as they brown.  I use the seasoning bacon that you can sometimes find in the mega mart, it's ends and pieces, but works great.  I usually double this recipe, but this year will have to triple it.    This also works great with Fried Chicken, Roast Turkey and Pork Roast.  The only year I didn't make this was the year I had the Irish Stew.

OMG!!  This was so good.  My husband and I really enjoyed this.  After sauteeing the cabbage & onion I threw it in my food processor so that I could sneak it past my kids.  My daughter actually ate it without complaining - I did add a little shredded cheddar cheese to hers.  I took some of the leftovers and added cheese to it as well and fried up mashed potato pancakes that were out of this world.  Thank you for a great recipe. We will definitely be eating this again.

I have never had Colcannon, so I did not know what to expect. I do have to say the meal simply tasted like mash potatoes with cabbage. It was not exceptional in taste. I think that is because we did not use bacon. I do not eat bacon, and I think without the bacon you are a bland meal and that is what we got. Since this meal is reliant on bacon to be good, I would not make this dish again.

Best colcannon I've ever had! Only changes were I added about 1/4 a cup of stock to the cabbage when cooking it and some minced garlic in addition to the onion. Finally,
I didn't have milk, so I used cream with the potatoes.

HUGE hit, will be serving again and again!

This was just okay.  I enjoyed it, but I'm Irish and love potatoes and cabbage.  My husband was just like, "Why in the world would you mess up mashed potatoes by putting cabbage in them?"  It was a lot of work  and no one raved over it.

THIS WAS VERY GOOD, BUT IT LACKED "SOMETHING".  THESE WERE A LITTLE ON THE BLAND SIDE, EVEN AFTER FOLLOWING SUGGESTIONS OF OTHER READERS.  I'M WONDERING IF THEY'LL BE MORE FLAVORFUL AS LEFTOVERS, WHEN THE FLAVORS GET MORE PRONOUNCED.

This was great for St. Patrick's Day and would also be good for any occassion.  I thought that it could use a little salt.  I might try adding a little garlic next time, too.

This was so good, it made me wish I was Irish. Although you classify this as a side dish, it would serve as a very good one-dish meal. Recipe left me wondering what to do with the crumbled bacon, so I folded it in with everything else. This worked out very well.

This is delicious as written but I am intrigued by some of the reviews. I disagree with the review that says cabbage isn't traditional, you must use kale. My 100% Irish family has eaten this with cabbage my whole like and I am 62! PS I am not a fan of kale.

This is SOOOOOOOOOO good!  Made is just for us last night as a trial recipe for next weeks St Patrick’s Day celebration at our Clubhouse.  I will be making enough for 40-50 people.  I should probably make more!

First of all, you can’t give a recipe a lousy rating if you leave out one of the main ingredients and then didn’t like it. You wouldn’t try this if you didn’t eat, or like, potatoes or cabbage, so don’t expect it to be good if you also don’t like or eat bacon. And don’t rate the recipe after you’ve completely changed it. Go post your recipe and see how others like yours. And if you say you’re a Chef and you frequently give poor ratings and bad reviews, you obviously a crappy “chef” and fail at making even simple things that everyone else has great success with. This was excellent colcannon. It has great flavour and is easy to make. You need to use all the ingredients because there aren’t many ingredients in it to begin with. I’m not Irish, but my ex husband is and I still make this for him and my son on St. Patrick’s Day and quiche on Nee Year’s.

Colcannon can, and does; have many variations beyond smash with cabbage . This version is REALLY good as is. I mean "who doesn't like bacon" ! 
Especially good/safe if having guests.

When I first had this I loved it as written,then after the traditional corn beef and cabbage dinner I decided to use the leftover corned beef instead of the bacon;equally delicious.I've made it both ways since.

I have always wanted to make this recipe, and finally did when I saw this one!  Did it all by the book and it was absolutely delicious!  I would love to know how someone in 2007 used the leftovers...I am thinking of making potatoe pancakes!

This is an excellent recipe.  I tried it for the first time this year on St. Patricks Day, and it was a huge hit.  I did everything just as the recipe directed except I didn't add the butter at the end - a little too much fat and I figure people can add butter on their own if they desire.  This will become a must on St. Patricks Day and I'm sure Ill make it for other meals as well.  YUM! YUM! YUM!   DKellerFish

As a vegetarian, I skipped the bacon, but it didn't matter one bit.  I don't even care that it wasn't "traditional" because I am one of the few that isn't a kale lover.  It is lovely, a nice St. Patrick's Day treat. Family loves potatoes most any way, but this is a nice change up.

LIKED it on the whole.I did not rate the recipe as I changed it having used some slices of smoked SAUSAGES instead of bacon.Frankly speaking, I will stick to my old "cabbage"recipe - with potatoes CUBED,no milk, sausages of different kinds, and TOMATO PASTE, which the reviewed recipe lacks.:)

I had never tried any recipe like this before. Made it exactly as described. At first I was really underwhelmed. It wasn't bad just kinda blah. However, there was a fair bit left over and I really liked it the second day. I will embarrass myself and admit that I ate roughly 1/3 of the batch myself for lunch, so I give it 4 stars rather than the original 3 I had planned because anything that reheats well is great in my book.

Grew up eating my mother's colcannon and it rocked hard! I'm not sure if what I'm making is still colcannon because I strayed from this recipe a little bit. When I boil the potatoes, I thrown onions and garlic in the water, with salt. I hate passing up an opportunity for flavor! Then I add sour cream to the mashed potato part, too. And instead of milk, I use heavy cream. More bacon is never a crime at my table, either. So, if you still consider it colcannon, after my changes, then this is the best colcannon, outside of Belfast!!

My bf & St. Patty's day guests LOVED this recipe!!! Definitley no leftovers... Sautéd the onions & cabbage with the salt & pepper to enhance flavor. I also did not Have bacon but had kilbasa sausage so I used that instead & was very pleased- which is why I only gave 4 stars. By bf loved it so much- he asked me to make a couple of days later!

I sauteed the onion up quite a bit before adding the cabbage. My kids don't like the taste of raw onion. To try and save on fat I used the pre-cooked real bacon bits found in a jar. I stirred them into store bought coleslaw mix.  For fat I added roasted garlic olive oil.  This was good and super easy to throw together.  I added some parsely for some extra green in our Irish meal. For extra richness I used fat-free 1/2 and 1/2 in place of the milk. I did bother to add any butter in the end.

Great option to blend traditional St Patty's day sides into one...and pretty much the only way you can get me to eat cooked cabbage! Hahaha.  This is a great side dish and I've made it several times over the past few years.

This was EXCELLENT.  The only change I made was to add salt (about 1.5 teaspoons) to the water in which the potatoes were cooked--I find it's impossible to get potatoes salty enough if you don't add salt to the cooking water.    I know I'll miss the flavor, but to economize on cholesterol, next time I may use canola oil to cook the cabbage/onion, and add bottled REAL bacon bits.  This would also make the recipe a little faster to prepare.    However, I don't think the FLAVOR of the original can be improved upon, and I regret it when I have to make changes like this!

I LOVE this!  I first tried it for St. Patty's Day and now I just love it!  Be sure to make it a day ahead so the flavors can "mingle".

Just made these for an Irish party and they were wonderful!! I loved the idea of dressing up standard mashed potatoes. I made these as a side dish for the "Beef and Irish Stout Stew" and the flavors worked nicely together. I wouldn't suggest topping these with stew, they are more of a stand alone type side dish. The flavors are fantastic together and my guests really got excited when they saw the bacon (especially the guys ;)). I'll be making these again soon with chicken, pork, etc.

This was good, but seemed to lack something.  It was much better reheated the next day.  Maybe the flavors had more time to blend.

This is FABULOUS - I used the coleslaw mix like some other reveiwers suggested and it made it so much simpler.  I used butter but forgot the milk while mashing my potatoes so it was a little stiff, but the next day the potatoes heated up better than I think they would have if I had added milk.  I did top the colcannon with pats of butter for serving too!!! Thanks for this recipe Diane!

Fabulous!  This was great, everybody loved it. Followed the directions as written.  Used a medium sauce pan to boil and mash the potatoes and then a dutch oven to cook the bacon and saute the veggies, this reduced the number of pots and pans to clean up. The only issues was that  this dish takes longer than 20 minutes to make. I would say it takes a solid 30 minutes to make this dish.  What was leftover, and that was not much, was used as a layer of Rueben Sandwiches the next day.  Thanks for sharing this!

This is a really good recipe and my whole family loves it.  I added sliced smoked sausage instead of the bacon to make it a main course.

My husband said that this was by far the best mashed potatoes he has ever eaten! I used finely chopped leeks sauteed with the cabbage (also finely chopped) instead of the onion. The leek and cabbage mixture was a little dry while sauteing in the small amount of bacon fat, so instead of adding more fat, I added a little whole milk to moisten while simmering. This worked very well to soften the vegetables. The addition of pepper at the end made a big difference to the taste. Salt was not necessary due to the bacon (I added more bacon than recommended)I fried the bacon until just before it started to crisp up, so it was still soft so that it blended with the other textures when stirred through.

I took this to an Irish-theme dinner party on Friday and it was a hit, with some tweaks:  I used 6 strips of bacon, with an additional 2 strips to crumble on top.  Added 2T minced garlic towards end of onion/cabbage step.  Definitely use a lid to cook onion/cabbage or cabbage stays too crunchy before it starts to brown.  Added 1/2C light sour cream when mashing potatoes.  Garnished with chives.  Without these changes, even with plenty of salt, this was a little bland.  But with them, it was delish!

This dish is simply everything that is good in this world put in one bowl and topped with a slice of heaven (melted butter).  The only thing is that the onions still had a little too much texture next time I make this (after a solid month of dieting) I will give the onions maybe a minute or two before adding the cabbage.  I did use fresh cabbage myself just cause it's like dirt cheap and personally I like to cut my own vegetables before using them.

My SO and I love cabbage and potatoes. Who doesn't love bacon? I saw this recipe and debated about trying it because I thought we would miss our steamed cabbage with our corned beef. Well, after 1 bite, we never looked back!! I followed the recipe exactly-well except I used low fat buttermilk in the potatoes (cause I happened to have some). This was GREAT!! I don't think I'll ever make anything else for St Paddy's Day again!! I also used the little bit of leftovers in my leftover corned beef that I chopped and fried up the next day--made a wonderful and easy hash-just fried some eggs and we had dinner!

This recipe sounded like it would be wonderful... and it didn't disappoint us! It was awesome! I used 6 pieces of bacon as other reviewers suggested, and I added a little more butter when making the mashed potatoes. Other than those two small changes, I followed the recipe. This dish was a nice change from the normal cabbage and potatoes cooked in with the corned beef. I can't wait to have leftovers. Great St. Patty's day meal, thanks for sharing!

Colcannon, where have you been all my life?  I made beef stew for St. Paddy's Day and left out the potatoes so I could try this.  I saute'ed the cabbage w/onion in olive oil/butter because I forgot about the bacon drippings...a bit healthier I guess.  Sooo good.  We poured beef stew over this, then dropped a spoon of sour cream over top.  My husband is Italian (usually doesn't like Irish food)and he loved it!

An interesting twist on mashed potatoes, very hearty and filling.  Only had 1.5 lbs potatoes to use (baby dutch gold) and because they were very small potates, I just left the skins on.  I also doubled the amount of bacon used.  I didn't make a well for the butter, I just mixed the butter in throughout.  I ate with some juice from the corned beef I had cooked in the crock pot with a bottle of Guiness.  Made the Colcannon nice and juicy.  These are too heavy to serve with traditional gravy.

Very good. I used butter substitute instead of butter and added it to the potatoes with the hot milk. Otherwise I stuck to the recipe. Would be a great side with corned beef. 4 out of 5 because there is nothing super WOW about this dish. It is comfort food.

Sorry - I can only give these 3 stars.  I made the stuffed cabbage rolls on this site and had some leftover cabbage so decided to make these to go along - (never can have too much cabbage).  Followed the recipe but added a little bit of grated carrot as the meal was a little plain looking.  Just sauteed the carrot in with the other veggies.  I did add a bit of garlic but other than that did everything the same.  I found them a little bland but were good with the sauce from the cabbage rolls.  I'm thinking they need a little something - more spices and definitely more butter.  I liked the garlic smashed potato recipe better.

Magically Delicious!

I used about 3/4 of a bag of coleslaw mix and was glad I did since it added some nice color to the dish.  This was so amazing that even my potato-hating middle child had seconds!

A very tasty recipe! A few modifications: I added garlic to the onions and endive to the cabbage (not creative culinary thinking, just had leftover veg in the fridge); I also added a dash of cream cheese, and a couple of handfuls of shredded goat's cheese to the mashed potatoes. Yummy!

Very good. My husband and I had colcannon last year when we were in Ireland on vacation. This was just as good as I remembered it. My husband usually doesn't care for leftovers, but he polished these off.

We made this on St. Patrick's Day, to go along with our corned beef dinner.  The pot wasn't big enough to accomodate all the vegies plus potatoes, so I made this.  THE BEST! From now on I won't even think about cooking the potatoes with everything else - this is our permanent side dish with corned beef boiled dinner.  Excellent.  Thank you.

This is delicious.  I usually make colcannon without bacon, and this added a nice touch.  Even my husband and his son, who normally won't touch cabbage in anything, loved this.  I used the packaged partially-cooked bacon and added a bit of olive oil to the pan to cook the cabbage and onion.

Fantastic! Made it for St. Patty's Day dinner and it was great! The only changes I made were to substitute buttermilk for the milk and use a package of pre-shredded cabbage 
(coleslaw mix). Thanks - I'll be making this every year!

I really liked this, although I made quite a few alterations. I used 1/3 potatoes and 2/3 cauliflower in this, left out the milk, used 2T of lite  margarine and 4 slices of turkey bacon. Just delicious. I will be making this again!

This was strangely good. I had my doubts but after mixing the potatoes and cabbage saute together we were pleasantly surprised. I also added a black pepper/garlic seasoning with good results. Thank you.

This is a great recipe. My suggestion is to make your mashed potatoes as usual and add sauteed cabbage and onions. Bacon is optional.

Great recipe!  I used just about 3 pounds of potatoes, 1/2 pound of bacon, 1/2 package of Classic Cole Slaw mix (instead of cabbage alone), a large onion, milk & a stick of margarine.  I also cooked & mixed everything as the recipe states but I mixed the margarine in when mashing the potatoes instead of making a well in the center.  We both loved it with Guinness Corned Beef recipe also on this site.

I haven' actually made this dish yet, but it sounds wonderful.  One question, what do we do with the crumbled bacon.  The recipe doesn;t say, but I assume we sprinkle it on the finished dish.  Thanks

This was excellent. Made it without bacon bits but used bacon fat I had saved.  I also used leftover instant mashed potatoes I had. It was still delish despite my shortcomings. Probably even better with real potatoes and bacon pieces!

So good.  SOOOO easy.  I cheated a little.  I made my bacon in the microwave between two sheets of paper towels, but I always have a jar of bacon fat in the fridge.  Made them on St. Paddy's Day with russet potatoes (the bests) and then two days ago with red potatoes.  Husband and guests loved it.  Gave out recipe to a lot of people.  Just a FYI, if people are not too crazy about cabbage, just chop it up a bit finer than you would normally or add a bit less.  Thank you DianeF for sharing your recipe.

Delicious, a keeper for sure.  I made no changes.  My husband, who isn't a fan of cooked cabbage,  says this is his new favorite way to eat mashed potatoes and keeps saying we don't have to make this just for St. Patrick's Day.

Couldn't use the bacon (due to some guests' religious restrictions), but made some on the side to crumble on afterwards.   Also added a couple of tablespoons of cream cheese and sour  cream.  Yummmmmmmy.

This recipe was so simple and easy to follow.  I used red onions to give it extra color. Nice and tasty, and easily modified to suit your taste with extra seasonings.  I'll definitely make this again and keep the recipe!

I followed the recipe, but used turkey bacon and 1% milk to offset the butter. ?? Initially it was hard to get my head around cabbage in mashed potatoes, but very glad I tried it.  I’ll definitely make It again.

Absolutely positively delicious!!  This is the best of St. Patrick's Day food all in one dish.   The only downer was that people didn't take it at first because it doesn't look like the most appealing dish.  However, once a couple of people tried it and went crazy over how good it was, there was a mad dash for the bowl.  LOL.

Love this recipe for colcannon. It's easy to make, but tastes like all-day cooking comfort food. My Irish dad isn't really a fan of cabbage (go figure), but even he liked it. I make this only on St. Paddy's Day because it's pretty ladened with fat, but catch myself craving a dish throughout the year. I make this recipe as written and never have leftovers, it's that good.

I've never heard of this dish but needed something to use up my potatoes and cabbage.  I was intrigued by all the great reviews so wanted to give it a try.  I'm amazed at how good this was!  I used turkey bacon and only had 3 pieces..... I can see how the bacon flavor would enhance the overall dish but it could be omitted and still be awesome.  Even the kids loved this.  I followed chef johns mashed potato recipe for that part of this dish as there is just no beating his method!  So the butter was just mixed into the mashed potatoes-  no reason to make a well.  Amazing.

I made this for dinner tonight.  I followed the recipe except I added 2 cloves of garlic as others recommended. It was delicious. The bacon gave it a nice flavor. I have make Colcannon every year for  St Patty's. This was by far the best recipe. I also used red potatoes and as I always do left the skin on.  I will definitely use this recipe for now on.

As stated, it was wonderful and made a big hit.  I cooked the bacon in an electric skillet then poured off most of the bacon fat.  Then I cooked the cabbage and onion in the same pan - scraping off all of the bacon bits in the pan.  The flavor of the cabbage was wonderful.  I brought it to a pot luck St. Patrick's Day party and I brought home an empty dish. Will definitely make it again.

I served this with meatloaf.  WOW!  What a hit!  I will make this over and over again.  I used six pieces of bacon, and will probably use eight next time, but I love bacon.  I dumped half the bacon grease before cooking cabbage and onions.  Thank you for this great recipe!

I used the bagged coleslaw mix as well.  It was wonderful.  I made this as a side to corned beef for St. Pat's Day.  I would make this again as a side dish to any meat.

Fantastic dish! I used baby spinach instead of cabbage (personal preference) and it was delicious!  I also had a happy accident the first time I made it and it turned out great; if you add 1 cup of buttermilk and 2 cups of regular milk this makes an excellent potato soup! I was so upset for mixing the two recipes I was making, but the soup was the favorite of the night!

This was soooo good!  I served it for St. Patrick's Day and it was a big hit.  The only thing I changed was I used buttermilk instead of milk because my husband and I tried a sample both ways and we both liked the buttermilk in it better.

I used 1/2 lb diced ham and pancetta, added a clove of minced garlic, 3/4 tsp of white pepper, 2 tbsp parsley flakes (don't have fresh), to cook with the cabbage, and then added 3 green onions sliced in the last few min. I steamed the potatoes with skins on 30 min, removed the skins and made mashed potatoes, adding 3/4 tsp salt, and then served the cabbage mixture on top of the mashed potatoes.  Everyone had 2nds, so in my book, that gets 5 stars

Delicious! The bacon really added something. It made quite a bit. The morning after we made it, we added some egg, flour, cheese and chives and fried up some colcannon pancakes!

Filling comfort food, but bland.  Bacon was good, but it needed some spice other than salt and pepper.  Maybe garlic?

Made this for the first time last St. Patrick's day. We LOVE this and eat it at least once a week now. Right now it is especially good as I have potatoes, onion, and fresh cabbage from my garden. We are vegetarian so I simply leave out the bacon and add extra salt.

Diane thank you for posting a colcannon recipe that did not involve boiling the meat or cabbage! unfortunately too many cooks are hell bent on boiling the flavor right out of their food, and adding bland on top of bland, and relying on salt to give it any amount of flavor whatsoever. when you saute the cabbage in the bacon drippings, it adds a heavenly layer of flavor and it is absolutely a joy on the taste buds. Please people, sautee the cabbage like Dianne suggests, and you will never cook "traditional" Irish Colcannon again.

I used leeks instead of onion but other than that followed the recipe.  I have never made this with cabbage before.  I have always used kale which I think I prefer.  This was very good too though and went well with corned beef for St Patty's

This is ABSOLUTELY one of the BEST dishes I've ever made/had!! My entire family LOVES it!! I used some Soul Food Seasoning on the Cabbage used lots of Vidalia onions!! And You GOTTA use the bacon. I also used a 1lb of groung sausage, browned & drained. Yummy what a dish. I use at least 8-10 med sized potatoes & 1/2-3/4 stick of butter & prob. close to a cup of milk, basically I doubled the entire recipe!! Will make again AND again!! We don't just have for St. Patty's day, it's an EVERY day dish for us!!

We really liked this for a change from our regular New Year's Day cabbage.  A couple of days prior to making this dish I made sour cream, garlic mashed potatoes and doubled the recipe to use with this one.

This was very good. I made it the day after St. Patrick's day to serve as a side and help stretch the leftover corned beef and cabbage from St. Pat's Day itself. I could also see it with the leftover corned beef chunks added to it.

In the past, I always quartered a small head of cabbage and put it in the crock pot with the corned beef.  My husband would eat it, but wasn't crazy about it.  This year I used your recipe and he was utterly elated with it.  Actually, it resembles something Polish rather than Irish, but it sure is wonderful!

WOW! YUM!  not that it made it "healthy" but I omitted the butter.  Instead of sliced bacon, I used end pieces, about 1 cup of them chopped up.  It was so, so, good.  I've made Colcannon a number of times, but this was the bomb and my husband and daughter both gobbled it up then asked for seconds :-)

I made this side dish for a St. Patrick's day pot luck at work. It was an instant success!! I was complimented on how authentic and traditional it was and how good it tasted! It was really easy to make and it took just a little under an hour (sorry, I'm a beginners' cook). I did not use the raw cabbage, instead using half a bag of coleslaw mix and using only one onion. After cooking the bacon I had too much fat drippings left over in the pan so I also tossed out half of it, and while cooking the onions and coleslaw I did cover the pan (it made it so much easier). Needless to say, the dish was a total hit and I would definitely make it again. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe.

I really enjoyed this dish.  I sauteed 2 cloves of garlic with the onion and added a grated carrot for color and to add another veggie. I did not add butter at the end but did have to add butter to the pan when cooking the cabbage. A good way to get lots of vegetables into the menu

I made this for St. Patrick's Day last year and it was a huge hit. I was told to make it again. It will become a family tradition to make every year on St. Patty's day for sure.

Fantastic, especially with leeks and kale sauteed in the bacon fat. Easy and so flavorful.

Made it without the bacon this time but I can imagine that it would be 1000 times better with bacon....lots of bacon!

I don't like cabbage, but I wanted to make a tradtional St. Patty's Day meal.  I made two sides, and this one was the one everyone ate (including me).  Amazing.  I did add a little more bacon because it's bacon.  There was a little left over, but I ate it that night.  I will be making double batches of thes from now on.

This is so delicious!  I followed the advice of others and used the shredded cabbage for coleslaw.  Great timesaver!  I also sauted the cabbage in some of the corned beef juices that I was cooking.  It tastes almost like bacon and potato perogie filling.  BTW my husband is not a veggie eater and he loved it.  He even had seconds, ate leftovers, and requested that I not make it only for St. Patty's day. Thanks Diane!!!

We enjoyed this for St. Ptrick's Day, it is a nice dish for when you want potatoes and cabbage.  The bacon gives the dish a nice flavor, very different from regular mashed potatoes.

I think a little more bacon (maybe 6 slices) would make this even better.  Be sure to finely chop the cabbage. I used larger slices and thought it would have been better it cabbage was finely chopped.  Delicious!

Made this for St. Patrick's Day.  Followed the directions as written, except I used a bag of shredded cabbage instead of shredding my own.  My husband shoveled it in; LOVED IT!  My 5 year old ate it but wasn't as crazy about it.  The next time I make this with Corned Beef I will cut down on the amount of butter and just use some when I am mashing the potatoes.  I love butter!  But even for a butter lover this was a bit excessive even for me.

I make a dish with cabbage, bacon, and onions that my children call "Skillet Cabbage".  It is almost identical to step #2 in this recipe, except I add salt.  So, when I saw this recipe combining mashed potatoes with "Skillet Cabbage", I knew it HAD to be a winner.  I made it to go with our corned beef for St. Patrick's Day dinner yesterday and my kids were sad that I hadn't made more (because there are only three of us, I cut the recipe in half, but I still used 4 slices of bacon)!  This will definitely become part of our regular meal rotation.  Thanks Diane!

This was good and fairly easy to make.  I probably used 7 pieces of bacon instead of 4.  Kept everything else the same.  Really enjoyed it and look forward to making it again.

Deeeee-lish!  I made this for St. Patty's Day dinner, with kale, and served with roasted lamb.  It was a hit!  My husband, bless him, hates his veg, but the kale was integrated so nicely, and the bacon certainly makes it go down easy!

My husband and I enjoyed this dish.  I knew it was going to be a challange to sell it to the kids so I decided to keep the mashed potatos seperate from cabbage mixture.   The separate dish solution worked well for my family.  My husband and I ate the cabbage and potato mixtures together, my daughter (who does not like potatos) ate several helpings of the cabbage mixture and my son (who does not care for vegetables) at least tried the cabbage but was happier just eating the potatos.  So it was a winning situation for everyone.  The only other change I made was to sprinkle  the cabbage mixture with durkee french onions just before serving which added a nice crunch. I will make this again.

This is an awesome recipe. I just made it today for St. Patty's Day! I put in a casserole dish to warm up later for dinner. I added some shredded sharp cheddar to the top. I can't wait for dinner tonight with the family!

This was good.  I "healthified" this recipe by using center cut bacon, low-fat milk, and no butter.  It probably could've used another slice or two of bacon, though, as the 4 slices seemed to get lost among all the potatoes and cabbage.  This made a lot (just two of us), so I might transform the leftovers into a potato pancake-type thing.

I served this over the weekend when my Irish mother-in-law came for a visit.  Not only did she love it, everyone did.  Even my two very picky teenage boys.  I also used a 16 oz. package of slaw mox for the cabbage.  It worked out fantastically!

Since we're vegan, I left out the milk and bacon and used earth balance instead of butter. However, I added a couple shakes of liquid smoke to impart a smokey flavor similar to that imparted by the omitted bacon. It was delish!

YUM!  This was soooo good.  No need to make any changes.  I made the mistake of using turkey bacon to be healthy, but it didn't give off enough grease to saute the cabbage.  I ended up adding olive oil anyways, so next time I'll use regular bacon.  The sauted cabbage was so good that I set some aside for a future side dish. My husband only eats Mexican food (if you can't eat it with a tortilla, it's not worth eating!) so I didn't even think he'd try it.  But he did and he even asked for seconds!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

I LOVE Colcannon.  I keep mine really simple for the best flavor. I mix my potatoes with some chicken stock and mayo for creaminess, and only add chopped boiled cabbage and use small chunks of ham instead of bacon. I LOVE the flavor of the ham in that...   a classic dish that is so open for interpretation that it's amazing!

Very good. I added fresh parsley, poultry seasoning, celery seeds, and instead of topping it with butter, I topped with sour cream. This is very similar to a recipe my german mother makes - I would add caraway if I had any on hand. I used thick slices of frozen thansgiving ham instead of bacon for a heartier and more flavorful bite.

This was great - and exactly the kind of homey meal I was looking for. I don't eat pork, so I made it vegetarian with fantastic results by adding a clove of garlic, a splash of Liquid Smoke, and I used sour cream instead of milk to make it a bit heartier. Thanks for the recipe!

I hunted down this specific recipe a couple months back when I did a Dinner Theme night. I love mashed potatoes, but I wanted something a little different. When I mashed my potatoes, I mashed them with sour cream and butter and plenty of salt. I cut the cooked cabbage into bits and folded it into the mashed potatoes, to give it a variety of textures. This was such a hit that I now make it at least once a month, especially with ham on the side. My husband isn't a fan of cabbage but he raves about these potatoes and never fails to return for seconds or sometimes thirds. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I had never tasted this dish, so I didn't know what to expect, but it was absolutely amazing!  I doubled the bacon, and used 1 cup sour cream in place of the milk (which is how I make mashed potatoes), but other than that, made the recipe exactly as stated.  I don't think I will ever be able to eat regular mashed potatoes again!  Thank you, Diane!

Fantastic!  I made it for St. Patricks Day for the first time, I loved it!  Just the right blend of flavors, I didn't cook the cabbage very long, though so it was tender but still a bit crunchy, I think I'll cook it a bit softer next time.

Fixed for St. Patrick's Day - great side dish!  Everyone liked it even the "pickey" eaters!

I did 8 slices of bacon, 1/4 cup skim milk & 1/4 cup heavy cream and threw in some shredded carrots for color.  It could have used a little bit more garlic.

I also made this the night before.  I set it out to room temperature for about an hour and then added the milk & cream.  I warmed through at 350 degrees for about 40 minutes.

This was good, but needed some more spice. I didn't add the butter at the end because it already had all that bacon grease, maybe that would have helped. I put the cabbage and onions in my food processsor before mixing with the potatos. I personally think it would have been better without doing that but others liked that it was all mashed. I will try again for just us leaving as is and add the butter along with more spices. I made a shepherd's pie with the leftovers and added fresh pepper, seasoning salt, paprika and lots of garlic and it was awesome!

Wonderful. I really love this recipe. The last time I made a meatloaf, I folded thawed out frozen peas into it, and everyone after the intial shock of seeing it, went wild about the flavor.

I made this for Thanksgiving with Perfect Turkey (from this site) and it was great. I didn't end up adding all of the cabbage mixture to the potatoes because I felt like my family wouldn't like it. I think I added about half of it. But everyone loved the potatoes. I'll definitely make this again.

I can't rate this yet as I have not tried it.  But while on a tall ship voyage crossing the atlantic I came upon something similar to this which the British called Bubble and Squeek.  Only difference seems to be the bacon and the B&S had a bit of white mild cheese in the mixture.  I quite liked it as I am sure I will this.

A great side dish and wonderful aleternative to regular mashed potatoes, but it was time consuming.  I think I will just stick to basic mashed potatoes.  I did enjoy trying them though.  Thank you!

5 for both ease and taste. I ended up using a combination of red/white onion since I had very little white onion left. I also ended up using some maple flavored bacon, which adds a nice touch! In the end, I think I should have cut the cabbage much smaller than I had. Easy to make and very filling! Will post pictures soon.

Yum!  Even my picky 5 yr old liked it, and the teenager went back for seconds!  Great addition to my St. Patty's Day birthday dinner.  I did use kale instead of cabbage as that seemed more traditional, will try with cabbage next time.

Excellent recipe.... I used center cut bacon (for less fat) and I added garlic powder (to taste) at the same time I added salt to the potatoes (gave it a little more depth). YUM YUM!!! Also, this recipe doubled nicely. I accompanied this recipe with the "Guinness(R) Corned Beef" recipe on this site and the meal was spectacular!

Made this for St. Pat's day dinner with a corned beef cooked in the crock pot. I changed a couple of things...my daughter is very allergic to potatoes.  She can't even be in the house when I cook them... So I used a package of Simply Potatoes mashed.  They worked great.  I did everything else according to the recipe.  Made them ahead, placed in casserole and heated in oven when we were ready to eat.  Everyone loved them.  Has anyone tried them with a little cheese on top?  Might be tasty!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Very good!  I haven't ever made this before but I was looking for an Irish dish to make and this was perfect.  I would have added a little extra cabbage, however. It called for "1/2 small head of cabbage" and i don't think i used enough.  I put this on top of a shepherds pie, rather than plain Mashed taters! Very good!

Absolutely delish!  Total surprise to me.  Can't wait til hubby gets home to try it because he is a true mashed potato lover.  And I've always "smothered" my cabbage (ham seasoning, onions, salt pepper & cabbage), so this was similar.  Together they're wonderful.

Super Yummy!  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly and WOW I was hooked.  The second time I made it, I had no fresh potatoes in the house so I used (horrors) instant that I keep on hand for emergencies.  I also used some "sweet meat" given to me by a neighbor instead of the bacon, and threw in some garlic.  I don't know what I was thinking because I topped it with a bit of finely shredded Cheddar cheese.  Well this served as my main dish that night - and I could have eaten the whole pot.  Definitely a keeper - and not just for St. Paddy's Day.  Thanks, Diane!

Added more cabbage and more bacon.  Poured some of the beef drippings into the melted butter that I made on the stove.

We love a good boiled corned beef dinner with everything as traditional cooked in the same pot but this was a great dish to change up the mix.  This was delicious and we will probably use this recipe from now on for our boiled dinners and not just on St. Patrick's Day!!!!!!

AMAZING!!  Made a double batch (really didn't measure well) and it came out delicious!!   The cabbage adds amazing flavor and the bacon adds salt and savory flavor!!  I can see it will be a regular in our house!!

Made this for a St. Patrick’s Day Party for 30 people. Used a large cabbage, 2 onions and a 1 1/2 lbs of good slab bacon. I have made this several times with regular potatoes, but this time I did the unthinkable. I used 3 family packs of Idahoan instant potatoes and you could not tell the difference.

I made this for St. Patrick's Day and it was a huge hit. I used half and half instead of milk.  Everyone raved about this dish, which I had never had before.  Next year I will make this and skip the boiled potatoes and steamed cabbage. Wow!

This is a delicious, classic combination.  I add chopped chives and parsley to ramp up the green factor.

It was delicious! I used this recipe as a starting point because I was only cooking for myself today and didn’t want to make too much. 

I used kale, cabbage, and onion in mine! I was impatient and it was only ~mostly~ cooked through and I still enjoyed every bite. 

Also, I didn’t add butter at the end bc of health restrictions, but I’m sure a bit on top would be LOVELY!

I was checking out colcannon recipes because I hadn't made it in a couple of  years. This one sounded good, but I wanted to dig out my favorite one from a few years ago. Guess what! "Diane's Colcannon" So I'm definitely sticking with it this year. (I had marked it 5 stars.) Good job, DIane!

This was the first time that our family has had Colcannon Potatoes and we weren't disappointed!  Followed the recipe for the most part, except like a number of reviewers, added a bit more bacon,  just cause.

Thank you so much for this recipe.  I'm sure these potatoes will become a special occasion  menu regular.

The only thing I did differently was ad a couple extra strips of bacon, other than that, no changes.
My family really enjoyed it with meatloaf and I will be making it again.
Thank you!

My mother mentioned this dish to me  many years ago.  This was the first time I have made it.  I used only half of the bacon fat to cook the cabbage and onions.  I also cooked the potatoes whole, in their skins, as it seems to add more  potato flavor.  Peeled them after they were done.  It was a big hit with my menfolk, and I liked it, too.  It seems important to get the salt level right, so taste before you serve.

I made this as directed but I did add a spoonful of minced garlic from a jar to the cabbage and onion while cooking.  i doubled the recipe.  It was absolutely delicious and I plan to take another reviewers advice and make shepards pie with the leftovers.  This is absolutely a keeper.  Thanks Diane for the recipe

Leftover potatoes made yummy potato pancakes the next day (although difficult to turn and hang together without a binding agent like an egg). Fried in a skillet and eaten with a dollop of sour cream. Would also be good with a little applesauce.

This was the hands down winner at the St. Patrick's Day feast this year.  The only change I made was adding some cheese  into mixture as well as for top.  This has been requested as a staple at family dinners.  Delicious!!

Absolutely luscious...fabulous!  Per several suggestions, I upped the bacon to 6 slices and used a 14 oz. bag of prepared cole slaw mix (cabbage + carrots.) I sauteed the onions in the bacon grease about 3 minutes before adding the cabbage mix. Used 3 large russet potatoes and 2 medium yellow potatoes, so it was a bit more than 2-1/2 pounds.  Plus a bought a hand-masher just for this.  Worked well to prepare it right before our dinner guests arrived, and kept in a warming oven during cocktails.  This will certainly be a centerpiece dish to all future St. Patrick's Day dinners....plus extra times throughout the year.

These are true comfort food. This was the first time I ever had or made colcannon. I had heard that it was good so I decided to try it for St. Patrick's Day. My family really enjoyed it! The only thing that I did wrong was that I didn't remove more of the white part near the stemof the cabbage so while the greenish parts were perfectly cooked the white parts were a bit tough. This was a dish of delish!  Thanks for posting the recipe!

Made exactly according to recipe using thick sliced bacon.  This went so well with corned beef, honey glazed carrots and cornbread.  Can't wait to make again!

I made this dish as is except I mashed the butter into the potatoes before adding the bacon and cabbage. This is so good! It's a great way to use up the cabbage from the garden. My husband wrinkled up his nose when I told him what I was making. He ended up having 3 helpings and asked me to keep this recipe. Great recipe, thank you!

I love colcannon, If you don't know what it is and have never  tried it, you owe it to yourself to become familiar with it.  I guarantee you will love it too!
The creaminess of the potatoes and the different textures from the onions, cabbage and bacon takes the humble mashed potato  in a whole different direction.  I HIGHLY recommend this dish!

I made this for a large St. Pattys party. Everything I cook for this party is traditional Irish. This dish was very popular. Lots of people asked me what it was and what was in it. I made it exactly as listed. I cooked it all and then add it to a crockpot and left it on warm to keep it warm for the party. I made the mashed potatoes the night before and cooked bacon and cabbage the next morning and added it in. It all worked out just fine.

I make this every year to accompany our corned beef for St. Patrick's' Day.  I make it once a year and daydream about it the rest of the year.  For such a simple dish it's so perfect and delicious.

This recipe is perfect as is and is very easy to modify to your family's taste.  This was the third time I prepared this recipe and for my family's taste, we like it with more cabbage (about half of a large head in 3.5 lbs of potatoes), green onions instead of regular and no bacon, since we had it with braised corned beef (also on AR).  We have had with grilled salmon  and roast beef in the past and use the bacon, along with following the recommended cabbage amounts.  This is a great way to get non cabbage eaters to consume it without complaint!  Oh, and if I'm feeling lazy, I just throw the chopped cabbage into the microwave for a couple of minutes,  especially if I'm not using bacon.

Recipes was awesome! Added extra bacon and discarded the drippings. I used olive oil to saute the vegetables, used only half of the butter and mixed it in the mash. Used this as a side to my ribs and it was great!

This is a great side dish with any meat.  Instead of mashing the potatoes, I par boil them and add to the pan with the cabbage and onion. It may not be original Irish, but one less step for me and I can get dinner on the table that much sooner.  I also sauteed the onions slightly before adding the potatoes and cabbage.  You won't be using the milk, but be sure to add the butter to the pan just before serving.

Great recipe! Guaranteed crowd pleased which is easily modified to suit tastes or ingredients on hand, or just to change it up.  I have prepared this several times, both with traditional main dishes and as an accompaniment to more traditional American fare such as ham and green beans.  My family loves it every time and I have learned to make as big a dish as I can manage to ensure adequate leftovers for lunches, etc.  It is a great way to incorporate an extra veggie into the meal via cabbage or kale.  The leftovers taste almost better than the original--these never sit around long in the fridge!

My husband was not particularly looking forward to this. I told him that it was mashed potatoes and cabbage. He frowned. I said, "It has bacon." He gave me a sneer. But when the entire dish was completed, he LOVED it. He isn't a savage, after all. He even mashed the potatoes!

Very interesting & very tasty. Reminded me how much I like cabbage.  My family liked it as much as I did.  Which is surprising, because they are so picky.  I loved thinking about my Irish relatives eating this in the Old Country.  Made me feel connected. Weird, maybe I was just missing my Grandma.

Made exactly as is. Great little side although I ended up eating only this and a salad for dinner. Next time I would add double the bacon. It's not necessary to do so but I love bacon!

I made this recipe again tonight, it's usually reserved for St. Patrick's day but I had a huge head of cabbage in my CSA box this week. It turned out amazing as always! I used red potatoes and extra bacon. I served it with Beer-Baked Irish Beef Stew (also usually reserved for St. Pat's). I don't always make these two dishes together, but I should. They are amazing together.

I made half the recipe for 4 servings and the family loved it. This was our first time eating Colcannon. Even my mashed potato-purist daughter liked it. I fried the cabbage enough to caramelize some pieces, & even sprinkled a tiny bit of brown sugar on top before covering the pan. I will definitely make this again.

This is a very nice dish.  I have a knack for growing cabbage and always looking for a new dish to use it in.  You can only give away so much.  All I added was a bit of garlic and some powdered onion to recharge the flavor.  It also fries up nice in bacon fat for breakfast the next day also.

Pretty good! While I prefer Ashley's colcannon (fabulous colcannon, also on this site), this was decent nonetheless. When paired with a hearty stew, this makes an ordinary meal extra special. :) Having said this, I think I'll stick with Ashley's recipe. The addition of garlic and a few seasonings really takes her colcannon over the top. NOTE: You must STEAM your cabbage in order for it to cook thoroughly. I've never had any luck sauteing it (my cabbage always ends up a tad crunchy). Simply cover your skillet with a lid and cook for 10 minutes or so. This simple change makes all the difference, IMHO. Thanks for sharing your authentic recipe, Diane. This was super yummy served with Irish stew on St. Paddy's Day! :-)

I was trying to find recipes that incorporated cabbage. This was definitely a delicious winner! I added two more slices of bacon and then seasoned the cabbage and onion with garlic salt while sautéing.

YUM! I do have to admit that I did not measure anything, just did it all to taste...the melted butter just put this over the top. A BIG hit at dinner tonight! Will def make again! Thanks for sharing. :)

BF loved this!  Loved the idea of adding cabbage and bacon to mashed potatoes; they complement each other and give the mashed potatoes some texture.  Made this for St. Pattys dinner, but will make again.

I've never made this before but it was extremely simple and super tasty. I paired it with a corned beef recipe found here too....possibly the guiness beer! my family doesn't like it too salty and this colcannon cuts down on the saltiness too!

I thought this was pretty good.  My 11 year old son loved it. The bacon adds the most flavor so I used extra. It was easy and I'll definitely make again.

I tried this recipe, but I doubled the bacon.  I thought it just an okay side dish and my husband asked me not to make it again.  I might for a buffet, as it's better than just plain potatoes.

Made this over the weekend for myself and the Hubby. It was really good. I dont normally like mashed potatoes so it was nice to have texture to it. I used turkey bacon to be on the healthier side but I didnt add it until serving so it wouldnt get soggy. Awesome recipe! Thanks Diane!

well, it was pretty good, followed directions exactly. I'd actually rate it a 3.5, but i rounded up to be nice. Worth the try for St Pattys day, but I likely won't make it again....may not be recipe's fault, just not my thing

Wow!!!  I'm not a big cabbage fan but my husband is so this recipe sounded like something that would please us both.  I LOVED this!  The cabbage and the onion added just a hint of sweetness that mixed nicely with the creaminess of the potatoes.  Of course, how can you go wrong with bacon and bacon drippings?!!  I will definitely make this again.  The only adjustment I made was to add the butter when I was whipping the potatoes instead of floating it on top at the end.  Thanks for sharing - a keeper for sure!

This colcannon recipe is excellent.  I cut the bacon, then fried it crisp and then followed the recipe exactly.  I used leftover mashed potatoes and it was so tasty.  Thank you for sharing this.

Have never made this before and it was wonderful, great favors. Used cabbage from the garden, would not use added salt as some reviewers suggested. With the bacon and butter there is enough salty flavor. Had this with Guinness Corned Beef. Wow!

This is actually a good substitute for those who don't care for corned beef and cabbage.  Personally, my husband and I thought it could use more bacon - maybe 6 slices, and a little more salt, but it was quite good.

I would have never thought to mix cabbage and mashed taters. Really tasty dish! I didn't put my butter in at the end. I mixed it in with the milk when mashing the potatoes. We had no leftovers (my daughter went back for seconds!)This is a great way to change up your plain ol' mashed potatoes.

This was fantastic!  I followed the recipe pretty closely except that I left some skin on the potatoes and used a bacon substitute (we're vegetarians).  It was really delicious; I can't wait to eat the leftovers!

This is outstanding!  It was the hit of our St.Patrick's Day dinner.  My mom even requested the recipe.  Even most of the kids liked it.  I would make this for more than St. Patrick's Day.  Nice, easy and flavorful.

This is really yummy! I'm Irish and we have eaten this dish for years. Traditionally on Halloween. But it's great any time of year, especially as a side dish for St.Patty's. This is also a "man's" dish..my husband and father-in-law LOVE it.

SOOOO GOOD!  To die for - especially since you'll probably have a coronary after eating the fat content in this recipe.  But it is worth every bit of heart-clogging calorie.  The best ever!

Just make sure you really chop up your cabbage really good.  Our slices were a bit large, which made the kids not want to eat it.

This was superb. Cooking the cabbage took a lot longer than I was expecting but well worth it. We will definitely have this again.

great recipe, i made it with half the potatoes and it was really hearty.  i also melted in about 2 oz of sharp cheddar, which made it super flavorful, and left out the butter, which other reviewers mentioned was unnecessary.  will definitely make again.

Very hearty and delicious...  just like mom used to make.  It is also good with Kale, if you like the stronger flavor of kale.

Used leftover mashed potatoes brought to room temp. and heated through with additional milk.  This was really good but for our tastes, next time I'll use the whole cabbage and 12-16 oz. bacon.  Thanks for the great comfort food!

all i can say is OMG it was great!!! we devoured it in one meal. it works well as a stand alone meal or as a side to any meal you would use mashed potatos with. I used pre-packaged cole slaw rather than fresh cabbage to save a little prep time and added a few spices to fit my familys taste. this recipe lends well to changes...

I've made this recipe a few times. It does make a lot for two people, but between my husband and I we ate a good portion. =) I find it's a mark of a very good recipe when my husband goes back for seconds! It is a very comforting dish.

Nobody wanted to eat my potatoes when they heard that they had cabbage.  I talked a few into trying it and they were very surprised at the great taste!  Soon everyone had tasted it and all loved it.  I followed the directions exactly and will be making this again!  Thank you.

SUPER excellent!  I am officially a fan of cabbage, thanks to this recipe.  Of course, in my opinion, bacon makes anything better, so perhaps that had something to do with it.  I made the recipe exactly as written, and it turned out perfectly.

There was nothing really wrong with this recipe. It has a lot of fat for me, though. It was good, but I'm not going to make it one of my staple dishes. I'll probably make it again, but not regularly, and maybe only once a year.

We loved this - great for kids too, they normally shy away from cabbage, but it turns sweet and gets hidden in the recipe.   The bacon flavor is fantastic. 

I've added this to my make again side dishes!

For years, I've been making a similar recipe handed down by my grandmother, and this recipe never fails to impress.  I made this last week for our office St. Paddy's Day potluck and everyone loved it!  Most had never heard of Colcannon, but they all wanted the recipe!  I even made a vegetarian version without the bacon and got rave reviews from that too.  Thanks for keeping up the tradition Diane!

OH my goodness! This was one of the best flavors I have ever tasted. We had a few potatos and 1/4 head of cabbage left from the boiled corned beef dinner last night... I added them to the ingredients which probably changed it up just a bit. This will be a regular meal for us. My husband loved it too!

Fabulous!  Such a tasty blend of flavors..  As other reviewers suggested I used a bag of coleslaw cabbage, a lot more bacon, and a little minced garlic.  I also mixed in the butter when mashing the potatoes before folding in the bacon, cabbage and onions.  I really didn't think my teenage children would like it much because of the cabbage, but they loved it and asked me to make it again real soon :).  This dish was a great accompaniment to our "Guinness Corned Beef" (another great recipe from this site).  I sliced the meat and served it directly on top of the potatoes with a little of the sauce from the pot in which the beef had simmered.  Yum!

Yummy!  My husband is not a big boiled cabbage fan, so I used this recipe to encorporate the cabbage with our corned beef.  It was terrific.  My only modification was to add some smoked gouda cheese to the mix.  It was delicious and even better left over.  Thanks for a winner recipe!

Deeelish!  The only change I made was to add the butter to the potatoes while I was mashing.  I will definitely make this again next year for St. Patty's!!  It made a nice side to the corned beef and cabbage!

Whenever I have mashed potatoes and cabbage left over after meals, I mash them together in a similar way to this recipe and fry them together as "bubble and squeak", a familiar British dish.   Diane's Colcannon is different to the one I make, using cabbage and leeks, but it is just as good.

As a native New Englander I've endured a lifetime of boiled dinners without any enthusiasm.  I like corned beef, but not the carrots, potatoes and cabbage all boiled up in the same pot. This St. Pat's I did the corned beef in a cooking bag using Corned Beef and Cabbage II from this site and for the first time ever made [Diane's] Colcannon.  The corned beef was very good, but the Colcannon was out of this world delicious and first rate comfort food.  Followed the recipe exactly except for using a bag of shredded cabbage (my grocery store was out of green cabbage on 3/17!). My 11 year old son ate thirds and I can't wait to use the leftover corned beef and colcannon for a bastardized version of Boxty.

Made for St. Patrick's Day meal! Nice big chunks of onion and cabbage. Added sour cream to the mashed potatoes. Used real bacon bits and no fat drippings. Turned out very well. Will prepare again!

Fantastic. My husband says we should make this dish for Thanksgiving too. I was so surprised on how colorful it was. I did use red potatoes (skin on) and a bag of coleslaw instead of chopping cabbage. It looked like mashed potatoes "confetti" style. I like my bacon bits to be uniform in size, so I diced it before cooking. And I added the melted butter during the potato mashing stage instead of putting it in a well at the end. Very good. Try this recipe.

This was a big hit with my Irish in-laws at our traditional Corn Beef and Cabbage Dinner for St. Patrick's Day.  But, since one of the niece's doesn't eat pork (or beef), I used Turkey Bacon.  I cooked it with a tablespoon of Canola Oil (since it doesn't throw off any fat) and then proceeded with the recipe as written.  Fabulous --- will definately make this again!

I made this for St. Patrick's Day and it was a HUGE hit. Even with my cabbage wary husband and kids. I sauteed the onions and cabbage in Earth Balance spread instead of bacon fat, and mashed my potatoes with No Chicken Chicken broth, soymilk and Earth Balance spread in place of butter. I used Bac'o's in place of bacon. It was WONDERFUL. Thank you for a great recipe.

This is delicious! I make Colcannon every year for St. Patrick's day and I will make this recipe from now on. The bacon makes it, so don't leave it out! In fact, it wouldn't hurt to add more!

Oh my goodness this was the best!  I made this to go with my Guiness corned beef and soda bread.  So flavorful.  At first I was a littl wary of all that bacon grease going into the potatoes but man it was totally worth it.

This is one of my favorite mix of flavors. I am a huge fan of this dish. I think you have to like cabbage though because I have had some people say it is just ok while I rate this at amazing. You must try this atleast once in your life. I make it all the time. My two year old loves it.

I've never made or eaten colcannon, but I thought the ingredients and proportions of this recipe resulted in a very nice, flavorful side dish. I added a few cloves of chopped garlic and a bit of grated chedder cheese as well.

yum. I used real bacon bits to save time, so I had to saute the veggies in olive oil spread. My son loved it. I'll make it again.

I changed the recipe a bit, and it came out as a 4-star rating.  However, if I had prepared it exactly as written, it probably would've been a 5!  I didn't peel my potatoes (I like the skin), I steamed the cabbage to make it healthier, and I didn't use any bacon because I didn't have any.  I also used green onions instead of regular and added them raw at the end (the residual heat cooked them a little bit while retaining their flavor).  I also only used 2 Tbsp butter, added cold at the end and stirred in so it would melt.  While it probably would've tasted better with more butter, it honestly probably also would've been fine without any butter at all.  If I make this again, I will try it with bacon, no butter and regular onions (although I think I'll still prefer the green onions).  I like how cheap and healthy this recipe can be.

I made this for my St. Patrick's dinner and everyone really liked it.  I used twice as much bacon as what the recipe called for, and be sure to cook the cabbage till it's nice and soft, unless you like crunch and texture in your mashed potatoes.  I will definately be making this each year, as it's a wonderful side dish for corned beef!!

I love this!! This is the best healthy comfort food ever. I don't eat bacon, so I omitted the bacon and they were still really good. Even had the leftovers for breakfast.

I made this last week on Friday before St. Patty's day.  My boyfriend is part Irish and just loved this recipe.  He liked the little hints of flavor that was in the mashed potatoes.  I couldn't eat it as just a main dish, as both of us are meat eaters.  So, I made this with pork chops and it was delicious on the side.  Will definitely make again and not just around the Irish Holiday.

I made this for a St. Patrick's day party and received positive feedback.  I was even asked for the recipe.  I did add more bacon (about doubled) and served this in a crock pot so I put about 5 tbsp butter slices evenly on top.  Will definately make again and not just for St. Patrick's day.

This was excellent!  I followed user recommendations and used a bag of pre-shredded coleslaw mix (had little carrot peices and little red cabbage) -- I added a couple extra slices of bacon.

I made this dish two hours before it was served and put it in a heated carry pack to take with me to the Irish family dinner we had.  It was a hit, a LOT OF COMPLIMENTS, and the leftovers taste great too!!!

I'll definately make this again, next Irish dinner, or even just for fun in any other meal!

Outstanding! My guests ate it up so quickly and I doubled the recipe.
I put in in a crock pot on low after it was done to hold for about 5 hours which just added to the depth of flavors.  Definitely NOT low fat but then again it's holiday food.  I will also make this for Easter as these potatoes would go so well with ham.

This is absolutely delicious and I even made it without the bacon for a friend who doesn't eat pork. I can only imagine how good it would be with the added smokiness of the bacon. Mmmm. Can't wait to eat the leftovers tonight.

We didn't get a chance to go to the store for beef fry (don't eat bacon), so we substituted some bacos. I'm sure it would have tasted better with the real deal. This was a great way to get the kids to eat some cabbage. We ate this with Irish Beef Stew (poured some of the stew gravy over). Good flavor!

St. Patrick's Day dinner was a hit w/this dish!!  Everyone loved it and there was *just* enough to feed 11 people [i used 2 lbs of red potatoes...the other 1/2 lb would've been welcome :)].  My dh wants me to make this all the time!!  I made this with Guiness Corned Beef from this site.

Fabulous!  Instead of the usual corned beef and cabbage dinner, I put a corned beef brisket in the crockpot and fixed this Colcannon recipe to go with it tonight.  My husband and I both loved it!  What a nice change from the usual cooked cabbage or the normal mashed potatos.  I'll definitely make this again!  The flavor from the combination of bacon and onions added a great deal to the cabbage and potatoes. Thanks for the great recipe!

Outstanding! It's hard to believe such simple ingredients can come together and be SO unbelievably tasty. My self-control went out the window the moment I tasted it! Whatever you do, don't cut back on the bacon or butter - make this once a year, and totally indulge yourself... Go raibh maith agat!

Pure Irish sin...wonderful and bad a the same time.  Made it with our corned beef on St. Pats Day - we loved it.  It is not for the calorie conscious, but it is heavenly.

A wonderfully tasty recipe.  Perfect for the St. Paddy's Day dinner party I had, a real hit with the guests.  I'm planning on modifying it a bit for health reasons, though-- Next time, I'll try the South Beach modification for the mashed potatoes (the one that uses mashed boiled cauliflower instead of potatoes) and reducing the bacon fat and butter.

I try to make Colcannon every St Paddy's day, even though it has not been that popular with the family.  This year we liked Diane's Colcannon a whole lot better than the recipe I usually use.  I didn't have any bacon in the house, so used smoked sausage instead and it worded out fine.

This was very good. I also just mixed the butter in with the potatoes. Different, yet good.

Delicious.  I used leeks instead of onions and added kale to the cabbage for added color and texture.  For the vegetarians (like my daughter) this is also great made with butter (real butter, please, not margarine) instead of the bacon fat.

I ended up adding more milk than what was called for but probably because I used too many potatoes.  Also, I doubled the bacon because we really like bacon.  This is great with Tobasco sauce if you like spicy food!!

Pretty good. I might've liked it better if I had sauteed the cabbage and onion in butter or oil instead of the bacon grease- the drippings kind of made the whole dish take on the "bacony" taste. It tasted just as good the next day.

This was AWESOME! My family enjoyed it very much, even my 17 year old who is picky about potatoes and especially cabbage! He ate 2 helpings! I fixed it for St. Patrick's Day and we had very little left over.  I used a little more bacon than the recipe called for because my family loves bacon (I have to swat them away when I'm making it or there isn't any left!). Will definitely make over and over again!

This is excellent!! I also used extra bacon since I don't believe there is ever enough of this much maligned meat. I'm definitely adding this to my list of favorite fix-aheads for the freezer. I also think this would be really good with some fresh apple grated in at the end, think I'll try that if there's anything left over. Thanks Diane
Follow up: Even better the next day and I did try the fresh grated apple and it gives a wonderful fresh taste to an already wonderful dish. Enjoy!

We really enjoyed this dish. So nice(and rare) to find a traditional Irish recipe! My husband liked it alone as a meal, but I am looking forward to having it along with my Corned Beef Wellington for St. Pat's Day. Nice change from the usual boiled cabbage & potatoes.

Great recipe, Diane.  Reminds me of a cabbage, potato + Kolbassi dish my mother used to make way back when.  My daughter didn't want to try it at first, but ended up loving it.  She even warmed up a big bowl later in the evening + after she was done said, I love that cabbage!

It's so good! I will 100% be making it again. I did cut down the recipe to only serve one since no one in my house likes cabbage  (bummer :0 they're missing out!) Or can't eat onions, but now I kinda regret that because I want more xD ?

Everyone loved this dish!   I did add a chopped leek to the onions and cabbage.  Also used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk.
Will definitely make again.

I am not a fan of boiled cabbage and potatoes, so, I thought I would give this a try.  We thought it was really good and a nice change with for our traditional corned beef dinner.   I did add about 1/2 cup of sour cream.

I made these mashed potatoes a long with my corned beef for St. Patrick's day. I took the advise of some other reviews & omitted the 1/2 of head of cabbage & used a bag of cole slaw. I also added more bacon & sprinkled in a little caraway seed. It was delicious & my family loved it!! I will definitely will make this again

I made it almost like how it appears in this recipe and we loved it. I served it a bit an hour or two later so the bacon crunchiness was gone but it was still awesome, will do it again.

Absolutely delicious! I only had one lonely piece of bacon left so I added a couple of garlic cloves for extra flavor. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Definitely a keeper!!

Excellent dish. I've made this several times this year with our home-grown, early-season potatoes and cabbage. Delish. Salty and crunchy bacon. Sweet cabbage, Creamy, buttery potatoes. Today, I added a twist substituting our already-overgrowing collard greens for the nearly-spent cabbage.So I had to modify a bit. I figured that collards would be more savory, so I added five very large carrots (the only thing not home-grown) for their sweetness. The result, while different, was just as excellent. Maybe even better... though not traditional. But, now I have a new way to make collards other than old-school simmered greens.

I made no changes to this recipe, although , I didn't weigh the potatoes, just guessed.  Same with the cabbage, it was a large head and I guessed at how much to use.  Came out awesome, and this is the 2nd time making it, and the family loved it!  I even made corned beef hash with leftover con cannon and leftover corned beef; so good!  I'm making it today for tomorrow to be reheated, so a little worried about how the entire dish will do being warmed up!  Hopefully ok.

Doubled the bacon, onion and potatoes. I forgot to double  the milk, but it was still EXCELLENT. I wish I had doubled the cabbage, too. It's been requested for St. Patrick's Day dinner next year. PS, I didn't have a masher, so I used a pastry cutter and it worked perfectly!

It was tasty but not a big hit at my St. Patty's day party.    I followed the directions but wasn't impressed.   Maybe I did something wrong.

This is a hearty and extra-tasty take on mashed potatoes! Don't let anyone tell you they don't like cabbage, make it anyway - this is SO good. 

I made this for the first time for a St. Patrick's day work potluck, so rather than serving right away they spent some QT in a crockpot. Since that usually dries out potatoes, I added an additional 1/2 cup milk. I also added about 1/2 cup light sour cream, because I always make my mashed potatoes that way. To make life easier, I bought 1lb of finely shredded cabbage (much more fine than a regular slaw mix with red cabbage and carrots), and I cooked it and the onions until they were very soft and pretty darn caramelized. They both add a lot of veggie sweetness that way. 

I cooked and assembled the night before, then refrigerated the crock overnight; I added the butter in pats all over the top and lightly salted the whole thing before plugging in the slow cooker at work that morning. Worked perfectly! 

After crockpotting, the whole thing was a deep color, rather than the nice white photo here - but no one cared, it's so good! 

If I ever crockpot it again, I will wait to add the bacon until just before serving - it was tasty, but lost some zip and crunch after so much time hanging out in there. 

But for sure I will make this again. I'm glad I tried it, thanks for the recipe!

I took Kitchen Commander's advice - doubled the recipe - and used a entire package (3/4 lb) of uncured organic bacon.  (Uncured tastes better).  I added a crushed peppercorn blend (white/green/black) to the cabbage mixture.  I think I'm Almost Famous, as the group always asks if I'm making this dish when I attend a neighborhood party.  I save them for St. Paddy's day only....gotta keep 'em wanting more!  Thanks Diane for this FAB recipe!

I made this for the first time today. My family loved it! I didn't have any bacon, so I used some kielbasa cut up small. I'll make sure I have bacon next time, but it was delicious!

This was SOOOOOO good.  Used to 1.5 lb packages of Bob Evans mashed potatoes (to save cooking time and because we had them on hand) used 6 pieces of platter bacon, and a bag of cole slaw mix (with shredded cabbage and carrot).   Will make again for sure.

Great flavor and very easy.  I used Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and boiled whole.  I had leeks from the garden so used those instead of onion.  The leeks and cabbage were sautéed together in the bacon grease.  I did this early in the day so all was ready to mash together and heat up closer to dinner time.  I used more unsalted butter than called for.  Will surely make this again.

I recently discovered Colcannon...there are many variations. This is a good base recipe, you can substitute other greens like kale or spinach, a good way to use up those things before they go bad! I usually add more bacon, as i make this as a main course. Also a good way to use corned beef, jowl bacon, bacon ends, etc. I add the butter to everything in the skillet instead of pouring it over it at the end. Good for breakfast, too!

That was an awesome spin on mashed potatoes. I ended up having to use microwaveable bacon, so it wasn't as flavorful. If I use it again, I will definitely fry my bacon in a pan.

I made this for my sons' annual St. Paddy's Day party yesterday and ALL LOVED IT! Only things I did different were used red skin potatoes and left the skins on, and used 1 pkg (14 slices) turkey bacon, because I doubled potatoes, cabbage, and onion. This was DELICIOUS! Super easy! This will be made often It might become a Lenten Friday main dish, sans bacon!

Fantastic! I used extra bacon and omitted the butter pool (although I did add some I can't believe it's not butter to t h e potatoes). I also grated 3 carrots into the veggie mix.

Absolutely love Colcannon.  Used to buy it at an Irish Pub where we ate lunch.  Since the pub is now closed, I was searching for a recipe.  I only made one change but that wasn't too make it better, but so my sister could eat it as well.  I left out the bacon.  I sauted the cabbage and onion in olive oil.  Everything else was done the same.  Next time I will try it with the cole slaw mix.  It sounds good and the added color would be great.  Thanks for the terrific recipe.

I came across this nice delish dish on the lead up to St. Patrick's day, but waited until today to make it with a baked ham.   This might be intended as an Irish dish, but it's perfect for any meat and tater day.

Don't bother making a single batch, go double or nothing! I barely got it to the table the first time I made it. I had to substitute half kale as I didn't have quite enough cabbage and we really liked it that way. Intend to increase the kale in future batches. Also have taken to adding more bacon but draining off a majority of the drippings.  I mash my potatoes in a mixer  so they are creamier and fluffier, then add the veggies and bacon.

As a full Irish O'Nolan, we never had nor have I developed a taste for kale despite the claim that this was it one of the original ingredients of colcannon. This dish was an instant hit for my potato loving family! Made as directed, it will feed the Irish in you.

I just made this recipe this tonight, and I have only one thing to say, "OMG...this is incredibly good".  The only short cut I took, was I bought 100% bacon bits, the ones you find in the salad isle in the little bags.  I cooked them in a little grapeseed oil and then removed them, following the rest of the instructions.  I may never eat regular mashed potatoes again. These were absolutely awesome. Thank you for posting it.

Made this for St. Patrick's Day and it was awesome! Everyone gobbled it up including my 2 year old who rarely eats anything like this. I did add two more pieces of bacon than the recipe called for but I followed it perfectly other wise. It was so good and very easy! I think next time I will add more onions but that is just a preference thing. Thanks for the recipe!

I make this exact recipe for St. Patrick's Day dinner every year.  I first found it in an Irish cookbook I bought. I have read other versions but this one is the best as far as I'm concerned and I will continue to use it.  The melted butter in the middle just seems to add something extra.

This was such an awesome and easy recipe! Thank you so much! My picky eater even ate it. I didn't add bacon or use bacon grease I just used butter and threw in some salt and fresh cracked pepper. However I didn't have to use much salt because I boiled the potatoes in chicken broth. It added more flavor and it was absolutely delicious! I think this will be my husbands welcome home dinner. Thank you for such a great recipe! This will be a staple in my household from now on.

Very easy, no unusual or hard to find ingredients. I like the cabbage rather than kale and so do my kids! The addition of bacon guaranteed that even my 18 year old son would eat it!

Delicious and my 5yo and 7yo loved it! Even my 'I hate cabbage' husband had two helpings. I've made several times; using the original recipe and subbing kale and leeks. All are great.

Heard about colcannon but had never had before... for our xmas dinner this year we decided to go outside the traditional mashed potatoes, stuffing kinda meal- Mom made prime rib, so it seemed a good time to try colcannon; a little out of the box. SO glad I did. I read through all the recipes here on allrecipes.com and this was the winner! So good! Tip: Season at every step!

I have been using Allrecipes for years and this is the 1st time I have ever rated a recipe.  This recipe is AMAZING!  I am not huge on mashed potatoes, but I made this with Irish stew, Irish soda bread, and cabbage for a nice St Patrick's day dinner.  I will absolutely make this one again and again.  Yum!

Ohhhh this was good!! I used an immersion blender to blend everything so I could get my kids to eat it without noticing the cabbage (it worked)!! I also subed the milk for half and half! This does make a ton so I after we ate and DH got his lunch for work tomorrow I had enough to freeze for another dinner.

This was my first try at Irish potatoes and it turned out excellent. I modified the recipe just a little - sauteed garlic, leeks, and cabbage in what little turkey bacon drippings there were and added a little butter. Used a mixture of red and baking potatoes and added about 6 oz. of sour cream to the mash. Everyone loved it!

Thought it was great.  I used turkey bacon but added some "real" bacon grease and a little olive oil, keeping the bacon in the pan when putting cabbage and onion to saute.  While potatoes boiled (skin-on yellow), the cabbage mixture simmered and wilted beautifully.  Don't forget the salt and pepper, it will need it.  Also, next time I would add cream cheese or sour cream to help with the texture as it was a little dense when mixed by hand.  Garlic would also help to boost flavor.

Soooooo gooooood!  As a life-long lover of mashed potatoes, this recipe had me on cloud 9.  I used red potatoes and kept the skin on.  I used a coleslaw mix for ease, as a few others have suggested, and did enjoy the colour added by the carrots.  I also included a little garlic in the sautee mix.  I used more bacon than the recipe called for--bacon makes everything better!!!  Me Irish ma would be proud :)

This was excellent.  I would make it again! I couldn't imagine mashed potatoes with cabbage in them but now I think it's one of the best ways to eat them!  Thanks!

Ultimate comfort food.  I viewed several versions of this recipe and there was a  slight variation in them.  I combined the goodness of all and the result was amazing.  I love potato skins so I left them on.  It added more texture and flavor.  I opted for leeks and added a bit of sour cream.  What's not to love?

This was excellent!  I made this for a family St. Patrick's Day dinner and nothing was left in the serving dish.  The only thing I revised was to add two slices of crumbled bacon to the top of the dish as was suggested by another reviewer.  I will definitely make again, but not too often as this is not very heat healthy!

I like this recipe. I changed it just a little by adding 3 cloves of oven roasted smashed garlic to the mashed potatoes. I also added kosher salt instead of table salt. Overall very yummy!!

I have made this 2x and the first attempt was bland. Second try, I used red skin potatoes cut in half,steamed them tender and added some sour cream in place of some of the milk--this gives the potatoes more body and the red skins gave it additional flavor, color and texture. I totally cut the pool of butter--didnt need it with the bacaon flavor.  Hand mashing (leaving it more chunky) works well too. My guests loved it!

I decided to get festive last St. Patrick's Day and make an Irish meal.  I made corned beef, colcannon, and soda bread.  While I do have to admit that this colcannon recipe was the best dish served that night, I still was not that excited.  I am an Idaho potato-lovin' girl and absolutely love cabbage as well.  I'm not sure why I didn't get excited about this dish.  Maybe it's the Scottish in me?

I, like other reviewers, used a 16 oz. bag of coleslaw mix, instead of a half a head of cabbage.  Turned out wonderfully.  My family enjoyed it, but it wasn't their favorite.

I never made colcannon before but came across this recipe looking for something different to serve with corned beef and cabbage on St. Patty's Day. This was great and so much better than the boring boiled potatoes I usually serve with it.

I made this recipe without changing anything.
My husband came home after a very long and stressful day, sat down at the table, tasted these potatoes and his eyes lit up.  Mission accomplished!
I'm going to make this one allot.  Thank you!

This was a good recipe in comparision to others that I have made.   I did add a bit more bacon and minced garlic to the mixture.   Served this for St. Patty's day.  I brought leftovers the following day and the girls in the office loved it.  Thanks for a great recipe

This was a huge hit, served it with corned beef and cabbage rolls.  Nice contrast of color, texture and flavor to compliment the meal.  I increased the amount of bacon to 6 strips of thick sliced.  I also added some chopped garlic.  I added the melted butter during the potato mashing stage.  This will definitely become a tradition in our house.

I thought there was a little too much onion, but my husband really loved it.  Served it individually mounded in the center of large shallow bowls and ladled Special Irish Beef Stew (substituting venison for the beef...) around it.  Gorgeous presentation and perfect for our St. Patrick's Day supper.

Wow! I've never had colcannon before, but it sounded good so I tried it on St. Paddy's Day.  It was so delicious!  I used red potatoes, so they were very creamy. I also increased the bacon to 6 slices. I'll definitely be making these often. Thanks for the recipe!

SO GOOD!  BUT, the bacon MUST be doubled for the right potato, veggie, and bacon proportions.  I also added some chopped cloves of garlic and 2 tablespoons of butter to the onion/cabbage saute.  The perfect complement to Special Irish Beef Stew from this site for our St. Patty's Day dinner.  Will definitely make again -- my new favorite mashed potato recipe! THANKS!!!

I LOVE this recipe and I've made it several times.  I always "as per taste" most recipes and this was no different.  I added a little garlic, sour cream, and more bacon.  Overall, this is terrific!

This is incredible!!! Served it with my St Paddy's Day dinner but definitely will make it throughout the year! I had some leftover coleslaw mix that I used instead of cabbage ... quick and easy!

This is a really great dish.  It is so easy to make and you get several veggies and a meat all in one dish.  My 3 kids love it.  This will become a staple in our family.

I love cabbage and mashed potatoes, but never thought of putting them together so I am so glad I came upon this delicious recipe.  To simplify things I used instant mashed potatoes and a half a bag of coleslaw mix.  I used turkey bacon instead of regular, so I had to add a couple of tablespoons of olive oil to saute the slaw/onion mix in.  My bf won't eat cooked cabbage, so I mixed them seperatley but this will definitely be served in heavy rotation!

this was a great way to change up the old potatoe recipe and add in something different for the kids to try.  a different recipe for us, but a tasty one!  the only change i made was adding real bacon bits instead of having to fry the bacon.

I had never even heard of this, but last year I was dying to cook up some Irish food and tried it.  I've never seen a bowl of potatoes disappear so quickly.

Probably doubled the bacon, mixed the butter and milk into potatoes and added a bit more salt. I LOVED it! Very, very delicious and will make again for any time, not just St Patty's Day!

Mashed potatoes and cabbage are a great combo. No one in my family is a fan of cabbage, but we all loved the combo. I made it w/ corned beef brisket for St. Patty's day dinner, and it was a big hit. It will be a regular in our house.

This was my first attempt @ making and eating Colcannon.  Very good recipe, and even my fussy 18 year old son liked it, and he hates cabbage!( give him pizza or give him death!)  I did however, take afew of the previous suggestions.  I added 4 minced garlic cloves to the onion/cabbage mixture, and ALOT more bacon.  VERY filling and rich flavor.  Went great with our corned beef dinner and roasted carrots on St. Patty's Day!  Over-eating prevailed with second helpings of this dish.

Very good. I used a lot more bacon than called for. I also mashed in some butter in addition to pouring on top. I was surprised my kids ate so much and said it was awsome. Served with corned beef on St Patrick's day.

I took a vote from the family on what to rate this dish at, and we decided on 4 stars.  My husband loved it, my youngest said it was great, but my son and I were just not that impressed.  The flavor just didn't compare to the vegetables that I had cooked with the Guinness Corned Beef, which is spectacular.

Super.  I used bacon grease instead of bacon and added 2 chopped hot dogs with a little Dijon mustard.  I always add mustard to colcannon.  Horseradish mustard would be good, too.  It was teriffic.

I made this with roast and it was really wonderful. I was suprised how well the ingredients went together. It really was better the next day. Great recipe. I did not change a thing except to add the bacon bits to the top right before serving the dish.

I made this around St. Pat's for my first time and loved it.  I followed the recipe as-is and see no need to alter any of the steps.  The leftovers were great as well.  I served this alongside corned beef brisket w/ horseradish.

Delicious!  What an easy way to turn plain mashed potatoes into a spectacular dish.  I must admit, I used instant potatoes, but the end result, as far as anyone at the dinner table was concerned, was that of excellence.  A definite keeper!

My husband and I loved this.  It was easy to make on a weeknight.  We used pancetta (Italian bacon), which gave it a different flavor.  Very yummy.

good and hearty...i cooked the bacon too long (my fault!) so it had a bit of a burned taste but the recipe is good.

Made this for Thanksgiving and my mother-in-law and husband really enjoyed it.  I think next time I will try and cook the cabbage longer to make it softer but I may have been rushing because I burnt the 1st batch.  A little more bacon couldn't hurt either.  Very tasty and will make again for my polish relatives who enjoy cabbage.

I just love colcannon, so I maybe biased, but this was delish!  I've made it twice in the last month, huge batches that I've frozen and eaten from almost every day.  I'm planning a Halloween party, and eating colcannon all the time is really getting me in the mood.  Just Fantastic!

SOooooooooooo GOOD!!!  Talk about heart-warming, tummy-filling, love at first BITE.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.  Though I did change it a bit, it would be good just the way it is.  I used some smoked bone in ham in place of the bacon. I removed the bone after frying it up.  This is absolutely the best.

I thought this was pretty good.  I followed the recipe as is (minus the butter since I was serving this w/ chicken cordon blue which has a sauce).  Only thing I would change is to add more bacon!
