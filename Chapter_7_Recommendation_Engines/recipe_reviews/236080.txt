Added a bit less flour, substituted marshmallows with walnuts and added another tablespoon of Kahlua. The results were amazing and yummy!

I followed this recipe exactly and the cookies were so soft and never hardened.

The marshmallow bits were pretty against the dark  dough. Nice soft texture. I will up the amount of Kahlua next time for a little more flavor.

This recipe isn't great. There was no Kahlua flavor so I added extra and it still was poor in flavor. It turned out to be a mediocre chocolate cookie.
