My mom handed down a very similar recipe to me. Some variations: instead of water you can use cold coffee. Also we make a cinnamon and sugar mixture and generously sprinkle it all over the top of the cake before baking. I usually sprinkle a little more immediately after I take the cake out of the oven. This topping will form a sweet crunchy crusty layer on top. I have also found that the cake tastes better the second day when the topping has a chance to set. I make this for all potlucks and parties that I go to. It doesn't have the greatest presentation but it is delicious.

This cake has no flavor. I just made it and the only good thing about it is the frosting. Perhaps I made it the wrong way but it is very bland. Maybe use milk or cream instead of water?

Really excellent. Moist and flavorful. Because others said it was bland I added an extra 1/3 c. white sugar. The icing was not grainy at all. I suspect the reviewer that said so did not boil the icing long enough.

I had a cookbook I purchased for a church fundraiser that had a krazy cake recipe in it but I lost it when we moved. I checked on the net and found this. I've made it with regular and dark (special) Hershey's cocoa. The dark chocolate makes this recipe POP!!!! Now that I found the recipe again I won't buy cake mixes anymore The finished product is so moist it reminds me of the old Hostess cupcakes when I was a kid back in the 60s. My daughter must eat gluten free products so I used the gluten free flour I found at the farmer's market near my home and it was a total hit with her entire family. LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!

This is pretty good (if a little on the sweet side) though I made some moderate changes by replacing the cocoa powder with instant hot chocolate mix and instant cappuccino mix. Make sure you mix it well or else it will have floury bits in it. You might want to boil the glaze for a minute or two longer than stated to guarantee it isn't grainy. I needed to bake it for closer to 50 minutes to fully cook it as well. It really needs something like raisins inside or chopped nuts on top though for a little more texture.

made this tonite. i like it as a very subtle base with the french buttercream frosting recipe on this site. i didn't have white vinegar i used apple cider vinegar instead. i also made cupcakes with it and had enough to make about 2 1/2 dozen. its a keeper. thanks

I was out of eggs so I gave this cake a shot and was really disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly and the frosting was grainy the cake sticky and bland. I gave it two stars because with a creamy frosting and some milk I think it would be a decent quick-and-easy dessert.

This cake is so easy and really moist. If you didn't use the frosting it would also be low in fat. The frosting is also really good and smooth.

This is a great recipe for anyone! For me it took a little longer to boil the frosting than it said on the recipe but other than that it was a great cake to make and for a beginning baker this is a perfect recipe!! I was surprised that it tasted like cinnamon cake more than chocolate cake but it was a pleasant. Great recipe!!

Very rich and chocolately! Comes together pretty easily too. I added some nuts on top of the cake prior to baking and gave it a surprising crunch. Mine needed to cook longer than directed to get center to cook completely. The frosting is more of a glaze than frosting but tastes amazing. I couldn't stop eating the glaze. Once it had frosting cooled a lot and cake was semi cool I poured frosting/glaze over the cake. It did seem to soak in some and is pretty sticky so cutting pieces was that looked pretty was not easy. Overall a great recipe and very nice chocolate taste.

this cake was wonderful! It reminded me of store bought hostess cupcakes! Very yummy. The frosting is very runny but once cooled slightly and applied to the cake it hardened and tasted great.
