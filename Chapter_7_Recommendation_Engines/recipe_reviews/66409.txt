I liked these, but I was the only one.  Their loss.  I subbed much less chopped onions & cooked them with the frozen peas.  Yummy, but so high in fat.

I used about 10 cocktail onions (drained) and put in with the peas the last ten minutes of simmering.  I simmered my peas about 10 minutes longer than suggested because we like almost mushy peas.  The flavor was so good we will make this again soon.

Really pleased with the suggestion to use milk. 
(One cup milk mixed with one tablespoon cornstarch can be substituted for the cream)..it made a light sauce and I used petite peas with cooked pearl onions....a little dill on top.  Nice presentation, too.

These have the potential for more stars, but the cream never thickened up and the seasonings just weren't strong enough so it came out a little bland.  I ended up thickening it with a little slurry and increasing the seasoning.  Hubby just didn't like it though.

My kids loved all under 5. Made as directions said, but added more flavor with more seasonings because I used more than 2 cups of peas. Probably 1/4 tsp of garlic powder and onion powder. At the end I added 1  slice american cheese so my kids would eat..haha. Very good. Had this with Brats, homemade sauerkraut, fried onions. A great side dish and easy.

I remembered something like this as a child but didn't know how to make it. I looked around and here I found something quick and so easy it took no time at all to make. I used fresh butter and my only suggestion is LOW HEAT. I burnt the butter the first time and had to start over. Totally worth it it was so good I plan on making it every Holiday.

I doubled the spices as recommended by others, and also added 1/4 t of nutmeg.   Everyone really liked it, including people who don't like creamed onions too much.  Could have even added more peas or onions.  Ends up with a lot of cream.

Perfect. The little extra effort is well worth the flavor. One of my favorites. Bravo.

I made this close to the recipe - added a little extra garlic and pepper, and cooked the peas and onions for less time as our stove runs hot and we like fairly crisp vegetables. My family was a bit skeptical, but everyone loved it!

I was skeptical I would like this, but it was actually quite tasty. I halved the recipe and used a mix of frozen peas/onion. Surprisingly yummy and super fast to make!
