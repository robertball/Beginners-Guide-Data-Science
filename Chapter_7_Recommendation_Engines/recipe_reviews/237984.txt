I make a salad similar to this all year long (but with less pepper).  I really prefer apple cider vinegar or white balsamic which gives you more tang instead of the very mild white vinegar, but this is a personal preference.  I was a little concerned with the amount of pepper, but it was fine.  You really can't go wrong with this simple salad, as it will complement most anything you're serving.

I've made this salad twice now. The first time omitted the water and sugar as one reviewer suggested and yikes! Big mistake! It was like sliced pickles. The second time I followed the recipe and it turned out great! I added a little extra vinegar (about 1/8 cup). I should have just followed the recipe to begin with. Oh I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. It worked out fine. Very good recipe!

This was SSSOOOOOO good!!!!  I made a small portion to try out and ended up eating the whole thing myself!  The only changes I made were using White wine vinegar and only 1 tablespoon of Olive Oil. It's such a refreshing taste.  Can't wait to make it for my family. LOL!

This is great, but there is no need for the sugar or water!  Eliminate both & you'll have a wonderfully fresh salad! Reduce salt to 1 tsp... and also the black pepper to 1 tsp.  (Also, consider adding a little garlic powder or fresh minced garlic & feta on top.) Yum!  Thanks!

Super easy recipe. love it.  Followed advice of some others and made with apple cider vinegar. Delicious.  Also used a sweet onion since it didn't specify.  I found that the longer it marinated, the better it was. Made it early in the morning, and that evening and then the next day, it seemed to be at its best. Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!

I thought this was good. I have made a couple other similar salads on the site that I preferred the ratio of salt, sugar, and vinegar better. However, I have never cared for raw onions in a salad, but the dressing combo, in this recipe, works good with them. I scaled the recipe down to 2 servings and marinated about 20 minutes before serving. For that amount I used 1 English cucumber, un-peeled, and 2 large roma tomatoes. ty

Wow...really good. I added some fresh minced garlic and some basil, about a tablespoon each. The balance of the seasonings, oil and vinegar is perfect. Also, I used 6 plum tomatoes, two regular cucumbers and one medium red onion. Fantastic.

This was exactly the recipe I wanted. Day 1, it was a perfect balance of flavor. The next day, the vegetables had taken in the vinegar and the tartness was just right. Not overly sour. I did add a teaspoon of dill. I'm not sure how much it changed the original flavor. This is a keeper for me.

WAY too much pepper. I had to throw out the dressing and start over. For the second attempt, I cut back the oil and added a teaspoon of pepper instead of a tablespoon.

Very good - wonderful with the summer vegetables.  It's better if you let it sit in the refrigerator for a few hours before you eat it.

Have made this many times....I use apple cider vinegar instead of white....gives it more taste....I slice vadalia sweet onions very thin.... I NEVER use water....just oil, apple cider vinegar, sugar.....cucumber, tomato and onion...it really makes its own juice with no watering down.....I let it sit for couple hours before eating....I feel it makes it better tasting as all ingredients have time to marinate....love this salad

I love this recipe because it is delicious and refreshing! It is an added bonus that it is very quick and easy to make too.I only use 1/2 the amount of onion (red) and 1 tsp. of pepper instead of a whole tablespoon.

Big hit this summer! Made it a couple times.  Second time I used a little less water but it is great.  This must be the dressing used by my favorite aunt in all her summer salads (the first salads I ever liked). I made it again today for a church get together and was asked by a few people for this recipe.  Thanks!

Easy, great combination.  I always make a recipe as written the first time, then think about what I might add/change.  This was really good, but I would add a touch more herbs.  Maybe basil or red pepper flakes depending on who I was serving.  Maybe some dill weed?  Options are endless!

Needing a side for a family gathering, I made this salad with a few tweaks taken from other reviews. I lessened pepper to 1 tsp, 1 tablespoon oil, used White Wine vinegar, English cukes, red onion, regular garden tomatoes and added a splash of minced garlic. Marinated overnight. Very tasty but I would def try using Apple Cider vinegar for a little extra zing.  Overall, very good, def best after overnight marinating.If you slice the onion super thin, you still get the onion flavor but not the bulk of a chunk of onion if that is your preference.

Gave it 3 stars for as written.  I found out a long time ago to never ever use white vinegar in this type of dish, it is just to stong. I grew up eating marinated cucumbers and onions and this dish is very,very close to it. Cider  vinegar is a much better in this case. I really like a strong taste of black pepper. but I used 1/2 T and found it to have that peppery zing and not overpowering. With these changes, my family and I would give it 5 stars.

This salad is terrific. I was also concerned with the amount of pepper so at first I cut the amount in half. When I tasted it I added a little more pepper until it was all in and it tasted fine!!!!  Do not leave any ingredients out!!!!  If the recipe calls for it then it’s because it’s needed!!!!! I did variate slightly. I did use red onion instead of yellow or white. I varied not omitted. Big difference lol.

I made 1 change to the receipe ... I used 1/4 cup Red Wine vinegar.

I would like to suggest that when you use an ingredient (in this case onion) that have several varieties, you specify which variety (red, yellow, white, etc).

I made exactly as written and with a sweet onion (a little less than 1Tbsp pepper bc so many people said it was too much). This was very good, and I will probably make again. Might try different type of vinegar next time for a little more flavor.

First time I made it I used acv instead of white as suggested in other comments and a splash of balsamic and some dill turned out good. I could taste the apple cider vinegar and I don’t much care for it. I’m trying it with white vinegar today I believe I will like it better. Also will add a tad more sugar or something spicy. But that’s a preference thing.

I read the recipe, looked at the picture, and thought, "that is way more pepper than I need", so I just put in less. Easy enough to add more later, but you can't take it out after it is whisked in. Have some faith in your own cooking and knowledge. I thought the recipe was great. I had bought some tomatoes at a farmers market today and this was exactly what I wanted to do with a few of them. Looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow.

My family loved this.  I cut the oil in half when making the dressing. All remaining ingredients were as stated.

Just made this and WOW!!!!! Love it so delicious. I used Vidalia onion and cherry tomatoes. I also used the apple cider vinegar which I think gives it this fantastic taste.

I used apple cider vinegar, olive oil and added fresh basil from garden. Also used different types of tomatoes from garden.  I will use less water next time.

Originally I made this as written. I did add a few more slices of onion, it seemed a little short on onion, but otherwise it was pretty good. Try to let it sit several hours or overnight.

Had just the right amount of vinegar.  I tend to go too heavy on the vinegar if I'm not following a recipe.  We ate on it for several days and the vinegar never got over powering.

Made this for a get together and really loved it.  Even got request for recipe.  I am very limited being on my feet very much, but this was so easy.  I could slice vegetables sitting down, so there was no problem.  The only thing I did different was used Olive oil and Apple cider vinegar.  Very good!

It has to refrigerate a day or so but first taste was great. Not too over the top sour at all. I used a Vidalia onion and I think the rings are too big so I may recut them later.

I made this first with artificial sweetener. It was so bad that I dumped it out and remade it according to the recipe exactly. I thought it was kind of bland so I splashed in some Apple cider vinegar and sprinkled in some celery seed. Much better. Because of the doctoring, I gave it four stars.

This was superb.  Anytime I made my own version in the past something was missing, and I believe it was the sugar.  That really helps to balance out the acidity of the tomatoes and vinegar.  I used balsamic and added some freshly minced garlic to mine.  Favorite salad ever!

Too sweet. Not at all what I was looking for. I was hoping for the same tangy taste as the salad served at Boston Market. If you are looking for that, skip the sugar. I will next time, and report back.

I like it with good apple cider vinegar and really good olive oil. Pepper seems like a lot but it isn't for my taste. I didn't see the point in putting water in it at all considering cucumbers and tomatoes are so full of water to begin with and with some good course sea salt you know that's leaching out so why water it down to begin with. Flavor! I keep this in my fridge ready to go all week now. Freshen it up after a few days in the fridge, pour off some liquid and add some more vinegar . Good for another 3 or 4 days.

I grew up with cucumber/onion/vingar salads. LOVED them. This is a healthy & flavorful variation. But, since we now know that most of the nutrients are in the skin, we typically no longer peel cucumbers. And since we LIKE sour we reversed the water and vinegar measures and cut back on the sugar (to about 1 Tbls). We also added 6 shredded baby carrots and about 1/2 Tbls dill seed (out of dry and fresh dill) from other receipes. Won't be the last time we make this!

So good! My two year old will eat onions, peppers, tomatoes... anything soaked in this overnight. Great recipe to use up extra garden veggies!

This is a great basic recipe that is very easy to modify according to taste., or by what vinegars and spices you have on hand.  I used a combo of cider and balsamic vinegars to equal the half cup .  I used one tsp regular salt and one garlic salt.  I halved the pepper and added Italian seasoning.  I'm going to save this for the ratios and continue to modify according to whatever veggies I'm using.

This an easy and awesome receipt. I make it all the time because of the vegetables and the mixture of the vinegar with sugar and oil. It comes together great.

I love this refreshing salad. I have made this type salad for over 40 years. Just like Grandma and Mom used to make. 
I scaled down both the pepper and salt to 2TSP. I use Vidalia onion and Apple Cider vinegar with canola oil 2TBSP. The natural guices from the tomato and cucumber combine excellently with the oil & water ratio. 
I also let it marinate overnight in 2 big Mason jars. This allows for easy stirring.

I tasted the dressing after making it exactly as written and it was too sweet. I added more vinegar, about 1/8 cup, and it was much better. I also added fresh chives and basil from the garden and omitted the sliced onion. Got great reviews at the gathering I took it to. Everyone wants the recipe.

I have made this recipe a few times and my husband loves it!  I substitute seasoned rice wine vinegar for white vinegar and also use olive oil in place of vegetable oil.

I had fresh garden veggies that give off a lot of water naturally, so I skipped the  1 cup of water as it was not was not needed. Also used only 1 tablespoon of honey and 1 of sugar. Good base recipe. This is one you can play with. If you prefer creamy, just toss a heaping tablespoon on real mayo in. Yummy!

My only substitution was grape seed oil, and it was great.  I was concerned about the pepper being too much, but it was perfect.  I did use 3 large cucumbers which I seeded since they were so big, and that was still fine.

Pretty good, although all the liquid needs to be strained before eating, and I would put in less white vinegar, and add pesto sauce, too.

This is a pretty good recipe. I've used it with the tomatoes, onions, and cucumbers and also with just tomatoes and red onion. I used the cup of water, white wine vinegar and only a  T or so of olive oil. I also only put 2T of sugar in it. I'll make this over and over.  Thanks!!

Very good. Don't worry too much about the tomato, cucumber, onion portions. Do what you like.  Next time I would reduce the sugar a bit. With homegrown tomatoes, you don't need that much sugar.. I used a good quality olive oil and let it sit in my fridge most of the day.

I substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil for a healthier option. I also only put 1 teaspoon of salt instead of two as I felt that was too much sodium for my particular diet. I also only used about half a tablespoon of pepper and a pinch of sugar. I sliced the tomatoes instead of quartered as that’s the way my mom did it. This recipe was delicious!

I took the basic concept and made a few changes. I didn't add as much pepper as given. I used a cucumber lemon balsamic and a plain EVOO. It was delicious and lasted for several days (it makes a lot and there are just 2 of us).

This was really good, reminded me of the cucumber salad my Grandma used to make.  Didn't give it 5 stars because I didn't follow the instructions completely.  I followed them except the quantity of cucumber, used halved cherry tomatoes I had left from something else and some chopped up onion.  Didn't add as much pepper either.  Will make again and again!  Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful salad. I only used one large cucumber and it was enough for me. I added a small minced jalapeno to mine to give it some Southern heat.

Perfect recipe. Reminds me of my dad's pickled cucumbers on hot summer days growing up. I have to say, it is far better with tomatoes and onions. So good!

I made this but substituted Apple Cider vinegar, Sweet vidalia onion and Olive oil.  However were I to make this again I would cut the oil back significantly or possibly eliminate it altogether. The first day was fine but on the 2nd day the oil had congealed and it was an unsightly yucky mess.

I used balsamic vinegar, olive oil and 3 teaspoons of Trader Joe's powdered Stevia extract. Very yummy and simple. I served it on top of falafel balls.

Made it exactly as written, except I didn't have a full 1/4 of sugar, so the sugar was about a tablespoon shy of the recipe. This salad is delicious! I am confident it would have been equally delicious if I had the rest of the sugar.

I halv-ed all these ingredients but even then I don't think I used 1/2 tablespoon of freshly ground pepper. It was more like 1/4 teaspoon but mine was finely ground black pepper instead of coarse.  Recommend tasting the marinade before mixing in tomaties, onions and cucumbers. People may prefer to grind more pepper freshly before eating as garnish but I wouldn't recommend putting more pepper in marinade at start.

I thought this was a wonderful salad. It was fresh, light and delicious. Everyone liked it. I was worried about a 1/4 cup of sweetener so decided to go with 2 Tbsp. I also only added 1/2 cup of water. For the sized cucumbers and tomatoes I had this worked out well. Very refreshing! I will make this more as the summer tomatoes and cucumbers come out.

This salad is very refreshing and so simple to prepare.  I like the milder flavor of the white vinegar though I have experienced the version with the bolder yellow apple cider vinegar and it is also quite nice.

Sorry Grandma Cash, but this recipe beats your basic cucumber and onion marinade I loved when I was a kid.   Spectacular!  I subbed avocado oil for vegetable, added a teaspoon of garlic powder, and accidentally used 2 tablespoons rather than teaspoons of salt.   Still came out fantastic.  I think next time I'll try a bit less sugar and definitely the called for amount of salt.  I didn't have any tomatoes to add but heading to the store to get some to do so next time!   I garden and have buckets of cucumbers so now I know what to do with the extra!

This recipe is amazing. I used 2 tablespoons of olive oil instead of vegetable oil, I used a cup of apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar, I used 3/4 cup of sugar and I used 1 teaspoon of pepper. I will definitely be making this again!!

Both my husband and I liked the marinade.  However, we are not great onion lovers.  So if I make this again I will cut back on the onion.

Only used a bit of pepper, used white wine vinegar and a little less sugar and it was the best!  Tangy  and sweet at the same time.

Didn’t add the tomato but it was still delicious.  Used apple cider vinegar. Lasted a few days and great way to use the cucumber glut from the garden.

I made this and because we’re a small family I used a Good Seasons Dressing bottle and reduced volume proportionately and substituted balsamic vinegar for half the vinegar.  I think I’ll use this again as a base for same salad plus artichoke hearts and fresh mozzarella. Might add herbs provenance or basil, oregano, rosemary, and thyme.

I have made this several times and the family loves it. The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly as written. It was a little too sweet for me. I cut down on the sugar and I thought it was a little better. I'm definitely going to continue making this. I'm thinking about adding olives to the mix.

I've made this all summer and am now making it with store- bought, plum, tomatoes since they are no longer growing in my garden. I could drink this dressing straight from the bowl!  Put this in your weekly rotation...You will not get tired of it and it is a delicious, nutritious,  low calorie recipe.

Followed most of the recipe—substituting rice vinegar and rice bran oil for the V&O ingredients (because this is what I had on hand).  It was a big hit— church picnic, and I’ll make it again!

Too sweet for my taste: I will definitely make this again but tweaked. When I made it, I subbed apple cider vinegar, 3 tbs of sugar, 2 cucumbers and two small onions.  I will definitely use only 1 tbs of sugar next time and less oil.  I use a mandolin for thinner slices on the cucumbers and onions. I did not use any tomatoes, but that's how I prefer it.

So simple,so delightful.
You can add anything and I even used this as a salad dressing.
I have substituted the sugar for Agave. I really loved that it was all homegrown and homemade.
Next I tried honey instead of sugar and worked so much better.
I love this recipe. Thank you

This is my go-to summer salad recipe. The only change is that I do NOT add the water. There is enough water from the tomatoes and cucumbers that adding more only waters it down and makes too much liquid.

I used only one cucumber and tomato and part of an onion and cut the dressing by half.  This is a nice salad that keeps well for a day or so.  It is light and refreshing and I will definitely make again.  Maybe experiment with other veggies and maybe some feta?

I grew up eating this. It was a staple all summer long with fresh garden cucumbers and tomatoes from my dad's garden. I made this exactly as is except for adjusting the pepper to taste.

I used red wine vinegar and had 5 medium cucumbers from my garden, 1 vine ripe tomato (from my garden) a few cherry tomatoes and a vidalia onion from the local market. All the spices were according to the recipe.  Brought it to a Christmas in July party and received compliments.

The combo is great but too much water. I would use 1/2 cup if using fresh cucumbers without the salt draining process.  Mine were in fridge for 5 days and tasted perfectly marinated. Just diluted w too much water!  Simple and  tasty!

Use either the full amount of pepper or add some ground hot pepper to counter the sweet.  A keeper recipe, esp. for not-so-great tomatoes.

I make this all summer long, but I use sherry vinegar.

Good either way though.

Very tasty and refreshing.  I made a few changes.  Red wine vinegar, no water.  There's still plenty of marinade.  Hardly 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.  I used 6 plum tomatoes, a large seedless cucumber and small red onion.  Marinated a few hours.  Very good!

I used only 1 tsp of salt and I added about 1/4 tsp of garlic granules. I use cherry tomatoes cut in half. I have used this recipe many times and get rave reviews every time I serve it.

This is a great recipe - when putting it together you just think there is no possible way this will taste good. I guess the magic ingredient is time, because after marinating it comes out delicious

1 tablespoon of pepper was too hot for me but I ate it, loved it and so did my family. Thank you!

I only added 1/4 cup white distilled vinegar and also cut the pepper down to just a teaspoon. You can play with it to get it just how you like it.

My favorite summer salad.  I didn't have the coarsely ground black pepper so I used some medium ground that I had.  I'll be sure to get the coarser grind for next time.  Still turned out delish.

A very simple and delicious salad.  The longer it marinades,  the better it gets.   I would recommend cutting back on the pepper to one tsp.

Very good! It’s a lot like what Sbarro used to serve. I made it just like the recipe except I used olive oil instead of vegetable. I haven’t decided if it’s a tad too sweet or not. I’m sure the more I eat it the better it’ll become.

I have made this recipe twice now and it has been great both times.  Very easy recipe that is quick to make and fits in great with a big gathering.

I made this according to directions.  Too much pepper.  Second time, I used less pepper and rice vinegar.  Not bad.

Made with some reviewers suggestions by substituting apple cider vinegar for white, 1 tablespoon olive oil  for the regular oil, and cutting back the black pepper to 1 teaspoon. Excellent.  Curious if anyone has tried canning this for later use, or will it become too soft?

Love this recipe although I cut way back on the sugar to about a tablespoon. I dump in whatever summer veggies I have on hand and have also added dill. It makes a pretty large batch which I keep in the fridge and dip out when I need a snack or to take for my lunch.

Nothing like home grown tomatoes and cucumbers to make this salad over the top. I handed the recipe because I didn't have the portions called for. Regardless it was fantastic and fresh and crunchy and tart. Everything good about summer fresh veggies.

Just made this again today with all home grown herbs and produce!  Skipped the water, used a tad more oil and vinegar, added finely minced garlic - about 3 cloves, swapped out celery salt for table salt and a handful of if basil and parsley chopped up fine.  Rest of the ingredients as written . . . Outstanding!  Everyone gobbled down, going to need to make more for me.

I love this salad, it feels really healthy and tastes great. I do use apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar, which I think improves the flavor, and I tend to stick to sweet onions, which are a bit weaker than red and allow the flavor of the vinegar to soak in more.

Made this and it is amazing! I omitted the water because I didn't use all three cucumbers and the dressing would have been too watery and it was deeelicious. Will make this again...probably tomorrow!

I loved this salad.  I  used  1/2 cup distilled white vinegar and 1/8 cup apple cider vinegar.  The rest was as written.  Sliced a shallot for my onion.  I will be making this again but will use apple cider vinegar.   Thanks for the recipe!!!

This salad was delicious. I used one English cucumber and 3 Roma tomatoes because that's what I had on hand. I wish I had put in more cucumber. I also left out the water. I didn't see a need for it. And I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and less pepper. It was a big hit at dinner. I made it around noon and let it sit in the refrigerator until dinner time. My 11 year old granddaughter took some in her lunch the next day. It really was even better the second day. We definitely will be making this again.

I can eat this salad every day!  I add in a big handful of fresh parsley and a pinch of sugar to balance the vinegar. I use balsamic and red wine vinegar and let this salad sit for a little bit- worth the wait! Yum!

This is delicious, so simple and great to take for a gathering. I don't think it needs the water but the dressing is simple enough and forgiving to make to your liking. I use canola oil and sub the vinegar for whatever I have on hand I. E. white wine vinegar or rice vinegar. I also keep the peel on the cucumbers, lots of nutrition. Enjoy!

Outstanding! This recipe proves it doesn't need to complicated to be delicious! Made it for a family picnic and everyone asked for the recipe. Used olive oil & champagne vinegar. Only added about half the water because the salt will cause the cucumbers will break down & add plenty of moisture/liquid. Delish!

This will be a summertime classic for my husband and me-- low-calorie vegetables with basic staple ingredients you  already have in your pantry.  The flavor seemed well-balanced with the ingredients written as is.  I did not have white vinegar available, so I used the apple cider vinegar and it turned out just fine.  It would be an easy and well-received offering to make for a large crowd/picnic/family reunion.

This is very good. Next time around I will add less water don't even know why it is in there as the veggies have juices.  I cut way back on the sugar.  I dice my tomato small and the onion cut smaller.  The tomato is key in the taste.  I have used different types of tomato and it does alter the taste.  Some tomatoes are sweeter than others.  I make this a day in advance and when I make the liquids I wisk them in a bowl but put the mix in a bottle . I cut the veggies and add the mix afterward I can control it. Seeing others comments I might change the vinegars to add a bit more zest.  One key issue is to make it a day in advance the flavors mix better and it gets colder.  It is a winner and very healthy.

Made it the recipe way the first time - my husband loved it but asked for smaller veggies. So this time I used small seedless cucumbers sliced, cherry tomatoes quartered and sweet Vidalia onion in quartered rings.

Half the salt(must watch mine) with apple cider V instead of the white V.  Half the pepper.  Also used virgin olive oil.  It was absolutely delightful.  Just like mom use to make.  Takes a big bowl and toss the salad frequently, each time you gather a serving.

Loved this! My husband prefers it to just soaking cucumbers in vinegar. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of olive oil for veggie oil (on a soy free diet). Turned out great and so pretty (used purple onions) too!

I love it!  It was a bit sweeter than I prefer. I like it a little tart but not a lot so I will reduce the sugar next time to 1/8 cup.

I liked this recipe a lot as is. The second time I made a few changes based on others reviews. I decreased the oil to 1 TBS and the water to 3/4 cup. I increased the vinegar to 3/4 cup and substituted 3 packets of Equal for the sugar. I also seasoned to taste with garlic salt. I dice the onion and tomatoes as I have picky eaters that don't like big chunks of them. This recipe is fantastic and easy to tweak to your personal taste.

Oh so wonderful!  Perfect  mix of ingredients!  I used Truvia (the baking version) so it was also great for dieters or diabetics!  Even the 2 year old guest loved it, as baby tomatoes are one of his favotite foods! Will definitely be making this again!  Thank you!   I might even try adding fresh garlic next time!

This was a great salad. I thought 1 tbsp pepper was a little much, but for me it was perfect. I have a go to salad like this but couldn't find it so I used this one. I also like it better with apple cider vinegar. Other than that, it's a keeper. Thanks :-)

Very good! I left out the onion because I don't like them and it still has more than enough flavor. Easy recipe if you have an abundance of cucumbers and tomatoes in your garden like I do!

I make a similar salad, but just use bottled Italian dressing and the vegetables then marinate for an hour or so.  So much easier.
