Oh, my!  Wow!  I never had parsnips before and I could not beleive how sweet and delicious this soup was.  I made the following changes to lower the fat: a little olive oil in place of butter and nonfat milk in place of cream; it was delicious even with these alterations.  I also added a little ginger and served it with notfat yogurt on top.

Super!  Really filling.  I chopped up an apple and added it near the end- gives it an extra fresh flavour.

Apart from adding some freshly ground pepper, I followed the recipe exactly. Absolutely delicious. I'll definitely be making this again. Thanks!

Excellent!  I am going to double the recipe when I make it next it went to fast.  I didn't have heavy cream, just added milk and it came out great.

Deliciously different! Like the recipe states, it's an excellent meal starter (is not hearty enough to use as a main course).  When I used my hand mixer to blend it, some small bits remained intact but that added a nice texture.  If you prefer a totally creamy soup, you would have to use a food processor.  The curry wasn't too hot but it does creep up on you a little more with every spoonful so next time I'll decrease the amount of curry, but only very slightly. This is the type of soup one would be served in an upscale restaurant. Thanks for this unique, sophisticated recipe!

This was my first time cooking with parsnips, and it was a great success!  I don't know if my new curry powder was extra hot, but it was very spicy!  My husband loved it, but we added yogurt to cool it down a bit.  I used whole milk, so this also probably helped thicken it up.  I'd recommend the addition.

It was good. I think the name should be changed to Curry Parsnip Soup. You must like curry to enjoy this soup

Loved it! I had a pink & chocolate color scheme going on so I was generous w/ the paprika & I added a tbp of tomato paste to add a little "pink". Turned more orange than pink but oh well. ;o) I've never had parsnips before & was very surprised that they tasted so much like carrots. I served this as a first course in a very tall, slender shot glass  (I felt so Top-Chefish! LOL) paired w/ Bacon Wrapped Water Chestnuts II. Thanks BUTTERCUP8!

This soup was fantastic!  For more of a bite I added crushed red pepper (1/8 teaspoon?) while sauteing the garlic and curry powder.  Perfect!  It just barely made me sweat.

First time I tried parsnips. Really good! The recipe is good as is, but to make it more to our taste, I used only 1 tsp of curry powder and added a dash of ginger. To cut calories, I used fat free half & half in place of the cream & light butter in place of the butter.

Just made this soup and it turned out great! The only thing I changed to cut on the calories but keep the creaminess, was to sub in 2% plain greek yogurt. It gives it the same creaminess but is absolutely delicious, and adds extra protein! I'm going to try adding an apple next time. Yum!

I was not impressed by this recipe. This was the first time I had ever cooked with parsnips and didn't care for the flavor of them. I've had the Curry Pumpkin soup from this site and it was absolutely fantastic! I love the curry in this one, but thought this soup was a little bland with an overwhelming "carrot" taste, which is basically what a parsnip is. Go for the Pumpkin soup instead. It's much better.

Good, I used broth in place of the boullion and water.  I also didn't add the heavy cream and I thought it was great without the added calories.  I had to spice it up with some cumin and white pepper to improve the flavor though.

this has been my all-time favorite soup since I discovered it on a video put out on Dr. Mercola's website. An english lady makes it step by step and calls it Curried Parsnip Soup. It stole my heart.
Her only difference is instead of using cream, use about a cup of sour cream at the end and fresh ground pepper. You can also up the curry to taste. She also uses either chicken or vegetable stock exclusively. This is so wonderful...I highly encourage you to try it...and try it my way, with the sour cream. It is the best.

The curry powder you use in this recipe makes a lot of difference.  The first time I made it with Trader Joe's curry powder and it was just ok.  The second time I used some massaman curry, and wow was that good.  You can punch up the spice a bit by adding some tumeric, garam masala, or smoked paprika.  I also cut back on the butter and used milk instead of cream to make this healthier.  Neither was missed.

I didn't know what to do with all the parsnips I got from the CSA (mixed box of produce).  This was the perfect recipe.  Simple, yet tasty.  It really brings out the usual flavor of parsnips.  All the ingredients were right on.  I didn't make any adjustments.

A great spicy soup!  I have never used parsnips before and needed to find a recipe.  This was wonderful!  I used green onion because that is what I had and it was delicious!

I loved this soup, and although I thought it was a great main course, my audience thought that this was more of an appetizer. But it's delicious and has amazing flavor.

I have never known what to do with parsnips other than put them in stew/soup as an addition. I've never made a soup with them as the base before. This was great! I just used regular curry powder and found that 2 tsp wasn't enough so I probably used the wrong kind. I ended up doubling the curry powder. I also added a little agave nectar because the parsnips I bought turned out a little bitter, and a little extra garlic powder. I didn't have regular milk so used 1C (1/2c wasn't enough) of unsweetened almond milk. The agave nectar cut the bitterness of the parsnips and blended quite well with the curry powder. Thanks for the great recipe!

We really like the taste of this, but feel that it is more of a curry base than a soup. If you like curry, you will like this.
We will make it again, but we will be adding some shredded chicken & some veggies to make a meal that has a little sticking power.
We supplemented the parsnips with potatoes to get the required amount for the recipe because we didn't have enough parsnip alone.

SO good, and yes, it is a curry soup - probably would be good to have it in the title, but as soon as you see 'curry' in the ingredient list, you know that it's going to taste like curry, imho.  Absolutely fabulous and so easy!

When I made this soup I wasn't sure my boys (4 & 10) would eat parsnips, so we called it" Magic Flying Soup". They loved it so much one requested it for his birthday dinner.

I really enjoyed this recipe -- absolutely delicious! I added two bay leaves, about a tablespoon of paprika, a smidge of garlic powder, and a medium-sized sweet potato to give some extra color and flavor, used soy milk instead of whipping cream (I was cooking for vegans, the soy milk worked just fine), and added a touch of flour to thicken it. Excellent served with or over rice... the addition of the rice will make a meal. Wheat breads also work nicely!

Delicious! I could eat a bucket of this soup. I used a sprinkle of turmeric and ginger and used whole milk instead of cream. I will make this again and again. I think it would be a nice addition to our Thanksgiving dinner. Thanks!

I didn't have boullion cubes (and I don't like to use them because of the MSG in them). I used Campbell's Ready To Use Chicken Broth with 25%less sodium. Other than that, added more garlic (can never seem to get enough) and I used 2% milk instead of cream since I didn't have cream on hand. I garnished the soup with American Saffron. The result was fantastic. Perfect, exactly what I was hoping for.

Since my daughter is a vegetarian, I substituted a large can of frozen apple juice and white wine and added enough water to make 3 1/4 cups liquid for the chicken bouillon cube. I also added some poultry seasoning and 2 bay leaves. This also makes it low in sodium and it tastes great!

Amazing.  I let my friend taste this and was informed it was my new potluck dish! I serve it with a little bit of Parmesan cheese on top or seasoned croutons on top. Who says students have to eat poorly!

So incredibly delicious! I used whole milk instead of cream and it turned out great. I also added some chopped up apple as another reviewer suggested. Best thing I've eaten in days!

I absolutely loved it - my partner didn't like it at all (tasted too much like parsnips apparently for my partner). I added a tiny bit of crushed ginger to the pan with the onions and garlic. I didn't add any milk or cream, it was delicious as is.

I really enjoyed this, and I would definitely make it again. I'd never had parsnips before, and was looking for a recipe that was simple and that I basically had everything on hand for.. I didn't have any cream or chicken bouillon (I know, shame on me!) So I did my best substituting them, and it turned out well. I usually experiment with recipes, but I'd like to make this again and actually follow the recipe :)

I didn't have any onion so i just sauteed the parsnips with a bit of onion powder.  I also added about a tablespoon of molasses to give just a hint of sweetness and cut the slight bitterness of the parsnip.  I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of the cream.  These changes resulted in a very yummy thick cream soup.  I would make this again.

I followed this recipe as exactly as possible and while it smelled fantastic while cooking, it tasted rather bitter.  I've never had parsnips before so maybe I just don't like them.  Maybe my soup was too hot when I added the cream and it burnt. Or maybe my parsnips weren't ripe.  I'm not sure, but neither my husband nor I finished our bowls.

Excellent! We eat soup every night with dinner and I love having this one in our rotation! I did not use the heavy cream and the curry really complimented the parsnip's flavor! I tripled the recipe and froze the other portions. I defrost it with some extra water - as the soup thickens once it cools.

I just made it.  My parsnips were on the large size; so I don't think it was as sweet as it would be with smaller ones.  But it is delicious.  I julienned the parsnips in my Cuisinart -- much easier than cubing by hand.

I haven't added the cream yet.  It's awfully good without it, but it's the holidays so I may be more naughty than nice.  Has anyones used condensed non-fat milk instead of cream?  I hear it's a good substitution, but it taste funny to me right out of the can.  I wonder if that taste would disappear in a soup, especially a spicy one.

I love the taste of the curry with the sweetness of the parsnips.  To make it lighter and vegetarian, I used 4 cups of vegetable broth and instead of the water, bouillon and cream, 1 tbsp oil instead of the butter, and I also added a tsp of grated fresh ginger.  I received rave reviews on the results.

Fantastic soup.  I think it tastes better the next day.  I used fat-free half-and-half and added a little more water and an extra bouillon cube.  I agree that the curry can be a little warm so keep that in mind.

This soup is very unique and tasty!  I added some cream cheese and a bit of celery and used a shallot not a full onion.  I used a hand mixer which leaves it quite chunky.  I will use my food processor next time for a smoother texture.  This is a great autumn/winter soup.

A tasty soup that I made with half-and-half instead of cream, and olive oil instead of butter. This recipe makes four small servings--it is definitely not a meal in itself--but with bread or other small side it is a nice light meal. I served with sriracha sauce (drizzled on top) for extra spice and prettiness.

Very good! I omitted the cream to make it healthier (and didn't even substitute with milk!). Next time I may try adding in some other spices or add in almond milk to see how that changes the flavour. Definitely a great recipe to use up leftover parsnips.

I had 6 pounds of parsnips and onions from the garden to use up, so I made a huge vat of this soup. Only changes I made were to make it vegan, using vegetable broth in place of the chicken broth and coconut milk in place of the cream. It turned out well (which is good because now I have 20 portion containers of it in my freezer).

this recipe was a big disappointment. I found that I disliked the combination of the sweet parsnips with the curry powder. Perhaps it would be better with coconut milk. But ultimately, if I'm going to go to the trouble of making a soup like this, I think that squash or pumpkin soup would be yummier.

Outstanding!!! I just made this today and it is amazing. I love to read reviews but am not a big reviewer but felt the need to write in. I followed it to a tee ( except I used better than boullion instead of a cube ). I was making it ahead of time so was just going to add the cream tonight when I reheated it, but after testing it, I don't even think it needs it. I am sure you could add it if you like, but I don't feel anything is lost by omitting it and it makes it a bit healthier. I don't even like parsnips and this soup is amazing!

This was quite good! I made quite a few adjustments as I had made a roasted vegetable dish a week prior and had left over parsnips and turnips, so I chopped up both instead of using all parsnips. I also didn't have any curry powder so I substituted 1/2 tsp of cayenne and 1.5 tsp of sweet paprika. I also used milk and not cream because it's what I had and this still came out quite good. I added a dash of nutmeg at the end to bring out a bit more sweetness. Pretty yummy!

My first try with parsnips was a success!  I do not eat curry or even like the smell of it so I used allspice instead and came out with a deliciously satisfying dish that all three of my boys (1, 3, & 5) enjoyed.  My husband and I looked forward to eating the leftovers.  I also used whole milk instead of heavy cream and about 2oz more parsnips than the recipe stated. We also divided it into 5.5 servings instead of four.  It comes out to around 150cal per serving as I made it and was very filling.

I just made a big batch of this with the intention of serving it to guests tomorrow, but we just ate so much I'm not sure there'll be enough left! One of my guests is vegetarian, so I used vegetable stock rather than chicken - it turned out perfectly.

If you like curry you'll love this. I'm not a big fan, but it was creamy, smooth and a nice taste. I used 1 1/2 tsp of curry.

This recipe was so good, even with a couple major changes. We had parsnips from the garden but not enough, so I used 50/50 with carrots. And, when I realized that I didn't have curry seasoning, I used 1tsp Tumeric & 1/2 tsp paprika. Fantastic!

According to the comments, I cut down the curry powder to 1 teaspoon and it was just the right spiciness (didn't want to cover the parsnip flavor). I also put 1 Tsp ghee instead of the butter and omitted  heavy cream. Really liked this soup!

This is a heavenly soup! I had never eaten parsnips before, but since I love carrots, I thought I would give this a try. It is delicious and I don't change it at all.

This was great! I agree though, you need to like curry to like this soup. I didn't have enough parsnips, so I made it up with carrots. I also used fat free half and half (don't ask me how they make it fat free) and it had a thick texture. Super yummy, not too spicy. My husband loved it.

delicious soup! only thing i'd suggest is anyone who's first soup this is (like it was mine) consider peeling/prepairing the parsnips before you start frying the onions, just found i was rushing slightly, had to turn of the onions for short time whilst contiuned to prep!! and added a extra 50ml of cream, just to stop it being to spicy - came out fantastic!

Wow! Sweet and Spicy :D.  I used a bit more curry than called for and it was delicious!  I also veganized this recipe by using a nice olive oil instead of butter, soy milk instead of real milk and veggy bouillon instead of chicken.  Turned out great :D

I used 1 lb of parsnips and 1/2 lb of carrots.   I used chicken broth or  vegetable broth instead of just hot water.   Instead of curry powder I used 2 cloves of garlic, 1 tsp of fresh ginger, 1/4 tsp clove powder and 1/3 tsp fresh ground pepper. It is really yummy.

A lovely, thick, rich soup. I have never cooked with parsnips before and this was really good and easy. I don't agree that it has any heat at all, but I added about 2 pinches of cayenne pepper, which did the trick. And I do think "curried parsnip soup" would be a better name. (To me, "spiced" suggests pumpkin pie spices, but maybe that would be good too.) The soup is very thick and filling, I used 4 cups water and added a little skim milk at the end, just to make it a little less dense. But it really doesn't need improvement - it's delicious and perfect on this cold rainy night!

This just tastes like curry.  Which is good if you like curry, but it's not what I was expecting and if I want something that tastes just like curry I'll make curry.

This recipe turned out great!  As some had suggested I added some ginger and pureed the soup instead of using a hand mixer.  I used heavy cream as the recipe stated but then thinned it out with milk because it was a consistancy slightly smoother than whipped potatoes.  Next time I will just use milk.  Otherwise followed the recipe and loved it!  Will make again.

Although I had this recipe in May it would make an excellent winter soup on a cold day.  I served it with croutons which was a tasty addition.  It was very easy to make with the immersion blender.

I agree with Kimars review. This soup was very easy to make and extremely tasty. I used a food processor, so I had no "bits" (as the kids say) in it. I loved it! Thanks Buttercup8 for the recipie!
