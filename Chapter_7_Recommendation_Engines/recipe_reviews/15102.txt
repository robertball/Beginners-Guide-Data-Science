Best Shepherd Pie recipe I've found, yet! Go easy on the gravy or you'll have a "goopy mess" - I used 2 jars and it was plenty. And, for those like me who use instant potatoes, I'd advise making them a little runny, or you won't be able to spread them - the extra liquid will "cook out".

This is just good old down home cookin’ comfort food.  Shepherd’s Pie always sounded rather bland and unappealing to me. Why is it called “pie”? It’s more like a casserole. This was really yummy. Much better than I had expected. The recipe is very versatile. Use what you have. I used 2 envelopes of brown gravy. It was plenty. I used a can of French green beans and pre-cooked my frozen corn. I made real mashed potatoes. I only made this with 1 lb. of ground beef. This made plenty.  I added a dash of garlic salt (this adds to the flavor a LOT!) and plenty of salt and pepper. For cheese I had a bizarre mélange of leftover Swiss, Colby-jack , sharp cheddar, American and a bit of pungent Fontina. Instead of shredding it all on top I made a cheese sauce out of it all by melting it in the microwave with some butter and a little milk. I blended it all together then spread it over the potatoes. Doing with what I had, cooking the corn, making the potatoes, making the gravy and cheese sauce, increased the prep time considerably.  I made this in the afternoon to bake that evening. Couldn’t wait to try the leftovers for lunch..delicious! I welcome different ways to use ground beef. I will make this again.

Great Recipe!!  Everyone loved it!  I put some refrigerated biscuits in the bottom of the casserole as a crust.  I too only used 2 cups of gravy and that was more than enough to keep it moist.  The only other change I made was to layer shredded cheese on top of the meat mixture, then a layer of french fried onion rings, and then home-made mashed potatoes!!!  It was a hit!  This will definitely be a new regular in our home!!!

This was the best shepherds pie that I've ever made... I also only used 2 cans of gravy and 1 lb of beef, and it turned out perfectly!

This recipe is awesome.  My boyfriend just told me to "give that lady some stars"!  I substituted one can of cream of mushroom soup for one of the cans of gravy and used sharp cheddar in lieu of american cheese. Also, the store was out of the instant potatoes in the bag, so I used boxed instant (Hungry Jack) and doubled the 6 serving instructions which came out to just the right amount.  This is the 1st time I have ever made this and it turned out great.  I have already been informed that I will be making it much more often.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I thought this was a tasty, stick to your ribs dish.  I used frozen corn, (which I cooked prior to adding), real mashed potatoes, and shredded mild chedder. I also reduced brown gravy to two packets, which was PLENTY!

This was very good, I omitted the beans as most of the family doesn't like them, I only used 2 cans of gravy...I can't imagine using 4, it would be way too soupy, and I used shredded co-jack on top.  We all liked this.

Very good... The whole family loved it and that’s very rare with my finicky bunch. I did make a few changes however. I added a few fresh mushrooms when I returned the ground beef to the pan. I also used 2 powdered gravy packages instead of the canned gravy. The yield on this recipe is more like 12 instead of 6, so I made 2 pans one to freeze. DELICIOUS!!!!

THIS IS A GREAT AND EASY RECIPE! WE LOVED IT AND IT IS EVEN BETTER THE NEXT DAY FOR LUNCH (IF THERE ARE ANY LEFTOVERS).  I DID MAKE A COUPLE OF CHANGES - I USED ONLY ONE CAN OF BROWN GRAVY AND A CAN OF CREAM OF MUSHROOM SOUP AND I ADDED A LITTLE ONION SALT. I 'M CERTAIN THAT I WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN!

It was good but 4 cans of gravy were wayyyyy too much, it made it really soupy.  Try 2 cans instead.  Also, if I were to make it again, I would use shredded cheddar cheese instead of the american cheese.

this was soooo good. I made this last sunday night. 
I substitute the whole kernel corn with cream style corn, and the beans with blanched frozen peas. I couldnt find canned brown gravy so I used a package of Au Jus Gravy and a package of cream of mushroom soup. I mistakenly added 5 cups of water and had to simmer the gravy for more than an hour to reduce the water in it. 
I also used real mashed potato from Nigella Lawson's show and hide the cheese between the layers of the mashed potato. 
Couldnt finish it in one night, so I refrigerate and only had the time to finish it last night. my partner licked his plate clean. Somehow, i think that this gets better overnight.

This was very tasty. I cut this in half for only 1 lb. of beef and used dry packaged gravy mix that made 2 cups. I used a frozen peas and carrots blend and some frozen corn instead of green beans. I did add a dab of minced garlic and some kosher salt to the beef during cooking and about 1/2 tsp. Kitchen bouquet to the gravy. I only had a quarter of a Texas sweet onion. The family liked this and like my hubby said you just can't go wrong with meat and potatoes and gravy, so it was a real man pleaser. Thanks Auntrene!

Good!  Spicy variation:  Left out the gravy, and added 1 sm. can chopped jalapenos, and used real mashed potatoes.  Topped meat and veggies w/ shredded sharp cheddar, and topped potatoes with pepper-jack slices.  awesome!  (1 lb. ground beef was adequate we thought).  Thanks for sharing

This was very tasty!... I will make it again! I used shredded cheese  that I had on hand putting some on top of the meat mixture then some over the potatoes; I  also followed tips and used only 2 cans of gravy... It was still a bit saucy.  I added sliced mushrooms and substituted peas for green beans, using only 1/2 can of each peas/corn.  A tip of advice I would give is use thick mashed potatoes!.. Then most importantly, you need some biscuits to get every bit off your plate!

I'm not sure if it's the beef mixture or just the dish in it's entirety. I made this as a "hey I'm going to the store tomorrow, but I have the ingredients to make this today". I should've gone to Kroger's. This turned out a goopy mess for me. I used a jar gravy and things were just too salty, wet and the cheese helped to meld the dish together. Will not be served in this house again.

I made a few alterations to this myself, but the basic profile of this recipe was great.  I was looking for something easy with not too many ingredients.  The four cans of gravy I just assumed was a typo and only used 2.  I used peas and corn and mashed real potatoes (as if my 8 yr old would eat 'fake' potatoes).  It came out great - with the exception of the cheese.  Will not add cheese at all next time.  It was better the next day and my daughter (per her choice) took it to school for lunch for the rest of the week.  Will definately hold on to the recipe.

This was excellent!  I did make a couple of adjustments, as the 4 cans of gravy made it extremely soupy.  I just used one can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 small can of brown gravy, and that was plenty!  Also, we are not too big on beans, so I replaced those with a package of sliced mushrooms and used shredded cheddar instead of American cheese!  It was a huge hit!  My boyfriend is a radio talk show host (and also a GREAT cook) and he loved it so much he raved about it on the air several times.  Now I am getting requests for the recipe from his listeners!

Very good and easy. I made a couple of minor adjustments. I used one pound of ground beef and used real mashed potatoes instead of flakes because we like real mashed potatoes better, but I understand that flakes are a time saver for some. Also, I added a can of cream of mushroom soup instead of the gravy. One can was plenty because I only used 1 lb. of ground beef. I also added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce for added flavor. This helped! The taste was great!

home made? What's home made using canned vegetables, package of potato flakes and bottled sauce?
That's warming up, not cooking. Sorry.

I made this for dinner tonight and my husband and I loved it. I did make some changes though. First of all, I don't buy canned vegetables, so i added two cups of frozen mixed vegetables. I browned the hamburg meat and onion, and for the gravy I thickened a can of beef broth, that was plenty. I also boiled and mashed 4 potatoes. I put all ingredients in a round casserole dish, and topped with shredded mozzarella cheese. This was  the perfect meal for a cold night. I'll be making this again!

This was really good.  I made my own mashed potatoes and used 3 cans of gravy because 4 just seemed like too much, and it turned out great.  I also sprinkled shredded cheddar cheese on top instead of American.

This is a lovely twist for sheppards pie lovers. I made it with real mashed potatoes and mixed in  some mashed sweet potatoes too. It was an absolute hit. Hint, put lots and lots of cheese.

My whole family likes this and it's so easy to make. I personally use real mashed potatoes and only corn. When I didn't have brown gravy to use I made my own from 1-2 cans of beef broth. I also use more cheese, my family loves it real cheesy!

This was a very good Shephard's Pie. I followed the recipe to a T, with the exception that I used homemade mashed potatoes. Also, after reading the reviews, I cut the gravy down to a little bit less than 2 jars. I shared with some coworkers and they LOVED it. Will def be making this again!!

I do not give 5 Stars, but I must with this one.  The only thing I did was to add potato flakes to thicken the liquid.  I also added just a little finely grated sharp Cheddar Cheese to the hot potatoes.  Everything else was as directed.

I made this over the weekend.  It was awesome.  I added in a can of mushrooms, but next time I think 1 can less gravy it was a little too soupy the first day.

I am not a fan of Shepherd's pie, but sought a recipe because my husband, who is fussy, likes it.  This recipe was GREAT!  It was simple and tasty and even "I" liked it!  I took the advice of others and only used 2 cans of gravy.  I also drained at least 1/2 of the fat while cooking the meat because Shepherd's pie tends to be greasy. I will definitely make it again.

My husband is a meat and potato kind of guy and this one fits the bill perfectly. I like it cause of the vegtables, I always add carrots too. I just like the colors than in the dish. I have made this a couple times changing the potato and cheeses. Very versatile recipe and have even made it with packaged gravy because that is what I had on hand. I suggest 3 packages though but 2 jars of gravy are perfect. Hope you try this cause it's GREAT!

WARNING!!! This recipe has something wrong with it!  DON"T use 4 cans of gravy and DON"T use 2 pounds of beef!  It makes WAY TOO MUCH and does not all fit in the 9x13 baking dish!  I wasted money making this. It is also very bland and came out like stew.  The mashed potatoes also were not enough to cover the whole dish and were too thick to spread.  Definitely needs some spices and more ingredients for flavor. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS RECIPE AT ALL.

GOod basic recipe. I used actual mashed potatoes (about 6 medium sized Russets) that were mashed with salt, pepper, butter, roasted garlic and a dallop of sour cream. Definitely added a lot of flavor. I used a shredded mozza and Cheddar mix in the actual mashed potatoes and on top as opposed to the American cheese slices. As well, I used two packages of gravy mix with 2 cups of water instead of canned.

I made this last night. It was pretty good. The Irish husband and his dad loved it. I only used 2 cans of gravy, one mushroom and one beef. 4 cans would have been waaay too much. I passed on the cheese. I've never had Shepherd's Pie with it, and I didn't want to ruin a good meal. I did however mixe in a few dashes of tabasco sauce to give it kick. I'd make this again, especeially on a cold day. Very hearty! Oh, altogether we ate 6 servings and I still have a half of pan left!

My family thought this casserole was okay, but not exceptional.  I reduced the cans of gravy to two and it was still plenty soupy.  I prefer my old recipe which uses a sauce made of 2 cans (8 oz. ea.) tomato sauce, 4 tbls. each of brown sugar, mustard and vinegar, plus some added water, instead of beef gravy.  You put garlic in the mashed potatoes plus stir in a beaten egg into the potatoes before piling them on top and topping with plenty of cheese.  It may be that we are just more accustomed to the "sweet & sour" tomato taste and it is challenging to develop new tastes.

Oh so yummy. I assembled it a little differently and halfed the recipe because there were far less mouths to feed that night. I did only use one can of gravy or it would have been too soupy.

This is a wonderful tasting dish that is fairly easy to cook.  I cut the gravy in half and added some seasoning on the ground beef when browning.  I've made it several times for several people, and they keep wanting the recipe!  I will make this again... and again... and again...

After reading other reviews, I used one package of cheap mushroom gravy, one can cream of mushroom, ground turkey instead of beef, steamed baby carrots and a can of green beans. It turned out great. Thanks for the idea!

This was really good. I made my own mashed potatoes, and used two packets of powdered chicken gravy instead of the 4 jars, per other reviews. I turned out really well like this. I found that it was also nice cold! Not gourmet, but good old comfort food.

Great recipe - although I made a few changes....I made up my own mashed potatoes and used shredded cheese instead. I also used a packet and a half of the powedered mix for my gravy. It made about 1 1/2 cups - it was plenty.

This is a great fast, easy budget dinner! I like to substitute shredded Cheddar for the American slices, and if I have a little extra time, I sub homemade mashed potatoes (using the Traditional Mashed Potatoes recipe). ALso, I tend to use a little less gravy -- more like 2.5 to 3 small cans rather than 4.

I just used two jars of gravy and i think it was plenty. I this four may be too much for this. But it was a very nice way of sneaking in the veggies for a two year old who would rather not eat them. I used shredded cheese rather than slice and it was wonderful.

Great Recipe! I made this for my husband whose favorite food is shepherd's pie and he said it was the best he's ever had. The only change I made was to use shredded cheese on top instead of sliced cheese. I also served it over open face Hawaiian Rolls. Delicious!

Very tasty meal.  My husband and I love this version of Shepherd's Pie.  The only thing I added was more seasonings to the meat (season salt and garlic powder).  I also spread shreaded cheddar cheese and French fried onions on top of the mashed potatoes.

This was a real good down home filling recipe. I made half the amount because only 2 of us to eat it. Only had 1 can of gravy so made 1 cup beef broth. Added some garlic. Used real mashed potatoes and shredded sharp cheddar. used peas and corn. It did seem a bit soupy so I simmered a bit and added some wondra gravy flour and it was fine. I couldn't imagine using instant potatoes. Or american cheese but that's just us.. I'll be making this one again soon!

Sooo good!
I only made a couple of changes:
I didn't add the green beans, I made real mashed potatoes, and I shredded cheddar cheese on top.
This is a keeper!

This recipe was a great base to start with.  Used only 1 lb. of elk burger, real mashed potatoes, small can of mushroom gravy, frozen mixed vegetables and shredded cheddar.  Had to spice it up with some Tony Chachere's, sage and garlic. Yummo!!!

I used two ready made pie crusts in 9" deep pie dishes instead of the 9x13 baking dish to help it hold together for serving.  It definitely was a hearty meal!  Very tasty.  As I am only cooking for two, next time I will cut the recipe in half - just enough to make 1 deep dish pie.

Yummy! I used three cans of vegetables with three cups of brown gravy and it came out perfect. This recipe created one 9x9 dish and one 9x13 dish for me and I wished I had doubled the mashed potatoes. Will make often in the future!

We really enjoyed having this for dinner.  I tweaked it a bit (like I do most recipes) by adding different extra veggies, and I didn't have any beef gravy so I used chicken gravy with a little worcestershire sauce for a more beefy color, and only made 2 packets instead of 4 cans of beef. It came out very yummy and was a real stick to your ribs meal. Definitely a comfort food when served with hot rolls and a green salad. Family is telling me to make it again and again.

This was simple.  My friend has a strong dislike for vegetables, so we left out the corn and the beans and I made mashed potatoes from real potatoes (only added an extra few minutes).  Very flavorful and filling.

My version of this turned out spectacularly.  I added a bit of garlic and some nutmeg, paprika, and sage (per Shepherd's Pie II) for flavor (yum!).  I also beefed up (hehe) the ground beef mixture with 8 oz mushrooms and 1 sliced zucchini.  For the gravy, I used 30 oz, part brown and part mushroom, which was more than enough.  For the mashed potatoes, I used three envelopes of garlic mashed potatoes (1 1/2 boxes), which seemed the perfect amount.  I also used shredded cheddar cheese.

One warning: even ignoring the fact that I added some additional ingredients, I'm not quite how this is six servings.  Mine ended up being more like 10 or 11, and we are not skimpy eaters.

Alterations: Used 2 packs of country gravy mix instead of 4 cans of prepared. Used Ground Turkey instead of Ground Beef. Used cheddar instead of sliced cheese.

This was a delicious, hearty meal that both I and my boyfriend loved. He cleared his plate, the highest honor a recipe could have!

A crowd-pleaser! I used regular mashed potatoes instead of flakes and substituted Veg-All for the carrots and green beans since that's what I had on-hand. Picky children, hungry hubby and friend who stopped by for dinner all loved it. Thank you!

3 jars is plenty of gravy.  
Put the cheese on with 5 minutes to go. Otherwise it will burn off and create a crusty brown coating.

I like this recipe will make changes though. Will use real potatoes instead of instant.  Only 1 can of gravy for 1 lb of meat.  And you deffinitely have to season the meat.  Will try again

This was delicious. I listened to the other readers and didn't use as much gravy. Also, I didn't think it was necessary to put cheese on top.

absolutley loved it. the only difference is i made the brown gravy from the packets instead of from the can (the cans would have been much easier, but i tend to do things the hard way) the meat was moist and perfect not dried out at all. and it was the weirdest thing, my boyfriend was stuffed after only one plate. a first for him! it is something to make for a crowd. and definatley something ill make over and over.

This is just a quick and easy meal that tastes great. I replaced the American cheese with shredded cheddar, added mushrooms, made a little extra potatoes and cut the gravy in half. Made it for my monthly meal that I cook for a homeless shelter and it was a huge hit.

I made this for a gift for grandparents this year.  I added red pepper, garlic, celery, chopped fresh mushrooms and some worchestershire sauce (not a lot).  Used frozen corn and peas, the 10 bag size.  I cooked the onion/garlic/pepper and meat in my cast iron skillet, then moved it over to a large stainless steel pot to add the frozen vegs...  I don't know how much this would make in a traditional sense, but it made 13 "pot pie" sized aluminum tins that I got at the grocery store.  I froze them un-baked and will add baking directions later when the time comes.  Seems like something that the older generation will like - and may make it again for us young folk, too.

This recipe was awesome! Like the others I tweaked it a little to better fit our taste. A little less than 2lbs of meat, 2 packets of potatoes (1 just wasn't enough! I used Betty Crocker's Roasted Garlic flavor...soo tasty!), 2 packets of gravy (I can't imagine using more than that) and used shredded extra sharp cheddar cheese to top it off. We will definitely be having this again and again!

This recipe was a little bland ... I would add some more favor with garlic powder, season salt, and worcestershire sauce in with the beef while it's cooking in the skillet. Other then that, this is the basic shephard's pie recipe!

So dish came out so delicious and hearty & plenty leftovers for the next day. Everyone licked the plate!! I twisted it to my pleasing: used ground turkey breast (seasoned with "all purpose seasoning"-spanish seasoning & puertorican "sofrito" & some tomato sauce to incorporate all flavors), used frozen mixed vegetables and shredded cheddar cheese.  Layered it like a lasagna starting with the mashed potatoes, meat, veggies, cheese and then another layer all over.

This is one of the first recipes in a long time that my husband hasn't turned his nose up at, and our not quite 2 year old practically licked his plate clean. I halved the recipe, and used leftover mashed potatoes. I also added some sliced mushrooms, and used a packet of beef gravy mix and a packet of mushroom gravy mix. I love how versatile this recipe is, thanks for getting my hubby to eat something besides grilled cheese!

Really good. My son is a picky eater and I usually only cook with basic ingredients so this works.   Here are the changes I make: 3 (7.6)oz potatoe flakes 1 can carrots instead of corn 3 (10.5)oz of powdered gravy packets (do not like canned gravy) topped with sharp shredded cheddar  Also, next time I am going to add mushrooms!!YUMMY

i made this yesterday and i will say this needs seasoning instead of salt i used garlic salt,pepper, and onion powder while cooking and browning my meat with the onions. i agree with everyone you do need to go easy on the gravy. i used a gravy packed mixed and used half of that. i also used instant mash potatoes and well i didn't have shredded cheese but kraft single's worked just as good. other than to much gravy and not enough seasoning it turned out good after making some adjustments. leftover are even better.

I volunteer at a ministry, and this dish was made to feed about 17 homeless members.  They absolutely LOVED it. I chose the recipe because it had the fewest ingredients of others I had found.  I changed the recipe to serve 20, and it expands well. As per the reviews, I only used half the amount of gravy, which was perfect. I also tried the meat mixture before putting it in a pan and found it was not as flvorful as I wanted, so I added some salt and pepper until it was where I wanted it.  After baking, I did not like the look of the cheese slices, so I sprinkled a LOT of shredded cheese over that, and it melted down in time and looked much better.  I already have requests to make it again.

My boyfriend had been asking for a Shepherd's pie and this recipe was a hit. I made a couple of changes. I made homemade mash potatoes instead of instant. I used 1 1/2lb ground turkey and added Worsechester Sauce (don't tell him) and agree with some of the other reviewers that 2 jars of gravy was perfect. And instead of making it like a casserole I decided to use a pie crust, actually 2 pie crusts.

Awesome! Easy and super good. I only used 1 lb of beef and 2 packets of gravy. Also used shredded cheese and a garlic seasoning in the beef.

I made a vegetarian version of this using veggie burger crumbles.  I used about half the amount of gravy in the recipe, which seemed about right to me.  Everyone in my family loved this, so it will become my standard shepherd's pie recipe from now on.

I made 3 dishes of this for my mom's 50th birthday party (Irish themed). Everyone loved it! It was so easy and everyone thought I put so much work into it. My husband asked me to put it in our normal rotation at home.

Followed the recipe to the letter and was very good.  My first time ever eating shepherd's pie and will make it again.  Next time I will add some hot peppers or hot sauce.

This is the only dish my husband has ever said he would eat for left overs.  The only change I made was using brown gravy powder which kept it from being too juicy.  This is a fantastic dish.

It's impossible to go wrong with this combination of ingredients! It's really good. I used this recipe as a suggestion and just made fresher choices on the ingredients. I made fresh buttermilk mashed potatos (8 softened in beef broth then whipped with buttermilk)and used fresh corn, fresh green beans, and organic shredded Cheddar. I used just over a 1 lb of meat and 1C of homemade gravy. That was plenty!  It was a very successful meal and made enough for at least 2 more dinners for me and my husband. Thanks!

I have never made or had Shepherd's Pie, but my boyfriend asked for it and this recipe was pretty good.  I really liked it, but I have nothing to compare it to.

I used real mashed potatoes and grated cheddar/mozza cheese for the top. I also used 2 packages of gravy mix, and added 1 package of onion soup mix for flavour, as well as garlic salt. This was my first attempt at shepherd's pie - and it was turned out great!

Rated it low so others will read and be warned. My wife who is new at cooking used all 4 cans of gravy. Although it was still edible and good. It was a goopy mess.

This is a very tasty and easy recipe, and my whole family loves it.  We don't eat beef, so I substitute ground chicken and only use about 1.25 lbs.  Like other reviewers, I find only 2 cans of gravy to be plenty and I use chicken gravy.  Everything else I do per the recipe's directions, although if I am feeling lazy, I will use onion powder instead of chopping up an onion.  It still tastes great and makes this a very quick and easy recipe!  I also find that it only needs about 20 minutes in the oven to melt the cheese the way we like it (we don't like it too browned).

I'm a college student and this recipe is very forgiving. I dont cook, but me and my friends loved making this recipe in our small kitchen. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants an easy meal. Also, we found that we only needed to add 2 cans of gravy rather than 4.

This meal was WONDERFUL for our family.  I used country crock's mashed potatoes (in the deli section) and it was good.  I should have spread the potatoes out more, but it was delicious.  My kids liked the pie with ketchup on it, as did my husband.  It was a family hit!

This was very good.  I only used three cans of gravy, omitted the onions (don't like them) and used homemade mashed potatoes.  I also left out the cheese as it isn't traditional.  Otherwise it was very tastey.

Very good.  I only used 2 cans of gravy (all I had), and it was good.  I wouldn't have used anymore even if I had it.  I think it would have been too soupy.  Overall, this was good and enjoyed by everyone in the house.
