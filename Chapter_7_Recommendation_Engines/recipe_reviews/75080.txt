I'm a big calamari guy, and this was pretty good. 
First off, DO NOT mix the steaks in with the sauce!!! I know I am not alone in this but I hate the breading I worked so hard to get perfect going soggy. Lay down your preferred pasta, top with the sauce, then lay the squid on top. . .
I'd watch for the steaks curling up on you when they cook, because it makes it harder not burn some parts and cook others when they refuse to lay flat. Next time I think I will cut my steaks in 1" strips (They're not as small as calamari but not as big as steaks) As Goldy Locks would say "just right". . .
I stuck to the recipe pretty good, but some additions I would reccomend are adding a few dashes of lemon juice to your basting milk and some cayenne to your breading (tang + zip = perfect for seafood). And then depending on what sauce you choose, I always like to sautee up some garlic and onion with a few spices before adding the sauce and letting it simmer. . . 
Try this recipe out. . . It's different, but its nice. . .

It was good, but needed a bit of zing. I threw some lemon and a bit of garlic into the pan, but that wasn't enough. I still liked it though. Will try it again.

I used a beaten egg instead of the milk to dip it in; and panko instead of bread crumbs, making the crust much crispier. I thought it turned out great and will definitely make it again.

I used this recipe, but made pork cutlets instead of calamari.  They turned out great.  The flavor was good and I followed one of the suggestions of placing the pork on top of the sauce instead of mixing them together so that the breading wouldn't get soggy.  Will definitely make again.

I'm only giving 2 stars because I may have done something wrong.  I don't know what but maybe it was me.  The breading just dissipated into the oil.  It was a mess.  Good thing calamari steaks are so cheap.  This was so ugly it never even made it to the table.
