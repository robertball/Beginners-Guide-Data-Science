I tried the regular size flaky biscuits and the grands. I found them both too doughy. I used regular frozen pie crusts and cut them with a 3" round cutter to fit the muffin cups. they slip right in. Turned out great. Used the recipe filling which is really good.

I made these for Christmas Eve Brunch and they flew off the platter.  I used a basic cream cheese dough for the crust (from Pampered Chef's recipe for pecan tassies) & I substituted onion flakes for the green onion and they turned out great.  Since I was limited on oven space the morning of the Brunch I made these a couple days before and put then in the freezer until that morning.  I placed them on foil and put them in the toaster oven until they were heated through and it was just like they were mixed up and baked right then.  I will make these again - great to have in the freezer to use for an appetizer for drop in company too.

YUMMY! I just finished my second piece. I didn't have the patience for individual tarts so I threw everything onto a Pilsbury premade pie crust. I set the cooking time for 30 minutes. Perfect!

I joined allrecipies just to write a review on this one!  A huge hit at our Mother's Day brunch.  Helpful tips:  Use Grands cut in half and then rolled out for normal size muffin tins. Light cream cheese was great...less greasy than regular.  Do not overfill the cups with the egg mixture so to avoid overflowing.

A delicious "flexible" recipe.  I can make these a couple days ahead of time for breakfast on the run. They're just as good reheated in the microwave.  I always make a spicy version along with this recipe as is.  I substitue spicy breakfast sausage, pepperjack cheese, 4 oz chopped green chiles and 1 tsp. of creole seasong.  Awesome.  My co-workers went crazy for this recipe.

This was a hit at the party last night!  I used sharp cheddar cheese in place of the Swiss and added some dried tomato sprinkles!  I split the biscuits in two and made 24 mini muffins (I used a whole package of 10 and 2 from another package).  If I would have had the time I would have doubled the mixture and made all the biscuits from both packages.  As it was there was enough mixture to make 24 mini tarts.

These were a hit at my daughter's preschool "graduation!"  I omitted the green onion due to small guests and their tendency to avoid all things green.  I also split the flaky biscuits in 2 and made them in mini muffin tins.  I thought this was much better - less pastry dough and more tasty.  I had leftover filling so I greased lg. muffin tins well and put the filling in without biscuits; they turned out terrific for my husband who is on Atkins.  Excellent all around!

VERY good!  I used puff pastry sheets rolling it out, using a large mouth glass to cut and place in muffin pans.  I used sharp cheddar instead of swiss and used lite cream cheese.  Next, I'm going to use MJ cheese and use green chilies!  And then try using cooked sausage with red bell peppers cut up fine.  Can't wait to try this out on my Sunday school class!!!

Excellent!  And the best part is you can cook & crumble the bacon and mix all the ingredients for the filling the night before and refrigerate. Then in the morning just put them together. I doubled the recipe and everyone enjoyed them immensely.

So good and I am always asked for this recipes whenever I bring it to a brunch.  My family loves bacon, so I do about 8 slices of bacon and mix all of it in, skipping placing it on top (they fall off when you do this).  The recipes easily makes 12, leaving you 1-2 bisquits left in case you rip one during the prep.  Also, as previous posters, I only use cheddar cheese.  Fruit salad, bacon quiche tarts and mimosas and you have a great, easy brunch!

These are awesome! Such an easy recipe, even a beginner like me felt comfortable making these. The reviews were really helpful for suggestions and substitution ideas. Here's what I did: I used halved Grand's biscuit roll dough for each tart, substituted Montery & Colby Jack cheese for Swiss cheese, and added an extra egg and about 1/3rd of a cup chopped spinach. I also used much more bacon than the recipe called for, about 12 pieces. I baked these at 375 for 25 minutes and they're perfect... the crust is crispy and flaky and the insides are perfectly done. I can't wait to make these for my friends and experiment with different fillings.

I absolutely love this!  I've made it several times and tried a different approach this time.  I used a can of flaky crescent rolls.  unrolled the whole rectangle into a baking dish, pressed it to the sides, poured my filling to cover, cooked it the same amount of time, then cut it into bars.  It is just as wonderful.  It took much less time to prepare this way.

I made these for a potluck and can I tell you, they were the hit!  My mouth is watering just writing about them.  I made a few changes to the recipe. I used 3 12 canned biscuits, light cream cheese and added an extra egg( total of 3 eggs).  I also used colby jack cheese instead of swiss.  I made 3 varieties.  I made a bacon and cheese, a spicy sausage green chili and cheese, and a green chili and cheese for my vegetarian boyfriend.  All three were delish!  This recipe yield about 29 mini quiches and 3 no biscuit quiches because I had extra batter.  I used a slightly smaller cupcake tin than the normal ones.  The only thing I would do different is turn the pans after 10 minutes because the inner side were slightly darker than the rest (even 2 burned! :( ).  Other than, I am making them for the next potluck and make a spinach mushroom one, too.  Oh one more thing, I made everything and put it together the night before, covered it with tin foil and put in fridge and baked it for 20 minutes the next morning and it everything came out great! UPDATE 5/27- made a vegetarian version with fake bacon and portabello mushrooms in one and fake sausage and green chiles in the other. Delicious! Tasted just like real meat! last weekend and put the extras in the freezer and fridge.  They still taste delicious in the microwave for 30-45 seconds! Tasty Breakfast to go!

These were simple to make and I got rave reviews! I didn't have any green onions, so I used finely diced red onion, and I only used about 2/3 of the package of cream cheese which worked out just fine. I used cheddar cheese instead of swiss, because that is what was on hand. I used an extra large muffin tin (like for Costco size muffins) as this was to be the main dish at our mini-brunch; the cooking time remained the same. Re-heated them in a 425 degree oven for about 9 minutes once at the venue.   Other than the ease to make and great base recipe that this is, the real show stopper was the caramelized onion I topped them off with once they came out of the oven (see my picture). I will make these again and again... Maybe next time using spinach!

I also made this into a pie, and used a pre-made crust. I doubled the recipe and made one quiche with swiss cheese and the other with cheddar. I have to say I preferred the cheddar as did everyone else. This recipe is a keeper!

I wanted something different then the typical breakfast casserole to bring to a brunch at work.  This is a great idea and a perfect base recipe that you can customize to your liking. I omitted the onion because I knew some people did not like onions. I also used Grands Flaky Buttermilk Biscuits (10 count) and divided each biscuit in half (crust turned out perfect- nice and golden and not to doughy). I used diced ham instead of bacon and cheddar instead of swiss, and added some ground mustard, salt & pepper. Everybody loved them and wanted the recipe. Because I was making for a large group, I kept the recipe more simple, to try and suit everyone.  Next time I will make for my family and try some of the suggestions of diced green chilis, green onions and bacon. Also, I tripled the recipe and it made more then enough filling for 30 quiches and my cook time was only about 15 minutes. I was worried about them sticking to the pan, but I used a non-stick cupcake pan and they popped right out. Thanks for the recipe!

These were ok..a little bland. I halved some grands & they still seemed too doughy/not enough egg. These definately need a little tobasco to the filling for a little more flavor. I'm not sure if I will make these again.

Loved these!  Tasted wonderful!  My Mom had dropped by the morning I was making these, so I sent some home for her and my Dad.  They called me soon afterward raving about how good "those thingies" were!  LOL  My oldest son doesn't usually care for this type of thing and was hesitant at first, but he asked for another!  I'll definitely be making these often!  Thank you, Donna, for sharing this recipe!

I make 2 versions of these and I go for ease. One is chopped up ham steak,swiss and chopped frozen spinach (drained). The other is bacon bits (I said I go for ease),onion and cheddar. The other big flavor addition is using whipped chive flavored craem cheese. Definitely use 1/2 the biscuit called for and the best part... they freeze well,350 20 minutes frozen Thanks for the recipe!

Based on the exact recipe, I give it a 4 star. The recipe works perfectly as is but is just lacking a little zing. After I made some adjustments for more flavoring, I give it 5 stars for sure! I added 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper, 1/4 tsp. black pepper, 1/4 tsp. salt, 1/8 tsp. sage along with the green onions (which I doubled) and 1 tbs. minced garlic because I put garlic in anything I possibly can. :-)Instead of adding bacon into the mix, I like to stuff a small piece of sausage in the middle after they come out of the oven. (see my picture) I also used crescent dough in place of biscuit dough, I found the big fluffy biscuit dough to be a little too doughy by the time the eggs were done.

*I increased the # of eggs to 6.

I made these for a baby shower and every single person LOVED these.  I had never made them and was nervous making a new recipe, but I am so glad I did.  

Some people have halved the biscuits, but I did not.  With the extra eggs, the combo was GREAT. 
I did half with mushroom/green onion for those at the shower that didn't want bacon and those were yummy too!  

This will DEFINITELY be made again!

Mine turned out cute and yummy. Used a cupcake pan; biscuits that came in 8 but only used 6 and cut it half to fit 12 cups (didn't feel like pulling out another pan at that moment). Used the same amount of mixture except the bacon. I had used more bacon than it called for to use up more space inside the cups, so that way, I can equally fill in the cream cheese mixture.

I made this for Easter breakfast.  They taste great but I will say a tad too much dough.  They were more Puffs than Tarts.  I will definitely try this recipe again but will suggest to divide up the biscuits or use a pie crust that you can cut smaller shapes out of.  Otherwise this was really good and my whole family enjoyed it!  Thank you!!

I love this recipe! I have been making it for months now and just decided to write the review! The only thing I do differently is to season the egg mixture the same way I do my scrambled eggs (seasoning salt, pepper and parsley to taste). Without the additional seasonings this was a little bland to me. Thanks for sharing! This is a keeper!

Great recipe! I doubled the recipe and made tarts and one in a pie crust. I had left it in the fridge overnight and made the pie for dinner and was just as great. I'll be making this often.

Used croissant instead of biscuit dough. Rich, flaky, and very easy to manipulate in the tins.  Can sub any shredded cheese and play with add ins. Great base recipe. These got devoured and are so quick and easy, will make again.

Tweaked recipe slightly, but it would have been great if I had not. I used shredded sharp cheddar, extra bacon, no onion, and used ref.crescent rolls.  I unrolled the dough, pressed the perforations together to make 4 rectangles, cut each rectangle in half, pressed these into one muffin cup; this made 8 muffins. Mixed all bacon into the egg/cream cheese/milk mixture. Did not sprinkle bacon on top. Used a spoon and filled each muffin cup up to almost the top. Baked at 375 in dark muffin pan for 20 minutes. Be careful not to overcook. Such an easy and excellent recipe! Would be great to make as mini muffins and serve to a crowd. This could be "fancied-up" by using a tart baking dish and would be perfect for brunch

After reading most of the reviews, used an extra egg (3 total), light cream cheese, MJ cheese.  I also added salt,pepper and a couple of dashes of tobasco. I bought the small can of Grands Flaky and cut each in half. I had plenty of cream cheese sauce left over after filling 8 regular cupcake holder. I need to stretch out the dough more on the side I guess.  I started baking at 375 degrees for 15 minutes and turned it off to let sit for 5 minutes inside but it was starting to brown too much so I took it out after 2 minutes. Next time, I will bake at 350 for 15 minutes and turn it off with the tarts still in the oven for an additional 5 minutes. It was tasty so I can see how it can be bland for some of the other reviewers if they didn't add any spices or tobasco.

my rating may not be fair because a few things went wrong with mine. 1). I accidentally bought honey flavored biscuts and 2). I made them much too large. They tasted like quiche to me and nothing special. I will re write my review when I correct the problems that I had.

Great party appetizer.  I made the following adjustments: double the green onions and add 2 extra strips of bacon.  I use the tenderflake mini tart shells and bake them for about 8 minutues before I fill them and than continue baking for 20 minutes once they are all filled.  Yummy!

This was a great BASE for easy quiche. I used regular buttermilk biskit refrigerated dough and rolled little pieces out,flat, till they were very thin, and I put them in a mini cupcake pan..then i sauted garlic, bell peppers,and onion together and then poured into egg cream cheese mixture. I only used half the cream cheese and  added one more egg... one more thing I thought was a GREAT addition from a previous review.... 1 tsp Creole seasoning. SOOOOOO GOOD!!!! THANK YOU!!!

Made this for breakfast & it is definitely a make again recipe.  Only substitutes I made as I did not have it on hand, instead of feta (not a fan) I used marble cheddar & instead of biscuits, I used Pilsburry croissants roll.  It still turned out wonderfully!  Great recipe!

Very nice little tarts.  Very easy, too!  I didn't have biscuit dough, but I wanted to use up some leftover pie crust.  So, I just rolled out, used a small biscuit cutter, and used that as the bottom crust instead.  I'm sure biscuit dough would be flakier, but it worked really well this way too--made it more quiche like with the crust.  The cream cheese adds flavor to this--I was a bit worried about it.  I ended up with 12 tarts--my one muffin tin makes smaller muffins.  I didn't bother topping with bacon--I don't need more of it anyway, as you can still taste it and these bake up perfectly in the time allotted.  These are great for little breakfasts with fruit.  Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic recipe!  I used Grands biscuits cut in 1/4's, substituted cheddar for swiss and real bacon bits (added directly to mixture), and baked for 17 minutes.  I also made a second batch with cooked/crumbled sausage and a 4oz can of diced green chili peppers.  Both batches turned out great...

This is an EXCELLENT basic recipe for an appetizer-- I was surprised at how well it worked in a mini-cupcake pan (24). I just split each Grands regular biscuit into 4 pieces, dropping one into each cup, then pressed them up the sides up the cups with my fingers to make a well.  I figured the filling might be somewhat bland, so I added salt, pepper,  a few dashes of Tobasco sauce, and a little less than one teaspoon of the bacon grease.  I used Cheddar Jack cheese, and I added some torn baby spinach leaves to the top of a few tarts-- a pretty tasty addition, and it adds nice color.  My only complaint is that a few quiches were browner than I wanted after cooking for 20 minutes.  I'll knock 5 minutes off the cooking time in the future, but this first batch is good enough that I'm going to freeze them to take to a baby shower.  :) Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Used ham and cheddar instead of bacon and swiss.  Made never fail pie crust instead of biscuits.  Could have used a little less cream cheese in it and a little more egg.  Will make adjustments to the next batch.  Overall a good breakfast/brunch/snack/light dinner!  Took an hour to make a dozen...but will probably be faster with practice.  Baked 18 minutes at 350, then turned the oven off and let them sit for 10-15 minutes.

I followed most of this recipe except that I used cheddar in lieu of swiss, added red and green peppers (diced and sauteed with the onions and some flour) and a flaky butter pastry found of this Site. Also I sprinkled some grated cheddar to the bases of the pastry to prevent sogginess.  The quiche was simple awesome! Will definitely make again and again and ..... Thanks Donna L!

These are fantastic!  They are becoming a staple for Christmas or Easter brunch.  They travel well too, just wrap them in tinfoil and heat them up.  I have done it over a BBQ and they were great.  I think these would be good camping too.

Wonderful!  I have made these with cooked bacon and also with real bacon bits.  The bacon bits speed up the process and are just as good.  I also have used dried minced onion when I do not have scallions.  Our guests love, love, love!  Thanks for a keeper!

Love this recipe - my girlfriends made these at my baby shower 3 years ago and I use it every chance I get!  Easy and delicious.  I use bacon bit-pieces as a time saver.  Tried it with sour cream in place of milk and sharp cheddar.  I usually make them in the mini-muffins - just spray the tins well before placing biscuit piece in the bottom.  Cook about 15-18 minutes at 350.  Kids and adults love them!

these tarts were scrumptious! i made a few modifications. i used red fat flakey biscuits (definately use half a biscuit for each muffin). i rolled each 1/2 into a ball then flattened with a rolling pin b/f placing in muffin cup. i also used turkey bacon and lite cream cheese. i also baked mine at 350 instead of 375 to prevent excess browning. i used swiss in mine and thought they were perfect! i wanted to eat more than one! great recipe, will def make again.

I have told several people about this recipe and all have loved it.  They work crustless, for those watching their carbs.  I ended up with more of the egg mixture and tried it.  Worked great.  This is a very versatile recipe.  Ham would go well in this recipe also.

I personnally do not like (or eat) eggs.  But my husband made these and he thought they were fabulous.  Followed the receipe then froze most of them.  Makes it very convenient to take one out to eat...pops it in the oven for about 20 min.

Very easy to make and adapt.  I used kielbasa instead of the bacon on some, and broccoli on others for a vegetarian friend.  It does make more than 10 biscuits worth; I was able to halve the recipe and fill 8 of the Grands biscuits. (If you're going to use the Grands biscuits, make sure you push them way down into the muffin cups).

I made my own biscuit dough which rose much higher than those in the picture.  I also used cheddar cheese instead of Swiss and added an extra egg.  It made 12 big quiches.  My family loved them.  They were so big we just ate them as our main meal with cheese grits on the side.  I also just put all the bacon on at once - did not add at the end.

Delicious and adjustable recipe. I used what I had on hand which happened to be sausage, 3/4 block of cream cheese, about 3/4 cup pepper jack cheese, and dried minced onion. Also used 4 eggs instead of two. I found one biscuit is perfect for the extra large size muffin pan and half a biscuit works great for the regular size pan. Turned out cute and delicious!

I altered the recipe slightly and added more ingredients.  I diced up one plum tomato and about a 1/4 green pepper and lightly sautéed it.  I let it rest to room temperature and then added it to the milk, egg, mixture. For the green onions, I didn't measure, but added the amount to my liking.  I used 1 cup of reduced fat Mexican blend cheese instead of a 1/2 cup. After stirring the mixture and adding it to the muffins I could only scoop one tablespoon.

I used big all natural flaky biscuits, there was only 8 in a can, but the mixture is perfect for 12 biscuit bacon tarts.  I also added the bacon to the top before baking instead of pressing it into the mixture at the end.

My tarts rose and filled the pan to form wonderful looking breakfast bacon muffins.  Next time I make these I will use half Mexican cheese and half Gouda cheese, and I will pre make the mixture over night to cut down the prep work in the morning.

Wonderful.  We go RV'ing with two toddlers, and this recipe is perfect for those trips.  It is versatile, and easily frozen for consumption at a later date. I have found you can include any ingredients to suite your taste in the egg mixture, but the flaky biscuits are a must.  I'm so happy to have found this recipe!

DAIRY FREE!
So I modified this recipe to make it dairy free. I used dairy free biscuit dough (food lion brand), sausage instead of bacon, toffuti cream cheese (only about 3 oz), no swiss cheese and rice milk. The result, not bad! I will make them again and try bacon!

Wish I could do 3 1/2 stars. The filling with really yummy, but never having used refrigerator biscuits I just bought the buttermilk ones (didn't buy flaky) and they were really icky. Too thick, too chewey. Also by the time I tried to spread them on the sides of the muffin tin they had already puffed up a little so only went 1/2 way up. I will try again, but with a different dough.

They were great for a Family Christmas Brunch, easy to heat up and very easy to make.  I would not use GRANDS biscuits to much biscuit even if split into 2 parts, maybe split it 3 equal parts so less biscuit.. Really really good though

Made these a few times now, great recipe.  The flavor is excellent and you can experiment with different types of cheese for new flavors.  Great to have a non egg tasting meal item for breakfast or brunch.   My only recommendation is do not use the oversized grand biscuits as they are too large.  If you need to use larger biscuit, I couldn't find the regular sized ones, cut part of the biscuit dough out of the middle and around the sides.  Otherwise it pushes the filling back out the top.

I made one minor change in that I mixed the bacon in rather than left it on top.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  This was good but not great.  Every once in a while I would get a bite of pure sweet which was a little strange.

I substituted neufchatel cheese for the cream cheese to lower the calorie count.  Substituting won ton wrappers for the biscuit also worked splendidly-  I'd highly recommend it for a lighter quiche

Love, love, love these easy little gems!  I used a 8 count Grands Buttermilk Biscuits rolls.  Seperated them in half and used equal parts of sharp cheddar and gruyere cheeses. They were a big hit. I finally had to tell the hubby to lay off  of them because we were having company :)

These little quiches were delicious! I made them with turkey bacon and I used the Grands biscuits and split them in half as someone suggested! They were very flavorful and were good at room temperature and even cold just like regular quiche! I will definitely make them again! I doubled the recipe and got 24 plus a little left over and they are good sized!

I think these are a really great idea (especially for kids on the go).  I brought them to a brunch party and most of them were eaten.  I do think they were a little dry, but I'm a beginner cook so that might just be my fault.  I like to cook on the healthy side so if I made these again, I would omit or use less cream cheese.

The taste is wonderful and the recipe itself makes a light, fluffy quiche that has the perfect texture.  The only thing for first-time makers that I had difficulty with was the ratio of mixture to put into my dough.  Next time, I may try pre-made filo shells or something similar that way I don't have to worry about over/under filling.  I also used pepper jack and added red bell peppers, yummy!

Excellent! The only change I made was to spray the muffin tins with Pam but I didn't touch the ingredients. They present very nicely and have good flavor.  I am going to try 1/2 bacon and 1/2 ham the next time for my Bunko breakfast. I know it will be a hit.

I made these little quiche tarts for a breakfast that I was hosting.  They were a hit!  I read many of the reviews prior to making this recipes, so I changed some of the items.  I made my own pastry dough which I prefer, however, next time I will use a 4" cutter, not a 3".  This way the round pastry comes up the sides a little more on a standard cupcake pan.  I also used cheddar cheese.  I used dried chives for the onions and it was great.  I did make my mixture and bacon the day before. I mixed in the bacon that morning before I cooked the tarts .  I also made the pastry cups the day before and just covered them and put them in the refrig until ready.  It was so easy that morning, just fill and bake.  I doubled the recipe as I needed more than 10 tarts.  I made 24 tarts and still had enough mixture for a whole pie or extra tarts.  Will make this again.  I think next time I will try this recipe in a large pie plate.

We are a household of quiche lovers, unfortunately did not care for this recipe.  I followed filling directions exactly and poured into a premade pie crust. The texture was a little weird with the cream cheese.  I think we like our quiche lighter and the cream cheese made it too rich.

I thought there was too much biscuit dough with these, as I have made similar recipes before. I preferred cutting the biscuits in HALF. I made 6 with no bacon and 6 with. They both had great flavor. Will use this one again & again.

This recipe was excellent!  Entertained guests for brunch today and they were a big hit.  I always read the reviews before trying a recipe and I followed several suggestions and made the following changes.  I baked the tarts at 350 degrees used three eggs and 12 slices of bacon which I mixed in with the cheese/egg mixture and separated the flaky biscuts in half. Will certainly make again.

These were so easy and good.  I made the egg mixture the night before and spooned it into the dough and they turned out perfect!  It did need a little more time to cook, probably because the egg mixture was very chilled.

Thank you so much for this simple and quick recipe! I used fat free cream cheese, colby cheese, Grands biscuits and Egg Beaters because that's what I had in my refrigerator. I peeled the Grands in half, used the equivelent of three eggs and mixed in the bacon with the cheese mixture as suggested. It worked out just great!

Theses were great and very easy to make.  I followedthe suggestions to use half of the dough and it was a wise idea.  The dough really fluffs up while baking.  I made the filling the night before and assembled the tarts in the morning.  Worked fine.  I added extra onion and bacon and liked the taste.  Make sure to roll the dough over the top of the muffin tin to keep the filing from spilling over.

I messed this up.  I didn't know which 10oz tube of biscuits to use, and what I bought was NOT right.  Each 'muffin' was 3/4 biscuit (dry!) with a little bit of (tasty)egg topping.  I wasn't even going to rate this, but I wanted to warn people to definitely use the right biscuits!

I used this recipe for Easter Sunrise Breakfast.  I baked them the night before and just put them in a crockpot to reheat this morning.  It worked great.  These were awesome and I just emailed the recipe to two ladies from church.  I will definitely make these again!

I made these for Easter brunch and they were amazing!  I did as others suggested and split the biscuits in half.  I also used cheddar cheese and just mixed the bacon into the cream cheese mixture. My 7 year old ate 3 of them in one sitting and he's the pickiest eater. I will definately be making these again. For the non-meat eaters I made another batch with spinach and mushroom sauteed in butter and then squeezed dried.  I used the swiss cheese for these. YUM!

These were good. I made them in mini-muffin pans - split the muffins in half (some even in thirds), and made 24 mini-tarts with the filling amount listed - which worked well for my brunch. Unfortunately a few of mine were really dark on the bottom, but the filling still tasted good, so we just scooped out the insides and left the shell. I think I'd like to try some without the bread as suggested in other reviews.

This is a great recipe, but the 15 min. prep time is a joke. Give yourself an hour, especially if you have to fry and crumble the bacon, and shred the cheese. I’ve made this with and without onions and it works great both ways.

My sister made these for a brunch I attended and they were wonderful.  Watch them closely so the bottoms don't burn.  BUY MORE BISCUITS because you are going to have lots of filling left over!

I served this recipe, as written, for Christmas brunch and everyone loved it.  I did find that the recipe made more filling than I had biscuits for, but it chills well and I just made up some biscuits from a mix later and used the filling and it turned out fine! Yumm! Definitely a keeper!

This were absolutely lovely. I made them without the bacon, and added some broccoli and spinach instead. A very nice veggie appetizer. You could also use the ready made puff pastry tarts. Quick and easy!

I served these tarts and a carrot cake to 8 girlfriends that I had over for coffee & breakfast.  Everyone loved them and they are a breeze to make.  I made a couple changes to the recipe by using half swiss and half cheddar cheese and adding 1/2 tsp salt.  Yummy.

I used this recipe at my Princess House Crystal Party.  It was a huge sucess.  There were none left over.  I altered it by making mini quiches and using pie crust instead of cresent rolls.  They were great.  Several people asked for the recipe after they realized they were homemade.    Thanks

This is a beautiful, impressive and delicious brunch item for any occasssion! I made the filling recipe exactly as written; however, I used the French Pastry pie crust recipe on this site to make the crusts, which I did not prebake. I simply rolled the pie dough and cut out 3-inch circles using a circular cookie cutter. I used the cut-outs to line the muffin cups, which I immediately filled to the brim with filling. Additionally, I did not sprinkle bacon at the bottom, rather, I sprinkled the (turkey) bacon crumbles on the top of each quiche prior to baking. My brunch guests loved them, including my picky seven-year old! I will definitely make this again! :-)

Great flavor! I used crescent rounds and prebaked them in the muffin cups for 5 minutes at 350f convection before filling.

Amazing! Made them for a bridal shower and everyone devoured them! I cut the biscuits in half which I think is a must. Also just put a small amount of mix in the biscuits or they will overflow.

We have made these for years in our house.  Great for snacking.  In place of the biscuit dough, I make the cream cheese pie crust recipe.  We also like breakfast sausage in place of the bacon sometimes.  I use the small muffin tin to make these in.  Nice bite size snacks.

This was tasty. I modified it based on items in my own cupboard and baked in a pie crust to make one large quiche. Kept well and my husband has enjoyed the leftovers so that is a winner.

Good taste but thinking it could be kicked up with some diced peppers or some hot sauce. Easy to make... To save time in the morning, the filling can be prepared the night before along with fixing and crumbling the bacon. I made Chef Jon's biscuit recipe on AR rather than the canned biscuits. Rolled dough to 1/4", cut into circles and placed in muffin tins - stretching slightly and pressing around bottom and sides; baked dough for 3 min at 425; then added the filling and baked at 375 for 18-20 mins.

These are so easy and savory. I usually mix up the filling the night before to save me from one extra thing to do in the morning. They're perfect for a brunch side or to have something warm to add to that continental breakfast as you're rushing houseguests off to the airport at the end of a visit. When I have friends come to visit, they often request these guys.

These were okay. Not enough bacon and the biscuit was too thick. It rewarmed very soggy.  (75)

These were a big hit at the teacher meeting!  I did break biscuits in 1/2 and it worked better and was more flavorful.  Made some with entire biscuit and it was too much bread.  I would omit the green onion next time around.  They did take a little longer to make because of the time it took to get the biscuit worked into the muffin pan.

This was really good, I made some tweaks based on previous reviews. I added more bacon, crumbled and mixed it all into the filling. I added medium spicy diced green chilies, added garlic powder and different cheeses (smoked gruyere, baby swiss etc). I made half the batch as mini tarts using 1/4 a grand biscuit, and the other half as mini tarts using wonton wrappers. Great recipe!

These were delicious -- they were the first item to go at my brunch.  I would recommend greasing your muffin pans as mine were difficult to get out of the pan.  They didn't look as pretty as the picture for the recipe, but they were really tasty.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These were very easy, cute, and super tasty! I love the ease of prep and endless variations that are possible. I mixed mine up a bit by using sausage and 4 oz green chiles instead of onion. This is a wonderful starter recipe. I can't wait to make these again with broccoli and cheddar or ham and swiss. I found grands split in two and rolled out were a perfect fix for regular muffin cups. The mixture made enough for 12 perfect quiches. This recipe is a keeper!

Very tasty and nice presentation.  I used Grands biscuits and cut them in half.  Next time I will try sausage because the bacon was a little soggy for my taste.

I just made these for a party that I was going to tomorrow and I am glad I did a trail run, when you put the biscuts in the pan you should seperate them into thin layers one can can probably make double I learned this the hard way. my biscuts baked over and the bread to filling ratio was way off. Also, I used honey butter flavor dough and it gave them a good salty/sweet taste.

As others suggested I used puff pastry instead of biscuit dough and sausage instead of bacon.  Everyone loved them! Will certainly make them again.

Great recipe! I cut grands (sliced off part of the edge so it fits in a cupcake pan) in half and added bacon and a serano pepper to the batter. Cooked for 25 minutes exactly. Perfect! Mmmmmm!

These were pretty good, but I think they were missing something..tasted a little bit bland. Also, I wasn't really a fan of the biscuit part..it just didn't seem to go with the rest of it. I will probably make this again but will definitely have to tweak it...maybe even leave out the dough. It is a good idea for a group breakfast/brunch or when company comes.

I used a regular pie crust recipe and cut it into 12 even pieces and used that for the crust.  I only used 1/2 of the cream cheese, and used a full cup of grated mozzarella instead.  My husband hates onions so I used chopped green chiles in the mix and he loved it.  I also used 4 eggs instead of 2 to stretch the mixture a bit since I made 12 instead of 10.  Delicious and easy for a quick breakfast on the go.  No more stops at McD's on the way to work when you have a few of these tucked into your bag.

One of these heavenly bites sent my friend home to her kitchen to rustle up her own batch to feed her brood.  These were to die for!  Easy, economical and great use for left overs if you can get a little creative with it...

My family LOVED this recipe (I'm actually making it again this morning by request)! I used Grands buttermilk biscuits (they're a bit bigger than the ones the recipe calls for, so I pulled them into halves before pressing them into the muffin tin.  I also follwed other reviewers suggestions and used cheddar cheese.  Absolutely DELICIOUS!

I used pastry shells but otherwise made the recipe as is. I found it tasty but bland. It needs some other flavors or seasonings. It is a good base though and something to build on with future recipes.

Very good- gave it 4 stars because I didn't follow the recipe as stated so I can't rate as stated.  Didn't have biscuits so used puff pastry as another reviewer did. Also used cheddar cheese, half the amount of cream cheese(I used low fat) and 3 eggs.  Result was excellent.   Think I might add mushrooms next time.  So many possibilities with this recipe. Thanks for the recipe.

These are so easy and fun - and taste great except that I am not crazy about commercial biscuit dough.  I am going to try next time making my own biscuits as the base and use the same topping.  Filling is yummy and just like little quiche fillings - looks like a lot more effort than it was, and puffs up perfectly!

This was great!  I only added salt & pepper to the mix & that was it. In addition, I just added the bacon to the egg mix instead of creating a layer. Made 40 of them for my sister's shower and only had 3 left...they were a hit.    Suggestion:  Make sure to use non stick muffin pans because the biscuits at the bottom tend to stick a little.

This is a good base for a mini quiche recipe.  I used it as reference for amounts and cooking times and adjusted everything else.  I made sausage, apple and chedder minis for a meeting of 60 people and they turned out great.

These were so easy to make & yummy to eat! I'm not a bacon person, so I used chopped up maple cured ham & smoked salmon. I combined the tarts with chopped baby spinach. I used the whipped chive cream cheese instead of plain cream cheese. Will definitely keep this recipe on hand since it wasn't too eggy nor too cheesy!

Very good.  Use half a biscuit and made 12.  Used 3 eggs and less cream cheese.  Used turkey bacon in some and canadian bacon in other. Turkey bacon was best.  Used cheddar cause that is what I had in the fridge.  Will make again.

These were good.  I didn't have any biscuits so I used the phyllo dough I had leftover.  I cut it into squares and layered it sheet by sheet, covering each later with butter until each muffin cup was filled and I had a cup shape.  I put the bacon in the bottom and poured the egg mixture over top.  Baked for the same amount of time.  Very good.  Will definitely try using the biscuits next time.

I love these with a few modifications I got from other reviews.  I added mushroom, used 1/2 a Grands biscuit, cooked @ 350 NOT 375.  I put the bacon in the bottom, then topped with the filling.  I love this recipe because you can customize the fillings to your own taste.  Reheats well.

I changed things a bit... I split each roll in 4 and put in  mini muffin pan. I also used veggie cream cheese instead of plain and omitted the onion. I didn't have any cheddar cheese so I used half parmesan half mozzarella. They turned out great!

What a quick and easy recipe.  I omitted the green onion and used maple sausage instead of bacon.  My kids ate them up, even the picky toddlers.  I will definitely make this again!

i have been making this recipe for the past 6 years and it is always a hit! its sooo easy to make and people are ALWAYS asking for the recipe. the cream cheese and onion combination lends such a wonderful taste...it is less eggy and more creamy than most quiche are. try this recipe - you won't be disappointed!

Excellent brunch recipe.  I, like others, doubled the bacon, used a little chopped white onion, added an extra egg, and mixed all together.  I used a package of 8 Grands biscuits which I pulled in half.  This easily made 16.  They will be great to send in lunches too.  Thanks for a great recipe.

These come out so good. I ended up with more mix than biscuits so I just made some without the bottoms. They are pretty rich so I served them as a side dish and put the leftovers in the fridge and served them for a couple of days. I also cut up some mushrooms and put in a couple. I would really recommend this recipe.

YUM!  I made this today for a happy crowd, and it didn't disappoint.  Following the lead from other folks' feedback, I used a lot more bacon (a whole package), added it to the egg mixture, and used a package of Grands flaky biscuits.  Easy, savory, tasty!

Have made this recipe several times. My boyfriend's really picky teenage son loves it and can eat one batch in the time it takes to make it. Scary but this is only a few of the things he will eat that I make...besides cookies and cakes...lol.

This was very good and easy.  I used 1/4 cup of Swiss and 1/4 cup of Cheddar.  Also, instead of messing with dough and muffin cups, I used pre-baked phyllo cups.  They're a little smaller and don't require as much baking... but it really simplified the process and they weren't at all bready.  They seemed to lack a little bit of flavor, but I think I just didn't feel each cup enough.  Will make again and I HIGHLY recommend the phyllo cups.

I had a hard time "stretching" the biscuit dough enough to cover the muffin cups, but other than that, this recipe was a hit!  I made them for office breakfast club and everyone loved them.  Nice and portable and not messy.  And it's easy to leave off the bacon and do some of them plain for vegetarians in the bunch.

These were great.  I made one with green chiles and montery jack and another with cheddar, green onion and bacon.  So easy to change the taste of these wonderful tarts.  I agreed with many other reviewers as I only used half of each biscuit to cut down on the bread. Thank you for the awesome recipe.

These were delicious.  Next time I would cook them about 18 minutes and use half of a biscuit, because they were a little bit too bready.  So good!

I made these on Mothers Day for a get-together with the in-laws...everybody loved them.  I used a mini muffin pan..peeled the Flaky Grands into thin layers and chopped ham instead of bacon.  Super easy..just a little time consuming peeling the biscuits apart.  Definitely will make again!

Everyone at our brunch loved these.  They were a good alternative to the sweet recipies everyone else brought.  I only thought they would be better with less cream cheese.

These were really YUMMY!! I added artichoke hearts,increased the bacon and added 1 extra egg. My husband who is not especially fond of quiche really, really liked them. This was exactly what I was searching for. The added cream cheese addition is the bomb and is what sets this apart from any other quiche recipe. Thanks!!!!!!!

I made these in a mini muffin tin so with the biscuits, I split them in half and even cut them smaller to fit in the bottom.  Because of using mini muffin tins, you have to keep your eye on them as you have to adjust time.  I used shredded sharp cheddar cheese instead of swiss.  There were none left and I made a double batch!

This was my first time making a dish like this, but it went very well. I used a whole biscuit for each quiche, but next time will not use as much. It was a bit dry because of that. The filling was delicious and I will definatly make this again. My husband wants me to try some hot peppers next time. I don't see a problem modifing this anyway you want. Good basic recipe. Thanks!

Mmmmmmmmmmm.  Make sure you press down the biscuit dough evenly and have a good amount at the top for the crust.  Mine weren't the prettiest, but they tasted great.

I made these for a casual brunch and they were devoured. I took others' suggestions and used only 1/2 of a flaky biscuit for each tart - it was the perfect amount. Just watch to make sure the bottoms don't get too brown. I also subbed regular onion for the green onion and added 3/4 box of frozen spinach (thawed and drained). Skipped the bacon in a few for the non-meat eaters. A definite keeper - thanks.

Didn't really like the flavour of this one. I found that there was too much bread and not enough egg mixture as the bread rose and the egg overflowed and burned in the oven.

I have made many dishes using recipes from this site, but this one is the first I've felt compelled to review. These tarts are amazing! One quick note: I was worried when I put the mixture in the biscuit dough tart because it kind of overflowed (so you couldn't see the biscuit anymore). It turned out to be no problem at all- the tart still sticks together just fine. Thank you, Donna, for making me look like a superstar cook at my work brunch!

Very good, but needed minor modifications.  I made a small batch as written and found it way too bready and not quite flavorful enough.  So, the next batch I used half a biscuit to line each muffin cup (just used regular buttermilk biscuits from can).  I also added extra green onion and extra cheese and sprinkled bacon and cheese on top before cooking rather than after.  MUCH better!  I made a double batch and ran out of bacon so I used bacon bits on a few and they were good too - although the real bacon was better - made mine extra crisp.  This is definitely something easy, different and good to serve with breakfast or brunch.

I made these for Christmas morning and everyone loved them. All day the family talked about them, even that night! I think you could use ham instead and they would be yummy too.

This recipe was delicious. The first time I made it exactly as the instructions suggest and it was amazing. The second time I substituted mozzerella cheese for swiss and I didn't like it at all. I would suggest you make it as the recipe describes, you won't be dissapointed.

I was looking for something with ingredients on hand for my weekly Bible Study.  This was very tasty and easy to make.  It does take a bit longer than 15 minutes, but an easy recipe.  I used the Grand biscuits peeled in half in regular muffin tins, replaced the green onion with yellow onion,  filled the cups the night before and baked in the morning.  I am sure you could interchange cheeses with what you have on hand, as well.

This was a great recipe.  I doubled it, added two extra eggs and used Grands biscuits and split them in half.  I baked in regular muffin tins.  I baked them ahead of time and then put them in a covered pyrex dish to keep them warm in the oven.

I have made this recipe numerous times and everyone that has eaten it raves about it. Instead of a whole biscut I half the biscuts and am able to make 12 instead of 10.  Then I can use up all the batter and just bake the extra biscuts. You then don't need 2 packages of biscuts and the tarts are less crust and more yummy filling.  I also use chedder instead of swiss since I always have chedder on hand.

My husband & I liked this recipe.  They were a bit dry so we sliced them down the middle and spread a little margarine on the muffin portion and they were much better!

Everybody, myself included, LOVED these when I made them for my book club last weekend - I will definately be making them again!  I do think I'll follow the advice of others and use the mini muffin pans next time, since the full muffin size was a bit big for an appetizer/buffet type thing.

I didn't follow this recipe, but I used the idea (of the muffin cups) with another recipe (cheddar quiche) and made my own pie crust and it turned out wonderful.  Thanks for the idea, I'll be serving this for next our next brunch with guest!

Yum yum yum!! I changed this recipe a little bit because I don't like meat. I ommited the bacon and added 1/2 package frozen spinach thawed and squeezed dry and 4 sauteed mushrooms. I made it for a Franch culture party...c'est parfait!!

Our camping group gobbled these down.  Working with the crescent rolls in the muffin tins was a bit awkward, but I simply need practice.  I used light cream cheese and don't think the recipe suffered for it.  Great brunch addition!

I only had a mexican cheese blend and a can of 8 jumbo flaky biscuits which I separated into 16 halves and rolled large and quite thin. My muffin tin holds 12 so I cooked the other four in some oil on the stove and sprinkled with a cinnamon sugar mixture to keep my other half quiet until these were ready.

Very good!  Took the recommendations of others and used 1/2 a Grands biscuit for each muffin.  Just mixed the crumbled bacon into the  egg mixture instead of dividing.  Used sharp cheddar instead of Swiss (out of laziness), and added salt and pepper.  

Doubled the recipe and it filled 24 muffin cups.   Thank you -- will definitely make again!

Everybody that I've made these for loves them!  I make the in a cupcake pan and use the flaky Pillsbury biscuits. I just pull each biscuit into 2 pieces ad line each place in the pan to the top (or almost to the top). I also increase the ingredients quite a bit. They come out like big delicious breakfast cupcakes.

These quiche cups are my go to for making large batches to seal and freeze for quick snacks or breakfast. I have begun to use croissant dough like another reviewer mentioned and have found I like the flavor much better. I have also used ham and other ingredients to make varieties of the cups. I also vary between large muffin cups as well as the regular sized cups for varied appetites in my home. Thank you for sharing this great recipe!!!

Solid recipe with lots of possibilities for mixing it up. I found many reviewer suggestions helpful. I did keep the ingredients as listed this time. The main change was I decided to bake in a pan and cut as bars instead of using muffin cup tarts. I cut Grands biscuits in half before pressing into greased 11X13 pan. I was surprised it did not require more eggs. It was very good. I could see how crossaint roll would also work well. Lots of potential with different meats and cheeses.

This is really good. Used pie dough which worked great. Will add some seasonings next time (savory and oregano). Saved to my favorites.

I made these for a potluck brunch and didn't bring any home. I used Grands Jr. Biscuits, peeling each one into three layers. I also used mini muffin tins instead of regular. These little tarts are creamy and eggy. Presentation is very nice. They were too doughy even peeling the biscuit into thirds.  Next time I make these, I'll probably use pie crust or crescent rolls or even phyllo tart shells. I'll also use more bacon, about 8 or  9 pieces.

I found the key to this recipe -- use CRESCENT rolls.  Cut a circle from each to fit into mini-muffin pans up the sides.  Then use hot spicy crumbled sausage,  paprika, and green onions. One tube of sausage worked fine, be sure and break into smaller pieces.  Worked great, hubby loved them, and froze well to heat up later (just microwave). Only cook 14-15 minutes though.

This was very tasty. I halved the Grands, reading other reviews, and rolled them flat, and still there was too much biscuity dough. Next time I will try crescent rolls. Other than that, they were awesome. They still tasted good and were a big hit at the brunch I took them to, I'd just like less doughiness. Can add a lot of different ingredients to vary this recipe. Will keep making!

I cut up grands into 6 pieces, pressed them into mini muffin tins to make this recipe. They were a bit bland...could have used some hot sauce and maybe chopped green chilies for more flavor.

These were tasteless! I added spices like another suggested. Powered mustard, seasoned salt and pepper! They still didn't have much flavor. I used grands flakey bisquits torn in half. They were very doughy!!

Alright, I've made these three times.  I've added ingredients, changed the recipe and done everything that I could to make these taste great.  The first time with real bacon was okay, but if you don't use real bacon and you try to use any substitute, it will turn out horrid.  Also, when I seasoned the egg mixture, it turned out worse as well.  It's good as a salt and pepper mix, but no additional seasonings.  The biscuit was way too doughy, and using half of the biscuit helped but not as much as I wanted.  Make your own biscuits and it turns out better.  I MAY yet make these again with my own biscuits and some jalapeno or bell pepper for flavor, but as it stands, they're not that great unfortunately.

I use crescent roll dough with these. I've made them many times, I mostly use my muffin pan, but have also made them in my mini tart pans. Kids seem to love these, as well as, adults. These can be frozen or refrigerated and  you just microwave them a little. Yummy!

A hit with my family. I didn't have Swiss cheese so I used mozzarella and I used Tenderflake mini pie crust because that's what I had on hand. I made them two days in a row. This is a wonderful discovery because I can add it to my new collection of school lunch menu for my high schoolers. Thank you!

For quicker, lower in fat version: use a pillsbury deep dish pie crust (thawed), 4 eggs instead of 2, low or non fat cream cheese and milk, and I used peperjack cheese to add more flavor.  It came out perfect and yummy! Will make it again for guests.

We love this recipe and it heats up well too!  We use a refrigerated pie crust cut into circles instead of the biscuits.  Makes them more smooth.

This is a very good no fail recipe. Next time I will add a bit of salt and pepper to the egg mixture.  Very good both of my picky kids loved this.  I think these would also be good with ham or sausage or any variety of cheese you may like in place of the swiss cheese.  Very good just as written also.

Loved them. I followed the directions exactly. With the dough I rolled each biscuit out with a rolling pin and some flour and then cut each biscuit in half. It took alittle longer to bake than the recipe says but they came out beautiful and delicious

These were a delicious treat for breakfast on Mother's Day. I substituted Sharp Cheddar for the Swiss cheese because I don't care for Swiss, but actually I think the Swiss would be a better balance to the cream cheese. I'll use that next time. But they were still delicious and a bit hit!

I could really taste the cream cheese in the mix, kind of a turn off. Maybe after sitting in the fridge for a day it will taste better.

This is really good, I did change a couple of things, I used a italian blend cheese, just because I don't like the swiss cheese and added a little more cheese to the recipe.  For the crust I use the recipe creation dough, but the dough was too thick.  Next time I'll use a pie crust in stead.  And I also use the mini muffin pans.  Overall the recipe was very good and I would make it again.

I changed this recipe up a bit. I used cheddar cheese instead of swiss.  I also used a pie crust.  I scrambed everything together, and poured it into the pie crust cut into mini-tartlets.  Perfect two bite size tartlets, and my family loved them. They also heated up great the next morning for breakfast!  Thanks for the recipe!

I've been making these for years with basically the same recipe - use only 1 egg though.   The trick is to use the "cheap" biscuits - the small ones from Pillsbury - and stretch them out like little pizza crusts, then put them in the pan.  Also, I add either Mrs. Dash or Everglades seasoning (whatever's on hand) to spice it up some. Makes the filling far more savory.  Never had a complaint, nor any left over!

This was very simple and very easy. I made it exactly as the recipes stated except I left out the onion because I knew my guests did not like onion and it was still very good. I made it the night before and just cooked it in the morning. Great recipe.

I just made this and it was great for a Sunday brunch.  I like to try new recipes for breakfast/brunch on Sundays and I will definitely be repeating this one. I did not have pre-made biscuits so I used a simple recipe to make these from scratch and omitted the green onions (my husband is not a fan).  These still came out great!  I love the creaminess the cream cheese gives this.  This is a must-make!

Not good at all.  I thought my kids would really like them but they had not flavor.  Too much biscuit.  Not worth the time or waste of ingredients. Sorry.

This was surprisingly good.  I thought it odd to have so much cheese and so few eggs in a quiche, but it worked!  I used crust from another recipe on the site and it worked fabulously!

yum. I messed up by using 3 eggs instead of 2, then I messed up and put all the bacon in the bottom!! Still tastes great.  Next time I will add couple slices more bacon and mix in. I used pie crust in the bottom instead of biscuits, just taste preference.

I made these for Christmas and the family loved 'em.  The only thing I would do differently next time is the crust.  Using biscuits was definitely easy, but there seemed to be a lot more dough than filling.  Still, it was a very delicious dish that I will certainly fix again in the future.

Delicious! Instead of individual portions or biscuits, used a pie shell. Filling was enough for a large pie shell and added veggies. It was a hit, will definitely make again.

These were awesome!!  This recipe has it all - great taste, easy preparation and beautiful presentation.  Even my picky husband liked this.  I loved how all the flavors tasted together.  I was bit worried that it would be too "eggy" but it wasn't at all.  I would love to try them in mini muffin tins next time for a brunch or something.

The only change I made to this recipe was to use real bacon bits.  It was heavenly!  The filling was delicous and I will definitely make them again.  I used the a 10-count of regular biscuits and there was enough filling to make 2 extras without the biscuit.  I can't wait to try it with different fillings.

These were wonderful. I made some exactly as the recipe was written. They turned out great, but I made the next set with another users advice. I sliced the Grand's in half. I enjoyed this crust better, just because  of the calories. Both ways are wonderful!

Just made these and they are WONDERFUL! I used the Grands and split them. Microwaved the bacon to crispy (used 6 slices) and used shredded sharp cheddar. I did place chunks on the bottom, then added the cheese, then the onion/cr cheese/egg/milk mixture. I made 16. Very tasty and thanks for the recipe! I will be freezing half of them for another time.

WOW!!!  These turned out fabulous!  They don't look so great coming out of the oven but the taste is unbelievable!  I didn't have bacon so I only used veggies.  I switched the cheese to a monterey/mozzarella blend.  I made them for a brunch so I cooked them to the shortest cooking time.  I then brought them over to my parents and finished cooking in a conventional oven.  Everyone loved them!  They are great for brunch or breakfast.  I will definetely make these again.  In fact, others asked for the recipe...

These turned out great - received many compliments! I doubled the recipe and made the following changes - used an entire package (15 thin strips) of Oscar Mayer pre-cooked bacon, used medium cheddar cheese instead of swiss, used 1/2 of a Grands biscuit for each crust (as recommended by many reviewers) and added a little freshly ground pepper to the mixture. These baked for 25 minutes and came out perfect - the biscuits were slightly brown on the bottom, but did not burn on the top (I filled them pretty full w/the egg batter). Will make again!

I took the advice & used a thin layer of Grands dough. These were gone in no time! My husband LOVED these!
I instead used cooked bacon bits to save time,and little shreds&bits of leftover Christmas eve ham. Definate holiday morning favorite.

Took to a women's retreat twice and both times got RAVE reviews!
I did use bacon in some and ground sausage in some... both were gobbled up.

Very Yummy!!! I took this to a teacher appreciation breakfast and they vanished. I used a 5oz pkg of canadian bacon since I didn't have bacon-chopped & sauteed in a little butter. I also used 3 eggs. The only cheese I had was the 4 cheese blend. Forgot the milk but it didn't seem to make any difference in the consistency. The biscuits browned very quickly so I covered with foil to complete baking. This recipe made 16 for me without the milk. A keeper!

This recipe was a hit at my New Year's Brunch. I took the advice of other reviewers and added an extra egg, used the Grands Flaky Biscuits divided in half, replaced the swiss cheese with Monterrey Jack/Colby cheese, and just mixed the bacon into the egg mixture. They were wonderful! Perfect for a party and everyone wanted the recipe!

I really liked these and so did all my guests!  It was the only dish all gone at the end of brunch.  I used 1/4 cup cheddar and 1/4 Monterey jack instead of Swiss, and regular onion instead of green onion.  Like the other reviewers suggested, I used 8 Pillsbury Grands.  I was able to get 12 tarts out of the recipe.

Oh this recipe is easy and quite tasty!  I made these for my boyfriend's office meeting and had to make them today because I didn't get to taste one and he came home with rav reviews.  I used Morningstar's Faux Bacon (we don't eat meat), used Monterey Jack cheese and added red pepper flakes and a little garlic powder.  Plus used the advice and split Grand Bisquits in half. I think next time I will try to phyllo cups for crunchy and flakiness.  Yummo!!!

YUM!!!!! These were very easy to make and so delicious! I used an extra egg and cheddar cheese instead of swiss.  You could put almost any favorite ingredient in these and suit it to your own taste.  Definitely a keeper recipe.

I brought these to work and received rave reviews. You can do all the prep the night before, keep it all covered in the fridge, and then combine and bake in the morning. Delish!

Very good taste, but the biscuit crust cooked much faster than the quiche itself and ended up very brown and crisp not flaky and soft.  Probably wouldn't make again.

easy and tasty. I did use more bacon than recipe calls for and next time I will split the bisquits as suggested by others. Served at brunch along with Grandma Johnson's Scones, Devonshire Cream (both on this site), fresh fruit, coffee and mimosas.

Very easy to make - hardly any time at all.  My 8 year old helped and loved them - I think she ate 3!  I think I overecooked mine a bit as they were a little dry but still really good!  I also split the flakey biscuits in  half and was able to make 12.  I think if I had used the whole biscuit - it would have been too much dough.

These were fairly good.  A little different, a little greasy (part of that's because I used cheddar), but still good.  As others have said, don't use Grands biscuits.  I use more bacon and cheddar instead of swiss.  Might try colby to cut back a little on the grease factor.  Good recipe.

Thanks Donna for this great recipe idea.  Much better than the mini quiches people buy and serve from the frozen section of mega marts.  Next time I'm going to make them with breakfast sausage and I bet they'll be super yummy.

MMM!  These were great!  I took the advice from others and only used half a muffin for each crust.  I also noticed that some people said they had used the regular bisquits, while the recipe calls for the flaky kind.  I think that might make a difference because it was great with the flaky bisquits.  Definitely on the rich side so I could only really handle one, but it was delicious!

Love this!  I used a deep dish pie crust and it is perfect.  I tried the biscuit thing, but I didnt like it as much as the pie crust.  The filling is to die for.

This recipe was great. I am not a big egg person, but this didn't have that strong taste. The cream cheese was not too overwhelming, either...if you didn't know what was in it, you'd have no idea. No changes were made...just a reminder to buy the smaller size biscuits instead of the "grand" sized ones. Also, I liked the ones that actually got a little brown on top better than the lighter ones.

I used mini muffin pan.  The first time I made it I did not adjust the cooking time so they were dry.  This time I only cooked them 18 minutes, they were perfect!  I acidentally bought Grands golden corn biscuits, it added a diffent twist.  Everyone loved them. Filling is great if it is not overcooked!

these were amazing!  my boyfriend loved them and they were all gone the same day.  i thought that the biscuit dough could have been halved because they came out extremely doughy, but he thought it added something different.  so i might try both variations.  either way, a great easy brunch idea.

Very good and easy to make. I made these for a play group brunch and everyone loved them, including the kids. I didn't want to cook bacon, so I bought real bacon bits. They worked just fine. I will make this again.
