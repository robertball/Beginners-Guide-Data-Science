Quite delicious.  I substituted canned San Marcos brand chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (sliced) for the ground pepper. It gave a nicely complex flavor. Would suggest serving it with flour tortillas as a taco. We didn't use the cheese, didn't miss it. Served with a black bean, corn, rice, & pineapple salad topped in tomatillo salsa.

I easily did this in a slow cooker! Browned the chicken on the stovetop as instructed . Mixed the soup,vinegar, water, brown sugar and chipotle in the cooker. Put the bell pepper in, then the browned chicken and finally topped with the onions. Covered on high until tender- not sure how long that was. When the onions started to cook down , I stirred everything to combine in the liquid. I did however use 2 Tablespoons  canned diced chipotle instead of dry

I made a couple minor changes to this...I used homemade canned tomato sauce and some a pinch of dried cayenne since that's what I had on hand.  The first day my husband ate it as a sandwich and liked it, but day two over rice was even better.  I will definitely be adding this to our rotation!
