Hazelnuts were so difficult to find in store; for that and a couple other reasons I wouldn't recommend this recipe to novice cooks like me. The sauce is particular too, it burned within a couple seconds being overcooked. However, it is a quick and cheap recipe and tastes pretty good for how fast it is to make.

First off, very novice cook.  No idea how big half bunch of leaves is, so I cut the stems off of a .75 oz Publix bought packet and used half the packet.  Next time, the whole packet.  Took the leaves out before putting onto the chicken.  Also, did not use any hazelnuts, don't like them, but next time I will use walnuts.  No other changes.  My wife loved the meal, for me, it was fine, but food always tastes better when someone else makes it.
