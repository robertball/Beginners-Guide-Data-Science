This soup is amazing!!! I used Aloha Bell Peppers because I thought they would add a little extra color. The only addition that I would make for next time is making rice. Just a small scoop of white rice in the bottom of the bowl would just add a little bit more to the soup. Thank you for a fantastic recipe and a super easy gumbo!
