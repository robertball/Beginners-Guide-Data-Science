I've been wanting to make this for awhile now and I finally got my hands on some affordable fresh shiitake mushrooms. It didn't disappoint and I really liked the green olives in it. I did stumble on an editing error while in the middle of making this. The last step (step 3) calls for ketchup but ketchup was not in the ingredient list. 1 Tablespoon is what I used and that was perfect for but I recommend 2 Tablespoons if you don't like extra spicy. This is a great recipe and one I will make again.
