Delicious! Perfect consistency for piccata sauce over angel hair! I didn't have any artichokes but I'm sure it will be delicious with those thrown in too!

Pretty Good. Needs a little more zip but I always try to follow a recipe the first time around. Chopping the capers may have taken away from their tartness... which can be a good or bad thing depending on your tastes! PERFECT consistency. I made again with no artichokes and it was delicious! From now on I will probably skip them since i rarely have them on hand!

Although this recipe has a nice flavor and saves well for future use. it lacks the richness of a true picatta. I will use this in a pinch but probably not for guests.

I served it over halibut and chicken. Went well with both. The family rated it differently so I gave it the average rating. It was a thicker sauce than I would have preferred. Next time I will thin it with a little white wine. I felt that wine flavour was missed but still really enjoyed this recipe! thanks Mary Elizabeth

I had no chicken broth and had to sub wine for this sauce and it didn't say what kind of artichoke hearts to use so I used Trader Joe's marinated hearts. I also added another little dab of butter to it when it was finished. I put this over chicken that I saut√©ed with butter and olive oil seasoned with Papa's Seasoning from this site and a little Tajin. We practically inhaled this dish! Very yummy and very easy too. Yum!

I didn't have any cornstarch so I used the butter and made a roux to start with. Then added the other ingredients and stirred to desired thickness. Served tossed with pasta and veges. Quite nice.

Used canned and drained artichokes to speed things up on a weeknight. Even w/fresh this is a good quick sauce for veal scallops. Good with tuna too! Haven't made it with chicken yet.

Pretty good, but definitely not piccata, which should have neither artichokes nor garlic

Great recipe! I used the juice from a whole lemon didn't chop the capers and added about an extra 1/2 teaspoon of capers. (I like a little extra zing in a picata.) Also I didn't have any artichoke hearts so I used hearts of palm instead. I would 100% make this again.

I made this sauce for a whole tray of chicken. It was outstanding. It reheated well too.
