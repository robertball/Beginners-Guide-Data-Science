The meat was so tender and you did not taste wild in the stew at all.  The only thing I'm going to do different next time will be add 1/2 of the onions in the beginning then add the carrots 5 minutes before the potatoes and the rest of the onions.  Great stew.

This one's a keeper and a good base recipe for experimentation. We reduced the onion to 1/2 and added a bit of cumin, oregano, and 3-4 stalks of celery.

No gamey taste! Instead of using tarragon, I used cinnamon and parsley and severs it on top if some yummy roasted garlic and olive oil couscous!

Made this last night and it was delicious! I took some others advice and added a couple potatoes and carrots and added some of my own spices. Ended up with enough food for 6 people which was great.
