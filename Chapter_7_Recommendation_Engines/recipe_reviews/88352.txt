The BEST crab cakes! I rolled the crabcakes lightly in panko bread crumbs before frying which added a nice crunch.

I LOVE this recipe.  I've used it at least a dozen times.  I can never find the Old chesapeke seasonings, so I just use salt, pepper, dried mustard, red pepper, onion powder, and some parsley flakes.  I also never buy real crab.  I just use the imitation stuff and break it up in the food processor.  I also use townhouse crackers instead of saltines for a buttery taste.  A good tip for parties is to make them really tiny and serve them with tartar sauce.  Bite sized and crispy!

The ingredients, and proportions of them, are spot on accurate for classic, traditional crab cakes...you want good quality crab meat and lots of it, and just enough egg, crumbs and mayo to bind it. The Old Bay too, is the typical seasoning. Use a light hand and mix gently--you want nice, big chunks of crab, not mush balls!  I have made crab cakes often and coat them in Japanese Panko bread crumbs, and was curious to try these as they were not coated in anything before frying. After doing it this way, I have to say I much prefer them coated with either the panko bread crumbs or even just flour before frying. Refrigerating them for a good hour or so before frying really helps them to keep their shape while cooking. All and all, this is a good, basic recipe, but really much better lightly dredged in flour or panko crumbs. I accompanied these with lemon wedges and "Remoulade Sauce a la New Orleans," also from this site.

This recipe is awesome! It is the first time I have had crabcakes and did not need any dipping sauce with it. I did make a couple of modifications: I used 12 ozs. of imitation crab instead of real crab, bread crumbs instead of cracker and I used 1 package of Old Bay Crab Cake seasoning mix. Even my 15 year old daughter loved them!! I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could!

I served this last night with a cilantro-lime sauce and everyone loved it!  My husband mentioned that these were made just the way he liked them...pretty much all crab meat!  Very easy to prepare and held their shape well even when cooking.

I've tried so many times to find a good crab cake recipe and I found it! These crb cakes melt in your mouth and don't fall apart as bad like other recipes I've tried. I added green peppers for more flavor. I used red onions instead of green. My husband couldn't stop talking about how good they were.

My rating did not match my husband and son at all.  They loved.  If it was up to me, I would not make again, but for them, I will.  I added a little more Old Bay and kept everything else as written but I did not think there was a lot of flavor.  My husband and son loved the fact that they had so much crab in them and not as much breading.  Oh well....will make again for them.  Thanks

These were pretty good, a little bland though. Next time I will try to tweak this recipe a bit, to give it a little more spice.

I thought these were just ok. It's very possible that I just messed something up, but mine didn't hold together very well when I fried them. They were a little bland, but good with some sauce on them. My boyfriend liked them, but next time I'll try a different recipe.

My family and I weren't that impressed with this recipe.  I used canned crab, so maybe that was part of the problem.  It was a little salty and too moist.  I had trouble keeping the cakes together, even though I drained the crab meat.  I think they could have used a little more seasoning, also, as they were somewhat bland.

I loved these--not too much filler, they held together well.  The key is pressing them together to get rid of as much air as possible before frying them.  I had no trouble at all keeping them together.  They were crunchy, even without adding panko.  Following the recipe and preheating the oil for 10 mins. made the difference! I served these with Mustard Cream Sauce also from this site, and they were fantastic.

OMG!!! These were so wonderful, my FI had never had crab cakes before, I trick him though, I also cooked salmon patties for him. I slipped in one of my crab cakes and he took a bite and said wow this is good, but what is it. I said "something you said you didn't like" :). He couldn't believe it and neither could I when I watched him eat it all.

This is our favorite crab cake recipe. It has more meat/less fillers. I do use more old bay seasoning and 2 whole green onions. I also 2 tsp of milk as 4 makes the crab cakes crumble easier. I also use veg oil instead as I don't care for the olive oil taste with these.

I normally use a adapted recipe from this site (My Crab Cakes by Rod Mowery), but we were at the beach this past week and needed a simpler recipe with fewer ingredients so we tried this one.  The results were excellent - a tender meaty crab cake with a nice crispy crust.  After reading the suggestions of others, I doubled the hot sauce and Old Bay seasoning in the recipe, chilled the crab cakes for several hours before cooking, and patted them with panko crumbs before frying.  This was a great beach recipe (good flavor, simple prep, few ingredients) and one that I'll definitely be using again!

I was nervous about making crab cakes because I'd heard it was difficult, but these were extremely easy!  They stuck together well and looked authentic.  I used canned lump crab meat and got great results.  I also added a tiny bit of powdered "True Lemon" for a slight kick.  On the side, for dipping, I offered both hot sauce and horseradish sauce.  Both tasted great with the crabcakes.

Excellent!  I used leftover crab from last night's dinner, doubled the seasonings and green onion and used spicy cocktail sauce in place of the hot sauce. Coated with panko bread crumbs before frying and made an accompanying sweet sauce out of mayo, dijon mustard and a little peach preserves. OH was this ever yummy, thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

This recipe makes the perfect crab cakes!  I made it as directed.  The next time I made them I used butter crackers (Ritz) instead of saltines and I liked the flavor even more.  Thank you for this fabulous recipe!

Base Recipe.  Agree with other reviews that this is a base crab cake recipe.  Add extra Old Bay, hot sauce and dijon mustard to taste.

Okay, I made "chicken" cakes instead of crab cakes using 1 can of tyson's chicken in place of the crab. I kept all other measurments the same. I omited the cayanne and the hot sauce as I made it for my toddlers. I would be enough for 2 adults for a light dinner. Recipe came out great. I enjoyed it.

These were my first attempt at crab cakes, and I was pleased with the recipe.  I did as several previous reviewers suggested and used Ritz crackers instead of saltines, and coated the cakes in panko bread crumbs before frying.  The panko bread crumb coating really added crunch and flavor, I couldn't imagine these without it!  Since we're on a budget, I used imitation crab (made out of fish) broken into lumps; I'm sure it's better with the real thing, but we wanted to try these without breaking the bank.  I wasn't sure they would hold together at first and had to place them in the oil very gently, but they firmed up very well as they fried, and were easy to flip without breaking.  I served them with the "Remoulade Sauce a la New Orleans" from this site, as suggested and it complemented them perfectly!

WOW! These crab cakes are perfect! This was my 1st time making these and boy was my man impressed!They were so easy to make! I, as others recommended used extra Old Bay seasoning, hot sauce & green onions.  The best tip had to be adding panko bread crumbs.  I made the crab cakes and put them in the fridge for a few hours then rolled them in the panko crumbs.  Once they were done they were nice and crispy on the outside. They were just so good I’m making the again tonight! Thank You!!!

This recipe came out perfect!  I did make some substitutions to keep the Weight Watchers point value down.  I used egg beaters for eggs, used 1 TBS Fat Free Mayo + 1 TBS dijon mustard for 2 TBS mayo, used 4 tsp Silk soy milk for 4 tsp milk, and used 10 onion flavored melba toast for 10 saltine crackers.  I also doubled spices and green onions for extra flavor and used 1 tsp Old bay.  I will definitely make this again.  For those on Weight Watchers using Flex Points, the modified recipe came to 26 total points; with each crab cake (not serving) being 3.25 points each.  It was a nice change from the usual chicken meals we eat.  Thank you for this recipe!!

This is a good starter recipe for adding other ingredients that suit your taste. I ended up using more mayo to hold everything together and more like 1 tsp. of Old Bay seasoning. I also  added more green onions, and in the future I'll add more crunchy green veggies like chopped celery or green bell pepper. I used breadcrumbs instead of crushed saltines (panko would also be good), and I coated each crab cake in breadcrumbs before I fried it. With some homemade tartar sauce and lemon juice, these were excellent. Make sure not to break up all the lumps in the crabmeat, or the texture will be all wrong.

Easy.  pretty tasty.  After reading other reviews, I thought I'd double the spices.  It worked well (although we like spice, so when we do this again, we'll be adding even more).

These were a hit with my two kids and husband!  They liked the concentrated crab flavor without tons of filler.  I used Ritz crackers instead of saltines and coated them in panko crumbs before frying and they turned out golden brown and tasty!  My mix was a little runny but I think it was because my crab wasn't drained quite enough.  Next time, I will make sure the crab is thouroughly drained and it will be easier to cook.  But overall, these crab cakes were better than most I've had before.

Excellent base recipe. I took several suggestions and added to them: I used day old sour dough french bread crumbs (No crusts just center, not prepackaged bread crumbs) (I had no crackers), increased Old Bay's x3, used a couple of good squirts of Sriracha (hot sauce) added 2 TBS chopped parsely for more color. Refrigerated 2 hrs. Then dredged well in Panko, the Japanese bread crumbs before frying.   Had great reviews from all.

Wonderful. I used the panko bread crumbs on the cakes after I let them chill in the freezer. I also used two packages of Chicken of the Sea ready-to-serve crab which I had drained. Very tasty and made four cakes. My husband and I were glad that our kids weren't eating with us so we could enjoy double portions.

The recipe was awsome. I am a former flight attendant and have had a lot of crab cakes in my travels. This taste just like I was in Nantucket eating at one of those fancy resturants. Everyone loved it even my 2 year old. I didn't have old bay so just used seasoning salt.

I make excellent crab cakes (she says humbly) but liked the look of these. They were sinfully easy compared to mine and were absolutely to die for. I didn't change a thing except I used canned white crab meat. I can't wait to try it with fresh crab meat!

I added a few seasonings that I like.  I'm from Louisiana and we're not used to bland food here, and we do love our crabcakes!  We go crabbing ourselves so we always have fresh (Yum!) crabmeat.  Anyway, great recipe, just remember to fry on low heat so they don't burn :)

This is a great base recipe, but as other reviews mention, in needs more spice.  Here's what I did differently, and they were to die for:  I added a splash of Worcestershire sauce, 2 minced cloves of garlic, sprinkle of salt and pepper, an entire tsp. Old Bay seasoning, 1/2 tsp. hot sauce, and 1 tbs. dijon mustard to the egg mixture.   To save a few bucks, I used two 4 oz. cans of lump crab and two 4 oz. cans regular white crab meat.  I omitted the milk completely, and crushed up 10 town house crackers into the crab.  I stored the caked on parchment paper on a baking sheet 4-5 hrs. before frying and dredged in panko crumbs right before they hit the skillet.  I also used the red pepper sauce in another allrecipes.com crabcake recipe to serve.  DIVINE!!!

Found this packed in w/ my Christmas decorations & remembered I made it last year...must have forgotten to review it in the hustle of the season. I do remember, however, that we were disappointed in the recipe...they were pretty blah. The "perfect" crab cake recipe still eludes me. *sigh*

I make this over and over again,and I bake them in the oven till done, nice and brown.  After a while, making crab cakes is like making meatloaf. Learn the basics and add whatever else you want. Grated onion when no green onions.

Husband loved them, I thought they were an awful lot of work for very little flavor.  I did use the suggestion for covering in panko bread crumbs and that really do a good job to boost the crunchy crust.  Don't think I will be making these again although I will try crab cake recipes from this site.

As noted by many others, this is a great starter recipe for truly excellent crab cakes. Changes that I made include:

1) 2:1 Dijon mustard:mayonase, with a slight increase in total quantity
2) Italian bread crumbs rather than crackers, a bit less than called for in the original recipe
3) Double or more) the Old Bay® or equivalent and use d'Jardins "Blazin' Saddles®" habanero sauce (about 1/2+ tsp)
4) 1-2 minced garlic cloves, first sauteed in butter (living well versus living long?)
5) Increase the amount of green onion by about 50%
6) Dredge in Panko before frying

So far, rave reviews... Thank you Pam Anderson!

We tweaked this a bit...but the ingredient lineup is solid.  First of all, and most importantly, we used fresh crab we had caught off Anacortes in Puget Sound...admittedly a huge luxury.  Secondly, we reduced the quantities of crackers and breadcrumbs, the idea being that they're not RitzCrackerCakes, they're Crab cakes...so the more crab the better...little tobasco, used fresh garlic instead of powder.  The crackers we crushed about 10 and mixed them in there, then just dredged the cakes in bread crumbs so the outside was nice and crispy.  This is a great, forgiving recipe...so go crazy- you can't go too far wrong, right?

I am not a huge crab cake fan but this recipe was simple enough to get me to try my luck.  These came out great but as usual I had to give the formula a little twist - I used half mayo and half dejon mustard and added a small sazon (cilantro) seasoning packet to the egg mixture.

These were awesome! I doubled the old bay though and used Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of crackers.

These are wonderful!  The only thing I did different was add a very light coating of a combination of italian bread crumbs and panko bread crumbs because I like a little bit of crunchy coating.
