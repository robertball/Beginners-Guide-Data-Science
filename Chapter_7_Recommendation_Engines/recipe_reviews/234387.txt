I made blackberry jam from this site to use in place of the blackberry preserves in this recipe. The bbq sauce was absolutely delicious on a roasted chicken. The only thing I would suggest is to add the bourbon a little at a time because I only used 3 teas. Better to adjust like that than to add too much and it overpowers you. Some may like more of a bite from it though and add the full amount. Also I was hesitant to add all of the garlic powder, but in the end was a great addition. Again add in a smaller amount at first and test. I added a little sugar to mine. That could have been due to the jam and preserve switch.  Had a bit of a gourmet flavor when all was done. Thanks for the great recipe. I'm not sure what the introduction means when it says brown sugar and cayenne in it when there isn't any in the recipe though.

Made this to go with smoked beef spare ribs. Substituted raspberry balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar and simmered the sauce for 20 minutes to bring the flavors together. Fantastic!!!! Will make again for smoked wings!

This was such a nice change from traditional BBQ sauces. Husband slow smoked ribs and asked me to find a new sauce. I found this and he used it as the mop. It was so yummy, I will definitely make it again (maybe add a little more bourbon!)
