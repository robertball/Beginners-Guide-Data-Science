I tried this and I really liked the flavors.  Go crazy if you need more.  This was a quicker meal because of the Instant Pot.  Cooking time could be a little longer in my opinion, some of the celery was not cooked as thoroughly as I expected, but I might have cut mine a little bigger than the author of the recipe.  One big thing that the recipe doesn't say is when to add the meat back in.  I just added it back as soon as I was going to pressure cook it.  The recipe is great as is.  I added some shrimp at the very end because I love shrimp in gumbo.

Turned out great. Note: the instructions say to separate the meat, cook the veggies and never instruct on when to put the meat back. I made it up, but it was a moment of confusion there. consider editing it.

I will rate it after I make it... but while reading instructions you do not specify when to put the meat back in. I’m assuming  that you will add the meat back in prior to actually pressure cooking but we all know what it’s says about those who assume .... so perhaps you can make a little notation on the recipe instructions to reintroduce meat. Looking forward to trying this... fingers crossed!!

I messed up part of it, left out the Okra and it still turned out OUTSTANDING! This will get made again and again.
