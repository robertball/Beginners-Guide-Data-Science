These taste and smell great!  The color is a little weird, but you forget about that when you bite into it!  YUMMY!

To drizzle, I use a heaping 1 tsp. of shortening and then microwave.  I use a spoon to drizzle the mixture on the cookies.  Increasing the shortening slightly is the key to no clumping.

These were pretty easy to make, and smelled great in the oven...My hubby LOVED them, though he was the only one...It just seems to be lacking something to counter all of the cinnamon...If you REALLY like cinnamon, though, you will probably like this recipe!

I thought these cookies had a really good taste, but they were rather time consuming to make. To help the person that had trouble with the drizzle clumping, I suggest you put the icing in a ziploc bag and cut a small cut in the corner of the bottom of bAg and squeeze out drizzle that way.

These cookies were really good however I couldn't get the drizzle to actually "drizzle" it just fell in clumps so I left it off the rest of the cookies.

Suggest microwaving morsels at a lower power to prevent chips from burning. Cookies tend to spread quite a bit so need lots of space on the cookie sheet. Difficult to tell when "done". A delicious, crisp cookie. Next time will grind pecans to a finer texture.

Good cookie, but a little time consuming to make.  For a change of pace, I drizzled 1/2 of the cookies with the melted cinnamon chips and the other 1/2 with melted milk chocoate chips.  Definitely a good Christmas cookie.
