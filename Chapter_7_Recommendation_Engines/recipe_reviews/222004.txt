This was a HUGE hit with my kids and dinner guest and I'll definitely make it again.  It needed some additional salt & pepper but had a great texture as well as flavor.  I made my own alfredo sauce and accidentally used the whole can of pumpkin (actually a great mistake) which made it extra creamy.  This is an easy recipe to prepare but has such an elegant appearance.  What a great recipe to get the kids to eat their vegetables!

This recipe was very delicious. I would definitely recommend making your own alfredo sauce because the taste of the jarred sauce ruins the dish. I did not have any yellow squash so I used 2 zuchini's instead. Even my 2yr old liked this dish. Thank you for the recipe.

Clever idea to mix pumpkin with Alfredo. I used whole wheat fettuccine. If you don't make your own Alfredo sauce, I recommend you buy the fresh refridgerated type. It's more expensive than the jar kind, but the jar stuff is really horrible. Will definately
 make this again.

Omitted eggplant and mushrooms because I didn't have them on hand; used my home-grown tomatoes diced up instead of canned; Awesome!!!

Wow!!!  Had red pepper on hand -- and just regular old spaghetti -- but otherwise didn't change a thing.  I thought the recipe seemed strange -- but we like butternut squash ravioli, so we gave it a chance.  Glad that we did -- this is definitely a keeper.

This was so good. I even messed up and accidentally mixed the pumpkin in before mixing it with the alfredo sauce like the directions said to do and it still came out really delicious. The only thing is, I wouldn't call this 6 servings. It made way more than that. I'd say it was more like 12-15 servings.

This was a good way, and slightly different way, to use up our garden crops!  We used jarred alfredo for ease and it was still good.  We made half the recipe and it was plenty for 3 of us plus one leftover.

This was good but I made a number of changes: 1) made a vegan 'alfredo' sauce instead of using a jar of alfredo; 2) sliced the eggplant and squash into rounds and browned them evenly in a pan; 4) sauteed the onions, green pepper, and spices and then added diced tomatoes and simmered; 5) layered as follows in the pan: 1/2 pasta mixed with pumpkin alfredo, 1/2 vegetable rounds, 1/2, tomato sauce, repeat, mozzarella.

This was excellent!  Hubby and 9-year old both loved it!  I did use homemade pasta and homemade alfredo sauce.  We have fallen in love with the "Alfredo Sauce" Recipe on here that uses egg yolks.  Great way to have ratatouille with  picky eaters!

You should have seen the face my BF made when I had him read this recipe  and after I made it ... He made me promise to make it again and again.  Only sub I made was to use spaghetti squash instead of pasta and I accidently stirred in the whole can of pumpkin because I wasn't paying attention, but I would totally do it again.  Love this!

Lots of chopping, but worth it.  Hard to find yellow squash in the winter, so I substituted diced butternut squash which increased the cooking time slightly.  We like some spice, so I added some crushed red pepper as well.  I used Classico's Asiago Romano Alfredo sauce and thought it was great.  Completed the dinner with a salad (Raspberry Vinaigrette Dressing) and bread (Michael's Foccacia Bread) and one very happy husband!

This dish was very hearty! It was a bit bland though. I would add more seasoning somewhere. I used fresh pumpkin and fresh mozzarella. I couldn't taste the pumpkin at all. Perhaps more?
