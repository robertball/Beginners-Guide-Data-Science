This was wonderful. My chicken breasts were not very thick so instead of stuffing them, I pounded the breasts flat, spread the filling on and rolled them up. Toothpicks held them together just fine while I browned them. I think next time I make this, I am going to just make a big pan of the stuffing and top it with the browned chicken breasts. I loved this stuffing and wanted more then the breasts held. I seasoned the stuffing with a little poultry seasoning.. delish. I also left out the cheese because I forgot to buy some. I'll be making this often.

I tried this last nite - but cut ingredients in half ~ also using 4 chicken breasts. (Fits WeightWatchers requirements for 8 points!) It was awesome. I can't believe how moist they were. Added another point for browning breasts in oil after coating them with flour (how else were you supposed to brown them?) You need to finely chop veggies. I used the 4 oz. individually packaged breasts. Use them partially frozen for easier slitting. So, so good:)

Fast forward to summertime: Made them again last night. Breasts were thawed already so when I found that I couldn't cut a pocket in them, I layered the bottom of the dish with the filling, layed the browned breasts on top, covered and baked for 30 mins!  Easy, delicious!

Fantastic recipe overall! I didn't use the cheese because I thought it might overpower the dish. To keep the chicken moist, I added some olive oil to the bottom of the baking pan and covered it in aluminum foil, which worked wonderfully. Stuffing the chicken was a bit difficult, but certainly worthwhile because it tasted great. I also put the extra stuffing on the side.

Very good. Made a few small changes: 1)used red bell pepper instead of green 2) used chedder/jack cheese mix 3) Brushed each breast w/oilve oil and dredged in whole wheat italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of flour.

I used left over spagetti squash instead of the acorn squash and the result was fabulous.
It was elegant enough to serve to guest, yet easy enough to make for a family dinner.
It tasted great!!  We will definitely have this at our house again.

this recipe was wonderful. I'd recommend using seam pins to hold the breasts closed  while browning but other than that it was easy and totally yummmy!

My husband and I love this dish!  It's easy to make, but has a gourmet taste. I used zucchini, since the acorn squash was too hard to chop!

I have made this recipe twice and it's been wonderful both times.  I used zucchinni and yellow squash instead of carrots and celery.  Also, changing the cheese really changes the taste.  I've used Montery Jack/Cheddar mix.  Awesome!

This is very tasty.  Instead of stuffing the chicken breast, I put the stuffing on the bottom of a casserole dish and the chicken on top.  Baked uncovered.  I also did not use cheddar cheese.  I sprinkled feta on after cooking.  Terrific!

This was delicious!  My husband was so disappointed that we didn't have any leftovers for him to take to work for lunch the next day.

Following the suggestion of another poster, I tenderized the chicken breasts and rolled the filling up inside instead of the stuffing method in the recipe.  Because of the way they were rolled, I couldn't brown them.  They were fine, but next time I might brown the chicken before rolling.  I used spaghetti squash because that's what I had on hand, and I placed the rest of the filling on top.  Definitely a keeper!

It was very time consuming and difficult to make; and I ended up with a kitchen covered in flour.
Tip for this recipe:  Brown the chicken prior to cutting and stuffing.

Wonderful recipe idea!  I made some substitutions for some of the ingredients (diced zuchini and yellow squash instead of acorn squash and 1/2 a yellow and 1/2 a red pepper rather than a green pepper).  I also didn't use flour to coat.  I dipped the chicken in beaten egg and then seasoned breadcrumbs.  As others did, I used a toothpick to hold everything together.  I didn't pan sear the chicken... I baked them for 40 minutes.  They came out sooooooo yummy!

This was soooo delicious!!  It tasted like I had been slaving all day on it, when in fact I was just trying to use up some things out of my frig!!  I used all the ingredients and made as written, only I scaled back to one breast.  Oh, I did cut it then pound it out, so I guess I did that different.  I also fried it in a cast iron so I transferred it straight from the stove to the oven.  One pot dish.  Gotta love that too!  I will be making this one again very soon.  Thank you for sharing!

This is one of the best chicken dishes I have made.  My husband and kids loved it.  This will be a regular at our table.  My only suggestion is to season the flour.  I used my own house seasoning (varying amounts of garlic powder, onion powder, fresh black pepper, salt, and some herbs)

This dish was excellent.  I did make a slight change and added a very thin slice of ham before stuffing the veggies on it.  Also, I used shredded butternut squash instead of diced.  I also tied kitchen string around each roll before browning and it kept the stuffing inside nicely.  Thanks for the recipe, a keeper......

My picky 2 year old ate the entire chicken breast! I can not believe how awesome this recipe is ...It's wonderful just as written. Although, I added mushrooms; and that was just because I needed to get rid of 'em.  Thanks Le Ann for a great recipe!

This recipe was good. The stuffing is great, but the chicken is lacking in flavor. My chicken breasts were thick so I doubled the amount of squash, and cheese in the stuffing. Also, next time instead of adding flour to the breasts, I am going to coat them with a bit of olive oil and minced garlic and brown them that way. There's just no flavor in the chicken otherwise. It's a great starter recipe to play with, for sure!

This is an excellent recipe only I made a few changes.  I had 1/2 cup cooked squash so I used that and added a cup of cubed bread.  Also I did not brown the chicken (in my mind a waste of time) I just put it in the pan and added once can of cream of chicken soup on top to make a "gravy".  My guests LOVED it and asked for the recipe.

This was amazing! My family LOVED it. I did make a few adjustments:
1. Traded out the cheddar cheese for pepper jack.
2. Used summer squash as they are in season and tasting fabulous.
3. Pounded the breasts flat and rolled the stuffing inside.
4. Used baking mix (Bisquick) instead of flour. 
I am planning on making the stuffing as a side to go with grilled chicken as well.

this was a big hit at my house.The only thing I did different was more of the stuffing.I made extra and placed around the chicken in my pan.My 4 yr old does not like onions bell pepper or celery but he at all of his.I think it being cut up so fine helped in that area.My MIL liked it too and she is picky.Will make again for sure but I think just to save a little extra work I will just layer the chicken and stuffing instead of actually stuffing the chicken next time.With a 4 yr old and a 5mth old it seemed I was constantly having to stop and wash my hands to do for them while I was in the messy stuffing the chicken stage

The stuffing was excellent but the chicken itself a bit bland.  I am going to try this again but use another reviewer's advice about olive oil and Italian Breadcrumbs.

This was so great!  As with others, I used what I had (didn't use celery or green peppers and added garlic).  I also used Italian bread crumbs instead of flour.  And, finally, I placed a couple of fresh basil leaves inside the chicken on top of the stuffing.  It was soooo delicious!  I made extra squash for the side and added some more cheese and chicken stock to make is flavorful and creamy.  It was really, really great.  Thanks!

This mixture minus the cheese is also wonderful with ground beef and Italian sausage browned and crumbled, then baked.

I really liked the stuffing--however, the chicken turned out extremely tough. Im not sure if I browned it too long and then cooked it the full 30 minutes and that made it tough... Don't know. Probably won't make it again.

I altered this recipe a lot, but it ended up being delicious, it was a lot trouble  to make in a small kitchen, hence the 4 stars. I couldn't cut my acorn squash, so I parboiled it and removed the flesh from the rind. I also layered the bottom of the baking dish with mushrooms and I added ground ginger and fresh rosemary to the flour mixture.

This was just okay. It took forever to chop up the acorn squash, and when I saw I only needed 1/2 a cup I felt super frustrated. Of course, I only used 2 breasts, so I went ahead and used the full squash and onion and green pepper (no celery because mine was dead) and just piled it all on top of the chicken. I decided to coat the chicken with flour and brown it...then I pounded it flat and rolled it up with some of the stuffing inside (secured with rouladen pins). Again, then I piled the rest of the veggies/cheese on top. I cooked about 20 minutes (covered). I loved the soft, moist texture of the chicken and the fresh and cheesy flavor, but my husband didn't think it had enough flavor-maybe if I used some kind of marinade before browning the chicken?

Delicious! I added zucchini and mushrooms and omitted celery. I also used red pepper, jack/cheddar cheese, and Italian bread crumbs based on others recommendations. Chicken is so juicy and tasted even better the next day at lunch! I served it with yellow rice which is a nice compliment I think. Thank you for the recipe!

I use pork chops instead of chicken.  I make the veggie mixture then I place uncooked chops in a 9x13 top with the veggie mixture and bake.  It is wonderful and a great way to use winter veggies!

I made it without the Cheddar cheese because of dietary restrictions. The filling was great before it was in the chicken (If I remember correctly, I rolled the chicken, didn't stuff it in the side), but there was WAY too much of it, and it was too bland once it was together with the chicken.

Very good except for we entirely changed the recipe! We used yellow squash in place of the acorn and added broccoli instead of the celery. It was really really good!! Everyone loved it.

This was absolutely fantastic!! I followed the advice of others and seasoned my flour (whole wheat flour--healthier and aided in the coloring) with a little Cajun seasoning and some garlic powder. I had some zucchini I needed to use, so I threw that in the pan with the squash. The veggies were looking a little dry but the onions still needed to soften, so I added a tablespoon or two of red wine I had in the fridge. It gave it a burst of flavor! Also, I totally agree with the person who said it was easier to stuff the chicken after browning it. It was easier to cut into the meat AND I didn't lose any stuffing. This is definitely in my rotation of recipes!!!

One word for this recipe.."Delicious". The only change I made was like another viewer said. I pounded the chicken, but I did not roll it with the stuffing. What I did was after I pounded it I spread the stuffing on it then topped it with another pounded piece of chicken, dredged it carefully in the flour and kinda squished it together, so it would hold together. When I browned it, I was just careful fliping it. The stuffing did not fall out. This worked out fine. Had stuffing on every bite. I did put a little olive oil in the bottom of the baking dish. This did not stick or anything. It was perfect !! Some cooked carrots, and baked potato made this a healthy meal. This was a very tasty chicken dish. Can't wait for leftovers tonight. Thanks for it, it definitely will be a regular on our table.

I made this recipe because I had some produce I needed to use and this recipe exactly matched what I had (other than the green pepper, which I don't really like anyway). I enjoyed it, and my husband thought it was pretty good, though he ate 2 breasts. I definitely will cut down on the onions next time, and I will make sure I cook the stuffing longer because the onions were still pretty strong. Overall, though, I thought it was a great different recipe that adds a little variety to what we typically eat. Thanks!

Very good.  Used acorn squash and it came out very well.  The only downside was prep time cutting up all the veggies.  Added some butter to the pan before browning chicken; next time I'll probably use olive oil.  Served with rice and carrots, it made a very nice meal with lots of good flavor.

This was okay.  I didn't brown the chicken, as earlier reviewers suggested, but i wish i had.  The flour just left a funny film on the chicken.  The stuff in the middle was okay.. The entire dish just needs something more, maybe dressing or something bready to hold it all together and add some more flavor.  Probably won't make this again.

This was surprisingly good.  I didn't have celery or green peppper on hand, so I used califlower, acorn squash, onion and colby cheese, it was great!  I'll make this again for guests this time.

I found this recipe to be far too labour-intensive for what I got out of it.  If I do make it again, I won't bother actually stuffing the chicken breasts; I will just lay them on top of the stuffing mixture in the casserole dish.  The recipe also requires more flavour, next time I'll add some seasoning.

Great flavor, but as others have said, very hard to brown the chicken without the filling spilling out.  I think I will do as others have said and brown the chicken first next time.

I ended up making it home a lot earlier than normal so I figured I give this recipe a try. I made just a few changes. I seasoned the veggies with garlic powder and lemon pepper (just a hint of each). I seasoned the chicken with smoked chipotle seasoning before stuffing it with the veggie mix. I coated the chicken and then  browned it. I used olive oil. Before placing the chicken in the oven I added a small pc of baby swiss cheese on top of each chicken. Chicken was flavorful, moist and delicious. The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because of the length of time it takes to make it. On a busy work/school night making this would have delayed dinner from being served.

This recipe was really good.  So glad I found it.  As I had all the ingredients or alternatives in stock.  I happen to have some frozen organic butternut squash that I used instead of the acorn squash, a few mushrooms, red bell pepper instead of green, onions, and celery.   I'm doing low carbs, so no flour or breadcrumbs.  Also omitted the cheese. I didn't brown the chicken breast first. I pounded it thin, as another reader did.   Seasoned it with salt, ground pepper, garlic powder, sage, and onion powder, sprayed some olive oil with the misto.  Rolling the stuffing and baked for about 45 mins.  It tastes like a healthy holiday!

Very good.  We didn't stuff the chicken with the squash mixture, we just made it as a side.  I would use a different color pepper than green, would give it more of a sweet taste.  We also used butternut squash which was great!

Made a mess, hard to keep the stuffing in the chicken, flour everywhere and more work than I thought it was worth. Chicken came out moist enough, though I did add some olive oil on top to keep it from drying out too much, but my friend had a 2" piece that was undercooked. Overall, probably won't be making this again.

This was very good. The recipe is a keeper, but will make some changes. I will roll the chicken up or bake on top of stuffing mixture next time.. it was hard to brown the stuffed chicken...messy.  After reading other reviews I was afraid of the chicken being bland, so i drizzled some italian dressing on the chicken a few hours before i prepared it and also used season breadcrumbs and a flour mixture for the coating. I used zucchini instead of the squash, yellow banana peppers instead of the green bell and portabella mushrooms instead of the celery, and parm. cheese instead of chedder-- all because thats what I had on hand.. and it turned out GREAT!!  Next time I will put it under the broiler for a few minutes at the end.  And the stuffing was excellent.. will also use as a side dish on occasion.  Thanks for the recipe.

My husband made a point of telling me twice that he loved it, and I thought it was one of the most delicious ways to use acorn squash I have ever tried. I didn't read the recipe all the way thru though, so I forgot to brown the chicken breasts before putting them in the pan, so I broiled them 20 min. and then baked them an additional 20 min. and they still turned out amazingly good. Next time I'll brown them though. Oh, and I also took some of the other reviews advice and added some poultry seasoning to my veggies while I sauted them.

the chicken had good flavor and my entire family enjoyed it, but it was far too much work to be worth it.  if you try this, I would encourage thicker breasts and increase the baking time.

This was a fantastic recipe!  I did however, change this recipe a bit to my own liking.  I used zucchini and yellow squash along with the celery, green peppers and onions and because I overcooked some chicken while defrosting, I cut it up into pieces and added it to the stuffing.  I didnt think the flour would be enough for seasoning the chicken so I used salt & pepper, a thin coating of bread crumbs and then sprinkled paprika on top.  I put the chicken in the oven for 35 minutes or so and then broiled for 2 minutes which made the top of the chicken nice and crunchy.  My husband and friends raved about this chicken!  Will definitly make this again!

Good idea, but it just didn't have enough flavor for me.  Maybe if it was coated with Italian bread crumbs?

I didn't have fresh chicken breasts and had to use frozen.  As they were so thin I put the stuffing on top.  It was beautiful.  As I don't care for green peppers, I swapped them out for red bell peppers which worked very well.  I've never cooked with acorn squash before so I was a bit leary, but it was a great success!  Will make a nice, quick guest dish too.

Loved this!  It was easy to make, just took the time to chop up the vegetables.  Used seasoned breadcrumbs instead of flour as suggested previously.  Also browned the chicken prior to stuffing to make it easier.  It came out really really well.  Even my picky son loved it which is why it gets 5 stars!

A LOT of work! I am used to stuffing chicken and rolling it, slicing it and stuffing it that way was defiantely more work.  I thought the cheese would give it an extra flavor since there weren't any spices or herbs other than salt and pepper but it didn't.  This looks very pretty and the chicken was moist but I would definitely add some spices to the mixture.

I was a little shy to try this recipe at first because the of the squash & veggie combo but The whole family gobbled this dinner. I love adding veggies to the main dish anyway I can & it's easy with this dish.  I butterflied the breasts & put a large mound of the delicious stuffing on each.  I also changed to olive oil for the sauteeing & seasoned the dredging flour. When I next make these I think I will omit the browning step because since I butterfly the breasts only the stuffing shows, saving a big step the prep.

I thought this was fabulous. 
I added some mushrooms, scallions and garlic to the stuffing. And also some fresh shredded parmesan cheese on top of the chicken when it was almost done baking. delicious!

This recipe was a great winter meal. I used butternut squash instead of acorn squash and it was great.  the only suggestion i have it to probably add more diced squash to the stuffing.

This was delicious and my family loved it!  My husband doesn't like to try too many new foods but he told me to add it to my recipe box.  It was a bit time consuming trying to chop all the vegetables but well worth the effort.  I will make it again but only on the weekend when I have more time.

This recipe was superb! I made it twice already. The only thing I find is that it makes too much stuffing for my chicken breasts, so  instead I put the stuff on the side.

Awesome. Entire family loved it. I altered the basic recipe by  doubling the portion of acorn squash and also used more onion than called for and replaced green bell pepper with red and yellow ( better taste as well as better presentation ). Also doubled the amount of cheese. And then I doubled the entire amount of the stuffing which is the crowning glory of this dish. This allows for liberally topping the breasts with stuffing after baking. Made it twice in two weeks .

It was delicious. I found that one acorn squash yielded 2 cups, so I quadrupled the other stuffing ingredients, and used the remainder after stuffing the breasts as a bed in the bottom of the baking dish. I used 1 c. gluten-free Italian bread crumbs instead of flour. Very rich, so I served it with rice.

Quite good.  Had to change the small onion to the green portion of four green onions as I am on a Low Fodmap diet which was all I was required to modify.  I suggest this would be good as a stuffing for fish as well.  Would certainly make it again as it is quite healthy as well as tasty.

Oh my gosh! This was absolutely wonderful! The whole family loved it! I substituted a red pepper for the green as that is what I had on hand and I did not use the cheese. Perfect and I will definitely make again. Thanks so much for sharing!

This was a phenomenal dinner. I made it a bit deconstructed. I chopped the acorn squash, onion, celery and a yellow bell pepper. Sauteed that in butter. Added 1/2 c. of herb stuffing mix because I don't eat cheese. Put this in the casserole dish, sprinkled with cinnamon. Browned the chicken in the same pan and placed that atop the stuffing. Cooked for 20 min in the oven. So delicious! Thanks for a fantastic recipe.

I fixed this the other night and thought I would really enjoy it because it has all of my favorite ingredients but it just didn't work for me, perhaps it was the cheddar I used (a shredded packaged type, which is hardly cheese at all!). I'm going to fix this a different way and post it.

I have made a bunch of different stuffed chicken, but I have to say that this one has become my new favorite!  Love you broccoli but squash taking over!  Yum Yum!

Used half of the squash for the stuffing for two people, and with the other half, used the acorn squash recipe on this site. It made a wonderful meal!

This is a very workable recipe in that the method and proportions are good; I halved the recipe for us two.  My changes: I brinned the chicken for 4+ hours, then followed a couple of reviews suggesting that the breasts be browned before stuffing and set them aside to cool for handling. I wanted to stuff just with squash (shredded then sauteed per the recipe), and I felt that the recipe lacked seasoning (hence only 4 stars), so I seasoned with a little cumin, curry powder, garlic granules, a tsp of fresh basil, some dried parsley, salt and pepper. Then added a big spoonful of sour cream and mixed it all up. Did not use the cheddar, but may do so next time, and will continue to tinker with the seasoning. Baked for about 25 min, then sprinkled shredded cotija cheese on top and broiled on low broil for a few minutes.  We both really liked the end result, and I will make it again.

This was to good! My husband said I could make this every day! I made changes to our taste. I did not stuff the chicken with the vegetables, I put them on the bottom of the baking dish and around the chicken after I sautéed them. I breaded the chicken with egg bath than Italian seasoned bread crumbs, I added some fresh grated parm cheese to the bread crumbs. and browned inn butter. I seasoned it all with our favorite seasonings.

It was delicious. I didn't have the celery but it didn't matter. The chicken was so juicy and tasteful. I did add my own seasoning, of course. But nonetheless, I loved it. I will make it again. Thank you

I've made this a couple of times now and my family members ask for the recipe. It's always a hit! I don't brown or dip the chicken in flour. I simply stuff them, place them in a baking pan, and cover with foil. I add any extra mixture to the tops of them and remove the foil about 10 minutes before they are done. The chicken comes out tender and so good. I will be making this tonight for dinner!

Amazing! And healthy. Sweet and savory. I replaced the green pepper for red and yellow small ones, added my own special cajun seasoning, and sandwhiched the veggie cheese mix in between 2 chicken tenders instead of stuffing breasts. What I couldn't fit in between the chicken i put on top to soak in the extra flour. Perfect texture and taste. Something I would make to show off my cooking to mom :p I paired this with a maple bacon aoli for a nice fall taste.

We made this recipe last night and loved it!  I substituted shredded parm for cheddar because that is all I had at home, but it was a great substitution.  I didn't not think it was a difficult recipe at all.  I just didn't completely stuff the chicken when I browned them and instead stuffed them when in the baking dish.

Excellent recipe.  I opted for 1/2 of a small acorn squash instead of 1/2 cup.  Made for some extra stuffing to put in the baking dish and have with the meal.  Heats up wonderfully too!

The recipe as is needs some work.  I took suggestions from other reviewers and added some poultry seasoning, 2 garlic cloves, and about 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes.  I also didn't have squash on hand so I used yellow zucchini and broccoli.  I also used some pins to keep the filling in while browning and baking.  With all these tweaks the recipe was good... and chicken was moist.

I surprised myself at how easy it was to make this taste so good, since I've never cooked such a deep recipe before!  I read some of the reviews before even going to the store to get items for this.  I took someone's idea to use garlic, and I also improvised on my own to add 3 serano peppers.  I actually used every bit of all the vegetables I bought except the celery.  I used about 4 or 5 pieces of the stalk.  30 min @ 350 was perfect!  Browning chicken adds lots of flavor!

My husband and I both thought this was one of the best leftover lunches we've ever had- the squash mixture is fantastic heated back up!  I don't take the time to stuff the chicken anymore, when I make it I just make a bunch of the squash mix, layer it in a pan with the chicken and put more squash on top.

After reading the reviews for this, I tried to streamline some of the prepping, as well as eliminate some of the "blandness," so around lunch time I diced all the veggies, put them in a tupperware bowl and added a little bit of Italian dressing, tossed it all together and put it in the fridge.  I used less onion and more squash than was called for, just because I'm not that big of a fan of onion.  I also took the advice of one of the previous reviewers and cut the chicken before fully thawed.  My family liked it, and I will definately be making again, even if it is a little time consuming.  :D

It was good, but I would use a summer squash instead of the acorn squash. The sweetness seemed to throw the dish off a little. Plus, I will half the amount of celery.

This was fantastic, my boyfriend and I loved it. I was out of celery so I threw in what I had on hand--it happened to be parsnips and was fantastic. Oh, and after sauteeing the vegetables, I simmered them in some sherry. Came out perfect.

Very delicious but a lot of work and a little tricky to keep the stuffing inside the breast.  I would rate this 5 stars for flavor, but 4 stars for the difficulty.

I followed recommendations to just add the chicken on top of the squash stuffing, and the chicken turned out delicious...but I did not care for the stuffing mixture.  I also found the recipe somewhat tedious to make.  I wasn't sure whether I should remove the peel from the squash (which I did) or boil it to make dicing easier (which I also did).  Maybe this recipe is better w/ a different type of squash (instead of acorn)?  Or maybe it was just the cook?

Well, it was good.  Just nothing special.  It was actually a bit bland in my opinion.

Well it passed the husband test. He doesnt usually like "weird" things like squash...but this was great. I used butternut squash instead of acorn, and didn't have green peppers. I used Johnny's Seasoning Salt. It was delicious anyways! Very moist and flavorful! We loved it :)

This was a great tasting meal although I did find it somewhat difficult to keep the stuffing in the chicken. I will be trying this one again.

Tasty and delicious!  I used Cheddar and Monterey Cheese.  Inside stuffing is great.  Made extra and put it on top of the chicken.  My husband loved it!
