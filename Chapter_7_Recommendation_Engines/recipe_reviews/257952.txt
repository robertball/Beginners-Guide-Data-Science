Made as written and these turned out good. I honestly thought the uncooked chicken would water down everything else once it cooked and I'd be left fishing for everything but I was wrong. The one thing that stood out as different to me in this was using corn tortillas instead of flour. I liked that. You really do need to toast them in a skillet first though. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing.
