This was excellent, the whole family enjoyed it.  I added black beans to give it more protein because I served it for dinner. I would give it 5 stars but it seemed like it needed a little something else in terms of spices.  I will definitely make again and experiment with some herbs or spices.  Thank you, I love Quinoa recipes!

Fantastic! The only thing I changed was to add about 1/4 C chopped cilantro. Wonderful blend of colors, texture and flavor.

Absolutely delicious! This would be great in the summer with gazpacho.  I made it without celery because I didn't have any on hand, and it was great. I'm sure, however, that the celery would taste very good in it.

This was the first time I made Quinoa and frankly was a little afraid the family would not like it...I was right; they LOVED it. My 8 year old liked it just cooked in the chicken broth and my older ones & husband liked it either way. Since then I've also added some athenos reduced fat crumbled feta w/tomato & basil (once its cold and toss)...YUM! Thank you so much for this awesome recipe!!!

Great recipe! The only thing I changed was to use vegetable broth to keep it vegetarian. Good on its own or as a side.

I thought it was quite tasty.  I didn't use celery because I don't like it but it was great without it.  I think next time I'll try it with cilantro per some of the other ratings.

I'm not sure that this is the best quinoa recipe, but it is worth trying. It's nice and light for a hot summer day. I added cilantro as mentioned by other reviewers. I think I'll try it again with black beans, replace the lemon with a lime and omit the celery, it didn't add anything for me.

I didn't have any chicken or vegetable broth so I just cooked the quinoa in water. The salad overall had a simple yet delicious taste.

I absolutely love quinoa but I do not like it served cold.  THere was no taste to this dish.  Quinoa is much better served warm as a side dish.

Really good!  I added extra lemon just since I like it so much, and it added a really nice brightness to the salad.  I like the idea of cooking the quinoa in the chicken broth.  I've never tried that before and I'll do that from now on.  Next time I will peel the cucumber to cut some of the bitterness too.

Absolutely awesome!  Upon first taste, we weren't blown away, but we kept coming back for more and it really builds and gets better as you eat it.

Very tasty.  If I make it again I'll add more quinoa and double the lemon juice.  I also added onion which I'd recommend.

Good texture but no flavor.  Definitely need to add something more than just salt and pepper.  Previous suggestions for cilantro sound good.

this was fine, but not very flavourful. if i made it again, i'd really have to play with the spices. that being said, my dad seemed to enjoy it more than me, so perhaps it's just not to my taste.

*had leftovers the next day and thought it tastier and meriting four stars instead =)

This is a delicious, simple dish.  I made it as is, just skipped celery.  My one year old twins even loved it.  I will definitely make this simple recipe again.

I thought this was really good!  I was too impatient to wait for it to cool down so I tossed it all together and it was warm and yummy.  I also added cilantro as others suggested, and used vegetable broth instead of chicken.  It was great!

Loved it although I altered it a bit. Instead of large tomato, I used grape tomatos (halved), added small diced red onion, can of black beans, ground cumin and cayenne pepper. Yum! Super rich in protein.

really tasty! some people commented that they felt seasoning was lacking, but salt and pepper seemed like enough for me. we typically eat rice with dinner, but i've noticed my blood sugar spikes too much. quinoa feels like a much more stable source of energy. will def make this again.

Wonderful dish.  I added cilantro as someone recommended and the juice of one whole lemon rather than just the 2 Tbsp called for.  Quick and easy to make - this is a home run! (My husband can't say no to quinoa now!)

My wife and I are pescetarians; this recipe really hit the spot! We substituted vegetable broth for chicken broth, and orange bell peppers for celery-delicious!

Wonderful recipe as my family loves quinoa.  I used the red quinoa and added crumbled feta (cotija cheese would also be good).

Loved this recipe! cooked the quinoa in vegetarian chicken broth and it really flavoured the quinoa. loved that you dont have to use oils or high calorie dressing. Would definately make it again!its a perfect vegan lunch :)

This is incredibly yummy!  I like the idea of adding black beans and cilantro.

this was not to my liking!  Texture was too mushy for my liking.
