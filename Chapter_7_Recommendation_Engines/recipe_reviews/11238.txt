Consider yourself warned by this recipe's submitter:  This is NOT a soft and chewy cookie.  Since this recipe did not specify how big the dough balls should be, I shaped mine into 1-inch balls.  I ended up with enough for five dozens.  If you are going to roll them into 1-inch balls, DEFINITELY decrease the baking time.  I baked them for only 10 minutes, and they turned out quite dark and very crunchy.  If I use this recipe again, I may try baking them for only 7 to 9 minutes.  Also, when I first looked at this recipe, I was surprised by the amount of salt that it called for.  I decreased it to 1/4 teaspoon.  Later I found another recipe on this web site called "Chewy Peanut Butter Cookie" that had the EXACT ingredients with no salt at all.  Since my family prefers a softer and chewier cookie, I will probably go back to my old recipe.  Yet if you like a crunchy cookie, this recipe may just fit the bill.

This is a great recipe for use with a cookie press. As I normally do with cookie recipes, ...I reduced the sugar(s) to 3/4 cup (each), omitted the water and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla instead. I used the 7 point star mold and pressed an oversized chocolate chip in the center of each before baking ...for only 8 minutes. The cookies came out perfect and they really do melt in your mouth! (P.S. I became a member at allrecipes.com, just so that I could review this recipe!)

These cookies are delicious.  It was nice to have a peanut butter cookie recipe for the cookie press.  They were a big hit for the holidays.  Plus, they freeze beautifully.

I am in love with this cookie!  I was wanting to try something other than a traditional spritz cookie this christmas and I love peanut butter so I gave this a try.  I followed the recipe exactly except used margarine instead of shortening and I only baked for 10 minutes exactly.  They were chewy and soft and WONDERFUL.  So depsite all the reviews, and the posters insistence that these aren't a chewy cookie, mine turned out perfect.  Perhaps it was the shorter baking time.  I highly recommend this cookie.

These were really good, my hubby loves peanut butter cookies of any kind and he really loved these. I did cut the flower just a little to make them a bit crispier and less fluffy but other than that I stuck with the recipe. I made two batches and froze the rest.

What a nice change from spritz for the cookie press!  The 8 minutes was perfect in the oven.

These were the first thing I made with my new cookie press, and they were really good - not too sweet, easy to press, quick to bake.  The recipe made a million and I turned half of them into sandwich cookies with peanut butter and marshmallow cream.  So good!

I made these last night for practice, and they came out nicely, but I would only give 3 stars because I had to follow the review before this: omit the water , add vanilla and reduce the sugar.  They came out a bit too doughy, so I would reduce the flour to 2 - 1 34 cup because I like stickier peanut butter cookies.

Tuned out very good.  I omitted the water and added vanilla.  I didn't think it tasted very peanut buttery.  It didn't "melt in my mouth".  I had to chew.  In any case, it is a good cookie.

I have made several different types of cookies for Christmas this year but I gotta tell you THIS COOKIE WAS THE BEST YET.(unbelieveably yummy)..I added mini chocolate chips to my batch and chilled the dough for about two hours...one batch made 79 cookies for me..I didn't use my cookie press though this recipe would have yielded GREAT pressed cookies and a lot more most likely than I wound up with...Instead I dropped teaspoons full of dough on my cookie sheet (I used one of those cookie scoopers)..WORKS WONDERFUL...I then criss crossed each cookie with a fork that I dipped in flour so dough wouldn't stick to the fork..I put 20 cookies on per sheet.I baked them for 14 minutes..these cookies are FABULOUS...I will be making another batch in a few days because I know they won't last long in my house for sure...they MELT IN YOUR MOUTH just like the title of the cookie says..THANK YOU so very, very much for sharing this recipe...HINT:  if you don't have one of those cookie scoopers get cha one...(Wal-Mart has them)...they are really a GREAT kitchen tool for making cookies if you bake a lot of them like I do.

These were pretty good peanut butter cookies.  They have the classic "sandy" texture and mine were slightly chewy in the center.  The first batch I made burned but when I took them out after 8-9 minutes they were perfect.  Decrease your baking time!

Great recipe for a cookie press. Just press them out, stick in the oven and a couple of minutes before they are done add a Hershey's kiss and there you have it!  Beautiful, tasty cookies.

Love this recipe! I also used margarine instead of shortening. Worked perfectly in my cookie press! Only reason I didn't rate it 5 is the cooking time (which also could be my oven) I would suggest doing a "test" cookie before cooking them all. I cooked mine for 7 minutes and they are perfect! Thanks for sharing!!

These turned out great!  I used the cookie press with no problems.

Cooking time listed in the recipe was very high... I only cooked a little over 9 minutes.  But otherwise, everyone loved them!

This is a fantastic recipe for the cookie press, I switched shortening for butter since I prefer not to bake with shortening.  I'm also glad I cut the recipe in half because using my press I was still able to get about 70 cookies out of it using different discs.  Will definitely use this recipe again.  I also recommend cutting the time down, I baked each batch between 5-8 minutes depending on the shape and size.

These cookies are soft and chewy.  My husband thought something was missing.  I compared other recipes and noticed most called for vanilla extract.  I am going to add a few teaspoons next time.  I decreased the baking temp to 350.  Just don't like to bake anything at 375 seems to hot in my oven.  12 minutes is too long of a baking temp unless you make really really big cookies.  I made walnut sized balls baked them about 8-9 min let them sit on the cookie sheet a few min and they are perfect.  I also got between 5-6 dozen compared to the 3 dozen the recipe says it makes so I must have made mine alot smaller.

I couldn't get these to work in my cookie press but they taste pretty good anyways.  I took the suggestion of taking out the water and adding vanilla, which works.  I also added about 1 tsp of cinnamon, which brings out the flavour.  I ended up making blossom cookies (with Hershey's kisses in them), which came out well

I never would have thought of doing peanut butter cookies in my press - but these were so easy and so yummy!  I did follow suggestions from other reviewers of using margarine instead of shortening.  And I changed the baking time/temp to 325 for 10 minutes.

When my husband bit into his first one, he said, "These just MELT IN YOUR MOUTH."  He didn't know that's what they're called. I, too, added 2tsp vanilla and eliminated the water. I think I will add a bit more PB as well

I loved these cookies!  I cut back both sugars to 3/4 each and they turned out perfect - not too sweet with a perfect peanut butter taste!  I'm terrible with a cookie press and I wasn't able to get mine to work, so I just rolled them into balls, flattened them with a fork and topped them with a few chocolate chips.  Yummy!

I'm a beginner with the cookie press, but if you follow the recipe as it stands, this is very hard to work with the press.  They also don't have much flavor and are just boring.

These really are melt in your mouth. I followed the recipe to the T and they are wonderful. I was looking for a crunchy cookie. I only got about 2 dozen. We like our cookies big. :)

Really easy to make...I pinch the dough into little cone, punch a little hole (use chopstick) and piped in jam.  Then pinch more dough to cover the hole. Flatten it down with a fork.  It became PBJ cookies! Yummy!

These are my absolute favorite Cookie Press Recipe! They are so good - and I dont' even like peanut butter cookies! They have a great texture and are just a fantastic addition to your cookie press recipe collection.

A long overdue rating. I've made these cookies for the past 2 Christmases and they are a big hit! Delicious and easy and excellent for the cookie press. Not heavy like typical peanut butter cookies, either. Light and crispy! They really do melt in your mouth!

These cookies are delicious; however, I did have some trouble with the dough in my cookie press.  Even when refrigerated, it was a bit too moist and pliable for the press.  I had better luck rolling them into 1-inch balls and flattening them with a fork.  I'll definitely make them again, I just won't use the cookie press.

So yummy! Followed recipe. Didn't add water -cause I didn't feel like it. Baked in convection oven at 325 for 12 mins until- starting to brown on bottom and a large crack appeared on the top. Delicious! Soft. Chewy. Yummy! Enjoy!

I made these cookies and they really were "melt in your mouth cookies"! I'm not sure why one review said they were not a soft cookie. Mine were just the right combination of soft with a bit of crunch on the outside.

This recipe worked well with my cookie press.  I even used less white sugar - just over 1/2 cup and they were still very sweet and yummy. They were a huge hit!

The cookies were very good, but they were not melt in your mouth. I would say they were chewy.

The worst recipe I have tried on here. I only made one batch of them and threw the rest of the dough away. They tasted like play dough. I thought it would be interesting to try a peanut butter cookie without brown sugar. I  was wrong and will stick with the ones made with brown sugar.

What a great cookie! I used this recipe as my first cookie-press attempt...and it worked wonderfully! I did bake the cookies for only about 6 minutes and they turned out great. I plan on making this cookie for many years to come!

This was my first time baking peanut butter cookies and was so glad my daughter loved it! I used butter instead of shortening, only 1 tbsp water and 2 cups of flour instead of 2 1/2.

Peanut butter usually results in a hearty, chewy type of cookie. I doubted that this recipe could really be "melt in your mouth", and unfortunately, I was right. This is a flavorful cookie, but hardly the light-textured result that the recipe might lead you to believe.

I followed this recipe exactly and then popped the dough in my cookie press.  I took the advice of another reviewer and used the shapes that were more open because the cookies do spread.  I made really cute butterflies, flowers, and cookies with a perfect opening in the center to hold a Hershey's kiss.  The cookies are crunchy and delicious.  I used honey roast peanut butter.  I also only needed to bake them for 7-8 minutes.  I'll be making these again!

Very good cookies, will definitely make them again. I found it best to use the bigger shapes on my cookie press because they spread a lot while baking (perfect for those flower/star shapes where the individual pieces don't touch when you first press the dough through, because when the dough spreads during baking they join together and look the nicest.)

Made these almost as recipe stated (added 1 tsp vanilla).  I kept the salt and the shortening (the shortening is probably responsible for the melt in your mouth quality and the salt is needed because of no butter).  I also baked at 350 via convection oven and made giant cookies (about 2 doz) baking about 12 min golden on top starting to brown on edges. Yumm just what I wanted.  I don't like chewy peanut butter cookies though if you baked them less they would be chewier.  I had no problem with being too thin and did not use press.  I just rolled 1.5 inch balls and pressed down to about 2 1/2-3" circle with my hand.  Thanks everyone.

These cookies had an excellent taste and they were very easy to make. However, the cookies turned out a little flat.  Maybe next time I will omit the water for a thicker cookie. You wouldn't know the difference though if you ate them blindfolded.  Thanks for sharing.  I will make again.

These peanut butter cookies are fabulous!!!  I don't know about the melt in your mouth, but they sure melted off of the plate :o)  And as for kid friendly, I don't know because the kids couldn't talk.  Their mouths were full of them.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

This was the first recipe I tried in my brand new cookie press. It was fun and easy. The cookies were crunchy but not hard. They also had a perfect taste, not too "peanut buttery". My husband, who doesn't like peanut butter liked them.

The time recommended was too long.  The cookies were hard and crunchie, not what I imagined.  Might try them again but substract at least 2-3 minutes off the cooking time.

Mmm, very tasty! I used a cookie press heart shape, and they were quite small, so it made a lot of cookies, and I had to adjust the baking time. Once I figured that out and stopped burning them (by the third pan), they turned out great.

What a cookie!  I'm not a big peanut butter fan.  I made them for my husband and I'm the one eating them all.  I put a miniature kiss in the middle before I baked them.  I used a cookie press with the flower disc and with the chocolate center they're a pretty sight too.

These were good, I used unsalted butter instead of shortening, I added a tea spoon of vanilla and about an extra half cup of flour because the dough was too sticky to roll for the press, also I used confection sugar instead of white sugar, These worked great in the cookie press ( was my first time ever using one) Also I baked them in a 300' oven on parchment paper for 12 minuets.

Please, if you are looking for a regular peanut butter cookie, pause a minute - this is a SPRITZ recipe.  As far as I can tell, some of the more critical reviews for this recipe tried to use it for your typical hashtaged rolled ball peanut butter cookie, so don't let them stop you from trying this if you're after a peanut butter spritz. If you are not familiar with the delicacy that is the spritz cookie, I would recommend you do some research.  My favorite is a retro cream cheese recipe, but this is a wonderful new spritz recipe for me.  I used my cookie press (needed for traditional spritz cookies) on the 5 petal flower die cut, and the dough was shaped easily and cooked nicely - in my oven, after about 6 minutes.  My cookies tasted pretty yummy and were definitely soft and chewy.

These were very good.  I made the first batch at 8 minutes.  They were a little too well done for our taste.  The second batch I made at 6 minutes and boy were they "Melt in Your Mouth" good!  Did not put in a press, just rolled in a ball and flattened which kept sticking to the fork even though I tried flour and then spraying it with Pam.  Ended up just flattening with a bottom of a glass cup sprayed with Pam.

Well, I wouldn't quite say 'melt in your mouth,' but they were tasty! I did a half-batch and, with my smallish cookie press, got about six dozen cookies! I substitute margarine and butter in place of shortening for lots of cookie recipes without problems, and that might help make these more melt-in-your-mouth wonderful. Also, I had to lower the oven to 350 and they only took 6 or 7 minutes. I had to chuck two pans of cookies that I baked for 9 minutes, they were black on the bottom! Oh, a warning: If there are any hard brown sugar lumps in the dough, they will likely clog up your press. I didn't think of it before filling the press with dough. Next time, I'll definitely make sure my brown sugar is lump-free! Thanks for sharing, Angie!

Hard to press.  Not really flavorful.  Kind of dry, and I only cooked 8 minutes.  Might be my fault.  Won't make again.  :(

My family loved these cookies! The dough could not go through my cookie press so I added 2 tablespoons of vanilla, it still did not work so I made traditional peanut butter cookies and I added some peanut butter chips and chocolate chips to half of the dough. I was kind of frustrated but at the end I came out with an impressive cookie tray.

These cookies were really easy to make. They had practical ingredients that you can find in your kitchen and the prep time was about 10 minutes.  They also only took 8 minutes to bake- which is really fast.  But the ending results were not as great as we thought they would be.  There wasn't enough peanut butter in it and it needed more sugar.  They tasted very plain and didn't have a lot of taste to them.

Easy to make.  Not so easy to use in a cookie press.  My dough keep expanding and made it hard to get a nice shape from the press.  Good cookie, but wouldn't recommend for a press.  Would make again.

This was a good recipe if you like a crunchy cookie, but I like peanut butter cookies a little softer.  I put a chocolate kiss in the center before I cooked some of them, but they spread out too wide for the kiss to look right.    Maybe I should have experimented with cooking time a little more to get a softer cookie, but the few variations I tried didn't work that well.  The cookies weren't bad, just not my favorite.

These are fantastic cookies.  I am not a big peanut butter cookie lover but I couldn't keep my hands out of these...mmmm good!  I did add a tad bit more water than it called for and they were just perfect.

This recipe generated over 5 dozen cookies!!! Great with a chocolate chip planted in the middle. My kids can't get enough of them and they helped make them too!

Only one problem.... I HAVE TO MAKE MORE!  Definitely the way to MY man's heart!!  I didn't understand the 'altitude' bit, but they turned out fine after an adjustment to cooking time. (L.Persse, England)

The best peanut butter cookies I've ever had.  They didn't last long in our house.

Simply delicious!  Made this for a function, but our family ate them so fast I had to bake another batch right away.  Also made them with flower shape and small chocolate "Kiss" in center.  Then made some as "thumb prints" with fruit pastry filling in center which were excellent also.
