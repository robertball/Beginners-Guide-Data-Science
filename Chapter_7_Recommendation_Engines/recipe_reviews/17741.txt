I'm from Hawaii and this recipe will not work! There way too much soy sauce the chicken will be too salty to eat. Don't waste your time or money making this chicken recipe.

This is actually a great recipe. I live in Hawaii also and this is very similar to huli huli chicken. Six cups is about right in order to cover 10 pounds of chicken. This is a great dish. I have made this tons of times for the family and they love it. I grill it with thin slices of ginger over the top of the chicken. Also a quick note! If you combine these ingredients in a crock pot and throw the same amount of chicken in you will end up with wonderful tender peices of chicken to serve over rice. We call that shoyu chicken!

I reduced all the amounts signifantly. Who has ever heard of this much soy sauce going in a recipe? I dropped my soy sauce down to a mere three tablespoons and only did four thighs.

This sauce is actually very similar to Huli Huli sauce manufactured in Hawaii. Marinating it for a full 24 hours it had just the right blend of salty sweet spicy. The second time we made it (and we used 1/3 as much chicken and adjusted the other ingredients accordingly) we added a couple Tablespoons of Sweet Chili Sauce and it was more ono than ever!

Family loved it. Didn't have time to marinate overnight so poked lots of holes with a fork and made marinade extra thick by using only 1 cup water and added 1/2 cup corn syrup. Blackened the thighs on the grill. Flipped several times basting each time. Finished them off in the oven at 400F about 15-20 minutes.

Try low sodium soy sauce (preferably Kikkoman) and the finished dish will not be so salty

I used Low Sodium Soy Sauce - about 4 cups - upped the garlic to 4 cloves. This is very tasty. Please use the chicken thighs even if you really like white meat chicken this recipe will surprise you. The boneless skinless thighs cook really fast so be careful to not over cook them.
