This was good but not great. However, my husband went back for seconds and he hates spinach. I used less spinach than the recipe called for (maybe 12 oz) and still found I had to add more milk and garlic powder than what the recipe called for. I also added some fresh parmesan cheese as well. Thanks!

This has a wonderful flavor, however, it wasn't creamy enough for me. Next time I will double everything except the spinach. Still a great recipe! Thanks Lisa!

I thought this was great.  I was not crazy about the bacon so I think next time I will use it as a topper rather than part of the dish.  I used fresh spinach rather than frozen.  Fresh garlic rather than powder.  I also added fresh grated parmesan cheese just before serving.  I also would have liked it more creamer so I will experiment with that next time.

it was goooood... 
I did use fresh Spinach about 10oz, chopped garlic glove (about 3 medium size),grana padano cheese, and pre-cooked chopped sausage.
make sure you sateed the garlic, onions, sausage with butter first then spinach til the water is almost dry. then add the milk, cheese, butter, and flour. continue to stir it til very creamy.

We did a little change up to this recipe and absolutely loved it!
Cut bacon and cook until nearly done add in the onion and complete cooking. Decrease the butter amount because the bacon was not drained (used leaner bacon). Made the cream sauce with some added parmesean cheese about a tbsp or 2. Less milk and added weight watchers cream cheese.
Fresh spinach.
Poured creamed sauce over fresh spinach and served. AWESOME!

I was searching but could not find a previous recipe so I thought I'd give this one a try.  It wasn't till after I started that I realized the recipe called for two packages of spinach and I only had one.  I used all ingredients as called for except the one package and I cut back on the milk by 1/4 cup.  I added a little nutmeg too.  Although the bacon was good....it's not my favorite flavor to go with the creamed spinach.  I might try some parmesan next time too.  Thanks!

I thought this was great just the way it is. I followed the recipe though cut in half since its just my husband and I. It made the perfect amount for both of us as a side dish. We try to stay low carb so this is a great side dish option. Thanks!

Thanks Lisa!  Just whipped this together on a whim and my husband & daughter both loved it!! Both are picky eaters, but suffer through all of my concoctions.  They each had 2 helpings...very impressed. I loved it also!

I didn't have any butter, so I actually fried the bacon, and then used the bacon fat in place of the butter. Yummy!

I thought it tasted fine, though have no frame of reference because I had never made bacon before. The recipe looks daunting, but it is quite easy if you follow it closely. The guest who really likes creamed spinach had two servings.

This was quite good. Definitely a keeper. The only thing I changed was to use a little bit more bacon. Next time I think I might use fresh spinach.

I tried this recipe on a whim one night.  It was alright for what it was,but I think the sauce could be creamier, or could use cheese incoporated into it.  I think it is a basic recipe for a novice cook.

This was very good. The spinach eaters in my family liked it, too! I skipped the bacon, and used half-and-half instead of milk. We will definitely make this again.

This was so not anything like real creamed spinach.  Ridiculous amount of fat, tasted more like milk/cream and bacon. The flavors did not meld well, and this was disappointing. 

The consistency was not good either -- it did not feel like the spinach integrated with the sauce. Very not good

I had never heard of creamed spinach and decided to give it a try.. can't loose with garlic and bacon right? Wrong. This was so bland, could not bring myself to eat more then one bite.

My husband and I totally love spinach and this has taken our love to a whole new level! I add a little more bacon, and use a dash of Creole seasoning to kick it up a bit. I have made this several times and each time the creamed sauce seems to get better! I do add more pepper and salt than suggested but then again, all seasoning is to the cooks personal taste so I will not take away for that. Oh, and I also just cook everything in the same pan instead of making such a to do with several. I think it makea everything taste wonderful. Thank you so much for this delicious spin on spinach!

Great recipe with a bit of variation. I added a block of low fat cream cheese and a few pepper flakes. When I made it the previous time it was not creamy enough. This time it was consumed before it made its way to the dinner table. My son who never eats veggies said " mom this rocks." I will definitely cook this again.

Great recipe! I used coconut oil instead of butter, and fresh garlic, also added about 1 tbsp of balsamic vinegar and it was rich and very tasty!

I thought this was a really good recipe.  I did cut the recipe in half for the two of us.  I'm not a huge spinach fan but this recipe seemed to have just the right amount of everything and the dish came together well.  I will make this again.
