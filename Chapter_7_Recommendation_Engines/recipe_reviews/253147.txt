I could only find vanilla so I upped the chocolate and raspberries. This was fabulous! I will make again and again.

I finally found Lactaid ice cream, but all the store had was vanilla or cookies and cream. I used the cookies and cream and added strawberries to the shake (I'm not a big fan of raspberries/blackberries). I mixed Lactaid (used 2%) and powdered sugar for a minute and then added strawberries and mixed for another minute.  Instead of putting the chocolate on top, I swirled it in the glass before filling with the shake. I put non-dairy whipped topping on top and added a cherry. The Lactaid makes an "icier," not as creamy shake, but it was still very good.
