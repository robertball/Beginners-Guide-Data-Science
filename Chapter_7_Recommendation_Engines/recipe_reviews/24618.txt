Egg was messy!! Was more like a mini omelet than a tart. Probably will not make again.

These were great! I dont know what people are talking about with the egg being messy, mine turned out wonderfully and tasted great!  I made them for a cocktail party and they were perfect as I served them warm, but still taste amazing once they cool down.  Definitely a great recipe that I will be keeping and making again and again!

Yum! These were tasty, fast, and easy to make. I didn't have Monterey Jack cheese, so I used a combination of mozzarella and cheddar. The egg wasn't very messy, but I baked these for about 25 minutes at 420* (my oven never sets the exact temp you want, it's always off about five degrees.) And, once you let them cool like specified, they harden up a bit, so they shouldn't be soggy at all. So good, I'll be making this again, thanks Jim.

I love this recipe - I am a big fan of jalapeno pie and this is a great alternative. Much lower on the carbs! This is so easy and the little 'tarts' are delicious.  I make these all the time now to have on hand for a grab and go breakfast or for an afternoon snack.  I like them at room temp or even cold from the frig.  I also prefer to make these in muffing tins.

These are a favorite with my family for parties and as a fun side for mexican dishes.  The egg is less messy if you take your time pouring it in from a measuring cup.  It is tedious but SO worth it!

I have made these over and over again for the last year.  They are a spectacular way to use up all of the peppers in my garden.  I just add the raw cut up garden peppers (Jalapenos, habaneros or whatever else is on hand)then follow the same recipe.  This is also good with cilantro instead of the parsley.  I have also done this with a TSP Garlic salt, TB of Cumin and a TB of coriander for a Mexican twist.  This recipe has never let me down no matter how I switch it up.

Wow, I must have done something wrong since so many other reviewers loved it so much.  One mistake was using the mini cupcake liners - the paper was stuck to the food and impossible to separate.  But aside from that, the flavor was really just not very good.  Not sure if I will try this one again.

Great finger food -- that's the way everybody ate them, even though I put out cocktail forks and plates. I specifically used pickled jalapenos with the little tidbits of carrot and such in them. They are much spicier, so use less. I laid a nice slice on the bottom, then served them bottoms up so people could see the pepper. Pretty presentation on a bed of cilantro from the produce aisle.

I didn't exactly read the directions all the way through and ended up mixing all of my ingredients together in a bowl instead of layering.  These still turned out super yummy!  I can't wait to try different variations

I just made these for Super Bowl Sunday, what a hit!  They are much better than Jalapeno Poppers with all the breading. Served with Sour Cream to dip them in.  Great for parties and not too spicy hot.

Despite the heat (not flavor really) from the jalapenos, these are incredibly bland.

I made these last weekend for a weekly party we have and we loved them.  There are some comments about them being messy - we cut them in quarters and had no problem.

Super easy!  Just try not to overflow the egg while pouring it into the pan.

I love these.  Every time I make them someone asks for the recipe.  I use cheddar instead of Monterrey jack.  These are so easy, always turn out perfectly, and they taste great too.
