This was tasty, but there are a few things that I would do differently in the future.  First, if you’re browning boneless chicken breasts for 8 mins/side (total of 16 mins), you really do not have to then simmer it for one hour.  That much time actually changes the texture of the chicken breast, making it a little stringy and dry.  I would cut back that time DRAMATICALLY.  Also, the sauce is sooooo good on its own that I will skip the half-and-half and parmesan in the future, and just serve the chicken with the rich tomato-marsala sauce.  You’ll save a lot of calories and fat by eliminating that parmesan sauce (2 cups is way too much parmesan), and I think the dish would have MUCH better presentation without it.  I don’t think that the parmesan sauce added much flavor, and it really didn’t develop into a smooth and creamy sauce.  As I always do, I try to make a recipe as written the first time, and the only thing I did differently was add some mushrooms, they're an important and traditional ingredient for chicken marsala.  This is quite a different combo of ingredients, and I will make this again, but with the modifications mentioned above.  One final comment, the recipe name is a bit of a misnomer because there really isn't anything in it that makes it spicy.

Very Good!  Changed up the recipe just a bit... added fresh mushrooms and cut the parmesan cheese in half.  This will be a make again recipe at our house!

made it for the first time, and liked it very much. I would advise heating the cream in a seperate pan bring it to a mid boil then adding the parm slowly blending it together before adding it to the marsala. this way the cheese is smoother. also the mushrooms are a must.

Great recipe and will make it for the family again. I would recommned adding less parmesan cheese. 2 cups of cheese for 6 servings was too much for the family. I will try serving the cheese on the side the next time.

I have made this recipe twice and my boy-friend loved it so much he had me make it for his mother. She loved it just as much. There was nothing I would change. Mind you I am not a great cook. I recommend this for anyone. We loved it.

I enjoyed this, the family was not as impressed.  I followed the recipe exactly except for cutting down on the Parmesan cheese.  It is very salty though probably doe to the bacon, bouillon, cheese and maybe the tomatoes.  Next time, I will look for ways to cut down on the salt.
