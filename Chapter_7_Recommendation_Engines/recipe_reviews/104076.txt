These came out pretty good. I like to try to modify things to be healthy but with this recipe I don't think I would. I just don't think it would taste the same.

This treat is so different that it is good. It has a very unique flavoring that I did not expect. If you like these, try the lemon raspberry bars too.

These bars are delicious. I used fat-free sour cream and creams cheese instead of low-fat and they still tasted good.
