Great stew.  Parents won't eat tongue, but didn't tell them and they loved it.  I wasn't sure about using taco seasoning mix but it worked great.  We are garlic lovers so added minced garlic in with the veggies.  My husband want s to know when I will be making this again.

It was really tasty, and I was very hesitant.  My husband had eaten tongue before, so I went for it and didn't regret it.  I might have added too much taco seasoning.

This recipe was great!  I boiled the tongue for about 2 hours with 1/2 an onion, a few cloves of crushed garlic, peppercorns and a couple of bay leaves.  It was really easy to skin it when it was warm. Once you remove the main skin, there is another layer of fatty skin underneath; you can either leave it on or take it off with a knife. In the stew recipe, I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, I reduced the onion and the taco seasoning just a little bit because the beef tongue was a bit under two pounds. It had a great flavor and was not over powering at all. I thought this would taste too much like taco filling, but it didn't.  I will certainly be making this again!!
