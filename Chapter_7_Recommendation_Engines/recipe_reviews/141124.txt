This would have been a 5, had I followed the recipe! I didn't have any beef  stock, so I used beef bouillon with 1 cup of water. After reducing so much during the cooking, the sauce became so salty it was almost inedible! So... note to others, DO NOT USE BEEF BOUILLON!

This recipe is AWESOME!  I first tried it while on a diet, trying to find low-calorie recipes.  I thought surely my husband would hate it...he can't get enough of these!  I now HAVE to have pork chops frozen at all times so we can thaw them out to cook this recipe on any given day!  I also spiced up each pork chop individually and spread them on by hand.  I use about double to rosemary and garlic.  It helps to cook them in a smaller sized pan so the broth really gets soaked into the chops.

This recipe is delicious!  Instead of combining the salt, pepper, and rosemary in one bowl, I sprinkled the chops individually so that the ingredients were evenly distributed.

These were wonderful!  The smell alone made my mouth water!  Very easy to make.  I used a full can of beef broth to simmer them in and then turned into a gravy by whisking some cornstarch into it.  Couldn't let that stuff go to waste.  So good!  The rosemary and garlic worked very well together!

So delicious!  I doubled the recipe and added a can of cream of mushroom soup to thicken the broth a bit and it came out wonderfully.  A new family favorite!

Tasty. I did add some onion powder, that was all. This smelled SO good while it was cooking. Very simple. I'd use this again.

This was a pretty good recipe.  I used fresh rosemary instead of the dry and simmered the chops for 1 hour.  We will have this again.

This was very easy to make and yummy.  I added way more broth than what was called for by accident so when I took the chops out i added flour and made a gravy for my mashed potatoes, Mmmm!

My daughter and I loved this, however, my husband didn't like because he thought the herbs were too heavy.  I may make again with lighter seasoning.

Great taste, succulent, and very diverse with the balance of flavors. I used fresh rosemary - rubbing the fresh leaves across the chops, adding salt and pepper right before browning. The sauce is perfect - I used my own beef broth I made recently - so I could adjust the salt taste from there. I also put a small sprig of rosemary into the pan juice and let that cook down a bit. A taste from heaven and beyond. Thanks for posting!

I thought this was pretty good. I think I didn't leave the pork chops on long enough because they were a bit tough. However, the actual recipe was good and simple. I will try it again.

Overall, tasty with only a few straighforward ingredients.  Even having used low-sodium broth, I found them quite salty and would cut down on the salt content next time.  I was frustrated that, despite using a smallish skillet, the broth wasn't enough to submerge the chops (-- was this even the idea? --), and I'm afraid they ended up a little bit tougher as a result.

This was a great recipe even though I made a few changes and messed up a little.  I used a new Penzey's seasoning called Bavarian Seasoning (crushed brown mustard, rosemary, garlic, thyme, bay leaves, and sage).  I also used chicken broth instead of beef, because that's all I had.  The flavor was great and I will use this recipe again.  I forgot to turn it down when I added the broth, even though I overcooked it a little, it tasted very good.

I used two bone in porkchops and scaled down the recipe for two.  It was delicious, My husband said he wasn't hungry but ate every bite on his plate.  I substituted chicken broth and saved the leftover juice to make a gravy for another dish.  YUMMY!

LOVED this. So flavoful yet so simple. Your house will smell delicious from beginning to end. I added a little cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it up and make a to die for gravy. No leftovers to speak of is my only complaint!

I made this last night and it was delicious!  I used Emeril's beef stock instead of low sodium beef stock and it did not turn our too salty.  I also added a splash of Chianti. I made basmati rice, cute the pork chops into cubes, and spooned the pork chops and au jus over the rice.  My 4 year old twin girls even liked it!  And so easy!  This one is definitely in the weekly rotation.

This was so easy and made me feel like some kind of gourmet chef!  My husband loved it!  He's always made this special chicken meal for me, and apparently, he did the same thing as this recipe!  Just looked for stuff around the apartment and rosemary, butter, and garlic worked!  Can't wait to try it on grilled steaks!  :-)

These were a little bit like a true religious experience.  Like some other reviewers, I also added corn starch to the remaining broth and made a gravy, and that's what sold it.  Make these.  You won't be disappointed.

The flavor on this was amazing!  I didn't have beef stock, so I used chicken.  After I pulled the pork I made a quick gravy with some cornstarch and water.  It was delicious.  I will definately make this again.

I was not impressed with the flavor of this dish at all.  I was disappointed.  I followed the directions exactly and it just had this off flavor. All my ingredients were fresh, so I'm not sure why it wasn't any good.

This recipe was so easy and the pork was very tender.  I used fresh rosemary and extra garlic.  I was surprised how good it turned out.

I have to say that this is the first time I used rosemary (I'm just learning how to cook with spices and herbs) and I used fresh rosemary instead.  I wasn't sure how this would taste because I wasn't thrilled with the smell of rosemary, but WOW - this was great!  I was on the treadmill while it was cooking and let me tell you the smell was a distraction!  It was so good that I had to stop myself from eating another pork chop!  The only thing I did different besides fresh rosemary was I used the spray butter instead of real butter to cut calories down & I used bone-in pork not boneless as that was what I had in the frig.  Thank you for a great recipe (not to mention the introduction to rosemary) that I will make all the time now!

These were GREAT! My fiance and I both loved them. I did make some changes. I had no rosemary, so I subbed italian herbs instead. I used beef bouillon, but as another reviewer said it was too salty this way, I skipped adding salt and also used 1 1/2 cups water to one bouillon cube. I also added a T of cornstarch at the end as suggested by other reviewers. Fabulous!

This is a keeper! All I changed was to use 2 cloves of garlic and I also had to add some extra water as the chops were simmering for 35 minutes as it had boiled down too much (my oven burner cooks very hot even on low). At the end, I added 1 TBS of corn starch to turn the broth into a gravy and then put that on top of the pork chops. Easy! Will be making this again.

Delicious!  I also added some cornstarch to the broth to make gravy. Will go a little lighter on the herbs next time. I was pleasantly surprised when my kids gobbled this up and one even asked for seconds!

The pork chops alone were extremely tasty and a great alternative to shake and bake, but I had to jazz it up just a little bit. Before I started cooking the pork chops, I boiled some chopped carrots until they were tender. Then I sauteed the carrots with sliced mushrooms and onions in some butter. When they were all cooked and the pork was about done, I added the veggies to the simmering chops for a couple of minutes. A perfect compliment to this already delicious and EASY meal!

I needed a new pork chop recipe that was fast and easy but also something that my 9 year old son would eat. He is tired of me making the same meat recipes and decided to become a vegetarian. So when I agreed to look for new recipes he agreed to eat meat again.
Thank you so much for sharing this as he ate a whole butterfly pork chop. I did alter it a bit only because I did not have all the exact ingredients. I seasoned them with a little oregano, garlic and black pepper. I rubbed the pork with these 3 and browned them in EVOO. I then added a can of beef broth and simmered. Was absolutely wonderful! Very moist and broke apart with a fork. I will definitely add this one to my favorite recipes!

Wow!  I'm not a huge pork fan, but these are fantastic and I will definitely save this recipe.  I used a whole 2 c can of broth and made gravy served over mashed cauliflower.  Rosemary garlic gravy? So good!!

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using fresh rosemary instead of dried. I read online that 1 Tablespoon of fresh is equivalent to 1 Teaspoon of dried so I used 2 Tablespoons of fresh.  

I was looking for a quick way to cook pork because I didn't have time to marinate it or bake it for a long time.  This was perfect for that and was super easy to make on the stove.  My boyfriend and I both enjoyed these a lot!

I should have browned my chops longer and used less liquid (I had doubled the chops so doubled the liquid - too much). Nice taste, thanks for sharing.

I think that I messed up on these, so they ended up kind of dry.  I used a thinner cut pork chop and don't think that I simmered them long enough (u set the heat too high) so they ended up kind of dry. They weren't over full of flavor but I served them with balsamic chopped onions and they were delicious.  I will try them again!

Not bad, not great, but then again, I'm not a fan of uncrushed rosemary, which is what I used. Highly recommend making the rosemary as small as possible! And easy on the pepper.

I added a pic ( 2 pork chops in a pan were a pound each) I didn't have any beef broth so I used chicken broth. and I don't like rosemary so I used garlic and onion and lots of pepper. So it was different bit delicious and the cooking method was great. Thanks!

I did it twice. First time was disappointing because spices were washed out while simmering. Second time I used the instant pot and kept the pork out of the broth. Also threw in some potatoes and carrots. Worked great!!  Ten minutes in pressure 4 minutes release for one and a half pounds.

I cheated and yes, I admit I cheated! After reading all the reviews, I added a can of Cream of Mushroom Soup and a packet of Pork Gravy  Mix from the Dollar Store at the end. I only did this because I made homemade southern biscuits and hubby loves gravy. OMG.....he ate 4 of the 6 pork chops I made. Even before I added the soup and gravy mix, these pork chops were heaven sent. Thank you for such an awesome recipe!

This was delicious!  I had 4 (thicker) boneless loin chops and trimmed all of the extra fat before cooking.  The only thing I changed in this recipe is that I used Extra Virgin Olive Oil instead of butter.   This is a new go-to dish.  Really tasty and very simple to prepare.  After adding the beef broth, I low-cooked the chops around 45-50 minutes and they were very tender.  I served this with steamed snap peas and a small serving of (previously prepared) "chili rice pot".  The chili rice pot dish contains a combination of 1 1/2-2 c. cooked brown rice, a can of organic tri-beans (pinto, black & kidney), a can of diced tomatoes (I used Hunt's Basil, Garlic & Oregano diced tomatoes) , 1 c. water,  and a  1/2 teaspoon each of chili powder and garlic powder.   This entire meal had a wonderful combination of complementary flavors.

I cooked 3 chops instead of 4 without altering the spices. There was far too much pepper for my liking. Next time I will use half as much pepper.

I made these for the first time last night. My package only consisted of 3 thick, boneless pork loin chops. Therefore, I decreased the amount of rosemary, salt and pepper. They were ready to eat in 35 minutes. My husband and I enjoyed them!

I didnt have any beef broth handy so I winged it with a 1/4 cup worcestershire and 3/4 cup water mixture. Followed the rest of the recipe and it came out excellent! Adding this to the weekly dinner routine.

This has becone one of my mainstay recipes! Everyone loves it,  and the smile on the wife's face when she comes home from work to the smell of the dish is priceless!  Not only did I discover the joys of beef stock, but of simmering as well! 

I went from a fried pork chop man, to a simmered pork chop man!

I followed the recipe exactly and the taste was really good, but I cooked it too long because I didn't have a meat thermometer so they were a bit dry, but very tender.  Next time I will cook for only 35 min on low.

I used half the amount of salt and pepper...and the amount of spices was just fine.  However, even though it simmered for 45 minutes in the broth, I found it a little dry.

Love this recipe. Before I tried this Pork Chops recipe the chops always turned out dry.  This is an easy recipe and the simmering is the trick for most Chops.  This has become my go to recipe!!!

This was very delicious. I didn't have any beef broth but I had a can of French Onion soup and I used that.  It was still very moist.

Great recipe! I love Rosemay! I didn't use any broth and instead of garlic cloves I used garlic powder. I just added a little bit of butter and water to my pan and let it simmer for 5mins on each side. I will have this for my family again!

The taste was good,  I left out the salt as there is salt enough for me in the added broth.

Family really liked this.  Only changes I made was using 1/2 cup beef broth and 1/2 cup of Marsala wine as it was by my stove. Do not go by cooking time as stove temps are different. Cooked each side for 3 min and then used a meat thermometer until it got to 145 degrees F which only took 20 minutes to gauge the doneness. 35-45 minutes would have dried out the meat. The juice in the pan was great over the pork as well as a baked potato.  dmoneil

This was VERY tasty!  I added a couple splashes of white wine prior to adding the beef broth and it came out wonderfully!  Thanks for sharing.

Oh. My. Gosh. So delicious! My variations: used an Italian Seasoning mix that contained rosemary (didn't have rosemary on its own), and I was successful with using broth made from beef bouillon - though I made sure to keep adding water as it boiled away. I also added about 1/3c. red wine to the broth. Will definitely be making this again.

Very tasty and makes a nice presentation (the rosemary stuck to the pork). only change I made was to double (2 cups) the broth.
