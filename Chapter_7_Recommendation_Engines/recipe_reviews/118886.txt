I thought this salmon was very tasty and easy.  I would definitely make it again.  I used Ritz crackers instead of the saltines and they worked fine.

Pretty good, I would add extra seasonings next time. I only had an electric broiler which wasn't working to well so, I ended up frying the breaded salmon steaks in a little EVOO. They came out crispy and perfect, just a few minutes on each side.

I enjoyed this recipe. I used UTZ Crab potato chips, Ritz crackers and whole salmon. I think next time I will put the salt and paprika on the salmon directly.

Based on other reviews, I used flavored potato chips (jalapeno) to add flavor to the whole recipe and skipped the paprika then. I added a mustard/honey/balsamic vinegrette to the top after baking. Delicious. Loved how the crust added texture to the salmon.

I was a little disappointed with this recipe. There wasn't much flavor--perhaps adding another spice other than paprika and salt would make a difference (and I used much more than a pinch of paprika, directly on the fish). Granted, I only used saltines instead of the combo with potato chips, but from the other reviews it seemed like that should not have made a difference in the overall taste. Note--be very careful in keeping the crust mixture directly on the fish as it broils. If any sits on the pan it will burn and make broiling the fish to perfection a bit painful because of the smelly smoke.
