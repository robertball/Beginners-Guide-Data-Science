As the creator of this recipe I just can't stop changing things! The zucchini I use is about 12 inches long, the size makes a big difference on the amount of stuffing you have. I just started using Morningstar Farms Burger style Grillers Veggie Recipe Crumbles (in a bag)in place of the sausage. Excellant! Also, even easier to throw everyting in a bowl, mix it and then stuff the zucchini. I cut out most of the salt too. Just sprinkled Season All on the squash before adding stuffing. Hope you enjoy!

Very tasty! I'm sure this is the best of the stuffed Zuc recipes on here.  Instead of Colby, cottage, and italian cheeses, I used about 1.5 cups of mozza and 1.5 cups of cheddar, and a few tablespoons of parmesan. Turned out perfectly.

great taste.  I modified it by slicing the zuchini and laying them in the bottom of a 13x9.  Then layered the other ingredients on top.  Could reduce the amount of sausage by half and not effect flavor.

I love stuffed zucchini recipes and this one looked really good and close to what I had on hand.  That being said I changed it so much I'm not even sure it's the same recipe but it inspired me!  Here's what I did and it was amazing: browned 1 lb sausage in a pan and set aside.  Sauteed half a red onion with 2 tsp italian seasonings and a shake of garlic salt.  When they were almost cooked I chopped up the inside of the zucchini that I scraped out and sauteed until soft.  I added about a cup of precooked brown wild rice, the sausage and about 1/2 cup chopped fresh cherry toms and cooked until heated.  I stirred in 1 cup shredded cheddar and filled the zucchini boats.  Then I grated parmesan on top and baked.  We had extra filling that I saved to use in omelets or something like that.

This was FANTASTIC!!!  I varied it by cooking the onion with the sausage.  Brought it to a party the 1st time I ever made it and everyone raved about it...then asked for the recipe!!!

I.ve no doubt this recipe will taste very good as it is baking as we speak. However, I read and reread the recipe as I found it strange that you could pop the zucchini in the microwave and cook it for 5 minutes with out piercing it or something...well I took you at your word. Needless to say there was no need to remove the seeds after cooling...the microwave took care of that when the end exploded off. Bit of a mess but next time I will pierce the vegetable even if it doesn't tell me to.  Live and learn.

we had a 21" zucchini that was 14" around and the stuffing was just the right. Had to use a huge roasting pan and cooked it about 5 min more.  It was terriffic and a real keeper.

I followed the recipe precisely, with the exception of using shredded mozzarella in place of the italian blend cheese.  It's a great combination of flavors with the zucchini.  My husband's only criticism was, "too much italian spices".  I agree - next time we'll cut that in half.

This was great! We didn't have cottage cheese so I just added a little bit more cheese and more tomato to make sure it wasn't dry.  I also wanted to use up what we had in our garden and added some green pepper it was a good addition.  My DH and both agreed you could have this for a late brunch also.  The only change was that our zuchinni was still crunchy so next time we are going to use young zuch's and chop them up and mix it all together to make more of a casserol.

A VERY GOOD dish.  With an overabundance of squash, this is my summer to have a Zucchini dish nearly every night!  We don't mind!  I made it exactly as the recipe called for.  No changes needed to be made.  I will make it again for my family.

Absolutely delicious!! I used two fairly large zucchini and over-stuffed them. It was the perfect amount. My husband enjoyed it also! Definitely a keeper!

This was wonderful!  I had squash in my garden, so that's what I used.  I only used one egg, and less cheese than the recipe called for.  I also used a can of italian diced tomatoes and added mushrooms, because that's what I had on hand.  I added brown rice to the sausage mixture.  This was to die for and I will make it again and again. My husband felt it was worthy of opening a bottle of wine.  Thanks for the idea!

First time trying stuffed zucchini- GREAT recipe! Only 4 out of 5 stars because of two small preferences. You don't need to pre-cook the zucchini in the microwave- add another 10-15 min. onto baking time (nuke it to about 450 degrees during that time) will make it perfect. It did not overcook or alter the stuffing at all. Granted, there was only two of us & we used half of a large zucchini (13"Lx4"Wx3"D) & that was enough for 2 of us, & a lunch left for tomorrow. (Plus, any leftover stuffing can be baked, too, perfect for a side or leftovers for breakfast w/ toast the following morning!)Hollow out a generous portion. Don't layer- mix ALL stuffing ingredients together- MUCH better! We also added in some of the "guts" of what we scraped out to the stuffing... SO good! Be generous with seasonings. Tofu or ground beef would also work very well in place of sausage. During the last 5-10 minutes (on broil), top with some bread crumbs & a bit more shredded cheese... PERFECT! A bit of marinara sauce is also quite a compliment for serving. This was an excellent recipe, & VERY good! Just adjust some things here & there to taste, I really recommend mixing all stuffing ingredients instead of layering... this will be a repeat in our house, especially with the fresh zucchini out of the garden! thank you! :)

Nothing great. Microwazing the zucchini is unnecessary! I did and it started to make sounds so I started to turn the zucchini every 30 seconds and after being in the microwaze for 3 minutes it exploded!!! Yeah! What a mess!! And the secound zucchini ( the one that I did not precook) was not that great. My boyfriend didnt care for the zucchini part and hes the zucchini lover. Wont be making it again. sorry

Delicious! I used breakfast sausage, mexican zucchini (they're fatter - more room for filling), omitted the cottage cheese because I didn't have any, cheddar/jack blend, and added mushrooms and a lot more onion. My kids complained about the zucchini until they tasted it, then had seconds and asked me to make it again. This time I'm adding a few bread crumbs to help soak up the juice.

It was weird how good this was.  Microwave a zucchini?  I am seriously microwave challenged, so I was pleasantly surprised when it actually worked without blowing up.  I made as written and my husband raved about it.  Even my toddler liked it!  It was even good for lunch leftovers the next day.  I used one 12" zucchini and there was some extra stuffing.  So I threw it on top of some frozen zucchini/yellow squash slices I had and made a separate casserole with it for the kidd-o.  Yum!

My family and I loved this!  In fact, they told me to throw away my other stuffed zucchini recipes!  Thanks for this yummy dish.  I also used a zucchini that was about 12" long.

I used 4 LARGE zucchini - almost 1 pound each - and the amount of filling came out perfectly.  There was so much food, it had to be baked in 2 dishes.

Needed something to punch up the flavor...maybe some Worcestershire.  Looked better than it tasted.  I'd attempt again with a few additions for more flavor.

YUM!  I made this the first time without having some of the ingredients, so I tweaked it by making spaghetti sauce (as if serving on noodles) and then followed the same directions for cooking the zuchini and it was so amazing that my 3 and 7 years olds couldn't get enough!  Thank you!

Made this lastnight. It was so good! Kids enjoyed it as well.  I layered the zuccini's ( lasagna style) since they were long and skinny. I used ground Italian Turkey sausage, and I also carmelized the onions. I food shop online so I thought I bought cottage cheese, but instead put in for Ricotta. SO I used it instead. To my surprise it was still very good. Next time I will try the cottage cheese.  Very good will make again, thank you!

We loved these, and the only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because while baking, most of the cheese topping runs off the zucchini and into the pan.  So before I broiled these, I scooped up the cheese mixture and then added some shredded cheddar cheese to the top.  Love the sausage flavor (and I even used turkey sausage), fresh tomatoes from my garden, and the gooey cheese.  Overall, this recipe is great.  I might try adding the cheese halfway through the baking process to prevent so much run off.

Made this for dinner tonight and we loved it. Used half ground beef and half sausage because that's what I had on hand.  Also added the onions to the meat while browning since my wife likes them carmelized. Very flavorful dish.  Thanks for a great recipe.

The first thing I did after I tested this new recipe was go to my recipe box, found my OLD stuffed zucchini recipe and tossed it!!  This is SO delicious.   If you only have grocery store sized zucchini at your disposal, buy about 4.   I got 2 and had a lot of extra filling materials.   So as not to waste it, I toasted some slices of italian bread, lined a small baking dish with them and then put on all the toppings that would have gone in the zucchini.   A very tasty improv as well.   This will definitely be a fun item for my next dinner party buffet table.

I've given 4 stars for my amended version. The original is too bland for my taste. I used less cheese and only parmesan. Mixed the well seasoned meat with cooked rice and a little fresh mint and basil.( you can also add pine nuts and soaked raisins) Trick is to use large Zucchini, do not pre cook season shell really well before placing filling inside. I add butter too. Wrap in foil and bake slowly. if you like the top brown broil at the end with extra cheese/breadcrumbs of your choosing.

The measurements on this recipe have were WAY off for my one zucchini. I made this recipe (with my own modifications, of course) and the taste was fine.

Very tasty, but how could you go wrong with sausage, cheese and zucchini? I think you could easily modify this recipe to fit your needs and it would still be delicious - I would say though that it needs to have sausage of some description (turkey or chicken) it helped to flavor the zucchini.

Very good recipe.  I couldn't find large enough zucchini to stuff, so I bought several smaller ones, and sliced and layered them lasagna style.  I also used Italian seasoned ground turkey and sauteed the onion while browning the ground turky.  I tried to cut calories by using non-fat cottage cheese and cutting down on the other cheeses.  I also used a full can of diced tomatoes (make sure you drain them).

I tried this when we had a bunch of garden zucchini that needed to be used, and I have to say it was just okay for me.  I liked the filling, but I really didn't think it meshed well with the zucchini.  My fiance really liked it, though so I gave it 4 - half way between my 3 and his 5!

This was an outstanding recipe and one of those dishes that tastes even better as a leftover. I didn't have any large zucchini from the garden this year so I had to do my best with what was available at the grocery store. I can imagine this dish would be better with larger/meatier zucchinis but I would not hesitate to make this again using a several smaller ones.  Anyone who is new to cooking or feels they are at a "beginner level" - You gotta give this dish a try. It's very simple and everyone that had tried it, loved it!!!  Thanks for the recipe

Excellent! I bought a 2lb zuke at the farmer's market and wasn't sure what to do with it until a friend suggested stuffing it. I found this recipe and voila! I'm vegetarian so instead of sausage I used about 1 1/2 C TVP reconstituted w/ 1C veggie broth (with 2T Bragg's). I then sauteed with the onions and two cloves of garlic and mixed in about 2T of my husband's homemade pasta sauce, just to give it some more flavor. It ended up meshing very well with the other flavors. Instead of the cheese listed I used what I had on hand -- 1 C cheddar, 1 C mozzarella, and 1/2 C fresh grated parmesan. It was so cheesy and delicious! The only thing I would do differently next time would be to broil it for only a couple of minutes. One of the zukes ended up  blackened on top, but it was still edible and still tasty.

I don't really like stuffed zucchini, but I loved this! Didn't have cottage cheese so subbed ricotta.  Couldn't find my measuring spoon so eyeballed the seasonings. This is an excellent, very flavorful recipe that we will have a lot!

This is a good recipe with lots of room to customize it. The zucchini at my local store are small so I buy several. I have found that these taste really well as leftovers. I used sausage the first time, however I prefer it without.

The cheese stuffing was 3 times too much for one 9x13 pan of 12" zucchini.  While it was o.k., I won't make it again as we didn't care very much for the flavor.

My 9 year-old loves zucchini, but my six year-old and I aren't fond of it, so I am always in search of ways to make it palatable for all of us. This recipe seemed like it would suit all three of us to a tee, and I was not disappointed. I made one minor change-I don't like cottage cheese in hot dishes, so I switched it for ricotta cheese-and I agree with another poster that there was too much Italian seasoning-I will half it next time. Otherwise, this recipe was delicious, and it will be making regular appearances on our table from now on.

Received a giant bat sized zucchini from a friend so decided to try this recipe. Delicious. Cooked onion and garlic with the venison sausage and then added the flesh scooped out of the zucchini to the pan and sauteed that for a bit too. Stirred in tomato sauce and the cheese and filled the boats. Cooked for 40 minutes at 350 then another 10 at 425. Thanks for a new keeper recipe.

This is amazing.  I did the sliced/layered version because I was afraid my kids would just eat the filling if I did stuffed.  Because of all of the fresh veggies, it was quite wet.  Next time I will make ahead & let the cooked version sit overnight.  Everyone had seconds & raved.  I think that the people who thought it was bland probably used a mild sausage.  I used one with a little more kick as well as fresh garlic, shredded, fresh carrots, and I did sautee the onions along with the meat.

tasty, very cheesy, but be careful as the amount of cheese mix to zucchini depends completely on the size of the zucchini.  Next time I will use less cheese mix!  For a low fat and calorie version I used turkey sausage, non fat cottage cheese, non fat cheddar shredded and low fat/salt swiss instead of the colby, italian cheese blend.  I also poked the zucchini before I microwaved it, just in case!!

I had high hopes for this recipe but wasn't quite as taken with it when eating it. I love the concept of pairing sausage and cheese with the zucchini. But in my opinion this recipe calls for way too much cheese for one large zucchini. And way too much sausage. There is no way for all of the ingredients to fit into or even on top of the zucchini without spilling onto the sides and turning into "baked cheese." My suggestions would be to cut the amount and variety of cheese by about two-thirds or so. The cheddar/marble cheese is best.. no need for Italian blended cheese. And I would omit the cottage cheese too. Bakes funny! I will try this recipe again and refine it and I'm sure it will be a winner.. not just as it's written now.

I thought this was okay.  With all the italian seasoning it tasted like a zucchini pizza.  For the size of zucchini I had, there was way too much cheese filling, so I froze the filling to be used with cooked rice to fill some stuffed bell peppers.

OMG, Love this!!!!  I changed only to cut calories. Used chicken sausage instead of sausage, 4 egg whites instead of 3 eggs, both cheeses I bought reduced fat cheese, fat free cottage cheese.  My husband just went in for seconds while I'm writing this. Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow for lunch!!! Thanks for sharing,

I made this for dinner last night and thought I'd have leftovers but we ate it all.  The zucchini I had were smaller and I cut the recipe down since it's just the two of us.  It was quick and easy and very tasty.  I did mix all the stuffing instead of layering it and then sprinkled additional cheese over the top.  I will make this again.

This is an EXCELLENT recipe!  I used turkey sausage and fat-free cottage cheese - don't tell the fam!  Not sure if I improved the nutritional value - but this tastes so good!  Thanks!

This was alright, but nothing special. The cheeses pretty much overpowered every other ingredient in the recipe. I think par-cooking it in the microwave made the zucchini too mushy. This recipe would probably work well if you're trying to hide vegetables in a meal for someone who doesn't like them. I do like vegetables, so I will not be making this recipe again. This ingredient combination, in my opinion, does not serve to accentuate the flavor/texture of zucchini.

Very tasty. I just used whatever cheeses I had on hand and it tasted fabulous. I used Elk sausage too. It is important to make the zucchini "boats" stable or everything tips out.  I even tried to make this into a cassarole by using all the same ingredients but grating the zukes. Next time I would drain the zukes better. Thanks for a great way to use my garden veggies.

This recipe is fantastic!  The taste combinations are great.  I've seen comments about adding less meat and I strongly disagree, but I come from a big meat eating family, so I may be biased!  The only thing I'd do different next time is I will make sure the zucchini is cooked enough before stuffing and baking (maybe 15 minutes instead of 10... every microwave's different ya know).  We will make this again.  I suggest you have a salad or veggie to go with it as it is quite rich!  Yum yum!

Sooooo good! Having said that I made some minor changes.  I microwaved only 3 minutes, but will go the full 5 next time.  I used all of the sausage, which fit nicely into my gigantic zucchini, but prepared only half the cheese mixture.  I couldn't have put another spoonful on if I wanted to, so half was the perfect amount.  When dinner was over I chopped it all up and ate it casserole-style the next day. Will definitely make this again!

Pretty good recipe.  I made a few changes that might have effected the dish for the worse. I used a relatively small zucchini (it fit into a 9x9 pan), so it got way overcooked and mushy.  I couldn't find any plain pork sausage near me (I live in a TINY town) so I got Italian sausage - like brat insides, which was very salty.  I think with the size of zuke I had, skipping the microwaving and baking for 20-30 min would have helped the mushy-ness.  Also, I would have cut the stuffing mixture in half.  Overall, very good, and will definately make again!

The family loved it! I used canned, diced italian tomatoes since I had them on hand, I used 1/2 the sausage and add 1/2 cup of bacon bits for variety. Will be cooking again. Thanks for sharing.

Excellent way to use up all that zucchini from the garden! I used lite Italian sausage & it was delicious. Making it for the 3rd time.The spices really souped it up. Nice as an entree or side.

I used hamburger instead of the sausage and it still turned out well.  I had a lot of extra filling even though I used a large zucchini.  There was probably enough to stuff 2 large zucchini.  I ended up baking the extra filling with the cheese on top in a casserole dish while the zucchini was baking.  It was so good my picky 9 year old admitted that he liked it.

My husband and I liked it. I'm not a fan of zucchini but this was good.  Hubby raved about it and had leftovers for lunch (which I got a big Thank You! text from him at lunchtime). My 18 yo. son liked the stuffing but not the zucchini. I did cut the Italian seasoning to 1 tbsp and it still had good flavor. I will make this again.

Awesome recipe. Loved it, but substituted mozzarella, cheddar and parmesan cheeses, and the top layer I spooned on marinara sauce and then sprinkled mozzarella and parmesan. Worked out great.

My family loved this dish! I would suggest cooking the zucchini in the microwave for about three minutes to start, so yours doesn't explode like mine did! I added three large crushed garlic cloves to the cheese mixture and actually used two large zucchini and still had more than enough sausage and cheese to fill both. This was a big hit!

Using exactly the amounts of ingredients suggested with a few minor cheese substitutions, this recipe made exactly enough stuffing for two (roughly 13") zucchini. Way too much for four people. I would suggest cutting it in half. Also cottage cheese is not a favorite of most kids. It doesn't seem integral, I would suggest something else more palatable. My zucchini was quite watery out of the micro and almost too soft, if you have a 1000 watt or higher, shorten the micro time. The taste is good but the zucchini was still not cooked all of the way through at the end of the cooking time.

This looks awesome.  But I would (even though I know it is higher caloric wise) would use ricotta vs. cottage cheese.  That would be the same as in italian diners.  Great ingredients for this recipe!

This is delicious. The only changes I made was I cut down on the amount of Italian seasoning,and I boiled my zucchini halves for a few minutes instead of microwaving them. It tastes a lot like lasagna. Yum!!

This was delicious and received rave reviews from my husband and kids! I added green pepper and garlic and cooked the pepper, garlic and onion with the sausage. I used 1 tbs of Italian seasoning and added some fresh herbs from the garden. Next time, I might add a 1/4 to 1/2 cup bread crumbs to firm up the stuffing a bit. Definitely Recipe Box worthy.

This was delicious! Tasted very similar to a lasagna. I didn't have a large zucchini so I used 4 medium/small zucchinis and sliced them up as another reviewer suggested. I then layered the sausage, tomatoes and cheese over them. My only criticism was that it was kind of watery at the bottom. It might help to squeeze the zucchini or pat them with paper towels prior to placing in the baking dish.

I halved the filling and had more than enough for what I thought was a large zucchini.  Very good way to mask zucchini since I don't really care for it :)

Very good! I used 1/2 beef & 1/2 pork ~ followed exactly except for the cheese part. I did not use the cottage cheese, instead I used about 1 cup cheddar & 1 cup pepper jack ~ freshly shredded & 1/4 cup parm.

Worth trying in the summer with all of the zucchini that's around!  I pertty much followed the recipe, except I skipped the cottage cheese, and instead of italian seasoning aI used dried oregano, some fresh basil, and dill.  It turned out great, and could have been a meal in itself but I used it as a side dish to go with chicken parmeseana.  Next time, I want to try with smaller zucchinis (I used one that was about 14in) because I think it may be better with a thinner zucchini.  GREAT recipe! Thanks

Oh my, oh my!!!  WOW, this was totally unexpected and amazing!!!  Couple of changes that I made - instead of microwaving the zucchini (used 4 regular grocery store sized), I boiled them along with the onion and italian seasoning.  I didn't have a tomato, so I used drained can of Rotel..  Also, I just used what cheese was on hand which happened to be a little bit of mozz, and the rest was a cheddar/ m-j mix.  Instead of buttering the dish, I just sprayed with Pam.  Once I got the cooled, drained zuch's in there, I sprinkled with both garlic salt and some onion powder.  I can not wait to eat the rest of this tomorrow..  I can already tell it is going to be one of those things that is WAY better the next day!!  Thanks again for an awesome new recipe.  Can't wait to make it more often!

This was a huge hit with my Low-Carb diet friends. I replaced the sausage with spicy Turkey sausage and followed everything else to a T. It was delicious!

I went looking for a "vegetable and cheese" dish, and this really exceeded my expectations! To make it lower calorie and lower fat, I used 2% Colby cheese, lowfat cottage cheese, and Italian turkey sausage. I also used 1 can of drained diced tomatoes with Italian seasoning. I also did not cook the zucchini first, and it was just fine, but I used three regular-sized store zucchinis, not huge home grown ones! I thought it was great!

Very good recipe...my husband loved it! I used canned diced tomatoes and I also cooked the onions along with the sausage. Also topped it off with a little extra Italian cheese before baking. Would recommend this recipe and I will definitely make again when zucchini season is back!

This meal was good, but I would've preferred it to be more 'saucy'.  I found the stuffing to be slightly dry; however the flavor was very good.  I agree that it doesn't need as much italian seasoning.  I used what I thought was a large zucchini but had twice as much stuffing as I needed.  I also felt that there was no need to microwave the zucchini before baking.  If at all, I would only put it in for a minute.  I microwaved mine for 3 minutes and it was too long, in my opinion.

I took the advice to slice the zucchini and lay it on the bottom of the baking dish and it worked well. I also used 1 1/2 lbs of sausage. I didn't have cottage cheese so I added extra shredded cheese. I will definately make this again.

amazingly delicious dish! i would recommend using a couple more zucchini (i used 4 medium sized and had about 1/2 of the filling left over), or plan on freezing 1/2 of the fillings for next time.

Way too much filling for only one zucchini. I used two large zucchini from the garden and still had additional filling for another one. Used sweet Italian sausage. Flavor was over the top. Even picky hubby ate his whole half. Great recipe.

We love this dish!  I always use Italian sausage vs. plain pork as it gives it more flavor.  But it is good either way.

My wife was out of town and I went to the garden and got some fresh Zucchini. My mom used to make the traditional stuffed Zucchini. I saw this recipe and it looked good. I went to the store and got $22.00 worth of ingredients. I made two half's using 1/3 of the stuffing. Loved it gave some to the neighbors to show them who the real cook is at my house. I came home and made two more half's for dinner the next day. I left town for the week with our house keeper staying here the week. I suggested she try the 1 1/2 left overs, there was none left when I returned Friday.
Thanks, We loved it!!

I love this recipe. The cottage cheese is what makes it moist. I don't precook my zucchini. I saute my sausage with the onion, add the spices. Take off heat and put in a bowl to cool. Slice zucchini in half lengthwise, scoop out the flesh(tossing many of the seeds) and saute that for a bit in the remaining oil in the pan. Add that to the meat in the bowl. Add the cheeses, I forgot the tomatoes the second time I made it (!) add the whisked eggs to the bowl and mix it up. Fill the squash and if I have extra, I add to oil sprayed ramekins. Bake for 45 minutes covered. The ramekins are like a quiche. So tasty. The squash is tender and the cottage cheese makes it so moist. Thank you for a simple, wonderful way to enjoy the giant zucchini you discover by accident!

This was a great meal and I made it mostly as described - I used a large zucchini my friend gave me, I used small eggs, and cut down on the cottage cheese and Italian cheese blend.......yet..... this recipe made an enormous amount of the meat stuffing and the cheese mixture.  I thought about it and decided to mix the leftover ingredients together and make some jalapeno poppers out of it.  Can't beat that.

I almost threw out a very overgrown zucchini in my garden. It was so big, i didn't know what to do with it til I found this recipe. Oh my, it was really tasty. I think you need more zucchini's for the amount of stuffing, but also note, overpile with the stuffing, especially if you don't dig out too much of the inside. There's not much room after just removing seeds, so be sure to stack the stuffing so you get enough goodness with every bite!

Since I had a really large zucchini, I sliced and layered it in 9x13" baking dish, mixed all of the other ingredients (except spaghetti sauce) and layered it on top of the sliced zucchini. Then I put the top with the sauce, covered the dish with foil and baked for 45 minutes. It turned out delicious! Next time I think I will chop the zucchini into bite-sized pieces and mix it in with all the other ingredients. This recipe is definitely a keeper - thanks for sharing!

I used regular-sized zucchini so microwaving for 5 minutes was too long. I prefer ricotta over cottage cheese and it really made the filling creamy. I used more cheese (always!) and the fresh tomatoes were outstanding, and I topped with parmesan before broiling at the end. This recipe filled 8 zucchini (would easily feed a family of 4-5) and was super-yummy. Served with cornbread muffins. I will definitely make this again!

The quantities of the components are totally off.  (1) There is way more cheese filling than needed (like 3x more!).
2) It is tasteless.  Bland, soggy.
3)  Why cottage cheese? Ricotta would have been a better choice.  And colby has no business being mixed with Italian cheeses. I followed the recipe exactly as stated.

This was very good.  Spiraled the zucchini at the bottom of the dish, and mixed all the other ingredients together and spread on top.  You'd never know there was zucchini in it.  Would be great for breakfast.

Great dish fantastic way to use the zucchini up from the garden. I made a few changes. I added half teaspoon cayenne pepper, substituted mozzarella for the two cheeses. I sliced the zucchini and layered it with the sausage mix in two layers end with sausage mix, then I covered it with 8oz of tomato sauce and sprinkled with Romano cheese baked for 40 minutes at 350 , raised temp to 450 for 10 minutes and finished with broiler for 10 minutes. Fantastic.

We loved this - the second time I made it, some of the cheese mixture sort of migrated into the pan - no worries, I just scooped it up on top of the peppers - I used a mix of Italian sausage, gr round - Nom, nom! And it also freezes well, cut in serving-size portions. (BIG zucchinis !)

This was excellent! I mixed the tomatoes into the sausage and then sliced the zucchini into rounds and layered it like a lasagna. My husband, 3 year old, and 1 year old all raved about it!

This recipe came out great! I ended up only using half of the cheese mixture because the it seemed like TONS and I also used ground beef (had it in the fridge already). Other then that it could use some garlic or something along those lines in the meat (something to try next time). Even my boyfriend who isn't a fan of "strange" vegetables like zucchini ate his whole piece and went back for more!

I've made this recipe several times and it turns out fabulous every time. I follow the recipe almost exactly EXCEPT I substitute ground turkey for the sausage however, I've made it both ways (I'm just not a huge sausage fan). I also put my zucchini in the microwave for a few minutes while I cook the stuffing. I recommend two very large zucchini's because this makes a lot of stuffing.

Basically the taste was good but not great. Perhaps my zucchini was too large but even though I followed the directions and nuked it and baked it, the skin was extremely tough. I ended up peeling off the skin.

I changed this recipe a lot because I didn't have all the ingredients, but it still came out wonderfully! I did not put cheese in the mix (only on top), didn't layer, added an extra egg, left out the cottage cheese, used Rotel, and used Italian link sausage. Honestly, you know a good recipe when you can change it so much and still have it come out wonderfully! My parents raved about it and the zucchini wasn't mushy. I added a small eggplant to the mix because it needed to be eaten and it just added an extra texture and went really well. I will certainly be making this again.

This recipe was so yummy, but i modified it to work with smaller zucchinis. I took 2 medium sized ones, sliced them long ways then layered the stuffing, meat and tomatoes about 3 layers high. It ended up like a zucchini lasangna, but it was delicious!

What a great way to use the large zucchinis and abundant tomatoes this time of year!  It was really easy to make.  I cooked the zucchini for 10 minutes instead of 5, since our microwave isn't the most powerful, and used the cheese I had on hand (mexican blend instead of colby and italian blend).  It was great!

I don't think I used big enough zucchinis.  I wasn't sure how big '1 large zucchini' was; the stores around here only have ones that were about 1.5-2" in diameter.  I got two, but still had way too much filling.  The flavor was very good, but I felt like I was eating spoonfuls of filling and not enough zucchini.  I'd love the try the recipe again with more zucchini though!

Excellent! I used 3 medium sized zucchini and had the perfect amount of filling. I used our favorite Italian sausage from the local butcher and only used 2 eggs. I think I might try it with only 1 egg next time actually. Sooo good. Thanks :)

Very yummy! I added more cheese to the recipe, cause we are cheese lovers. Also had a ton of the topping leftover and just threw it all on top of the zucchini - kinda making it a casserole. Because of the depth I had to bake it longer than expected (about an hour instead of the 40 min). But my husband and 18 month old LOVED it...had leftover whice were AWESOME for DAYS!

This dish is amazing! I had so many zucchini from my garden, we needed different ideas on how to use them up. I made this several times. I put extra filling in a separate casserole dish and baked it along with the zucchini. Awesome!

My family liked this recipe. Like many others who tried it, I thought there was an overabundance of filling. Also I think there may be a typo with the amount of Italian seasoning. I used 2 teaspoons, not 2 tablespoons, and it was still a lot, to me. Next time I make it, I'm going to use Italian sausage instead of regular sausage. I used half zucchini and half yellow crookneck summer squash--worked fine.

At a table of 5, only 1 person liked it. Because we grow zucchini's in our garden, I've been looking for a good stuffed zucchini recipe and will continue searching.  I think this one is just a bit too gooey & not to our taste.

This recipe is great, very flavorful.  I did add about 3 cloves of fresh pressed garlic to the cheese mixture but then omitted the garlic powder.  I think my zucchini must have been smaller than what was called for because I had enough of the fillings to make 3 zucchini halves, so I took some to my parents to try, they also loved it.  I have a good zucchini plant in the garden this year, will definately be making this again.  Thank you SABRAMARIE for posting this recipe.

This was excellent!  I used the Morningstar Farms Burger style Grillers Veggie Recipe Crumbles (in a bag)as suggested. The only problem I had is too much stuffing (if you consider that a problem). I just bought some more zucchinis the next day and made some more.  It filled a total of 7 zucchinis, which were the biggest ones my grocery store had.  My family loved them!

Very good.  I used a very large zucchini, and it was still too much stuffing (I cut it down too!).  I had to improvise bc I didn't have any cottage cheese or ricotta, so I subbed sour cream.  Unorthodox, I know, but it worked.  I like all the flavors but again, too much filling so I'd cut it at least in half next time. I also used about half the Italian seasoning, which was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this with some extra zucchini my boyfriends friend gave us... LOVE IT!!! The only thing I did differently was instead of the colby was use cheddar because it was what I had on hand and instead of fresh tomatoes, I used a can of diced tomatoes and drained them!  It came out GREAT!  He gave some to his friend and they LOVE it!  It's a HIT!! Thanks so much for a GREAT and EASY recipe!  :D  Happy from Rochster, NY

We enjoyed this.  It's a great way to use up zucchini.  I used what cheese I had on hand, mostly cheddar, and cut the microwave cooking time down to 3 minutes.  I'll make this again and recommend it to my friends.

This recipe is a keeper.  I did cook the zucchini before adding the filling.  To the sausage mixture, I added some tomato sauce.

Use one full pound of sausage and cut the cheese ingredients by half.  With four regular sized zucchini it will fill a 9x12 pan.  I agree that it is not necessary to microwave the zucchini first. Good idea to cook onions w/sausage. Made this last night and although delish--too much cheese filling.

The only reason I tried this recipe was because I had most of the ingredients on hand and needed to use them up. I was very pleasantly surprised at how good it was. I'll make this one again.

I actually made this with portabello mushrooms since I didn't have zucchini (which worked out well).  It was fine, but nothing special.

This was okay.  My husband enjoyed it, but I didn't care for the sausage with the zucchini.  Probably won't make it again, or will leave out the sausage.

This was really good and rich as a special treat.  I used a huge squash that was stupid because the filling was so good it would have been even better in a little squash with a lighter flavor.  I am sorry I wasted it I will make it again with the right squash.
