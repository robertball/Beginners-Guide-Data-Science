Made this recipe for my kids last night and they were a hit! I did have to add more milk as it was a bit thick and I also added more sugar to make the batter a bit sweeter. With that they turned out just like the funnel cakes you get at the fairs/carnivals, etc! They were delicious and very easy to make.

I made these for myself, my husband & 3 year old as a treat. They were so good & easy to make!! I made mine in a deep skillet. I modified & used a cup of milk instead of 2/3 cup, 4 tablespoons of sugar instead of 2 & they turned out perfectly :) Love it & I will definitely make these again.

I made this as written, and thought it was flavorless.  The milk does need another 1/4 c or so to get the right consistency.  I would double the salt, sugar, and add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  I halved the recipe and ended up with 4 medium sized cakes.

Great recipe, used 3/4 cups of milk instead of 2/3s. Worked Great, not going to spend the money at the carnival anymore for Funnel Cake.

I had some fresh strawberries to use up so I decided to top some funnel cakes with them. I made a small alteration to the recipe and added vanilla to the batter. I poured the batter in a piping bag and added it to the oil. I sprinkled powdered sugar on some of the cakes and I also made up a powdered suger glaze to top the rest.

I always read the reviews and adjust from there, so i added more sugar and cinnamon. They turned out very good.. i put a half cup of batter in a zip-lock sandwich bag and cut a small hole in the corner to spread the batter instead of a funnel.

I have made this recipe 6 times now with no changes. I love the recipe size; it serves my family of 3 exactly- one each for the ladies and two for the hungry man.  I added a shake of cinnamon to the last batch and was quite pleased.  These are extra special served with a fruit compote in the center and topped with whipped cream.  So far, I've used strawberries, pineapple, raspberries or cooked apples. This is a popular treat for our family. I forgot to sift my flour one time before I measured it and the batter ended up too stiff.  I simply added about 1/3-1/2 cup additional milk and a dash more baking powder and they came out great. It must be a very forgiving recipe!  If you happen to have an 8" cast iron skillet, it's the  perfect size for frying these.  It only takes about 1 cup of oil, as opposed to the quart of oil called for in the recipe. Thanks for sharing Luv2Shop!

It was alright.  The batter was a little thick and could have been a little sweeter, so for future reference add more sugar and a little more milk.

Funnel cakes didn't stick together so it was like individual strands.  Had to add a LOT of extra milk to even make it flow-able.  Seemed too dense, and salty.  There are much better recipes.

I used this recipe to make deep fried zucchini.  It was wonderful.  I did have to add some more milk because the batter was thick like others had said, but other than that I thought it was perfect.  I kept the sugar content the same since I was putting it on veggies, but even if I wasn't I liked the way it was and wouldn't change it even if I was doing the funnel cakes!

Great recipe, I actually make zeppoles instead by dropping spoon fulls of the batter into the oil and then tossing them in a bag of powdered sugar. It's a simple recipe with things I always have on hand at home.

I used Vanilla Almond Milk instead of regular milk and added more since I got the 'thick' problem as well. It also helped to sweeten the funnel cake. I used 3-4 tbs of sugar too....

As written, which is the recipe people SHOULD be rating, this is just a two star at best. As noted by even those who rate it 4-5 it needs more milk, more sugar and cinnamon. As written it is too thick, and pretty tasteless.

sooo good and easy to make.
Followed some suggstions and added cinnamon which I think elevated the flavour.
Served with strawberry syrup, fresh cut strawberries, vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. It was a HIT!

I like this recipe because it has sugar as an added ingredient and its enough for 5 mini-regular sized funnel cakes.  I suggest adding vanilla and we preferred them crispy.

I increased milk to one cup and doubled the sugar.  Topped with fresh strawberries and powdered sugar.   Would definitely make it again with the changes.

I always put vanilla in my batter. I found that this was way too bland and the vanilla really gives it the flavor of the fair, I think. Just a suggestion that works well for us!!

Just a question, could you use a small fry daddy instead of the skillet to make these?  I intend to make them with my grandkids - sound delicious! Thanks!  Linda

I can't believe how easy it was to make funnel cakes!! No more waiting for the county fair to eat one. I can make them right at home. I followed the suggestions of others and added more milk so it wasn't as thick. Also added 4 tablespoons of sugar. Topped them with powdered sugar and Supreme Strawberry Topping from Allrecipes a well.

I followed the directions step by step.  The batter was too thick, and it had no taste. Let's just say it ended up in the garbage. What a waste of ingredients. I wouldn't recommend this recipe...try another.

The recipe was really great but I did tweak it just a little.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, just enough for my taste, not overpowering.  I added a little water to make it pour easier.  I didn't measure, but it may have been 2 - 3 teaspoons.

I went with a carnival themed birthday for my toddler and needed carnival food. What's a carnival without funnel cakes or as we call them, elephant ears. THESE WERE A HUGE HIT!!! I couldn't make these fast enough for all the people at the party! I made this recipe as is and had no trouble the day of the party trying this for the first time. Easy, simple, and oh so delicious!

I made one bout a week ago they were to die for had to add more granulated sugar for batter but I will not be spending money going to the carnivals or fairs and will not wait when I can make it myself.

I added 2 tsp of lemon extract to the mixed batter, and it gave them a light lemony flavor, very tasty! This recipe was great, very simple!

What most are saying, mix is too thick. I added water to mine and a touch of vanilla extract. Best funnel I have ever eaten.

The best funnel cake recipe we've found! My family loves them, though for all of us we have to double or even triple it.

This recipe needs a lot of milk versus the small amount it shows. I modified mine to be more liquidity so that I'm able to spread it all over like the funnel cake I buy at fairs. I'm assuming they mixed up the amount of flours and milk. When I followed the recipe exactly it was way too thick. After modification it was wonderful. Thanks.

Family loved it! Came out great with 1 cup of milk and with 4 tablespoons of sugar instead of what's called for.

Tasted great.  After reading the reviews, I add a bit more sugar (we love sweet things) and a bit more milk.  
This recipe made 4 large funnel cakes.  Doubling recipe next time.  Thx

Added 1/4 more milk. And couple tablespoons cinnamon & sugar mixture. Came out yummy!! I placed batter in a ziplock bag and cut hole in corner and drizzled out batter from their. Worked really well!! I found that the part that was thinner and got crispier(not burnt) was yummiest more so than the thick cake like parts. Also sprinkled pondered sugar on top and bottom as well as another cinnamon sugar mixture!! Satisfied my late night fair craving quick!! Forgot to take a pic before I pigged out lol
