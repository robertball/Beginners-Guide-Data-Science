While I wouldn't call this "a different angle on an old veggie" as the submitter describes, it doesn't take away from the fact that this is just plain simple and good. No need to measure, just saute the squash in butter as needed, add salt, pepper and dill to your taste. I cooked this, however, at medium-high heat, not the medium-low as the recipe directs. Saute as long as necessary to achieve a crisp-tender doneness, not till it's soggy and mushy, which can easily happen with summer squash. Great fresh flavors with just a few simple ingredients - what's not to like?

  2 garlic cloves (minced) sauted w/ the zucchini & squash,  1.5 tsp dill,   cut back on butter & used some olive oil instead

This is a versatile recipe.  You can change it anyway you like.  I used fresh lemon for the lemon juice and did it give it a kick.  Also, I used fresh dill weed.  During the summer months I will vary it some more.  Experiment - it's fun!

One of my favorite ways to have summer squash.  I've been making it for years.  I cook this in layers....first carrots cut on the diagonal, then yellow squash, zucchini, maybe some green peppers, and then mushrooms, shaking dill between each layer.  Drizzle some olive oil on top, lots of garlic and about a tablespoon of butter.  Cover tightly and just let it cook very slowly, around 20 mins or so, depending on the amount you're cooking and how tender you like your vegies.  No need to stir.  We also like to put it on top of our fresh pasta.  So good!!!

This was so good.  My 8 yr old and husband both liked it.  I think with the amount of butter and dill, you might need to add a few more squash to the recipe.  Delicious.

A wonderful way to let the vegetable taste shine through without all that cheesy goop you usually find on squash! I made this with 3 16-ounce bags of frozen yellow squash. I got many compliments. Everyone thought it was fresh squash. Will make this again and again.

I didn't have high hopes for this recipe seeing as dill isn't my favorite spice (herb?) but I had all of the ingredients, including squash that needed to be cooked ASAP, and it looked easy enough.  Boy am I glad that I tried it because it was really good.  Next time I'll try to lessen the amount of butter I use but I will definitely be making this again.

This was easy and the taste was ok--but not particularly something to boast about.  Too much butter.  Think the next time I prepare I will half the butter and garnish with some freshly grated parmesan cheese.

This was an EXCELLENT recipe- great for the summer as its quick and light and a great way to use up summer squash. I opted for the fresh dill and I would reccomend it this way. Also, I added some asparagus to it. It helped make this "side dish" into a Main course I served over Garlic Cous cous. Very good, thank you!

This is really good, quick and simple.  I cut the butter in half and added some butter flavored cooking spray.  I love dill so it was not to much for me. This will be a regular at my house.

I have been fixing my squash almost this way for years. The only thing I do differently is cover the saucepan and call it butter-steamed. Onion and garlic are a must and thyme or basil also works well as a change from the dill.

I was looking for a simple way to enjoy fresh summer squash and this recipe delivered! For more flavor I added two cloves of minced garlic. Delish. If I made it again I would cut a large squash into half-rounds since that's easier to move around the pan for saute. The large rounds I cut did not all get evenly cooked. I like the touch of lemon so next time I think I'd add some lemon slices and a sprig of fresh dill to garnish. To experiment I would also try adding a little white wine to the recipe. And a pinch of sugar.

I was suprised by how much I loved this recipe. The lemon and dill really add a brightness to the squash. I used 2 Tbsp. butter and 1 Tbsp. olive oil. I cooked it at a higher heat for a shorter time so the squash wouldn't get soggy. I also used 1 tsp. dill weed and about 1/4 tsp. each salt and pepper.

Very good. I took other suggestions and added lots of chopped garlic and I did add a chopped red onion. I did not use any butter but rather sauteed all in 2Tbs olive oil to keep it lighter. Did use a whole bunch of fresh dill and sprinkled the top w/a little parmesan cheese. Delicious "weight watchers" version.

Yummy! I never thought to use dill with squash, but it's a wonderful taste. I did not have lemon juice though, but still good.

My husband & I like this, but not my son. I reduced the butter to 3 T. & the dill to 1 t. This is good for low-carb.

I loved this recipe. Someone had given me some yellow squash and zucchini and I came across this recipe. It was super easy and just what I was looking for. The flavor was very nice. Went well with my Turkey/Quinoa meatloaf. Thank you!

Yum. Excellent squash. I used all yellow squash (frozen) and cooked it over med-hi heat. The dill went well with the squash and I couldn't tell the lemon juice was in there. We'll definitely have this again. Thanks Sally.

Hey these were really really good!  I just used yellow squash and kind of eyed the butter and threw in a little bit of garlic.  The whole family enjoyed.

I put a big twist on this one and it was out of this world! I sauteed a large onion, minced garlic and minced ginger in a combination of butter and olive oil.  Then, added 4 zucchini and 4 yellow squash, covered and simmered for 10-15 minutes. I then added Lemon Essential Oil, fresh Rosemary, dill weed, freshly ground peppercorn, ground sea salt and a little lemon pepper for good measure and simmered another 5-7 mins.  It was so delectable that I, a 5'7" size 4 woman, ate the entire dish with the exception of 1 cup I saved in case my son wanted some when he returned home later. :)

Very yummy side dish!  I halved this recipe as I was cooking dinner just for my husband and I.  Next time I will cut down the butter a bit more.  At first I thought it would be too much dill, but it is wonderful with the lemon juice and the veggies.  I will definitely make this again!

What a great and easy summer recipe.  We used it as a vegetable dish for a summer bbq and it was loved by all.

Followed the recipe exactly.  Kids really didnt like it.  More lemon helped a bit, but I'm still looking for that great squash recipe!

I substituted olive oil for the butter to make it healthier.  Despite using only 1 teaspoon of dill, the dill taste was quite prominent.  You need to really love dill to appreciate this recipe.

This is the way I usually cook my zucchini but I don't use the lemon juice and must try it! I never measure anything since squash comes in many sizes, just add enough butter to saute and sprinkle with salt, pepper and dill weed. So easy and very tastey! Thanks Sally

Classic recipe!  A little too much butter, though.  Will have to try with garlic next time, as another reviewer suggests.

Simple and good. I cut down the butter to 3 tbsp instead of 4, I didn’t feel like it was missing anything.

This is am easy dish to. make if you are in a hurry.  It doesn't require anything that would not normally be in your pantry..   It is fairly healthy also.  The flavor is so-so.  Somewhat bland for my family but you get your veggies in.

Made it just as described. I've always struggled to find a squash recipe that my husband and I both liked. This one delivered. And it's easy and you likely have all the ingredients. Yep, it's a winner.

I sauté zucchini and squash as a side dish quite often since I love it and my boyfriend will eat it, unlike with many other vegetables. This made for the perfect variation. I enjoyed the dill and will make this again. I did use some garlic when sautéing because we love garlic so much. I doubled the recipe for leftovers and used approximately 4 large diced garlic cloves.

we both liked this but felt it was a little heavy on the butter.. bf said he'd like to see more lemon so i quadrupled the amount.. it was much improved.. we got to talking and figured it would be better if we could marinate this and then put it on the grill.. we like our veggies a little on the firmer side so less cooking time would be optimal.. the dill was spot on.. ty for the recipe

I came across this recipe less than a month ago, and have already made it twice - it's a delicious!  The second time I made it, I julienned the zucchini and squash rather than slicing it (so that it would cook a little faster).  As some other reviewers have said, it's a lot of butter, so I added an additional big zucchini to the mix, which is the only adjustment I made.  And when I removed it from the pan, I cooked some tilapia in the butter/dill mix that remained - it was more than enough.  I served it with Far East garlic couscous - the whole meal took about 20 minutes from start to finish.  I will make this again and again - maybe next time I will try it with a mix of EVOO and butter to make it even healthier. I really love this recipe!

SO delicious!! The lemon juice worked wonderfully here! I added a little crushed jarred garlic and a bit of water because the veggies were browning too much for my taste. I cut back on the cooking times also because I wanted crisper veggies. Topped with some parmesan cheese. Tastes like the flavors of spring...so fresh! Thanks Sally for the great recipe!  UPDATE: Kept heat med-low and no water needed. Great dish!
