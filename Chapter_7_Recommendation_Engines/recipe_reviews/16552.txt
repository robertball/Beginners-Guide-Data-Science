I was just served this wonderful "mock" pate at a christmas party, and really was impressed. I would serve this to anyone and know it will be enjoyed. The texture, seasoning and color all suggest a true pate.

I have made this pate for my birthday party. My boyfriend was really sceptical when he heard the ingredients (very plain), but he was quite pleased when he tried it. It is really delitious. I used it as a dip and it was a hit. Congratulations to Sandy for submitting great recipe.

This pate was enjoyed by all at a dinner party that my sister gave.  It is so delicious.  The texture and taste is beyond incredible.  I can't wait to make it for my guests someday.  I also plan on using it as a filling for our work lunches.  Thank you!!!!!!!

Easy to make and very tasty, but plain.  I added 1/2 teasp hot sauce and 1 TB lemon juice which jazzed it up.  Will definitely make it again!

this started off as a disaster - I used jacob's cream crackers and adding these proportions created a crumbly mess.

But I managed to save it by adding twice as many peas, some soy sauce and red wine - all of which contributed to getting the texture I wanted. Then it went down very very well with some interesting flavours going on.

You will not believe the flavor's until you're made this...  I only used 10 crackers as they were the fluffy ones, seemed to work well.

DELICIOUS!!!!!  I love onions so I add a bit more onions, but this recipe is great.  I want to also try this , but with lentils or green beans.

We didn't really like it. The texture was not too appealing, and it was pretty plain. But it was easy to make, and nutricious. If served with lots of other tasty dishes, it might be ok.

This is really good. Wasnâ€™t sure what to serve it on though. Ended up cutting cherry tomatoes in half and filling them. Looks great and tastes good. I used frozen peas which I covered in boiling water for 5 min. Next time I might try it with canned lentils.
