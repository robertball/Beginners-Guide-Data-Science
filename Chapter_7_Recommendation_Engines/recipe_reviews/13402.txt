This is a very good and filling soup, even the way I made it:
I needed to use my slow cooker, so I had to reduce the tomatoes and zucchini a bit otherwise it wouldn't have all fitted in. I browned the meat/pepper/onion first and put it on top of the chopped veges in the s/c pot. I used beef stock instead of soup mix. I also omitted the pasta because (a) there was no room and (b) pasta doesn't really work in a slow cooker soup unless you add it near the end.
It was scrumptious and I will definitely make it again, probably reducing the amount so I can use the right proportion of ingredients.

Excellent "dinner" soup ... thick and stew-like.  I used diced canned tomatoes since we're beyond fresh tomato season and yellow and zucchini squash for eye appeal.  I also like to use several different types of pasta ... again for interest.  Easy to make and I only used 1 pound of LEAN ground beef.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

WOW!!!  What a delicious, filling soup.  I made this for my family a year ago and it has become a regular.  I freeze my garden tomatoes and zucchini in the Fall when I have an abundance and enjoy their fresh taste all Winter long with this recipe.  We add two cans of tomatoe sauce to make the broth creamier and a can a sliced mushrooms.  When we serve the soup we sprinkle grated cheese over the top and have homemade bread.  I have also made this soup using shredded leftover roast beef instead of hamburger.  I would highly recommend this soup to anyyone!!  So simple and so good.

Absolutely fantastic.  It was easy and very tasty indeed.  I didn't have beef and onion soup available to me however and just used beef soup with some extra onions.  A real find, thankyou.

my 8 year old daughter said i should give this "as many stars as you can!"  she loved it so much she wants it for lunch tomorrow too.  also, i put a little bit in my food grinder and fed it to my 12 month old, who loved it as well.  i had to make some substitutions according to what i had on hand:  i used a large can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh (i only did 1/3 of the recipe); i used a couple teaspoons of beef bouillon instead of the soup mix (i think the soup mix would make it too salty anyway); i used one zucchini and one yellow squash; i used minced garlic instead of powder;  i used frozen chopped green peppers.  we topped it with a little shredded cheddar.  it turned out delish and it was quick and easy to make.  a keeper for me!

This was an excellent, seasonal soup. I loved how easy it was to make, and was surprised at how quickly everything cooked. I used ground turkey instead of beef to keep it light and healthy (however the soup was very fulfilling), and maybe added just a tad more of the seasonings and herbs, just because I love them. But overall, I pretty much kept the recipe the same (except for the meat substitution), and my boyfriend and I were very pleased. Oh, and, I didn't take one other person's suggestion and added freshly grated parmesan cheese on top after dishing each bowl.....because that's yummy too.

I liked this recipe; however my husband wasn't as impressed.  I made it in the crock pot, which caused the pre-cooked noodles to really disintegrate ( I hadn't cooked them all the way but they still couldn't stand up to long-term cooking).  Wasn't sure if 2 cups of pasta was 2 COOKED cups or two uncooked???

Almost doubled the onion (had homegrown sweet), used 1/2 commercial canned no-salt added tomatoes and 1/2 homemade tomato sauce from the freezer, added a bit of extra oregano and a LOT more garlic (several minced cloves of fresh, plus almost all of the powder).  Never added any salt, and it did not need any.  Added some fresh sliced  mushrooms close to the end of the cooking time, and they went well in this.  I used cavatappi for the pasta, and it took too long to cook.  By the time it was soft, the zucchini was almost overdone.  Next time I would add the pasta a bit before the zucchini, even if I use elbow macs.  Sprinkled on Parmesan just before serving.  Very yummy.

I should have sauted the meat with garlic as there was hardly any flavor to this.  We added parmesean once it was served and that made it more flavorful.

Pleasant surprise. Not much of a tomato/zucchini fan, not sure what prompted me to make this. But I did, and it was a pleasant surprise! I was afraid of it being too tomato-y tasting, but it's not so! 

Not sure 4 c. of water is enough- there wasn't much liquid during and after cooking. I couldn't tell when the soup started to boil because there was just so much vegetable in the pot. This is a REALLY HEARTY STEW. I only added 1 lb of g. turkey, 3 lbs of macaroni. The dang soup wouldn't boil even after quite some time on high, so I just threw in the cooked turkey and macaroni and simmered and stirred till the noodles were cooked and onions softened..

This soup is SO good!  I took the advice of another reviewer and added a can of tomato sauce.  I also substituted ground turkey for the ground beef.  We sprinkled shredded parmesan cheese on top.  Delicious!!!

Great Soup. I halved the recipie and used beef broth instead of the water but added another 4 cups of broth after the macaroni had cooked so there was more broth. Kids loved it!

I used beef broth in place of the water, used 3 cloves of garlic minced, no salt, only 2 zucchinis and added them last, and a can of tomatoe  sauce. I fed the teachers at my school and they all loved it and wanted the recipe. Will make again for sure.

Great comfort meal! Added Greek seasoning, since didn't have garlic powder, omitted other spices. Used Cherokee heirloom tomatoes.  Added little more noodles, so didn't have alot of soup.  Can't wait on leftovers tomorrow.

More stars if you are a squash fan.  I halved it and still could have done with less meat.  Fresh parmesan makes it.
