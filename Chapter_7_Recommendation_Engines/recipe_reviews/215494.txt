A fun salad with lots of unusual flavors. I used plums instead of persimmon (since I didn't have persimmon on hand), and I couldn't taste the plums, so don't repeat my mistake. Other than that, it was an easy, delicious salad.

I made this for a group of friends tonight, and it received rave reviews. I doubled the recipe, and had to use green onions because my grocery store didn't have shallots. Otherwise, I made it exactly as written. It was a huge hit.

This is a wonderful way to enjoy raw persimmon and get all the great enzymes from fresh fruit and vegetables. To make it a complete meal I added left over roasted chicken and topped it with feta cheese instead of Parmesan. Even my two year old loved it!

I used Mango in place of the persimmon and feta instead of thE Parmesan.  It was a big hit!  Will definitely make it again when my fresh pears are ripe next fall.

Wonderful salad. Used Fuji persimmons which are firmer and crisper than than the other persimmons which are used in jams and baked goods. Dressing was a bit lemony so I added more oil.

I love arugula, but added some other lettuces that I had on hand.  I couldn't find persimmons, but added avocado to pear,.  The dressing was just right.

Very nice recipe. I added chicken to make it an entree, but didn't make any other changes. I received a permisson (or rather a persimmon) for my birthday and didn't know what to do with it. Thank you, Leesean.

I just made this for a group of 20.  I substituted mangos for the persimmons as they were not in season yet here in Montana.  It was a hit, everyone loved it.  I forgot the cheese at the end but it wasn't missed.  I also used less dressing overall and less shallots as I was crying too much from the mincing! I toasted the walnuts myself so that they were warm too.  (I also didn't bother with the salt/pepper)
