Very tasty and much easier to make than the traditional mojito.  I put the mint in the blender first and had no problems with needing to strain the leaves - they became miniscule fragments!  These are great when it's hot outside - refreshing, sweet, and powerful!

My family has been using a slight variation on this recipe (although we call it a Mint Daiquiri) for over three decades: 6 oz. each limeade & rum, spoonful of sugar & ice, all pulsed many, many times in the blender to ensure creamy smoothness. Can't be beat on hot summer evenings.  Always a crowd pleaser.  Omit the mint, and sub tequila for the rum and you have an equally pleasing margarita.

I may have done something wrong (given the number of really positive reviews), but the recipe calls for a 6 oz can of frozen limeade concentrate. Because the typical frozen limeade concentrate can is 12 oz, I doubled the rum from 8 to 16 (1.5 fluid oz each: so 24 fluid oz total) which turned out to be WAY too much rum. Because it wasn't really drinkable, I put it in the freezer and am going to blend it all again with another can of limeade.

A jigger is usually 1.5 ounces.  So if this calls for 8 jiggers that is 12 ounces (or two six ounce juice cans) of rum.  Adjust to your taste.

This is a great recipe!  I also just put the mint in the blender with everything else...no problem.  I put the leftovers (when there are some) in a bowl in the freezer.  Then all I have to do is scoop out some the next time!

I don't know why but somehow did'nt taste very good. The mint leaves had to be strained perhaps.

These are wonderful!  Nice and refreshing on hot days and is much easier to prepare than regular mojito's when serving a large group.

This was delicious, definitely my new favorite cocktail. I used a 12oz can of limeade concentrate and 8 jiggers of rum and added a splash of lemon/lime soda after I had poured it into the glasses.

Yum. I used the whole 12 oz can of limeade and kept the rum the same. Everyone loved it even my husband who normally doesn't like sweet drinks. He loved this one. He said it was the mint.

I love mojitos and was delighted to try these out.  My main problem with this recipe was that it was missing the sweet, minty flavor a true mojito has.  The drink was too limey and not enough sweet.

I just made this and it's delicious. I used the container of limeade but then 1 cup of mint leaves & I measured 1 c of Rum & you couldn't taste it so poured a little more in the blender...probably 1/3 c more. Ha. VERY tasty.  I added ice and blended until I liked the consistancy...the 'batch' I made filled the blender container to the top & I filled 3 of large margarita glasses (from Pier 1 if that is descriptive enough). Topped them with a sprig of mint & a lime wedge. Wonderful! Thank you Cristionas. :-)

I found it a little too sweet so next time will probably only use half the can of limeade. Otherwise these were very tasty!

Loved it!! Added a little less rum and a little lime flavored seltzer. Very good.
Drank with a straw to avoid mint leaves.

I have been making this recipe for several years.  They have become my signature drink.  My frozen mojitos have been so enjoyed that we now have "Mojito Sunday" at the pool as often as possible.  Hate to see the summer coming to a close...

Just a response to Abi G ... the original recipe calls for 1.5 ounces of rum TOTAL, so when you doubled it you should have used only 3 ounces (not 24). That probably explains why it was so rummy! I hope that helps for next time. I found this recipe to be very good. I prefer using fresh lime juice and sugar, but you can't beat the quickness and ease of frozen limeade. What a great idea! A splash of soda water is also good.

This is such an absolutely delicious recipe! And so easy too.
I put the ice, mint, limeade, and rum all together and it was transformed into a fantastically sweet and refreshing drink. I made this for my boyfriend after he had a long day at work and he spent the evening worshiping my cooking skills. 
This is a wonderful alternative to a traditional mojito.
Even better, I would say, and I should know...my family is Cuban!

I love this recipe.  I usually put the mint leaves and rum in blender 1st, then strain out leaves if they don't get mixed up enough.  Put back in blender and add rest of ingredients.  Sometimes I add a little simple syrup to taste, if I don't have any on hand you can use powdered sugar.

My husband and I had our first Mojito in Key West and it was the best!  We have been looking for a Mojito recipe and this is it - it is the best!!!  We found a couple recipes and tried them all one night to compare and this one won by far.  It is super easy.

A nice simple recipe for a yummy drink.  My personal tastes run to a little more sugar, less lime, and a bit more mint.  It's easy to mix to taste and makes a great frozen drink.

Good recipe for an easy mojito. I would add a bit more ice. I blend the rum, limeaid, and ice first and then add the mint. That way, the mint is in large chunks, like most mojitos I've gotten at restaurants.

I made this once with regular limeaid (not frozen) when my sister brought the wrong kind over. It was decent, but very watery.

These are awesome! Very refreshing on a very hot evening. Anytime I go over to my friend's house, her husband wants me to make these.

We thought this was really good... even if it is not a true Mojito.  More like a mint-lime daquiri, says my husband.

This was cool and refreshing, and I liked the mint bits but my friend said she prefers when the leaves are just muddled at the bottom. Oh well!

They were good but we felt there was toomuch mint. I put all into the blender. They mint was very fresh, just picked, don't know if that made a difference

Being from Texas, maybe our taste buds are different?  I made for a party of 16 and no-one liked.  I checked the recipe, made another batch and it turned out the same way.  We love mojitos, but this is not authentic at all.

Really quick and easy, but too sweet for my taste. I topped it with a little club soda in the glass.

I love how easy these are to make, plus they taste delicious!  My daughter-in-law doesn't care for "pulpy" stuff in her drinks, but the mint blends up fine enough that she loved them, too.

delish!  I liked blending in the mint leaves....could use straws but didn't seem to need to. Moderately strong!  could have been weaker for me, but probably just right for others.
