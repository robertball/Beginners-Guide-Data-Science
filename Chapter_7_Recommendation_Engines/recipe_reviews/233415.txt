Simple indeed and as written I give it 4 stars. The flavor from the cucumber and zucchini came through nicely but I still felt it was lacking some herbs or seasonings. I ended up adding some dill a dash of cayenne and a dash of salt and this took it from a 4 to a 5.

Made this soup today and stuck to the recipe...until I tasted it. The flavor was very zucchini and I wanted to tone that taste down a little. Added some paprika oregano basil and a couple dollops of sour cream. Much better.

Made this today to use some fresh cuke and zuke from the farmer's market. Used some green onion I had too. Yes needs some herbs and seasoning; dill salt and pepper and cayenne like the previous reviewer. Also gave it a shot of Frank's Red Hot (hubby's fave!) Good soup!

Terrific simple recipe. I only had 1 zucchini and followed another reviewer's suggestion of adding 1T dill. Did not peel cucumber or zucchini. Used mandolin and it was very quick. Good hot or cold.

I used chicken and beef stock rather than vegetable stock. I tripled the recipe myself. It's delicious! I think it needs some sliced jalapenos tossed in after it is cooked.:)

Very easy to make and delicious I would say make sure you blend it thoroughly especially if the cucumbers/zucchini are unseeded. Also I just grate the vegetables to save time. Great with sour cream cheese most dairy.

My garden is producing lots of cucumbers and squash so I have made this soup a few of times. I also add the dill cayenne and salt as recommended by previous reviewer and I think it really needs that seasoning. It has lovely flavors and is a nice change from other summer veggie soups.

This was a great way to eat some zuchini! I added beef broth instead of vegge and to add some zing added miso paste in the end. YUM!

Made it verbatim and was a bit bland for my preference. I took 'Soup Loving Nicole's' suggestions for mods and it was incredibly delicious. The soup is addicting. Thanks for sharing the recipe...and the mods!

Just made this and was sooo delicious! I left out the oil and just used butter. I also added a bit of dill and cayenne and a small amount of jalape√±os at the very end. Will be making this again! Thank you for the recipe!
