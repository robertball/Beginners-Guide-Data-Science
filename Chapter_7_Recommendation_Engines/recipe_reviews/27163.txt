We tried this recipe twice and had bad results both times. It just would not freeze in our White Mountain ice cream maker.  After 40 minutes, it was still soup.  I took it out and mixed in skim milk and put in our regular freezer and it finally is freezing.  We spent a lot of money and had disappointed kids.  The flavor is good, although much too sweet for my taste.

I think this recipe is under-rated because it originally called for sweetened condensed milk, but after the typo was corrected, the ratings improved.  This is my favorite ice cream recipe because 1) extremely easy - only 3 ingredients 2) lower fat than most recipes 3) great base for fruit ice creams  My modifications to the recipe:  * Use 2% evaporated milk instead of skim, because ice cream needs some fat to churn properly. Skim is too skinny!  * Scale up the recipe to use three 12oz cans of evaporated milk (36oz total) and 1 1/4 cups of sugar.  I use this recipe as a base for making fruit ice creams (in fact, I've only made the vanilla once). When using 36oz evaporated milk, I use 1 pint or 1 pound of fruit, chopped (strawberry, cherry) or pureed (blueberry, banana), and combine with 3/4 cup of the sugar for an hour to create a fruit syrup. Then mix with the milk, sugar, and vanilla, and churn.  Awesome fruit ice cream! When made with 1 pint of fruit, the recipe yields about 7 quarts ice cream.

We have updated this recipe to include evaporated milk instead of sweetened condensed, as we believe that the ingredient was interpreted incorectly from the original submission. The ice cream should be able to freeze much more quickly, and actually be "worry free"

Made with full fat evaporated milk and added 1/3 cocoa, tastes like a wendys chocolate frosty. Also dont have an ice cream maker so just froze in a baking pan with foil for an hour.

I liked this recipe a lot! It was easy and inexpensive to make, and quite tasty. It didn't turn out creamy though, more of the consistancy of ice milk I suppose. The only complaint I have is the colour--yellowy rather than white. Oh well. May try with splenda next time to reduce the calories.

Definitely underrated! It's great for how low in fat it is. I used two 12 oz cans, or 3 cups, of 2% evaporated milk (following calamari's advice), 1 1/2 tbsp vanilla, and 1/2 cup of sugar, in a 1 1/2 quart ice cream maker.  I heated the milk first to make sure the sugar dissolved thoroughly. I just added a few extra spices this time, nothing fancy.  It turned out quite well, better than expected.  Coming out right of the machine, it was quite light actually, good flavor and texture.  Not quite like full fat real ice cream, I can see the comparison to ice milk, but certainly tasty.  I will definitely make this again, and next time I'll experiment beyond vanilla.

This recipe is quick, but the results are not that good.  My ice cream was not creamy; it had more of a ice milk texture.  The biggest negative is that is tastes like evaporated milk.

Brilliant store-cupboard recipe. Have also blended in a bunch of fresh mint which works superbly well.

This was really good. I used 1/3 cup of powdered sugar instead of granulated. I gave it a whirl with the whisk attachment on my immersion blender before churning in the ice cream maker. It came out like a frozen mousse. It took exactly 18 minutes. Thank you for sharing.

My great grandmother used to make this for us in a aluminum icecube tray.  As soon as it was half way set, we would eat it out of aluminum glasses and loved every bite.  I am now in my 70's and can't wait to make this again.  It was make with evaporated milk NOT sweetened condensed.

Easy to make and the texture was good.  The taste- not so much.  We will keep looking for another recipe.
