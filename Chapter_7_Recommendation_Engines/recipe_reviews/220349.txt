I mostly used this recipe for the Pad Thai sauce. It's fantastic, better than the local "thai" restaurant here. I did add some chili paste and fresh ginger to the sauce, but that's my personal affinity for heat. Great stuff. Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty good, was super dry so had to really work on it. First time making anything with rice noodles. Soaked 28 minutes, I think I should have soaked a little longer. Flavor was mild, I was respecting more robust but maybe thatâ€™s just me. I ended up adding chicken broth to aid in dryness, probably triple the suit and fish sauce. Added straight prepared horseradish for extra heat as that was on hand. Will make again and attempt to perfect! After showing to reheat and rest after adding broth, was super good.

I added giner and a few pickled jalepenos (my go-to substitute for green chilis). I doubled the sauce and added 2 Tbsp rice vinegar. I used 1 cup frozen julienned vegetables instead of the bean sprouts. For the meat, I just used 1 lb precooked shrimp, even though I would use raw shrimp if it were on hand. I let the dish sit on the stove top for an hour or two before adding all the peanuts so they wouldn't absorb too much liquid. It was fantastic, even better cold. Perfect dish to make for other people when you can't all eat right away while it's hot. Without the rice vinegar, I don't know if it would be as good cold.

The flavour was quite nice.  I added a lot of chillies to spice it up.
