This was a great base recipe, but as is, I don't think it makes enough sauce. I added about 1 up of pineapple juice, then later another 1/2 cup with some corn starch mixed in to thicken it. Other than that the only other change I made was to sub nutmeg for the cloves, because I didn't have any. I'll definitely make this again! Next time I'll try to get a pic!

It was very interesting! Some bites were super delicious, some were quite tart from the skins. I used 2 garlic cloves, and about 2 1/2 tsp. of fresh grated ginger. I substituted nutmeg in for the cloves, because it was what I had. We thought it was good, but missing something, and decided that it needed black pepper. I served the pork chop on top of a pile of quinoa, and spooned the sauce over it all. I would definitely try this again, but next time I would try something to combat/balance a bit of the tartness. Fun to try and yummy!

Love to use fruit to flavor meat. Nice to make rather than a sugary jarful.  Used chicken broth, sprayed with Brach's Amino Acids,  no vinegar or brown sugar, 2 whole cloves vs. ground.  Added leftover pork and chicken to pan to heat.  Already cooked rice noodles so added at end to heat.  Served with cabbage and greens fried in 1 t. bacon grease and sundried tomatoes.  So much better than boring soy sauce by itself on noodles.

Great recipe,  I substituted plum jam (2-3 tablespoons) instead of plums, and only 1 teaspoon of brown sugar. Cut the cooking time down of sauce to 5-10 minutes and then baked it uncovered in the oven at 180C till cooked meat was 63 degrees.

Turned out fabulous :)

I cut this recipe down to 2 chops.  I used low sodium soy sauce and 3 plums.  My plums were really ripe (soft) and the flesh just squeezed out of the skins, I didn't put the skins in the sauce. I didn't have to cook the sauce very long - maybe 10 minutes.  There isn't a ton of sauce, just enough to coat the pork chops.  I think fresh ginger would be a good addition instead of the ground ginger.

I did not like it - the soy sauce was too overpowering.  I made this for 1 person and cooked the sauce only about 10 minutes.  The plums were soft by that point and the sauce was thickened.
