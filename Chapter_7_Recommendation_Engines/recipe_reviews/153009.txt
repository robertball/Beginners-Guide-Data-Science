Yes, I wish I had read this review before making these.  It was very difficult to mix the dough--very stiff.  I don't think I'd do this again.

I wish I wasn't the first to rate this, but I just didn't get it. I made the recipe exactly as written and something is not correct. The "cookie dough" was stiff, even though it tasted okay. I hope somebody can correct this recipe.

I didn't have any trouble with the dough being to stiff.  I did have way to much of the pumpkin filling, easily could have doubled the cookie recipe and still had plenty of filling.  I used a 1 1/2 inch cookie cutter, there didn't seem to be enough dough to use 2 1/2 inch one.  Oh, and I didn't cut the faces out of them, it sounds like way to much work.  Overall the cookies tasted okay, not to sweet.  My five year old ate them up.  She liked the "pumpkin applesauce" inside.
