This salad is delicious!  I always get raves when I bring this salad to potlucks, even from people who aren't crazy about curry. It's a nice change from the usual potato and pasta salads. Only changes I make are sometimes using sweet white onion in place of the green onion and using balsamic vinegar instead of cider. I also usu. use super-sweet frozen corn inst. of canned. The flavor of this salad is outstanding, and healthy, as well!

This was really good, but I'm only rating it four stars because the curry flavor was way too subtle. I bumped it up to 1 tsp., and still couldn't taste it. It makes a delicious bean salad, but I'll need to look for another recipe for the curry taste that I'm looking for.

This is a great salad!  I sub'd black beans instead of pinto... it made it more colorful.  I omitted the onion and celery and used 1/2 cucumber and 1/2 red pepper and it was wonderful.  I also felt 4 cloves of garlic was too much and will next time only use 1-2.  A great dressing makes this a hit.   Don't be afraid to increase the curry and cumin to 3/4 -1 teaspoon.  It can handle it!

Fantastic! Loved it, and it only gets better over time. Day 2 in the fridge was even better than the first. I would highly recommend cutting back on a clove of garlic, 3x the curry powder, and subing cucumbers for celery. Make sure to shake the dressing well.

Excellent salad! Different and wonderful change from the usual ho-hum three bean salad. In order to keep this South Beach friendly I used extra beans instead of corn. It's not at all overpowering in flavor, but I can certainly see how it would not appeal to picky eaters because of the unique taste. The crunchy celery goes awesomely with the soft beans. I put diced ham in the left overs and will be taking it to work for lunch. I will def make this again.

I made this recipe as listed and thought it was great.  It was a really nice change from the traditional 3 bean salad were all use to.  I brought it to a bar-b-queue, presented and served it as is and it was gone in no time.  I think next time I will serve it as a salad course on a bed of lettuce with sliced tomatoes.  Terrific recipe, thanks Howie!

This was a great and interesting alternative to other summer side dishes.  It came together easily in the afternoon and was yummy at dinnertime.  Definitely the best bean salad I've had.  My husband took one bite and said "mm thats good"  chewed a little more and said "ooh it has a kick to it".  It really developed like that.  It was a great side dish from ingredients I already had in my cabinet and fridge.  The only change I made was omitting the kidney beans because I didnt have any on-hand.   I'll probably take this to pot lucks in the future because it's cheap, easy and stays well for a longer period of time.  Thanks for sharing!

Loved it.  Big hit at a pot-luck this weekend.  Upped the servings to 8 and added a can of black beans to the 3 other cans of beans. Used frozen corn, and skipped celery because we were out.  Excellent taste- (used about 4 cloves vs the upped recipe requirements, because we were low on garlic).

Great healthy side!!  I used navy beans instead of garbanzo beans, left out the corn (personal preference) and doubled the curry powder.  Yummy! 
Do try to make it the night before so the flavors can blend.
Goes great as a side, as a topping on chicken and as an omelette fillter.  Definitely making this again and again!

Delicious, I can't stop eating this! I made a few changes: skimped on the vinegar a little, added a LOT more of the spices. Also added an onion, cayenne pepper, and black beans. A refreshing, but addicting, recipe I will be making again!

I've been using Allrecipes for years, but just joined today so that I could rate this recipe - it's outstanding!  Since I like real strong flavors, I doubled the oregano, cumin & curry and added 1tsp of cayenne.  I also added a red bell pepper and a can of peas, just to get more veggies.  Most bean salad recipes take time in the fridge to marinate to get the flavors to come out, but this was perfect right away.  This is a keeper & I'm sure I'll make it again as soon as I run out!  Thanks.

This salad is one of our summer favorites! I use 2 cans of black beans and 1 can of garbanzo beans instead of the kidney beans.  We often serve it with a little light sour cream and tortilla chips.  Wonderfully refreshing vegetarian recipe!

We love this salad.  Such a wonderful change from the usual three bean I've used for years.Didn't have celery so used sliced water chestnuts (wonderful) also used balsamic vinegar and olive oil.  Next time I'll at least double the curry powder.  Tonight I had 2 bowls of the leftovers sprinkled with curry powder...............delicious.  Don't forget FRESH oregano.............it grows like a weed in my yard!

This is genuinely delicious! I wasn't expecting this bean salad to be any more than a decent side dish; but you'll be dishing up seconds and thirds!

4 stars only because the curry taste was barely there. Definately double that, added avacado, red onion, black beans. Great, light taste.

Really great salad! Made a few alterations. We're not big oregano fans, so instead substituted 1 tsp marjoram and 1 tsp basil. I upped the cumin and curry powder to about 1 tsp each and reduced the amt of vinegar and canola oil. Love that it doubles for lunch the next day.

I liked it but it was NOT a big hit at the potluck - more of the store bought potato salad was eaten than my salad.  It's nice for a change of pace and I personally would have given it 4 stars but other people just were not that into it.  I was also complimented on the celery being in the salad (the guy who told me was impressed by that ingredient - go figure).

This bean salad is very versatile, as any one of the ingredients can be replaced with a similar one.  I've replaced peas for the corn, used red onions instead of green ones, etc.  What we like best about it, is that it keeps very well, without affecting taste or texture - aside from its nutritional value and great taste.

This recipe was a HUGE hit at a pot luck. We will make it a regular for us.  We added chopped up Kale as well to up the "green" factor.  It was delicious.

This is one of my favorite recipes!  This recipe also works well with just the beans, corn, and ditalini pasta.  Some people don't care for the curry and cumin, so when I make it with the ditalini I use Italian sald dressing mix.  Good stuff!

This is really good.  The only thing I will say is if you substitute dry beans that you have cooked for the canned beans, you might want to add a touch of salt to the recipe.  Definitely will make again.

Excellent! Although I have to edit this now to make it 4 start instead of 5, the aftertaste of garlic and curry lasts for hours! That is the only downside to a very good recipe.
 
I added one yellow pepper and half a green pepper. I changed the spices used - 1 tsp of curry powder and 3/4 tsp cumin, as well as used black beans instead of pinto. 

Thank you!

Not only is this recipe extremely quick & easy to prepare, it tastes absolutely delicious. I also like the convenience of being able to keep the ingredients on hand in the pantry, ready at a moments notice. I made some changes---I used pinto beans instead of chick peas, as well as a chopped red onion, garlic powder instead of chopped cloves, and red wine vinegar instead of cider. I also added a small minced cherry pepper, for just a touch of heat. This is such a great addition to hamburgers and hot dogs. This is one of my favorite new recipes, and I'm sure I'll make this many more times. I encourage you to try it!

Really good as is. I did use frozen corn and add 1/2 of a chopped cucumber and a green pepper. After eating it straight I tried it with about 2 Tbsp plain fat-free yogurt in 1/2 cup of the salad. It was excellent that way as well. Either way, the seasoning was great if you like garlic and food with some kick.

I just took this to a potluck and barely anyone ate it. It had way too much kick and way too much garlic even though I only put in 3 cloves. I will not make this again. Plus it makes a HUGE amount.

This was pretty good. The basil is really prevalent though. I think next time I will reduce that and increase the curry and cumin a bit. Agreed that this is a nice change from the usuals though!
