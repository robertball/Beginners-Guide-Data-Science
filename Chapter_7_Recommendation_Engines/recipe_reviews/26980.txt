With a few revisions, this was a great snack! 

I made the topping (syrup, brown sugar and butter) exactly as described. 

I did, however, switc up the ingredients a bit: Chex Mix cereal, cheerios, pretzels, salted peanuts and honey roasted peanuts. 

I threw it all in a disposable roasting pan, then sprinkled in M&Ms after it was done baking. 

Very sweet and addicting mix that everyone has loved!

I made this for several kids I was dropping off at the movies.  I did read many reviews and decided to use 1/2 box chex mix, 1/2 box cheerios, 2 handfuls of dry roasted peanuts, 1 handful of sunflower seeds and 1 cup of mini pretzels.  I also used the disposable pan trays.  I used two large sized and placed all the mix in one and drizzled sauce over.  I covered with the other disposable pan and held them together to turn over to distibute the sauce evenly.  I divided the mix between the two pans while baking.  Only needed to cool about 10 minutes on "sprayed" wax paper.  I did have some of it stick to the paper.  Put into snack sized bags sprinkled with M & M 's.  This does make a lot but it disappears FAST!!  I will make this again.

Believe all these reviews!! As I was putting this together for the first time, I tasted it and thought, "okay, nothing special..." HOLY COW!!! After it has baked and cooled, I have never seen anyone (other than the super cool and super healthy kids in my acting class - insert eye roll...) who can keep their hands out of it. Here's how we have decided we like it best: Chop up a 5 oz jar of macadamia nuts into about half size chunks. Toast the nuts at 350 for about 10 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool. In the largest bowl you can find, mix a little over half a box of plain Cheerios, a little over half a box of Crispix, a little over half a bag of Snyders Butter Snaps pretzels, the toasted macadamia nuts, and about one third of a box of wheat Chex. Make the goo - follow the rest of the directions, baking in the largest and deepest aluminum roasting pan you can find. CAN'T STOP EATING THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!

Beware . . . I had to make a double receipe because I couldn't stop nibbling!
A little messy to work with when stirring.

This was fantastic!  One change I would make for myself is just using a larger disposable roasting pan for mixing.  Other than that, super-easy and delish!
Editing to add that I boil the corn syrup, sugar mixture for about 3-4 minutes.  Also, the last time I made it, I used 4 cups of rice chex and 4 cups of wheat chex.  It made for a nice crunchy mix that was just sweet enough.  Very good!

I added mini pretzles before baking and then M&Ms at the end.  I couldn't stop eating this and my guests loved it.  My 17 year old begged me to let her take it in a baggie everyday to share with her friends at summer school.  Winner, winner!  P.S. Don't make this if you are on a diet because you will not be able to resist it and there is nothing diet about it.

OOOH MY!  Very Good!  Easy, if you get carried away adding different dry goods, just up the sauce ingred's by 1/4.  The salty and sweet ratio is perfect. It is nice to have a recipe that can be adaptable to what you have on hand, or what you like best! 
DO NOT CROWD ON COOKIE SHEET, IT WILL COOL IN BIGGER THAN BITE SIZE PIECES IF YOU DO. GIVE IT ROOM TO COOL,re: 2 COOKIE SHEETS.

Have made this recipe twice this week!  I did add more nuts the second time around (4 cups total).  With peanuts, it taste alot like peanut brittle.  YUMMY!!!  I also baked mine on sprayed cookie sheets (use two) for ease of stirring the mixture.  I also stirred the mixture about every 10 minutes as it was cooling so it wouldn't stick so bad to the cookie sheets.  VERY ADDICTIVE!!!  Definitely a diet buster.  Thanks Bobbie for sharing!

I made this for a party and it was a huge hit.  I used 1 box of Crispix, 1/2 a box of Honey Nut Cheerios, the almonds, one bag of Goldfish pretzels, 1 jar of honey roasted peanuts, and added a bag of peanut butter M&Ms after it cooked.  Because I used more crunchy stuff, I increased the butter and corn syrup to 1 cup each and 2 cups of the brown sugar.  Everyone at the party loved it.  I will definitely make this again.

Simple and delicious.  I doubled this recipe, added pretzels to the mixture and m&ms after this was baked and fed it to a group of 60 kids at a youth center.  It was enjoyed by all.

Very addicting let me tell you! i have made these twice and both times I find it hard to share with my kids! I use just a regular bag of chex mix and then throw a variety of peanuts in there. My 3 yr old helps me make this snack, so it's so simple to make.

A new party favorite!  The kids and adults alike gobbled it up.  I took advice of another reviewer and made it with Rice Chex, peanuts, Cheerios, and M&M's after baking/cooling.  Also, I found alphabet pretzels and the kids were trying to spell their names with them.  Sweet and salty and chocolate - just took care of my big 3 cravings in one dish...  I love it!

OK, everyone here said, "ADDICTIVE," but I didn't think it could be THAT good.  Well, it IS!  Super easy to make.  I used light corn syrup because that's what I had.  Worked fine.  Did 1/2 box of honey nut cheerios, 1/2 box rice cereal, dry roasted peanuts, a bag of slivered almonds (toasted).  After it came out of the over, I did put it on parchment and there was no sticking.  I sprinkled holiday m&m's on top after it was out of the oven for about 3 minutes (so they didn't melt).  This was a terrific recipe.  It will be used often next Christmas for many, many gifts.  I think next time, I'll add mini-pretzels (as suggested below).  The salty would be a good balance to so much sweet.

Good recipe. Added a dash of cinnamon to the coating while it was on the stove...made the house smell awesome and added a little extra flavor to the coating. Used corn and rice chex cereals, mini pretzles, peanuts and pecans. After it cooled added M&Ms bannana chips and coconut flakes...kids LOVE it!

Just made this for New Years party. Makes alot. Super easy. I ended up putting in Rice Chex, Corn Chex, Raisins, Peanuts, Pretzels and M&M's at the end. I poured mine out onto a cookie sheet liner. I used two 13 x 9 pans in the oven and stirred every ten minutes. It coats really well when stirred often. Very easy and makes alot!

My husband said that this is the best snack mix he has ever tasted!  After reading many of the comments I decided to take bits and pieces of what others had done, so I used 1 box of rice/corn cereal, 1 box of honey nut O's, and 1 box of wheat Chex.  I added a bag of butter snap pretzels and a jar of honey roasted peanuts.  I doubled the recipe for the coating and did it all in one large roasting pan - the turkey pan with the non-stick lining.  I baked as directed and stirred every ten minutes.  The dogs appreciated the few pieces that spilled out while I stirred.  After an hour or so in the oven I took it out and removed some of the mix to parchment coated with no-stick spray, then continued to stir the mix that remained in the roaster every ten minutes until it cooled - about 30 more minutes.  Before I bagged it up I stirred in a medium bag of m&ms.  Both my son and my husband asked for a bag to take and share with friends tomorrow!

I had to cut the recipe down because I didn't have enough butter.  But the ratios turned out fine.  I used chex,  a cup of peanuts a couple cups of cheerios, a couple cups of pretzels.  I had a disposible roasting pan so I figured I would just let it cool in that.  Big mistake!  Use the wax paper!  The coating cooled and formed a big glob of mixture.  I was  able to break it apart but it was somewhat time consuming.  After I had it in containers I added some M&M's.  Very sweet treat.

I thought this was great.  The hubby liked it and the container I took to work disappeared within an hour.  This flavor is very sweet, which I like, but to some it might be too sweet.  I added pretzels and whole wheat chex mix and still thought there was enough of the butter/sugar mixture to accommodate more cereal.  I will try with whole almonds and hazelnuts next time as well as another 2-3 cups of cereal.  This is a keeper :).

This a great "Chex Mix" snack!  I made this for my three year old's preschool class and they LOVED it.  I used peanuts instead of the other nuts and then added pretzels after it was cooled.  It was a huge hit and I will defiantly make this again.

GREAT!! But...I thought that it was better if you did NOT bake it after adding the coating....just stir well and let it cool to room temp.

This was a tasty caramel snack mix. My 4th of July guests almost finished it off in one evening. While this one is good, its got nothing on the White Chocolate Snack Mix on this site. I guess you could call it personal preference, but the white chocolate one my family calls 'Crack Mix' because once you start, you're addicted.

Super delish!  I used to make it exactly as-is (and it was great), but then my daughter was diagnosed w/a nut allergy.  So now I omit all the nuts, but I do add a 16 oz bag of mini pretzles to the cereal.  Also, as others have suggested, you can add M&Ms, but wait until it's totally cooled first.

It makes a lot.  With the pretzles, it's enough to fill two gallon zip-loc bags.

So so so good!  I switched it up just a bit, but only by cutting the pecans and adding about 1/2 to 1 cup of coconut to give a different flavor.  Seriously, it's so addicting!!

Updated 11/23/16 - This time I only used 1 cup of brown sugar, and I brought the sugar/butter mixture to a rolling boil for about 1 minute.  I let it cool on aluminum foil sprayed with Pam, and it came up much better!  
Original review: This was very good and got rave reviews at Bunco!  The name fits it well - it's very sweet.  I subbed peanuts for pecans and used 1/2 a box of Honey Nut Cheerios and 1/2 a box of Rice Chex.  Also added M&M's when I took them out of the oven.  They melted pretty good even so!  Also, it stuck really badly to the wax paper as it was cooling.  Had to pick wax paper out of it when I broke it all up!

I agree with several of the other reviews..This is addictive!  Based on the reviews I made a few changes and added pretzels, some peanuts, cheerios.  Also added m&m's after the mix cooled down.  I made it in two batches, and in the first one, by accident, put in 1/3rd of the butter the recipe called for..and it turned out absolutely fine.

The coating in this recipe is awesome! I made the sauce with brown sugar, butter and corn syrup as instructed and poured it over the cereal (minus the nuts)To be honest I've never tried the actually recipe,but I'm sure it's great. To save time and money I bought "Indulgent Trail Mix" at Sams/WalMart. It comes in a 28 oz bag, use 1/2 the bag per 12oz cereal. It includes; peanuts,almonds, cashews, dried cranberries, golden raisins and three kinds of chips (chocolate, white chocolate and peanutbutter). YummOOhh! It's the best trail mix we have ever eaten and it's definitely more economical than buying the individual ingredients.

I also added pretzels, m& m's , and corn candy. So then I changed the recipe to 1 cup butter, 1 cup dark corn syrp and 2 cups brown sugar.  Is excellent.

This was awesome!!!  It is very true... you cannot stop eating it once you try it!  The kids and husband both loved it also!  It is nice because you can add whatever you wish, I used chex cereal (corn and rice), and roasted peanuts.  I will keep this recipe close, because I know the kids will have me making it again soon!!!!

This is so delicious and addictive!  I used Wheat, Corn and Rice Chex cereal, Cheerios, Salted peanuts, pretzels and raisins.  The raisins add something special, and I will add dried crans next time.  I cooled the mixture on parchment paper and had no sticking.  Also, I used two pans to bake to make stirring easier.  This is definitely a keeper!! Thanks.  update:  I made this several more times and am making again today.  I added Fritos and the salt/sweet was delicious.  I also decided to add the crans after the baking so they don't get hard.  I use light corn syrup in the same quantity and it turns out great.  My family and friends keep requesting I make more!  I have this in my "Christmas" food list.

This was so good! I added cheerios, pretzels, and honey roasted peanuts when baking in the oven and then added m&m like other reviews after it cooled. This definately had a lot of glaze even with the added ingredients. Maybe next time I will add less butter and maybe even more dry ingredients so it isn't too sweet. Thanks!

SUPER SNACK RECIPE!!  I can't say enough about this party mix ~  I made a batch for my daughter's 15th birthday party and the teenagers devoured it in minutes!!  Adults loved it too.  I cooled it on wax paper I sprayed with olive oil and it came off easy.  Thanks!

This tastes really good! Very easy to make. I used a disposable turkey roasting pan and mixed the dissolved sugar mixture and the cereal mix right in the buttered pan with no mess. I used almonds, cashews, and dried roasted peanuts. I couldn't stop eating this stuff. Very addicting! Your kitchen will smell wonderful while it is baking too. Thankyou for sharing your recipe Bobbi. The only thing I would change next time is to use parchment paper instead of wax paper to cool mix on. I had trouble with the mix sticking to the wax paper.

I didn't really like this, but my family loved it. With the first bite, one of the kids was asking 'How come you've never made this before?' and the boyfriend says there's needs to be a bowl of this around at all times.

This party mix is perfect for so many occasions! I used 1/3 box cheerios, 1/3 box rice chex, 1/2 box wheat chex, 1/2 bag mini pretzels, and 1/2 bag of mini honey teddy grahams.  I also doubled the sauce mixture because of the good reviews and divided the mixture between two large foil pans for baking.  So sweet and yummy and so many ways to change it up.  Love it!

This is so good that Miss Piggy would award it 5 oinks. 

Made this recipe as directed and added M&M's, peanuts and pretzels as other reviewers suggested. Next time the slivered almonds will go...They are too expensive, tend to get stuck on the paper and don't add that much flavor.  More peanuts or raisins (plain or yogurt covered) would probably provide more bang for the buck.

Mixed the stuff up in a small (clean) trash bag to avoid the messy job of having to stir and mix...Cooked it on cookie sheets...Noticed a bit of puddling...took care of it by adding more stuff.

Watching it disappear and getting asked for the recipe was almost as rewarding as the eating.

We doubled this recipe the day before Thanksgiving and had it eaten by Friday!!!  Even with all the other "goodies" we had.  Then again, we doubled the recipe on Saturday and it was gone by Sunday night.  We had 8 people munching on it and we couldn't stop!!!  This is the best party mix ever.  This will be the main ingredient in the Christmas baskets this year.  YUM. YUM!!!!  As another reviewer said,  Don't fix this if you are dieting!!  Ain't no way you can leave this alone.

This is definitely addictive. Last year, I doubled the recipe, but forgot to double the sugar and corn syrup. It was buttery, crispy, and awesome! The previous year, I tried whole almonds, but slivered works better in this recipe. Large pecan pieces are perfect.

I was a little disappointed with the recipe, which based on the reviews must have been something that I did.  I didn't think it was anything special, and my 3-year-old daughter didn't like it either.  It actually tasted best when they were still warm.  I did add pretzels which was a mistake.  I thought the pretzels were terrible.  Thanks for sharing!!

This was a big hit at a party I had this weekend.  Definitely addictive.  For easier/less messy mixing, I ended up mixing the ingredients in 2 separate large bowls and then pouring them together in a large roasting pan to go in the oven.  I would definitely make this again.

Very good mix. I added some dry roasted peanuts and pretzel snaps to give a salty mix to it. This was good and I know it will get eaten quickly. It did make a lot so I got a lot of gift bags filled with it. I thought this had a molasses flavor overall though, but no one else here mentioned it. I made this in two big pans so it was a little more manageable when stirring. This was a nice change from the regular spicy chex party mix, thanks!!!

This is a great recipe. I didn't have dark corn syrup so I used light corn syrup;decreased the amount by 1/2 cup; increased the brown sugar by 1/2 cup and it turned out wonderfully. I also added candy corn and halloween colored M&M's to trick it out for the holiday. Yummy!!

I am giving this 5 stars even though I didnt really care for it (probably due to pregnancy taste bud issues), but my family LOVED it and were addicted to it.  My sister said she is not making this at home cos she's eat it all.  The only change i made was honey roasted peanuts instead of the other nut (not almonds, but the other one - sorry cant remember exactly what the recipe called for).  easy to make!  thanks for the recipe.

DO NOT make this recipe if you are on a diet.  I made this for my daughter's b-day party and it was sooo good and soooo addictive that I couldn't stop eating it.  It also got rave reviews from all of the party guests.  I will definitely make this mix again.....Also, I added M&Ms as suggested by some of the other reviewers, but I actually preferred it without them.

Not quite what I expected but very good.  I really thought it would be sweeter.  I made the syrup just as directed but did add some broken pretzel sticks, potato sticks, and toasted chopped almonds, walnuts & pecans.  The trick to this is just to mix it in the roasting pan in the first place, then dump onto two sheets of parchment paper side-by-side on your table.  It cools very quickly, allowing you to 'mix' it with your hands on the parchment.  Thank you very much for this recipe!
UPDATE: I just made this again, 1 1/2 years later and forgot I had made it before.  My experience this time was much different, although I didn't really do anything significantly differently.  I was really really awesomely good and addictive.  I do have a convection oven now and wonder if that's why it came out a little chewier, though not sticky.  LOVED IT!

Good flavor!  I made the recipe as directed with the exception of using light corn syrup and dry roasted peanuts (what I had on hand); seemed like there was too much of the wet ingredients and kept pooling at the bottom of the pans.  I had a hard time scraping it off after letting it cool, even though I had sprayed the pans with Pam; thus the 4-star rating.

This was a BIG hit. Added a few more nuts but followed everything else to the letter. Easy to make (make sure the pan that you put this in, that goes in the oven, is the biggest that you have. I used a big roasted and was still causious when stiring every 15 minutes) Will make again I'm sure. Thanks Bobbi

Wonderful recipe - easy and fun to make! I have used different types of cereal (my favorite is wheat chexs) and nuts and comes out great each time. Make sure you use a big roasting pan.

I took this to my in-laws as a snack before a dinner party and we had to remove it from the table before everyone filled up on it and didn't have room for dinner!
My sister-in-law took a leftover bag of it to work as did I and the word from her office was "this stuff rocks" and from mine there was much begging for more.
Who would think 6 simple ingredients could combine to make such an amazing snack mix!
 I used Crispix as it is rice on one side and corn on the other.

Amazingly forgiving recipe.  I didn't have dark corn syrup, so I used light and added a bit of buckwheat honey and molasses to it for some flavor.  I also threw in mini-marshmallows, cheerios, M&Ms and pretzels, plus some cashews and salted almonds left over from who knows when.  This recipe can be more "classy" or "trashy" depending on what you add to it.  I also doubled the ratio of dry ingredients since my sauce came out pretty sweet and I was making it for a group of adults.  This is an extremely forgiving recipe.  Also, I just used a disposable lasagna pan that I didn't grease--turned out fine.

This is some good stuff!  I made this for my husbands family that came down to Texas to visit and they loved it!  I loved it too!  It is soo yummy and addicting!  

I did change up the ingriendents like some of the other reviewers.  I used the corn and wheat crispy square cereal, toasted pecans(I had them on hand), pretzels, and raisins.  Once it completly cooled I added a few handfuls of m&m's candies.  It is just so good! It did make a lot of mix!  Great to bring to parties, which is what I plan on doing at the next party!  Very good you need to try.  Thanks for a yummy snack!

Baking this really made it crunchy which I like very much but I wasn't overly impressed with the flavor. It was ok. Tastes like sugary cereal. Got good reviews from my daughters birthday party guests. I would make this again for a party as it is a good snack. Seems like it's missing something though.

I made this for a birthday party as well and this mix was a huge hit!  I added honey roasted peanuts, cashews, Cheerios, and M&M's--once it cooled enough.  I also used a disposable roasting pan and sprayed olive oil on the wax paper like someone else suggested.  Very easy clean up for me and oh-so-yummy!

The reviews didn't lie.  Addictive is the perfect word for it.  Reminds me a bit of "Cracker Jacks" or whatever it was called with the popcorn and peanuts in the box with the prize.  Next time I think I'll try adding some fresh popped corn along with the cereal and nuts.

I just made this and can hardly keep my hands off from this.  It's delicious.  I used a corn chex/rice chex mix b/c I didn't have crispix, but followed everything else exactly.  I am letting it cool on parchment paper, and it is coming up quite easily.  This is a keeper.

This is so sweet & addictive, it's hard to stop eating.  My one & only complaint was mine stuck to the wax paper like glue, I ended up putting it in the freezer so I could get it off.  I will not do the wax paper again, otherwise A+++++

This is definitely addictive!  I followed another reviewers suggestion and added m-n-m's.  I also used honey roasted peanuts in place of the other nuts.  In any case, the "glaze" is marvelous and whatever you add to it - you can't go wrong with this one!

Very tasty!!  I used cripx cereal and added pretzels and peanuts instead of almonds. I didn't toast the peacans cause of time, but next time I will try it and I will probably put in almonds.  It was very easy to make.  I had to bring the left overs to work so I wouldn't eat all of it myself.

Really yummy!  This is one of my favorite recipes that I've tried from this site.  I used wheat chex and otherwise made the recipe as written.  This stuff is definitely addictive; it's almost impossible to stop eating it.  And it's really easy to make.  This will be a holiday staple in our house from now on!!

THIS stuff is amazing. I didn't have the dark corn syrup on hand, so I substituted honey since the recipe doesn't bake super hot (burnt honey is not tasty). I also added a sprinkle of cinnamon in the melted butter sauce before pouring over my dry mix. Next time I'm stocking up on pantry items, I'll get some dark corn syrup and try the original version. I love the shattery crisp brittle coating on this. I added m&m's and yogurt pretzels after cooling and it's a real beauty.

Awesome!  I used 1/2 box corn chex and 1/2 box rice chex, 1/2 box cheerios, 2 handfuls of dry roasted peanuts, 1 handful of sunflower seeds, 1 cup chopped pecans and 2 cup of mini pretzels. I divided the mix between  two jelly pans while baking. Cooled on waxed paper sprayed with Pam. After cooled I added  M & M 's. The mix made plenty but did not last long!

Okay, this could be harmful to a diet. 
I only used 1 c of brown sugar and 1 c of dark corn syrup. I also left out all the nuts it calls for and put in peanuts and bits of garlic bagel bites. As I turned it every 20 minutes, I added a few sprinkles of coarse salt. Once it cooled, I added raisins. I'll make it again and next time have m&m's to add once it cools.  :-) A good party snack!

DEFINATE KEEPER!!!!!!( I made this during the holiday season) I tossed in pretzels, used light corn syrup instead of dark just because I had that on hand. I also threw in slivered almonds and M&M's! COULD NOT STOP EATING IT!! It makes an ENORMOUS amount! So much that I gave it away to teachers and neighbors as Christmas gifts in glassed Mason Jars with gift cards. A total HIT! Thanks!!!

Absolutely awesome snack mix!  I've made this recipe on two occassions and both times it was gobbled up in no time!  I personally like using peanuts instead of the almonds and pecans - gives it a little kick of salt and is a lot cheaper:)

My husband told me under no circumstances should I ever make this again because he can't stop eatting it. The reviews don't lie, it's super easy, and tastes incredible. I'd add a cup of peanuts and a cup of cheerios too. I'll wait until hubby is out of town..............

Holy Crack! This stuff is ADDICTIVE! I needed to find something to make to give away at Christmas and this was a hit! I made 2 tripled batches for a total of 6 batches! Super easy! Here is how I modified it: I figured 12 ounces is about 9 cups. I used Corn Chex, Rice Chex,  Cheerios, pretzels and peanuts; like traditional Chex mix. The syrupy topping seemed excessive so I threw in a couple more cups of cereal. This being my first batch, I didn’t know what to expect.  Then I forgot about it and overcooked it by at least an hour. The result was a crunchy, all coated, but not sticky snack mix.  It was delicious and crunchy. But, my second triple batch I tried to keep the coating more gooey and concentrated.. once again I forgot and overcooked  it about an hour.  If it made a difference, it was still addictive and amazing. I mixed all 6 batches together, fill up cellophane bags and left a ton for the family.  I smuggled some into the movies and we could not stop eating it’s salty, sweet, crunchy, gooey, buttery goodness.

I couldn't resist trying some additional suggested add-ins. I doubled the recipe by adding 6oz butter pretzels, 6oz plain cheerios, 6 oz macadamia, 3 oz sunflower seeds, 5 oz salted peanuts. I then doubled the syrup, butter and sugar. I used a large regular roasting pan sprayed with non-stick. Clean up was a breeze. I then cooked it for about 1 1/2 hrs. 

Very, very good. I made it for a canoe trip tomorrow (it's summer here, hence the reason for no M&M's), and it will be a big hit!

I followed the recipe for the sweet sauce and added some peanuts and some stick pretzels and as others have said it’s yummy.  I would recommend quickly transferring it to wax or parchment paper because it does cool quickly.  This is a keeper. :-)

I kicked up the recipe a bit for my friends who love a little spice.  I added  1/4 -1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper to sugar mixture once melted or sprinkle over combined mix on sheet pans.  Used both pecans and walnuts with the almonds .

Everyone loves this mix.  I didn't have dark corn syrup so I made the following substitutions and it still turned out great - light corn syrup and dark brown sugar instead of dark syrup and light br sugar.  I also added the following after reading other reviews: butter pretzels, dry roasted peanuts and M&M's at the very end so they didn't melt.

I'll make again, but either use a 15oz box or more of cereal or use less butter, corn syprup & brown sugar. This was very good, just to sweet as is.

Very yummy. Even the kiddos like it.  I just threw in what I had in the pantry. Crispix cereal, Cheerios, unsalted peanuts, sunflower seeds, pretzels, and m&m's.  Definitely spray the wax paper before pouring the mix onto it to cool.  Mine stuck to the paper, so I had to turn the wax paper over and use a blow dryer on low to help release the trail mix.

I used some adaptations and suggestions from other reviewers to satisfy my tastes, and it was wonderful.
