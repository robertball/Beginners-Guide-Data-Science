Wonderful - fast and tasty!!  I did do a few things differently.  I had to double the recipe to feed everyone so I sauted the garlic with some chopped onion in the olive oil until soft.  I then added 1 can of low fat chicken broth, a little white wine and both sun-dried tomatoes and some chopped Roma tomatoes and let this simmer while the pasta cooked.  The smell was unbelievable!  I used fresh basil and tossed in some sliced olives. Tossed all together, and then gently stirred in the cheeses at the last.  My son said it was a gourmet meal!  We might try throwing in some shrimp or chicken strips next time, although with a salad and some french bread, its a complete, wonderful meal.  Thank you for sharing!!

This is one of my favorite recipes, and it works well reheated also.  I like to buy sundried tomatoes in oil because they are soft and easy to cut with kitchen scissors.  I substitute the leftover oil for the olive oil in the recipe, and sometimes use less than 1/4 cup to keep it from being too oily.  The tomatoes are the best part, so I usually put extra!  Such a great combination of flavors....

Definently quick and easy! Didn't have a problem mixing - I mixed everything but the cheeses together and then mixed those in last. 4 *'s. UPDATE: Made this again and modified quite a few things, this time I'm giving it 5 *'s because it was delicious. By idea and suggestion of a few other users I sauteed garlic, onion, tomato, basil, and olives in a little bit of olive oil before adding to the pasta. I then added the feta and stirred. The only other things I added were salt and pepper. I did sprinkle parmesan on one serving and none the next - I liked it better without. My 2 yr old liked it, my 5 yr old didn't want to try it but I think he was already full from pre-dinner snacking.

Fabulous dish! It was very simple and very good. I could have made a meal out of this all by itself! I doubled the amount of sun-dried tomatoes and used regular feta cheese. I also used fresh basil instead of cilatro. This dish can easily be modified to suite your tastes. It can be served warm or cold. I found I really enjoyed it better the next day and added some red pepper flakes, kalamata olives and a splash of balsamic vinegar. No matter what you do it's bound to be delicious - especially with a nice glass of wine!

This recipe is so wonderful because it takes minimal effort and there are so many things you can add.  I added capers, pine nuts and black olives.  I have made this a few times and realized that if you feel it is too dry try adding some fresh lemon juice instead of more olive oil. It really blends with the other flavors well and doesn't make it too greasy.

Excellent! I had some trouble mixing it, too. But eventually got it mixed. Make sure you use enough olive oil, I don't think I did. I also substituted that Kraft shredded parmesan/asiago/ramano mix instead of plain parmesan. AND I substitued fresh parsley for cilantro. I find that whenever I put cilantro in anything, it overwhelms the taste of everything else in the dish!

What a great recipe!  My husband raved!  Some ideas I had were to add some artichoke hearts and maybe try other types of pasta.  Thanks for this great recipe!

This was very good and quick to whip up.  I sauted the garlic with some pine nuts for a nuttier flavor.  No salt needed- the feta cheese is salty enough.

Thank you for such a wonderfully delicious resturant quality recipe :o) I served this dish to my boyfriend on Valentine's Day and he LOVED IT!! He absolutedly RAVED about it.

I followed the advice of some of the others that reviewed the recipe and added the cheeses at the end.  Also, I used Penne pasta instead of Angel hair, poured the pasta in a very large serving dish and then mixed in all of other ingredients.

It was so good, you have to try!

Terrific recipe!  I used bow tie pasta both times I made this dish.  The pasta was easy to mix with the other ingredients and held up well.  The second time I made this, I added grilled chicken to the pasta.  This makes an awesome meal!

My husband thought it was excellent.  A little too much cilantro for me but I thought it was good.  I like the idea of using another pasta like Penne.  I think i will try that next time i make it.  Thanks for the good idea.

This is delicious.  I make several changes now that I have made it so many times. I add a large chopped onion, lots of oregano and basil (instead of cilantro), extra garlic, white wine, and two 14.5 oz cans of tomatoes (instead of sun-dried). I also add the feta and Parmesan to only the cooked pasta instead of mixing everything in the whole recipe together.  To serve, I put the pasta/cheese mixture on the plate and then put the sauteed tomato, garlic, etc. mixture on top of the pasta. Its great with shrimp too. I think as written it needs more toppings or less pasta; this is why I add all the extra tomatoes and onion.

One tip for the reviewers who thought this came out dry - save some of your pasta cooking water and add it to the finished dish - it works perfectly (and, I imagine, is better than doubling the oil).

My husband and I slightly altered this recipe to make it our own, but we absolutely love where it started us. We took out the cilantro (too strong for us..) replaced the angel hair with bow tie, added artichoke hearts in the marinate and made the ingredient portions a little smaller. For us, the artichokes make it AMAZING, they add just the perfect flavor. WE also found that if you put the feta in last the dish smells better (too much feta, too warm smells a lil pukey)... otherwise it was wonderful and we love it!:)

We really liked this dish. My 4 year old and my 2 year old both asked for seconds! I used regular feta and added a little lemon juice.

Simply AMAZING! I took the suggestions of others and fried the sun dried tomatoes with the garlic and oil before mixing them with the pasta. I also use the oil that the sun dried tomatoes were packed in, and if that isnt enough oil then I just add some plain olive oil to the tomato oil. I also add some sliced black olives and WOW! Flavor explosion in my mouth! This is definitely a favorite in my house now

I've tried this before.  Easy to make, but not THAT much flavor.  Instead of olive oil, I just used the tomato oil with the sundried tomatoes.

THIS WAS FANTABULOUS!! This is the best pasta dish I have ever made! I sauteed green onions, garlic, sundried tomatoes with their own oil, basil, about 4 tblsp. of chicken broth until liquid almost absorbed. Then I mixed pasta with the sauteed mixture, added shredded Italian cheese mix,(mozzarella,parmesean,) then added  crumbled basil/tomatoe feta, not too much it is salty. This was absolutely the best dish ever, the whole family loved it!  I served it with grilled chicken strips. We will definitely add this to our recipe box and will make it often. MMMM MMMM Good!

I felt like there wasn't much but pasta! So I added more of everything. I also cooked the sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, and a few sauteed mushrooms before adding it to the pasta. I only had regular feta so I compensated by adding some fresh basil. I had a really hard time mixing this up. Overall, yum!

This recipe is so light and flavorful!  I made it last year with the wrong kind of sun-dried tomatoes and hated it, actually.  This week I made it (without remembering I had before) and used the sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil.  It made all the difference in the world.  Will make many more times!

This recipe has been sitting in my recipe box for months and how i regret not making it sooner! My husband and i don't agree on much and we both loved this dish. I used fresh basil in place of the cilantro and added some grilled chicken. I also used mini bow tie pasta in place of the angel hair but i'm sure it would be terrific with any pasta. This will be made often in my house.

A little trickery on my part made this a hit.  My secret?  Don't tell them what it is...even if they ask. (The guys NEVER would've tried it if they knew what was in it!  Had to chop the artichoke hearts very fine to hide them) I used a larger (I think it was 8 oz) jar of sun dried tomatoes in olive oil.  Poured entire jar into saute pan - added in a tsp of jarred minced garlic, Penzey's California Basil, onion, and artichoke hearts.  Mixed in some white wine and chicken broth, as per suggestions.  Heated until warm and liquids began to cook down.  Then mixed in four ounces of the tomato basil feta and some parmesan.  Tossed over the noodles.  Mmmm.  Awesome change of pace - great flavor - Gorgeous presentation.  Even the four year old picky pants kids ate this! Will be making this again!! Thanks for the great idea!

We give Nicole Hunt a STANDING OVATION!!!  Add my husband to the list of guys who LOVE this recipe.  I LOVE it too!  It's SOOOOOOO easy to make.  This is our favorite, "last minute - don't know what to make for dinner" recipe.  I buy the sun-dried tomatoes in oil so all I have to do is scoop them out of the jar.  THANK YOU NICOLE!!!

A very awesome recipe! I could not stop eating it. I love greek olives so added some of those and balsamic vinegar. After I served it I also realized that green onion would taste super as well. Thumbs up for this recipe. Thank you for sharing.

This was really good and very easy to make.  The only thing I added was a jar of marinated artichokes.  I usually make pasta with parsley, but the cilantro was a nice change.

I didn't care for this dish. I had to add quite a bit more oil and it still came out dry. A bit bland, even with all the seasonings. I would not make this again.

I used sun dried tomatoes packed in oil and used some of that oil in place of the regular olive oil.  I used plain feta cheese, but I think the tomato basil flavor would be good also.

This is an easy recipe that I cook all the time. It's great especially for having company because it is delicious and so easy to make!

I tend to use a shorter pasta such as rotini so that it is easier to stir. Also, I just use a chunk of good feta and crumble it in. I use the sun dried tomatoes in olive oil ad they are moister and easier to chop. I sometimes use a tube of freshly chopped cilantro as a shortcut. Also, I add a can of artichokes drained and then torn. Delicious!!

I actually sauteed the garlic, chopped up mushroom, capers and sun-dried tomatoes in olive oil before tossing in with the pasta, parmsean cheese, chopped olives & fresh basil. I expected more flavor from the dish...I think I'll add more pepper and salt next time as well as more of the SDT oil and a bit of lemon juice.

This is a pretty good starter recipe that can be modified to your tastes by adding other ingredients.  Surprisingly good reheated the next day for lunch.  This recipe makes enough to feed about six adults.

Delicious! Very quick and easy to make. I sauted the garlic and the sundried tomatoes before adding to the pasta. Also, I used fresh basil instead of cilantro, I think basil goes better with this dish.

I added shrimp to this - yummy!  This is great to make anytime I have guests and need to whip something up quickly.  I don't like the way the cheese clumps though so I am currently working on added ingredients such as cream, or some of the pasta water, or some mascarpone cheese, etc to make it less clumpy.  Haven't found a formula that makes it smooth instead of clumpy but this is just too good to give up!  Also I am allergic to garlic so I use ginger as a substitue.  I first fry the shrimp in the ginger about 2-3 tablespoons this makes the shrimp REALLY yummy! Then I remove the shrimp and make the dish as instructed in the remaining ginger (whatever doesn't stick the the shrimp). I also use extra sun dried tomatoes in oil. --- that is so funny, my cheese clumped because I tossed it into a pan before adding it to the pasta --- well that is one way to warm those tomatoes, lol :)  Will try this without warming the cheese.

This was an EXCELLENT and also very easy to make pasta dish. I loved it! I didnt even measure the ingredients, just did it by eye. I think I used a lot more of the sundried tomatoes, and used fresh basil and cilantro. The olive oil and garlic is excellent on it. Everyone loved it. I will definitely be making this again...and there was only one pot to wash!

Definitely yummy - my boyfriend took one bite and announced he'd eat it again, which is always a win in my book :).  I added chopped kalamata olives for a little extra zip and used half cilantro and half basil because that's what I had.  Also added extra tomatoes because who doesn't love sun-dried tomatoes?!  It was a little dry even after adding some extra olive oil - next time I'll take another reviewer's suggestion and add some lemon juice, the flavors should mix perfectly.  Also, I don't know that the Parmesan is necessary - I used it but the feta is so flavorful that I'll probably just leave it out next time.  Definitely worth a try!!

Ok, it was really dry. Not sure what happened. The flavors were great with the sauteed onions, garlic, olives, tomatoes. I did add extra olive oil, but the pasta was so dry.

Wow! Ahmazing! I'm so happy I tried this! Did everything according to recipe except I added 1 juiced lemon and 2T of capers while sauteing garlic, sun dried tomatoes, and cilantro. I did have a problem with everything sticking. Maybe it's because I cooked the noodles before I started preparing the mixture?? Next time I think I will add the lemon while I'm mixing everything together and I will add more sun dried tomatoes. Overall this is an amazing dish! Very healthy!

Surprisingly delicious! I used penne pasta instead of angel hair.  I was skeptical about the cilantro, but it actually made this dish very refreshing.  I only had plain feta, but I think it would be even better with the tomato basil feta.

This recipe is so yummy!! I used jarred sun-dried tomatoes in oil (used the oil from the jar instead of olive oil), artichoke hearts, fresh basil and parsley (instead of cilantro), and Greek olives. Like other reviewers I sauteed the garlic and tomatoes and  waited until the very end to add the feta. Definitely a keeper! Thank you!

Paired with a green salad, this made a satisfying meal for my husband and I. Will definitely make again. I didn't make an entire box of pasta, so just had to estimate amounts of ingredients and made some minor adjustments (as I do with most recipes). However, I believe the recipe would be very tasty as is.

My alterations:
- sauteed red onion (because I had it on hand) and pre-minced garlic (convenience) in 1 T. olive oil, then added sun dried tomatoes before adding pasta. 
- used low-fat plain feta and just added some dried basil to the pasta
- used whole wheat thin spaghetti. It adds a nice nutty flavor and fiber.

Hubby and I had this tonight for dinner.  It was yummy, although I think there were too many sun-dried tomatoes for hubby.  I had sun-dried tomatoes in oil, so I used  the oil from the jar for the olive oil the recipe called for.  Also I derped and bought regular feta so I added some dried basil too.

Delicious! I only changed a couple minor things.  I love jalapeno olive oil --so I did half of that and half of regular.  Also found a jar of sun dried tomatoes mixed with garlic so used that! and also added in a can of those natural green olives.  Yum-o!  it is hard to mix...just keep working it people.  Also little too much pasta ratio to goodies...so when I re-heated (which is still yummy-even better I think) I added a bit more feta (oh only used half the first time) and a bit more tomatoes and parmesan.  this is so good!

I thought this was great.  I cooked the onion etc a bit before blending.  I also added a few tomatoes and olives.  I think I would prefer basil over cilantro.  The cilantro wasn't bad but it just wasn't quite right for this meal.  I will make this again. 2nd time I added chicken broth, grilled chxn, and grape tomatoes and made a simmer sauce.  I used 1/2 cup of feta and a few splashes of oil.  Topped with some deli peppercini peppers and they were good. Just used some dry basil, no cilantro.

I added a small jar of marinated artichoke hearts to this and skipped the olive oil since they are packed in oil.  Very yummy.

Wow what a super easy dish.  Simply throw it all to together, the best part though is it tastes delicious.  I missed out the Parmesan, and added spinach and bacon.  Pretty sure I will make this again.  Thank you for sharing.

Very good! Great flavor. I added a small can of diced black olives to add more color and left out the cilantro, as the flavor is too bitter for me. A great meatless option.

This was very yummy!  I did follow some suggestions from others. I sauted the garlic and onion in olive oil and then added 1 can chicken broth with some fresh roma tomatoes.   Next time I would also get 2 pkg feta.  We don't like cilantro but I did add some pesto also.  Very good!

Love this recipe. Like others, I've made some adjustments both times I've made it (e.g., more garlic, using the oil from sun-dried tomatoes in oil, adding basil, sauteing most ingredients before mixing with pasta and cheeses)--but it's so easy and so flavorful. (I'll admit it, I'm a sucker for feta cheese.)

Good. I made it with asparagus. Blanch or steam the asparagus for a couple minutes. Not too long, I hate mushy asparagus. Added it into the dish in bite-size pieces. Added some olives too.

Delicious! I used spaghetti instead and parsley instead of the cilantro for a more mild and fresh taste. I also used less parmesan (1/2 cup) so it wouldnt be too cheesy or salty. I added a couple mushrooms and alot of garlic. I also used sun dried tomatoes in a jar with oil in them already. Will definitely make this again, super easy and very tasty.

I think I totally messed this up... too much pasta for sure. I added the cheese immediately while pasta was still hot, and it still refused to mix. I tried this recipe a second time because I'm looking for something like Olive Garden's Capellini Pomodoro, and it still just didn't have the right oomph. Based on other people's reviews, I would say its more my novice cooking skills than the quality of the recipe.

I gave this recipe just the way it is four stars.  With a few changes, it is definitley a five!  Here are the changes I mad.  1.) Sauteed the garlic and sun dried tomatoes in a pan for a few minutes before adding to pasta.  2.)  Omitted the Cilantro, I agree with another review that I think cilantro can be a bit overpowering, I substituted parsley.  3.)  I also stirred in about 1/2 cup fresh parmesan in with the hot pasta and other ingredients.  These few slight changes made it a definite keeper and a five star recipe.

As good (or better) than Olive Garden pasta entrees.  Only change was used twice as much olive oil (otherwise too dry).  Will try adding some chicken broth next time.  Also would be fantastic with cooked chicken breast strips added in.  Mmmmmm!

Sorry.  I think to make this good, you need to chose the best quality ingredients. It didn't have any sauce so it was just dry.  We ate it, but I won't make this again.

I followed the advice of some other reviewers and sauteed the garlic and the sun-dried tomatoes in olive oil before mixing them with the pasta. I liked the result, but, in the future, I would add some additional olive oil or use a different pasta, as it was very difficult to mix. I also felt that the recipe called for too much pasta, so I would either double the other ingredients (aside from maybe the feta) or reduce the pasta by 50%. The flavors all went well together, though the cilantro was a bit overwhelming. I added some shrimp, too, which I felt rounded it out nicely.

I made this tonight. It was very, easy and fast. My husband doesn't like cilantro so I used fresh parsely. I had dry sun-dried tomatoes (not packed in oil), so I softened them by soaking them in water for an hour. I used the soak water to cook the angel hair pasta. My husband liked the dish a lot. Thanks for giving the recipe. I'm sure I will make it again.

I made this with rotini because my partner likes a meatier pasta, olives, artichokes and half of the blue cheese crumbles. It was good hot but GREAT cold. Next time I make this, it'll be as a cold pasta salad.

The flavor of this dish was really good. I followed the recipe as written altho' I did not have the full 1lb of angel hair pasta which turned out to be a good thing.  There was WAY too much pasta for the amount of other ingredients with the 12 oz I used. It all kind of got lost in the pasta...Next time 6 oz of pasta and I think I will use fresh tomatoes out of the garden.  The flavor was good, though

Ok, I must admit, I had to make adjustments to a couple of ingredients due to lack of availability. I could not find Cilantro nor any other fresh Italian herbs for that matter. Also for sun-dried tomatos I used a sun-dried tomato PESTO.(in the pasta sauce aisle) I tell you- this came out DELICIOUS. My DH was blown away by how good it was. The smell was heavenly as well as the taste! So easy to make to, this can't be beat! This will become a weekly staple for sure!

This is fabulous. I didn't have any fresh cilantro so I let some dried cilantro sit in the olive oil for awhile. I also added a jar of artichoke hearts and a little juice, and a few sliced black olives from a jar. It was very very good and super fast. Great with some homemade crusty bread.

Ridiculously delicious. Best pasta I have made so far! I used bow tie pasta instead, since I am not a fan of angel hair- and also used fresh basil instead of cilantro. Perfect!

Recently started cooking and this dish was very easy to make. Cooking newbies, make sure you prepare the cheese mixture before the pasta's done so the heat of the pasta melts the cheese. :-)

sorry - but there has to be a mistake here.. 1/4 cp olive oil to a pound of pasta is not near enough..I did decrease the amount of pasta.. but i still had to add 1/2 stick of butter..also - be sure to crumble the feta small enough -- will not melt down . I did salvage the dish - but will not make again.

What a delectable dish!  I decided to combine the essences with an organic durum penne rigate and was pleased with the result.  The pasta quantity was 12 oz. instead of 16 oz. as the recipe calls for, so I reduced the amount of tomato basil feta to 3.5 oz. and used ½ cup of freshly shredded Parmesan cheesed instead of 1 cup grated. Perhaps on the next occasion I will roast the garlic and add cracked pepper; nonetheless, this recipe boasts an excellently light flavor.  I appreciate it greatly and will undoubtedly prepare again.

This is one of my favorite dishes, I usually add some chopped green olives and go a little heavier on the garlic but that is just a personal taste.  Love It! Definitely one of the best recipes on here.

Fantastic.  Have made this 3 times for company and it has been a hit every time.  My husband loves it (of course, I have to chop the tomatoes up very small for him to eat them) but all the flavors are amazing.  I didn't follow the proportions for the garlic, tomatoes, and cilantro - I just added what I thought would be enough (since the recipe seemed to call for too much, in my opinion and from the reviews of others).  But, this is definitely in my short list of items to prepare for company!  Excellent w/ duck breast!

I was very disappointed in this recipe and was very surprised after all the high ratings it received.  I would suggest using something besides angle hair pasta when making this so the ingredients will mix evenly, that was the main problem I had with this recipe.  I probably will not make this again, thanks anyways!

Great recipe!  I substituted the cilantro for basil and it came out great.  People at my house kept asking for a second plate!  The first time I made it I used linguini because I had no angel hair pasta around, however the second time I made it I did use angel hair and both of them were great. Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy!!  My husband and I LOVED this recipe!  I made a few changes that other users had suggested: used penne pasta, added the cheeses last, and I added sauteed mushrooms.  Very easy and quick to make!  I will definitely be making again and again and again...

Great Recipe.  My friends enjoyed.  It was a little bit difficult to mix but over all it was a great success.  I would minimize the amount of cilantro it can over power the meal.

This was great!  I also found it hard to mix, and it was way more pasta than I expected.  I had to keep switching to bigger bowls.  I could only find the sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil and I wasn't sure if I was supposed to rinse them or what.  I found them incredibly hard to cut.  I will leave them out next time, maybe I'll put some fresh tomatoes instead.  I will also cut the recipe in half.

It was pretty good the first night, but it was DELICIOUS the second day!  I did have some trouble getting it well-mixed, I think I'll try penne pasta next time to help that.  As others have suggested, I think I'll try roma tomatos too because it was a little pricey for an everyday meal.

Foolproof to make. I used regular tomatoes rather than sundried to cut down on meal costs, tasted great, and healthy too! Next time I'll try adding some spinach.

I LOVE THIS RECEIPE!!!  It's almost a crime that something this easy to make should taste so good.
I didn't measure any of the ingredients according to the recipe--just went by intuition.  Didn't have angel hair, so I used penne.  YUM YUM YUM.  Tasted great cold as well.

I'm not a big feta cheese fan.  I made this for my boyfriend because he LOVES feta cheese.  I asked him to rate it and he said a 7 on a scale from 1-10.  It is easy to make.  Infact, I mixed all the ingredients except for the pasta together the night before so I could take it to his place and just boil the noodles!

This had all the ingredients to be good, I just didn't like the melted down feta.  Next time I make this, and I think I'll make it again, I'll use less olive oil, add a little stock to keep the pasta moisten, squeeze a little time, then just sprinkle (less) feta and parm on top.

Needed a great deal of seasoning.  Stir cheese in slowly otherwise it will clump and make a mess.

Rating this ok may be me cooking is a challenge for me.I found it took me longer.I read you had to rinse then soak sun dried tomatoes so next time I will use in a jar.Then it was a bit bland so I added mushrooms I had to cut and saute.When I added my cheeses it got a bit gummy so I added a bit more olive oil and liquid.In the end it was good so I will be making it again.

So this was an amazing 5 star pasta recipe that only took 15 minutes to prepare. I did a couple of things differently from the recipe. First of all, I doubled the garlic and minced it. It was actually sautéed in olive oil with the sun dried tomatoes before tossing with the pasta. Regular crumbled feta worked out to be a perfect match. It was shocking to see how well the cilantro paired with this recipe. I strongly recommend this as it will not disappoint!

If I were to do this dish again, I would add about 1/2 of the feta, and double the olive oil! It was too dry, and the flavor of the feta was overwhelming for me personally.

This recipe is lacking something.  Some type of sauce would help.  When you toss everything together the feta and tomatoes all go to the bottom of the bowl.

Excellent recipe!! We loved it. The only thing I did differently was to add a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes  plus I substituted oregano for the cilantro. Both my husband and I think grilled shrimp on top would be amazing (we did not have any shrimp, this was just speculation).

Really tasty. Other than adding shrimp, which I did since my husband's not big on vegetarian dishes, the only suggestion I would make is to save the water from draining the pasta because you may want to add some as you're stirring things, to make it more "saucy." The flavor is actually even better the second day, when you can add some chicken broth if necessary for more liquid.

I am not a big cilantro fan, so I do this with fresh basil instead and reduced fat regular feta. This is kind of a base recipe that can be tweaked to taste, and I just love it!

This was ok. The only change I made was using penne instead of angel hair pasta. I felt that it was lacking something, but it's a good base recipe. I'll make some additions next time to suit my tastes.

I really enjoyed this.  Didn't have fresh cilantro -- used dried instead.  I decreased the amount of parm cheese, could reduce even more.  Not sure it needs both parm and feta.

So quick, so easy, so good.  I chopped everything while the water boiled and pasta cooked.  Subbed fresh basil for cilantro, used plain reduced fat feta.  Added crushed red pepper (I like spice), salt, black pepper.  Will try it with a squirt of lemon and artichoke hearts and bow tie pasta like some reviewers, but great recipe as is.  Hubby asked to add it to the rotation.

I made a number of changes to this due to necessity, and they weren't the kind that improves a recipe (less cheese! less tomatoes! dried herbs!) and this was still a 5-star recipe, provided you like feta and sun-dried tomatoes -- which we do. Thank you :=)

YUM! This was so easy to whip up for dinner. I added some rotisserie chicken I had from the store to the pasta. I didn't really use the measurements in the recipe, you can adjust it to your tastes. Enjoy!

Very delicious.  I used mini farfalle pasta, and used the oil from the jar of sun dried tomatoes rather than olive oil.  We hate cilantro, so I used parsley instead, and also added grilled chicken.  Everyone gobbled this up!  I had to add some chicken broth to the pot because with just the oil my pasta was really dry, but other than that, this was delicious!  I served it with homemade french bread and everyone had seconds! :)

I loved this recipe!  I, like a lot of the other reviewers, amended the recipe slightly.  I added artichokes and didn't used as much cilantro as suggested.  The sun-dried tomatoes that I purchased were a bit too sour for me, so I'll probably leave them out next time.  Also, with the large amount of pasta, I had to add more olive oil so that it wasn't too dry.  But I will definitely make this again.  It was even good the next day!

Made this dish tonight and my wife and three daughters thought it was fantastic. Served with a fresh salad and some oven-warmed Italian bread. - I followed the recipe pretty much to the letter, but improvised where the letter was not explicit. I chopped the garlic and sauteed lightly rather than crushing. After softening the sun-dried tomatoes I cut them in strips rather than chopping into little pieces. I think I used a little less parmesan than the recipe called for (it just looked like too much to me). The cilantro seemed an odd ingredient at first but it was a nice addition. I'm looking forward to making this again.

Okay, So i made this yesterday. Definitely an EASY recipe.  Only work that actually had to be done was chopping the cilantro & the tomatoes. The rest was pretty easy.  I put in 2 tbsp. of minced garlic that comes in a jar (it's a lot easier). I will make this again, but I'm gonna tweek it.. maybe add more feta or just make 1/2 a box instead.  It may be good with diced chicken in it too..  I think it needed salt, but I'm a salt finatic. My 3 year old ate 3 forks full (no surprise there) and my hubby ate his whole bowl AND my 3 year olds bowl, so I'm asuming he liked it! LOL   That's my review & I'm sticking to it!

Fabulous!  This has become a staple in our house.  Even my picky 4-year-old gobbles it down.  The cilantro really adds a wonderful flavor, but it's also good without it.  I do add a little more olive oil to make it a tad moister.

I think the recipe is just fine but don't you think if a recipe on this site has been saved over 9000 times it has been featured too many times? Come on allrecipes, give us some new stuff.

Awesomely easy dish to make.  Substituting fresh cherry tomatoes for sun-dried tomatoes works really well too.  I have a feeling this will become a family favorite.

Quick and Easy....and Good. I left out the cilantro but other than that did everything the same. I was VERY surprised that my 11 year old (picky eater #1) wanted seconds. He hates potatoes but likes Feta, who knew?! Oh, I also used the sundried tomatoes in oil.

I made this tonight to go with fish.  It is a simply wonderful versatile resipe that is very fast and easy and herbs and chees can be adjusted to your taste.  Please add lots of sun dried tomates, they really make this dish.

I have made this recipe at least 15+ times.  Everyone in the family loves it, including my 4 year old!  I put all of the ingredients in a food processor and it is ready in less than 5 minutes.  After boiling the pasta I then throw the mixture in a large pan/skillet to warm it and then toss in the pasta until it is coated.  I sometimes just make the mixture and use it on burgers or sandwiches as well.  This is delicious!

I made this recipe earlier this week for my girlfriend, subbing mozzarella for feta (she doesn't like it). It was fantastic! Can't wait to try with the feta on my own.

This is my husbands favorite.  I did make some changes though. I used basil, we don't like cilantro and added oil from the sun dried tomatoes, not just olive oil. He askes me to make to all the time.

I had this dish at a pot luck and I fell in love immediately.  I made it at home ... the only thing i'd do differently is to change the pasta .... it was too hard to mix the angel hair and it all seemed to clump up.  I WILL be making this again but will use a different type of pasta ... probably mini-pene.  Other than that, it was delish and easy!

i was pretty excited to make this recipe because it was so simple and sounded so delicious! I added some onions, tomatoes, white wine, mushrooms, and some basil and it was delish! until i added the feta cheese, i only had 6 oz of it and it was WAY to overpowering. i didn't even add any Parmesan because it was too salty.

I've been making this for several years, it's a family favorite! I prefer to use penne or spiral pasta because it makes mixing it easier, but the flavor is fantastic as written. I use sun-dried tomatoes that are packed in oil and I use the oil off the tomatoes for the recipe, but I don't think it makes a taste difference.

My family loves this dish. I modify it a little though. I don't like sun-dried tomatoes so I just throw in some fresh chopped tomatoes. I also substitute the cilantro with basil sometimes, they're both great. And it's SO easy!

This was delicious.  I followed earlier advice and made the following changes.
-Sauteed in olive oil the garlic, cut up artichoke hearts, greek olives (de-pitted), sun dried tomatoes, already cooked bite sized peices of chicken.  
-after about 5 min, added ~2/3 c. chicken broth and 2 TBS of white wine vingegar.  Simmered ~ 5 min
-Poured it over the pasta.  there was lots of liquid on the bottom, but after about 10 min the pasta absorded it.
All the flavors melded really well and it was a big hi!

I tried this recipe with penne and since I ran out of garlic (unfortunately) was forced to substitute with garlic powder.  I have a feeling that sauteing the garlic in olive oil will blend the ingredients together a little better so I may upgrade the stars later.  Simple recipe; like most Italian food, using simple, high quality ingredients make the dish.  Will try again, but will saute the oil, garlic and then for a brief period the tomatoes, before adding to the pasta.  I also used julienne cut sun-dried tomatoes from TJ's.

Fantastic taste!  My husband loved it and usually he prefers the meat to the pasta.  Not this time!  The noodles were a bit dry.  Next time I'll add more oil just to coat.

I made this as a side dish with pork ribs and thought it was pretty good but next time I will take several suggestions such as tomatoes in oil, add a little butter, and use basil instead of cilantro.  It did become a bit dry as it was cooling down.  I would suggest, if you can, keep it very warm.

my parents loved this recipe, i thought it was ok. perhaps it would be better to rinse the noodles after boiling, because mine stuck together and made it so hard to incorporate the other ingredients. fresh parmesan cheese is the way to go with this recipe, not the canned stuff! for those who dislike sundried tomatoes, which i found out i do, diced tomatoes would be delicious. try it and tweak it and make it your own!

I love this dish.  It makes the most awesome leftovers, it tastes so much better the next day, almost worth to make it the day before and heat it up later.   I used bowties instead of angel hair though, came out fantastic.  Even my family who claims they dont like feta loved this dish.  (Sometimes I just think men and kids say they dont like things when they've never had them.)

We LOVE it. I had doubts about the cilantro at first, and thought I'd substitute normal parseley, but I'm glad I didn't. If you really love garlic, and don't mind having garlic breath, try doubling the amount of garlic.

Great dish for a crowd! I kept the recipe as is, but added chicken breast pieces, some Italian spices (Basil, oregano, etc.), a little pesto & more feta. People are still asking for the recipe!

Excellent recipe.  I added artichoke hearts and it was out of this world.  As far as pasta goes, it was very light and didn't settle heavy in your stomach.  Will make again!

This is one of those recipes that is just excellent to start with but you can always improve it and make it your own.  I love this with artechokes and black or green greek olives.  I also dont use the sun dried tomatoes all the time.  I often replace those with canned diced tomatoes.  Drained.  This is a HIT with pot luck events.  I advise breaking the pasta if its long ahead of time.  I have also used a baby linguini and it works very well.  Dont over cook your pasta.  It shouldnt come out dry but if it seems dry add a bit more oil.  Also much of the flavor comes from the cilantro-- you could completely change this dish by using some fresh basil (although not as much as the cilantro) in it instead! Try it!!

I followed the lead of others and took the advice of TRIPLEJ28 and sauteed the garlic and onions. I also added yllw & grn squash, portabella mushrooms and sliced olives. Used red cooking wine instead of white and everything was perfect. My husband is actually taking the leftovers for lunch at work; something that he never, ever does.

Loved it!! 
It’s really easy and really good.  I also added artichokes cause I had them and I thought they would be a nice touch-- They were! It was perfect.  I used Trader Joe’s frozen artichoke hearts. Also, although I love garlic, I would use four small cloves instead of four large ones-- they were way too overpowering. One more thing, although the recipe calls for Angel Hair, I would use something closer to penne.  I’ve used both and the penne was way easier to mix.  Oh, and if you can’t find tomato and basil feta, it’s just as good to use the regular kind. In any case, this was excellent!  Will definitely make it again (well actually I already have...)

This recipe sound so delicious but like half the world I am watching carbs so I substituted the angle hair pasta for cooked spaghetti squash - I also added chicken breast that I sauted in some olive oil, white wine and a sprinkle of garlic salt. It was delicious so I can only imaging it would be even better with pasta!!!

Almost exactly what I was looking for! I (like others) made a couple of changes. I used orzo pasta and substituted spinach for the cilantro. I actually served this as a cold side salad with rave reviews! Perfect.

This was fast and delicious.  I used bow-tie pasta and instead of plain olive oil I used sundried tomatoes packed in olive oil and some of the oil they were packed in.  It has a wonderful flavor.  Used freshly grated parmesan, and went easy on the cilantro; added the cheeses
just before serving.

This recipe was a big hit at my house! The only thing that I would do diffrently next time would be to leave out the cilantro. It was too strong of a taste for this meal. Besides that it was awesome. I will definatley make this meal again. Great job Nicole.

What an excellent meal. I just made this tonight for me and my fiancee, and even though she isn't usually a huge fan of sun-dried tomatoes, she really loved this dish. Also, it was so quick to make! I threw the tomatoes and garlic in a food processor and had the whole thing cooked in about 10 minutes.

Good recipe!  I cut down the amount of cilantro just because one full bunch seems excessive.  It wasn't as pretty as I would have hoped for but it tasted very good.  My vegetarian friends enjoyed this one a lot!

This was great! My boyfriend and I both really enjoyed it. We had it with ceasar salad and garlic bread. The only thing I did differently was I used fresh basil instead of cilantro because we don't care for cilantro. It worked very well. Thanks Nicole!

This was really good!  I sauteed some mushrooms and added some crushed red pepper for some spice.  I also used regular light feta cheese becasue I couldn't find tomato and basil and put only half of the parmesan cheese.  This is a very simple and delicious dish.  Thanks.

Very easy to make.  A nice light dish that would make a great summer dish.  I omitted the salt, since there is so much in the cheese and cut the parmesan cheese in 1/2, which seemed like a good amount.  It is a little hard to mix, as previous reviewers have stated.  Like others, I added the cheeses last.  Tastes even better the second day!

I was VERY surprised at how much my family LOVED this. My husband groaned when he heard feta cheese, but boy did he come back for seconds. This has fast become a family Friday night favorite.
I did have to use plain feta, I couldn't get tomato and basil, and it worked great.
THANK YOU!!!!

I served this at a little-notice dinner party with great success!
I prefer making it using penne (or other bite-size) pasta since it is a bit easier to mix throughly. I also added chicken. 
The feta, parmesan, and sundried tomatoes go really well together.

I found the flavors to be rather strong.  Also came out very dry even though I tried adding more oil.  I think I'll keep my feta in my salads.

Recipe was easy to make and very good for a quick and enjoyable meal.  May wish to add baby green peas and prosciutto (ham) for extra flavor.

This recipe is so delicious!  I followed the advice of other's and used some chicken broth and white wine.  I also used fresh basil instead of cilantro and added some Kalamata olives.  I threw some sliced sautéed chicken breast on top with some fresh parmesan cheese.  YUMMY!

Substitute the cilantro with chopped or slivered fresh basil leaves, forgo the Parmesan cheese, use sun dried tomatoes already in oil rather than adding oil and softened sun dried tomatoes, add whole button mushrooms from a (gasp!) can, and use unflavored, regular feta cheese rather than flavored feta. Serve with generous amounts of wine, red or white (or both).

Yum! so good!  Added a can of chicken broth, a little white wine, some fresh basil and some Kalamata olives.  Added the cheeses at the end.  Used fresh angel hair pasta. Sauteed some chicken breasts in olive oil and garlic and sliced the chicken and served on top of the pasta.  So delicious!!!!!

Very easy and versatile. I changed quite a bit up. I used whole wheat thin spaghetti (I like the whole wheat, but there was no angel hair whole wheat pasta available). I used sundried tomato pesto instead of actual sundried tomato. I also used parsley, because I like the taste of it better than cilantro. Finally, I sauteed the garlic then tossed the parsley in it when the oil cooled to just warm. Then I added it all in with the pasta.

I would definitely make it again.  I was looking for something light without heavy sauces or meat for a hot summer day, perfect!  My husband the meat man liked it too!  I used some of the mentioned changes, sautéed onions and garlic, fresh basil and Roma tomatoes as well as sun dried.  I also used Asiago cheese in place of feta with the Parmesan.

This recipe is so versatile and easy! I like to use penne pasta instead of angel hair. I also add grilled chicken marinated in balsamic vinegar and Kalamata olives for a nice contrast. This is one of hubby's favorites.

No a fan! I have to say, I was really looking forward to this quick dish. I cooked it with chicken broth as suggested by other reviewers, and added basil. But the rest, I copied to a "T". The pasta was dry and the combination of cheeses had potential for a gourmet taste, but it really lack luster! Probably not making this again.

LOVED it.  Was a "little" dry but since I made a 1 serving portion of it, I may have been a little off in the oil estimation.  I ended up tossing some margerine on it and it was delicious.  Will definitely be making this again...

This was a great recipe!  I did alter it just a bit by leaving the cilantro out and adding asparagus.  I steamed the asparagus for just a few minutes, drained the water then added the garlic and sun-dried tomatoes.  After stirring that together I then added it to the pasta along with the other ingredients.  Next time I will add fresh basil to the top just before serving.  Can't wait to make this again!  Its such a fresh tasting dish.

I thought the flavor of this was really great. However I found it really hard to stir and need to add about twice as much olive oil for the amount of pasta suggested. Next time I will also double the sundried tomatoes. Its a good dish that just may need some tweeking to suit your needs.

Followed the exact recipe, but used fresh basil...didn't think the cilantro would go over well with the in-laws. :)  Everyone loved it!  I try to stay away from pasta/carbs, but this will be a temptation for sure.

Such a delicious blend of tastes! Restaurant quality. I used basil instead of cilantro. Also I doubled the amount of sundried tomatoes because they really make the dish. My feta cheese was plain. This will definitelly be made often!

I served this with "Tender Italian Baked Chicken" on Christmas eve for my hunny...DELICIOUS!
My modifications:
-I used the oil from the jar of sun-dried tomatoes
-I added a lot more oil than suggested
-Added in some additional seasonings. If you can find Tomato-Basil Mrs. Dash, it works perfectly
-Added in canned diced fire-roasted tomatoes 
-Sauteed the garlic first along with some shallots
Yum!

My husband said it was delicious...top restaurant quality pasta!  Made it with rotini cause that's what I had.  I added sliced kalamata olives and basil since I didn't have cilantro.  LOTS of taste!!!!

This was soooo good!!  I used double the ingredients to give it more taste because as others had said it was a little bland at first.  Ended up being super delicious!  Will totally make this again and also very easy to make.  My husband also loved it!

This recipe is AWESOME!  Very yummy and very easy to make!  I would not leave out the cilantro, but I don't think you necessarily need an entire "bunch."

This is really good.  I wasn't expecting all these ingredients to go well together.  I made it the first time with the sun dried tomatoes.  I left them out the second time I made it.  I replaced them with diced tomatoes (spicy).  It was a lot easier and cheaper than the sun dried.  I pan grill chicken breasts and serve with this pasta.  A staple in our house now.

This was so good! I followed advice from other reviewers and added a few more things; artichoke hearts, onions and olives. I also skipped the parm cheese (I totally forgot about it) and only had plain feta. This is a great recipe to play with!

This recipe was outstanding. I couldn't find the sun dried tomatoes I just bought at the store so I replaced them with a jar of sweet roasted red peppers. I also added about 2 tbsp of lemon juice b/c it was super dry without. Served with parmesan, green onion and fresh ground black pepper on top, YUM!

Just made this today.  Added a small can of sliced black olive and used an entire 10oz jar of sun dried tomatoes (we are big fans of the sdt).  Anyway, the flavor is great but as written, the dish was way too dry.  The oil called for did not seem to be enough.  So I added some of the oil from the sdt jar, and also squeezed in some lime juice and even had to add some pasta sauce.  Would definitely make this again, just need to solve the sticky dry pasta problem.

This dish was good - not great. It didn't really have a sauce - more like cheese and sun-dried tomatoes sticking to a sticky pasta. I realize this dish wasn't supposed to be saucy - but it was pretty dry. I guess I prefer saucier pastas! The dish also called for a LOT of pasta and I had leftovers for days.

To DIE for!!!  Definitely making this often!!!  Added chicken, onion, chicken broth, romas, bell peppers.
Like the cilantro, but can substitute it for parsley, and add extra basil.

This was really great. Full of flavour without a ton of sauce taking over. 5 stars aren't given out at our table very often, but when even the left overs given to family members gets a phone call and great review, it is deserving.

This recipe was really disappointing. I had high hopes based on that reviews and the fact that I love sund-dried tomatoes. I added chicken and sauteed broccoli, and even with those additions it was really bland. There was not special about this recipe. We ate it for dinner but threw away all the leftovers. My husband did not like it at all, but just told me it was ok because he didn't want to be mean. I will never make this again.

Very good and simple to make.  I did use 12oz bowtie pasta and soaked my sun-dried tomatoes in the olive oil (i did use a splash more oil just to submerge my tomatoes)  Putting into my supper rotation!

This pasta dish is awesome! I have an 11 month old and a 2 1/2 year old who just loved it, plus my husband! The store was out of sun-dried tomatoes, so I used some sun-dried tomato pesto. Will definately make again!

This was really good. My family liked it alot. My mistake: I bought the angel hair pasta used in fideo from the Hispanic food aisle. I thought it would be fine but it was very sticky. It's what I had on hand. I will buy regular angel hair pasta the next time.

This was ok...   I made it exactly as the recipe stated and didn't feel there was enough oil.  I'm not quite sure what was missing here..  I will likely not make again.

I have to say I was a little worried that this wouldn't have much flavor but this was SO good! I used sundried tomatoes packed in oil, because thats what I had but I otherwise followed the recipe exactly. This is an excellent no meat dish. The cilantro was a great addition, I was pleasantly surprised. This will be going into my regualr rotation.

This was a very good recipe. The only thing i would change is to add a tiny bit more olive oil. It was slightly dry when served warm. However the next day it was even better as leftovers.

Excellent dish!  Easy to make and tasted great!  We made this a few days ago.  We added mushrooms and zucchinis (which we sautéed first in a little bit of olive oil).  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  This is going to be one of our regular family menu items.

All around excellent recipe - great with chicken!

I went ahead and sliced up some chicken breasts and fried them in olive oil.  Then I just mixed everything (pasta, chicken, and cheese/tomato/oil mixture) together in one bowl and doled it out.

The tomato-basil feta is a must - it adds so much flavor to the meal.  If you can find it, it's definitely worth using.

Great recipe, I'll definitely cook it again.  My girlfriend loved it.

Um, I would not make this again.  My husband said he liked it, but I did not.  It was VERY heavy on the cilantro.  A whole bunch is WAY too much for my taste.  There are many other great greek-style recipes out there to try!

This dish was awesome!  I followed exactly but added more olive oil, some sliced kalamata olives, black pepper & a bit of sea salt.  My family loved this.  I'll definitely make this again.  It's super fast, too. I think this would be great with some shrimp or chicken to make a main dish.

I am giving this a 4 because I didn't really follow the recipe's serving suggestions.  I didn't really measure anything, just added things to taste.  Instead of sun dried tomatoes I used a can of Hunts diced basil, garlic, oregano tomatoes.  Instead of garlic cloves I used minced garlic.  I used an entire container of tomatoe basil feta cheese.  This came out wonderfully though.  The flavor was great and it was quick and easy to make.  I will definitely make this again.

My family just thought this was okay (kids just ate the noodles, which they really liked), but I thought it was better than okay.  I had never cooked with sun-dried tomatoes before so I wasn't quite sure what to do with them... I ended up soaking them in a little water and olive oil for about an hour.  Then while I brought the water to a boil, I marinated minced white onion with the garlic, olive oil, black olives, and threw in the sun-dried tomato mixture.  I just used one 12 oz. box of pasta because I didn't want to open another one; it was plenty for my family of 4 with lots of leftovers.  I had about a half cup of chicken broth in the fridge so I threw that in, as well as some grilled chicken we had the night before.  Finally, I didn't add the feta cheese because I wasn't sure if my 5 and 6 year old would like it.  I just set that on the table for those who wanted to top their pasta.  Oh, and I forgot to add the cilantro... kids probably would have picked that out too anyway! One last comment: My husband didn't like the black olives; he though green would have been a better flavor for the dish.  Overall, quick and easy and delicious.

This pasta is delicious! I don't like sun dried tomatoes so I added cooked bacon- it was AWESOME! I made this with the marinated grilled shrimp skewers on this website. This meal is what I call "company good"!

I thought it was fantastic and so did my meat-and-potatoes-loving boyfriend! It was a little dry initially, but I thinkthat was my fault. I had a hard time getting it mixed evenly. But as left-overs it was great..even cold!

I sauted the garlic as others suggested and used fusilli noodles. Great recipe, fast and easy. For leftovers I had to add a little oil since it was pretty dry the next day. I used dried sun-dried tomatoes and soaked them in red wine, added a nice flavor to the pasta.

Yum! I thought this was good, and I liked how fast it was to whip up. If you chop up the tomatoes and cilantro as the pasta is boiling, it only takes about 15 minutes to make. It is pretty garlicky if you follow the recipe though! Sauteing the garlic beforehand like others suggested would probably help if you're trying to avoid garlic breath.

This was REALLY tasty.  The flavor was exceptional but if you follow the recipe too closely then you're going to end up with some relatively dry pasta.  I used a bit of olive oil/butter to loosen up the noodles a bit.  I thought about using the oil that the tomatoes were packed in but I think it would've been too strong of a flavor.

After reading other reviewer comments, I sauteed onions with the garlic.  I added artichoke hearts, white wine, and chicken broth along with the sundried tomatoes to the pan and simmered.  It yielded great results, but my main complaint is that it ended up being a costly pasta recipe (at least for a grad student).  Adding up the cost of the tomato basil feta, sundried tomatoes, and artichoke hearts, this is by no means a cheap dish to whip up.

This tastes fantastic, but it's too dry.  I soaked the sun-dried tomatoes in water and added the water with them, but that still wasn't enough moisture.  Extra oil would probably take care of the problem, but the fat level in this recipe is already higher than I prefer.  When I ate it right after it was made, it was only slightly dry, but once it cooled a little it was really a problem.  I like to make extra and eat the leftovers the next day, and I had to add liquid (I used milk) later when I reheated it.  I want to make this again because it tastes great, but I'm going to have to figure out what sort of liquid to add.  Oh, and I used basil instead of cilantro.

How yummy this dish was!! The only thing I did differently than the recipe was I added a handful of chopped toasted English Walnuts for some *crunch* and a little bit of a nutty flavor! Excellent!!

Huge hit at my house, and so easy to make! To save some extra time, I threw my sundried tomatoes into the water when I added the pasta and this softened them up perfectly. Next time I'll be breaking the angel hair in half as well as running cold water over it as it was difficult to serve without the pasta breaking too much. My husband requested it again just three days later! Might also try this with goat cheese.

This was really good.  I sauteed the garlic in the oil and then simmered with the tomatoes, a can of artichoke hearts, some white wine and  basil instead of cilantro.  It tasted incredible but the pasta (I used bowtie) seemed a little pasty.  I'm not sure if that was the cheese or maybe the artichokes.  I will add the artichokes at the end next time without heating them and also may add some chicken broth as another reviewer did to increase the liquid.  Will definitely make again.  Also - doesn't need the salt.

I loved the strong olive oil and garlic flavors of this recipe.  The only trouble I had was mixing all the ingredients into the angel hair at the end.  Next time I'll just put them on the top of the pasta instead of trying to mix it in.

This dish was...interesting.  I just didn't think the flavors jived.  I think it was the cilantro that threw me.  I added sauteed shrimp, I couldn't see eating this without that added touch.  Not one of my favorites though, I don't think I will make this one again.

Excellent - made it with a bit of red pepper flakes and oregano and parsley instead of cilantro.  Added a bit of lemon juice too.  Served with steamed spinach  and it was excellent.

This recipe is a good base. I added sauteed shrimp as well. I agree that the pasta is hard to work with! You'll need to either leave in a tablespoon or so of the pasta water (as other reviewers stated) or maybe serve up the pasta and then just top it with the feta/tomatoes rather than trying to mix it in. I think the recipe is off when it calls for a "bunch" of cilantro. Unless in Texas a "bunch" is bigger and better than other areas! ha ha I used about 1/8th of a bunch which once chopped was a small handful. This recipe reminds me of the beginnings of a sun-dried asiago pasta recipe I got off this site and love.

Good flavors, but mine was dry and needed some crushed or sauted hot pepper and more garlic.  Will try sun dried tomatoes packed in oil the next time and the triplej28 suggestions.

this is really good and easy. the only problem i had was that the noodles stuck together. i probably should have rinsed them with cold water, but then they're not hot anymore. but this is really tasty and easy to modify as far as how much of each ingredient you use or what kind of pasta.

This recipe was ok. I expected it to be to-die-for considering all of the fantastic ingredients. It came out a little too olive-oil tasting, I might use half butter next time. I also didnt have cilantro, not sure how much that alters the taste. I served this with grilled chicken as a side and I would probably make it again as something different.

there was way too much pasta!  It turned out pretty dry.  Although, there is definite potential here.  Maybe a little less pasta, or more oil.  It was very flavorful and if I messed around with the recipe, like a lot of the reviewers have, I'm sure it would turn out much better.  As the recipe is now it's only 3 stars, it was just way dry.

I made this for my family last night and everyone loved it. I didn't know to soften the sun-dried tomatoes in oil, however, so they were rather hard. Next time I'll cook them separately with some mushrooms in oil and then I'm sure the recipe will be perfect!

This was very easy to make.  I used the sundried tomatoes packed in oil and took another reviewer's advice and used some of the olive oil from the tomatoes in addition to regular olive oil.  I forgot to buy cilantro but thought it was great anyway.  Extra olive oil helped me mix everything together.

Delicious and easy. I used some ideas of other reviewers so I added sauteed mushrooms and grated Romano cheese along with the feta and Parmesean. I also used fresh basil and sun dried tomatoes packed in olive oil packed. I put a little of the oil from the tomatoes in, too.

the taste was good, but the delivery of the taste was all wrong... I followed many of the suggestions, mixing everything together then adding it to the noodles, but it still just didn't work out the way i wanted. Should I find a better way, I'll be sure to let you all know.

I used the oil from the jar of tomatoes and sauteed the garlic and some mushrooms.  I'm not one for pasta with no sauce, but this was excellent.  Great combo of flavors.  Used basil instead of cilantro.

This is great. I tried to make it a bit healthier by using whole wheat pasta and less olive oil, and then bumping up the flavor with fire-roasted (smokey-flavored) sun-dried tomatoes.

Excellent! This recipe was a hit at a recent family gathering.  I modified in the following way with incredible results!  

1. Added minced serrano peppers for a little spice.

2. Sprinkled the cilantro and added a little mozeralla on top then put in the oven at 200 for about 15-20 min.  This produced a nice effect with melted cheese and added color for serving.

Great recipe - thanks a million!

I would make this again.  It was quick and easy.  I might omit the oil because it seemed to have a pool of oil on the dish when we were eating.                                                                                            5/03  I made this again last week.  Threw in cooked and diced chicken, sliced black olives and sauteed mushrooms.  Husband liked it this way and said to make it again.

Excellent pasta recipe.  My husband said it tastes like a restaurant meal.  Even the kids ate it up.

Great flavor, but not so easy to mix.  I added more olive oil but still had trouble mixing.  The cheeses seemed to clump together. I mixed and mixed until my pasta was just bits and pieces.  No one else seemed to have this problem, so it must have been something I did wrong.  Any suggestions anyone?  Overall though quite tasty; will try again.

We all enjoyed this dish very much.  I thought I would have trouble with the sundried tomatoes but, they were great. The combination of chesses were very tasty.  Great dish, fast. Garlic bread and a green salad went well.  A dish we will eat over and over again.

Iused peeled and chopped fresh roma tomatoes and briefly sauted the garlic, then added just a little goat cheese. It was great! My TEENAGE boys ate it up and said "keep this one".

I made this dish for my boyfriend on his birthday- he absolutely loved it.  I made a few changes, though- Instead of cilantro, I used basil.  I added pine nuts & more roma tomatoes. I thought the feta was great- I wouldn't take it out. This recipie has become one of my alltime favorites

This recipe was easier than making macaroni and cheese!!  It was so flavorful.  It has become my husband's favorite pasta now!  I forgot to buy the cilantro but it turned out great!

My husband, 9 yr old son and I love this recipe.  My 4 yr old daughter is not a big fan of feta.  The only thing I do differently is to saute the garlic (I use more than four cloves) in olive oil before I add it to the recipe.  Delicious.

My husband LOVED this.  His mother, who owns a pasta restaurant, is going to add this to her menu with shrimp.  I thought it was pretty good, but the ingredients don't mix in well with the pasta, it kind of lumps together.

The flavors blend together very well.  The sundried tomato flavor can be a bit sharp.  I added half the amount of tomato.  Really, a very good recipe.
