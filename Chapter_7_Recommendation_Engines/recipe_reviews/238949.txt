Made as written but I think it could use the entire block of cream cheese and some cumin (at least a teaspoon) to turn it from an Italian alfredo sauce to a Mexican cheese sauce. Great recipe though and one that is easily adaptable to suit your individual taste!

I added some cumin and some chili powder. It's still lacking something not sure what though but is was tasty even still.
