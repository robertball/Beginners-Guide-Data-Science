I thought this recipe was GREAT, the 4 star rating was for the few modifications I made. In response to the other reviews I did double the sauce. To cut some fat I used milk but in place of the cream I used fat  
free evaporated milk (same measurements) I used smart balance in the sauce and butter for the shrimp. In place of  just parm. I used a  pre-shredded blend in the deli section of parm. romano, and asiago. I love garlic so I added a little extra and went easy on the pepper and hot sauce because I was also serving this to my picky kids. This had a nice kick but wasn't too hot. I used fresh broccoli and pesto (I loved the flavor and I don't think just fresh basil would   have had the same affect)Lastly I made the sauce a few hrs. in advance and I think that may have been a good thing as I discovered the flavors had a chance to blend and tasted better after some time. ( another reviewer had mentioned it was good reheated)All in all I was a great hit and will be made again!

So good, I'm craving more!  I followed everything pretty much except I didn't use the pesto, I didn't have any on hand and don't think I missed it. I also at least doubled the garlic amounts as we love our garlic too.  I always double the sauce recipes on anything I make since we are all sauce eaters and don't like dry food, and I'm glad I did, it was just enough.  Boy, is this ever good and you can change out the shrimp or broccoli for other things very easily as well.  This is easy and great enough for entertaining.

This is a great recipe! I used mini penne pasta instead of the angel hair and omitted the pesto and used fresh basil. I also put the broccoli into my pasta water for about 3-4 minutes for time saving. I bought peeled cooked shrimp and sauteed for aprox. 3-5 mins. in the garlic and butter. If you like a lot of sauce, you need to add more of the milk and heavy cream. My kids ate every bite!!!

When I read the reviews for this recipe I noticed that the people who had problems with it were the ones who fiddled with it, especially with the liquids. There is a reason for the heavy cream, it's a natural thickener.  I made this recipe following the directions and using the same ingredients with the excepton of broccoli, I have a husband who will not come to a table with broccoli on it, he calls it B-Coli.  The recipe was wonderful and it is a keeper. Thanks for submitting it.

This recipe is absolutely awesome!!  The sauce is wonderful, creamy and tasty.  I used bow-tie pasta, fresh broccoli and frozen shrimp.  If you use frozen shrimp, just heat it with the broccoli for a couple of minutes until it's hot.  Only one word of caution.  You may want to melt the butter and add the flour over low heat, not medium.  I burned the first batch of butter and flour because I used medium heat.

Fantastic recipe! The cream sauce is to die for... loved the addition of the pesto. I made this for my son's 18th birthday. Everyone loved it... definitely a recipe that will impress your guests. I did a couple things differently... I doubled the sauce as suggested by another reviewer and used 2% milk (along with the cream) instead of whole milk. Oh, and I used only 1 t. of salt, just in the sauce... the shrimp didn't need any. Thanks so much Robbie for this great recipe!

this was a little time consuming but after tasting the sauce I couldn't believe how good it was and well worth it. I recommend doubling the recipe for the sauce though. I will make again

This was ok. Use fresh broccoli instead of frozen and cut down on the salt.

This was a hit!!  I followed the suggestion to double the sauce and make it ahead of time and that was an awesome suggestion.  I used whole milk and half and half since I didn't have cream.  Worked well.  I also steamed fresh broccoli instead of frozen.  Other than that just followed the recipe as written and it was great.  A perfect company dish.  We will be having this again.  I served it in my Southern Living large red pasta bowl and according to my husband it looked like something the Barefoot Contessa would serve!!!  Thank you for sharing.

I loved this recipe, but could only give 4 stars because of my changes.  I don't like broccoli...so I omitted it.  I reduced the amount of pepper and added a bit of white wine to the sauce.  Be careful because it does thicken quickly.  Also I omitted the Worcestershire sauce, just didn't have any on hand.  Will make again with my changes, thanks for the post.

Great recipe.  We made it a little spicy with some red pepper flakes and let the sauce thicken up a bit.  It was delicious!

I didn't follow recipe exactly.  Used cooked shrimp and just added it to sauce at end. Used 1% milk and half and half cream, whcih wasn't heavy enogh.  Other than that,  followed recipe.  We needed double the sauce.  It was still good but not great.

The family loved this dish! It's an alfredo dish without the richness. The only thing I did different was fat free milk & half & half. I also doubled the sauce. My son and husband remarked that it tasted just like Applebees' Chicken Alfredo Pasta Bowl. This is definitely a keeper.

Very nice. My only recommendation is to use fresh pasta, broccoli and substitute a portion of the parm with a bit of asiago and havilah for a fuller flavor sauce.

fixed this for dinner last night. followed the recipe exactly except i left the salt out (can salt my own if it needed it, and it did need it lol). i enjoyed it. a dash of hot sauce and a dash of worcestershire wasnt enough to really be able to tell they were even in the dish.. so next time i might do a teaspoon of each and see how it is like that.. reheated some leftovers for a late lunch today and i was expecting it to separate like most white pasta sauces do, but it held together perfectly. tasted as good as it did last night when it was fresh and no greasy butter trails running down my chin.  i think it would also go great with asparagus in place of the broccoli so i might try that next time. definitely a keeper. cant wait to cook it for my husband!

Excellent recipe. My husband LOVED it.  Followed some reviewers and added red pepper, and used fresh basil in lieu of pesto. We like it cheesey, so added quite a bit extra Parmesan. Also, saved myself an extra pan by partially defrosting broccoli and tossing it with the pasta during the last few minutes of cooking.  A definite keeper.

Made this for Valentines Day dinner and it was good. Very rich. Took others suggestions and doubled the sauce--good thing i did or it would of been a tad dry--the sauce is what makes this recipe. I wouldn't recommend using any other pasta w/ this dish as you need something very light and not heavy so don't substitute here. This is a very filling dish so just a light tossed salad is enough to go with it.

to save time/dishes:  cook broccoli with pasta for the last couple of minutes of cook time on the pasta.  I toss my shrimp in a bowl with seasonings and a touch of olive oil and bake on a parchment lined cookie sheet and broil until pink

The shrimp was good, the sauce was great, but the recipe called for too much pasta and it diluted the sauce's flavor.

I usually never succeed a meal when I follow a recipe.  But this is not true with this recipe.  I was so easy to follow.  Plus it was excellent.  The spices in it were perfect.  I really recommend this recipe!  It was soooo good.  And it was even good the next day, warmed up.

As written - 4 stars w/a couple modifacations - 5 stars.  As suggested by other reviewers I doubled the sauce recipe.  However, I think that if I hadn't thickened the sauce as much that a single batch would have supported the angel hair pasta.  With a thicker sauce you could almost use an alfredo noodle. I used fresh broccoli and precooked shrimp because that's what I had on hand. A quick heating in the hot butter w/garlic was all that was needed to get them ready for the dish.  My husband & I both really enjoyed the dish but agreed that next time I make it I'll add a bit more garlic to the sauce .  When you took a bite that didn't have any shrimp or broccoli it was a bit bland.  I'll definately make it again & consider it a restaurant quality dish.

I love this combination of ingredients!!!  Shrimp, broccoli, garlic and pasta...wow! I did cut back on the amount of angel hair and kept the sauce ingredients about the same, a little extra pesto and garlic , but very minor changes...yummy!!

For the exquisite taste, it was very inexpensive.  Most of the ingredients I had already laying around!  It was quick and easy, and was full of flavor, I will make this recipe again and again.

Essentially, this is a great recipe but as some stated, increase the sauce amount. Also, I have to tell you, as an Italian woman, I would never cook angel hair for 8 to 10 minutes---you would have a pasta that was rubbery and overcooked. Angel hair should be done in about 4 minutes or less! The photo of the recipe shows regular spaghetti--at least, that is what it looks like to me.

I followed the recipe exactly other than substituting regular cream for the heavy cream which I didn't have. Tasted good overall. My BF and I liked it, but I think it needed a little something. I ended up adding A LOT more hot sauce to my portion. Much better!

This is a stellar recipe - it was so good - but be prepared if you want to serve everything together and serve it all hot.  I needed some help from DH to keep the pasta, shrimp, broccoli  and sauce all going at the same time. I will make this again, but will be more mindful to have the ingredients ready to go.  This recipe moves fast because so much of it cooks in about 5 minutes.  (I doubled the sauce.)

This dish was a hit with my family. I followed advice of others and skipped the heavy cream and pesto (don't even know what that is). I doubled up the milk. Wonderful taste. The sauce thickens up to fast though. All in all loved this recipe I will use it again. When I make it again I will make extra creamy sauce. Thanks

made this dish tonight & it came out GREAT! at first i thought the cream sauce was too salty when i tasted it while cooking, but once it simmered more & mixed  over the noodles, shrimp & broccoli - DELISH! i agree w/other reviewers that its an impressive dish, easy-to-make, and gives you an excellent cream sauce versatile enough for other dishes.

Delicious meal!  I used fresh broccoli in place of frozen, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The cream sauce was creamy, but not too rich and oily to enjoy.  The flavors all blended wonderfully!  We all enjoyed this recipe.

This was very tasty.  My whole family enjoyed this from my 16 month old & 6 year old (who just ate the pasta and sauce) to my husband who had seconds.  I did not have pesto but I did add a little bit of basil to try to bring that flavor to the dish.  I used fresh broccoli and cooked it in the microwave - much easier.  I will save this recipe and make it many times again.  Thanks!

OUTSTANDING CREAM SAUCE!My hubsand ate 2 plates and still asking for MORE. I cannot wait to SHOW OFF this special dish again-for friends. I made a few adjustments(1.SEASONED the cream sauce to taste & left to simmer 2.SEASONED the shrimp prior to sauteing w/olive oil & garlic,then mixed the reserve juice from the sauted shrimp & garlic w/the pasta to enhance the taste). Final step -Slowly mixed in cream sauce w/the pasta & served w/garlic bread. seasoning used:Creole season or Season All.

My only suggestion for this recipe is to double the sauce ingredients. It's just a personal preferance. But it's an excellent dish.

This makes a lot.  I recommend scaling to 4 servings and then decreasing the pasta even more to 6 ounces.  The chopped fresh parsley was not just for color, it adds an important touch to the flavor, so don't leave it out.  I will make it again.

Perfect amount of pesto, liked the addition of the worcestershire sauce. The white pepper was too spicy, will need to use less or use black pepper. Did not add the hot sauce. This is the pesto cram sauce recipe we will use.

I made this for a St. Nicholas Day dinner party for my parents and my friends last week, and it was such a hit!! I was nervous about making the white sauce (I get really paranoid about burning things) but fortunately had someone else to help and whisk/stir the sauce. Eventually though she was put to work in other areas, and we turned the heat down a bit and stirred occassionally. I followed the recipe exactly except for the type of pasta used (I had linguine on hand). It was so flavorful and easy to throw together. I paired it with an Italian salad, a light chardonnay, and carrot cake cupcakes for dessert. I will definitely make this again! Easily a new favorite dish to make for guests!

Kind of bland: partly because of the tossing of all the components at the last minute which makes the dish lacking in flavor unity and complexity, and partly because of the lack of spices and herbs. I would suggest adding black pepper, nutmeg and lemon zest and a dash of lemon juice for instance.

This is fantastic! I took suggestion to double the sauce, which is a must. I deboned a store bought rotisserie chicken in place of shrimp and used penne pasta in place of angel hair. Definately let the sauce rest a while to allow the ingredients to meld and the sauce to thicken.

This was my first time ever having pesto or serving it to my family.  Both my husband and I loved it. I used half n half instead of cream, but I know with cream it would have been even better.  I did make extra sauce, multiplied it by 1.5 and it was the perfect amount.

So, I followed everybody's advice and doubled the sauce recipe, WAY too saucy.  I thought that the sauce was bland, all I could taste was a hint of pesto.  I will NOT be making this again.

Great recipe used 2% milk instead of whole, didn't have pesto so used basil instead, used fresh broccoli and added mushrooms as well.  If you like creamy, this is the recipe for you.  I felt it was a bit too heavy but it is a cream sauce =P

This was good, but I did change a few things. I had to use frozen shrimp because I just can't get fresh shrimp in Iowa in January. I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen, fresh garlic, and a lot less salt. We liked it and will more than likely have it again.

This dish was delicious. I would make less angel hair as it seemed I ended up with too much noodle. I would make the sauce the day bfore. We had left overs and the sauce was even better the next day. Lots of steps in making so dividing the chores would be easier too.

Made this last night exactly just like the recipe with a few minor changes. I used lemon juice, butter, and black pepper to saute the shrimp (no salt used). When I tasted the sauce, I thought that it wasn't going to taste good. Once I mixed everything together...wow! Tastes better than the store bought shrimp and pasta.

Really good! I left out the broccoli since I was out. I made my own pesto from another poster (Easy Pesto recipe by Rebecca Jane Thompson). Instead of toasting almonds in oven I used a stovetop pan and it was just as good! You could easily sub. chicken if your family doesn't like shrimp. I will make this again!

Was looking for a lower calorie/fat version of my favorite Ultimate Shrimp Scampi  from this site and thought I'd try this creamy style.  Sorry, this just didn't do anything for me as I found it was very bland.

Very good.  Next time, I'll probably add more salt to the sauce (or a little wine).  I used Old Bay Seasoning instead of salt to cook the shrimp.  Wish I had thought to serve garlic bread on the side.

Really enjoyed this recipe. I would highly recommend doubling the sauce. I had a ton of pasta leftover with very little sauce. The sauce thickened nicely but i did have to double up on alot of the ingredients for extra flavor.

This was great...I did use Tiger sauce, as the hot sauce, has good flavor and not just 'hot.' Also, being a cajun gal, I added 1 teaspoon of tony's cajun seasoning to the shrimp when cooking them. I used fresh mushrooms instead of brocolli, and whipping cream instead of half and half...GREAT!

This is very bland if you follow the recipe. I changed it up a little by doubling the sauce (as recommended by previous reviewers) and added more of the pesto, fresh garlic, and worcestshire sauce. It turned out so much better. I didn't use broccoli (didn't have any) so I used tomatoes instead. I added the tomatoes in at the end. I love cilantro so I used that as well. To make it a bit healthier, I substituted butter for Smart Butter and used half and half instead of heavy cream. I sauteed the shrimp just a little bit, then added the shrimp to the sauce and simmered it all for about 45 min. Also, I used thin spaghetti instead of angel hair pasta. Nice, easy recipe. Tweak it up a bit and it's a tasty dish!

I made this recipe for my husband and our friends and they all though it was great!  Only 2 things I would have changed.. 1) cooked the noodles closer to the time we were going to eat them, they were all sticky and 2) I would cook the sauce a little less, it wouldn't be so sticky if it wasn't so thick.  Otherwise it was great!! The shrimp is awesome!!!

EXCELLENT!!! Thanx Robbie! The second time around (it was so good the first time)Doubled the sauce, dumped the broccoli (not a huge fan), decreased the pesto, (rather strong) and used the left-over sauce with pasta. A great seafood side dish

This was a fabulous and EASY recipe!  To make it quicker I did some of the prep work earlier in the afternoon... like the broccoli.  I steamed it and put it in the fridge until needed. The only thing I would suggest is to NOT toss the broccoli and shrimp with the pasta, but to serve it over the pasta and then add the sauce.  I think it would be a prettier presentation.  Also - we live overseas and can't get pesto so I just added a TBS of dried basil instead and it still turned out GREAT!  Definitely a do-over for me!

Good, but bland. Definately needs some extras to help lift the flavor, but the base is good. Strangely we didn't even taste the garlic with 6 large cloves in there. I would make it again, but with a few additions to jazz it up a bit.

I liked it. You definitely need to double the sauce or there wont be enough.

UMMMM GOOOD!!!. I am by no means a "Martha Stewart" but I must say, I felt like Ms. Child's...lol!  Quick, easy prep and best of all easy. Everything that the positive comments said where true, I was a bit hesitant but so proud of myself after I made this meal. My hubby really  enjoyed it and yes, I will make this for one of our get togethers!

I really dislike giving a recipe from this site a poor review, but this recipe has a lot to be desired. My husband and I enjoy eating everything in this dish, but it was very bland. Nothing came together to make it enjoyable. I kept adding spices, hot sauce, etc. to the sauce and nothing did the trick. This dish was edible, but definitely will not prepare this again. If you want a great alfredo sauce, check this site for just the alfredo sauce. Now that is to die for.

Delicious flavors - restaurant worthy! The pesto is a must, I also used evaporated milk instead of the cream and it turned out perfect. Can't believe I actually made sauce this good! Thank you!

Literally everything about this dish is great! I don't feel as though it's too heavy like some other pasta dishes with cream and every bite was just awesome. I've also made this using other proteins and it's still great!

This was a yummy recipe and so easy.  I used fresh broccoli, only one half of the salt, and next time I will use smaller shrimp instead of the jumbo.  I didn't have heavy cream so I used half and half and 1% milk instead of whole milk.  Also, I used a basil pesto sauce.  There is only my husband and me, but I made the 6 servings and we had leftovers for only one time.  My husband says it's a keeper!

OMG! This recipe is going to go to the TOP of my pasta recipes.  I prepared it as stated.  Next time I may add fresh baby spinach into the colander & 'cooking it' by pouring the boiling pasta water over it... My thanks to Robbie Rice for this delish recipe.

This was a delicious and elegant meal and easy except for timing everything right. I didn't use pesto or parsely, as I didn't have them on hand. I did add a touch of lemon juice and more parmesan and garlic than called for.  Its a delicate dish and I think the pesto would have overpowrered the other ingredients. We all loved it. I doubled sauce recipe and will try the leftovers tomorrow on Chicken.

This was a great recipe.  Tasted wonderful.  The only thing I might do differently is use a little less pasta, so there is more of the delicious sauce on each bite.

Definitely not any easy fix - I had four pans going at one point.  I also accidentally added too much pasta, so the flavor was a bit diluted.  I will definitely try it again, though!

This was excellent! I doubled the sauce and used frozen garlic from Trader Joe's to cut down on the prep time. Took some time but worth the effort! Will definitely make again!

Makes a nice cream sauce.  Pretty tasty.  I followed the recipe with the exception that I used skim milk and half/half, since that was all I had.  I left out the last tea of salt for the shrimp, was pretty salty already and was glad I didn't add the extra salt.  I will make again.

The white pepper is overbearing, and I only used Half of the recommended dose. Too salty. Would use less than 1 tsp when sauteeing the shrimp in butter. Overall, not my favorite and would not make again.

Delicious!  I made the sauce as is with one exception- I didn't have any hot sauce so I used 1/4 teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes.  Next time, I'd drop it to an 1/8 teaspoon, as my 8-year-old said it was too spicy for him (and he usually likes spicy).  Others have suggested doubling the sauce.  I think even just making 1 1/2 times the sauce would be plenty, but if you end up with sauce leftover it is definitely not a bad thing.  Will be making this again soon!

I just made this a few weeks ago, but I am making it again because it is FABULOUS! Actually I didn't even put in the broccoli and it was still great. I doubled the sauce after reading other reviews but that is the only change I made. It makes a great sauce that isn't too "heavY" like alfredo is. Awesome!

Fan-flipping-tastic!! For health purposes, I used evaporated milk instead of cream. Since I cook for my pre-schooler and I, the hot sauce was eliminated. To make this recipe budget-friendly, I used a 4 oz package of small, pre-cooked frozen shrimp.

Just had this for dinner and it was very good.  I simplfied the instructions by cooking the shrimp first, removing them from the heat, then cooking the sauce in the same pan.  One less pan to clean is always a good thing!

I thought this was very tasty, but that the sauce was a little thick for my liking.  It was more like an alfredo than a traditional scampi sauce.  Will definitely make again, but I will dilute the sauce more next time.

This recipe was great!  I subbed half and half for the heavy cream, used whole wheat flour instead of regular, black pepper instead of white, omitted the parsley, and used fresh broccoli.  These modifications were only due to ingredients I didn't have on hand.  I for sure will make it again, just not often due to the high fat content.

This dish was so easy to make, and I had most of the ingredients, except the pesto and fresh parsley, on hand. I substituted with dried parsley instead. I had medium sized, fresh shrimp and fresh broccoli that I needed to use, so this recipe was perfect. I, too, doubled the garlic, of which I used more than half to saute with the shrimp. I added an extra half cup of heavy cream and used bowtie pasta, and I would've never imagined that the dish would turn out soo good! Even my 5 year old daughter asked me to make this again.. something she has never done before. I highly recommend this recipe! Thanks Robbie!

Made this for a party that had some homemade food and some catered.  This was the favorite dish of the night.  Used extra of the following - whole milk, garic, grated cheese and hot sauce.Substituted half and half for cream.  Made the broccoli the day before, and the sauce and shrimp a few hours earlier.  Put the broccoli in the colander and poured the hot macaroni water over to reheat.  Put the sauteed shrimp, broccoli and macaroni in a big dish and poured the reheated white sauce right over it.  So, so good.  Looks like a gourmet meal.

Very good.  Even my kids liked it.  I recommend starting the sauce at the same time as you start to boil the water.

I thought this was great. The sauce was great and had lots of flavor. Next time I'll probably leave the broccoli out of it as my wife didn't care for it. (She does like broccoli though)

This was Fantastic!  I agree that you need to double the sauce.  I did not double and REALLY wish I had.  I put a few more dashes of hot sauce and worcestershire and added more garlic and cheese. Will definately make again and again.  I did make the sauce ahead of time (a few hours) and reheated with no issues.

A very good recipe which does use a lot of pots. I used 1 1/2 cups of 2% milk and 1/2 cup of whole milk (no cream) - just be careful if you do this not to heat the mixture on high heat and whisk while heating (to prevent separation). I used 1/4 cup of fresh parmesan, and grated more on top of the plates before serving. I used fresh broccoli and tossed the sauce in with the pasta, broccoli and shrimp. Will make again.

Wow.  Fantastic.  The only thing I changed was penne from angel hair.  I like the way the sauce collects in the penne pasta.  My family LOVED this and my 16 year old ate two helpings as did my husband, who always just eats one helping of anything!  Thanks for sharing...regular rotation...you bet!

Excellent dish.  I did not have pesto sauce so just add basil instead, worked great!  Next time I will change to a different type of pasta.  Maybe bow tie or shells.

I wouldn't call this "quick" but it is a very tasty dish and worthy of the time to prepare.  My 22 year old son wanted to try it and we even prepared it together.  We cut the broccoli into smaller pieces since he's not the biggest broccoli fan, and we  combined the sauce with shrimp/broccoli and then spooned it over the pasta.  It was elegant.

Pretty good.  Tasted like a nice alfredo pasta dish.  The sauce thickened rather quickly though.  For the portion we didn't eat right away, I thinned out the sauce by mixing some chicken broth and olive oil into the sauce; tasted rather nice.

This is a great recipe, no complaints about that. I even substituted fat free evaporated milk for the cream to lighten it up a bit, and it was still tasty. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it took several pans to get this dish going, and I would increase the amount of broccoli next time.

This was great--definitely restaurant quality.  I did double the sauce, however, and was happy that I did so because it wouldn't have tasted so good otherwise.  Also, since it was just my bf and I eating all that food, I couldn't bear the thought of letting all that delicious meal go to waste (I figured the reheating value wouldn't be that great) so I packed it up and took it over to my mother at work--she loved it too!  Next time I have company I will make this dish.

Wow!! Loaded with delicious garlic flavor, and cooks very quickly, once all needed ingredients are assembled (make sure you note that you need 3 cloves of garlic TWICE).  Definitely a dish to impress, the only problem with it is that the sauce set up and became gluey as soon as it was removed from the stove, so either I did something wrong or else everything must simply be eaten immediately.  Still tasted wonderful!!!

I thought this was a good sauce, after I doubled it, but too much pepper for kids.  I changed some things for the next time I make it, add white wine, less pepper, more milk.  Definately worth making and I will make it again and again.

This got a thumbs up from use and the kids alike.  I did double the sauce as other have suggested, but did not double the garlic in it (I just couldn't bring myself to add 6 cloves of garlic to the sauce and am glad I didn't).  That allowed me to use a full 16 oz box of angel hair and a 16oz bag of broccoli.  Would probably be good with chicken as well.  Oh, and make sure to follow the directions on the box of angel hair...I cooked it 4 min and it was perfect.

This was so good! Easy to make. After starting the recipe, I realized I didn't have any pesto so I quick found a recipe and made my own. I will make this again.

The sauce is delicious but I had to make a second batch cause it was not enough for the pasta. Did not have parsley so I omitted it and instead of white pepper I put black. Not a big fan of white pepper. One more thing I used shredded Parmesan instead of grated in the sauce.

Was delicious - and bonus, my 17-month old loved it.  I used 1% milk with suggested amount of heavy cream - consistency of sauce was fine - very rich!  Reminded me of an alfredo sauce.  I used fresh broccoli and added small pieces of asparagus that I had roasted with a little bit of olive oil.  I'm not a fan of parsley so I omitted that and wouldn't say it lacked in flavor one bit.  I used linguini and did not double the sauce - my husband and I agreed it had plenty of sauce as directed.  

Will definitely make again.  With the start of lent I needed a meat-free dinner and this was definitely something I would serve to guests.

Really good combo idea..Although I cheated..I used prepared Shrimp Scampi Shrimp..Cooked Shrimp as directed (adding a Tbs Butter, Shredded Parmesan cheese, Tbsp or so of Water and Garlic) to have more sauce for pasta....Made Pasta, Steamed some Broccoli  mixed all together with a couple Bosco Sticks on the side....Truly amazing combo....Will do again...

We just had this for our dinner and thought it was great. Next time I think I would make half again as much or double the sauce.  I cut back on the salt and what we fixed lacked salt so I will add most of it in next time.  This is a keeper, we loved it!

Biggest negative is that it turned out gummy.  And I was careful not to overcook the pasta, since you're going to be adding hot sauce to the cooked pasta, but still it turned into one big clumpy mess with some shrimp clinging to the edges.

Also I generally prefer fresh vegetables over frozen, and see no reason why that wouldn't apply here as well (in the case of the broccoli).

Cream sauce was good, but be careful of using a pesto that has too much oil in it, as that will tend to curdle and separate.

Flavorful and easy to make!  Sounds like a lot of garlic, but it isn't.  Only think I'd do differently is after draining the pasta, I toss a little oil in to keep the strands from clumping together (which it did, even after rinsing), and stick it in a warming oven while the sauce is made.  I used frozen florets, microwaved them, made for an easy toss.  Delish!

SOoo good! I made this for lunch and the whole family loved it! It was all gone and even my dad asked what it had in it and said it was DELICIOUS!! I used cream cheese instead of the cream which gave it a little more saltiness.

This dish is full of flavor and I could not stop eating it.  I think next time I will try it with scallops.  I used baby spinach in place of the broccoli because that is what I had on hand.

This was delicious! As others suggested, I doubled the sauce and garlic. The pesto with the cream sauce is really nice, but I did think it was missing a bit of flavour, even with extra parmesan. The second time I made it, I added 3/4 cup grated old white cheddar, a bit of sauteed spinach and 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice. That really makes it perfect!

Fantastic recipe as written. I made a few tweaks for my tastes. Like many reviewers I doubled the sauce. I added a splash of white wine and a splash of sherry to the sauce. Next time I will add some red pepper flakes while saut√©ing the shrimp. As other reviewers suggested, garlic lovers will probably want to increase the amount in both the sauce and saut√©.

I hate to give three stars, but this recipe is not very cook friendly. I have managed to stay away from angel hair pasta for over 50 years and now I know why. I consider myself a very good cook, but this recipe just didn't cut it for me.  I am serving it in a few minutes and I hope it taste better than it looks.

I used fat free evaporated milk, like one of the reviews suggested for low fat option, and the dish had no flavor.  WAAAAYYYYY too much pesto and parsley.  That's all the dish tastes like.  Very disappointing.

Good but not great.  Doubled the sauce as others recommended.  Used half and half instead of cream to cut down on fat.  I've had better cream sauces.

WOW! Better than restaurant! I love spicy food but I would put less white pepper next time, it was a little overpowering. Also less salt. And I thought the sauce was just enough for 2 people so I would double if more...so for 4 stars.

I followed the recipe but omitted the pesto and added a softened red, sweet pepper to the sauce. I only had a small amount of fresh broccoli so I added equal amount of fresh cauliflower simmering to doneness before adding. It was wonderful!

Store outta fresh angel hair pasta so I used linguini.  Tired of brocolli so microwaved asparagus on sale and sliced mushrooms on sale and added them at the end.  Forgot the hot sauce but it was still AWESOME!  Used less salt as well.

Not my favorite although the family did like it enough to eat. Very alfredo like in texture but not as tasty.

I didn't love this recipe. The sauce was pretty tasty but the consistency was off for me. I wanted a thinner sauce and this was almost alfredo-like. I did double it, following some other reviews, and that was a good thing. I don't think there would have been enough otherwise. My picky 6-yr-old loved it though so it wasn't all bad!

Delicious... I did double the sauce and I used all milk 2 cups.. I've never had pesto so I left that out.. I added a small chopped onion when I sauteed the shrimp. I used fresh broccoli that I steamed in a microwave steamer bag. Yummy turned out great.

this was so good!  i live in asia, so it's hard to find recipes for homey food that i can create with ingredients here.  i had most of this on hand and was able to buy almost everything else at the basic little street market by my house.  i had to use dried basil and a bit of olive oil instead of pesto, subbed dried parsley for the fresh, omitted the worcestershire, and used small cooked frozen shrimp.  i also added some red pepper flakes for spice.  it was awesome.  it curbed my craving for food from home, and it is also a recipe that i can see my native asian friends here being impressed with!

Wish I had read the reviews about doubling the sauce definitely not enough otherwise. Had to go back and make more to cover the pasta. Used fresh broccoli instead of frozen and just steamed it. It was delicious. Thank you

AWESOME RECIPE! This has to be one of the best shrimp pasta dishes I've ever had. I took the advise of the other reviews and doubled the sauce and added a little white wine. Oh and instead of making pesto, I just added a tsp of dried basil, a tbsp of olive oil and more parmesan cheese to the flour/milk/butter/cream mixture and it came out PERFECT:-) DEFINITELY A KEEPER!!!

Very good!  I made a few changes.  I used fresh broccolini instead of frozen.  I didn't have pesto therefore I left this out.  I used skim milk and regular cream instead of heavy, sauce thickened nicely with change.  When I melted butter I added minced shallots and white wine before adding the flour.  Also I added red pepper flakes.  I served over fresh Angel Hair Pasta.  I would give it five star but it seemed to be missing a seasoning or something, perhaps it was the pesto!

This recipe was good. i dont know what heavy cream is so i used cream of chicken. Before i tossed the items together i tasted the shrimp and it was AWESOME. After i tossed the items i tasted it and all it needed was a little salt and it was really good. And by the way,  my picky kids loved it.

Out of a family of five this was given an average of 3.5 stars but I bumped it up to 4 because I thought it was great. We used fresh broccoli and as the sauce simmered it did need to be thinned out with a bit of milk. This was a dinner I would definitely make for company and would recommend.

My husband is not a fan of cream sauces (neither am I) but I wanted to give this one a try and boy was it a hit!  I used fresh broccoli as I don't like soft veggies and I did follow other suggestions of doubling the sauce, but it was too much for us.

This is a great recipe!  My pasta/shrimp loving daughters gobbled it up.  I took others advice and doubled the sauce.  I also did not add the hot sauce.  I cannot wait to try this with other types of pasta and maybe a bit more garlic.  This will be a regular at our house

This is BEST new recipe we have had in a long long time!  DO NOT hesitate to make this today!  Easy to make and will seem like you spent hours making it!  The only difference in making the recipe was we left out the hot sauce and we also substituted worcheshire sauce with steak sauce becuase that was what we had on hand!  AWESOME MEAL!!

This was a delicious recipe - the sauce has so much flavor. Pretty easy to put together too, just make sure all your ingredients is out and ready to go so your sauce doesn't get too thick.

Not sure how to rate this..I don't think  I am a big pesto fan. But for this recipe, you can really cut a large amount of time off this if you boil the noodles, steam the broccoli, saute the shrimp and cook the sauce all at the same time. This recipe uses MANY pans FYI. Instead of sauteeing the shrimp in butter, I used olive oil and when all was done, added red pepper flakes. We also used whole wheat pasta. My husband really liked this dish.

Good, but not great.  This creates a LOT of pots to wash for a rather ho-hum meal.  I doubled the pesto and worchestershire and added a lot more hot sauce and it was still somewhat bland.  It has potential, but I'm going to have to play with it to figure out how to give it some oomph.

Hmmmm.  Okay... this was tasty.  I don't know if the pesto, hot sauce, or worcestire made much of a difference because I didn't taste them - but perhaps I didn't "dash" enough in.  I steamed frozen broccoli in the bag, and used frozen shrimp which I sauteed quickly in butter/garlic and then added to the sauce.  Overall - a little bland, but a nice change from tomato.  I think it may have been better with a thicker pasta - like a penne or farfalle.

One of the best pasta dishes I've had in a long time - I was very intrigued by the ingredients for the white sauce initially, but it really is up there with the best sauces I've ever had - and the best part?  It's really easy to make and I can guarantee that you'll impress with this dish.  It also goes great with shredded pieces of chicken (cooked in the same way as the prawns) if anyone is seafood intolerant or pregnant.  Thanks again for a brilliant meal!

Good recipe, it is better with some white wine in the sauce as well, as another reviewer recommended.  Made as-is it is a little bland, but still good.

Sorry, I just really didn't like this...I doubled the sauce and increased all the seasonings b/c it just seemed so bland. (Used fresh basil & fresh broccolini, that I steamed) Not for us, I guess.

Low-cal, like that, but it needs more FLAVOR!!  Possibly some more flavorful cheese and more garlic!!!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I'd never added pesto to a cream sauce and was pleasently surprised. I've made it with chicken too! Also to save a step I just threw my broccoli flowerets into my pasta water 3 mins before the pasta was done.

Delicious! I used light cream instead of heavy cream with very flavorful results. I'll definately make this again.

This dish was so easy to make.  I set up all the quantities in prep bowls prior to cooking.  It all went together very quickly.  My 16yr old son had seconds and ate all the leftovers.  This recipe is definately a keeper.  (The only set back was all the cookware I used in preparation...cleaning up is not a favorite of mine.)

This recipe was terrible. I dirtied every pan in my kitchen and spent a small fortune.
It was soooooo BLAND.  I need more flavor.  Try Cajun Chx Pasta instead.

Excellent.  I used a couple dashes of cayanne pepper in place of the hot sauce, and it worked great.  I'd suggest fresh broccoli too, if you have the time.

Halfway through I decided the other reviewers were right and I needed to double the sauce.   Good thing I did as the double batch was just enough!  Nonetheless, the sauce was extremely tasty.  I wonder if this had something to do with the concentrated pesto paste I used?  I did use skim milk (ironic since I mixed it with heavy cream).  I also added 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes and my husband liked the "kick" it gave the recipe.  I saut√©ed the broccoli, along with some fresh yellow zucchini slices, and chopped tomato in the shrimp pan.  I coated the veggies with PAM and added a little more garlic.  To note:  the package of angel hair pasta I bought said "cook 3 minutes or until done."  My pasta was done in 4 minutes.  The 8-10 minute pasta cooking time on this recipe is definitely too long.  All in all, this was a tasty recipe, but not something I'd make often because of the butter, milk, and heavy cream.

My only comment is the fact nobody noticed that the recipe called for cooking ANGLE HAIR for over two minutes - 8 to 10 minutes and you end up with mush. Yes, definately double the sauce.

This is now my favorite dinner!! Very easy to make and so delicious. Very full of flavor!!  I do recommend using only half the box of pasta, if cooking for 2 people, or doubling the sauce recipe, for more than 2 people.

Grrrrrrreat sauce recipe!!  My entire family loves it.  When my boyfriend and I order something similar to it in a resturant, he makes sure he tells the waitress that mine is better!  It's become the "We're having company dish!"..."We're going to a party, must bring something dish!"  Everyone who tastes it wants to know my recipe and I tell them to come right here for it.  Thanks

This was really good. It made quite a bit of food, so depending on how many you are feeding, you might want to make half. I thought the cream was a little bland, so you might want to spice it up a little. Over all my whole family enjoyed it very much, thank you

Husband proclaimed this was the best cream pasta dish he'd ever had.  I didn't have any milk but had extra heavy cream & protein nut milk.  So, I subbed the 1.5 cups of milk for 1/2 cup nutmilk and 1 cup heavy cream. 

As we were eating it I realized I should have sauteed some mushrooms and made it absolutely perfect.

Only 4 because I did change a couple of insignificant things. Used BowTies, (I'm sure whatever pasta you use adds nothing to the taste) Half n'Half, (which is milk and cream) Pepper flake (hot sauce can sometimes be vinegary) and I had about a half cup of chopped onions I needed to use; which I added to the garlic when saut√©ing the shrimp. Will definitely make again.

This was really excellent!  I had some left over and I baked some salmon and added to it.  Was great.  I can see substituting crab, scallops, chicken or fish in place of the shrimp.  Any of that would work.  Also, spinach would make another sub.  Thanks for a versatile recipe!

Follow the directions and the recipe exactly as it is other than a little more garlic. Probably one of the best pasta, shrimp dishes I‚Äôve ever had! I wish I could give it more than five stars! A huge hit with the family!

Hubby loved this!  Told me to save the recipe and he's a low key kinda guy. I did use lightly steamed asparagus and fettuccine instead of broccoli and angel hair. A BIG keeper!

I made this recipe, as written, and it is 5 stars! It is absolutely perfect as written. I was asked to make it 2 nights later for a late supper. I had to use rice instead of noodles because I was out of pasta and I used an entire bag of fresh spinach because I was out of broccoli. The family loved this version as well.

This recipe is incredible!  I had a little bit of white wine that I added to the sauce, after it cooked, to thin it out a bit.  Very delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made it "as is"  for company.  Everyone liked it.  It was simple to make ahead.  I made the sauce, steamed the broccoli, cleaned the shrimp ad cooked the pasta ahead of time.  This way when my guests arrived I just had to throw it together.   I may add some mushrooms and/or diced tomato next time.

This is by far my absolute favorite sauce!! I did double the recipe and put more garlic than it asked for. Skipped out on the parsley as well. To say the least we never have left overs, definitely a favorite among the family and friends

This sauce is so good - creamy, full-bodied and flavorful!  It complements the garlic shrimp and sticks to the pasta so that every forkful is bursting with great taste. I  had some fresh spinach that I wanted to use, so I substituted it for the broccoli.  I also used thin spaghetti, because I didn't have any angel hair pasta on hand and it was still wonderful.   Next time I will add some sun-dried tomatoes for additional color and texture.

Very quick and easy to make.  A little too much salt for my liking but it's an easy fix.  Used fettucini instead of angel hair and it was fabulous!

This was good! I only had red pesto on hand but I'll make it again with green and I bet it will be even better! This took me less than 45 mins from start to on the table. Great weeknight dinner. I added a red bell pepper and a couple mushrooms we had in the fridge. Will definitely make again, all three kids (ages 1,3, and 5 finished their plates) thank you!

Like others I doubled the recipe sauce and I'm sooo glad I did!  I misread the directions and put all of the garlic in the sauce so I used a lot of garlic!  I also added another heaping teaspoon of pesto!  My family loved it!  They have requested that I make this at least once a month which I can easily do since we have lots of fresh shrimp in the area

Excellent dish. My entire family loved it. After reading other reviews I used Penne instead of angel hair so that there would be enough sauce without doubling the recipe. otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.

I made the recipe exactly as it was written.  The reason I didn't give it the full marks was because the Angel hair pasta was not quite right.  It should of been a thicker noodle like fettuccine. I didn't care for the pasta choice.  The sauce was delicious . This is definitely  a must make again only sub the pasta. It's a good Sunday pasta dinner.

I made it with a few changes.. I didn't have pesto so omitted it,  used frozen broccoli and I used 1/2 and 1/2 in place of the heavy cream.  I also cut  in half the salt  since we use very little.  I feel it can be added at the table better. My husband said it was a keeper.  I think next time I may add more garlic too since I couldn't taste it much. Perhaps my cloves were too small.  The sauce was just the right amount for two people.

My family loved this. My only suggestion is to increase the amount of the sauce. If you are not crazy about garlic, you might cut back from 6 cloves to 4. Very easy to make and the sauce was delicate and not too rich.

From the first time I made this just for our dinner it has become a family favorite. I have used it for four large dinner parties recently and have been asked for the recipe every time. No recommended changes aside from more shrimp and broccoli. A true classic.

This pasta is delicious! I don't eat diary so I used rice milk in place of diary milk and cream (and 1tbsp extra of flour). I used a vegan Parmesan I found at Whole Foods. I also omitted the worchestire sauce and pesto, just because of preference. It came out amazing and the kids loved it! I will definitely make this again. Great comfort food!

We loved it, however I did not add all the angel hair pasta that the recipe required as I thought there would not be enough sauce. Good thing I didn't add it all but all in all it came out great.

Sauce was very good.  But, dish has too much salt.  Remember you can always add salt to a finished dish, you can't remove it once it is made.  I wish I had thought about that before adding all that salt.

This was delicious! I didn't add the spice, though, and I cooked the broccoli too long so it disintegrated, but it blended with the sauce really well and my husband ate every last bite. I will definitely be making this again.

To make it healthier, I used skim milk and fat free sour cream instead of heavy cream. Left out the pesto. My 5 year old daughter ate two helpings. It was great! The second time I used whole wheat rotini, unsweetened almond milk, light sour cream, and still no pesto. Daughter loved it again. Third time, I added corn. Daughter loves it yet!

Very, very good! I will make this again for sure. Followed everything except omitted the pesto ONLY because I was worried my 8 yr old wouldn't like it. I love pesto so I served it on the side and mixed a little in w/ my helping. Oh, I also used shrimp and scallops and more Parmesan in my sauce. This sauce would be great with many variations!

Great recipe.  I have to admit that I made a few changes.  I did not have Worcestershire sauce so that was omitted.  I substituted creme fraiche for the heavy cream since I made a batch that needs to get used.  I also added a clove of garlic.  I used fresh broccoli and fresh Parmesan.   REALLY came out well.  A tad spicy with the white pepper and hot sauce but maybe I added too much.

I doubled the sauce, used fresh basil instead of pesto and used a full 16oz box of pasta. Cooked pasta for 3 min. Everything was good except it needed way more sauce. I realize I used 33% more pasta than the recipe calls for. But I have a family of 6 and thought if I doubled the sauce, it would be old Next time the only changes I will make will be to 2.5x or 3x the sauce and use 12oz of pasta as we had leftovers and it was pretty dry... I threw out leftovers because there was no way it would reheat well being so dry to start.

I used only 1% milk to cut calories and I made extra sauce as others suggested. Surprisingly, it was just a little bland. It was super easy to fix that by simply adding a little garlic salt and pepper, which enhanced the flavor tremendously.  This one is a keeper as everyone loved it.

My family and I really enjoyed this!  It was a bit on the dry side, but I think that was because I had to make do with thin spaghetti, as I didnt have angel hair pasta.  So there was more pasta for the sauce to cover.  We all agreed, though, that this is definitely a "Do Again!" recipe - and that we should keep angel hair pasta on the shelf for now on!

I really wanted to like this, but found it to be bland.  I didn't add any hot sauce, so I guess that could be part of the reason.  I don't believe angel hair past comes in a 12 oz box.  I suggest using a 16 oz box of whatever pasta you like and then double all the other ingredients.  Use large shrimp instead of jumbo so that you have better distribution.  Watch the salt... I felt this called for too much.  I had the leftovers for lunches and the flavor improved as it aged.

This has potential , there is no need to double the sauce ...there was plenty of sauce if you don't mess with the ingredients and use the cream and milk as described , there is only one thing I would change and that's the salt ........I can feel my arteries hardening as we speak haha , it was way too salty and I love salty foods so next time I would either halve the salt or just omit the last amount when cooking the shrimp and only add one tsp to the sauce .

I followed the recipe for the sauce with the exception of using fat free evaporated mild instead of cream. . I used leftover salmon, asparagus, some shallots, and mushrooms saut√©ed that I added to the sauce.  It was delicious!

Overall this was a good recipe, but it just needed some adjustments. alfredo sauce is not cheesy enough.  I used steamed brussel sprouts instead and had to double the amount of sauce for the pasta. But everything else is fine.  I didn't have pesto, but there was no real need for it, and I found it was just fine without it.

I used fresh snow peas (sub for the broccoli) that I cooked up and substituted spaghetti for the angel hair.  Overall a good recipe. Lucky to have pesto on hand to use and threw in a little bit of dried parsley instead.  Cut the salt in half overall and didn't miss it.

This is a very good recipe. The sauce is wonderful and went very well with the shrimp and broccoli. We had to hunt for the jumbo shrimp. We may have cooked too much pasta. Next time we make we are going to use 1 1/2 lbs of smaller shrimp and less pasta.

This was really a great dish and also easy. I made my pesto and instead of shrimp I used boneless skinless chicken thighs. Instead of milk i used almond milk tasted just fine I also added yellow and red bell pepper. I will make again and i doubled the sauce. Thanks for the recipe.

My family enjoyed this dish.  I made it along with a wonderful homemade ceasar salad from this website.  Since my kids and husband love pesto, I will double or even triple the amount of pesto.  I even thought of topping the dish with fresh chopped basil which would add more flavor!
Overwall this was a hit!

Simple to prepare and simply delicous.  Made from recipe, I would prefer a bit more heat next time, will try cayenne or red pepper flakes.  This makes a great low carb meal when using Dreamfields pasta.

Filling and tasty!  I used fresh broccoli and omitted the hot sauce.  I didn't have pesto sauce on hand, so I used pine nuts, parsley and olive oil plus a dash of Italian seasoning.  The flavor was a little bland.  Next time I will make pesto sauce or buy the pre-made version and try the hot sauce.  Great dish for summer!

The cream sauce on this dish is very delicious as others have commented.  It's versatile and could be easily used on many other pasta preparations.  The whole family loved the dish.  I prepared half the recipe with jumbo shrimp and half with grilled chicken breast strips for the kids.  Everyone was happy!

AWESOME dish...my husband requested it the next night too!  With the exception of doubling the sauce (as other reviewers suggested), I made this as written and would not change another thing.  I took the leftover pesto from the jar and added pureed sun-dried tomatoes and served that on warm French bread.  Next time will try using chicken instead of shrimp.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This was horrible...do not know why the 4star rating this turned into mush and did not need the flour and cream!  Could have been made with less calories and been much, much better!!

I liked this a lot, very good flavors and who doesn't love pasta! 't was a little over garlicy, but that's an easy fix. My biggest problem was how much this made - I would half the recipe next time and still have leftovers.

Very good.  The pesto gives a little more flavor but isn't overly powerful.  I only gave it three stars because of the amount of cream.

This is a good meal.  Had a little trouble getting the sauce to thicken.  Might not have cooked it long enough.  It had  great flavor!  Love the garlic, although we might tone it down a little if we are making it for guests :)  Might add some other veggies in the mix next time.  Definately going to make this many many more times :)

Yum! I followed others advice, since I am not a pesto fan. The changes I made were to substitute basil for pesto, skim milk for cream, and I added about a tablespoon more of flour to make it thicker (since I didn't use cream). Even my 4 year liked it and he hates everything.

Delicious!  I used 1% milk and half and half in place of the heavy cream and it came out perfectly!  I added more pesto, garlic powder and ground red pepper for spice.  Served with garlic bread.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch today!

Very good, well worth making.  After reading other reviews - I to doubled the sauce ingredients.  Couple other minor changes:  didn't use the salt with the shrimp, used fresh broccoli, used black pepper (not white-didn't have it), used more garlic, worcestershire and hot sauce than what was called for.  It was very well liked by friends and family.

This was oh so yummy, the flavor of the sauce was especially fantastic.  Just not a fan of frozen broccoli.  The second time, I threw fresh broccoli in with the pasta for the last few min of boiling.  Much better texture (gone was the sponginess typical of frozen veggies).

This dish was really, really good.  I made it exactly the way the recipe said to make it.  Perfect recipe if you are short for time on cooking.

This was a very tasty, but not real flavorful sauce. It did not thicken up the best and I had to add a bit more flour. I loved the pesto and parmesan in there. I will make again but maybe add a little wine at the end or something.

I didn't have any heavy cream, so i added about 4oz of cream cheese.  I didn't add pesto.  I used dried parsley, garlic powder and it was still delish!!  Even the kids ate it.  Just what I was looking for!!  Used frozen pre cooked shrimp and just warmed it up in the garlic butter!!

Good, but kind of bland. Next time will tweak with more Pesto and spices. Also, sauce too thick so I like the idea of thinning with a little white wine. Better the next day.

I thought this recipe was wonderful...It would get 5 stars...except I did change just a couple things...  First, I used spaghetti noodles instead of angel hair.  I don't think that really affected the taste.  When the shrimp was 1/2 way cooked, I tossed in the frozen broccoli and cooked it that way (instead of steaming it).    I also doubled the amount of pesto, and added some red pepper flakes.  The sauce never did thicken up for me...and I was worried it would be a little thin...but once I tossed it all with the noodles, it coated them perfectly, and was just the right amount.

Pretty good, but needs more flavor, recommend adding more of the Worcestershire and pesto, or even diced tomatoes and fresh basil.

I increased everything by a little bit because I had extra shrimp.  Next time, I would increase the sauce more, maybe even doubling it, but it was great the way it was.  I did add a little more garlic.  My kids loved this dish too!

very good!  I didnt use pesto or broccoli, and I used sour cream instead of heavy cream, skim milk instead of regular.  My family loved it! It was mild enough for my 3yr old to like and so did my 8yr old.  I think it would be easy for the spicy folks out there to kick it up a notch, but otherwise this is perfect!

My new favorite meal!  Used half and half(only because I had that), left broccoli out( did not have any on hand). Fantastic.  Next time I will saute the shrimp with some cajun spices to kick it up a bit.  I can not wait to serve it for friends.

Phenomenal. This is the kind of dish Husband orders when we eat out, and he said it was better than anything similar he's had at a restaurant :) I made it with fresh broccoli, and I upped the amount of pesto and garlic. I definitely agree that you should double the amount of sauce. With these changes, this is a five star recipe. Thanks so much, Robbie!

Kind of made due with what I had so can't really say if it would be better made exactly stated.  Used frozen shrimp and fresh broccoli, basil instead of pesto sauce.  Don't usually rate something if I haven't followed it exact but I was fairly close to the recipe and it was just okay for our family.

Really good. Needs a little more salt for my taste. Only downside was that everything had to be cooked about the same time to stay warm. I cooked the sauce a little too long, so it was kind of thick. Added milk when reheated, and it was perfect!

I had all the stuff to make this except heavy cream so used skim milk instead. I used homemade pesto that was frozen, just spooned it into the sauce on simmer.  I also used cumin, chile powder and chile paste to spice it up a little.  Overall fast and great tasting recipe

I thought that this recipe was average. The sauce tasted fine but once it was mixed in with everything else it was a little on the bland side. Maybe a bit more pesto would have helped. I used skim milk and skipped the heavy cream. It still had a rich taste and the sauce was thick enough without the extra fat.

I didn't have Angel Hair Pasta so I used Wide Egg Noodles instead.  I found this to be a delicious Dish.  I marinated my Shrimp ahead of Time in Olive Oil, Garlic, Salt and a Dash of Soy Sauce, therefor, I did not add the extra Garlic when sauteing the Shrimp. If you'd like your Dish to be a little less spicy, I suggest using less White Pepper, since a little goes a long way.

Very good.. But not the best though. I didn't have pesto so i replaced it with basil, didn't have hot sauce so I used crushed red pepper, and was out of cream so I increased the amount of milk and added 1 teaspoon of corn starch and 1 teaspoon of sugar. It turned out to be very good. Gonna make it again.

This is excellent! I followed the exact recipe, except used chicken breasts in place of the shrimp (no one in my house likes seafood). So very delicious, will definately make again and again. Thanks! :]

This was a great recipe.  I did take advice and added cream to make creamier sauce, other than that it was a hit!  Will definately make again.

This recipe was very good but there isn't much sauce.  I had to use only about 8oz. pasta and all of the sauce.  But I prefer my pasta really creamy.  Was very tasty!

Very good.  I left out the broccoli because it just didn't appeal to me in this particular recipe.  I used my own home made pesto and the sauce was delicious.  I will definately make this again.

Delicious! I added sun-dried tomatoes to add a little extra flavor, it tasted even better.

The sauce was great!  My hubby (a very picky eater) and guests loved it. Thanks to the other readers for ideas on how to vary this dish.  I must try the pepper flakes and other veggies.

This was OK but I didn't think the sauce was any better than the Alfredos that you can purchase in a jar.

The directions confused me.  I think the garlic should have been listed at 6 T DIVIDED, not 3 listed in two places.  Anyway, I ended up shorting the dish of garlic and found the flavor to be way too understated.  I reduced the salt due to another review I read, but I think it needed all.  I would increase the sauce ingredients by 50% too.  With these changes I would up the score to 4 stars.
