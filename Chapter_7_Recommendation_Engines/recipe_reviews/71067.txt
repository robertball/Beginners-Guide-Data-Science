You're right, this is not an easy recipe! However, if you have siopao finatics, as I do, it is well worth the effort. I made this for my Filipino husband for our 28th anniversary. He assures me there will be 28 more!! Thank you for sharing and for such clear instructions.

I tried this recipe but I did activate the yeast first by using warm water and adding 1 Tbsp of sugar, set it aside until spongy bubbles appears on top of it. Then you can mix it to the flour mixture. I also let the dough with fillings rise for 15 minutes before steaming it.

I have been looking around for a siopao or steamed buns recipe which uses rice flour and not the usual all purpose flour so I was really happy to find it here at all recipes.

The texture of siopao made with rice flour is a bit heavier and chewier then that made with all purpose flour. This recipe is  reminiscent of the siopao being sold at a very popular resto in the Philippines as compared to the ultra light and fluffy siopao varieties being sold elsewhere.

Incidentally, I gave this recipe only four stars because I didn't like the filling. The dough I give five stars! 

Next time, I will just make my own filling.

Thank you MCCACJ for posting!

I make a similar version of this recipe, although much simplified for our busy lifestyles.  First of all, I make the dough in the breadmaker, using all-purpose flour (just a regular white bread recipe).  Second, I use a combination of ground pork and ground beef, and add a dash of Worcestershire sauce to the mixture.  I make the meat mixture the night before and refrigerate it because it's much easier to work with when it's cold as well.  After assembling the siopao, I rise the whole thing one more time (about 45 minutes) before steaming.  My siopao turns out just as good as this recipe.

julia32,
when you activate the yeast make sure the water is warm and not hot...high temperature will kill the yeast and mix in the sugar that is what the yeast eats which causes the dough to rise. Also make sure you are precise with your measurement of the flour.  if it is crumbly then there is too much flour.  when you knead in that last 1/2 cup do it a little at a time you may not need it all.  Hope this helps : )

The filling for this recipe is amazing, but although I've followed it exactly twice now, I can't get the dough right! I don't know what I'm doing wrong (any input would be appreciated). Every time I try, the dough comes out crumbly and unusable. It's not even remotely pliable and falls apart when I try to make the dumplings.

Thanks for the recipe! Siopao is one of my fave! I made this 
Siopao and it taste good. Though i used all purpose flour. The only problem is that it has too much blisters all around..yellowish to brownish blisters. Looked awful but taste really good. What do you think went wrong? Kindly advise as i want it to look perfect..i feel that im the only one having trouble in my siopao..waiting for all your feedback! Thanks in advance! Tc

One thing I forgot to add in my last review is that the cooked dough has a tendency to flatten out as soon as it is out of the steamer.  I added extra yeast in the initial dough prep, 1/2 teaspoon more.  The dough becomes heavier and a little tougher to knead but you do not have the tackiness anymore.  Once steamed, the buns retained their all around shape and the dough spongier.

Good recipe! I don't have rice flour but you can use cake flour/all purpose flour with for same result; I used http://www.joyofbaking.com/IngredientSubstitution.html for a conversion matrix. For those that have the dough "crumble apart" add a tablespoon of water to the dough at a time and continue kneading until it becomes slightly tacky to the touch. Note if the dough is too dry it will start to fall apart during steaming. 

My Husband loves the filling and has already devoured all of them

I don't understand the problems reviewers had with the dough. If your dough is crumbly you add just a bit of water, if it's too sticky you add a bit of flour, it's common sense. Flour is different, humidity is different where you're cooking, this is basic technique. At any rate, while it takes a bit of time I didn't find this recipe difficult in the least. I've been looking for a great rice flour dough recipe to make bao that my celiac husband can have, and this does the trick beautifully. Use the filling listed or go crazy experimenting with your own combos, the possibilities are endless! Imagine sloppy joe filled buns, buffalo chicken buns, BBQ of any variety, chinese veg filled, egg custard, sausage and egg breakfast buns, cheeseburger, pizza flavors, seafood, taco, fruit, chicken pot pie, quiche, spinach dip, the only limit is imagination. This is hands down one of the most versatile recipes you can have in your recipe box, and they freeze well too so make up a few dozen and when you're ready to eat them just steam in a bamboo steamer until they're 165 degrees inside. No more buying buns for crazy prices at the international grocery for us, homemade is WAY better!

I tried making this with Rice flower, it did not turn out. I did this 5 different times following this recepie to the letter. The rice flower was crumbly and after they were steemed, they were hard.  I found they are much better made with all purpose flower.

If the dough gets super crumbly, just add water. It worked for my team. But man, is this work intensive. I also used imitation crab instead of chicken.

Uh oh. What happened? Dough balls split apart when handling and then again when trying to remove them from the steamer. They taste similar to the ones I had in China, but a little grittier.

I made a smaller batch, using my bread dough recipe.   Followed the filling recipe except I used chopped raw chicken tenders. Everyone love it!

This recipe is certainly missing something. I downloaded it and followed the directions to a "T" and would up with piles of rice flour goo. I'm so upset at spending $50 on ingredients only to have my entire meal end up in the trash can.

Flavor is great but dough was sooo crumbly. I just read now that I may have added too much flour - so I’ll make it again my house smelled amazing though). Also instead of chicken I used carrots and leeks cause I’m vegan and used tamari sauce to make it gf. I also baked it (should have steamed as it was my first time but got tired lol). It had the texture of monay but the inside with the filling was nice and soft. Overall I think recipe is great and appreciate you sharing. Will try to make it again tomorrow if I have the energy. Thanks!
