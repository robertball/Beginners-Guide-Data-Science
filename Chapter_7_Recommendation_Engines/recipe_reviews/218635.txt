Wow! I love the flavor the apple gives to this grilled cheese! All three flavors of cheese, bacon, and apple complement each other so well. I didn't have a panini press, so I used a grill pan and just flipped the sandwich. Next time, I will probably just slice the cheese rather than grate it since it's easier and less messy.
