I scissor trimmed the bacon into 1/2 inch pieces. Put the Brussels and bacon on a foil lined cookie sheet. Stirred every 5 minutes so Brussels cooked in the bacon fat. Added maple syrup last 10 minutes to carmelize.

It was simple and delicious! I love roasted brussels, it's nice to try out a new spin on such a tasty veggie.
