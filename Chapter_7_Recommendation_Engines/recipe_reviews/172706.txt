This salsa is awesome! I made it twice. First time i followed the recipe exactly and liked it a lot, second time i subbed green grapes (with sort of sweet'n'sour taste) for red, omitted bell peppers and added 1 medium tomato. This version I just loved! So the recipe's not only great the way it is, but also very flexible. I'm gonna continue playing with grape and avocado combination.

This stuff is wonderful!  I took this to a big party so I used 4 avocados, 2 cups chopped grapes (thank goodness for my ulu knife and board!), two cloves of garlic, 2 Tbl chopped onion, about 1/4 cup each of the peppers, "ReaLime" juice (the lime I bought didn't produce enough), cilantro, sea salt and pepper - it was quite good! The sweetness of the grapes just brought out a richness to the flavor that was wonderful!  I served this with pita chips.  No left-overs!

This was AMAZING!!  I changed NOTHING.  Made this for a baby shower, was inundated with people wanting the recipe!  It got too juicy near the end of the party, but that soaked up nicely on bread!

Such an interesting, surprising recipe. So easy and quick to make; had it with organic, non-GM black corn tortilla chips. I think I would put a bit more onion in next time and maybe 1 1/2 avocado instead of just 1. I also think that 1 cup of grapes is enough. The sweetness of the grapes is very special, very unique. Thanks!

Was looking for an avocado/guacamole recipe that was a bit different, but simple, and came across this one.  It is EXCELLENT!!   I wasn't sure I'd like the flavor but the sweetness of the grapes combined with the avocado and lime juice and the other flavors is wonderful.  I gave the recipe to a friend who made it all summer!  I will be making this recipe several more times.

The grapes are a great addition to this guac!  I love the sweet/salty combo. I did omit the bell peppers. Also didn't have a lime so I used a lemon instead and it was just as good. Thanks!

I was afraid to make this...but the strange flavor combination is absolutely amazing!  I left the cilantro out because I'm not a big fan, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly and we all loved it!

The first time I made this I stuck to the recipe except for the cilantro. We are not fans of it so I substituted fresh parsley. I have made this on several occasions and I added more avocado, onion and lime juice with great success! This is a refreshing blend of flavors for any time of the year get-togethers. I have used chips and cut up veggies as dippers. YUMMY YUMMY

Amazing! I skip the cilantro and add a little jalapeno. Excellent on a grilled chicken sandwich.

I made this recipe and have been enjoying it for lunch every day. It's a lovely combination of flavors. The only change I made was to use garlic powder instead of garlic salt because, I eat low salt. I enjoyed it with both.  I've also added extra avocado to make it more of a guacamole and that is also delicious.

Absolutely fantastic! Don't change a thing. I brought this to a party, where there were many appetizers and this was the only one that was devoured! Everyone wanted the recipe!

Will make again & again!!! Seriously amazing flavor combination! Ate some with tortilla chips, and used the rest to top some pan seared tilapia. Used black grapes because that's what I had on hand. I cut everything but the avacado a bit smaller than a chop, more of a dice.  However, dicing grapes was tedious (and stained my cutting board =P ) so I won't be doing that again! Next time I will toss everything but the avo in my ninja & pulse a few times. I mashed a little of the avocado but mostly left it in chunks. Thank you so much for this recipe! I LOVE avocado & I'm always looking for new ways to use it.

The recipe is excellent.  The amount of effort chopping the grapes was my primary issue.  I made the recipe exact.  In the future, I'll add at least 1/2 of a fresh jalapeno for some heat.

I just tried this recipe for dinner with my kids.  I topped it on baked chicken and rice, my kids LOVED it and they are 2 and 4 years old.  I used green grapes and omitted the yellow peper and onion.  I took the suggestion of others and added extra avocado.
