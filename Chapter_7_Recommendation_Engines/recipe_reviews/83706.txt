A good basic recipe, but with these modifications:  1) I prefer it without coconut.  2) Use unsweetened whipped cream.  The reason that a pav is such a spectacular dessert is the contrast:  sweet, marshmallowy meringue, mild cream, tangy fruit.  Sweeten the cream, and it will be too sweet.  3) Try spooning on passionfruit pulp if you can find fresh passionfruit.  Not only is it traditional, but itâ€™s the perfect foil for the pav: tangy, and crunchy.  Passionfruit can be used alone, or in addition to the other fruit.

i love this recipe!  It is sooooo good and has just the right flavor.  But you are going to need more than just a 9 in dish to make this.  I use a 15 in and it works great.  And dont use passionfruit pulp because it tastes bad.  You can use some almonds instead of cocanut to make it taste great!

This Pavola was the best I've ever made -- I served it at a luncheon recently and everyone raved about it and immediately requested the recipe.  The dessert is easy to make and presents beautifully.  This recipe officially replaces the Pavola recipe I've used for the last 15 years.

I had 3 egg whites to use up so I decided to make this recipe (cut in half).  It was not what I expected.  The beaten eggwhites just fit into one pan so if you make a whole recipe you're going to need 2 pans.  

Also, it stuck to the pan and I had to break it out (perhaps this was my fault because I greased the pan when it didn't say to do that).  

And finally, the coconut was just "wrong".

The cream on a paavlova should never be sweetened. Just about a quarter of a teaspoon of icing sugar should be added to take away the edge. This pavlova was too sweet with the sweetened cream.

In response to using a pan: you should use a cookie sheet, the pavlova is free standing as it bakes, hence drawing a 9" circle on parchment.  You can also sprinkle cold water on a cookie sheet and pile the egg white mix and form into a 9" round... then bake at 300 f for 1 hour and continue as per instructions.  I think the unsweetened cream is a must or very lightly sweetened or just add some pure vanilla extract about 1/2 tsp.  Mmmm so delicious.  I am actually presently baking 2 in the oven, but used the more simple recipe that gets lower ratings, but am baking it at 300 f.  I used 5 egg whites to serve 12.

This recipe turned out a great pav and I didn't have castor sugar so used regular.  I topped with sweetened passionfruit pulp to make it really traditional (for our Japanese guest) and it was divine.  Mum flakes chocolate over hers but for summer, you can't beat strawberries!

Great recipe!  Great texture! New and unique (in the US at least!) It is an easy recipe that puts to use leftover egg whites!  I like to make this after I have made eggnog (recipe from this site) or traditional vanilla pudding (recipe also from this site).  You could make it any flavor I believe.  I add amaretto liquor to mine to make it almond flavor.

This was a HIT with my family and friends!!  I made this for a summer treat and quickly found out that I have to make more than just one each time I make it! My kids can eat an entire Pavlova by themselves (a 3 and 6 year old)!  We love this recipe and everyone in the family now has a copy of it!  Thanks for sharing :)

Not bad, I am an Aussie that lives in the US.  Pavlova is probably my favorite dessert. I think my Mom makes one of the best Pav's around.  I LOVE passionfruit and it is the real/traditional topping for Pavlova.  Passionfruit makes this dessert, it is not the same without it; in fact it would just be a meringue topped with fruit.  I LOVE PASSIONFRUIT, and that's how REAL Aussie's make it.

Loooooved this recipe. I searched for a good one and this works best. What I like to do though is freeze the pav with the whipping cream on it and then add the fresh fruit just before you serve it. Theres something about the frozen pav that is amazing.

Excellent. This was a treat. I did not add the coconut,only because mt guests did not like coconut, but will next time. Also when ready to use you invert the pie pan to a large plate. The meringue set up high.

I chose this recipe b/c it didn't call for cornstarch like the others (didn't have any on hand), and it turned out great, dinner guests really enjoyed it. I followed the recipe for the meringue exactly (going with the no-coconut option) and it made 2 glass pie dishes, not just 1, so I get to serve pavlova again with tonight's dinner! Very light. A little sweet for me, but I think that's the point of the meringue, right? I wish I had whipped my own cream, but I didn't have any on hand. A favorite alternative for me is the fat-free cool whip b/c it's not too sweet (like I said, I'm not into overly-sweet things).

I made this recipe today (Father's Day) and it was a hit. I had been looking for a Pavlova recipe that called for vinegar, as I was told this was a key ingredient in making the meringue crispy on the outside and marshmallowy on the inside. I did follow the suggestion I read here of reducing the sugar in the whipped cream, I only added about a tablespoon of powdered sugar to my whipping cream.  I guess if you must buy the cream all whipped from the store, that would be hard to do.  I prefer whipping my own, it's cheaper and not that hard to do, plus I have more control.  Anyway, I love this dessert.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

I've made this recipe twice.  Once for Easter 2010 and again today, Easter 2013.  And both times?  Rave reviews. Everyone loves, loves, LOVES this.  The difference in texture between the crispy meringue 'crust', the sweet whipped cream (I make my own for this recipe, I don't use the pre-made) and the fruit is addicting.  It is a sweet dessert, so it may not be for all, but I think it is scrumptious!  You can rest assured that the little leftover piece (as, that's all my sister would even let me take home with me!) will be gone in the next 30 minutes.

Really quite fabulous....loved the texture of the pavlova....not too crispy in the middle...I did cut back a little on the sugar (I actually did not have the super fine sugar so put my regular sugar in the cuisinart to make it this way and was great) The coconut was a lovely addition....A beautiful Easter Dessert enjoyed by all. Many thanks.

This recipe makes 2 large pavlova! We gobbled up the first one, but didn't have room for the second.  Pretty easy to make,  and looks beautiful.

I live in the States and have made this a couple of times now for Easter, it makes a beautiful spring dessert. I make it with homemade whipped cream, and no added sugar. I agree the cream should not be sweetened as the combination is perfect: sweet meringue, lovely cream and sweet/tangy fruit. I use a combination of berries, kiwi and mango. My whole family loves this. We had not tried this dessert before I found this recipe but now it's a favorite! (I skip the coconut and almond due to allergies, but I'm sure they would be marvelous additions) Thanks for sharing this, I'm not a huge sweets person but this is in my top 3!

I've made this twice for guests and all enjoyed it.  The first time I put it on parchment using a 9" circle, and the second time I used a parchment lined 11" porcelain tart pan.  Both worked fine though the cookie sheet method allowed the meringue to expand  without restriction.  I did sweeten the the whipped cream.  It was delicious!  It's a great make ahead dessert and looks gorgeous.
