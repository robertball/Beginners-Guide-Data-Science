Yum!  I made as written other than using about 2/3 of a bunch of cilantro.  I found the spiciness level to be perfect but my family thought it was a little too spicy- seeding the serranos would help with this if you're sensitive to spice.  In the future if I made this I would cut the vinegar a little- a little too tangy for my taste but still yummy.  This sauce smelled fabulous!!
