This recipe was so simple, yet so delicious!  Some changes I recommend that other users may have also recommended:  use 3/4 water instead, use only 3/4c brown sugar (it was a bit too sweet for my taste), use large green apples, bake for only 40-45 minutes, and add rolled oats to the cake mixture (i added about 1/2c).  The rolled oats give the topping a crispier, yet mildly chewy consistency.  Also, eating this a la mode with vanilla ice cream = HEAVEN!

I had to write a comment on this! I have made many an apple crisp, and this seems to take the cake as everyone's favorite! I gleaned from previous reviewers and this came out fabulously yummy! 
First, I used a "golden (or yellow) butter recipe" cake mix, and did mix it w/ 3/4 c. of oats. I used the amt. of butter the recipe called for.

For the apple mixture, I sprinkled w/ nutmeg, cinnamon and a bit of allspice! With the water (about 1 C. I think), I added 4 T caramel ice cream topping and 1 egg. No added sugar.

It wasn't too sweet and we even had it for a late, special breakfast (the kids are still talking about our "special breakfast!")

Thanks for my new favorite! This is a great treat to bring to a neighbor, by the way...straight out of the oven!

I love this recipe! I read most of the reviews and made the recipe 3x today making little changes each time. I took tips from the reviews and came up with the following changes: sprinkle lemon juice over the cut up apples, toss the apples with cinnamon & nutmeg, 1/2 c. water with 1 T. vanilla added, 1/2 c. brown sugar, 6 T. melted butter, and 3/4 c. oatmeal. We kept one, and gave the others to relatives who asked for the recipe right away!

Very good!   I made a few changes, though: I used apple pie filling instead of apples to make it easier, cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup (thought the filling would be pretty sweet), added about 3/4 cup of rolled oats and poured 3/4 cup of margarine over the top.  The top ended up chewy and crispy.  I made it for a dinner party and was asked for the recipe a number of times!

This recipe is a keeper!  Easy and so delicious!  I did add about 1 cup of oatmeal to the topping, and I used a cinnamon blend that has nutmeg in it.  If you add nutmeg on its own, just a pinch or two is fine.  If you like your topping with the oatmeal in it like I do, also add about 2 Tbsp. more butter to make up for the extra dry ingredient in the topping.  The apples bake down, so if you like a thicker layer of apples, use one or two more.  Using yellow cake mix also works just the same as white.  My whole family LOVES this recipe.  You will too.

I have been looking for a great apple crisp recipe for ever! If I found one that was crispy, it had no cake-like middle. If I had cake, I had no crisp. You get the idea.  This was both. I did alter the recipe. I used a spice cake mix instead of white, I omitted the brown sugar and added 2 packets of Quaker Instant Oatmeal Supreme cinnamon pecan cereal (make sure to get the supreme cereal only because of denser oats than regular)to the cake mix along with 1 tsp cinnamon. For the apples, I added 4 TBL caramel Ice cream topping blended with the 1 cup water and 1 egg. This was poured over the apples. I like the top really crispy so I put it under the broiler for a couple minutes.

This was super easy and delicious!

I made this today to serve for Mother's Day tomorrow. My dh and I sampled it out of the oven warm and it is delicious. I took the advice of other reviewers- I doubled the amount of apples,tossed them in lemon juice, sprinkled them with nutmeg and cinnamon, and then added 1 T of vanilla (actually vanilla butter nut extract)  to the apples; I reduced both the water and brown sugar to 3/4 of a cup, and added 3/4 cup of oats to the topping. I baked it for 20 minutes at 350, then covered it with foil for another 20 minutes (total cooking time was 40 minutes). Thanks!

This was a hit at a Rosh Hashana dinner I brought it to last night--everyone had seconds!  I did make a few changes from the recipe.  I used a whole 3-lb. bag of Granny Smith apples (12 small apples), and might use even more next time because they cook down so much. As suggested by other reviewers, I used less water and added extra cinnamon and some vanilla to the apples, sprinkled nuts on top, and only baked it for about 50 minutes.  Thanks for such a great recipe.

FALULOUS!!!  Took others suggestions and used 3/4 cup apple cider in place of water; omited sugar, and added 1 cup oatmeal to cake mix topping.  The whole pan is gone and my family is clammering for more.  Brother-in-law got jiffy cake mix by mistake, and I used 2 boxes to great success.  Will make again and again, and everyone asked for the recipe.

Really easy and really delicious.  I added dried oats to the cake mix for extra crisp.  I added about a cup and it was awesome.  Will make again.

This is outstanding.   Reading the reviews, I don't understand why everyone keeps adjusting this recipe.  The name is EASY - if you keep it that way, it's outstanding just like it is.  Otherwise, it will take as long as an apple pie.

DELICIOUS! First note: To make life easier, buy an inexpensive apple corer/slicer. It makes the process so much quicker! I altered this recipe after reading other reviews. Instead of a white cake mix, I used a butter yellow mix. I used almost double the amount of apples (10) which requires using a second dish. Before placing them in the dish, I tossed the apple slices in nutmeg and cinnnamon with a little bit of lemon juice. I used 3/4 Cup water with a teaspoon of vanilla mixed in. I reduced the amount of butter to 6 Tbs. and I reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 Cup. Like many other reviewers, I added 3/4 Cup rolled oats to the mixture. I imagine this would also taste good with pecans or chopped walnuts mixed in, which I will try the next time I make this. It is fabulous when you serve it warm with a scoop of vailla ice cream. Even my Mom, who is an "Apple Crisp Aficionado", loved this dessert. Enjoy!

I served this on Thanksgiving and it was a hit! Even my sweets-hating family raved about it. I used the suggested changes: 3/4 cup water, 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup old-fashioned oats added to cake mixture, baked for 45 min, and I also threw in 1 tsp. baking spice with the cinnamon. Excellent with vanilla ice cream, french vanilla cool whip, or all by itself. I will be making this a LOT!

My teenage daughter made this for our Thanksgiving dessert, and it turned out wonderful! We added two packets of cinnamon brown sugar instant oatmeal on the top before baking and it was fantastic! Really easy and very tasty!

Well, I couldn't find the recipe I usually use, so looked for one to make Hubby something with apples. He was suggesting one that used the cake mix topping. I found this one and tried it right to the recipe, except I added a little oatmeal to the topping for extra flavor.   I was not really happy with it, and won't make this one again. It was so sweet it made the roof of my mouth itch!  Cut the brown sugar IN HALF and it might be a lot better.  I used granny smiths too, so it wasn't sweet apples/sweet sugar situation.  The topping got too hard as well. I attributed some of that to my adding some oatmeal, but still... it wasn't what I was after at all, and way way too sweet as written.

Excellent recipe! I used a yellow cake mix and it was delicous. I scaled back the brown sugar to about 3/4 cup. I also increased the cinnamon and added 3/4 cup oats, as others had recommended. Great recipe and I usually don't care for recipes with cake mixes. This is a pretty sweet tasting recipe - if you like your desserts sweet, this one is for you!  Great with vanilla ice cream. God Bless

I was affraid it wouldn't come out good because im not an expert but i followed the exact directions with the exception that i added the 3/4 oats, and only 3/4 of brown sugar as other suggested. No left overs, and will do it again this weekend!Thanks!

This is wonderful. My son loves this and asked me to make it again soon. I did only use 3/4 cup water and used a little more cinnamon. It is a little runny at first, but when it cools it thickens nicely.

This has to be the best apple dessert I have ever made! I made some slight changes because of personal taste...I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup based on prior reviews and that was borderline to sweet for me but hey it is a dessert after-all. I took 1/4 cup of the brown sugar listed and tossed that in with the apples, water, a little vanilla, a little extra cinnamon, nutmeg and then topped it with the cake mix mixed with the remainder 1/4 cup of sugar and cinnamon mixed along with the butter and 3/4 cup of cinnamon ( unsweetened) oats. I had to bake mine quite a bit longer ( 30 extra minutes) until it turned golden brown but it was well worth it! It DOES look soupy when it comes out but thickens upon standing. I have used  white, yellow and funfetti ( looked weird tasted great) cake mixes and they were all good. Next up I am going to try Spice Cake Mix.

Very yummy!  I only used about 3/4 cup of water and baked for 45 minutes and the apples were perfect - I sprinkled a little cinnamon directly on the apples after adding the water.  Next time I might add some chopped nuts to the topping.

Made it for the office and my colleagues loved it.  Only thing is 1 cup of water is way too much, trust me 1/4 cup would have been more than enough, was way too watery and ended up pouring some liquid out (too runny).  Other than that it was a great crisp.

By far the easiest crisp recipe I have used. I did tweak it just a bit though. I used more apples (enough to fill the 9x13 pan, and I had smaller apples), apple cider instead of water because I had it on hand, threw in a bag of baking caramel bits, and added some oatmeal to the topping. Super delicious, this will be my go-to recipe from now on!

This is so easy to make and fast!  I cut the brown sugar down to 1/4 cup and add 1 cup of rolled oats.  1 cup of brown sugar is too sweet for my families liking.  I use this with apple and peach pie filling when I don't have time to core and peel apples.  Omit the water and add 1-2 cans of pie filling and it works just the same.

PERFECT apple crisp recipe! Everyone raved about it! THANK YOU! I made some minor changes, following the suggestions of others. I cut the water back to about 1/4 cup. I sprinkled the apples with cinnamon. I added 1 cup of oats to the topping, and I used cinnamon swirl cake mix instead of white cake mix. I also cut the sugar to 1/2 cup.  It was delicious! This is the only apple crisp I will ever make again.

Very adjustable ingredients! I sprinkled a small handful of dried cranberries over the apples (which I mixed Braeburn with Honeycrisp), sprinkled w/lemon juice and substituted OJ for the water, then used 1/2 a pineapple cake mix that I added 2 cups old fashion oats, 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of the white, and a handful of pecans to. I cut into dry ingredients 1/2 stick butter and same amount of butter flavor Crisco. Sprinkle over apples and Cook 55 minutes @ 350 degrees. TRY Changing it up! Delicious and ALL YOUR OWN!!!

This was a HUGE hit! Super easy and delicious! I followed other reviewers and made the following changes as well. I used a yellow cake mix, tossed apples with cinnamon and nutmeg, reduced watter to 1/2 cup plus 1 T vanilla, added 1/2 cup oatmeal, changed butter to 6T, baked 50 minutes. Topped with ice cream...YUMMY! Now I'm off to send the recipe to everyone who asked for it. Thanks!

I made this for my husbands birthday as Apple Crisp is his favorite.  I did add raisins on top of the apples.  It filled the house with a wonderful aroma and I was hoping it would taste as good as it smelled.... WE WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED!  This Apple Crisp is wonderful and I recommend it 100%, so does my family!  Thank you for the wonderful recipe:)

YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY IF YOU TRY THIS RECIPE!  EVERYONE LOVES IT! 
I have also tried this recipe with my own changes, many were made based on the suggestion/input from others. I have made it several times.I use Granny Smith apples-about 11 medium/large size, but have found that a mixture of Red Delicious with Granny Smiths are best.I use apple juice instead of water with about a teaspoon of vanilla extract mixed in before pouring over the apples. Instead of melting butter (in a hurry) I just take a stick of butter and slice it up evenly into pads and place them evenly spread out atop the apples that have already been tossed in a little lemon juice, sprinkled with cinnamon and about 2 tsp white sugar and about 3/4 c brown sugar. I then evenly sprinkle a yellow cake mix over that. For the "crisp", I buy cheap oatmeal cookies and crush them up (coarsely) to equal about 1 cup and sprinkle them over the dish and add about a cup of chopped pecans(we love them, they seem to be a nice complement to the recipe and they also help to cut the sweetness and adds great texture).  I finish with  a little caramel topping drizzled over all of it.  For that amount (Approx 5-6 lbs of apples) I baked it for an hour.  I covered it with foil for the last 15-20 min of baking at 350 deg. I bring it to a work Thanksgiving potluck every year and to my mom's for Thanksgiving and people rave over it.  The pumpkin and apple pies are left over, but not this dessert! ;)

I followed this recipe exactly as written and found it to be super easy to make and delicious!!  The sweetness/tartness can be determined by the types of apples you use... I used 3 granny smith apples and 2 mcintosh apples.  I might add 1/2 C of oats the next time but that would be a personal preference so as to add even more to the texture.

wow is all i can say about this one. definitely do yourself a favor and add oats to your dry mixture. you will not regret it! i added around a cup or so.  i also did a little under a cup of brown sugar and it was perfect. and, i also added cinnamon to my apples and a pinch of sugar. 
i don't usually write reviews on recipes, but this one definitely deserves it! everyone you serve it to will love it!

I made this the quick way and used cinnamony apple pie filling and it turned out really good. Its so easy to make. I added a couple handfuls of oatmeal to the crumb mix and it was still very moist, but not wet. Also before I put it in the oven I sprinkled it very lightly with a cinnamon sugar mix. Topped it with whipped cream before we ate it. Again, it tastes like I spent all day working on it!

MOUTH WATERING! This was the BEST apple crisp, ever. I did use some of the reviewers suggestions and added two extra apples, 2/3 cup of APPLE JUICE, not water. sprinkled the apples with nutmeg,  allspice and cinnamon. Drizzled the apples with caramel ice cream topping. Reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup (with the apple juice and the caramel I probably could have reduced it to 1/3 or 1/4). baked it for about 45 min. Delish!

This was absolutely fantastic !!! I did modify the recipe a bit....after reading  reviews...I changed the sugar to 1/4 cup since the white cake mix has sugar...then I only added about 3/4 c water.  I also put about a tablespoon of brown sugar with the apples.  This was a fantastic recipe and it was a hit at the party....Gone in a few minutes !! SUPER EASY to make, too !!!

Delicious and absolutely easy! I made a few alterations as per previous reccomendations. First, I used the Betty Crocker cinnamon swirl cake mix. It comes in two packages. One is the cake mix itself, and the other is the packet of cinnamon sugar. After I sliced the apples, I sprinkled about half the packet of cinnamon sugar (from the cake mix box) over the apples. Then I addded 1/2 c. water. In a bowl I combined the cake mix, the other half packet of cinn/sugar, 1/4 c. brown sugar, and 6T of melted margarine. Crumble over the apples and bake for 50 minutes at 350 degrees. It turned out incredible!! I will make this often.

I made this the other night and it was way to sweet. The cake mix was like eating solid sugar on the apples which were already sweat enough.

Add a bit more cinnamon than the recipe calls for.Bake for 40-45 minutes instead of the reccomended time to avoid the apples over-cooking and becoming mushy.

Easy is right!  I make this multiple times a year and is usually my go-to recipe when I need to bring a dessert somewhere.  I've used the white cake mix, yellow, strawberry, and even funfetti (though someone asked if it was moldy when I had just made it that day... they ate it anyway and loved it.) Make sure you use butter.  I tried making this once for a lactose-intolerant friend of mine and it just wasn't the same.  The dry mixture didn't get crumbly the same way when mixing, more formed a paste.  We try to use a combination of cortland and braeburn apples for this recipe if we can find them at our local country store, and I reduce the water to 3/4 of a cup.

This was incredible! My parents raved about it when I brought it for dessert the other night. I made some changes as others had suggested. I used 8 small to medium empire apples, used 3/4 cup water with 3 tbsp. lemon juice and 1 tbsp. vanilla flavoring added.  Also I used a yellow cake mix with pudding and added 1/2 c. quick oats to the cake mix.  I also sprinkled cinnamon, nutmeg and about 1/4 c. sugar over apples in the pan.  Used 1/2c. butter plus 3 tbsp. and it came out awesome.  Thanks for the great recipe.  My Mom is begging me for it.

I was very skeptical with the shortcut of cake mix.  Have grown up on "from scratch" baking and apple crisp was always perfect.  Tried this and my family absolutely loved it.  I've always been one to favour alot of "crisp" and less apple, but this was too much crisp to apple ratio.  Next time I'd double the apples and it would still be plenty sweet and crisp!  Delicious!

WOW! This was simply fantastic, add a little of your "personal touch" such as cinnamon or pumpkin spice and it's a masterpiece! I can't believe how easy and wonderful this is! My husband is so picky and snobby when it comes to dessert and he rated this a 10!

Great!  I give it 5 starts because it's so incredibly easy.  I've made this recipe numerous times and I always receive compliments (and it disappears quickly).  I've also used blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, strawberries in various combinations (reduce water) and everyone loves that too.  You can adjust the sugar to taste.  I've used white sugar when I didn't have enough brown sugar.  We love the topping, so I sometimes use a little extra flour, sugar, cinnamon, and butter to make a thicker topping.  You could also add oats/oatmeal to the topping.

This recipe rocks. We used it this past Labour Day weekend to feed 135 hungry diners at Steak BBQ. It received rave reviews in the middle of Ontario's apple country. We used Paula Red apples to make the recipe, cut the sugar down and added some oatmeal.

Very tasty. Very east.  I served it warm with fresh whipped cream.  I followed some others advice and doubled the amount of apples and added 1 tsp vanilla to water.  I thought the texture was great with twice the apples and can see it would be very soupy if you only used six.

This was so easy and tasty! I added a dash of vanilla and cinnamon to the apples, and only 3/4 as suggested.  I added about 1/2 cup of quick oats and only baked it for 50 minutes. I had it with vanilla ice cream and it was so good!

I am giving this a three because I did not like how it turned out, it was too soupy and the crisp part was way too sweet.  I tried it again but I altered the recipe a bit.  I mixed cinnamon and apple pie spice with the apples before I put it in the pan.  Then I reduced the water to a half cup of water and poured that over the apples.  Then the crisp part, I reduced the brown sugar to a half cup. After all the alterations, the crisp came out really good.

I live on a farm with tons of apple trees! I LOVE this recipe! I made some adjustments.  I used 1/2 cup water with 1/2 tsp. Vanilla to cover the apples.  I added extra cinnamon, and about 2/3 cup oats to a butter flavored cake mix.  The apples came out a bit mushy, but who cares! It's delicious!  This might taste awesome with spice cake mix too!

Absolutely delicious! I needed a quick & easy apple crisp recipe for Mother's Day. This looked like it would work for me since I'm not really skilled in the kitchen. I actually forgot to peel the apples, yet no one noticed! How can you go wrong with butter & brown sugar?! It was so divine that I couldn't believe I made it. I altered the recipe by adding nutmeg, a few drops of vanilla extract, a cup of steel cut quick cook oats & a little more butter. The oats gave it a thicker crumble. I topped off each serving with vanilla bean ice cream & everyone loved it. I made two 8x8 pans - one to leave with mom & one to take home. Brilliant idea! I'm having some for breakfast!

This is the easiest most tasty apple crisp I've ever made!  I did add a cup of oats to the cake mix as some of the other reviewers suggested.  I can't imagine making any other apple crisp again!

Phenomenal.  I used 12 granny smith apples, 3/4 cup packed brown sugar and 3/4 cup old fashioned oats in the mixture.  This came out super.  Baked for 50 minutes.  Will definitely be making again very soon.

Excellent!  Followed a few suggestions: used the spiced cake mix w 2 pkgs of plain breakfast oatmeal, apple cider instead of water dash of nutmeg.  Added the 4 TBL of caramel sauce too.  Nice crunchy top.

Now I know why New Englanders need cheddar cheese with their apple pie and crisp.  This was SOOO sweet.  Next time I'll put in only 1/4 cup of brown sugar, especially since the cake mix already has sugar in it.   I also added 1/2 cup of oats and that helped.

Wow, I am definately keeping a white cake mix as a staple in my pantry.  This was so easy & VERY tasty. I took the advise of a few reviewers and added some lemon juice, allspice, nutmeg & cinnamon to the apples.  I also added 3/4 cup oatmeal to the cake mix before adding butter.  Even my husband, the apple crisp King loved this!!

I'm not going to rate is since I did not make it true to the recipe. I also used oats in the mix and added nutmeg, only b/c I had it in the cupboard.

GREAT and simple recipe (except for all the darn peeling and coring!)!!  I don't have any idea how many apples I peeled cause they were small apples from our tree.  The sliced apples filled the 9x13 about 2/3 full.  I added enough apple juice to just come to the top of the apples.  I used a spice cake mix and tossed the apples in cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and a bit of cloves before I topped it with the crumb mixture.  Baked a wee bit longer, but got rave reviews!  The juice firmed up a bit and the entire house smelled divine!  Thanks so much for the recipe!  The only thing I'd do next time is add a wee bit of oatmeal for some crunch on the topping!

Well, I give this recipe 5 stars with one suggestion. I used a cup of oats and added 2 additional tbsp butter. I made this last night and it was fantastic. The kids loved it, the boyfriend loved it, and I loved it. No complaints here!

I make this a lot when I'm in a hurry and my husband complains of wanting "something sweet". TIP: I add in a couple tablespoons of cornstarch, a little vanilla extract and some cinnamon and nutmeg and cook it quickly before I top with the cake mixture. It comes out a little less sloppy and disappears fast. Sometimes, I'll take some caramel ice cream topping and drizzle it over the top to really take it....over the top. ;)

This is fantastic. I've made it several times with both apples and blueberries, used both white and yellow cake mix (even the 50% sugar mix from Pillsburry) and each and every time this has turned out amazing. Easy and terrific. What a find. Thanks!

This recipes was very delicious and very easy to make.  I used 1/2 cup of water and 1/2 cup of brown suger, it was still a little too sweet but still very good. I also added some oatmeal.  Next time I'll reduce the brown suger some and add more oatmeal....

My whole family loved this recipe!  It's so easy to make and it makes your house smell so good!  Note, any apple tastes great with the dish, but definitely use white cake mix, no other cake mix will taste as good!  I've been told to make 3 batches of this for our Christmas party, enjoy!

This was delicious and easy. I did use some suggestions from reviewers. I sprinkled the apples with a little cinnamon, nutmeg and sugar mixture. Also I decreased the water to maybe 1/3 cup because I was using home-grown Haralson's that are really juicy. The apples came out really good. Also I decreased the brown sugar to 3/4 cup and found it really sweet. I want to decrease it a little more next time but not sure if that would affect the texture of the crumbs. I also cut the baking time to 40 mins and it was perfect.

I was sooooo disappointed in the this recipe!  It was overwhelmingly sweet even after I cut down on the amount of brown sugar in the recipe.  After all the great reviews I decided to make it for company before trying it first.  BIG mistake!

Made this yesterday for 3 friends who came for lunch & bridge. They loved it! And it certainly was easy. I took some tips from other reviewers, and made a couple of changes. Used yellow cake mix, and Granny Smith apples (almost double the number called for), but they were maybe a bit on the small side. Added only 1/2 cup of brown sugar to the mix, but I think next time I may not add any. Was still a very sweet topping. Added 1/2 cup quick cooking rolled oats. Next time will add 1 cup. Squeezed juice from 1/4 of a lemon over the apples and added a couple of pinches each of cinnamon & nutmeg.Used only 1/2 cup of water. The consistency was perfect! There was plenty of the topping crumb mixture, so next time I might try to find a smaller cake mix. All in all, IT WAS A HIT! Will definitely make it again. Thanks!

So I made this lastnight for my boyfriend and I.  I have to say it was YUM! My girlfriend made a similar recipe and it took her forever to make it. This was fast and easy!! I peeled and chopped the apples, threw some lemon juice and cinnamon on them. Added some water, and then the topping. I did, however add chopped walnuts to the recipe to give it a little crunch. It was a tad bit too sweet for us, so next time I won't use as much brown sugar...but it's soo absolutely yummy!!

I loved this recipe, but I substituted pumpkin bread mix for the cake mix and it was awesome!! It gave it an extra spice. Yum, I would recommend trying the pumpkin bread mix.

I made this tonight.  It smells wonderful while cooking.  My husband and 9 yr old son LOVED it!  I liked it but prefer my usual recipe where all is made from scratch.  I just didn't like the "cake mix" idea, however wanted to try something different.  I will probably make again, as I got rave reviews.

This apple crisp is sweet, easy and delicious!   I added 1/2 cup of oatmeal and only used 1/2 of the brown sugar.  Next time I want to spice it up  with apple pie spice.

Good consistency and indeed very easy, but waaaay too sweet. I won't make this again, but if I did, I would cut the brown sugar in half and use oatmeal instead. The cake mix has plenty of sugar--no need to add more!

This was easy and very good.  I too added less than a half cup water as my apples were juicy.  I left out the brown sugar because my apples were sweet.  I added a cup of oatmeal like previous raters suggested.  The topping did not taste like a cake mix and it was very crisp.  I will definitely keep this recipe.

I nervously made this once for a family function, (having never tasted it, going only by faith of the good reviews) and since then, have made for almost every church/holiday function.  I ALWAYS get asked for the recipe!  It is so incredibly easy!  Like others, I cut back on the water, and I also added some instant oatmeal to the cake mix, and then sprinkled some slivered almonds on top.  This is a definite winner!

Easy to make, and my husband couldn't get enough. We've made it a number of times and always say we're going to give some to family, and everytime we end up eating the whole thing. I will definitely make this for many years to come.

DEEEE-LICIOUS!!!  I followed other reviewers suggestions.  I reduced the water to 1/2 cup and reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup.  I also used yellow cake mix (Jiffy Cake Mix - 50 cents) and sprinkled pecans on the top.  I repeat - DEEEE-LICOUS!!  I have wanted a good recipe for apples that wasn't an apple pie and this is it!

Delicious, easy recipe. I did make the following modifications: used 3 different varieties of apples; chopped the apples instead of sliced because we do like the apple pieces to be soft and smallish; sprinkled apple chunks in pan with cinnamon/sugar mixture; reduced water to 2/3 cup and added 1/2 tsp. vanilla to it; used yellow cake mix instead of white; reduced brown sugar to 3/4 cup (although next time I'll leave it at 1 cup because we do like our desserts to be sweet); added 2/3 cup rolled oats to dry cake mixture; reduced baking time to 45 minutes. Delicious out of the oven, but seemed to be even better about 3 hours later. Thanks for a great recipe and for all the suggestions!

I was really excited to make this as it had such great reviews.. I noticed many said it was too sweet so I used 3/4 cup brown sugar and a little more cinnamon. I also used 7 apples (all I had at the time). However, my husband and I just tried and at first it was like, wow this is great! But halfway through it was just too much!! Still much too sweet and the cake mix made me feel sick to my stomach. I think if I make it again I might use peaches or 3x the amount of apples. I am sure that more apples would balance it out better. I used a cake mix that was exactly the right amount but it was extra moist with pudding in the mix. Perhaps that was a mistake, but all I had on hand.

This was my first time making apple crisp for my kids. It was awesome they loved it I even took some to work and they loved it there. I only used 3/4 cup brown sugar and it was great. At work they are asking for it again. My daughter even asked to take it to school for a snack. WOW

Had half a box of white cake mix in the cupboard so decided to make this. This recipe is amazing. Probably the best apple crisp I have ever made. Tastes a lot better than any other one made with oats and it's so easy! Definitely making this again.

Served this for dessert last night and everyone loved it!  It is so quick, easy, and delicious.  I followed the other reviews and mixed 1/2 cup or so of oats into the cake mixture, and also used a butter cake instead of white.
I also mixed the apples with cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice.  Used between 1/2 and 3/4 cup of water and baked about 45 minutes and it was perfect.  Thanks for a easy recipe!

This is basically a "dump" cake.  Over the years I have tried all kinds of "crisps", and they come out ok, but not great.  Using the dump cake method w/a cake mix never fails.  It is always a hit, and great to take to pot lucks or holiday gatherings.  Pumpkin for the holidays is just delicious and festive, albeit that one requires eggs and a little more preparation.  I used some apples I have on hand that needed to be eaten or frozen, made this recipe w/fresh apples, and not the canned apple pie filling and loved it.

I doubled the apples and used about one third less sugar.  I used a vanilla cake mix and  put in two nine inch pie pans. Baked for forty minutes.  Held together after cooling.  Was able to slice and remove like pie.  Used  honey gold apples.

Super easy to make and not that expensive. It has a great flavor but isn't overly sweet. Perfect with ice cream as well. We did 50 minutes and the timing was perfect

I made this yesterday with a yellow cake mix.  It was wonderful! I did add about 3/4C oatmeal and 2 T more butter.  Everyone loved it.  I would definitely make it again.

I have made this for my boyfriend, family, and also for friends. They have all LOVED it! It's so easy to make, and so uncostly. I added more cinnamon because I LOVE the flavor. I also topped with vanilla ice cream-- I think doing that adds so much more. Warm + cold in your mouth, it's delicious. Thank you for the recipe!

Fantastic twist on the dump cake! I used 1/4 cup of orange juice in with the water(I was out of lemon juice so I got creative) mixed with some cinnamon and nutmeg tossed with the cut apples. I cut the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and added a generous splash of oats to the topping. My kids hate everything, but THIS they will eat.

Very yummy! I also think it could be made using less sugar. I added approx. 1 cup of oats because I like the added flavor/texture. I bended all the dry ingredients using the wisk attachment on my Kitchenaid and drizzled the butter in while it was running....it turned out great. My apples were cooked in 45 minutes, so you will need to watch your cook time.

This was an excellent recipe. Easy to make, the right texture and balance of apples and crisp. I added a touch more butter than what was called for only because I needed to finish the cube. This will become a family favorite.

Easy and great tasting.  I varied by using about 9 apples; 3/4 cup of apple juice; yellow butter cake mix; a little nutmeg and I substituted splenda brown sugar equal to 1/2+  cup of brown sugar.  I also used about 1/2 cup of uncooked oats.   I mixed in about 1/3 of the mix in the pan with the apples and then used the rest for the top.  Baked for 45 minutes.  It looked done, but the top was not crispy, so I browned under the broiler (watch that it doesn't burn) for about 90-120  seconds.  

I am certain variations will taste just as good.  Next time maybe some cut up strawberries or craisins or chopped walnuts - whatever is around.  Great for the family or company.

Wow, yummy! I had Granny Smith apples so I used the full amount liquid (they tend to need more because they're so firm) - but at the suggestion of other reviews, I did exchange the water for spiced apple cider. I also cut the brown sugar in half as suggested and added about a 1/2 cup of oatmeal to the topping for texture. Unfortunately I had no vanilla ice cream on hand, but that would have made this divine dessert absolutely perfect!

I was looking for an easy apple dessert recipe and I have found it here!  Truly very simple and absolutely heavenly.  I didn't have a white cake mix on hand but I did happen to have a butter pecan cake mix in the pantry so I used it.  If you are planning on making this, try the butter pecan sometime.  Crazy good!  With vanilla frozen yogurt on top.

I brought this over to my Mom and Dad's, they were over the moon with it..this coming from a woman who has been cooking for 70 of her 85 yrs, and known as one of the best cooks near and far. She loved that the dish was not overly sweet, I used whatever apples I had, not necessarily Granny Smith. I also added some cinn. to the apples on the bottom layer.  My Mom made me write down the recipe so she could also make it! Sooo easy!

delicious! I made it with granny smith apples that my boss brought into work from his backyard.  I thought 1 cup of water worked fine and I made it exactly to the recipe except I did sprinkle a little bit of extra cinnamon on top of the apples prior to adding the rest of the crumble topping. My husband and I tested a little piece and the rest I took to a brunch.  He was begging me to leave it with him so he could eat more!

The recipe as is didn't work for me.The 3 stars is as is.I would give it 4 with my alterations.I cut the sugar down to almost nine. I used  over a cup of multigrain trader joe's oats in the topping.Less than half the sugar. I doubled the apples.I mixed it in with the cake mix and butter. I also had to cut the cake mix/oat toping through the crisp with a knife to mix it a bit once the apples below started cooking. Picture if you were making a marble cake. Other wise the butter itself is not enough to make the topping anymore than a powdery mess on top.I even added extra butter to compensate the oats.I only gave it 4 stars as it took forever to make with all the peeling and chopping and the cutting through I did.  That being said my MOTHER IN LAW of 10 yrs asked for the recipe. First time ever!!!!!! YEAH!!!

I made this mostly as written, but added 1/2 tsp nutmeg and allspice to the topping.  I only needed half of the prepared topping to cover the crisp.  The flavor was excellent, but it was too runny.  I will make this again but with half the added water.  I used Jonagold apples.

This is DELICIOUS! So, as per the vanilla suggestions, I used a french vanilla cake mix and it was divine. Also, I used a pint of strawberries instead of a couple of apples, and also threw in some raisins. A HUGE hit at my house.

This was my first time ever making apple crisp and I thought it was okay. My husband loved it but I think I will follow other user's suggestions and add oats to it. I did add a little extra cinnamon and double the apples. Taste was good but was not a fan of the conistancy

On a budget? This was so easy and very tasty!! No changes made except added cinnamon sugar on top before baking and it was crumbly without the oats!!! It was wonderful for breakfast this morning with fresh brewed coffee and will have on top of vanilla bean ice cream tonight for dessert!

TO DIE FOR.  added 1T. cinnamon and 3T. sugar to 10 c. of apples, either used no water or 1/4c. water depending on type of apples.  used white cake mix first, next time used yellow.  i think i like the yellow better.  also added 3/4c quick oats to topping since it wasn't crumbly enough.  mmmm mmm good, will definitely make many more times.

I love to make dessert for my family, and this is by far the favorite.  It's easy and the taste is amazing.  The only thing i recommend is adding a little whip cream or ice cream.

This recipe was very good and super easy.  The only thing I would like to tweek a bit next time is the topping.  I found it a bit dry and plain.  Too much like the cake mix it is.  I prefer somehting more moist and crumbly or streusel-like.  Worked well as a recipe to use on the fly one busy day, but i'd change the topping to be more "hearty"; less flour-y/cake mix like.

I've never made this with apples but made it with peaches many times this summer. The only changes I make now are to only use 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup brown sugar and add 1/2 cup oatmeal. My family and friends love it and it's so easy. I'm sure it's just as good with apples.

I used 2 cans of pie cherry filling in this one, as well as a yellow cake mix.  Took other's suggestions to add oats and 2 tsp. lemon juice to the crumble topping.  If it's too sweet for you, serve with vanilla ice cream.  Thank you for the great recipe!!!!

Everyone loved this recipe! I took a few others' suggestions and modified the recipe just a bit to give it a more homemade taste. I took one can(21 oz.) apple pie filling and mixed it with 4 peeled and sliced granny smith apples. I added a little vanilla and a little lemon juice to cut some of the sweetness. I only added about 1/2 cup of water. Also, I used a yellow cake mix and I only added 1/2 cup brown sugar. (It was plenty sweet enough.) I also added a little nutmeg and 1/2 cup oats to the topping mixture, and I'm sure nuts would be a good addition, as well.

What a wonderful recipe this is!! My family love this.  It does make alot but it never seems to be enough at my house! The kids are in love with it. One of the easiest Apple Crisp's that I have ever made. One small change that I added was some oats to the white cake mix! Honestly nothing else is needed. Thank you for sharing this awesome dessert :)

This was excellent, lots of flavor and so quick and easy to put together.  My 8 year old mixed all the dry ingredients, while I cut the apples.  We had a mom and daughter bake night.  Fun!

Great recipe. My family LOVED it!  As recommended by others, I used 3/4 cup apple juice instead of the water, reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 cup and added 1/2 cup of oatmeal in with the cake mix. Sweet but delicious with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top!

Made this for guests and it was excellent! Hubby accidentally bought French vanilla cake mix but it was great!  Also, I used apple juice instead of water. The only reason I am not giving it a 5 star is because some of the crumble ended up becoming so caramelized that it was almost like toffee - other than that - really great; everyone loved it - will definitely be a family favorite.

Very good and easy!  I followed some of the suggestions from others by cutting sugar all together, using 3/4 c. apple cider instead of water, sprinkled some corn starch over the apples to thicken the liquid, sprinkled some nutmeg and cinnamon over the apples and then added oats & walnuts to the cake mix. I definitely recommend to others!

Super tasty and easy! I made a few changes to make it a little healthier. I added 1/2 cup of rolled oats to topping, omitted the butter and used 1/4 cup of apple sauce w/ one tablespoon of olive oil. I didn't put in the brown sugar and it still turned out really good. My family loved it.

We just moved into a new house, with an apple tree in the backyard.  My kitchen is yet to be fully stocked--cinnamon, cake mix, brown sugar and the apple tree in our backyard were about all I had!  This recipe was perfect, and it turned out great. It is very easy, and tastes delicious. It is quite sweet--could do with less brown sugar--but it bakes up perfectly. I used apple juice instead of the water, and that was nice; next time, I may add a bit of flour or cornstarch to thicken up the liquids a bit. I have made it twice in 2 weeks!

This recipe was awesome. I liked it better the next day warmed with french vanilla ice cream. I took the advice of other viewers and did not add the brown sugar and I only used about 3/4 cup water, and I also doubled the apples. I  added 1 cup of quick oats to the cake mixture to add a little texture. I will absolutely make this again.

Excellent recipe! To make it even easier, I replaced the white cake mix, brown sugar, and cinnamon with a box of Cinnamon Swirl cake mix that was in my pantry.

As per reviewer suggestions I dusted the apples with cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice and used yellow cake mix.  The taste was great but the apples were too  hard (maybe I put in too many apples).  I put it back in the oven for another 20 minutes.  Everyone loved it.  The crust was a special hit, very crunchy and yummy.

The very BEST thing about this recipe is the crisp on top.  Cake mix, brown sugar, cinnamon and butter...I make it and store it in a big ziplock.  It keeps for months in the refrigerator; anytime I want to make a little personal crisp I just peel a single apple, pop it into a glass container, sprinkle it with allspice and cinnamon and some of the topping and bake it.  I even forgot to do anything at all to the apple...just sprinkled the topping...and it was delicious!

Made this for Thanksgiving...loved it! Was even better the next day! I Took off one star because the recipe as it stands is way too sweet for us.  Made some changes. Mixed it with another recipe ("Apple Cranberry Crisp" on this site) for the filling and topped with this topping. Used spiced cake mix and vanilla cake mix. Omitted the brown sugar all together (the vanilla mix has PLENTY of sugar) it was still REALLY sweet! Broiled for a minute to get it crispy and yummmm! Am making it again today for a Holiday party. Trying individual pie cups and adding oats this time. Will keep using this recipe over and over!!

Awesome! I too added about a cup of oats, and slightly reduced the amount of brown sugar. This recipe is great! Served it with natural vanilla ice cream with a little caramel sauce drizzled over it all-- truly a huge hit! Thanks!

This recipe was very good although all I had was a Betty Crocker cinnamon swirl cake mix. I used 1/2 cup water, the cake mix w/ brown sugar and cinnamon packet that was included w/ the mix and 1 stick butter. Came out excellent.

Extremely easy!!! The topping was good (I decreased brown sugar to 1/2 cup, and added a handful of oats), I also decreased the water to 1/3 cup, which was just about right. I cut up my apples very thin, but they didn't get as done as my kids prefer, so it lasted longer than I expected...I loved it, though. Thanks!

I thought it was very good, but a little too sweet (and I like sweet!).  I followed the advice of others and used yellow cake mix and half the water. I also tossed my apple slices with cinnamon and nutmeg. Next time I will use half the amount of brown sugar. I used Fuji apples and they are sweeter apple, but I did add lemon juice to my apples for a little tartness. 

I was pleasantly surprised by the golden brown, crispy topping . It couldn't be easier. I will definitely make this again with those modifications.  Served warm with vanilla ice cream!  Yum!

I make this with yellow cake mix, sprinkle the apples with additional cinnamon, and use 1/2 to 3/4 cup of water.  This is a very easy recipe and is probably my husband's favorite dessert.  I like this recipe too and I am not a fan of desserts of this type.

I made it exactly as described and it was DELICIOUS! Next time I will probably add some rolled oats because I like them, but not because this recipe lacks anything. Oh, wow. I hope that I can manage not to gorge myself on it tonight!!!

I made this today! It is really good... I put apple juice in place of water, less brown sugar and I added oats for the crispness. I also added a little nutmeg, which made it taste wonderful. I would definitely make this again, and it’s  easy and quick!

This is my fist time making apple crisp. I followed the suggestions of several different users and loved the results! I used granny smith apples and a french vanilla cake mix. I added 4 tbs. caramel ice cream topping and egg to the water, as was recommended by a couple users. Instead of the recommended amount of brown sugar I used only a couple heaping tablespoons, and added 3/4 cup of oats to the cake mix. I also added a couple pinches of nutmeg to the mix. It didn't turn out too sweet, and enjoyed it topped with vanilla ice cream.

I added rolled oats and some granola cereal to the yellow cake I had since it was a small mix. Adjusted cinnamon, all spice, and nutmeg as we like. Used wild larger crab apples so added more brown sugar. Yum

I tried this recipe with fresh cherries and apples, then used a box spice cake plus chopped pecans. Amazing!!! Especially topped with coffee ice cream!

This is a great recipe. So simple, but oh so good. Can also be made gluten-free by using gluten-free cake mix instead of regular. Tastes just as good! -

Easy...Excellent...Simple & Classic...Just as the recipe is written...Warmed up & served with ice cream! Delish! I cut the recipe in half, baked it in a pie 9" plate and was just right! For the record, any 7-9" round baking dish will fit the ingredients just fine.

This was excellent but a little too sweet. Next time I'm going to use half the amount of brown sugar.

I make this exactly as directed and it's always gone in minutes. I get requests for the recipe when I take it to luncheons and no one can believe how easy it is! It is sweet, though. If I make it for breakfast I cut the sugar, but we love it "full strength" for dessert. It's good as is but you can also add chopped pecans and craisins to the crumb mix for a delicious alternative and I'm sure oats would be good as well.

This is close to the recipe I love using with my 1st grade students.  Every September, we culminate our week of apple learning by making Apple Crisp.  The white cake mix is a delicious, easy replacement of the typical flour, but you HAVE to include oats!  Here's the recipe I use:  6 apples, 1/2 melted butter, 1 cup white cake mix, 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup oats, 1 Tbsp. cinnamon.  Same directions as above, but omit the water altogether.  Tried & true with 6 year olds for many years.  We love it!

Used 1T cinnamon, 2T apple vinegar mixed into the water, 1 ½ c oats: sprinkled ½ of cinnamon on apples and put rest into dry mix. Reserved 1 c of dry mix and used it on 4 apples (with ½ c water in a glass casserole dish in same oven)…wonderful. Sweet and I think next time I will just do the baked apples and skip the rest. Great way to use up a lot of apples at once.

The first few bites were tasty, then all I could concentrate on was the cake mix taste. I feel like there should've been more butter for the topping because it was quite powder-y. I'll try a more traditional crisp recipe next time.

This was so easy and so delicious! I like that you don't mix sugar in with the apples.  The topping makes it sweet but not overly sweet.  I will make this over and over!

Very good recipe. We used the canned apples (because we had them). So really I just used the recipe for the crisp on top. It turned out really goo. My family loved it. Very rich topping though.

Actually, I was mostly looking for a recipe for the crumbly topping the use with my mom's home canned spiced pears. This recipe worked great! I served it hot, ala mode, with caramel topping. This recipe offered the crunch I was looking for; Perfecto!! Mom was very happy she loved it! especially since I used her special reserves, and added all her favorite flavors. huasonshine

I didn't read all the reviews and the suggestions would have helped a lot - tasted good, but needed something more. I used spice cake mix , added oats to the mixture and added dried cranberries and raisins to the apples. I think I should have pressed it into to the apples more and it would have been chewier - it needed more liquid (or something) on top!

PS - When mixed all together it tasted great...

I found this recipe on pinterest as a raw apple dump cake.  Only had yellow cake mix and 3 apples, but did use a half bag frozen fresh cranberries (1-1/2 cups?)  Did not use water, as original recipe did not call for it, and the fruit was plenty juicy when it came out of the oven.  I did love this, but really prefer my fruit crisps with an oatmeal crumble topping, hence the "crisp".  Will make this again this fall, and use the cranberries again as it was a pretty and tasty result!

This is a quick and easy way to make apple crisp. I used spiced cake mix because I didn't have white, and I also spritzed the topping with a little bit of water to make it crispy. Everyone at the party really liked it and didn't leave leftovers. Very good flavor!

I have to admit, I didn't think this would work out because the apples just had water on them, and usually when I make an apple pie, I mix the sugar and spices in with the apples. But magically, the apples were sweet and spiced. The topping was pretty sweet, so I may use a touch less sugar next time, but my boyfriend absolutely loved it as it was.

This tastes good and is so easy. I took others suggestions and doubled the apples, used a larger pan, added 1/2 cup old fashioned oats, only 3/4 cup brown sugar and pulsed everything but the apples in my food processor. My top was crunchy(no broiler).  Thanks.. will be making this again!

I make this all the time. It is requested at all get-togethers that I attend. I have done different things with it such as adding rhubarb to the apples and oats to the topping. Once I had the apples prepared and went to the cupboard for the cake mix and found that I only had banana nut flavored cake mix, so I used that and it turned out wonderful!

Make sure you add 1/2cup of oatmeal to the cake mixture to cut down on the sweetness, or it will be way to sweet. I also cooked it 45-50 mins. This makes a nice big tray to bring along with you to get togethers. Easiest desert to make,  topped with some cool whip because ice cream was to frozen.

I loved this and how easy it was. I halfed the recipe just so I didn't eat too much, used spice cake (like one of the other reviews mentioned), put 2 tablespoons brown sugar directly on the apples, cut the water some and added grape-nuts cereal and oatmeal for extra crunch. LOVE LOVE LOVE...

Very good!  I used 4 granny smith and 3 gala apples which I tossed in lemon water.  Used sugar free cake mix, sugar substitute (WheyLow Gold), but only used 3/4 cup, and served it with NSA vanilla ice cream!

Just made this last evening for my mother-in-law's birthday dessert.  HUGE hit.  She said it was great at least three times.  I followed others' ideas and cut down the water to 3/4 cup, brown sugar to 3/4 cup, meant to add the oats, but forgot.  It was amazing anyway.  Served it over french vanilla ice cream - WOW!!  Husband who is not a big sweet eater even raved about it.  Will definitely make it again!!

Very yummy!  I used yellow cake mix, added an extra apple and 3 packs of instant oatmeal.  I can't believe how easy and good this is.  My boyfriend even eat it for breakfast!!!

This is excellent and very easy to make. Over time I have made some changes: mix cinnamon, brown sugar, and nutmeg into the apple slices, and add less water in the pan.  For the topping I cut down the brown sugar and add 1/2 to 3/4 cup oats when I have them in the house. White or yellow cake mix work well.  Delicious!

I used others suggestion right off the bat (lemon juice and oat additions) and it was terrific. I have since used this recipe multiple times, it's a keeper!

I used a spice cake mix instead of white, completely omitted the extra brown sugar and it came out just great!  If I was going to make a crisp or cobbler from scratch, I'd do all the extra stuff other reviewers have suggested, but since I was looking for a super quick apple dessert, this did the trick.  Texture-wise, it probably could use a bit of oatmeal, but the cakelike consistency works well with ice cream. Might try this with peaches and a yellow cake mix.

Oh my goodness! So good and SOO easy to make. For sake of time, I used two cans of apple pie filling, omitted the water, and cut the amount of brown sugar to 1/2 cup instead of a cup (since the pie filling has enough sugar to compensate). Next time I will try it w/ fresh apples, as I'm sure that will taste even better, but can't say enough good things about this dessert!

Outstanding dessert!  I used canned peach filling instead of apples (4 cans). I used only 1/2 cup of brown sugar, added 1/2 cup of oatmeal and a dash of nutmeg. Served it warm with vanilla ice cream on top and got rave reviews!!

We went apple picking in Oct. came home with 2 full grocery bags of apples. When I tried this recipe, I probably made 6 of this apple crisp within 2 weeks for various people and for my husband's poker night. It is so easy and really good. Everyone wants the recipe now :-)

Thanks for the recipe.  This was so delicious!!!  I used three large Granny Smith apples.  I also used 3/4 cups of water, added a tsp of vanilla extract and used a yellow cake mix.  I will definitely be making this again.

I took the advice of some of the reviewers and reduced the water to 3/4 cup and added a teaspoon of vanilla to it. I used a French vanilla cake mix because it's what I had on hand. I also sprinkled a little extra cinnamon in with the apples. My husband was raving over this, he said this is the best dessert I've ever made.

This is an excellent dessert made with world famous Dixon Farms Champagne apples from New Mexico! Using their fresh apple cider instead of water made it perfect. I made this recipe with a spice cake mix instead and served with frozen vanilla yogurt. This will be a definite repeat using up 160lbs of apples we just bought.

I feel crazy writing to say that I didn't like this after all the rave reviews but I thought it was nothing special. I followed suggestions and added vanilla flavoring, cinnamin and nutmeg directly to the apple part, but they still tasted incredibly bland to me. The cake mix layer on top was way too sweet and I felt like the cake mix and apple layer didn't really go together, just kind of sat separately in the pan. I am ssssooo disappointed!

This recipe is fabulous!!! I did make a few changes the more that I have made. Omit the brown sugar, cake mix, and cinnamon. Add a spice or cinnamon swirl cake mix instead and mix it with the melted butter. I also only use 2/3 cup water, which make a perfect consistence.

This was delicious and a big hit at the porluck we went to. I cheated and used 2 cans of Comstock apple pie filling and added a small bag of dried cranberries and raisins. I also added chopped pecans to the cake mixture. I will make this again and again!!

I just made this today for my family's labor day cookout and it was a hit! I'm used to making apple crisp the old fashioned way, which can be very time consuming.  I was skeptical to try out this recipe but I gave it a shot using the 2 cans of apple pie filling.  I added 2tsp of cinnamon, used a yellow cake mix, and sprinkled some cinnamon sugar on top.  The family said it was better than the old one that took me so much more time!  Thanks for the recipe!

Tnis was pretty good. I used about 9 apples (because I was using small, macintosh apples). I thought I was using a spice cake for the top, but used a carrot cake by mistake-- it stil tasted wonderful. I agree with other users, but some cinnamon and a little sugar directly on the apples. I also used slightly less water than reccommended and it was perfect.

I had some apples I bought, that no one ate, and I needed to make something so they wouldn't go to waste. I found this recipe and I loved it. Very easy. 20 minutes after it came out of the oven, there was one little peice left. I wouldn't change a thing in it either, came out perfect to the 10 people that ate it..will definately make it again.

This was so easy and delicious! However, I found that more cinnamon would have really added to the taste. I had put in 2tsp and I think that 3tsp would have been perfect. I also used 6 large gala apples and it was the perfect amount. I will definately make this one again.

Very good!  I did not have a white cake mix so I used a spice cake mix.  I added 1/2 cup oats, and used a 1/4 cup less of the brown sugar and water. I'm thinking ice cream or whipped cream is a must!

Very yummy!  Everyone loved it.  The only thing I would change is the amount of water.  It seemed to be too watery.  Less water and it would be 5 stars.

Very easy!  I substituted the (2) 21oz. cans of apple pie filling for the apples/water.  I also added more cinnamon than what was called for & used 1/2 cup of sugar.  Turned out perfectly!!

Very delicious!! This is so tasty and easy to prepare. I only had 3 Granny Smith apples and 3 Roma apples so I added a little lemon juice to them after I sliced them. Added a can of Apple Pie Filling only since I needed to use it up and a handful of raisins. Only added 1/2 cup of the water and sprinkled cinnamon with fresh nutmeg over the apples. Decided to add 3/4 cup of oatmeal and 2 Tbls. of Milled Flax Seed to add 4g of extra Dietary Fiber. With this, 1 tsp of Vanilla and an extra 1 tsp of cinnamon was also added and the brown sugar was decreased to 3/4 of a cup, to still allow it to be crumbly. Keeping the butter the same amount and finished it off with cinnamon sprinkled over the top. This recipe is a keeper, the family loved it and it was fun to make!

This has been a hit for any occasion. The only thing I change was adding the water. I do not add water and I always use a butter cake mixture.

I'm not big on apple crisp, but this dessert hit the spot.I followed others and reduced the br sugar. I did not have white cake mix so i used what i had which was a golden butter mix. I used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon and i added some sweetened almonds. The texture was great. I will make this again

Well the recipe name was right, it was very easy! Oh and so good! We ate ours hot out of the oven with a spoonful of vanilla icecream. I took a little taste to my dad and he said it was probably gone before I even got home(I live about 2 minutes away)! Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

This was great! I used a few pears with my apples and mixed apple pie spice with the apples. Meant to add oatmeal to the mix, but forgot. Only used 3 heaping tablespoons of sugar and it was still great!

Excellent!!  Vanilla Bean Ice Cream is very good on top when warm.  I added old fashion oats as someone suggested.  I also added a pinch of nutmeg. This is a definite keeper and thank you for all the suggestions for the changes.

Cake mix--who would've thought it made such an unbelieveable crust for apple crisp?  This recipe is as easy as it is delicious.  

One of the things I really like about this site is how you can read other cooks' suggestions or alterations to the recipe.  It really helps.  I used yellow "butter recipe" cake mix (as someone else tried and liked), cut the brown sugar to 1/2 cup, and added 1/2 cup of oats.  The apple crisp turned out very nicely.  

Thanks for the great recipe!

Like others recommended, I sprinkled the apples with cinnamon and a little nutmeg before  adding water.  (I used only 1/2 c. water.)  Then I used only 1/4 c. brown sugar (I think next time I won't use any - the cake mix is sweet enough!), and added 1/2 c. regular oats to the cake mix.  SUPER YUMMY!!!

Made the Easy Apple Crisp for Super Bowl.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Wow!  Soooo delish...not a crumb left.  I used Granny Smith apples and I was afraid they might be a little too tart.  Not the case.  Next time I will make two as everyone was looking for more of it to eat and the plate was empty.  A definite keeper.

This was sooooo good, and really easy to make. I sliced the apples with the slicer on my cheese grater. I also changed the recipe as suggested earlier by tossing the apples in cinnamon and nutmeg, using yellow cake mix, and less brown sugar. I made it for a party and people went nuts for it. It really makes the house smell great too. I'll definitely make it again.

This is my first time making anything like this and I got rave reviews. Everybody loved it! I made it for a co-worker's birthday who requested something with apples...he looked it! I read all the reviews ahead of time and took in all the changes to the recipe that people suggested: reduce the water, reduce the brown sugar and add oats, vanilla, possibly some pecans and it was great! Thanks so much! I have everyone asking for the recipe and to bake it again.

Excellent. This year I had a lot of apples so I tried two apple crisp recipes. This was far better than the traditional recipe on this website. Although I did take user advice and halved the brown sugar and added a cup of oats. Fabulous - and my guests agreed!

Talk about easy, and with ingredients that you have on hand :-)  This was a huge hit with all of us!! I did decrease the amount of brown sugar....Thanks Mary this was already added to "family favorites" !!

SOOOOO GOOOOOOOD!!!!  this was delicious!  I am a traditional (with oatmeal based crumble) crisp person, but this was so good, I don't think I'll ever make another kind.  I used 10 whole apples, 3/4 cup of water, and 3/4 cup of brown sugar.  I also added a bit of oatmeal, and will add even more next time, just for a little chewiness.  We all loved it and will be making this again soon.  Thanks!

Wow this is the best apple crisp I have ever had.  I made some changes based on other reviews that worked out amazing.  I only used 1/2 cup of water which was perfect I also added 1tbsp of vanilla to the water.  Other reviewer's thought it was too sweet so I added 1/2 brown sugar to the apples rather than the already sweet cake mix.  I also added 1 cup of instant oats to the cake batter which added some wonderful texture.  This was really great.

Loved the topping--my 3 yr old helped me do everything but cut the apples. It was quite delicious and enough to last 2 days for a family of 4.  We'll be making this again--my son is already asking for more!

I followed the advice of other reviewers and used only 1/2 cup of water and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. The finished product was outstanding! The 1/2 cup of water was perfect but it was still a little to sweet. Next time I will use 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  If you have a sweet tooth and don't like this... then you did something wrong! This is one of the better deserts that I've fixed yet. Highly recomended and so easy even a rookie like me can make this!

This is the ultimate quick and easy and soooooo scrumpous of apple crisp recipes. I cook weekly meals at my church and have often used this as an easy to preapare and great tasting dessert (I always use the pie fillings). I've also used this same recipe with blueberry and cherry pie filling. Thanks Mary for a great recipe! Wouldn't change a thing. Goes great with ice cream!

Good flavor. I make one and a half times the topping as people suggested but it was too much. Don't add water. The juice from the apples is plenty.

I made this recipe three times.  Once to try at home and twice for work.  Everyone LOVED it!  I did use about 10 medium apples from our trees. (good way to use leftover apples)Best apple crisp I have ever made.

Wow! This was the best thing i have tasted in awhile. OF course i'm pregnant too. Anyways I made the recipe with the following: 7 big apples, 3/4 water, yellow cake mix, little over a 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and same butter. I sprinkled a generous amount of cinnamon on the apples first. Usually when I make something it doesn't turn out but this was easy!!!

This was a simple but yummy apple crisp. I used a yellow cake mix as that was all I had on hand. I also used an extra apple because it didn't seem to be much apples. I also sprinkled a little cinnamon on the apples.

Not a big hit at my house.  My family thought the topping was too sweet/sugary and the apples had "no flavor."  I used red delicious.  Won't use this one again.  (if I HAD to...I would coat the apples with cinnamon and a little nutmeg, use 1/2 the water, use less of the topping...and maybe a little more butter.

Fab-u-lous!  At first I thought there would be way too much crumbly stuff because it looks like a lot when you are adding it on top of the apples and water. But I went ahead and used the whole amount and boy am I glad!  I wouldn't change a thing!

I can't believe how easy it is to make but still taste like it took alot of time.  I didn't have white cake mix, just yellow and it still tasted great! My apples were a bit mushy cooked at the time recommended but still really good. I just won't cook as long next time...yummmmmm

2 cans filling is not enough. This tasted great for Thanksgiving dessert, and everyone loved it. Here are my notes, changes and 1 problem. I decided to use the pie filling, as poster gave that option. The 2 can option was no way to be enough. Used 3 cans (21 oz) Duncan Hines More Fruit Apple Pie Filling. Left out the water as directed when using the canned filling. Used Duncan Hines Butter Golden Cake mix. Cut the brown sugar to 1/4 cup, due the the sweetness of of the filling and cake mix. Was perfect. Sprinkled lightly the filling with cinnamon. Added 1 tsp cinnamon into the cake mixture. added 3/4 cup rolled oats. Following the suggestions by others, I increased the butter to 6.5 tb, instead of 4. Now comes the problem. The topping of butter, cake mix, rolled oats and cinnamon did not get very crumbly.,only about 20%. The remainder of the mixture was like a thick brownie mix. I added in 1/4 cup more rolled oats. Helped a little, but not a lot. It had to be hand spread over the apple mixture, a little difficult. Next time I will try with the recipe of only 4 tb.  Cooked for only 45 mins. However, while visually not  a crumbly looking topping, the flavor was still great! Excellent recipe and will make again. Served warm with vanilla ice cream.

This recipe is so good. There wasn't any left once people started eating it. I didn't have a white cake mix on hand so I used yellow instead. It turned out great. Highly recommend.

I used 8 apples instead of 6 because they were sitting around not getting eaten. I think more turned out to be better in that respect. Otherwise I followed the recipe and it was a winner. The house smelled heavenly and this desert paired well with vanilla ice cream.

This was soooo easy.  Yummmy!
I included blueberries with the apples 
and added the oats. 
It was a great hit with both the adults 
and little ones. 
I will definitely make it again.

This apple crisp was so easy and yummy!  I used salted butter which gave the topping a delicious sweet and salty flavor. Per suggestions in the reviews, I used only 1/4 cup of brown sugar and no white sugar and 1/2 cup of apple juice instead of water for the apples.  It was plenty sweet and I might use no sugar at all next time (and there will definitely be a next time).  I also eyeballed about 1/2 cup of quick cooking oats into to the topping.  I added nutmeg and a dash of ground cloves to the apples as well. Thank you very much for the recipe!

Had a few substitutes, based on ingredients I had... used 7 small honey crisp apples and Simple Mills almond flour vanilla cake.  Came out a bit mealy, which my husband thought was a result of using oats (oats not used). The brown sugar could hadhalf the sugar

This was amazing and so easy to make. I used the 2 cans of apple pie filling by Duncan Hines. It says to not add water if using the filling but I did anyway. I dumped the cans into a greased baking dish and topped with some water and than added the cake mixture. Tip: I checked it when it had about 20 min to go and I still seen some of the powder cake mix on top so I added more water to the spots that needed it. I honestly didn't think it would taste so good. Topped it with vanilla ice cream!!

Love this simple, yet delicious apple cobbler. Actually I was given some  red delicious apples that were extremely tasty but not tart. Not having any lemon to add, I added a little country time dry mix to the aplles, and the cobbler came out very tasty.

Great recipe but I did make a few changes as I always do. I used about 10 cups of apples( Granny Smith and a few cortlands) To the apples I added 1 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg. and a pinch of all spice ( you could use apple pie spice 2 tsp) I placed those in the pan and added 3/4 cup of water.  To the white cake mix I added only 3/4 cup of brown sugar, 1/4 tsp cinnamon3/4 cups of rolled oats add the melted butter and crumble over the top of apples.  Made this twice  with rave reviews  I baked mine about 55 minutes, I like a little crisper apple not mushy.

Perfect breakfast for Fall, I even made 1/2 of the recipe 'cause I ran out of apples. In addition to the basic recipe I added 1/2 cup of organic pumpkin  to be more filling. Baked 25 minutes at 350

Deeee-LISH!  Even a non-baker can do this. I would cut and prep the apples after prepping the cake/sugar mixture just so the apples don't sit so long.  The house smelled so good while this was baking.  We could hardly wait for the timer to go off.

I followed the recipe exactly and can’t say I was a fan of how it turned out. Basically, it tasted as though sweet gravel was in top of apples. I read many of the reviews prior to making this dish and now can not understand why others raves about it.

This is great  but I admit I changed it up a lot! Apple juice, a 16.5 oz lemon cake mix, ground cinnamon and ginger, loosely chunked unpeeled apples, NO sugar, but added about half a package of butterscotch morsels, not exactly crisp, but who cares!

Due to food allergies I had to modify and it was still deliscious!  We used a gluten free cake mix and I used a vegan/soy free butter.. followed the recipe in measurements etc.

I would add another 5 min to the 55 min. I've noticed when I sub in it usually takes a little longer (or it could be my oven is offf a bit as it is older)

Very easy to make and tasty. Based on the reviews, I added oats and cut back on the brown sugar. I added dried cranberries and 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts to the apples.

I made this recipe to the note and it was far, far too sweet.  The crisp itself came out beautifully but when we went to eat it I found the sweetness made it difficult to finish my serving.  I could try one of the many, many different tweaks, but I think I'll just try one of the other recipes instead. I made this with crab and gala apples, and a Betty Crocker cake mix.

Easy and delicious! I was looking for a recipe that didn't call for flour since I had none on hand, and so glad I found this! I used gluten free yellow cake mix and it was perfect.

I made this recipe just as written.  My husband and those that I shared it with really loved it.  I felt that I have had better and prefer the Apple Crisp II recipe on this site.  I felt that the cake mix was too prominent.

I have been searching and trying out different apple crisp recipes forever and this is definitely the best! Crunchy but moist and so delicious.
The only thing I added was a sprinkle of white sugar tobthe apples before adding the rest of the ingredients.

I made this apple crisp for desert over the weekend. although the melted butter didn't crumble the cake mix as much as I would've liked it still came out delicious.  I plan to save this recipe and use it over and over again it is SOOOOOOOOOO easy!!!!!!!!!!!

Guests went crazy over this. I followed the other reviews' suggestions and squeezed fresh lemon over the cut apples. I also used oatmeal in the am brown sugar mixture. Great tips- made the recipe even more delicious.

This is such a simple but tasty recipe, and great to make with the kids!  I also used 3/4 cup of brown sugar but otherwise it's a real crowd pleaser and a great way to use up those extra apples picked at the farm!

Excellent recipe for Apple Crisp and it is extremely easy. The only change I will make the next time will be to cut down on the brown sugar. It was too sweet for my taste. I put a half cup of brown sugar and a half cup of Splenda. Next time I will put less and I think it will be perfect. But I recommend this recipe to everyone. You just have to adjust the sweetness to your taste

I LOVE this recipe. It's quick. easy. no fail. Perfect for serving at parties or gatherings when you have a ton of other things to make because it's so quick and has a short list of ingredients. My only critique is that if you don't like VERY sweet things, ease up on the amount of sugar.

I used JOSIEMAI's revisions: use 3/4 cup water, use only 3/4c brown sugar, bake for only 40-45 minutes, and add rolled oats to the cake mixture.  Then for my own revision, I used spice cake mix instead of white cake mix, which made it so flavorful and perfect.
The family loved this!!! 
I made it Friday night and again Saturday night since it was so requested and the whole dish had been eaten the night before. 
Definitely a recipe that I will keep and make many times.

After reading the reviews, I used Granny Smith large apples, made it with less brown sugar, and added Pecans to the topping.  

Very good!  I am giving it only a 4 because I tweaked the recipe otherwise, it is a 5.

I made this recipe exactly as listed.  I tried it because I had a bunch of green apples and a box of cake mix that I wanted to use up.  It was way, WAY too sweet for me.  Too much sugar in the cake mix and too much brown sugar mixed in, I suspect.  I won't be trying a cake mix crumble again.

I would make this over and over. Easy, and I made a sugar free version using sugar free cake mix, fruit filling sweetened with  splenda and splenda brown sugar. My husband raves about this recipe. This is a easy, quick dessert. Definitely  a keeper.

I made this recipe with fresh apples just as directed.  Everyone loved it! I have received so many text messages asking for the recipe that I finally saved it on my phone so that I could easily text the recipe back. 

I get frustrated when people ding a recipe when they've made changes. Try it first and then "tweak" it for your family. It really was a hit at our large family get together. I eventually added a little more cinnamon but decide for yourself. :)

This has become my new 'go to' dessert. My husband LOVED it and he rarely 'loves' sweets. I am fixing this today and will be using a Spice Cake mix.  Other than cake mix changes I've added oats to the dry mixture, use 2 cans of pie filling, and cut back on the white sugar. All per suggestions made by other Reviewers. Thank you for this recipe!!

This apple crisp is a hit every time I make it! I make sure to use granny smith apples and yellow cake mixture each time.  I also add about a half cup of quick cooking oats for more texture in the topping. The Granny Smiths tend to hold up better with baking and the tart flavor is a nice counterpoint to the sweet topping.  Sometimes I add two or three extra apples on top of what the recipe calls for if I will be feeding more people and it works out great!  I will be making this recipe again and again!

It was too dry and I had to bake it an extra 40 min. to get the apples soft enough. I doubt I will make it again.

Great recipe, really enjoyed my lightened up version except it was a little sweet for my taste.  I made 1/2 the recipe in a 9" pan using 1 can of lite apple pie filling , 1/2 of a sugar free cake mix, no brown sugar and other ing in recipe.   I drizzled the apples with a small amount of sugar free caramel syrup and served with lite cool whip and no sugar added ice cream, prefer the later.  Next time I will make 1/2 the recipe in an 8 " pan, no caramel syrup and add oatmeal or flax, to add whole grain and cut the sweetness.

This was very similar to my mom's apple crisp that she made when I was a kid. I followed her recipe by using two cans of apple pie filling (Target brand worked great), no water needed, yellow cake mix, and after spreading the cake mixture over the apples, I melted 1/4 cup of butter and sprinkled over the top layer with a little nutmeg. Didn't go the full time on this recipe...but about 45 minutes instead. This was so good that I had to be disciplined at only back for seconds...once! Enjoy!

I reduced the water and brown sugar to 3/4 cup each. I used honey crisp apples to get the right amount of sweetness. For a change I substituted white cake mix with Apple Carmel cake mix. This was a huge hit with my family. Next time I'll make two!

Well, I kind of screwed up and I actually made up the white cake mix before pouring it over the apple slices, so it turned out more like "apple crisp cake" than actual apple crisp.

BUT, the thing is, it was SO GOOD. It was fluffy and delicious and my husband loved it and actually asked me to make the same thing for a potluck at his work.

I'm sure the normal recipe is great, but if you want something softer, try the "cake" version!

Absolutely delicious! The only thing I would do next time is cut the amount of brown sugar to 3/4 cup or maybe 1/2 cup so it isn't quite as sweet.

This was a hit!  Everyone wanted the recipe.   I took the advice from the reviews and reduced the water and brown sugar to 1/2 cup each.  Once I added apples and water to dish I  sprinked them with cinnamon and just a bit of pumpkin pie spice and left the cinnamon out if the topping mix and then sprinkled the topping  with cinnamon.   It was sweet and delicious.  I would caution against using a full cup of brown sugar. It would be way too much!  Easy and yummy dessert!

It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't make it as is again.  I would double the apples, toss them in the cinnamon and sugar and add a bit of nutmeg.

After making this 3 times I finally got it right. Use only 3/4 c brown sugar and 3/4 c apple juice instead of water. Also used spice cake mix. Easy and delicious.

I love this recipe and have made it many times.  It is always a hit at holiday dinners. It is extremely easy and tastes great.  My only change up is to add a pinch of nutmeg along with the cinnamon because I like the depth of flavor it adds. I also use one or two more apples depending on how big they are overall. I also squeeze a little fresh lemon juice over the apple slices.

This is by far the favorite apple crisp. I reduced the water to about half cup and I prefer to put a light sprinkle of cinnamon directly on top of the apples along with the suggested amount for the  topping.

QUICK, EASY & YUMMY. I made this recipe exactly as written and topped it with vanilla ice cream while it was still warm. It was awesome & everyone loved it.  The second time I made it, I added oatmeal & I loved it that way too. Next time I'll try it with less brown sugar as it is very sweet.  This is the only Apple Crisp recipe I'll use from now on. Thanks for sharing !!!

This was the easiest and most delicious apple crisp I've ever made! I'd recommend using sweet apples (such as Pink Lady) and having vanilla ice cream on hand as a compliment to the crisp. You won't go wrong with it!

Easy peezy, love the recipe. Only miss the oatmeal topping crunchy. So we will be adding it next time. Also, we cut our apples twice the width and a third the length. We just love the results.

Excellent! Used two Granny Smith apples and three or four Braeburn apples. Added about 1/2 cup of white sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg to apple mixture.  Also added 3/4 c quick oats to cake yellow vanilla cake mix. Gave it a good crunch.

This was great and easy!  I added the oats and nutmeg and it was perfect.  I also used apple pie filling to make it easier.  Definitely a recipe I will make again soon.

Simply scrumptious and very easy to make!  We have "food days" at my job. I was bringing something else but the night before was asked to also bring a dessert.  I made this using honey crisp apples and like others, reduced the amount of water. I took a tiny piece before I went to a 1 hour meeting. When I returned it was ALL GONE and the other desserts were still there.  I received a ton of compliments on the taste and texture.    This recipe is another winner.  Thanks for helping build my reputation as an excellent cook :-)!

Easy. quick and fun.  Next time I will double the amount of apples (and keep everything else the same), for us the ratio to apples vs topping was not what we wanted.  It ended up being too sweet.  Also, with the apple amount doubled, I hope some apples will remain more firm if I use just 1 c of water as they turned out similar to apple sauce the first time I made.  I will make again :)

This apple crisp is easy and delicious.  It's the perfect apple crisp.  The only thing I did different was that I used a caramel apple cake mix because that was all I had.  Also, I used soft, room temperature butter, not melted butter.  I only wish I had some vanilla ice cream to go on top!  This recipe is absolutely a keeper.  I cannot wait to make it for friends and family this holiday season!!!

This is delicious!  I would cut down on the brown sugar - maybe 1/2 cup instead of a whole cup.  It's a little sweet.  I used a yellow cake mix because that is what was in the pantry and Fuji apples from my fridge. East to make and smells so good cooking. A scoop of vanilla ice cream is the perfect topper.

I made this recipe this afternoon, I used Apple cider rather then  water, and did put oats and also raisins in the topping. I used eight med. Granny Smith and gala apples...house smelled wonderful. Hubby and I tasted it out of the oven, delicious! Will have it for dessert tonight with vanilla ice cream and warmed caramel sauce drizzled over it. My new Apple crisp recipe, I did use a white cake mix if I had a spice or caramel mix I would of tried that! Great recipe! Will make often!

I made this with blackberries. Only used about 3/4 cup of water and baked 45 minutes. We all loved it! I didn't know if it would be crispy with no oats but it is perfect.

I love this recipe.  I actually add oatmeal to the crumb topping and I use 12 apples-6 green 6 red.  I serve it at all my family gatherings. :-)

Quick, easy and delicious! Made this exactly as listed, except I added a 1/2 teaspoon more of cinnamon as we love that spice in this house.  Thanks so much for sharing!

The only good thing about this recipe was adding the water to the apples as it gave a good sauce.  The topping was disgusting.

This came out great! I made it as directed, although I considered reducing the water. In the future, I could see doing that to allow the apples to keep a little more crisp, but my whole family loved the apples mushy.

I liked this but it was too sweet.  I made it again using only 1/2 cup of water and 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  Baked it for 40 mins at 350.  It was delicious!

I added about 3/4 cup chopped pecans to the cake mix.  I had to add about a tbsp extra  butter to get the extra ingredient to blend in the climb mixture.  It turned out perfect and you can't beat the easiness.

Great easy recipe. I was looking for something sweet with few ingredients.  I didnt have apples so I used frozen peaches and canned pears and used the pear juice instead of water. I also added pecans. Delish!

Thanks for the recipe and for the other comments. I will use this again. Love using the white cake mix.

If you are looking or a super delicious apple crisp with a buttery crust!! This is it!! I made this for my family and we LOVE IT!!! Its very easy to make and even easier to Eat!!..LOL YOu can do this receipt with peeled apples or canned apples either way, its good.  Although if you use real apples, don't use the green sour apples, it 's best to use the red sweeter apples. Hope this helps!! Thanks for posting this receipt.

I gave this 5 stars as I made it and that is adding less sugar. I added 1/2 cup and it was still too sweet. Next time I would add NO sugar. I used 3/4 cup water and some vanilla. I also browned the butter a little and added some oatmeal to the cake mix. Excellent recipe and very, very simple!

This was so good! I used 3/4 c oats as well. What makes it even better is a carmel cake mix! We were out of yellow and white. All we had was carmel so we used it and it was delicious. Try it!

This recipe turned out really well for me and was a hit, I had one change however for my lack of other options, and used a lemon cake mix instead of the white, and it gave it an extra tang flavor that went great with the apples!

I took other people's suggestions into consideration when making this recipe. I added 1 Cup of Quick Oats and I decreased the water to 2/3 Cup and the Brown sugar to 3/4 Cup. Oh and I used a Butter Cake mix. It turned out GREAT! It was a hit with my husband and I can't wait to make it again.

I am unable to give it a "5" since I did not actually use the white cake mix. Only had an angel food cake mix and do not know if that may have made it too sweet. Next time I'll try adding the 1/2 cup of rolled oats for more texture along with recommended cake mix.

Dont have a lot of time on my hands to make home cooked deserts. This apple crisp is quick and easy. You can even switch out the apples for peaches or even blueberries.  I would recommed this to anyone.

Each time I use this receipe, I get deliciously consistant results.  I specifically use fuji apples since they provide a naturally sweeter taste.

This is awesome, thank you for the post and suggestions!  The 1st time it was perfect to my taste - I used 3 lbs granny smith apples, 1/2 cup water +  t cornstarch, 1 T vanilla, 2 T honey (instead of sugar), 1 t cinnamon, and a bit of nutmeg & cloves.  Added strawberries to half of it, they added color, but no taste. For the topping I used 1/3 cup melted Smart Blend Butter,  3/4 cup oatmeal, 1 yellow jiffy cake mix and 1 jiffy apple cinnamon muffin mix and baked it for about 1/2 hr.  2nd time made it the same except: no berries, used mixed apples (not as good), used a salad shooter to slice the apples and it was easier (not sure I like them so thinly sliced though), didn't add the cloves (will add next time), added lemon (good addition), used reduced sugar cake mix, 1 cup oatmeal, 1/3 cup regular butter + 2 T applesauce.  The topping was not as crunchy, a little more chewy -don't know if it was the differece in cake mixes or butter, the extra 1/4 cup oatmeal, or the applesauce or a combination. I loved the crunchiness of the 1st batch and will leave out the apple sauce next time.  Also added walnuts to some of this batch, but prefer it without.   I liked it so much I sent the recipe to some of my family and friends and can't wait to make it with my grandaughters now that they are old enough to help.

This was the best apple crisp I have ever had!  I would recommend it to anyone.  The only changes I made was I only used 3/4 cup of water, I added 1/2 cup Quaker Oats to the cake mixture, and I lightly sprinkled the apples with cinnamon & white sugar.  If you're looking for an apple crisp recipe that everyone will love, this is it!

This has been the best apple crisp reciped I've made. Like others I added oats to the cake mixture and spiced the apples with nutmeg, cinnamon and a dash of sugar. So very yummy with vanilla ice cream. Thanks for a easy great recipe with minimal ingredients.

Great recipe and very easy!  I also made some of the changes that others did as well.  I added lemon juice to the apples and sprinkled them with nutmeg, cinnamon and allspice.  I used 1/2 cup of water and added 3/4 cups of oats to the topping.  I also cut the amount of brown sugar in half, but next time I think I'll try cutting it down to 1/4 cup as it was still a bit sweet for me.  I also think I will double the amount of apples next time too.  I'll definitely make this again!

This is a fantastic and simple recipe.  I used prepackaged Boston Market caramel apples and it was even easier.  I've never been a fan of most apple crisps because I don't like the oatmeal, but this was a spectacular alternative.  The hardest part of this recipe is sharing it with others!

I use canned  apple pie filling for this and also add two packs of instant cinnamon oatmeal on top for added crispness.  It's a good, easy dessert to whip up.   Warning though - it is VERY sweet.

This is sooo good and easy.  I also made it with blackberries and it is really good that way as well.  I use the Splenda Brown sugar mix to make it a little more healthy :) I sent it to my mom and she loved it as well.

Sooooooooo Good!  I followed others suggestions and added 3/4 cup oats, and cut the brown sugar to 3/4 cup and the water to 1/2 cup.  Before adding the cake mix topping, I drizzled caramel sundae ice cream topping over the apples!  I will make this many times again!

This was very good. I used a butter cake mix. I add only 3/4 cup water rather that 1 cup to the apples. I sprinkled some lemonjuice and cinnamon onto the apples as well. I did not add the brown sugar - as I did not think the cake mx would need to be sweetened more. I added 2 eggs instead of the buttter to the cake mix, and I added some cinnamon and some slow cooking oats to the cake mix and sprinkled some on top of the cake. This was a lighter texture than a regular crisp - but still very good.

I used French Vanilla cake mix as it is all I had on hand.  Didn't come out too "crisp" and it is very sweet.  Hubby loves it though!

i changed alittle (for time). i used the 2 cans filling, and used about 1/4 cup dark brown sugar and a sprinkle of cinnamon. Quick, and very tasty for the sweet tooth, costing only about $7 to make.... i will make again :)

This was super easy and absolutely delicious. Often, I am too busy to make things from scratch and I love to incorporate convenience foods into my dishes.  This dish turned out great!  I made this for a summer cook-out party and everyone raved about it!  I will definitely be making this one again.  This one is a keeper!

I don't mean to offend, but I did not care for this recipe. "An apple dessert with a cake mix on top" is the only thing I can use to describe it. My not-picky, dessert-loving hubby didn't even go for it.

This was extremely delicious! I only used 4 apples(which was plenty i think- it covered the whole pan) and only 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and 1/2 cup white sugar and sprinkled extra cinnamon on top- it will definetly be getting made again at our house in the future!!

I loved this recipe. It is easy to put together and delicious. I did add less water (3/4 cup) and added additional cinnamon and some nutmeg and vanilla to the water before putting it on the apples. I also used a yellow cake mix (because it is what I had on hand) and it worked fine.Thanks!

I made this for Thanksgiving today and it was delicious and easy!  I wish I had read the reviews first because I used the full 1 cup of water and it was too much.  I used a pound cake mix because that is what I had but it looks like, according to my experience and the reviews, just about any cake mix can be used successfully.  Definetly worth making - give it a try!

This is a great dessert for someone who is not dieting but wants to still limit their dessert intake. The result is so sweet that you really don't want to have another helping but not too sweet that you won't nibble once in awhile. I substituted spice cake mix and used 2/3 cup brown sugar and no cinnamon due to the spice cake. For the apples I used 9 apples and 1/3 cup organic apple cider (its a little sweeter) and 1/2 cup water which made the apples sweet enough but not too much. I also added oatmeal on top. Even with changes it was sweet but it wasn't too bad. I would probably make it again for a pot luck because of the ease but the result at home was just okay.

This is a super easy and "Little Helper" friendly recipe.  I used some suggestions and ommited the water, used some lemon juice on the apples, and added about a cup of oatmeal to the crumble topping.  The best part is my 2 1/2 yr old was able to help mommy put the ingredients in the bowl, mix, scoop, and spread topping on the apples.  Not to mention eating an apples worth of slices.  This is very sweet even with the lemon juice on the apples.  You may want to try a tart apple to balance the flavors.

Perfect, tasty and quick!  I used golden yellow cake mix instead, I think it came out a little more butter tasting which we liked. Made this and served with "Cinnamon Ice Cream" for a BBQ and got rave reviews of both.  The hardest part about this recipe was peeling the apples, the rest was so easy, yet it tasted wonderful.

It was a good recipe... but I redid it by adding 1/8 tsp vanilla extract, 1/8 tsp almond extract, 1/8 tsp baking soda, 1/4 cup chopped walnuts, and a little nutmeg.  
I guess I was looking for a more complex mix of flavors... Still, the original recipe is good, but as the other reviewers commented, too much water is added.

This was absolutely delicious! The only change I made was to decrease the brown sugar to 1/2 cup. Next time I will omit sugar as it was still very sweet, though incredibly tasty. Great way to use up the mass quantity of apples I had!

Easy and tasty!!  I took the advice of the other posts and only added 1/2 cup water.  I also added 1 cup oatmeal.  YUMMY!!  Serve this apple crisp warm with vanilla ice cream, caramel sauce and whipped cream and you have yourself a fabulous dessert!!  Will make again, and again!!

Very reminiscent of the "Dump" cake.  Delicious!  I, too, added 1/4 C rolled oats to the cake mix-butter mixture.  There was still some liquid at the bottom of the pan but it thickened up a bit upon cooling.  I used apples we'd just picked at a Michigan orchard 2 days earlier!  YUMMY!

This was excellent!  I would definitely make it again.  I did cut brown sugar to 1/2 cup and I used apple cider instead of water.  Very tasty!  (I used MacIntosh apples...gave a some tart to the sweet of the topping)

This is a great and easy recipe.  I've made it a number of times for lots of occasions, and it's become rather infamous.  Last year I was even asked to make it for a friend's wedding.  Great stuff.

This recipe was disappointing. The only good thing about it was the substitution of spice cake mix for white. Otherwise, it was time-consuming and not worth it. The topping was flavorful, but the apples themselves were bland. I didn't take the time to peel the apples, but it wouldn't have been worth the effort if I had. Next time I make apple crisp, I'll use canned apple filling instead.

This recipe is awesome!!!  I used canned apples and added just a few personal touches, such as vanilla, nutmeg, and I used apples with splenda.  This is a keeper for sure.

I have made several different apple crisp recipes, but this was the easiest (using cake mix) and very, very good.  My guests ate this over my homemade cheesecake and pumpkin pie on Christmas Eve.  Serve with real whipped cream....yummy.  Thanks for this great quick recipe.

Very good! I followed the suggestion of some of the reviewers and cut back on the sugar ... a definite keeper!! 
I realized half way through putting the apple crisp together that I was out of cinnamon so I used pumpkin pie spice instead which turned out very well.

This is a great recipe-definitely a keeper. i served it at my halloween party-the perfect dish for a chilly day. it got rave reviews. i used the suggestion in the description and used the pie filling to substitute and it worked beautifully. Good taste-not the best i've ever had (although some of my guests would say differently) but 5 stars just because it's so darn easy and tastes good too!

This is the apple crisp recipe I've been looking for!   I used a cinnamon swirl cake mix, decreased the brown sugar by half, and added about 1/2 cup of oats.  Perfect.

This recipe is amazing. My husband loved it and he is not one to eat apple anything. The white cake mix gave it that little something that most apple crisps are missing. This will be a permanent addition to my recipe collection.:)

This is soooo good.  My husband loved and my mother in law wanted the receipe. I've made it twice, once with yellow cake mix and once with butter cake mix. Great both times. I did sprinkle some cinnamon on the apple as others suggest.

excellent. Made changes as others stated. If apples aren't real sweet, add a little br sugar when mixing up apples.

Easy is right!!  Loved making this.  I changed a couple of things to make it more low calorie. I used a 1/4c Splenda and a 1/4c brown sugar.  I used olive oil instead of the butter and I added a 1/3c of oatmeal.  I took it to a potluck and had RAVE reviews!!

I loved making this recipe. It was easy. I didn't have the white cake mix, instead I used the yellow cake mix and it did come out too sweet but good. My kids loved it and I will be making it again. Now I know what to do with all the left over apples the kids don't want.

Delicious, I tried it out for the first time with company coming and everyone loved it. I like a lot of topping and this recipe delivers on the amount of topping to cover the pan. I took the advice of 1/2c sugar and 1/2 cup oats. It was still quite sweet I think I will try a 1/4 cup of sugar next time.

The dough in this recipe was very gooey,  I added a little brown sugar for texture. It was simple and mildly tasty, but perfect for my leftover apples.

I was too lazy to cut up apples so I used the pie filling.  I also used 1/2cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup oatmeal in the topping.  I used real butter and mixed in 1tsp vanilla and dash of nutmeg.  I served with caramel ice cream topping and cool whip.  DELICIOUS!  I will agree very sweet, but would probably be less sweet with real apples.  Would be delicious with vanilla ice cream.  Looking forward to making again!

This was super easy, and tastes FABULOUS! We had friends over for dinner tonight, and had forgotten all about pudding... made this last minute, and it is so yummy, especially with vanilla ice cream! Did toss apples with nutmeg, cinnamon and nutmeg before adding water.

This is delicious and very easy to make. What a great idea using cake mix as the topping. Next time I make it I will mix the apples with brown sugar and cinnamon before putting them in the dish. I thought they tasted a bit bland. I baked it for 50 minutes and felt it would have baked in 40-45. Definitely a keeper!

Delicious hot w/ vanilla ice cream or cold out of the fridge the next day.  Added the oats which was wonderful; did not reduce the sugar as recommended but will next time.  May even omit it if I serve w/ ice cream again.  Wonder about trying it with peaches?!?!

This was so easy to make. It was so yummy even my picky two year old ate it! I added raisins because my husband asked me to make an apple raisin crisp and I think it gave it a little extra kick.

This is my first time making apple crisp, and I cannot believe how good this recipe turned out.  I followed advise from fellow reviewers and cut down the water and brown sugar, added a handful of oatmeal and sliced almonds.  This recipe is a keeper!!

Not bad, but not the best either. I made it because I was out of flour and had a white cake mix. I like apple crisp better with oats. This was ok, but a little too sweet. I don't think we'll be able to eat the rest of it.
I gave it 4 stars because it was so quick to make and I can see how some people would like this recipe. I think I'll stick with the Apple Crisp II recipe from this site.

Wow, I am really suprised at the way this turned out. I was expecting a cake like texture, but the "crust" is supprisingly crunchy.  I cut this in half and only cooked it for about 30 mins as the edges were starting to turn dark brown.  I didn't peel the apples as I prefer extra fibre.  Overall, this is very good, although I would add some oatmeal to the batter next time as I like a crumbly topping.

It is very sweet.  Next time I'll reduce the brown sugar by half.  I would like to try this recipe substituting peaches for the apples.  I think it would the perfect topping for a tarter fruit

It was easy to make but everyone thought it was too sweet. I doubt I'll make this one again.

I used a mixture of 7 apples - whatever I had around.  It is very sweet - I might try a little lemon juice mixed in with the apples next time.  Put it in 2 8 inch square pans - kept one and froze one for another time.  Would definitely make it again.

This was delicious and soooo easy!!  My girlfriend from New England said that it was the best apple crisp she has ever tasted!!  The only modification I did was add in 1 cup of dried cranberries.  As others have suggested, next time I will try some oatmeal in the topping for a little more texture.

Yum! Yum! Yum!  A nice change of pace from traditional apple crisps made with oatmeal.  I made it just as written with maybe a tad extra cinnamon.  Everybody loved it!

I thought using the cake mix in the topping made it way too concentrated and sweet.  I prefer the oatmeal top variety of apple crips.

I used 7 apples and 2/3 c. water. I also sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on them. I added about 2/3c. rolled oats and some chopped pecans to the topping. This is fab! I have replaced my old crisp recipe with this, yummy!

This was THE absolute BEST apple crisp I have EVER had! I would give this recipe higher than a 5 star rating! 
The only thing different I did with this recipe, is that I sprinkled some cinnamon and about 1/8 teaspoon of ground nutmeg over the apples after placing the apples in the pan. 
Thank you for sharing this recipe. I'll use this one time and time again!

My family did not like this. I thought it was o.k. I like the oatmeal apple crisp better. If you make this the ice cream on top is a must. It made it taste a lot better.

This is a very good and easy recipe.  I love it and will continue to make it.  I used Granny Smith apples, and maybe next time will use something not so tart.

Wow, this was terrific!  My family loved it!  The only thing - the dish should've been sprayed or greased before putting in the ingredients - the crust stuck badly!  It took 2 days soaking to get it out!

This was phenomenal!  We had it last night and everyone wanted it for breakfast it was so good.  I used yellow cake mix instead of white and Jonathan apples that were starting not to look their best.

I made this for a family get-together and everyone said they really liked it.  I, however, thought it was just a touch too sweet, possibly because I used apple pie filling. The next time I make it, and I will, I will definitely cut back on the sugar and add a little more cinnamon to strengthen the apple taste.

This is a great dessert for the fall. It was easy and delicious. I used 3/4 cup of water and sprinkled the top of the apples with some vaniila extract. I also used a little bit more cinnamon. It got a little too crusty on the top, so next time i won't bake it as long. Maybe 40 minutes tops. Great Recipe!

This recipe is great!  I like to throw a little more cinnamon in with the apples to make a nice gooey, cinnamony filling.
