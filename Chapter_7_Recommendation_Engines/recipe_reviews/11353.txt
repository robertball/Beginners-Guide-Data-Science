Excellent recipe!!!  Everyone loves these cookies.  I did omit the cream of tatar, simply because I didn't have any.  I have tried this recipe with both butter and margarine, and butter makes a much tastier cookie. :-)  Thanks, Jan!!!

I was looking for a recipe to mess with to make a peppermint cookie, and this was a winner. I omitted the vanilla and cream of tartar and added 1/4 c. finely crushed candy canes (down to pretty much a powder) and 2 1/2 t. peppermint extract. Then I rolled them in more crushed candy canes and sugar (probably about 1/3 c. and 1/8 c., respectively), and did not flatten them. They turned out extremely well and have become my favorite Christmas cookie this year!

When they first came out of the oven the were wonderful. After they cooled they still tasted good but were a bit crumbly. Overall I will use this recipe again.

These are so yummy!  We've made them at least 4 times since discovering the recipe a couple of weeks ago!  I was out of shortening so I substituted butter...they were good but a little flatter and crispier.  The recipe yields about 24 medium sized cookies.  I did not flatten the cookies before baking and they turned out great!  We covered them in a simple powdered sugar glaze (powdered sugar + water) and they were great!  I've used regular shortening, butter flavored shortening, and regular butter and they have turned out great each time!

These were absolutely tasty!  And easy.  I feel the name "sugar cookies" was a little deceiving though as they aren't exactly the same flavor/texture.  They were so easy though - I will definitely use them again.

I loved this recipe. It is somewhat similar to the Betty Crocker No Roll Sugar Cookies. I come back to this recipe again and again. Try the "Butter Icing for Cookies" recipe on these!

This is just the recipe I was looking for! I love the flavor & texture of these cookies, not to mention how easy they are to make! I like to bake them a tiny bit longer so they come out nice & crisp! I also sprinkle some superfine sugar on them just as they come out of the oven for extra sparkle.

My husband loves this recipe.  He's made is several times.  It's so easy to make my young daughter often helps.  Very tasty, similar to shortbread.  I look forward to experiementing with flavorings like orange and almond.

These are very good!  I didn't think they tasted like shortbread at all, they were a perfect sugar cookie.  I didn't have any shortening so I had to use all margerine but they still came out great!  I will keep this recipe around, thanks for sharing it!

I was initially pleased to find such a simple recipe for sugar cookies however, this is the most minimal that any baked product can be and still be called a cookie. It's not that it's bad. It's just nothing special. The end result was also very dry. Seemed to me like more of a sweet biscuit than a sugar cookie. Definitely not the melt-in-your-mouth texture that the overview claims.

Good and easy - my kind of cookie !!!  I made the recipe exactly as written.  They are more crispy than soft and chewy.  I would make again for sure.

Okay so I doctored this up but it was so easy to do and tasted SO yum that I'm sure the base recipe would be 5 stars.  I used 1 cup butter as I didn't have shortening, I used 1 tsp of peppermint essence and 1/2tsp of vanilla.  I added a cup of choc chips and green coloring.  Basically I made Mint Choc-chip cookies.  YUM!!!

I am so happy to find a recipe for a fluffy, soft sugar cookie! I didn't have cream of tarter so I used baking powder instead. These cookies have a delicious flavor and a delightful texture. I will absolutely be using this as my sugar cookie recipe from now on.

Instead of regular shortening I used Crisco butter shortening.  I could not believe how fluffy the batter was as I made the balls.  Very nice.  Definitely a keeper!

I am so glad I found this recipe.  The only thing I did different was , I grated some orange zest into the dough, which I also put into my frosting. Hubby just came in and snitched a cookie and said they are delicous... Thanks for the wonderful recipe.. Pattie.:O)

YUM!  I use 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white flour and they turn out wonderful!  I top with a simple icing made with butter, powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and if desired, food coloring for a holiday.  On my first try, my hubby asked for these again!

It's a shortbread cookie, which is my favorite cookie. It was wounderful surprise. It taste great, but I wouldn't try to do cut out. If you want the sugar, I would roll the 1 1/2" log of dough in colored sugar then slice them about 1/4" thick. I'm only giving it 4 stars, because it's not a sugar cookie

We made these cookies for Santa this past Christmas. Santa left my daughter a note telling her how delicious they were! ;-) To make them fun and festive, we made some frosting out of confectioners sugar and put Christmas colored sprinkles on top.

Love this recipe! Started making this almost 2 years ago and everyone loves them.  I put a powdered sugar glaze on them.  Have made them with and without flattening them and they turn out great both ways.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This had to be the easiest cookie recipe I've ever made.  The only thing I changed was adding about 6 or 7 crushed round peppermint candies into the mix and then I baked them as directed.  I got NOTHING but great reviews, mostly about the texture, which is a wonderful 'melt in your mouth' crumble.  thanks for a simple holiday sugar cookie recipe that is easy and adjustable.  Personally, I wouldn't change a thing.

Just made this recipe.  Happened to have cream of tartar on hand, followed recipe with no modifications.  Cooked 10.5 min, turned out wonderful.  Not to crispy, not too cakey, tender yet not falling apart when frosted.  Good recipe, will use again.  Usually kitchens cringe in fear when I approach, and fill with smoke or burst into flames on occasion so if you too, are "baking challenged", this is a recipe that will work.

Very same recipe as "tender crisp," propotionately.  Close to "sugar cookies V," too.  They spread too much for cutouts, even after refrigeration.  "Sugar cookies with buttercream frosting" I liked better.

Am baking a batch as I type. I had to try the first one and WOW!! Perfect. I made as stated. I did sprinkle sugar on top and do criss cross with a fork. I used a #25 disher and it worked just right. Perfect size. Thanks for sharing.

these were soooo good! i was looking for a macadamia nut cookie, without any other add-ins, which i couldn't find. so i ended up making these and adding some chopped unsalted macadamia nuts. the cookie is perfect and melt in your mouth good and the nuts added a nice crunch.
**made these again for chrismtas minus the macadamia nuts. they look so pretty when you roll the balls in colored sugar before you flatten and bake them! the taste is perfect, light, airy, buttery and good.

These cookies were ok, but I have tasted far better sugar cookies.  The vanilla flavoring was bland, so I added almond extract which did make them taste much better...I would definitely recommend doing this.  However, I am still not overly impressed.

Excellent cookies!  Very light, very crisp with a delicate flavor.  I used Crisco for the 1/2 c shortening and it worked very well.

One big plus to this recipe was that it doesn't require any refrigeration - my 3 year old helper doesn't have the patience for cookie recipes that require refigeration!  We'll be making this one again.

Hooray! I finally found THE recipe I needed. My husband was obsessed with a cookie that was discontinued, so I decided to try to recreate the recipe. I have no baking experience, but after trying a new batch every day for a week and with the help of this recipe, I finally got the right flavor and, most importantly, texture. 

These cookies really do melt in your mouth. They have a fine, soft crumb and are not chewy, crispy, crumbly, or heavy. They are also great after spending the night in the fridge. 

I changed the recipe just a tiny bit: I used butter only (no shortening), doubled the confectioners' sugar, and used baking powder instead of baking soda and cream of tartar. 

I found that keeping the butter and egg at room temperature made a big difference in the cookie's texture (it made it lighter). 

Apparently it's also important not to over-mix the flour, so as soon as I got the batter to the right consistency (soft but not sticking to my fingers), I formed the cookies using sugar on my work surface - not flour. I did not refrigerate the batter.

I took the cookies out of the oven after 8 minutes - BEFORE they started to brown at the edges. Hubby is very happy, and I am feeling very empowered. Thank you for the wonderful recipe! I can't believe what a huge difference a few small ingredient changes can make.

My husband and I didn't care for the texture of these cookies. They were crumbly and had to much salt. I followed the recipe exactly. I had made a rolled out version previously and they were fantastic. These were gross.

Just made these cookies and they are wonderful.  My 9 yr old says they are the best cookies she's ever had!  Hot out of the over, they are very fragile.  Don't know yet if they will get crumbly after they cool.(They may not last that long!)

Wow! I was really impressed! These turned out excellent! I found 10 minutes was a little too long in my oven so 8-9 minutes was perfect. I made a cream cheese frosting to go with it and it helped keep them soft the next day even! Will be making these a lot!

I made these in a jam for a dinner/scotch party.  I used colored sugar and some Kahlua martini rim sugar to press down on the cookies and it really added a nice color/flavor to go with some Irish coffee at the end of the night.
These were SO quick and SO easy and pretty darn good.  I'm very impressed and happy to have a short time sugar cookie.  Thank you!

o holy wonderful these are good!!  just as written i believe they may be the best sugar cookies ever.  before baking i took scoops of the dough, rolled in a ball, then rolled them in colored sugar (blue and yellow for a themed bridal shower), pressed down slightly with a cup, and baked as directed....they looked fabulous and tasted heavenly!

Very good!  I panicked this afternoon as I remembered I had "snack duty" for an event tonight.  I made these drop cookies (used 1/2 almond extract and 1/2 vanilla), frosted with a basic confectioners sugar glaze (also with almond extract) and they were very good.  Great, fast cookie!

We LOVE these No Roll Sugar Cookies. Followed recipe until the strange instruction:'Dip glass in white sugar & press balls flat.' I did NOT do that. Sugar does not adhere to a dry surface so that instruction would be pointless. Instead, I used the bottom of the drinking glass only to flatten the cookies evenly on the cookie sheet. I took my fingers & wet them under the faucet, 'painted' a glaze of water on the tops of the flattened cookies so the sugar would stick (don't know if that's necessary, but I did it), then just sprinkled a bit of white sugar according to our taste on top of flattened cookies. Set the timer for 8 minutes & when the timer went off I stood at the oven & checked the cookies often until they were starting to 'tan' around the edges. I don't have an oven light so I use a flashlight to get a quick look before shutting the oven door so the heat doesn't escape. Just a tip. This No Roll Sugar Cookie recipe leaves you room to sweeten it with as much or little topping / frosting as you want which is very smart. When I made a 2nd batch from the same dough that was refrigerated the dough wanted to stick to the bottom of the glass. I did the first batch of cookies that did not stick with dough I'd just made that was room temp. Reviews also mentioned 'you can't roll out these cookies'. Um. Hence the title: 'NO Roll Sugar Cookies.' This is our Sugar Cookie recipe from now on!

These are more of a shortbread than sugar cookie. But they are super yummy and perfect for decorating with royal icing or eating alone. Will definitely keep this recipe. Tried the glass with sugar and without, prefer without. Next time, will try with 1 tsp almond extract!

Baked these wonderful sugar cookies last Friday for my 14 month old grandson who has both a dairy and egg allergy.  Followed the recipe as written but had to use vegan substitute-- Crisco butter sticks and Ener G egg replacer. Added a little more vanilla to make up for bland Crisco Butter Sticks. Cookies were sweet, crisp, not hard and they melted in your mouth. Also dipped 1/2 a batch of baked cookies in a basic hard sugar cookie glaze. My grandson loved them as did the adults and big kids. They couldn't believe they were vegan. After rolling out sugar cookies for over 40 years, this drop cookie will be my new go to sugar cookie recipe. Thanks so much for sharing it.

I like these cookies. Kinda a mix between a shortbread and a sugar cookie. I decided to add the ingredients you would find in Nestle Drumsticks by adding Nestle's Goobers (chocolate covered peanuts) and crumbled sugar cones covered in milk chocolate.

I used 2 sticks of unsalted butter instead of using shortening. I left the butter out for 2 days so it would be nice and soft. When making these cookies, I had "helpers", my 7 and 4 year old. Very easy recipe to follow. More shortbread tasting in my opinion then a sugar cookie, but I am not complaining. These cookies are delicious and even my super picky 7 year old had 2 as soon as they came out of the oven. Thanks for sharing!

I have been looking for something easy as a basic sugar cookie.  This was finally the recipe I have been looking for.  I didn't have to roll out and cut it, which never works out well for me.  These were better the next day, and I used a butter frosting recipe with this and it was the perfect sugar cookie.  I will make these again and again for holidays.  I didn't even have to press down sugar on top before cooking since I made a homemade frosting.

This was a great sugar cookie recipe. I did not have any shortening, to my dismay, but I was glad I didn't use any because I used 1 cup (2 sticks) of butter instead and they were so light and buttery. The key here is to cream until fluffy...and sift the flour in like the recipe states. This makes a lighter dough. I chilled the cookie dough, overcame my temptation to eat it straight out of the bowl and made mini cookie tarts which once they were cooled I filled with vanilla pudding. Yum!

I have tried many sugar cookie recipes over the years in search of one worthy of actually writing down for my recipe box. This is it. There is no point in doing the extra work of rolling sugar cookies when you can just do this and they taste so good and look so good. I found a great recipe for shiny frosting that gets hard here on All Recipes and just decorated with that. I added lemon/orange flavor to the frosting and they were just flying off the plate! The first time I made this, because I frosted them, I dipped glass in water and pressed flat (no sugar on the outside)and it was fine. I always use Crisco for shortening and I recommend that strongly. Also used butter not margarine. These freeze extremely well - just pop them, frosting and all, in little zipper freezer bags and take out as needed.

I followed the recipe exactly, and they turned out pretty good.  They weren't very flavorful.  I had to add a bit more flour, and the dough was still very soft.  I would think you could never use thus recipe for rolled cookies.

Good cookies.. I didnt have the cream of tartar but they still turned out.  These are great for kids to help with because they make kind of a play-doe & it makes it really easy to flatten(with your hand) and use cookie cutters

This recipe produces one great tasting cookie, however it does remind me more of shortbread. The cookies are light, and are perfect for frosting. The batch that I just baked and frosted are sitting on Red, White, and Blue plates just waiting to be eaten during the 4th of July fireworks. I can hardly wait to dig in.

I made these cookies over the weekend and we all loved them!  I only flattened a few of the cookies before baking and I must say we liked the non-flattened ones better.  I doubled the recipe so I could share with friends.  My grandson and I decorated the finished cookies with powdered sugar icing, m&ms and sprinkles.  A big hit!

These were so very good!!!! A little sticky rolling them into balls, but I put the dough in the freezer as each batch was baking, then took it out when it was time to make a new batch, and it made it less sticky and easier to roll. I also didn't have shortening, so I used sticks of blue bonnet margarine instead and they came out very well. I topped them with red and green icing that I made as the kids are watching a Christmas show tonight. SUPER RECIPE!!

Love the crispy texture.  I used part vanilla extract, part almond extract.  Also used part whole wheat flour, part all-purpose and they were great.

This has become a family favorite. I reduced the flour to 2 cups. Instead of shaping then pressing down with glass with sugar, I used my smallest melon baller/ cookie scoop. There is no need to flatten they have a really nice look when cooked up. These are a 1 to 2 bite cookie reducing the crumb mess so many had problems with. I don't see the need to add more sugar or icing.  I make them once or twice a week. They are perfect with coffee or hot tea.

I make these quite a bit. The only thing different with the recipe I use is that I use one whole tsp of baking soda & one whole tsp of cream of tartar. Does it make a difference? I have no idea! Lol Good easy recipe. Thanks! :)

My son is not able to have gluten or dairy, so I GFDF-ed these. They turned out wonderfully! I used my own blend of all-purpose GF flour (with xanthan gum) and substituted Earth Balance for the butter. I keep butter Crisco on hand, so no sub needed there. Also, I didn’t press them as recommended in the reviews. This cookie is quick, super easy to make (always pluses in my book), and light and fluffy. Thanks for this recipe!

I just made these cookies.  It was so easy and quick.  I love their delicate flavor and light texture.  I made them by the recipe with no changes.  DELICIOUS.  Give them a try, you won't regret it.  You'd better make a double batch.  They'll go fast.

These are really good. I usually bake 3 or 4 new recipes each Christmas in search of my favorite sugar cookie. I may have finally found it. I used 1 cup of butter (no shortening) and one entire egg. These were a little sticky to work with & they baked a little flat, so I'll probably follow the recipe next time and see if they are easier to work with. Otherwise, great taste. You could easily do these without icing, and they would still be great. I topped mine with an icing made with powdered sugar, milk, almond extract and light corn syrup.

I LOVED THIS RECIPE!!!!!!!!! Totally perfect. I used only butter instead of butter and shortening. This cookie melts in your mouth and is a million times better than any store-bought cookie you will find. The cookies baked quite well and went perfectly with my homemade buttercream frosting. Made as an after dinner snack and baked in a bit less than thirteen minutes. AAAAAAAAA++++++++ Thanks for the great recipe ;) Will use again!!

Love this recipe! I made these cookies with my daycare kids for St. Patrick's Day. I wanted something not too sweet and this delivered.  I used additional butter to replace the shortening since I didn't have any.  I also rolled it up in parchment paper (I was out of wax paper)in about a 3 inch log and refrigerated it for an hour and a half.  Then I was able to slice it for the children to put on the baking sheets themselves.  I made thin slices for crispy cookies and thicker slices for a more chewy cookie.  Excellent both ways!  Since I didn't want it too sweet I didn't use any additional sugar but you could roll the entire log in sugar before refrigerating or sprinkle some on top of the slices before baking.  It would also be an excellent cookie to frost and decorate.

This is an amazing recipe! I baked these for a decorating party and everyone loved them. They are not to thick or soft, so they don't fall apart. Although they are more of a shortbread cookie, I will bake them again. I only baked them for 9 minutes, but I was using a convection oven. I also added 2 tsp. of lemon juice for a little bit of flavor. 
Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Kiddo asked for sugar cookies for Christmas and I chose these for the simplicity.  Kiddo gave them a 20 out of 10 stars, they were just what he wanted!  Great  cookie and very easy and fast to make.  Excellent flavor as well.  I like them because they are  not overly sweet like many cookies.

This cookie is awesome! Yes, the cream of tartar makes them somewhat a shortbread cookie, but there are a lot of 4 and 5 star sugar cookie recipes on here that don't call for it. This was one of the easiest cookie recipes I've made. We did not flatten them with a glass covered in sugar only because we decided to frost them using the sugar cookie frosting recipe from here too. Anyway, easy to make and tastes wonderful! Will make again.

I made with whole wheat flour and still turned out perfect.  My only concern was it did not make as many cookies as recipe stated :(

I've never been able to make sugar cookies without burning them, this recipe was easy and they turned out great! Everyone had seconds and my dad ate like 5.

I modified this recipe using 1 cup butter and no shortening. They were for A project at work and were airbrushed with food coloring and not frosted. I love how they stayed soft for days.

These are a good basic sugar cookie. They had a nice crunch to them but were not hard to bite or chew. I made three 'varieties': basic drop, drop with sprinkles & rolled in cinnamon & sugar. I like the cinnamon & sugar best :) They aren't my 'perfect' sugar cookie, but definitely worth making :)

I didn't have Crisco, so I used all butter.  I loved the cookie!  I used a medium Pampered Chef scoop.  The cookie keeps its shape well to the size it's pressed.

Great recipe! I didn't use the cream of tarter and used all butter since I didn't have the shortening or tarter. Turned out soft and delicous. WILL definitely be making these again. WE LOVED them. Thanks so much for sharing! :)

I was a little disappointed in this recipe as the name is somewhat misleading.  These cookies are more of a short bread bisquit.  They were also very salty.  I would make them again, but not as a sugar cookie and I would reduce the salt of use unsalted butter.

Very good, easy recipe. I didn't have Cream of Tater so I used 1/2 tsp. vinegar instead of Cream of Tater which worked fine. I put the balls of dough into cupcake liners and pressed them down in the liners. Made clean up easy!

Made recipe exactly except for adding an extra 1/2 teaspoon vanilla.  Make sure you smash the cookie with a glass before baking as the cookie doesn't expand much. I rolled the top of the dough ball in colored sugar the smashed it with a glass on the cookie sheet.Used a 1 1/2 inch cookie dough scooper and it make 24 three inch cookies. Quick and easy recipe!

These turned out pretty good and have a tasty flavor. I followed the recipe as written the only thing I changed was the time in the oven. I baked the first two batches for 9 min which seemed to be a little too long for the size of the cookies and the amount on the tray, so I reduced that to 7 min which I found to be just right.

I dipped a glass bottom in cinnamon and sugar and 
pushed into top of cookies.  Didn't flatten cookies -]
they were delicious.  Didn't have cream of tartar either.

I really like this receipe. I would recommend omit salt if you have salt in your butter or margarine. They were alittle salty. I increased the vanilla to double and added 3 tlbs of flower, to compensate for extra fluid. I reccomend this receipe.

Great cookie.  I was looking for an easy sugar cookie recipe for dipping in my pumpkin butter and this one caught my eye.  Even though I got the first batch a little dark (I'm always nervous about soggy centers) the cookies were as advertised, easy to mix, easy to ball (I rolled each cookie in course white sugar crystals), totally easy to flatten with a glass and delicious all by themselves.  Of course I taste-tested them and they stand up to the pumpkin butter and provide a satisfying crunch.  Thanks a bunch for the crunch, Whitail.

These were so simple, and turned out so delicious.  I used a small scoop to place them on the cookie sheet, and didn't bother to flatten them out before baking.  They turned out beautifully. I frosted some of them, but I prefer the plain ones just the way they are.  They have a nice buttery taste.  If I try to frost these again, I think I would try a cocoa flavored frosting so it wouldn't be as sweet as the shortening/confectioners sugar recipe I used.  I recommend this cookie recipe - very tasty.
