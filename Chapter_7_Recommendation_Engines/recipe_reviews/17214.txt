I used regular sourdough starter, along with whole wheat flour and honey.  This resulted in great tasting fluffy pancakes!

These pancakes are really good! They do have the sourdough taste, but not overpowering. I didn't use the herman starter, but another from this site that I had made. I think maybe next time I may try adding some vanill extract for a little more flavor, but overall a great recipe! The family loved them. Thanks for sharing!

These are really good. Good way to use starter if you are not planning on making bread. I used another starter not Herman's starter. Used just 1 TBSP of oil, 1/3 cup of sweetened applesauce, omitted sugar and added 1 tsp of vanilla extract. For the flour, used 1/2 cup of oat flour and 1/2 cup of wheat flour. Very good pancakes.

A good solid pancake.  There is absolutely no reason to ever purchase boxed pancake mix again.  Fluffed up nicely, tasted great.

Holy  these are good.  I have been searching for the perfect pancake recipe for forever and just happened to stumble upon this one by accident.  I was simply looking for a new way to use my sourdough starter other than make sourdough bread and decided to try these.  The texture is wonderful and the sourdough adds a nice subtle zip.

Used my Amish Friendship Bread starter for this recipe. The pancakes had a wonderfully light and fluffy consistency. The flavor was nice but next time I will try adding a teaspoon of vanilla as others recommended.

Light and fluffy with a mild sourdough flavor.  I made a double recipe the night before and let it sit for about 20 minutes before cooking.  Turned out great and the kids loved it.

A very pleasing pancake!  I used Sourdough Starter II starter from this site (made last night).  I look forward to trying this with a more mature starter - it could only get better!!

These were good, nice and fluffy. The only changes I made were that I used my regular starter, used 1/2 whole wheat flour, and added some pecans and walnuts because I was feeling a little nutty. So they turned out good and I had them with the "absolute best pancake syrup" from here.

These were a good way for me to use my starter. I hate throwing food away, even starter when you have to feed it and don't plan on baking.  I know the Herman's starter is sweeter than mine, so I just added a little extra sugar and some vanilla for extra flavor. Really good, easy, yummy. Thanks

My family loved these.  I cut the oil in half and that was a mistake.  The pancakes were dry and pasty.  Next time, I will add at least 2/3 of the quantity specified.

A new favorite recipe!  I used my own sourdough starter, and Substituted 1/2 of the flour for wheat flour.  I added a little extra sugar after reading some other reviews that suggested to.  So Good!  Next time I would like to substitute some of the oil with applesauce just to make it a little healthier.

Yummy!  I did add some vanilla extract like another reviewer suggested.  My husband and I loved these pancakes.  I had to stake my claim or he would have eaten them all.  Next time I plan to add something extra like chocolate chips or blueberries for variation.

Absolutely perfect! I doubled this recipe (as to make a large amount for a couple days worth) and I did not have one single problem. I made two substitutes, I used half whole wheat flour and melted butter instead of vegetable oil. These pancakes cooked up fluffy and were just.......AWESOME. I am so tickled that I had a sourdough starter that not only turned out, but made great pancakes. Win/win! NOTE: Two things--If you do use half or all whole wheat flour, make sure that you let the batter sit for a couple minutes as to soak up some of the liquid and puff up a bit. It makes for a better pancake. ALSO, I did not use the sourdough starter called for in this recipe. I had one already done, the Sourdough-Starter by Esther Nelson, which is also on this site. EDITED: Half of the double batch I made last night is gone this morning. We LOVED these pancakes.

This is THE BEST pancake I've ever had!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used the sourdough starter I already had.  I made my starter about two years ago from the concord grapes growing in my yard.  That was the only thing that I changed in this recipe.  Thanks for this DELICIOUS recipe!!! :o)

This is a keeper. These puffed up nice. I added a grated gala apple, and 1 tsp Cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla. Although I used 1 cup Sourdough Starter, without sugar. Amish Starter is the new Herman Starter. And I think Herman changed it's name LOL. Good Recipe that is for sure.

I used a regular sourdough starter and based on the comments of others, added 1/2 cup of bran to thicken up the mixture (and add some fibre).  A really nice tasting pancake!

I have super sour starter that makes amazing sourdough bread but using a whole cup of it made the pancakes wayyyy too tangy and off tasting.  However, the texture of these pancakes is SUPERIOR to all other homemade ones I've tried.  I'm going to try w/a friends starter and re-rate.

These turned out really well. I used my regular Sourdough Starter and just added about a fourth cup more sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla. (love vanilla) Definetly beats the pancake mix!

Amazing! I make as many as possible at once, because, even though they are really filling, the leftovers still taste about as good as the originals! I like to eat them warm with peanut butter, and my 16 month old son loves them too!!

These turned out wonderfully well.  I'm personally not a fan of pancakes, but my children love them.  I had 3 cups of Herman to use up, so I figured I'd make a giant batch.  After the first pancake was done, I tried it, just to sample the flavor.  i was impressed.  I won't be buying pancakes miz anymore!

Lovely flavor; nice chewiness, yet fluffy.  Added blueberries, flax seed, ground oats, wheat germ and extra milk.  I would definitely make extra sourdough starter to use specifically for this recipe! Thank you Saundra!

Great recipe. I used my own starter and added some vanilla. It was great. As my starter is pretty young, Im sure it will only get better with age!

These were good, used my Herman starter.. I got too much sourdough flavor for my taste. But was a good, fluffy pancake... probably would try again.

Wow! This recipe is amazing! I was skeptical of the idea of sourdough pancakes at first, but I absolutely love these! I only made one change - I used my own sourdough starter.

these were great. I used the last of my herman to make this. I decided to use all my herman because I didn't really like any of the things I was making with him but now I wish I had some herman left. these pancakes had a nice yeasty taste and weere light and fluffy.

These pancakes were delicious!  I added a teaspoon of vanilla for a little extra flavor.  My first couple burned because the heat was way too high.  I turned it down to med. and the rest were allright.

I used a basic starter that was only a couple weeks old, and these pancakes turned out very nice.  They were very cake-like and my husband loved them.  Next time we're going to use this recipe to make banana pancakes.

I have been on this site for years and tried many recipes, but never ever felt the need to leave a response and give out stars! This is THE BEST PANCAKE recipe EVER! i am new to sourdough,  i have always been a little intimidated by  it but yesterday i made a starter from a different site and i really wanted to try it out because it had already set up! I only changed one thing and that was to add 1tsp of vanilla extract. They seriously were light, fluffy, and melt in your mouth! I will never use store bought again! Also, for anyone that doesn't know, cook them with no butter or grease in the pan and on medium low. They will not burn then.

These were the best pancakes ever.  I find the vegetable oil to be a little heavy tasting though, so I tend to substitute with apple sauce.

Great basic sourdough pancake recipe!! I've altered it a few times: doubled, halved, used whole wheat flour - they always turned out.

I wanted to add a heads to my previous 5 star ratings remarks. Make sure your Herman or similar starter is not cold and just out of the refrigerator. My second batch took a turn for the worst because of this.  The batter acted differently and instead of an even spread of bubbles appearing as it cooked followed by the flip to reveal a golden brown cake--the bubbles in this case were sporadic and the cake burned quickly regardless of the lowered burner plate temperature.Enjoy these are worth the learning curve.

First thing I ever made with my "new" sourdough/herman starter!  Wonderful!  I must admit to substituting butter for oil in the recipe, but that was a personal flavor choice.  I will say to previous reviewers who thought it was too thin..how thick was your starter?  A thin starter will likely need extra flour, whereas mine, which is very thick allowed me to follow the recipe as written.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I have made these pancakes with two different sourdough starters. This was great with my Oregon Trail starter. That starter is pretty sour and this recipe was really tangy with it. I lost that starter and created my own. It’s a pretty young starter and is not as strong, flavorful as my other starter. This recipe was good with it, but not great. I am going to work on making this sourdough stronger so the next time I make it the flavor pops! This recipe was originally intended for the Herman starter which is a very sweet sourdough. I have found that this starter works well with most starters!

I used a different sourdough starter from this site. I  used white ww flour to get more fiber. Added some chocolate chips for some, blueberries for another and some I made plain. The best ever pancake I have ever done. So soft almost like it melts in my mouth. Ate the leftover later in the day and it was still soft and delicious.

I made these using my regular starter.  They were pretty good!  They might have turned out sweeter if I'd used the Herman starter.  Next time, I need to add some cinnamon and vanilla extract since I'm used to cinnamon in my pancakes.  As they were, these pancakes puffed up nicely!

I followed the recipe and the results were excellent!  My current sourdough is a whole wheat sourdough which added enough whole wheat to make the pancakes look rustic.  This recipe is perfect!!

My husband is still raving over these.  I followed the recipes and only made a few changes based on what I had on hand. I used buttermilk instead of regular milk, my starter from the frig,vanilla and blueberries.  I will definitely be making these everytime.

I tried this, not thrilled with the amount of sugar in it, but I wanted to try it with the starter. It was somewhat bland. I think adding vanilla might perk it up a bit.

Fabulous!  A few tweaks to make it healthier -- half regular/half while wheat flour, chunky applesauce rather than oil, Greek yogurt rather than milk.  Add cinnamon and nutmeg, plus some more finely-chopped apples.  Double the recipe, then freeze extra for easy, week-day breakfast.

Update 3-17-19:   I substituted half whole wheat flour for the all-purpose white flour ,  put in half a mashed banana ,  one teaspoon of salt . They came out great .  They could use a whole banana I think.  I used some unfed sourdough starter discard in my refrigerator. It's just the regular sourdough bread starter discard. These pancakes came out light and fluffy. I added 1/2 teaspoon of orange extract to the batter, I substituted Truvia cane sugar blend for the sugar,  and I mixed all the wet ingredients together and then added the dry ingredients to the wet.  Next time I would put in a whole teaspoon of orange extract and one teaspoon salt instead 1/2 teaspoon because the pancakes were a little bland.

Did not rise and no flavor. Had to doctor it to salvage. Added the following on top of what was called for in recipe: 1/8c of Splenda, a teaspoon of vanilla, 2 tsp baking powder, and 1/4c flour. THEN they rose and were palatable. My review is based on the original recipe. I won't make this again. I have a go-to pancake recipe, but I wanted to try using my sourdough starter. Perhaps I'll try sourdough pancakes again, but not with this recipe.

I give one star because it didn't come out spongy they were bread like sorry maybe the wet should be stored first and then mixed to the dry until wet and leave alone. Don't beat it to death.

great find! I certainly can use a new recipe other than bread to dispose of my sourdough starter, and these pancakes are light and fluffy into the bargain! my kids proclaimed it a keeper

These were delicious and I would give this recipe a 5 but I changed a couple things and I didn't use herman's sourdough starter. First I doubled the recipe, added half the amount of milk because we like thick batter and added some spice(vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg). I used a wild yeast starter. But I found them very good. It wasn't overwhelming with sourdough taste and they were nice and fluffy.

I am new to using sourdough. This tastes even better then anything I've had in a restaurant & I actually made it! This is a keeper!
