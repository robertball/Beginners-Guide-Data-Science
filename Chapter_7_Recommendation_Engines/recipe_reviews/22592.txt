I've made this recipe over a dozen times and I'd like to share a few things I've learned.  Temperature is critical anytime you work with sugar.  The final consistency is almost 100% dependant on the temperature.  At 245 you get caramel, at 310 you get toffee.  I would not recommend making this without a candy thermometer.  Use the thickest pot you can, to prevent scorching.  Stir ocassionally until 300 and then not at all until 310.  This reduces the time it takes to climb the last 10 degrees and reduces the chance of burning.  Remove from heat at precisely 310-do it fast and pour it fast, trust me on that.  I don't add the almonds, I like the skor bar quality of the candy without them, and I don't use the bottom layer of chocolate on the pan, I never get good adhesion, it falls off when you try to eat it.  I only put chocolate on the top.  When the candy hardens enough that your finger only makes a small dent in the top add the chips, give them a minute or 2 to melt and then spread with a knife or the back of a spoon.  My chocolate has always stuck when doing it this way.  If you need it ready fast put in the fridge or freezer, otherwise it can take a while for the chocolate to harden.  For breaking it into pieces I just slam mine against the counter and let it break into odd sized pieces.
This candy is always met with excitement when I bring it to a gathering.  I hope this helps anyone who wants to make this wonderfully addictive candy

December 19, 2012: Over the years of making this candy, I have simplified everything. No longer do I put chocolate on the bottom. I now use 3 cups of toasted nuts & this year I used a combo of cashews, almonds & pecans. In past years, I've used white chocolate & cashews, which has become a family favorite. This year, I used Lindt 90% Dark Chocolate Bars. After I poured the hot nut filled toffee out on a parchement paper lined cookie sheet, I laid the bars down on top & they melted like butter. Next I melted Lindt White Coconut Chocolate & flung it over the dark, melted chocolate. I used a tooth pick to score back & forth across the chocolate, which made a beautiful pattern. The less sweet dark chocolate pared well with the toffee, which is plenty sweet enough & this creation is yet another favorite of mine. The possibilities are endless! Enjoy & have fun being creative!

The first time I made this, I cooked the candy to 310 degrees.  In a second it went from smelling great to smelling burnt and separating.  The second time and third time I made it, I buttered the sides of the pan and did not stir it at all until it reached 300 degrees, rather than 310 degrees.  It was perfect and delicious both times.

Update to my previous review:  Use the nonstick foil in the bottom of the pan you are using for the chocolate.  I find after spreading the warm chocolate put in the fridge to cool and harden while cooking the toffee.  I have much better results with the non stick foil vs the wax paper which tends to leave residue.  And an A++ to the pizza cutter idea!  Awesome recipe. My 2nd year for xmas gifting and my friends can't get enough of it.  I find that using a candy thermometer that attaches to the side of the pan is helpful in candy making.  Also, I've cut recipe in 1/2 by using 1 1/3 packed cups of Brown sugar and halving everything else. I've also found putting it into the fridge for 3 hours is really helpful.  Plus use very good chocolate to make it special!

My first attempt at this recipe flopped -I had grainy toffee which had the consistency of fudge - tasted good but it just wasn't toffee.  I tried again and Voila!  I was able to make wonderful toffee.  Here are my tips: most importantly TEST your candy thermometer!  If you get 212 degrees in boiling water then you know it's accurate (mine was 10 degrees off!)  Also, the tip shouldn't be touching the bottom of the pan but somewhere in the middle of the syrup.  I used a Silpat silicone baking mat instead of greasing the pan and it worked wonderfully.  No sticking at all.  I didn't stir as much the 2nd time since someone said that allows the candy to heat up very quickly at the end and scorch.  I also used a wire whisk instead of a wooden spoon that I used the first time.  Lastly, I made one batch without the bottom chocolate layer and almonds only on top of the top chocolate layer and broke the toffee up like brittle â€“ a little less expensive and still tastes good!  Another batch I scored with a knife and broke up into squares when it cooled - also worked great.  I used Ghiradelli chips and they melted beautifully, but when I used Hershey chips they did not so I'd recommend using a good quality chocolate if you can.  I'm proudly going to take my re-worked batches to a cookie exchange today and can't wait to hear what everyone thinks!  Oh, and another reviewer explained how to make a half batch and it worked perfectly too! (use 1 1/3 c packed brown sugar and halve the other ingr

Thank you so much Janis!  I carefully read your tips and everything went smoothly.  I thought "that's it?!?" at the end of it all.  Was it ever easy, and quick!  I roasted roughly chopped almonds in a pot on a medium to low heat, I found this brought out the flavor of the almonds and enhanced the Almond Roca. My only question is, how do you score the Almond Roca so that the pieces are uniform and appear attractive when presenting them as gifts?

Hi Mountain Ash...I'm the one who submitted this recipe.  Yes, you can score the candy while it's still hot so that you can break it apart into even pieces.  Use parchement paper so you can pull it out of the pan after it's completely cooled.  You have to work fast and cut through it while it's still good and hot...but it can be done.  I've done this myself, but I've gotten lazy and just prefer to break it apart.  I saw a chopping utensil a few days ago that would work well for scoring the candy.  It cuts in a rocking motion, side to side.  I found it at Harris-Gottschalks.  Hope this helps you out.  Good luck.

I wish mine had turned out better. It seems like too much butter, and I used dark brown sugar, a mistake. Wish the recipe has specified light brown sugar, or white. It is hardening up now and tastes OK, but not nearly as good as my previous recipe from my old Better Homes and Gardens cookbook.

This candy is so wonderful.  Everyone begs for it and wants the recipe.  Nobody can believe how simple it is with just 4 ingredients. I make 2 batches at Christmas and can't keep it around.  For those of you who have had trouble, you must use a candy thermometer and make sure it is a good one. Take it off the range immediately at 310 or it will taste burnt. I put all the almonds in the toffee mixture (none on top - just my personal preferance) right when I take it off the heat, stir quickly and pour over the milk chocolate.  Never failed!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This recipe is PERFECTLY FANTASTIC!!  I have been using this website for years making recipes and have never felt the desire to comment.  Thanks so much for this one, it is truly a pleasure to make....and then eating it-delicious!  I had all my metal cookie sheets dirty so I used my stoneware, needless to say I had to line it.  That was the only change made only because I wasn't properly prepared.  The melting of the chocolate in the oven is genius.  One less bowl to wash and every last drop of the chocolate is in the candy.  I have been baking since I was a little girl and this recipe inspired me once again to keep on baking.  Thank-you!

Wow, Janis!  What a great recipe!  Absolutely delicious, and addictive.  Coupled with the recipe for Saltine Toffee Cookies from AllRecipes, it made very decadent Christmas gifts.  My sugar thermometer went kaput, and I had to guesstimate temperature, and I think I overcooked the mixture because it didn't end up crisp as I expected it to.  No matter - it was still superb.  One idea which would make it even more to my taste would be to roast the almonds first.  I reckon the smokiness of the roasted almonds would add complexity to this, as well as cut some of the sweetness.  Thanks for this, it's become an instant classic at my place.

This received rave reviews from everyone who tried it. It wasn't easy though, my candy thermometer isn't very good, so I tested using cold water. I got trigger happy with my first batch and removed it too soon, so it never hardened and ended up like really sweet fudge. Second try I forced myself to let it go a bit longer and it turned out perfectly. I, like others, didn't put a layer of chocolate on the bottom, and instead of milk chocolate, I broke up pieces of Hershey's Special Dark chocolate bars (2).

The toffee was great.  The only problem I had was with the chocolate.   It stuck to the pan better than the toffee and was a bit soft.  Tasted great though.*** I made this a second time, with the following changes: did not add almonds to toffee, poured it onto foil (should have used wax paper), scored toffee w/pizza slicer when still hot, broke up the toffee and then dipped in in chocolate and then rolled it in food processed nuts.  It's a lot less messy. Tastes great.  Be careful to not over process the nuts, I thought sliced unblanched almonds looked the best.

I think I stirred too much because I couldn't get my toffee up to 310. I stopped at 280 to prevent scorching and it is still really tasty!

I think the bottom layer of chocolate is a little redundant (I know, "crazy woman"!) but it didn't stick to the candy very well and mostly stayed in the bottom of the pan.  Other than that, this recipe was sooo good.  Oh, I toasted the almonds and that made it perfect.

Love this candy recipe. Easy for new cooks too, and great Christmas treats. I learned from my mother, who learned from her mother how to make candy. They were experts. Here's what I know: Always use a wooden spoon, why? Metal spoons get hot and add extra heat that can distort the why the candy cooks. Only stir once and awhile and DO NOT scrape the upper sides of the pan. Sugar sticks to the upper sides of the pan and actually crystalizes and burns (you don't see this process taking place and that's okay as long as you don't scrape it down into your candy). So if you accidentally scrape the upper sides, you get that crystalized taste and burned too. Yes, I agree with RainyDayGirl reviewer; follow her advice about stirring. Mom used to say, once it's burned toss it, there's no way to fix it. Have fun.

Make sure you grease your cookie sheet well.  After the candy was set, I had to use a metal spatula to remove it from the cookie sheet - it came off well.  I keep it in the refrigerator and by the second day it was perfect.  I did not use the last bit of almonds at the end of the recipe either.  You do need to let it sit on the stove with a mild boil for a bit before the 'syrup' finally beads up in the cold water.  Love this candy - tastes like I spent a lot of money on it!!

My husband loves this, I scored it with a pizza cutter. Also added almonds, just before pouring in pan that I lightly buttered.Then I put one bag of chips on top of hot toffee, let set for about 2 minutes or until spreadable.Top with almonds and voila.

This has to be, by far one of the best (and easiest) toffee recipies.

Every Christmas season my Mom used to buy me this super expensive toffee from a local boutique, complete with a french linen bow and it melted in your mouth (the toffee not the bow!). I've found that making this recipe and following the cooking directions produced similar, if not better tasting toffee and less expensive! 

After letting my Mother in law try some, she told me I should open up a sweet shop! The only part I did differently for this recipie was to crush the almonds to very small bits, which ended up needing more almonds to coincide with the measurements you've provided. Thank you for this recipe and my family thanks you too!

This candy is wonderful, and not at all hard to make if you have any experience with candy making.  Everyone I shared it with raved over it - it tastes like Skor candy bar except that it doesn't break your teeth to bite into it!  I found that cutting the candy into squares while it was warm worked well.  Then I could easily break it along the perforations when it was completely cool and still have nice, intact little squares.

I was so disappointed that the toffee burned as soon as it reached 300degrees. The consistency was perfect but it had a burnt aftertaste. I would attempt this recipe again but I would pull it off the heat before it reaches 300. I am open to any suggestions.

Very good! I toast the nuts and also have used toasted coconut. Many ways to give this buttercrunch a twist.Use White choc. or other nuts  toasted sesame seeds.Try grinding nuts to just about a powder and dust the top layer of choc. with it. Let your mind and taste buds wander. Have fun!

This was my family's favorite new Christmas candy this year.  I would recommend using a candy thermometer, as the right heat is critical for  cohesiveness to the other ingredient layers.  Very simple prep.  Family gobbled it up and wanted more!

A little friendly advice.  Instead of worrying about the chocolate on the bottom hold off on that.  Just grease your pan real good.  Follow directions to make candy.   btw you can also make this with white sugar as well.   Cook to the the point it's toffee.  Now here come the slight changes... 1. pour candy into greased pan.  Cover with chocolates  ( Try Ghirardelli chips )  spread them as they melt.  Take chopped ( processor is best ) nuts almost to the point of powder and spinkle on melting chocolate.  Cover with tin foil.  Sit on counter or put in fridge.  When it's hard take tin foil off. Turn pan upside down and remove the entire slab of yummy candy.  Place candy back in pan still all in one piece with the side with no chocolate now on top.  Melt additional chocolate chips in microwave.  Pour on top of candy smooth out add the chopped / powdered almonds and cover back up and put back in fridge.  I promise your chocolate will not come off on either side doing it this way.   You know the routine after that. Wait for it to get hard and then break that yummy all up in bite size servings.  Note:  If you ever enjoyed the cans of Camp Fire Girls Almond Roca this is almost identical with the powdered almonds.

Made this for Christmas gifts.  Brought some to work and it was a big hit.  As some of the other reviews suggested, I'll omit the chocolate on the bottom of the pan the next time I make it.  It just didn't stick to the candy and ended up staying in the pan.

This is wonderful, I make a big pan for my family every year. Note about the temperature ~ I always stop at 300 degrees. It might just be my candy thermometer though. This is also a great Valentine's Day treat!

Very nice! Easy, quick and delicious. Made a batch for my husband to take to work for the guys. It was perfect. Kids are excited that this is a new Christmas Candy that they can look forward to. I'm not a seasoned candy maker so I followed the suggestions of a previous reviewer and buttered the sides of my sauce pan so that I could leave it untouched until it reached 300 degrees. I had success the first go. Thanks Janis.

These didn't turn out at all for me. I'm guessing my candy thermometer is off. I'm sticking with an easier recipe that I use that doesn't require a candy thermometer ...  sorry!

Simple and easy to make. Candy tasted good but was not crunchy enough for me. It was too soft and not like the real almond roca. I followed the instructions exactly and even used some of the tips from other reviewers. Ane suggestions on how to make it "buttercrunch"?

Followed direction to a tee and it was a flop. First chips would not melt, then the end resault was too soft. Not sure what went wrong. It did not harden at all.Any suggestions out there?

Although I finished the candy at 10:30pm, the top layer of choc. was still gooey at 1:50am.  The brown sugar and butter smelled like it was burning while I tried to get it to 300deg.,  But except for the gooey choc., it is a good tasting candy.  My hubby says it is slightly bitter but good.  I'll try it again another day.

Wow!  This is the recipe I've been looking for!  The brown sugar makes it SO YUMMY.  I'll be making this again for Christmas gifts.  I've already received rave-reviews and it is just delicious.  Thank you, Janis.  This one is certainly a winner and a keeper.

I'm not very experienced at making candy so I was nervous going into this, but it was super easy!  So simple, I can't believe how few ingredients makes something so good!  Tastes every bit as good if not better than store bought almond roca.  I used half real butter and half smart balance butter and it turned out beautifully. I also used a bit more whole almonds and will probably use even more almonds next time.

Based on my experience, white sugar makes a good crunchy caramel than brown sugar. So I used white sugar and surely the candy was really crunchy. But next time i would reduce the caramel to half as I think the amount as is is too much, it made the candy too sweet.

Recipe worked great and was delicious!  My only source of confusion is that it doesn't specify if the butter should be salted or unsalted.  I had unsalted, so used that and added a little salt.  Will try with salted next time, as I think salt would add a good balance to the sweetness of this recipe.  I skipped the chocolate on the bottom as the recipe describes, adding chocolate chips to the top to melt.  When cooled, I flipped the entire piece over and poured melted chocolate chips on the other side.  This worked well and seemed to alleviate the problems some had of the chocolate not sticking to the bottom.  Will definitely be making this again!

This was good and easy. I did not put the layer of chocolate down first, only on top and not quite a full bag. I think a full bag of chips on top would have been too much. The toffee was good, but had a bit of a burnt taste that Skor does not have (I used a thermometer, and followed cooking directions exactly).  This did not spread very thin when poured out of the pot, so I am glad I scored before it set completely. Otherwise I might need a hammer to break into pieces.
