Good carmel apple, but really didn't notice that much of the bourbon.  Just made the carmel more "smokey" as opposed to having a distinct flavor of it's own.

A light carmel recipe if you don't want something overly sweet and intense. Tasty.

I'm more concerned for the sugar/glucose amounts then the 2 tablespoons of booze. Do the division. But they are good!!!
