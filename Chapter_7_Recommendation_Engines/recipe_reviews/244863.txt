Oh my! What's not to like about this recipe. Move over bell peppers, there's a new pepper in town. I used Knorr's Fiesta Sides Mexican Rice & Pasta blend with ground turkey along with a blend of cheddar/jack cheese.

Forgot to add instead of Spanish rice both times I made just plain white rice but added a packet of sazon to the water while cooking.

I did a number of shortcuts with wonderful results.  I am sure that as written this would be a tasty recipe, but the way mine turned out with the changes it was delicious.  I made this with only the ingredients I had on hand:  Used 1/2 mild sausage, 1/2 hamburger, McCormick original Taco Seasoning (to taste), 1 Pkg. Knorr Ready to Heat Spanish Style Rice, V8 Healthy Blend Vegetable Juice (not watered down) and Sargento Italian Aged Cheese Blend.  Prepared the peppers as stated, mixed the cooked hamburger and sausage with microwaved rice and taco seasoning,  stuffed the peppers, poured some V8 juice over all and topped with the cheese blend.  Baked as directed.  A real winner!  We've never tasted poblano peppers before and this recipe left a good taste in our mouths!!!

I made it using leftover mexican rice. I also used ground turkey instead of beef and a mix of colby/jack/cheddar for the cheese topping.  Otherwise followed the recipe, but doubled it.  We liked it and I would make it again when I have this leftover rice or with a boxed mix.

Fantastic! One of the best things I've made in quite a while! Used Zataran's Spanish Rice Mix and followed the box instructions exactly. Used a very lean beef so didn't need to drain it, and added a diced onion while browning. Kept to the recipe other than adding some Mexican oregano.  As suggested I used enchilada sauce and that really made this dish IMHO. 1 can worked fine. Make sure to buy an enchilada sauce where peppers/chilies are the first ingredient, NOT tomatoes. That makes all the difference in the world.  Had quite a bit of filling left over, but it will be great for any taco/burrito meal. Really loved this dish.

I highly recommend this recipe, with a few changes. 
Using my garden grown poblano peppers and green and red peppers (to appeal to family members who prefer less spicy-ness) and everyone raved about it, even my vegetarian eater (I also made a meat-free serving)! 
My changes to the recipe:
Substituted steamed brown rice for the packaged Spanish-Style Rice Mix.
Added 3/4 Cup diced yellow onion, sauteed in a little extra virgin olive oil, to the cooked ground beef.
I substituted organic canned tomato sauce for the condensed tomato soup and skipped the water.
Finally, I used cotija cheese instead of the mozzarella, for a more Mexican Food feel, and it paired perfectly with the meat and spices.

Very good! I only used two peppers, so scaled it accordingly. I used a few items that I had on hand: a small portion of thawed hamburg from the freezer and homemade rice and beans. For the sauce, I made a half version of the Paleo Enchilada Sauce from this site (a lot leftover for possible cheese enchiladas?). After the peppers were stuffed, I put a little of the sauce on top and then shredded jack and cheddar cheese. Cooking times were spot-on. A little more sauce to top, sour cream on the side and it was a great supper! Thanks for the recipe that I'll surely make again.

This is my second time making this and it gets better each time!  I always have to use a substitute for something, (like brown rice for Spanish or marinara sauce for tomato soup), and it still tastes delicious!

This was a great take on stuffed peppers that my entire family enjoyed. I made a few with regular bell peppers as I worried the poblano peppers might pack a little more heat than several family members enjoy. In fact, most of the kick came from the cayenne pepper, so if you like a little less spice, I would recommend that you cut back a bit on the cayenne and/or make with green bell peppers. My rice was Rice-a-Roni Spanish Rice. It called for a can of tomatoes. I used fire-roasted, which I think added a lot of flavor. I used ground turkey breast and enchilada sauce (as suggested by the reviewer). I used cheddar cheese to top after baking for 20 minutes; then I baked for 15 minutes longer.  Delicious and easy to prepare!

2-29-2020 ~This was truly a surprise hit, for BOTH Hubs and me, far exceeding any ho-hum expectations I had for it going in.  Truth be told, I was even concerned I might have to come up with a Plan B for Hubs, who can be picky.  I used a number of shortcuts that I was uncertain about, but when I make this again I’ll try to make sure I do the exact same thing.  First, I scaled this to two servings for us.  And then the accommodating short cuts begin.  Believe it or not, I had leftover Sloppy Joes in the freezer that worked perfectly for this!  To 11 oz. of this meat mixture I added 2 tsp. of taco seasoning and added (gasp!) leftover Chinese take-out rice I also had in the freezer, enough to make a good ratio of meat to rice.  As the submitter suggested, I used mild enchilada sauce instead of canned tomato soup.  As she also suggested, rather than mozzarella I used a cheddar/jack blend. Wow, what a dish!  The peppers were nice and tender, the amount of taco seasoning I added to the meat/rice was spot on, and the enchilada sauce and cheddar/jack cheese worked to bring this all together into something surprisingly wonderful.  I intended to put some chopped cilantro over mine and forgot, but this was so good I didn’t even miss it.  Top these with a dollop of sour cream and serve with some refried beans and you’ll have a mouth-watering Mexican meal.  I can’t wait to make it again, especially since I’m encouraged to do so because of Hubs’ unexpected positive response.

For the one who couldn't see where the butter was used: You boil the butter & water together for the rice. :)

Made it using instant rice. Great recipe even better for left overs. Wonder how they would freeze Also the ingredients list calls for 2 tbsp. of butter but I didn't see where it was used in the directions.

Delicious! There was a lot of mixture left over, so it sort of turned into a casserole. But still fantastic!
