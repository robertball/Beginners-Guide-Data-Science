I wish I could give this recipe 3.5 stars. This recipe had a lot of potential, and as a base it was good. The texture was not right to eat as a soup, with nothing but shredded meat and broth, so I served it over noodles. In the future, I would recommend adding some veggies and additional seasonings - onions and garlic would be a must, I would also suggest either mushrooms, whole tomatoes, maybe even zucchini, or carrots. It definitely needed something more than what it had. I loved the cooking time, and the directions though - so I will experiment with this in the future.
