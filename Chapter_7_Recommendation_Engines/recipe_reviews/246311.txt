These wings are super juicy and tender. It was great to have  version of wings that aren't too spicy. My kids and husband gobbled these up fast.

I think I put too much  mayo in the marinade:(. It was tasty but Iâ€™ll try again with less mayo and less cider vinegar:)

This is the best chicken wing sauce I've ever used.  Just the right amount of bite and they were very juicy!  I made them on the grill and even my brother who doesn't like chicken wings raved about them.  Next time, I'm going to try it on bone in chicken breasts and legs on the grill.  Delicious!
