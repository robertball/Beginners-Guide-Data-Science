I have made this twice now - I find it best if you only use one layer of tortilla chips on top of the 1st layer, then cheese, then rest of sauce topping with cheese, only making 2 layers rather than 3. The first time I used all of the chips and it was very dry. On top layer of cheese also added some chopped olives.

Like others I took advice from those listed here and added my own variety.
1. Bought 1 packet of taco seasoning. Added 1/2 the seasoning to the beef, onion, garlic as it browned.
2. Added the other 1/2 of the seasoning to the sour cream (aprx. 10oz).
3. Strained the 1 can of black beans, 1 can of corn.
4. In big bowl mixed beef, sour cream, beans, corn, 1 c. of salsa.
5. I only did two layers (beef-->chips-->taco cheese-->beef-->chips-->taco cheese). Topped with black olives, green onions.

Served Corn cake on the side.  Both can be in the oven at the same time & temp :)

My family loved this dish! Of course, it was rich (beef, cheese, sour cream), so we made some veggie smoothies as an "appetizer". My youngest daughter (7yo) liked the variety of the cheezy layer on top. I used about 2/3 to 3/4 of the chili powder and mild salsa, and her sensitive palate was fine spice-wise. I replaced 16oz of canned corn with a 16oz bag of frozen corn, which made the corn sweeter and more distinct. Like others, I also used sliced black olives on top instead of chopped tomatoes. We'll be doing this one again!

This was a great recipe.  I was expecting just the normal "taco casserole", but it was very good.  It had a good texture to it.  All the ingredients melded together very well.  I did leave out one can of black beans and used only one 15 oz. can of corn.  I also just eyeballed the salsa and used enough to moisturize everything (probably about 1 cup).  I will make this again!

We loved it!  My husband and I aren't big fans of black beans so I left those out.  And I only used 8oz of sour cream, but it turned out great!  It will definitely stay up front in my recipe book!

Very Tasty!  I followed the advice of some previous reviewers and made some changes of my own.  To the meat, I didn't add the garlic or the chili powder.  But I did use a packet of taco seasoning.  Then when adding the meat and other ingred. to the bowl, I first added another packet of the taco seasoning to the sour cream.  Then I placed half of this mixture in the dish, used only one layer of the chips and cheese and then topped it with the remaining meat mixture and cheese.  It was very good!  I think the taco seasoning helped it not be so bland.  Will make again!

This is the very first recipe I tried from allrecipes, and it has become one of our favorites.  Since it is just my husband and me, I halve the recipe.  I halve all the ingredients except for the cheese and chips which I don't measure, I just crush/sprinkle what I need as I go. I omit the tomato, and it fills out a 8x8 casserole dish perfectly. Then I bake according to the recipe.

Delicious! I used only one can of black beans and 1 and a half cans of the corn. I added hot taco seasoning to the beef mixture, to which I also added one chopped green bell pepper. I used much less than five cups of crushed tortilla chips. I added chopped, fresh cilantro to the meat mixture, after cooking. Instead of just cheddar, I used a taco cheese mixture for the cheese layers. Instead of adding chopped fresh tomatoes on top of the casserole, I used canned, diced tomato with green chiles. I forgot to add the green onions to the top, but I didn't miss them with all of my modifications. This is really good!

A group of us from work volunteer for the Ronald McDonald House and decided to make this for dinner on our night.  We made 3 casseroles for the entire house and almost ran out!  Kids and adults alike loved this dish!  So simple to make!!

Good weeknight meal if you use red. fat sour cream and no-salt-added canned goods. Next time I'll add the tomatoes and green onions as a colorful topping AFTER baking so the onions don't get crunchy. Maybe some sliced black olives would look pretty too? Only used 1 can corn like some others.

I thought this recipe was delicious.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it was a little dry.  I think it would be more moist with less tortilla chips so I will use cut back on the chips the next time I make this casserole.  The flavor is wonderful and I like the combination of black beans and corn.  Don't be afraid to use 1 tablespoon or more of chili powder.  It really does add to the flavor.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is so simple to make, and it also tastes great too! The first time I made this, I only used one can each of black beans and corn as my kids can be picky, and used plain yogurt in place of sour cream... it turned out great.  I have also used a can of Rotelle (tomatoes and chiles) in place of the salsa with good results.  This recipe makes alot, so the 2nd time I split it into two pans, and froze one for later.  I like to serve this with sour cream and extra salsa on the side.  Its definitely a keeper at our house.  Thanks!

This is okay.  It is a bit dry, but that's easily adddressed with more sour cream with the casserole or maybe more salsa.  The flavor is kind of blah--definitely needs more seasonings, and I'm not sure I'm thrilled with the black beans and corn.  I personally think it needs some refried beans either in addition or as a sub to the black beans.  I used lime flavored tortilla chips, and it masked the flavor (mostly) of the lime (I think that's a good thing--not thrilled with the lime tortilla chips), so don't be afraid to experiment with the chip type.  It's just so so for us, though--needs some tweaks for us to be wowed.  Thanks for the recipe!  **Update:  tried this again with a lot less tortilla chips, more sour cream, and refried beans instead of corn.  I also used canned diced tomatoes.  I added taco seasoning and a lot of garlic to the ground beef to spice it up, then added some queso dip to the mixture since I didn't have much cheese for the casserole itself.  Much much better--very moist, almost a dip consistency, and hearty.  We really enjoyed it this way!  Thanks again for the recipe!

I enjoyed this VERY much. Although I did make altercations (b/c i didnt have everything needed).
I cooked the meat in taco seasoning w/o the onion and garlic....I put the salsa on top instead of mixed w/ the beef and sourcream concoction. I layered it like you sai except added olives and jalapinos to the final layer before the cheese and tomatos/clilis and salsa. I just love the way salsa bakes on top of a dish.
Thanks for the ideas!!!!

I tried the recipe with chicken and it turned out all right.  Way to many black beans.  I also used a can of stewed tomatoes and less salsa!  If I try it again I will probably tweak the ingredients a bit!

I think the amount of sour cream is extreme.  We were disappointed in the final dish.  It, also, takes more than 20 minutes to prepare

All six of us loved this casserole - even the daughter who hates Mexican food! I used "medium" salsa and it was very spicy. We ate it with extra sour cream and salsa, and we loved it!

We love spicy mexican food but not mushy corn tortillas like in enchiladas, so I should have known I wouldn't care for this. I think if the crumbled tortilla chips had all been on top of the bean mixture instead of thoughout the casserole I may have liked it. One family member did like it however.

This was really good. I didn't use beans or sour cream, since I didn't have either in my kitchen. I will probably use beans next time, but I don't like sour cream, and I don't think it necessarily needs it. I also added a taco seasoning packet, which made the dish delightfully spicy!

4th time making this.  It is a staple now.  Get a LARGE tomato.  Those tangy fresh bits really liven up the whole dish.  I make the recipe just as it says, the only difference is that I use one large can of corn and 2 different types of beans, and I try my hardest to keep it that way, because it's just so perfect the way it is.  The first time, I followed advice saying that it was too dry, so I didn't use enough tortilla chips, but if you follow the recipe, it is not too dry.  It is just right.  I use HOT Pace Picante sauce instead of "fresh salsa" so maybe that makes it wet enough for the chips.
*to get the flavor of the toasted corn, make sure you at least get yellow corn chips, not white like Tostitos.  I use a brand that my frugal husband got when I sent him to the store called "Calidad" and the flavor is going towards Fritos, but not QUITE as strong.  Maybe use half Fritos, half Tostitos if you don't have Calidad.
MUST TRY!
** I made this for dinner the other night and shared with my coworker, and now I'm taking it to a Pot Luck at work tonight.  So I went photo crazy while I was making it.  It's not THAT good, to where I would obsess with it, but it IS a hit with the dudes, and I work in an Air Force maintenance shop... they make me think it's amazing.

This was pretty good. I made a few changeds because either personal taste or lack of ingredients. I added a can of green chilis, because we like it pretty hot. I only had half of the sour cream, and no fresh tomatoes, so I used canned. Came out pretty good, did have to add more hot sauce and salsa because it was a little dry. My husband said it was more like a nacho topper than anything.

It was ok. It took a long time to make, the portion was huge, it was messy, and a waste of chips. The majority of it is still in my fridge.

The flavor of this dish is really good but it dried out fast.  I would make this again but I would skip the crushed tortilla chips.  People are going to dip the chips in this dish, I don't think you need double chips. Leftovers were good in a burrito :)

Good stuff!  The only problem I ran across was that I forgot to add the second can of beans into the meat mixture.  I didn't realize until I was working on the last layer.  I just mixed in a whole can with what little meat mixture I still had and spooned it on top.  No one was the wiser and it tasted great!

This was pretty boring. Unfortunately, I didn't have any taco seasoning, so instead I added more garlic and chili powder, and also some ground cumin. This improved it a little but it was still pretty blah. I wouldn't make this again. Thanks anyway.

This was surprisingly yummy, not the most appetizing looking though!!  It even warmed up well for leftovers.  Might be good to round out this dish with a green salad.

I should have read the reviews before making this.  It wasn't bad but just very bland.  Not spicy at all even though I used Rotel tomatoes in place of the salsa.  Probably won't make again.

This was fantastic!  My entire family loved it including my 16 month old.  I used about half the salsa because I was using my own (very hot)salsa.  Then a dollop of sour cream for each serving and extra salsa if desired.  Yum Yum!  We will make this again and again I'm sure.

I used half the salsa and substituted stewed tomatoes as i wanted to reduce spiciness so my 3 yr old would enjoy it as well.  In order to avoid the dryness some others complained of, i left out the sour cream and added a dollop at the end on each plate.  This was a fantastic meal!!!!

made this for dinner last night and it was pretty tasty! i took the advice of other reviews and omitted the chili powder and used half a package of taco seasoning while cooking the meat and mixed the other half with the sour cream, only used 1 can of black beans and corn, only did about 2 cups of chips, and only did 2 layers. it turned out pretty good, will be using the leftovers to make burritos!!

Easy and filling. We like ours rolled up in whole wheat soft tortillas. Per other suggestions, while browning the meat with the garlic and onion, I added a few dashes of taco seasoning. I used only 1 can of reduced sodium black beans, and maybe about 10oz of frozen corn, only 8oz sour cream (all I had of those). I mixed in some more dashes of taco seasoning in the whole mix. Layered 1/2 mixture, chips (just enough to cover layer), about 1 cup cheese, other 1/2 mixture, then another cup cheese. Turned out great!

Not bad.  Hearty weeknight, quick-fix meal.  Not a "showy" dish at all.  Casserole fare "get it on the table and be done with it" meal.  Hubby really liked it.  Ingredients were handy.  Will probably make again in a pinch.

I added taco seasoning and used canned tomatoes when I cooked this. I was very surprised at how yummy it was! If it's too dry, try not draining all of your canned goods. I'm cooking this again tonight.

I added our own taco spice mixture as recommended, exchanged red beans for black since we don't like them and this made a huge casserole. Although the flavor was good it was very dry. We are going to use cream corn next time.

I made this recipe for a family at my church who had just had a new baby, and it made such a huge batch that I made a smaller pan of it for my husband and me also.  Everyone loved it!  It was easy and used ingredients I had on hand.  My husband isn't a huge bean fan, but he still ate this up and was greedy for more!

Very good.  I had some taco meat that in the freezer, mixed in the corn and beans, some leftover sour cream and a random amount of salsa; and layered as described.  Rave reviews from the pool party.  So easy I'll do again and again.

This was awesome. I made it in a rush one night after work, and my hubby and a few of his friends devoured it. It makes the family rotation.

This was so easy to make and very yummy!  I forgot the chilli powder, but it was good without it.  I also added extra cheese.  It made more than I expected, so I put half in the freezer for another meal.  I will be adding this meal to our "rotation" of favorites.

My husband and I thought this was a great meal. I tweaked it to our liking. I used one can of black beans that I rinsed first and used frozen corn instead of canned. I omitted the sour cream and salsa. I added fresh diced tomatoes and seasoned with low sodium McCormicks Taco Seasoning packet to the cooked meat mixture and cooked everything together for a few minutes. Then, I put it all in a baking dish then lightly crushed unsalted tortilla chips and topped with shredded cheese. I baked for only five minutes to melt the cheese. It came out really tasting really delicious to us. We don't like a lot of salt on our foods.

I gave this 4 stars because I changed some things.  I used only 1 can of beans and corn and cooked the meat with taco seasoning. I used nacho cheese chips instead of plain tortilla chips.  It was very good and everyone seemed to like it. I will make this again.

Super easy to prepare!  Great dish to make on a busy day, all ingredients found on hand.  Will add a little more spice next time, cause some like it hot.

My Family enjoyed this meal!  I did take the 'advice' of other reviewers and
used 1 can each of the beans and corn.
Also, I used 1 package of Taco Seasoning to give it more flavor.
Read the other reviews and adjust this recipe to your taste!

Excellent base recipe, which is why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Things I changed, I added about 5 heaping spoonfuls of chili powder and some fiesta party mix from Tastefully Simple to the cooking meat. I also added 2 jallapenos to the cooking meat. I used refried beans instead of black beans because I didn't have any in the house. And, I also added extra chili powder and hot sauce to the mix before spreading into the 9 x 13 pan. It was perfectly spiced for me but my husband was adding more hot sauce! Would be great as a dip for chips too, but a lot of work for just dip.

I varied this recipe a little and used black refried beans instead of beef and then left out the sour cream, used a can of diced tomatoes mixed with garlic and herbs, a green pepper and light kidney beans (not sure of the amounts just estimated)instead of plain black beans. It turned out pretty good, would make it again without the chips and serve them on the side more as a dip dish. really colorful!

Pretty tasty casserole.  I substituted 1/2 the cheddar cheese with jalapeno cheese and my family thought it was plenty spicy.

This was fantastic.  We cut the sour cream in half and added a packet of taco seasoning.  At the advice of another reviewer, we only made two layers.   We served it with a little sour cream on the side...it was perfect, not dry at all.  Next time we may try tortillas instead of crushed chips.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I used another reviewers suggestion of adding a dollop of sour cream to the finished dish rather than before baking. This worked well as I didn't find it dry like some of the other reviewers. Didn't add the black beans as I couldn't find them in the supermarket. I added a packet of taco seasoning as I wasn't sure if the salsa & chili would add enough flavour. This was an ok dish, easy & tasty but not brilliant.
