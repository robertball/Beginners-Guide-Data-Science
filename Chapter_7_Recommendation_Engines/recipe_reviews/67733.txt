This recipe is totally AMAZING.  I made it for a girls night out and had to make it twice because the first batch never got there.  Only comment: make sure the hazulnuts are roasted before you start - the roasted flavour enhances it tremendously!!!! 100 thumbs up to LButton!!

i just finished making this recipe. i made it twice this evening. the first time i used the full 1 1/2 cups of nuts, the 2nd time i only used 1 cup and it turned out much better, more toffee flavor! this was very easy to make,and the butter toffee flavors are a wonderful blend. it will make a wonderful presentation at the party tomorrow!

I made this recipe a little backwards and it worked fine. I omitted the nuts (my kids don't like nuts), quadrupled the recipe, poured it into a butter jelly roll pan lined with buttered foil. I let it cool a little and scored with a buttered knife. Then I sprinkled with 12 oz milk chocolate chips, let melt and spread. It turned out great.

Delicious!!  Definitely need to toast the hazelnuts before using- it really enhances the flavor.  The chocolate on ours was really gooey, even after refrigerated (maybe because we're in Hawaii??  To warm?)  But, be prepared with napkins or wipes, or you'll have chocolate coated kids!

Five stars because it's so delicious.  I almost burned it, though, so be watchful when getting to the hard ball stage.

Very easy and yummy.  I only had semi-sweet chocolate chips on hand, which was still good, but I think next time I will go for milk chocolate as the recipe says.  Thanks for the recipe!

Just OK in my book.  I like other toffee recipes I've collected better than this one.  Hazelnut flavor tends to overpower the toffee.
