Nice way to use up stuff you already have.  It could use a steamed vegetable in with the rice.  I recommend broccoli or peas.

Suprisingly good.  Kids ate it.  Added red peppers and green onions because that is what I had in the fridge.  Would probably be good with any veggies.  Great way to use up leftover rice too.

this was okay, the flavor is not great but not bad. I did add peas which was a good addition but the flavor is lacking.

This was good:    I added peas and green onions to the rice.  I also added an additional layer of black olives and cheese before adding the tuna mixture.

I kept true to the recipe.  It came out fine, I just found it to be too simple and bland.  More rice than anything.

This  was pretty good.  I left out the hot pepper sauce and added diced bell pepper.  My kids ate it.  My husband and I liked it as well.

I was skeptical to try this, but the reviews on here made me attempt it. It was good and filling. I was missing 1 key ingredient I thot I had when I started, and that was hot sauce, but I used bbq sauce and it gave it a tangy kick - pretty good! Hubby ate it and was full. Certainly needs a side dish tho, kinda bland to look at, but taste was good - will make again.

LOVED IT!  Had this tonight after searching for last minute ideas yesterday and no $$!  All I had to purchase was the heavy cream.  Two kids liked it, two wouldn't touch it.  Added diced green peppers and an extra 1/4 cup cream and 1/4 cup milk.  Used Basmati (sp) rice for flavors and it's my fav!  Also added a topping of crumbed corn flakes I had left over to half to try it out.  Was awesome with the crunch!  Just needed a bit more of the mixture (minus the tuna).  Going to reheat as left-overs this weekend with an extra batch of cream base.  Great pantry recipe!!  Might try with chicken next time for the other kids.  Thanks!

This is quick, easy, healthy and my wife loves it! We is one of our Friday specials.
I also add peas, red peppers, onion, black olives and a little four cheese mix in the layers to perk up the flavor.

Great pantry recipe. I was mostly true to the recipe the first time (had no cream so subbed condensed cream of mushroom soup). Hub LOVED it, so I've made it several times.  Normally use more tuna, brown rice, add a bag of frozen peas, and sometimes sautéed mushrooms while sautéing the onions and garlic. And I always omit the olives as hub won't touch them.  

I'm always on the lookout for good gluten free recipes, as MIL lives with us and has Celiac. She loves this too. I just have to be sure if I use mushroom soup that it's a GF one.

I think this is one of those recipes that really lends itself to letting your creativity flow!  I used brown rice previously cooked with mushrooms and onions, only had whole milk and used most of the liquid with the canned tuna, put lots of herbs and other spices in the tuna mixture-  ton of dill, and Old Bay, and some cayenne.  Kalamata olives were what I had, and I loved the slight tang they lended.  And of course added a little parm and panko to the topping.  I loved the layering idea, and would never have thought to make a sauce with the tuna.  Thanks!

I followed the recipe and really enjoyed it! I read in some of the other reviews that people added peas. Will try that the next time around just to have a few more veggies in this dish.

Thanks for the recipe!!  I love this recipe!  It is great as is!!!!.....but, I  usually alter it a bit though.  I usually use canned salmon, milk instead of heavy cream, I add green olives, and I mix it instead of layering it.  In the summer I will cover it and microwave on high for about 5-7 minutes.   I also love a little lemon or lime juice squeezed on mine when it is done!

Used 1/2 cup green bell pepper. Topping with jalapeno peppers. And jalapeno pepper hot sauce instead of regular. Didn't have olives. Still good.

I made this recipe for my boyfriend and myself. We both really liked it, but I felt like it could use more hot sauce. We added some Sriracha sauce on top of it and that made it delicious. Next time I make this, I will definately add more hot sauce to the recipe for more flavor! This could make a good kid's meal, if they aren't afraid of a bit of spice. All in all, this recipe is very good!

Add steamed peas with dried basil. Used organic brown rice and substituted evaporated milk with 1/2 tsp. vanilla for the heavy cream. Turned out great and my teenage son loved it!

OMG! It was excellent. I had 1/2 can of baby clams and added it with the tuna. Also I added vegetables ( chopped carrots, broccoli florets, and chopped kale. For hot sauce I used Sriracha sauce about 1/2 tsp. Loved it. I only did 1/2 the recipe since I live on my own and it was great. 2 servings. 2 hrs later Im sitting here salivating. Thanks. Can't wait 2 days to have the leftovers.

I really liked this casserole.  I read several reviews and decided to follow Fitmommy's advice and use one can tuna and one can crab to make it.  I believe this made it richer instead of too fishy tasting.  I also used brown rice cooked in broth with the butter and olive oil.  It had a great "chew" to it; kind of like risotto.  My husband ate a big plate of it too.  We'll definitely make again.

We really liked it!  I didn't have cream so used 1% milk and added the red bell pepper as suggested by another  reviewer.  Will definitely make again.

My picky son who only likes fast food came back for thirds!! I didn't put in the black olives (to keep the kids from "ew"-ing and I added 2 t. Old Bay seasoning to the tuna mixture. The kids were trying to eat the tuna mixture while it was simmering on the stovetop! Thank you for something I can make from pantry items that the kids (and adults!) enjoy.

This was OK, didn’t WOW me.  I replaced some of the water with chicken broth when cooking the rice, and still found this a bit bland.  IMO the sauce tastes like Thousand Island dressing, and I think the proportion of rice to tuna sauce was too much rice.  I have to wonder if the second layer of rice is even necessary.  I did use Genova®  Yellowfin Tuna which is a very good quality, and that did enhance the flavor, but I still was left longing for more.  We added additional hot sauce at the table, and I think some frozen peas might be a good addition to this casserole, and would give it a nice pop of color as well.

This sounded so good, I had to try it. I didn't have heavy cteam, so I used milk. My family doesn't care for black olives, so I left them out. I used habenero pepper sauce. I put some of the cheese over the first layer of rice as well as on top. My family loved this dish.
