As written I give this a four. I have tried it this way and we just prefer the recipe I have from the 60s or 70s. My daughter's friends at college go crazy over that earlier version. It uses 4 Tablespoons of butter, 1(10 oz) bag of marshmallows and 5 cups of rice crispies. This recipe is more marshmallowy and not so dry.

I make this recipe every year at Halloween for 300 people, so I've learned how to make them fast! Don't hesitate to use the microwave version - you'll never go back to the old way again. Other cereal favorites include cocoa krispies and "fruity pebbles" (generics are equally good). My super-secret tip: Pour the melted mix over the cereal (in a huge plastic mixing bowl) and not the other way - the cereal dust coats the plastic bowl and prevents the marshmallow (and everything else) from sticking to the bowl. 
Great ideas for add-ins everyone! I'll try the peanut butter this year!

this recipe is great.. but i usually add 2ml of vanilla to the recipe... if you use diet/light margarine, it turns out soggy and tends to be extra sticky(not in a good way)... and i noticed some margarines do the same, so stick to butter to be on the safe side... also... use the microwave method... ever since i've tried the microwave method, i never went back to the stove top... it's quicker and it's not as messy... but when microwaving-- first, put in the the butter until it melts (approx. 30 sec) then coat the marshmallows in the butter and microwave until it looks ALMOST completely melted (approx 1-1.5 mins) then stir until the marshmallows are completely melted. then add the vanilla, stir again, and then toss in the cereal... if you don't want it as gooey, add another cup of cereal... enjoy!!! =)

I noticed everyone putting their suggestions on how to flatten the mix into the pan - my tried and true way -I butter my hands...just like putting on lotion and flatten it with my hands...works like a charm EVERY time.  Makes a classic treat even easier to make!

So good! I always double this by using a whole box (12.5 oz) of Rice Krispies, 16oz mini marshmallow, 1 stick of butter, and I put it all into one since 9x13 pan for extra thick treats. I pack in and smooth out treats by pressing into pan with a piece of wax paper. So easy and neat.

Came out GREAT! I used butter and a little orange food coloring.  I buttered up my hands, shaped them into carrots and stuck a green piece of sour licorice onto the end for a stem.  We served them at my son's kindergarten Petter Rabbit play.  They were an absolute hit!  Not a single one was left.

MMMM!!!! So delicious...I didn't change a thing.  All I did was used wax paper in a 9x13 pan and melted semisweet chocolate filled one side of the pan, put that in the fridge. Once it firmed up I buttered my hands and put the treats in the pan.  The cut easily and the ones with the chocolate base were heavenly!!!! Will make many times to come.

These are probably my all-time favorite sweet treat!  I add about a teaspoon of cinnamon to the melted marshmallows for a flavor twist. People always ask what the mystery flavor is and agree that it adds something special. I also don't like gooey treats, so I mix in an extra cup of cereal.

Truly classic and *the* recipe for this great treat. For the holidays, I mix food coloring into the saucepan (red or green for Christmas, orange for Halloween, etc.,) for a more festive treat!

I actually just finished making these.  This is the same recipe that my mom used when I was a child.  Brings back so many good memories! (Just learned a very valuable lesson- More marshmallows does not make them better - It makes the Rice Krispies hard)

The past twenty years I have made these for each family menber but with a twist, my favorite is a kiss. Press a handful of the mixture into a buttered tuperware funnel, pop it out, drizzel with melted chocolate, wrap in foil and you have a "hersheys kiss".  I then print Merry Christmas and the persons name and wrap it around the top.  Some years I have make a star, or a Christmas tree using small jello molds.  This year my 28 yr old son helped me and we added peppermint chips to the mixture. Yummy!

I actually completely screwed these up but I think that was more my fault than the recipes, so I will still give it 5 stars. My microwave was way too powerful for the marshmellow and on a weird setting I didn't notice, I put the rice krispies in and it went all hard and black.. but it tasted  good!

The instructions on the box also say you can use 4 cups miniature marshmallows, so I tried one batch of each to compare.  I wondered why it wouldn't just call for the whole bag of miniatures as well, since they only weigh .5 oz more.  For the miniatures, I set my microwave timer for 1 min 30 sec, walked away, and came back to a huge mess -- they had somehow overflowed down the outsides of my large glass measuring cup.  I set the microwave timer for the same time for the large marshmallows, standing watch this time, but did not have the same problem.  I preferred the less gooey batch the miniatures produced, but the large marshmallows seemed to melt better in the microwave, so I will try using less of the large marshmallows next time.  A pizza cutter sprayed with non stick spray made for quick easy portioning in my foil pan.

I used 4 cups rice krispies and 2 cups Kix (thanks kids).  I also added holiday shapes and chocolate chips, which melted into the marshmallows anyway, but made it tasty and colorful.  I dont' really like Rice Krispies Treats, but I love these, of course, modified. :D

Who doesn't love rice krispies treats?  I didn't use as much rice krispies as the recipe calls for because I found that they turned out hard and dry when I did.

Made "for the grandkids"  with cocoa krispies and chocolate marshmallows.  Good thing we taught those little kids to share!  Lots of variations available now with the flavored marshmallows on the market.  Just be sure to use butter and not the stuff that comes in the tubs.  The water in the spreads will ruin your Treats.

As if this recipe needs my measly little rating....it's a classic.  However, this is also fun to make with Fruity Pebbles or Cocoa Pebbles.

Absolutely perfect, old timey recipe.  I use the microwave for only 2 minutes on high.  Stir well with wooden spoon and then poor in the rice krispies.  You have to really stir it with a lot of strength, but it's worth it!  I butter my hands to press it into the pan.  Works perfect.

Absolutely yummy. Used a bag of the flavored mini-marshmallows instead, because that's what we had. After they were done, I frosted them to use for my daughter's birthday. It was too hot to bake a cake - used the microwave recipe. Worked out wonderfully! If you attempt to frost, I recommend a THIN layer of frosting, or they are way too sweet.

This was so easy to make, I had never made these and was surprised at how easy and how few ingredients it took.  They tasted great! We added green food color for St. Patricks day.

Classic recipe, tried and true! I make these often and usually add 1/2 cup of chocolate chips at the very end.  This time I used a heart cookie cutter and then dipped them in chocolate...heaven!

I was in the mood for something sweet and decided to make these since it's been years since I've had them. OMG I forgot how good they were. I couldn't stop eating it as I was mixing it while the mixture was still warm. My daughter and I did a good job in getting rid of them quick. Something so simple made us so happy.

Yummy just as they are!  I get on a healthy kick sometimes and switch out a half cup of oatmeal for a cup of rice crispies and sometimes stir in chopped pecans.  You can do basically anything with the original recipe.

This recipe is so yummy!  I still make it the old fashioned way just haven't tried it in the microwave I always use a few more marshmallows than called for and I add 1/2 cup or so of peanut butter when melting marshmallows!  These never last long at our home my husband likes it when I top them with chocolate frosting but he is the only one that likes them that way.

Solid recipe, *but* if you are making these with the gluten free cereal, you might want to consider adding vanilla or some flavoring. The taste is not as good as the original version.  Really missing that malt taste.

I made very slight adjustments...I used 5 cups of cereal instead 6, and 4 Tbs of butter instead of 3. I separated 1 cup of marshmallows from the rest and mixed it in with the dry cereal. I microwaved the butter and marshmallow mix and poured it into the cereal instead of the other way around as well. That being said, I had NO problem with the finished mix sticking to the container when pouring into my pan. Cleanup was a cinch, and the finished product tasted more like the Starbucks rice krispies, with chunks of gooey marshmallow in each piece. Hubby LOVED them and I will definately make again.

Good recipe. I added 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and a 1/2 tsp of vanilla. The whole family loved them. Spray the bottom of a measuring cup with non-stick cooking spray and use it to press the mixture into the pan. You can really make it firm so that the treats hold together better.

Always a classic!  For Halloween this year, we added orange food coloring to the heated marshmellows and then green sugar sprinkles on top of the treats cooling in the pan.

A true classic for any occasion.  I wrap the squares in waxed paper and then store them in a zip lock bag in the frezzer if we don't eat them all right away.  I've thrown chocolate chips, red hot cinnamon candies, and chopped gumdrops in at different times, but the plain ones are still the best.

I’ve made these quite a few times. The recipe as written seemed a bit dry. After reading the reviews I tried adding 4 tablespoons of butter, a 10.5oz bag of mini marshmallows and 5 cups of rice cereal.  I prefer using more butter and less cereal.  Thanks for the recipe

Even if you use marshmallow creme, you still have to melt it with butter in a pan. This recipe was pretty simple. I added mini chocolate chips. I might try this recipe again with healthier ingredients next time.

As written, this recipe would rate 4 stars for me. With my tweaks, absolutely a 5 star! I use a teeny tiny bit more butter than called for, and all the other measurements in the recipe are the same. Make absolutely sure your butter/marshmallow mixture doesn't brown at all or they won't be as good. 
I also added a capful of milk (as suggested in the reviews) and a buttload of vanilla. I don't measure, but it was probably about 1.5 tsp or so. To flatten the treats, I use the wet-hands trick and they come out perfectly :)

Recipe was easy and clean up was a breeze. I used a tip in one of the reviews I read ( add the butter & marshmallow mix to the cereal and not the other way around). This was so simple my kids are wanting to make this themselves.

This recipe was very easy and tasty!  I added about 1/4 tsp vanilla and used the microwave method of cooking for simplicity.  Adding the melted marshmellow mixture to the rice crispies in a large bowl worked out well, but you still have to work fast to get the mixture in a 9x13 pan.  I used a large metal serving spoon to flatten out the mixture into the pan to help condense it firmly into the pan.  I drizzled melted milk chocolate chips on top for extra flavoring.  You will then need to refridgerate the rice crispy treats with the chocolate on top to get the chocolate to harden again.

These are always great.  I used to make them with my mom growing up, and they are just as big a hit now with my daughter.  We always use the microwave - they're much easier that way, and we usually add a blob of peanut butter for taste, and a few extra Krispies to keep them from being too gooey.  Spray non-stick cooking spray on your knife before you cut them to make them cut easily.

The recipe was overall great! I would however, recommend some form of pressure on the treats while they are cooling off. Just put wax paper over them and maybe a book to help pack in the rice krispies. I didn't do this, so mine were falling apart. The only thing i could do was place them in the freezer to make sure they stayed in tact. Then i cut them. I made some with coconut and vanilla morsels and others dipped. :)

Of course these were delicious..there a classic!  I used butter as I do with all of my baking.  We took these on a road trip and they were gone within 1 day.  Next time I would stir in some Peanut Butter along with the marshmallows for extra yumminess.

When made with the cinnamon toast crunch watch your caramelization, the extra sugars from the cereal can become harder or softer depending on exposure to heat. Both time and temperature CAN affect this! Then again who is to say whether soft and chewy or candy shell and tacky is better over the other in both ways to hold and taste.

It was super easy and fun to make! I used the stove top but if you have little ones and they want to help definitely start with the microwave. I added a teaspoon of vanilla and topped the Rice Krispies off with mini chocolate chips and drizzle.

We love rice krispy treats. To make ghosts, cut the rice krispy treats with a metal cookie cutter. For the icing, melt 1 and 1/2 cups of white chocolate morsels  and 1 Tablespoon of oil in a  microwave safe container.  I used a 2 cup Pyrex measuring cup. Start with 30 seconds at a time. Stir, and repeat. You might need another 15-20 seconds to melt the white chocolate morsels. Use a knife to apply icing.

Easy Recipe and went together easily. Was terrific the first night.  However, overnight hard as a brick.  Fortunately, by microwaving the pieces about 10 sec , they were soft and edible again.

This is great! I followed the instructions and it came out really good. 
The next time I made them I took Mary Domaz's recipe from "most helpful positive review" and just doubled up on the ingredients and added a tablespoon of vanilla and they came out perfect. 

8 Tablespoons of butter 
2 (10 oz) bag of marshmallows
10 cups of rice crispies.
1 tbsp of vanilla 

Melt the butter and marshmallows slow and you'll be good to go.

I love this recipe, I do it exactly as stated & dip my treats in chocolate for some added decadence. Also important tip****wet your hands when shaping your treats**** this makes it so much easier to deal with the stickiness!!!

Made as per recipe, except using Becel light instead of butter (thought we had butter in the fridge). They turned out fine, maybe a little gooey. I'll add a little more cereal next time and try butter and a little vanilla extract. I'll also try the pizza cutter/spray and pouring the mixture over the cereal. That said, they got eaten up pretty fast.

I noticed someone else makes these the same way I do.  If you follow the recipe as written above, the treats dry out fast and become hard. Just add a 1 extra tb if butter and 10 extra big marshmallows. This always keeps the treats from drying out.

Nice and easy. Satisfied my sugar craving. Hardest part was getting the mix to be flat when I poured it into the pan. I read the tips afterwards, so I'll try them next time!

I made these into christmas wreaths - added green food coloring and shaped into wreaths, then added red frosting bows. Turned out great. I might add a little more butter and mallow, didn't quite seem enough.

Use cocoa crispies and after you cut them up add duched cocoa to a plastic bag ,put a chunk in and shake to coat . Tap off excess and use cling wrap to store.

I haven't made Rice Krispie treats in years! But I'm giving a tea party for my grandgirls tomorrow; so I made these, cut them in narrow fingers, and dipped them halfway in pink candy melts. They'll be perfect on the top tier of the tea tray, and I know the girls will love them!

As other reviewers have noted, adding an extra tablespoon or two of butter really helps the flavour. I also add about a tablespoon of real vanilla to the melted butter/marshmallow mixture. As they have been for decades, these treats are a tried-and-true hit with kids and grown-ups alike. Will make them again and again.

Fast and easy to make. I would recommend using a double boiler for melting the butter and then putting the butter in a bigger sauce man and then mix in the marshmallows and cereal. It turned out great. I accidently burnt mine once I put in the cereal but it turned out good.   Great instructions!

This is a great, basic rice krispy recipe ... great for any party!  Some reviewers said they were too dry, but they turned out good and if you like a moister type then it is easy to modify; the recipe didn't say it was ultra moist.  Thanks for the great recipe, Kellogg!

Wow!  Couldn't get any easier or quicker. Good tip I read in one of the reviews: add the marshmallow to the Rice Krispies.  I find it easier to mix. I also sprayed Pam on the spatula I used to mix the treats. Didn't stick to it. This

I used all marshmallow cream in this recipe and the treats did not hold together.  We ended up eating them with a spoon out of the bowl.  You could possibly use a little marshmallow cream, but the bulk of the recipe should be the regular marshmallows.

I used only four cups of cereal.   We like our treats a little gooier.   I also topped them with a thin layer of  caramel made from sweetened condensed milk then sprinkled with flaked sea salt.

As written, I have to give it a 4.  I followed the review that said to use more butter and less cereal.  Pics have made it both ways and it is way too dry the original way.

Great recipe.  It's great for the kids and adults!!  Very easy to make.  I used 4 cups of the miniature marshmallows.  I used a flat plastic spatula the whole time and the butter from mixing made it very easy to spread.

I used parchment paper to push the treats down into the pan.  I also added some mini milk chocolate chips on top and it melted, adding a nice thin layer of chocolate.

Rice Crispie Treats are sooo good. I haven't had them in sooo long. They took a little while to become completely hard enough to cut, but they were tasty.

Who doesn't like these? I sometimes use my non stick Tupperware microwave cookware to melt the marshmallows but usually do these the old fashioned way on the stove. I have to laugh at the comment on the recipe that these are best if served the same day - my family barely lets me get them in the 9 x 13 before they are drooling over them. I am lucky if they last the hour! Thanks for posting here though as sometimes I put the cereal in plastic containers and the recipe isn't available to the kids from the box.

Everyone loves these!  I used a generic rice crispy cereal and next time I will definitely use Rice Crispies. I followed the microwave directions and that was very simple. Also, I added some peanut butter and we really like them like that.

who doesn't love these? They taste the best when they're still a little warm.

Always a winner. I make this for my husband's friend everytime he comes over to help out with home projects.  Apparently I make them better than his wife does - which is hard to believe but it makes me feel good.

We had to add a couple extra cups of rice crispies. Otherwise they were great! We make this treat at least once a week, and Im sure it will be even more often once we have kids. :D

Thought this was delicious!!! I don't like my treats as chewy though, but great none the less.
