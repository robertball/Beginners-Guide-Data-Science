I made one loaf and a batch of muffins.  They were both okay but a little to dry for me to make again.

I halved the recipe and it was GREAT!  I reduced the oats by 1/4 cup to try to help with the dryness comments of others and mine didn't come out dry at all.  I will make this again!

This is a wonderful recipe........except for the cranberries! Way too many, & way tooooooo tart! I will make it again however, because it utilizes oats, it's sweet without sugar, dense, moist,& altogether a nice healthy recipe that tastes very good once we picked out those berries! Next time I'll substitute raisins or dates.

After reading the reviews about this bread being too dry, I decided to add one small mashed banana. I scaled the recipe to one loaf. It still came out dry, too dense and it is not sweet enough.

My husband eats this for breakfast and snacks. I have added 1/4 cup flaxseed for more fiber and omega 3 and substituted the vegatable oil with no sugar added applesauce. I also used dried cranberries after I boiled the moisture back into them. All of my neighbors love it!!!!!

HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE!!  I failed to read others comments and as I was preparing, I did notice how dry the dough was. However, I took a risk and tried not to add more oil.  Knowing that the dough felt dry, I took it out of the oven WAY early then its suggested 40-45 minutes.  Yes, it is dry but quite tasty. The cranberries was not that tart as some as suggested as I tend to love cranberry drinks or the tartest apple out there.  My suggestion is you can doctor this up to make it "yummy" or you can doctor it up a little more to make it HEALTHY. Sometimes I enjoy eating the most unhealthy stuff but I also enjoy eating things that taste guiltfree as well. Try:  Egg beaters instead of egg Soymilk instead of milk Wheat flour instead of white  It ALREADY uses honey and NO sugar! I use local honey in my tea already so using this in my foods was a bonus!). I also love recipes that uses oats!  Great recipe, will try again. As the author's note suggested, it is a "hearty" recipe.

I added one container of flavored yogurt and chopped the cranberries, as the first time I made the recipe, it was dry and the cranberries were too tart.  Once I added the yogurt and the chopped fresh cranberries, I made them into muffins, and the muffins were terrific.  They are even better the next day.

After reading the reviews, I added about 1.5-2 cups homemade cranberry sauce to the batter to help the dryness and distribute the tartness of the cranberries.  The bread was moist enough and the color was pretty but the flavor STILL isn't as robust as I had hoped.  I probably won't make this again.

I used only 1c of cranberries and sliced them prior to adding into the dough. I also used almond milk. The bread is too dry. But I like the flavor.

Great recipe for a healthy bread. What I did was double it, sub 3 cups wholewheat flour and 2 cups reg white for the 5C flour, cut the honey to 1 1/4, added 5T of ground flax and put it into 2 loaf pans and 1 med (normal sized) cupcake tin for muffins. I cooked the muffins for 30 min and the bread for 45. Both came out lovely, but muffins were a bit dry and needed butter. Overall, the bread was better and more moist. I will make both again.

My family enjoyed this recipe.  I put the cranberries in the chopper, so they would not be so tart.  Also, I increased my oil and sugar, as recommended by others.  I will be using this again.  Loved the oatmeal in it.

Solved the moistness issue by increasing the 1/3 cup of oil to 1/2 cup.  But that still didnt solve the problem that this really just didnt taste very nice.  The bread doesnt have much flavor, but the cranberries pack a powerfully tart punch. It was edible... just not worth the effort.

OMG, the dough turned out like cookie dough so I got a tester in the oven now to see if as a cookie it might work.   I might add some vanilla yogurt to the dough (or canned pumpkin) but even so,  won't be using it as a bread, maybe muffins!  The cookie came out fine....So it's cookies for me this time!

This bread was excellent!  I was searching for a recipe that didn't call for orange juice and this was a big hit! I substituted 1 cup whole wheat flour & sprinkled turbino sugar on top before baking. Accidentally left it in the oven a bit longer than intended, giving the bread a toasted essence. Made a cranberry relish w/the remaining 1 cup cranberries (cooked with 1/3 cup water & 1/3 cup sugar) until berries burst and thickened. Served with the warm bread as a compote/jam. The honey and oats were the perfect counterbalance to the tart & juicy cranberries. Definitely making this recipe again!

I followed this recipe exactly as written and my house smelled amazing as it was baking. However the end product was extremely disappointing. It was Very, Very, Dry.  As I was putting the batter into the loaf pans I noticed it seemed quite dense and double checked the recipe in case I had misread the ingredients and should add additional liquid,  but I hadn't and figured the low amount of liquid was made up with the addition of the honey. When I try this again I will be adding extra liquid to increase the moisture. Beyond that the taste is excellent, just to to dry.Am going to try toasting it then putting on butter to see how that will work out

Wonderful and refreshing. Using honey in lieu of white or brown sugar and no shortening or butter makes this a much healthy choice for a snack or breakfast bread. The tart cranberries and the not so sweet bread was delicious. Bread was not dry and has a light texture. This one will go in the recipe box for sure.

I read all the reviews before making it and added ingredients to make it moister, because dryness was the main complaint.  I cut the oats to 1/2 cup, added 1/2 mashed banana, 1/2 C of sour cream, 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg and 2 tsp. of flaxseed.  I made 1 regular loaf and 3 mini's for gifts.  I used thawed frozen cranberries and cut some of the bigger ones in half.  Quite a few modifications, but the result was wonderful.

I modified the recipe:
I used 2 bananas
2/3 C veg oil
1 Cup of milk
3 eggs
I also used dried cranberries
It turned out moist unlike the previous reviews the only other thing to sweeten up I would increase the honey or add 1/4 c of sugar and go to a tsp of cinnamon.  I like it the way I prepared.  But for those who like a sweeter bread you will need to increase the amount of honey or sugar.

I'm rating this three out of five because, like other testers, I found this to be too dry! (Not too dry to eat, but dry enough not to want to make again.) Oh well...at least I used up all that honey!

This was pretty good.  Slightly dry but still pretty good.  Made 1 loaf and 9 muffins.  Will make a few changes next time.
