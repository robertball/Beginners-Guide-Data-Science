I baked my wings until they were done and after coating with the sauce, I put them back in the oven and put them under the broiler to make the sauce stick and they were outstanding! I will be making these again!!!

I followed the recipe exactly and also pre-marinated the wings for 3 hours.  I loved the recipe, but I found that marinating causes the BBQ to flare up from the butter.  Next time I will not marinade and make the sauce just before the wings are done (slighlty melting the butter in the microwave first).  Rather than simmering the sauce, just use as is and it will coat the wings better.  The simmering thins the sauce too much and is an unnecessary step.  And if you make the sauce too early the butter will harden.  However, the flavor was awesome and we will definately make again and again!

This recipe is great, while I like regular Buffalo wings I feel like they are lacking something, now I realize that the sweetness of this sauce is what has been missing all along.Since I don't have a grill I baked my wings and then charred them a little under the broiler. They were perfect.

Very good, but suggest using a little less butter (was fine but didn't seem necessary). Also baked wings instead of grilling. Used this method: marinated wings in half of mixture for at least 1 hour (did mine overnight). Placed wing on baking sheet and baked 40 minutes at 350 degrees. Removed, then added rest of sauce and turned up oven to 375-400 degrees for another 7-10 minutes (for sauce to stick). Delicious.

This is the best recipe I have found for chicken wings.  I've been making these wings for several months now and each time I make them I get tons of compliments and requests for the recipe.  I never have leftovers.  I don't recommend marinating them in the sauce beforehand because the butter causes the wings to flare up on the grill, thus over-charring them.  I found the sauce can serve at least 9 pounds of chicken wings.  If you use the recommended 6 pounds, you will have plenty of sauce left over.

For optimum flavor, I believe these wings should be marinated overnight in half of the sauce mix.  Also, donâ€™t be afraid to use the entire teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  When I added the honey, the spicy heat from the hot sauce was greatly reduced.  My husband grilled the wings over mesquite briquettes.  Our leftovers seem to get more flavorful each day.  When shared, they were a definite hit with his employees at work!  Thanks Lisa!

Man, these are AWESOME.
we bake ours @425 for about 45 minutes dip in sauce then bake again about 15 and dip again and bake about 10 more. MMM good. this gives it a more crusty skin. I save sauce for more dipping. I also add more cayenne, we like it hot

I'm not a chicken wing fan, but my husband and his sports fantatic buddies love them.  So, I put these wings on the grill, drenched them in the sauce, and served them. When they were done with the wings, they didn't even want to throw the leftover sauce away!

Had to make a dish for New Years and even though I love hot wings I've never made them.  This recipe made a great batch of wings, which weren't too hot for all to enjoy. Thanks!

This is a winner. There is an addictive quality to this recipe. Can't stop eating them! The combination of sweet honey and spicey louisiana sauce is perfect! I recommend grilling the chicken over a flame for the charbroil (added) flavor. Enjoy!

Great wings, they are always a hit. I have made these alot. I do put some cornstarch into the sauce to thicken it up. This coats the wings better.

Since I don't grill out in December, I drenched the wings in the sauce and then baked them for 30 minutes.  When they were finished, I poured the remaining sauce over them.  Perfectly tender and not offensively spicy.

Due to non-stop rain, I cooked the wings in the oven. I seasoned wings with garlic granules, sea salt & coarse ground black pepper; baked in oven till done. I combined sauce and wings in ziplock bag, mixed well and let sit for a bit. On a foil wrapped pan, I placed coated wings back in oven till sauce was bubbly. I fixed 3 different kinds of wings and this sauce was my favorite! Will certainly make again. Thanks for sharing!

These were pretty good. I agree with the previous reviewer about not warming up the sauce. I had trouble getting the sauce to stick. I will probably make it agin without warming up the sauce.

This is the first time we've ever grilled buffalo wings (and my first time ever eating buffalo wings). Hubby did great with the grilling, and the sauce tastes like it should taste good, we just have discovered that we're not spicy buffalo wings people. But the sauce smelled yummy and if we liked spicy, we'd like this recipe.

I thought they were ok. Not exceptional.  However, my family LOVED them.  Even the three year old.  These aren't hot, just spicy so don't be scared to follow the recipe exactly.

I made the sauce, and added extra garlic salt and pepper and soaked the wings for 6 hours, then I cooked them on my smoker, using mesquite for 30 min at 350.  after taking them off the smoker I put them back in to the remaining sauce, which I had heated up and added a little corn starch to.  When they were again fully coated I placed on cookie sheet and put in oven at 350 for 10 min.  They were awesome!  best wings I have had!  But if you want them to have any kind of zip I would at least double up on the cayenne pepper, these wings were delicious but there was no zip them,.

Everyone raved about these wings.  I marinated the wings (without the butter) and then after grilling, poured the marinade over as described in the recipe.    I did not simmer the marinade though.  I just popped it in the microwave for about a minute or so.

This was very good.  I deep fried my wings first for 12 minutes (no breading) and then tossed them with some of the sauce.  Since it was very thin, I did the same as a previous review said and added a little cornstarch mixed with water to the remaining sauce to thicken just a little.  I poured more of the thickened sauce over top of the wings and tossed again.  I then baked the wings in a very hot oven (450 degrees) for about 7-8 minutes just to brown the sauce a little, which is what I do anytime I make chicken wings.  They were very tasty.  I did cut down a little on the cayenne and it was still plenty hot.  Next time I might use a little more honey since I like sweeter sauce, but overall this was very good.

Very very good!  I couldn't find Louisiana-style hot sauce so I added all the spices to regular buffalo wing sauce I bought at the store.  It made the regular sauce extra ordinary and extra delicious.  I added more cayenne pepper for extra heat.  Poured the sauce over baked chicken wings and tossed together just before serving.  People were licking the sauce off their fingers!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Awesome recipe! I added 1 tablespoon red pepper flakes and I baked mine and then broiled for a couple minutes instead of grilling. I didnt use the chyenne pepper and the spice was just perfect. I do not like anything real spicy. Best wings I have ever ate!

This was a great recipe.  Very easy to make.  I did marinate the chicken overnight and it was fantastic!

Made these for the Super Bowl and they were a hit!  Be careful to not add too much cayenne... I put them in the crock pot to keep warm while watching the game.

Who knew that hot wings were so freaking easy to make. I did do a couple things differently but they turned out awesome and will be a regular for us now. As I was shopping for louisiana hotsauce I noticed that they actually sell a hot wing sauce kit which consist of the wing sauce and seasoning. I bought this and seasoned the wings and marinated them for 24 hours in only the seasonings. Then I mixed the louisiana wing sauce with everything from the original recipe. I really think the honey and the seasonings make this recipe. My grill went out so I deep fried the wings for 15 minutes per batch on 375. All I have to say is YUMMY!

Great recipe!  I just made this for my brother and I and we loved them.  I must say that they came out better than if I had ordered them from a local shop.  The blend of sweetness and spice was perfect.  I went strictly by the recipe and everything was great.  I actually had more sauce then I thought which is better than not enough.  I used a mix of wingettes and drumettes.  I will happily add this to my list of favorties and look forward to the next family BBQ so more folks can try them out!

I didn't have any Louisiana-style hot sauce, but I did have Tapatio hot sauce.  I looked around online, and several sites said that the Louisiana-style has more vinegar, so here's what I tried.  I used 1/3 cup of Tapatio and added in white vinegar to make 1/2 cup.  I kept everything else the same, but left out the cayenne since it seemed spicy enough.  The sauce tasted delicious, and I marinated the wings for about 45 minutes.  Here's what I should NOT have done - I followed one other person's review to turn up the heat to 400 for 7 minutes towards the end...bad idea - it ended up burning the sauce and blackening the parts of the wings touching the pan.  However, the unburned parts still tasted pretty good!  It's just too bad parts got burned.  Next time, I will try it with Louisiana-style sauce to see if it's better, and I'll leave the oven temperature the same throughout.    There is this packaged wing seasoning from French's (that I think used to be another brand) that tastes REALLY good - I was hoping that this would taste the same, but it's still a bit different (and the French's seasoning is still tastier).  However, this isn't bad for making it from scratch!

Made these wings for a party and the guys loved them. I found that marinating them over night really helped keep the flavor strong. I also found them easier to bake so I didn't have to worry about the marinade burning on the grill. Great recipe!

Best chicken wings ever. For the lazy people out there you can use frozen wings too. You can even use precooked wings and microwave them and then pour the sauce over them. You can even use frozen precooked flavored hot wings or lime wings and then pour the sauce over them and cook them in the oven. As you can see I have got pretty lazy. :) But for parties I usually just fry them and then bake them with the sauce poured over them. Po

This recipe is exactly like the recipe I use. With one exception honey.  What a great change up.  Thanks for the idea! Everyone at my party raved about these wings.  One person said these were the best wings he had ever had in all his life. He is 75 years old!

GREAT RECIPE...When I get invited to a bbq the first thing they ask me is "can you bring those wings?"  They are fantastic and I recommend marinated with the sauce grilling and than basting with some more of the same sauce.  They are fantastic!!!!!!  Thank you so much for sharing :)

These were the greatest.  I will never make wings another way.  I didn't even use a full cup of honey, cause I ran out.  I also did not marinate.  Just grilled the chicken and tossed them in the sauce.  I had allot of sauce left over.  So I just store it and will use it today for lunch.  Yummy.  Thanks

These wings are great!  I make the sauce first, and simmer the wings in the sauce, basting often for 10-15 minutes, remove from heat, and let sit while coals heat.  Because of the high butter content, the sauce will burn when it drips down on the coals, so allow the sauce to drain off the wings as much as possible, and have a spray bottle handy before placing wings on the grill.   I baste lightly with the sauce while they are cooking, careful not to let it drip on the coals.   The real "Louisiana Hot Sauce" works best, I tried several others .

I would give these 10 stars if I could.  These are AWESOME!!!  They have just the right amount of bite.  I did throw in some red pepper flakes and only used 1/4 cup of butter....This is going to replace my standard wing recipe.

Made these 'spur of the moment' and everyone thought they were great.  I baked the wings in the oven, taking the advice to char them a bit under the broiler before saucing.  Will definitely include these on my SuperBowl buffet.

Wow!  This is by far the BEST recipe that I ever tried for wings that does not call for deep frying.  I didn't change a thing -- just followed the recommendations for marinating and grilling, and the wings were superb.  Thanks Lisa!

I was fixing a quick snack item for the basketball game and had some boneless hot wings that I got from Costco and just needed a sauce to go over it.  I chose this one and it was FANTASTIC!  I have to tell you though, if you do plan to use any prepared buffalo wing and use this sauce over it, be prepared to watch sweat run down everyones face.  If I had thought about it, I would have omitted the cayenne pepper as the prepared boneless buffalo wings already had the heat in them and to top it with this great sauce-well, lets just say we wouldn't give it to the kids!  I had a great time watching the husband sweat buckets-all the while he couldn't stop eating them.  This is a great recipe, despite MY mistake.

I have been looking for something different from our traditional recipe and the sweetness of the honey and the kick from the cayenne pepper was just what we were looking for. I added a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce and added quite a bit more garlic powder and pepper to fit our taste. Since it is January, I also cooked them in the oven. I cooked them directly on the rack for 40 minutes on 400 degrees then tossed them in the sauce and baked for an additional 10-15 minutes. The adjustments were based on our personal preferences so this recipe deserves five stars.

These wings were some of the best I ever had hands down.Made them for a handful of people.It was a hit with everyone.DO NOT SMELL THE SAUCE WHILE ITS ON THE STOVE.It will make you think twice..But the wings are spicy for a bit and as soon as you feel like they are too spicy this sweet explosion hits and you think "hey this isn't that bad!!" Overall this recipe has the perfect balance of spicy and sweet as the name indicates and oh you definitely will have a lot of sauce left over it you don't get the correct amount or chicken!

Mmm. These are quite good. I don't have a grill, so I baked them. Took the suggestion of several reviewers to broil them at the end to make the sauce stick. Haha thanks for nothing! Broiling didn't make the sauce stick; it just burned my wings. Luckily they weren't ruined. But these are good, and I will be making them again, just sans the extraneous broiling procedure

Very good. I did add a little flour to thicken it. I also added some apricot jam.

everyone LOVED these!  made as directed, except a littles less cayenne just because I wasn't sure just how hot they would be but could have used a little more so will increase next time. They were still delicious.  Would like to try on boneless chicken breast, make extra and cut up for a salad.  YUMMY

These were sooo yummy!!! I made them with 2 bone in chicken breasts that I didn't know what to do with. I halved the sauce since I didn't have much chicken & I didn't bother simmering it on the stove. I lined a baking dish with aluminum foil for easy cleanup & mixed the sauce then poured it over my chicken. Baked it at 350 for 40 minutes then turned it up to 400 for 10 more minutes so the sauce would stick. It was delicious!!!! Thanks for the wonderful recipe....it tasted like my normal buffulo chicken recipe but with a little kick of sweetness! It was great :-)

These wings were perfect! I seasoned them with salt and pepper and grilled them on my George Foreman grill, then I baked them in the sauce. My husband says this is hie favorite dish now!

This sauce was absolutely fabulous.  I did change it a bit because I didn't have all of the honey so I added corn syrup with it.  I thought this was going to be way too hot for my husband but he really liked it.  Will definitely make this again.  I did marinate half of the sauce in the chichen for 2 hrs and then put in the oven at 350 for 1 hr.  Pourded the rest of the reserved sauce and broiled for 5 minutes.  Thanks again

The flavor was exellent but the sauce itself was rather gooey and gummy. I don't think I would simmer it for 10 min... I would heat it just until it got warm and then just leave it alone. otherwise, it was very good.

These wings turned out "okay".  I liked them, but my boyfriend did not.  We grilled the the wings.  It may turn out better as a sauce for breaded/battered wings from the fryer

This was my first time ever making wings and this recipe rocks!  Before putting on grill, I seasoned chicken with some seasoned salt. I only used one stick of butter and added more cayenne and some BBQ sauce while simmering sauce.  Hubbie basted the chicken while on the grill and then we added rest of sauce before eating.

We make wings all the time and they've always been deep fried. Grilling them was a first for us and I can honestly say that I don't ever want to go back! They were amazing and we loved the sweet and spicy sauce which was also a very nice change. Thank you Lisa!!

I didn't really follow the directions on this one, but followed the basic idea of it. I sprinkled creole seasoning, black pepper and cayenne pepper on the wings then baked them at 400 in the oven for about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, I heated the hot sauce, butter and honey over medium low until the wings were done. Then I poured half the sauce on the wings, returned them to oven for about 10 minutes, and then poured the rest of the sauce on top. I didn't use a whole stick of butter, just a little more than half, 11 tbsp of hot sauce, and I didn't measure the honey but I'm sure it wasn't 1 cup. I think I will deep fry them next time - I like them extra crispy.

This is by far the best chicken wing sauce I have ever tried. The first time I made it though it was way too hot. But I've made it several times since and just used less cayenne pepper. Also, I don't use all that butter. I use about 2 tablespoon. Since there is a lot of leftover sauce, we just grill up a couple pieces of chicken and make chicken sandwiches the next day. YUMMMM..Thanks for the recipe

My husband and I love these.  We tried marinating the wings in a bit of hot sauce first then grilling.  They are very hot, but still great.  We also cooked them alot longer in the oven, about 30 minutes altogether.

I have made this at least 5 times already.  Each time they are excellent!  Make them on the grill and after cover with sauce and continue baking in a low oven until guest arrive.  Everyone wants the recipe and they can not believe how easy it is to make!

Simple recipe but GREAT taste! I wouldn't change a thing. Everytime I make these at a BBQ people ask me for the recipe. It is such a simple recipe that I feel embarrassed to give it out. fyi...The longer you cook the sauce, the hotter the sauce will get.

This is excellent. I could easily give this 12 stars. My thirteen year old just loves it. He would eat it every day if i let him . I broil them in the oven instead of putting them on the grill,they came out just fine.

This recipe was excellent.  I usually don't like anything hot but I'm glad I tried them.  Will definitely make again.

I must say this recipe surely pleases the crowd!!! I did choose to modify the recipe. Instead of grilling the chicken I seasoned it with cajun seasoning and placed them in the oven to cook. When I noticed they were almost done I covered them with the sauce and allowed them to cook until finished!!! Perfect!!

These are the best wings I have evet tasted in my entire life. I came across this recipe about a month ago and I have already made it 4 times. I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE it. I use Franks buffalo wing hot sauce and Kirklands Honey. To make it juicy, you can make some extra sauce and pour it on top everytime you heat it up.

HUGE Hit!!  Don't even bother looking elsewhere for another wing recipe!  Some cooking method changes: 1.) throw everything into a crockpot and cook on high for a couple hours and then 2.) finish them off on the grill or broil in oven to get 'em crispy.  Yum yum yum!!  Thanks for sharing!!!

Somewhat snowed in, school and job shut down for the day so I decided today would be a good day to try a new recipe.  Since I had all the ingredients on hand, I took a stab at it.  Let me tell you, this recipe was AWESOME!  Hubby and the children could not get enough of them.  I changed it up a little by frying the wingettes (floured) and poured the sauce over them in a pan and put them under the broiler for about 5 minutes.  Delicious is all that needs to be said!  This is a must try recipe!  Yum!

These wings have just the right amount of heat. Sweet but with a bite. Made them for a party and everyone raved. Already have requests to make them again.

Great recipe!  I used less cayenne for my own taste but the addition of honey makes an awesome sauce.  My new staple for hot wings!

I thought this recipe was good but I'm going to do things a little differently next time.  The sauce was a little too runny for me so next time I going to add a little corn starch to thinken it up.  Also, I added 3 teaspoons of red pepper and it just wasn't hot enough for me.  I think next time I will add some habenaro.

I fried half and baked the other half.  My son thought they were great! I put less butter in the mixture.  I used the broiler for the last 3-5 minutes after coating.  (I did forget to marinate..) After baking and realizing this, I poured the mixture over the chicken cooked for 10-15 minutes and then broiled.  Still awesome!!!

Great wing recipe! I made these for my superbowl party and they were a huge hit! My cousins boyfriend could not stop eating them! I used drumsticks instead of wings because my store was out if wings, I also baked my chicken but the sauce and chicken was delicious and moist and tender! Wonderful recipe thank you!

I love these wings, the hotness and sweetness go together well for me, as I am a whimp when it comes to hot stuff. I did bake them though due to a lack of a grill. Also made the honey to hot sauce ratio a bit more even. I will always make these.

I usually do not like chicken wings, but this recipe totally changed that!  I've grilled the wings or put them in the oven, and both methods have worked great!  The whole family loves these!

This was absolutely wonderful!!! I could honestly eat chicken wings 7 nights a week-actually have before-and these are one of the best I've had-restaurant quality and then some. I cut the recipe in half because it was just me here and it worked great. I will be making these again soon. Thanks so much for a great recipe! Update 12/28/09 I've made these  too many times to count-it is the best ever-I deep fry my wings and just roll in the sauce. I also bread them in Hooters wing breading and let sit about an hour in the fridge. These are better than any restaurant wings I've ever had! Thanks again for sharing!

I really enjoyed this recipe although I had 2 sub a couple of items, but that's what makes cooking fun. Instead of honey I used brown sugar & sub the hot sauce for with buffalo wing sauce. Everything turned out great.

I love grilling. One word describes this recipie "awesome". I accidentally forgot the black pepper no problem for me but next time I will be sure to put it in. While mixing the sauce tested it and decided to add some brown sugar to sweeten and thicken things up,  Perfect, my new flavorite wings.  Make em ahead of time for the best flavor yet.

Why have I been going out for wings?  I had no idea wings could be awesome without the deep fry!!!  This recipe was full of surprises!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I wasn't sure about the honey in the sauce so I divided it and only used 1/2 the honey in 1/2 the sauce, the other half was a traditional buffalo sauce.  The sweet sauced wings were gone first over the traditional buffalo.  I'll do that again, b/c they were good.  I did find the sauce to be a little too buttery, so next time I will reduce the amount of butter, but still 5 stars as written. (FYI, I used Franks Red Hot for the hot sauce).

WOW!! excellent recipe.... made a 1/2 batch of sauce for a whole cut up chicken.  After grilling I put them in the oven at 325 for 30 minutes and the sauce thickened and I basted the chicken.  THIS IS A KEEPER!! THANKS! (I used Franks red hot, instead of LH sauce- that's what I had in the house)

My husband and I loved this recipe! It has the perfect amount of sweetness and spiciness. Personally I liked it way better than the other wing recipe I tried from this site (Baked Buffalo Wings). Perfect with ranch or blue cheese dressing and celery sticks!

Not very spicy, actually very disappointing. The sauce is very runny, I added cornstarch paste to thicken and it was still too runny to stick to the wings.

As suggested by other reviewers, I used a package of frozen wings and marinated overnight in the sauce.  I did not make extra sauce or toss them in any after grilling.  They were fabulous naked (dipped in ranch or bleu cheese, of course)!

I made these as one of the flavors of wings for our Super Bowl festivities and they turned out really well.  I did back them instead though.  I wish I could have tasted a bit more of the combination of sweet and spicy instead of majority spicy, but all in all really good.  Maybe they really will turn out better grilled.  I'll have to take that route the next time.

I made these for Super Bowl Sunday and they were terrific! Everyone said how much they loved them and they weren't too spicy. I will definitely be making them again!

My family loved these wings! I didn't have time to marinade so I just grilled and tossed the wings right in the pot to coat them. They were delicious. Perfect combo of sweet and spicy!

My husband and I loved these wings!  I added some chipotle hot sauce to the regular kind to give it an added smokiness.  We also baked our wings, since the weather didn't allow for grilling, but we didn't mind - they were demolished.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I tried these awhile ago with little chicken drummies broiled in the oven, and they were very good! They were nice and spicy, but the honey gave it a refreshingly sweet flavor, also. Hence the name I guess, heh. Oh, I also added a little bit of chipotle poweder to make it a little smoky, but I doubt it made too much of a difference. I'm gonna try this recipe again but with larger drummies and maybe done right on the grill, if the weather permits. Thanks for sharing! I'm keeping this one.

This sauce is so amazing everyone was fighting over it. I fried my wings ahead of time and kept them warm, and then had four different sauces for everyone to pick from and coat their own wings. This one won hands down. Next time I will double it.  I didn't  change a thing.   But you could very easily change the hot sauce to your liking. Thanks for a wonderful recipe that I will continue to make.

YUM!!!!!!!!!  I added a little more honey (served these to a friend who's a wimp).  They were great!  Sweet and spicy-great flavor.  The sauce was a little thin, thus my 4 star rating.

This sauce was excellent, I love hot food and really enjoyed the hot and sweet mixture.  We didn't simmer the wings in the sauce, we just bbq'd our wings with salt and pepper and cayanne pepper and then used the sauce as a dip.  The only thing I would change is the amount of butter, I just add it a little bit at a time and do the good old taste test

Woo hoo!  Our friends think we are grill masters when we make this.  I add at least 1/4 cup brown sugar and a little extra honey.  Use the cayenne sparingly or you will drink your cold beer fast!  It's spicy.  We also like to baste the wings with the sauce while they are cooking.  Cook them slow and on low heat so the sauce doesn't burn on the wings if you're basting them.

An excellent recipe! We used just drummettes and marinated them overnight. They do tend to char a bit so be very careful when you grill them. Baking them and basting them with the extra sauce is a must! I agree with the review stating that these wings are the perfect level of spiciness to satisfy everyone! We plan to add more hot sauce next time.

I love the fact that you grill these wings rather than fry.  Didn't even bother separating and tipping wings, just seasoned with a little garlic salt and grilled.  The sauce was perfect for the kids as is, so we coated half of the wings with half the sauce and added more cayenne pepper to taste for the other half....SO GOOD!! THX LISA!!

These are very tasty wings.  I didn't adjust the recipe at all.  What's surprising is that they aren't very spicy, considering you use a whole bottle of hot sauce!  I guess the honey really tones it down.  I love spicy food, so I'd probably prefer making buffalo wings, but I really like that these because they are grilled vs. fried.  I made these wings and buffalo wings for a Monday Night Football game.  The buffalo wings were a bit more popular (due to the spicy factor), but both were good because they were grilled!  I originally made these wings because I had a friend with a 6 year old son and I wasn't sure if he could eat spicy food.  He loved them!

I liked the flavor of this sauce. I did not however liked them baked. I think they would be much better grilled or fried, and will try a different method next ime. These are worth making again though.

Excellent.  Just the right mix of sweet and hot! Quick and easy too.  I accidentally left out the butter (I microwaved it to soften it and left it in there!)  but it was still delicious.  I think I made about 6 dozen wingettes and I got about 4 total.  Oh well, I definitely will make again when we don't have company!  Thanks

These were some of the best wings I've made. I didn't marinate them before grilling and they turned out great. The honey adds a unique twist and mellows the heat. I reduced the cayenne so it wasn't too hot and it was the perfect heat.

Even though there was honey in it, it was still very spicy. I didn't grill it, I baked it and these were ok.  I served these with fries and asparagus for dinner.  Most complained it was too spicy.

I love hot wings and the honey added a nice twist.  I seasoned the wings with the garlic salt and black pepper then baked them (uncovered).  I combined the other ingredients, simmered the sauce for a few minutes, then poured it over the wings when they were done and a little crispy.  They were great!  If you're heat-sensitive, go easy on the cayenne pepper.

Air fried the wings the night before an office pot luck. Reheated in crock pot pour sauce over them and tossing about every 30 minutes on low heat. I liked the sauce not over powering but with a kick a heat. Iâ€™ll be making these again.

Great wing recipe. Hate going out for wings because they are so hit & miss in our area and after making these  we will never go out for wings again.  Love the no mess in kitchen of cooking them on the grill.

This was an awesome wing recipe. I fried our wings instead of grilling.... Because well.... Who needs healthy when you're having wings. Hahaha. The recipe was perfect, except I try to limit salt intake when we can.... So instead of garlic salt we used minced garlic. It was sheer perfection.

I was in the middle of the road on these... I thought they were good-not-great. My wife thought they were great, but I think she says that cause she wants me to spend more time in the kitchen.

I'm only giving this 4* as the sauce was too thin.  I would make again but would try to thicken the sauce a bit so it sticks to the wings.  Or bast the wings with the sauce while on the grill to create a glaze.

Outstanding!! I just grilled the wings, coated the wings in the sauce, and placed them in the oven under broil for a few minutes.

It's a great recipe, and like most here, I use it as a guideline. I add strawberry preserves along with the honey (less honey and sub the preserves) and some Tony Chachere's along w fresh minced garlic to give it my own little spin. The strawberry really works great with it.

Made them in the deep fryer instead of grilling them and the sauce sticks to it very well. I have added A1 sauce to the recipe and people can't stop talking about them.

Made this with 2.5 lbs of chicken and ended up needing to make another batch of sauce just to cover it all. Maybe I converted wrong. Either way, the sauce is delicious. I split my wings and threw them on the BBQ for a five minutes per side, then put them in a baking dish with the sauce and baked them at 400 for around 25-30 minutes. They were some of the best wings I ever had. I used Frank's Xtra Hot sauce. May use regular next time as my girlfriend found it a bit too hot.

This was a good recipe. I was looking for a flavor like the Sweet Heat that I tried at Bonfire Wings restaurant. This was a close match that I can make at home for myself. I prepared the sauce as directed, but I deep fried the wing seasoned without breading. I also add crushed red pepper to the sauce (Bonfire inspired). I might try a different kind of hot sauce next time. My end product was pretty good.

It is the easiest buffalo sauce I've tried. Hubby declared my other buffalo sauce recipe is better and he prefers his buffalo sauce unsweetened. I did not think this was sweet and spicy at all. It was buffalo sauce-with honey. Weird but I shoulda figured that out before making it. Oh well, he ate it. After all it was mostly fried wings with some sauce on it and how can that ever be bad enough to not eat???

These are MUCH better if they are slow simmered in the sauce the next day for about 30 minutes....fall off the bone tender!  Absolutely addictive!

These were great! My husband and I loved the flavor. Will definitely make these again. I substituted with Texas Pete hot sauce and crushed red chile peppers; since no Louisiana sauce or cayenne pepper.

This sauce is out of this world good !!!!!!  I put it on boneless chicen wings after I deep fried them in my fryer.  The only change I made was I used "Franks RedHot Buffalo Wing Sauce" about 10 dashes of red pepper flakes and just a touch more honey than the recipe calls for except for this Ifollowed the recipe exactly as written.  You have to try this amazing sauce on your chicken wings or grilled chicken its out of this world good !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  THANKS FOR SHARING !!!!!!!!!!!

The sauce is AWESOME. It was just what I was looking for. I did try a couple more things. One batch I added 1/2 cup of orange marmalade. I also breaded the wings with flour, egg wash and Panko (in that order). Baking then keeping in a crock made it perfect for a later appetizer.

Not so much sweet but it does have a spicy kick to it.  My 11 yrs. old said too spicy for her.  Easy, fast, I will make again and have with blue cheese or ranch.

This was the first meal I made from this site and can tell you that this was EXCELLENT!!!!  It was very easy to make.  I did not have a grill and had to bake the chicken wings, but the meal was still DELICIOUS!!!! I do caution that this meal should not be made for children.  My 10 year-old liked it but it was a little too spicy for her.  Next time I make it I will make a separate batch for her with less hot sauce.  Maybe a 1/2 cup for her vs.  the 1 1/2 cup the recipe calls for.  But again, this was EXCELLENT and I will definitely be making it again.

I LOVE WINGS SO I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS, BUT WAS SOOOOO DISAPPOINTED. THE SAUCE DID NOT STICK TO THE WINGS AT ALL. FROM NOW ON I WILL JUST GET WINGS FROM A LOCAL PIZZA PLACE AND SAVE ALOT OF TIME.

Very easy and very good.  I would go light on the hot sauce unless you want to sweat profusively.  I used half the amount called for and my family already complained that it was too hot.

my husband and i loved these. first time ever making chicken wings. he's not a big fan of sweet and sour, so these were perfect. Followed some of the previous advice, and we gobbled 'em down.
