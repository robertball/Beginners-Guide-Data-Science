Rich and tasty!  I was more surprised about the brown sugar taste than the cayenne pepper taste! Interesting flavor combination.

Ehhhh, I wouldn't make these again unless I did some sort of icing.  And I might increase the hot stuff.  They were very chocolatey, but not paricularly interesting after the first bite.

So delicious.

can be cut in half if you don't have enough ingredients (someone ate half the chocolate before time to cook & didn't alert you?...)
