Okay, here's what you need to do to perfect this recipe.... Add 1 teaspoon orange extract to the cake mix and cut the oil down to 3/4 cup. Other than those couple of things, follow the rest exactly and trust me, you will not be disappointed! I made two of these for a luncheon of 40 ladies and it was a huge hit. Several women asked me for the recipe and I was almost embarassed to let them know how easy it was! The topping is heavenly and could be used for lots of different things... maybe a big dollup on a slice of angel food cake or pound cake??? Yummy! Thanks for this wonderful recipe; I will be making it again and again!

This showpiece cake has been a favorite for more than 25 years! It makes for a particularly perfect cake for spring or summer get togethers. The way I make it varies only a bit, but may be enough of a difference to be helpful. I use a 15-1/2 oz. can of pineapple, or the equivalent if that size can is not availabe, and I combine it with the pudding mix before folding in the whipped topping. I bake this in 3 9-inch layer cake pans (layers will be thin) for 20-25 minutes, and spread the frosting between the layers and on top and sides of the cake.  This makes for a very impressive presentation. Absolutely delicious, refreshing, and beautiful cake, great for birthdays!

I made this cake with Betty Crocker Super Moist butter yellow cake and I got awesome response.  My sister who never asks for a recipe asked for this one.  The only difference was instead of beating all the topping ingredients together I mixed the pudding and the pineapple together and completely folded in the Cool Whip so it didn't break down.  Put in fridge for 3 hours before serving.  Keep refrigerated and it is good for 3 days easy.  Awesome cake.  Plan on using often.  One thing that gets me is some folks completely change the ingredients or pan size and complain that it's not awesome like those of us who follow the recipe.

I make this cake every Sunday for our pool party.  Everyone LOVES it!  I use only 3 eggs, 1/2 cup oil, and TWO cans of oranges.  Sometimes I even add coconut to the whipped cream to make it more tropical! Also, I reserve 18 orange segments to arrange on the top of the cake to resemble suns and call it "Sunshine Cake". :)

Edited due to smaller cake mixes. The Duncan Heinz website has a recipe for a cake mix extender. Cake mixes are now 15.25-16.25 ozs instead of 18.25 ozs. Rather than make 2 separate mixtures and mixing them together like the recipe states, I mix all dry ingredients together, then the wet and follow the cake mix recipe. My oranges come in a 20 oz can, rather than 11 ozs. I use all the oranges and pour out a little of the juice and it's just fine. I mix in the oil and eggs, then lightly mix in the oranges. I like a few chunks of orange in my cake. I mix the pineapple and dry pudding together and let it sit for a few minutes to thicken a bit. Then I gently fold in the cool whip, frost the cooled cake and chill for a few hours before serving. A lot of the cake mix recipes online have baking times for the larger mixes so it all works out, just test cake to be sure it's done. I adjust flavorings for the recipe, such as adding a tablespoon cocoa powder for chocolate cakes, or an extra 1/4 teaspoon orange or coconut extracts, etc, depending on what kind of cake I'm making. Duncan Heinz makes an Orange cake that I prefer over the Yellow cake. I like making 9" layer cakes and using the extender makes for a taller, prettier cake. Thank you Ellen!

YUMMMM!!!  I made a few changes tho.  I made a Duncan Hines Moist Deluxe Yellow Cake, forgot to add the oranges to it, but made it a bundt style cake.  I used a 20oz can of crushed pineapple (with juice) and 1/2 of a 10 oz can of mandarin, whipped it up in the blender.  I poured that into a bowl and added vanilla pudding mix.  Then I took someone elses advice and added the cool whip after everything else was mixed.  (that mixture in itself is delicious!) Then, using a rubber spatula, started at the top of the bundt and spread the frosting all around in swooshy patterns.  I took the remainder of mandarin oranges and spread them around the top.  Then sprinkled about 2 cups of coconut all over everything.  Not only did it look pretty, but the taste was outstanding!  I would do it again this way in a heartbeat!

I've been making this for a long time under the name of "sunshine cake" or "pig lickin cake" I have a gal at work that asks for it every year for her birthday. She asks that I make it low cal/low fat for her. I use applesauce for the oil, egg beaters rather than whole eggs, fat free cool whip and sugar free pudding. She just loves it.

This is a great cake for spring/summer occasions but I made this for my husband's birthday with a few variations.  I made this using 2 9 inch cake pans (greased and floured).  For the middle layer spread a thin layer of orange marmalade and brush with pineapple juice (saved from the can you will use for the frosting. I used the drained pineapple for the frosting because the juice makes the frosting consistency too thin for my liking), repeat this on the top layer if desired.  For the frosting used drained pineapple, 12 ounces of cool whip topping and the pudding.  Fill and spread over entire cake, then add some chopped nuts (any kind) on the top for a really decorative touch.  For best results, cover and put in the fridge overnight before serving.  5 spoons up!!!

Made just like the recipe stated, however used two 9 inch rounds and placed topping in center. There was PLENTY of topping for the cake! For a teacher event I will dress it up a bit on the outside with toasted coconut. I like the idea of using the orange cake mix next time. I had a hard time finding just yellow! Made for two events and they were both a HIT! Love this recipe. It's easy and Yummy! We are not cake lovers here, but his is a hit!

This cake was a hit! I made a double layer with 2 round cake pans adding some topping/frosting in between the layers. I also added coconut to the sides of the cake. Delish!

I have been making this cake for the last 6 years now. My bf shared his recipe with me. We use 1 box of DH yellow cake mix, 3 eggs, 1 stick of butter, 1 (11 0z) can of mandarin oranges with juice and 1 tsp vanilla as the cake batter. Mix well with a blender. Pour into 2 9'' greased cake pans. For the topping We use 1 Large tub and 1 smaller tub of Cool Whip, 1 Large box instant vanilla pudding mix, 1 Tsp vanilla, and 1 (20oz) can crushed pineapple without the juice. We reserve the juice and add a few tablespooons as needed for the topping. I just stir all the topping ingrediends with a large spoon. Let is set up for about 10 minutes prior to frosting the cake. It turns out very moist, flavorful, and light everytime! If you have not tried this cake yet then we highly recommend it! Enjoy!

This cake is so very good!  I added an extra can of oranges (minus the juice) and some vanilla to the cake batter and used fresh whipped cream, rather than cool whip. I mixed the pineapple with the pudding mix and then stirred that into the fresh whipped cream.  The topping came out super thick, rich, and delicious (and yes I used the juice from the can of crushed pineapple).  Super moist cake.  Simply yummy :)

So amazing! Maded this for Mother's Day and everyone loved it. Even my brother who doesn't like sweets ate 2 slices! I added 1 extra can of mandarin oranges, drained, a splash of vanilla, and a splash of orange extract to the batter. I also drained the pineapple and mixed it with the pudding, then added the juice back until I liked the texture. Best cake I've had!

Very good.  I made some adjustments to the cake mix: 1 t orange extract, 3/4 oil & 3 eggs.  It came out very moist.  For the topping I blended together the pineapple and pudding before folding in the Cool Whip.  I refrigerated over night before serving.

This turned out great!  In order to get a little more of an orangy flavor, I drained the mandarin juice, and replaced it w/ pure orange juice.  Very very good, will keep this recipe.  It will make a great summer recipe!  (or winter if you too are from so. Cal)

My late grandmother made a recipe similar to this that our family still loves to this day (in fact, I introduced my hubby to it & he has declared it his new favorite cake!)

To make the moistest cake ever... Combine 1 box yellow cake mix, 4 eggs, 1 cup oil, 1 package instant vanilla pudding & juice from 2 small cans of mandarin.  Bake in 2 round pans, so you can slice those with thread to make 4 layers.  It's beautiful!

Icing: Mix with a blender...1 large Cool Whip, 1 pack of instant vanilla pudding, 1 can pineapple with juice & 2 cans of mandarin (juice has already been used for cake batter...reserve a few for decorations).

Ice this baby up & store in fridge until ready to serve.  It will be the moistest thing you've ever eaten!!  Delicious!!

I made this today, and it was awesome apart from one thing:  There's definitely too much oil in the recipe.  I'll follow the advice of the other commenters next time and cut the oil back to 3/4 cup.

EDIT:  I've changed my mind about my original review -- there ins't too much oil, I just don't like the taste of it!  I hadn't used oil in a cake recipe in so long that I'd forgotten I don't like its flavor.  I substituted butter the second time around and it came out much better.  After switching to butter, I'm giving this recipe its fifth star.  ;)

I've been making this wonderful cake for many years.  I refrigerate mine and I always make the cake the day before serving.  The colder, the better.

This is the BOMB! I make it in a Bundt pan, add a tablespoon of orange zest, Grand Marnier instead of juice and real whipped cream instead of topping...blows the guests in my restaurant away!

Based on previous reviews, I used orange cake mix instead of the yellow!  It was fabulous!  No leftovers with this cake.  I plan to try pineapple cake mix next time.  It was hard to stay out of the yummy topping!  I find this to be a great summer cake; light, moist, chilled and topped with fluffy frosting!  Thank you Ellen for sharing!

I have made this cake many times - it is not necessary to use this much oil. You can easily cut it to 1/2 cup and you can also eliminate one egg without a noticeable difference!

I have used both orange and yellow cake mixes on this recipe. I like yellow better.  If you're wanting to make a layer cake out of this, 20 oz of pineapple is a bit too much.  It won't be thick enough to spread on the sides.  Either add a bit more pudding mix or cut back on the pineapple/juice. Sometimes I use coconut cream pudding in place of the vanilla and put toasted coconut on the top.   I don't think the whole cup of oil is necessary if you're wanting to cut back.  I usually use somewhere around 1/2 cup.

This was pretty good, next time I will add the juice from the mandarin oranges, mix, then fold in the pieces. Mixing them in at the same time incorporates it into the batter, and you can't taste it. Also mix the pudding into the pineapple before adding it to the whipped topping. I made fresh sweetened whipped cream and used that instead of the frozen whipped topping.

We really enjoyed this cake! The cake is moist and the frosting is a nice change from the traditional frosting. It's definitely a keeper.

Excellent, excellent, excellent.  I did follow reviewer's suggestions and used 2/3 cup oil and 1/2 tsp. orange extract.  This cake is so moist,so light and so delicious I will be making it often.  Thanks Ellen.

IF THIS RECIPE HAD A SIX STAR CATEGORY THAT'S WHAT IT WOULD GET FROM ME.  IT WAS ABSOLUTELY SCRUMPTOUS.  MADE IT FOR MY GRANDSON'S 9TH BIRTHDAY AND EVERYBODY JUST RAVED OVER IT.  THE ICING WAS OUT OF THIS WORLD.  WILL DEFINITELY MAKE THIS ONE AGAIN.  THANKS MUCH.

This cake was fine.  It was very moist, but you couldn't really taste the oranges very much.  I probably won't make it again, although, my husband did like it.  It was quick and easy...this bumped it from 3 to 4 stars.

I'm so glad to find this recipe again.  I used to make it years and years ago and it was always a HUGE hit!  I agree with the others to reduce the oil to at least 3/4 cup or more and perhaps make up the difference with orange juice.

This cake was absolutely wonderful, especially on a warm day.  I did reduce the eggs to only 3 and reduced the amount of oil to about 2/3 or 3/4 of a cup ( i added in a little water to make up for this) and it still turned out wonderful!! ( except a little lower in fat and cholesterol)  Thanks so much for such a wonderful recipe!!

This cake was easy to put together,just happened to have all ingredients on hand. This is one cake you can make at the last minute.  First time I frosted it as instructed, next time put the frosting on each individual piece.  Last time didn't use the frosting at all.The cake on it's own is very moist and really doesn't need the gooey frosting, altho' the frosting is good! Next time will drizzle with a thin powdered sugar and orange juice mix.    This will be good for summertime potluck.  My rating five stars!

Used light mandarin oranges in JUICE (not syrup), use fat free topping, fat free-sugar free pudding. Best served chilled. Light flavor

This is such a refreshing change from heavy, chocolate desserts. I love it!! Made it exactly as written, but added orange extract to the cake batter. I also didn't use the entire tub of whipped topping. Topped it immediately before taking to a potluck. Wish I would have topped it sooner, the topping sets up nicely, and the leftovers were better after it had chilled and set up some. Wonderful cake and I will make it again!!

So fresh and delicious! I made it as written the first time and it was very good. But on my second cake, I reduced the oil to 3/4 cup, added a tsp. of orange extract and a bit of orange zest and it was much better! On my third try I eliminated the oil all together and added 1 cup of apple sauce instead. Super yummy and a lot healthier as a bonus (plus less calories - a HUGE bonus!). The apple sauce fits right in with the fruity quality of this cake and makes it super moist too. So I've made it three different ways now and it was excellent in its own way each time. (Oh, and I don't use Cool Whip for the frosting - can't stand the taste - just a personal preference - so I use real whipped cream or Dream Whip.)

This is my favorite cake. As someone who doesn't care too much for sweets, I could eat the topping all by itself! And this cake is very easy to make.

I have made this cake in the past and it is fabulous!  Even as a borderline chocoholic, I requested THIS for my wedding cake.  It is moist and tender and fluffy and you just have to try it.   A word of caution, though.  You must use restraint before shoveling in too much and ruining the experience.

All I can say is AWESOME ! I decorated with mint leaves, macadamia nuts and mint leaves... I took the advice from a couple of people here ... Didnt use the pineapple juice in the frosting which made it more thicker. and I spread a thin layer of Orange Marmalade in the center before icing and sprinkled a few nuts on the inside as well ... I would have added a bit of coconut but the person I made it for does not like it ... Next time I will add a bit to the top ... 5 star rating for sure

Kinda disappointed in this cake.  The topping was wonderful, however; the cake had no orange flavor whatsoever!  It was very moist, but didn't taste any different than your regular boxed yellow cake.  Next time I will try adding some orange extract.

I made this cake for my dad's birthday and it was a total hit!  So moist, and yummy!  I did use a Duncan Hines butter recipe cake mix and used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup applesauce instead of the 1 cup of vegetable oil.  I also used the zest of an orange in the cake batter and some of the juice of that orange for an added pop of flavor.  When making the topping, I mixed the pudding mix with the pineapple juice which I had strained to avoid having a lumpy topping.

Wow!  What a yummy, easy cake.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try making a box cake taste like something unique.  It was moist and the topping wasn't sugary sweet like other frostings.  I can see this recipe expanded, just by using different cake mixes, fruit or pudding!  Yum!

Mmmm, love this cake!  I modified somewhat to use what I had on hand. I made it into a 3-layer cake using Betty Crocker Golden Vanilla cake mix and 3 jumbo eggs, and it turned out great.  I am sharing my pic of it. Pretty cake and delicious, you can't beat that!!

I'm giving two stars because I followed the recipe exactly and the topping is entirely runny. I don't know why?! Tastes good but looks nothing like the picture (where the topping stays on the cake).

The best cake I've ever made!  I made the following changes based on the other reviews:  1) I used only 3 eggs, and 2) I drained the juice from the pineapple, and just mixed the frosting ingredients lightly with a spoon, not beat them.  It was the perfect consistency that way.  I liked this cake because it was nice and light (I used Betty Crocker Super Moist Yellow for the mix)...doesn't really have much orange flavor, though.  Next time I might add orange extract or orange juice.

Concept of this cake (light & refreshing) is so good!  However mandarin oranges are so mild as to impart virtually no appreciable flavor & pineapple is kind of overpowering to me.  So, I made a few changes to the author’s wonderful recipe and it worked out well:  I omitted the pineapple & mandarin oranges & instead I used frozen mango that I thawed, diced and drained well. Shockingly, frozen mango tastes nearly a good as fresh (plus no need to peel or seed!).  I saved the drained mango juice and folded most of it in the cool whip/pudding mixture a little at a time – you don’t want the icing to become runny. It gave it a nice tint of color and added a hint of flavor. As other reviewers suggested, I reduced oil to 3/4 cup and used 1/4 cup OJ. I added zest from one orange to the cake mix and as it baked it smelled soooo good!      Another change I made was that after the cake baked/cooled, I brushed each layer with cooled orange syrup made of 3 Tablespoons OJ, 3 Tablespoons granulated sugar, and 3 Tablespoons Triple Sec (bring sugar and OJ to boil & stir 1 minute, remove from heat then add Triple Sec & cool – use for both layers). YUM and it made it moist. I did garnish the center of the cake with a few mandarin orange slices to resemble a sunburst.  I took the cake to a dinner party and the people who politely said they'd have “a bite or two” ended up scraping their plates and asking for more!  As my teenager would say, “Owned ‘em!”

I would prefer the icing without the crushed pinapple, perhaps with just mandarin orange slices instead, because my cake was super moist and the icing was more like pudding.  Still tasted very good, kind of like trifle and ambroisia.  Didn't use any oil- substituted apple sauce for all of it.  Yummy!

WAIT!!! Read all reviews before making this cake. I had heard how great it was so decided to take it to my family reunion.
The problem is that the recipe is not up to date. Cake mixes are smaller now so the one I bought "Duncan Hines:" was only 15.2 OZ. I should have realized this and adjusted the oil and eggs, but I was rushed. THIS IS TOO MUCH OIL for today's cake mixes. The result is a cake that is too heavy and it tastes oily.  I should have conferred with other recipes on other websites because  most of them have 1/2 C oil, not one full cup of oil. I think this would have improved the cake a lot. All Recipes should update this recipe so that other people do not make the same mistake. It is a five star cake and very popular, but it does not work out well with current cake box packages.

Great cake!  Made it with an orange cake mix and a little less oil. It was a hit.  Will make this again.

This is good, what's not to like about cake and a yummy topping?  But my problem with this cake, thus the reason for 4 stars, is that it doesn't have an orange flavor.  I replaced the mandarin orange liquid,  with straight orange juice and added 2 teas. of orange extract, and I still couldn't taste an orange flavor.  I might as well of saved myself some money and omitted the mandarin oranges and extract, and just made the cake mix as is.  I reduced oil to 1/2 cup.  It tastes great, but that is because the topping is so good.  Also, the topping isn't thick, so if you want a thicker icing, I would drain some of the liquid from the pineapple.

I got this recipe from my aunt about 20 years ago. She called it "Summer Cake". One bite and I think you will agree it tastes like summer on a plate. Light and cool, What could be better?

Wow this was great.  Ok, so I made a bunch of changes like I reduced the oil to 2/3 cup, added 2/3 cup of orange juice instead of the mandarin orange syrup, and I changed the vanilla pudding to lemon pudding but it was WONDERFUL.  My husband who isn't a big 'frosting' guy LOVED it.  It's definitely a keeper recipe.  Thank you Ellen.

Delicious! Have made this several times, and it's become a family favorite!  I've even made a sugar-free version using mandarin oranges in their own juice, sugar-free Pillsbury yellow cake mix, sugar-free instant vanilla pudding and sugar-free Cool Whip. Just as good as the original!

Wonderful recipe and loved by all that tried it today!  I used a Duncan Hines Pineapple Supreme cake instead of a yellow cake and a cup of orange-pineapple yogurt instead of the oil.  The cake came out denser and extremely moist.  This one is a keeper!

This cake was great! With the topping however, with the comments about it being messy, I did not use the pineapple and instead used more mandarins. I used about a quarter of the juice from the can, a few oranges and added that to the whip cream and dry pudding mix. It turned out fantastic,not messy at all, and i sprinkled the remaining orange segmets (minus the juice) on top of the cake.

Excellent, Tasty and Easy Recipe.  I reduced the oil in the cake to 3/4 cup and added 1 tsp. orange extract. I also substituted instant lemon pudding for the vanilla (my husbands suggestion),and fat free whipped topping.  It turned out perfect, everyone loved it and was definitely bursting with flavor.  I will make this again :-)

Try this variation! Here's the whole recipe: use 3 eggs, 
1 c applesauce (instead of oil), 
low fat pudding mix, 
white cake mix, 
2 mangoes instead of pineapple, 
15 oz can of peaches instead of oranges,
low fat cool whip......3425 calories for the entire cake (285 per 12 servings).  I just made the original version 5 days ago and wanted to try it again with the ingredients I already had.  Both were 5/5!!

Loved it! 
Followed others suggestions and used orange cake mix, and substituted OJ for mandarin syrup. And reduced oil to 2/3 plus 1/3 OJ. At the risk of OJ Overdose, I also zested one entire orange and added it to the cake mix. 

For frosting, I drained the pineapple as suggested, but the pudding had nothing to set with - was powdery.  I had to mix some liquid with the pudding for the frosting- the cool whip and Drained pineapple was not enough.
I added back in about 1/2-3/4 c of pineapple juice. Made 3 layer cake, and used orange marmalade between layers. 
It was great!
Brought it to work, and everyone ate it by noon.Will make it again, likely before the week is out:)

Oh my, this cake was AMAZING. My guests raved over it, and everyone had seconds and even thirds! It was incredibly quick and easy, too. So moist, flavorful...yet very light.  Not heavy and overwhelmingly rich like most cake recipes around. The icing was a big hit too, silky and not too sweet. The only thing I changed about the recipe was to sprinkle shredded coconut over the icing. Great for presentation and it enhanced the subtle fruitiness of the cake.

~Wow this is an excellent cake! I did a couple things different, instead of adding the syrup/juice from the can of mandarins I substituted orange juice with a tsp of orange peel. I think it was about 1/2C OJ. 
~I was so afraid this recipe would be so incredibly moist it would fall apart but it didn't.
~I liked the cake the best and really wanted something just orange. But with all the reviews about the frosting I had to make it. If I were serving it to guests I would add it! But I just wanted orange cake. YUM! 
~Will be staying in my recipe box!

This was made and brought to my work. It was a great hit.  I find that it got better over night. So it is agreat "make ahead" cake.  Also, I spinkled the top with coconut and pecans, this added a nice flavor and texture.
Thank you for a keeper

I have made this cake so many times. I met this lady in the resale store and we talked about baking. I mentioned this cake and she ask me to make her one. She paid me $20 for a 13x9x2 inch cake. Three days later she ordered another cake ,except she wanted it to be double the 13x9x2 pan. She paid me $40. She has ordered over 7 of this cake. My neighbor's mom died last week and I made her a super large Mandarin Orange Cake for the dinner. Her family came and told me how great this cake was. She ordered a 13x9x2   Mandarin cake for New Years eve. I added mandarin oranges and ripe canned mangoes to the batter with a squirt of lemon extract. For the frosting, I used banana instant pudding for a new taste. After I frost the cake, I put pineapple rings around the cake. It was beautiful. I also used 12 oz. cool whipped topping. I know that I will be making more of this cake. My neighbor and the lady I met at the resale store said that this cake reminded them of Tres Leches cake. This cake is like Tony the Tiger Great!

The is best made as 3 layer cake. Change up in cake ingred. 1 stick of butter and 1/2 cup oil for cake. Frosting 3 1/2 instant van. pudding, 1/2 c. powdered sugar, 1 can crushed pineapple with juice. Mix. Let set a few min. Fold in cool whip and coconut. Spread on layers, then whole cake, refrig.  The frosting soaks a bit into the layers and I promise people will rave! Ellen's version should be good too and takes less time. But the three layers makes such a pretty cake.

Okay, so my stomach kinda turned as I was pouring in a whole cup of oil, but it really made it moist.  I added about a cup or so of orange juice too, but the crushed pineapple and whipped cream overpower the orange flavor.  Nonetheless, the cake was really good.  This one's a keeper.

Easy to make and very tasty!  I have taken this cake to several potlucks and it doesn't last long!  It might could use some more orange extract to be a little more orangy flavored - but it is very good the way it is here!

Very tasty and moist cake.  I only had a French Vanilla cake mix so I added a bit of orange extract as another review suggested.  I also used 3/4 cup of canola oil.  The frosting is the best part, and I used sf/ff pudding mix.  Very good cake and very easy to make.

I made this a few years ago, and my brother loved it so much that he used to make it on a regular (weekly/biweekly) basis! Everyone in my family loves this; this is the only cake I can say I love eating.  My Dad saw me baking his Father's Day cake, which WASN'T this one, and said "That cake your brother makes is really good..that orange one." Well I couldn't start over and now I know just to make this one always.  It's moist but not too sweet, and the topping makes is soo good.  The topping is even better than other whipped toppings that include cream cheese.  If you're looking for a fruity cake, THIS IS IT.  My brother, the Mandarin Orange Cake Lover, recently became a father so I baked him this cake without using the box mix--big mistake! Follow the recipes as is and it will be great. My family is very picky but this one is a favorite.

So this was pretty good, but I did drain the syrup that the oranges came in and subbed 1/3 cup orange juice to liven up the orange flavor.  I also only used half of the 20 oz. can of pineapple, because I thought it would be too much.  I was right--half the can was perfect for my tastes.  This was SUPER moist!  Everyone commented on how moist it was, and it may have been the most moist cake I've ever eaten.  Thanks, Ellen.

I've made this cake numerous times and the best responses I received from guests was when I: -added one less egg -used 1 cup of apple sauce instead of oil -used 1/3 less fat whip cream. Try it and you'll love it even more!

DELISH! SiMPLE to make and was a hit at the baby shower! I used two 9 in round cake pans and reduced the cook time a bit. Put some of the filling between the layers and chilled overnight.... perfect spring time cake! very refreshing

I wanted to make cupcakes for my little guy to take to daycare for his 2nd birthday. He loves mandarin oranges and pineapple so I decided to try this recipe. Yum! I made a couple slight changes. I used D.H. Pineapple Supreme cake mix which I would recommend. I also ran out of oil so I ended up using 1/2c oil and 1/2c applesauce, which worked out fine. Next time I will try all applesauce to cut down on the fat.  I also followed the suggestions of other reviewers and mixed the pudding mix with the pineapple and let it sit for a minute before folding it into the whipped cream.  Cooking time for the cupcakes turned out to be 22-24 min. at 350.  I will definitely be making this again.

It's good if you want a regular cake. But I was looking for orange flavor and it was lost in this cake. Even when a bite included an orange slice, there wasn't much orange flavor. Maybe some orange zest or flavoring would help as other reviewers suggested. But as-is, I won't make this one again.

Okay, DO NOT use an orange cake mix with this!  It gives it an awful fake orange taste, like baby Tylenol.  Take it from someone who tried!  Yuck.  I drain my pineapple in a sieve to get a lot of the juice out.  It makes the frosting too runny, in my opinion.  I also sometimes substitute applesauce for the oil.  It makes it taste even better, and it's healthier!  Anyway, try this cake!  Everyone who's tried it loves it.  It will be a hit!

HOLY COW!!! This is one dee-lish-us cake! I made this exactly per the recipe (well, except I used coconut cream pudding for the topping cuz it's all I had) and it came out sooo yummy that we all had a second piece right after finishing the first. I am not a highly-skilled baker, normally, but this one made me look like a pro! Next to Sam's Famous Carrot Cake, this is definitely the BEST cake I've ever made (and eaten, too). It came out light and super moist and I love the topping, too. I think the orange flavor is just right--I wasn't looking for something over-poweringly orange, anyway, and the coconut cream pudding was the perfect combo for the topping. Thanks, Ellen :-)

this is like a cheap version of the million dollar cake... and you can taste the difference.  for someone who has never had the million dollar cake, this cake is "deliCIOUS," as someone told me when i served it (and he took half of the cake).  but when you've already tried the competitor, you'll know this cake can't be a replacement.

So Yummy!  We made this twice, not sure what happened to the first one, but the middle sunk and it pulled away from the sides, think the oven was too hot.

Second try was magic.  We also used only 3/4 cup oil and 3 eggs and had everyone raving and requesting the recipe.  So moist and light.

My boyfriend and I loved this cake!  It is perfect for summer.  Like others, I made a few changes like a tsp. of orange extract, only 3/4 c. oil, and only 3 eggs.  His first comment was how moist the cake was!  I cooked it in 8" rounds for about 30 minutes at 350.  Thanks for the great cake!

My mother gave me this recipe,a nd i thought it was a bit too heavy. I use white cake mix, 3 eggs,and 3/4 cups of oil and my cake rises twice as much as my moms. It is still moist and delicious and slightly healthier. I found that these are great for cookouts if you freeze it ahead of time . by the time you get to the dessert it will stil be cool. I have NEVER brought any home.

I was served this cake a few weeks ago by a co-worker. I couldn't believe the topping was so good,as I don't really care for icing. I loved it. I now just finished making it for a dinner I am planning for my husband and adult chilren tomorrow along with my 2 year old grandson. I am so sure that everyone will like it & I will copy the receipe for them. 
My co-worker added only 3 eggs as I did but like I said it was the BEST cake I have eaten for along time.
I give this cake a 5 star.
Thanks.

Everyone loves this cake.  Whenever I have some kind of work party my co-workers always ask for this dessert.  But most of the time I do not use as much oil.  I usually follow the cake box directions and add all the extra ingredients from this recipe.

This is absolutely wonderful!! It's actually easy to make too! I didn't change a thing and it came out great, my husband is still talking about it! The only thing that the recipe doesn't mention is that it needs to be kept refrigerated after it is prepared! I will make this again and again, actually I am not a big fan of cake but I loved this one!

I made this for a work birthday party and they demolished it.  Very good, only thing I did different was I used an Orange cake instead of the yellow, however I am going to try it with the yellow this weekend.

No matter where I go -- this recipe brings on rave reviews. I also serve the vanilla pudding/pineapple and whipped topping as a desert. I am ALWAYS asked to bring it again. I use low fat pudding, and no fat cool whip which makes the pineapple/pudding/whipped topping desert low fat and low calorie.

Wonderful cake.  I use mandarin oranges in the icing instead of pineapple.
Thanks for the recipe!

This is a very good and easy cake to prepare.  I make mine using (2) 9-inch pans.  I also only use 1/2 cup of vegetable oil in cake recipe itself.  Bake for only 25-30 minutes.  Use toothpick to test.

YUM! I made this cake for my husband's
birthday dinner, it was a hit! Completely
gone! This recipe is a keeper & will be a great cake for summer. Only change was 1/2 cup oil, otherwise perfect! A drop of orange food coloring makes it a little more festive!

I chose this reciped because I didn't have orange zest so this recipes totally fit.  I used 1 package of lemon pie filling, 4 egg white, 2/3 cup of oil and 1/3 cup of orange juice. The rest of recipe was the same. I baked in 2-8 inch cake pan. It took 55 minute for me. They turned out so terrific, moist and super-duper delicious. Will make again for party!

I love this cake! (also known as Pig-Pickin' Cake!) It is delicious...when I made mine, I accidentally bought lemon mix instead of yellow mix. It still turned out delicious. Its really fun to think of all the combinations that can be made with this recipe! (Try lemon pudding or pistachio pudding instead of vanilla...etc!)I wish that I could taste the madarin oranges but I can't...it okay, though b/c the cake is great no matter what! Next time, I may use half  pineapple and half mandarins in the icing? I'll let you know how that one works out!

**Make sure you keep the cake refridgerated...its great year round, I'm sure, but especially on a hot summer's day!!**

**Another hint: Try draining the pineapple juice and use only about 2/3 to 3/4 of it in the icing to keep it from getting runny...ESPECIALLY if you use fat free or light whipped topping!!**

I have made this cake many times. It is really light and delicious.I like to use low cal cool whip and sugar free pudding mix in the topping. I have also substituted the vanilla pudding for pistaschio for a cool, light green tint to the topping. Be sure and cool completely before covering with the cool whip topping. I also server it cold, right from the refridgerator.Always put it back in the fridge to keep it cool and it just gets better every day!

I made this yesterday for my Mom's birthday.  This was the third year I've made her an orange cake, and I finally found one that I liked!  This recipe was definitely quick, easy, and delicious.  Everyone really enjoyed it.  The only thing I did differently was cut the oil down to 3/4 c.  I personally was not crazy about the icing. I thought it had a strange texture with the little pieces of pineapple in it.  Everyone else liked it though.  I will definitely make this cake again, but I'm going to try it without the crushed pineapple in the icing.

I made this last night after work - very easy - and it was delicious - very moist.  I made it a two layer round cake as there was plenty of cake batter and frosting.  I didn't think the frosting would be good but it was perfect with the cake.  Would definitely make it again; I might try it with a more mandarin oranges in the batter and in addtion to the pineapple in the frosting.  Thanks for a great recipe.

In spite of how easy this recipe is, this cake is excellent.  The frosting is my favorite part.  My husband and everyone I've served this to has loved it.  I like to spruce it up with various fresh fruit slices for decoration.

My family says this cake is totally awesome.  It has become a family favorite.  It's light, refreshing and really easy to make.  Thanks for a great recipe Ellen.  I think next time I will try making it a layered round cake since I had extra frosting and it may make it look prettier.

Family loved it and declared it is a keeper!  Made cake as directed.  I changed out the frozen whipped topping with real whipped cream and added some orange zest (no one likes the frozen stuff) mixed the pudding mix and crushed pineapple as suggested and then folded in the whipped cream.  Spread on cake and then topped with toasted coconut and drained mandarin oranges.

This was a very easy and tasty cake.  I did use the cake extender recipe with it.  I put all the dry ingredients together than added the wet.  I took out the water due to the juice from the oranges.  I used 3/4 c oil and did add 1 tsp of orange extract.  For the frosting I drained the pineapple and only added a 1/4 of the juice back into the frosting mix.  The cake is super moist and good.  I think the orange is a bit weak so I am going to try the orange cake mix next time.  Thanks for a great recipe for a new change of pace.

The only change I made was that I didn't use all the frosting.  It made a delicious pudding.  It would be a great dollop on  a pound cake or angel food cake.
The cake was WONDERFUL!  Friends who asked about it couldn't believe how easy it was.  I'll make it again.

So my friend made this cake as the dessert for a dinner I was having. We all agreed that it tasted like a white cake with pineapple frosting. Not one bit of orange flavor. It wasn’t bad, it just wasn’t what we expected. I don’t get the name...at the least it should be called Mandarin Pineapple Cake because the pineapple is very pronounced. We decided to see if we could make this cake better and we did. We tried a couple of different versions. One with an Orange Cake mix and one with a butter yellow.  They were both good. We added fresh orange zest to the yellow cake and the juice from the orange instead of the juice from the canned mandarins. We also did away with the Cool Whip and used real whipped cream with some orange zest in that too along with a little less well drained pineapple. What a difference! It had a delicious fresh orange flavor and the real cream was 1000 times better than the artificial tasting CW. It’s now something I make quite often.

This cake wasn't for us.  My family iloves sweets but they didn't eat more than one slice. First of all, the flavor wasn't fresh, because of the canned pineapple. Also, it was too oily, the cake mix  was actually weighed down with it and all the eggs,  and even though I used mandarins in their  own juice(not syrup) it was still way too sweet. I also used real whipped cream in place of whipped topping, which was nice, but unfortunately it wasn't enough "realness" to save the flavor for me. 
Last,  if I made this again, I'd omit the pineapple. Pineapple orange is a totally different flavor from a nice, light cake where the orange flavor is alllowd to come through.  I won't make again.

I made this cake for 4th of July cook-out. I used an orange cake mix instead of yellow cake mix. Loved it. It was so good I'm making it again for the church picnic.

My mom has been making this recipe since I was a baby, it's my favorite cake!! Although she has always used lemon pudding to mix with the cool whip. It makes it 100 times better, much much more flavor. Try it!

Every time I make this I adjust something - either to make less gooey and more cakey or more gooey and less cakey.  No matter, every way I love it and get requests for it!

This recipe was great, quick and easy!  I added a few things per our liking.  I used 1/3 OJ and 2/3 oil for the 1 cup the recipe called for.  I also used the 11 oz can of mandarin oranges with juice and added orange gelatin and orange zest to the cake batter.  I also chose the lemon cake as with all my orange recipes, I find this brings out the orange flavor the best and makes it taste from scratch.  (The gelatin works nice in many cake recipes I use for great flavor and added moisture)My children didn't like the folded in orange chunks as some reviews recommended and they tend to settle as it cooks.  I blended them in and it was much better.  I use the 11 oz can of mandarin oranges and the 20 oz can of crushed pineapples with juice and mix with the pudding using a mixer to break down the oranges a little bit.  I then fold in the whip cream.  I also make my frosting immediately after I put the cake in the oven and place it in the refrigerator as it firms up a lot this way without having to discard the juices and flavors from the fruit cans.  I agree with some viewers as this cake gets better the longer it sits (which is hard to imagine)!  My husband and kids made me make this two days in a row...lol! Fabulous family fave!

Sooo good! I followed Renee's suggestion and added 1 teaspoon of orange extract and cut the oil down to 3/4 cup.  I made it the day before and refrigerated it overnight.  Everyone loved it.  It was the perfect ending to our luncheon...sweet and satisfying without being heavy. The topping is so good. I had several requests for the recipes.

I made this cake last Thursday for a few guests. And they were really impressed with it they loved it! They all came back for seconds. This week I made it again and added double mandarins at bottom and chopped pecans on top of frosting it was wonderful! My kids and hubby love this cake. Will make again and again.

The cake was moist but unflavorful. Couldn't taste the orange and barely tasted pineapple. I followed the recipe exactly.  Will not make this version again.

My husband calls this Pig Lickin Good cake.  It was quite delicious and everyone loved it.  Kids and adults alike.  I used an orange cake mix.  I also added a few oranges to the frosting and garnished with mandarin orange slices and maraschino cherries.  Very yummy!

This cake is sooo moist.  Like others, I cut oil to 1/2 cup and used 3 eggs.  Also added about 1/2 cup shredded coconut to the topping.  It makes a TON of topping - might try using only 1/2 an 8 oz. tub of Cool Whip.  Whatever amount you use, this cake is very good.

This cake was delicious!! It's very light, flavorful and easy to make. Like others, I didn't want to use a cup of oil, so I only used 1/2 cup and added 1/4 cup applesauce and it came out super moist. I squeezed half an orange in the batter as well to enhance the orange flavor but it didn't do any good. The best part was the topping, so yummy!! As the cake was cooling, I put the topping in the fridge to help solidify it, and then after it cooled and I added the topping, I put the whole cake into the fridge to set a little longer. It came out perfect! Will definitely be making this again!!

I have a similar recipe that I use to make a three layer cake but figured I would try this recipe to make a 9X13. My other recipe only uses 1/2 cup oil and the frosting uses more cool whip and less of the pineapple juice.

We've used this recipe for at least thirty years, which was given to us by an aunt.  It's always been a favorite, even used for wedding cakes when my mom and sister had a cake business.  It brings back many good memories, and is always a big hit at a party.

I followed the recipe exactly as written. It was moist and delish! I think I will follow a reviewer's suggestion and use applesauce instead of all that oil next time. I don't think it will take away from the flavor.

Fantastic cake!  Great for a summertime treat.  I too added orange extract to both the cake and the topping.  I also wanted a more "fruitful" dessert so I put more oranges (sans juice) and cut up dark cherries on top of the cake and them added the topping.  Wow, it was a hit at my dinner social.

We had an overabunace of canned oranges, and I had no idea how to make use of them. I found this recipe, although I had to make it sheet pan size, it turned out great, very dense while remaining moist. It's important to really check if the cake is done because of the added liquid.

It was ok, just a slight hint of orange. I could have used more orange and in the future I'll be buying some orange flavoring and adding it to the recipe.

I was looking for a recipe to use Mandarin Oranges because I LOVE them--couldn't really taste them in this cake at all. It was more about the pineapple topping. I could add orange flavoring, but...kind of misses the point and I don't have any anyhow!
I beat the whipped topping instead of folding it and pouring the sloupy mess on a ROUND cake was an experience. (Oh, dear...)
If I made this recipe again I would know better how to make it work, buuuut...I probably never will.
I'm sure if done right, this could be a great cake. But it just didn't work out for me.

Great Cake...but make it a day ahead of time and put in the refrigerator...flavor blend and cake is even more moist. I use 3/4 cup of oil and 1 tsp orange extract in the cake batter...perfect!

This cake is delicious!  I accidentally threw the juice from the oranges away so I added a splash of water to the cake batter and it still came out perfectly.  Very moist cake with a wonderful flavor.

Hmmmm, not very impressed w/this version. The cake itself is very greasy altho tasty-I'd definately cut back on the oil if I were to make this again. Following the directions to a "t", I "beat" the frosting ingredients, only to have a soupy mess. I refrigerated it for 4 hrs-still soupy, so I tried to save it by folding in another container of cool whip. It was useless-still too runny to spread on the cake. Tossed it all.

Made this for a friends birthday and it was a huge hit. Passed the recipe on to several ladies, one who made this the next day for her church group. They also loved it and she passes the recipe on to them. I'm sure this recipes is still being passed on!

I made this recipe exactly as described.  It wasn't fine but it's just not the type I prefer to make.  The cake turns out oily and sweet.  And the frosting is a bit too runny to retain its shape once it's been spread.  It's fine if you leave the cake in the baking pan, but if you want a nicer presentation the frosting recipe has to be thickened/stiffened.

A delicious cake! I never make cakes using a cake mix. This was my first. And it was truly awesome! The only thing I felt was not required was the vanilla pudding mix for the topping....made it a tad bit too sweet! Also, I made it as a bundt. Also, I had a drop of pineapple essence to the batter! Very tropical feel and yet mild!! :) Thanks Ellen!

I think it tastes citrusy and fruity.  I can't pick out the orange and pineapple taste specifically.  I was told this is the most moist cake I've ever tried.  That comment was after the cake was 3 days old.  This is a keeper.  Thank you for a great recipe.

This cake was amazing. I substituted the oil with apple sauce and used egg substitute for all of the eggs. I also used fat-free cool whip and it was a big hit. I used a little orange extract as recommended

Made this recipe for a hot summer picnic and it was a big success.  So that the frosting would harden slightly, I kept it in the refrigerator for about 3 hours before taking it.  It was cool, moist and very tasty.  Great reviews and most importantly, easy to make.

I made this for a Mother's Day brunch and it was fantastic! Because I was worried about the whipped topping frosting being too watery I strained the pineapple juice and added only the pineapple pieces first. Then I added in about two or three teaspoons of the juice. I read some reviewers who complained that the taste of the pineapple overwhelmed the orange cake so I decided to add a teaspoon of orange extract to the frosting. It kept the pineapple from being too strong. Otherwise, a fantastic recipe!

This cake is so refreshing but very very rich.  I subbed applesauce for half of the oil and used low fat whipped topping.  This would make a wonderful summertime dessert.

Absolutely delicious.   For the frosting, I whipped my own cream, then added the pudding and pineapple w/juice.  My daughter (who had requested it) called this her "dream cake!"  For someone who never uses a boxed mix, this recipe convinced me that sometimes, they are perfect!

This recipe helped me win 3rd place in an "Iron Chef Night" competition.  It's fresh, fruity, and very simple!  I made it in a round spring form pan and decorated it using coconut and mandarin oranges on top.  Fabulous!

Wow, this is really good. After reading some reviews, I decided to add some orange zest and vanilla to the cake batter to up the orange flavor - glad I did. The 'frosting' is SO yummy (one of those guilty-but-good suckers). Thanks for the recipe!

Have been making this cake for more years than I care to remember! LOL! It is a hit every time. I always double the recipe (large family) everyone wants some to go. Don't forget to refrigerate before you serve it and leftovers, too. If you have any that is! ;)

We love orange flavored cakes so I make the following changes, I use an orange cake mix and add 1tsp orange flavor to the mix.  If you like orange as much as we do you will not be disappointed.

My family loved this cake! I couldn't find an 11oz can of mandarin oranges so i used a 15oz can and lowered the oil to 3/4 Cup. It turned out wonderfully. Only gave this recipe 4 stars because of the frosting. It was like putting a fruit salad on top. WAY too runny, and i followed the directions for the frosting exactly. Next time i'll try draining the pineapple and reserve the juice. Then add it in a little at a time if needed. Wonderful cake! I'll make this again!

This was really good.  I used a french vanilla cake mix and I cut the oil down to 3/4 cup and added about 1/4 cup of fresh squeezed orange juice and some orange zest. It really made the cake taste more orange.  Made this for my sons 17th B-day today and everyone loved it. Thanks for the recipe.

THIS TURNED OUT AMAZING!! I MADE A COUPLE OF CHANGE'S.I USED TWO 9 INCH ROUND PAN'S. AND I ADDED 8 OZ. OF SOFTENED CREAM CHEESE TO THE FROSTING. I USED A HAND MIXER AND THE CONSISTENTCY RESEMBLED FROSTING INSTEAD OF PUDDING. AND THE OVERALL FLAVOR WAS AMAZING. I ALSO ADDED SWEETENED COCONUT TO THE SIDES AND GARNISHED THE TOP WITH SOME MANDARIN SEGMENTS I HAD RESERVED. ABSOLUTELY DEVINE!!

I made this cake for my Mom's birthday, per her request.  Very easy to make!  Hubby said best cake I've ever made and picky sister-in-law said that this was her new favorite cake, better than one's she's had from restaurants!  I made it the day before so it could chill completely. Used Duncan Hines butter yellow, added 1 tsp. butter extract in batter, used 15 oz. can oranges and used the hand mixer to break them up throughly.  Made 2 thinish, but super moist 9" round layers.  Frosting:  Used 1 tsp. coconut extract and the smaller box of vanilla pudding (fat free & sugar free-that's what I had) and it was just delicious.  Added some sweetened coconut to sides for decoration along with drained, crushed pineapple on top.  Gone in 2 days, hubby wants another one!

I made this cake however, I modified the recipe a bit. I used 1 and half cans of 11 oz. manadarin oranges. I also didn't beat the oranges in I beat the cake mix I used butter yellow. Then hand stirred in the oranges so they wouldn't dissolve. For the frosting I used lemon pudding, the cool whip and the crushed pineapple but also added about 1 1/2 oz. of coconut. Gave it a nice mix of flavors. After getting everything ready I decided at last minute to add some mini chocolate chips to the cake batter. I also used a set of mini tube cake pans I got from Farberware. This allowed me to make small personal size cakes for my family. This cake went over really well. It was really rich so I suggest you can cut the eggs down to 3 and the oil to 3/4 cup if you wanna lighten it up. I am going to try the frosting next time with different puddings to see how the results are. I am thinking of a pistachio pudding with another kind of fruit instead of pineapple. See how many delicious combinations I can make. The cake was alright but the frosting really stole the show.

I used to make this cake when I was a teenager (I'm 46 now).  I thought about it recently and decided to searched this recipe out!  It's just as delicious as I remembered!  I have made it a few times over the past month for my kids.  My son told his friend the other day to "taste this dude and DIE"!  It's a true winner!  Don't cahnge a thing.

This was ok, not worth the calories.  Cake was ok, not much flavor.  Followed the recipe exactly as written.  This will not be made again.

Great dessert, but could even be made a bit better... I did make a few adjustments:  (BUTTER Yellow Cake) 3 Eggs, just short of 3/4 cup oil.  Baked in 2 - 9 inch round pans.  For the topping, I did use a 12 oz Cool Whip - instead of 8 oz. (Had gobs left after thick layers, so stick with the eight) The 20 oz pineapple - used all the juice but half the fruit.  Garnished with additional oranges.  Next time I make this, I will add a LOT more oranges to the batter - as the 11 oz can wasn't nearly enough.  Lighten it up with FF Cool Whip / SF Pudding mix.  And, maybe blend up some of the oranges for the topping, as well.

I'm so glad I found this easy recipe here.  My friend's birthday party was last week and I volunteered to make the cake. (This is her favorite).  It was so easy.  Everyone liked it. I said, "I just followed the recipe."  It was very easy and non-expensive to make.  Thanks.

I recieved this recipe from my sister in law a few years ago and I make it for birthdays with a few changes. I use 2-11 oz cans of mandarin oranges but only the juice of one, and I use 2- 9 inch cake pans and cook for about 25 minutes. For the frosting, I throw the crushed pineapple, cool whip and pudding in the bowl and whip together for a few minutes, no need to fold..... it will set just fine after frosting the double layer and putting in the fridge for a couple hours. Everyone loves this cake. One could put orange segmets on top to decorate. If you haven't tried this one. DO you will be glad you did. Thanks Sandy

After I started making the cake for a dinner meeting, I discovered I had no mandarin oranges but I did have fruit cocktail!  IT worked wonderfully and I got so many compliments.  I will use the orangaes next time, however.  YUMMY!

This was FANTASTIC!  Very, very moist & flavorful.  I had to change it a little because my mom is allergic to oranges, so I used a 15 oz can of peaches w/juice instead and use 1/2 c. oil.  Boy the flavor was great & sooo moist!!  I would imagine the mandarin oranges would be great as well, but I will be making it with peaches from now on.  People always ask me for the recipe ~ it's very refreshing.  AWESOME!

AWESOME recipe, and so simple. I followed the recipe exactly with a couple minor changes. Instead of vanilla pudding i used cheesecake pudding (everybody kept asking how the creamcheese frosting was so light and fluffy, ha ha). Also when I made the topping, it collapsed a little but when I refrigerated it, it stiffened up and was a really good texture to "frost". I made my cake double layer, and there was still a perfect amount of topping! A definite staple in my kitchen!

This was good, but I have to agree with others that it's just not orangey enough. I even added orange peel to the cake, and it still didn't taste like orange. I'll try adding orange extract next time.

The frosting was delicious.  The cake was really good, but didn't have enough orange flavor to suit me.  I will make this again,  but I'll probably add some grated orange peel or orange extract.

Great alternative to the easy boxed cake recipe.  It really blows that away!  We added toasted coconut to top off the cake and it was great.  We've made it twice in the past month--one for a bachlorette party and one for a birthday.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a really good cake. I give it 5 stars because the taste is perfect. However I did alter the recipe a bit. I used 1/2 cup of oil because 1 cup sounded like too much fat for me. I made a double layer round cake and it turned out beautiful!! Next time I will leave out 1 egg and add toasted coconut or chopped pecans on top for a little something extra.

We really enjoyed this cake, especially the icing.  I lightened it by using egg substitute for half of the eggs, apple sauce for half of the oil, sugar free pudding mix and light Cool Whip.  I think next time I will use pineapple in the cake instead of oranges just because everyone thought it tasted more like pineapple anyway.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This cake is wonderful!  I cut the oil, too, to 1/2 cup, and I drained the oranges and pineapples, it would have been too watery without draining them.  This will definitely be one of the cakes I make a lot!

This was an excellent and super easy cake.  My husband rated it a 4 instead of a 5 because he said, "I tend to like fruity pies and chocolate cakes" - otherwise, I would give it 5 stars - the recipe definitely deserves 5 stars for the ease in putting it together!

I found this cake to be rather on the boring side. It was OK, but certainly nothing spectacular. I thought the mandarin oranges would add a nice twist to the mix, but I couldn't even taste them, nor could I taste the vanilla pudding in the frosting. The pineapple and whipped topping were too overpowering.

Being a kitchen snob, I didn't think I'd every use whipped topping, cake mix, or instant vanilla pudding, but this recipe has converted me to the conveniences of modern cooking! My kids loved it and frankly, I did, too. It sure beats making cakes from scratch.

This cake is so good and easy to make.  I added 1/2 tsp of orange extract to the batter for a little extra flavor.

This is one of my all-time favorite cake recipes.  I have made it for years, and it has never failed to be a hit whereever it is served.  However, I do reduce the oil to 3/4 cup; and I will use the orange juice concentrate the next time I make it as suggested.

Had to give this five stars because my guests loved it and asked for the recipe. Said it would be perfect to cool off in the summertime. My husband and I weren't super wowed though. I took the others' suggestions and used only 3/4 c. oil and 1/4 cup orange juice concentrate. Added orange zest and just a drop of orange extract. I wished I had orange-flavored cake mix but only had lemon. Used mandarin oranges instead of pineapple in the frosting for more orange flavor. It WAS good, moist and orange-y so the other reviews ARE true. We just prefer the orange chiffon cake recipe from this site better. Just preference, I guess. I'm still keeping this recipe in my box since everyone else loved it. Good potluck-type cake.

Not only was this an easy cake to make, it was very delicious.  I made the recipe for a pre-Father's day dinner, and brought the leftovers to work.  It was gobbled up!  I imagine this would be great with some coconut added to the top (toasted, yum!), but my father hates coconut.

I used orange supreme flavour cake mix, and pistachio pudding for the frosting (suggested by someone else's review) - and it was a big hit at my son's birthday party.  Very moist!  The frosting tasted like ambrosia salad!  Will definitely make again!

Everybody loved this cake. I felt the cake did not taste 'orangy' enough even though I used orange juice instead of the juice from the mandarin oranges can. But the texture and overall taste was good!! I think the taste came from the filling/icing not the cake itself.

Yummy and light-tasting!  I cut the oil in half and substituted applesauce.  Also, for the icing I used an envelope of dessert topping and a 14oz can of pineapple plus the vanilla pudding.  Very, very good!  This was enough batter and icing for a 2-layer 9" cake, and took less time to cook because of pan difference.  Be careful taking the cake out of the pans, though - it's so moist that one of my layers split a bit....

Great Cake!!  I make mine in the round and slice the rounds into 4 pieces and then ice the tops of each round.  It is very impressive and delicious.  It is such and light and refreshing dessert.  I have gotten great reviews on it.

I was very disappointed.  I baked this cake for the Thanksgiving holiday based on the high reviews.  The cake is certainly moist but bland.  The frosting was artificial tasting.  Sadly, no one else seemed to care for it either.

I used a golden cake mix and found that the flavour of the cake over powered the flavour of the mandarin oranges.  Next time I would use a white cake mix and I am sure it will be fantastic!

MMMMMmmmmmGood! Rather than using so much oil and egss, I follow the cake mix box, I measure out the mandarin oranges and juice and substitute them for part of the water. That way it is usally only 1/3 cup oil and 3 egss and a little water. I brought this in to work for "food day" and everyone loved it.

This cake is so moist and easy to make.  I made it as a layer cake for my husband's birthday and recommend using spring form pans.  The cake was so moist I had trouble getting it out of the pans in one piece!!  I reduced the fat by replacing the oil with applesauce, eggs with Egg Beaters, whipped cream with fat free whipped cream, and pudding with sugar free/fat free pudding and it turned out great!

I'm not a cake lover, but this was moist and fruity. I liked it, and it was sooooo easy. The flavor's reminiscent of Lutheran potlucks from my childhood.  Number of servings is accurate; too large a piece would be overpowering, I think.  Half the kids that had dessert loved it and half loved the cake portion but not the frosting. All the adults liked it.

When I want to impress without a lot of fuss this is the dessert I fix.  I have never gotten anything but rave reviews on this one.  Add a sprig of mint with a couple of pieces of orange, it makes a wonderful presentation. A sure crowd pleaser

I read the recipe, and since it was 90 degrees outside and I wanted to take a refreshing type of dessert to a friends house, I thought I would try this. My only variation was I did use an orange flavored Duncan Hines cake.  The results were more than wonderful. THANKS SO MUCH  Gail B.

This is a fabulous cake!  I'm going to have to take some of this over to a friend's house or I'll end up eating it all by myself.  I altered it just a bit though, I used a 15oz can of oranges for the cake mix, not 11oz.  Instead of mixing the crushed pineapple with the whipped topping, I poured the pineapple juice over the warm cake then I put the crushed pineapple on top of the cake...then I put the whipped topping on it.  I also garnished the top of the cake with more oranges.

Absolutely wonderful cake. Everyone really enjoyed it and went for seconds.
Instead of pineapple in the frosting, I used more mandarin oranges.

This is either the exact cake or VERY similiar to one I made a few years back.  It was a HUGE hit with the entire family, including my incredibly picky daughter!  It was very light and fluffy and was the PERFECT warm weather cake.  You don't want heavy super sweet when it's super hot out.  However, this cake is SO good, you can have it any time.  One of the VERY best cakes I've ever made!  PLEASE try this!

I went by the recipe even though I made this many years ago. It was good and very refreshing with the fruit in it. I do think I’ll add more mandarin oranges to the cake. I tasted them but adding more will only enhance the flavor. I love Allrecipes!  I also love the reviews because everyone has great ideas on making it better or explaining what the recipe should have been. I do roll my eyes when someone gives a bad rating when they didn’t go by the recipe. This is my first review so I’m sorry I was so long winded!

The only thing I did that recipe didn't call for is I put sliced oranges on top. This cake is so easy to make and absolutely delicious. I will be making it again and I already put it into my favorite recipes file. Thank you so much!

Made this easy cake for a coworkers birthday and it was a huge hit! Everyone wanted the recipe.  I made it just as the recipe states except I made some extra whipped cream and folded it in to the rest of the topping.  I just wanted to make sure I had plenty of frosting for my 2 layer cake.

A big hit with my family. I misplaced this recipe that my mother in law used to make over 20 years ago. She was a great dessert baker and I was so happy to find this on the site searching the ingredients I remembered. I added about a t of orange extract to the cake batter. It is also great frozen as the icing is like yummy pineapple ice cream.

Always a hit, getting the right texture is a bit of a challenge as this cake is moist and soft which is part of it's appeal.

350 degrees for 35 minutes burned it and the juice left in the pineapple for the frosting made it soupy.  What an awful recipe.  Instructions are so very wrong.  I will never follow this one again.

I've been making this cake for years.  Everyone loves it.  Here in North Carolina, it has the loving name of "Pig Picken Cake" going back to the days when farm families got together to help each other kill and dress a pig for the family's winter meat.  This is a much easier adaption of the original recipe.

I doubled the amount of oranges (but not the amount of juice) and added one teaspoon of orange extract, along with 3 eggs and 1/2 cup of oil.  I only had to bake for 28 minutes, so be aware of your oven temps and bake times.  Ended up being delicious!

Made it for my friends, the only thing  I did different  was... 1) added rind of 1/2 an orange.  2) baked in 2 round pans, stack it  to serve a more dressy looking dessert for a birthday for one of our coffee gang members.

Fantastic cake for summer.  I made exactly as written for my mom’s 77th birthday and she and my sisters, children and all loved it.  Very refreshing and super easy.   I placed in freezer for about 30 minutes making it nice and cool to eat in this 100 degree weather.

Love this recipe. Like most reviewers, I altered the recipe.  I used Pineapple Supreme cake mix instead of vanilla cake mix, and Banana pudding mix instead of vanilla pudding mix in the topping.
Every party I go to I am asked to bring this cake, no matter the time of year or theme of the party. It is always a great hit!

This is a great cake for a summer dessert. My family really enjoyed it. I did take another reviewers advice and decreased the oil to 3/4 cup and added 1 teaspoon of orange extract. I think next time I make it, I will substitute mandarin oranges instead of crushed pineapple in the frosting.

Why use a cake mix, which is highly processed, instead of cooking from scratch? This cake tastes no different than plain yellow cake mix and has a very artificial flavor.

What a fresh, light, and delicious dessert!  My husband and I truly enjoyed each bite!  I'm so happy to have this recipe!  What a great treat, I think, for the upcoming warm summer weather!  However, this is such a moist, yummy treat that I will make all year round!  Can't wait to serve it to friends!!!

I have made this cake several times now, once, following the recipe exactly, delicious!  The second time, I was making it for my grandson, who doesn't like pineapple.  I used mandarin orange in the topping in place of the pineapple.  The last time that I made it was for a dinner party.  I forgot to buy vanilla pudding so I substituted coconut pudding, it was a huge success!  Very tropical!

I made these into cup cakes for my daughters 1st birthday.  The guests really loved it.  the cook time for cupcakes is about 13 mins.  you need to watch them closely as a minute more could dry them out.  let it sit for a bit and then refrigerate for a bit before putting on the topping.  for the frosting,  makes sense to grind down the pinapple bits in a blender to get a nice swirl with an icing tip.  if you dont puree the pineapple,  the big chunks get stuck in the icing tips

I agree with Renee!! I wasn’t sure until I put the 1 cup of oil in though ?? it still turned out well, but I could tell it wasn’t necessary. I added one box of pudding to the cake and a sugar free pudding to the topping. Flavor on point!!

I've been waiting for an opportunity to make this cake. I used a yellow Pillsbury cake mix and added orange zest as some recommended, however I liked the delicate mandarin orange taste that carried through.  With the icing I drained off some of the liquid again as others suggested and the topping came out perfectly.  A very easy and impressive cake--I reserved some mandarin oranges for a starburst effect and added some jelly beans for seasonal reasons.  It was very well received and I will make it again.

I didn't have vanilla pudding so used instant coconut.  I put coconut on top.  
This is a simple quick delicious cake!  Love, Love, Love it!  My husband raved it was the best cake and I am a fairly seasoned cook!  I have made it twice in 3 weeks!

Really good cake. But be aware the orange flavor is nearly absent. The pineapple flavor from topping is predominant. It’s easy to make and turns out moist and tropical. I’d recommend this.

I added a little orange juice to the topping and decorated the top of the  cake with some of the Mandarin  oranges and maraschino cherries.  I also added some yellow and orange sprinkles on the top of the cake.  

I split the cake in the pan in half , put the topping on the bottom layer so it was like a square cake  with filling in the middle.  The cake was  very delicious and pretty.

This cake is so moist its a wonder it stays together as well as it does.
The only thing I did that was not intentionally mentioned, was to hand stir everything together.  Cake and frosting were both stirred by hand.
Even the frosting is light.  Hubby did purchase the extra creamy cool whip, not sure if that made a difference or not.  
This recipe is on my favorite list and will be making more for the upcoming summer.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

No big changes. I followed the recipe exactly except for the pan. Only had a 10 x 10 pyrex type casserole pan. Had to increase baking time because center was still very jiggly. OMG this is to die for. Even better the next day after overnite in the fridge. The cake is light, fluffy and flavorful. The topping, same thing. The combination of flavors, the Mandarin Orange and the pineapple, seems a marriage made in heaven. You must try this.

i made this as written but did add the orange flavoring- one teaspoon.  I didn't need the full container of cool whip.  Our bible study group loved it and I will make this frequently as it's light and refreshing.

Really good, I used the mandarin oranges WITH the juice. Might like it a little more with more citrus taste, adding a little lemon or orange zest. Family could not stop eating this. The gluten-free folks ate the topping only.

DELISH!!  Big hit with my husband.  Altered a bit.  Used just 3/4 C. oil , 1 tsp orange extract & 15 oz. can mandarin oranges.  I also prefer a less sweet topping & used crushed pineapple in its own juice.  Hint....drain oranges & mix juice with other ingredients first.  Then fold in orange segments.  I stirred them in first time when beating batter & they really broke down.

Made the recipe with 3/4 cup vegetable oil like others suggested and one big can of mandarin oranges with the whole juice and mixed the pudding mix with the pineapple and let it sit for 5 minutes to thicken then gold out gently with the creamy cool whip. Delicious!

Delicious and easy to make! I substituted 1 cup of apple sauce for the oil. I also used mandarin slices to decorate the top of the two-layer cake. Also used a little more frozen whipped topping than the recipe called for to frost the cake, because I made two layers instead of a sheet cake. Very worthy of a pot luck.

I did make a change with coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, I measured a 1/2 cup plus 2 Tbl spoons. Some reviewers suggested using orange extract to boost the orange flavor. I didn’t have any, so instead I zested 2 “Little Cuties” on hand to cake mix. I also used only 3 eggs as the box suggested. It was really tasty and the orange flavor was very present. Nice texture and moist!

The box of yellow cake mix now has 15.25 ounces instead of the 18.25 ounces called for in this and most other cake recipes. All cake mix companies have removed 3 ounces from the dry batter. However, I made a few adjustments (less oil and only 3 eggs) and the cake turned out delicious.

I like it...but I don't love it. It is light and sweet. I can't taste the fruit much. I would try again and put fruit chunks in, after mixing the batter, (maybe pineapple instead of the orange). I'm not a fan of the topping.  Somehow the cake just cries out for a topping with a little crèam cheese in it and some toasted coconut on top.It is a nice simple recipe, just needs a bit of work. Oh, and reduce the oil.

Read a few reviews and one said they used 3/4 c. Vegetable Oil instead of 1 c. On the recipe and it was perfect. So I compromised and did halfway between.  Cake and topping were excellent. Will make again!

I did not make it yet, but I did want to comment on the one review stating no orange taste, and another review stating using extract.

To get the absolute best taste of citrus is to zest the fruit into your recipe, and use the juice from the fruit as well.

Extract has NO comparison to the real thing.  Do this when cooking as well.  The taste and aroma are bar none.

Good ingredients make good food.

Great recipe. We know it as Pig Lickin' Cake, I have no idea why. This recipe is great as is or you can add a teaspoon or half a teaspoon of orange, pineapple, almond, coconut or rum extract for a totally different flavor. I've even cut back one egg and used 3/4 cup of oil and it was still very moist. I have added a little bit of Southern Comfort and or Amaretto to the frosting and Seven Hells is was fantastic.

I have been using this as our traditional "birthday cake" for almost 35 years now. It came to me by way of my godmother who had been using it for many years too. It is always a hit! I do sub eggbeaters for the real eggs, unsweet applesauce for the oil, sugar free vanilla pudding for the regular pudding, lower fat whipped topping, and crushed pineapple in its own juice. Never heard any complaints about the subs. There is a lot of sugar in the box mix so I try to cut the sugar and fat a little.

This recipe was totally read wrong by ME-Actually not sure how I read the directions inaccurately but I am to blame)!The following is how I made this cake go figure. . . Yellow cake mix-check- 4 eggs check- 1 cup of veg. oil check-11 ounce can of mandarin orange (drained)?check-1- 20 ounce  can crushed pineapple w/juice-check-and 1 pkg. of vanilla pudding mix(not instant )check..Mix all the above w/mixer till smooth put into 9/13 pan check. Bake for 50/53 minutes @ 350 check-delicious- check.
I just went straight on thru w/ directions not looking to see what part cake and what part icing. Needless to say cake is a powerhouse of delectable' s - so what about the topping I left the cake without , it is already a sweet cake-next time though I will try the recipes cakes's topping.
This was the worst reading of ingredients I have done-don't know how it turned out good-but it did.

I have been making this cake for years. It is my family's favorite cake. I make it with three layers. I use 3/4 cup oil rather than 1 cup. It is a light and delicious cake.

Followed the instructions pretty much to the letter, I just added a bit more fruit because it's  delicious!!  The best part of the whole thing is the leftovers!  It just makes it even better letting the mixture soak into the cake.  It's so light and fluffy that you could easily eat the whole thing with hardly any guilt.

I made this for church potluck and it was a big hit.  Instead of using cake mix I made the 4 egg yellow cake recipe I found on here.  That recipe called for shortening and instead of shortening I used butter.  I also used orange extract instead of vanilla that was called for in the recipe.  I did not use any of the mandarin orange juice called for in this recipe.  I would definitely make this again.  It made a nice dense cake.

This is a very nice summer cake.  My favorite way to make it is to use orange supreme cake mix instead of yellow and lemon pudding mix instead of vanilla.

With all the rave reviews I was expecting something spectacular  but was very disappointed.  It certainly is not worth the calories and  I will not be making this again.  I made this to bring to Memorial Day celebration and after tasting it I threw it out and  went to Walmart and bought a carrot cake which was much better!!  Don't waste your time making this.

This cake was very yummy. I used canola oil instead of vegetable and only used half a cup. I also added orange extract to the batter for flavoring. Everyone who ate it absolutely loved it.

Absolutely delicious.  Every time I make this cake everyone tells me how scrumptious.  The only thing I added to the topping is some toasted cocoanut on top as a garnish. It added another flavor that complements the fruit!!

Orange flavor is barely present. If you want it to taste anything like orange you should add orange zest or orange extract. Other than that this cake is light, delicious, and looks beautiful! The frosting is some of the best frosting I have ever had.

Super good!  My husband does not like sweets and he like this one.  I took a couple prior suggestions and decreased oil to 3/4 cup and added orange extract.  I was trying to get rid of some Halo Cuties that noone was eating, so I used fresh in stead of canned.  I threw the sections into a measuring cup until i reached 11oz and used several more to squeeze for the juice.  Everything else was as written.

This is a recipe which I've been making for years and have always been very happy with.  I did cut the oil back by 1/4 cup.  Still very moist and delicious.  I baked in three  9 inch layers and used the topping for filling between the layers.

Delicious, moist cake that I would certainly make again but there is no detectable orange flavour, even though I drained off the juice from the oranges and replaced it with orange juice.  I might go with the orange extract next time as a couple of reviewers have suggested.  Also, as other reviewers have noted, there is a lot of icing so I sliced the cake horizontally to make 2 layers and put some of the icing between the layers but next time I'll bake the layers in two pans.  I don't use Cool whip ever, and in this case I used a cup of whipping cream and beat it all together - beautifully thick, held up really really well.

I did what Renee did because it sounded right... added a teaspoon of orange extract to the cake mix and reduced the oil to 3/4 cup. It was plenty moist enough and the orange taste was just right. The topping was really good. My husband absolutely loved it... it only lasted a day and a half!

This cake is one of the BEST cakes I've ever made!  Although my Mom called it,   "Party Cake"   it's the exact same ingredients we always used. (different name that's all). It's delicious and after you eat it, you don't feel real full!  Great for summer picnics!  Always a winner with guests!  Enjoy!

This cake is amazing! I made it for a family luncheon and it was a huge hit. Although I did take some tips from other reviewers; I cut the oil to 3/4 cup and added orange extract and I mixed the pineapple and instant pudding together then folded it into the cool whip. Will definitely make again!!

I have used this recipe for years, got it in a paper back church recipe book, it was called pea picken cake in it, It is moist and good, the review about changing the oil to 3/4 cup was right, I have made it both ways. This book I got it from was the 80,s. I just put it in the oven to make for my grandson to try out tonight.

Amazing cake. Very light and not too sweet. I used sugar free yellow cake mix and used only 1/2 cup canola oil. Perfect cake for summer season!!!

This is WONDERFUL!!!  As someone who purchased 3lbs of the fresh Mandarin Oranges I was searching for a way to use them.... AND I absolutely LOVE oranges so I made this and was very pleased.  I used about 10 of the fresh Oranges instead of the canned and they made the cake taste extra fresh. Thanks so much,  this one is a Keeper and is going into my personal "Portfolio" of  "Specialties"  :)

Love my version of this. I use Pineapple cake mix. I add chopped pecans and sometimes fresh coconut into the whipped topping. Note, this cake must stay refrigerated but tastes best if served almost room temperature. A favorite every time I make it! Attractive, moist and a refreshing change from other cakes. Looks like you went to a lot of trouble but it is so easy! We call it Fool's Cake though I don't remember why.

Iv made this cake twice first time as written second time with my tweaks!This was a Good cake But i thought it was a bit bland The Mandarin orange flavor really didnt come through unfortunately. I decided to play around with the recipe and add a half of box of orange jello! Loved it!!! Worked perfect gave it just enough orange flavor without being to much! Also the second time i made this cake i made it in a bundt pan an topped it with a citrus glaze Turned out pretty yummy! But i do prefer it with the original recipes topping!

This is the best cake ever!!! I took someone else's advice by adding more oranges and like 2-3 tablespoons of orange extract. I kept tasting the batter until I could actually taste the orange flavor. I made this into an 8" round icecream cake using bluebell vanilla ice cream as the middle layer. And as someone else mentioned, I couldn't stop eating the pineapple frosting! This cake is phenomenal!!!

Did not need to use 1 cup of oil, followed directions on box for 1/3 cup  of oil and the cake was perfectly moist. Also omitted 1 of the 4 eggs. It made for a lighter and delicious cake.

I followed the directions even though common sense told me one cup oil was too much. I ended up with a flat oily cake on Easter morning. Luckily it was Buy One Get One and I was able to make a marble cake and use the mandarin icing.  Then I found my recipe and looked at other sites and sure enough it takes  1/2 cup of oil. Use a more trusted site for recipes.

This is a good basic "I'm in a hurry, need a dessert" type of recipe.  It has nice texture and the taste is good.  When I made this exactly as the recipe stated I felt the cake was something I would be pleased to share with guests but nothing memorable.  I then made the cake, trying for a richer, less artificial taste.  I drained the oranges and replaced that cup of liquid with orange juice, used a duncan hines orange cake mix, used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup melted butter and mixed in a 1/2 cup of sour cream.  For the topping, I mixed the pineapple with the pudding mix and set aside.  Creamed 8 oz. of cream cheese with 1/2 cup of sugar until smooth, added 1 cup of heavy whipping cream and beat until stiff peaks formed.  Folded the pudding and cream cheese mixture together and frosted the cake.  I was much happier with the flavor, texture and even the presentation of the cake.  Thanks for a good basic recipe that I could be creative with.

My family did not like this cake at all. It did not have enough flavor and it was too bad that the recipe calls for you to blend the oranges till smooth....It would have been better with some texture (I think). I made it because my daughter LOVES manderin oranges. She took a bite and hated this cake......She was SOOO looking forward to having this cake...In our family this was a "Total Miss" !!!!

I was rather disappointed with this cake. I saw that the recipe had a lot of high ratings, so I decided to make it for my grandma's birthday. I followed the recipe exactly. However, I might as   well have made a premade yellow cake. It didn't taste like anything more than that to me, and I was expecting to have more than just a premade cake.

This was good, but not especially exciting. If I did it again, I'd probably add some more oranges to the batter, maybe a couple tablespoons of zest. Nice, but not a gourmet improvement on a mix.

This was so moist and so good.  One hint I would give that was not mentioned is let the cake cook completely before spreading the topping on.  Great recipe.

I don't like rating things bad but I was dissappointed with this recipe. It was pretty bland, tasted more like box cake then orange cake. The icing part was interesting and not what I was expecting. Its a very good idea but I think I'll find a better way to make it more orange tasting and less box cake tasting. oh I even added about 1/2 cup frozen concentrated orange juice to it and didn't taste any better.  sorry.

The recipe from this site Four Egg Yellow Cake (with butter not shortening) was used, I don't care for boxed cake.  Orange flavoring was also added to this two layer cake. The frosting and oranges were placed between the layers as well as on top. I actually enjoyed working and eating the frosting. Cool Whip can taste very weird but not in this case.

My older sister got this recipe from her friend back in the early 70s. I have been making it for years. Just to share, I just made it about 2 months ago. Well, I had a brain****, and couldnt remember how much oil went in the cake. So I googled the recipe, and look where it showed up. My favorite website. I thought it was some long lost recipe that only a few people had. How wonderful is that! That I found it and many people can enjoy this awesome cake. Thanks so much for sharing, And I use 3 cake pans instead of the 9x 13.

Very yummy and moist. Not as orange-y as I thought, especially with the pineapple topping-that kind of masked the orange flavor. Next time I will add orange zest and use a different frosting.

This was very good, although I was expecting a little more orange flavor! I took other suggestions to reduce the eggs to 3 and oil to 3/4 cup. I used buttercream frosting instead of the whipped topping - wasn't too crazy about the fact that it would be a pineapple orange cake. Next time, I'll add some orange zest to the cake and try the topping with oranges instead of pineapples!

Someone at work made this cake several years ago.  I got the recipe; however, it was not copied correctly.  I found this recipe on line and it was simular to the wrong copy I had.  I made this cake for my family.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  It is so easy.  At my workplace, we call it the pea picker cake.  PS I only used a half cup of oil as another reviewer suggested.

I made this after someone recommended it for a potluck.  I followed some advice and added 1 tsp orange extract.  A little tense during the baking, as I made it in a stoneware bundt pan.  It took 50 minutes to bake.  For the icing, I mixed the pineapple and pudding, then folded in the whipping cream (from review advice).  I found that I had some extra icing left over after covering the cake, so I added another can of fruit then dished it into meringue cups for an additional dessert.  Altogether, it worked out well.

This was good. I used 2 8" round pans and should not have. I also think you can cut the eggs back to 3 and the oil back to 3/4 c. Tasted good! I think next time I will use mandarin oranges in the icing as well and leave out the pineapple.

WOW! This cake is so delicious and moist.  I did alter it due to some of the suggestions from other reviews.  I reduced the oil to 3/4 cup and added some orange juice- I dont really measure my ingredients, but eyeball it, so I guess I put in about 1/2-1/2 cup of fresh OJ. To fix the problem others had with the frosting being to runny. I used the large box of Instant Vanilla Pudding-5.1oz box and refrigerated overnight, and it was perfect!!! I also added coconut to my frosting, however much I wanted.  Great recipe, would be great for summer picnics.  Thank you!

I absolutely LOVE this cake!  It is so moist and delicious with or without the topping.  It was a huge hit with the famiy, office and family reunion.  I followed the recipe as written.

I made it for the first time, so I followed instructions exactly even though it sounded odd.  This has WAY to much oil.  Forget about health issues (I usually do), but all I could taste was the vegetable oil.  It over powers the oranges, the cake mix, even the frosting.  The frosting would be great, but it does need some tweaking.  I love the pudding with the whipped cream, but the pineapple made it a little too wet and if I didn't just taste the oil in the cake, the pineapple would overwhelm the orange flavor.  It's supposed to be Mandarin Orange Cake...not pineapple.  :(

I made this cake for my boyfriend but he only ended up getting a couple pieces! I didnt think i would like it because i dont like pineapple but wow! Its a little sweet but "fruit" sweet not "sugar" sweet. Super moist and a great cake! Everyone who tried it wanted the recipe and will be a normal sweet in our home. Thanks!

No other words but "SIMPLY DELICIOUS"..this cake is awesome. It is so moist from the madarin and the pineapple whip cream frosting is light, airy and not real sweet. My family just loved this. IN fact I made one for a family gathering it was gone in minutes and I had to make 2 more the same night. Which reminds me - it is a quick and easy recipe!!!

I am not usually fond of cake mix cakes, but this was an exception.  I made it for my mom's bd and she loved it!  I was almost afraid to tell her it was a cake mix - sort of a sin in our family!! I will make this again soon.  Thanks for this one.

YUM! Doubled the batch for a dinner party of 40, it was the first dessert to go. Only thing I will try differently next time is to try orange extract or orange cake mix (for a more orange flavour). Thanks!

I followed the directions exactly - the cake is moist and smells heavenly, but it is a little too dense for me.  I prefer a lighter cake.  But, I LOVE the frosting!  I will likely make the frosting again with a different cake.  Note that the recipe makes way more frosting than needed.

Not only was this recipe super easy but it looks gorgeous.  I've made this several times now for various events and it's always been a big hit.  Personally, I recommend refrigerating it overnight before serving.  It allows the juices from the oranges and pineapple to sink in and it makes the cake almost seem like a very tasty pound cake-yum!!

Simple, delicious and a wonderful summer time dessert.  I made a few changes.  I decreased the oil to 1/2 cup because I used a 15 oz. can of mandarin oranges (11 oz. is not available in my area) and baked the cake for 40 minutes.  I also increased the Cool Whip to a 12 oz. container and used a 5.1 oz. package of pudding.  The frosting was thicker and easier to manage especially after letting it set up for a few minutes.  I garnished with additional mandarin orange slices.

This was a perfect dessert for a summer party...cool, refreshing, and yummy!  I made them into cupcakes (made 24) and garnished the top of each with a mandrin orange. They were a big hit, and I will be making these again!

Very Tasty- But not very pretty- as the topping is very sloppy. Also, I added the oranges after the batter was mixed so that they wouldn't be too broken up. Over all I got a very good report from all who tasted it!

I think this was the easiest and tastiest cake I have made in a long time. It was so moist and I love the pineapple topping. I am going to try it with some coconut next time for a summer tropical taste.

I love this cake! I always just make the yellow cake per the box directions for two nine inch rounds. For the frosting I mix in some of the mandarine orange juice with the pineapple, pudding mix and whipped topping. I then frost and layer the middle and decorate the top with mandarine oranges-makes it so pretty when you slice the cake, and adds the extra orange flavor! Delicious!

This was delicious. My boyfriend and I could've eaten it all. It doesnt need any changes, but next time I might try more oranges in the cake mix and also maybe mix half pineapple & oranges into the topping for more orange taste.

I found this recipe after I baked a yellow cake then looked for a way to make it fancy for an event.  I ended up using the "frosting" idea with modifications... I made holes and placed marachino cherry halves in them before putting the whipped topping on.  I also added a little of the cherry juice to the topping.  I used "dreamwhip" and french vanilla pudding.  The topping was a little flat and liquidy when I put it on the cake but 3 hours in the refrigerator and it was ok. 
This was a very moist and delicious cake.  I will try it again with the mandarins.   I can imagine other flavors as well.  I think next time I would use more "flavoring" in the cake batter before baking.

The frosting was very good.  The cake had hardly any orange flavor.  I did not have orange extract but I did add the zest of 1 orange.  This still did not give it and orange flavor.  The pineapple in the frosting was the most predominant flavor.  My family loved it anyway but don't look for a strong orange flavor in this cake.

I made a few changes like some of the others.  I added 1 tsp. Orange Extract to the cake, decreased the oil (used Olive Oil, 3/4 c), and used an 11 can or mandarin oranges for top.  This was very good, but will add another tsp. orange extract next time.  Also will add cream cheese and coconut to the frosting.

I changed this recipe to make it in a Bundt pan I added 1 3.5 ounce) package of instant vanilla pudding.  This makes the batter dense enough to put in a Bundt pan.  I used a Butter Yellow Cake mix, instead of the vegetable oil, I used 1 cup melted margarine.  
Also because I was taking this cake to a picnic and the weather seemed to be against me using a whipped topping based frosting, I used a glaze.  ORANGE GLAZE: Combine 4 Tbsp melted butter and 4 tsp orange extract.  Beat in 4 Tbsp boiling orange segment juice, 2 cups sifted confectioner's sugar, 1/8 tsp salt, and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract.  I used the very well drained, can drained then drained a second time on paper toweling, canned mandarin Orange Segments as decorations.  Everyone who tried the cake at the picnic remarked that the cake was delicious and moist, just what every cake baker wants to hear.

First off, I must admit that I changed the recipe by using an orange Duncan Hines cake mix.  I also chose to use the recipe on the box rather than using 4 eggs and 1 cup of oil which I found was a bit much.  The result was a cake that did not rise very much and which had a very strange texture.  The topping, as others have mentioned was very good, however the cake as a whole had a weird non-cake texture.  It was heavier than I would have liked.  I would likely make the topping again and add it to a regular orange cake and perhaps put mandarin oranges on top to decorate.  

I could say I would make it and follow the recipe, however the 4 eggs and 1 cup of oil scare me.

This recipe was good, but it didn't taste like anything special.  I probably could have made a normal yellow cake, topped it with cool whip, and tasted little difference.  Although, it did taste a little more orangey after chilling in the fridge overnight.  My roommates liked it a lot.  Note: the recipe makes a TON of topping!

This was the first cake I've ever made (besides making the box cake per instructions on back of box with a can of frosting) and it was great! Very easy to make. My mom, who usually is not a fan of cake, loved it, and everyone in my family went back for seconds. I plan on making it again to bring to family events this summer.

This cake came out so dry we couldn't eat it. I used a white cake instead of a yellow cake mix so that may have been why. I gave it 3 stars because the frosting was excellent, so I am going to try again and prepare the cake by the directions on the back of the box and then add some manddarin oranges.

This was very light tasting, though very sweet. I think less of the pudding mix might make the frosting lighter. But As Is (with one extra can of mandarin oranges), it was a huge hit for my boss' birthday!

This was good, I did use 1/2 cup of oil and all the juice in w/the mandarin oranges.  Everyone liked it, but I think next time I might make the icing w/o so much of the crushed pineapple, just a personal preference.

Delicious! I followed the recipe as is and it was very good. It didn't taste super very orangey but it made the cake really moist and a gorgeous color. Next time I think I'll try adding two cans of mandarins to the topping instead of the pineapple to see if that makes it more orangey. I'm making it again tomorrow to take to a potluck.  Thanks for something else to add to the dessert rotation besides chocolate cake and brownies!

I've made this cake several times and it always comes out great just as written. The only change I make is to use sugar free instant pudding mix and light whipped topping. It's a refreshing and cool desert to serve at a summer barbeque. Thanks for sharing Ellen!

This is a very tasty cake!  Mine, however, needed 50-55 minutes in the oven before it was done -- the batter was quite soupy from the added mandarin "juice."  Also, the icing sets up once it's been refigerated, so don't worry if it seems a little thin at first.  From reading other reviews, it sounds like some folks want this to be more orangey-tasting and so have modified the ingredients.  I appreciate their creativity, but it's also very yummy as written!

I made this today for my 3-year-old cousins birthday party. Everybody (adults) loved it! I personally didn't care too much for it, because I was imagining it to be more like angel food cake. But this was yellow cake, duh, so of course it wouldn't taste like angel cake. But everybody loved it, and I liked it, so I'm still giving it 5 stars!

Well, I made this because the reviews were  very good, but I was dissappointed in the results.  It was "OK" but not amazing.  I had half a pan of leftover cake with lots of people over, and ended up throwing it out because no one really wanted anymore the next day.  Not very orangy tasting, frosting is kind of strange.  I wouldn't make it again.

Wonderful cake - my husband's favorite!  Instead of baking in a 13x9, I made 9" rounds, then sliced the cooled cake in half so you ended up with 4 layers.  Admittedly the frosting is a bit thin, but the taste is so good I got over that!!

OK. What's with this recipe? I made it twice. The first time I thought I made it wrong. The second time I even used a lemon cake mix and added orange extract to punch up the flavor. And while the icing was O.K. I hade to add a packet of unflavored gelatin to thicken it up - was way to runny. I made it for a family party and the reaction was so so. My entire family and husband's family are foodies - and no one asked for a copy of this recipe. Try Bev's chocolate pie recipe- now that's something good!

I was disappointed in this cake.  I had hoped it would delicious, but I found it rather bland.  Mine turned out extremely dense.  Maybe it was the cake mix I used (Duncan Hines moist deluxe classic yellow)?  Or, the oven temperature.  The "frosting" yielded a lot.  I used only about 3/4 of the amount, and it still overpowered the cake.

This cake is one of the best I've made - it's delicious!  It got rave reviews at a party I had from both kids and adults.  I'll definitely have it again, and often.

I brought this cake into work today. It was a huge hit. One girl said, "I never ate desserts until I tasted your baking". Thank you allrecipe.com for a lot of wonderful ideas and recipes.

THis was my favorite cake all through my childhood.

My grandmother made it for me all the time (from memory), but forgot the recipe as years went by.

I was so happy to find it again.

We called it Pig Pin Cake!!

This has got to be the easiest cake I have made!  Though it didnt have much orange flavor in the cake mix, the contrast of the pineapple in the frosting made up for it!  My husband literally ate the entire cake!!!  Looks like a family favorite!

It was easy to assemble. The flavor is good but I expected to taste more orange flavor. But I will make it again.

I think this cake is just great.  It is more of a light cake, great for summer!  I took it to a potluck and I had to print out 3 recipes and give them to my friends!
