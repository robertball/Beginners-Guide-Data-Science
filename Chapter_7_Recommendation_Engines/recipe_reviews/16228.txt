Remember when working with beets they stain big time -- I use latex gloves when handling them and never cut them on a wooden cutting board -- use a plastic one or paper plates

Very good flavor but strong- and like others said it is kind of a baby food texture. Because of that I think it's almost more of a condiment than a side (maybe that's what it's supposed to be). I could see this having a place on a gourmet plate of food you know when they stack a filet mignon & mashed potatoes and maybe asparagus and some sauce or garnish to look real pretty.....I think this would fit right into a meal like that.

You have to like both beets and horseradish to enjoy this dish. Hubby loves horseradish but is not a beets fan. I like beets just fine but don't love horseradish. I can't even eat it because the horseradish is too strong for me. Hubby will only eat it in small amounts because the beet taste is too strong for him.
