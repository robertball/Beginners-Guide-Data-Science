I doubled this recipe and made them into patties for a makeshift salisbury steak. I did add some spices (onion powder, garlic powder, parsley, fresh ground pepper). I chose not to make mine in the microwave, I just browned them in the skillet. This worked out great. I covered them with a homemade mushroom/onion brown gravy and served them with mashed potatoes. No leftovers.

This wasn't bad, but I probably won't make it again. I baked it for twenty five minutes and it was still pink, so I had to nuke it in the microwave for two minutes. In the end, it just tasted like hamburger. If I made it again, I'd definitely add more spice - it was kind of bland. Thanks anyways!

It's easy, quick and goes with anything. I wish I'd found this sooner. Next time, I'll add boiled egg slices on top.

We absolutely loved this although did make some substitutions since we can't eat wheat, soy or dairy. I used a brand of "O's" cereal similar to cheeris (blended with hand blender to create bread crumbs), rice milk, omitted the worschester sauce, and added lots of italian seasoning. 

Then I actually made these into small meat balls for my 2 year old and baked them in my toaster oven at 350 degrees.   My husband tried them and wanted to eat them all.  Very moist and tasty.
