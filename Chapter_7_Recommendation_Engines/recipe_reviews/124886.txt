What a great recipe - this is pretty much the same as some of the dutch almond tea cakes you can buy in stores. Just watch your timing - I found that 16-17 minutes was plenty for a nice, moist tea cake!

Very tasty and presentable....a lot of effort to make them though I thought. The recipe as written made me 39 but I admit I made most of mine to dome and included about 3/4 teaspoon filling in each one. They were delicious though and when you have the time, well worth the effort!

These turned out great, but I did make a couple of slight changes.  I doubled the filling, which I would definitely recommend, and I baked them in regular sized muffin tins since I didn't have mini ones.  Baking them in the regular tins worked out fine, though next time I would decrease the baking temp a bit because the cookies ended up a little too dry while I was waiting for the filling to cook all the way.  Still, the family loved them!

These were pretty tasty. I thought the filling might be more gooey but it pretty much soaked in with the dough. I did use more egg white so I'm not sure if that was the reason. I baked at 20 minutes and I think I would have taken off a few minutes because they were a bit crispy after they cooled. I prefer softer.

These were very good little tartlets.  They were good as the recipe stated and I think even a little better with a tiny dab (less than 1/4 tsp.) seedless raspberry jam sneaked in under the almond filling.  The almond flavor was very good and came through well.  Delicious!

Wow!  These cakes are amazing.  I've been looking for an almond cookie for a while with no luck.  So glad that I decided to make these.  One think I would do is double the filling, I would have liked more.  I also filled some with apricot preserves, so yummy too!!!!  Definitely try this one, you wont be disappointed!

Great recipe. Really easy to make and the result is delicious.
I made 24 for the beginning and for in half of them I added white sesame seeds into the filling mix. Also I put in a whole blanched almond in each of them. It was great!

I doubled the filling. The tea cakes are a bit of trouble but they are wonderful! Thanks Janet for sharing this great recipe!

Ok, after all the work to get these things made I was prepared to give this a low rating because of what a pain in the butt it was.  HOWEVER, once I tasted them I had to give them five stars.  Delicious!  There are a few issues with the recipe however.  There is a massive amount of dough in this recipe, next time I will cut it in half.  I doubled the almond filling and I would recommend doing that.  Even doubling it I only had enough filling for half of the dough.  But, they are so good if you like almonds!

They were too dry for my taste.  I would cook a little bit less.
