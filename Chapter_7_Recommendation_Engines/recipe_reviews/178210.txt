OK-for all you who think this is too sweet...since AR editted my recipe, it's supposed to be made with DIET ginger ale, and clear schnapps, not the thick syrup-y kind. This is why your drink was way too sweet. I use Absolut Pear as well, and rim your glass with cinnamon sugar before pouring for an added touch!

I made this cocktail for a martini party this past weekend. I wanted something with a little fall pizzaz and this definitely did the trick. Everyone declared it their favorite as well as very dangerous; it was so smooth and fruity with just the right amount of tang vs. sweet. I couldn't taste the alcohol which made it even more appealing to me. :)
I used Simply Apple juice (it's really cider, not juice) because I like its tangy, earthy, autumn flavor but I think any organic, no-sugar-added apple cider would work. I think powdered cider/clear cider (it's supposed to be cloudy) /apple juice would be way too sweet. Also, I floated the apple slice in the drink so that could eat infused apple afterward.
I will definitely be making this drink quite often for the rest of the season. It's a lovely color, the fragrance is gorgeous, and it tastes wonderful. The only thing I'd change would be it's name; I'd call it something all fancy like Autumn Orchard Martini! :D

Very nice. I would have never thought of putting those ingredients together. It's almost like a fall punch, only with a kick. I used Absolute Pears vodka.

I generally drink only "straight" martinis, but decided to give this a try for Thanksgiving.  LOVED it!  Won't be my every day drink, but for a special occasion it's great.

I really enjoyed this easy to make festive-tini! Some more experienced drinkers thought it was too sweet, but for the holiday with a mix of company, they were fun and delicious!

This recipe was great!  We made it at our company fall festival and everyone loved it!  Definitely adds to it to have the cinnamon sugar rimmed glass!  We didn't put the apple garnish in, but don't think that affected the taste!  Thanks!

Delicious. Extremely. I didn't rim my glass, but I made it exactly as the recipe states, with a clear schnapps and Absolut pear vodka. I used regular ginger ale, but next time I will probably use diet. Perfect for our first cool fall evening after a HOT Texas summer. I'll making this one often.

I am normally not a big martini person but this was a fun thing to try. I made my own pear vodka by infusion the vodka with pears for a couple of days and then I bought the small 50 ml of the peach schnapps because I don't drink it otherwise. I am seriously considering buying the large bottles of vodka and schnapps and having a party! Very festive! :)

LOVE IT!!! Of course I added a little bit more of the vodka, but other than that delicious.  Can't wait to share this gem with friends for a cocktail party.

A great alternative to other fall martinis. Yes, do try it with diet ginger ale to lessen how sweet it is. I would also suggest lessening the amount of peach schnapps.

I left off the cinnamon sugar as this is sweet enough on it's own. The only pear vodka I could find was Grey Goose and it tastes fine to me. A very nice party drink.

These were fantastic.  I cut back a little on the peach schnapps and opted for a little more pear vodka.  I rimmed my glasses with cinnamon sugar.  Served some with ice in high ball glass.  Still great!  They go down so smooth....very dangerous.

This was WAY too sweet for my liking.  And unfortunately, too sweet for my guests as well.  It might be better with much less schnapps but I probably won't try it again.  I would recommend the Grey Goose Peartini if you're looking for a cocktail with these flavors.

This is a great cocktail. I made it as the modified instructions advised - with clear peach schnapps (not thick or syrupy) and diet ginger ale. I used Absolut Pear vodka. Interestingly, the pear flavor came through a lot more than the cider taste. Crisp, not too sweet, excellent.

I used regular ginger ale, unflavored vodka and cut back the peach schnapps to 1/2 oz. I think it's great!

I thought this was great! Perfect name for it too :o) I do think I'll use less peach schnapps next time so it'll have more of an apple flavor.

Made this last night for some guests. I took advice from one reviewer who said Simply Apple works in this recipe, since I couldnt find apple cider with no sugar added. I found that its the peach schnapps that is too sweet for my liking (yes even the clear kind). So I simply left out the peach schnapps and it tasted much better. Thanks!

I made sure to use clear schnapps & diet ginger ale. It was still so sweet that we couldn't drink it. We ended up pouring it down the drain.

These were very good, but a little sweet.  I just made individual drinks in a cocktail glass rather than martini glass and didn't shake it.
