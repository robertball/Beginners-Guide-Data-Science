When I first read through the recipe I was a little concerned about a lack of flavor. With that in mind I added a teaspoon of garlic along with the onions and mushrooms. I was really surprised at how flavorful the rice was! You can really taste the infused flavors in there. I also realized that I screwed up while making this. I used the entire pouch of the rice (not reading that the recipe only called for just 1 cup) but you know what? It worked! Even though I only used the 2 cups of water. This sure was quick to throw together as well!

This satisfying one pan dish is quick and easy perfect for those busy nights. I always slice the beef partially frozen for uniform and neat slices. Next time I will increase the rice/water ratio just a little because I would have liked a little more rice. This recipe is a keeper.

I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing different was the rice. I couldn't find what it called for so I substituted for an Uncle Ben's garlic and butter that was pre-cooked. It didn't have much flavor. I would have added more broccoli because that's how my husband likes it. I added some coconut aminos to add flavor w/o sodium or msg. I don't think I'll make it again.

It was amazing! I added a little garlic powder and my husband added red chilli sauce. Will definitely make again!

Even our 5-year-old cleaned her plate! The only things I changed were adding the onions first after the butter and our store didn't have the suggested kind of rice so I used Uncle Ben's Long Grain and Wild rice. Very delicious! I like how simple this was to throw together and that it only used one dish (I used our wok).

Followed recipe to the letter. I used thin sliced beef from Walmart. The beef was tuff but the rest of the recipe was real good. I think next time I make this I will use chicken.

A few suggestions would be to use a vegetable medley instead of mushrooms long grain rice and maybe a southwestern seasoning or spice to add heat to the recipe.
