These were very good- sauce kept the meatballs moist with a nice flavor. I did add an extra egg to the meat mixture for two reasons: I was using medium-sized eggs and my porcupines always fall apart. I'm happy to say that with careful turning they were perfect! The only thing I did different with the method, I put some of the sauce in the slow cooker, then added the porcupines, then the rest of the sauce. This was so I wouldn't have to turn or stir them so much.

Wow,the original recipe back in the 1960's was just the meat mixed with rice and cooked in canned tomato soup. Not much taste but easy and a cheap way to feed my growing family.What an improvement this recipe is . I hadn't made these in years but plan to use this recipe often.

Terrific recipe! I was trying to duplicate a lost family recipe, and this came very close. It actually had more flavor than ours, and was more convenient in the slow cooker! I didn't add the frozen pepper/onions, is the only thing I changed. Will make this again for a nice homestyle family meal. I like to serve with french-cut green beans and rice. Very yummy.

My husband and his coworkers have had the winter doldrums lately, so because it was Groundhog Day, I decided to send a double batch of porcupines.  This recipe caught my eye because it is specifically for slow cooker, which is what is great for work.  I confess I only used the sauce from this recipe but am so glad I did!  It was a HUGE hit, and the coworkers have informed me that they expect "groundhogs" with this sauce again next year on February 2.

This recipe brought back wonderful chilhood memories.  Mom always made these but used mushroom soup as the sauce.  She used the oven but I will make them in the crockpot.  Thanks for the memories!!!

The meatballs themselves were somewhat bland and I would spice more next time. THe sauce and cooking method was spot on and overall a win.

For real efficiency, I make about 5 batches at once on a weekend day. Once they are browned, freeze them in a zipper-freezer bag. In the morning, dump the whole frozen blob into your slow cooker, poor over the sauce and go to work. I switch up the veggies and leave the bay leaf out, add garlic. Doesn't really matter. Do it like Mom did except by freezing ahead you've got dinner on those busy week nights.

Sorry, but we found these meatballs to be quite bland and boring. If we get the urge to have ground beef with rice again, I will stick to stuffed cabbage rolls. Much tastier!

Strange how my experience was so different from others -- very bland meatballs that were strangely dry, considering all the time they spent in the sauce. Ended up mashing the lot together and making it into meat sauce, which was okay, but clearly not what we were expecting. Sorry, this just didn't work for us.

Excellent porcupine meatball recipe.  I liked the sauce much better than tomato soup.  Of course, I used some fresh onions and peppers, some smoked paprika and more garlic.  What I did notice in the video was that the pan used to brown the meatballs was not deglazed.  All that beautiful fond going to waste!  I took some of the beef broth and deglazed the pan and then added it to the sauce ingredients.  Can't say it made a huge difference, but I wasn't going to let all that flavor go to waste.

I thought this was an excellent recipe!  I followed the recipe for the most part, I added a little worshshire to the meatball, I didnt have basil so I added italian seasoning.  I was hoping that the balls didnt fall apart during cooking and they stayed together great! I thought they had great flavor. I served it over rice. Great recipe

This was an extremely good recipe! I substituted cream of chicken/cream of mushroom soup (undiluted) instead of spaghetti sauce. The rest of the recipe I followed was exactly as it reads. It was awesome.

My family loved this recipe and will definitely add to one of our favorites. I changed a few things; I used fresh basil and fresh cut onions and peppers, and I baked the meatballs instead of frying them. Also, I started preparing late in the day and cooked it on high for 4 hours in the slow cooker. Meatballs were still very moist.

Instead of frying I always bake my meatballs.  They end up firmer and never fall apart.  I doubled all the spices and this was a great recipe.

Great recipe. We used fresh asparagus rather than onion and green pepper stirfry. We ate this recipe as meatball sandwiches and had the asparagus on the side. Since the asparagus was cooked in the crock pot with the meatballs it was great together.

Pretty good recipe.  I used fresh veggies instead of frozen and added half a can of tomato paste, about 2 table spoons of sugar and twice the cayenne as they call for.  Served on hoagie buns and people loved it!  I'll for sure make it again.

Yum!!  I used a full cup of uncooked rice,  Italian herbs and some grated parmesan cheese in addition to the meat mixture ingredients. After browning , I placed in a slow cooker an  topped with diced green peppers,  2 jars of spaghetti sauce and sprinkled some sugar to cut the acidity. I cooked on high 1 hr and on low for 2 hours. Then put it on kept it on warm for another hour before dinner started. I served with garlic bread.. Hubby loved it.

The meatballs fell apart and they are very bland. It truly just tastes like watered down tomato sauce. I don't know why there is rice added to the meatballs either because it makes them mushy. Even adding spiced, I wouldn't make this again.

Late '80s a lady friend gave me a recipe for "Porcupine Meatballs" our family enjoyed it so much that I would make it twice a week. The one plus with this recipe is no hot oven in summer & it's simply "mix it together & forget it", can also freeze in smaller portions, a +++ meal.Delicous!

Recipe was easier than I thought it would be but not as flavorful as I thought it would be.  I will try again but maybe add some more spices or try a different pasta sauce.  On a good note, I made for a potluck and I didn't bring any home.

The taste was wonderful but the prep is time-intensive for something that could be done just as easily with stuffed peppers.  If you want to prepare it because you like the way it looks, go for it!  Otherwise, I would stick with some simple-to-make stuffed pepper recipe that could be prepared in a short time.

I baked the meatballs instead and it turned out so well. I took it to the school staff Christmas lunches and it didn’t make it through to the 2nd lunch because it was gone. Very good, will make this again..

Hmmm!
Friend gave me recipe late 90's very similar to this one, added bit more dried oregano & some hot sauce, served with garlic bread. Family request @ least twice per week (no leftovers).Recipe from the 50's friend said.
Enjoy & share.

I loved it. I made the meatballs 2" and browned them in my bella meatball maker. I used my own sauce and cut up fresh red and orange peppers in 1 1/2 inch wide strips. Adjusted the seasonings and it was fantastic. making it again tonight for my husband's work potluck

Delicious!  Sauce is so flavorful.  My meatballs were smaller (1 got 28 from 1.4 lbs), so I had no problem with them falling apart.  Have made 3 times by request!  Thank you!

These were awesome.  Used 24oz spaghetti sauce, petite diced tomatoes w/chilis, used italian seasoning in meatballsand added worchestor sauce to sauce.  3 cloves garlic in meatballs, skipped red wine and used fresh peppers and onions. May add more ingredients to make more sauce to use as gravy for mashed potatoes.  Loved it!

This was surprisingly good.  The meatballs did fall apart but it turned into more of a beef chili.  I used a larger jar of suace because I like sauce.  Served with biscuits.  Nice meal to have on a cool day.  Flavor has a bite that made it original.

Turned out great. Cooked in skillet instead of slow cooker.

If  you use a box of Beef flavored Rice-A-Roni, instead of regular rice, they will be much more flavorful.   I make them alot. 

Delicious!

The meatballs were not as savory as I was expecting, as well as being too crumbly. Next time I think I'll try using a meatloaf recipe for the balls and maybe instant rice (long grain was not ready at 6 hours on low). We also have lots of fresh veggies, so note to self: Dice the onions, precook/soften before adding to the crock.

My kids loved them over spaghetti, it does make a lot, I will divide them between 2 slow cookers to have one to freeze for later. I added some grated Romano cheese, to give them an extra boost of flavour. Overall s great success!

This meatball recipe was universally received with great cheers! I cooked it exactly as the recipe was written, but I did add a healthy dose of finely grated Romano cheese, which went well with the sauce and the pasta on which it was all served.

This was very basic and easy to make. It was a little bland, flavor-wise, but not a bad meal.

made exactly as stated....  it was "OK"... meatballs were moist, however pretty bland.  probably will not be making again.
