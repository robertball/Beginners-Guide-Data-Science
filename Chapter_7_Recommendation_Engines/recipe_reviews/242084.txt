The flavor is definitely tasty, and yes it does have a kick! The execution, however, is lacking. The dressing isn't really dressing...it's a thick guacamole-like consistency. I highly recommend NOT using  coconut oil. The reason: you have to melt the oil to get it into a liquid consistency. As soon as you add in your lime juice (if it was kept in the fridge), the whole thing firms/seizes right up because the lime juice is cold.  I had to thin the dressing with about 2tbsp of warm water to get it to a manageable consistency again. And then, even if I had started with room temp lime juice, once I mixed the dressing into the salad and it came into contact with the cold kale and cucumber, it clumped right back up. The result was a curdled-looking "dressing". Not pretty. While the coconut oil adds a nice flavor, it just isn't practical in this recipe and I would recommend using olive oil or another neutral oil instead.  Also, I prefer to "massage" the kale for a few minutes by rubbing it between my fingers to soften it up a bit - unless you like tough kale.  I might play with this recipe a bit to get it to my liking. Thank you for sharing your recipe bmwmom.

I've made this by mashing the avocado into the kale with my hands and omitting the oil.  I also use bean sprouts instead of cucumber sometimes.  Juicing a lemon over it is great!

This was just what I was looking for! I wanted a recipe for a salad dressing with coconut oil and I already had all the other ingredients. Yummy and so good for you!

LOVED this!  I have a ton of cucumbers and was looking for a light lunch, so this was perfect!  I used a homemade chile powder and may have been a little heavy handed with it, but I love spicy, so it was perfect for me :)
