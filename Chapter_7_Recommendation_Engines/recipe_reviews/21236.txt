My husband loved this recipe...and it was so easy! I took other reviewers' advice and decided to spice things up a bit. I added 1 tsp of cajun seasoning, 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and a dash of cayenne. It had just the right kick.

So quick and easy, it was fun to cook.  According to my family, it needs more flavor.

We modified this recipe from the getgo as we are on a low-carb diet - but we just LOVE it.  Instead of 1/2 cup cornmeal, I use 1/4 cup Keto crumbs, 2 tbs cornmeal, and 2 tbs seasoned bread crumbs.  I also use a tiny bit less salt and use olive oil instead of regular vegetable oil.  It's definitely one of our favorite recipes.  It's simple and quick to make and looks very elegant and it's easy to make in quantity so it's just as great to serve for company as to make for just the family.  Yummy!

Really easy and fabulous.  I added a couple tablespoons of COintreau for more orange flavor.  I got rave reviews.  Thanks Deborah!

Very good!  I had trouble with the pecans at the end because they burned, but it was probably my oven.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thanks.

Wow, this was excellent. I wanted more! Will definitly be making again. Even my 8 year old, a very picky eater, loved it and ate his entire portion....a rarity for anything served in this house. We will definitly be making again and again.

Pretty good once it is spiced up per other reviewers (cayenne, red pepper flakes and Cajun/Creole seasoning).  Not anything amazing, but something a little different to try.  Don't forget to give it a little squeeze of lemon juice!

I added the spicy cajun seasoning and creole seasoning..and red pepper and I guess I got a little too much.  It was very good but very spicy and we like spicy.,,however was a little too much. Next time I will cut back on the heat.

Great catfish recipe. Added some essence seasoning really gave it that kick, plus lemon pepper seasoning...came out really good will definitely bake my fish from now on...also served with roasted asparagus and baked russet potato chunks which went with the clean and light flavor of the fish perfectly. Easy recipe especially for beginners. Plus since seafood already has a good amount of iodine in it I used mortons fine sea salt instead of iodized table salt to season with crushed peppercorns.

This was so good!  I have always fried catfish, and was skeptical that it would get crispy enough in the oven, but it was perfect.  I took some other reviewers' advice and added 1 tsp. blackened seasoning, 1/2 tsp. Red Pepper Flakes and two dashes of cayenne pepper.  I also sprinkled both sides of the catfish nuggets with some lemon pepper seasoning salt before dipping it in the cornmeal mixture.  I doubled the recipe, so I cooked mine for about 25 minutes before everything was crispy enough.  I sprinkled the pecans on about 5 minutes before they were done, and wow were they good, definitely my favorite part.

This recipe is awesome, my husband loves catfish and loved this recipe.  I put the finely crushed pecans in with the cornmeal and sprayed olive oil pam over the top of the fish.  This recipe is a definite keeper.  Great alternative (& healthier) than fried catfish.  Also, very easy to prepare, less time in the kitchen.  Thanks for sharing such a delicious recipe Deborah.

Fast,Easy and Awesome! My whole family loved it! Which is rare! My hint though is season the fish with cajun seasoning before you dunk in cornmeal.

This was fantastic. I am not a big fan of fish, but this was great. It was perfectly cooked. I used a 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt & 1/2 tsp of salt.

I thought this was just o.k.  I don't think I like the comination of pecans and cornmeal.  I took others' recommedations and spiced it up a bit.  I used 1 tsp. cajun seasoning, 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes, and just a sprinkle of cayenne pepper.  I found it to be way too spicy, the rest of the family didn't seem to mind too much.  I have a similar recipe to this, minus the pecans, I'll probably just stick with that.  Sorry.

Easy to make, quick to make and tasted great!  I left out the lemon and parsley, because I'm not a fan of either.  Line the pan with foil for easier clean up.  Also, added a little extra black pepper.  Tasted great.

Very bland, like hospital food.  We had 7 people eating it. Both children disliked it and the adults gave it 1, 2 & 2.5 stars.  I imagine it would be much better to follow the reviewers' suggestions to spice it up, but I'll leave that to someone else next time.

It was very simple and tasted great. I added some spice to kick up the flavor a notch. But very good otherwise.

Wonderful way to prepare fresh catfish.  My husband and children agree that this recipe is a keeper.  Next time I will crush 1/2 of the pecans and put it in with the cornmeal coating and then sprinkle the rest on 5 minutes before the fish is finished baking that way the pecan flavor is uniform throughout the filets.

This is delicious.  I did add cajun seasoning to spice it up.  We will make this again.
