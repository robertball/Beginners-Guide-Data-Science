I've been making a similar recipe for about 30 years and for those of you that think this one may be a little bland, you might try it again using:
Can of Cream of Chicken Soup and a package of Herb Stuffing (such as Pepperidge Farm)instead. of the croutons.

The recipe I used had some of the stuffing mix on the bottom (which absorbs some of the liquid) and the rest of the stuffing mix on the top.

Cheese then would be mixed with the veggies.

Thank you so much for reminding me of this.

Also,if you microwave the veggies with a little water or steam them, they won't be watery.

My husband and I loved it! I used 16oz of Mozzarella cheese instead of the 8oz suggested. I would recommend mixing it in with the other ingredients rather than putting it on top so that you have the cheesiness throughout the whole dish. I also premixed the other ingredients before putting them in the casserole, it made it easier than trying to mix them in the baking dish.

The flavor was pretty good, but the recipe was confusing.  I assume you would drain the veggies after boiling...but how much of the veggies do you use?  My zukes are enormous right now...so saying use 4 chopped is misleading.  Should it be 4 cups?  Do you put the soup mixture over the top or should it all be completely mixed together and then put into the casserole dish.  It might have tasted better if the ingredients and directions were more exact.

This was amazing.  Everyone LOVED it, even non-veggie eaters.  I used fat free sour cream and croutons and low-fat soup and mozzarella cheese and only 1/2 the butter.  It was so creamy, everyone couldn't believe it was low-fat.  Will make it again and again.

This was delicious.  We used a combination of yellow squash and zucchini.  It was really pretty when it came out of the oven with the yellow, green and orange colors peeking through the cheese.  Next time we're going to try topping it with cheddar cheese.  We will make this again.

We really loved this recipe.  I took the advice from another reviewer and used Cr. of Chix instead of Cr of Mush.  My husband forgot to cover it so the croutons were crunchy which I actually liked.  Maybe next time we'll cover it and uncover for apx 15-20 mins at the end.  The croutons were kind of big so I will use seasoned stuffing next time.  VERY YUMMY!  And, in case you are wondering like I was, this was a meal in it of itself ... I didn't know if I needed to serve some meat with it...but this was definitely an entire meal.

My family really liked this! I used shredded zuke (bc thats what I had) and a box of stovetop instead of the crutons and I didnt have the soup so it was sour cream, butter, some water (as called for in the stuffing, but not much bc the zuke will release juice as it cooks) and cheese, in the oven with the ham for an hour. Even Miss Picky ate most of it and said it was sooooo good! Little Mr Picky did also. Thanks for a great way to get a veggie into my unsuspecting family!

I made this recipe using low-fat ingredients, mixed the wet ingredients before adding to the squash, crushed the croutons prior to adding to casserole and added some of the cheese to the mix and some for the topping.  We loved it!  I used 4 summer squash and two medium Italian zucchini.  I did not think the topping looked like it would be enough - but it was plenty.  I would not change a thing.  Enjoy!

Unfortunately we didn't like this recipe.  There were too many carrots, and although I only used half the croutons, the soggy consistency was pretty unpalatable.  Maybe using a little stuffing mix would be better, as the overall taste was pretty bland.  Sorry.

We didn't get too excited about this recipe.  I am going to try this again; mix the cheese in with the mushroom soup, and instead of croutons I am going to top with a mixture of stove top stuffing tossed with butter, leaving uncovered so the 'topping' will crisp up nicely.  Will probably only cook for about 40 minutes.

My family loved this recipe.  I made some changes.  I used yellow squash; only a half stick of butter and mixed the ingredients in a bowl (including the cheese before placing in baking dish.  I lightly salted and peppered the top. Easily serves 6 people.

This is quick,easy and very tasty! The only changes I made were to add some pepper,thyme and combination of yellow and zucchini. I may zip up a bit more next time I make it. Looks like we may sufficient squash product from our garden this year. Great vegetarian meal.

This turned out great! We like it because it's a different recipe and we like variety. My husband sugested to make it for Thanksgiving because it's so unique. My changes: I only used 1 onion, I used 2 zucchini and 2 yellow squash, and I added red bell pepper and a few cloves of garlic. I saw one review say that the veggies were mushy: I think you need to be careful to use only a little water when boiling. Also, when I first removed the dish from the oven, it looked watery, but after sitting for 5 minutes, it was fine.

I'm sorry, but we did not like this.  I took one bite and told the hubby and kids they didn't even need to eat their "try it" servings.  I wish that I'd just split the squash and baked it with olive oil and seasonings - that would have been a better use of the squash and much more enjoyable.  This was soggy bread mixed with melted mozzarella and bland squash.

My husband gave it 4.64 stars. Ha. So almost 5. I thought this was a very delicious recipe. I will definitely make again. If you use low fat ingredients its a bit healthier (obviously). Creamy & delicious!

Very good casserole. I gave it a 4 because I used herb stuffing mix in place of croutons & added sharp cheddaer cheese along with the mozarella.

This was edible, but not something I would care for again.  Maybe by me using light sour cream & decreasing the butter left it a little on the bland side.

This was ok, the flavor was good, not great, but good.  I used crushed croutons, and it was pretty mushy.  It also made a huge amount for a family of four.  I would definately cut this one in half.

Very good.  Even better as leftovers.  I cut the butter in half and added some salt and pepper.  I think next time I will put some crushed croutons on top of the cheese so that they will stay nice and crunchy.  If you like veggi casseroles, this one you must try.

We loved it. I suggest crushing the croutons and I added a dash or two of  vegetable seasoning for extra kick.

This turned out very good, I was out of butter so I used 1/2 c of mayo instead. I mixed the cheese into the casserole  other than that I followed the recipe. Will make again, great use of all that squash in the garden

Delicious and simple to make.  I added parmasean cheese and used chicken flavored stuffing instead of crotons.  Everyone loved it, I'll definitely be making this again!

This was just okay. Not bad but I have had better squash casseroles. Best the first day. Leftovers not as good.

So...a couple changes:  First, I only used  one and a half onions, no butter, and mixed half a cup of extra sharp cheddar into the soup mixture.  Also used low fat soup and sour cream, and fat free croutons.  Topped it with hazelnut meal, since that's what I had.

Given this, the recipe is tasty.  It's a little odd looking and tastes very comforting, nothing fancy enough for guests, but I would make it again--which is always the ultimate test.

This recipe was GREAT.  I used all of the lower fat substitutions and it turned out beautifully.  I prepared it as a side dish, but more of it got eaten than the main dish!

I modified this recipe to make it more of a main dish by adding small shell pasta, diced tomatoes and I used sharp cheddar and mozzarella.  Also I didn't put the crutons in the mix but instead I crushed them and sprinkled them on top with a little more cheddar.  It was so YUMMY we will definitely be having this again considering we have an over abundance of zucchini crop this year!

The portion on this said it was for 4 but I cut it in half and made it in a square pan. I served it with a salad and it was a good meal for 4. The family really liked it and they aren't zucchini fans! I also cut the butter and cheese down and used low fat sour cream to cut down the fat.

I liked it but, noone else did not even my husband. It made alot of casserole so it would be great to take to a social event. But, I won't make it again because I ended up throwing it out because even I got tired of eating it.

I would have given it 5 stars but it was a little watery due to the boiling instead of steaming the vegetables. It was tasty though. I guess it would have to be tasty with all those rich ingredients. I would make it again but I will have to use the lower fat version. i feel way too guilty eating this dish. Just too fattening. my husband liked it but after hearing the rich ingredients he took only a tiny bit.

This is a terrific recipe!  My husband loved it and so did I.  It's a real keeper!  I used 2 (8-inch) yellow summer squash and 2 (8-inch) zucchini and only 2 carrots (all I had).  I also forgot to cover the casserole while it baked and the cheese made a nice toasted crust on top after 40 minutes.  I rather liked it that way.  Next time I'll try it the right way and see if I like it even better!

This was great! I took the advice of another and used herd stuffing instead of croutons. I drained excess water from the veggies before mixing together and put some stuffing on bottom of pan to soak up any extra water. Did not come out soggy and made great leftovers!

This was good, but was a little watery, my guess is from boiling the squash & onion, maybe steaming would be better? I didn't care for the cheese on top, I'll omit that next time.  But it was good for a change from the normal side dish.  Thanks for that recipe!

This is a really tasty dish.  It's easy enough and relatively quick.  I made it for a potluck and received many compliments and requests for the recipe.  This dish is well received by non-vegetarians too!

I made this tonight. I steamed the onions and zucchini in a double boiler. I think I steamed too long( 10 minutes and then it sat while I mixed the other ingredients) but the taste was good. I made it as the recipe stated and just added a little thyme, mixed the cheese into the soup mixture and only used 1 large carrot.

I followed the recipe pretty close.    It had a good flavor but was somewhat soupy.   However it did firm up some after being out of the oven for 30 minutes.    I did add a teaspoon of basil and that was good in the recipe.     The recipe did note if you should melt the butter before you put it in the but I did in order to mix it through correctly.

I thought this recipe was great. Instead of grating the carrots, I just thinly sliced them in rounds. It was very flavorful, and the vegetables were not too mushy. I would suggest adding some salt in the recipe. Otherwise, you’re going to have to sprinkle some salt on it when you eat it since it really needs it.

I liked this very much.  I left out the onions and used low fat sour cream and low fat cheese.  I also omitted the butter to keep it lower fat,  and used some panko bread crumbs and 2tbsp Bragg's nutritional yeast flakes in place of croutons.  I used a combo of zucchini and summer squash.

Not a fan of this recipe.  I love squash, however, my family does not, so I'm always trying different recipes in the hopes of making it edible for them.  It's possible you could make a nice recipe out of this...w a number of adjustments, but as is, it's only so-so.  As is, it is very bland and croutons tend to be almost overwhelming.  Also, following the recipe, it comes out soggy...I personally can't stand soggy bread products.  If I try this again, I will make  adjustments  w some of the other recommendations and my own sense of taste and smell.

This is a 5 star plus recipe.  A sister in law of mine made this several years ago for a holiday dinner.  Everyone loved it.  I changed it up a bit for this past Thanksgiving dinner.  I sauteed the squash (I used Yellow summer squash in place of zucchini) instead of boiling it. Instead of sauteed onions I used a can of French's onion rings. Cream of Chicken soup instead of mushroom. Used 1/2 the amount of butter..  I also took the advice from another review and used a box of Chicken flavored stove top stuffing pouring half on the bottom and half on top drizzled with 2 tbsp of melted butter.  FABULOUS!!

Really tasty!  I added other vegetables - carrots, parsnip, cauli etc - and turned it into a meal in itself.
