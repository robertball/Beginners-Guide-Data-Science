This is GREAT recipe.  I am a pastry chef and I use it all the time.  The trick is to let it "set up" before you use the cookie dough (that is why some people have greasy cookies etc).  Butter has different qualities when it is hot and cold.  If you like crispy cookies refrigerate this dough then bake for a slighly longer time.  For softer cookies mix dough then let it harden up at room temp. Bake only until edges are set.  Finally measure brown sugar accurately--a little over and you will have FLAT cookies! Hope this helps! Thanks Allison for sharing:)

As soon as I saw the brown sugar/butter mixture, I knew this would be a fabulous recipe. I am a culinary student in Baltimore, MD, and I am always looking for new recipes. I am a baking major, so I am especially fond of cookies, pies, cakes, etc. 
But these cookies!!! The end batter is very uniform and not at all sticky. You can easily handle the batter with your bare hands for shaping or whatever. The end baked result is an even textured slightly 'butterscotch' flavored cookie with just the right ammount of sweetness and chewiness. The butterscotch flavor is in no way overpowering. It is just back in the background of the layers of flavor in this delectable cookie. Overall, 5 stars and a great end result. Well worth the time.

This was a quick easy recipe for chocolate chip cookies, but I wasn't happy with the results.  Most of my friends & I like the super soft type of chocolate chip cookies, but these cookies came out like floury scones instead of cookies that cooked up like little cakes instead of cookies with a high vertical measurement.  Also, I could taste the 1 teaspoon of baking soda throughout the batch.  The batter looked so good, I was hopeful, but I think a mix of butter & oil or butter & sourcream creates a better cookie softness.  1/2 teaspoon of baking soda is all that's needed, not a full teaspoon, since it was too much.  Vanilla extract would have helped take away some of the floury taste too, but that was missing from the recipe.  If you love scones, however, you may like this recipe.

These cookies were great! They turned out chewy and with a great flavor. My 2 favorite ingredients in chocolate chip cookie dough (other than the chocolate) are the brown sugar and the butter (hate shortening), so looking at the recipe I knew I had to try it. I added 1 tbsp vanilla and about 1/2 tsp salt, used bittersweet chocolate chips instead of semisweet, no other changes. I thought the bittersweet chocolate went well with the brown sugar dough by complementing its sweetness. The one I used was Ghirardelli Double Chocolate chips.  Thanks for the great recipe!

After reading all of the positive reviews for this recipie I gave it a try.  These cookies are very good, soft and chewy as promised.  They did not go flat when baked.  Yummy!

These cookies are scrumptious! I wanted to give them as Christmas gifts but my husband and kids kept eating them.  I add a teaspoon of vanilla and a half teaspoon of salt. Have also added cocoa to make chocolate chocolate chip -- yummy!

Mmm, these are so good! I was out of vanilla extract and was so pleased to find a chocolate chip recipe without it!

I think my oven might be off by a few degrees, but in any case, I kept having to adjust the temperature between batches because the bottoms of the cookies would come out burnt.  I finally found that 325 degrees F for 10 minutes worked best for me.

I only had one stick of butter, so I used half margerine, but these were AWESOME. They tasted even softer and chewier the second day. Someone said they reminded them of soft batch cookies and I have to agree. These are definitely worth trying if you like a soft cookie. They came out fairly flat, but looked just like I had gotten them from a bakery. The best looking cookies I have ever made.

Truly one of the best choc. chip recipes I've tried from allrecipes.  I did half the amount of brown sugar, but the flavor was truly delectable (perhaps the brown sugar, the use of butter rather than shortening, and the salt).  It was right on.  The consistency was slightly cakey...I'm still looking for the perfect cookie, one that's crisp on the edges and chewy inside.  However, on flavor alone, I would give this five stars.

These really are the Best cookies I've ever made. I followed CHRISCOOKS advice and let the dough  sit at room temperature for a while before baking. These turned out a little crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside, perfect cookies. Thanks for the recipe.

My son and I loved this recipe. I cut it in half and used a little less flour, but other than that I did not change a thing. They came out chewy and thin and absolutely yummy. Making more today!!!

i've tried a lot of cookie recipes and this one is great! i added at tsp of vanilla and 1/4 tsp of salt. they are crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and puff up nicely. i refrigerated the dough between batches so they didn't spread as much. will make again!

not THE BEST cookie ever, but pretty good.  I like how simple the cookie is, and how it doesnt require shortening, but it still turns out nicely.  I added a dash of salt and 1 tsp of vanilla. yum :D I'm definitely making this again

These cookies are my favorite!  I chopped up about 1 1/2 cups of mini Reeses cups instead of choc. chips and they turned out delightful.

These cookies deserve they're title! They are truly the best ever. My family won't even let me buy store bought cookies anymore. I have to keep a constant supply of the ingredients because they go so quickly. Soft, chewy and delicious. I've tried a few different recipes on here and these are definitely the best. Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe!!   Hope

These cookies had an excellent texture (chewy!!) but I thought they were way too sweet and that they had no real taste to them beyond the sickening sweetness. Still, I loved the texture and tried another batch and this time added a teaspoon each of salt and vanilla, 1/2 cup less brown sugar, and used 3/4 cup each of chocolate and butterscotch pieces (to play on the underlying butterscotch flavor another reviewer mentioned). They turned out great!! I love melting the butter and not having to wait til it's softened to start making the cookies!

These cookies are wonderful!  I've made them a few times and always get asked for the recipe.  The only change I made is that I bake them for 8 minutes only and remove them immediately from the oven.  Once removed, I don't let them stay on the cookie sheet for more than a minute before moving them to cool on a wire rack.

The best chocolate chip cookies I've ever made............However, you may need to slightly reduce the amount of all purpose flour in the recipe. Reduce the flour so the dough is somewhat wet. If dough is somewhat dry (as followed by orig. recipe)... cookies will turn out dry and flavorless.

Soooooo goood! Have a recipe simular to this one, but it uses margarine. This one is great if you have real butter. Knew it would be great using all brown sugar! I don't even bother with the ones that have white sugar in them for chocolate chip recipes. I added 1 tsp salt & 1 tsp of vanilla, personal prefrence. The chewy-ness is awesome! Thanks for great recipe!

This is definitely a five star recipe! The brown sugar is perfect for achieving the right sweetness, and it can be easily modified for how chewy or crispy you like your cookies. I have to stop my family from eating all of them.

This is bar none the best chocolate cookie recipe I have ever made.    After reading some of the other reviews I too used 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 tsp. of salt and they turned out divine.   For kicks and grins I also added 3 tbsp of cocoa, next time I think I will double that amount.   My husband kept eating them exclaiming, " I can't get enough of these cookies."   Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This was the perfect choc chip cookies recipe. I made it with 21 little girls tonight (Sparks and Brownies, grades K-3) and it was easy enough for them to make with very little supervision, and they came out tasting superb. The recipe halves very successfully (each group of girls made a half-batch). Thanks!

This is a great recipe!  I have been looking for a good chocolate chip recipe for years and I am so happy to have found this one.  I did make a couple of alterations (left out baking powder and did not melt the butter), but all in all this recipe is wonderful as written.  My cookies came out soft and chewy, but not cakey.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Gosh, after reading so much praise about this recipe.  I hate to say, but I was disappointed.  It was an extremely simple recipe.  They are the most attractive CCCs that I have ever made.  I think they have the best texture too, slightly crisp edges with a chewy middle.  However, they just didn't taste that good to me.  I first tasted the dough and I was like...ugh, I hope the cookies are better.  Unfortunately, they didn't.  I used the grocery store brand chocolate chips(because they were on sale).  So, I might try this recipe with Tollhouse chips.  If the cookies taste the same, I will not use this recipe again.  I'll let you know.......

Pretty good cookies and easy to make--don't need to use mixer when you melt the butter.  The downside was that they spread out a lot.  The taste was good and they were very chewy.  I still like the best big fat chewy chocolate chip cookies from this site better, though.

i actually really liked this recipe.  my partner found them to be "ok".  they are not like the typical chocolate chip cookies as usually they have more of a "flour/doughy" taste to them (white sugar and usually more flour to them) and are thicker, these ones had a sort of nutty flavor to them and weren't so doughy.  
but if you are looking for a typical chocolate chip recipe i don't really think this is it.
they are good but different.

I'm impressed.  They're delicious.  As many others have mentioned, the only modifications I made were adding a tsp of vanilla extract and a pinch or two of salt.  Someone mentioned adding a bit of molassas and I might try that sometime.  At any rate, I've got a new default chocolate chip cookie recipe!  Thank you!

These were alright. They tasted OK but not what I was looking for. I wanted a nice puffy, soft cookie but these flattened out completely. I did add about a tsp of vanilla. I'll keep on looking for the best ever recipe.

I try new chocolate chip recipes regularly and these are as simple to make as they are delicious!  I also like to top the cookie dough once on the cookie sheet with walnuts.  Adding the walnuts last allows them to toast while the dough bakes.  Yummy!

I've made this twice. Once with plain Semi-Sweet chocolate chips, and the second with Half Semi-Sweet, half Ghirardelli 60% cacao Chocolate Chips and a tablespoon or two of Pure Vanilla Extract.  Personally I liked the second batch better, and I even have some left over dough from the three dozen cookies this recipe is supposed to yield.  I think I'll turn that into a giant cookie later on.

I tried this recipe for the first time, and they were very easy to make! (The dough felt exactly like store-bought refrigerator dough, interestingly enough) They baked perfectly, and looked beautiful. They are a very sweet cookie, and I think I may take some of the advice here, and add salt.  Be sure to serve with ice cold milk. Thanks for the recipe.

These are, by far, the best cookies I have ever baked. I think the brown sugar makes them. The only changes I made was that I didn't melt the butter. I just creamed it together with the brown sugar at room temp and these turned out fantastic! Oh, also used milk chocolate chips because they're the best. Great recipe!!!!!

With improvements, this was a 5 star recipe, but written as it is, only about 3 stars. First off, the texture and appearance of these are great without any changes, but the flavor isn't quite there. To make them flavorful, I added a pinch of salt, half a teaspoon of vanilla, half a teaspoon of coconut extract, and a cup of coconut flakes. I also only used one cup of chocolate chips. If you don't want to have coconut flavor in your cookies, leave it out and add one teaspoon of vanilla.

These chocolate chip cookies were GREAT! I was so suprised that they actually turned out because I have tried many different recipes and I never got good results. They were also soooo easy. I didn't need  two or three seperate bowls, just 1 and I did all the mixing by hand. *I added some salt and they were perfect.

These are pretty good cookies!  I decided at the very last minute to make a dessert and needed something really quick and easy that I could throw together with ingredients in my pantry.  This recipe fit the bill perfectly.  It took just minutes to whip up the batter and get the cookies in the oven.  After 8 minutes they came out crispy on the edges and soft in the middle-- just perfect.  For simple, no-fuss cookies these are pretty great.  I'd make them again.

These cookies are DELICIOUS!  And I can be a tough critic when it comes to chocolate chip cookies.  I added 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp vanilla as some of the other reviewers recommmended.  And I used m&ms instead of chocolate chips for fun.  Yummy!

HANDS DOWN the best chocolate chip cookie recipe ever.  a couple suggestions:  -Add a few pinches of salt (id say 1/4 to 1/2 tsp) for better flavor. trust me on this. these cookies do not need vanilla.  Freaking tasty cookies! A word of warning: these are addictive and go very well with banana. I've been looking for a soft chocolate chip cookie that stays soft. I found it! The brown sugar is the key. Also, this recipe doesn't call for any salt, so throw in a few pinches, I'd say around half a teaspoon.   Also, for those of you experiencing texture difficulties, make sure you stir the brown sugar and the butter together THOUROUGHLY before adding the flour mixture. It should not be grainy anymore.   Happy Baking! :)   update: just made these for like the 50th time. still as great as ever!

I changed the recipe around a bit, replacing 2/3 cp of the all-purpose flour with cake flour, and using 1 cp dark brown sugar, .5 cp light brown sugar and .5 cp white sugar, and these cookies turned out AMAZING. Definitely the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever made. So soft!

I've made this at least one hundred times - everyone asks me to bring them for parties, etc.  They are delicious and sooo easy.  Letting the dough "set up" for a few minutes after mixing is a great suggestion.  These look like professionally made cookies and taste great.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yum! I didn't think these cookies would turn out but they did! I even reduced the amount of butter to 2/3 cup and it still tasted amazing. Nothing else was changed. No floury taste. These cookies did not taste like scones either. Those that complained that theirs tasted floury probably measured their flour wrongly. You'll never regret making these cookies!

These were okay, but I do prefer my cookies with less grease and more taste.  Also not as soft as I prefer. I've thrown everything but the kitchen sink in mine, using a different recipe.  Suggest:  raisins or other dried fruits, nuts, coconut flakes, and lots of chocolate...chips or chunks.

My boyfriend's favorite - I usually make half a batch and add a little vanilla and salt.  They're also great heated for a few seconds in the microwave.

These cookies are wonderful!! If you keep them airtight, they'll stay chewy for up to two weeks (if they last).
I added vanilla, and use wax paper instead of parchment paper. I also throw in whatever chips are handy -- cinnamon, butterscotch, chocolate or any mixture I'm in the mood for. 
Absolutely the best recipe I've found!

After trying another back of the bag recipe and failing, I found this one and it is The Best!  Chewy and so good. I did put in salt and vanilla.  They get nice cracks on the top and have that shine that good cookies have.  I put the dough in the fridge for just a few minutes (2 or 3)like another reviewer said just until it was cool, because I was afraid they'd be flat since the dough was so soft, they turned out perfect and I won't be wasting my time or money anymore on recipes that don't turn out.

These were very easy to make, and came out practically perfect. They tasted excellent! The only thing that I would change, is that the waxed paper soaks up some of the butter, and the cookies were a bit crumbly, but still great!!!

They were not the "best" I've ever ate but they were good and pretty easy to make. I did add 1/2 tsp. vanilla and a couple of dashes of salt like someone suggested. My first batch flattened out and ran together. My daughter than rolled them into balls and they came out wonderful. Did not use parchment paper but simply sray with Pam and it work just as well.

These are the best ever chocolate chip cookies I've ever had! I'm not a big fan of the original  Tollhouse recipe so I'm always looking for a different one. My husband loves chocolate chip cookies and it seems like I'm always making them so I wanted a recipe that I was fond of too! And I've found it!!!      Thanks for the great recipe!

I had previously overlooked this recipe while trying to find a good chocolate chip cookie recipe because of it's simplicity. I tried it today and was very impressed. The real butter gives it a wonderful flavor. I liked the texture....crispy outside and soft inside. I will make this recipe again!

I made this recipe as close as I could to the instructions.  Since it does not say "unsalted" butter, I assume salted is supposed to be used (I usually bake with unsalted & add salt when needed). Also, the recipe does not call for any salt... 
In this case I used 1/2 unsalted & 1/2 salted butter (needed to add a little more salt once I tasted the dough).  I didn't sift the flour (& that turned out to be correct). I am usually a flour sifter :)  The flavor was OK.  I did add vanilla - I can't imagine baking lots of things without it & chocolate chip cookie recipes are one.  I still like my chocolate chip cookies better, but in all fairness, I should make these again using all salted butter and perhaps deleting the vanilla to see if I would love these as much as everyone else does.

Loved this recipe! It actually yielded 3 dozen cookies (actually 9 dozen, I tripled the recipe!); I found this astounding because generally I find i usually get less cookies than the recipe says. Anyways, I baked these from a university class of mine and during the process I had to fight off my Dad and my boyfriend! Only think keeping this from a 5 star recipe is that they fell flat, and that was after refrigerating the dough. They did stay chewy though!

Good cookie, just wouldn't say best ever. Made these per recipe; put the dough in fridge for a bit before spooning onto cookie sheet, and in between batches - this made the bake time closer to 12 minutes. They came out crispy on the outside and buttery soft on the inside. I better go and try another just to confirm my review ;-) Thanks for the recipe!

Thank you, thank you, thank you! This is the best CC cookie ever! I love that it is uncomplicated and that the cookies turn out with such a great shape and fullness. They don't flatten out like so many other recipes. And so easy! This is one of my new classic all-time favorites.

This is pretty much the same as my own recipe I've formed/adapted out of other recipes, and the 100% brown sugar is definitely the way to go.

When I have consistency issues, I usually just balance it out with a slight bit more flour (1/8-1/4 cup or so).

Other than that, I also use 1 tsp vanilla essence and 1+cup shredded coconut.

Oh-my-chewy-chocolatey-goodness!!!  These cookies were delicious! Followed recipe precisely - except to add 1/2 tsp vanilla extract.  That's it.  They turned out fluffy (a little over 1/2 inch in height), very soft, perfectly golden brown, very light.. not heavy at all, which is the way we like them.  I think I put in more chocolate chips than called for... I just dumped the last of the bag in.  Husband loves them.  Says throw the other recipes away.

Amazing!  I added the salt and vanilla as some others suggested.  So delicious.  Almost the perfect CC cookie.  I want to say it IS the perfect CC cookie, but you never know.  So simple to make too! I'll definitely be making these again.

MMMMMMMMM...I finally found a great choc chip recipe. Moist, chewy and the cookie dough is just as good. I sometimes add a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and same for salt.

I wouldn't go as far as saying that these are the best CCC's ever. I did use whole wheat flour which may have made a difference in the way these turned out... not sure this is one I will keep.

This is my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe. This recipe gives a golden brown outside with a chewy inside, not a soggy cookie. I made a couple of changes: I used softened butter, not melted, and I did not have parchment paper, so I used non-stick bakeware--no problem with either change.

Good, but not the best. I added vanilla and milk as suggested. I also carefully measured the brown sugar and let the batter sit at RT for a time to firm up the batter for soft cookies (as the pastry chef suggested), but these cookies didn't come out any better than those with my two favorite CCC recipes.

the cookies turned out hard and not well at all.. they were OK, but they were DEFINATELY not the best cookies i have ever tasted. I was dissapointed when they were done, because the center or the cookie was only soft for the first five minutes after taking it out of the oven. (because it was hot then).

Hope this helps, Mary Helen.

There cookies are wonderful.  I formed them with an ice cream scoop and cooked a bit longer.  Definitely let them cool on the cookie sheet or they will fall apart.  Better and chewier the 2nd day.

This makes a great cookie.  I didn't add anything - didn't use the parchment paper...just buttered the sheets.  And they came out great.  They didn't go flat and they didn't fall apart.  PERFECT!!!!!

This recipe was easy and the cookies tasted great! I ate more than I should have. I did add a little bit of vanilla to add some more flavor and since I love nuts I also added some chopped walnuts. I'm sure you'll enjoy these yummy cookies.

I loved the texture of these cookies, and also how well the spread out while baking.  I did however find them a little less sweet than what I prefer.  I will probably make these again and add some vanilla, to see how that works.

I have a confession to make- I never get 36 cookies out of the batch. More like 30. You see, I end up eating some of the dough before they even hit the cookie sheet!. These are yummy ! The only change I made was to add a litttle vanilla as others have stated.

Wow!  I have made friends and a name for myself with these cookies.  I am now known as the "cookie girl" with the "best chocolate chip cookies ever!"  Thank you so much for submitting this recipe.  Make sure not to over stir these cookies, to avoid flattening.  Baking on parchment paper also improves them.  
Also, I was wondering if anyone knew if it was ok to freeze the dough, or freeze the baked cookies?

Excellent! I have made these 3 times in 8 days and the family wants more!  I bake them on a pizza stone for overall eveness.  I also made these into teeny bite-sized cookies (8 min) for my sons' lunch - this way he can have 5.

these are the best chocolate chip cookies i've ever made. they're perfect if you think regular chocolate chip cookies are slightly too sweet. i also add about 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the recipe to add a little something. the recipe makes a great cookie pie. i just press the dough into a round pan and bake it for 15-20 min.

Good standard recipe.  I'd just as soon use the recipe on the bag of chips, though.  Nice flavor and my 7 year old loved them (that's what it's all about, isn't it?).  Thanks.

These are the best ever chocolate chip cookies -- and I don't even like chocolate chip cokies. They are soft and chewy, and the brown sugar gives them a little toffee type flavor. Maybe I will try adding heath bars next time. Great recipe.

Great cookies! I think the dough does better after a bit of chilling, especially if your kitchen is warm.  You do not want the cookie melting before it cooks! This may be what went wrong for those who've had bad luck with this recipe.

Excellent cookies. Quick and easy....and the best part.. don't have to take out my mixer. A whisk (and wooden spoon when mixing flower) does it all....If you like soft and chewy then try this recipe!

Great taste! Chewy when cooled and a couple days old - if they last that long!! Definitely think the brown sugar is the key to it's yummy, chewiness!

These were the BEST chocolate chip cookies ever!!  My husband and our three children gobbled them up.  Before the last cookie was eaten, our 11 year-old asked me to please make more!!  Very moist and delicious.

It was hard to find a recipe that my husband liked, but this took was the one he liked.  I wanted to get a cookie recipe that I could make a from scratch, without having to buy the Tollhouse version.  Well this is just as good.  I enjoyed making them!!!

I've been looking for the perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe and I think I've found it! These cookies were so easy to make, and the dough was a nice texture that made them easy to handle. The end result was soft, chewy, thick cookies.

My husband fancies himself to be a chocolate chip cookie dough afficionado, and rated this recipe not only #1 in baked cookies, but says it's the best chocolate chip cookie dough he's ever had ~ beats the Tollhouse recipe hands down!!

I've made this recipe twice.  It is fast and easy.  I picked it because it used very few ingredients.
The second time I made it with a combination of peanut butter chips and chocolate chips.  My husband raved about the cookies.

I made it exactly according to the directions.  The cookies were tasty, but no more than any other chocolate chip cookie.  The were flat and mushy inside, even after being baked for the allotted time.  They weren't underdone, just mushy.

These were terrible. I've made many much more complicated cookies and used this recipe because i was looking for something quick and easy. They came out more like fluffy scones as someone else described. I let the dough set up at room temp and have never had this problem before. They are so bad I might just throw them away.

I veganized these and they were still amazing. I used the "neat egg" (chia & garbanzo mix), earth balance vegan butter, and non-dairy chocolate chips. I also subbed in some wheat germ for flour (so 2/3 cup wheat germ & 2 cups flour), oatmeal for chips (so 1 cup choc chips & 1 cup oatmeal) and added 1 tsp salt & 1 tsp vanilla like others suggested. I took out of oven promptly at 8 minutes and when they solidified they were so delicious and chewy. Thanks for this recipe!

I followed the suggestions of adding vanilla, and lowering temp to 325 for 10 min.  These cookies were great!  I used salted butter (which gave more flavor).  They were crisp on the outside and chewy in the middle.  But they don't stay chewy.   One day old cookies are more crisp than chewy but they are still delicious! 
I had no issues with flat cookies or cookies that were to biscuit-y.  If you want a chewier cookie try playing with the time/temp.

I found it way too rich! Aa little bit less brown sugar it would have been a little bit better. I also found it a little too dark inside because of the brown sugar, it didn't look cooked.

Rating is for flavor and texture. The recipe should indicate what size spoonful and how far apart to place them. The cookies stuck to the parchment paper and some were not salvageable. I was very frustrated with the entie experience after removing them from the oven. Probably won't use this recipe again.

I have made hundreds of cookies and this one is my favorite.  Everyone loved it.  I did change the butter and used half butter and half shortening instead (I think it helps them be thicker and chewier).  I also used half semi sweet chips and half white chocolate.  Will definitley make them again and again.

Delicious.  I used Earth Balance instead of butter (dairy allergy) and had to add an additional 2/3 cup of flour.  Without the flour they were nearly runny - could be due to the water content of the Earth Balance.

these certainly were nothing to write home about. They tasted pretty basic (even with adding some vanilla) BUT texture was perfect for me and my husband but I will probably try to find a better recipe next time. and hopefully one with less butter!

Flat, flat, flat!! My cookies turned out very flat, and underdone even after baking for 11 minutes. I will not make this recipe again.

My house wasn't personally impressed with these cookies. I've tried them a few times, and each time they were not liked. I can't honestly say what it was (it's been awhile since I made them), but something was just off.

These stayed soft and chewy.  The flavor was ok.  Not the best I have made.  Good if you want a soft, chewy cookie.  I prefer mine a little crip on the outside and chewy in the middle.  Also the brown sugar flavor was very stong in this recipe.  Wouldn't make again.

I'm sorry, but I did not care for this recipe. The batter looked great, the finished cookies looked great, but there is definitely far too much flour and not enough sugar going on. Definitely won't be making these ever again.

Really, really fantastic cookies!!! These are the best I've ever made or tasted! I used only 2 cups of flour, as well as 1 tsp. of vanilla, 1/4 cup white sugar, and 1/4 tsp. salt.   I highly recommend using Ghirardelli chocolate chips; they melt more thoroughly and evenly than Nestle chocolate chips. Melted, Ghirardelli chips ooze chocolate throughout the cookie. I used Ghirardelli Bittersweet chocolate chips, and I made two batches: one with just chocolate chips, and the other with chocolate chips and dried cranberries. The balance of bittersweet chocolate and dried (but sweetened) cranberry was amazing! I think these would also be amazing with dried cherries. YUM. Try with milk or with Good Earth tea (with spices that bring out the chocolate flavor). The cookies are crisp on the outside, buttery, and chewy throughout. The Ghirardelli chocolate chips create puddles of chocolate. They're the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever eaten! Thank goodness for my gym membership!  Note: If your cookies spread too much as mine did, put the dough in the refrigerator for at least an hour before baking. :) Enjoy!

Definitely NOT the best ever.....these came out very thin. They WERE chewy, but I guess I just prefer a cookie with a little more thickness....I had the ingredients on hand, and they were quite easy to make though.

Excellent recipe. The dough has great consistency, so you can shape it into small balls before placing on cookie sheet which makes the cookies nice, round and even. Awesome taste.

Very nice cookie.  I like the texture.  I did feel as if the cookie was missing something, maybe salt or possibly I should have used dark brown sugar.  I also added 1tsp of vanilla.  All together, yummy, and will make again.

These are the bst cookies I have ever made. I usually eat the dough and my husband gets the cookies, but he might not get either this time. I used Demerara style brown sugar instead of regular brown sugar so there was a slight mollasses flavour which added to the flavour.

Yum. I love the way the brown sugar helps to make these nice and flat, yet not too crispy. I made them with toffee chips instead of chocolate chips, and they are wonderful. If you make these, make sure you leave a lot of space between your cookies because they'll spread out. Thanks Alison!

I read all the reviews for this recipe and couldn't wait to make them. What a disappointment!The cookie dough was almost a cake batter. They came out flat, hard,and crispy. Make sure you use the parchment paper, I had quite a time scraping these off the cookie sheet. I decided to add some flour to the second batch that went into the oven but that didn't help very much, and yes I followed the recipe exactly..except for the parchment paper because someone said that made the cookies dry...Well hope you all enjoy peanut brittle a la chocolate chips!!!!!

These are the best chocolate chip cookies! They taste just as good as the urban legend chocolate chip cookies (the ones with the blended oatmeal) but these are so much easier to make. I also added 1/2 tsp. each of vanilla and salt, as well as 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts. Wonderful recipe, we'll be using this one often!

My friend and I made these cookies together, and we both agreed that they cam out horribly. We followed the directions to the letter, and the end result was crunchy, sticky, lumpy cookies. Perhaps we are the only ones at fault, but I will not make these cookies again.
