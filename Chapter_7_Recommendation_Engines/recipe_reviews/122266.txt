I really like this recipe.  It's quick and I really like the chili powder taste.  I think it could use a little more chili powder (which I'll use next time).  It might also use 1 1/2 tsp of sugar.  The sauce has a strong tart tomato flavor.  Other than that, it was great.  My four year old loved it!

I found this to be not much different from spaghetti w/meat sauce. I don't think I'll ever make again.

This was a big hit here. For something that cooked up in one pan, used very few ingredients, and was so economical, this was really WOW! I had a larger can of juice so I used all the juice and then added only a little water instead. This would be great for camping too and so much better than the dry package mixes. Nice tomatoey flavor, lots of sauce. Easy and fairly quick too. Thanks for the post!

Added 2 additional Tbsp. of chili powder, a can of kidney beans, and topped with cheddar instead of parmesan. Very similar to hamburger helper or canned spaghetti.

WE LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!  This has been on the weekly menu since I found it in my search to use up a bottle of tomato juice about 6 months ago!  The taste is wonderful - just a little spice with the chili powder.  It is a much fuller taste than bottled sauce.  We don't care for beef, so I use vegetarian crumbles - they are perfect!  I don't usually have garlic salt, so I sub in garlic powder with no problems and leave out the onion because my husband doesn't like it.  I, too, was worried that the spaghetti wouldn't cook, but it does just fine, and it has never taken me the full recommended 30 minutes of cooking.  Be sure to use a deep skillet - it can get a little messy.  Served with an Italian bread, this is a quick and filling meal.  Even my picky two-year-old has seconds and thirds!  Thanks!!!

This was quite good. Instead of the tomato juice I used diced tomatoes in their own juice. Could have used a bit more flavor from something, but I will likely make it again... I just need to buy a bigger skillet! Thanks for the recipe!

This was excellent! My kids are extremely picky and they had thirds! It's great because there are no chucks of anything but beef. I served it with garlic toast and a salad. This will become a regular at our house.

Quick and easy!  I stirred in 1/2 cup ketchup at the end (trust me, it is good) and added a little more salt. I also browned the ground beef with 1/2 small onion diced and still added the dried onion flakes to the sauce. Served with salad and tossed some ciabatta on the panini grill and brushed it with brushetta falvored olive oil! Dinner in 30 minutes!

Pretty good. My husband liked it and even my fussy my two year old enjoyed it. I used ground turkey instead of beef and added a can of tomato sauce to the recipe.

If you like food spicy, try adding chili seeds to this receipe. I use this instead of the chili powder or you can use both. Great receipe. Big hit with all my kids.

I LOVE this recipe so much!!! First, it's incredibly easy, wholesome ( I use all organic ingredients), healthy and does not have cheese in it for my dairy allergy! My kids gobble it up which is miraculous! I make it ususally once a week not changing a thing! My whole family is thrilled when this is dinner! THANK YOU!

I cooked as is, but had to add fresh basil from the garden at the end. After the 30 minute simmer with the cover on I let it simmer about 10 minutes with the cover off.  It was very watery when I first took the cover off and needed to thicken up a bit. The leftovers were even tastier. Just make sure you have a skillet big enough for this.

I couldnt fit it all into my skillet and barely fit in the saucepan. This turned out to creamy. Not a hit with the husband. It was just alright to me.

Big, BIG hit in our house with 4 semi-picky eaters.  I was leery of cooking the spaghetti in the dish, didn't want mush, but I'm so glad I did.  The spaghetti was very soft, and the flavors blended nicely.  Great dish for the kids.

It is a great recipe for spaghetti. I did change a few things though.

Substituted 

Ground Turkey for Ground beef.
2 cans diced tomatoes and a can of sauce       for tomatoes ingredients.
Real onion and garlic.
Chicken stock for water.
Added sliced mushrooms

Turned out great.

Very good. Went together quickly as I already had a pound of browned ground beef in the fridge.  (Just had to heat up a few minutes in the microwave, put it in the skillet and proceed with the recipe.)  Made as specified except left dehydrated onion out as made it for my 6 yr old niece and myself.  She loved it! Asked me to make it again the next time she comes over.  My husband will get the leftovers for work and I'm sure he'll enjoy it too. Thanks for this recipe, I really enjoyed it.

Yum!! Don't leave out the sugar - you'll miss it.
