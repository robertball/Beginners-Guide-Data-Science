Not bad. Instead of soda, I just used a little lemon juice. Subbed toasted walnuts for the pine nuts. I tried the raspberry dressing and liked using a plain balsamic from Trader Joe's better. Nice presentation.

Made it twice, once according to directions, once 'my way'. It was very nice as rated, but got more compliments on my version.  Used goat cheese instead of feta, made spiced candied walnuts instead of pine nuts, and made my own lemon viniagrette instead of bottled dressing.  Omitted soda completely.  Great with romaine as well.

Great salad!  My advice if this is your first time is to follow the recipe and use "real" pears.  I used canned pears and they were mushy. Didnt have pine nuts so I made candied pecans, which was excellent!  I also prefer bleu cheese, but the feta was a nice change (Still gunna use bleu next time, as its a personal favorite).  All in all, yummy!

This was very good. I prepared the salads individually on salad plates and fanned the pears for a more elegant look. Everyone really enjoyed this salad.

I think this salad is PERFECT!! Very easy and quick to prepare, and just flat out excellent! :)    I do agree though, that the soda could easily be omitted. I just sprinkled the pears with lemon juice, and it turned out great!

I make this all the time now and not only do I love it, so does my boyfriend who is avidly anti-healthy food. It's easy. I made it without the soda and I admit it was slightly less good that way. I used Diet Sprite and it was tasty.

This recipe was great when I used shaved iceberg lettuce (hold the head of lettuce with one hand and cut crisp, cold lettuce into very thin strips). Go easy on the feta so it does not overpower the raspberry flavor. Partygoers love this light and easy-to-eat salad.

Like another reviewer I simply used lemon juice on my pears.  I made my own homemade raspberry viaigrette dressing and used red onion instead of the shallot.  We served it with grilled peppered sirloin and it was wonderful.  Sure wish I had too many pears!!!

A very nice salad, especially when pears are in season. I did not use the soda; just sliced the pears at the end. I used a mixture of both spinach and romaine as I am not a huge fan of spinach. The feta adds a nice saltiness that balances the flavors of the dressing. Nuts add a great crunch. I will make this again.

Easy to prepare this  delicious blend of flavors that complement each other so well. I substituted toasted pecans for the pine nuts.  Also cut the pear last and served.  No soda available to soak.    I enjoyed the change from our typical dinner salad.

Pumpkin seeds are a cheap alternative to pine nuts. Blue cheese pairs better with pears
