Great kid food! The only thing I did different was use pizza sauce and instead of putting the biscuits inside the muffin tins, I flipped the tins over, sprayed with nonstick spray and molded the biscuits on the outside.  I put them on every other cup so they wouldn't touch and bake together.  When they were very lightly browned I took them out of the oven, lined them up on a cookie sheet, filled them, topped them with cheese and put them back in the oven for a couple of minutes for the cheese to melt.

So simple and very good!  After reading the reviews, I tried several different displays.  
**I followed the recipe and used a whole biscuit in the muffin pan and they turned out fine, a little biscuity to me.  
**In another, I only used half of a biscuit in the muffin pan and this turned out great.  
**On a cookie sheet, I flattened out a biscuit and used it as a biscuit base with toppings and that was TERRIFIC!
**Lastly on the cookie sheet, I used half a biscuit as a base with toppings and turned out good.
I will definitely make this recipe again.  My 4 year old loved the little "pizzas."

I made these for my wife and kids and they loved them.  I did half in muffin cups and half flattened out on a cookie sheet with toppings on top.  I used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar.  we liked the ones on the cookie sheet best.  Thanks for a great recipe.

My husband took one bite and with his mouth still full exclaimed "Phenomenal." We loved it and it was so easy.  I used mushroom garlic prego pasta sauce and added black olives, dried minced onions, chili powder, cumin, and parsley. I overflowed the cups with the meat mixture and doubled the cheese. They turned out great!!!

Instead of using spahetti sauce, I used a package of taco seasoning, then put taco sauce and sour cream on the top.  Very good!

BEST FOOTBALL GAME DAY FOOD I'VE EVER MADE!!! was a great hit with the Men and children alike. So easy to make. I of course added my own seasoning to the sauce to kick it up a bit. Was a very cheap meal to feed a bunch of people and everyone loved them!!! Thanks for the recipe. It's definitally a keeper =)

I changed this recipe a little. I used acan of regular pizza sauce instead of spaghetti sauce and flattened the biscuits in a 13 x 9 pan.  ALL 4 of my boys LOVED it. Very quick and easy, will definitely make it again!

Four stars for yours, five for mine (and I did both).  Omit the spaghetti sauce and use a package of taco seasoning.  I also added minced garlic and onion.  YUM.

This is a SERIOUS family pleaser!! My children range in age from 2-15 and everyone was ooohing and aaahing over this dish.  Personally, I'm all about spice and this was delish with a little sprinkle of crushed red peppers.

These are a quick dinner idea that is super easy to make.  However, I did have problems keeping my biscuit to stay in the "cup" shape too.  I added some seasonings to these and since I was almost out of shredded cheese, I cut up some mozzarella string cheese sticks into fourths and added one piece to each cup before adding the meat filling.  They were yummy and oozey when you bit into them.  I would definitely recommend adding the extra cheese!

This recipe was very easy, but was just ok to me. Might make again, but will probably substitute the filling with pizza type ingredients instead.

We had honey butter biscuits, so we tried those. My husband & kids loved it, but it was slightly off to me. Overall, really good and super quick! We served it with sweet potato fries

SOOO GOOOOD! I loved it so much.I made in foods class and it was so tasty everybody loved it. I would so make this at home for my 2 year old brother this is something I think he would love because he is so picky and its hard to find something that he likes. This would be the best snack for kids and parties.

I liked the simplicity of this recipes but was a little anxious to try it. It turned out pretty good. Great for a quick and easy meal, but also very filling. I did change a few things though. I used pizza sauce instead of spaghetti sauce and filled the biscuit with a little more meat. Very good and very simple.

My family loved these. It was a little hard stretching the biscuits into "cups" THey kept snapping back to their original form! Great quick dinner-especially for kids. I snuck green peppers, mushrooms and onions into the sauce. They never noticed. I also added roasted red pepper, garlic, and italian seasonings. THat gave it just the right "kick".

Loved it!..had to use what was on hand tho and this is what I did...added a dash of salt, pepper, cumino, powdered garlic, and cayenne pepper...to taste...then added a can of petite diced tomatoes...drained each spoonful as I put them into the crescent rolls that I used instead of biscuits...added cheese and served with brown gravy, fried taters n onions, and baked beans. AWESOME!!!

These were so simple to make. I used canned sloppy joe sauce instead of spaghetti and they turned out great. The biscuits did get stuck in the non-stick muffin pan so next time I make them, I'm going to bush a little oil or butter/margerine to the muffin pan. They'll make great appetizers if you make them small enough and roll them into balls.

My family of 6 LOVES this recipe.  I did modify the cooking of it slightly.  I didn't put the biscuits in the muffin pan, I spread them on a baking sheet, then put the spaghetti sauce on the biscuit, followed by the beef, baked for 13 minutes at 350 (my stove is weird), then added cheese and baked for another 3 minutes.  These were the best.  I also replaced the sauce with ranch dressing on one of them as one of my kiddos doesn't like spaghetti sauce.  Awesome idea and recipe that I will keep (and add my own variations to) as long as my kids will eat them!  Thank you for sharing!

I have been doing this for years as a snack or lunch for my kids.  When we have spaghetti I always make  way too much meat sauce so I just save it for this snack.  It is also delicious with Manwich (we like BBQ but both are good)!!!

This was VERY bland tasting.  I would try to add more seasoning and even use Sloppy Jo Mix in place of the spaghetti sauce. Not sure if I am going to try again.  My hubby, Who eats about anything, Really did not like these.

FIVE STARS for easiness and deliciousness! I did some deep-dish pizzas like the recipe said to, but mostly I just greased a cookie sheet and flattened out the biscuit dough on it to form mini-crusts. The crust was delicious! I will definately do this again.
