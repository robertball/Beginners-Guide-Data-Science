I am the original submitter of this recipe.  Special thanks to my mom for teaching me how to make this cake. This recipe is flexible, you can sub the apple pie filling with peach or other flavor you like. Sub pecans for walnuts. The volume of the Bundt pan that this cake works in is 10 cups.  This cake is so good it will impress-- and only you will know how simple it was to make."   http://allrecipes.com/personalrecipe/63532592/allies-awesome-easy-spice-cake/detail.aspx

This is one of those recipes that when you’re mixing it together you’re thinking, “Oh ya, this is going to be really good.”  Then while it’s baking in the oven and the house smells like heaven you’re thinking. ‘Oh ya, this is going to be really good.”  Finally, you get to cut a slice and have a bite and you’re thinking, “Oh ya, this is really good.”  Thanks for sharing Allie!

Thank you Allie for sharing your recipe.  It is sooo moist and delicious.  I used my own canned apple pie filling, chopped pecans  and dusted lightly with powdered sugar. It smelled heavenly while baking. I baked for about 55 minutes. The best spice cake I've tasted in a long time - well maybe FOREVER.  Congratulations on having your recipe kitchen approved by AR.  It is a 5 star recipe!

This is a great and easy recipe and does not need a frosting.  I used a 13x9 pan and baked for 35 minutes.

Recipe Group Selection:  30, March 2013 ~ Delicious cake!  Having just returned from vacation, I did not have a can of apple pie filling on hand.  I did as Linda (LMT) suggested and made a scaled back ‘Apple Pie Filling’ by Terri to use in this recipe.  It worked perfectly.  The house smelled amazing while baking.  We enjoyed it the first serving - warm.  The second serving, my family actually enjoyed this the next day for breakfast – toasted.  They cut it thin and popped it in the toaster.  We enjoy banana bread, orange bread, plum bread, etc. toasted and we all enjoyed this apple cake the same way.  Tonight they ate it at room temp and they informed me that it is very good that way also.  Thanks, Allie for a delicious recipe.  It works 2 ways in our house – as a dessert and as a breakfast treat.  It will be made again.

Made for Recipe Group. Although, I have had it in my recipe box for a bit. The guys give it a thumbs up and they are spice cake aficionados.  I didn't have any nutmeg and just subbed in some extra cinnamon. The cloves are a little too strong for me, but that is only my aversion to the taste. (I still like a little bit). I also used applesauce for the oil. I have nutmeg now and will make it again, maybe without the pie filling. Thanks Allie!

Awesome!  My mother's 80th birthday party was tonight & she loves spice cake.  I usually get a box of cake mix, but I thought I'd try to make a spice cake from scratch for her big day.
So, I tried this recipe: it was a huge hit!
I varied a little from the recipe, however.  I used a can of organic apple pie filling that was just apples and water (I was a bit leery of using canned apple pie filling because of the additives), so I added some extra spice to the mixture to make up for the un-spiced apple filling:  allspice & ginger.
It turned out fantastic.  Don't be alarmed if the cake is a bit dark though. I really thought I had burned it but it tasted great. 
I also added a bit of cream cheese glaze (4 oz. cream cheese, 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla & 2 tblsp. of milk).
Thanks for the great recipe!

New notes:
My mom will be 84 this year & this is her favorite, so I have made this cake many times since her 80th birthday.  Over-baking this cake will make this cake very dark & kind of tough. So, only bake it until a toothpick comes out clean:  it's a light golden brown.
Since I use apples packed in water, I am careful to drain the apples & chop them into smaller pieces before adding to the batter.  Once I used fresh apples that I cooked with a bit of butter & brown sugar.
I cut sugar back to 1 1/2 cups: 2 cups of sugar is too sweet.
I top it with lemon cream frosting when I make cup cakes, or I thin the frosting into a glaze when I make it in a tube pan. It makes a

I made this cake for my father for Easter dinner and everyone loved it. Extremely moist and full of flavor. The only alteration I made was adding some raisins. I had a little trouble getting the cake out of the pan so make sure you grease and flour well. Topped it with a cream cheese frosting glaze and it was perfect. Thank you for the wonderful recipe. Would have loved to post a photo but my family ate the entire cake before I could take a picture.

I made this today as we are snowed in for 2 days now and we wanted a treat. I used 1 cup ap flour and 1 cup Robin Hood's Nutri flour Whole Wheat with flax, I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and used brown sugar instead of white, I used 2 tsps baking powder instead of soda as I am really sensitive to the taste of soda and knew I would not like it, 1 tbsp of apple pie spice for the spices, omitted the salt as I am on a low sodium diet, 2 cups of homemade apple pie filling and omitted the walnuts as we don't like them. Baked in 60 minutes exactly, cooled for 10 minutes in pan then turned out of pan and cooled for 1 hour on wire rack. This was really moist and tasty, sweetness was spot on, 2 cups of sugar would have been way too much.

This is a great cake.  Before I dumped the apple filling in, I stuck a knife in the can and made several cuts to make the apples smaller.  It distributes the apples so much better and I think it may also prevent that tendency for the cake to fall apart.

Just made it again for my birthday and made these changes to the recipe to prevent it falling. I added 2 T's of flour, subtracted 2 T's of sugar, added an extra egg, substituted applesauce for the oil, and baked at 375 degrees for one hour...came out perfect !!!  We live in Colorado at 7400 feet.

OMG! I was hungry for a good dessert but didn't want to spend a long time making it.  This turned out perfectly.  I halved the recipe and put in a 9x5 loaf pan.  Only thing I didn't halve was the cinnamon.  Took advice of others and used half white and half brown sugar. I was worried it wouldn't come out of pan so I greased it, "pammed" it, and then floured it. (Probably overkill but it worked).  Like others, cutting the apples into small pieces was a good move. Also, per one recommendation, I used pie filling that had no corn syrup - I think it was Lucky Leaf brand. Added about 1/3 cup of plumped up raisins per someone's comment as well. Great spice level. Maybe I'll try a cream cheese mascarpone icing on it. (Not that it needs frosting - I just have some leftover mascarpone cheese). I'm also going to try toasting a piece tomorrow for breakfast.  It's so easy - hard to believe it's that good. It did take awhile to bake in the loaf pan - probably 35 minutes or so, but I just kept checking it until the knife was "crumbly" clean. No need to halve this recipe in the future! TUVM, Allie.

Way too much sugar! Cooled cake 2& 1/2 hours using non-stick bundt pan, sprayed with non-stick. Cake stuck to the pan breaking up!  Very disappointing. Will not make this again.

This is a quick, easy cake with great flavour. Reduced the sugar slightly as I poured a brown sugar glaze on top after baking. I used a non-stick bundt pan and the cake did stick even though I cooled it thoroughly in the pan as instructed - next time I will flour the pan after greasing.

I could hardly wait for this to come out of the oven... the lovely smell of this cooking brought curious family members  hovering around asking when this would be ready.  It was made and all gone in a few short hours.  Simple, moist and delicious....I omitted the nuts due to allergy and added a bit more clove and nutmeg only because of our preferences..... Thanks Allie, this will be made again and again.  I plan to make one for my Mom..she'll love it too.

Wonderful cake! I only had homemade peach pie filling and didn't have nuts. I reduced the sugar by half a cup- per reviewer suggestions. I used 2 and a half cups of peach pie filling- and omitted the cloves entirely because we are not a fan of cloves.. The rest is PERFECTION! It baked in 50 minutes, did not stick either and the house smelled lovely! I think those who had problems with it being sticky is because store bought pie fillings can contain corn syrup and starch which mine didn't have. In any case it's a wonderful cake and it will be my go to spice cake for this years holidays! I will probably make it with peach again since I still have more of the filling but I bet it will be amazing with it's original apple filling too and the nuts will certainly make it better. Thanks Allie for suggesting this cake :) It's a hit with my family!---UPDATE: OMG! it is %200 better the next day. You can taste the fruit much more when it sits longer. If making for a party make a day in advance. YUM!

I decided to make this recipe into muffins instead of a cake since I didn't think my husband and I would eat an entire cake.  The results were great!  I used slightly less sugar and baked them in paper muffin cups at 350 for 20-25 minutes. Perfect results and so easy!  I have definitely added it to my recipe collection.

This cake is as it is named, awesome and easy! The only changes I made was that I used 1 cup dark brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar.  My apple filling was a 21 oz. can but it didn't seem to make any difference.  I made this for my co-workers and they all raved about it.  Mine took 70 min. to bake. Thanks Allie for this wonderful recipe! :)

Fantabulous Apple Spice Cake! Perfect blend of spices, moist, loved the chunks of apple from the apple pie filling (made my own filling using Apple Pie Filling by Terri), easy to make, smelled wonderful baking and tastes great. Good one Allie!! Thanks for sharing. (recipe made for *RECIPE GROUP*) Update: Had a piece of this cake for breakfast and it's even better the next day.

It stuck to the pan, inside fell apart and looks like it fell when baking very slightly. It also seemed mushy, or wet, still inside (even though the toothpick trick seemed fine).

Thank you for posting this! I loved it all, although it kind of fell apart because I didn't wait long enough to take out of the pan.... Despite the user error it was indeed awesome! I left out the walnuts, I used the cream cheese glaze another reviewer suggested and threw sliced almonds on top. Also used coconut flour (1/3 C)
Thanks again!

Perfect cake and yes it gets better and better the longer you have it. Had a week old piece today and it was better then the first day it was made. Served it with fresh whipped cream and powdered sugar. Followed the recipe as written and there is no need to change a thing.

This cake is wonderful!  I used a 20-ounce can of apple pie filling, but ran my knife through the can several times to make smaller pieces.  I sprayed and generously floured my bundt pan, and the cake released without a problem.  It's very moist and simply delicious.  I subbed pecans for walnuts, as I had them in the freezer.  It's quick and easy to throw together, too.  In my opinion, it was even better the next day.  Thanks, Allie, for a keeper recipe!

This ? is for AllieGeekPi who submitted this recipe.  What went wrong? I baked it and it fell, after checking at 55minutes.  Baked total of one hour 10 min. I followed instructions, stirring all the dry ingredients into the wet mixture.  Too much stirring with spoon??  It smelled SO good too.
I live at one mile above sea level, but have success with adding 2 TBS flour to all cakes. Thankyou

I love spice, but this was WAY too strong and I omitted the cloves. I cannot imagine more spice. I know different pie fillings are spiced differently, but this was over the top. I like the general concept and way the recipe turns out and may try again with other pie filling flavors. I think the apples are too chunky, too. Less sugar would also be a good alteration. This recipe has potential, but needs tweaking for my taste, and I eat almost anything sweet.

I made this today, using a quart sized jar of homemade apple pie filling. I have no idea if that is equivalent to the amount of canned filling called for. (Anyone else know?) I baked it for 52 minutes, as my oven usually cooks a little hot. As I made it, it was slightly sticky, especially where an apple chunk was, but very delicious. I will definitely make again, although I will try baking it a tad bit longer, maybe 55 minutes. Also, I greased and floured my bunds pan and didn't have any of the sticking problems others mentioned, so I will definitely flour again in the future. Everyone loved this. Thanks!

I loved everything about this cake except for the pie filling. I used Comstock, and what I was left with was big squooshy apple sections in my cake. This might have been different had I used my Kitchen Aid but the instructions seemed to suggest mixing it up wooden-spoon style so I did that. Maybe the Comstock brand pie filling is to blame? I am positive that this would be fantastic with homemade apple filling or with AR's "Sauteed Apples". I'm giving it 5 stars despite my reservations because not a single slice made it home from DH's work. So clearly I was in the minority there! Thanks for sharing :)

This cake is so simple to make and it tastes so good! I had to sub pecans for walnuts because that is what I had on hand. Otherwise I followed the directions exactly. The cake is moist and flavorful. Even though I greased my pan well and waited the full hour before removing, my cake fell apart. Not sure if it was something I did or the recipe so I'm not taking a star away for that. Just be careful. This recipe is the first one I have done for Recipe Group. Sometimes I think of doing it but this is the first recipe to inspire me to actually put forth the effort. Thanks for sharing. One reviewer said they added raisins and I think they would be great in this. I can't imagine putting icing on this cake. It is pretty sweet as is. As everyone has stated, this cake smells fabulous. Wish I could have it in the oven every day to make my house smell great!

The cake was delicious but it stuck in the pan.  I used Pam and floured but it did not come out well after cooling.  Next time I would either try to turn it out right away or just make the cake in a 9x13. Recipe is very good.  I’ll keep a can of pie filling around going forward.  Everything else is a staple so this would be easy to throw together.

If you have a crazy strong sweet tooth like I do, you'll love this recipe.  If you're looking for a lighter dessert or something a little more subtle: skip this one because you'll hate it.  I've made it a few times now, sometimes using all white sugar, and sometimes using half white and half brown, and it's good both ways. It seemed that the apple flavor wasn't really coming through, though, so the last time I made it, I cut back on the sugar by about 25 or 30%, and I think I liked it more that way, so that's probably what I'll do from now on.  And be sure to dice the apples before adding them to the batter.  As another reviewer said, it makes your house smell amazing!

Although a bit of it did stick in the pan, the results were still stunning. I had a lot of complements. It's almost like gingerbread and very moist. It's good with whipped cream.

This is the definition of a go-to dessert-it's easy, delicious and everyone loves it! I top it with homemade cream cheese frosting but it's phenomenal as is or with a simple dusting of powdered sugar.  Thank you so much, Allie, for sharing it!

Since I live at 7400 feet baking can be a challenge.  I thought there might be others interested in the changes I made to this recipe to have it come out perfect at high altitude.  I added and extra egg, decreased the baking soda by 1/2 teaspoon, added 2  tablespoons of flour, used applesauce instead of oil ( personal preference, nothing to do with altitude), used one cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar.   I baked it in a 9 x 13 pan on the middle rack of my oven and used convection bake at 350 for 35 minutes.  It rose beautifully, didn't fall in the center and I'm guessing will taste amazing!  Hope this helps out some high altitude bakers :-)

Def the easiest and best tasting.  I tried the flat pan method but will def do the bundt pan next time.  Also, only stir the apples a little as they break up fairly easy.  :)

I made this and it is awesome! I added a caramel/apple filling I found at Walmart and also added apple pie spice and pecans instead of walnuts. I did only 2 1/4 c. of sugar and cut the apples up into bit size pieces as they are to big like a previous writer mentioned. Thanks so much for this recipe Allie.

Great recipe! Very moist and spicy good! After reading reviews, I did chop up the apple filling, and did sub 1c of white sugar with 1/2c brown sugar. I also made a glaze with caramel flavor, and it was very good! No problems with sticking in the pan, but I also greased and floured the pan very well and let it cool for about an hour before I removed it.

My family loved this. I took the advice of posters & floured my pan after I greased it. I also took a knife & ran it thru the pie filling in the can. Also doubled the cinnamon. Cake is super moist & really good!

This really is awesome.  I made a few changes for a healthier version.  I used 1 cup it whole wheat flour and 1 cup regular, I reduced the sugar to 1.5 cups, replaced the oil with apple sauce and used a lite version of the apple pie filling.  I left out the nuts.  As my family loves cream cheese frosting, I added a thin layer with toasted coconut.  This is a keeper.  Thanks.

I have made this recipe twice--once for my husband, and once for our male neighbor, both really fond of spice cake.  I made it both times as instructed, and both times it came out very nicely.  I was surprised since we are at a higher altitude, but after baking for only 55 minutes, it was fine.  Both men were very pleased with the cake, so it is a keeper in our family.

AWESOME is it!!  This cake was so easy to make.  I just love a dump, mix, and bake cake; and, imagine that it fills your house with such a spicy fragrance!  What could be better!  Although I believe you don't need an electric mixer to make, I couldn't help but use my new mixer to try it out.  I wanted a special recipe to make for the occasion and this one was it!!  Both Hubby and I give it 5 stars all the way.  Next time I will add raisins.  Thank you Allie for this AWESOME recipe!!

I just took this out of the oven and my kitchen smells amazing. It was a very easy cake to put together. Baked up nicely. It will present well. I am serving it with a sprinkle of icing sugar over top and on each slice a dab of caramel sauce. This will be made again. Thanks Allie. Its a hit.

Made this for Recipe Group...AWESOME is only one word to describe this cake...It is absolutely FANTASTIC! I could not believe how simple it was to mix up. It actually took longer to find my spices in the cabinet than it did to make this cake, lol. I did omit the walnuts, but that was only because I forgot to add them, (I'll try not to forget for next time, lol). This smelled wonderful while baking, and tastes even better. I did make a simple powdered sugar icing, just to decorate the top a bit. Very moist and yummy...a definite keeper! Thanks for sharing, Allie. :)

This is a wonderful cake.  My house smelled amazing while this was baking.  I made the cake batter as directed but used up some Drunken Apples (personal recipe a lot like pie filling)from last nights dinner - I simply weighed out 20 ounces on my scale to match the can size used. I had a little more than 1 cup of nuts left in the bag so I just used them all.  The cake came out of the pan easily and presented beautifully.  I made an Amaretto Caramel Sauce and poured over top with some crushed nuts.  We enjoyed a nice warm slice with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream.  What can I say except plates were licked clean.
