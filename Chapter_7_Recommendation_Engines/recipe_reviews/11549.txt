I followed the recipe exactly except I added a tbsp of Vanilla extract to the mixture.
These were delicious and soft!
I used plum butter, and raspberry jam then sprinkled with white sugar on top.
These take some time to make, and the dough does not need to be refrigerated.
Will definitely make them again when I have about 1.5-2 hours to spare! :)

I used blackberry jam because that's what I had available.  The boys really liked these cookies, and they weren't hard to make.  They look neat too.  They do take some time though.

maybe I did something wrong but these were tasteless, dry and hard, even though I pulled them as soon as they were getting brown around the edges. The other problem I had was the dough was way to soft to roll out. Maybe the dough should be refrigerated a little while before rolling out?  or, again, maybe it was just me...

1.3.17  I chilled the cookie dough before rolling out and would recommend you do the same, keeping the dough refrigerated between batches.   Also, roll and cut quickly as this dough becomes very soft, very fast.  By the time I rolled out the dough and cut the cookies, it was difficult to even get them onto the cookie sheet without sticking to the board and falling apart.  And the dough was so soft by the time the cookie sheet went into the oven that they spread out when baked.   Admittedly, I’m not a dedicated  baker, but I have to wonder if there should be more flour or less butter???  Because of what’s just been mentioned, I only baked six cookies at a time, and the dough and board was well floured...took too long, and I don’t like that either. The texture of the cookie was fine, but other than the plum fruit, they had very little flavor.  Do yourself a favor, and at a minimum, add some vanilla or almond extract to the cookie dough.  They were OK and will be eaten, but I won’t be making this recipe again, just too many issues.

I made this recipe with homemade plum preserves and they came out okay.  They were pretty, but the cookie was a little dry and crumbly.  I think next time I will use a different sugar cookie recipe.
