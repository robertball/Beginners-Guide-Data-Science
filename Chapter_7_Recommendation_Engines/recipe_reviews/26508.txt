I wish there was a half star option, b/c I would give this 3 1/2. Although it wasnt nearly the best curry I've had, it improved by leaps and bounds after sitting overnight in the fridge. If I make it next time I will cook it a day ahead of time. I added onions, garlic and at the very end coconut milk. I double all the spice and probably tripled the salt.

We had this tonight for dinner, taking the suggestion of adding califlower. I only had one jalapeno, and red potatos, but it was still very tasty and quick. I was worried that there was not going to be any sauce, but the eggplant and tomatos disolved and I only added 1/2 can of coconut milk at the very end along with some spinach. Very good, but not quite mind-blowing. Oh- I also peeled the eggplant, and soaked it with salt for 1/2 hour first, then rinsed it and used it, as it came from my boyfriend's mothers' garden and I was worried it was a little bitter. Yum- we will probably try this again.

Quick and easy, without all of the complicated and hard to find Indian ingredients, but very tasty. I added garlic, onion, zucchini, chick peas and a pinch of cayenne pepper (left out the jalepenos). Can't imagine this one without garlic and onion!

Very tasty. Spicy, yet mild enough to taste a wide variety of flavors. Great wrapped in a tortilla for a fast in the car meal. Great served over simple white rice for a very filling, satisfying vegan meal.

This was delicious, especially on the next day. I couldn't find jalapeno peppers or cilantro (i'm in England) so I used "bell" peppers and coriander instead. Next time I'll add onion, garlic and spinach. This is the first successful curry I'v ever made!

Loved it!  just the right amount of spice.  My daughter had it with Pad Thai noodles.  Twas a great side along with The Indian-style shrimp with yogurt sauce on the Cooking Light web-site. Both recipes call for cilantro, but I suppose you could use parsley. Won't have as much kick. Try to leave "as is."  You will miss the spices.

This was a really good and easy recipe.  I added coconut milk as suggested by other reviewers but only about 1/6 of a can as to not make it a  soupy consistency but it would be good like that too.  I didn't have eggplant so added 1/2 a head of cabbage and 3 small zucchini.  The combination of spices really works and I added about a teaspoon of garam masala.  I will definitely make this again, you can throw just about anything in it- cauliflower, potatoes, chickpeas and green peas sounds like a good combination for next time.

Delicious base.  Used tinned tomatoes and added cauliflower, quartered onions and garlic, omitting the eggplant and jalepeno peppers.  It turned out really good.  I was really just looking for a side dish of veggies for my chicken curry, but this was too good for just that.   Infact, I have three vegeterian members in my family.   This will be served to them when we have our next curry night.   Thanks.

I didn't have cumin seeds so I used powder.  I didn't use jalapeno peppers or tumeric b/c I didn't have any.  I added water several times to keep it from burning.  I added spinach just before it was finished.  Next time I will add the eggplant later also b/c it disintegrated by the time the potatoes were cooked.  It was very good.  The cilantro was especially good on it.

The only thing I followed was the recommended spice amount (which I doubled) and the jalapenos. It ended up not being spicy at all (but then again I did use a lot of sweet veggies like yams, sweet potatoes ect..) Overall it was really good though.

I had to review this recipe just because it turned out so well! I ended up using chicken broth instead of the water the recipe mentions and I added garlic powder and sweet potatoes... recipe turned out fantastic! I'm sure it would have been just as good without my modifications though...

This was delicious! I followed the advice of others-definitely double or even triple the spices.  Next time I would use less potatoes. I served it over rice so the large amount of potatoes was a little much.

This was okay.  I like it because it is healthy and very versatile. I tripled the spices, but that was because I had a monster eggplant. I also added a little bit of water at the beginning - otherwise I think the veggies would have burnt.  I also used a sweet potato instead of the yukon.  If I were to do this again, I will peel the eggplant and add other things like chickpeas.

Delicious recipe.  Easy to make and easy on the wallet.  I add onion and garlic for extra flavor, and although the recipe says "add water if necessary" I think it is necessary to add water - not too much but so it cooks.

LOVE THIS! Probably serve it weekly. Following other suggestions I add onions, garlic, cauliflower, and the one crucial ingredient for our family-COCONUT MILK!! We do not like it nearly as much without this. I am thinking of trying butternut squash in it this week!

I *love* this dish; not only is it easy to make, but the variations are endless! For example, last might I used two red bliss potatoes instead of the four Yukons, and besides the eggplant added yellow squash, mushrooms, half a vidalia onion, and yellow pepper. I was also going to add cauliflower but wasn't sure how that would work out, but now that I've read how many people have done just that, I'll be sure to give it a whirl next time! I forgot the jalapenos, though, and it really didn't impact on the flavor at all. And yes, it *is* even better the next day!

Very tasty stew. I added sauteed onions and garlic, and sauteed slices of soy meat. I agree
with the previous reviews-tastes best the second
day.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I used it as a guild for the spices and added my own vegetables and pork but the flavour of the spices were excellent. I did double the amount of each spice though because it wasn't hot enough for us. overall great and will use it again.

I made this and it was very good. I used coconut oil and added coconut milk to make a sauce. I started with my vegetables that would take longest to cook then added the others later. It was so flavorful. Also added garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, and substituted cumin powder for cumin seeds. Really tasty!!

I took the other suggestions, and added an onion, garlic, and frozen spinach (which I precooked in the microwave and drained). I also cut up the eggplant, added 1/4 a cup of water and microwaved for 4 min. and drained to remove the bitterness. I added the spinach during the last five minutes. I also didn't have any jalapenos but added a green pepper instead. I would suggest doubling the salt. My husband, who was born in India, said this dish is in his top five favorites. 
We served this dish with rice and parathas.

Pretty decent. Had to double the spices and still felt something was missing. Added an onion and some garlic, too... Next time I will triple the spices.

I added cauliflower instead of eggplant and almost tripled the spices but this dish still ended up so bland that I didn't even finish my serving.  I'm hoping this will be better tomorrow like everyone says!

We enjoyed this dish, I went heavy on the jalapenos so it was a bit too spicy, so you'd be wise to stick with the recipe as written. Curry is a favorite flavor of ours, so overall, we truly enjoyed this dish.

Pretty good!  I added some other veggies that I had on hand that needed used... yellow squash, banana peppers and red peppers.  I guess I'm a meat-eater at heart, because I think this dish would be even better with some chicken in it.  I served it over couscous.

I had really high hopes for this recipe, and it was only so-so for me (when followed exactly).  Perhaps next time I will take the advice of others and make some additions.

This turned out pretty well but I feel like the sauce is missing something. I sweat the eggplant first and cooked everything for 10 minutes before I threw it in to avoid it dissolving too much. I also added a can of chickpeas.

i originally rated this with less stars, but then i had them the next day and.. WOW!

i took the leftover veggies and added them to a butternut squash broth until simmering and nearly fell over it was so good.

My husband does not like eggplant so I did not add any to the dish.  I used 6 potatoes and as others suggested, I added some coconut milk at the end.  I also added some chopped spinach at the end as well.  If you want more of a stew or soup you could add some rice to the vegetables.  Thanks for the good recipe.

Enjoyed it enough to make it twice. 
Not too spicy and a nice alternative to meat or pasta dish.

This recipe was very good. I omitted the potatoes from the recipe because i wanted it as a side. I also omitted the peppers because i didn't want to scare off the kids. (The kids fussed anyway because these are vegetables...oh well, more for me! hehe)Anyway, I had some leftover cabbage and baby carrots that I threw in as well as some cauliflower. I cooked everything till the vegetables were nice and tender. Yum yum Good!
BTW, i also served doubles with this dish. I don't know if this recipe is on this site but you can google it. (Doubles, a snack from trinidad, are two pieces of fried dough, with a chickpea spread as a filler) The kids LOVED those.

This was wonderful! Used two large jalepenos, and heat level was good. Added carrots. Hubby also said that this was a definite keeper. Will certainly make again!

Like it with coconut milk instead of 1/2 of water. Had to add 3/4c more water, maybe because I put 1/2 brown shortgrain rice. Also may have caused it to take 45+ min to cook. We ate it at 45min...was still almost hard, too nutty. My fault, I'm sure.But LOVE the flavor! We ate it with leftover Black Bean and Corn Salad II stuffed in pietas. Nicely cooled the spicy rice together! Cost so very little, I only had to spend about $2 to get things beyond what was just staples on our shelves, convenient! Great for cold weather!

Excellent tasting healthy recipe. I didn't have enough potatoes, so I substituted some others. Also used less oil and more salt. Best on second day after flavors have a chance to meld. Thanks for the recipe.
