A total MUST to increase milk to tablespoons from teaspoons otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing. This one ROCKED! It turned out perfect, was soooo simple and fool proof. Works great to spread, pipe or pour. I made this one 7 seperate times before writing review and all were perfect. The taste was right on, it poured over my bundt cakes beautifully and hardened enough to cover within 20 minutes.(cool your cake completely beforehand). The other batches were made for decorating cookies and they too were perfect each time.  One batch is more than enough to lightly spread and generously pipe 2 dozen average sized cookies.

In all fairness, I have to say that this review is really for the glaze using a number of other reviewers' suggestions and modifications. It seems very few people prepared this recipe as written and those who did were not happy with it. Mixing up this glaze with the suggestions to use 1 T. each of butter and corn syrup, and enough milk to desired consistency, this was simply perfect--shiny and white, just what I was after.

This is a good base for a vanilla glaze.  As the others have said it needs more milk.  I really think that there is a typo when it comes to the milk, it should be tablespoon rather than teaspoon.  The corn syrup is a nice extra if you want it to set nice but it does make it a little too sweet (I love sweet things) I would decrease the sugar to 1 1/4 cup if 1 tbl of corn syrup is added.  It really needed extra vanilla.  I used 1/2 tsp but I would even double that.  It really did need at least 1 tbl of butter.  I would add more.  If you do decrease the powdered sugar take it easy on the milk and add as you go, you can always add more later but there is no way to fix a soupy mess unless you want pure sugar.

Excellent!  Will use this time and time again for my loaves, pound and bundt cakes. One word of advice though.  Ensure the cake is very cool before the glaze is drizzled on.  The first time i made it, it melted off somewhat.  I guess i was to impatient and just wanted to eat the cake.  I learned my lesson though and it really does turn out fabulous.

Picture perfect glaze!  I used this after the modifications of 1 Tbsp. of butter and 1 Tbsp. of corn syrup. I used this over Country Cinnamon Swirl Bread and will definitely use this again and again.

Like a few reviews before me, I found the glaze a too thick- albeit pretty- when I added the minimal amount of milk. After switching it to tablespoons, it turned out a nice glaze consistency. I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon and poured it over a pumpkin spice bread.

This is good base recipe but does need some tweaking.  I followed ATCGIRLY's advice and added 1 tbsp corn syrup and 1 tbsp butter as well as increasing the milk.  It turned out quite nice after that but I think I still may have to add more milk.

Just what I was looking for!!! I used this to drizzle over bread pudding and it turned out perfectly! I do agree with others who say the amount of milk called for is inadequate. I simply just added as much milk as I needed to get the consistency I was looking for. This glaze is great because you can easily add or reduce  however much milk to your preference. It's definitely a keeper!

You can't go wrong with this glaze, I used it on top of a fresh baked cinnamon raisin bread....it was perfect!  You can make it as thin (like a drizzle) or thick as you'd like by adding in more or less confectioners sugar.

Very good and easy to make. Add milk in small amounts until the consistency is as you like it.

I am rating this a 5 based on other folks suggestions: I used 1 tbs. of butter, 1 tbs. of corn syrup and 1 tsp. of vanilla.  I omitted the salt.  I started with 1 tbs. of milk and added more until I got the consistency I wanted (I would guess a total of 2 tbs of milk).  I also sifted the confectioners sugar prior to adding the other ingredients to ensure there were no lumps.  It came out beautifully - glossy and rich.

Okay. So, here's the deal. Taste-wise, this was perfect. Just what I was looking for and it complimented Grandma's Blackberry Cake really well. 
The issue I had was this called for WAY more milk than was asked for in the recipe. I think I stopped counting at five teaspoons over what was called for. This was also thicker than what I'd pictured, but this worked to my advantage. I added a little more vanilla because I like my frosting a little more "vanilla-y". Turned out perfectly for what I needed. 

If you plan on making this, be sure to be prepared to add more milk.

I use this as a base all the time.  Sometimes I substitute lemon juice, orange juice, or lime juice as the liquid and then also add in some zest.  Very easy and delicious!  It can dress up just about anything.

This was a great glaze! I used it on the "Too Much Chocolate Cake" recipe which is also a 5 star in my book. I added 1 Tbs of light corn syrup, 1/2 Tbs extra butter, and a bit more milk then heated it in my microwave about 15 seconds. Drizzle it over your favorite cake or cookies! Sets beautifully!

Excellent glaze for pound cake, donuts, etc... tastes like Krispy Creme donut glaze. I did use evaporated milk instead and had to add a little water to reach the right consistency. This one is the BEST, no doubt!

I've always used a version of this[65 yrs or so] . For richer flavor use evaporated canned milk, undiluted. Try a drop or two of maple or brandy, or rum flavoring for spice cakes added in with the vanilla for another taste treat.

i added twice as much butter asked for and also twice as much vanilla (because i tasted it and it just tasted like icing sugar and i prefer more flavour than that). i also used water instead of milk because in the summer months leaving the cake out of the fridge causes the milk in the icing to go sour. i coloured it electric blue and topped cupcakes with it by dipping them in. the consistency is amazing and it tasted wonderful after all my edition. it goes on SO smooth and nice and is a hundred times easier than fondant for cupcakes!

Definitely wait for the cake to cool before glazing.  I added a little more butter and vanilla as suggested by others, and watched the amount of milk I put in.  I accidentally put in a little too much vanilla which made it taste good but the color was too brown.  You might want to sift the sugar before putting it in the pan because even the tiniest lumps which aren't visible in the pan show through when you pour it on the cake, so make sure the glaze is nice, smooth, and lump-free before pouring it on the cake.

I actually give the modified version of this recipe 5 stars. All of the reviews say to use 1 Tbsp. butter and 1 Tbsp. corn syrup, so that's what I did. I also doubled the vanilla. It was perfect to spread on the "Big Soft Ginger Cookies" recipe from this site.

Half of this glaze was perfect for an 8x8 pan. After reading so many reviews, I used the modifications of 1 Tbsp. of butter and 1 Tbsp. of corn syrup. The corn syrup, while sweet, helped to set a real nice glaze. Therefore, I reduced the amount of confectioner’s sugar to about 1 cup adding a little at a time so it would not be too runny and overly sweet. I also incorporated 1T of milk until I got the desired consistency I was looking for. I felt the need to increase the vanilla by ½ tsp.  I used this to drizzle over, “Apple Squares,” also from this site. It was simply perfect; a shiny and white “snowy” glaze, just what I wanted. It tasted creamy and not overly sweet.

Great vanilla glaze!  Just what I was looking for for a gingerbread cake.  But other reviewers were right, I had to keep adding more and more milk to get it creamy.  Other than that, very delicious!  Thanks for posting!

I made this glaze for my cream cheese croissants this past holiday and it was a big hit. I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and added more milk. A little milk really does go a long way however you have to be careful when adding in order to get it to the right consistency.   Thanks for sharing.

Used this vanilla glaze over a blueberry coffee cake.  I also increased the milk a bit and added enough confectioners sugar for a good white, drizzle.  It was enjoyed by all!

Oh YUM!  Such a simple and easy to put together galze.  I agree with other reviews that you need 2 Tbsp of milk, rather than tsp.  I used a little bit more butter than called for and also added pumpkin pie spice to the glaze which was delicious on the spice bundt cake I made.

Mine turned out very nice and glossy.  Like the other reviewers, I added more milk.  It was incrediblly sweet though, not to my taste.  But if you need a super quick, pretty looking cake topper this is great.

Excellent on the Coconut Pound Cake found on this site. I substituted coconut extract for vanilla because of the cake. It was very tasty. Next time I will need to sift the powdered sugar, as it did turn out a bit lumpy.

I thought this was a great glaze.  Along with other reviewers, I too think the milk was a typo.  I used tablespoons, and the consistency was great for pouring over cake.  I did add a little more vanilla because I wanted more flavor.  I would definitely use this again!

This was quick and easy to whip up for a bundt cake I made that needed an extra something.  It came out perfectly for me using 3 T of milk and keeping the rest of the listed ingredients the same.  A little on the sweet side, yes, but that's to be expected.  I wouldn't hesitate to make it again using different extracts for variety.

I'm giving this glaze 5 stars, although I didn't make it as written after reading the other reviews. I followed their modifications and increased the amounts to 1 TBS butter, 3 TBS whipping cream and 1 TBS of corn syrup.  Holy smoke, that makes it turn out fantastic...truly 5 stars! It set up beautifully, but it didn't get so hard that it cracked when you cut the cake. This will be my "go to" vanilla glaze from now on. Easy and delicious! What could be better than that?

I don't know if I'm misunderstanding what a glaze is or not because this recipe did not turn out anything like I expected. The end result was some type of dry and crumbly mixture. I added a little water to it and then it became what I thought a glaze is. With the added water it tasted good and was the consistency I wanted.

After reading many reviews, I made this adding a tablespoon of milk and one of corn syrup. I noticed after making it that I melted my butter on low and mixed in the other ingredients and kept it on low mixing it for 2-3 minutes. The recipe didn't mention to heat it but it turned out great. I poured it hot over a recipe from this site : Kalacs (Hungarian Cinnamon Swirl Bread)

Made as written 4 stars. Add more milk and then it's 5 stars. It was way too thick but once I added more milk it became the consistency I needed for my bunt cake. The flavor was great!

Definitely needed more milk... but other than that this is a good recipe. You can play around with the ingredients to make it more or less sweet and thick or thin. I also added cinnamon to mine and it tasted great!

I made this glaze to go over several different cookies at Christmas time: Beth's Spicy Oatmeal cookies and gingerbread men.  The glaze was the perfect addition to both.  As with any glaze, the amount of milk you use is going to depend on the consistency you are trying to achieve.  Since I wanted a glaze closer to a frosting I used heavy cream in place of the milk and added a couple of tablespoons (didn't really count.)  Delicious! I

Yummmm... I tried this recipe without the added salt as I used 1 tablespoon of SALTed butter, intead of sweet butter.  The other comments about increasing the milk to Tablesppons, not teaspoons, is true to follow...  I used the glaze over a blueberry crumb cake recipe I have had for years, and boy the glaze on the sweet crumbs were an added delight... I will be using this glaze again and again.  thank you !

I used this to top a cinnamon swirl bundt cake and it was great.  I did use 2 1/2 TBSP of milk instead of tsp, it coated the cake very well without all running off onto the plate.  I'll definately use this again.

Wonderful glaze recipe that can be used on many different recipes. I used this on the favorite gingerbread recipe from this site. It is very tasty and easy to whip up. It dries quickly too. I had to add more milk to the recipe that what it called for to get the proper consistancy. I have since used it as a frosting for sugar cookies. You can easily use a different flavor extract or oil. For my cookies I use 10 drops of lemon oil and add lemon yellow coloring. This glaze can be used for mahy different applications.

I used this glaze to drizzle over the A-Number-1 Banana Cake recipe from this site. Since I just wanted to drizzle a little over the cake, I scaled to 24 servings. I also used banana extract in place of vanilla to compliment the cake. It was a very good basic glaze recipe.

Great glaze. I used 1 tablespoon of butter, 1 tablespoon of milk, and then slowly added water till I had the right consistency.  Perfect for drizzling.

I used this glaze on a blueberry quick bread from a box and it made all the difference in the world. I did add a tablesoon of light corn syrup to the recipe. Will definitely make this again.

Very good and very easy. Great because I had everything on hand. I made this for macaroons and it was DELICIOUS. I think it would be great for spice cakes, too.

This was perfect. I liked the consistency. I increased the milk to tablespoons and it was needed. Will make this again. Put it on top of the "Too Much Chocolate Cake" from this site.

this needs more milk like all the reviews stated ( almost) i did prepare it as written but had to add more milk based on what i was going to use it for. i had to cook a giant sunday dinner on the fly so no time to make a home made dessert. i bought a lemon cake from the bakery and poked holes in it and made this glaze to the right consistency and poured it over the cake and garnished it with lemon slices. very good and simple and thats just what i wanted.

Fabulous recipe, great tasting!  I love how this doesn't just taste like confectioner's sugar.  I did have to add almost double the amount of milk stated, not sure why mine was so dry - maybe it has to do with where I live, I don't know.  But anyway, I will definitely be using this recipe again - thank you Jamie!!

Its true it needs more milk but thats easy to fix just add to your desire. I made pumpkin cake and I was just going to put a little glaze on it, but than this one was so good I added the whole batch and my pumkin cake was pretty small but very good glaze, main ingredient sugar no surprise! Thanks for sharing and God bless!!

This IS my new glaze recipe. I love it! It is excellent made as written. I have made it since for a Beer Cake recipe from this site & substituted the liquid for beer, thus creating a beer glaze. It was very, very tasty!

I made this to drizzle over Irish Cream Brownies for St. Patrick's Day, so I used Bailey's Irish Cream and some additional milk, and it turned out tasty and beautiful. Will be my go-to glaze from now on. Thanks!

100% agree with what everyone said about increasing the teaspoons - tablespoons. I did that and follwed the rest of the recipe and it came out wonderful! The 1st time I have ever baked a bundt cake and glazed it myself with homemade glaze! Thanks you for the recipe! :)

I made this as described with the milk at tablespoon instead of teaspoon. Turned out great! Hardened just enough to hold in a warm room, not so hard it hurt my teeth. I piped this via a plastic baggie with a corner cut off onto chocolate mayo cupcakes. Just the right amount, and a good sweet touch to the mellow cake. Delicious!

Was very good, a little too sweet, but paired well with my apple caramel cake. I followed others suggestions by increasing the milk to T. instead of tsp. I would make again.

This is so delicious and so easy. I used to make a vanilla glaze by heating up store-bought frosting and pouring it over my cakes, cookies, etc. This is so much better I will never use store-bought frosting again!

So simple and easy to make! I increased the milk to tbsp from tsp as per everyone's suggestions and omitted the salt to be "healthier". :) I used it to top the Cranberry Orange Loaf from this site and my boyfriend LOVED it.

I am only giving it 3 stars because as written this recipe doesn't work out too well.  This is a good base for the glaze recipe.  The milk should be measured in tablespoons not teaspoons.  Even so, I usually use 3 to 3 1/2 T and you can increase/decrease it to make the glaze as thick/thin to your liking.  I use less than 1/8 tsp. salt - I don't fill the teaspoon up entirely I am scared it will come out too salty.  I've tried increasing the vanilla- and the flavor became too overwhelming so I would leave the amount of vanilla alone.  I have also left the butter out on accident and after making it again using the butter have figured out we liked it better with out.   After making these changes this recipe would be 5 stars!

Great recipe! I converted the milk measurement to tablespoons, as other reviewers advised.  I drizzled a bit over bananas apple cupcakes and it tasted superb.  I had to add a bit more sugar to get the desired consistency, but alll in all- a fabulosus icing.

This is SOOO Yummy! Highly recommend. Just add more or less powdered sugar to get the consistency you need. It is really good on baked spice donuts.

Great glaze! I added the confectioners' sugar last and then only added 1 c. I added milk 1 t. at a time until it was the right consistency I needed (abt. 3 t. more). It was perfect!

This is an easy glaze recipe, and would complement many types of sweet bread, cakes and cookies! I used it to glaze a banana bread and everyone in my office loved it!

This is an excellent recipe.  I added a little more milk, but I also like it rather thick, as pictured.  Awesome on a dark chocolate cake.  This is my one and only vanilla glaze from now on.

I've been baking from scratch for 30 years.  This glaze recipe is the best I've ever tried.  Kids and adults in my family had grown tired of buttercream frosting (except for very special occasions).  Yet it's the butter that makes this glaze so satisfying.  I use 2 1/2 tablespoons milk, as suggested by others.

A nice, solid recipe.  It wasn't quite as opaque as I had hoped, nor did it stick quite as I expected.  I think I just chose a good recipe but for the wrong application.

I made this recipe using only about 1/2 cup powdered sugar and 2 tsp. softened butter. Instead of milk, I used heavy cream because I had it on hand. I didn't measure the cream, but I used just enough to make a very thick glaze. I spread it over warm raisin bread. DELICIOUS!!

Made to go with the Two Ingredient Pumpkin Cake from this site. An excellent glaze for any cake! Use 1 tablespoon butter, 2 tablespoons of milkand 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla (or almond extract depending on what you are using this on). You can really play with the consistency by using more or less milk. If you mix with a handmixer, you can end up with a fluffier consistency and is also great as an actual frositng.

This is the glaze I will use for anything and everything that should be glazed!  To be honest, I didn't measure everything out, just added a dash of this and a sprinkle of that, approximately in the same ratios, but it turned out amazingly.  Allow the glaze to thicken a little before using it so it doesn't run too much and gives it a good, thick coat.

This was a good starting point glaze. I made it as the recipe stated, except for increasing the milk as suggested by others. It looked nice but tasted too "powdered sugar-y" for me. I added 2 more tsp of melted butter and a bit more milk to make a nice, thin glaze. I liked the flavor much better after that. Thanks for a great starting point - I needed this for cinnamon rolls and wanted it fairly thin.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe at all. The measurements are completely off. I spend great deal of time trying to adjust to what went wrong. I also used whipping cream instead of milk, thinking that it would give a better taste. It was okay. I won't be using this again.

This is SO easy to make and very tasty! I took the advice of adding more milk, (2 and 1/2 TBSP) but instead of adding vanilla extract I used 2 TBSP blueberry juice (leftover from a can of blueberries) and it turned a lovely lavender color and was so yummy! My boyfriend thought it was fantastic with the blueberry muffins I made to accompany it!

My first try at a glaze for a bundt cake-- I did as others suggested and upped the milk to 3 tablespoons instead of teaspoons.  I also added in some almond extract and a tiny bit of lemon extract which gave it a very nice amaretto flavor.  It was great on my chocolate fudge bundt cake!

I used this glaze on top of Apple Banana Cupcakes from this site.  Obviously the milk amount is a typo.  I'm pretty sure the butter should be 1 T as well.  I added enough milk to make it to the consistancy that I needed and piped it onto my cupcakes.

I'd been looking for a thicker glaze that would "stick" to my bundt cakes, and this is it!  I added more milk, a tablespoon of butter and a tablespoon of corn syrup!  Very tasty!  If you want a snow white glaze, use clear vanilla extract.  Tastes like the marshmallows in Lucky Charms!

Makes a great glaze for any cake.  2 and 1/2 teaspoons of milk is not enough.  Keep adding milk until it reaches the consistency you want.

sorry but this recipe as it stands is not good. it needs more vanilla and a LOT more milk! I couldn't even get a hard paste with that amount of milk, the sugar was still powdery in a weird moist way. maybe a typo problem. I doubled the vanilla and added about 6 and half tablespoons of milk instead of the stated 2 and half teaspoons. Once I did that the recipe is good provided you completely cool the cake before frosting it. I used this on the simple white cake recipe from this website and let it sit until it hardened. next time I think I might add just a little more vanilla and perhaps one  or two drops of lemon extract just to give it a little kick without having an obvious lemony flavor.

My thanks to Jamie for submitting this. Have used this recipe twice now  - excellent results both time just add more milk as others have noted, otherwise I would have rated it 5.  My changes:  I used buttermilk only because it was all I had and it was even better than when I used regular milk!  I used amaretto and almond extract instead of vanilla as I made this to drizzle on an almond bundt cake. This is a reliable recipe that could be used for cookies as well - just play with the milk and sugar quantities until you have the consistency you need. Lastly, if using this to drizzle on a cake, my suggestion would be to double the recipe. One batch wasn’t enough.

Very good and easy to work with, although you do need to change the teaspoons to tablespoons for the milk. I also slightly increased the vanilla for my own personal taste preference.

Has a lot of the powder suger taste, of which I don't care for. My Mom used to make one where it was sweeter and stayed softer didn't harden so much. I am going to try again with more butter. I did use more milk as I wanted it to drizzle and it was more of a frosting.

I found this glaze to be much too thick as written. I changed the tspn of milk to Tblspn, and it was still a bit thick. Then I added too much milk and it was a little thin. However, it tasted very good and it did its job as a glaze for a lemon pound cake.

I made this for my blueberry pound cake and it turned out great.  I didn't add the salt or measure the ingredients.  I just played around till I got the right consistancy and used water in place of the milk.

There is not enough moisture in this recipe to amount to anything.  You end up with a bowl of powder sugar.  You need to add more water and butter to get it to a glaze stage - even a somewhat frosting stage.  It isn't the best tasting stuff either.  Gritty and very sweet with no vanilla taste.

I just used 1 cup of p-sugar, accidentally used 1 TBL butter and 3 tsp milk with 1 tsp water.  It came out to the perfect consistency for mybundt cake! Yummy and easy to whip up.  Plus, all natural ingredients!

Great, easy recipe. It had a lovely taste to it and you can make it as thin or as thick as you like by altering the amount of milk you use. I was going for a glaze that just sort of drizzled over the bread I made so I added additional milk. Worked out perfectly.

Tastes good, but my results weren't like those in the photos! I did make a half recipe, and changed the milk to tablespoons instead of teaspoons. How does it get so white? Mine was translucent. Is more milk, or the addition of corn syrup (some reviews mention this) necessary for white colour? Will try the recommended modifications the next time.

What I didn't like was that it tasted just like sugar to me, so I would definitely add lemon or orange juice/zest or something extra to enhance the taste.  I did triple dip my Allrecipe "simple white cake recipe" cupcakes, since it was a little thin (I added too much extra milk).  I'll try this again w/some alterations. Oh, and if you have problems w/lumps, sift the powdered sugar and whisk vigorously.  That took care of mine.

I have been making a vanilla glaze for years to add that extra flavor to cookies or other baked goods when needed. I never used a recipe for it before and decided to do that. I really liked the added vanilla flavoring with this recipe. I used it to glaze a carrot style loaf pan cake that needed a little extra sweetness. I am not sure though what glaze the photographer of the main picture was using? I followed the recipe exactly and like my other glazes was a little more transluscent in appearance. Edit note: I have since used it on scones and it worked great. ty

I made 1/2 this recipe to drizzle over Raspberry Almond Coffeecake by Melissa Marsh, also from this site.  Thanks to the reviewers that suggested increasing the milk and butter, and adding corn syrup, which I did as well.  For my half recipe I used 1/2 T. of butter and 1/2 T. of corn syrup.  I added the vanilla to taste and stirred in the milk until I got the drizzling consistency I was after.  This amount was plenty for my small 8” coffeecake.  The taste is excellent and it has a nice gloss to it, making this very pretty!  I will be using this again!

I tried to use the recommendations from other reviewers, granted I have not had much experience making my own icing.  I added 1 tbsp corn syrup, changed to 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, 2 Tbsp milk.  I found it to be waaaayyyy too runny.  I had to added another 3/4 cup of confectioners' sugar and it was perfect.  I probably should have added the normal 2 1/2 tsp of milk and gone up from there if needed (because I added the corn syrup).  Live and learn  :-)   But the end result was gorgeous and dried beautifully on my bundt pound cake.  Perfect beginners recipe.  Thank you!

This was very good and was creamier than most glazes. It seemed to have a melt in your mouth type quality. Maybe because of the butter? I had to add more milk though it was way too thick. I used 2% milk as always. This was wonderful on some blueberry turnovers. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very nice glaze.  I was looking for a glaze that was more than just confectioners' sugar and milk and this one was great - easy to make, easy to make as thin or as thick as you'd like, great taste.

Super easy & very good. I used whole milk and maybe double what the recipe called for, I just kept adding a little until I got the consistency I wanted. We drizzled over lemon cupcakes.

I used this to frost my applesauce cake last night for my husband's birthday.  Everyone said that the frosting made the cake!  It is so easy to make and that little bit of melted butter makes it so much richer and creamier than just a standard powdered sugar icing.  Will use this from now on to frost that cake, and many more.

loved it! just like everyone else the recipe was low on milk so next time i added more milk eventually until it was to my liking. everyone loved it, i ended up makeing cakes and giving recipes to everyone! I had a great time makeing the frosting with my kids too. even though it was a bit messy when they decided to put their fingers in the glaze. (don't worry they washd their hands) thanks for thegreat recipe!

I don't know why people keep giving this high reviews when they acknowledge that as the recipe is written... it simply doesn't work. I only gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because of the addition of salt in the recipe. I thought it added a little something extra. I used like.... double the vanilla and maybe triple the milk.   After sitting for a bit the glaze seemed like it may have separated. It got very thin and clear and ran off the cake. In my situation, I didn't mind... but for another situation it could be a disaster.

Yummy.  I added 1 T. light corn syrup and ended up using 3 T. milk to get a great consistency for bundt cakes.

Exactly what I was lookin for...followed the advice of others and increased the amount of milk and vanilla.  I do think it should be Tbsp. rather than tsp.  I also doubled the vanilla and used 1 Tbsp of melted butter.  I used 3 1/2 Tbsp. of milk...I actually think I just needed 3, it came out a little thinner than I wanted (just for visual purposes), but all in all it is a perfect multi-purpose glaze.  I think the 'original' thicker version would probably work well as a cookie icing.

This glaze was wonderful!  I used it on Downeast Main Pumpkin Bread and it was the perfect compliment to the bread.  I used a full tablespoon of vanilla, and between 2-3 tablespoons of milk as well.  It set up perfectly and looked beautiful as well!!!

I loved that it does NOT get crunchy the next day.  I usually do not follow recipes very well, adding whatever I have on hand, so I used almond extract. I drizzled it over a strawberry cake with almond paste filling and everyone loved it!

This was awesome. It needed much more milk. We used fat free milk and I liked the slightly thinner consistency. It was still really great flavor and consistency and dressed my bundt carrot cake up perfectly. Thank you.

Very easy to make. Definitely change the teaspoons to tablespoons of milk. Came out perfect otherwise! It's very sweet but is great on cake if used sparingly. Yum!

This was the perfect cake glaze. I used it on a lemon bunt cake so I added 1/2 tsp lemon extract as well as the vanilla. I also added 1 Tbl cornsyrup (decreasing conf. sugar by 1/4 cup), 1 Tbl butter, and around 3 Tbls milk as was suggested by other reviews. It tasted great, not sugary like some glazes, and set up well on the cooled cake so it looked beautiful too. Thanks!

Couldn't be better or easier. Just keep adding a little extra milk, a very small amount at a time till it seems right. Wait until cake cools to frost (or drizzle). If you want to use sprinkles, put them on top of icing right away so they'll stick. This icing will harden quickly.

I used this glaze on top of my pumpkin bread that I had baked in a bundt pan. I added some cinnamon and pumpkin spice to it to add some color and flavor. It must have been good because they gobbled it up.

Excellent. I am horrible at making icings and frostings, and this one worked perfectly for me.  I did add just a little more milk, because I wanted to thin down the icing just a bit.  The only problem with this recipe is that it says it makes 48 servings - that's ridiculous.  I made a double batch to cover one 10X13 of cinnamon rolls.

Made a few changes per other reviewers & used on a triple chocolate bundt cake.  Didn't want a glaze that was too white or brown.  These changes were flavorful & worked for me:  Reduced confec sugar to 1-1/4 cup;  increased vanilla to 1 tsp & butter to 1 Tbl; added 1 Tbl light corn syrup.  Added milk last then added by 1/2 Tbl at a time until the consistency was good for drizzling.

Pretty good....but I thought it was very sweet. I halved the recipe and it was just enough to drizzle over the Moist Sour Cream Coffee Cake (on this site). The texture was great and it set up nicely on the cake. I just think the sweetness was a bit too much for my liking though. Thanks!

Simple. Perfect. The kind of recipe that can be adapted as you go. I added the butter, then the flavoring and then milk to the consistency I wanted. Or so I thought! Of course it was too thin - OPPS but I added more powdered sugar and some more butter and sooo pleased.

I love this recipe and used it alot over the holidays. It was FANTASTIC over persimmon & raisin loaf and pumpkin & cranberry muffins. I agree that you need much more milk then specified. I kept adding until I found the perfect texture. Also, use unsalted butter. I tried it with both but found the unsalted version much better. Thanks!

This was good. I like the addition of butter. I left out the salt & added a little bit more milk. Had it with homemade cinnamon bread. Thanks!

I wasn't a big fan of this glaze but I'm picky about vanilla. I'll stick to simply mixing a bit of milk into powdered sugar like I usually do from now on. I used this on a blueberry pastry but it might have tasted better on a carrot cake or something. Almond or rum extract instead of vanilla might be something nice to try for spice cakes and such. I'm sure others will like this recipe though.

This recipe does not make a glaze but rather a glob of (too thick to spread) frosting.  I had to add extra vanilla and milk to get the consistency of glaze.

I had to add more milk to get this to work as a glaze.  I checked to see if I had written something down wrong for the recipe.  The taste was okay, but nothing extraordinary.

At first I thought that I had misread the liquid measurements because it was so thick.  Then I read the other reviews and adjusted the liquid accordingly.  I also added about 1/2 teaspoonful more of vanilla because it tasted so sugary to me.  I used this as a glaze for cinnamon rolls.  My boys and honey sure liked it!

I tweaked this glaze (like that's something new lol) and it turned out very well,as others have hinted use the milk ratio that is purported in this recipe as a guide. You will have to add milk until it's to your personal approval.

Definitely needs extra milk and butter, as other reviewers have mentioned. I would recommend doubling the amount of butter and then adding additional milk until you find the desired consistency. Once I had added milk and found the right consistency, it turned out quite yummy. I put it on top of a strawberry bundt cake from a cake mix and it is very tasty.

It was really good, but teaspoonfuls of milk need to be TABLESPOONS instead.  I didn't sift the sugar but will next time.  Will definitely make this again.

This glaze is just the thing for topping off that baked item needing one, last, little touch! I actually mix this right in a ziplock Baggie so that once it is the right consistency I just snip the corner of the bag and squeeze out the icing. Once finished the Baggie can be thrown away and that's one less bowl to wash!

Added cinnamon and nutmeg for icing on pumpkin bars since I didn't have cream cheese for frosting.  Turned out great! Can easily be thinned or thickened.   The additional spices add a nice color to it also.

2 and a half teaspoons milk...what a laugh. It barely even wet the confectioners sugar. your going to half to add at least two more, but be careful its really easy to add to much. (I did that the first time and it all ended up on the plate and not my cake.) Add one teaspoon at a time and whisk until its all one big sugar glob and then just dribble it in a drop or two at a time. (yes just a little at a time) When the edges of the sugar glob start to get runny and break away your probably have enough just whisk, whisk, whisk, until its all smooth. The best consistency will take about a minute to settle and then another minute to gently run down the sides of your cake.

i only used milk and confectioners sugar the first time i made this. i like it simple so i can add it to a bunch of different desserts. i usually do 2 c. suger and 2 T milk, i have added a touch of vanilla extract to it a couple times but i do like it with just the milk and sugar.

This was so very, very good. Just easy, breezy to make. I did use a little more milk, but otherwise stuck to the exact recipe. I've served it over a chocolate torte, as well as scones I made. This is a great addition to my recipes, and I will use this again and again. Thanks so very much for the great recipe!

Definately use tablespoons for the milk- that surely had to have been a typo- and everything else was perfect! If you want a thinner glaze, use more milk. I just added it one tablespoon at a time until it had the consistency I needed. If I ever want a thicker glaze I will use this same recipe, just with less milk.

This was a really good recipe.  I did agree with others that it needed more milk so I used about a tablespoon or a little more of milk in this.  I also like almond extract in my icing so I added about 1/4 tsp of that too.  Our cinnamon rolls this morning were soooooo yummy!

A great glaze! It does need a little more milk but very tasty. I threw in some cocoa powder and made mine chocolate,and it turned out great!

This was a great recipe! Like others I changed the milk to tablespoons. Very easy recipe to adjust how you want it. Just add milk to your desired consistency!

Turned out perfect! You can vary the thikness by adding to/subtracting from the milk. Drizzled over oatmeal cookies and was a huge hit.

I increased the milk and added some mint extract.  I also let it set for awhile before drizzling on my chocolate bundt cake.  Everyone absolutely LOVED it!

I'm glad I read the reviews before making this. It meant that I was expecting to have to add more milk. I probably used 2 to 3 T to get the consistency I wanted. I accidentally added a full teaspoon of vanilla but I didn't think this made it too stongly flavoured. This is a beautiful glaze which sets perfectly and added the finishing touch to Nutmeg Feather Cake from this site. Thankyou Jamie.

Used this recipe this week for a cinnamon cake for work.  Everyone thought it was store bought because the cake looked so good.  Will use this recipe again and again.  The milk measurement is off and should be tablespoons instead of teaspoons.  I recommend usng more vanilla extract and also using the clear vanilla to keep it nice and white.  Thanks for sharing!!

Yummy glaze! I put on top of a chocolate bundt cake. I did have to add more milk than the recipe called for. I used almond extract and colored the glaze with orange food coloring, so it looked more like halloween colors. I topped with crushed walnuts. Very easy glaze.

I loved how great this turned out. I used it on home made Cinnamon rolls and it was great. It defiantly needs more milk, but other than that it was easy to make and work with. I am saving this one.

I tried a 1/2 recipe of the vanilla glaze.  It definately needed more liquid added and then it was fine.  I used it to ice ginger cookies.  My kids really liked it.

I try to make a recipe exactly as written by the sumbitter the first time I make it, which is why this recipe only gets 3 stars.  2 1/2 teaspoons of milk wasn't enough to even wet all the sugar.  When I added enough extra milk to make 2 tablespoons it was perfect, and with that alteration I would probably give it 5 stars.  It's so easy and uses simple ingredients I usually have on hand.

For my daughter's fifth birthday I made star shaped sugar cookies on a stick (princess wands) and covered them in this glaze with bright pink sprinkles. I had a mom call me up just to find out the glaze recipe. It was delicious and easy to make I  just mixed it up with a fork. I have been using this recipe ever since.

This was good glaze but like other reviewers I added a bit more milk to get it to a glaze consistency. I didn't change anything else about the recipe and while I did enjoy it over cinnamon-sugar cookies, it won't be my "go-to" recipe when I want a Vanilla Glaze. There was something about it that was different and I can't figure it out it is. I may make this recipe again with a few changes recommended by other reviewers. It was quick and easy.

Yummy glaze.  I used 2 1/2 cups of flour sifted, 2 TBSP of unsalted butter, 2 1/2 tbsp milk and 1/2 tsp vanilla.  Salt was added per the original recipe.  I had to microwave for a few seconds before drizzling on a chocolate bundt cake.  Will definitely make again!

Great recipe.  The milk units should clearly be in tablespoons, as 2.25 tbl of milk was barely enough.  A few suggestions: I used cream instead of milk and it made a very rich glaze.  I also followed the instructions of another reviewer and replaced 1/4 cup of sugar with a tablespoon of light corn syrup and was happy with the results.  Finally, a tip for those who have trouble with the viscosity of the glaze: pour your glaze, as thick as it is, into a measuring cup.  Then microwave for 15 seconds.  This will loosen it up considerably without watering down the glaze.

Quick, easy, and tastes great. One suggestion, the recipe calls for only 2 1/2 tsp and I needed to add about 2 tablespoons. Other than that the recipe worked great!

I used lemon oil rather than vanilla extract for a lemon bundt cake glaze. I know it was suppose to be "Vanilla" but I used this more as a guideline to go with the cake. Please don't scold me. It tasted great!!!

Has a very strong taste of vanilla.  I like it that way, but others that want a more subtle flavor might want to cut back on the vanilla extract just a little bit.

Delicious glaze!  Very easy to put together. I followed the directions exactly and added just a wee bit more milk to achieve desired consistency. Drizzled over a (cooled) blueberry cream cheese pound cake.  Yum!

I would give 4 stars for taste, but not for texture. It came out crumbly and there was not enough milk. I added more than what the recipe asks for;I added more than even 1 tablespoon of milk. With these changes I would reccomend for a glaze.

Very good, easy to make glaze. I did not have confectioner's sugar, so I used 1/2 cup of white sugar and then microwaved the concoction to turn it into the right consistency. I also used about 4 teaspoons of milk rather than the 2 1/2 suggested.

I used this glaze for Poppy Seed Bread I and thought it complimented the bread nicely.  Like others said, it's easier to add the milk gradually to get the consistency you would like.

This is a good recipe but I agree that there is a typo in the amount of milk.  I believe that it should be tablespoons not teaspoons.  I was putting it on a coconut poundcake, so I sure coconut extract and it turned out wonderful.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

This was the best glaze. I only used 1 cup of the powdered sugar. I thought the additional 1/2 c. would make it to thick. It turned out excellent! This recipe will definitely be used again!

Gotta add more milk.  I haven't tried it with corn syrup. Whisk the confectioners' sugar to eliminate lumps. Mix with a whisk,  once the milk is added. Mine has hardened within an hour on French Vanilla Frozen (I tinted the glaze blue) biscotti:)

I followed the advice of others and added milk to fix the consistency. It dried beautifully and tasted delicious!

It was great! I added pumpkin puree into it instead of vanilla extract. It just needed a tiny bit more milk. I will definitely make this again if I need to!

The vanilla glaze had a great taste. I added a little more milk for my consistency but if u like a thick glaze use what the recipe  suggest.

I needed a glaze for a cherry coffee cake for work as a coffe break treat for my co-workers and this recipe had the basic ingredients I was looking for. After reading the reviews, I added more milk,( in my case a unsweetened cashew/almond milk) for better glaze consistency. I think that ANY sort of glaze can be lifted up to the taste realms of utter delishiousness if a teaspoon of liqueur like Bailey's Irish Cream,or Bacardi rum is added. I added Carmel flavor Bailey's Irish Cream to my glaze and the consistency was spot on without adding corn syrup which I try to avoid making the glaze way to sweet.If I had some cherry flavor liqueur I think it would be sensational, but had to use what I had on hand.The cofffee cake AND glaze were a huge hit in the coffee room after George Washington's birthday.

Perfect white glaze for the hermits I made.  I had to add a little more milk for the consistency.  I also sifted the confectioners sugar. So no lumps.

This was so good! To made the glaze harden faster on my cinnamon rolls I melted the butter on low in a saucepan and added the other ingredients still with the stove on. But, the way this recipe is now is still perfect, just another method :).

I made the recipe as written, but added more milk gradually until it was the right consistency.  I used half and half for the first 2 1/2 tsps, then switched to milk for the rest. I used the glaze on the Texas Lizzies fruitcake cookies from this site. A favorite recipe for anyone who tries it!

This is a good start to a great glaze. I had to adjust the recipe like all other reviewers. I added more milk, butter and vanilla. When I did it was literally perfect. So I suggest start with this and modify to your tastes. I used on a chocolate Bundt cake, it was great.

Sooo goooood! I made this recipe using soy milk as opposed to whole milk. You'll definitely need to increase milk amount. Also because I'm a vanilla junkie I added more vanilla than the recipe calls for.

The liquid measurements in this recipe are not adequate to produce a glaze.  I added more milk and melted butter until a glaze consistency was reached.  Based on my additions, I believe the "teaspoon" of butter and 2 1/2 "teaspoons" of milk, were intended to be expressed in "tablespoons".   The reason for giving 1-star, I found the glaze to be way too salty, even as someone who likes salt.  This is despite using unsalted butter and kosher salt.  I would omit the salt entirely, or at minimum cut it down to "just a pinch".

My family loves this glaze!  I put it on thumbprint jam cookies and it was amazing!  As mentioned... milk should be converted to tablespoons.  This was very easy and I'll be putting this on LOTS of baked goodies :)

http://allrecipes.com/recipe/9838/vanilla-glaze/ ... 1 7 17 Shame on me, but  - as so many reviews got good results with changes - & with my experience with frostingmaking - this recipe needs adjustments - but with those, yummmmmmyyyyyy!  Mine: Melt 1T butter.  Add 1.8t salt & gradually add 1 !/2c SIFTED confec & 1 1/2T milk.  Add 1/4t vanilla & 1T light corn syrup.  Mine was good like that,but if your sugar isn't well sifted, you may need more milk.  I put these on lessthangreat gingerbread cookies.  Thanks for the recipe & those excellent suggestions!

I did increase the milk to Tb instead of tsp like others recommended. Very yummy! I added a dash of salt to really bring out the flavor. Superb!

There must be an error on the measurements  listed here. I ended up with a big ball of sugar. I ended up using 2 tablespoons of butter,  6 1/2 teaspoons of milk and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla.   After that it came out great.

Turned out okay but I had to add a few tablespoons more milk so that it turned into a glaze, otherwise it would clump together on the bread, but was good.

Made this heeding the warning about changing the milk to tablespoons.  Ended up needing even a bit more milk.  DELICIOUS and easy!

Simple and easy, definitely added a bit more milk. I also added some lemon zest for a bit more flavor. Next time instead of extract I want to try vanilla bean!

The milk in the recipe was very much wrong.  If you use the amount suggested, your glaze is a not quite mixed paste.  I added more milk and a touch of cinnamon.  It was average.

Made this and it turned out great with the 'Sweet Potato and Coconut Bread' on this site. The only change I made was to increase the milk (from tsp to tbsp) like others mentioned. Delicious and will be keeping this recipe for sure!

It turned out well, but not until I did some tweaking. You absolutely need to increase the butter and milk to tablespoons, otherwise its way too thick and lumpy.

Excellent glaze although some adjustments were needed as everyone else noted -- the liquid amounts aren't what they should be.  In addition I upped the butter to a tablespoon since it's a flavor I like to be able to taste along with the vanilla. I also added a dash of salt just to cut the sweet a bit. I'm always amazed at the level of flavor that little bit brings. All in all, I really like how creamy (not watery) it was. It makes nicely defined piping which is what I was hoping for.

I needed a glaze for a coffee cake and came across this. It's on the thin side. I suppose you could play around with the amounts of sugar and milk to get the consistency that you want.

I drizzled this over a pumpkin spice bread and it was delicious. I read the reviews and made the following adjustments: change the milk's measurment to tablespoons, add 1 tablespoon of butter instead of the one teaspoon, and add about 3/4 tablespoon of corn syrup. It turned out wonderfully, but I wouldn't dare try it without these adjustments.

I find it ridiculous how people are complaining and giving the recipe a 1 star for it being too thick. Usually when your icing cookies you want your icing to be a bit thick so its not flowing everywhere. And the glaze looked like it was FOR cookies. If it's not as thick as you like, add more sugar. If it's not as thin as you like, add more milk. This is a great recipe. It does not deserve all of these dislikes.

Giving this a poor rating only because it calls for 2 1/2 teaspoons of milk and it needed MUCH more! I added about 3 1/2 Tablespoons. Then, it was fantastic.

I'm afraid this review is a broken record: I increased milk to Tbsps instead of tsps, added the 1Tbsp corn syrup, and played with the sugar until it reached the desired consistency. Excellent all-purpose glaze!

It's a very good glaze but definitely listen to other reviewers to increase milk to tablespoons!

Very easy. Used this to glaze Cinnamon Swirl cake from this site. I do admit I eyeballed the milk until I got the consistency I wanted.

I make this glaze exactly as directed, except of course that there must be a typo about the milk (like everyone else says, it needs to be tablespoons, not teaspoons), and it turns out perfect every time. It's the only glaze I use anymore because it's so reliable, delicious, and sets so nicely. Thank you for a great recipe!

Yummy!! Made this to go over homemade cherry turnovers.  So good.  I scaled down the recipe since I just needed it for 4 turnovers.  Delicious.

Perfect. Just what I needed to top some birthday cake blondies.  I had dark-colored vanilla extract, though, and it threw the color off.  I know that's an obvious one, but I am a new cook and didn't think it through.  Still, once covered with rainbow sprinkles, it's beautiful!

I tried this recipe and had to change the milk quantity to 2-1/2 tablespoons to get it to mix to a "creamy" consistency. Once I did that it worked out very well and tastes fabulous on bread pudding and light chocolate bunt cake.

Very good recipe! Just made a few changes based on previous reviews: milk and butter were tbs instead of tsp, the rest were exactly as written.  It had a nice buttery flavor, and complimented very well a confetti cake made to look like a "rosca de reyes" for kindergarteners.  If you want a simpler flavor, I would keep the butter in tsp, but the milk definitely needs to be in tbs always.

I used this recipe to make a vanilla glaze for cinnamon baked doughnuts, and it was excellent. I had never used or made a glaze before, but learned from this one that a glaze shouldn't be made ahead of time. It hardens very quickly. I put it in the microwave to soften it up, but still had to work quickly to get it on the doughnuts. It didn't look pretty, but it sure tasted good. Next time I think I will use a little more milk so that it stays soft longer.

It doesn't work as written.  I was thinking maybe it's a tablespoon butter instead of a teaspoon ?  I just added more milk until it got drizzly.

THIS IS PERFECT,  but but but... you HAVE GOT TO INCREASE the milk or it's too stiff.  

Follow NattyGirl's advice.  Change the teaspoons of milk to tablespoons and it's beyond perfect!!!  Also, depending on where you live humidity can effect this glaze too.  Just add additional milk in small increments until you have a nice, oozy glaze for pouring or brushing on.  This is already printed off and put in my "FOREVER" cookbook!

For a twist, I used maple extract instead of vanilla and used it on an apple cake.  Yum! I might also make this with lemon extract and/or zest.

I really liked this glaze but found it was necessary to take the advise of others regarding the milk portion!  I added one tablespoon of corn syrup and added milk AS NECESSARY!!  That for me meant about 2 tablespoons.  If not, it's just too thick!!  But this was super easy and the taste was sooooo good. I used this recipe to glaze a cinnamon coffee cake from this recipe and it was a huge hit in my home.  Thank you for this recipe!

Make this as directed. I did not find it excessively lemony, as some reviews suggested. I sprinkled paprika over the top as well as the 1/4 C olive oil. Serve with flatbread! Great!

Super easy and perfect for the cinnamon rolls I made from this site. I do agree with many others that suggested more milk than called for in the recipe. Add milk until you reach the consistency you expect or need for your cake or pastry.

This is such a perfect glaze! I made a few tweaks though.. I followed the recipe and then I added 3 Tablespoons of Cinnamon, 2 extra teaspoons of Vanilla and a Cup more of Powdered Sugar... But It was a perfect recipe without the tweaks!

This was fantastic!  I agree with others that there might have been a typo... I used Tablespoons for teaspoons with both the butter and the milk and it came out PERFECT!  (I ended up putting in a little bit of cinnamon as well when I made this for the apple cookies. Delicious!)

As it is written, the recipe does not work and should be removed or corrected. I wish I had taken a photo of the bowl to show the consistency with only 2 1/2 teaspoons of milk. Alas, I was in a hurry and didn't read the reviews correcting this error. I did add more milk, but added too much and the glaze was too runny. So, this review is based on the recipe as it is originally written here. But, with correcting the amount of milk to 2 1/2 tablespoons, it would be 4 stars.

Just made this and used it on bite size apple pies.  Delicious!  It's creamy and smooth with a flavor that can be used on so many things.  I used half and half instead of milk and loved the results.  As with any glaze, you add liquid to achieve the thin/thickness you desire.  Great recipe.

I did not care for this recipe. I omitted the salt and it tastes a little bit better, but not much.it tastes alright if you put it on a chocolate cake and add coconut flakes on top. but still not wonderful.

I took the suggestion of some other people and added 3 tablespoons of milk instead of 2.5 teaspoons, and it turned ot great! So tasty. I used it on top of Lemon Bars instead of plain powdered sugar and they were awesome. Great recipe!

Used on a chocolate bundt that wasn't that sweet so this was just the right amount of sweetness to balance it.  Used a tablespoon of butter & corn syrup as others have suggested.  Would definitely make this a keeper!

Perfect complement to the scones that I just made ("World's Best Scones" also from this site).  Scones tend to be a a bit blah and I wanted to add some umph to it.  The glaze works perfectly - just a little extra sweetness without overpowering it.

This was very good. Next time before pouring over I will let this set up for a few. It was very thin and did not cover like in the picture. It sure was tastey though.

If you're looking for a GLAZE (like you would find on a donut or something), you need to increase the milk. I thought I wanted a glaze, but when I increased the milk to 2.5 tbsp, I didn't get what I was invisioning (something similar to the picture.) It tastes pretty good either way though

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. I followed some other reviewers by using tablespoons instead of teaspoons for the milk and butter. I put some sliced strawberrys on the top of the cake and pour the glaze over the side and top...looks really good. Tastes great as well.

The recipe as is cannot be right.  You absolutely have to increase the butter and milk - otherwise you just have some hardly moist powdered sugar.  I did not have milk on hand but did have whipping cream.  The flavor was truly fabulous.  But, the author must have meant Tablespoons where teaspoons are listed for wet ingredients.

Based on suggested changes from other reviewers, I used ~ 3 tablespoons of whipping cream, 1 tablespoon melted butter, and added 1 tablespoon light cornsyrup.  Super easy and delicious.   I really liked the fact that the glaze didn't harden like some powerdered sugar glazes tend to do.. It stayed shiny and soft.  I think next time I'll increase the vanilla extract to 1/2 teas.

Came out tasting great.  I used 2 1/2 Tbsp of milk, 1 Tbsp of butter and 1/2 Tsp of vanilla...like others suggested.  I'm putting it on a pound cake but I'm sure it would be great on cinnamon buns, cookies, breads, etc.

I omitted the butter and salt - just boiled sugar, water and vanilla.  Then stirred in powdered sugar.  Also added cinnamon, to fit the cake I was making it for.  A good base recipe.

I needed to add more milk..I think I ended up adding about 9 teaspoons total to make it the consistancy I needed and wanted for my bundt cake. It was so very tasty...love this recipe. I will save it for always and I have passed it along to my sister too! :)

Used this on top of my cinnamon rolls and it was really quite good (I've used it twice now).  Added a little cinnamon and nutmeg as well.  I'm only giving it four starts, however, because of the taste of the powdered sugar, but that seems to be part of every glaze.

Very easy recipe. Good consistency. I drizzled over cake as decoration. Will definitely make again if short on time or want to drizzle of a warm cake.
