Easy to make, but definitely needed some seasoning added.  Just barely fit in a 9/13 pan.  Way more cornbread topping than filling.  Might try again with only two boxes of mix.

Great basic recipe for a pot pie and so easy!  I did make my own changes (used biscuit dough and added lots of extra spices) but I love how simple this is and that the recipe doesn't use canned soup. Will make again.

I cut this recipe down from 12 servings to 4; however, I ended up using 1 1/2 cooked chicken breasts and 3/4 of a 28 oz. package of soup vegetables. I really think the veggies would have been very skimpy had I followed the recipe.  I tasted the vegetable mixture before putting it in the dish to bake.  It had no flavor, so I added garlic salt, basil, oregano, parsley, and poultry seasoning - just a few shakes of each.  That really helped this recipe.  The pros of this dish - I liked using the cornstarch and milk as opposed to a cream of soup, and I enjoyed the different flavor of the cornbread topping as opposed to a pie crust. It was easy to put together.

Yummy! I added fresh thyme (dried would work, too) & since I had some light cream around & nothing to use it for, I swapped out some of the milk in the filling with light cream. Definitely upped the calories & fat, but an easy way to up the richness.

The recipe was very simple, and quite tasty.  My only issue with it, was too much cornbread. The recipe asks for 3 boxes of cornbread, or muffin mix. The next time I make it I'll probably use 1 or 2 boxes at the most..

I added a bit of cayenne to spice it up, and unrolled a pre made croissant dough on the the top. Will definitely make again!

Yummy! I took other reviewers suggestions and made a couple quick easy changes. I added 3 boulion cubes to the water, and I used bisquick (it was all I had). I also added some onion powder and garlic powder, and it was a hit here. Also super easy, which is always a plus with a family to feed!
