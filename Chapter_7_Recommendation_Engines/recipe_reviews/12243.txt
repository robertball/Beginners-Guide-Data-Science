The macadamia (sp?) nuts are expensive; but I don't think you could substitute with any other nut and get the same delicious flavor. "A KEEPER"!

not the taste I was imagining, something was missing from this, maybe toasted coconut stirred in would be a nice addition.

When I got home from store ice cream was half melted:-( I used walnuts cause I couldn't find macadamia and they were ok... I used Hagen das coconut ice cream for half and butter pecan for the other half. I mixed one shot of espresso with10 oz of sanders hot fudge, put it on the half melted ice cream and tried freezing it to make a hard fudge "crust" on top... Failed, hot fudge ran to the sides and even after hours and hours did not freeze... Not the end result I was hoping for (Duke's hula pie Hawaii) - but the taste was AWESOME... The espresso made a big and good addition in taste!
