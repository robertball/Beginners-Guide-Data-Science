My husband made this for Thanksgiving and it was, BY FAR, the best turkey we ever had.  Very moist and flavorful.  Could not believe it was so good.

This turkey tasted great, was VERY easy to make, and made the whole house smell wonderful while it was cooking.

This was  fabulous! I had a a small family gathering for Thanksgiving this year so we down-sized from a 20 lb bird to an 8 lb breast. I used this recipe and instead of stuffing a whole bird with the chunked lemon and onion I placed the chunks under the breast. The chunks worked as a rack and kept the breast off the bottom of the pan. I used whole stems of rosemary placed over the chunks of onion and lemon instead of chopped rosemary, also added a few sprigs of whole marjoram. I rubbed the puree of lemon, onion and olive oil over the breast, inside it, and still had some to smear under the skin where I could. This made the most delicious turkey breast you could imagine. Whole breasts often are dry to the taste after cooking but this was very moist. My family wants this again!

My husband and I selected this recipe for our very first thanksgiving together. We've never made turkey before. This recipe was easy to follow. It was a hit!  Very juice and flavorful! I suggest the following: For FLAVOR - don't forget to add salt to the marinade.  And apply some of the marinade between the skin of the turkey and the meat (as well as on the skin) and let it sit overnight.  For MOISTNESS - cook the turkey upside down for the first half, then turn it right side up for the second half. Also baste every half hour.  We had a 24lb turkey and it took longer than the suggested time. So plan for extra cooking time.

Look no further.  This recipe delivers the most beautiful, most delicious turkey ever.  My guests gasped when I brought it to the table and the taste was exquisite.  I took pictures of nothing but the turkey, that's how PRETTY it was!  Leftovers and stock made from the carcass were also outstanding.  I will not make a turkey any other way after trying it this way.  Be sure and completely cover the bird with the oil/seasonings mixture--every inch of it--and I tented mine with foil for the first hour and a half.  Turkey heaven.

This recipe is AMAZING! All our guests raved, from the 6 year old to the adults! Tender, juicy, flavorful, THE turkey recipe!! It took 6.5 hrs to cook my 18.5lb turkey, alternating temps 300-325, I took the foil off the last 2 hrs. I only had 2Tbsp of chopped fresh rosemary leaves, so I added a sprinkling of dry rosemary...I also mixed melted butter & olive oil to make 1/3cup...and I used salt & pepper, about 2Tbsp of each to the rub...it was still fantastic, the house smelled fabulous, and the leftovers are yummy!

I made this last year as my first Thanksgiving turkey.  THERE WERE NO LEFTOVERS!!  Everyone kept complimenting that it was the best thanksgiving turkey they'd ever eaten.  Even, my mom!  Exceptionally flavorful and juicy.  The thyme and citrus really add that "special something".  I'll be making it this year, too, at the request of all who attended last year.

Excellent! Great taste. I used a turkey breast instead of a whole turkey.

WOW!!! This was the best turkey I've ever had!!! The seasoning scared me a little that it may be too aggressive but I was soooo wrong.  The combination of seasonings in the turkey mixed so beautifully with all to the other food served and the smell was fabulous!!  I will be using this one from now on!!

This was the first turkey I ever made on my own and it got rave reviews.  I had to use dried rosemary on the rub because by Thanksgiving eve I could only find one small package of fresh in my whole town!  My 15lbs turkey took 3+ hrs. to cook (eventhough this recipe suggests 2-3) so I started getting pretty nervous about it drying out but it remained moist and flavorful throughout the entire bird probably thanks to the lemon.  After almost 4 hours there were still a lot of pink spots but I had a free range turkey which I've heard can be colored that way even when done.  Regardless, it was great and has created some of the best leftovers ever!

I tried this recipe this thanksgiving, and it worked out allright. Fairly okay as turkey goes. The turkey had good flavor, not much drippings, but that may have been the bird. All in all a very successful first thanksgiving on my own!

The best turkey I've ever made.  The bird is moist and the flavors get through to all the meat in a wonderfully subtle way.  

For years I tried to get my family to switch to ham for Thanksgiving because turkey is so blah.  Year after year they keep insisting that I cook up a bird, so each year I would try a different recipe.  I finally tried this recipe...superb!!!

I admit that I don't love turkey so when I saw this recipe had 5 stars I decided to make it for company thinking it must be good.  It was nothing special, I've had better.

This was the very best turkey I have ever made.  I did stuff it with the lemons etc. and marinade it the night before. But the family raved. Thanks.

I've used this recipe for Christmas and Thanksgiving every year for about 3 years and every time it comes out juicy and delicious. The only downside is that you can't get any tasty turkey-flavored stuffing out of it since it's filled with onions and lemons. But it's worth it for the amazing turkey.
