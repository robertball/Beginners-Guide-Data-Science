I enjoyed this, my husband didn't. I must have added tooooo much salt somewhere because it was very salty.

This was a hit in our house.  Really delicious and filling.  I cut the recipe in half, but ended up using a whole pound of bacon....which made it less healthy of course, but gave it a great flavor!  :)  Also added red potatoes.  I think next time we'll try (a moderate amount of) ground sausage instead of bacon.

Great recipe I loved it gave it 5 stars even though I veganized it and changed a lot there is no way this was going to taste bad . I used smoked paprika instead of bacon for that smokey flavour I also used black beans not mixed . Think this is a pretty versatile recipe u can add other veggies to . I also added a couple splashes of crushed tomatoes and turmeric.
