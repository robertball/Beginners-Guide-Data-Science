I made these with Thanksgiving dinner because my husband loves his fathers soul food but especially his collard greens.  I thought I would try to give him a little touch of his father who was not able to be with us for Thanksgiving.  He commented that these were better than his fathers.  Kootos to SouthernGirl3!  The only thing I did different was put the liquid in a crock pot on low the night before with the ham hock.   It made the meat so tender and you really get a lot of extra flavoring.  Other than that, my recommendation is to make extra because they were so good.

This is an excellent recipe I have been doing it for years.  The only thing I do differently is add about 1 TBSP honey, or syrup or even brown sugar.  This gets rid of all bitterness from the greens.  Everyone I have cooked them for loves them even the ones who say they don't eat collards.

I'm not a Southerner but I love me some greens. This is a great recipe for collards. none of the recipes I've seen on this site stress the neeed to wash the greens throughly. It takes a while and is the worst part of making them but very necessary.I also add somecoarsely chopped onion and red pepper flakes. Serve with hot sauce and cornbread, mmmmmmmmmmmmmm gooood!

Perfect.
To reduce the smell of the collards while they cook, add one pecan (shelled). Seriously, it helps.

I love greens and was dying to make my own. This recipe was great. The only thing I did differently was boiling the ham hocks for a while before adding the greens. I was very satisfied with the results and will use this recipe often.

The ingredients are right on, but not the cooking directions.  First, wash your ham hocks off and put them in a pot, cover with water, bring to a boil and cook over medium heat for about fifteen minutes and pour the water off.  Then, start a fresh pot with water to cover and cook until almost tender, but not quite done.  It could take as long as three hours.  It depends on your cookware, your fire, etc..  You can boil them on high heat, but watch them and add water if necessary. Then, when they're almost tender, but not too tender, add your remaining ingredients and bring to a boil.  You won't need too much salt and I always use crushed red pepper, a white or yellow onion, quartered, a few cloves of garlic, chopped and even some cajun seasoning.  Simmer about an hour, or until the greens are the way you like them.  Some people like them chewy, so take a few out after about 45 minutes and taste them for tenderness.  These steps are necessary to keep from having your greens too salty or overcooking them.  Serve with vinegar and hot sauce, like Louisiana Hot Sauce. Yummy!

I have been trying to duplicate the collard greens I had at a friend's house a long time ago without much success.  This recipe did it!  I added a heaping tablespoon of sugar to the recipe to provide a hint of sweetness and found the flavor I had been searching for.  The vinegar cuts the bitterness and really cuts the odor while cooking.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I've always had the worst time making greens. However, this one came out amazin'! I cooked the ham hocks in the liquid for half an hour prior to adding the greens. I also added 1 tablespoon of sugar and half an onion(chopped). Came out quite tasty!

These were great! I used smoked turky necks, since I don't eat pork. I also used 1/2 broth and 1/2 water. They were flavored well. I fixed some cornbread and ate them with it....SO GOOD!

THESE ARE THE BEST collard greens I have ever had! I am not a true southern since my mom is from New York and my dad from Minnesota, so after marrying a Georgia boy and living in South Carolina, I desperatley wanted to make collard greens comparable with his mothers. Hubby said these tasted different but were equally good! And surprisingly, I loved them as well. I did alter the recipe slightly though. I halved it because it was only for the four servings and then used frozen collard greens already chopped (only b/c the store was out of fresh though!) I used Goya ham flavoring in place of the ham hocks. Then I added some finely chopped onion and cayenne or red pepper to it as well. SPICY! I will never cook collard greens any other way again. THANKS!

I made these for New Years and used hog jowl instead of ham hocks and they turned out wonderful!  I did cook them on low for about five hours.  They just kept getting better.  I am from Chicago and my Southern friends said they were really good and couldn't believe a Yankee could have made them!!!

These were delicious, tender and easy to make! I did follow the suggestion of some of the reviewers and added 1 TBSP brown sugar to cut bitterness. I also stirred in a few dashes of cayenne just because I like it :) This is an awesome recipe! I didn't even use salt because the salt from the broth and the hocks was plenty enough to season them just perfectly. Thanks for sharing!

Truly (as a girl that learned this from a southern cooking Grandmomma) is THE southern collard greens.  Must add cornbread to complete.  :)  Oh, tip to cut bitter is add a pinch of baking soda (works for sweet tea too to cut bitterness).

I was looking for another way to make collard greens but I wouldn't even chance this recipe. It takes more than 1hr 15 min to cook the ham hock. I'll stick with what I know.

I'm a Chinese/Hawaiian girl married to an African American and I never tasted greens till I met him.  I've been looking for a recipe to surprise him with because he's always saying how he misses greens.  So I made this recipe and only changed a few things based on others reviews.  I use 1 lb of greens (not 1 bunch), a pince of red pepper flakes, 1 lg onion, 2 cloves of garlic, 6 slices of bacon (fried and cut up), and 3 tbsp of Liquid Smoke.  I also put the ham hock overnight in the slow cooker to make it tender and then used the liquid as the "water" for the recipe.  My husband couldn't believe this was my first try and loved it.  He said it was right up there with his mom's greens (and she's a good ol' girl from Alabama).  I was thrilled and will continue to use this often.  It was soooo easy.

Excellent!  Not bitter at all!  I made this recipe at the last minute, so I did not have the ham hocks so I used two slices of bacon.  I also threw in a tablespoon of honey, red pepper flakes, onion bits and a couple sprigs of thyme.  VERY good.  I am no longer afraid of this vegetable!

I ABSOLUTELY love this recipe.  I've been looking for a recipe to raise my family on, and I hit the jackpot with this one.  Since I have big eaters in my family, I have to double the recipe.  That's where my slow cooker comes in handy.  I make my own chicken broth, so that helps too.  I always slow cook my ham hocks in my broth and vinegar.  That seems to produce the best flavor.  Then I strain the broth before using it for the greens.  Whooo!  My husband says "my" greens are the best ever.  Thanks, from one Southern girl to another!

These were yummy. Very flavorful. I did add a little hot sauce just for an extra kick but these were finger licking good. This was my first time using pork instead of Turkey meat and this was a good change. Keeps you from using a lot of seasonings which is a plus. Will make again!

Awesome. I did add a few more items to this recipe to make it like down home greens. I added some chopped onions, and sliced hot sausage links. I also added about 1/8 cup of chopped pecans, to reduce the strong smell that the green make when you cook them.  It works perfect every time. My fiance and daughter both ate these , even though neither one of them like greens, so they say. :-)

Sensational! I have been trying to make collard greens for years, to no avail, this recipe changed that. I prefer a softer texture, so I cooked them for five hours instead of one. Thank you!

Love this recipe and it's simplicity! I do not use ham hocks, I used chopped ham from my bone-in ham and let this simmer in my crock pot for hours. Other than that substitution and cooking in a crock pot I followed the recipe exactly. Thank you for a true recipe!

Great way to make a lower-carb veggie side dish. They were tasty but more soupy than I expected.  Next time I'll cut back on the liquid.  My BF loved them and he "doesn't like collard greens."  :)

The chicken broth made a huge difference and when I cooked them a little too long waiting for the other dishes to get ready, I just added another can of chicken broth and took them out of the pot.  Simmering hot in chicken broth in the bowl was perfect texture for serving!

This was a great treat! I could not find smoked ham hocks, so we broiled ours and added a little bacon to get the smoky flavor.

Cooking early for dinner, and I am not sure that I can wait to eat them.  I've gotten other recipes for collards on this site and this is by far the best!  So very good.  Followed the basic recipe to the letter, minus the hocks (used smoked turkey wings).  Oh, I did simmer the turkey wings for about an hour in the broth and water before adding the greens because that what mom does).  Also added about tsp of dark brown sugar and dash of red pepper flakes.  I used kosher salt and black pepper in the grinder to taste.  Plan on looking at the rest of your recipes Southerngirl3.  Muy bueno!

Excellent receipe. I used a quart of the low sodium chicken stock and cooked all day long. Soak the greens in cold water, rinse, stack 4 or 5 leaves on top on one another; roll the stack and slice in 1/4 rounds, turn the cutting board and slice the rounds again. Easy and perfect size for cooking. I use the stems too.

Excellent!  My father passed away unexpectantly and he made the best greens ever.  Unfortunately, I never got the recipe from him.  I made these at a recent family get together and the pot was EMPTY by the time everyone left.  Thanks so much for this one!!!

So.. I'm a vegetarian, so I needed to adapt this recipe :) 

- used frozen collards in 3 cups of water with a vegetable boullion cube, added 1/2 onion chopped, 1 tsp minced garlic, 1 tbsp cider vinegar, 1 tbsp honey, salt and pepper. High heat till boiling, then simmered for 20 minutes. Yum!!!

Awesome recipe! I tripled the ingredients to make a larger batch. Cooked all ingredients about 1/2 hour before adding collards. Added 2tbs brown sugar to decrease bitterness. I also cooked the greens about 2 1/2 hours to get them a little more tender. Definetly a keeper!

These were delicious. Just like grandma used to make. They were out of smoke ham hocks at my grocery store, so I substituted smoked turkey legs. Mmm, mmm, good! I served these with pot roast, black eyed peas spooned over cornbread, and a bottle of "pepper sauce" to pass around. Grandma would be proud.

Yum!  Everyone (including individuals who don't usually like collard greens) loved them.  Thanks so much!  I added a pinch of sugar and a dash of hot sauce at the end as suggested by fellow ARers in the exchange (to help with bitterness).

Best collards ever! My husband is from Alabama and I am from Illinois. I made these for him the first year we were married and he has raved about them for 7 years. He even said they were better than his memaws and that is saying a lot :)

Fantastic! I cut my collard greens right down to the stem (very small pieces) this addded a sweet flavour). I also used a tablespoon of Red Wine Vinegar (not a lot). Thank you so much. Our neighbours couldn't get enough

I've always avoided collard greens, thinking I wouldn't like them. Made this for our New Year's dinner and was pleasantly surprised that I actually ENJOYED them! I used one really big ham hock and cooked it in the broth in a crockpot for a few hours - then transferred to pot where I added/cooked the rest. Really glad I tried this!

These greens are really great. I add some Frank's hot sauce & it's good to go. The pot liquor could be served in a cup as a soup! I do a rough chiffonade on the greens & go back & do a couple cross cuts. The longer pieces of greens can be hard to eat. Try this recipe you won't be disappointed.

When you get collards in your CSA and have Easter hambone in the freezer, this recipe was perfect. In the arena of collard greens, which we eat only when necessary, DH said it was very good and my 2 y.o. ate some. I followed tips to add 1T of brown sugar; hope it helped. My taste buds are on vacation, so I can't judge at all.

I guess I owe this recipe a quick review. I've made it an embarrassing amount of times in the 8 months since I moved to the south. :-) All I can say is, who knew greens were so darn good?! This recipe is perfect and I wouldn't change a thing -- except maybe to double it.  Thanks for helping make me a real southern cook!

I tried this recipe with the left over hamhock I had and it turned out AWESOME!  My husband kept telling me how good it was! I put mine in a pressure cooker for about 4 minutes then added the hamhock I had simmered earlier. Let it simmer together for about 30 mins. Thanks so much!

This recipe is fantastic! I do vary it slightly though. I add 2 teaspoons of red pepper flake and I simmer the ham hocks in the broth for about 45 minutes before adding the greens. I remove the hocks and pick off the meat and toss it in with the greens.

This was AWESOME. I've always loved greens and wanted my kids to like them so I could make them more. I tried this recipe and it was a hit. Only thing was that I didn't have fresh collards so I used the frozen ones. I also used chicken bouillon instead of broth and as other have suggested, I added a tbls of brown sugar to take out the bitterness. The sugar did not make it sweet at all.  I also cooked the ham hocks a bit before adding the greens. A new staple to our menu THANKS SO MUCH Southerngirl!

I be lovin' me some greens!  I had to learn how to cook collards cuz they're NOT like others that cook up quickly.  I also put in some chopped onion and Tabasco sauce.  (Diced up smoked sausage rocks as well).  They'll cook up quickly in a pressure cooker in 10 minutes.

This recipe is ALL that!!

I have never cooked collard green until today. My picky kids wanted seconds! Some small changes I made: Used packaged concentrated tubes of chicken broth, rather than the can. Used 1/2 smoked turkey leg for flavor, since we dont eat pork (If you use the whole leg, the smoked turkey might be overwhelming in taste). Put a Tablespoon of brown sugar with the vinegar. I think I will use 1/2 tablespoon of vinegar instead, cause it still had that vinegar taste (Thats the purpose of the brown sugar, to eliminate that taste). Oh man, this will be a favorite at te table. Especialy since my kids wil eat their veggies!

This is the perfect recipe for collard greens.  I grew up in the South and could eat greens every day.  This is five star on its own, but after I made it the first time, I added red pepper flakes and a bit more vinegar to mine.  I like spicy greens!

we had never had collared greens - these are so good - using a good smoked ham hock is very important - we simmer apr 8 hours to insure the greens are so tender & the flavor is right

Great recipe! The only thing I changed was the time. I got the fire as low as I could get it and left it there (cover on) all night, and all day, stirring occasionally. I heard if you do the same thing with green beans, they come out amazing. Can't wait to try it.

I did as one of the other review suggested and added a rounded tbsp of sweetener (splenda) and it came out perfect. I didn't have ham hock so I just used about 4 slices of bacon and it was fabulous. I will try it with the ham hock next time. Thanks!

This is the best recipe for collard greens!  I didn't think I'd find anything better than what I ate in West Africa but I did.  I used 2 smoke ham shanks and 32 oz chicken broth with water in slow cooker all night.  Woke up to a wonderful aroma!  Used 2 bunches of collard greens.  Agree to coarsely chop onions.  Minced onions make the predominate flavor onion.  Not good.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!  This has become a very regular recipe.

This was my first attempt at cooking collard greens and this recipe was a huge success!  The only thing I did differently was use regular chicken broth cause I didn't have condensed chicken broth. I also don't think one bunch of collards equals 8 servings...cause it barely feed 4 people ;-)

made this with smoked turkey wings - took all the meat of the bone before adding to the pot. Next time I'll cook the meat and liquid before adding the greens. Overall very good -close to what I'm used to (my family is from the south)

I got some collars and turnip greens in my csa. box th8s weekend and had no idea what to do with them since I have never eaten or cooked them before. so I decided on this recipe and they were delicious!!! I did use a little less than half just regular verge broth and the rest water for the liquid because I was worried about it being too salty. I also added just a bit of honey like others suggested. I ate them with cornered and sime caramelized onions. So good!!!!

My only complaint about these is that they are too salty with ham hocks *and* chicken broth, so you need to use low-sodium broth (or reduce it to one can broth and substitute more water). Otherwise they are super tasty.

My husband loves collards and I've made them a number of times.  After using this recipe, he said, "you finally got it"  these are super!  I did ad both chicken broth and some pork to flavor.  Even my little boys decided that they finally like collards!

DELICIOUS!!  That sums it up in one word! My husband of 34 years if from the north and would NEVER touch greens from the south.  I convinced him to take one bite, and he was hooked.  I wanted to take a picture of him sitting at the table with collard greens on his plate. I did make a couple of changes or rather additions.  I added some sugar, some Balsamic vinegar, crushed red pepper flakes, a pinch of baking soda and just a splash of lemon juice.  This recipe is just delicious!  A true southern dish!

Absolutely DELICIOUS!  These are the best southern style collards, I have ever put in my mouth!  I did 2 bunches of collards so I made a couple of changes:  First of all, I only used one ham hock.  I used 3 cans of chicken broth.  I decided not to double the broth. No need to. I just used a little extra water.  I used 2 tablespoons of vinegar and plenty of salt and pepper.  I cooked these for two hours.  In my opinion, one hour just isn't enough.  Plus, the longer you cook them, the better they are!!!!  :-)    I used two bunches, because collards tend to cook way down.    I highly recommend this recipe!  You have never had real southern style collards, until you've had THESE!    Beth Wilson Raleigh, NC

My wife said it was better than her Grandmother's. Wow ! Only thing I did differently was add a tablespoon of brown sugar. Also if you are new with collards be sure to wash them several times & I always cut out the big stems off the leaves.

This is a wonderful recipe and my gang gobbled it up. In addition to the hock, I also added in some chopped bacon. I let it simmer for a couple hours and served it the next day. Flavor was fantastic and went great with our fried chicken. Thank you!!

If this recipe had more rating stars i would max them out. This recipe is great. I followed the recipe to the exact. I can't figure out why some change the ingredients and give the recipe a lower rating.

Being from Charleston, collards is something every girl should know how to do. Although I don't personally care for them (no matter how they are prepared), this recipe received praise at two family "Sunday dinners" and Thanksgiving. My only suggestions is that they cook significantly longer than an hour. I usually put them on the stove in the morning and let them sit as I don't think you can overcook a collard but oyu can certainly undercook them. Have pepper sauce available for the die hard greens eaters. Enjoy.

Perfect! I used mustard greens because I like them better. Next time I will try this with a mixture of collard, mustard & turnip greens. Best darned greens I've ever made tho!

Pretty good.  This was my 1st time cooking greens.  I would add something else for some cajun spices to bring out a little more flavor, and would try adding mustard greens too.

Gotta love the collard greens.  I didnt have ham hocks on hand so I used smoked k-basa.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  I know, I should have used ham hocks, next time I will.

I had a friend who made the best collards.  They were never bitter.  I tried this and added brown sugar but it was still terribly bitter.  What's the secret?

This recipe was ok, still not exactly what I was looking for! I was looking for southern greens you would find at a bbq restaurant or deep in the south at grandma's. This wasn't quite it, though it was not "bad."

Really salty.  The condensed soup has your daily allotment of sodium, not to mention the ham hocks.  The collards got tender before I was able to get any little pieces of meat off the hocks so my dish didn't look like the picture.

I have never had collard greens before.  These were wonderful.  I used a ham bone instead of ham hocks.  And then I cooked them for about 1 1/2 half hours.  The flavor was very rich and tasted great.

Delicious recipe for collards that I have to have on New Year's Day with ham and black eyed peas.  I followed the recipe exactly but decreased the water because I didn't want that much liquid.  I cooked the ham hocks for an hour in the broth prior to adding the collards.  I added a few dashes of red pepper flakes and a few tablespoons of sugar at the end to cut the bitterness.  Thanks for this great recipe!

I tried this recipe and it was great! I am not a Southerner, however I am dating a true Georgia boy and he loves his greens. This recipe was really easy to follow, especially for someone that has never even bought collard greens before. The only thing I would add is that the greens need to be watch throughly before cooking. Also, I used turkey necks instead of the ham hocks (it was his preference). I simmered the necks on chicken broth and with half of a chopped onion, salt/pepper to taste for several hours and then added the greens and simmered for several more hours. I did added a tbsp of brown sugar and vinegar. He loved them!

Excellent!  The best collards I've ever made!  I think the chicken broth makes a huge difference.  For the vinegar, I substituted about 1 tsp. lemon juice, and it gave the dish just the right amount of "snap."

Excellent. Lots of flavor in the pot liquor. I made sure not to overcook them so they could rest in the liquor and absorb as much flavor as possible.

I have been cooking greens forever... thii my basic recipe but I also have found to add a bit of "kick" simply add 1/4 cup jalapeno pepper juice (not the peppers they'll make it too spicy).  I also add a small can of crushed pineapple while cooking and my kids eat them up!  The added sweetness counteracts thenatural after bite of the collards.

I really enjoyed this.  Not sure what to do about the Ham hocks, though.  I found them indedible.  Are they just for flavoring the greens or does one eat them?  The only reason I'm going 4 stars instead of 5 is my family just didn't appreciate it as I did.

I love collards. I cook the hamhocks for about an hour or so depending on the size of the hamhocks before adding the collards. I like my hamhocks very tender and falling off the bone. I also add 2 to 4 of a tablespoons of sugar to take away the bitter taste.

I can't get enough of these greens!  I followed the receipe exactly except for letting the greens simmer for a couple of hours versus an hour.  They were very good and I throughly enjoyed them!  Thanks for sharing!

Maybe I used too many hamhocks,(the package contained four 1/4" slices), but this was far too salty. I did add a tsp of kosher salt because I had no idea of the saltiness of the hamhocks.  I can tell the basic flavor is excellent...just too much salt.

This was my first time making collards and I used this recipe.  Did everything just as the recipe calls, they turned out excellent, my mom says,"Now you can make the traditional collards during the holidays from now on", they were great!

Very easy to make. I purchased pre cut greens to cut down on time. Simmered for 4 hours to tenderize the stalks. Added a couple of garlic cloves as well.

Too salty. The flavor is good, but I could only eat a few bites before starting to get that drinking-seawater feeling I usually only experience when I've been nibbling green olives. Water didn't help, even. I'm going to try it with water instead of broth, and only one ham hock. Collard greens are naturally good, to me at least, and only need a little flavor, not a lot of salt.

First time ever eating collared green. It was pretty good! I used 16 oz diced ham steak, 2cups of turkey broth I got from thanksgiving dinner which kept in freezer, sliced onion and collared green. Not even salt. Why? I simply forgot to.  :-D

I tried this and I'm not sure it came out the way it was supposed to, but I'm not a fan. I think ham hock is a little too heavy for the taste I was looking for.

3 1/2* These greens turned out AMAZING because: I doubled the recipe, added a packet of dry onion soup, a tsp of cayanne, and chopped salt pork. I also used the bagged COUNTRY MIX of greens which is turnip, mustard and collard. Once served, I also like to add a tbs of vinegar to my portion. I love the ZING!

GREAT. Made "VEGETARIAN" w/ no meat, more onions, little garlic, and some red bell peppers, and 1/2 tsp of liquid smoke. Meat eaters Loved it and veggies couldn't believe I didn't use meat. (I used veggie broth)

These collards were excellent.  There were people at our house who said they usually don't like greens and they really enjoyed these.  I added a little brown sugar as some have suggested.  This will definitely be our "go-to" recipe for collard greens.

This is SO yummy!  I followed the recipe but put in some of my own additions.  I couldn't find any ham hocks so I just used a small ham cut up into slices.  I boiled the ham slices in water beef broth for 45 minutes before I added the collards.  I also chopped up half a onion and 2 jalepenos.  For spices I added cayenne pepper and creole seasoning...I don't have measurments I did it by sight and smell.  They came out PERFECT..not too soggy or too crunchy!  We are going to eat them tommorrow with pinto beans, cornbread and mashed potatos.  A perfect southern meal!

good recipe although mine come out too salty for my taste...that was probably my wrong doing.  They do sell collard greens already cleaned and cut in big bags at Wal-mart.  I discovered this after I made them.  I will definitely give this another try

Great recipe. I did alter it a bit after reading some of the other ratings. I added 1 tbsp of honey to the pot, and I had already used my ham hocks for my black eyed peas. So, I used hog jowl instead. It turned out very good.

Very good! My husband said he doesn't like collards but we didn't have any leftovers! The only change I made was to the ham. I coudn't find ham hocks so I bought I slice of bone-in ham. I chopped half and threw the half with the bone in whole.

THANK YOU SOUTHERN GIRL3    I learned how to cook watching my mom VERY closely, and I've never liked to ask my sister for recipes, as I like to remember Moms way or experiment on my own. Moms been resting for awile, but you just helped me recreate the exact way her collards tasted. I made Lyn B's high temp round and your collards for Christmas and got rave reviews from our guest.

Great Easy Recipe for collard greens. Flavorful and Fast but you may want to extend the cooking time a little longer for the greens to be tender ( 1.5 to 2 hours in total simmer time). I did add some cut okra ( I am from the South and this is a requirement) and I used leftover/fatty pieces of ham from my Christmas ham instead of buying ham hocks. I also added a little sugar ( 1 TBSP) as suggested by some others. The recipe worked well for me.

5 Stars and Two Thumbs up. I did not have ham hocks and substitute a few slices of turkey bacon and a few hunks of the end of an ham I prepared for dinner along with the greens. I also did not have condensed chicken broth on hand and substituted homemade broth. I was skeptical of using as much water as the recipe called for figuring the greens would release water too; however, I did not change it. About an hour later, I feel in love. I was so proud considering I had never made greens outside of heating up a can, LOL. Great recipe. May not taste like the ones your (grand)mother cooked all day but for about 75 minutes of your time you will have some darn good greens!!!!

Wow, this was delicious. I added one chopped onion, 1 bay leaf, and boiled the ham hocks in the broth for 30 min before adding the greens (took bay leaf out at this point). Omitted the salt and pepper.

My collards were so flavorful and tender.  I cooked them a little longer and added a bit more vinegar.  Yumm.

Made as stated with the exception of using Condensed Cream of Chicken because I didn't read the ingredient list completely. Served with Grilled Italian Pork Chops and Green Bean Bundles.

This was really good. I followed the recipe exactly.  I didn't get very much meat off the ham hocks, so next time I think I will try using smoked neck bones.

So good.  Very comforting.  I omitted the water and the vinegar.  I sauteed half an onion, 3 cloves of minced garlic in about 2 tbs. of extra virgin Olive Oil, added 3 strips of bacon, salt, pepper and red pepper flakes.  Cooked on low for about 2 hours.  Great flavor.

As always,I grew collards for someone else this year and ended up with an abundance.I wanted an authentic southern recipe and this was it.I threw this in the crockpot on low and it is fantastic.I love collards(first time eating em).I will be growing more next year just for this recipe.No sugar was needed as others have said and the smell isn't bad especially I suppose in the crock.

This recipe is great!  My husband loves it and he is from Mobile, AL.  I have made this recipe a dozen times and I have adjusted it slightly.  I simmer all ingredients except the greens in a slow cooker for 8 hours on low.  Then I cut any meat I can off of the hocks and put it in a pot along with the greens.  I pour the liquid on the greens and then simmer on the stove for an hour.  Also, recipe does not need added salt.  I also use 2 bunches of greens as this recipe provides plenty of liquid to cook 2 bunches.

My first attempt at greens for a "Southern comfort food" theme dinner party.  I used turnip greens with this and I'd say they were a success even though some of my guests were a little hesitant.  I only simmered about 40 minutes and used bacon instead of ham hocks, so I'm sure these could only be improved when using that key ingredient.  Thanks!

I tried this recipe but found that the chicken broth made the greens taste salty. I thought it was just me and my taste buds but the rest of the family said the same.  I guess I'll stick with water instead but thanks for sharing the recipe.

I never thought I could make collard greens until I tried this recipe. I did add a left over ham bone that still had lots of ham left on it and I also added some smoked sausage to it. It was amazing!!!!

Use this recipe to make collard greens for my family for New Years eve and they loved it... the only thing I will do different next time I make them is boil the ham hocks a while before I add the rest of the ingredients for more tender ham hocks.

Excellent recipe! I cannot boil water and I managed to make this perfectly. I added crushed red pepper and chopped onions! Absolutely delicious. I also used one of the other reviewers advice and placed the ham hocks in the distilled vinegar and chicken broth in my crock pot overnight. After I got home the next day, I added my greens to boiling water with salt, pepper, crushed red pepper and chopped onion and added my ham hocks and pot liquor from the crock pot to the greens and simmered them for 1 hour! Pure perfection! Thanks so much for this recipe.

I used several diced strips of smoked thick-sliced bacon since I couldn't bring myself to fork over six dollars for a four-pack of "smoked ham hocks", two of which I didn't need. But now that I know my boyfriend loves them, I won't be afraid of the hocks next time. Also, I used two bunches of collards- they cooked down so much in an hour, I only ended up with three servings, so I'm glad I did! Also, I added a T. of sugar, following other cooks' advice, and used  2 cans of chicken broth and omitted the water, since it was cheaper than buying the little condensed cans of Campbells broth. Very new taste for me!

This was great..I only had apple cider vinegar and used that. I also added about a tablespoon of sugar. It was delicious. Thank you for the great recipe.

Well, to begin with I am a real southern gal and this recipe was right up my alley. I didn't make any changes and I did as someone else had done and cooked the ham hocks in the crockpot the night before with all the liquids. These were excellent. Definitly a keeper for this old southern gal and her hillbilly husband.

I'm a southern African American & I love collard greens.  I made these last night and I have to say that these were absolutely the best I've ever had!!!!  The only thing in this recipe that was new to me was the chicken broth and I think that's what made the difference!!!
Thanks!!

Fantastic!  My father said these tasted as good as his childhood memories.  Per other recommendations, I did add a tablespoon of sugar.  Otherwise, these were great.

I made this recipe for New Years Day. I turned out great. I followed it as stated but added 1 to 2 TBSP of sugar with all the other ingredients. Everyone enjoyed it a lot!

We didn't like these. It could be we just don't like collard greens in general because the recipe sounds like it should be great. You really can't go wrong with smoked hamhocks! To me, it tasted like cooked spinach... I ate a bit, but will stick to cabbage next new years'.

I'm working a great southern menu for the holidays.  This recipe is essential.  I do believe it needs more than an hour to cook and I will no question cook the meat in a slow cooker for a while before adding the greens.  My ham hocks didn't fall apart and I'm OK with that.  I don't want to blame this recipe so I will say that I used 4 hamhocks and that could have been my problem, regardless I'm going to use smoked turkey wings in the future.  
This is a great recipe and I'm thankful I found it.

I cooked my turkey necks for an 1/2 hour and then put in 3 bunches of greens. Sauteed an onion and bellpepper and added them to the greens.  I added a little vegetable oil and let it simmer for 2 hours.  It was jammin.  Thanks for the recipe.  I always have a hard time with greens. Your recipe was very helpful.  Thanks.

Thanks for sharing this easy recipe. I normally start my ham hocks first and then add my greens. I think I like them that way better it helps make the ham hocks tender.

I have made collard greens several times for my husband, who really likes them.  I do NOT like them, but have eaten them along with the rest of the family.  This recipe was GREAT!  My daughter and I both marvelled that we were ENJOYING the collards.  I will definitely keep this as my primary collard recipe.  I did cook it a little longer than called for so maybe that helped as well.

I've been cooking collard greens with this recipe for yrs.  I put everything in a crock pot, a dash or two of cayenne peeper and add 1 shelled pecan cook low for 8-10 hrs. Basically no sweat and you'll get yourself an authentic and tender southern greens.

My first attempt to make collard greens turned out pretty well.  These were tasty but something about them seemed too greasy. Perhaps I used too many ham hocks, maybe it was the new chicken stock, one i had never used before. Regardless, these were still really good and I'll definitely make them again.

Used ham steak cut up into bite sized pieces instead of ham hocks. Served with a steak recipe along with baked potatoes. This was a quick and easy recipe & is very versatile.
