A nice twist to making traditional pancakes! I changed a few things in the recipe to fit diet and what ingredients I had laying around: I used skim milk instead of evaporated (use a little less than is recommended if you go that way), I didn't add the cinnamon, and to fit my lacto-vegetarian husband's diet, I used 1 tablespoon flax seed mixed with 3 tablespoons water in place of the egg. These changes do make it a little healthier for you, if that's the route you wish to go.

This was the first time I've tried cornmeal pancakes and they were excellent!  Very easy, too.

This is a really good recipe.  I used white cornmeal the second time and it seemed to be a bit lighter. Also I used 2% milk and added a bit more liquid than the recipe called for. I did not put in the cinnamon. My 16 year old said she like them better than 'regular pancakes'. She ate them only with butter!

These were delightful.  I used whole milk and skipped the cinnamon just because I was looking for a "savory" side dish.  They fried wonderfully in olive oil and were nice just spread with butter.

This recipe is great. I followed the recipe and I chopped up two vegi sausage patties and added them to the batter. It made a heartier more flavorful pancake that I was more in the mood for. These pancakes would even be good as a side dish for a dinner meal!

I followed this recipe exactly as written and they turned out wonderful. I made "silver dollar" size pancakes and served them with butter as a side with a spicy main course. I will try this again for breakfast and use maple syrup as suggested, and I'm sure they will be delicious. Thanks!

The recipe was a blast to make, and it was so quick. I altered it slightly and added fat free evaporated milk instead of 2% and they were just as light and fluffy as any pancakes I've ever made.  

Thanks for the fantastic brunch!

Pretty tasty. I liked the slightly coarser texture that the cornmeal gives it, but they were a little on the heavy, dense side. I did use regular milk instead of evaportated, because I was out of evaporated, and maybe that made the difference. I will make these again.

Easy and a really good taste.  They are substantial without feeling like lead in your stomach.  Good for cold mornings.

These were just okay... I will make them again, but will add sugar and more honey.

yum.. these only made 4 big pancakes for me.. so i'd say it hardly serves 8. delicious tho.  i used one egg white and a egg yolk sized dollop of applesauce instead of one whole egg, and no cinnamon. i also used white whole wheat flour instead of white. turned out great!

Delicious but to make them a bit more healthy I substituted half of floor with ground flax seed.

I make these pancakes whenever I have overnight guests, and people always rave about them!  Even my low-carb friends decide to cheat when these are on the table.

Wonderful. Some cornmeal pancakes are heavy and tasteless. These were truly light and fluffy and tasted great! I even had to use whole milk instead of evaporated and they came out just fine! Thank you!
