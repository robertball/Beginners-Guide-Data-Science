Yummy!  I used half and half and poured everything over crushed ice.  I don't know what it it about coffee flavored drinks, but they are just so good and I'm not even a coffee drinker...

Love these flavors together in anything, and this drink was no exception.  When made as directed, however, at least for my tastes, this was a little too strong. Next time I'll reduce the amount of Kahlua and use more cream or milk. (I used half and half and loved it)

I love Kahlua Lattes, and I do use equal parts Kahlua, but espresso instead of coffee.  Which is why I didn't give it 5 stars...better with espresso!

This was great, but I have to admit, I didn't measure the Kahlua. I just poured some in and tasted it until it was to my liking, but if I had to guess I would say that I did not use the full 3oz. Also, I opted to use milk to cut down on the fat, but I can only imagine how it would taste with cream...hmmm, maybe next time, lol! I will be making these often-YUM! :)
