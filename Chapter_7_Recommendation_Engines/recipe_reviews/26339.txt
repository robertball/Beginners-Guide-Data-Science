Yummy!   I too used the small individual pie shells, but every pie I have ever made like this calls for the pudding mix on bottom and the fluff on top.  So I reversed the filling and used a little less milk then the pudding called for so it was thicker. I will for sure make these again!

I think it was really sweet. I left it in the fridge overnight and the marshmellow fluff was runny the next day. We had to throw it away.

Really good and very easy to make.  Not nearly as sweet as I was expecting.  I made mine in ready-made dessert size graham cracker crusts for individual pies.  (Be careful spreading the marshmallow cream, the crusts crumble easily).  Would be great for a kid's party.  We all enjoyed this very much!

Instead of using a graham cracker crust, I smashed up some S'more-flavor PopTarts and mixed with some melted butter. Then, I pressed it into my pie pan and baked for about 5 minutes at 300. Try this with other flavors of PopTarts for other flavors of pie.

Not entirely sure what I did wrong with this.  I followed the recipe, but my marshmallow cream ended up turning everything into a soupy mess...the taste was good, but I was embarrassed to present this at my family christmas dinner.  Won't attempt again probably....but it sounds good!

This was pretty good, my son liked it, but I wouldn't recommend leaving any for the next day.  Maybe I did something wrong, but the next day the marshmallow creme was marshmallow liquid, maybe it doesn't keep well (yes, it was in the fridge!).  It still tasted yummy, will make again when I have all the neighbor kids over!!

The kids loved these.  I used the little graham crusts and put the marshmellow on top.  They looked cute drizzled with chocolate syrup.

Sounded easy and tasty, but was a disaster.  The marshmellow cream turned into liquid and leaked all over, but not sure why.  Will not try this again... What a disappointment!  Next time I will take my time and use marshmellows, chocolate chips, etc...

very easy. The kids (and the neighbor's kids) loved this and asked for more. It really does taste like s'mores.
(without the sticky gooey-ness on the hands)

My wife made homemade marshmallow top and we browned it off with a blow torch.
