To the person that claims these aren't keto you must be new to this woe.  You get to deduct all carbs from the sweetner you use so long as it is a keto sweetner.  I would estimate the net carbs around 2-3 per cookie 

These cookies are great.  Watch the bake.

Very delicious. To combat dryness I recommend adding 1 tablespoon of butter. My cookies came out delicious and I used Swerve confectioners sweetener.

The trick to these cookies is the baking time; do not overbake or they will dry out. I baked mine for about 8 minutes, or until the edges were lightly browned and the centers were still soft.  Because the recipe calls for a sugar substitute, the cookies will not have the same texture as the real sugar version; but for keto cookies, they are quite good.  Happy low carb eating!

Okay 2nd time making these, and I added 1/2 cup more of peanut butter and changed the sweetner to Lakanto Monk Fruit Sweetner 1:1.. I also cooked them for only 10-11 minutes to not dry them out and they came out perfect.

Not sure why so many people are having an issue with dryness. My guess would be the peanut butter. I make my own, and it's moist and creamy - as a result, so are the cookies. I added 1/4 Cup Coconut Flour, 1/2 teaspoon baking soda and 1/4 Cup of White Chocolate Chips (keto, of course) and the cookies came out amazing. It really improved the texture. I may also add a touch of Almond Flour on the next round. If your peanut butter is dry and hard to stir, I am sure your cookies will suffer as a result. Take the time (10 minutes) and make your own. 2 cups of peanuts, 2 tablespoons of peanut oil, 2 Tablespoons of sweetener, dash of salt, and you're off to the races. Just be sure to blend the peanuts by themselves for about a minute.. add half the oil, blend another minute, then the remaining oil, salt and sweetener. Blend until you have your desired consistency. Well worth the time and effort.

I tweaked this recipe and it was perfect, I made just as it states the first time - they were terrible ! Harder than a rock ! The second time I added a tablespoon of butter, less than a quarter cup of almond flour, and used natural pb. I think the oils in the natural pb also helped. I baked for exactly 11 minutes, came out awesome, will def make again.

I made an account just to let people know these went from oven to trash can in record time. Literally turn to dust in the hand, and concrete in the mouth. I'd rather eat carbs than these cookies. Hard skip on this recipe. Made it twice, with different PB and sweetener.  One time cooked for 15 min, the other for 12. Just awful.

I made these as directed using a monk fruit granulated sweetener.  It mixed well and did not have any grit in the baked cookie.  They key for success is letting the cookie cook adequately.  Once cooled it holds together nicely.  Very tasty! This is the first keto cookie I've made.  I'm glad it was a success!

This is a really good recipe.. super easy to make.  I used 1/2 Swerve confectioners and 1/2 monkfruit sweetener.  It didn't turn out as sweet as I had hoped, but that's my fault as I was tasting the batter and misjudged it...  but it still was tasty enough to satisfy the 'sweet tooth'... I will simply add a little more next time.  I also added 1 tablespoon of almond flour as the peanut butter I used had quite a bit of oil in it and was not as 'thick' as others, so the almond flour helped thicken it up.  This will be a recipe that I use again.. In fact,  I'll probably make a batch for Christmas so that we can enjoy a 'sweet treat' and still not blow our keto diet  :)

Didn’t want to over bake. Checked them at 12 minutes. Goo. 3 minutes more. Still goo. 3 more minutes. Decided to just let them sit the put on cooling rack. Had to gingerly transfer to cooling rack. Most separated. The taste is great. Just never achieved the “golden brown” edges. Any suggestions?

I followed the recipe exactly (ingredients, bake time and temp) and they turned out perfectly. You have to allow them to cool properly before trying to move them or they will crumble, as most cookies will.

Made it as described. Fell apart when trying to get off baking sheet. Dry and tastes just like dried PB. Save yourself some steps. Eat plain PB off spoon.

I followed this recipe exactly as written, but they turned out like sand, dry and crumbles to the touch.  I should've read other reviews first, and I would've seen others say the baking time is off.  I'll try again with less baking time.

They turned out great!  I would have given them five stars but I found them a bit on the sweeter side so I’ll cut back next time. I didn’t have dryness issues at all, baked them for 9 minutes. I also used all natural PB so maybe the oil helped.

I baked my cookies at 325 for 10 minutes. Cooled for a few minutes on parchment then carefully moved them to a cooling rack.  Once fully cooled they were not crumbly at all. I used 1 1/2 c. homemade nut butter and added Lilys chocolate chips.  Next time I will use a little less sweetener. It was a bit too sweet for me.

I made these cookies yesterday and am so pleased with how they turned out. They are delicious! I did make a few modifications to the recipe based on the reviews that I read. I added about a 1/4 cup of almond flour as well as 2 tablespoons of butter. I also added one tablespoon of coconut oil to help combat the dryness that some reviews described. I baked them for 9 minutes. Recipe made 2 dozen cookies. Will definitely make again!

As other have said, watch the bake time.
Also, make sure you use and unsweetened peanut butter.  Many brands out there are practically peanut flavoured icing.  
Also, add some unsalted butter.

They are ok, I read all the reviews and added more peanut butter and 1 tablespoon of butter and used monkfruit, They have a good flavor but are a frail cookie, not sure what to do to make them better.

I didn't make any changes.  Just a bit to dry for me.

This recipe is a nice start. It came out a little crumbly the first time but I reduced my baking time to 9-10mins at 375f.   I used almond butter the second time, swerve instead of sugar, added 4 Tbsp butter, 1/8 cup almond flour, 1/2 tsp baking powder.  I  let it cool thoroughly and it was perfect.

It’s a good recipe I should have read the reviews. I cooked mine for 14 minutes and they  crumbled when I picked it up :( but still tasty

I have made these several times and each time they come out different. I think the key is to get the timing right and I also noticed a difference using different brands of peanut butter. I have found that 12 minutes works well for me .

Very sweet and not peanut buttery enough. The texture is very cookie like and I will probably try again with less sweetener. I used Swerve, but changed out 2 tbsp of Swerve for Swerve brown. I also added a tbsp of butter like the reviews suggested and only baked for 10 minutes. Used fresh ground peanut butter instead of a creamier type. Next time, I will try with creamy pb.  For the person who said that you subtract all of the carbs from the sweetener, you have this backwards. you take the total carbs and subtract sugar alcohols and fiber to get net carbs. If you make these with fresh peanut butter and swerve, they are about 1 carb per cookie. I got 18 cookies.

I'll make these again, they are pretty good for the keto diet I am on. Definitely more dense than a traditional peanut butter cookie.

Made it and turned out really good! It was just hard to make it look nice with the fork when molding it coz it's sticking but overall pretty good fat bomb.

I made these peanut butter cookies with stevia and found them to be way too sweet. My non-low carb family members actually liked them, though. Maybe it's just my taste buds, but I'll be cutting back on the sweetener next time. I will say that the texture was just right; didn't crumble or fall apart! I rolled them into 1 inch balls before pressing with a fork, then baked for 9 minutes. Nice consistency, just too sweet for my liking.
