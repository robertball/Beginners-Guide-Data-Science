To all those poutine purists out there, COME ON!  It's fries, gravy, and cheese!  I mean it's not even really a recipe.  That said, this is a pretty good one.

Original Quebec poutine is made with white cheddar cheese curds.  Although I prefer the beef gravy described here, there is also poutine gravy which I believe is a thinner chicken gravy.

Love this recipe!  You can use mozzarella cheese if you can't find cheese curds, and packaged gravy mix if you can't find canned gravy.

This is delicious!  Of course, it's not exactly good for you, but that's not the point.  Finding cheese curds can be next to impossible in some parts of the United States, so take the time to order them online and do this recipe justice!  The first time you try this you'll be hooked, I promise!

On top of making my own fries, I would make the gravy myself instead of buying a can or powder version. You can find the recipe for poutine sauce under Beef Veloute sauce. Add fried onions and ground beef to the sauce and you got yourself a Bourguignonne Poutine. There are many variants to poutine to try beside the basic version.

This is a great way to use up some leftover gravy. I cut each potato into 8 wedges and tossed them with some olive oil, no salt seasoning, and salt on a baking sheet. I baked the seasoned potato wedges at 400 degrees, stirring every 10 minutes or so until they were nice a crispy instead of frying them. I used some shredded sharp cheddar cheese instead of cheese curds and used vegetarian gravy instead of meat gravy. This was a very comforting dish. Thanks for the great recipe!

I love poutine. Indeed it is unhealthy. I am a real french fries purist. It HAS TO be fresh ones. Sincerely. A trick to have good french fries tat are crispy outside and smooth inside it to cook them twice. You can make a bunch in advence, cook them half way and then before serving cook them until crispy. I like to use chicken gravy instead of beef.

If you've never tried ( or even heard of) poutine before. TRY THIS RECIPE. I live in Quebec and eat this very very often. So much that I get made fun of. I make it at home with frozen french fries but after trying it with homemade ones, I'll probably continue this way.

I am a French Canadian of Gaspe descent.  This is a good recipe in a pinch, however, traditional Quebecois poutine is served with a thin, homemade chicken gravy, and the cheese curds should be white.  Also, there is a Deluxe version of Poutine which is now  popular in Eastern Quebec.  A Galvode Poutine includes cooked boneless chicken pieces and green peas to the gravy - a true "down home" style Poutine which is a meal in a bowl.  Delicieux!  et Bon Appetit!

My husband was always talking about this dish, so I decided to make it.  Not exactly healthy, but a good treat.  I made it with regular brown gravy and mozzarella cheese.

Poutine may not be a "recipe" but apparently a large percentage of Americans have no idea what it is, so it's very necessary to share the secret ;) .. Personally I prefer shredded cheese (I usually use cheddar but marbled is yum!) because cheese curds do not distribute evenly, and they don't melt as well. And honestly, chicken/turkey gravies are an atrocity to real poutine - not even close to as good lol! Here's how my girlfriends and I ate it in high school: thin cut fries, shredded mozzarella cheese, beef or poutine gravy, shredded lettuce, mayonnaise, ketchup, salt and pepper.. Sounds gross but almost everyone in our school caught on to it! Tastes kinda like a big mac lol

IF YOU LIKE FRIES AND CHEESE JUST TRY IT I GUARANTEE YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!! im a french canadian living in texas and everyone i have had try poutine out here.....they absolutely loved it... i will suggest that you use a brown gravy sauce mix if you dont have poutine sauce mix at hand (i have it sent to me from quebec!!) and make it extra cheesy...ps for you real cheese fans, put some cheese on the bottom of your dish before laying the fries and gravy down...you'll thank me for it at the bottom ;) enjoy!!!! :)

Fried the potatoes in canola oil as cubes (seasoned with salt, pepper and seasoned salt x]) and used brown gravy and mozzarella cheese. Absolutely amazing. My brother inhaled it before I could even go for a second helping!

After putting the cheese curds on the fries, put them in the oven for a short time under the broiler. This melts the curds a bit. Then put the gravy on.

This was good but not the best Ive had. I think it did help making the fries myself rather than frozen though, I'll continue to do that. You've got to use white cheddar curds definatley. The only thing is finding the right kind of gravy! I just havn't found one that compares to one of the (many) Poutine dishes I had in Quebec. If you are ever in St. Hyacinthe, go to the local Hockey rink and eat the poutine there. Made with a brown beef gravy. The best I had my entire visit. I just want that gravy again! I'll keep trying to recreate it.

good recipe, although a 'real' poutine, meaning the qubec poutine, is made with cheddar courds and a chicken or veal sauce.

Perfecto. Although, I must say, never replace Cheese Curd with Mozzarella. It's never the same and it's not Poutine, it's more like disco fries. And Poutine, isn't Poo-Teen. It's Poot tseen. :) Albertan!!!

Congratulations on being one of the closest to the original recipes I've seen so far.. the only difference is, poutine is served with chicken gravy, not beef gravy, but the beef adds a nice change...

I'm from Québec where poutine was invented, so if you don't like it here, you're like an alien... I've finally found my kind of poutine, MY way - try this:
FRIES, OKA CHEESE AND PEPPER SAUCE (canned from St-Hubert is the best for this if you can find it) This way I love it!!!

Trust me when I say this, if you substitute any kind of cheese in place of the cheese curds, you will not get the same result. Poutine is only poutine when it is loaded with cheese curds. If you made this with a substitute, try it again with curds and you will be amazed at the difference.

This is the classic recipe, but it can be improved by omitting the canned gravy and using leftover gravy from roast beef. Mmmmmm.

Very easy of course but beware you will get fat!!!  Almost 800 calories but of course it is worth it.  If someone has another variation of this or adds something else that enhances this recipe let me know and post a comment.  Bacon would be a great additive but would like to have something extra.

I love poutine!  instead of frying the french fries, I used the ones you bake in the oven.  It took awhile for the curds to melt, I might have had bigger ones than requested, but my husband (canadian) said they used shredded mozarella cheese that is easier to spread.  I'll try that next time!  Other than that, this was very delicious!

I'm A purist,the best poutine I ever had was from the 'Patate Frite' Wagons prevalent in so  many rural Quebec towns. Use only fresh fries and Canadian white cheddar cheese curds. The sause is optional and was not used in the original version, but if you must, use brown beef gravy. Stroke On A Plate, but delicious!

I'm rating this 5 stars however the rating is based on my second attempt at making this. It's very good (although we use shredded cheese instead of curds). I would not use canned gravy. The first time I made this was with homemade beef gravy and it was good.  The second time we used homemade country gravy and it was even better.

Oh so yummy and indulgent.  This is full of fat and calories, but worth it once in a while.  Thanks for sharing your version.

If you're going to go to the trouble to make your own fries, you may as well melt some butter in a saucepan, add a little flour, combine it well and whisk in some beef stock to make your own gravy. Much better, I feel, than a canned gravy. Otherwise, very, very good.

This is GREAT poutine and pretty much the real thing, having spent lots of time in Quebec.  We are in Utah now and have to make what we sarcastically refer to as Deluxe American Poutine, but it is a little healthier and good cheese curds are really hard to find here.  We toss our cut up potatos in a little olive oil and bake.  I saute sweet onions, muchrooms, sliced deli roast beef and put that on along with the cheese curds if we can find them, or fresh mozz pearls if not.  In Montreal you can get poutine with Montreal smoked meat that is amazing, so we tried to replicate that, kind of....considering we can't get Montreal smoked meat...

Poutine Rocks!  I have tried every type of poutine and I prefer the ones with gravy.  I buy the Berthelet poutine gravy (powder) and make it from there!

Cheddar curs are a must!

Try varying the gravy (sauce)  in poutine. Poulet frit à la Kentucky makes an interesting one, albeit with frozen fries. But the best is the so-called "Italian Poutine", made with tomato-meat "spagetti sauce. For a healthier poutine, use steamed potatoes & low-fat 4% cheese.

I remember traveling to Banff a couple summers ago and falling in love with poutine. This recipe does it justice. I couldn't find cheese curds, but I just chopped up some string cheese and that worked pretty well.

This stuff is great. I grew up eating poutine. Now a days, they add any meats of your choice. But I like this original version the most so far. This is Canada's thing.

reminds me of when I had it in Quebec City, Canada while I was up there in the Navy in 2012, I was going to add a few grilled onions and sauteed mushrooms for extra taste but didn't have enough time, I also tossed the potatoes after being cut in a bit of seasoning salt and garlic powder, ended up really good, definitely making it again

I've been doing this for years now. I make homemade fries with my mandolin chopper, then I make the gravy from a package mix. I use turkey gravy to make it rich. And I grate up mozzarella or cheddar. Fries get covered in cheese then I put on the warm gravy and microwave for 45 seconds to melt the cheese and make it gooey. Family favourite.

actually, i give it a 3.5 rating. it was pretty good, but something felt missing. maybe for my own personal taste i would need to add meat to it. but i did like the way the gravy soaked into the fries and how the cheese melted. i used grated cheese instead of cheese curds.

Definately a favourite of mine and just how I do it..I'm from Canada myself and now that I live in NY finding poutine in restaurants etc is unheard of LOL they look at me like I'm crazy (same reaction I get when i eat french fries with mayo ;) ) In any case..you can make this with frozen fries too though obviously its not nearly as good...a note on making homeade fries...be sure you dont deep fry too hot or for too short of a time either or they wont be cooked through...You can use mozza or cheddar grated or cubed but white curds is THE WAY to go if you can and if you can make a homeade beef gravy then even better! If you've never had poutine before...TRY THIS recipe....yummy stuff! and yes unhealthy and addictive LOL

Unless any readers are living in La La land, no one can deny that this isn't the healthiest of recipes. Some people have submitted healthier options, and I very much appreciate them.

That said.....I made the recipe, sort of "as is". I don't eat like this too often, but occasionally I like to indulge in regional recipes for the experience, not for the nutrition.

I may have had authentic Poutine in Quebec, but I'm not sure. We have a food truck industry here  in Rochester that is second  to none!

We actually have a food truck for poutine, but I've been looking up recipes that I like better.

Fresh friled fries are probably best. The cheese curds are kind of special, and while I know they don't distribute evenly, it's a tasty surprise when you get a chunk of melted cheese with a bite of fries and gravy.

The cheese. I found a pkg of yellow and cheese curds. That worked, but as someone suggested, it's best to put the curds on top of the fries, return into the oven so they're a little meted. Remove to a plate or bowl.

The gravy, I used Heinz beef gravy with a little Worcestershire added. I like the tang. Heat enough up in the microwave and pour over the cheese and fries. I may try chicken or turkey gravy next time

This is a low fat, low cholesterol meal....and I've got a bridge for sale.

I haven't made it yet, but I want to point out, as someone from Wisconsin and knows how cheese works in all aspects, the curd form is probably not going to work the best. Most likely a shredded form would! Other than that, looks great!

This is exactly how I make my americanized version of this delicious food! :) YUM! When I am missing Canada, this is a treat. Also, you can usually find cheese curds in the specialty cheeses in the grocery store (in the midwest USA at least.)

This was a delicious and easy (though thoroughly unhealthy!) side dish. I'd have given it 5 stars, but I didn't cook my fries long enough and they were a bit soggy, but that's my fault and not the recipe's. To cut down on the work and prep time, I used frozen pre-cut fries rather than cut my own, and it all came together in a snap.

I love poutine.. being Canadian, and having grown up with it and all. If you're in Canada you can get canned and packaged "poutine gravy". It tastes different than beef gravy and actually makes it "real" poutine. And cubed cheddar cheese is great and all, but you really do need to use cheese curds.
