I made these tonight after not making them for a long time and decided to add a couple of tips to my recipe. I grate the fresh ginger - lots - and press the garlic so there aren't intimidating chunks of either, just lots of flavor. I cook the onions first in the wok with hot oil, pretty much to smithereens, then set aside. Then brown the sirloin strips in the wok (I get my grocery to run the steak through the tenderizer - then you don't have to worry about them getting tough). Add the rest of the ingredients and toss until hot. My oldest son and I love these and could eat them all the time, but my husband is snobbish about them so we only feast on them when he's not around. Enjoy!

Very good.  I didn't end up with a sauce, but I may have had the heat up too high, and I started with already cooked steak, so that could've  made the difference.  The flavor was still there, though, so it's all good.  I don't have chili oil and subbed sweet chili sauce--just a bit, since it is quite a strong taste. I like all the flavors in this, and served on Syrian bread that I rolled kind of like a burrito.  Thanks for the recipe Sunny!

These turned out wonderful.  I had to sub some ing. to what we had on hand, so would like to try as the recipe states and update.  Though we like ginger I did cut back a little as I did the celery and added some green pepper and instead of chili oil added some adobo chiles and juice, it's just what we had on hand.  

Cooked all the veggies, chili and sauce with the meat until about medium, browned the hoggie rolls, added the ing. and topped with provolone cheese till melted. We loved it.  Thanks for the post.

Really nice flavor!  Instead of sirloin, I used beef tender steak, because it was lower in fat.  I also didn't have any chili oil so I just added a shake of Tabasco sauce.  I split hoagie buns, put provolone cheese on the bottom and heated them in the oven so the buns were warm and the cheese was melted.  I then filled them with the meat mixture and added just a little more cheese and broiled.  The gingerroot gave these sandwiches a nice twist.  Will definitely make again.

This was fast and easy. I had this finished in less than 3o minutes from slicing the partially frozen steak to the table. I didn't have soy sauce so I used Teriaki instead. I misread the directions and used 1Tbl. of chili oil instead of only 1 tsp. I liked this sandwich quite a bit, but I love spicy and I love ginger, and this started with my favorites onion and garlic so I was already sold. The family didn't like this so maybe it's too girly (or metro) for their manly man palates of steak and potatoes. I'd eat this again, my men voted against this one.

These were very good.  I had some issues with the how the meat turned out but I know it was my fault, not the recipes.  It was way to "soupy" so I added cornstarch and served with rice.  Will do things the way sunny described in her review above.  Also, I will use green onion instead of regular.

Once you have the ingredients prepped, the cooking part takes 10 mins. It's so quick!  I left the soy sauce and chili oil (I used chili powder) out of the mixture and just seasoned each sandwich to taste.  The flavors were light yet explosive! YUM!

I wanted to use some beef I had previously cut up into small cubes, so this recipe looked great.  I chose to put the beef in my crock pot, just covered with water, added a little bit of diced onion, shook out some garlic powder and ginger powder (nothing fresh in my house), skipped the celery (too much work) and chili oil (had none), and splashed in some soy sauce.  Cooked it until the meat was done through, tasted, added more ginger and soy, cooked until husband was home and ready to eat.  I used sliced french bread (what was on hand), toasted at least enough to be hot, placed thinly sliced cheddar on each piece to melt and prevent the bread from getting soggy, and strained the beef mixture through a slotted spoon before piling it in between the bread.  I added cornstarch to the resultant broth to make a gravy for dipping for my husband.  My 2 1/2 year old son liked it, and my (picky) husband said the sandwiches were really good and agreed to eat them again.  I win!  The flavors ended up being mild, more of an aftertaste, which I liked really well.  I rated this 5 stars because it would be really good as written and was very easy to modify/hard to mess up when you don't measure, and because the ingredients are every-day sorts of food.  Thanks for a delicious dish!

This was delicious! I recommend getting your meat cut at the butchers, it will save lots of time! I used bell peppers since I'm not a fan of celery. I also cooked the onions and bell peppers first, set aside, cooked meat then added veggies back in. I sprayed hoagies with butter, added meat & veggies, topped with provolone and broiled in oven. YUM!! thanks for sharing this recipe :)

These were very good.  We used hoagie rolls from the bakery and I think the rolls were to much for the meat mixture.  Next time I make I will try with a potato roll used for hamburgers.  My kids did love these.

The ginger flavor mixed with the garlic and soy sauce so well. The meat was so juicy. I loved it! The list of ingredients is short and easy to remember at the store. We ate this on toasted hoagies with provolone cheese along with Broccoli Slaw from AR. I ended up taking off my top bun so I could taste more of the beef. :) Next time I'd like to eat this over rice.

Just like the recipe says this is easy. I can't believe I haven't thinly cut up Sirloin for sandwiches before. I didn't have fresh ginger (I know, I know) but I could still taste the ginger flavor. I didn't have the spicy oil, so I used Sriracha. Served with bacon roasted yellow squash & broccoli. Everyone really loved it, thanks!

Broiled the hoagies and added CoJack cheese. I really enjoyed this sandwich. Served with Cabbage Soup because everyone in the house is sickly.

This dish was delicious! We were looking for a ginger beef type stir fry recipe and decided to make this minus the hoagie buns and chili oil as we didn't have any. I can see how the chili oil would have really rounded out the flavours, though it was wonderful even without that.

I'm soy sensitive, so we replaced the soy sauce with coconut amino acid and some of us added a bit of salt at the table (coconut amino acid is a great soy substitute, but it's not as salty as soy sauce). 

As this was more of a stir fry dish, we also added fresh green beans and mushrooms, and everyone agreed that we'll enjoy this dish again!

Thank you for sharing your recipe :)

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and didn't add on any cheese or mayo dressing to the finished product. I just had a dollop of ketchup on my plate to dip each bite into and wow, yummy! I just may try the cheese and/or mayo next time to see how I like it. I can't wait to make this again! The only thing I'd do differently is caramelize the onion first like SunnyByrd later mentioned. Some of my onions got a bit burnt by the time I finished frying everything but it was still so good! MMM...Thanks for sharing this recipe!
