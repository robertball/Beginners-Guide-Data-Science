I made Mini doughnuts for our small doggies and they LOVED them!  I made them with a shot glass for the large circle and a straw for the hole (and only cooked about 3 minutes).  Microwave warning though, watch the paper towel as they cook - I used the same one for the second batch, turned away for a few minutes and the paper towel was burning!

This recipe is dangerous. A cheap paper towel can't last 10 minutes in the micro and no paper towel on the planet could go in twice. My paper towel didn't catch on fire, but my cookies did after about 9 minutes. Even the non-burnt bits were hard as a rock. The only consolation is that my dog really wanted them. Too bad they were too hard for him to crunch them up.

You can't find anything easier than this recipe, however I didn't want to microwave these.  I actually made 2 different batches, one with whole wheat flour & chicken broth & the other with spelt flour & beef broth.

I  used 3-4 T of oats & probably & kneaded more flour in until stickiness gone.  Roll out to no more than 1/4" on floured surface (lots of flour!).  Then, I cut strips about 1/3" x 3" & twisted each end in opposite directions so it looks like a twisted skinny breadstick.  I also used a 4" round cutter, then with a pastry cutter devided each round into 6 pie shaped pieces.  Looks like little nacho chips!

I baked these at 300 for 30 minutes for the chips & 45 minutes for the twists.  Quinn, my lab-retriever mix loved them, but then again, she'll eat anything that isn't a rock.

I followed this recipe word for word. The cookies became black lumps of charcoal in the microwave. IT LITERALLY EXPLODED my microwave! DO NOT TRY THIS RECIPE

Good recipe....try cooking 3 or 4 minutes, let them set for a minute and see if they need further cooking.. I sometimes add a little peanut butter or local honey....just a tablespoons or so...i also just make little flat patties by hand rather than rolling out the dough.....these are easy and fun !
