I am the poster of this recipe and I wanted to put the other version in that we also love.  I use cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom, omit the green peppers and use an entire bag of shoestring french fries.  I serve with a side salad and/or steamed veggies for a complete meal. I vary between these two versions to keep it fresh with my family, since it's a quick weeknight dinner.

Satueed the onions, green peppers and a small can of sliced of mushrooms for a few mintues before adding the ground beef and a couple of cloves of minced garlic and continuing to cook until no longer pink. Also, mixed in some frozen corn and the Cheese Whiz and then let it simmer for about 10 mins. Followed the rest of the recipe. I was a little disappointed that the shoestring fries didn't get crunchy. My kids loved it...8 yr. old son with small appetite cleaned his plate and announced that he loved it...so that makes it a keeper! For some reason this kind of reminded me of Hamburger Helper, but that's okay I rely on it sometimes. Next time I might try shredded cheddar cheese like some reviews suggested. I may also try a different type of potato. Thanks for a recipe that we all enjoyed!

This has become my 15 yr old sons favorite with a few minor changes! He LOVES Mexican dishes of all sorts and loves to cook himself!   So this was an easy one for him to do on his own! His changes: add 1/4 cup sour creame to meat mixture. also add 1 can of black olives (torn to bits) into the meat mixture with the creame of mushroom soup. Then mix with cheese cover with fries and add another cup of shedded chedder on top at the last 5 min for a lil extra kick!

I changed a few things. Omitted the green pepper, added a cup of celery and one can of french style green beans, used shreaded hash browns instead of f-frys. I think corn would go well in here, i'll add that next time

Overall, this recipe was very good.  In fact it was better the next day as left- overs.  I wasn't sure if the fries would be soggy the next day, and they were soft.  But as it turned out, the softer texture was better and the flavors all melded together.  I may try this next time with shredded potatoes (the hashed brown type in the refridgerated section).

I did change the recipe slightly because I didn't have cheese sauce or shoestring fry's on hand. I replaced fry's with sweet potato waffle fryes and added a can of carrots for color & an added veggie. Great starter recipe, my husband and 3 year old ate it up!

Followed recipe to a "T" the first time and didn't care for the flavor of the cheez whiz.  Substituted shredded cheese the second time and it went over much better.  Quick and easy recipe that fills the kids up and gets me out of the kitchen fast after a long day at work.

My family teases me when I try a new recipe because I always ask if its a keeper or not.  Well this one is a keeper!!  The only thing different I did was use 2 lbs of hamburger only because that is how our beef is packaged.  Everything else I left the same.  I always love finding good casseroles!!

FANTASTIC CASSEROLE!!! MADE A COUPLE OF CHANGES TO SUIT FAMILIES TASTE. INSTEAD OF GREEN PEPPER I USED A CAN OF WHOLE KERNEL CORN. REPLACED THE CREAM OF MUSHROOM SOUP WITH CREAM OF CHICKEN, I FOLLOW THE REST AS POSTED. THE FLAVOR IS OUTSTANDING. MY SON WHO IS VERY PICKY AND DOESN'T EAT ALOT LOVED IT AND HAD SECONDS. HE HAS ALREADY ASK ME TO MAKE IT AGAIN. THANKS MICKE FOR THE RECIPE!!!

Very easy and customizable. I used country sage sausage instead of the ground beef, cooked with some frozen onions, omitted the green pepper, and used cream of chicken soup. Since I didn't have any Cheez Whiz, I just added a cup and a half or so of sharp cheddar and some half-and-half to the sausage mixture. Shoestring fries went on top. Cooked for 15 minutes or so, then returned to the oven topped with the remaining cheddar.   My husband loved it, said it just tastes like creamy sausage cheese fries. Will make again.

Great easy recipe!  Added some bacon, and had to use queso cheese because thats what I had on hand.  Left out the green peppers so my son would eat it.  Kinda made it a mildly spicy bacon-cheeseburger w/ french fry casserole. Yum.

I reheated leftovers in the oven so the fries wouldn’t be soggy and enjoyed it better the second day. The fries were crunchy the second time around so I would probably split the recipe and cook longer each time

I found nothing special here.  I had no cheese whiz so I used a combination of shredded cheddar and shredded mozzarella.  I thought it was too bland.  It needs something to spice it up a little.

This recipe caught my eye because I had s bag of frozen fries in the freezer forever and I really wanted to do something with it.  I replaced the cheese whiz with shredded cheddar (cheese whiz is one molecule away from plastic) and followed the recipe .   I did end up having to bake for almost an hour to get my fries so

Used small tater tots and turkey burger. Added a squirt of ketchup and a dollop of yellow mustard to the meat mixture. It was great.

I made it with Velveeta instead of the Cheez Whiz and used shredded potatoes instead of the french fries.  I enjoyed it, my hubby enjoyed it and my picky kids ate it; that makes it rate pretty high in my book.
