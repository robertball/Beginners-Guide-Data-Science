My husband and I LOVED this rice!  My grocery store didn't carry the 'Dutch Apple' yogurt, so I used 'Apple Pie' yogurt instead.  I'm not a big raisin fan, and I was going to leave them out, but decided they would add a little substance.  They blended in with the rice texture, and I didn't really taste them!  I used leftover rice that was already in the fridge, and just added the ingredients, and didn't need to use the apple juice.  I also thought this tasted a lot better heated in the microwave (since my rice was already cold).  Very good recipe, I will certainly use again!

Very good!!  Left out the raisins because my kids dont like them in foods.  I always loved rice with milk, butter, sugar and cinnamon, so this was good.

This was okay. It's my fault though, as I don't like raisins, didn't have chopped nuts or apple juice, so it was just the yogurt and rice and cinnamon. I couldn't find the apple nonfat yogurt either, so it was just plain vanilla. I'd try this again with the flavored yogurt, and figured out what I could use in place of raisins. Thanks.
