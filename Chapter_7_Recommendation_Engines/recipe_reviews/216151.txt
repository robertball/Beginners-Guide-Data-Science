Mom made something like this for us kids, only hers was like a Slop Pot Pie. She would make the recipe like this one, only she'd use hot dogs if she couldn't afford kielbasa and mix up a box of Jiffy Mix cornbread and pour it over the top and bake it like that. We ate it up. It was filling and really cheap to make. To this day, I still think of it as true comfort food. And I'll tell you, my husband and kids love it just as much as I did back then. NOTE: If you can, saute the onion in with a mess of garlic and the hot dogs, then add it to the "slop" ingredients. The crispy hot dogs really make a difference.

We added more chili (just a personal preference), omitted red pepper and ate it over rice since the kids don't like cornbread.  Very good!

Loved the quickness of making this and made lots which was great because the leftovers were even better. I made it with hotdogs to keep the price of this dish down

You may want to consider changing the name.  I don't have a weak stomach, but it gives me visions of the "real" deal that make me feel icky.  I'm sure other people will probably love your recipe though-good luck!

I did a search for recipes using ingredients I needed to use to clean out my fridge and cupboards. This one came up and aside from the name, sounded pretty good
 .
I baked it at 350 for 30 minutes as directed, but it was still cold in the center. I ended up baking it at 350 for 90 (yes, an hour and a half) before it was finally hot in the middle. 
It tasted pretty good. I used brown sugar baked beans, so the taste was interesting. I think next time I'll use a savory flavored baked bean instead. Might even throw some jalapenos in there, too.
Bottom line, it's pretty good. Just make sure to season this dish to your liking and plan on baking it for much longer than 30 minutes.

Have to be honest, did not care for this recipe at all. It was super easy, but just didn't taste that good. Maybe it was something I did wrong?

Even though the name sounds gross it's actually tasty! I only used one can of chili beans and didn't drain them since i wasn't using the baked beans. I swapped a green pepper for the red pepper and left the corn out and left the cheese of the top of mine! Really good cheap and easy to make!!
