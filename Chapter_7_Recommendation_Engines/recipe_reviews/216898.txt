This recipe was so easy - you had to wonder how good it was going to turn out. However!  They turned out great!
My husb normally fixes the enchilada meals and even he was surprised at how good these were and how quickly you can prepare them!  We have already fixed them x3.  Try it - you will love it!

holy  these are good! So easy I almost thought I was doing it wrong. I did saute the onions before putting them in(only cause raw onions are hard on my stomach) Husband loved them. They are Gluten free which is a plus in this house! Mix and match chili for different flavor. Add more filling don't that is what makes this recipe awesome. Having made a few times now we have even added spinach, different cheeses and black olives. I like them when they are at the simplest! These can be made layered and not rolled. I am telling you it is versatile and awesome!!!! Thank you for the awesome recipe!

This is my recipe, and I'm thrilled that people seem to be enjoying it so much.  Like I said in the description, these are definitely not low-fat, but they are pretty good every once in a while.  If your family is into freezer cooking, these are a great candidate. I prepare them through the rolled stage, then freeze them in their baking pan lined with foil.  After they freeze completely (overnight), I remove them from the baking pan, cover the foil wrapped enchiladas and wrap in plastic.  To cook, remove from freezer, pop enchiladas in foil back into baking pan, cover with sauce mixture, then bake an extra 15 minutes.  So easy and SOOOOO good, plus it doesn't take much extra time to make two or three pans than just one.

Loved the idea of lightly frying the corn tortillas before assembling enchilada. My dad can't have gluten so this was a great meal choice for him and he loved it! I made a few swaps to help lower the cals... I used vegetarian chili (fat free) and cheddar cheese made with 2% milk. I also cooked chicken in crock pot with salsa and shredded for inside the enchildada. Lastly, I only use half of the cheese. I put a little bit inside the enchilada and then the rest layered on top. Can't be all scientific about it,  but def lowered the fat/cal intake!

Loved these enchiladas! I followed the recipe exactly, the only thing i will do differently next time is saute the onions first before putting them in the tortillas. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!

Deliciousness to the max!  Thank you so much for sharing.  What a wonderful site this is - isn't it?  How else could we all get fabulous recipes like this one otherwise?!?!?  Anyway, while I know enchiladas call for corn tortillas, I substituted flour as that is my family's preference.  In addition, I slow-cooked boneless chicken breasts all day in some salsa and used that, shredded, in the enchiladas.  Other than that, I followed it and loved it.  Thank you for taking the time to share this gem!

So simple and quick! I used "medium" enchilada sauce, hormel turkey chili w/o beans, saut√©ed the onions prior to adding to the tortillas, and steamed the tortillas in the microwave.

These are out of this world!  No, they're not lowfat, but once in a while, this Texan craves good enchiladas, and these fit the bill nicely.  I'd say they rival any authentic Tex-Mex restaurant's enchiladas.  The only things I do differently are leave out the onions and steam the tortillas in the microwave instead of fry them (hey, every little bit helps, right?).  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I decided to try this recipe because I needed a QUICK and EASY enchilada recipe... I'm very glad I did.  I'll admit I was skeptical because my usual enchilada recipes are a bit more time and ingredient comsuming but well worth the effort.  I made just two changes... First, I used Hormel Turkey Chili with Beans (because that is what I had).  Second, I wrapped the tortillas in a damp paper towel and microwaved them until pliable.  Because I softened the tortillas that way, I added the chili powder into the sauce mixture.  Not a lot of work for an enjoyable dish!!

Easy and tasty too. This was simple to put together and it made plenty for us. I used onion powder instead of fresh onion and a blend of Mexican cheese. I cooked all the tortillas first and stacked them up then blotted the excess oil off with paper and assembled them. The oil got a bit too hot though near the last of the tortillas and the chili powder on the last couple was burned. My error. I cut this in half and got 10 enchiladas from this. Maybe I make mine small? Not quite as good with the canned chili as my homemade chili gravy but good for a quick meal without much effort. Thanks!

I was shown how to make Tex Mex enchiladas by a woman from San Antonio of Mexican heritage - about 30 years ago.

The only difference was in the directions.  My mentor dipped the tortillas in the heated chili sauce to soften.  Sometimes I use my own chili (if I have any leftovers).

Really easy.  We made it ahead of time for a quick dinner later in the week.  My kids don't like corn tortillas so we used flour and it still turned out well.

Okay, my first remark is that I changed one thing.  I used flour tortillas instead of corn & didn't fry them first in the oil & chili powder.  My kids will only eat flour tortillas.  But, having said that, this recipe is YUMMY!!  I wish I wasn't on a diet.  My son had two helpings & would've had more, if there was any left.  This will be a favorite around here.

We moved from Texas to Florida and I have been craving authentic tex-mex enchiladas. I followed the recipe exactly and they are so good!  I made some home made pico and re fried beans to go with them, YUMMMY!  Thank you for letting me go back to Texas, well, at least for this meal!

I had execution problems with this. My tortillas fell apart after being softened in the hot oil, so rolling them just didn't work. I wound up making this "lasagna style", with a layer of sauce, layer of softened tortillas, and then a cheese and onion layer. The taste was out of this world good. I'll probably try to make these again as written with a different brand of tortilla, because YUM.

Incredibly easy recipe. I added diced green chilies and jalapenos to the sauce recipe for extra kick and also used green enchilada sauce instead of red because that's what I could find at the grocery store. I also modified by adding some of the mixture in the tortillas to cut down on some of the cheese. It was a hit! Super delicious and so easy. Definitely adding this to my list of rotating items I make.

These were tasty, but I found it to be a big mess, so I ended up making an enchilada casserole by layering everything instead, much easier. I didn't find the need to heat the chili first either and I just added the onions to the chili mixture to save a step later. Trying to heat the tortillas first was just too hot and greasy to work with. Sorry.

My husband doesn't normally like enchiladas, and I'm not a huge fan of the normal enchilada sauce...this was really different and good! I made the following changes: 
We don't like corn tortillas, so I used uncooked flour tortillas from Costco, and browned them in the skillet before filling. Left out the onions, added seasoned black beans and jack cheese to the inside of the enchiladas. Left the sauce the same, put a layer under the enchiladas and a layer on the top.
Amazing!

Easy and quick to make and there were no leftovers.  The entire family loved them.
