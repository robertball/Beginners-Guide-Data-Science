My two year old and 9 1/2 month old loved them.  My husband and I thought they were OK but definitely like yeast cinnamon rolls better.  They're OK in a pinch and kids definitely like them.

This is a quick Cinnamon Bun recipe.  No, they are not as good as ones made completely from scratch with yeast, but they are much faster when you don't have time.  I didn't really change anything, just added some nuts to the rolls.  I will probably make again when I don't have time to make then from scratch.

These are really good, maybe not quite as good as yeast cinnamon rolls but they are alot quicker when the craving hits for hot cinnamon rolls.

this is good for a quick roll- will make changes to suit my taste, i.e. more sugar (brown) in mix, some nutmeg etc. but not a bad recipe! Good for making dinner rolls w/butter and parmesan cheese mixed in (deleting the sugars and adding some spices like oregano and garlic)

These were interesting. The dough wasn't easy to cut and so the rolls lost their "roll" look a little, but it's how they taste not how they look. After fifteen minutes I took them out and they were way too mushy, so I cut between them and put them back in for a little while longer, and they were fine. Just make SURE you use confectioners sugar and not regular sugar because like me, you will have made a big mistake. ;)

These are really good - but it's true you should not make them expecting a yeast style cinnamon bun.  They are like a cinnamon biscuit.  I used a little less baking mix in the mixture and was generous with baking mix in the roll out.  I also used more cinnamon then called for and more sugar - I put a thick coat of it on top of the butter and then dusted the tops before baking.  Additionally, two minutes before I took the buns out of the oven I brushed them with butter.  The outer part of the roll was more biscuit like - but the centers were moist and delicious.

I also needed more milk for the icing - maybe an 1/8 of a cup or so.

I woke up my mother figure with this one morning. Normally she would throw a pillow at my face for doing so, but this time she pretty much worshiped the ground I walk on for giving her these!

These are no substitute for the yeast rolls.  They should really be called cinnamon bisquits.  They had the full flavor of bisquits, dry and bland.  I even added brown sugar and raisins to the filling and gave them a nice coating of Cream Cheese frosting from the clone of cinnabon recipe.  I can't say I'd make these again.  I wasn't at all thrilled with them.

I think that I'll try the yeast recipe of cinnamon buns.  They were good, but weren't GREAT.

these were definitely pretty good. they could have used a little sugar in the dough, but they're still good. i added raisins and shredded coconut to the inside and skipped on the icing.

They were pretty good, and so easy to make. But I will adjust the recipe for my family's taste. Add some extra sugar, and add cinnamon to the dough and glaze. Yum!

I had to add more baking mix to these to get the dough to the right consistency.  I'd add cinnamon & sugar to taste, the recipe doesn't call for nearly enough. One question though, how do you make the buns more moist and get them to be golden?
