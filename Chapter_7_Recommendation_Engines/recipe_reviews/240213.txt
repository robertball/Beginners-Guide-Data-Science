I made this salad for a small gathering I had at my home, and I cannot rave enough about it.  It was simply the best salad I ever made.  The flavors mesh very well, and you will not have to add salt as the olives already adds a "saltiness" to it.  I did decide to add 2 tsp of the Red Wine Vinegar instead of one and just a "smidgen" more of the olive oil.  It was absolutely scrumptious.  This will definitely be my next dish at the Church Pot Luck.

I knew my husband would love this salad (his usual way to eat a salad is with a huge squeeze of fresh lemon juice, and "maybe" a drizzle of olive oil) . . . I was right! His comment was "honey, this salad is a make again!" Kudos to the submitter!
