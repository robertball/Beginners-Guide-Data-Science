This was soooooooo easy and the cookies were great. I kept half the dough in the freezer for later use.

We were disappointed with these.  They were a little too bland for us, and the shortening taste was strong.

I made these with butter, because that's what I had on hand. I let them sit in the fridge for 2 hours before cutting them to bake. I cut them about 1/4" thick and they got very puffy. Didn't turn out like a cookie to me and not very sweet at all.
