I thought this recipe was great! Instead of drizzling the chips with oil then the spices, I mixed the oil and seasonings together in a small bowl then poured over the uncooked chips in another bowl and stirred until evenly coated before placing them on the baking sheet. Doing this eliminated any possibilities of spice clumping. I baked at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes or so checking every ten minutes to make sure no burning.

Followed the recipe to the T.  This recipe has too much spice (not that it tasted spicy, just not the right balance of flavors).  The time and temperature must be off a bit because my chips were burning at half time!  Maybe the stated time/temp would have been better for fries?

I just put everything in a gallon zip bag. These weren't in long enough so they weren't crisp.

The chips were too thin when I made them with the peeler.  They cooked in ten minutes.  But, I will make them again, just a little thicker.  They tasted great!

Very good. I made it without the cheese or garlic and it was delicious.

I love the concept of this, and LOVED the flavor, but the cooking time is off. I checked them @ 10 minutes, and some were already burned, and the ones that weren't burned were soggy. I am definitely gonna play around w/ these more, b/c the flavor is delicious. Maybe cutting them thin w/ a knife would be a better way to go??? Thanks for sharing. :)

I agree with the first commenter. It unfortunately has too much spice. I think that maybe SOME paprika, garlic powder and salt with butter would be better. The cheese, seasonings and olive oil created a blob and did not mix well on the chips.
