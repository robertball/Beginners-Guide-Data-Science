I served this at a casual dinner party without having tried it before (always a mistake) - it was terrible. I followed the instructions, making no alterations. The main problem is that when you serve it to someone, they expect it to have a mint flavor and the texture of ice cream, but instead tastes of pistacio and has the texture and density of frozen cool whip.  You may be saying, "Duh, that's what the instructions say - you should've expected it." But my guests hadn't read the recipe, so they made gentle comments like, "Oh...is that, um, well it's not mint.. what is it?"  "Oh, pistacio?  Pistacio and oreo?  Huh." Finally, we all laughed.

Not as good as I thought it would be. I'd prefer mint chocolate ice cream as the filler instead.

I made this recipe last week.  My boyfriend and I loved it.  I used the regular oreos instead of mint.  It was delicious.

Very nice. I'm not very fond of Cool Whip, so I used whipped cream in my version. It turned out light, fluffy and delicious. This recipe is a keeper.

Super easy to make. I made it exactly as written, right down to the number of cookies to use. Has a nice mild mint flavor, not strong which is nice. I used chocolate chips melted to drizzle on top and that really is the touch that puts it over the top taste wise!

I loved this pie!  I am all for easy desserts, and this one is super simple.  Now, I did change it a touch, but only in terms of the flavor of pudding I utilized for this sweet venture while increasing the cookie ratio as well.  Hubby and I wanted a more pronounced mint flavor than what we believed would happen if we stuck with the original recipe, so I used Chocolate Mint Chip.  Also, I did not melt chocolate to drizzle on top.  The cookies we purchased were not the double stuffed, so just in case that made a big difference, I doubled the cookies.  After tasting it, I'm sure I could cut that down and create a solid mint flavor, but I thought I should mention this change as well.  This recipe is a keeper!

Really tasty! I made my own graham crust (1-1/4 cups graham wafers + 3 TBS margarine, press into a greased pie plate, bake at 350 for 8 minutes, cool, fill) instead of a chocolate crust and I used 8 regular Double Stuf Oreos instead of 6 mint ones. We didn't miss the mint: It was great! Oh, I also used low-fat whipped topping with no problems. Super-tasty and quick. We ate half of it after lunch and will finish it after supper, I'm sure!
