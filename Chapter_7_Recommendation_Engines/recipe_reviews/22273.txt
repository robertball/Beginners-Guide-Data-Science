I made this last Christmas/New Years and thought it was good, but not great. This year, I tweaked it and it is excellent! I cubed 4 small-medium potatoes but only boiled them maybe 9 minutes and then mixed them with the ham, one 11-oz can of mexi-corn, and ½ pkg frozen chopped broccoli. For the sauce, I cooked 1/4 cup chopped onions and two stalks of celery (sliced) in the 1/4 cup butter. To that, I added 1/3 cup of flour, 2 cups of milk, a few good shakes of pepper, maybe ½ tsp of garlic powder and ½ tsp of cayenne. I also added around a cup or so of shredded cheddar to make it a nice tasty cheese sauce. I mixed the sauce with the other ingredients, poured into a greased 9x13 dish, and topped with another 1½ cups of cheddar. Awesome! Thanks again, Lindysue! I've found the way to prepare it for my family!

Much better if you use 1/4 cup chopped onion, 1/4 tsp minced garlic, and 1 Tsp Spicy Season All and saute with the parsley and 1/2 Tsp marjoram in the butter before adding the flour and milk. Also add 1/2 cup melted Velveetta cheese after you add the above said mixture to the ham, potatoes, and corn.  I tossed everything in the casserole dish 1/2 way through cooking then added 1 cup of shredded cheese to the top of the casserole. Turned out just wonderful!!  I used quite a bit more pepper than the recipe called for, but WOW what a dish! WHole family loved it!  Don't be fooled with the spicy season all.  It won't make the dish too spicy or salty.  Just great!

This was very good, but would have been better if I had cubed the potatoes and then sauteed them instead of boiling them, and left the skin on.  Be sure to use red or yellow potatoes for this, because baking potatoes don't have the right texture, which is important to this dish.  Also, try using a can of mexicorn for more color and flavor, and using pepperjack cheese instead of processed cheese.  Overall, a good recipe even as is.  Hubby asked for seconds (rare even with my good cooking skills).

Very flavorful Casserole! Best I made in a long time. I made this twice now, Once as written which was awesome. Second time I replaced potatos with egg noodles and subsituted peas in place of corn. Great taste either way. Thanks for a wonderful new family favorite!

This is very good. Especially if you like country gravy-type recipes. I like to use cheddar cheese. Cook all  in an iron skillet and then throw that in the oven. One dish recipe!

Good recipe!  I added garlic to the gravy and blended in some cheddar cheese before baking as well.  Used cheddar on top rather than processed cheese.  Will certainly make again.

This was a good recipe similar to one that I've made using canned cream of chicken soup.  I like this one MUCH better.  The only thing I did differently was add 1 teaspoon granulated chicken boullion and 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt to the sauce and instead of putting the cheese on top I just mixed it right in with the ham and potatoes.  Loved it!!

I made this delicious recipe using totally organic ingredients. Turned out incredible! We followed the advise of some of the posts and used Pepperjack cheese. My mom and I browned the ham and the potatoes before adding the sauce mixture. Then topped it off with graded Cheddar cheese. Very nice casserole.

I only used this recipe as a basic guideline.  After reading several reviews of how it turned out like soup I decided to not boil the potatoes.  I chopped a whole onion in the food processor and sautéed it olive oil until translucent.  I then added 4 potatoes that I scrubbed and left the skin on and cut into ¼” cubes to the pan with the onions and then added a bit of fresh crushed garlic.  I browned the potatoes on the stove and covered them, I did not want them to get too done as they were still going to be baked.  I then cut the ham into little pieces.  I had leftover spiral ham so that was easy enough.  Because I had about 4 cups of potatoes and 4 cups of ham I used 2 cups of milk and 16oz of Velveeta in the saucepan on the stove while the potatoes were cooking.  While the mike and “cheese” were melting I added Hungarian paprika, garlic powder, onion powder &  ground mustard to the “cheese” milk mixture.  Once this was done I took the potatoes off the heat and put into a huge bowl and added the ham and I decided to add a bit of real cheese so I diced a bit of real sharp cheddar into the bowl and tossed everything together with a spatula.  I then sprayed the 11”x7’’ pan and put in the mixture and then poured the “cheese” sauce on top and put into the oven.  Now this was still way soupy.  I used double the ingredients that the recipe called for and only 1/4th as much milk and it was still soupy so I let it bake uncover for an hour and for the last 15 mins I added bread crumb

With some modifications, my husband raved about it.  I increased the onion to one small onion and sauteed it in the butter along with two cloves of minced garlic.  I melted some pepperjack cheese into the "gravy" and added a bit of red pepper for some kick. I added a can of mexicorn and some chopped frozen broccoli to the potatoes and ham.  For the last 10 minutes of cooktime, I sprinkled cheddar cheese and french fried onions on top.  (I did not use any processed cheese food).  My husband said "you can DEFINITELY put this recipe on the make-again list!"

My family loved it.  I made changes according to other posters: fiesta corn; 1/3 c each of onions & celery sauteed in butter; a bag of frozen broccoli; 1/2 tsp of chili powder & 1/4 tsp of garlic powder & all cheddar cheese instead of velveeta.  Everyone had seconds & my 10 yr old saved a serving for her breakfast tomorrow!

I made this on boxing day with leftover Christmas ham and we all thought it was delicious!  I sauteed 1/2 cup chopped onion in butter and then made the cream sauce with added white cheddar cheese.  In the last 10 minutes in the oven I topped with fried onion topping.  I think you could also use potato chip topping.  I will definately make again.

This was an awesome way to get rid of some leftovers in the fridge.  I used some leftover ham, cubed potatoes, carrots, celery.  I did one small onion instead of what was suggested and did about 2tbls of fresh oregano, 2tbls of basil, 2tbls marjoram, and 2tbls parsley and I sauted that in with the onion, garlic and celery in the butter.  Very tasty and flavorfull.

Really good recipe and the best kind quick & easy.  I tweaked it a little--did not have a can of whole kernal corn so I used a frozen mixture of corn, red bell peppers and broccoli. My husband and toddler went back for seconds, a rarity for my picky daughter. This one is a keeper.

I made this for my daughter's family night.  I doubled the recipe.  Instead of milk I used evaporated milk & broth and I used cheddar and Jack cheese instead of the processed cheese.  I used red potatoes, cooked and then sliced.  It was a huge hit with her husband and 6 kids.  Good Stuff!  Thank you.

I made this using my leftover Easter ham and it turned out pretty good. Must season though with spices of your choice because if not, then it will be pretty bland.

I added a can of Rotel tomatoes and green chiles to the "adult's half" of the casserole and everyone was happy.  Great use for leftover ham.

Good blueprint...but needs much. Added celery and more onion plus garlic to saute. Added cheddar within casserole and pepper jack on top. Added some hot sauce and lots of fresh ground pepper. Used red potatoes. And when making a rue, I always shake the flour and milk in a jar before adding slowly. I swear by this method. Overall, great comfort food.

I had to give just 4 stars because I did adjust it a bit. I actually cooked 1/2 large onion in the butter until they were caramelized... mmmm... And I used 1/4 tsp of white pepper and left out the parsley. I could really see how you could add some frozen vegetables to this. Overall very good!

I could tell just by reading the recipe that it would not be savory enough for our tastes. I used it as a basis, made some additions, and it turned out wonderfully! First, I took the advice of some of the other posters and only boiled the potatoes for a few minutes. Next, to the butter I added a half of a chopped yellow onion. When it was time to add the flour and make the roux, I added 1 teaspoon of smoked paprika, 1 teaspoon of dried mustard, and some celery seed. I only added 1 cup of milk as a mixed the roux into a cream sauce, but threw in several different types of shredded cheese that we had in the house (1/4c. Parmesan, 1/4c. smoked Gouda, and about a cup of mild cheddar). I made the rest of the recipe according to plan, omitting the "cheese product" and opting for fresh shredded cheese, and it was amazing! The smoked paprika really complimented the rich cheeses and ham.

i really wish there was a was to indicate that a review is massively UN-helpful. i can't for the life of me figure out how the "most helpful critical review" (who basically created her own recipe) ended up with a soupy casserole. the proportions for the sauce as written yield a nice, thick bechamel; in fact, after adding some grated cheddar to the sauce, i had to add more milk and it was still very thick. that being said, the idea of using corn in this was not appealing to me, so i used two boxes of frozen spinach, squeezed dry and chopped (it was roughly equal in volume to the can of corn). i also put some garlic bread crumbs on top, along with the grated cheddar, for a nice crunchy texture. this was very good, and i look forward to having lunch leftovers!

I increased onion to about 1/2 cup, 2 cloves of garlic and instead of canned corn, used frozen extra sweet (about 2 cups)   Hubby and I LOVED this!   It was sooooo good.   I will make this again and again!

Very good. I don't like onions so I added 1 tsp. onion powder instead of 1 Tbsp. onions. Also, I did not have parsley, so I just left it out. My boyfriend was scraping the bowl at the end of our meal!

Five stars for comfort food. Its creamy and cheesy and not good for you! But it does taste suprisingly good. And I will make it again. There were no leftovers. I don't usually like this sort of thing, mixing food that doesn't seem to go together (corn, ham, cheese, potatoes) but everything meshed well. My advice is give it a try.

Its not often that I rate a ham casserole so highly but then again - I have not tasted a ham casserole as good as this one! YUMMMMMYYY!!!! I used more potatoes so I increased the milk to 2c and increased the onion.  Also, I added some diced pimentos for some color.  Great GREAT recipe LindySue! A keeper FOR SURE!!!!

Thanks Lindysue...
I made this dish for my sister and her family. It was a big hit. Next week my brother in law went out and got another ham, so we could have leftovers to make this dish :) 
This dish was tasty, filling and easy to make. It is a keeper...

Followed the advice of other reviewers.  Added broccoli to the casserole (this really added great flavor & color  - highly recommended). As recommended by another reviewer,  for the sauce I chopped up one small onion & also added 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp cayenne, & 1 cup of mexican cheese blend.  Use the rest of the bag of cheese over the top of the casserole.  This was delicious!!!  What a great way to use up all of that left over ham.  I also skipped the parsley because I didn't have any.

My family of 6 ate this up.  I'd definately make it again, but would add more seasoning to it for flavor.  Be sure to get the flour/milk mixture thick in the pan, cause it doesn't thinken up in the oven.

Great way to use leftover ham.  I followed other reviewers advise but instead of extra onions I used shallots they added a nice flavor.

Good base recipe.  The beauty of this recipe is that you can use really almost any combination of things in your fridge/freezer and it will turn out.  I made it using frozen hash brown potatoes, cubed ham, frozen peas, canned corn, with bread crumbs and potato chip crumbs on top to give it a crunch.  It was a yummy casserole.  I also made it in a 9x13 pan.  Good one.

This was a pretty good recipe. After reading the previous reviews, I added minced garlic, paprika, and a dash of cayenne pepper to the sauce to give it a bit more flavor. I also use Cheddar cheese instead of the processed cheese, and a bit more than 4 oz. I also added a diced red pepper, and increased the chopped onion to 1/2 onion. Turned out well, and it was a great way to use leftover ham.

I really wanted to like this recipe because I LOVE casseroles of all kinds but this one just didn't make the grade.  I would recommend mixing the cheese in with the sauce and be careful not to over cook the potatoes because they turn to mush when you try to mix in the other ingredients.  Also, I used Russet potatoes and the texture was totally wrong.  Maybe the creamier red potatoes would have been a better choice.

A great way to use left over ham and I might actually buy a ham just to make this recipe.  As other reviewers have suggested, I melted the "Velveeta Light" into the sauce instead of layering on top of the casserole and I liked the results.  Canned, sliced potatoes work great and cut down the prep time.  Also, in the sauce I used fat free, condensed milk as well as a lot more onion (I used about 1/4 to 1/2 a cup), a touch of paprika, a few cloves of garlic, a 1/2 TBS of majoram, and topped the casserole off with Italian style bread crumbs (because I had some to use up but I'd do it again next time).

This was really good!  I doubled it and it fit in a 13 x 9" baking dish.  I used grated cheddar on top.  It was flavourful enough to be tasty yet it was plain enough that I had no problems getting my young kids to eat it.  It is great as leftovers as well (and  I don't normally like leftovers).  I will definitely make this again.  If I could, I'd probably give it 4 1/2 stars.

This was easy and good.  I added three slices of American cheese after taking the flour mixture off the stove.  I didn't have any shredded.  And I also added 1 cup of Ragu Cheese Creations Sauce after I put the flour mixture over the ham and potatoes.  Instead of using onions, because my children don't like them, I used onion powder with the flour, it worked great.  It was yummy.

This was a big hit, my family scraped the pan clean.  I did use some of the suggestions from a few reviews and added some extra ingredients like celery with the onions before sautéing and added shredded cheese, garlic, cayenne and some season salt to the milk mixture for a delicious cheesy sauce.  I also added another cup of cheese to the top before baking.  My husband said that I need to make this one again really soon.

I made this recipe tonight, and it was a hit. My picky eater even cleaned her plate. I did make a few changes: first I had to double the recipe for 4 adults and one child, with the exception of the parsley (1/4 C was sufficient for my taste). I made is with equal parts smoked sausage and ham steak cubed, I used red skinned potatoes and left the skins on, added 1/4t garlic powder, sauteed the parsley in the butter with the onion (thank you fellow user for the suggestion :)), and I used a full 4 cups of shredded cheddar and jack cheese, as well as I only had frozen corn so I used 2 cups. Because I doubled the recipe I had to add 15 minutes to the baking time. Overall though we found it hearty, and delicious - Thank you!

This was excellent! Especially with the added suggestions of several viewers to spice it up to your taste. I made the recipe as is, but added a can of drained, chopped green chiles, and i substituted cheddar and Pepper Jack cheese, even adding some to the sauce, as was recommended (YUM!). For spices, I added All Season Salt, mustard powder, pepper, and paprika. All of these gave it the "kick" this kind of dish needs to satisfy the appetites in my family. Love it!

The kids LOVED this and rated it 5 stars. My husband and I found it a bit bland and rated it 4 stars. The taste didn't justify how unhealthy it is. I topped with cheddar rather than american cheese. Perhaps different veggies would be better.

A deelish recipe.  I made sure to cube the potatoes VERY small. I fried up the onion in a pan, then added the ham and potatoes and browned them for about 15 minutes. I added 1 cup of grated smoked gouda for the sauce. And finally, I added in a cup of baby peas for color.

DIVINE!!  I used frozen shredded hashbrowns, frozen corn, more onion (maybe 1/3 cup), and added red & yellow pepper.  Oh, I also used medium cheddar cheese (processed cheese = yuck!!)  Whole family LOVED it, which rarely happens in our house.  This would be great for a brunch casserole with some cinnamon rolls or banana bread!!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is really good...as a soup lol. My casserole never thickened up, even after being in the oven almost a hour. Thankfully it's a very tasty soup with crushed saltines over the top. I added in chopped celery, salt and more cheese, as well as left out the parsley. (I didn't have any) Will make this again for my family, but as a Ham Potato Chowder and not as a casserole dish =)

This was very good, and was similar to the ham and potato soup recipe, just thicker.  Family enjoyed it, and said it tasted like a "filling" for pot pie.  You can add milk to left overs and serve it as a soup the next day for something different.

First time making this so I pretty much followed the recipe except for using a little more onion and adding half the cheese to the sauce mixture.  My family absolutely loved this...my 3 yr. old granddaughter who is a picky eater even asked for more!  I even doubled the recipe and was looking forward to having some for lunch the next day, but there were no leftovers!

I pan fried the potatoes with the onions instead of boiling on the stove top. I mixed the milk together with the flour in a tupperware shaker/mixer container then added to the potato/onion mixture. In the casserole dish I placed the rest of the ingredients.I used the mexicorn mixture to give it color. I used velveta cheese in the casserole and hot pepperjack (4oz)on top. It was not spicy and Grandma/ 2 kids / Husband all loved it!

I made this for supper tonight and the end result was comfort food at its best. I made some changes, but primarily to the sauce. I added a grating of fresh nutmeg, a large clove of garlic (sweated with the onions), 1 tsp of dry mustard powder and about 1 cup of grated cheese (1/2 swiss and 1/2 cheddar). The only other change I made was to put a coating of butter crackers, butter and cheese on the casserole. I baked the dish for 25 minutes and let stand for nearly 10 minutes before eating. We really enjoyed this; it would be perfect using leftover ham.

I picked this recipe because I had the ingredients, otherwise I may not have tried it.  It isn't fancy, but it was better than I expected!  It is a good recipe to use up leftover ham.  It would be great for brunch.  I plan to make this one again.  Minor adjustments:  
added minced garlic.  & doubled the cheese.

I ended up adding extra and chunking up the cheese and throwing it in and topping with french fried onions...very, very good!

This is far superior to most casseroles! As suggested, I added garlic and onion powders, as well as some seasoning salt. Also skipped the potato step, and used two drained cans of sliced potatoes instead. I used one full bag of 4-cheese Mexican mix, with half stirred into the dish and half on top. Mixed in one egg, and might use two next time. This would even work as a breakfast casserole. Delicious... thank you!

I was really worried about making this recipe because my family (there are 6 of six of us) doesn't care for casseroles. It's rare to find something that everyone likes, but this recipe was a HUGE hit. Everyone asked me to double this next time. I did add a few more potatoes, a little less onion and I used cheddar cheese. Yummy!

This was so easy and the family loved it.  I cheated and used canned, sliced potatoes so it was even easier.  Ready in no time and gone in no time!

I decided to follow the suggestions of some of the other reviewers and try shredded hash browns instead of cubed potatoes.  It was really yummy!!  There were no leftovers to stuff in the fridge.  Give it a try; you won't be disappointed.

I used hashbrown potatoes to make the dish even quicker. There is no need to cook the potatoes before you assemble the mixture. The whole family enjoyed it.

Just wanted to say I turn to recipes to find something when I didn't have a plan ! I had left over ham from ham and potatoes and ham and bean soup , this recipe is perfect ! Just the way it is ! I loved it , very tasty , very filling ! I find it rude to use someone's recipe and then bash it or add things that don't need added , if you created a new one then post it , but don't be rude saying this is good but not great , that's your opinion ! I thought it was great as it is !

1/4/2015: Good, easy recipe.  I left the skins on the potatoes, cubed them, then spread them on a platter and microwaved them for about 5 minutes (until just done) instead of boiling them.  I substituted cornstarch for the flour to make this gluten-free, and I used 2oz of kraft singles (american) cheese and 2 oz of grated cheddar cheese.  Otherwise I followed the recipe, and we all thought it was very good.   3/28/18 update:  turned this into a hearty soup this time:  I Reduced the milk to 1/4cup, omitted the flour, added a can of great northern beans and 1/4 cup of canned jalapeños, combined all of the ingredients in a large casserole without pre cooking anything, microwaved 6 minutes then baked at 400 degrees F for 30 minutes, uncovering for the last 5. It was very good! I added a handful of chopped cilantro to my serving for some extra yumminess!

I made this last night for a couple of picky people and they loved it!!  I am so glad I found this, I will make it again.  The only changes I made are, I added half a red bell pepper to onion mixture and half a can of green chilies, which make everything better.  I also added some of the cheese to the bechamel mixture so it would make a more smooth consistency and added the rest to the top a few minutes before it was done.  The only suggestion one person said would make it better was to add bacon to the top.  Sounds good to me.

I had to substitute cheddar cheese for processed because we didn't have any.  I think the casserole didn't come out as pretty but it sure tasted good.  I thought it was okay but my husband and kids came back for seconds and thirds.  My 6 year old raved it about the next day too.  So 5 stars for sure and a great use of leftover ham from Easter or any other dinner.

I really didn't like this too much.  I must admit that what I turned out definitely looked different than the photos.  I think the potatoes I used were the wrong type (Russet, which is what I had) and on top of that they got overcooked. I got a gluey, starchy, gravy-like consistency.  The corn literally saved the meal, adding a bit of crunch.  I won't make again.

My family really liked this recipe! The only thing I will do differently next time is stir some cheese into the casserole before baking as well as the layer that is added to the top.

I googled "what to make with left over ham" and came upon this recipe!  It won me over because I had all the listed ingrediants on hand!
My husband can't stand the term "casserole"...so I was hesitant with him - BUT it was a big hit!  and my 11 year old son, ate probably 3 helpings of it!  I've saved this one!  next time, it won't be for the left over ham, but for the ham originally!

:) Thank you for sharing this great recipe! I didn't have the kind of cheese called for, so I used shredded 5-cheese blend and it turned out very good! I also had those fried onion rings that you use in greenbean casseroles on hand, so I baked those on top for the last 10 mins.

This was just "OK" for me.  I followed the recipe to the letter and found the flavors to be quite bland.  The next time I have some leftover ham to work with, I will likely seek out a different recipe.  This one really didn't do anything for me.

Thank you so much for this recipe! I just made it and it was absolutely delicious! There were only a few changes that I made to suit my taste including adding 1 more cup of potatoes (or four medium sized potatoes) in addtion to adding 4 oz of Velveeta to the white sauce mixture and melting it into the sauce. I like cheesy foods so I still added the 4 oz cheese toward the end of baking. We really enjoyed the bake! Very simple and tasty :)

This was awesome, definitely a keeper!  The only thing I did different was leave out the parsley (cause I never use it), added a bit of fresh garlic since we're garlic lovers, and used cheddar instead of the processed cheese because that's what I had. YUM!!

Made this last night for dinner with only a few changes. I used frozen hash browns that were thawed, dried parsley,some green pepper and about 1/3 cup of onions. It has a nice creamy texture and DH really enjoyed it. Served with a green salad and it makes a great meal with leftover ham.

Not bad, I would give a 3.5 if they had that. I think a few modifications for our family and it will be 4 star. Seemed a little bland but they ate it!! I think a different kind of cheese would be better for our taste.

Excellent recipe!! My picky 3 year old said "Mommy what's this called??" And then he asked that I make it for him again :D What more can a mother ask for!! Thank you so much for the delicious recipe, I didn't alter it a bit and I will most definitely make it again.

OK, I made this last night for supper.  Liked the idea of pre-cooking the potatoes to speed up the process.  Didn't like (at all) the parsley.  The corn flavor was lost.  Next time I'll just made scalloped potatoes and add ham, topped with yellow cheddar.

This was great with a few modifications.  I used a full can of corn (we like corn at my house), frozen shopped green pepper (since I didn't have any fresh), 1/4 cup chopped onion, about 5 red potatoes, a few dashes of cayenne pepper, garlic salt, a can of fire roasted green chillies, 1 cup mexican style cheese, 1/3 cup flour, 1 1/3 cup milk.  Then when almost done cooking through, I added some cheddar to the top.  I think the green chillies really set it off.  Not spicy at all but just enough flavor!!!  Very good.  Even my "glass half empt"y hubby (lol) said it was good.

Very good.  Next time I am going to have to use Cheddar cheese.  My toddler girls (ages 2 & 4) liked it too!

I hate to say it, but I wouldn't waste your time or ingredients on this recipe. It did look a touch bland, but based on the other reviews I gave it a try. The only change I made was to add some garlic in with the sauteed onions. Other than that I cooked exactly as-is. It was a bland soup-y mess with an overpowering flavor of corn. We had a lot of wasted food last night.

After reading the reviews, I took great liberties with this recipe.  I did not boil the potatoes, just cubed them into small pieces, threw in some garlic, black pepper,and some cayenne pepper and browned with the onion and some sliced celery.  Then added 1/3 c flour, 2 cups of milk, thickened it up, threw in some cheddar cheese, the ham, corn, and some leftover peas I had.  Put that in a 9 x 13 pan, and baked it at 350 for 40 minutes.  Put some more cheese on top to melt, and sprinkled the top with some hot Hungarian paprika.  The result?  A very filling, slightly kicky, easy dinner!  The original recipe is a great starting point!

We loved this casserole. I did customize the recipe. I used peas instead of corn. I used about 1 cup of onions instead of 1 tablespoon. I panfried the cubed potatoes with herbs de provence, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and lots of pepper. I only had a ham steak on hand. So I took the ham and removed as much fat as I could, then I cubed it. We were lucky, this particular hamsteak was not too salty. Next time, I will try to follow the recipe with the correct ingredients, but this time was great and lots of leftovers to freeze.

I pretty much followed the directions except I did indeed saute cubed red potatoes and switch up the seasoning.  I added just your basic dash of nutmeg to the sauce along with a bit of cayenne and garlic powder.  I also threw in some extra cheese b/c that's just the way I like it. Since the potatoes were already fully cooked after sauteing I only baked it for 15 minutes to get it all melty and delicious.

This needs something more, it's a bit bland.  I added marjoram like others suggested, and probably should have added some garlic.  Frozen cubed potatoes would have made this easier.

Excellent as is, but (per others suggestions) added more onions, a little season salt and marjoram, as well as more valvetta. These changes gave it the "extra something" it was needing! Great casserole to use up left over ham!

I also increased the amount of onion and added zucchini and cheddar cheese.  And a smidge of salt.  YUM.  Husband gave it two thumbs up.

I started this recipe with my leftover Easter ham and store bought prepared (cubed -for breakfast) O'Brien potatoes.  I used sharp cheddar cheese and added about a 1/2 cup to the sauce while heating so the cheese was melted and evenly distributed.  I forgot to add the parsley but I can't imagine it made that big of a difference.  Topped the dish with maybe a 1/4 cup of shredded cheddar and voila, a quick and easy casserole that came together in minutes. Yum. I opted to stick with the plain canned corn instead of the Mexican blend others suggested because the potato mix already contained chopped bell peppers and a little onion. This will be added to my recipe box.  It's a simple dish that's easy to prepare and satisfied the entire family.

This didn't look very good, actually, but it was incredibly yummy.  The family raved and raved about it.  The same basic recipe could easily be used as the basis for a chicken pot pie...just use chicken and peas instead of ham and corn and put in a pastry shell.  Quick, easy, and very good.

This was a great recipe for using leftover ham and definitely had a comfort food feel!  I substituted frozen broccoli florets instead of corn, used about half an onion, and added garlic to the onion.  It was easy to throw together and made great leftovers!

I cut up potatoes and fried them. Then added chopped green onions. I cut up a ham steak and added frozen corn. I made the sauce in the same pan I fried the potatoes in and added 1 cup of cheddar cheese - when the cheese was melted in I poured that over the top and baked it.

Very, very yummy!!!  I used corn that I'd frozen this summer and basil because I didn't have fresh parsley.  I sub'd American cheese on top because we're not fans of processed.  I just layed the slices over the top to cover then sprinkled with breadcrumbs.  The sauce was way too thin when I pulled it from the oven but thickened nicely as it cooled a little.  I'd suggest letting the casserole rest about 10 min. before serving.  Very comforting, wholesome and just plain good!  A great way to use up ham!

This is really good with a couple small changes as suggested by other users. I upped the onions to about 1/3 cup...there is no way 1 tablespoon can contribute much flavor to a whole casserole. Also added 1 t season-all, along with 1/2 cup melted velveeta. I found it was sufficiently salty after this so I ommited the shredded cheese on top. The only thing I would change next time is perhaps less flour or more milk, because the gravy was pretty thick. Great way to use up leftover ham - it's some serious comfort food...cheesy, meaty, potato-y.

I was pleasantly surprised at how this came out. When I tasted the gravy prior to baking I was very uneasy because it seemed extremely bland. I omitted the onions, used whole wheat flour and reduced fat margarine and I did double the amount of pepper and add garlic powder to the gravy. I used a can of whole new potatoes, which I diced up and that saved about 15 minutes and tasted just fine. I added about a 1/3 of a cup of shredded cheddar and monterrey jack to the mixture, then topped with about a 1/2 cup and also a sprinkling of seasoned bread crumbs. Good, simple comfort food. Thanks!

This was a good recipe.  My husband enjoyed it enough to want to take the leftovers to work today.  I found it a little bland, so I think when I make it again I may experiment with some spices (dry mustard maybe?)

This was gone within 15 minutes of pulling it out of the oven! I used cheddar cheese and mixed it in with the ham, potatoe mixture before baking.  Then I added more cheese to the top with 5 minutes left of cooking-turned out wonderful will make again!

I have nothing bad to say about this recipe.  It was really yummy.  The only thing I did differently was to add the cheddar Cheese into the cream mixture instead of on the top.  I will have this again.

So-so recipe, but has lots of potential.  WAY too much parsley.  I'd cut it back to a Tablespoon, or even a teaspoon.  We just didn't like the strong flavor the parsley had on the dish.  I think a good variation of the potaotes would be to use the freezer shreaded potatoes used in cheesy potatoes instead of cubed potatoes.  Broccoli was another veggie we would add to the recipe, or replace for the corn.  Will try again, but I am going to try and vary the recipe with the suggestions I made above.

Tasty casserole with mild flavors.  I used 1/4 cup chopped onions & 1/2 tsp. marjoram as one reviewer suggested. Tasted good.  I also used shredded monterey jack cheese instead of what the recipe called for.  It turned out fine.  Next time I'll try it with shredded cheddar cheese.

This recipe was pretty good....not terrific but okay. Things I did different was I used both frozen corn and peas, since if its not green, my mind doesnt count it as being a "vegetable", thus not being an "all-in-one" meal.  I also added a lot of garlic powder and microwaved the potatoes in a plastic zip lock bag for about 7 minutes so they would be semi-hard, yet soften in the oven. Also combined some bread crumbs to the cheese and broiled those on top for the last 3 minutes.  Pretty good, crunchy, and added to the presentation.  This came out not goopy or like my idea of a traditional casserole. I would have liked it better if it was one of those combine everything and cook in one dish recipes.  I will probably try another leftover ham casserole recipe next time I have leftover ham.

This recipe was great!  I roasted the potatoes with some garlic and butter instead of boiling them.  I also used a garlic pepper blend instead of just pepper.  I also used Velveeta light and added it directly to the roux and cooked for about 6 minutes to really thicken it.  My family raved about it.  My husband wants this weekly.

I made some changes, but it was really good. I shredded my own potatoes like hasbrowns, about 4 cups. Soaked and patted dry. Chopped up about 4 cups of ham. Made the white sauce as directed adding one can of cream of celery, but any cream of... soup would be good. Then added cheddar and jack cheese to the sauce until it melted. Mixed it all together topgether, poured it in a 9x13 pan, topped with more shredded cheese and crackers. Baked for 35 min. It was great and is better leftover!

Let me start by confessing I did not make this recipe exactly as written, I made three small modifications; I used a pre-cooked ham steak, substituted green beans for corn (which I was out of), and I sauted 2 minced cloves of garlic with the onion.  That said, the aroma this casserole filled my house with was mouthwatering, and the taste was heavenly.  This has become my new favorite casserole!  I can't even begin to describe how yummy this was!  This is a must-have recipe for every cook!

I told my husband that we would not keep this recipe unless it was awesome because you use so many dishes and it takes a while to make.  Well it is going in my recipe book because it was wonderful.  I really was not expecting it to be so good.  I made it exactly as told, but my husband sprinkled a little salt and garlic powder on his so I tried that too and it made it even better!

I tryed this recipe to use up the leftover Christmas ham.  My husband LOVED it but I just thought it was okay.  It is not the "prettiest" dish, but it has a good flavor.  I added 1tsp minced garlic to the gravey and put about 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese on top instead of the processed cheese.

An old standby that I realize I've never rated.  I saute onions, celery and peppers in mine and add a dash of Worchestershire and a shake of garlic salt.  I also top it with croutons over the pepper jack cheese during the last 5 min. to add a bit of crunch.  This is a great casserole to take to sick friends!

It's a good way to use up leftover ham, but that's kind of what it tasted like. I added maybe half a teaspoon of dry mustard and a couple of shakes of red pepper flakes to the sauce to spice it up a bit. It was an easy, hearty meal, and my hubby liked it. I'll keep it in mind the next time I have leftover ham.

Great,quick recipe! We used leftover holiday ham,so being already cooked, it didn't take long. We left the onions out for the picky ones, but added red pepper flakes to a few on the side for flavor, which was YUM!

I really liked this but I can see what others are saying about it being a little bland. I'll probably try some of the other reviewers suggestions next time. But otherwise pretty good! My husband liked it more than I did, he said it was good as is (and he's usually pretty honest about whether he likes something or not).

Good recipe. I use cheddar instead of American.  And to save myself time, I use o'brien hashbrowns.  Great way to use leftover ham from the holidays.

This was great, but instead of parsley I used dry kale. And I also whipped 3 eggs then poured them over the top just before I put it in the oven.

I made this casserole last evening with the last of our Easter ham.  It was incredibule!  We all loved it.  I doubled the recipe and made it with 1-15 oz can of creamed corn instead of whole kernal corn (I didn't realize I was out of whole kernal until I was in the midst of making it).  I think I will used creamed corn again but use a little less milk the next time.

This was really good and easy. I used frozen hashbrown potatoes instead  - 1) I was out of potatoes and 2) it was easier and very convenient! I put the potatoes, ham, corn and onions in a large pan and cooked for 10 minutes or so until the potatoes were unthawed and followed the recipe from that point.  I didn't have parsleyand I just used shredded cheddar cheese. It was very good and everyone ate it. I could see using some small diced green peppers in this as well. Yum!

Made this for supper tonight with leftover ham.  My family loved it.  I did a couple things different, mainly because I just use what I have on hand.  Used frozen corn and green beans and havarti cheese.  Didn't have parsley, so I didn't use it.  Turned out fantastic.  Very happy and will make again.

I made this with left over turkey from Christmas and my family loved it. The only change I made was I put velveta processed cheese chunks in with the mixture and then baked it. Then put the other cheese it called for on top later. It didnt last very long my kids loved it, which makes me happy:o)

I liked this recipe. I followed Duckball's recommendation and used cayenne and cheddar cheese in the sauce, as well as more onion. I skipped parsley and put minced garlic in with the onion, also. Instead of corn, I used 2 cans of green beans. It turned out nicely. A tasty way to use up ham.

Very good recipe!  The only thing I changed was I added more cheese (cheddar, not processed) to the actual casserole in addition to the cheese on top.  Definately will be making this one again! Easy, good and filling!

this is a really great base recipe that you can customize to your families tastes.  I used green beans and corn because my hubby is big into veggies, actually added quite a bit so it was a well rounded casserole.  Thankyou for submitting this for inspiration.  It did the trick :)

I was really impressed!  I didn't have an onion, but I substituted a little onion powder.  For the cheese I used shredded mozzarella.  It was quite easy to make, and I can see how it could be made with other meats (eg kielbasa, etc).  Still tastes great leftover as well.  We'll be making it again.

I love this recipe.  We triple it to make 2 9x13 pans - one for me and one to bless another family.  I use the southern style frozen hash brown potatoes (1 bag per 9x13) and add the cheese in with the white sauce so it is all melty and creamy.  Pure comfort food!

This is a great way to use up leftover ham.  It needed a little more salt and a little more liquid, but over all it turned out really good.  I will be sure to save it for my next ham leftovers.

This was a good way to use my leftover ham.  I liked it, the kids thought it was o.k. and my husband wouldn't touch it because of the potatoes.  I was going to have to throw the ham away, anyway.  This recipe was definitely worth a try.

This is really simple and good. I didn't have parsley either time I made it. I increased the potatoes to 3 cups (to make it go further) increased the onion to 1/4 cup. Added about 1 t ground mustard to the sauce. Used broccoli and corn as veggies in the casserole and topped it with cheddar and Parmesan cheese. It looks like I totally reworked the recipe but... it was good!!

We thoroughly enjoyed this dish.  Even though I halved it for the two of us, there is plenty left for lunch tomorrow. I added a bit of chopped garlic to the onions which I bumped up to a whole small onion - perhaps 1/4c; used cheddar and mixed it in as per another reviewer; and sprinkled some Parmesan on top.  I turned the broiler on for the final few minutes to get the top a little more toasty.  We didn't find this overly salty. I'll make this again.  Great way to use left over ham.  Served with steamed broccoli.

I cook the suppers, and the girl in the picture said this was the best casserole I have ever prepared.  I guess the corn made the difference. (I'm from Iowa.)  The only thing I did differently was to add part of the cheese into the mix, as well as to sprinkle cheese on top.  Certainly saving this one.

I used this recipes for chicken, I sauteed chicken, and seasoned liberally with paprika, chili powder and garlic powder, added scallions, green pepper and diced potatoes with onions. I grated real cheddar cheese into the sauce. i poured it all into a casserole dish and then added crushed ritz crackers on top. It was awesome.

This was a FABULOUS casserole... a great way to use up the left-over ham and corn-off-the cob sitting in my fridge.  Everyone loved it, even the picky kids and husband who doesn't like his food to touch!!  Comfort food at it's finest.

I was a bit disappointed in this recipe.  There wasn't a whole lot of flavor.  When I heated the leftovers, I added a can of green chilies.  Much tastier.

Pretty good, the kids liked it, but a little too salty for me. I guess between the ham and the cheese...otherwise, tasty and nice texture.

This was super tasty and easy to make ahead.  My few changes were:  add salt and garlic salt to the "gravy".  I omitted their 4 ounces of processed cheese and replaced it with 8 ounces of pepperjack that I shredded and melted in the gravy.

This is a great way to use leftover ham. The casserole disappeared in one evening. My young children didn't like it, however, but that is just because they don't like casseroles. I used season all as one reviewer suggested. Added more flavor. I think I'd try brocolli in this next time for color. Everything was very orange/yellow, but delicious all the same.

Good basic recipe that can be adjusted to taste.  My family enjoyed this dish, and I enjoyed getting to use the leftover ham!

I loved it but my kids are picky.  We all rated it and I think it's close to five stars.  I added 1/4 cup diced onions and didn't have enough ham so I cooked 6 pieces of bacon and crumbles it into it, it was delicious, thank You

My family loves this recipe.  I melted the processed cheese into the gravy and topped with shredded cheddar cheese for the last 5-10 min of bake time.  Wonderful!

This is a very good recipe.  I did a few things differently, I used a whole onion (smallish) and one clove of garlic.  I also added cayenne pepper and some smoked paprika because I thought it might be a bit bland otherwise.  I also sprinkled bread crumbs on top of the cheddar cheese--it was a hit.  I will be making this again for sure.

I changed this one up so much I feel bad giving it a bad rating, but without the changes it would have been kinda bland.  I read the reviews, and this is what I did differently: (1) chopped mini red potatoes and pan fried them in some olive oil instead of boiling them. (2) Took the potatoes out and added an onion and 3 cloves of minced garlic (3) added about 3 tbsp of butter and flour, and the slowly added milk a little at a time. (4) added pepper, nutmeg and a bit of tabasco.  (5) added cheddar and monterey jack cheese as I don't eat processed. (6) the cooking time was off for my oven.  400 worked perfectly for me.  Thanks!  this was awesome with these changes.

This was really good on a cold night, great comfort food!  I liked it so much, I made it twice in one week.  It was a great way to use that leftover spiral ham that tends to dry out quickly.  I will be making this again whenever I have leftover ham.

This was a great, easy dish. I followed suggestions and pan fryed my potatoes first. I also added dill instead of parsley, just because of personal preference. Everyone had seconds including my picky five year old.

Definitely a winner. We nixed the 'cheese food' for colby cheese and actually added some of it to the gracy itself. Fattening and yummy.

I used macaroni instead of potatoes and mixed cheddar cheese into the white sauce instead of Velveeta.I also added garlic to the onions sauted in butter.I put crushed up potato chips on the top.  It was good but not great.

I sauted the potatoes in half of the butter and seasoned them with a pinch of salt and some pepper. I also mixed the parsley with the onions in the sauce pan, prior to adding milk and flower. I forgot to add the corn but it was still very good. I used freshly shredded extra sharp white cheddar for the toping rather than processed cheese and it was very tasty.

I made some revisions because I didn't have any processed cheese. I cooked about 5 strips of bacon and then sauteed the onions and potatoes in the pan. I removed the vegetables and made the sauce in the skillet. Then I added about a cup of shredded Cheddar and Monterey Jack mixed. I mixed the potatoes,ham, onions and 3 strips of back crumbled, poured the sauce over and topped with about 3/4 cup of cheese and the remaining crumbled bacon. It was yummy!

This was okay. I would only make it again if I had leftover ham. I followed the recipe, except I didn't have onions so I used a 2 tsp. of onion powder. One wasn't enough.  After I made the casserole it was kinda bland so I added garlic salt to it.  This dish reminded me of potato soup... kinda tasted similar to it.

This tasted okay so I gave it an average rating.  It is a cheap and easy meal to throw together and gives you another alternative for using up leftover ham.

This was ok.  My family ate it, it's definitely better than throwing out the left-over ham that won't get eaten otherwise.  I added a cracker crust on top and just a little green pepper for color and taste.  Will look for another alternative for left over ham though, as it didn't excite me.

This is just a nice, fairly easy casserole dish, the kind kids would like, good for a potluck. I added just a bit extra cheese (used cheddar cheese) and mixed in half the cheese with the sauce and put the other half on top. Also put a light sprinkling of Italian bread crumbs on top. I salted the potatoes when I boiled them and also added a bit of salt to the sauce--I think that made it a little too salty; next time I'll cut back on the salt a bit. I also sauteed with the onion half a cut-up red bell pepper, just because I had it. I added a bit more onion too--half a small onion. I think all the changes I made (except the extra salt) were positive, although I can't say for sure because this was the first time I made the recipe. It was also pretty rich--I used whole milk, next time I might try skim or 2%. I didn't find the dish too bland as some other reviewers did.

I found this MOST delicious with some changes I made!  I noted what others said about it being bland and adjusted the recipe.  I added 1/2 tsp of salt (had none in the recipe other then when cooking the potatoes) 2-3 dashes of curry powder in the white sauce plus used shredded sharp cheddar cheese and added about 2/3 of it to the white sauce, stirring until melted.  I also added chopped green pepper to the meat/potato/corn mixture.  While boiling the potatoes I added a large clove of garlic (I always do this), then after the potatoes were drained, I chopped the cooked garlic and added it to the ingredients.  I then added the rest of the shredded cheese in the last 5 minutes on top.  This did come out a bit too much sauce so will adjust that the next time I make it.  Was very yummy!

Starch in potatoes, corn and flour.  Too much starch !!!and the flavor was very bland  and texture  pasty except for a lot of parsley taste. I used processed cheese as per recipe, but definitely it needs cheddar to perk it up. Would not make this again.Will try another recipe rather than trying to alter this one.Gave 3 stars only because it had  a few good ingredients.

I don't know if it is fair to rate this recipe because I changed it so much.  Not any fault of the recipe just things I had on hand.  First I used chicken instead of ham.  I also used frozen hash browns, added a can of green beans with the corn.  I also added more onion and a chopped jalapeno to add some spice. Only had 1 cup of milk so I used a can of Cream of chicken soup with the cup of milk.  I also added cheese to the soup and milk mixture and also cheese on the top.   It was great.  I can't wait to try it with ham.  Thanks Lindy Sue.

My family of 4 kids and husband loved this recipe.  I did not have time to cut and boil potaotes, so I used 3 cups frozen hash browns.  It made it thick like a casserole should be.  Also, I used frozen mixed vegis and added some Mrs. Dash to flavor boost it!  We did not use ANY CHEESE, (allergy) and it still was a big hit.

This is good and enjoyable.  More like a thick soup than a casserole, but good.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used cheddar cheese because I did not have the processed cheese.

This has to be one of the best leftover recipes ever.  Only changes I made were frozen corn (because that's what I use), added garlic seasoning and if I have them on hand I toss in a small can of diced green chilies (drained)

This was a good rough draft. I made it my own by adding cheese in the cream mixture, along with season all, and garlic sauce. I also didnt use as much butter was called for. All in all it came out very good.

This recipe was an excellent starting point for a great dish! Everyone in my house loved it! I made a few minor changes to fit our tastes. I used shredded cheddar cheese in place of the processed cheese food for the cheese topping and added some in the sauce as well (~1/4 cup, didn't really measure). I also added paprika and garlic pepper to the sauce. One roommate is vegetarian, so I altered the recipe for him by cutting the recipe in half, omitted the ham, and added ~1 cup frozen mixed veggies and ~1 cup frozen green beans. For the meaty version, I added ~2 1/3  cups of ham and ~2 1/3 cups of cubed potatoes, and used 2 cups frozen mixed veggies instead of corn. I made the same cheese variation as mentioned above. 

Overall, a great recipe. Perfect place to start to prepare a dish that fits your house's tastes!

Was too "pasty" for my taste, and if I were to ever make it again, it could definitely use an extra cup of ham.

The sauce was a little bland. Next time I might add something to it but other then using cheddar instead of processed cheese I did everything like it said.

Good simple recipe for leftover ham.  I wanted a one-dish meal, so I have added either peas or green beans along with the corn.  Or just use 2 c. of frozen mixed diced vegetables (cooked) in place of the corn for a really easy version.  I prefer more flavor, so I use one medium onion, chopped, and sharp cheddar rather than American cheese.  Simple and tasty, and well-liked by all my family, from grandparents down to 2-year-old nephew.

I mixed the cheese in with the sauce, to make more of a mac 'n cheese style sauce.  It was great both the first, and second times around!

So far this is my favorite ham casserole recipe.  I made it exactly by the recipe the 1st time & it was very good.  The 2nd time I added a bit more onion & used cheddar cheese.  I prefer it with the cheddar.

This was a perfect recipe to use up leftover Easter ham. It was really easy and really, really good! (I don't know if the author meant processed American cheese (like Kraft slices) or Velveeta, but I used Velveeta & it was awesome!)

Nice and easy to put together and tastes good. Will definately make again but add some more seasonings and and some garlic. I found it still needed more of a kick. I may add the cheese in with the white sauce too and bake all together. I also plan to make this again but try it with pasta, like elbow or egg noodles. Thanks for sharing!

This is classic comfort food on a cold winter/fall evening. I eliminated the corn & substitued carrots and used real colby cheese instead of processed. It was excellent. Can't miss with this one. Easy too!

This is one of the best comfort-food recipes I have ever tasted. I use it often to use up the end piece of spiral ham. The only thing I change is that I use shredded cheddar cheese, and I don't worry much about the potato, ham, or cheese quantities. Whatever I have works out great every time!

Very, very good recipe.  I followed the suggestions of other folk and used canned sliced potatoes to save that step.  I used a can of cream of mushroom soup and a half cup of evaporated milk instead of what is listed here (fat free evap milk for me).  I also used shredded 'mexican mixture' cheese that I increased from half cup to whole cup.  I used half my cheese mixed in with the recipe, put the other half on top before baking.  The meal was a hit - great way to use up leftover ham.

Added a couple of shakes of garlic powder and a little bit of pepper as suggested by others.  Served with a can of green beans.  Left the cheese off one half of it (that's the nice thinga about adding the cheese at the end) and even my cheese-hater enjoyed it.  Very filling.

This was so good, and really easy to make.  My kids didn't like it, but they aren't fussy on foods that are mixed together (ok, so they're weird!).  My husband and I really enjoyed it, and we were able to use a lot of leftover ham.  The only thing I changed, was using cheddar cheese instead of processed.  Great comfort food.

A great recipe for leftovers or someone on a budget. I had a large ham to use up and some potatoes left over.  I substituted sharp cheese for processed cheese and added lots of garlic powder and salt and pepper.  Flavor was great! Don't be afaid to keep coking that rue....it needs to cook for quite a while!  Overall great recipe...not gourmet...but very satisfying and filling for a winter night!!!

Fast, good,an easy cleanup, and the kids loved it! I used a can of cream of mushroom soup, milk, and cheddar cheese on top.  I've made before using leftover ham, but today I bought an inexpensive ham just for this-as well as freezing it for other meals.

This recipe is quite good.  I increased the amount of onion, added granulated garlic, more pepper and seasoning salt to the white sauce and used grated Colby cheese instead.  Everyone liked it and I'll make it regularly.

I used 2 cans of potatoes, and instead of making the white sauce, I just used a can of cream of mushroom soup along with about 1 cup of milk.  I just tossed some diced onions in with the ham mixture.  I also used the version for 8 people.  Everyone liked it, even my picky kids.  A very good way to use up the leftover ham.

This was a good recipe.  My husband liked it a lot and so did my daughter, but it didn't leave any leftovers.  Next time I am going to use chedder on the top instead of the processed cheese. I think that will taste better.

This was a great dish! I did add more onion and more cheese. I made the dish for 8 people, 5 people ate it and there wasn't much left over. My son wants me to try it next time with bacon in it and some garlic. GOOD DISH!

This casserole was wonderful!!!  I think the quality of the ham has a lot to do with it.  My twelve year old loved this.  I had to laugh because he told all his friends about it, so it must've been good.

My whole family loved this dinner! It's easy to make up the evening before a busy day when you know you aren't going to have time to cook dinner. Just make it up, put it in the fridge (covered), and heat it the next day.

I made this with leftovers from Easter dinner and it was fabulous!  Come to find out this is something that my husbands mom used to make when he was a kid!  It was extremely easy and good!  My hubby told me I can make it anytime, not just when we have leftovers!

Great recipe the whole family loved.  No need to cook the potatoes before assembling ingredients.  Also, I added the Velvetta cheese to the "gravy" mixture until melted, thus eliminating  the last step and infusing the dish with the cheesy goodness.  Also, added more onion than was called for.  It didn't look like enough cheese before baking but was exactly right when finished.  Thanks for the great recipe.

It was good. I substituted cheddar cheese for the Velveeta cheese. It’s a great way to use up extra ham.

Not bad at all for leftovers. Yes add extra spices to your roux, more ham and potatoes less milk will solve the "soupy" issue.

As is,this recipe as written sounds bland,but is an excellent  'jumping board' to play around with. First and foremost, I used sharp chedder cheese,because processed cheese is awful and doesn't have any beneficial taste appeal. In fact,you can use any type of REAL cheese that has a strong enough flavor to enhance the taste of this dish. I also replaced half of the potatoes called for with roasted califlower that I made ahead of time with half cubbed potatoes.I  replaced the corn with Trader Joes broccoli peas and vegetable medly. I also followed some users advice and sauteed 1/4 cup of chopped onion with 1/2 cup of finely diced celery with 1 tablespoon of butter,then added 1 teaspoon of Creole seasoning, 1 cup of half and half instead of butter,and added 1/3 cup of gluten free flour,( I am allergic to wheat),and 3/4 cup of sharp chedder to make a cheesy sauce.If its too thick, you can add more cream.Before popping it in the oven, I put 1 cup of shredded cheese on the top of the casserole and baked per instructions.  So delicious! Got quite a few high compliments from co-workers at the holiday potluck!

With the changes I made, I would give this a 4. I tasted the sauce before I mixed it with the ham and veggies and it was very bland.  I added chicken bullion, garlic, salt, some buttermilk, and water.  I also mixed some cheese in with the potatoes as it baked and then sprinkled more on top.  Really this is just cheesy potatoes with ham and corn and I have a couple good cheesy potatoes recipes that are a lot better than this.  My kids quite liked it, though.

Delicious! I cubed the potatoes and sauteed it with the onions until soft but still firm and not mushy. Did not want to boil to get potatoes too soft. Used suggestion from another review to use a can of mex corn. Used an entire small onion instead of just a tablespoon.Used an 8 oz bag of shredded cheddar divided into sauce and saved some to sprinkle on top. Brought dish to a church event and got rave compliments!

This recipe was a good one for leftover ham.  The changes I made was cooking the potatoes only until completely tender.  That left them with more bite after baking.  Also, I didn't use canned corn.  Instead I used fresh sweet corn cut off the cob.  It added a dimension of flavor.  Instead of Velveeta cheese, I grated sharp cheddar on top.

I followed the instructions except for I cubed the cheese rather than trying to shred it. It was not "soupy" at all. There was some liquid, but I would not consider that as a soup. I made it for my family of three I was visiting and two guests. Three of the people eating were men.  I doubled the recipe and about an eighth was left. The men especially devoured it. My mom said she would like it better with a different cheese (I used Velveeta), but she still liked it. A nice different type of dish. I used leftover ham from Christmas dinner. I especially liked it with sour cream, little green onions, some green habanero hot sauce, and red pepper flakes (I like spicy and the sour cream and onions went well with the potato). It reminds me of a specialty-type baked potato in a dish.

Great but... I used sweet potatoes, peas and mixed the cheese in the casserole before baking.  Topped with crushed Ritz crackers dotted with butter.  Result was rich, very creamy and super delicious.

Excellent - following the suggestions of others. I added more onion (1/2 cup), chopped celery (2 stalks), ¼ tsp. onion powder, and ¼ tsp cayenne pepper. However, the BEST addition, by far, was adding ¼ cup chopped fresh (or canned) green chile. Ham & green chile are wonderful together IMO! After adding 4 oz. Velveeta to the butter/onion/flour/milk mixture, I mixed in the ham & potatoes and baked for 30 minutes. Topped it with a sprinkle of Mexican cheese blend for the last 10 minutes. A keeper for sure!

Followed the recipe with a few additions:  1/4 cup more chopped onions,  1/3 cup grated pepper jack cheese and 1 cup each of frozen peas and corn.  It was not runny, but not really thick either.  Everyone enjoyed it.

Great for using up holiday leftovers.  I was looking for something to use up leftover ham.  We are Paleo so made a few substitutions - Green beans in place of the corn and arrowroot starch instead of flour, ghee in place of butter and almond milk in place of milk.  We did keep the cheese in place as we do a little dairy. It was great!  Whole family enjoyed it.  Getting ready to make another casserole and put it in the freezer to use up the last of the Christmas ham.

06.07.17 ~ Having to use up some leftover ham, I came across this recipe.  I made a full batch, but made three small casserole dishes to share with my parents and MIL.  I then put the remainder in a dish for our dinner.  My dad and husband really liked it.  I thought it was good, but not something I would make often.  I served it with fresh fruit and a tossed salad.

What a great way to use up leftovers. I had some boiled red potatoes left over so cut them up to use, along with some frozen corn. Very easy and tasty!

I did make a change. I thought the sauce was to thick so I added more milk, Wrong when it cooked it was too soupy. 
The taste was OK. I might make it again. Might use chicken breast next time and more spices also.
Over all a good side dish.

This was a tasty recipe. I used 1/2 can of corn (that's what I had in the frig) and I substituted grated sharp cheddar since I am not a fan of "cheese food". I omitted the salt since the ham I used was quite salty. It was a nice hearty meal and we ate it all, yum!

Nice, simple, hearty way to make use of ham leftovers.  I mostly followed the recipe but used half an onion and sauteed with a stalk of celery and a clove of garlic.  Also used steak seasoning instead of pepper and shredded montery jack for cheese.  Even my very picky son liked it!

I combined suggestions from other reviews: used a combo of Monterey Jack and 4 cheese Mexican cheese and lots more; used red potatoes with skins left on; used 1/4 cup onions; a sprinkle of red pepper; Kefir low fat milk; threw on some French fried onions on top.

I thought this looked and sounded good. It was very wet and my husband and I ate a small amount and threw away the rest (we never do that). The only change I made was to add a half can of cream of mushroom soup (I don't think that would've made that much difference). I would try to bake it uncovered the whole time. (Our other issue is that we used a cheap quality ham...that was our biggest problem). I wouldn't say "don't make it", but I would say "use good ham"

Made this tonight and it is delicious! I substituted Herbes de Provence for the fresh parsley and another type of shredded cheese I had on hand.  If my husband would eat them, I'm sure peas or green beans would be excellent in this! Two thumbs up from me.  Shared it on Facebook too!  TY!

My family loved it. I changed the recipe somewhat.  I diced an onion into the potatoes while they were cooking.
And instead of corn. I used a can of  peas and diced carrots.  Instead of putting it into my baking dish all at once, I put a layer of the mixture in my dish and sprinkled cheddar cheese onto it. Then add rest of the mixture. And covered and baked it. Then add more cheese..

I followed a top review which advised sautéing the onion and diced potato together instead of boiling them.  I didn't peel the potatoes.  I added garlic powder, paprika, and some cayenne pepper to the milk/Velveeta sauce.  My husband really liked this for lunch- an easy dish and a great way to use up ham.

Great casserole! I added leftover corned beef brisket in addition to the ham and some peas along with the corn plus 8 oz. shredded cheese instead of processed cheese. Delicious! Will definitely make again.

Like most, I made this based on things I had on hand.  I actually used everything but also used some jimmy dean sausage I had leftover and a bit more potatoes and onions, as well as more cheese, just because I like cheese.  This is a great recipe that you can add or take away just about anything and it will still be great.  The men in my house each had 3 helpings and said it was awesome.  My teenager said he didn't like it with corn, while everyone else liked the corn.  So really, it is a recipe you can adjust to your liking.

This is my 18 year old son's most favorite dish ever.  I found it quite a while ago and made it and he still begs for it.  We're not onion fans so I just use onion powder. Surprising him with it today since according to him I'm neglecting him by not having made it in a while.
Thanks.

I doubled the ham and potatoes. Diced the potatoes small, but did not cook.   Used 1 can corn. Doubled onion and butter and used dried parsley (40ml) sautéed all together. Added 1/2 cup flour and 2 cups milk to make the gravy. Mixed all together and baked covered for about 1 hour. It had a perfect texture and thickness for my liking. I added shredded cheddar cheese after, but did not bake again. 
I doubled it because my boys are big eaters.

I made this tonight with leftover ham. It was delicious; my husband loved it! I did have to make a couple of substitutions because I didn't have time to go shopping and just used what I had. I used 2 tsp. of onion flakes instead of fresh onion and dried parsley in place of fresh. Otherwise I made it exactly by the recipe. I will definitely make this dish again!

I modified quite a bit... I had some bacon grease that I used in addition to the butter, and maybe used a total of 1/8 cup, certainly not 1/4 cup.  I also used whole wheat flour and sweet potatoes (my son could not tell the difference about the flour nor the potatoes).  Finally I did not use the amount of processed cheese suggested.  All in all, it was good.

I used Duckball's suggestions and it turned out well.  Only complaint is that it takes as much work and as many dirty pans as fixing a "real" dinner in the first place.  I like simple, easy to make casseroles.

Came out delicious! I used 4 medium potatoes , didn't have parsley and forgot to add corn (will throw it into the leftovers). I added chopped green peppers to the onions and butter, seasoned with salt and pepper. I didn't measure the flour or milk, just knew what consistency I was going for. I added shredded sharp cheddar to the potatoes and sauce before cooking in over and then topped it off with more cheese. Comes out just a little soupy. I think I read in another review that they subbed eff noodles for potatoes, will try next time!

I took a chance and used chicken stock instead of milk and also threw in peas, carrotts and corn.  I left off the cheese as none of us like it.  It turned out better than expected.  Kids loved it and thats the best compliment anyone can get!

Used Southwest/fiesta corn and broccoli, no processed cheese. Used fresh cilantro instead of parsley.  Used leftover pork roast. Keeper!

Yum! This was really good, we all loved it.  I had some leftover ham to use up, and this was perfect.  I will make this again for sure.

I added more items to this dish as it sounded a little bit bland for my taste buds.  I added red peppers, Durkee fried onions, Red pepper flakes velveeta mexican cheese. This was pretty good and will be making it again.

Very delicious!  I used leftover ham from the holidays and it came out great.  I used canned diced yellow potatoes instead of peeling chopping and cooking my own and it turned out great!!! One word of caution... if you have medical conditions which require you to watch your salt intake canned potatoes probably are not best for you to use.  Great recipe!

I found this recipe because all I had readily available and not frozen was ham. And boy am I glad I found it! The whole family loved it! Of course I did put cheese in that mixture not just on top and I added some Mrs. dash original seasoning as well. Delicious lol.

I give this a 5 star because it was good. After reading a few of the other reviews I changed it a little. I used 3 potatoes peeled and diced but I only cooked them for about 7 min. since they are going to be baked. I also cut down on the milk because of other reviews said it was too soupy with all that milk. I added cracker crumbs on top when I put in oven and did put the cheddar cheese on top just before done. Husband loved it.

I have made this twice, once following the recipe, once with some tweaks. My tweaks: adding celery with the onion, mixing in some spicy brown mustard to the sauce and the lazy tweak of using frozen diced potatoes. Will definitely make again. I make double and freeze one for a future meal.

I read the other reviews and followed the advice. I used only 1 cup of milk and 1/4 cup flour. I added 1/2 a red pepper, finely diced to the onions for sautéing and 1 cup of blanched broccoli.  I think the broccoli is absolutely necessary - both for colour and taste.  I liked it a lot but my husband LOVED it.

Yes, I cubed the cheese food, and added it in with everything, put in pan, and sprinkles over sharp cheddar cheese. My family Loved it. I made it 3 weeks ago, and plan to make a double batch tomorrow for freezer meals! Really, Great recipe!

Good option to use ham--I added more onion and cooked until translucent in butter (about 5 minutes) and also added 1 t of thyme (dried) because it tasted a bit bland. I also steamed cubed potatoes so I didn't lose any nutritional value (about 10 minutes).

Just made this recipe for my family.  Everyone loved it.  I pretty much followed as is, but I stirred in extra cheese to the casserole in addition to putting it on top.  Also, I didn't have parsley so I skipped that.

I changed it up a bit with what I had on hand.  I used Cumberland Gap Ham Chunks that were BOGO this week at Publix.  Also, used Simply Potato Hash browns with onions that were also BOGO.  Added some leftover corn from last night and a little bit of Crystal hot sauce to the potato/ham mixture.  Before I poured the sauce on, I cut up small pieces of Velveeta and placed on top of the potato/ham mixture.  I baked for about 45 min and then sprinkled shredded cheddar cheese on top and bake for about 8-10 min longer.  It was yum yum!

Made this recipe for dinner the other night! Loved it! I did double the ham & potatoes because it just didn't seem like much, ended up filling the intire pan to the top with just enough space for cheese! I used mozzarella & mild cheddar for the cheese because that's what I had on hand! I was actually pleasantly surprised that my hubby liked it as much as he did! :-)

We loved the flavor of this dish. I sauteed two sliced celery ribs (substituted for parsley) and 1/4 cup onion in the butter, then added the flour, but mistakenly used 2 cups milk. I also used shredded cheddar because that is what I had. The end result was a bit runny (my error with the milk), but the flavor was very good, and the husband said to keep this recipe. Thanks for sharing!

This was easy to make and excellent to taste.  My husband loved it and went back for seconds.  I made it exactly as the recipe directed except added a 1/4 cup of onions instead of a tablespoon.

This had very little flavor, even after adjusting per some of the top comments. It was a good way to use up some leftover ham, but that is about it. Lots of room for improvement.

Use cheese - no cheese soup, no substitute  - it needs it for flavor/taste. Good. Very similar to other 'ham casserole' recipes listed.

Made this the night after making ham, cabbage, and potatoes that resulted in too many leftovers. Obviously, i didn't get to use the cabbage and had to throw it out, but the ham and potatoes found another purpose. Did not add any parsley but i always omit spices i don't already have on hand or substitute with something else and have never been disappointed. Boyfriend thought it was amazing.

i am a nanny so i have limited supplies/groceries to work with sometimes, i had ham steaks but no potatoes so i used a box of scalloped potatoes(BC) and cubed up the hamsteaks followed the ingrediants for the box and then all the ingrediants i had for this recipe and the family LOVED it, even all 3 kids ate it, which is almost a miracle!! i saved this to my recipe box, the only thing i would change is the salt, not sure why but its seemed very salty to me!

This was absolutely incredible! The only change I made was to add about 1/4 tsp. of minced garlic and I had more Velveeta than four ounces to use up. It was delicious and the cooking time was right on the money, too. I selected this recipe to get rid of some left-over ham and Velveeta, but I will be sure to make this over and over again-not just to use up left-overs! The only warning that I would like to add is that this dish disappears quickly as it is soooo tasty. We had this for New Year's Day and there was not a crumb left. It is the perfect casserole dish. Yum-and thank you so much!

This is a great recipe for left over ham.  I did not have corn on hand, so I added a half of a can of peas and carrots.  I followed the recipe as written until the cheese sauce.  I did half and half, velveeta and sharp cheddar, the flavor is more robust that way.  Salt and Pepper and this is a great meal.  I served with a loaf of french bread/butter.  Thanks!

Hubby and I gave this 3 stars. It was just okay. I added some garlic powder as well as crispy french onions to the mix and then with the cheese topping later and that helped. My husband said they would love it at his firehouse since it's a "cracker barrel" kind of dish. Thanks for the recipe :) Might try making another time with broccoli instead of corn.

YUM! I had some ham broth so I used that with milk for a total of 2 cups of fluids - added half the cheese with the mix and added the other half on the top as recommended. A pinch of garlic and season salt -  Hubby finished it off! THANKS for a great recipe!

Perfect. I did use cheese whiz though (all I had on hand), melted it and stirred into the milk mixture before topping the casserole. Threw in some garlic, and Voila! Loved it, and so did the family. Thank you!

This was pretty good, although it took me awhile just because I'm not a "cook". I couldn't get the flour mixture to work at all the first time...so I just poured flour and milk together n a bowl, whisked it together, then put in the pan. That worked for me! Thanks for the recipe!

I'm always looking for good recipes to use up leftover ham, and this one fit the bill.  The sauce came out a bit runny but was still quite tasty.  I didn't have Velveeta on hand, so I used cheddar.  Next time, I may try adding some dry mustard to the sauce for a little zing.

This is my favorite way to use up leftover ham. I've made this on a few occasions and it always tastes good. I make it pretty much the way the recipe dictates - maybe a little more seasoning and cheese. It's one of my husband's top choices as well.

I made this with leftover Ham from Easter dinner. It was fantastic. My husband LOVED IT! Thanks for the additional tips...adding more spices really made a difference. I used dill mix instead of parsley and it was amazing!! Thanks again.

This is delicious and reminiscent of Cracker Barrel. I used leftover Christmas ham, baby red potatoes, peas, and corn. Since the potatoes had been roasted with dill, I omitted the parsley. Instead of processed cheese, I used the grated pepper jack and sharp cheddar I had on hand. My family loved it, and I'm sure I'll make it again.

This was....ok.  It was a great way to use up the leftovers from Thanksgiving in one big dish but the kids weren't crazy about it.  I might make it again if I happen to have leftover potatoes and ham.

For a casserole... it was good. I used baking potatoes because it was all I had- and boiled them for about 12 minutes, and they were plenty done in the end. I also added a bit more potatoes and ham (probably nearly 3 cups of each, and did not change the sauce. It was moist enough. Good recipe!

This was good.  I did add more onion and I mixed in some melted Velvetta before putting it in the oven.  Then sprinkled shredded cheese on top the last 5 minutes of baking.  My husband went back 3 times.  Unfortunately my kids were being picky.

Definitely not my favorite.  Kind of bland.  If I decide to make again, I will probably mix the cheese into the casseole and add other spices or seasoning.

This is a comfort dish - very good.  After softening the onions, I add the ham and corn and fry for a few minutes.  I also add old light cheddar cheese instead of the processed cheddar.  Very good!

Really good all in one recipe. I added some carrots, green beans, onions and green pepper just mix in some more veggies and make it more well rounded. I also used shredded chedder cheese since we are not fans of velveta type cheese. It was a great way to use up some of the hame i had left over from a few nights before. I used the rest for breakfast the next morning. I also suggest using a few more spices. Italian (which has a few key spices mixed together) and some garlic salt. It would have been a bit blander had I not added those.

Very good! I added garlic and used a whole small onion. I had about 1/3 cup extra cheddar cheese and I added that to the gravy. Used one cup of milk and one cup of half and half to thicken the gravy. Didn't have Velveeta so I used 7 pieces of processed American cheese. My two year old LOVED this, he gobbled it up! Hubby loved it too. Although I used extra pepper and seasoned salt, I did think it was a little bland. I'll have to use more spices next time. Thanks for sharing.

I made this last night and it was great.  I made a few changes..not many.  I added 1/4 cup of cheese to the ham and corn mixture because we really love cheese.  I also added crushed Ritz crackers to the top, with the cheese, to give it a little crunch.  It came out great...the taste is wonderful and this will be made many more times in our house. I made a salad to go with it..but didn't need it. This dish is very filling.

Very good recipe... the corn was an interesting addition (had never made this recipe with corn added). I made a few changes based on other comments regarding the Velveeta.  Try using 1/2 sharp cheddar and 1/2 Velveeta, and I think this will help cut down on the "Velveeta taste" for you.  Also added 1/2 (that would actually be 1/4 based on the recipe and the addition of the cheddar) of the Velveeta to the flour/butter/milk mixture and melted it into it because I like my ham & potatoes to have a nice creamy sauce to them.  Then add the rest of the cheese - Velveeta and Cheddar on the top to melt and brown.  Excellent comfort food!  Thanks for the recipe.

My husband and I both loved this.  We agree that it is better than scalloped potatoes & ham.  Guess the corn gives it that special flavor.

The taste was great... the consistency wasn't so great.
I made the garlic, velveeta, onion changes as noted in a previous review, but the recipe did not specify what size to cut up the potatoes.  I cut them approximately 1 cm cubed, and this was much too small.  After boiling them for 15 minutes (as the recipe says) they were mush, and this made the entire casserole quite mushy, even soupy. 
I would suggest using less milk, cutting the potatoes into 1 inch or larger cubes, and boiling them for less than 10 minutes.

I loved this. Made it tonight for the 2nd time in a week. This is great for Easter Ham left overs. I did change it up a bit. I added parmesian cheese into the sauce. I also mixed some into the ham and potato's. I also threw in a little garlic salt and garlic powder for some extra flavor. It was wonderful! A new family favorite, even for my middle son, who is the pickiest eater!!! Thanks!

I don't know what I did, but this was not what we were hoping for. It was way too salty and didn't have any real flavor. Glad to see others have enjoyed it, but it won't be on my menu again.

This was good.  My family enjoyed it. (I have 2 teenaged boys.)  I used 4 c. potatoes and fried them with a small onion in a little olive oil.  This doesn't make the casserole as pretty as the picture because the potatoes were browned.  I added 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder.  I only used one can of corn.  I used 1 stick of butter, 2/3 c. flour and 2 1/2 c. milk.  I cubed 8 oz. Velveeta and tossed it in before baking.  I will make it again.  It's very rich and a good stick-to-your ribs hearty.

Not good. I can't say that it tasted bad because it didn't but there was something about it that I didn't like. My family didn't care for it either. Some reviewers complained of it being to soupy, completely opposite for me. It was extremely thick and gelatinous, just like paste. I think the velveeta cheese is a poor choice in this recipe, maybe cheddar would be better. I certainly would not make this again.

I made this tonight and it received mixed reviews. Most of the family said it was OK, but one person really liked it. Here's what I changed based on previous reviews: (1) used 3 cups frozen hash brown potatoes {cubes no shredded} pan-fried in a little olive oil with the chopped ham, (2) used 3 cups chopped ham, (3) added 1/2 tsp. salt at the end, (4) used 2 cups of skim milk, (5) used 1/4 tsp. pepper, (6) substituted 2/3 cup chopped green bell pepper for the onion, (7) added 1 Tbsp. minced garlic & 2 tsp. dried oregano & 2 tsp. dried basil & 2 tsp. dried parsley flakes to the saute with the green pepper, (8) used just over 8 ounces of Velveeta cheese and added it to the white sauce. It wasn't soupy like others have said. The sauce was nice and thick right out of the oven. I found the corn to be a little out of place, however. Also I cooked everything in the same skillet so it was easy clean up. Anyway, an easy way to use up that leftover Easter ham.

This seemed to dirty a lot of dishes.  I would have liked it a little cheesier and with a bit of a kick.  It was kind of bland so I put chipotle Tobasco sauce on it when served.  Much better.

I thought this was really good comfort food. The additions I made were to add a little minced garlic and allspice to the sauce mixture and I changed the shapes of the ham and potatoes for a differnt texture. I sliced the potatoes thin and cut the ham into longish strips (thicker than julienned). Hubby and I both enjoyed and my 11-month old was able to eat parts of it.

I will definitally make again.

Not sure if I did something wrong or if it is just a personal preference - but what was the milk sauce mixture all about?  There was so much of it and although it was creamy, it wasn't particularly tasty.  I think it might have been better if the cheese was melted in with it rather than or in addition to being poured on top.

Very good! Perfect for a ham leftovers meal. I just added garlic salt and onion salt and extra pepper. Once I added the milk to the onion mixture, I only cooked it on high for about 45 seconds and it was thichened. I will definately make this again as it is very easy and tasty too!

This was really good.  I used green onion (3 of them, sliced) because that's what I had on hand.  I used more black pepper, about 1/4 tsp., and I put about 3/4 cup of cheddar in the sauce.  Be careful not to overcook the potatoes or they will get too mushy.

I'm glad I found this to use our leftover Easter ham in, instead of just having ham sandwiches again.  I used probably 3/4 cup of onion (1 Tbsp. is hardly worth the effort!) and it was great.  Increasing the onion justified using 1/4 cup butter to sautee it in.  After tasting the sauce, I was worried that it was too bland, so I added a generous amount of pepper, a T. or two of chili powder, and sprinkled paprika on the cassrole before mixing it together.  The flavors really baked together in the end.  It was delicious, and filling!

Outstanding!!!  I read some of the reviews ahead of time, and saw several comments about this dish being rather bland.  So I decided to add dill weed (same amount as the parsley), as well as some garlic pepper.  It was fantastic!

Very good!  I loved how fast and easy it was, however, I found it to be a tad bit bland.  But, like other reviewers, I'm not sure exactly what it needs.  Will for sure make again for those busy "middle of the week" nights.

Really good. Stick to your ribs kinda meal.  I'd give it 4.5 stars---it needs something for a little kick but I'm not sure what.  Will make again.

This was really good. After reading the reviews I added cream of broccoli soup instead of the white sauce, but that was my only change. The whole family thought it was delicious. I served it with some warm bread so it wasn't too much of one flavor. Thanks for the recipe.

I used part leftover mashed potatoes and part cooked cubed potatoes.  I added garlic salt and onion salt (instead of fresh onion) for flavor.  Also, I increased the milk to 2 cups.  We loved it!  I served it as a thick potato soup. Great way to use leftovers!

This was dreamy.  I used left over baked potatoes in place of boiled.  Creamy texture. Our potatoe-hating kid loved it.

It was pretty good.  A cross between a potato/corn chowder and scalloped potatoes and ham.  Not quite what I was looking for, but it worked.

This was good, but not great.  DH liked it, but I thought it was a little too heavy and cheesy (and I LOVE cheese!) I would probably make again though if only to use up leftovers.  Thanks!

I made this as close to the recipe as possible with the ingredients that I had on hand.  My husband doesn't like a lot of cheese so I sprinkled a little cheddar on top-mostly for looks.  We don't have ham very often so next time I might try hamburger meat.

I'm not sure what to say: "bland" "kinda weird" "okay" or politely "different".  I probably won't make this one again, but my hubby and 18 month old did eat it without much complaint.

Very good!  I added an additional 2 ounces of cheese.  Wasn't sure how to shredded that kind of cheese - not very easy to do, so I just diced it and it worked perfectly.  Yum yum!

I found this recipe bland.  I used frozen mixed vegi's instead of corn.  But cooked the rest as per recipe.  My 4 year old did enjoy it...but I will not make again.

I would never have thought my kids would eat this - but they did, and a lot of it!  It doesn't LOOK real good, but it sure tastes good.  The only changes I made were these:  onion powder instead of onions (concession to the kids) and cheese on only half (to pacify the cheese-hater).

This was awesome! I made it exactly as described except I added a wee bit more potatoes and I didn't add parsley because I didn't have any and didn't feel like going to get some. It was great. The son loved it and the hubby too. Thanks!

I didn't care for this.  There were 3 of us that ate it (I customized the recipe for 4) & there were leftovers that were never eaten.  Threw away after a few days so I guess it wasn't much of a hit with the other 2 either.

This reminded me of a shephards pie I used to make years ago. I forwarned my husband that it might not taste great as it wasn't the most attractive dish I've ever made. He's not thrilled with this type of meal to begin with, but I was intrigued with the rating. He loved it!! It is yummy! I used a can of cream of mushroom soup as others had suggested. I'm sure there are a number of things you could put in here without hampering the taste. I think this would make a good dish for when the grand babes visit. Seems like something kids would like. Thanks for sharing.

WOW... this was great. I doubled the recipe and shared it with a friend. Be sure not to over cook the potatoes before putting them into the baking dish with the other ingredients. They will finish cooking in the oven. There is plenty of sauce.

I made several changes in this recipe.  Subbed sliced mushrooms for the corn, used mushroom soup and .5 cup milk for the white sauce, added 1 T. dijon mustard, didn't saute the onion in butter (to save on fat) and diced the cheese and added it to the dish before baking.  We really liked it with the above changes!  Nothing gourmet, just good comfort food!

I subbed grated white cheddar, but otherwise made as written.  While this tasted very good, I found it to be a lot of work (prep before and dishes after).

We love casseroles, so I knew just from reading this recipe we'd like it. I did make a few changes while preparing. I didn't have processed cheese food so I used grated chedder. I added appx. 4 oz. frozen corn and peas and because I put more than 2 cups ham it didn't appear creamy enough by the time I poured into the baking dish. So, I spread the top of the casserole with a can of cream of mushroom soup and I put frozen biscuits over the top of it. I baked it for appx. 30 minutes or until the biscuits were golden brown.

I make this a lot for my family--all three kids like it and it's easy!  I do a few different things, from other reviews: I use a package of cubed ham, five large potatoes, onion flakes (less onion taste for the kids), skip the parsley, and add shredded cheddar cheese right to the white sauce instead of putting processed cheese food on top.  I use a 9x13 pan.

YUM! Ok, so I cheated...a lot, if you ever read any of my other reviews, I don't usually have all of the ingredients.  I used instant mashed potatoes (herb and garlic i think) and didn't have any fresh parsley or butter (used olive oil).  BUT this turned out GREAT!  Would have been good too, to add some more milk or chicken broth and eat like a soup.  Thanks for the great recipe, can' wait to make it again!

The first time I made this recipe it was kind of bland.  But the next time I made it, I took the advice of others and used a creamed soup to the sauce and added other veggies etc. to it. Plus I added some hot sauce to it to give the flavor a boost.  All in all, with a little tweaking, its a very good dish.

This was soooo good. Even better leftover. Was looking for a recipe to use up Christmas ham, and this was perfect. I have to say, I think I messed up on the white sauce step, because my sauce was too thick and clumpy, so I had to add more milk, which when baked, made the casserole runny. Nevertheless, Husband gave it 4 stars, and I give it 5 because I'm eating the leftovers for lunch right now, and it's so good! Next time, I may add some additional seasoning such as garlic and extra pepper as others have suggested.

This is good comfort food!  The only change I made was to substitute sharp cheddar cheese for the processed cheese food, and it tasted great.  It is also good with leftover corn cut off the cob instead of canned corn.

This was better than I expected - not a gourmet meal, but a good way to use leftovers - my husband really enjoyed it, I thought it was not bad.  We did eat it two nights in a row, it was better the next day.  I would make again - I modified it a bit according to what I had, so next time I'll follow the recipe more closely.

This really is a pleasing meal. I doubled the recipe and my whole family enjoyed it. The only things that I did different was to definately add more salt and pepper. But I also added cheese to the milk mixture and more cheese on top. But definately a keeper!! Thanks so much!!

This was OK, but it needs something.  A bit bland for my taste.  Has potential, will try again with some extra seasonings, perhaps mexican process cheese would help??

This was actually surprisingly good.  It didn't sound all that appetizing but I have plenty of ham leftover and am trying to use it up.  This did the trick well. I used red potatoes and think that next time I would maybe try adding broccoli also or instead of the corn.  The sauce was a little bland but all of it was eaten up!  And there were no leftovers of my leftover ham!

I liked this, but my husband and kids did not.  I think it might have too much parsley.
