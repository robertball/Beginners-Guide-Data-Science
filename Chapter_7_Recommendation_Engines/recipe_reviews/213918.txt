These were very good! I used 1.3lbs ground sirloin, no peppers, flour tacos and a can (12oz) of red enchilada sauce over the top. A nice change for ground beef from hamburgers and meatloaf! UPDATE: Started adding salsa to the meat for extra flavor.

This was a crowd pleaser for all of the family, even my picky eaters.  I used mild store-bought picante sauce, but I think next time I will use something with a little more flavor.  I was skeptical about using turkey, but it was fantastic!  Texture turned out great.  I added fresh cilantro to top with as well and that added a ton of flavor!  This is a great basic recipe that I will definitely make again and again and add to over time.

I subbed a few things like fajita seasoning for taco seasoning, and added 3 tbs. salsa to the meat mixture, and I topped with a jarred enchilada sauce before putting in the oven. Other than that, I stayed pretty true to the given recipe and we really loved it. My first enchiladas and it's going into my regular rotation! Thanks for the recipe!

Very good! I wanted to introduce my son to enchiladas (per his request), but I wanted something that the flavors would be familiar to him. He LOVES tacos, so I knew that this would be perfect, and it was. I did use a bit less of the red peppers b/c 1-1/2 cups seemed like a lot to me. I rolled the taco mixture into the tortillas earlier in the day, and refrigersted them until I was ready to finish and bake them. I topped them w/ all the topping, loosley covered it w/ foil and baked. I also added some green onion to the top, which was nice. My little guy thought these were great, and so did we. I will def make these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was any easy recipe to make and quick as well.  My husband enjoyed it very much and it even reheated well for lunch the next day. I did add mozzarella and extra cheddar in the finally steps, simply because I like cheese. I will be making this regularly.

Mentioning something about the use of corn tortillas. Like, what to avoid when they break if you roll them. What did you do to avoid that? Would have been a great help. Otherwise great recipe.

This turned out really good. My kids loved it. I diced some of the bell peppers and onions and put that in with the chopped ones for some additional flavor. My girls also wanted to add beans inside of the enchiladas, which was a good touch. I think next time I might use a little bit spicier salsa and maybe a little more seasonings, but overall, it is very good, and easy to make. Thank you.

Taste overall was delightful,  but the meat mixture was dry.  Will  most definitely make again but with a  few tweets. I used 1 1/2 lbs  meat and yielded 16  enchiladas.  Thx for sharing.

This was easy to make. I used some beef chorizo along with my hamburger meat once cooked I drained then added added a small diced onion.  I took some warmed refried beans and put a small layer on each of my tortilla 's. Then added meat mixture ounces seasoned.  I also added a little cheese to each of my enchiladas. I used enchilada sauce on the bottom of my dish and topped them also with extra meat and sauce and lots of cheese!

Made these for supper today. I used enchilada sauce on top (my kids don't like salsa so good). Added some cheddar on top with other cheese. They were awesome. My husband who really doesn't like Mexican so good, ate three. No leftovers. Served with Spanish rice. Quick and delicious. The way I like it!  Thanks for this recipe. Will definitely make again!

This was very good. I only got 6 instead of 8 out of the recipe. It was really nice for a quick dinner with a side of rice and vegetables.
