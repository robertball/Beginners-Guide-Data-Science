This was good and easy but very bland so I did a few things diffrently.  I added lots of fresh garlic and salt pepper and a bay leaf.  While the soup part was cooking I added the bone from the ham, to add flavor.  My girls ate it with parm cheese on it and really liked it.

Simple preparation - one pot and a nice change from all of the ham casseroles with cheese and cream soups in them.  My son is allergic to dairy so this was perfect for him.  And, he ate the vegetables (I added carrots, too) - tender but not soggy.  Next time, I think I'll substitute broth from the ham for some of the water to add more flavor.  I'll definitely make this again!

Excellent recipe for leftover ham.  My son and husband loved it and it was easy to make.  A nice change for leftover ham.

very average looking recipe so i added; which I think is the charm of this recipe. you can add what you feel and really it only helps. So, mine ended up a bit from the original recipe.  I added 2 cans of chicken broth, carrots, and a good amount of a herbed spice blend. very nice, and very good after heating the second time around

Basic recipe that needed help. I added some salt-free "zesty" blend, 8oz tomato sauce and 15oz drained diced tomatoes.

We did not like this at all.  Bland.  Needed some kind of sauce.  My husband said the meal was better as left overs than orignally, which is not a good sign!

Easy to make, but comes out so bland it's barely edible. You'll definitely want to plan to add some sort of sauce to this.

There was nothing to this pasta to give it any flavor.  I added a jar of pasta sauce with mushrooms to give it some flavor.  Ended up pretty good.

Good idea.. Just needs more flavor. I used more ham and I also used Garlic powder. I think it would taste better with broth from the Ham.

Sorry, just 3 stars.  Good for quickness.  I dressed it up (as have others) with some chicken stock, bay leaf, a bit more ham, and then I added some leftover Penne noodles that were in the cupboard along with the egg noodles.  Although the young men in the crowd did have 3 helpings.  But 3 stars is best I can do.

I used about a half cup of diced ham in this, cooked it according to the recipe, and OMG it is delicious! Very innovative too.

I put in more ham, sliced into bite sized pieces because I had it.  I also read that it was bland so I seasoned it a bit more with some garlic salt and such.  After the noodles cooked down and there wasnt much water left, I put it in the oven (lid on) at 180 to hold till we were ready to eat it.  I added a bit of butter and stirred it up before plating, and sprnkled some parm on and it was a good sit in front of the tv with some bread and butter meal.

This soup is easy to make however I subbed chicken broth for the water, used green onions, added the celery to the hot bowl for a nice crunch and used fall themed pasta for the egg noodles. This is definitely a keeper for the winter months.

Not a favorite.  I added plenty of spices, fresh herbs, even some white table wine and this soup was still really bland.  My always-hungry teenage son wouldn't touch the leftovers. I might make it again and substitute roasted chicken for the ham.

Used a quarter ham & let it sit in the crockpot with everything but the noodles for the day (6hrs).  Added the noodles about 15 before & everyone loved this!
