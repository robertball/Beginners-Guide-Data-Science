My family, coworkers and friends ask for this dish at almost every potluck or holiday event. PS: I always use yellow(brown) onions as they are sweeter, never white or red. ----  Update I love seeing how everyone is finding ways to make it that suits their families and pantry, how creative. Bon app√©tit!

This Onion Tart turned out great! It was very smooth and contrary to some other reviewers, was not too oniony. I only used 4 white onions, used regular pie crusts (not deep dish), and had enough batter for almost 2 tarts. I would suggest trying 1 deep dish pie crust and hopefully everything will fit in it.   Also, I made one batch with the bacon, one without. It turned out much better without the bacon. Based on my research, bacon is not used in many other traditional onion tart recipes.  Lastly, I did not have nutmeg so I used McCormick's Allspice. This addition really made the difference and would suggest using it.

This is amazing. It's a little much for a weekday dinner but I can't wait to make it for friends! I used a HUGE Vidalia onion and 3 little yellow onions, and next time it will be all Vidalias; they add the best flavor. I loved the addition of the nutmeg, it really gives it a special something. Thanks for a super recipe!

Great guideline recipe... I used 4 medium vidalias, 1 cup of half & half, generous amounts of salt, pepper, a splash of aged balsamic and a bit (like 2 teaspoons) of brown sugar, nutmeg as recommended, and thinly sliced bits of 1 precooked sausage. It generously filled 1 deep dish crust. This dish was delicious-- savory and sweet at the same time and very moist and filling.  Thank you Nadine

We just finished eating this for supper with corn on the cob, it was super good! I didn't use bacon because we didn't have any. Funny thing is that without even saying anything, my husband said it would have been even better if I put some bacon in... So note to self: make sure to add the bacon :)

Had this in France ~16 years ago.  I didn't like onions then... I had a second helping.
I wanted to introduce my wife to it (now that I've come to my senses on onions).  This seems to be the closest recipe to what I recall.  Was easy to cook and quite tasty.

This was amazing.   My super picky 12 year old daughter loved it and even my 2 year old ate a piece.  I don't think I could fit 5 onions in one pie shell though since Idaho has some really big onions so I made 2 pies instead.  It keeps really well in the fridge for about a week if you have any left overs.  Overall, this is just an amazing recipe and I can't wait to make it for company.

We liked this, but each one of us thought something about it could be improved!  One didn't care for the bacon with the onions, one thought it needed more herbs to flavor it, one thought we should use fewer onions, etc! I put this into a whole wheat pie crust, and I used soy milk instead of milk and cream.  This might be great for a brunch!

I see I'm the only one whose tart came out a bit too watery.  I think I used onions that were too large, and next time, I would saute them longer - perhaps caramelize them.  It did taste great, though!  Good with steaks!

First of all, let me say that this onion pie is absolutely delicious.  I made modifications because, after reading all the reviews and scrutinizing the recipe myself, I didn't think all of the filling would fit into one regular 9" pie crust.  I used only 6 slices of bacon, 4 medium-size Vidalia onions, 3/4 cup of half and half and 3 jumbo eggs.  Upon the suggestion of "reciprocipe," I added lt. brown sugar and balsamic vinegar to the filling.  I also decided to place a lattice crust on top to use up some dough scraps I had.  I egg washed the strips and sprinkled them with a little coarse salt.  The pie baked for a full 35 minutes before it was set and browned to my liking.  I will be making this again.

I made this without the bacon. Instead, I had eye of round steaks sliced very thin I barely browned and put in the crust before I put anything else in. I loved it, my husband and granddaughter didn't. It was excellent the next day to me.

Be sure to use the regular pie crusts. Not the deep ones. I found it set faster while cooking also the recipe made two tarts this way. The addition of balsamic was pure magic. I also crumbled the bacon which helped permeate the entire tart without a lot of chewing. I will definitely make this again!!

Everyone was hesitant and didn't think they would like this when I told them I was making it for Christmas Eve dinner.  They were all surprised by how good it was and what a great taste it had!  Thanks so much for the recipe, it was nice to try something different and for it to turn out well!

Excellent, easy recreation of my favorite patisserie lunch when I was a broke student in Paris.  Pre-made crust was fine but homemade croissant pastry crust baked in individual mini quiche pans...SUPERB!

My dad asks for this every year around the holidays. I find it is easier to make two but I don't double the milk and cream, it is only a 30% increase, but doubling the flour is important as well as the increased cooking time. Additionally I sprinkle nutmeg in the bottom of the crusts, don't pre bake the crusts, cover the crust edges with foil for 75% of the cook time and add bacon crumbs on top at the end after cooking.

Love this recipe! I follow it nearly exactly expect for not adding bacon and sometimes using milk instead of cream.

Delicious Tarte a l'Oignon!  Used about five carmelized onions, 2 eggs+3 egg yolks (used the whites for chocolate pavlova!), a shot of balsamic vinegar, 1t Nature's Seasoning Salt and a tad bit more milk than double cream.  Left off the pepper and bacon (like others did), sprinkled with fresh chives and baked til golden brown.  Restaurant quality!

This was delicious!  The only change I made was that I used 2 vidalia onions and 1 large regular onion and it was the perfect amount. It's a keeper!

Very, very tasty!! I substituted pre-baked tart shells, skipped the nutmeg (didn't have any) and used 1 c. of half and half instead of the milk and heavy cream. Thank you for your delicious recipe.

I made the tarte as written, but used 4 onions, as a couple were rather large.  I found that it didn't solidify and wasn't seasoned enough, but otherwise was delicious.  I may try it again with another egg and add some more nutmeg, salt and pepper.
