This was really good, but I liked it better hot than cold.  I spread it on english muffin halves, baked them at 350 for about 15 minutes and cut into quarters.  Everyone, even the "artichoke haters", loved them.  Now I make them up ahead, cut them, and freeze them to pull out anytime.

This was a pretty good recipe but it was a bit too salty.  I would recommend slowly adding salt to your desired taste instead of just following the recipe.  I will definitely try this one again.

My husband declared this recipe, "the best dip ever."  This is a rousing endorsement from a man who proclaims to not like artichokes.  It was a hit with the rest of my family as well.  I highly recommend it.

This was really good.  I did what many reviewers suggested:  used a clove of fresh garlic instead of powder and cut back on the amounts of the salty ingredients.  I also upped the amount of artichoke hearts to 14 oz to make it chunkier (and because that is the size can I had, lol).  The idea of the recipe and the combo of ingredients are perfect, the spicyness really sets it apart from other artichoke dips.  I served it for dipping with Chip Chicken Lollipops from this site.

I think next time I will only use a 1/4 teaspoon of seasoning salt.  I will also eliminate the use of soy sauce (which has a lot of salt).  Otherwise, the dip was very good.

First off, this is an odd looking dip and everyone who ate it first asked me what it was.  But once they tried it they really liked it.  It is a very rich dip and has a lot of good flavor to it.  I served it with hearty wheat crackers, good with wine.

This is yummy dip!  I used marinated artichokes because they have better flavor and I chopped them up.  It's a good thing I tasted the dip before adding the seasonings because it really did not need much salt.  I ended up using 1/2 t seasoned salt, no soy sauce, the full amount of hot sauce (Frank's Red Hot Sauce), and 1/2 t garlic powder.  We like things salty and garlicky, but I know the salt would have been overpowering and I think the full amount of garlic powder would have been too.  We're quite pleased with how the dip turned out with those changes though!  It's great cold or heated in the microwave.  Next time I'm going to try adding 1/2 package of frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry because when the dip is hot, it's pretty thin.  Plus we just love spinach artichoke dip.  Thanks so much!

This was edible but I probably will not make it again, I would suggest putting it through a food processor to be a dip.

This was delicous Rob! I placed the artichokes in my food processor to make it more of a dip. Yum and thanks!

I made this in a blender for a smooth dip for veggies, and all I could taste was soy sauce. I will omit that next time, and maybe use jarred hearts instead of canned, and fresh garlic to give the flavour more depth. I liked the heat and the texture :)

I made this exactly according to the recipe and liked this but hubby commented on the saltiness. I like the flavor of soy sauce but it did seem a bit overpowering for the delectable artichokes which are pretty pricey to disguise like that. We did finish it all and it was less salty the next day. I also have to go easy on garlic with him and I was afraid he would comment on the garlic too. Leaves a strong after taste so beware. Ate this on Club crakers. Probably won't make again but I will think about the soy sauce, garlic, mayo base as a possibility for other things.

I made this recently for my bunco group-the bowl was licked clean-it's delicious and tastes better if it sits in the fridge for a while so the flavors have a chance to blend.

I have made this for Christmas going on 3 years in a row, now. A cold artichoke dip seemed questionable, with being used to all the hot, appetizer style dips in restaurants, but this was amazing! Two things I love are garlic, and hot sauce. With that being said, I have not strayed from using fresh garlic cloves, and upping the amount of hot sauce. If set in the fridge for several hours, these flavors really intensify, so take that into account. Awesome recipe.

Very tasty dip but too many veggies for Elvis. Not too salty. Texture a little coarse. 2-4 oz cream cheese would make it perfect, as for almost all other recipes.

My family loves this dip! I use low sodium soy sauce always. I converted this to glueten free using veggie mayo and gluten free cheese from my local health food store, for a friend who loved the dip and missed it with new dietary restrictions. It translated beautifully.
