I used fresh roma tomatoes and it turned out fabulously.  I may cut the vinegar down the next time though.

This recipe is Fantastic!!!! Made this for Memorial Day picnic, everyone was impressed. Got ate up real quick. Passed the recipe to everyone there.   Only change I made was to Blend in the Blender,to make it less chunky. I am making a double batch, right now. Cannot give a more higher rating then 10.

Left out the tomato paste, sugar and salt, and used only 1/2 of the vinegar based on another reviewer's comment, and only 1/2 of one jalape√±o (3/4 cup sounds like fire ) -- didn't want it too hot.
