This was a very nice rub.  I used about a Tbsp. of minced garlic from the jar, didn't use any chili powder,used cracked black pepper, kosher salt, and added 1/2 tsp. of dried rosemary as it pairs well with thyme.  The cayenne gave it a nice kick.  I rubbed two nice sized tenderloins with olive oil and then rubbed in the seasoning mixture, coating the entire steak.  I let the steaks come to room temperature before grilling - this will ensure a tender steak.  Next time I will melt some bleu cheese on top.

What a fantastic recipe, thank you for sharing.  Made this tonight for my husband and I and didn't change a thing...it came out perfect.  The steaks were tender, juicy and very flavorful...absolutely loved it!  I broiled them since my grill is currently burried under 3 feet of snow but can't wait until I can try this on the grill in the summer!  This is my new favorite recipe!  Thanks again!

We liked this one.  I agree with SSTROH - with all the 'earthy' herbs and spices a little more salt would be nice.  I marinated good-sized steak bites for 2 days.

Excellent steak recipe for those who like it spicy like me!  For those who aren’t tuned in into spicy foods, I recommend that you simply not include chilli powder in the mix.  Other than that, I followed the instructions and added the right amounts for each ingredient and it turned out great!  I accompanied this spicy steak dish with steamed broccoli covered in a three-cheese sauce, mashed potatoes with fried mushroom, bacon and onion and a bottle of Malbec wine.  Wow!  Great combination!

This was a simple and easy to make rub and tasted fantastic!  Didn't change a thing.  Placed red, orange and yellow sweet peppers and a onion around the sides and baked at 350 and it looked and tasted fabulous!  Everyone loved it and it was very attractive too.  Had boiled red potatoes and corn on the side with garlic bread.  Wonderful meal.

I thought this recipe was overall good.  I had made this last night, but next time I will try without the chili powder.  It had too much kick for my taste.  I do like spicy food, but I was looking for more of a garlic pepper taste.

I omitted the chili powder, since I don't have any on hand.  I usually love hot or spicey or peppery things - but I felt like this was just spicey or peppery enough that I didn't enjoy every bite as much as I should have.  I'll try this recipe again, but will cut the paprika and pepper.

My husband isn't a big fan of putting anything on his steak but salt and pepper, maybe some garlic, However I talked him into trying this rub on our T-bone steaks. The only thing I changed was substituting the cayenne pepper with chipotle powder for more of a smoky flavor.  A nice flavored crust that didn't overwhelm the great tender juicy steak inside, we were both happy.

Not bad.  I think it would have been a little better with a bit more salt, but overall it had great flavor.

My family really enjoyed it.  I put in just a bit of the chili powder to take the bite out of it, and the flavor was fabulous.  I broiled it, and plan to grill it next time

VERY good! I was a taken by surprise that Garlic-Pepper steaks did not include *black* pepper, but I quickly got over it after I added black pepper. Thanks for the recipe, excellent. :)

A keeper for sure!! We REALLY Like this one!! It was a "tiny" bit spicy for our taste, but let me say it didn't stop us a bit from gobbling it up! Still gets 5 stars & I will just cut back the spiciness (is that a word??) next time!! Thanks for sharing!!

I made half of the rub mixture for two large beef tenderloin steaks and had plenty to cover all sides.  I wasn’t sure if the submitter meant fresh garlic or dried, so I opted for dried and used 1/2 t. of garlic powder.  I was concerned that fresh might burn while searing the steaks on the grill and turn bitter.  We take our steaks off the grill at 135 degrees and let them rest for 5-10 minutes.  We get a perfect medium-rare every time.  This was very flavorful and the seasonings did not overpower the flavor of the meat.  We enjoyed this and would definitely do it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband loves this steak.  It's VERY spice, a little too much so for me, but if you like spicy, it's good.

Wow! We really liked this rub.  I followed the published recipe but broiled my steak instead of grilling.  A keeper for sure.
