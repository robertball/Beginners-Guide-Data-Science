did not make any changes and won't make it again.  I chose to use almond butter and used other ingredients as listed in recipe.  It was messy to make, looked like - tasted like - and had the texture of sludge.

I made this for a party and while it tasted okay it wasn't the most amazing dip I've ever made. I used sunflower butter and it really overpowered the other flavors so all you could taste was the cocoa powder and sunflower butter. But! No one could tell it was made with beans! And when served with graham crackers it helped balance out the flavors and people seemed to like it at the party. So maybe if the amount of sunflower butter was reduced it would taste better but I don't think I'll be making this again.

Absolutely delicious!! My husband hates beans and never knew they were in this recipe. I used peanut butter instead of almond butter and next time I would reduce the peanut butter to 1/4 cup.  The peanut butter overpowered the dip. Other than that I followed the recipe to a T. Everyone loved it including the kids (11 kids under 8), I served it with animal crackers and apple slices. Definitely will be making this again thank you Allstars!!

Made it this week. Everyone in my house loved it. Even my 2 & 4 year old. Definitely making this again. The only thing I changed was I used peanut butter instead of almond butter since it is what I had on hand.

We loved it and it was well-received by adults & kids at a Labor Day cookout (with strawberries). I used peanut butter & chocolate almond milk bc that's what I had but I'm sure any combo would be delicious. Thank you for sharing!

I loved this recipe!  It's chocolaty but not too sweet.  I also served it with pretzels.
