About as good as it gets. The taste is spectacular, they're filling, they're cheap to make, and they're really healthy for you.  

The first time I made exactly according the the recipe.  Second time around added about a quarter cup of Parmesan cheese and used corn right off the cob that I had roasted first.  Even better.

Highly recommended recipe.

I used chopped onions instead of chives, and soy milk instead of cow's milk.  Great tasting breakfast instead of pancakes!

I made this on a whim after trying to figure out what to do with a ton of brown rice I had. They were delicious! I didn't have chives, so I used chopped onion as the other reviewer suggested. I also didn't have nutmeg, so I subbed with 1/8 tsp of chili powder and paprika. They were really, really tasty! My kids ate theirs with a little ketchup and went back for seconds. This one is definitely a keeper.

As the poster of this recipe, I agree with some of the comments about improving the recipe. I wrote it to be simple, easy to prepare and use ingredients that are generally available in the pantry. For guests I use fresh corn off the cob and wild rice. I also sprinkle a pinch of salt on the fried cakes -- it helps to bring out the flavor. I'm happy some have enjoyed the recipe!

Rather bland, I liked the over all taste but I might experiment with some spices later on. I used frozen corn, that is what we had, and soymilk.

I changed this recipe up by adding a little honey (a few table spoons) to the mix and served the cakes with pure maple syrup.  Instead of olive oil, I used Pam no-calorie, no fat, non-stick spray and omitted the chives.  The cakes were excellent and very well received by my family.

I was really looking forward to these, but we all found them fairly bland. I wish I had used fresh off the cob corn, as I think that would have added flavor.

I was looking for creative and healthy ways to use brown rice, and this is a winner! My family loves corn. They are super easy to make. I am keeping this recipe!

I actually use it for a snack. My family loves to grab one cold from the frig and much on it while doing homework or watching TV.

This was good! It needed a little something extra though, it was a bit dry as is. My husband mixed up a topping of sour cream, mayo, chili powder, garlic etc (kind of elote-esque to go with the corn?) and with just a smear of that it was perfect.
