This is great!  I double the recipe and made 24 little quiches in my muffin pan.  I used broccoli, onion, ham and cheddar.  Like most recipes, you can use just about any combo you want.  I also used multi-grain baking mix and cut the oil in half, based on other reviews.  I will use this recipe again - I love having the little quiches for a quick breakfast and an easy way to sneak some veggies into my son's breakfast!

my family never missed the crust.  I have made this using different ingredients.  Our favorite is using fried chopped bacon and raw onions.  I have even substituted pancake mix (Aunt J) and it was great.

I've made this dish many times.  It tastes good and it's easy to make.  My only complaint is that there's too much liquid.  I cut the liquid down to cup and added 20 minutes to cook time.

I have made this dish time again.  I have tried it with feta, spinach, sundried tomato, and mushroom; and with a meat subsitute - Morningstar Farms Veggie Crumbles - combined with fresh veggies.  It is very fast and very easy.  I recommend it highly.  It makes for a very fast, light, and casual supper.

Not bad, nothing exciting.  The flavor was good but this was about the same as any other quiche or egg dish.  Used more eggs for my large pie dish, and 1 cup of milk (less liquid) and cooked 10 minutes longer, came out solid and perfectly browned.

Bisquick has a recipe similar to this that I have always made and this is much better. This recipe has more egg, more milk and the the addition of oil, which is key.  For the reviewers who said it was too oily, maybe they didnt blend it in the blender and bake it right away (allowing the oil to seperate...) mine was perfect and the addition of the oil made the edges just the slightest bit crispy. Excellent! Also, I used broccoli in place of zucchini and 1/2 C fresh chopped onion in place of the dried minced. This is my new "go-to" quiche recipe. Note: I had to bake it about 10 extra minutes because I used quite a bit more chicken and veges than the recipe called for.

I liked how easy the egg part came together. I tried to just mix it real fast, but you really need to blend the mixture to get all the lumps out. So I dirtied an extra dish, haha. I'm only giving this four stars because I could taste a baking-mix-y flavor in the finished product. It would not stop me from making this again, but for company or something I'd go with a more traditional quiche. Thanks for sharing.

I used seasoned ground chicken and cooked the fresh zucchini w/ the chicken in a skillet. I forgot to put in the parsley. My ten year old daughter picked thru this. My husband and I thought it was ok. Even though I always add extra seasonings to everything I cook, this still seemed a little bland, but it had good texture. I thought it was better cold the next morning. Thanks for the recipe.

Nobody liked this in my entire family. Bland, zucchini had weird flavor. It was not running though. Cooked nicely, just did not taste good at all.

I just wasn't a fan.  More like an egg casserole than a quiche.  Easy but so is real quiche.

This recipe was great!  Very quick, and very tasty.  I used thin sliced ham, spinach, and chedarella.  I used dried parsley, and I also added dill and garlic, since I like my meals a little spicier.  This quiche also reheated really well in the microwave!

Great Quiche, Quick and VERY easy.  End result was a little runny, but it might just need to be cooked a tiny bit longer.  Very very tasty! I left out the parsley and onions and added a little extra garlic powder..yum!

I have made this dish many years ago from the recipe on the Bisquick box . No need for the oil.   So easy using the blender I line the dish with  cheese and frozen California vegtables, then pour the mix over.  Easy!

This is a great recipe to use leftovers; I added more veggies and excluded any meat. The texture was creamy. I think I'll use salsa as an optional topping next time.
