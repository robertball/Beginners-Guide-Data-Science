Would like to try this, but have to ask what maybe a dumb question. Do I make the strawberry gelatin or just stir in the crystals? 2 questions - do I halve the grapes? I'm cooking challenged!

This is a "night before" recipe. If it is not chilled overnight, the dessert will not have a fluffy texture. Also, be sure to FOLD the jello and fruit into the whipped topping. DO NOT STIR !!!

I made this last week - my kids didnt like it! Good! More for me & Daddy. I am making it again today. The recipe is rather large, but it only lasted two days between my husband & I. This time I will omit the mandarin oranges. Hubby says they taste bitter. (he still ate them!) I love this stuff! Its just like the stuff you can get in the supermarket deli (only better). Been looking for this recipe for a long time. Now I got my hands on it. Thank You!

I made this last night for dessert for my family and nobody liked it.  It turned out so thick like glue.  I thought mabey I did something wrong, but I've looked over the recipe time and again and can't see where I went wrong.  It's pretty bad when the kids won't eat it.

I thought this was absolutely horrible, as did everyone else in my family.  The jello did not mix into the cool whip so it just kind of "beaded" on top of the whipped topping.  It was really not edible.  To each his own I guess.

This was really good, but if you are only preparing it for a couple people, reduce the amounts becuase it serves many!

I was looking for easy recipes to make and yet very good.  This one is wonderful and really keeps it shape for a few days.  I did not have grapes so just kept them out.  It was very good anyway.  I will be making this recipe again this weekend for our family reunion.  Thank you so much for sharing it.

I made this dessert for my bf's birthday and he loved it! So did his friends who had more than one helping. I accidently only bought 8oz of cool whip so I had to cut the recipe in half...next time I make it I'll be sure to have all the ingredients. Also left out the grapes but it still tasted wonderful! Thanks for sharing!

I make a jello salad very close to this. I use strawberry banana jello (just the crystals), 1 can of fruit cocktail and 16 oz of cottage cheese. No grapes. The rest is the same. The key is letting it refridgerate long enough so the marshmellows soften.

I love this recipe.  I first made this for a school party for my grandson 5 years ago and have been making it ever since.  I always serve it for the holidays.  I know it is called a dessert salad but I serve it with the main course.  Everyone loves it - from the youngest to the oldest.

We thought this was great!  I had to make a few adjustments, based on what I had on hand.  I used 1 can of drained pineapple and 2 cans of drained mandarin oranges.  I also used SF Cranberry Jell-o.  I didn't have the time to let it sit overnight, as recommended, before I had to serve it....but the reviewers are right...it is good the first day, but MUCH fluffier the 2nd.  My husband LOVED it and it tasted just great!

This is okay.  It's easy and quick, but I wasn't that pleased with it.  I'm not sure why, though . . .maybe it's just a texture thing.  Bf liked it well enough to eat most of it himself over the course of several days, but I was the one setting it in front of him.  He didn't get it out himself.  I think I'm going to stick with making jello out of our many boxes of jello.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe just wasnt for me. I guess I'm not a fan of fruit cocktail, the best part of this dish was the crisp grapes. I will try again and next time use fresh fruits.

I made this as a quick side for dinner to please the kids. I only used about one cup of halved grapes and I added in one large chopped banana and 1 cup chopped fresh strawberries. HUGE hit with the kids--they loved it. (And really, so did us adults!)

Flavor was great but it didn't set well. It was a little runny and grainy because the gelatin did not mix well with the whipped topping. I was hoping for light and fluffy.

I did not have any fruit cocktail, so I put pineapple tidbits in place.
