This was delicious!  No more Kozy Shack for my hubby's lunch...here's my few modifications...1 and 3/4 cup cold cooked Jasmine rice and I kept everything else the same.  One thing I did that may help you..I mixed together the remaining 1/2 cup milk, the sugar and the egg together in a pourable mixing bowl.  When the timing was right, I stirred the pudding with my right hand while slowly pouring the egg/milk/sugar mixture into the pudding with my left hand.  I had no trouble with cooked egg pieces.  Also, it only took about 10 minutes for the rice to get thick - don't cook it too long or it won't be creamy.  I grated fresh nutmeg and cinnamon on top.  Very good!

Substitute the regular milk for Condensed Milk, and this recipe will come out deliciously creamy.

I have a more creamy less rice pudding. Cooked it slower and stirred constantly adding milk until it reached a thick, creamy consistency. Rice being a grain gets its best flavor from salt. I add a little at a time throughout the cooking until it is no longer bland as one cook mentioned. Sweet and salt is the best. No matter how much milk you add it can be cooked down to give you a very creamy product. Make sure you temper the egg by adding a bit of the hot mixture in the beaten egg until it comes closer to the hot pudding and whisk in a little at a time. Done this way, you will not end up with soup, but will spend more time cooking.  Be patient.

OMG  this was so good. I used half and half and put in cranberries because I didn't have raisins. So yummy. Will definitely add this to my day to day recipe box.

This recipe was pretty good but it was missing a key ingredient for sure: cinnamon! I also didn't use the butter and added a little more sugar. This is a wonderful breakfast especially around the holidays!

I just made this, & the way I made it  it came out great.  Many of the reviewers commented that theirs came out on the runny side, so bearing that in mind I just used 1 C milk, & I had 2 2/3 cups of rice to start out w/.  I didn't alter the other ingredients, just the milk & in ratio to the amount of rice I had to use.  I was very pleased with the subsequent results, it tastes just like my regular rice pudding recipe, which is concocted over a double boiler.  Will definitely make this again when I have leftover rice, which is actually pretty often.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good - It reminds me of my mom's rice pudding - she could never give me her exact recipe. It does seem to be missing something - could be creamier? Yet  - I've made this several times and am happy with how it turns out. Be careful when adding egg to the hot rice mixture -you need to temper the egg by adding a little bit of the hot liquid to the egg (and milk and sugar) and stir - and add more hot rice mixture and stir then add egg mixture to the rest of the rice and mix. This gently heats up the egg so you don't end up with scrambled egg in your rice pudding.

Super easy, and quite good. I added cinnamon, omitted rasins and rather than vanilla extract, I split and scraped a half vanilla bean into the mixture. I cooked it. I did not use milk and sugar, rather, I used sweetened condensed. Substituted half and half for the milk to be beaten with the egg. Oh, and i guess i forgot to put salt!  I guess I didn't really follow this recipe! I just used it as more of a guideline! How can one go wrong with all these carbs and sugar? It tastes great.

This is, in my opinion, a perfect rice pudding. I made it with 2% milk and basmati rice(the only rice I had in the house) and it turned out creamy and delicious. One tip: I would mix the beaten egg, sugar, and last 1/2 C. of milk together before gradually  adding to the rice mixture off burner. I used cranberries instead of raisins because I prefer them.

This is tasty for a quick rice pudding. I couldn't get mine to thicken up very well so I sprinkled in some instant vanilla pudding. Without it the pudding was very soupy. Good flavor. Sprinkled with cinnamon and topped with whipped cream. Yum.

I have made this rice pudding MANY times!  The only thing I do differently, is omit the raisins, temper the eggs, and use more vanilla and sugar.  Sometimes after the pudding has set, I whip some heavy cream and fold it in.  Heaven in a bowl!

I tend to have left over rice after dinner. I plan to eat it for lunch but never get around to it. I saw this recipe and decided to give it a try. It's easy to make and tastes delicious! I omitted the raisins and added a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg and ate it warm. This may give me an excuse to make a little bit more rice because of this recipe. Yummy! Thanks!

First time making rice pudding but everyone loved it.  Lots of changes to it but thankful for the instructions on the procedure.  I used more eggs (we have chickens and to many eggs) brown sugar instead of white, nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, ginger (tiny bit), more vanilla, and almond extract, raisins and craisins, and a bit of tapioca just to see.  It came out great I've now made it 2x first time I tripled it 2nd time 5x we'll see how it freezes for lunches.  Thanks a bunch!

I followed the directions exactly, but it is more like soup than pudding. A sad waste of ingredients.

I loved this, I had leftover rice and really wanted something sweet. I've never tried rice pudding before but thought I'd give it a try and I'm glad I did. This recipe is good and is simple to make.

This is exactly what I was looking for, a recipe using cooked leftover rice, and something that didn't take long to make. I added cinnamon, a must for me in rice pudding. Sometimes I add a little nutmeg too. I used regular raisins because that's what I had on hand. Delicious!

I had some leftover rice and decided I would like to make rice pudding.  I went on line and it seemed as if all the recipes were using uncooked rice.  Then I found this recipe which uses cooked rice.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using half and half instead of milk.  The final product tasted very good, after all what recipe with milk, eggs and sugar doesn't taste good?  But like several of the other reviews mine never thickened up and was very runny, more like soup.

AWESOME!!! I love rice pudding but I hate all the work with the other recipes.  I made by the recipe except I added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and omitted the raisins. Great use of leftover rice.  I thought mine was going to be soupy but I let is simmer on low while I finished dinner and by the time we ate, it was so creamy and delicious.  Will definitely be making this again.

Instead of an egg, I used 2tbsp cornstarch with 3tbsp water and added it with the sugar, rest of the milk, and raisins. And secondly, instead of raisins I used chopped dates.

Fantastic did everything as stated besides skipped raisons and butter. Cooked for like 10-12 minutes then added last bit of milk, egg, and sugar i had mixed together in a wet measuring cup. Then whisked that into the already cooking ingredients. Egg set in 5ish minutes. I just kept stirring and cooking until pudding consistancy and then took off heat and it thickened more. Tasted just like my dad's.

This came out delicious.  I made a double recipe since the way my son loves homemade desserts, 4 servings would be gone too soon.
It didn't come out runny, just nice and moist.  I cooked it long enough to thicken it up, also used whole milk.  I did add some cinnamon and nutmeg, this is a wonderful dessert that is not too sweet.  As with most things, I know it will thicken up more once you refrigerate the left overs.

The recipe is a great starter and you can add whatever you like. I added 1 c coconut milk and 1 c whole milk with 2 c cooked rice. I did not use the butter but did add cinnamon. Everyone loves it and I will make it again.

By far the best rice pudding I've had in a long time and easy to make.  Left out the raisins and added cinamon.

Seems like a lot of people stray from the recipe, get adverse results and give low ratings.  I stuck with the recipe exactly, except I did double it because of the amount of rice I had.  It turned out exactly like it says.  A rich and creamy rice pudding.  It has the perfect thickness and sweetness, and I LOVE the fact that it doesn't call for cinnamon or baking.   Maybe people are using minute rice?  I don't know, mine was absolutely delicious.

I must admit that I approximated the milk and amount of rice, adding a bit more rice than the recipe. I also did not have golden raisins, so I used regular ones. But everyone who ate it loved it. I know it worked when I went to the fridge and it was all gone.

I chose the recipe because of the ease and limited ingredients. It was easy and good, which is two wins for me.

Although I subbed soy milk and coconut oil for milk and butter, I'm sure this recipe would also be delicious as-is. Not overly sweet, not too plain once it's studded with raisins - this one is a winner. Next time I'll try browning the butter (my mom's trick) to add a new level of flavor.

I used with almond milk since the only other milk I had was 1/2%.  I also put in cranberries since I had no raisins.  The taste and consistency was good.  I was worried about it being too thin like the other reviewers, but I just let the pudding sit for a bit to thicken up more.  My son kept wanting more and more...

Rice soup. Followed the recipe precisely. Nothing like pudding. Saved the meal by adding another egg and baking it in the oven. I would not try this again.

This recipe was supremely simple. I did add some cinnamon for more flavor and made it with unsweetened almond milk to reduce calories and the dairy component. It is great for those who want to avoid dairy products!

Added 1/2 cup more milk initially as my rice was quite dry (al dante). Left out raisins as the kids hate them.  Added a bit more vanilla at the end. Really tasty!

I make this often after I make supper and have left over rice. Never change anything until the one time I start it and realize I have no eggs (and it’s 10:30pm). To keep it thicker I did not add the last 1/2 cup of milk and a bit more raisins to soak up extra milk. Tasted the same and still was creamy and thick like pudding.

Very tasty, thick and fluffy. Followed recipe with the following exceptions: Omitted raisins. Mixed the remaining milk, sugar and egg together in a pourable measuring cup/bowl. Tempered the milk/egg/sugar mixture before adding it slowly to pot. Added nutmeg and cinnamon.

I just made this recipe for the first time, usually I use uncooked  rice and bake it, but I had enough cooked rice to double the recipe.
I followed the recipe, used fat free milk,  which is what we have. I patiently stirred and slowly cooked the rice for  the 2 min and it was truly thick and very creamy! I knew that if I added eggs as is the recipe would have to be named scrambled egg pudding!*! So I tempered them by adding about 1/2 or so of the cooking pudding into the eggs while whisking them and then poured the egg mixture into the pot while stirring  quickly in order to incorporate  the ingredients  together. I cooked the mixture until everything was perfectly  creamy again, and added double the vanilla  and about 1 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon so that it tastes like heaven to me and my family.  
Easy enough anyone  can make this!!

Here's how I modified this and it turned out so amazingly perfect...
2 cups cooked rice
1 cup heavy whipping cream 
1 cup French vanilla coffee creamer
1/3 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt 
Boiled it then simmered it stirring for 20 minutes. Topped it with a dusting of cinnamon and candied walnuts! So custardy and smelled amazing. Family said it was the best rice pudding they've ever had. Didn't need an egg, no raisins (ew why?). Pic posted

Works perfectly as written! I bumped up the vanilla to a full tsp and added a half tsp cinnamon to match our personal taste. Make sure to temper your egg mixture before mixing it in.

I made this and it turned out great. However after reading some other reviews I made a couple small changes to my own. I added an extra 1/2 cup of rice. I cooked the milk rice and salt down until it was a thick mixture. I mixed the egg white sugar and the rest of the milk together before mixing them with the cooked mixture. I also added a whole tap of vanilla instead of the requested 1/2. Much thicker sweet rice pudding.

I needed a quick dessert for some dinner guests that are "gluten free", and I found this.  It was a big hit and some of the non gluten free guests chose this over the upscale cakes and pies that I made.  I doubled the recipe and for the last cup of milk I added half and half.  I'm keeping this one for a regular dessert.

My husband decided to buy 50 pounds of rice.  This is a great way to use some of it up.  Besides the fact that it is yummy.  I made sure that to temper the eggs and bring to a slow boil so it thickened up.  Yummmy!

I had no idea making rice pudding was this easy and quick! It was absolutely delicious and almost embarrassingly easy too. I added lots of cinnamon and a little nutmeg too. As others have mentioned, it only took about 8 minutes for mine to thicken before adding the egg/milk/sugar mixture slowly as I stirred the rice mixture as to not scramble the eggs. Maybe the amount of time fluctuates quite a bit depending on the cooking surface used though? Mine was induction. I also think the type of milk and % is key to the thickening process too. I love to use the “Horizon” brand 2% which is ultra homogenized and always becomes creamier than regular homogenized brands when I use it for frothing in coffee.

used leftover jasmine rice from dinner. super easy stove top recipe. For the last 1/2 cup of milk I used 1/2 1/2 for more richness.  I added a dash of cinnamon to each serving cup. It's just what I am used to. Rice, milk, sugar what could be bad.

I've made this twice. First time it came out fantastic second time not so much, runny this time. Followed recipe first time  The thing I did different was to cut back on sugar this time as I was going to share with a diabetic,  Not sure I didn't cook it long enough this time. But I am going to try again!

First time making rice pudding and I substituted almond milk and coconut sugar and it came out great!! I opted to make the pudding thicker so only used 1 3/4 milk.

Made this for my father who always wants me to make rice pudding from take- out leftovers. I doubled the recipe and used unsweetened almond milk, half the sugar as Monk Fruit Sugar and sprinkled cinnamon and nutmeg on the top. The cooked egg makes this absolutely delicious. Now my go-to recipe.

I had too much leftover long grain white rice, and a box of 1% parmalat that needed to be used up...and this still turned out fantastic. I left out the raisins because I like them on top, and added a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the egg when I beat it. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Very good. Thanks.

Be careful not to overcook. I didn’t think it was thick enough on the recommended minutes and cooked it until really thick. Follow the minutes recommended. Taste was good. I will make it again, great way to use leftover rice.

Wonderful way to use up leftover rice! I used half cup of half and half and the rest milk and left out the butter (we ran out) and it came out perfect!

Might I suggest to those having too much liquid, just make sure you stir constantly and until the liquid evaporates. This will for sure get rid of the "soup".                                     Thank You so much for this easy recipe. Whole family devoured it! Next time...I'm doubling it so I may have some extra for me!     LOL

Nope.  Did not like at all.  First of all, no cinnamon?  I did use coconut/almond milk and natural sugar.  Was watery, not like pudding.  I cooked way longer than called for.  Would not recommend.  Was not "quick."

Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe pretty closely, except I didn't have to wait 15-20 minutes for my milk and rice mixture to thicken. It was  very thick in roughly 10 minutes! I had it on medium and was stirring the whoooole time. The extra milk definitely loosened it up so after I added the sugar and eggs (and some cinnamon and nutmeg lol) I kept it on the heat and stirred for maybe another 5-10 minutes.  I was wary about the butter but it actually made a difference! The pudding tastes richer! This recipe is absolutely wonderful! Thanks so much for sharing!

I only wanted to make rice pudding because I didn't want to waste my leftover rice. But  my family gave it a big thumbs down because it was "too loose" and not sweet enough. I knew I should have used my own recipe, but I thought I'd give someone else's a shot. A bit more sugar, less milk, an extra egg, and you might have something here.

I made a rice pudding only vaguely based off this. It wound out super yummy! I used leftover red rice, low fat milk, cinnamon, nutmeg, and only 1/4 c brown sugar. I cooked the milk and rice at  a lower heat for about 40 min until it got to a nice creamy consistency. Then I added the last of the milk, and brought it to about halfway to the consistency i wanted. I added the sugar and stirred. Then, before it got too thick, i added the egg, which made it thicken up perfectly! The pudding is extremely rich tasting, and super creamy. I think next time i would use less milk.

Nice and easy to make and it did get nice and creamy.  However, I found the pudding to be quite bland.  I added cinnamon as well but was still unimpressed with the flavor.  Nothing to really grab my attention.  Perhaps if brown sugar or maple syrup was used in place of the white sugar it would have had a better flavor.

I think one more egg would have made it thicken better.  I considered it at first then decided to try it as is.  It was very thin and soupy but delicious.  I also added cinnamon

My husband is an avid rice pudding fan, so I have tried many recipes in an effort to find the best one.  This is it!  I have made it several times only altering the cook time a bit (longer after adding the egg).  It is creamy and delicious and gets eaten up quickly in my house!  FYI, if you are making rice for this (rather than using leftovers from last night's dinner) a cup of dry rice makes almost exactly enough for a double batch.

I just made this and the flavor is awesome. It is a bit runny but that is a whole lot better than dry pudding. I cooked the rice and milk with a vanilla bean and then at the end removed the caviar from the bean and added it to the pudding. I also added cinnamon to the recipe. I will definitely be using this one again.

I omitted the butter which isnt needed and just adds calories. I used less rice since I like it creamier. Really how much rice you add is up to you.  I did add the golden raisins and 1/3 of a cinnamon stick. Needs salt but I always add a bit of salt to rice when I cook it so I didnt add more. I carefully tempered the egg by adding  a little of the hot rice mixture to the egg very gradually. So easy to get scrambled egg!  Because I’m diabetic I omitted the sugar and added Splenda to taste after it was removed from the stove element but still hot. Also added a capful of rose water which gives it a Middle Eastern kick and makes it smell wonderful.

Recipe works perfectly by itself. I made a few changes. Added ½ teaspoon of cinnamon with the egg and sugar. I also toasted some ¼ cup of cashews (not whole, but split) in a tablespoon of ghee on medium low for 4-5 minutes until golden brown. I added that instead of the butter that was mentioned in the recipe. It was fine without ghee or cashews, but they definitely took them to another level!

Delicious!  Easy to make and a great way to use up leftover rice.  My rice was three days old so getting dry and it cooked up wonderfully with a lovely flavor.  I will definitely make it again.

I am not very good at baking so have tried several kinds. I cooked 2 cups of jasmine rice since this is what i had.  I found it easy to make and will make it again. I used brown sugar instead of white and i am not sure how much more milk I added since i did not measure it...just went by thickness i wanted...
It was quick to make which i like. Want to try a baked one next...

I made 2 .2 times the amount as that is how much cooked rice I had left.  Basmati.  I put lots of raisins in.  I was going to use dry cranberries, but stuck to Thomson raisins.  I also added cinnamon to the mixture.    it i wonderful.  Would have been just as good any which way.  Very similar to how my Mom and Grandma used to make boiled rice pudding.  Some times my Mom when finished, would stir in whipped cream but I watch how much fat I use.

Before adding the egg/milk mixture to the heated milk/rice mixture, make sure you temper the egg. Add a little of the heated milk to the egg, doing this gradually to raise the temperature of the egg before you add it to the rice/milk mixture. This will prevent the egg from cooking rapidly when it hits the hot milk, forming those bits of cooked egg. 

I added some cinnamon and cardamom, and this turned out delicious!

I think the "one whole egg" is the cause of the soupy pudding.  I used traditional pudding recipe of two beaten egg yolks instead,  added to the 2 cups of cold milk, raisins, and the sugar.  Stirred constantly over medium heat until the pudding came to a full boil and thickened.   Removed from heat and added the rice, vanilla, and a  sprinkle of cinnamon.

I have tried and failed miserably for years to make a good rice pudding.  This is PERFECT and I will do it again.  I did add cinnamon because I love it.  The only change I made was to use half heavy cream and milk for the final step.  WOW WHAT A WINNER!!!

I used coconut milk instead of regular milk. I used jasmine rice and instead of 1/3 cup white sugar I used 2 T of organic coconut sugar. I added 1/3 cup chopped medjool dates and 1/3 cup of regular raisins. When it came time to add the egg I did what someone else suggested, I added some of the hot creamed rice/milk mixture to the egg and then added the last 1/2 cup of milk to that and added a bit more hot mixture. This way nothing cold went into my pot. Cooked that for about 5 more minutes and added 1 teas of vanilla instead of 1/2 teas and no butter. 
Seriously YUM!

Definitely will make again and again. Simple ingredients simple recipe. It's a win win. Made it exactly  as the recipe said but mixed the egg and half cup of milk together and slowly stirred it into my rice and added cinnamon after I added the vanilla. Easy peasy and delish!

I see some people saying that the pudding turned out soupy for them. To fix this, I would recommend cooking and stirring the pudding until it reaches your desired consistency. Given enough time, I promise the pudding will thicken. Mine took about 10 minutes longer to thicken than stated in the recipe, but it was absolutely delicious when finished. My entire family loved it. Will definitely make again!

Next time I'll use 2 cups rice instead of 1 & 1/2.

I used my InstantPot and it worked great!  I doubled the recipe-based on how much rice I had so I had to split it into 2 batches.  I put all the ingredients into a round casserole dish (ceramic), except the vanilla and butter, placed it on a trivet with 1c of water in the bottom, cooked it on "porridge" and after it was done, let it sit for 10 minutes until it depressurized.

For a dairy-free version I used rice milk and left out the butter. I could have used earth balance vegan butter, but it tasted great without it!

Easy and my husband said it was just like his dear mother made.  I used left over jasmine rice.  Since I didn't have whole milk, I used a can of evaporated milk.  To suit his sweet tooth, I used 1/2 c. sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  I tempered the egg/milk/sugar mixture by adding a big spoonful of hot rice/milk mix to it before adding it to the pot.

Not having vanilla, I used Tequila for flavor. Whiskey or Rum would work also. I ladled the finished pudding into two glass bowels Line with pecans and sliced bananas. It was excellent.

This is a delicious recipe. I doubled the recipe and the quantities worked out fine. The only changes I made was to use 2 cups of milk and 1 cup of half-and-half, vs. 3 cups of milk;  craisins instead of raisins (because that’s what I had); and a bigger splash of vanilla.  I will definitely make this again.   Thank you, Jennifer.

Almost like Mom's!  Nice to be able to make this pudding on the stove top rather than in the oven like traditional rice pudding.  I had to omit the sugar, substituting Splenda for it.  Other than that, I kept the recipe the same.  Delicious!

I love rice pudding and have made it quite a bit. This is my first time with this particular recipe and it came out great (as per others, I did add 1 tsp. cinnamon and a 1/4 tsp. nutmeg to get the flavoring I prefer for rice pudding).

I have been making this exact recipe for well over a year now (maybe longer). This is a very simple recipe, but I love it. it's not too sweet, and doesn't take long to make. Whenever I have to make white rice for anything, I always make extra just so I can have the excuse to make this.

This is the easiest, yummiest rice pudding! I just made it for the first time. I did not do any substitutions. I followed the recipe to the letter and it came out perfect. For those reviews I've read that stated their result was runny...you have to make sure you are cooking long enough. 
I made it for a friend who has cancer and has been craving rice pudding. I'm so glad I was able to make this for her.

Best rice pudding. The first step is just cooking rice with water, so I made it the way I always do, in a rice cooker, careful not to skimp on the water. That way the rice is soft to start. When adding the egg which I combined with the milk, 
I also did what I always do and tempered the egg/milk with some of the hot mixture, then stirred constantly as I added it back. No egg lumps. Could even work with a little less sugar, 
I think, but it’s creamy and delicious l

This was pretty simple. I don't always do well cooking rice on the stove so I used my rice cooker for the microwave. 
I added a dash of cinnamon to the mild and rice as I cooked it.  
Poured the finished pudding into a stainless steel bowl and sprinkled a little more cinnamon on top. Left out the raisins since my wife doesn't care for them.

I used leftover jasmine rice and so far so good! I had to have a tiny taste before it cooled, and it was perfect! Will definitely make this yummy goodness again! Tasted just like the rice pudding my Mom made. Thanks for the wonderful and tasty memories!

Delicious!  I substituted Condensed Milk (only 1.5 cups v 2 that the recipe calls for) and removed the white sugar, also I added 1 extra cup of rice to make it thicker AND not too sweet (2.5 cups of rice total).  It was still runny so at the end just before the eggs I added 1tbsp of cornstartch and let it cook 5 more mins before adding the eggs and vanilla.  Turned out AWESOME!

Adaptation:
2.5 C of Rice
1.5 C of condensed milk
1/4 + pinch of salt
1 egg beaten
1 tbsp of butter
1/2 tsp of vanilla extract

This is my go to Rice Pudding recipe! I often make it with almond milk (and I never add raisins) but today I tried it with dark chocolate almond milk because it's what I had in the fridge. I halved the sugar and added cinnamon, and I really enjoyed it!

This worked perfectly! I wanted to make rice pudding like my mom's, but I didn't know where her recipe was so I used this and this tastes exactly like my mom's. Thank you!
It seemed a little thick, but that could've easily been a mistake on my part.

This is a good recipe and flexible. I added more milk and rice. I tempered the egg into the hot milk carefully. One of my tricks is to use low fat milk which is what I normally buy but also add up to 1/2 cup cream  Our grandmothers never used low-fat milk which didn’t exist then and  I believe it’s a major cause of dessert failures today. You need to use full fat milk or add some cream to low-fat milk in order to make it thicken properly. Using some cream it thickened for me in ten minutes. I did not add salt because I used leftover rice which already had a bit of salt and I increased the vanilla by 1/4 teaspoon.As an alternative I would flavour this with rose water instead of vanilla and omit the raisins.

We doubled the recipe so that it'd last longer. If you're familiar with Yankee Rice this is a close cousin. It's really creamy. With the recipe doubled (I actually used 1/2 stick o' butta. Ehhh, something's gonna get ya. Hyperlipidemia is for textbooks, this is for taste buds. (see pics)

This recipe is delicious. I use day old Jasmine rice that was cooked with coconut milk. I use almond milk instead of regular milk and 2 yolks instead of a while egg.

Wonderful. Brought back many memories of my childhood.  I substituted half and half for 1/2 milk.  The trick is to keep cooking until the right custard like thickness. I also added more raisins due to personal taste.  I wouldn't add butter until I'm about to serve it and when it's warm.  Delish!  Thank you!

This recipe is perfect.  This is the method I remember my Mother doing, and the entire family loved it.  My husband was raving about its goodness.  This is a great way to use left over rice.

Dairy-free option!! I made it with almond milk and non-dairy spread and it was still creamy, delicious and perfect! I couldn't even wait until it was completely chilled to eat it, delicious slightly warm.

Super good and creamy. Some people said it was funny but you just need to cook in the milk for long enough. I put some cinnamon and 3 blueberries on top because I didn't have any raisins. How do I uploaded a picture of it?

I have made this recipe multiple times and love it.   I recommend using hot cooked Risotto Rice.   It will produce a  much creamier pudding.   I don't put raisins in because not everyone in my family likes them.

I love this recipe but I usually substitute vanilla extract for almond and use cooked Basmati rice PC brand. Today, I pulled a “Mammy” (my wonderful mother in law) and just threw everything into the pot and went to town, just to see if it would cook up well.  It took 27 minutes on medium heat (6-7) to cook up and set.  Lovely, creamy texture!

I used leftover rice from Chinese meal and half and half since it was on sale at the grocer. It hasn't yet cooled but what remained in the pan was luscious!  Totally pleased.

Rum ! ?? Feel free to do your own thing! 
This is a very good recipe to customized to your taste. 
I only used 1/4 cup raisins(not golden), 1/4  teaspoon cinnamon, 1 & 1/2 tablespoons butter and replaced 1/2 cup of milk with half and half.  I added  sugar slowly to my taste.  When it  was  thick  and creamy "Before" taking it off the stovetop I added 1 full shot of Rum!  Let the alcohol cook off.  Took it off the stove, stired in the vanilla extract.  Wonderful on my Thanksgiving morning!

I would recommend using less milk and adding cinnamon. Mine is a little runny but I'm hoping when it chills overnight it will be thicker. I guess they assume you know what to do with it when it's done? Doesn't say cool and refrigerate or eat as is. It's too soupy to eat warm but that's OK because I prefer rice pudding cold. We'll see what it looks like in the morning?

I think this is better than what my mother used to make when I was a child! Creamy and luscious! The only thing I did different was heat a scant 2 tablespoons of rum with 1 T. sugar to soak the raisins in while the pudding was cooking & sprinkled each serving with a little cinnamon before serving. Yum!

I made 2 changes, I added about 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and cinnamon.  A few reviewers said that it was soupy, make sure you use Whole Milk or it won't set.  The tempering of the egg mixture with the rice mixture is very important.  One said that their pot scorched , make sure you stir the rice mixture constantly.  My hubby is my taste tester and he thought it was very good.  Since we don't eat the white rice that we get with our chinese food this is a great way to make use of that rice.

I had some leftover rice and did a google search to find a good recipe for rice pudding. This recipe popped up and looked easy enough to make. I followed the recipe and added more time after folding in the extra milk, egg and sugar. I also added some cinnamon anid nutmeg for more flavor. This turned out really yummy.

This is just like my Mom made for us when we were kids.  That was more than 80 years ago.  It is a wonderful treat.

I had just enough left over rice that had been cooked in coconut milk so I used that.  Added chopped craisens and it was delicious!   I’ll make it often.

I had leftover white rice from Chinese Takeout and wanted
to use it. The only changes I made was using one cup of 1% milk, 1/3 cup of evaporated milk and a few sprinkles of cinnamon.
If needed; I could always add more milk.
This was great!
Thank you!

During the first step (when you combine the rice and milk) I only used 1 cup of milk to avoid making the pudding too soupy then followed the rest of the directions exactly. It was perfect! I also tossed in some cinnamon at the end which was a great addition.

Tastes delicious but would not thicken on the stove so took off one star for that. Then I tried baking it hoping it would turn to custard from the egg.  Took off another star. It's a very yummy soup.

I used generous cup measures of rice, but otherwise did not change ingredients.  I tempered my egg mixture (slowly added a cup or so of hot rice mixture to egg mixture to prevent curdling), and I simmered the pudding on low heat for about 20 minutes after adding eggs, to give the rice more time to soften.  It turned out wonderfully.

Had a sweet tooth so I just decided to make this. It was fantastic! I added a little extra rice and a little powder sugar to help thicken. Added cinnamon and omitted raisens and it was the perfect treat! Will definitely be making alot more often!

I made this for a sweet young couple who had been ill.  They loved it.  The husband said it was the best rice pudding he’d ever had.  Was I proud.  I did change up the recipe a bit.  I used a double boiler.  I used half and half for the larger addition of milk, and heavy cream for the smaller.  I whisked together the egg, sugar and cream separately and added the hot mixture while whisking to temper, then added the egg mixture to the large pot, stirring well.  It came out so smooth.  After adding the butter, vanilla and raisins, it thickened up beautifully.

Very good! Had to make one change....I used a combination of whipping cream and milk to total the 2 cups. So creamy and delicious. Also, I would use less (or none) raisins next time... just a personal preference.

I made this on a whim when I had extra rice when making stuffed peppers.  I loved that I had everything on hand.  This was super easy and very delicious.  I would make this again.

The ingredients and proportions are fine (though I omit the butter as a personal preference); however, the technique is, in my opinion, flawed.  I've probably made pudding a hundred or so times and I've never divided the milk and I don't think it's a good idea to if you want a thick pudding in a reasonable amount of time.  Adding 1/4 of the milk with the eggs and then only cooking an additional 2-3 minutes means that that portion of the milk will not be cooked and will thin the mixture quite a bit.  But all is not lost!  If you just keep cooking it the mixture will thicken back up (about another 10 min or so).  In the future I will cook all the milk at once, then temper the eggs and add them in, and hopefully only have to cook an additional 5 minutes or so (I like a thick pudding).

This rice pudding is delicious! I like the fact that you can make it on the stove and you have to bake it. I sprinkled it with cinnamon when I served it.

This was a very easy recipe to work with.  I did not add the raisins. I made two separate batches. The first I followed the recipe exactly.   My husband and son found it too sweet. The second batch I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and we found it to be just right. I used a sweet rice and cooked it according to the directions on the package.

Thank you for a wonderful recipe that will be on our dessert menu for years to come! So creamy and delicious!

This is a great recipe! Exactly what I have been looking for. I will make it often. It's a little sweet for my taste so I will cut down a little bit on the sugar, increase the vanilla and put good quality  cinnamon on top. If you can Saigon cinnamon and use it you will never use regular cinnamon again.

I doubled the recipe. I also added twice the amount of eggs, vanilla, and probably 1/3 cup more of sugar. I was going for a more custardy rice pudding. It's delish!!

I liked this recipe and Sonic made it. I added cream instead of milk and a stick of butter. Cream will add a different texture to the pudding, next time I'll use 2 cans instead of 1

The only thing I changed was by accident. I made 2 cups of rice instead of 1.5 cups. It actually turned out extremely hearty and think and the flavor was amazing! Absolutely NOT runny! I added cinnamon and nutmeg at the end for a little punch of flavor. Perfect recipe for someone as cooking challenged as myself.....fool (me) proof!!!

This is really a good recipe and easily modified for your needs.   I have almost 3 cups of rice and added the same amount of milk at the beginning of cooking.   Then I added 1/2 cup or more of milk at the end along with an additional egg.   I didn't add any additional sugar because I don't like it too sweet and I added an additional tbsp. of butter.   This worked for us because we like it a bit thicker .   Saving this one for later use.

I used a 12 oz can of evaporated milk for the first milk addiion and 4 oz of 2% for the second.  Added a little cinnamon.  Other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  Came out creamy and delicious.  My husband said he thinks it may be the best rice pudding he's ever had!

Very good - followed suggestions and used condensed milk instead and it was very thick and sweet (left out the sugar and just used the milk).  Great recipe and way to use up leftover rice from Chinese food!

Great way to make creamy rice pudding!  Made it with eggnog and a tablespoon of brown sugar.  Very creamy and a bit sweet because of the nog but will make again.

This took me back to my childhood when my aunt would make sweet rice. I used 2 cups of rice, 2.5 cups of milk, 1/2 cup sugar, added cinnamon and omitted the raisins. It's easy to make adjustments to taste. Delicious! Thanks for a great recipe! ??

Followed recipe but was generous with my cooked rice measurement. Omitted raisins because I didn't have any and sprinkled with cinnamon. Came out creamy and comforting. Will make again.

Delicious! I suggest the following edits: reduced the milk to 1 1/4 cup and the white sugar to 1/4 cup. Substitute golden raisins for craisens. Add 1 tsp of cinnamon when it is time to add the remaining milk and egg. Whisk the now edited 1/4 cup of milk with the egg before pouring into the mixture. Cook till reduced to desired consistency. Remove from heat then add craisens, sugar, vanilla, and butter and mix till completely incorporated. Enjoy!

My family loved this recipe. I would recommend tempering the eggs before adding to the hot mixture so you don't get scrambled eggs. I used Splenda with just 2 tbsp of sugar. Yum!

The pudding is quit good but I feel like there is too much vanilla. I might try making it without vanilla next time. The rice was also a little crunchy but that could have something to do with my inability to cook rice. It also takes a long time to get thick and creamy, I know I probably can't really escape that when making rice pudding, though. All in all it is a good recipe and tastes quit good.

This was delicious! I had some cream, dolce delche, and condensed milk left over from my daughters baking and needed to use them up. I combined them all to make the 2 cups of milk and followed the recipe for the other ingredients. 
The only other thing I did was added salt at 3 different times throughout the process and tempered the egg before adding.
This turned out to be a salted caramel, heavenly creamy, 5 star yum! I don't like raisins but I added them for my daughter and everyone loved it! Will make this again and again

I made this twice; both were delicious.  One batch I used almond milk, raisins, cinnamon and nutmeg.  The other I used a can of sweetened condensed milk and no other spices.  Both times I added additional rice and thought the consistency was perfect.  I may plan to cook too much rice next time I fix dinner.

Recipe was pretty milky.  Taste was good but texture was too runny.  Needed some other type of starch to thicken it up, even after it chilled.

I actually three cups cooked white rice left over from a stuffed bell pepper recipe and whole milk, so I thought to look up this recipe for the first time and make it. I kept the raisins and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon for double the recipe and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I just tried it warm and it was delicious, but it will taste even better when super cold with whipped topping!  I noticed it takes a little longer for the pudding to thicken up all the way, but just turn it to low, stirring frequently and wait a little longer - it's worth it!

Added crushed graham crackers for a topping, as well as honey and cinnamon during mixing. I personally feel like the recipe should call for less salt, though.

When I had to add the remaining milk, eggs and sugar to the rice, I first mixed it all together, and then very gradually added it to the rice. I was going to temper the eggs with the milk, but did this instead. I also added less sugar. It was very yummy!

Like another reviewer suggested, I added the milk more slowly (just a cup at first, then the half cup after it thickened up) and also added some of the warm mixture to the beaten egg before putting it in. I also added some cinnamon and nutmeg, and it was nice and thick with a good flavor.

Very good! I'm giving it 4 stars because the amounts of rice and milk called for didn't work for me. It seemed real soupy (as others have mentioned), and I was afraid it wouldn't come together. So I used 1 1/2 c of milk and had to add more rice than called for. I was glad I had extra rice on hand; I gradually added about a cup more, continually stirring. It still took close to 10 min to get to the texture I wanted. Michelle M's tips worked well for me, as well. I also left out the raisins because I wouldn't care for them here.

My husband, the sweet tooth, has asked me to keep this around all the time! A dallob of coolwhip on top makes the pudding.

I only drink skim milk, which doesn't produce creaminess, so I used half canned coconut milk, half coconut water, and a dash of heavy whipping cream ... yummmmmm ... I just kept stirring until the right consistency, then topped it off with a dash of cinnamon once I had it served up. It didn't last very long in this house lol

Excellent!  Had day old white rice and wanted to do something different with it. Let me tell you, this recipe was spot on!!! The only changes I made was mixed heavy cream(only because I had a little on hand) with the milk and added cinnamon. 
The entire family loved it :-)

Instead of 2 cups of milk, I used one cup sweetened condensed milk, and one cup of 2%.  I also added a dash of cinnamon to the first step. It was perfectly sweet and creamy! (4 stars only because I changed the recipe a bit).

I accidentally made 10 cups of rice instead of 5 for another recipe. So this recipe just saved me! I added more milk, cooked slower, and ADDED NUTELLA. Oh my god the subtle sweetness of the nutella just made this recipe a fave for me, highly recommend adding it if you like chocolate.

This turned out great! Exactly the way I like it.  Runny immediately after cooking but thickens to the perfect consistency after sitting for a bit.  I omitted raisins. Yum!

It's a good base recipe.  I added cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also made sure I used whole milk.  I think that helps with the consistency.

So delicious. I made 2 changes. First was that I added a sprinkle of cinnamon (about 1/2 tsp) with the bulk of the milk. Second, I tempered the egg before adding in.  I'm not sure it made a difference but, in my experience, adding an egg to hot pudding is a surefire way to have scrambled egg chunks in the pudding. SO I heated up the reserved milk and used that to temper. (For those who don't know - tempering is adding small amounts of hot liquid while beating the egg to warm it gradually and avoid chunks in recipes). It turned out so amazing and creamy and perfect :D

fantastic recipe thank you!  I added cinnamon and a pinch of cloves to the rice to infuse it with the flavour prior to making the dessert.  I will use a bit less sugar next time because I prefer more raisins and they add tons of sweetness.  Overall a wonderful comfort food recipe and we love it so much I make a triple batch so we can have it for the next day as well as bringing it to work for snacks.

I also tempered the cold mixture to avoid scrambled eggs.  Added cinnamon & a dash of pumpkin pie seasoning.  This recipe is why I always order extra rice with Chinese takeout.  If you order a qt. of rice, double the recipe.  You have to be patient while it is thickening, or you will have a very thin & runny outcome.  Keep in mind that it will thicken further upon cooling

I made this recipe this morning. I made a few changes. I used half whole milk and half whipping cream, replaced the extract with whole vanilla bean and added cinnamon. It's the best Rice pudding I ever hand. It was rich and creamy and super delicious. My family loved it!!!

This is definitely a "do over."  

Creamy texture, easy to make with leftover rice and everyone loved it.  

I eliminated the raisins because I didn't have any and added  cinnamon.   I mixed 1/2 cup  heavy whipping cream with the egg and sugar and tempered the egg mixture before adding it to the pudding.

I will definitely make this again. This is my 3rd time with some tweeks here and there.  First time I made this recipe, followed it to a tee,it was excellent. 2nd time not bad but as I was at someone else's place and all they had was 1%, still not bad but lacked something. Yesterday I followed some of the other reviews and used condensed and omitted the raisons and added cinnamon. That was fantastic! Only thing, next time I might cut back on the sugar because of the sweetened milk but I will definitely use this recipe always in the future.

It was a great recipe!  It came out very creamy with my modifications. I may seem crazy but I actually had a leftover pint of white rice from my Chinese food order and used that. I modified it a bit and took advice from the others. 
I used 2% milk, then towards the end, mixed heavy cream (same measurements as the milk), egg, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg and 1/2c. dark raisins. Then tempered in a bit of the hot mixture in to help incorporate the egg without curdling.  It tastes great!  Next time I may cut back on the sugar because it is pretty sweet!  Will make again.

Just finished making this. Really creamy and delicious! I did add cinnamon as a personal preference. As others suggested I mixed the remaining 1/2 cup milk with the sugar and egg before tempering it with some of the hot rice/milk mixture. Make sure to add the butter as that is what helps with the creamy-ness.

I think the problem with the soup-y-ness, is over cooking the eggs. Don't do it!  The consistency was perfect after the eggs were cooked three minutes, but i blew it, and cooked them for a few more. Bad Idea. Second time round.... perfect!

Omitted the raisins, and grated some fresh nutmeg and added a sprinkle of cinnamon, on top. It turned out a little soft, but I am pretty sure I just cooked it, a tad under. As it came to room temperature, on the counter, it did thicken, a little. Great recipe for left-over rice. :) ....almost like Mom's :)

For those who said the recipe is  soupy, it is if you follow the cooking times.  The first time I got nervous reading the reviews and added extra rice, which isn't necessary or advisable. This time I cooked the rice and milk until the milk was almost completely absorbed, followed the suggestion to add some of the hot rice into the egg mixture before adding it back, but then cooked it down for maybe 20 minutes. There is no doubt that it can be reduced to where it does NOT resemble soup. In fact, with additional cooking the rice is softer and the result is pretty darn creamy.  Actually, my problem this try is that I didn't stop cooking it a few minutes earlier and now it requires some microwaving to take it from a too-solid consistency to a pudding-like consistency.  I hope to find that happy medium next time.  Any advice how I'll know? And I did use 1/2 brown sugar again although this time I had white sugar in the house.

This is great rice pudding. Hard to eat just one serving. I have made it several times, always with whole milk for great rich, creamy flavor, and mix the egg in with the remaining milk to avoid any cooked egg pieces- and I have never had to temper the egg in this recipe because the heat just isn't that high and I stir very well as I add the egg/milk mixture. I have never had a problem with this recipe being runny. Hadn't made it for several years when my boyfriend brought home some uneaten sticky rice from a Thai restaurant . I hate to waste anything, so I spread it out on a cookie sheet to break up the clumps and went ahead with the recipe. Delicious! Even people who were not crazy for rice pudding thought it was great. I thought I would want cinnamon on it because I love that flavor, but the taste was so sublime it wasn't necessary. Thanks!

Very simple, and very tasty, recipe. I added a little cinnamon and nutmeg along with the egg, which I tempered before adding, and followed the recipe exactly outside of those small changes. The pudding was thick, creamy, and flavorful. I'll definitely be making this again.

I followed the outline of the recipe, however did a few adjustments. 7 cups of cooked rice, 6 cups of milk, Grinded pink salt till approx teaspoon and half, 6 eggs beaten w/ 2 cups of sugar blended in. Stir constantly, it will then start to get really creamy and thick. Add about half cup of milk and half cup of butter, continuously stirring until eggs set. Then rice pudding is done.  Sprinkle Nutmeg, and Cinnamon on top. I used Medium Grain Rice called "Nishiki" sushi rice. Worked perfectly.

I made this according to the recipe minus the raisins and it was fantastic. I left it to the taster whether they wanted cinnamon or not. I'll be sure to use raisins next time. This is a keeper!

Super easy and super delicious. I followed suggestions to make it with the condensed milk. With the condensed milk you don't need the sugar. Since it was my first time making it I pretty much followed the recipe (and added the sugar). I also added cinnamon. I will make it again but depending on your level of sweet tooth you don't need the sugar if you add the CM.

My family enjoyed this quick and easy recipe.  I did make a few changes.  I used almond milk sweetened instead of regular milk.  I  used more sugar but this will depend on your personal taste buds.  The recipe did not call for cinnamon but I added it and it was delicious. Overall, easy recipe. I have made it four times already, doubling the recipe every time.

I had 1 cup of leftover Chinese rice & decided to try & adapt this recipe for my diabetic husband.  I used 1 cup of the rice instead of the 1½, I used 1½ cups skim milk, 3 small boxes of regular raisins, 6 packets of Splenda instead of the sugar, & added fresh grated cinnamon.  A little too sweet for my taste, but the husband loved it!

Great way to use up cooked rice. My teen son ate two bowls! I added cinnamon during cooking.  Instead of adding eggs after warming the milk, I added it all at once and it turned out fine, not runny at all.

I just made this recipe exactly as written.  The only change I made was adding Del Monte Orchard Select sliced cling peaches that I drained (save the juice) and diced, instead of raisins.  I sprinkled a bit of cinnamon sugar on the pudding.  My family likes to pour a bit of the peach juice on their rice pudding, which is quite good.  My husband loves rice pudding, and he made sure I knew that this was ok to make again.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Tastes exactly like my Mom's rice pudding that I could never get right! I omitted the butter, and doubled the recipe.  Very easy to make.

This is a family favorite. I have had trouble with the eggs cooking in the pudding. Tonight I set it off the heat and then  I tempered the eggs by cracking it into a half cup measure then slowly adding spoonful of the rice mixture Tunis I had a total of half cup. Then I dumped it all into the mixture and stirred well before putting it back on the heat for the last three minutes. Much better consistency!!

This came out great. I too omitted the raisins and added cinnamon. I also used a bit less sugar. I adjust a little each time :-)  I will be making it again tonight for the 5th time.

Love love love it! I followed recipe but omitted raisins and a little less sugar. I stir constantly and haven't had any problem with soupiness. With the less sugar, I feel good about giving this to my girls for breakfast. Warm it and add fresh bluberries for a filling breakfast before school. This is a new fave for me and we always have left over rice.

Fabulous! I followed the advice of others and cooked it after adding the milk and salt until it was a thick creamy consistency. I had to urn the temp down below medium to prevent burning, as the rice needed more time to soften and absorb the milk. While it was cooking (in between stirring) I beat the egg into the remaining 1/2 cup milk. I added the sugar and stirred until dissolved.  I added this to the pot, pouring slowly with my left, while stirring the pot with my right.  It took longer than the 3 minutes to firm up, probably because I had lowered the heat a bit and was stirring constantly. I added cinnamon with the butter and vanilla just before serving.  Next time, I plan on adding it with the egg mixture. Deliciously easy!

Per my dad, who is now 87 and grew up in Philadelphia, the rice was very large, he said almost like it was soaked in milk.  Well, thats what I did.  Make the rice, I use Calrose rice, medium grain. The best is the asian rice.  Anyhow,  I use whole organic milk, and cover the rice just to the top.  IMPORTANT:  DO NOT REFRIGERATE during this process or rice will get hard.  You have to leave it out while it absorbs the milk.  This is done before the cooking.  Then you have to add the milk the recipe calls for. So if you don't have time, don't soak the rice!   Its amazing how much milk the rice absorbs!  So years ago I figured this out, and my dad swears this is how the authentic Philly style rice pudding was, but I really think they may have used risotto instead of rice.  I tried it before but it was difficult.   Anyhow, thats how I've been making this for my dad over the past 25 years.  Sad, he's nearing the end of his life, so this batch I just made for Christmas Eve dinner is probably going to be his last.

Worked pretty well; tripled the portions. Also, used left-over jasmine rice, cinnamon stick vs. ground, condensed milk and added a little lemon juice. Added a little extra salt to balance out the sweet. Also works with real maple syrup vs. sugar. Left out raisins as not a family favorite.

I doubled this recipe, and used about half a cup less 2% milk and organic brown sugar instead of white. Added cinnamon. Tempered the eggs. Simmered on low until it thickened - just be patient. Absolutely delicious!!!

Yummy and creamy.  I doubled the recipe and used a can of evaporated milk in place of some of the regular milk.  I did NOT find it soupy.  It was too sweet for us though (personal preference) so I will cut the sugar back next time.

My first time making rice pudding and this recipe was pretty easy. I cooked the rice in a rice cooker (just rice and water), once ready I put it in a pot on the stovetop and followed the directions. I subbed the sugar for sweetened condensed milk to my liking. I also added vanilla bean seeds. Looks and tastes amazing! Will definitely be making this again!

Really liked it! Very creamy. I tweaked it a little by adding half the milk and half condensed milk to sweeten it a little more. Added some cinnamon and omitted the raisins. YUMMY! This will be perfect for Christmas morning.

Great recipe. Creamy, buttery, sweet but not too sweet. Great as is but next time I'm going to add some cinnamon,  maybe 1/4 of top at first.

Tasty and creamy. I would probably only use egg whites next time though since I like the look of stark white rice. Jasmine rice was used and cinnamon to taste. :)

I just made this pudding with a few modifications since I'm on a diet, and it's really good. I started with 1 12-oz. can fat free evaporated milk and a half cup skim milk with 3 cups of rice. I cooked as directed, then added 2 beaten eggs (adding a little hot mixture to the eggs to avoid the eggs cooking), a cup of skim milk, and substituted 1/2 cup of agave syrup for the white sugar. I omitted the raisins and butter and added nutmeg for flavor.
I cooked it until it was pudding consistency. Very good! I'll take this to work with me and enjoy it all week.

Coconut milk worked like a champ with jasmine rice!  Used 1 can of coconut milk. Also added some cinnamon. I did blend those last few ingredients, including the egg, in a small mixing bowl then added slowly. Wow!

So easy. I had some mushy rice, must have done too much water in my rice cooker, so this cooked up quicker in the first stage for me, less than 15mins. I added cardamom which you either love or hate but if you love it, do it!

I'm a seasoned cook but not so much with desserts.  This was my first time making rice pudding.  Followed the recipe exactly but subbed dried cranberries for the raisins.  It was delicious and everything I had hoped it'd be.

I made this recipe just now and my husband ate it while it was still warm.  I doubled the recipe and forgot to add in the last 1 cup of milk(1 cup since it was doubled).  I also used equal parts condensed milk and water instead of regular milk.  I omitted the raisins and added cinnamon.  It was a hit!  This is going into my recipe box.  I'll definitely make this again.

Such a delicious, "comfort-food" dessert! I omitted the raisins and the salt, and topped the finished pudding with cinnamon. I will definitely be making this again soon!

My family loved this recipe! I didn't have any plain white sugar so I used cinnamon sugar. Came out great.

Yum! I did have to sub craisins for the raisins because that's what I had. It was delicious! My girls thought it would be disgusting, first because it contained rice, and secondly was a DESSERT containing rice, but even they gave it thumbs up.  It was creamy and fabulous, even with one percent milk. Thanks for a hit!
