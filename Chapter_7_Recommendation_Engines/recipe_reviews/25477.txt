Very good, very easy and basic. I cut the potatoes into wedges and boiled them. Then put them in a ziploc bag with olive oil, salt and pepper, lawry's seasoning salt, and garlic powder...and shook it up. Then I put them on the grill until they had darkened a little and gotten crispy. They were delicious!! Those of you that said they weren't flavorful enough....they are potatoes! You have to add the flavor!! Very very good! I was excited to find a potato recipe I could use on the grill.

We loved this BBQ potato recipe! I used red potatoes, cut into quarters and left the skins on.  I then took the zip-lock bag suggestion: used olive oil instead of vegetable and shook the potatoes in a mix of season salt, garlic, and onion powder.  Very good.  Goes great with any grilled meat.  Thanks Christine.

I microwaved the potatoes in a closed dish with no water after peeling & cutting them instead of boiling, then shook them in a ziploc bag to coat with oil, then put on grill.  They were GREAT!  My husband said "the best french fries I've ever eaten."  Really easy too.

I cooked these wonderful potatoes in the oven instead of the grill, and used olive oil (also, blanched them for 2 minutes to make peeling easier).  A total hit, everyone wanted to know how I made them, and my kids asked that we have them frequently.   Thanks, Christine.

I've made these several times just in the past few weeks. They're delicious! Only variation I made was to use olive oil instead of regular vegetable oil. The first time I made them, I made the mistake of allowing them to boil too long, which made quite a mess because they were too "mushy" to work with. (MY mistake!) Now I make sure they're still somewhat firm when removing them from the boiling water. Great, simple recipe!

A few simple ingredients and a simple preparation made for some delicious potatoes! I boiled tiny, baby Yukons in liberally salted water until almost tender, 8-10 minutes. Hubby seasoned them with olive oil, Lawry's seasoned salt and Penzeys Chicago steak seasoning, then skewered them on bamboo skewers which had been soaked in water. He grilled these along with Vinegar Grilled Chicken and Grilled Lemon-Pepper Zucchini (recipes also from this site) and it all made for a delicious grilled dinner with no mess in the kitchen! Basic, unembellished way of seasoning and cooking these potatoes but they were anything but ordinary! Loved 'em!

These were interesting, a nice change from grilled potatoes in foil.  I added a little too much salt to mine, but that was a minor thing.  The potatoes were best where the outside got crispy.  They are super easy and really not very fattening.  I think I will try it with other spices next time.

I really wanted to find a way to do potatoes on our grill, and we found a winner with this recipe! I probably made it 20 times this summer. Exactly as written, it comes out perfect every time; there's no good explination for how good it tastes, but the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. There were a few times that it was so hot that I couldn't bear to boil water, and I found that by lowering the heat on the grill a little (so they didn't burn) and cooking for longer (~45 minutes) I got very good results, as well.

Really good recipe! I boiled baby red creamer potatoes for about 10 mins and then tossed them with olive oil, salt and pepper and chopped fresh rosemary. I put the potatoes on wooden skewers soaked in water for a few hours. The potatoes needed about 15-20 mins on the grill. They came out so delicious..the skins were a little charred and the insides were soft and flavorful..almost sweet! Every time time I grill meat or veggies I will be sure to roast my potatoes this way. The entire meal can be made on the grill so the kitchen stays cool..a major plus during the south Florida hot summer!

While these aren't the prettiest potatoes I've ever made (add a sprinkling of parsley if you're serving to fancy-schmancy neighbors), they were NOT hard to make at all.  I used redskins and only half the oil and seasoning salt.  Since the recipe doesn't supply the size of potato to use, I was worried my reds were too small for all that flavor.  I'd make these again.

These are OK... not visually appealing and tasted boring. Needed lots more spices to make them better - but will try them again with modifications.

Definitely yummy. Used olive oil instead of vegetable oil for more flavour. Didn't have seasoning salt so just BBQ'd the potatoes and then sprinkled them with coarse sea salt.  Fab!

Glad I tried this before serving it to company. There was very little flavor, and they are not visually appealing. Lots of prep for little reward.

We had 50/50 reviews on this recipe.  Half really liked it and half thought is was nothing special.  It is very easy to make and I am sure with a little "tweaking" of the spices it would be a 5 star recipe.  Thanks for the post ~ I will most likely play with this one a little and end up with a great potato dish.

This is an easy and tasty way to make potatoes!! My kids peeled the potatoes for me, all I had to do is chop them in half, cook them for 15 minutes, toss with oil and seasoning salt, and hand to my husband to BBQ. It was great!! I made this recipe twice so far, once with OLD BAY seasoning, and once with LAWRY's Seasoning Salt. They were both good.

We both loved these... especially my husband! We were cooking an  eye round roast, so I put them in the oven too, in a separate dish. 
Used the tiny red potatoes with the skin left on, and I coated them with melted butter. I then added Seasoned Salt, Garlic Powder, Black Pepper, Rosemary and Parsley. They came out absolutely delicious. I love them with the skins on! And everything was done at the same time. I have requests to make these more often, and I certainly will.I'm rating these a four, because they really needed the flavor of the herbs and spices.Add those, and you've got a five star recipe! Thanks so much for the post!

very, very easy, and delicious and no matter how you spice it up, you can't go wrong!  I have used butter flavored Pam and sprinkled dill weed and seasoned salt on the potatoes, and my kids love that.  I have also cut onions, green and red pepper and added that to the potatoes (after they were boiled)with olive oil and seasoned salt and thats great too.  This recipe is very versatile if you like to experiment with different herbs, oils, and seasonings to accomodate the meat you are b-b-queing.  A great recipe.

Followed the recipe closely, used chipotle seasoned salt. Boiled the potatoes just a bit too long, that might of caused them to be a bit dry after BBQing. Will make again.

I didn't cook them, I put them in heavy foil, seasoned the baby raw potatoes with garlic powder, kosher salt, fresh rosemary and olive oil.  Fabulous!
