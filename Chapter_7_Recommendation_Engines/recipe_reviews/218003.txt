I make this dessert a lot over the summer, it's my kids' favorite dessert. I like to use the Hostess shortcake cups, if I can find them. This is also good with other berries, too, and even a mixture of strawberries and rhubarb or even berries and bananas, too. NOTE: I'm a little confused at the recipe's ingredient list calling for condensed milk but the directions don't explain on what to do with it. I've never used it in this recipe before but I'm interested to see if it makes it any better than without it.

The milk can be used in two different ways. Chilled before using.
1. Stirred in with the strawberries after they have chilled for an hour then proceed as stated.
2. Poured over the shortcake after it has been assembled but, before the whipped topping goes on.

Like the other reviewers....not sure what to do with the sweetened condensed milk, so I didn't use it. Otherwise, it's a nice simple "recipe". I used the sweetened whipped cream from this site.

I LOVE strawberry shortcake! It is one of my favorite desserts. I was searching for a recipe to make it when I came across this one. It is very quick and easy! I skipped the condensed milk since I didn't know what to do with it. For the shortcake cups, I used the ones publix sells. Its usually next to the strawberries. I love this so much! Its like having  a short cut to one of my favorite desserts with 1/2 the wait time! I used heavy whipping cream and added in 2 tbsp of sugar when I was whipping it. Next time I think I'll use the whipped topping cream in a can and see how that turns out!

I love this. Not sure what to do with the condensed milk.  I also like mine with the strawberries sliced not mashed and cool whip.

I just made this with the condensed milk and it was awesome.I did add a little regular milk to the strawberry mix so it wasn't as thick and I added some blueberries as well.Thank you for the recipe :)
