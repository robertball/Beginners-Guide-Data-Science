This stuffing was incredible!!!!!!!!I think that it was one of my most "complimented" cooking efforts--and I cook all the time:)It made two pans (11x9) and i made one without onions and one with. I used onion instead of leeks and used about 2 cups. I absolutely think that the Italian sausage makes this recipe, so if you can make it that way I highly recommend it. I added the broth last pouring a little over one cup over the ingredients in each pan then used a spatula to press the broth into the stuffing. I covered the pans and let the stuffing sit for about 30 mins and then baked as directed. One comment was it has a gourmet flavor, another had leftovers for breakfast because they absolutely loved it and everyone basically just raved about it. Thank you so much for this recipe that made this Thanksgiving so special!!!!!!!!!!Peggy in Texas

This stuffing is incredible!  Instead of leeks, I used 4 cups of chopped onion.  I also used Bob Evans Pork Sausage instead of sweet italian sausage.  This was so moist and full of flavor.  It made enough to stuff the turkey and fill a baking dish.  It's worth the preparation and I'll definitely be making this again next year.

Excellent, easy, and delicious.  I did use the leeks - and three large leeks measured out to the 6 cups.  I was worried about the large amount of leeks in the recipe, but they were an excellent addition to the recipe and cooked down considerably.  I did use turkey sausage as the recipe submittor suggested.  I also used dried cherries instead of cranberries.  About 3/4s of a 1-pound loaf of white bread produced 12 cups of bread cubes called for in the recipe, which I toasted briefly in my oven as it preheated.  This looked elegant on the table - very impressive.  I baked it alone, rather than stuffing my bird, so I used just a bit extra chicken broth.

Really 4.5 stars because of my "liquid dilemma"...see below.

This is the best stuffing/dressing I have ever eaten. I've never been one to put sausage in my dressing...it just seemed too "unhealthy," but is it ever great! Because I like the convenience, I substitute Pepperidge Farm Seasoned Bread Cubes (any type or combination...white/wheat/cornbread) for the do-it-yourself white bread cubes. Therefore, I don't add any poultry seasoning...but don't leave out the rosemary! 

Here's the one problem I've had with this recipe each time...how much chicken stock to use? Since I make it as dressing (not stuffing, which goes inside the bird), it comes out VERY dry with only 1 and 1/3 cans. This time I went to three cans, but I can't seem to get the amount quite right...it was still somewhat dry. 

Despite my "liquid dilemma," this has been the most complimented on and most requested holiday recipe I've ever used...other than my Bourbon Cranberries!

I got lots of great feedback on this stuffing.  I made it to take to my daughter's Thanksgiving feast at school this week.  I used 4 cups of onions instead of the leeks.  It seemed like an awful lot of onion, but once it was cooked it tasted great.  Because the feast was at lunch time, I made this the night before and heated it the next day.  If anything, I think it improved the flavor because it all had time to meld together.  Just remember to factor in extra baking time if you do this.  It really took quite a while for all that cold stuffing to heat up.  However, it would be nice to be able to make this the night before Thanksgiving and just heat it up on Thanksgiving, leaving more time for all those other dishes that need your attention.

I don't normally eat stuffing but this one is terrific and my family loves it. Even my four year old niece likes it.  I use pedridge farm corn bread crumbs instead of white bread crumbs which gives it much more flavor and sauteed onions in garlic instead of leeks.

I took a chance and cooked this in a Crock Pot, because I didn't have any more oven space available.  It was fantastic!  I set it at Low for 4 hours.  The recipe was followed exactly otherwise.

We have served this several years in a row and LOVE it. I do alter it a smidge by adding a little more chicken broth at the end (which I believe the directions forgot to tell you to add in the first place but it is in the ingredient list.) Instead of 1 1/3 cups I add 2 cups. This year I made it with sourdough bread and it turned out divine.

I tried this recipe about 3 years ago from allrecipes.com and my whole family loves it!  It's the only stuffing recipe I use now.  I don't go to the extent of drying my own bread cubes. I buy the pre-packaged one from the store and the recipe turns out great.  You won't be dissapointed!

This is an excellent recipe.  I did use the pork sausage but should have stayed with the turkey sausage.  I did not stuff the turkey and so baked the stuffing in the oven separately.  Worked great.  The cranberries presented beautifully around the turkey.

This stuffing is excellent when paired with the maple roast turkey, but beware if you're cooking for picky eaters. It doesn't look like your typical stuffing and if you can't get anybody to eat it then they won't know how good it is. I had so many leftovers I didn't know what to do with them.

This stuffing was a hit with my skeptical family.  We've been having the same stuffing for so many years, they reluctantly agreed for me to make it in addition to the usual one, and now they are requesting that I make it every time we have turkey.  This makes a big quantity, so I froze half and used it later with turkey leftovers and just needed to remoisten it with water.

Excellent change of pace from the traditional stuffing.  Slightly sweet, yet with a great flavor, I am going to make this one every year!  Note: The stuffing is better if made outside of the Turkey!

This was a total hit! I did however substitute cornbread for the white bread which I think enhanced the flavor.

In the words of Simon Cowell, this stuffing is "absolutely fantastic." I made this stuffing for Thanksgiving, and even though the recipe says it's good for a 10-14lb turkey, I stuffed an 18 pound turkey and still had left overs. It was beautiful to look at, and the leeks and cranberries gave it a great flavor. Everyone loved it. Even the person who I thought wouldn't like the fruit in it loved it. I even bought him a box of Stove Top, and he didn't want it, because he loved my stuffing so much. Thank you, Ibby!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This tuffing goes very well with Maple Roast Turkey and Gravy recipe. A little complicated to make (you're gonna wanna do this one the day before or you'll surely be lagging behind) but well worth it. Measurements area little off. You are going to want to cut the leeks to 3 cups instaed of 6.....way too many leeks. I would go as far s saying that next to my dad's oyster stuffing, this is the best.

I have been using this recipe for 2 years now.....I now have to make 2 pans of it just so everyone can have some. I don't stuff the turkey with it just bake it in the oven. I put it together the night before and add a little extra broth before baking. I use 3-4 cups of leeks and an extra apple sometimes I go to the butcher shop and get orange sausage to mix flavors up. I don't just make it for Christmas Thanksgiving and Easter. I also make it for my kids and they take it for lunch. Thanks for Sharing

This was a great stuffing for our Thanksgiving dinner, very easy to make and delicious! I did use a bag of stuffing bread cubes instead of toasting my own bread which may make it taste even better.

Excellent.  Make sure and cut the bread cubes up pretty small, makes for a better texture.  Tastes great nonetheless.  I've made it using turkey sausage and just regular ground turkey and I almost like the ground turkey better.

I made this today and only did a few substitutions.  First, I am vegetarian so I substituted pears for the sausage and veggie broth for the chicken broth. I was making a Maple Dijon glazed Quorn brand Turk'y roast to go with it.  After cooking the Turk'y roast for 20 minutes on 425F, I added the stuffing mix and placed the turk'y on top and brushed on the glaze.  I let it all bake for 15 minutes at 400F, added more glaze, then baked it for another 15 minutes.  This made the turk'y and stuffing perfect!  Even the ladies at church were shocked to have a vegetarian turk'y and stuffing there, but it was definitely a hit!

This stuffing had good flavor, but it was crumblier than the stuffing I usually make.  I think next time I would leave out either the apples or the cranberries (not both).

Great starter (and catchall) recipe for dressing.  Not sure why, but most recipes I see insist on the white bread.  Any variety of whole grain or dark bread gives wonderful additional flavor.  The measurement for the onions equals about two large onions.  I used a large wok for the sauteeing, since no large frying pan I owned was going to hold all of those ingredients (and made for far easing stirring).  Also, the poultry seasoning I used included rosemary already so I omitted the additional spice (4t is PLENTY for seasoning).  The recipe also did not indicate when to add the broth which, while obvious to the expert chef, makes amateurs like me a little stagnant with my second guessing.  The sausage could also be omitted for a just-as-tasty vegetarian broth.  Kosher salt makes it all tops.  Delicious!

I am rating this 5 stars because it was really good, but I am going to do some things different next time.  I used fresh dried bread (instead of stuffing cubes) which resulted in a more "mushy" texture than I like.  I like seeing the individual cubes of bread, so next time I'll use Mrs. Cubbison's stuffing (or is it dressing?  The big ones...) cubes.  The only other thing i'll do is reduce the poultry seasoning by a tsp.  It seemed to  be the main taste and so a little reduction will help, I think.  Also, I chopped the apples a bit small and they totally disappeared.  Next time I'll do bigger chunks.  Other than that this is a great recipe and I'll definitely try this again!

This was really good stuffing.... but it would have been better with fresh cranberries.  The dried cranberries just didn't give it enough flavor.

This was very good. I used fresh turkey stock and mixed orange flavored dried cranberries with regular flavored dried cranberries. I will make this again for sure.

I used onions, leeks and gala apples. I cut back on the amount of cranberries. The stuffing is excellent. I will definitely save the recipe and make this again.

Absolutely fan-double-tastic! I am in love with this stuffing! I made it vegetarian by subbing the sausage for  a package of veggie sausage crumbles and using vegetable broth instead of chicken. I like to use Granny Smith apples and I add a couple extra apples because I'm an apple freak! And I make my own poultry seasoning. I also use *fresh* rosemary to taste; adds a bit more zing, less bitter than dried and makes the dish tastier. I cook it in two separate (covered) casserole dishes so I have one to take for a holiday dinner and one extra to keep all to myself!  Cook in the oven at 350F for about 50 mins. Add a lil extra broth if you feel the mixture is too dry before baking, but don't go cray with it or it'll go mushy. Yum!  ;)

This stuffing hit a home run at the supper table.  The only other item I added was a half cup of chopped carrots for color.  Everyone loved it, even my wife who said it was "very good honey," and when she says that about a dish I prepared, I know it was great.  I will continue using that recipe.  Oh, one more thing, I added another cup of chicken broth to the mix.

GREAT!  ***10 stars***  Made this with the suggested Maple Roast Turkey and what a huge hit it was with everyone.  Really nice change from the usual sage dressing.  I'll make this again and again.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was easy enough to make.  I prechopped all the vegetables the night before Christmas to make prepartion easier the next day.  I used it to stuff the turkey and baked the remaining stuffing.  I have to admit that everyone seemed to like the baked stuffing better than the stuffing from the turkey.  I wasn't that fond of the cranberries and think that I will go back to my favorite sausage cornbread stuffing next holiday.  People who really like cranberries will probably love this stuffing more than I did.

It was FANTASTIC! I made this for the family on thanksgiving and everyone keeps talking about it. I double up on the recipe since I had to serve 17 mouths. Plus, I didn't change a single thing in this recipe and it came out great. The only thing I did differently was I didn't stuff the turkey. I baked the entire dish in a casserole pan and it turned out fantastic. I can't wait to make this for Christmas and new years!

I have to share what I did!  I watched the Pillsury cook-off and the winner was chicken and stuffing.  But here's the twist.  The stuffing replaced bread crumbs with waffle crumbs!  So I decided to go for it.  I used this stuffing recipe but instead of the bread crumbs, I used waffles.  I just bought frozen waffles, laid them out on the cookie sheet and baked them until they were crispy.  Then I broke them up into crumbs and used the same quantity as you would the bread crumbs.  It was so good!!!!!!!!!  Everyone should try it!  I wasn't sure how it would turn out but it was worth the risk!

I had to try this recipe for Thanksgiving 2009. I wanted to make a different type of dressing this year, other than my traditional cornbread dressing which is also great!  I used a country sausage to give it a more southern flavor.  I used cornbread which is mixed with one-fourth flour and three fourths corn meal. No bread crumbs.  suateed my vegetables and used turkey stock to combine everything together.  IT WAS EXCELLENT!!  The creanberries and apples were sweet and tart delicious!  Hope everyone will try this.  I might add this recipe to the website. I have several orders for this dish.  I do  catering, and this side dish is excellent to taste everyone will love it!! Hope this helps everyone!!  C. Turner

This is my absolute FAVORITE stuffing recipe! A friend of ours made something similar to this a few years back and for some reason, I could never find a recipe that came close, until now. I made this last year for Thanksgiving and everyone gobbled it up! This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Wonderful recipe!  Everyone loved it.  This is the third year that I have tried a different stuffing recipe, all which have been good.  This year - everyone told me to make this my standard.  I have 8 adults eating for my Christmas dinner, and this was much more stuffing than needed.  Next time I will half it.  I also did not stuff it in my turkey.

I just made this today for us to take to the in-laws tomorrow...  OMG is it delicious!!!  I used the Bob Evans Sage sausage & it is a tasty edition.  I also used onions instead of leeks.  Other than that, I used the rest of the ingrediants as listed...  I cooked it outside of the turkey, so I ended up using 2 cups of chicken broth.  I highly recommend this recipe.  It is easy & like I said, delicious!

This recipe is a crowd pleaser. Your kitchen is likely to be a miss when all is said, but it is worth it. My husband had doubts the first time I made it, but he ate his words. The only changes I make are; 1. I use the pepperidge farm bread cumbs instead of cutting up loaf bread. 2. I use onions instead of leeks. 3. I add a little sage and thyme.

This is the best stuffing you will ever eat! I make mine in a baking dish. I substituted 1 box of Mrs. Cubbison's Herb Cube Stuffing, instead of making my own bread crumbs, and I substituted 1 bunch of chopped green onions for the leeks. I also use 2cups (1 can) of low sodium chicken broth. I've made this 3 times and everyone loves it and wants the recipe! I would caution that the prep time is longer than stated. If you are pressed for time cook the sausage, and do some of the chopping the day before. You will never go back to regular "box" stuffing again!

I really loved this stuffing and so did everyone else at Thanksgiving dinner. Even the skeptics were quickly convinced. I went ahead and added more broth than the recipe called for (as suggested by others) and I think that was a mistake. I need to brown it up under the broiler because it was too soggy. Just follow the recipe!!! But it turned out great in the end! I will make it again next year!!

I made this for Thanksgiving and we think we'd like this better with some modifications.  I was skeptical about using sausage and was right, next time I'm leaving that out.  We keep picking it out of the leftovers!  We're not big rosemary fans, so I substituted some basil, oregano, and a little pumpkin pie spice - the flavorings were right on.  I'd also use 1/4 to 1/2 less cranberries because they make it really sweet.  I will be making this again for Christmas though.

This was very good, I just thought it was OK when I first tried it. BUT if you let it sit for about half an hour or so-long enough to soak up the juices and flavors-it was excellent!!  My guests loved it-I made it for Christmas dinner.  Very flavorful.

This was my first year making stuffing and I wanted to do something with lots of flavour. I loved this recipe. It was easy to follow and the proportions were perfect, well almost. I ended up using probably a cup more chicken stock than what the recipe called for. I would definitely make this recipe again, I can't wait until next year!

This is our favorite stuffing recipe, and my husband requests it every year!  I've made a few changes to suit my family's taste -- I use about 1 1/2 to 2 cups of FRESH cranberries, instead of dried ones, and cook them up with the apples & leeks.  I also use whole wheat bread instead od white, and I leave out the celery.  EXCELLENT!

The BEST stuffing I have ever had.  I've made it twice now.  The first time I used a mix of half hot italian sausage and half mild.  The second time, I used all hot and if you like spicy food, it gave the stuffing an extra kick that was quite yummy!

Yum!  I've tried a lot of stuffing recipes, and they never seem to turn out well, but this was a huge hit! I substituted raisins for cranberries, which was great, and used one onion instead of the leeks. Cooked in a casserole dish instead of a turkey, which meant I added at least twice the amount of chicken broth. Worked very well!

So tasty! I tried this after  the Thanksgiving holiday, and wished I hadn't waited. The italian sausage gives this a unique flavor.  The Maple Gravy goes well with the stuffing.

Easy to make. I made this along with the Rosemary turkey and the table raved! It made for an interesting stuffing, as opposed to those more plain. I'm not a dried fruit fan, but this recipe didn't make me turn my nose up; I loved it! I particularly enjoyed the sausage as well -- great flavor!

We had a traditional Turkey Day dinner this year with a twist.  Each item on the menu was prepared from a recipe never used before.  THIS ONE was *AMAZING*.  I'll make this every year forever... I followed the directions exactly and it was a crowd pleaser!!

I had never made stuffing before and everyone really loved this, so much so that I'm making it again this year. I used yellow onion versus the leeks. I also cooked it in two baking pans.

I did not like this stuffing at all. The reason may have something to do with using fresh diced cranberries as opposed to dried cranberries. Other than that I did not change the recipe though.

Excellent! Since I was cooking for a picky crowd I used onions instead of leeks, and a bag of onion/sage breadcrumbs. I did have to add a little more stock, but otherwise, EVERYONE really enjoyed this. Family told me to keep this to make again. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This stuffing is INCREDIBLE! I didn't stuff my turkey, I just did this in the oven. I cooked for 20 people, doubled the recipe (ish), and used sour dough bread. Even though I made what I felt like was way too much, every bite was eaten that day! The rosemary is absolutely essential.

Loved it!  Just be warned - for people that really love traditional stuffing, this is not it!  It has a different type of flavor to it (obviously), but is wonderful in it's on rite.  One of my guests at Thanksgiving dinner detests stuffing but loved this, and my husband and brother who both LOVE traditional stuffing weren't impressed and said this was their least favorite dish of the meal.

Super, super, super! This stuffing was excellent. I followed the recipe exactly, except I reduced it to 4 servings instead of 12. This is a keeper!Oh, and I used wheat bread, and couldn't tell the difference!

I made this with our turkey last year and it will be made again this year. My kids do not normally eat cranberries but they loved this stuffing. PS.. I did cook it inside the turkey and used a meat thermometer to make sure it was done.

I give this recipe 4 stars. It wasnt perfect, but was quite tasty. I did not bake it in the turkey which is why it may have turned out a bit dry. I melted butter and chicken broth to pour over the top. I think it would be much better if baked in the turkey.

This was okay. I found it kind of bland in spite of all the different ingredients and herbs.  Plus, it was kind of dry.  I probably won't make this again.

This was my first time making homemade stuffing...and it was delicious.  I pretty much followed the recipe as is (I didn't peer over it the entire time but tried to follow it as closely as possible).  the one change I made and suggest folks try it is I used slices of RYE and PUMPERNICKLE (sp) bread--the flavors molded ever so nicely...will make this again for sure!

This has become my "go to" stuffing recipe. It was a hit at thanksgiving yesterday! I added 1/2 cup of walnuts and started with a box of cornbread stovetop because i was pressed for time.

Before this recipe I was NEVER a fan of "box" stuffing this makes thanksgiving :)

Delicious! I have never made stuffing and never liked stuffing until today. I made this recipe exactly as is and it was fabulous! Everyone commented on how delicious it smelled and then how wonderful it tasted. I used mild turkey  sausage, granny smith apples, leeks, and celery along with the spices. It was easy and so good! One thing - I did not use it to stuff a turkey so there was A LOT of stuffing! Possibly a good idea to scale down the amount if not stuffing a turkey with it too. Thanks for the great recipe!

OH MY GOD! I THOUGHT I HAD DIED AND GONE TO HEAVEN! :-)  I wanted to try a new stuffing recipe for Thanksgiving this year and I searched of course allrecipes.com and I came across this one. I was not to sure about it calling for apples and pork etc. so I cut the recipe in half today and made it exactley they way the recipe called for  so that I could see if it would be worth making for Thanksgiving.! WOW! I am so happy I gave it a try. I love it and I am sure my guests will also, If you are thinking of trying this recipe please do you will not be disappointed. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe and it is now going to be the only stuffing I make :-)

I made this to go with our Christmas duck because I thought a sweet stuffing with some tang would go well with the flavor of the duck, plus I wanted to try something new.  This was a very tasty stuffing that complimented the duck quite nicely but in the end the family still prefered my savory wild rice & mushroom stuffing over this one (old habits die hard).  This would also go really well with a pork loin roast or pork chops (we don't eat pork anymore but those of you who do should give it a try).

I made this for a bunch of people, even though I don't like stuffing myself. I substituted onions for leeks and left out the celery. I liked the colorful look of the finished product, and my eaters said it was a moist stuffing even without extra broth. Do not serve if you like a drier stuffing.

I served this at two Thanksgiving dinners and both crowds loved it. The only changes I made (because it was quicker)were using boxed cornbread stuffing instead of white bread cubes, I used a mixture of green and white onions instead of leeks and used one red, green and yellow apple with peels on. My husband really liked the sausage in the stuffing and I'm not a sausage lover but enjoyed it as well. I'll be serving it again.

I have never given a recipe 5 stars before but this was amazing!  I used two apples and lots of chicken broth as I cooked it out of the chicken.  I also did not add cranberries- it just sounded too sweet.  I made it the night before and only threw it in the oven for 45 minutes.  The next day at a potluck I threw it in the oven for 7-9 minutes and broiled the top for a more to give it a little crust on top.  Overall- delish!  Oh yeah I also used chicken and apple sausage I happened to find at the grocery store that day...a lot healthier too.

A fantastic recipe.  Canadians usually prefer dressing over stuffing, but using this as a side dish and not just dressing is great.

Slight variations with other fruits, pears, peaches or crabapples, adds an incredible twist and an interesting variety.

My husband always asks for this stuffing.  I made for him for the first Thanksgiving when he met my family, and has asked for it ever since. (It's been almost 5 years).  I made it this year with Maple Roast Turkey, it was great.

This was the best stuffing I have ever made, because it is delicious and beautiful.  Use it to stuff the Maple Roast Turkey.  What a treat!  I put a portion in the bird, and I used a little bit of the maple butter from Ibby's turkey recipe to butter a casserole dish that I used to bake the remainder. YUM!  My family was delighted! Thanks Ibby!

Very good!  The only thing I would do is cut the amount of bread used in half, and place that in the dish first.  Then cover with the rest of the mixture.  Otherwise, much gracy is needed to soften the bread.  EXCELLENT.  Try her Maple turkey with this recipe, also worth 5 stars.

Very good!  The only thing I would do is cut the amount of bread used in half, and place that in the dish first.  Then cover with the rest of the mixture.  Otherwise, much gracy is needed to soften the bread.  EXCELLENT.  Try her Maple turkey with this recipe, also worth 5 stars.

I have made this recipe three or four times now, and it has come out well every time. I suggest adding more broth tho, to make it extra moist if you bake it in a pan instead of using it to stuff a bird. Even then, make it moist inside the bird so it helps keep the bird moist. I added golden raisins and the cranberrys, mushrooms, and used a yellow onion instead of a leek.

I read a lot of reviews on this recipe and made my revisions based on my personal preferences. I suppose as some say...it's not fair to judge a recipe if you don't follow it...Hmm, oh well. I had a 13 Lb turkey, and this recipe makes a lot of stuffing, so the first thing I did was cut the recipe in half. I had more than enough to stuff the turkey and fill a small casserole dish. I used store bought herb stuffing cubes. I omitted the leeks and used 2 cups of chopped onions instead. I didn't cook the sage sausage on the stove, because I wanted the flavor and moisture contribution the sausage made to the stuffing. I simply broke it up into small pieces and mixed it in with the stuffing cubes. The sausage will cook fully during the time in the oven, so no worries. I used about a cup of the chicken stock. The flavor of the stuffing is amazing...your taste buds will sing with glee enjoying the perfect balances of sweet and savory. Everyone at the dinner table had another serving of this stuffing, to my delight!!  I will make this stuffing again when the holidays come calling.

This was great.  I didnt change a thing.  Im not normally a fan of cranberries in stuffing but this recipe changed my mind.  I made 4X what I needed so that I could make sandwiches later and that worked great!  I added the stock slowly to get the consistency I wanted.  Great leftovers!

this was a very flavorful option for stuffing made straight in the oven. My family has a wide variety of dietary preferences so I substituted spicy chicken sausage from Trader Joe's for the Italian pork sausage and got rave reviews. It smelled and looked fabulous and the smokiness and kick of the sausage contrasted beautifully with the sweet/tart of the apple and cranberry. I chose to make it with corn bread and will do this again next year.

This Thanksgiving, I wanted to make all the classic foods but a little different than usual. This stuffing sounded really good and the reviews were overwhelmingly positive, so I chose it.  I made it exactly as the recipes indicated and it was easy and delicious. All the dinner guests enjoyed it and half the stuffing was ate before the end of the evening, which is pretty good considering I increased the servings to 24.   The only thing I might do next time is increase the sausage and decrease the cranberries (the tart/sweet flavor was the only thing some guests did not care for). Other than that, it was PERFECT and a really nice change from the standard Stovetop variety.

Very different from the traditional, but great.  I was afraid the apples would make the recipe strange, but I was wrong. 

I will make this recipe again!

I baked a traditional stuffing in the bird, and made this separate thinking only the adventurous would give it a try. The men in my family don't care for fruit in their meals.  I couldn't believe when they all tried it and took more. The only change I made was hot italian sausage to give it edge.

I combined this with the maple turkey recipe as recommended and absolutely loved it.  This was awesome.  I couldn't believe how tasty it was.  I added a bit more cranberries and chopped pecans.  I also used pepperidge farm cubed bread crumbs.  Tasted great.  I added extra chicken broth and apple juice as needed--but the recipe was truly execeptional on its own.

I thought that this stuffing was good but that the cranberries really overwhelmed the overall flavor.  Maybe less of them, or subsitute them with mushrooms instead.  I'll definitely give it a try again.  I baked mine in a pan outside of the turkey.

Thank you.  Dish was a hit with my extended family Thanksgiving dinner.  Followed the recipe to a tee give or take a measuring or two.  Included leeks and an onion, celery and herb seasoning pre-mix.  Averted a disaster - I almost forgot to add salt and pepper!  Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow!  Thank you.

I make this recipe every year. I first made this in 2004 and have made it each year since, with varying modifications. I always use the dried bread stuffing mix that my local grocery store has bagged and ready to go. Sometimes I use yellow onions, other times I have chosen not to peel the apples. I've done dried cranberries and fresh. I've added more stock to make it moist as well as changed up the seasonings. One year, I forgot "real sausage" so I used crumbled lil' sizzlers breakfast sausage. 

The short story: this is a great tasting, easy stuffing that is awesome as is, but can be tweaked to your preferences. No matter what I add or change, it still tastes great.

I fixed this for the first time this Thanksgiving and friends and family raved.  I used whole wheat bread to make the croutons and only used 6 cups of toasted cubes.  This will be my new tradition for winter holiday meals.

Made this for Thanksgiving, used onions instead leeks and added more chicken broth. It was a hit. We will use this recipe more often.
    Thanks for sharing.

Followed the recipe, but subbed a package of Pepperidge farm cornbread dressing mix for the bread cubes. It was my first attempt at dressing and it was a homerun!! I’ll make this again every year.

Bon Appetit first published this in 1994. I've been making it for over 10 years exactly as written and it is FANTASTIC! (although I never thought to substitute onions for the leeks, which can be hard to find). I make this the day before and bring to room temp about an hour before cooking. Right before putting in the oven I mix the chicken broth in (this recipe doesn't state when to add this) and bake as directed. Taste is always subjective, but my family LOVES this dish and expect it every Thanksgiving.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was the best stuffing ever. My husband who won’t eat stuffing told me it was amazing. As you begin to make it, It appears to be too much stuff to fit in a casserole dish. But don’t decrease anything! It will all cook down and fit perfectly in a 9x12 pan.

I have been making this stuffing recipe now for about fifteen years now. After the first time making it, I was asked to make it every year at the holidays. It is so savory and sweet, full of flavor yet light, not heavy as some stuffing recipes can be. It is a perfectly balanced and amazing side dish for turkey, ham or any protein for that matter. It will always deliver and be a hit.

this is so much like a galliano liquer recipe i found 35 years years ago and had to write done from memory  after the cookbook was burned up in a house fire the only differenceis the use of chicken broth instead of galliano liquer and whole cranberries in the can and cranberry sauce.   I am going to make this for this Christmas stuffing.  I will come back and let you know I also will not use just chicken broth.

Cut the recipe in half and used onion instead.  Also used sweet Italian chicken sausage which was great. I served this to 9 people on Thanksgiving.  It was a huge hit especially with my 18 year old son.  Unfortunately cutting the recipe in half did not leave any leftovers.

Disappointing recipe. On paper all the ingredients look good but when put together each one is fighting the others for attention and the flavor lacks balance and contrast. In short it is bland....

This was amazing!!! I got many compliments. A couple notes: I used reduced-fat Italian sausage and didn't drain it. Also, I added 2 cups of chicken stock, and skipped the liver. These notes are based on 20 servings (doubling original recipe).

We just finished our Thanksgiving dinner, and the dressing was the best I've ever had.   Made a half recipe, used an onion and boxed seasoned bread crumbs, and lots more chicken broth.  For the dressing that cooked in a casserole dish, I squeezed half an orange over it; will use the whole orange next time.

This has become my go-to recipe every year, often for both Thanksgiving and Christmas and I get requests for it, every year :). Due to a in-cavity stuffing phobia, I make it in a baking pan instead of in the bird. (Both ways are delicious, though, I assure you.) The only thing with the open baking is that you may have to add some extra broth to keep it from getting overdone, but the same unnamed phobic mentioned previously, also does not like moist (aka "soggy") stuffing. Definitely a keeper -- and very versatile if you really like more of one flavor than the other, or can substitute without issues.

I’ve made those about three times now and am finally adding a review. We love this stuff. I’m from Texas and was used to cornbread stuffing, but I married a Michigander who was used to bread stuffing. I did not like his mother’s recipe, so I looked for one which might please us both. This was it!  I now have friends asking me to make the stuffing for Thanksgiving feasts as they “remember it from last time!”  Thanks for this recipe.

This was delicious! The apple and cranberries really complemented the sausage.  I used onions instead of leeks because I had them on hand.  Also I soaked the dried cranberries in water while I was preparing it and added them last.  Next time I think I will bake it uncovered the whole time for a bit more crisp.

I have made this stuffing recipe for family get togethers and holidays for several years.  It is easy, tasty and savory!  It has even won over many family members that have proclaimed themselves "Oh-I-don't-like-stuffing-eaters"!
I do change it up just slightly:  I substitute Jimmy Dean Premium Pork Maple sausage and add 2 more apples (we like more of the apple's sweet tart flavor).  Always a hit!  I've shared the recipe with so many people I now have several copies of it ready to hand out whenever we have a new guest at our table!

I've made this recipe twice now for thanksgiving and it's always a big hit! It's simple to make and I even make it a day ahead and set aside in the fridge (I don't bake it until the day of). There is plenty enough to stuff a turkey (mine was 14 lbs) AND still have a large casserole dish for those who just prefer their dressing on the side. Instead of using bread cubes, I just use between a bag and a half to two bags of Pepperidge Farm's stuffing mix in the blue bag. I also make sure to have some extra stock on hand just in case it's too dry. This recipe is really foolproof!

This made so so so much stuffing. It was very tasty, but what an effort for stuffing.
Next time I will get the kids involved with the cooking and cut the work load, lol...
We did put the cranberries in hot water while we cooked the onions and celery to plump them up and that make little nuggets of sweetness that was a lovely surprise to the palette.

I made this yesterday for our Christmas dinner, and it was the hit of the dinner. I had never made it before, so I was kind of nervous about it. Everyone wants the recipes now. The only thing I did differently was put in an onion instead of the leeks, because I couldn't find any. And I just used plain old breakfast sausage. This recipe is a keeper!

I make this for every holiday.  I do a couple substitutions.  I use onions in place of leeks, I don't add celery, use sour dough bread I cubed and dried for ~3 days, and often add pinenuts, about 1/2 cup.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving. It turned out to be absolutely delicious! There are tons on flavors and spices in it to please your palate. One rule of thumb: Use extra turkey stock to keep it moist.

This stuffing is the best I have ever tasted. I used both fresh cranberries and dried cranberries, but could not tell the difference between them once it was cooked. This will be a yearly tradition for us.

I used Jimmy Dean Maple Pork Sausage instead of the Italian Sausage. I used 3 cups onions instead of 6 cups leeks. I took a lot of people's advice and left out the dried cranberries. I added 1/3 cup more chicken stock to make the stuffing more moist because it needed it. Family who did not even like stuffing before absolutely LOVED this stuffing. I used the Jimmy Dean Maple Pork Sausage because I thought it might pair well with the HoneyBaked Ham we were having and it sure did! Huge hit! Will use again for Christmas dinner! It was my first year making any holiday dinner and this recipe helped me pull it off!

I used store bought bread stuffing cubes, Jimmy Dean original sausage and onions (slightly carmelized) instead of leeks.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  It was fantastic! Just the right amount of liquid, which is so important for a good stuffing.

Excellent! This recipe did not last very long; Next time I will substitute cornbread for the white bread for a different flavor.

Great! I made it as instructed and will definitely make again. The sausage is take-it-or-leave-it, for anyone wondering.

I was looking for something other than a dessert to make for our annual Applefest and this fit the bill.  It was a huge hit, one of the first side dishes to be empty!  And quite a few comments that this was their favorite of all the sides.  Like many others, used scallions in place of the leeks, didn't measure the chicken broth, so not sure how much of that we used.  Stuck with the sweet Italian sausage.  This was amazing.  It is definitely a keeper.  And I will be making for Thanksgiving!  We made it a family event..everyone pitched in with the chopping and peeling.  So GOOD!!!!

this was absolutely delicious...even the skeptics loved it!  I made it the day before, stuffed the turkey in the morning, and baked the remaining.

The amount of poultry season was way, way too much for us.  Overpowering.  I would try this again, but would at minimum cut the seasoning in half.

I added hard apple cider for a little kick. Had a few swigs while doing it. Gives it a sweet taste
Used pineapple mango sausage as well. Drink up!
