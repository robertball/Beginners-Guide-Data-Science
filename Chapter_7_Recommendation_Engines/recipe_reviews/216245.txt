This is really quite good-- I only made it the first time because I was looking for a recipe that would use up a strange combination of ingredients in the fridge, but it turned out to be a new favorite around our house.

I'm not sure how big the sweet potatoes are supposed to be, but I've taken to only using TWO fairly large ones -- otherwise, the "soup" is basically "flavored mashed potatoes".  I recommend doubling the Italian seasoning, and I always go hog wild on the garlic-- I buy the stuff in the jar and huge add a big spoon of it.

I don't think that the original recipe mentions it, but using the half-and-half to help when you are pureeing the sweet potatoes is a good trick-- you'll get much smoother results.

This was awesome.  I usually only try recipes that have many reviews so I can read through them and decide.  But, I had 2 large sweet potatoes I needed to use and 1 pound of frozen italian sausage.  I used 3 cups of chicken broth (brought it to a boil) and placed in a crockpot.  Added the sweet potatoes, onions, garlic, 1 tsp of italian seasonings and placed the frozen sausage on top and allowed it to cook on high for 3 hours.  At 3 hours, everything was cooked.  I took out the sausage to break it up in a bowl and used an immersion blender only adding about 1/2 cup almond milk.  Added a can of mushrooms (drained), the sausage and about 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes back into the pot.  This was delicious.  My husband even commented that Olive Garden should offer this on their menu.

WOW & THANK YOU!!!! Is all I can Say! I took in mind the review about the Italian seasoning and garlic to alter slightly.  Since I was missing some things, i used 2% milk instead of the half and half, added 2 med/small white potatoes (since i didnt have enough sweet potatoes left from xmas dinner) and made my own itialian seasoning mix ( basil, organo, garlic power, red pepper, & salt.. which i made to taste). So with making the changes that i did, my husband LOVED IT as well the smell coming from the kitchen.  When I tasted the dish, it was like an explosion of taste. The sweetness then the zest from the sausage and the spices. My husband mentioned that I can make this anytime, which is good since it was easy and tasted great!!!!

This was pretty good. We don't care for sweet potatoes so I used red potatoes instead.

It was okay.  I left out the mushrooms and think the recipe could have used the texture of them.  Base was really tasty, but picture it more with crab than Italian sausage.  I also think milk would have worked fine in place of the half and half because the potatoes thicken it up nicely.  Used some chicken broth for flavor too.  Just okay ...
