Pretty good.  Very easy, which is a plus in my book.  I doubled recipe so we would definitely have enough for this to be a main dish.  I found I didn't need to double it and had a lot meat left over.  I used the crescent dough sheets, which are very user friendly.   The only thing I may do differently is to cook the potatoes a bit longer before stuffing the triangles.

It turned out great! I used a real potato cut into chunks and I should have tried harder to seal the perforations in the dough... I wasn't in the mood for barbecue so I turned it into a shepherd's pie kind of filling with canned tomatoes instead of barbecue, green beans instead of peppers, added some carrots. I got some very positive feedback from the roommates. Next time maybe I'll try a mexican or a breakfast version. Does not make for good leftovers!
