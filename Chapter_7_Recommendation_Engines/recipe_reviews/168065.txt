Ok... would have been 5 stars but I changed it substantially.  I have made this twice now for football sundays this way and I am truely suprised at what a hit it is.  first of all I double the sauce leave all ingredients the same, couple shakes of tobassco is good, I sometimes add water if the sauce seems too thick while the meatballs simmer.

For the meatballs I use a cup of bread crumbs, not rice crispies. I double the meat (2 lbs) and 2 eggs. everything else is the same.

Thats it, sound wierd, but tastes great!

These meatballs were fantastic! I made these with brown rice and it was delicious for an everyday dinner. My husband and two year old had more than one serving! The only difference I made was not using the dry milk but because I had none but it came out fine without it.
