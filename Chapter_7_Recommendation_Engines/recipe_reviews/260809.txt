I made this on a weeknight so I didn't have time to make my own broth. I prefer homemade but had to use store bought. With that being said, this soup was still excellent. You don't often see dill in chicken soups but I've always loved it in them.  I did add some red potatoes I had that needed used. If you are not carefully watching your carbs, I think potatoes or rice adds to the overall outcome of the soup. Regardless, this is 100% comfort food!

I had chicken breasts and cabbage on hand. I  put these two ingredients in the search bar and this soup came up. I  had everything else in the recipe except white pepper. It sounded delicious so I made this soup with two chicken breasts and  8 boullion cubes. Everything else was as suggested except  I used 1 1l2 Tablespoons of both the dill weed and the parsley flakes, and only 1/2 teaspoon thyme.  The result was a very delicious pot of soup that we will make again. I plan to get white pepper for the next batch. Thank you for this hearty recipe.

This was delicious! I added a bit more chicken bouillon but that's it.

I used half of the dill and next time I will only use half of the pepper that it calls for. Smells like thanksgiving in my house, yummmm! Good flavor.

Delicious seasoning combo.

I used a herbed rotisserie chicken to make stock with onions, garlic, carrots, celery, bay, black pepper, and thyme in an InstaPot.

I skeptical about the dill but it was amazing.  I wanted to add rice and all I had was a box of dirty rice. The spices in the rice added a nice heat. I would definitely make this again, with or without the rice!

Easy and very flavorful. I used chicken broth to cook the chicken in so didn't add bouillon. Didn't add dill or wine either. Love it!

This was delish. I love dill a lot and should’ve used more! I also added zucchini and maybe 4 medley mini potatoes. It’s good!
