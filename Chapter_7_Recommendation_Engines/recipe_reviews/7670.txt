This tasted GREAT!  However, I'm rating only 4 stars because the recipe requires unnecessary ingredients, namely baking soda and cream of tartar.  I thought I would see if there was a noticeable difference in flavor and/or outcome with the combination of baking soda/cream of tartar as opposed to just baking powder.  
The cream of tartar (acid) is used to activate the baking soda (which requires an acid in order to activate).  Baking powder would be easier/quicker to use and just as effective (so long as it's not expired) with equal if not better results(in my opinion).  I added a splash of vanilla and a tiny drop of almond emulsion (flavor) to the batter for some extra flavor.  Sifted powdered sugar on the entire funnel cake and served with cut strawberries and whipped cream.  My family LOVES this quick, easy, yet tasty dessert.  I made this for a diabetic friend once too - who loved it because it is made with very little sugar!  

TIPS:  I find that sifting the flour. sugar, salt, and baking powder (or soda/tartar) together - and adding the milk/egg to the flour is best.  The batter is very smooth.  Also - I recommend using a cast iron skillet to fry as the iron maintains the heat/temp better than other pans when the cold batter is added to the hot oil.

Very good recipe. However, I did add a splash of vanilla extract to the batter, and it did take a little more milk than 1 cup in order to get it thin enough to pour into the classic funnel cake shape.  This is good with the powdered sugar, or sprinkled with a cinnamon/sugar mixture.  This recipe says that it serves ten, but it actually makes about 4 large funnel cakes, which in my house serves about 7 or 8 people.  Just something to keep in mind when you are figuring how much to make :)  All in all, a good recipe!

DELICIOUS!!!!! This was fast and easy to put together-it made 2 large funnel cakes.  The size you buy at fairs, amusement parks, Epcot.... We just topped with the powdered sugar, but plan to top with apple pie filling and cherry pie filling just like they prepare at Epcot.  Can't wait to try it like that!

FANTASTIC!   Just like what you get at the fair!  I didn't have a funnel so I cut the corner of a zip-lock bag after I poured in the batter.  I found when making them to keep space as you drizzle so you do not get clumps.  I used two spatulas to make turning them easier.  When draining on a paper towel, be sure to dab the top or turn them over.  I used Crisco oil as I feel it makes food less greasy.  Thank you Sally for sharing this FANTASTIC recipe!

This was very simple to do and tasted great! I used an old chocolate syrup bottle to squeeze the batter into the oil and it worked great!

Over all I think this was a good recipe. Like the others I had to use more milk and more sugar. I also added a little cinnamon to kick it up a little and was happy with the result. I found using a squeeze bottle very helpful in cooking everything evenly.

These were so yummy! I had to add some more milk as the batter seemed rather thick. Even with the milk addition, the batter wouldn't go through the funnel, so I used the batter dispenser that comes with the "as seen on TV", pancake turner, flipper, maker thing. The cakes weren't as pretty, but just as good.

These were great!  My son had a "fair food" birthday dinner and these were the highlight!   I added 1/2 tsp. vanilla to the batter and used an empty chocolate syrup bottle to squeeze the batter into the oil.  Fun to make and eat - brought a little bit of our county fair to our home.

I did make the adjustments by adding more sugar, milk and the vanilla. They tasted great and are great alternative to paying $5 for one at the flea markets.However one thing I did not like was the fact they were not as thick as the ones I usually get. I tried them again by using baking powder instead of baking soda and added one more egg.  This made the biggest difference

For all of those that can't have gluten--you've got to try this with gluten-free flour mix! (I used Bob's Red Mill).  It will take you back to the county fair.

This recipe took me right back to the kitchen in Pennsylvania, making up a batch of funnel cakes with my mom! I can't remember the last time I made these, and my son certainly didn't remember us making them at home before, so it was quite a treat for us both!  As others have mentioned, it was too thick as written and I did add a little more milk to get that good manageable consistency so it would pour well through the funnel. I got my oil nice and hot, I used a large non stick skillet with about 1/2" of oil in the bottom and I used my large funnel to pour the batter in large circular motions. My son thought that was pretty cool! Flipping is always a little scary, but I managed (using a LARGE spatula)without too much splattering!  Since we had these for dessert, we thought we'd follow a comment I'd read and added a scoop of icecream and some strawberry topping, and that was WAY overboard in the sweet and sugar department... ugh... the cakes are fantastic just as they are with a light powdered sugar dusting and when we make these again I won't add anything else. They were really, really good - the texture was perfect, a little bit of crunch mixed with the light spongy cake with just the right amount of sweet from the powdered sugar. This is a great recipe!  I made 3 large funnel cakes using half the recipe amount which was perfect for our family.

I picked up a tip somewhere about using a clean and empty salad dressing bottle to pour the batter into the hot oil (it has to be the ones with the easy pour hole on the top).  I also added a little bit of vanilla, and the result was beyond my expectations.  We make this up whenever we entertain and serve it with fresh strawberries and icecream :)

WOW. This recipe is BETTER than funnel cakes at the Fair!! I didn't have any tarter cream so I just didn't use it and it turned out wonderful. Serve with strawberries and ice cream and you have a dessert to die for!

This was very easy and fun. My kids and I however thought they were lacking flavor except for the powdered sugar. Next time I might try adding some vanilla or a little more sugar to the batter. Other than that they were great and I will make this a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

it really changes the flavor.

Great recipe! I've tried 4 this month trying to find a good one for a fall festival and this is it :)  I left out the baking soda and cream of tartar and added 3/4 tsp of baking powder...worked great. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good.  I used 2 cups of milk and vanilla extract right off the bat because of the reviews and then found myself adding an extra cup of flour as the first batch didn't puff up right.  Next time I will follow the recipe.  I used an empty water bottle instead of a funnel which worked better for me and you can put the top on and store the rest for later.  The vanilla gave a good taste but a bit unusual for what I'm used to so I will also not be adding that next time.

I thought the recipe was great, but also added more milk so that it would flow through a funnel.  Although some people suggested using a large measuring cup or squeeze bottle, the funnel is what gives the cakes their inconsistent bumpy texture.  That's what makes it a true funnel cake ... some parts are crispier other parts doughy. Yum!

These were great! I agree with someone else who said skip the funnel, use a measuring cup. The funnel didn't work too well. Also, I had to use more than just 1 cup milk to make it thin enough. I would recommend at least a cup and a half, maybe more. I didn't actually measure what I was putting in, I just poured and stirred in the milk until it looked runny enough. I topped these with the Supreme Strawberry topping from this site. Overall, not healthy at all, but soooo good! Oh, also I added a little more sugar to the batter as well as some vanilla extract.

Obscure measurements (3/4 teaspoon? on three different measuring spoon rings, no 3/4 teaspoon here...) were slightly annoying, and I needed to add almost twice as much milk to even have a chance at getting the batter through a funnel were acceptable faults if the recipe turned out really good... which it didn't. The texture is all wrong, not nearly chewy and spongey enough. I added a bit of baking powder and that helped -- much more like what I get at the amusement park, but I think next time I've a taste for funnel cakes I'll still try a different recipe.

YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY!!! This recipie was a last-minute dessert decision and it was perfect! I already had all of the ingredients and it was so easy to make! My entire family was really impressed! The only change I would make is making two batches instead of one! Thanks for a great recipe! I'll use it again and again!

Very good -- just make sure you evenly distribute the batter otherwise your funnel cakes will be more like pancakes.

The kids loved it so much that I make up the dry ingredients in a zip-lock bag to bring camping and munch on around the fire. I add the milk and egg directly to the bag and massage it until mixed. Then just cut a hole to pour it out of. Quick and easy!! I used slightly less flour and doubled the sugar plus added vanilla sugar for flavour.

Recently I bought a funnel cake mix at the grocery store, and it was so good I later craved another.  All the stores were closed and my normally stocked kitchen was bare.  This recipe stood up to a full list of substitutions - I used mayo instead of an egg, lemon juice instead of cream of tartar, and bisquick instead of flour.  It was still lick your fingers tasty!

Very light texture, good flavor, but was too thick to use a funnel. My hubby said they tasted like Belgian waffles. This was the very same flavor and light and airy texture. This might be a great batter to try in my Belgian waffle iron. I did add about a half tsp. of vanilla to the batter. 4.5 stars for this keeper!

No more waiting for the fair. Wonderful. After making them a couple of times I did add a little more sugar and some cinnamon to the batter. Beware, they are highly addictive.

Wow you saved me ...my grandsons came to spend the night & I thought I had a box of funnel cake mix. I told them I would make some...whoops I didn't have a box. I had never made from scratch. I got on the internet found the recipe...the ingredients were simple...had everything & in minutes we had our funnel cake. They loved it...last time they had one was at the the Texas State Fair in October. They loved them & I will never buy the box mix again...thanks again...they were great!!!

They were okay, they need MORE sugar and milk.  As others have said it is really thick-it did work thick but it was harder to work with.  You have to have a glass four cup liquid measuring cup to pour out of if you don't add extra milk.  It needs extra time to even out the flow of batter so you don't get a huge glob all at once.  I cut the oil down to half and did it in a saucepan rather than frying pan.  We will make again but with more sugar.

As the family chef, I'm always looking for recipes with more "bang for your buck." This is definately one of them. It has become a household favorite, and it's so simple. The kids love them! I let them get creative with the toppings, lots of fun!

I used a lot less oil than was called for and I still think I used too much. Besides being a little oily, even after drying with paper towels, these still turned out very much like the ones you get at the fair. I used an extra half cup of milk too and served with the recommended strawberry sauce. Yummy!

I was at the 127 Corridor Sale over this past weekend (which runs right down our main road here in town) and I smelled funnel cakes..I was not willing to give $5.50 for one (when you can get them at the fair, etc for like $2.50 - $3.00) but..that did not kill my craving for one..so I happened upon this recipe. I tried them out on my family last night and they were a big hit! I never realized that they were this easy to make, and inexpensive too!!! Thank you so much

I used my largest funnel and the batter still wouldn't flow through, I finally had to pour it out from a measuring cup. I think it needed some more milk or less flour so that it would be thin enough to get it through the funnel. I first tried this recipe in a deep fryer but that was a big mistake, I ended up with little funnel pieces instead of cakes and it tasted like I was eating fish batter. The second time I tried it in a frying pan but maybe the oil wasn't hot enough because it came out flat like a pancake and the swirls of batter just blended together. The taste wasn't anything spectacular until I put a scoop of ice cream and caramel sauce on top - now that made it fantastic.

This recipe was delicious! We didn't make it to our fair so I told my children I would make them a fair-type desert. They loved them and so did I. I will definately make these again! Thanks for this recipe.

These funnel cakes were very good.  I scaled the recipe in half and it made just enough batter for 2 large cakes.  I put some cinnamon in the batter for the second one just to see if it was good and it was.

Made these last night for the kids.  They absolutely loved them!  They loved them so much they asked if we can have them every night!  I did however add a bit of cinnamon with the powdered sugar... very good!!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was so fast and easy to make, and I didn't need any special ingrediants. I had everything. These are just as good, if not better, then those that you would find at a fair.

These were great - everything you would expect from state fair funnel cakes.  However, the batter is really thick, so use your biggest funnel.

This really does taste like carnival funnel cake! I was suprised at how easy it was to make, I had always thought I'd need a deep fryer. I did have to add extra milk to get it to go throught the funnel.

I thought this was very yummy.  I had to add more milk, though, because mine was too thick.  I don't know exactly how much I added, I just poured a little milk, here and there, until it was of the correct consistency.  I also added a splash of vanilla or some extra flavor.  I had a few test cakes, to see exactly where the proper temperature setting on my stove was, but they were still good, albeit a little brown.
This is a keeper for me!  Thanks Sally!
