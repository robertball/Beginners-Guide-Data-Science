This was very good.  I never heard of jalapeno yogurt cheese, so I used 1 1/2 c. plain yogurt and a 1/4 t. of my Sister's dried, homegrown habenero.  Yahoo!  I preferred the quiche on this site I made about a week ago, Crustless Spinach Quiche (and I did add mushrooms; see my review) as I like the cheese to melt into it and Feta won't do that.  I increased all of the ingredients by 1/4, using 6 eggs.  It took one hour to bake.  I'm thinking it would go well with thinly sliced lamb.

We loved it! I just made it for a mid-afternoon meal for my college-aged kids and everyone gave it rave reviews! The only changes I made to the recipe is I used 6 eggs instead of 4. And I used regular pepper-jack cheese instead of the jalapeño yogurt cheese, since I didn't know where to find that. I baked it in a large skillet fry pan, which gave the edges a great crusty texture!  A total thumbs up!,

I doubled the recipe and cooked it in a 9x13 casserole dish.  It was the first thing all gone from the brunch table at our retreat.  I used feta and cheddar cheese instead of the yogurt cheese.

I modified the recipe to make it a little healthier. I used 6 eggs and 1/2 the amount of cheese. For the cheese, I used Publix reduced fat feta (4oz) and Cabot's 50% less fat jalapeño cheese (8oz). It was absolutely perfect!!

First time I made it I actually had jalapeño yogurt cheese . It was easy to make and the taste was great. Since then I've made this at least 20 times. Each time I use whatever cheese I have on hand, but I always use feta cheese with either pepper jack, cheddar, even mozzarella. To make it a little spicier I add either roasted hot peppers or even the oil that I use to roast hot peppers. We eat this for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Thanks for a glutin free receipe that we can all enjoy. Everyone that tried it, loves it. Leftovers go in the refrigerator and then heated up in microwave for 15 seconds and we're ready for more! I also bake it in a pie plate.

Great recipe!! Only thing I would change is the name. A crustless quiche is a frittata. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I made this for a girls get away weekend and it was loved by all. I followed the advise of others and used the pepper jack cheese rather than the yogurt cheese and it was fabulous.  We have a couple girls in the group that are eating gluten free and so this recipe worked for all, so simple to make.  I made it prior to the trip and just had to warm it up, worked out perfectly.  Served it with muffins and fruit. I had to share the recipe with all the cooks in the group.

I use coconut oil and ALL organic or non-gmo products. I also substituted Pawley's Island pimento cheese with jalapenos , Costco,instead of the yogurt. Goes great with seasoned turkey sausages.

This was my first try for anything quichey. I decided to do my own spin on it and use mozzarella with spinach, mushrooms, and a cracker crumb crust. It was - is - absolutely delicious.

This was delicious!  My family really enjoyed it.  I didn't have jalapeno yogurt cheese so I sauteed half of a jalapeno along with the mushrooms and then added some mozzarella cheese.  I also cooked it in a greased pie pan.  Yummmm.
