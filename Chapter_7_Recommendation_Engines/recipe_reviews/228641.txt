Popped way up by 20 minutes, then shrank a teensy bit by 25 minutes as it browned. I took them out at 25 because I like them still chewy on the outside. At 15 minutes, my oven was billowing smoke due to butter bubbling out on the oven floor. Next time I might put a rimmed cookie sheet underneath. I used two 6-hole cupcake tins, average size, filled 3/4 way, and got 11 popovers which we scarfed down with pea soup. I'll use this method again, and experiment with tin sizes and possibly with my antique cast iron popover pans. Thank you, Chef John

This is a great method and I have used a recipe like this for years.  My Yorkshire Mum and Aunties would not agreed but it does work.  Using this recipe, as written, mine did not POP as much as much as they usually do and I attribute that to a couple of things.  First, I usually use either Wondra flour or cake flour - also non fat milk - Cold oven and bake at 425.  The lighter the ingredients the high they will rise.  My bake time is usually about 25 minutes.  They were crispy and very tasty, just not as tall as I would have expected.  BTW - this made 9 popovers with a little batter to spare.

I made this recipe and they were the best popovers I had ever made! They popped really high; it was amazing! I love popovers, but I have difficulty getting them to pop, and these were perfect. A side-note though- I used a 6 tin popover pan, not a muffin pan, and the batter did not fill all the tins. The first time I made these, the batter filled 5 tins, and the second time, it filled 4.

I  love popovers and make them often, with varying results,but have never made this recipe before. These popped beautifully, into  fluffy balloons, actually mine looked better than the picture above! Next time I will cook a little less 24-25 mins, as they browned quickly and I like the softer pudding middle texture. I have found that if you decrease the salt, your popovers will not pop, do not not over mix, and always use room temp. ingredients( I never have that time so pop the eggs into warm water before cracking and nuke the milk for a minute on very low). I used a muffin tin for these and you never would believe that they were not out of a pop over tin, so big and puffy. Most recipes call for a pre-heated tin, so I am amazed that these worked so well.

What a great recipe!  Do not change a thing in the technique! They came out beautiful with that cold oven start, even though I was skeptical at first. I left out the cayenne pepper and cheese, but that was my personal preference. Chef John, you did it again with a great video and recipe! Thanks! You are the best! Keep those recipes and videos coming!

Struggled with making popovers before trying this recipe.  Tried it using milk and eggs brought to room temperature and I finally invested in popover pans.  I also used flour specifically for bread baking.  They came out FANTASTIC; daughter said better than the ones served at The Zodiac Room in Neiman Marcus.  Now that's a high compliment!

I was disappointed.  They didn't get big and puffy,  were small and didn't pop.  Next time I will use the glass Pyrex cups, popovers always turn out better with the glass cup.  I followed the greasing of the pan to a tee and they all stuck.  They tasted great be looked terrible.

These are great popovers with the recipe just as it is. I made these and they turned out just like those pictured. The only change I made was to use a regular size muffin pan. Made 11 popovers. In the extra muffin pan hole I filled about a third of the way with water. The second batch I modified the recipe by leaving the butter, cayenne, and cheese off, and still used regular muffin tin pan. It took 25 minutes from cold oven. Popped good! Sprinkled with cinnamon/sugar and barely drizzled with honey. Sometimes you just gotta have the sweet stuff!

These are perfection. I've tried several versions of popovers and used different methods but none match these results. The popovers rose high and cooked beautifully, just like in the video. They fell out of the pan.

I'm not quite sure how to rate this one. I'm sure something went wrong on my end. I have never made popovers before, and these did not rise much above the muffin tin, and then collapsed after I took them out. They tasted okay, kinda bland, but still good with the beef stew gravy. The inside was very eggy, reminded us of an omelette. There were very little air bubbles, quite dense.

I wonder if it's the altitude here (over 6000 ft), but I don't know what I'd have to change to fix that.

I will try this again, and play around to see if I can figure it out. They definitely tasted good! I doubled everything and there were no leftovers.

I don't know what went wrong, but these did not turn out.  I even tried them a second time, and still didn't puff as much as I would expect

First time I made pop overs and it was so easy they came out great!  They were delicious with beef stew also from Allrecipes....(Slow cooker Beef Stew IV to which I omitted the Onion Soup Mix - due to it having MSG...WTH?? lol...added additional spices, celery and some Kitchen bouquet).  Again...these pop overs are easy and delicious! 

Thank you Chef John...btw, going to try your Buttermilk Biscuits for Sunday breakfast 2mrw with some Southern Blues playin in the background.  ... oh yes.  Wohoo!

I have made these a couple times and they are very good.  I like them with swiss  cheese and  bacon bits.  They do get very dark in the oven. The first time I made them I panicked and pulled them to early, chewy but still good.  Second time I left them in and they were crunchy on the outside and soft inside. Oh so good!

You have, Sir, Chef John, enabled a proud father to make a great Sunday into a Popover Great Sunday.  We followed the recipe to the letter.  The oven timing we used was 30 minutes AFTER the oven reached 450F.   There was one accidental premature oven door opening and peeking.  But no harm was done.

My mom and grandma used to make these all the time.  Oven was smoking hot, cast iron muffin pan (which I still have and use), no problem with raising, puffing waaaaaaay up, or sticking in the pan!

When I made these I already had something in the oven & I realized while I was whisking that the oven obviously won't be cool, but they came out fine. I added basil & garlic. Definitely would make again :-)

OMG! Don't make these if you're a bread lover and you're on a diet! This recipe makes 10 regular size muffins tin cups.  They are absolutely delicious and addictive!!
I made them twice in a week.  once with nothing added and the second time I added a bit of rosemary and mozzerella cheese on top.  Both were great!

Made it to go with a Prime Rib dinner as a sub for Yorkshire Pudding. I was also trying Chef John's method for Prime Rib (which was also a huge success!), and I hadn't thought of a work around to get to the drippings. The Popovers came out beautifully! I made absolutely no changes to the recipe, other than I needed to take them out about 1 minute early. They were big, airy, tasty, beautifully browned and crispy on the outside ... I see them coming soon to a breakfast table near me! I will DEFINITELY make these again!

Very easy and very tasty. I made a batch of six then three more with the remaining batter in a regular muffin tin. The first six didn't puff up as much as the last three when the oven was warmer. The second time a made them I pre heated the oven to a lower temperature and whipped the batter more, then raised the temperature when I put them in. They really didn't rise well that time. Next time I'll mix the batter less and try a cooler oven. Still, they were light and tasty!

Popped up beautifully. I liked the fact you start with a cold oven. Brilliant.

Just tried popovers for the first time with this recipe and they were a big, puffy, light, delicious hit!  For the first batch I followed directions exactly after leaving the ingredients at room temperature for about one hour and the popovers were delicious.  The second batch the ingredients were out for about 30 minutes and the oven and popover pan were both a little warm still from the first batch and the resulting popovers rose even higher and tasted even better!  My conclusion: a no-fail recipe that is so quick,  easy and delicious that we will be making them often.  Thank you Chef John!

So easy, so good. The local steakhouse serves these as their bread course along with maple butter (6 TBS butter, softened; 3 TBS maple syrup; and 1/8 tsp salt.)

I don't recommend trying these in the toaster oven, as the tops brown too quickly.

These turned out beautifully, even though there was too much batter for my 6 muffin tin. I put the pan on a lower rack to keep them from burning on the top. The only thing that happened is I didn't grease the muffin cups enough as they did stick a bit. Otherwise delicious.

A bit disappointed..

Johns.
I filled my pans over half way full...

They had the flavor and they were simple to make but they didn’t puff like a real popover.  The biggest issue is having to have a cold oven!  If I’m making a big family dinner, I want the popovers fresh from the oven so I want to do them last not first.  So I probably won’t make these unless that’s all I’m having!

thx for the video! I would have been skeptical with the cold oven method w/out it.
started at 450, but did lower to 400 when it started to brown, for the last 5 min.  
mine didnt come out hollow, but still light and eggy with crust. we liked it serve w/gravy- really different from any american roll.

These were easy and did puff up as expected in the oven, but they were oh so bland.  Glad to learn a new technique at least.  I won't make these again.

So easy!  Mine actually got very brown very quickly  and popped up nicely. I was keeping an eye on them through the glass with a light on.  No opening the oven! Mine were getting scary dark around the 15 minute mark,  I held out til they'd been in for about 20 minutes and turned off the heat,  but left them to cook in the residual heat for the last 10. The result was perfect crunch with the perfect, just cooked custardy center!

Sometimes I whisk sour cream into the milk to equal the cup. It adds a zip to the bread. These are the most go to bread I have and fit perfect with any dish.

Best popovers I've ever made, and I've tried a number of recipes, some of them quite unsuccessful. Used a popover pan, filled each cup about 2/3's full, and this made 6 perfectly crusty yet soft-and-tender inside popovers. The 425° for 20 minutes and 325° for 15 was spot on for my oven. Will definitely use the recipe from now on.

Wonderful recipe. I followed the instructions exactly, except that (1) I warmed the milk to room temp and (2) took them out of the oven after 28 minutes instead of 30. Wow! These turned out larger than any popovers I've ever made. Good, too. Definitely a keeper recipe.

I make this all the time. I just got a new oven and thought they might not worked...it has a cooling fan and heats up quickly but they worked anyway.  I LOVE this recipe.  The only complaint is that if you want more you have to wait for the oven to cool!! LOL...they take a few minutes to throw together and before you know it you're eating the most delicious, lightest home made popovers ever!  Thank you. :)

These are hilarious. They worked exactly as stated, but I used my blender to mix the batter and muffin tins. Also, I took them out at 25 minutes because my Wolf ovens sometimes heat faster than expected.
