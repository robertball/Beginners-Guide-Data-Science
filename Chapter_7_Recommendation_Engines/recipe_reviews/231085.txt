For whatever reason, when I submitted this recipe they changed
1 (16 ounce) jar of SLICED peperoncini peppers (such as Mezzetta®)to what is shown. Also, this is a spicy pork dish.  If it is to spicy for you, use less seasoning or just the juice from peperoncini.  Experiment and make it your own.

This would have been great if I hadn't followed the recipe calling for Cavender's Greek seasoning.  This stuff is about 80% salt and 2Tbsp of it will RUIN the dish!  Go with a different brand of seasoning that contains no salt so that you can salt to taste.  Or better yet:  Search allrecipes.com for a homemade Greek seasoning recipe and make your own.

We liked this and it was a nice twist on pulled pork.  It was super easy to prepare and literally fell apart when I touched it w/tongs.  Thanks for the change of pace, 6ela!

Excellent the only thing I did different was to sear the pork before putting it in the crock pot. It enhances the flavor.

A different and delicious way to prepare a pork tenderloin.  I made 'Greek Seasoning Blend' from AR to use in this recipe.  I made in the slow cooker and had it on low for 8 hours.  It shredded beautifully and is definitely worth making again.  Thanks 6ela, for sharing your recipe.  This will be a great recipe to make at the lake this summer.

This was fantastic!!!! I must admit I was afraid of the heat so I added a large can of crushed pineapple and took most of the peppers out when they started falling apart but left some in. This will def. be made again....and I have friends that love heat so I would cook it as is for parties!!!

I love Cavender's seasoning on chicken or pork. I just sprinkled the roast all over with it and added a small jar of the peppers. It turned out wonderful with a nice flavor bit from the peppers. So easy. Served on wraps with some angel hair coleslaw and white rice. Thanks 6ela !

I used a 6 lb bone-in pork roast (butt). I did wear it well before I placed it in a Dutch oven at 300 degrees for 3 hours. The meat was very tender, but still able to be sliced and served with rice M

This pork has excellent flavor.  That being said, be careful with the Greek seasoning.  I found the suggested serving to be too much, which resulted in a strong salty flavor.  When I made it again, I only used a tsp of seasoning, then added more when it was ready to eat.  This pork goes great with sweet Hawaiian rolls and a little bit of horseradish.  My wife likes to make tacos out of them too.

Great recipe, particularly if- like me- you dislike sugared-up meat recipes. Simple and straightforward, this is nearly foolproof.

I added 5 or 6 whole garlic cloves, cut in half and studded them into the tenderloins,along with some oregano and onion powder. I also used just 1/2 a jar of whole pepperocinis that I seeded and chopped along with the Greek seasoning. It is delicious!!

It was great. Every bit as tasty as we anticipated. It was a little more spicy that I imagined because of the peperoncini peppers. I'd never had them before and they're more intense than banana peppers. So be aware of that if spicy is not what you're after, perhaps go for a more mild pepper or have them on the side. We will definitely have this again.

We did not really care for this.  I doubled the batch and had to add regular bbq sauce in order for this not to go to waste.

This was surprisingly good. Based on previous reviews, I used banana peppers (rest of family pretty heat-intolerant) and halved the cinnamon and nutmeg. Next time I'd problem use the full amount of cinnamon; the spices added an unexpected and appealing twist.

Really good! Made this as I'm always on the lookout for fast and easy recipes. Came out awesome. Cooked it on low overnight. Perfect to take to lunch. Topped it off with cucumber, soon dried tomatoes, and some feta on a pita.

Very easy to make and I love how the pork just falls apart. That said, 2tbs of seasoning is way too much. I found the dish very salty and had to do some tricks to dilute it. I will definitely make again with an adjustment to the seasoning. I loved the degree of spiciness, too. It brought a perfect amount of heat!

This is so easy. Make it in an electric pressure cooker. Some seasoning mixtures have a lot of sodium, so play that by ear or use your on combination of Greek Seasoning. You can easily cut the recipe in half or double it. I enjoyed it for a few days and then made taquitos with the rest.

Used a 12 oz jar of sliced pepperoncini and this was delicious, but too spicy for the kids- will try with mild banana peppers instead next time.

This was so good.  Made it as written, served it with seasoned rice and homemade tzatziki.  Just as good a few days later, reheated and served on a hoagie bun with more tzatziki and fresh tomatoes.  Definitely on our go to list.

This was delicious, and I don't even care that much for Greek food.  I followed the recipe as listed.  Used the AR recipe for Greek Seasonings Blend.  Served the final product on Hoagie Rolls with lettuce, tomato and mayo.  Very tasty indeed!  Will make it again, even though I was the only one in the household that liked it.
