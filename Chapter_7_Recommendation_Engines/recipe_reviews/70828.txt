I made four cakes.  One exactly per the recipe (how can you rate a recipe unless you make it exactly as written?), one with less sugar per reviews, one with more blueberries per reviews, and one with less sugar and more blueberries.  I took them to the restaurant where I work for a blind taste test with my coworkers.  The majority picked the original recipe as best, but all were wonderful and disappeared before the end of the night.  Management is thinking about adding this to our menu.  Thanks!

I'm not one to give a five easily but this recipe was wonderful!  I decreased the white sugar by about a 1/3 cup and added more blueberries (I used frozen about 1 and 1/2 cup).  When I use frozen blueberries I toss them in about 1 tbs of the flour to prevent having a purple batter.
 I made this dessert for a group of women from around the world, who have various different tastes, and EVERYONE enjoyed it.  They all asked for the recipe.

This cake is delicious. I used 1 1/2 sticks butter, 1 1/2 cups sugar and 1 ¾ cups fresh blueberries. Some reviewers mentioned it flattening out. The key is not to over mix the batter after adding the sour cream. *Gently* blend in the sour cream and then the dry ingredients.

This recipe is a traditional buckle made using pound cake like proportions.  That's the reason why everyone is finding their cake too sweet, and very dense.  The only coffee-cake aspect of the recipe is the name.  To avoid cake collapse, the wet ingredients (excluding the sour cream) need to be whipped as long as possible, then the sour cream and dry ingredients should be folded in gently by hand.  The dry ingredients should be mixed together before adding to the wet.  These types of techniques will leaven the cake a little.  To make it more a buckle and less a pound cake, use only 3/4 cup butter, 1 cup sugar and more fruit.  Otherwise, you're eating a blueberry, sugar crumbed pound cake.  Also - if you increase the fruit, and decrease the sugar/butter, expect to bake it longer to absorb the extra moisture.  I baked mine for 1 hr 30 min in a 350 oven and it was still very moist.

I made this for "snack day" at the office.  Made no changes except to cook it for less time than stated.  Absolutely wonderful coffee cake.  I was a little concerned because the batter was so thick and I really couldn’t swirl the streusel in as much as just push it down a little bit.  Beautiful recipe and everyone at the office is raving about it.  Words used to describe this cake included, “wonderful” and “divine”.  Many thanks to dmcarm.

Addendum:  I made this for Thanksgiving and froze it. As wonderful as this cake is, it didn't freeze well.  The texture after thawing was too moist and it just wasn't as good as fresh.  It was torture having it in the freezer anyway.

This made a very moist heavy coffee cake, but oh so delicious!  I cut back butter to 1+1/2 sticks (3/4 cup) as suggested by others and cut sugar back to 1 cup.  Also dusted pecans with flour before adding to cake.  Others said they collapsed cake and this old trick from my grandma works fine for that.  I did use 2 cups blueberries and a little more cinnamon than suggested.  Will make again.

Made the recipe twice: First time exactly as described (because how can you review a recipe if you don't follow it???) and second with some of the modifications suggested in the reviews + some technique tips. First cake came out almost prefect but still 5 stars - baked for 60 minutes in my convection oven using frozen berries. It was luscious BUT very sweet and some of the blueberries sank to the bottom of the pan which caused part of it to stick to the Bundt pan and therefore not unmold perfectly. Armed with suggestions from the reviews and some newly-acquired tricks from the interwebs, I was ready to try again.

Second time, I reduced butter to 3/4 cups (1 1/2 sticks) and sugar to 1 1/2 cups as suggested here. I substituted 1/2 teaspoon almond extract for the vanilla and that coordinated nicely with the pecan and brown sugar flavors. Now here comes the technique. To keep the berries from sinking to the bottom of the pan - this time I shook my frozen blueberries in a Ziploc bag of flour and shook off the excess flour in a strainer before putting them into the cake. Also, I wanted to try creating a "stripe" of blueberry goodness in the middle of the cake rather than blueberries throughout, which would also help the sticking problems. So instead of mixing the floured berries into the batter, I sprinkled them ON TOP of the cinnamon-brown sugar-pecan mixture that went in the middle of the cake.

Results: Perfection at 60 minutes in the oven and unmolded beautifully!

I made this with fat free sour cream and substituted SPLENDA for half the amount of sugar.  You couldn't tell - it was amazing, moist, and all my classmates (who I brought it to) LOVED it.  It was tough to get out of the bundt pan because the berries tend to get very gooey and stick to the pan...be careful with the placement of the berries if you can. (Try to get them toward the inside of the cake.)

This simply is the best recipe to impress your friends, not for the diet conscious. I like its heavy, moist texture, preferably the next day served cold for me.  I'm spreading the word here in Australia! I used only 1 1/2 cups of sugar...next time I'm going to put the topping on the bottom, so that when it is turned out it will have a caramel effect with the sugar.

I made this cake this morning and it turned out perfectly!  I didn't have vanilla so I used a half tsp of almond extract.  Tasted great! This cake is very sweet, so one could easily cut back on the sugar to 1.5 cups.  I used frozen blueberries, but before adding them to the batter, I ran cool water over them and let them set for 10-15 minutes.  This thawing made them taste like fresh in the finished cake.  I may try lemon extract next time, just to experiment.

PLEASE pay attention to all of the lower star ratings - because they're all true and accurate.  The cake is moist, but too moist.  It IS wet and too heavy to support itself and it DOES cave in and look like a total flop.  But it's delicious.  Boy, is it delicious, so it can be forgiven for its being unattractive (and looking like a total flop).  I was prepared to throw it out. But I tried a piece for review/ rating purposes.  And then I had another good-sized piece because I was compelled to.  And I want some more.  It's sweet and rich and buttery and cinnamony; everything our taste buds adore.

5 stars isn't enough. AMAZING. Moist, tender, tasty. I made with the exact recipe ingredients, but I didn't mix in the blueberries. Instead I coated them with flour and then spread them evenly in the middle layer, along with the cinnamon and sugar. Topped with rest of blueberries not put in middle layer and then sort of pushed them into the batter with a knife. Then topped with rest of cinnamon and sugar mix.  The whole family LOVED this. I'm a cake decorator, and  I have picky eaters who are used to eating the best, most moist cakes, and they LOVED this!! THANKS

DIVINE!!!  I am eating my slightly too warm first piece right now.  I didn't have any frozen blueberries on hand so I used a frozen berry medley mix and it's delicious.  I also omitted the pecans because the husband doesn't like nuts.  I let it cook an additional 12 minutes since I used frozen berries and it turned out perfect.  I realized after all was said and done that I did not have any powdered sugar to dust on top - which is fine since this is just for my sweetie and I, but if you're serving this to others, I think the powdered sugar would be a nice addition.  I also sifted together the flour, baking powder and salt before adding it to the batter.

This is one delicious cake.  I've made it three times...the first two in the bundt pan and had a very difficult time getting it out in one piece.  The third time was a winner in a 9 x 13 pan, and that's the way I'll make it in the future.  Wonderful recipe!!

I would give this cake 10 stars if I could. Seriously delicious. Took others suggestions and used 1 cup sugar, 3/4 cup butter and added more blueberries. Disappeared  quickly at work. Just a suggestions with the blueberries. Put them in a zip lock baggy with some flour and shake them so they don't sink in the cake. Will definitely make again!!

OK..I've made this twice.  It has all things I love in it, so I've tried it twice... but I've been disappointed in it both times.  Granted, my guests, the first time I made it....devoured it.  BUT, I could almost see it sinking into itself.  The ingredients are so heavy that the cake couldn't seem to hold itself up.

This would have been wonderful if it had risen in the middle.  I doubled the recipe and baked it in a very large glass dish--about 12x15--don't know if my oven is not hot enough, and it needed a higher temperature or what.  It was delicious around the edges and was good but kind of gooey in the middle.  I baked it a long time!  But maybe not quite long enough??  Anyway--will try again, as it was really delicious, and everyone really liked it, but if I double it, think I might try baking at 375 degrees instead of 350.  Update:  tried again in smaller pan (9x13), and it still was sunken in the middle.  So I don't know what to do with this coffee cake.  Maybe it's too rich, with all the butter and sour cream, to hold up??  Don't remember reading reviews where other people had this problem.  Almost think I'll go back to my old recipe.  Might give it one more try though.  Maybe try decreasing the butter a little?  And I think I'll bake it in a bundt pan.

Really great cake.  Made two.  The first one just as listed. It was good but definitely very sweet, so the second one I made I adjusted and I liked it better.  Using others' recommendations, I lowered the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and used a total amount of 1 3/4 cup flour.   This definitely helped it be not mushy moist like the first one.  In addition to the vanilla, I used orange oil (didn't have extract) -use less oil than extract if you have it-it's stronger than extract, and I used the zest, snipped small, from one orange.  Then I used about 3 cups of frozen blueberries (medium size).  I thought it would be good to have the presentation of the streusel on top of the cake when you flip it, so I put that down in the bundt pan first, I didn't worry about swirling at all, it wasn't necessary and the batter really is too thick anyway to do that.  I had to bake it for about 90 minutes with frozen blueberries-just keep an eye on it after 75 minutes.  I let the second one get golden brown, now I will say, I thought it was a little overdone when I tipped it upside down after about 5-10 minutes (wanted to serve it warm) from coming out of the oven.  But when we tasted it, it was fine and it just kinda carmelized the streusel.  It came out better than the first one (stayed together better) too.  I did not add a glaze or p. sugar, the presentation was fine and everyone loved it.

Yesterday I baked this cake in a 9X13 insulated pan.  Although the tester came out clean, the cake was gooey in the middle.  Today I tried again (I'm supposed to bring a cake to a picnic today.)  I made the following changes and the cake turned out great.  Use a 9X13 glass pan.  Metal tends to interact with the acid in the berries.  Use "bakers buttermilk" instead of sour cream.  This will make the batter lighter and easier to fold in the berries.  To make the "buttermilk:, put 1 T white vinegar into a one cup meauring cup.  Fill to line with milk.  Let stand 5 minutes.  Stir.  After you have beaten the life out of the butter and sugar and eggs (I used 1 and 1/2c each) fold the sifted dry ingredients into the batter alternativly with the milk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Use TWO t. baking powder. You may  need a bit more flour to get a smooth texture.  Bake 45 to 55 minutes.  I put most of the filing in the middle and just sprinkled the rest lightly on top. If you put only 1/3 of the batter on the bottom you'll find it easier to get the top layer on easily.

DON'T do what I did, and hesitate to use the brown sugar mixture. I thought maybe i'd just want a simple blueberry cake, but then I caved, and thought I should follow the recipe exactly as it should be. I'm so glad I did!! The brown sugar mixture adds a hint of caramel flavor, and I used almonds because I'm a dork and started the recipe without checking to see if I had pecans :-) Unbelievably moist, we gobbled it without even the powdered sugar on top.

GREAT coffee cake. I did what others suggested and decreased the butter to 3/4 cup and sugar to 1 1/2 cups as well as increased the blueberries to 1 1/2 cups. Very moist and received a lot of compliments.

I used 1 cup of fresh blueberries which I dusted with a little flour so they would not sink to the bottom of the pan while baking. I gently folded in the blueberries and the batter came together thick but fluffy. I followed the ingredients, directions, layering of brown sugar/cinnamon/pecans and baking time to a “T”. I baked the coffee cake for 55 minutes and then let it cool for half hour. I dusted the cake with powdered sugar before serving. This is a delicious coffee cake layered with fresh blueberries baked in every bite! The cake itself is heavy but moist, buttery and flavorful. The chopped pecans add good texture to the cake. And the layers of brown sugar/cinnamon give an even more sweetness to the cake. To top it off, the powdered sugar contributes a nice touch and good visual presentation! This is a sweet moist coffee cake but it is definitely NOT healthy. If I were to make this again I might cut back on the sugar to 1 ½ cups, add more blueberries and maybe ¾ cups of the butter.

EXCELLENT taste, perfect consistency, nice and moist but still firm. Only complaint was the brown sugar mixture on the top (bottom) of the cake...I didn't use nuts, don't like them, but swirled the brown sugar into the cake as instructed. Top (bottom) became very crusty compared to the cake, which I didn't like. Still tasted fine, wasn't inedible, just I think next time I would put the brown sugar in two layers through the cake rather than in the middle and bottom.

I made this to go with breakfast this morning and loved it! but most importantly my picky husband loved it too. I made it in a 9x13, used choped almonds for the pecans and put all the nut sugar mixture on top. the cake was moist and flavorfull and the topping was crispy and sweet. I will make this again..... mabey try other fruits too.

I've made this recipe 3 times and each time it flopped.  It rises as it bakes and when it's almost done it falls.  The "mess" tastes quite delicious but I can't seem to get it right.  What am I doing wrong?  I've followed the instructions very carefully.

Made this for a big gathering yesterday morning & it got rave reviews all around. As suggested, did 2 C. of berries, 1.5 C sugar and sprinkled some of the cinnamon streusel in the bottom of Bundt pan.  I also made a Lemon Glaze as I LOVE lemon - was a great addition.  Made with 3 T fresh lemon juice, 1 C. confectioners sugar - brushed and poured all over the cake.  DELICIOUS!!!

Oh yummy yum yum! The first time I made this, I followed the recipe to a T. The second time, I used 1/2 c. oil+ 1/2c. applesauce instead of the butter and used 1.5 c. frozen mixed berries. I would DEFINITELY recommend using mixed berries instead of blueberries because the tartness is absolutely DELICIOUS! Everybody loved this recipe. 5/5.

Unfortunately, I did not like this very much when made exactly as written. But the second time I made some adjustments and LOVED it. Instead of 1 cup of butter, I used 3/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce and 1/4 cup softened butter. Instead of 2 cups white sugar, I used 1 cup. I kept the brown sugar amount the same. I used double the amount of blueberries called for and used a dash of nutmeg along with the cinnamon. I also added 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. Oh, and I also used walnuts in place of pecans, but that's just because that's all I had on hand. Delicious!!!

Was so delicious! Used walnuts instead of pecans b/c that's what I had on hand. Turned out great. Topped with a vanilla glaze. Took to work and it was all gone!

I have made this twice, first time following the recipe to the letter (four stars!) and the second time I made a few healtier changes, and I honestly think it was better!  Instead of the 1 cup of butter, I used 1/2 C unsweetend applesauce and 1/2 C Mazola Canola oil.  I used half white flour and half wheat flour and light sour cream. I used 1 cup of fresh blueberries and 1 cup of thawed and drained frozen blackberries. I cut the white sugar in the batter to 1 cup and doubled the brown sugar and cinnamon (but not the nuts) in the streusel mixture.  I used a Baker's Secret bundt pan, and sprayed it well with Pam for baking (it has the flour in it) and the cake released from the pan beautifully!  The cake was still very moist and dense and plenty sweet enough with a few healthier substitutions!  Thanks for this recipe, I will make this again and again!

After reading many of the 500 plus reviews for this recipe, I decided to give it a try - am I glad I did! Even with a small 'mis-step' on my part, it is OUTSTANDING - one of the most delicious cakes I've ever baked/tasted. I used 1-1/2 sticks of "Imperial", 1 cup of 'lite' sour cream, 1 tblsp of lemon juice and 2 cups of frozen blueberries, (tossed in a little flour). I misread the sugar quantity, thinking that the total of white and brown was 2-1/2 cups going into the cake. Since many suggested reducing the sugar, I put slightly over 1 cup of white sugar in with the margarine, then added 1/2 cup of brown sugar and creamed it together! It wasn't until I read further that I realized the 1/2 cup of brown sugar was to make the crumble that gets swirled into and on top of the cake batter! I was really concerned that I had ruined the whole thing, but I kept going; just measured out another 1/2 cup of brown sugar for the swirl... (I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, along with the pecans and cinnamon.) Let me tell you again - the result is AMAZING! Moist, light, flavorful and delicious! I feel bad for those who weren't successful because I know that feeling, too. When I make this again, I'll be sure to make the same 'mistake' by using both white and brown sugar to the make the batter. (May I also say that I'm grateful to anyone who provided the many tips that were really helpful to me - like the additions of lemon juice, nutmeg and flouring the berries.)

So, so good. We loved this. I used 3/4 C butter, 1 1/2 C sugar & no pecans. BTW, 5/8 C = 1/2C + 2T. This cooked for 60 mins. Thanks!

This was one of the most delicious coffee cakes I've ever had!  I didn't have a smaller Bundt pan, so I used a 9-inch  Springform pan and it worked very well.   Sent it to work with my husband, and it disappeared in a day, then I spent a week getting copies of the recipe to all his co-workers.

Absolutely delicious!! Only had 1/2 cup of butter so I added 1/2 cup butter flavored crisco. I won't dare to make this too often as I will eat too much. I would rate it more than 5 stars if I could.....

This is just too, too good.  Could hardly stop eating it.  Did double the blueberries and it seemed like the right amount.  Will definitely make again.  Reduced the butter to 3/4 cup, reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and used walnuts because that was all I had on hand.  Also made in 9 x 13 pan as suggested by many people.  Not all that easy to spread in the pan but well worth the effort.  Kept checking for doneness because I knew it would not take the 60 minutes.

This was excellent.  I used a few more fresh blueberries and used 1 1/2 cups of sugar and it was still too sweet for me. The next time, I will use only 1 cup of sugar and I am sure it will still be a five star. Since I only had a large bundt pan, I thought putting it in an angel food pan would be okay.  I did not think ahead.  The cake needs to be inverted so the berries will be on top.  Removing my cake, it cracked . Inverting the cake makes it perfect and no tendency to become soggy from the berries.  Learned my lesson. Will make again soon.

I was short on two ingredients so I only used 1 1/4 cup sugar and about 3/4 cup sour cream.  I didn't have any pecans and didn't think it needed powdered sugar, so I omitted both of those.  It still turned out great and when I make it again, I'll probably do the same thing just because I know it will turn out.  The cake is super moist and delicious.  I didn't find it overly sweet, which may be because of the 3/4 cup less sugar I used, but I suspect those who thought it was too sweet were reacting to the brown and powdered sugars.  For the people whose cakes fell apart when unmolding, try letting it cool completely before flipping the pan over.  Some cakes only need to cool 10 minutes before removing, but this isn't one of them.

This cake was a real hit with my friends!  The combination of moist blueberry cake with the sweet cinnamon sugar and peacans swirled through is a real treat.  I served with thick cream and strawberries just to be extra naughty.

This barely made it through the weekend.  It was wonderful!  I did make the following changes:
1.  I ran out of sugar so used:  3/4 c. granulated sugar + 1 1/4 c. Splenda
2.  For the Sour Cream:  6 oz. Plain Greek Yogurt + 2 oz. light sour cream
3.  I used UNSALTED butter
The only difference is that the cake could have handled an extra 10 minutes in the oven, but it was wonderful anyway!  Thanks for sharing!

I have a couple tips that make it so much easier.
1.  cream the butter with 1 cup of sugar first , then add the second cup.
2.  Bake in a 9x13 because the bundt pan takes too long
But all in all 1000 times better than the first recipe I tried (but the first time i used a bundt pan and it didnt cook evenly).  You dont have to make any changes and the blueberries make all the difference in the world.  My dad couldnt stop eating it.

This really didnt pass my usual greatness test - and not because of the recipe, but my own doing.  I did not use enough flour, and the cake came out a little too "spongy" for my taste, although my son and husband loved it.  It looks pretty (see picture), and I will have to give it another whirl...with more flour.

just made this, and it was excellent!  Followed the recipe, except used a little less butter and white sugar than called for.  Used fresh blueberries, a little more than a cup.  Had hungry people waiting, so didn't let it cool very long in the pan before inverting, but it still came out great (make sure and butter and flour the pan WELL).
Tastes like a really great brown sugar/pecan coffee cake...but filled with big, fresh blueberries!
Will definitely make again, and would recommend the recipe.

I lightened this up quite a bit.  I used Splenda, and cut that back to a cup and a half, fat free sour cream, and light margarine.  It was still really good.  I used walnut s instead of pecans because that's all I had.  I also used almost an entire bag of frozen blueberries. I only have a ten inch bundt pan, so the cake wasn't very high, but it didn't make a difference.  My husband and I ate half of it in one sitting.  Excellent!

I've made a lot of coffee cakes, but this is the best one I've ever had. Unbelievably moist, absolutely delicious. I didn't alter the recipe at all, I don't know why anyone would except I can't wait for huckleberry season to try it with those.

Make sure to leave a good amount of the pecan brown sugar mix for the top of cake.  It gets crispy and makes this cake even more delicious.  The recipe worked well for mini bundt cakes.

Awesome cake! I made it for a group and everyone had seconds. My blueberries were frozen and it took about 15 more minutes to bake. I will be making this again in the near future.

FABULOUS! I can't say enough good things about this recipe. It was simply delicious. Very moist and flavorful. However, make sure to grease and flour your bundt pan thoroughly or it will stick. I doubled the blueberries and it was wonderful. Baked for a full hour and drizzled with simple white icing.

This cake is SUPER MOIST and addictive.  It is dense in a good way meaning it's very filling.  It is perfect to cut into slices, wrap and share with others!

This recipe is just wonderful...if I could give it more than 5 stars I would!!  I cut a small slice when it came out of the oven and it was good...put it in the frig and may kids found it and it was gone in like 2 hours!!  Really is good cold!  I did what others had suggested and but the brown sugar mixture on the bottom of the pan.  When I inverted it, what was left in the pan, I just scooped it up and but back on the top of the cake!!

This cake was delicious! I followed the recipe to the letter.. no omissions or additions. The first time doing a recipe, i like to try it exactly the way its written. I bought it in to work and my coworkers loved it, i made one for home and my family devoured it in 2 days! The final test was down in Va to my parents house, well they absolutely adored it and i was told that was now my addition to Thanksgiving every yr! Thanks again for such a delicious moist sweet dessert!

Moist and delicious. Served warm/room temperature can crumble some on slicing. Would recommend chilling in fridge to firm up for best slicing.

Made this for 4th of July morning parade party - the whole gang went CRAZY for it!  Two modifications - used TWO cups of frozen then thawed blueberries - and tossed them in a pile of flour so they didn't bleed. Will make this MANY times.

I made this twice. Once exactly following the recipe then again making the alterations I thought it needed. This cake is amazingly yummy but the recipe was terrible (sorry! But more sugar than flour?!?)I decreased the white sugar to 1 cup, the brown sugar to 1/4c, and the butter to 3/4c. I increased the flour to close to 2c and the baking powder to 1 1/2t. Next time I'm going to separate the eggs and stiffly beat the egg whites. Hopefully this will make the cake lighter. I give the cake 5 stars for taste, but 3 stars overall because the recipe didn't work as written

This is an excellent dessert for a Sunday brunch, or potluck. I followed the recipe exactly (except I left out the pecans because I don't care for nuts in my food) and my cake came out incredibly moist and had wonderful flavor. I blended my wet ingredients well before adding the sour cream, and afterwards was careful not to over-mix. Try measuring out all ingredients first (if you have enough bowls) and prepare what mixtures you can beforehand -- It somewhat helps to reduce your risk of over-mixing the batter. I used frozen blueberries because that's what I had on hand, but I reserved a little of the flour and coated the blueberries to prevent that yucky green color and it worked like a charm. This is already a very sweet dessert, so go light on the brown sugar filling and powdered sugar dusting. I baked this at 350 for 60 minutes in a Bundt pan coated in some Baker's Joy and it was perfect. I'll definitely keep this recipe on hand in my dessert rotation.

Wonderful recipe. Took it to a breakfast meeting for college and it was gone 5 minutes after I set it out (no one touched the donuts). I agree that a springform pan helps. Also, people that are getting gooey results should turn up the oven a bit and make sure to let the blueberries dry after rinsing them before adding them to the batter (there’s more moisture there than you think).

Sadly, this has now been dubbed the "3 hour coffee cake".  It took that long to bake completely.  Had to remove it from the bundt pan, cut into slices and bake on a cookie sheet to get some level of doneness. What should have been a delicious cake turned out bizarre.  The recipe needs to be clarified and adjusted to meet a longer baking length.  The temp should likely come up to 375 degrees as well.

Because of comments made, I used a spring form pan. It worked great. It had great taste and looked great too. Very rich and moist. Thanks!

Oh my goodness, this was amazing! I only made very slight alterations, but this was one of the best "cakes" I've ever made. I did not include any pecans b/c I'm allergic to nuts, I added a little less butter and white sugar, and almost doubled the blueberries. I should have let it cook another 5 minutes, but it was so moist and delicious it didn't matter! I made it for brunch with my friends and even one who doesn't like blueberries loved this! The best part was the crunchy cinnamon/brown sugar, so make sure to swirl well. Delicious!

I have made this recipe 8 times. Everyone who tried it loved it. Tried it once with raspberries ... too mushy. Made it once with dark, sweet cherries ... awesome, but pitting and slicing cherries is time consuming. Made it with and without the powdered sugar, and once with a vanilla glaze. I always use extra large eggs, so I increased the flour to 1-3/4 cups. All of my variations were good, but in the end, the original recipe seems to be the best. Use fresh blueberries and don't over stir the batter when adding the sour cream. Let it cool completely in a greased and floured bundt pan before turning it out on a plate.

Update 10/21/19: The original recipe is still best. I now make it with a lemon glaze (1 tsp melted butter, 1/4 cup fresh squeezed lemon juice, 1 3/4 cup powdered sugar) and my co-workers request it every time we have a carry-in.

WOW! This was fantastic! Made as directed using frozen blueberries.  I had to cook it for about an hour and a half before the knife came out clean, probably due to the frozen berries.  I also used my angel food cake pan since I don't have a bunt pan.  I lined the bottom with parchment paper then greased it and the side with generous amount of butter...came out no problem.  A huge hit at our Christmas brunch.  Thank you!

Absolutely delicious!  I made two of these yesterday: one for a dessert for a get-together (in a Bundt pan) and one in a 9" x 13" pan for breakfast for us the next day.  I used low fat sour cream in both and the taste is unaffected. (Kind of silly when you have two sticks of butter, but oh well!) Fresh blueberries are the best and provide a "cleaner" look, but frozen are good too. Thank you "d" for the recipe!  My new favorite go-to blueberry recipe.  (And I'm a chocolate lover!)

WOW!! This is phenominal!! Our family's new favourite.  A perfect blend of ingredients. Pleasantly sweet, light and moist, with a cinnamon layer / topping that knocks it right out of the ball park. Heavenly. I didn't swirl the cinnamon layers through the thick batter, but I don't think it needs it. I used Baker's Joy liberally to prep the bundt, and cooled the pan after baking for 10 minutes in the sink on top of a towel saturated with steamed water. It released easily. Baked in 60 minutes in my oven.

This had a fabulous taste. I used 1 1/2 fresh blueberries. The batter was sweet and I had high hopes. Unfortunately, the cake collapsed a bit and wasn't cakey. The taste shined. Some reviews said not to over mix after putting in the sour cream and maybe that is what I did wrong. I will make this again and try to get it right because it is a very flavorful cake.

This cake was delicious. I followed others advice and used less sugar (1.5 cups) and less butter (1.5 sticks) and more blueberries (1.5 cups or so). To me this was a blueberry cinnamon pound cake. Very dense, buttery and moist. Heavy for it's size. I used frozen blueberries, no sugar added. IMPORTANT: Do NOT thaw your blueberries. It turned out perfect. I dusted it with powdered sugar just for looks. NOTE: Flour measurement 1 5/8 = 1.5 cups plus 2 tbls.

Fabulous coffee cake.  I followed the suggestions about using 1 1/2 sticks butter, 1 1/2 cups sugar and an extra 1/2 cup or so of blueberries.  I put all of the batter in the pan and then sprinkled all of the topping on the top instead of layering because I baked it in a 9x13 pan. (That's what I had on hand.)  Took about 10 minutes less time to bake and smelled wonderful.  My sister and her family were visiting for the weekend and we all thought it was very good.  While my brother-in-law was looking over the recipe he noticed I forgot to put on the powdered sugar.  It didn't need it.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

I used low-fat sour cream, omitted the nuts (don't like nuts in my food!), used half margarine and half butter and used splenda in place of real sugar.  It was very easy to prepare and it took every bit of an hour to bake - but I also used frozen blueberries. It was good but I didn't think absolutely wonderful.  Thanks for sharing!

Good cake.  I baked it in a 9x13 pan and it didn't make a very big cake. (A little bit flat.)  Next time will use bundt pan.  Thanks, DMCARM.

Excellent recipe! I decreased the sugar by about 1/3 cup as other reviewers suggested and I decreased the sour cream by about 1/4 cup.  I also used walnuts instead of pecans as I tend to have those on hand more often.  They work great as well.  Thanks so much for this recipe.  I will definitely be making this again.

I made this and the only change was to add extra blueberries.  My experience was similar to another person who rated this recipe.  The cake fell in on itself and was way too heavy and too sweet.  It seemed like it was way too wet.  More appropriate to serve as a cobbler with ice cream.  Way too sweet for me - won't make it again.  And what's with the 1 5/8 cup of flour - who even has a cup that measures 1/8 th?

I made this because it is "blueberry season".  I used fresh blueberries and increased them to 1 1/2 cups, but would make it again with only 1 cup of blueberries.  The batter was very moist, but the cake would not release from the bundt pan, even though it was properly prepared. The "broken" cake was quickly finished and there was a request for another one before blueberry season is over.  Oh, by the way 1 5/8 cups of flour actually comes out to 1 1/2 cups plus 1 Tablespoon of flour.

AMAZING!!!  Perfect in every way just the way it is!  all kept moaning with delight and commenting on how yummy it was.  I made it for my husband and kids for Father's Day and they I will be making this over and over again.  The only change I did make was using almonds instead of pecans, since that is all I had, but I know it would be just as divine with the pecans.  You HAVE to make this recipe!

Delicious! I also added extra blueberries because I just love them so much. You do need to add extra time if you use frozen blueberries. Very dense cake. Sometimes I add an extra 1/2 tsp of baking powder to make it a bit fluffier.

The cake was really good. I am reviewing it based on the changes that I made to it.
I cut the sugar to half a cup, instead of 1 cup of butter I used 1/4 cup of olive oil,  1 cup of yogurt plus 1 tsp of baking soda instead of sour cream, 2 cups of blueberry and 1 Tb sugar instead of 1/2 cup brown sugar.

This was great! But definitely needed to be baked longer than it calls for. I had to put it back in for almost 20 more minutes... and at that it still wasnt completely cooked in the middle! But once it was... boy did it taste wonderful :-)

I made this for a business breakfast meeting and it was impressive looking as well as yummy.  I used fresh blueberries from our local farmer's market.  I think it would be impossible to eat only one piece of this moist, delicious coffee cake, which makes this recipe dangerous!

This cake was delicious & had a nice, dense texture.  I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 c. & added more blueberries 1 1/2 c. Unhealthy, yes, but I will be making this again.

Really, very good.  I think fresh berries work best but off season thawed berries should be just fine.  Toss frozen berries with some of the flour so they don't clump together.  I added some fresh grated lemon zest to the batter and used a little xxx sugar glaze, also with lemon zest, over the top.  The glaze was more for a finished appearance than anything.  I think the lemon zest really adds something!

This recipe is a great place to start if you want to go a bit healthier with it. Try "slimming it down" by:  Sub 2 C of sugar with 1/2 C of brown sugar  Sub 1 C butter with 1/2 C butter and 1/2 C apple sauce  Sub 2 C sour cream with 1 C sour cream 1/2 C apple sauce  Boost blueberries to 2 C  What a great treat it made and I promise you it's sweet enough!

Followed directions, but used a 9" springform per several of the reviews. The cake didn't bake AT ALL in the middle. After 65+ minutes of cooking, there was a thin crust and a liquid filled middle.

WOW.  I wish I could give 6 stars.  Thanks for sharing!  PS - I used diced fresh strawberries instead of blueberries because that's what I had on hand.  I'm sure it'd be phenomenal with ANY fruit.

I made this exactly per the instructions, and it turned out beautifully!! The recipe notes that frozen blueberries require more cook time, and they weren't kidding. I cooked it for an extra 30 minutes with frozen blueberries. I brought it to work almost two weeks ago and I still have at least 1 person a day ask me to make it again. I have had 3 people say it is "the best" cake they have ever had! I plan to make this all the time.

I changed this recipe slightly.  I used fresh picked blueberries and doubled the amount.  I baked in a 9X13 pan and omitted the layering and the nuts.  I sprinkled the brown sugar on top just before baking.  Much easier and just as tastey.

Thank you to all of you who have written such kind reviews. To those of you having trouble w the recipe, perhaps the problem is frozen blueberries. Sometimes it's very difficult to complete the baking because the cake is so thick in the bundt pan and the berries keep the internal temp too low.  Perhaps a 9x13" pan would solve the problem.  Has anyone frozen leftover (like there ever are any)? I'm wondering how it handles the freezer. Again, thanks for the love. dmcarm/newman

Wonderful recipe!! I used nonfat yogurt instead of sour cream since that is what I had on hand.  Also reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  Kept everything else the same and baked in 9x13 in pan.  VERY MOIST- wonderful.  I brought it to work for a baby shower and it got rave reviews.  I might add lemon rind as other reviewers did next time and reduce the sugar even more.  Great great recipe- I highly suggest you make it!

UPDATE... I made it again, this time with fat free sour cream and reduced the sugar by half and substituted almonds for the pecans.  The texture was much more dense- several people asked if it was made with cream cheese.   
SO for a more "cakey" texture I would use fat free yogurt- for a dense texture- sour cream....either way, a wonderful recipe!

This was outrageously good!  It disappeared at work.  I used 1 1/2 sticks of butter, 1 1/2 cups of sugar, and added some grated lemon zest to the batter.  I also used sliced almonds instead of pecans.

Every time I am asked to bring a dessert I am requested to bring this one.  Everyone loves it, especially my fiance.  One recommendation I have though is that you use a 9x13 baking pan instead of a bundt cake pan.  The juice from the blueberries and the brown sugar tend to cause the cake to stick to the bundt pan when you try to remove it.

I made this for a 2nd time last night. My first try didn't go so well but this time I would rate this cake a 10 star if it were an option. I'm not sure what I did differently but this was soooo good. A little dense like a pound cake and delicious! I think it tastes better after being refrigerated overnight.

Very delicious and moist!! A bit too sweet but still good! After reading reviews saying that it was too gooey even after baking for an hour, i decided to bake for the required hour, turn off the oven and let it sit in there for about 2-3 hours! it came out perfect!

Using a bundt pan I followed the directions to this recipe carefully. I let the cake cool for 45 minutes. It flopped while cooling. The botton of the cake wasn't cooked. It smelled wonderful while it was baking tho...

I have made this coffeecake several times, and have had the problem of it being too moist, almost goopy, and have had to bake it for additonal time (up to a half hour longer), but it is such good cake, I just kept making it!  Today I experimented with substituting half of the sugar with Splenda (1 c. sugar, 1 cup Splenda).  I have found in other recipes that Splenda tends to make baked goods drier.  This worked perfectly!  I made the recipe exactly as directed except for this substitution, and it baked in about 65 minutes to perfection.  Everyone loved it this way, because now they could eat twice as much for the same number of calories (well, almost!)  Try this and see if it works for you.

I was so excited to make this recipe for I have made so many wonderful things on this website! My 8yr old son and I were in the mood to bake and we had some blueberries so we thougt we would give this a shot! We followed the directions to the T. The batter was very thick! Almost like a dough for there really arent any 'wet' ingredients other than the eggs, sour cream is pretty thick. When it was baking it smelled soooo good. We took it out of the oven, turned it over to cool on a rack and half the cake was still in the pan!! I greased it good with crisco and flour and the whole thing stuck! I baked it for over an hour for it did not look done. The entire inside of the cake was like dough, it never really cooked. It was a horrible mess! We wasted a lot of ingredients. My son was so upset. Kids love to taste what they made. We threw the whole thing away. Oh well scratch this one from my recipe box.

This is cake is delicious, my husband loved it, but the first words out of his mouth were "it needs more blueberries".  I agree.  Next time I will increase the recipe by at least 1/2 cup.

Wonderful!! Cut down sugar to 1 cup as others suggested and it still tasted perfect. Used frozen blueberries and baked for 65 minutes total. When using frozen be sure to immediately place batter in bundt pan otherwise dough will "freeze" from blueberries and is a little more difficult to get into pan. Still turned out perfect, everyone loved it!

First of all, greetings from Germany! This cake was great. I made it for coffee when my daughter and son-in-law came over to bring me the grandchildren for the weekend and I thought it would be good to have some cake for over the weekend. Forget it! The cake was finished in about 30 minutes! After reading other reviews before I made it I did use only 1 cup of white sugar, used walnuts instead of pecans and I put in almost 2 cups of frozen blueberries. This will be one of my favorite cakes. Thanks alot!

Though I had great hopes for this recipie, I was greatly disappointed at how sweet and sugar-filled this one was. Blueberries and sourcream sound great together, but half the sugar might improve it.  The cake was quite heavy and tasted like we were eating spoonfuls of sugar.

A definite keeper.  Followed the directions exactly for ingredients but I did not add the powdered sugar to the finished product.  Used Splenda for the sugar and light sour cream.  Took it to work and I did not even get a piece it was gone so fast.  Thanks DMCARM

I have already made this cake twice in one week.  The last time I made it our guests just couldn't get enough of it. This is a really delicous cake. I didn't use as much butter as called for and used Splenda instead of sugar. Also didn't use as much steusel mix as recipe calls for. Generally American's seem to have a sweeter tooth than us!

OK !  This one is it!  I love this recipe.  I did add a bit more blueberries.  My husband took the whole 13 x 9 pan to work and when he came home the pan was clean (someone washed the pan so I can make more for the next day).

This cake turned out pretty good although if I were to make it again I would cut back the sugar from 2 cups to maybe 1 1/2 or less it was super sweet. Yes, it was very moist, almost too moist which gave it a slightly uncooked appearance.

Wow, what a flavorful, moist and delicious cake! Due to allergies I had to leave out the nuts, so I made a nice cinnamon crumb topping using butter and flour and then dusted with confectioners sugar. Loved by all!!!!

Way, way, too heavy! Falls in on itself within a short time of pulling it out, and that was even after leaving it in for 20 extra minutes to get my tooth pick to come out clean. Once cooled and cut, it had that fallen, too thick, too heavy, too moist consistently. I was going to throw it out, but my three teenage boys were still willing to eat it... Of course, they would also eat the table, so that's not really a vote of confidence.

Good flavor....but wet and heavy once cooked.  My husband loved it.  I actually thought it would be a lighter textured cake and was very disappointed once it cooled and was cut.  I did decrease the amount of sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  When a recipe calls for a lot of sugar, I usually decrease the amount  called for.  I didn't change anything else.  I did use frozen blueberries and noticed that once I added them the batter became thicker.  I don't know if the frozen berries could have made the difference in the texture.  I'm thinking about giving it another try but using fresh blueberries to see if that makes a difference.  Overall  good flavor but not certain I would recommend. :-(

I made two cakes exactly according to the directions and had no problems.  Be sure to grease and flour your bundt cake pan before proceeding with the recipe.  I mixed the sugar and butter together until it was very light and fluffy -- about 5 or 6 minutes -- before adding the eggs, one at a time.  I folded in the flour mixture and the sour cream until just mixed; then added the blueberries.  I used fresh blueberries.  My one complaint is that the batter is so thick that it was not easy to "swirl" the streusel mixture on top into the cake, so the last layer of streusel ended up being a little crunchy on the bottom of the slices of cake.  Next time I make this (and there will be a next time), I will put down 1/3 of the batter, top with half the streusel, add another 1/3 and the rest of the streusel, then top with the remaining batter.  I baked mine for about 65 minutes before the toothpick came out clean.  I do not like dry cakes and check my cakes about 5-6 minutes or so before the minimum time listed to be sure they're not over-baked.  I also like to pull out my cakes when moist crumbs are clinging to the toothpick.  I'm not sure that is even an issue with this cake!  After reading about centers that weren't completely cooked, I waited until the toothpick was clean and my cakes were perfectly baked, moist and delicious.  I let them cool in the pan for 15 minutes before inverting onto a serving platter, where I let them cool completely.

I made this cake today with my 9 year old son who loves anything with blueberries.  I followed the directions exactly and baked it in a bunt pan.  I had to bake it for 1 1/2 hours to be done.  I took it out of the oven and it smelled wonderful.  However, the entire cake sunk while cooling.  I then tried to flip it and it fell apart into a crumbled mess.  The bottom of the cake was extremely moist, almost uncooked.  Needless to say, we scooped it onto plates to eat it.

This was delicious - got rave reviews from my coworkers!  I left out the pecans, and to be honest next time I would also leave out the brown sugar swirl, as I thought this was plenty sweet and rich enough.  Used some frozen Maine wild blueberries.  Yum!

This is delicious.  I believe that the problem some are having with the batter being too stiff is because the butter and sugar have not been creamed long enough.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I will add some grated lemon peel.  Other than that, I stuck to the recipe as written.

I decreased the sugar to 1.5 cups and increased the blueberries. Made it today for the 4th of July and no one could wait until after dinner! Will make again!

People go insane when I make this. It is incredibly moist and delicious. Whenever there are breakfast potlucks, etc, I am asked to bring this. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe, it's perfect as is.

Unfortunately, this recipe is a failure. As an earlier reviewer (whose post I wish I'd read) stated, the ingredients are too heavy for their own good. Dense and unwieldy cake.

I agree with with one of the other reviews....followed the recipe as stated and the cake sank. As far as taste it really wasn't a big deal. Won't be making this again.

This came out soooooo yummy! It was gone in a flash... everyone loved it!
I think I must have a very large bundt pan (Nordic Ware Anniversary) because the batter filled less than half of the pan. It didn't matter, it was still delicious but I think I'll double the recipe next time to fill the pan more.

Followed directions, but used a 9" springform per several of the reviews. The cake didn't bake AT ALL in the middle. After 65+ minutes of cooking, there was a thin crust and a liquid filled middle.too much sugar.

This mayl be my new blueberry muffin recipe.  It is quite sweet, the next time I make this I think I will cut the sugar.  I halved the recipe and made the following adjustments: instead of butter, I used 1/4 plus 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil, 3/4 cups of blueberries, no struesal topping.  Half the recipe made 4 jumbo sized muffins.  I used the silicone muffin tin and it took 33 minutes to bake.

This was good but not great.  I read the reviews and had higher hopes.  I cooked it for 60 minutes and thought maybe it was too long as it was well browned but it was very spongy on the lower half when cut and fell significantly when cooled (Maybe too much butter?).  It was also TOO SWEET!  I love sweet but it left a sweet aftertaste-weird.  My kids liked it.  I don't think I'll make this again, sorry.

I haven't made a recipe in a long time where the MEN told their wives to be sure and get this recipe!! I took it to our Sunday School class and they RAVED over it. We all highly recommend this. I did add finely chopped pecans to the batter.

Wow, this recipe did not work for me  at all.  I was very excited after reading the wonderful reviews, not sure what I could have done wrong.  The reviews said this was sweet and many people reduced the amount of sugar, so I used 1 1/2 cups and this cake was so bland, not sweet enough.  Then it fell in the center of the bundt pan.  Then the brown sugar filling sank to the bottom so when inverted it made a wet, gooey mess on the top of the cake.  This just didn't work at all for me and I feel bad I wasted expensive blueberries in this.

Very good!! Made cake without changing anything and it was moist and dee-licious. Played around with it later and added chopped strawberries (along with the blueberries) and a tsp. of almond extract to batter and was even better! Also made a quick glaze to make it look prettier and everyone enjoyed it. A good, versatile recipe!

Our go-to coffee cake! My hubby does not like blueberries but does with this cake. I usually leave off the powdered sugar as it is sweet enough without it. Have substituted mini chocolate chips for the berries and it is delish also.

I didn't want to make a whole giant bundt cake to try out this new cake, so I decreased the recipe by a lot to make muffins instead(decreasing the baking time accordingly)that turned out great. This cake had a unique texture and taste to it that I wasn't quite expecting. A very dense cake from the sour cream--though not necessarily a bad thing. I loved how you could taste the sugariness of the cake, yet it was not overwhelmingly sweet-- good flavor.

I am making this for the third time this week. Once for my husband to take to work, one for my Mom to take to a meeting and one for my MIL this weekend. Everyone who has it just loves it. I like that it is easy and fast. I do not use the sugar/cinnamon mixture and just make a plain cake. A real winner !!!

I didn't have nuts onhand, so I left the brown sugar mixture out and it still turned out extra delicious!!  I also nearly doubled the blueberries b/c we love them so much.  This cake is super moist and was the hit of the morning!  This recipe will definitely become a standard "go to" dish in our home!!!

FANTASTIC! I have made this now too many times to even count. Every birthday, holiday, school event or teachers birthday. Everyone, I mean everyone request this cake. Little kids ask for this as their birthday cake. It's crazy! I make cakes, pies, cookies you name it and every time without fail, it's this exact recipe. I make no changes. I am not a pecan fan but everyone else was so I tried it.Wow, it's amazing. I am along with everyone, hooked. I easily make this twice a month.

I have made this multiple times and it is delicious.  Everyone loves it.  The only change that I make is double the blueberries.  You do have to make sure that the pan is greased and floured well or it will stick to the pan.

Batter was SO thick it was hard to swirl... it didn't affect the taste, however, which was DELICIOUS!  I've made it three times now, and my family can't get enough.  I sliced one and wrapped pieces individually to put in the freezer.  They didn't last long!  I would absolutely recommend this cake!

My husband and daughter really liked this.  Since I have diabetes, I didn't try it, but will absolutely make it with Splenda next time so I can indulge! I made this recipe as written with no substitutions.

Followed the recipe exactly as written. It was good but not that flavorful. UPDATE, it was much better the 2nd day. My SIL asked me to please not make it again because she would gain 5 lbs., she is not a sweet eater but really enjoyed this.

This cake was pretty decent and went over like gangbusters at my Book Club meeting.  I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and added 1 tbsp. of orange extract resulting in a lovely, nice citrusy flavor to offset the blueberries.  It was dense, moist and very sweet.  I considered it to be more cake than coffee cake but that's not a bad thing by any means.  Try it as you'll really like it!

Oh wow, I just made this today with my kids and their friends.  It's so moist!  It will become on of my regular desserts!  I didn't have pecans because my husband hates nuts. Also, it was done in 40 minutes.  I don't know if it was because of my oven or that I used a dark pan.

I made this recipe with a few changes.  As other reviewers suggested, I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, and added a dash of nutmeg.  I also made this into 8 large muffins- to make them very tender I stirred in the sour cream, and then put the flour mixture in all at once and stirred it just until moistened.  Oh, and I sprinkled the tops with coarse sugar and cinnamon.  Yummy!

Due to the mass amounts of blueberries I had, I took another stab at this, making it lower fat & sugar.  All applesauce instead of butter, 1.5 cups of sugar instead.  As always, I left out the nuts.   Changing the butter to applesauce made a big difference in the texture (I know I didn't over mix - I hand mixed it!)  Still good, but making it as written is the better way to go.

This recipe is a keeper! i've made it several times (with both frozen and fresh berries) and people always rave about it. It's like a big delicious moist blueberry muffin!

The batter is quite thick and I find it hard to 'swirl' the struessel layer in the middle, so I just sprinkle it on and add the rest of the batter.

I find it takes longer than the recipe states to cook through.

I made this recipe with blueberries the first time and it turned out great. The entire office went gaga over it. I used frozen blueberries and coated them with flour before adding them. They still bled a little bit from mixing but it it was great. 
The second time I made it with cranberries and it was EVEN BETTER. I loved it so much I've made 4 more already since I first tried it. I only use 1 cup of sugar and I've tried swirling the pecan/sugar mixture into the batter but it never quite turns out the way I want it too. The batter is very thick and my baking time varies each time I make it. The first time it was done in 30 minutes and the other times it took about 45 minutes. I think the issue is with the amount of berries you add and how much liquid they contain. This is a great recipe! I'll definitely keep making it.

Excellent! I used 1 1/2cups sugar and it was still a little sweet for my taste, so next time I might use less. I used frozen blueberries and folded them into the batter. When folding frozen blueberries, work fast so that you can mix the dough evenly and spread it in the pan more easily before the dough gets too stiff. I baked for 65 minutes in my oven and it was perfect.

I thought this cake was delicious and easy.  I cut back the butter to 1 and 1/2 sticks, and cut the sugar back to 1 and 1/2 cups.  Cooking at the temperature given, using frozen blueberries, I baked the cake for nearly 75 mins.  I was unable to get a swirl effect with the brown sugar mixture but the taste was complementary to the cake.  I topped mine with a sugar glaze using 1 cup of confectioners sugar, 1/4 cup melted butter, 3 tbsp milk and 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract, drizzle over the top and it looked lovely.  I am not a great baker, and you would've never known it judging by this cake!

Weird. I have made blueberry sour cream coffee cake many times. I did not have my normal recipe handy, and found this one. This was horrible! The consistency was spongy. It is edible, but it's not something you'd want to serve to company. I do not recommend this recipe. I did use only 1 cup like others suggested. It's not overly sweet, it's just weird looking.

This is really delicious. Since I couldn't find my Bundt pan, I baked it for an hour in a 9x13 pan (using frozen blueberries). The batter is very thick, so you have to take a little time to spread it out in the pan. I didn't really swirl the topping at the end, but just left it as it was on the top. I took it to a breakfast at my elementary school and had several requests for the recipe. I will definitely make this again! Thanks for a great recipe!!

WOW! This is absolutely delicious! We made this for the first time tonight and it will indeed be a very happy new year since we found this recipe! We omitted the nuts but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. This took 55 minutes in my 7 year old electric oven. I can't wait to have another piece in the morning with my coffee! Thank you so much for submitting!

I made this according to the recipe.  It is delicious and rich.  Nice and buttery.  It is a little on the small side though.  The batter only filled up half of my Bundt pan and makes a small cake.

Make it just as the recipe was written, and I give it 5 stars, and so did all the ladies I had for brunch!  Next time, I will try reducing sugar and butter as suggested in earlier reviews.  It was the first recipe I ever had with 1 5/8 cups of flour, which caused me to wonder if the recipe was written right.  I made it with the measurements written, and it came out fine, but I doubt an extra 1/8th cup (making it 1 2/3 cups of flour) would make a very big difference.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and the result was a perfect cake. Cool as directed and enjoy.  Take precautions to check for  doneness  at the end of cooking and dust blueberries with flour before adding to the mix. It is really good..

This is the best blueberry coffee cake recipe I have ever made. I used a little less sugar than stated in the recipe but otherwise I made it exactly as written (just didn't quite fill the 2nd cup to the top).  I didn't have fresh blueberries so I used frozen and covered them in a little flour.  The texture of this cake is moist and dense.   When I make it again I will probably cut the sugar by 1/4 cup but it is merely preference.  It is absolutely a winner!

YUM!  Made this on Easter, and it's a definite winner!
Followed some advice from previous reviewers:
Used 1 1/2 cubes butter & 1 1/2 cups sugar.  Shook both the pecans and the blueberries (separately) in flour, and it worked to keep them from sinking.  I put the blueberries on top of the middle pecan layer and it made a pretty and distinct band of blue, which looked nice.  Oh, one thing... it was VERY thick, almost like dough, so I added a bit of cream (approx 1/8 cup) cream, & then a tablespoon of water.  It was still thick, but at least closer to batter.  "Poured" with some help and then smoothed it out in the pan so that the batter was even throughout.  And I put a little brown sugar in the bottom of the pan to give it a little sheen once it was turned out.  Looked & tasted nice!  - Baked exactly 55 min.  So good!  Both the hubbs & I loved it!  :)

I definitely doctored mine up big time, but this recipe is still so good. I used yogurt instead of SC. I used vanilla and lemon extract, and I used half white sugar and half coconut sugar. I also did a sugary pecan top on the cake. So so yummy!!!

This was a delicious, moist cake.  I followed the lead of a few reviewers and made the following changes.  I added 1-1/2 cups of blueberries, dusted with flour before combining, cut sugar to 1-1/2 cups (1 cup white, 1/2 brown,) and used 3/4 cups butter.  I thoroughly beat wet ingredients, except sour cream, than stirred in flour and sour cream alternately, beginning and ending with flour.  I added 1 cup toasted pecans and baked in Bundt pan for 57 minutes.  I have made it twice and both times it turned out perfectly!

This is literally the best thing I have ever baked! Thank you so much for the recipe.  I made it with the adjustments recommended, 1 1/2 sticks butter and 1 1/2 cups sugar.  I added about 1T butter to the streusel for the top of the cake.  I used a coffee cake pan so the top of the cake was Actually the top of the cake, and this helped the streusel to stick better.  I keep getting requests to make it again and again.

I have not made this, although it sounds very good. That being said, I have never heard of 5/8 of a cup. I have been baking for some time, but I have never seen this amount in any recipe I've made. Can someone please explain.

Very good and fast. I did not make the topping and used plain Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream. Tasty indeed.

I used a bit less sugar.  It is quite good.  Very moist, doesn't rise a lot.  Other people have said it is delicious.  I put a bit of flour on the blueberry's so they don't sink to the bottom.

I make my own oat flour in my Vitamix out of oatmeal. Makes for a healthier cake,  &  don't use any white sugar,  just 1 cup of brown,  and half the amount of brown for the pecan mixture.  Buttermilk works great instead of heavy sour cream,  and I separate the eggs,  whip the egg whites stiff,  then fold them in to make a lighter cake.  I mix all ingredients very little and just until moist,  prior to the egg whites.

The middle was a gooey, undercooked mess and I cooked it 1 hour and 16  minutes.  As it cooled it deflated and  my baking powder was brand new.  The crust was good.  Don't waste your blueberries.

This is a wonderful recipe. My family loves it! The directions were easy to follow. I didn't make any substitutions with the ingredients and it turned out perfect. I always get nervous baking in a bundt pan (because of previous cakes sticking), but this one did great!

I just made this and I'm in love. I used Lemon Virgin Olive Oil and Wild Rosemary Olive Oil 3/4 of a cup total in place of the butter. I also substituted plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream. - This will be a go to brunch item from now on.

Update: - made it again with just Lemon Virgin Olive Oil - this is such a treat to eat.

just bought some fresh blueberries at the market, so i made it today. yes it was a disaster and i am a pretty darn good baker. followed the recipe exactly but had to bake nearly 90 minutes. when i turned it out of the pan, all the blueberries were stuck  to the bottom of the pan. yes i did grease and flour it and waited for it to cool. what a waste of time and money! now i have nothing to take to the party tonight. thanks for nothing! i would love to know where the lovely picture came from! - cause it sure as heck didnt come from this recipe!

I did not have frozen or fresh blueberries like the recipe calls for so I used 1/2 cup dried blueberries instead and it still came out really moist and delicious. Beware of the cooking time though. In the all recipes magazine the cooking time says 1 1/4 hr to 1 1/2 hours. I set my oven timer for 1 hr and it really could of came out a little earlier because the outside was a little too brown for my taste. Overall this coffee cake is truly a keeper. I am going to make this again in a few days for a Memorial Day BBQ and will put blueberries and strawberries on the platter in the middle of the cake, then it will have the red,white and blue colors!

Excellent. My family loves this and so do my co-workers. I've made it several times. I add a teaspoon of lemon extract to enhance the blueberry flavor. It's always a winner and if you slightly under cook it, then it freezes quite well.

Love love love this recipe!  I've made it a number of times for overnight guests and it's a hit every time. I will very often substitute plain fat free Greek yogurt for the sour cream which works fine.

There is nothing spectacular about the cake. Had to leave it in the oven for an additional 20 minutes due to being undercooked at 60 min. The flavor was blah. The insides were still gooey and the topping on the top which ends up on the bottom when inverted, seems out of place in texture - not to mention forms hard crust that breaks cut pieces apart when trying to slice.  Won't make again.

If you enjoy cloyingly sweet grocery store bakery items, then this is the recipe for you. I followed the recipe exactly as posted. I'm an experienced baker, with plenty of Bundt cakes under my belt. I planned to make it to use up left-over sour cream and take it to work. It came out of the oven pretty, but it was impossible to get out of the pan. The streusel caramelized and bonded it to the pan. It finally came out, in chunks. I contemplated compromising my baking cred by taking it to work anyway - until I tasted it. Too sweet and unappealingly damp and dense. I'm giving it 2 stars. I appreciate I don't share everyone's taste for extremely sweet cakes, so if this recipe appeals to you I'd recommend keeping the streusel away form the sides of the pan.

Made this for a dinner party last night - everyone loved it! Almost all had seconds (or thirds!) and asked for the recipe. Reduced white sugar to 1.5c as recommended, increased berries to 1.5c. Could cut down on brown sugar as well.

This is the second time I have made this recipe. The first time I used the mixer to mix all ingredients, folded in the blueberries, and as a number of others have stated, the center sank some. This time, I used the beater for the sugar / butter and egg mixture, then folded in the sour cream and then  the dry, sifted ingredients as others have suggested. The 9 x13 pan is still cooling, an hour + , and nothing is sunken! Rich, sweet and delicious!

Perfect. Moist and simple to make. You can reduce the amount of white sugar and it is still sweet due to the brown sugar. This way you get more flavor of the batter. Cake was devoured as soon as it was put on the table. Great for when company is coming.

Very easy to make. This is one I can change to be what I want. I left out the brown Suger mix that is to go between. I also use dry blueberries.  Mixed it all together when I did that.  Sprinkled with just power Suger on top when it cool off. Also coated pan with spray cooking  oil and the roll regular Suger round the pan before putting in batter.

This cake is so yummy that it was gone before you could say YUMMY! I put the blueberries in the middle along with half of the topping. I liked having the top cake portion just the cake. My husband doesn't like blueberries so I wanted him to enjoy the cake as well. He devoured the cake, blueberries & all. Thanks for a superb recipe.

Great recipe!  I also tried it with apples and used some homemade caramel sauce to coat the pecans and instead of powdered sugar drizzled the finished cake with caramel sauce. Wonderful breakfast for a cold fall morning.

I've made this recipe about 20 times for my husband and my brother and they LOVE it.  Just be prepared though that it is a VERY moist coffee cake and you might have to cook it slightly longer than the 55 minutes suggested.  I also cut back slightly on the blueberries because if you add the full cup it can come out too moist.

This is really yummy and easy to  make. The batter is very thick but it comes out great. I tried putting some of the cinnamon pecan topping on the bottom of the bundt pan once (so that it would be on top when I flipped it over), and it just burnt a little and wasn't as good.

Everyone loves this cake. It is a tad too sweet for me so the second time I made it I reduced sugar to 1 1/2 C, could even reduce to 1 C. I also added Chinese 5 spuce

This was FANTASTIC!!!!  I followed other reviewers advice and cut the white sugar to 1 cup and the butter to 3/4 cup.  I didn't use pecans or powdered sugar (because we don't like nuts and I didn't feel it needed the extra sweetness).  It probably only took about 48 minutes to cook but my oven could run a littler hotter too.  This will be something I will make over and over again!!!!

Excellent:-)   I have made this cake twice , the first time the cake fell apart trying to remove from bundt pan ( cake was a little to hot still).  The second time I let the cake cool longer and it came out perfect.  The cake was very tasty both times.  The first time I made the cake I used 100 ml greek blueberry yogurt and  then used sour cream to get the 1 cup needed.  Will definitely made again.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it is too sweet (and I love sweets).  I should have read reviews to reduce the sugar. It is also didn't quite cook all the way even after 60 mins, so while it is very moist, it is also very dense and gooey - not really like a coffee cake to me.  Maybe it was something with my oven.  I probably won't use this recipe again, but if I did I would reduce the sugar and bake longer.

Made no changes to the recipe. Very moist and delicious.  Had no problem with the cake falling.  The topping/filling does take away from the taste of the blueberries.

This is the most delicious cake I ever tasted. My husband took it to work, and everyone loved it. I made it 2 times now, next time I try to make it with less sugar and other berries, I think raspberries will taste very well in this cake.

this recipe is scrumptious, however, I have one that is fully as good with less butter and less sugar.  Mine calls for l/2 cup butter, l cup of sugar, 2 cups flour, 1 tsp. baking soda, everything else is the same.  Try it, you might like it.

It was a nice, easy to prepare cake that my family liked. The only things I changed were using 1 1/2 cups Splenda instead of the white sugar,  2 cups of fresh blueberries, and no pecans (I didn't have any). It makes a small, dense cake, but nice and moist.

Followed recipe to the letter - great cake! (I always laugh when someone makes substitutions to the specified ingredients, and then gives a negative review of the original- which they didn't really make!). I will try to make this more friendly to my diabetic mother  next time, but first attempts for me with baked goods means no deviation from the instructions.

I made this cake twice over this past weekend.  The first time, my husband tried it and thought it was under-baked and I looked at it and decided to try to make it again, as I had so many blueberries on hand.  I made it again, baking it for an extra 8 minutes.  The cake is so heavy and moist, it appears under-baked.  Too heavy for my liking, will not be making this again!  Oh, and I made it exactly as stated in the recipe, didn't change a thing...yuck...

My teenagers and hubby loved it!  I had to make changes because I didn't have everything on hand.  Here's what I changed:  used half butter and half applesauce,  a combo of sour cream and cottage cheese, brown sugar instead of white (used less),  hazelnuts instead of pecans, and added a cup of frozen peaches with the blueberries.  Very yummy!

I measured everything exactly as the recipe called for.  The cake was much, much, much too sweet and the blueberries made the surrounding cake wet and mushy.  We ended up serving icecream with a fancy cookie for dessert.

I rarely review but I must say that this is one of the best coffee cakes I've ever made.   I took the suggestion of other reviews and reduced the butter and sugar to 1 1/2 cups,  and also increased the blueberries.    I made a huge mistake and did not let the cake cool enough before trying to take it out of the bundt pan.   I ended up with a heap of cake.   The next time,   I used a tube pan,  and let it cool completely,  and this worked out great.  Using the tube pan I was able to place  half of the streusel was in the cake and the other half was on top.    It was perfection- pretty and delicious,  and plenty sweet with the reduced sugar and butter.   This is my new favorite coffee cake recipe.

Very nice recipe.  I originally just wanted a sour cream coffee cake but when I found this recipe I decided to try the blueberry addition.  This recipe made a moist, dense coffee cake just like I wanted it with the brown sugar filling and topping.  Instead of the full bundt pan, I made small bundt and tube pan cakes out of the which easily filled 8 of my small pans so that I could freeze some of the cakes for later.  The cake refrigerates well and tastes good right out of the fridge.

moist, delicious, and terrific!  needed an extra 5 minutes of baking time - perhaps because the fresh blueberries were so juicy?  what-ever the reason, a delicious coffee cake!

My sister and I both made this cake in our respective homes and we both had failures.  After 60 min. in the oven, cake looked lovely coming out and while sitting on the wire rack, I was watching it shrink!  After cooling, tried turning it onto a plate and it fell apart a like cobber or apple crisp.  Not editable and a very expense mess.  Will NOT make again!

I made one change to the recipe and it was a bad idea. I used cooking spray instead of butter and flour and the bottom stuck to the pan! I tried the top, though, and it was very tasty. I will make it again but stick to butter and flour for the pan. 

I think this is a Sunday morning treat recipe as it is very sweet and full of fattening ingredients.

i made the cake per the directions except i left out the nuts and added more blueberries.  i greased the cake pan and then dusted it with cinnamon and white sugar to help keep it from sticking. 

the cake was very good; it was rich and moist.  my husband really liked it.  i think the next time i will add some lemon zest and leave out the cinnamon and brown sugar in the middle, it was a nice addition but didn't seem like the cake really needed it.

Exactly as described! Very very yummy and a bit on the unhealthy side. Tried our first one on the family, they wondered what we were celebrating. Bought a second one to a new Mom who needed a meal... She said she loved serving to visitors.  Will use again and again.

I take this to work a lot and my coworkers love it!  The only changes I make are to double the blueberries, and to substitute almonds or walnuts for pecans, depending on what I have. Then I make a glaze with powdered sugar and milk and pour it over the cake when it is done.

1 - I hate using a Bundt pan. Use plenty of flour and not too much spray. 
2 - This recipe is amazing. I made it as described the first time, but used a little less white sugar the second time through. I also did three layers of filling because my top layer burned too much the first time. Next time I make it for me, I'm going to try greek yogurt & sub out more sugar. I can't keep away from it! A little less delicious might be okay.

deslish! I slightly overcooked it, but that just means I'll make another one really soon....I used plain greek yogurt in place of the sour cream and I also used white whole wheat flour and 1.5 cups of blueberries (and actually I might use more the next time)

Pure goodness! I followed the recipe exactly, it came out just perfect.  I was concerned at first because the cake mixture came out a bit thick, but after I popped it into the oven, it came out just right. Thank you for this great recipe!

I have been baking homemade cakes and selling them for years. I am now selling cakes in a few restaurants and for catering. I decided to try a few new cakes to add to my list of self created cakes. This one looked sooooooo yummy. I made it and was a lil nervous because I couldn't taste it before I brought it to the restaurant. They paid me and cut a piece and gave me a lil tiny piece OMG it was amazing. I never do this because I don't want to get chubby but I just cut the recipe in half and I am baking half a cake for myself right NOW lol......I had everything in the house but the pecans. I crushed up like 10 pistachios and threw that in with the brown sugar and cin. I figured it couldn't throw it off too much even tho pecans would def be better it's 1030pm and I didn't feel like going to the store. anyways long story I LOVE THIS CAKE and so did all of the customers THank you!!1

So delicious!!! I think it would have been fine with less sugar as others suggested, but it was still awesome! Everyone went nuts over it! I left out the nuts so the kids would try it and they loved it too. It may not be healthy, but at least it had some good fruit in it :)

I made this cake for my young wives group and they DEVOURED it.  I'm talking almost-licked-the-plate good!  I have requests to make this again.  I did take the advice of other reviewers.  Using fresh blueberries, I coated and marinated them in sugar for 30 min.  I, also, hand mixed the batter after adding in the sour cream to avoid over beating, and I added a 1/2t of lemon extract-- giving it an additional kick.  Great recipe and great advice.  Definitely a keeper!

Made the original recipe but with less sugar. Most older recipes call for more sugar than is really needed or wanted by todays bakers.  Used lite sour cream, but still not a healthy cake. I absolutely loved it!  Will probably add a few more blueberries next time, just because I love them......

It had a nice flavor and presents well.  It was definitely on the denser side.  Next time I will make extra topping (brown sugar/nuts) and add some to the bottom of the pan and more in the middle.

IT WAS A HIT!!  I received many "mmms" and "ohhs" from the attendees of a breakfast I "catered".  It was one of the first items to go...I heard one man say "these are real blueberries!" (I used fresh).  I must admit - something happened and we couldn't get the cake to come out...it was stuck on the bottom of the pan (top of the cake) - but loose on the sides and middle (bundt pan).  After much "working" of the cake and pounding on the bottom of the pan, it finally came out - missing the top "edging" portion of the cake.  I was super bummed - because it looked so good, just missing the rounded top.  I wasn't going to serve it - but I didn't want it to go to waste - so I decided I'd dust it (mid-heavy) with powered sugar. It looked much better - and from there it was rave after rave...from the time it was placed on the buffet line to when the last person left.  Not sure what went wrong - or if I'll be able to make it "happen" again...but I will definitely be making this cake again.  Lesson learned - a little powdered sugar can go a long way...especially since presentation is everything!

Wow. I made this exactly as written.  I have never in my life gotten such a positive reaction to a cake I made.  I made it for a family get together. It was kind of ridiculous everyone oohing an ahhing over this.  Lots of people went back for a second piece and they finished off the cake.  I had a small sliver and it really is delicious and very very moist.

I JUST MADE THIS TONIGHT AND, HOLY COW IT WAS GOOD. A WHOLE BUNDT CAKE WAS TOO MUCH FOR JUST ME AND HUBBY, SO I CUT THE RECIPE IN HALF AND USED A BREAD PAN INSTEAD. DIDN'T BOTHER TO FLIP IT UPSIDE DOWN AFTER COOKING. TOOK ABOUT 60 MIN TO COOK. CHECKED TO SEE IF IT WAS DONE WITH A KNIFE COMING OUT CLEAN. I USED FRESH BLUEBERRIES AND WALNUTS INSTEAD OF PECANS CUZ THAT'S WHAT I HAD ON HAND. IT IS REALLY, REALLY GOOD!! NOT EVEN HARD TO MAKE. I WILL DEFINENTLY MAKE THIS ONE AGAIN.

Although delicious I couldn't quite enjoy it because I kept thinking about how BAD it was for me.  I felt better when I gave 1/4 of it to my super skinny friends.  I will definitely make again though and try with less sugar / butter.

I have no idea what happened to my cake. I followed the recipe exactly & my cake burnt all around the edges, the blueberries stuck & burnt but the middle was raw it it fell apart. I greased the pan & cooked it for 60 minutes. I'm so upset :(

Oh my! Thank you so much for this recipe! I followed the instructions exactly EXCEPT I used sliced almond pieces instead of pecans and increased the amount of blueberries to two cups. SOOOOyummy! The end result is a moist, sweet and tart coffee cake. I will definitely be saving this in my recipe book

If I could give this more stars I would, it's really that good. At first, I thought maybe 1C of sour cream would be too much (because I had my first piece while still warm so it seemed almost way too moist) but when I had another piece hours later, completely cooled, it was even better than the first amazing slice. Very impressive looking too. I did however have to use a different crumb topping be-c my brown sugar would have broken my guests teeth, nonetheless, it was still SCRUMDELIUMCIOUS!!! Thank U 4 sharing this gr8 recipe.

I just made this cake and it is lovely. I like walnuts so I used them instead of pecans. I also used 1 1/2 cups of sugar as per other reviewers suggestions and a few more blueberries. I was having a bit of a problem getting the cake out of the pan but I used a wooden skewer and loosened it around the edges and middle. I think I'll cut down on the brown sugar next time as this cake is very sweet.  I mixed some blueberries with some vanilla yogurt and spooned a little on top when I served it. MMMMM So Good.

This recipe is by far the best coffee cake recipe.  I did not make any changes and it came out very moist and tasty.  I also tried it without the blueberries and it is just as delicious.  I will be using this recipe over and over, thanks!

Made this exactly like the recipe.  Was not real sure about the amount of flour I think I used about 1 3/4 cup.  My husband loved it like eating blueberry muffins.

Excellent!  I took this to my mom's and she loved it!  I did take the suggestions to reduce the sugar to 1 and 1/2 cups and increase the blueberries.  I also think next time I will decrease the amount of brown sugar. I also used light sour cream and didn't notice it.  I will definitely make it again!

Perfect! I don't know how it would be possible to make this cake any better. It's sweet and moist and has a delicious creamy flavor. This will be "the" coffee cake in my house.

This cake was a huge hit with my Husband. I did read someof the other reviews and cut back on the sugar and flour as suggested. My husband does not like too too sweet. It was just perfect after putting in the fridge.....Yummy

This is one of the most amazing cakes I've ever made.  The actual cake itself was like nothing else! It bakes up beautifully and is a show-stopper.  My fiancee brought one to work and it was gone in minutes.  The only change I may make in the future is to leave out the cinnamon-pecan mixture and maybe add a glaze on top instead.  This cake won't disappoint!

I feel like I have made this 800 times and I never get tired of it! A good desert to take to parties and a good cake to make when you have company over. I have never had anyone say that they didn't like it and I always get rave reviews on it. This has become a staple for me!

very flavorful cake... as recommended by others, i only used 1.5 cups sugar. turned half the batter into muffins and used the rest in an 8x8 pan. for the muffins i filled them half way with batter, then put in the nut mixture and filled rest of way with batter.  thanks for a great recipe!  i'll be keeping this one  :)

This cake lasted less than 24 hours in our house!! Very moist! My husband loved it, and he usually doesn't like coffee cakes because they're too dry.  Great Recipe!  I might try it with raspberries next time just to see how that turns out.

Great recipe, very moist with good texture--but SO sweet!  Between the two cups of white sugar in the batter and the brown sugar topping, the yummy blueberry taste gets overwhelmed. I'll try this again with 1.5 c sugar instead.

Very easy to make and delicious :) I used a glass rectangle pan rather than the bundt, and though it still turned out well, I'd recommend using the bundt pan.  It is very sweet, so I might cut back slightly on the sugar next time, but overall, very, very yummy. :)  Thanks for sharing this!!

I didn't try this one; I made it as a gift for my boyfriend's parents.  They both raved!  The only thing I did different from the recipe was not to include pecans - didn't have any, and his mom doesn't like them.  I will make this for US next time, and will add lemon, use fat free sour cream, reduce the sugar & use 1/2 splenda per another suggestion (bf's diabetic).  My plan is to make a glaze for drizzling (confectioners & lemon juice), rather than just the sprinkle of confectioners I used this time.  YUM - can't wait to try it again!!

Definitely good.  I didn't have a bundt pan, so I used a 13x9 and increased the topping to 3/4 c. brown sugar and 2 t cinnamon (nut allergy - I left them out altogether).  Ended up baking it, with frozen berries, for 55 minutes and it was perfect.

I just bought some frozen blueberries on sale when I came across this recipe on the AR homepage.  I gave it a try and messed up a couple of times.  I sprayed my pan with pam instead of flouring and then I accidentally added all of the cinnamon/brown sugar mixture to the middle instead of half.  So, I guess with these mistakes it caused my cake to be gooey on top.  I wasn't to happy w/myself when I saw the finished product but, after it cooled a little, we had a piece and it tasted wonderful to me.  I definitely want to make again but I'll do it the right way next time. Hopefully w/the corrections it will be presentation perfect as it would make a great gift or great for entertaining.  The taste can't be beat!

YES! This is fantastic! I just pulled it out of the oven 15 minutes ago, had a couple bites and ran to the computer. I made some changes out of neccessity, since running to the store with a 7 and 8 year old and a 3 month old wasn't on my priority list. That being said, I won't hesitate making this as written next time when I have all supplies on hand. I had to use 1 cup white sugar with 1 cup brown. I used frozen mixed berries. And 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup plain yogurt. Delicious! This won't last long in our house :)

Sinfully delicious! Melts in your mouth and keeps you going back for more! My younger children didn't like it but my husband and older children LOVED it. I'll be making this for holiday breakfasts for sure!

OMG! This was amazing...I have never baked a dessert and had it disappear so quickly.  My husband isn't even a blueberry fan and every time I looked up, he was heating some up in the microwave! I kept everything in the recipe as is...definitely a keeper :-).

OMG!  This was heavenly!  I only made a few teeny changes; I only used 1 2/3 c white sugar and added another cup of blueberries since I used the large ones. I didn't have a bundt pan, so I followed another reviewers method and used a 9 x 13 pan, didn't layer, and just sprinkled the brown sugar on top just before baking.  It was wonderful!  Thanks so much for a fantastic recipe!

A wonderful cake, and so easy to make. I agree, it needs less sugar - definitely doesn't need the powedered sugar on top. A great way to use fresh blueberries. I am already sharing this recipe....

Whew,  definitely needs less sugar (as many had suggested, but I did not take heed), but is an amazingly moist cake.    I had to cook it about 1 hr 10 min because of frozen blueberries, but it was worth the wait!

Very good! Sweet, but still delicous! I didn't make the strudel mix and just drizzled some lemon frosting (lemon juice and confectioners sugar) over the top- that helped cut the sweetness and enhanced the taste of the blueberries! Yum!

WOW! This is incredible...Just had my first 2 bites (warm) and had to come and review immediately! All I added was an extra half cup of fresh blueberries, to finish out the container. I will definitely be making this everytime I get some fresh blueberries! I need to find a way to convert this to muffins as well. I don't even care that it isn't healthy....it is so good...everyone deserves something this good once in a while! WOW and WOW

I rate it at 4.5 stars. It was still very good after I customized the recipe to suit my personal calorie and diet preference. I omitted center-fillings of brown sugar portion. I also added 1/2 tsp of almond essence and 1/4 C of flax seed, oat bran and wheat germ. I used 1C of whole wheat flour and the rest regular. I also used only 1C of sugar, brown instead of white. I added 1/4 C of honey and doubled the blueberries.

Used one cup white sugar and half cup brown sugar.  Reconstituted dried cranberries with orange juice (covered dried berries with oj and wrapped plastic wrap over it; microwaved one minute and let rest five minutes) to replace fresh blueberries.  Very yummy.

Oh Boy, this Blueberry Sour Cream Coffee Cake was MOIST, MOIST, MOIST! We had a competition with this recipe and the Blueberry Buckle. I LOVE the Buckle but this WON for a couple of reasons. Being able to make this in the Bunt pan added to the visual appeal, the larger size is better suited to serve at a gathering. We liked the cake consistency a tiny bit more than the buckle. I have to say it was a tough one as the Blueberry Buckle was also awesome. My husband and I liked the Blueberry Sour Cream Coffee Cake "slightly better" but Chef Junior my teenage son swears by the Blueberry Buckle. They are both winning recipes that your family will enjoy for years to come. These are both classics to be passed down!

This was good, but kind of wet. I think that if I make it again I will cut down on the brown sugar. The flavor was really good and very sweet. I added extra blueberries as some of the other reviewers suggested.

Excellent.  I used fresh cranberries instead of blueberries and baked it in a 9 x 13 pan for 50 minutes.  I also cut butter to 1 1/2 cups, and increased the berries to 1 1/2 cups.  I made the changes to work with what I had on hand.  This recipe leaves a lot of room for interpretation, and I will make it again.

Absolutely Delish!  Very sweet, tasty and moist!  I did add more blueberries than recommended and had to cook it probably about 75 minutes as opposed to an hour!  Super and Easy, great!

It tasted SO good you would never know it was so easy! I put this together in about 10 minutes. I highly recommend this recipe.  You could easily change the blueberries for other berries and it would be equally great!

This is sooooo delicious. I made it exactly by the recipe except for a few extra berries and I think that was a mistake because of the extra moisture they put in the cake batter. I also had to cook extra time. I think that is caused by the difference in the size and kind of pan. Looking back, this recipe doesn't need any changes, it is absolutely wonderful.Thanks for sharing

I had a little trouble with this recipe. A website told me that 5/8 of a cup is 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons. So I used that and the cake took FOREVER to bake. It took 1 1/2 hours. Was VERY moist  so I think the above 5/8 measurement was wrong I went on another website and was informed that 5/8 of a cup is 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons. The cake is good, though but very heavy and sticky.

I had made this this past Sunday for dinner with the in laws, and it was awesome!!  Oh so moist and delicious.  I used fresh blueberries and before adding them to the batter, I dusted them with flour, as not to sink in the cake.  And I used a 9x13 pan.  Great recipe for the 
summer or any time!!  It got rave reviews! Thanks!

I have made this recipe twice.  Both times it turned out fantastic.  I did reduce sugar as others suggested and used 2 cups of frozen blueberries and i also used walnuts. The batter is very thick going into the pan but i used lots of cooking spray.  This is the ultimate blueberry coffee cake and super easy.

Delicious, moist, and tasty cake! The slight changes I made were margarine instead of butter, light sour cream instead of regular and 1 cup of sweetener + 1 cup of sugar rather than two cups of sugar. This is great with coffee or tea.

This was a really good cake and I luckily had no problems getting it out of the bundt pan (I used several coats of cooking spray). I got several compliments on it.

Yum! Yum! Yum!  This made the perfect special Sunday morning breakfast.  Baked it the night before and it was just as good the next morning!  The only change I made was using a 9x13 pan instead of a bundt pan (I know my reputation for bundt pans!).  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

This was a huge hit.  I had only 1/2 cup sour cream so I filled up the cup with whipping cream and baked it in a 9x13.  Turned out wonderfully after 45 minutes.  One little girl had 7 pieces!

I ended up having to make these into muffins instead, the jumbo ones because I left my bundt pan at my mom's.  They came out very good.  Next time if I made them into muffins again I would out some of the brown sugar mixture one the bottom of the pan as well as on the top and in the middle.  I also only used 1 1/2 c. of sugar because that's all I had.  I will definitely be making these again.

Oh, yum!  This is by far the best coffee cake I've ever made OR had the pleasure of eating.  Very easy to make.  We're packing up for a move so the bundt pan was already packed.  Made it in a 9x13" glass pan and baked it for about 45 minutes.  It was perfect!  After reading some reviews about the length of time required in a bundt pan, I think I'll stick with my casserole pan next time I make it.  My son (age 6) at 3 servings for breakfast!

This is fantastic! I made it just like the recipe called. I made it for Christmas breakfast and my family went nuts for it. I took the extra with me to my parent's house and they went crazy over it as well. Thanks for a great breakfast recipe!

A huge hit at my house.  I used frozen blueberries, probably about 1 1/2 cups.  The blueberries were extra large, so I used a few more to make sure they were well distributed throughout.  I did not add much to the cook time, though, and it still turned out perfect - fully cooked, but very moist.  I had a little trouble getting the cake out of the pan, so grease and flour very well.  Great cake, like a giant, soft, blueberry streusel muffin!

I made this the night before serving and it was wonderful the next day!  It was a very moist and dense coffee cake, which my husband loved!  He's not a fan of nuts, so I will make it again without the nuts --- it will be just as delicious!  Great recipe!

I don't know what happened to mine, but it fell after it cooled.  The taste was good when I tested it out of the oven.  I'll probably try again.

Very good. It was a bit too sweet, so next time I'll use less white sugar. I also doubled the blueberries.

I followed the recipe exactly with the only exception of adding in about 1/2 cup of extra berries.  Very creamy tasting and rich.  My only mistake was the pan I baked it in--the outside started to burn and the middle was still quite raw.  I decided to pull it out at that point and it was still amazing---melt-in-your-mouth in the middle.

Heavenly!  I added extra blueberries and doubled the pecan mixture.  I found that it took considerably longer than 55-60 minutes to bake, more like 90 minutes almost. I will be making this recipe often!

Perfect the way it was it was wonderful, thank you so much........For those who have a sweeter tooth, it also worked for me when I increased to 3/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup pecans for the filling but it took 1 hour 8 minutes to cook through.

What a wonderful and moist coffee cake!  Although it was pretty close to perfect, I will definitely add more blueberries next time--that's just my preference.  I can tell that this will quickly become a favorite among my friends and family--thank you for the wonderful recipe!

Substituted cranberries for blueberries. Came out very butter-flavored, that's what i didn't like about it. The cake itself is fine, moist and nice. Apart from the cranberries, it has a very plain, almost childish flavor (of butter!). The pecan and cinnamon mixture blended too much with the cake batter, so it didn't stand out and give a "kick" to the cake. All in all, nothing to write home about.

Very tasty (and rich).  I used a deep bundt pan and it took 70 minutes to bake.  It was worth the wait.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I didn't particularly like this recipe. I was really really sweet, and I had reduced my sugar to 1 1/2 cups as suggested. Like others have mentioned, the texture was way too moist, like to the point it seemed like it was a little under cooked. I gave it 4 stars, because my boyfriend really loved it...

This was wonderful!  My neighbor gave me some fresh blueberries picked from her yard.  I baked it on a Friday night and by Sunday there was only one piece left.  I did have to bake it longer than suggested.  I used by convection oven and it seems to take longer than my old stove.  I will make this again.

I have made this recipes several times and my husband loves it.  He continually asks for me to make it.  It most always turns out very moist on the inside.  It did take a litte longer to cook as I was using frozen berries, but other than that, I didn't change anything.

This was very tasty.  It's a keeper.  I might try to cut down on the amount of butter next time, as it was almost too moist.  I must admit that I did add about 1-3/4 cups of blueberries instead of just one cup, so that might have contributed to the extra moistness.  But I love blueberries -- especially Maine Wild Blueberries!

Soooo good! Whipped the butter and sugar for a long time until light and fluffy. Then eggs one at a time. Sour cream and vanilla last ...plus almond flavoring. Then folded in the mixed dry ingredients. Turned out perfect! Delicious.

What a waste of great ingredients! I seldom give bad reviews, but this one is a stinker! After 75 minutes in the oven, the cake tested as done,  but there were big areas where it was just doughy. Maybe too many blueberries? Not enough flour? After over sixty years of baking, I am not sure, but know I would never waste my ingredients or time on this coffee “cake”again

Big hit with the discriminating coworkers. I added 1/2 more of blueberries. Very moist. The pecan, brown sugar cinnamon layer and slightly crunch outside with moist tender inside makes this standout from other blueberry coffee cake recipes.

I cut the recipe in half, and baked in a round cake pan.  I used fresh blueberries.  It turned out great, and I would make it again.

As written. Everything. Perfect. Collapsing? Um, no... what pan did you use? Also, I’ve seen at least one review where the writer “cuts back” the butter to “3/4 cup (3 sticks)” and can’t figure out why the cake is greasy. That’s 3/4 lb, yo, not three quarters of a cup. All the reviews with the subs, wrong pans, and “it didn’t turn out”... SURPRISE.

Delicious. I omitted the walnuts (I just don't like nuts in my baked goods), so I just used the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture on two layers. I used frozen organic blueberries, as that's all I had on hand. I coated them in flour before mixing them gently into the batter. I don't know if this made the difference for me or what, but I had no problems with the cake caving in on itself like some reviewers have mentioned. It turned out beautifully and is the best-tasting blueberry coffee cake I've ever made. Great recipe!

This was SO SWEET!  Way way way too much sugar in this recipe.  I'm not sure what impact cutting the sugar back to 1 cup would have, but this is so overwhelmingly sweet I'll never make it again.

This cake is delicious! Moist and flavorful. I made no changes other than using walnuts instead of pecans because I didn’t have any. I didn’t even use a glaze. Didn’t need it. This is a keeper!

I substituted raspberries for blueberries and made them into muffins. I think it would have tasted better as cake, but the raspberries were good.

I’ve doubled the pecans and brown sugar so I can have a crunchy bottom and more on the inside. And I add extra blueberries of course! Everyone I’ve made this for have loved it!

I loved this recipe. It was delicious . I used Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream and I got the right amount of tanginess that I was looking for. I also used twice the amount of fresh blueberries that were called for in this morning recipe. WELL DONE!

A really good coffee cake that's light and airy... but a little too sweet for our tastes (and I do like sweet).  Next time I will use a little less sugar.  And, yes, I will definitely make this again.  
The only change that I made was coconut flakes instead of powered sugar on top as a last minute substitute.

There was not a single crumb left, and THAT speaks volumes. Around this house we usually cannot finish a cake before it becomes stale. This cake was fought over to the last morsel!

OMG this is so so good !   Perfect!  My whole family loved it. We call it crack cake as it is truly addictive ! 
Yes it has butter and sugar yada yada. It's a splurge and not an every day cake- enjoy!!!! Well worth the calories. I use all organic ingredients and so I have no qualms about serving this cake to friends and family as a special treat.

I reduced the sugar by about 1/3 cup ( half of the sugar was stevia), and the baking time was an additional 12 minutes.

Everyone loves this cake.  I put more blueberries (another 1/2 cup) in it because everyone loves the blueberries. I use margarine and tofutti sour cream because of some non-dairy eaters and I don't sprinkle the confectioners sugar but there is never any cake left if we have a full table! Highly recommend.

I added 2 cups of blueberries like they said they had done and it caused the cake to have way too much liquid! It didnt rise and all of the blueberries were at the bottom even though I coated them with flour. When I make it again, I will go by the recipe as it says.....very disappointing but wonderful flavor....

I made this cake as printed with one exception. I did not mix the berries in the batter. I put them as a layer with the cinnamon sugar. I did not alter quantities with possibly the amount of berries. I had some left from some muffins I made. I just used what I had, I am guessing 1 1/4 cup.
Every one has been eating this like mad!
Great recipe

My first Bundt and it was a huge hit. My brothers, all from different states,  came home for a visit on the same weekend. I made this and dropped it off Saturday night promising to be back in the morning for coffee. I was and there was coffee but no cake! They "sampled" it Saturday night and finished it off. So I personally can't tell you how delicious it was, but they loved it! I'm making another one for my family tomorrow.

Amazing!! I've been looking for the perfect blueberry coffee cake recipe for years and this is it! Only small modifications I made were as follows: omitted pecans as I didn't have any on hand and reduced white sugar to 1 3/4 cups based on other reviews of it being a bit too sweet.  I made this for company as part of our brunch and received many compliments.

I made this exactly as the recipe said and it turned out delicious without any of the issues others described.  I added a lemon powdered sugar glaze before serving.  Lemons and blueberries are a lovely couple.

I did have some problems with this recipe.  First, I couldn't find the muffin cups, so I used two round cake pans.  I figured I would make it into a coffee cake.  Then I used the last of the cinnamon on the topping, I was sure the last time I used cinnamon the container was half full.   I didn't have a teaspoon of cinnamon left for the muffins batter.  To overcome this obstacle, I substituted:  quarter teaspoon each of cloves and nutmeg, plus a half teaspoon of allspice.  I hoped for the best.  Because of the cake pans, I had to increase the cook time to forty-five minutes.  The resulting coffee cake didn't make to breakfast the next morning.  We couldn't stop sneaking a piece all night.

Since I made changes, I can't give this five stars.  After reading other reviews, I made the following changes:  used about 2 cups frozen blueberries and tossed with flour; decreased the sugar and butter by 1/2 cup each; used almond extract instead of vanilla (personal preference); used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup plain yogurt; used walnuts  (didn't have peacans).  I found the batter very thick so it was difficult to swirl and I had to bake the cake for 90 minutes.  It is a dense cake but very tasty - love the crunch on the exterior of the cake.  Great with either ice cream or whipped cream or both!

Fantastic!!! I didn't have my bundt pan so I used a 9x13 pan. I just monitored the baking time and it turned out fabulous. Everyone enjoyed it so much-there were no leftovers! I use part fresh and part frozen blueberries and it came out fine!

Replaced half the sour cream with ricotta -  
and since i was making for my mom who likes blackberries, used blackberries in place of half the blueberries. Turned out awesome, just was a bit rich - Next time would try what someone else here said: using Splenda in placeof some of the sugar. All in all, too good, put 3lbs on me.

This recipe is very forgiving. It tasted great and everyone loved my version of it! I didn't have quite enough sour cream (about 8/10 cup) so I added about 1/5 cup of half and half to bring liquid ratio up. I also didn't have 2 cups of sugar I had about 1 and 4/5 cup. I simply left out the remaining sugar and had no problems. Then I didn't like the baking powder ratio in the cake so I added a smidge more baking powder. Finally, I didn't have pecans so I substituted walnuts. However, by doing it the way I did the cake comes out much less dense than a pound cake.

I made this recipe last night for a get together that we had.  Thee only difference I did was add more blueberries and baked it longer than it stated.  It was definitely at least 10-15 minutes longer.  Make sure you check for doneness with toothpicks or a knife, and they come out clean, otherwise you will have batter in the center that is not done.  Everyone rants and raves over this recipe whenever I make it!  It is a hit and in my personal recipe book for my kids now!

I’ve not cut it yet, but can’t wait!  Easy recipe, I can’t wait to taste it!  It’s still a little warm, so will add more powdered sugar when it’s completely cooled.

The cake came out well but recipe was poorly written as I was bouncing back and forth for ingredient amounts which slowed the process added an element of confusion at times. Great coffee cake

I made no changes.  I manage a small café in my senior community.  My neighbors that frequent the café said it was the best they ever had.  This is coming from other long time bakers. The pecans & brown sugar was a nice surprise & really made the cake, don't leave them out!  Sold out immediately so making another one today for the weekend.

I followed the recipe exactly as written. I found the cake overly sweet wit too much sugar through out the recipe.
I will make it again but cut back the sugar.

My family LOVED this coffee cake.  The only change I made was I used dark brown sugar and that was only because O did not have any Light Brown Sugar.  My 12 year old son said I should sell this to stores.  My husband could not stay out of it. He ate 3 pieces!

Really good and sweet cake. I do think it needs 1 1/2 cups of blueberries. My husband and parents all loved it too.  This was the second time I have made it and it did kinda sink in while cooling but it still looked fine after removing from pan and tasted great!

Took this to our group at church and they devoured it! Lots of yums! I’m at 7600 feet so made changes for high altitude. Scant 2 cups flour, 3 eggs, 1 3/4 cups sugar and 3/4 tsp baking powder. Just for me I added more blueberries! I’ll be making this again!

Nice cake recipe; however, my guests were not sure they liked how the cinnamon played off of the blueberries.

Might be better to leave out the blueberries and increase the amount of nut meats.

Excellent. I always cream butter and sugar until it's so fluffy and light then add other wet ingredients until it returns to the same light, fluffy consistency before slowly adding combined dry ingredients. I folded 2 cups of frozen blueberries coated in about 2 tbsp of flour into the batter with a spatula. I doubled the crumble mixture. I greased and lightly floured the bundt pan. I layered the crumble mixture in the bottom to start then proceeded to layer with batter, crumble, etc (I divided the crumble in 3 and the batter in 2 with layering). I convection baked the cake at 350 for approx. 1.5 hrs. My tester didn't come out completely clean but I decided to take it out of the oven anyway. My husband couldn't wait to try it so he cut it while it was still warm. Despite it being a smidge undercooked he said it tasted like "Heaven". I returned it to the oven at 250 for approx. 15 minutes and with the second slice he said it was "perfect". This was quickly followed by his request that I take it to work before he ate the whole cake : )

This is a delicious recipe. I did think it was a bit too sweet, so next time I'll make it with less sugar.  Instead of baking it in a large bundt pan, I used mini bundt pans, baked them for 35 minutes, and did everything else the same and they turned out great. Because the batter was so thick, I put the batter in a bag and piped it into the pans. I will definitely make this again.

yummiest cake ever and my family's favorite number 1 ever since I made it. My family doesn't eat eggs and that is why, I simply omit he eggs and add little more butter, cut down the sugar a little and the the perfect cake is ready.

Made 1st one exactly as written and turned out amazing, second time I made it, I added the fresh blueberries and blueberries cooked down with sugar and used it to make a ribbon of blues throughout the cake. It too was divine and I can’t wait to make it again with other fruits

Its not fair that i can only give this recipe 5* when it deserves at least100!!!! Easy to make, made exactly as written. Extremely moist and flavorful. The only negative is that my co workers love this cake so much that I'm left with little to no leftovers to bring back home. Thank you so very much for this amazing recipe. It'll make you appear to be a world class baker!!!!!!!!!!!

AMAZING!! I have made this so many time and every time I am still surprised by how much I love it! In later recipes, I have started to added more berries but only because I LOVE blueberries!!!

Amazing!   This is one of the best recipes i’ve made for a cake.  We had just returned from Maine with fresh blueberries so I did increase the amount to nearly 2 cups.  I did reduce sugar and butter a touch.  Came out beautifully and did not collapse.  I let it sit until 100% cool so that probably helped with keeping it’s shape.  I have frozen blueberries from Maine and will be among several more times.

Awesome! 5 stars as is.   Ignore posts that rate this poorly when they don’t follow directions.  Use a bundt pan, Cream butter and sugar properly and use fresh blueberries, bake 60 minutes as indicated.  Will rise fine and flour ratio is perfect.  It amazes me that people will even rate a recipe when they don’t even make the recipe (as written) that is submitted.

The only thing I did differently was I did not mix the blueberries into the cake batter. I put half the blueberries on top of the brown sugar/cinnamon layer in the middle and the other half on top. None of the blueberries fell to the bottom so it made a pretty presentation. Amazingly delish!

Complete failure!!! I have made numerous similar cakes in the past and never had it fail like this one.  I followed the recipe exactly. When I took the cake out of the pan  it broke in half with  half sticking to the pan.  Yes I liberally coated the pan with crisco and flour.  Middle was not done and very wet.  What a waste of ingredients and time!!!!!

Absolutely delicious!  I made this for a special back-to-school breakfast for the teachers on my hall and it disappeared quickly -- it was "on point" as one person commented!  No problems with baking -- moist and it smelled good!  One note -- the batter was quite thick and had to be spread carefully.  Calories didn't count today -- starting next week we really don't get time to eat!

Tok advice from comments and did 3/4 cup butter and only 1 cup sugar. Used fresh blueberries and tossed them in little bit of flour in zip lock bag prior to mixing into the batter. Moist and delicious cake, unbelievably delicious. Ten star for sure.

This cake is very moist and delicious. I added about 1/4 cup more blueberries than called for.  Instead of sprinkling on icing sugar, I served with a dollop of whipping cream. This cake was a huge hit!  I would like to try reducing the sugar to 1 1/2 - 1 3/4 cups as I did find it rather sweet but nobody else did.  Best blueberry coffee type cake ever!

I made this as written and am rating it as such. I found it way too sweet. I will make it again but will leave out that quantity of the brown sugar, putting cinnamon and pecans in the center. I saw one reviewer's comment about it being heavy and falling on itself and I think that was very true for my result. I might also back off and use half as much sour cream. The cake part itself was very fluffy, so I know I didn't over-mix. Thanks for a delicious, great recipe.

Wow what a great cake!!! I took it to work and my coworkers loved it.   Told me I should have been arrested for making such a delicious cake.   Adding it to my keeper recipe box.   

I did make a few changes as some other bakers suggested.   I used 1/2 cup less sugar and substituted the zest and juice of a lemon instead of vanilla.    I also made a different streusel.   1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 3 TBS of butter.   Mix to a crumbly mixture and 1/2 cup of chopped macadamia nuts.   

The lemon really compliments the blueberries.   The streusel with macadamias is also light in flavor and doesn't take away from the blueberries.  Try my changes!

I followed the recipe except substituted nonfat Greek yogurt for the sour cream and made it in a 9x13" pyrex dish. I doubled the topping and did not divide it  or put half in the center-just piled it all on top. Used walnuts instead of pecans. It was gone before the barbecue was half way over! I did not really time it --just took it out when the bottom was slightly browned and the topping crunchy. Really delicious.

Yummy yummy YUMMY!!!!!
Only change I made was I didn’t have pecans so I mixed in almond meal instead. Otherwise I made it exactly as the recipe. SO GOOD!!!!! Some of my fresh picked blueberries off our plants were a little underripe so the tartness was a great contrast to the sweetness of the cake.

If I could I'd give this a minus zero I would.  I followed the recipe exactly.  After 60 minutes it was still soupy in the middle.  I baked it 15 minutes longer and it fell when I took it out to cool.  Then I could not get it out of the bunt pan.  I had to dig it out.  We had to throw it out;  A big waste of time and money.

I've made this four times. It is absolutely delicious, but very disappointing because I've tried using more time but it came out like a rock. When I follow the recipe exactly (once with frozen and once with fresh blueberries) it always sinks in the middle and breaks apart when trying to wrap it. I've used a bundt pan (didn't cook through), two loaf pans, bottoms and middles are soft and broke apart.  I wish someone could tell me if they know what is wrong or a suggestion for the future.

I made this as per the recipe and then made one using non fat plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and Smart Balance buttery spread instead of butter for a slightly healthier option. My husband loved the original recipe and loved  the “healthier” one even more!

I have made this recipe two ways. I modified the sugar by 1/3, blueberries, I added about 1/2 cup more and they were frozen so had to cook longer as they were frozen,  the other variation I made was with two sliced apples mixed win 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup pecans. And layered them with half the batter and then on top of the batter, cooked 60 minutes and both were amazing.  The blueberry was more dense but great. I also glazed with icing sugar/cream/vanilla, and zig zagged on top as cake was warm. Icing hardened and was easy to cut into pieces.

Would have given this recipe 5 stars but I altered it “a bit”. Made a few changes because I only had a stick of butter and don’t like nuts in my cakes. So adjusted recipe as follows: 1 cup sugar; 1 3/4 cups flour; 1 1/2 tsp baking powder; 3/4 cup fresh blueberries; 1/4 cup dried cranberries; 1 cup plus 2 tbs sour cream; zest of small lemon. Eggs, vanilla and salt measurements were as listed in the recipe. Was moist and dense the way  my family and I like it and not sugary sweet.  Disappeared in less than a day! Compliments and pleas  to bake another continue.

I doubled the blueberries and it was  a fantastic coffee cake  !  It was a dense batter so I baked it in a Pyrex dish.  I will decrease the sugar next time.

It didn’t come out of the bundt cake pan worth a darn so I would fold in the brown sugar/cinnamon/nut mixture before putting it in the pan.

Made this on a Sunday afternoon and before I had a second piece my husband and kids almost finished it. I would give 5 stars but like a lot of the reviews I read it kinda sunk in on itself. I will definitely make it again but will listen to the reviews and use less butter and sugar to see if it makes a difference. Regardless it was delicious

This was delicious, no doubt about it, but very very sweet. I will definitely make this again but I will try reducing the sugar by half a cup. Not the healthiest start to the morning but sometimes what is not the best food for our body might be a sweet treat for the soul. Besides, eaten before noon means most the empty calories are burned before the end of the day.

Easy to make, but WAY TOO SWEET! Next time I will put in a half cup of sugar less and more blueberries. Also, the pecan/sugar combo in the middle was unnecessary. Add it to the base if you like...

This is a delicious recipe.  Everyone loves it.  It never lasts long after I make it.  I too doubled the blueberries as recommended by others.  Also it taste so much better after it sets and all of the ingredients gel together.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars for 2 reasons: it is indeed too wet to be a coffee cake, and the number of extra minutes bake time for frozen blueberries was not indicated. Other than that, this recipe is delicious!! I made alterations as suggested by others: reduced sugar to 1.5 cup, reduced butter to 3/4 cup, put a tad more than a cup for blueberries, and added some cinnamon to the dry ingredients. This cake is moist and very tasty. Enjoy.

Great recipe! I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of olive oil. It turned out excellent! Next time I might try olive oil only.

Very good cake, I have made it twice now.  I left out the chopped nuts and just used the brown sugar in cinnamon.  The blueberries do not sink to the bottom which is nice.

I made the blueberry sour cream coffee cake. It was delicious! I will definitely make this again! I needed less carbs and sugar so I substituted most of the flour with almond flour (used little all purpose flour just for consistency). I substituted most of the sugar with Splenda and substituted most of light brown sugar with Coconut sugar. I am allergic to pecans so I used chopped walnuts. It was amazingly moist and my coworkers loved it as well. There was no bad after taste from substituting the flour and sugar. I absolutely loved it!

The best coffee cake I've made so far! I used a little less white sugar, a little less butter, added more blueberries, and substituted 1/2 c of the flour with whole wheat flour. Kids loved it!

Except for adding more blueberries, I followed the recipe as written. It was delicious and I will be making again for the breakfast meeting I put on every month. Next time I will try putting all of the brown sugar filling in the middle. When you put the topping on top of the cake, then flip it over, a lot of the topping just falls off.

Fabulous recipe!  I subbed out the all-purpose flour for gluten free Cup4Cup and it came out great.  Gluten-free coffee cake!  Yum! Also added some extra blueberries (can't have enough!)

I did make some changes.   This recipe to my old tastebuds had way too much sugar.   I cut the sugar to a cup and a half and eliminated the middle filling of pecans and brown sugar.
     It was the most delightful blueberry pound cake I think we have ever had and it was plenty sweet enough.  
     The batter will be quite stiff if you use frozen berries.   I used organic because they tend to have a bit more tangy flavor.  

       Full credit to the use of butter and real sugar real sour cream, and real blueberries.    This did not last very long at my house.  
I think it would be equally good with raspberries, or blackberries.

I made the recipe as is except I reduced the butter to ¾ c, the sugar to 1 & ½ c (and I only had raw sugar, not white) and used 2 c of blueberries. My batter was way too dry, in order to work with it I had to add about ¼ cup of cream (5%). I put too much batter at first before I did the cinnamon/pecan mixture so it was too close to the last layer and apparently, I pretty much suck at 'swirling,' lol. Despite ALL of these mistakes, my cake turned out moist but not heavy and very tasty! Knowing what I know now, I would do the same measurements however, I may try alternating ribbons next time. One layer of the cinnamon/pecans, batter, blueberries, batter, cinnamon/pecans, batter, blueberries and the last of the batter just for kicks...

Delicious! Used 3/4 cup butter and 1 1/2 cup sugar per a review, otherwise as written. Only issue was that it stuck a bit - maybe due to blueberries. But it's SO good! Will make again. Thanks.

Tasty but far far too sweet. If I were to make it again, I would stir the pecans into the batter with the blueberries.  I'd also sprinkle them into the bottom of the pan for a "crust" over the top once it's out of the pan. Eliminate the brown sugar altogether. It doesn't add much and makes the cake want to split and be heavy and gooey.  The batter was really good and has a lot of potential, just needs some adjustments to suit my taste.

I made this without the pecan/brown sugar/cinnamon layer, as my husband and I don't like nuts in most baked goods.  We both LOVED this, and will definitely make again. Thanks!

Made this 4 times. First time, excellent, everybody loved it for a morning coffee cake . Second time, I was drunk and forgot to put the sugar in. Needless to say it didn't turn out too good. Third time I thought more is better so I added a lot more blueberries. Took a lot longer to bake but came out good. Made it a 4th time per the instructions, came out great again. Fourth time made a small simple confectioners sugar glaze and it was great again (the glaze isn' t really needed)

I made this cake and it was a huge hit! I had to use frozen blueberries and substituted Splenda for sugar to help out all of our diabetics. It was great and very flavorful. I will say that the amount of batter doesn't fill the pan as much as I think it should so it isn't very high, The taste however is wonderful. I am actually baking another one now, so I will fall back on this recipe from time to time..

This tasted great but had trouble with it sticking to pan despite having greased and floured. Will increase that next time. Also added 2 cups of blueberries and certainly did not seem like too many. Think I would also add more cinnamon. Definitely will make again.

I cut down on the amount of  the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture as I thought it already had quite a bit of sugar in it.  It was very good, heavy like a pound cake, but  everyone liked it.

Delicious!  I prepared exactly as the recipe stated only leaving out the nuts as I didn't have any.  I did find that I had to bake it about 15 minutes longer than stated.  Everyone loved it including those who said they wouldn't like it!

I have been getting tons of blueberries from my tard this year so I decided to make this cake.  It is delish!  the only thing I changed was I used 1 cup of regular sugar but the rest of the sugar I used Splenda.  It turned out amazing.

I only put one cup of white sugar in it instead of two.  It was still too sweet.  Next time I would reduce the white sugar to 3/4 cup.  It didn't rise as much as I thought it should but it tasted good.  I topped it with blueberry sauce and everyone loved it.

Made it for the first time this morning.  I added a few more blueberries!  Family loved it -- its now a new Blueberry favorite.  Also since the season for fresh berries is here I used them!  I will be trying the recipe again with frozen berries this winter.

Because the recipe called for sour cream, shouldn't it also have about 1/4 tsp of baking soda?  I added it, turned out fine.

I've made this 4 times in the last 6 weeks.  It is really good.  I've kept the recipe pretty true. You can use walnuts instead of pecans.  When blueberrries are available increase to 1 1/2 cups. 
I would consider removing it from the oven at about 45 minutes.  ( BTW 1 5/8 cup of flour is 1 cup plus 10 Tablespoons.)

I revised the recipe per the reviews from others. Took sugar down to 1 cup, butter to 3/4 cup, and upped the flour to 2 cups. Turned out perfectly.  Was moist but not too heavy. Will definitely make it again.

Didn't have blueberries so just used the frozen mixed Walmart pineapple and mango and peach mix that was in the freezer.  Thawed it and cut bitesized.  Easy recipe, really moist cake, and people think I'm a baking genius. Baking time was right on in my cast iron bundt.  Great breakfast cake option if you are feeding ravenous children.

Delicious!  I added 2 cups of blueberries and that was the perfect amount.  Cake was moist and has just the right amount of sweetness.  I'll be adding this recipe to the family cookbook for sure.

Excellent coffee cake.  I didn't put the pecans filling in it, but i used the brown sugar and cinnamon on the top.  So good, could be used for muffins too has just the right texture.  Yum.

Very yummy, but very sweet.  Will make again, but will omit the streusel and lessen the sugar in the cake.  Thanks for sharing!

I didn't have the bunt pan- so modified to make in a 9x13 pan.  Cake batter same recipe. Almost doubled the  brown sugar/cinnamon /chopped pecan mix.  Used 3 cups of fresh blueberries mixed into cake batter. Spread half batter in greased/floured pa; used a bit more than half of sugar- nut mix topped w/ remaining batter; finished off w/ nut mix; swirl topping into cake batter.  Everyone loved it- said it was not too sweet

This is amazing! I made this about a month ago and I think I followed the directions exactly as described. Definitely not healthy, but I will definitely be making this again.

Turned out great! I did modify a few things due to ingredient restraints/diet. 1. I used banana Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. 2. I used 1.5c of organic whole wheat flour. 3. I used 4oz of applesauce in lieu of all butter. 4. I didn't mix in the pecan/cinnamon/brown sugar mixture, instead I added it last. 5. I used slightly less sugar than the recipe called for.  End result=DELICIOUS! I will add powdered sugar once it cools :)

Awesome!  Fantastic cake!  I don't believe in giving out 5 stars for a recipe, if you have to change a bunch of steps.  Any recipe is made to fiddle with, but this one works the way it's written.  I made this once for a family get together and now it gets requested all the time.  Have given out the recipe numerous times.  Love it!

Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!  This is the best coffee cake I have made or eaten.  Made it according to recipe except I doubled the cinnamon, pecans and blueberries.  Turned out beautifully and did not collapse.  Followed mixing instructions from other reviews.  This definitely is a "keeper".

I did decrease the butter to 1 1/2 sticks and the sugar by 1/2 cup. I also made mine in a 9x13.  It turned out a little dry, but that's because I'm not the best baker! I may give it another try. It's still good. Not too much stops me from enjoying baked goods! I love blueberries too!

Excellent.  I would add more blueberries next time. Maybe 1/2 cup or so.  I used  frozen berries, coated them with flour before adding so as to prevent them from bleeding.

Made several more times with extra berries and definitely coat berries with flour.

Addictive and delicious!  I made as written except for pecans.  Oh, and I used a half cup less of white sugar.  Would have been great with them though!  Used frozen blueberries and for once it didn't turn my cake purple!  I could try and coat them with flour before adding next time to see if it helps even more.  One thing I will change for next time - the sugar!  Way too much!  Although delicious, this cake definitely didn't taste healthy.  I would decrease sugar by another half cup and decrease the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture by half.  Also, next time I may try plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  With these changes I just may be able to make it more often and not feel so bad!  I did not let the cake cool for very long  in the pan and for that reason only the top half came out when I flipped it ??  Definitely need to cool it completely!

I had intended to follow the recipe exactly, but I didn't have a bundt pan so I used a deep dish glass baking pan. I used 2 tbsp of the butter to grease it with, but used the rest in the recipe & floured the dish as well. When I opened my frozen blueberries they were tiny, tart & caked in ice so I rinsed in cold water, drained well & used a salad spinner to remove all the water. I used all the sugar since they were so tart, & used 2 cups of them instead of just 1. I used the same temperature, but it took forever to bake. I thought it would burn it took so long, but I just kept checking with a knife every 10 minutes until finally decided it was "close enough". I let it cool, but decided to just leave in the bowl to serve in case it still wasn't done. The inside was moist & delicious - perfect sweetness - the bottom crust was caramelized & crunchy to die for. Served with vanilla ice cream. Favorite new thing I've made in ages!  This is probably to see if you use big plump sweet blueberries. Great for huckleberries or a tart berry. Otherwise cut back the sugar, but you might lose the caramel then?  I don't know. That would be a shame!

This was the best Blueberry Coffee Cake I have ever made.
I thought the sour cream would help with the moisture and I was right. It was also very simple.

Excellent moist cake.  I did cut the sugar to 1 1/4 cups and the butter to 1 1/2 sticks and used frozen berries that I tossed in flour to coat.  I was asked for the recipe by the two people I served it to. Will make again and will put the pecan cinnamon mixture in bundt pan first to have a topping when turned out onto plate.

Delicious.  I used 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 2.  I made it twice this week, once for home and once for work.

The  ratio of wet to dry ingredients seems off and the cake turned out okay but rather more soggy than desirable.  I did follow what other reviewers  suggested and reduced the butter to 1 1/2 sticks, the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and used 1 3/4 cups of blueberries.  I gave the bake time another few minutes for the extra blueberries, 70 minutes.  The batter was cooked but still sort of soggy.  If I were to make this again, I would use 2 cups of flour and 1 cup of blueberries and add 1 teaspoon of baking soda as well.  This cake did rise but not as much as my other coffee cake recipe does and probably mainly because of the low flour content.

Delicious. I decreased the sugar by 1/2 cup, increased the blueberries to two cups and added some lemon zest to brighten the berry taste.  It deflated after baking, but that is what makes it coffee cake instead of cake. All loved it.

Loved it! I made one minor change (11/2 cups of sugar instead of 2) and used walnuts instead (I didn't have pecan handy). The cake turned out super moist and yummy! Will definitely make it again.

Delicious!  I made it for our Tailgate Party and it was devoured.  I have now been assigned to bring this to every Ole Miss home game.  I did not change the recipe at all, and didn't have any of the 'collapsing cake' issues that some others have mentioned.  I don't know if that was because I used the "convection" setting on my oven?  

My only mistake was dusting the top with powdered sugar before leaving home instead of immediately before serving as recommended.  By the time we got to the Grove the powdered sugar had disappeared into this ultra-moist cake.

I made this cake today, first off, I didn't know there was a video (duh) I should have watched it first! Anyway, it came out good, but I don't think I creamed the ingredients properly. For instance the recipe doesn't say to cube the butter, so I just threw it in whole but it was softened, and also it doesn't say to use a beater, so I beat it by hand. I had all ingredients except pecans on hand, so I threw in slivered almonds.  I baked it for 60 minutes and let it cool, but cake was stuck to pan even though I greased and floured it. It took a while for it to fall out.  Overall the cake was a bit too crumbly but still tasted good.  I will make it again-the right way this time!  Thanks...

I thoroughly enjoyed  this coffee cake, as did the rest of my family!!  I made it again , today, only substituted diced apples in place of the blueberries. Also, to make it even more decadent, before chopping the pecans, I buttered them in my hands, then toasted, to bring out the oils in the pecans. YUM!!! Also, on this go round, I didn't want to sprinkle the powdered sugar onto it, so tried to come up with something for a delicious topping. Opted to make a buttercream frosting, then made a 1/2 batch of the filling( cinnamon, brown sugar and toasted pecans), and added it to the buttercream frosting! OH, my! Delicious!!! I will have to use that frosting again! I think the next time, when I make it with the blueberries, which was DELICIOUS, I will cut back somewhat on the cinnamon, maybe just 1/2 teaspoonful. It was very good, but I think I would have liked less cinnamon, which covered up the blueberry taste to a small degree. No MATTER WHAT, THIS ONE'S A KEEPER! :)

We generally follow a new recipe exactly the first time; enough reviewers suggesting reducing the butter and the sugar that we followed that suggestion.  I can't imagine that more butter and/or sugar would have improved this cake.  It was fine with less.

I don't know what went wrong. It collapsed and was not completely cooked. I have a new oven, so perhaps I over beat it! 
I will try it again. Extremely moist.

Definitely a keeper! Made exactly as written. Took some to work and was flooded with recipe requests. Is super dense and moist - I refrigerated what I took to work since it made cutting into slices easier.

The cake is delicious .  I decreased white sugar by 1/4 cup.  Because I was in a hurry, I had trouble getting cake out of pan and did not let it cool long enough.  The powdered sugar covered my sin, but a real hit!

This is one of the best coffee cakes I have ever made! So many compliments.  I added 1 cup of pecans instead of 1/2 cup. I also added 1 teaspoon of lemon juice to the blueberries before combining. This will be one I will make over & over again. Thank you!

I was so disappointed! About half way through the cooking time, I lowered the temp to 325, because st 350, it was getting to brown to leave  baking for an hour. 
BUT,  when time was up, I took it out, cooled well, served, and it wasn't cooked well enough in the middle. I had done the toothpick test and it was fine.

It was really good. I added 2 cups of blueberries which made it dense and a little soft. But we liked it. I almost thought it was better the next day!

This is absolutely one of my favorite dessert / coffee cakes ever! I did add a little more frozen blueberries (about 1 1/2 C. but I thawed them at room temperature, and decreased the white sugar buy 1/4 cup. Then I used that sugar to sprinkle on the top instead of confectioner's sugar. This was the most delicious moist blueberry cake I've ever had.

This cake is delicious!  Moist and tasty and, best of all, so easy to prepare.  A definite keeper!  The only change I made was to make a blueberry compote to serve on top of the cake.  My company raved about it.  I had a piece with no compote and it was wonderful.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I prepared the cake to be served for six people and made no changes. Unfortunately, only four people were able to try the cake because my 12 year old grandson ate almost all of the cake.  So, I would have to give it a five star. Next time, I will reduce the amount of sugar to 1 1/2 cups as it was a bit too sweet for my husband and myself. Otherwise, very moist and although unhealthy, it was very good.

I enjoyed this recipe for the most part. I prepared it as written this time. It was moist and had a really great flavor. The combination of blueberries, sour cream and brown sugar sold me on this cake. I'll definitely make the cake again, but (and this is why I'm rating it down one star) I think it was overall too sweet as written. I'll cut back on the sugars next time.

Oh my gosh – I think this is the best thing I've ever baked! And I bake a lot! I actually made it for dessert last night and it is already half gone. I omitted the pecans because my kids aren't crazy about nuts, and it worked just great without them. This is going to be a much requested item in our house! My husband already texted me this morning to tell me how great the blueberry coffee cake was!

Very Good! Moist, but a little too sweet even with reduced sugar. The recipe was easy to follow and the cake baked and came out of the pan well. Definitely will make again but with less sugar. Plan to freeze portions to have later.

I cut the sugar down to 1 cup and increased the blueberries to 2 cups. I also used 1 cup of stick margarine rather than butter. This is an easy recipe to make and I will definitely try it again.

I have made this a few times and we all loved it.  I had extra fresh berries so I made it and froze it.....needless to say it was wonderful.  It can be made a few days early and if you like slice and freeze the leftovers so when you are feeling a need for something yummy or you have unexpected company you have a piece and not a whole cake.  whipcream the top and sprinkle a few nuts or currants, etc. on top and yummmm!

I made it and it was great. The next time I used 1 cup of  applesauce instead of butter. It was still very good and very moist and lot less fat and calories. Reduce the sugar to 1&1/2 cups and you have less calories as well as fat.

This looks like a good recipe if it's tweaked a bit. I wouldn't double it, rather make it twice in 2 Bundt pans. Some recipes don't double well!
To make this lighter I will try Greek yogurt, 6 oz unsalted butter and  a lot less sugar. 
Might separate the eggs and whip the whites or the whole eggs to add some aeration before I blend  with the rest of the wet ingredients.
Tempted to use maple syrup  but probably would be too much liquid. I wish I could get maple sugar around here! Maybe extract. I have some that's not artificial. 
Giving it 4 stars since this is inspirational!

I love this recipe!  It tastes great.  I substitute non fat yogurt for the sour cream and it works great.

I've made this three times. The first time I tried it with 2 loaf pans. The cake didn't cook all the way but it was so delicious that I ended up breaking it up and spreading on a cookie sheet to finish cooking. I kept it in the freezer for snacking. The last two times I used a 9x13 pan with no problems. I love the brown sugar/pecan topping and like swirling it as it doesn't burn and stays put when enjoying piece after piece!  This is a "take anywhere" cake. Delicious!!

I made this twice.  The cake tasted very good but it was too dense and not cooked on the bottom even though I let it bake an extra 15 minutes at least.  Next time I make it, I'll reduce the sugar and butter, and fold in the dry mixture by hand as others suggested.

This cake is delicious as written.  I used to make it often during the spring when blueberries are plentiful (and free).  A few years ago, however, I was diagnosed with celiacs.  I have learned to effectively substitute gluten free items to produce an equally delicious product. For the flour, I use Bob’s Red Mill all purpose flour.  I use yogurt instead of sour cream.  (The sour cream caused my batter to “explode” in the oven and leave a dry crusty chasm in the middle of the cake.)  I used ½ cup vegetable shortening and ½ cup coconut oil in place of the butter – frankly, because I had no butter.  I baked it in a springform pan for no special reason.  I kept everything else the same. Every scrumptiously delicate morsel was light, fluffy, and delicious! Oh, by the way, I omitted the pecans because I had already eaten them.

Far too sweet.  But that's just us.  We don't like super sweet cakes.  I wish I had read the reviews and cut back on the sugar and done what one reviewer did and make just a layer of blueberries on top of the brown sugar mixture

This was amazing and that was after I lightened it up substantially. I used 1/2 cup butter  and 1/4 cup apple sauce. I reduced the white sugar to 1 1/4 cups and substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream. It was very flavorful and moist. Next time I would use at least 1 1/2 cups blueberries

I will definitely make this again -- everyone loved it! I did make a few changes based on others' feedback: 3/4 cup butter, 1 1/2 cups white sugar, 1 3/4 cups fresh blueberries, light sour cream and I dusted the pecans with flour before adding to the batter. I also put about 1/3 of the topping in the pan first to get the caramel effect on top. It wasn't heavy at all.

We loved it!  I made this just as the recipe was written except I mistakenly turned the oven off when I set the timer and didn't notice it for 25 minutes.  I immediately turned it back in and cooked it about 5 minutes longer than the time listed in the recipe.  It still turned out great.

My 82 year old mother who has cooked all of her life, absolutely loved this. I have to give it a 5 star rating and I didn't change much. If anything, I used a touch more flour. I ended up baking it in a 8 or 9 inch square pan so I am not sure on the time that it was in the oven. I tend to take things out based on look and smell. It was excellent and I usually require chocolate somewhere in the recipe to earn 5 stars. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I skipped the cinnamon and brown sugar middle and didn't make a drizzle for the top - it would be too sweet for me.  I added 2 1/4 tbspns of fresh (from the tree) lemon juice.  It was really good and I'll make it again.  But, not too soon as it is not the healthiest of breakfasts.  Next time I may try chocolate chips instead of blueberries to experiment.

This is a wonderful cake recipe! I have made it a couple of times now and each time I ask myself why so much time has elapsed since I last made it. 
I did make some changes to cut back on the fat content in it, which is what I do with all of my cake & muffin recipes -- half the amount of fat that is called for and the other half unsweetened applesauce.....great moisture and flavour are always retained.

This is an easy cake to make.  I've made it several times and the only change I've made was to add finely grated lemon rind.   It's perks it up.  Everyone that I've shared the cake with loves it.

This recipe has some potential but it is way too sweet and the baking time is too short. I would use one cup of sugar max, and bake it 1.5 hrs next time.

Tastes just like the Cake Pops from Starbucks! This is a very dense, heavy, moist cake.  I had to let it bake a few extra minutes so it wouldn't be gooey. Also, it didn't seem to rise quite as high as other cakes I've made (I used a bundt pan), but I think that's because it is rather heavy and dense. But the flavor and texture are just beyond delicious! We all kept snitching bites of it when no one was looking! Will definitely make this again!

The cake is sweet rich and moist, tastes great and is really unhealthy. I followed the directions and have to say this is tricky to bake, mine cooked 90min at 350F to get to the point where a butter knife would come out clean-ish. The outside was dark brown but not burnt.  Definitely bake a practice one first, if your a perfectionist.

VERY GOOD.
Used 1 cup of sugar, 1 3/4 cups of flour, 2 cups of fresh blueberries.  For the center used 3 tbsp brown sugar and  1/2 tsp cinnamon.  Did not use pecans and  confectioners sugar.  Remove cake from pan 10-15 minutes or cake will stick to the pan.

Very easy to make. I coated the blueberries in flour so they wouldn't sink to the bottom of the batter. I also added more blueberries as other reviewers have suggested (about double). This was the best bundt cake I've ever had and everyone loved it.

I thought I could just Pam the pan but I should have floured the pan also, it stuck to the pan. But, I pulled it out and put it in a 13 by 9 pan in pieces and told my son and his friends it was blueberry cobbler and they loved it so did I.

This turned out great! Made it the night before it was eaten (aside from the gouge my son stole while cooling). Cake was perfectly moist throughout. I have read about people having trouble with cake sticking, I used regular non-stick spray and it fell right out with ease--maybe due to it being a brand new nonstick pan though. I will certainly make this one again!

What a wonderful breakfast cake! Works well with both fresh or frozen blueberries. Also, just made it substituting the blueberries with chocolate chips.  It was a big hit. I'm also going to try raisins, dates and cranberries. This is definitely a keeper.

Amazing! I followed the suggestions by reducing butter, sugar and increeased the blueberries. IT seems there is cream inside the cake.

This was the best blueberry coffee cake I have ever eaten. I did make a couple of changes.  I accidentally left out the butter because I microwaved it, to soften the butter, and forgot to add  it.  I  also used whey curds instead of sour cream.  I realized that I forgot the butter and panicked.  The cake was moist and delicious without all the butter.  A little dab of whipped cream on the warm cake and you will be in heaven. My boyfriend and I ate the  whole cake in two days.

I used frozen strawberries, and liked the way it turned out.  I will try it again.  Very nice consistency, and the top turned out nice.  I think it may have sunk in a bit, but not enough to be an issue for us.

I made this exactly as written and it was fabulous. The only change I will make next time is to put all of the "streusel" in the middle. Didn't really stay on the bottom once the cake was inverted on a serving dish.

Very, very dense but moist cake.  As other's noted, it is more like a pound cake with it's density.   The only problem I had with it?  Both times I made it I could not get it to drop out of the Bundt pan.  I used the shortening/flour method, the cooking spray with flour...even soaked it in a bath of cool water and it would not budge.  Ended up just cutting it in the pan and scooping out.  However, that was my error.  The cake is wonderful...even scooped out.  ;-)

This was very moist, almost pudding-like in the middle, and delicious. everyone loved it. I cut the white sugar in half, per usual, and it was plenty sweet - especially with the blueberries.

I bake a lot and everyone always enjoys my recipes but since I made this one, everyone always requests it and now I find it hard to bake anything else as this is the recipe everyone wants and they are disappointed if I turn up with anything else.

I cook it exactly as the recipe states and it is perfect.  Thank you so much for adding this recipe!!!  It is a staple for me, my friends and family.

I reduced the sugar to 1 3/4 cups, replaced pecans with walnuts, added 1 tsp of lemon zest, and also 1/8 tsp nutmeg to the brown sugar mixture. Baked at 175 degrees for 55 mins then 180 for 30 mins (for 9 inch round pan). I was in a hurry to go out so left it in the hot oven after it's done. When I came back after 2 hrs, it was still very warm and it didn't sink/collapse. It was still quite sweet at the 1st taste but Sinfully NICE! It made me craved for more! I would suggest not to reduce the butter if you are going to keep it for the next day. I did not reduced mine but it doesn't taste as buttery the next day. I think next time I will reduce my sugar to 1 1/2 cup and  increase the lemon zest to 2 tsp and the rest shall remain as what I did above. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Will definitely make this again! I used the suggestions of reducing to 3/4 cup butter and 1-1/2 cups sugar. I used my stand mixer to cream butter and sugar, and then add in eggs, sour cream, and vanilla (gentle mixing). But then I stirred in my dry mixture and blueberries by hand. I coated the blueberries in a flour dusting before adding them to keep my batter from being tinted. Things I will do differently next time: 1) bake for 65 minutes, and 2) use only half of the brown sugar mixture by placing it in the middle of my batter only and not using more on top. Too sweet for us.

1st attempt at a bundt cake and it was a total success. followed direction exactly. took longer to put together, but i'm a new cook so that's to be expected. i cooked it at 350 for 55 minutes. i live at sea level (if that is important). let it cool for roughly an hour. it came out perfect. the only thing i skipped was the confectioner's sugar.

I loved this coffee cake.  I made it just as it is shown.  I whipped the wet ingredients well and stirred in the dry ingredients.  Of course I gently folded in the fresh blueberries.  The cake turned out moist and delicious.  The blueberries did not sink to the bottom, but were throughout the cake and the cake did not collapse.  I am not sure what I did to prevent this other than whipping the wet ingredients really well.  I took this to my quilt group meeting and everyone loved it.

Outside was chewy, inside was dense.  Very unusual in that respect but it was good.  A little too sweet for me, and I omitted the powdered sugar.

Too sweet for me with 2 cup sugar. My 18 year old sugar addicted son thought it perfect. Very rich, and that is a good thing.  If you are going to be bad...do it right!  1 1/3 cup sugar and double the berries!

If you are looking for healthy, keep looking. This is one recipe for a special occasion, and when you want to impress and delight your guests. As others have said: I used 3/4 cup butter, and 1 1/2 c. sugar. I used a heaping cup of thawed frozen blueberries. I mixed the blueberries with a T of flour, and sprinkled them in on top of the streusel mixture that went in the middle of the cake. Convection oven: 325 degrees, 1 hour in a heavy duty bundt pan. So good, my guests requested it again for dessert.

I halved this recipe and made 10 muffins out of it. I did use half brown sugar in the batter and didnt quite have enough sour cream so I subbed about a tablespoon or so of greek yogurt. The other reviewers were right! Too much butter!!! The pecans are best limited to a very small amount, the butter reduced. Other than this, they are pretty good! Mine turned out tasting butterscotchy and almost gooey, which I wasn't a fan of, but I could tell that they would have been better with less butter and pecans.

Tasted great! I did cook it an additional 30 mins because it was still jiggly after the recommended baking time. The cake fell at the top but since it became the bottom, I was still happy.

Good, but too sweet for me ( and I used one and a half cups of sugar).  I used very plump, sweet blueberries.  Maybe next time I will try with smaller, more tart blueberries.  Also, may try cake flour instead of all-purpose and definitely no more than one and a half cups sugar.

Outstanding. My man and I were tempted to eat the entire cake in one sitting. Moist, delicate center,mildly sweet, right amount of blueberries, and a crisp exterior. Coffee cake perfection.

I ABSOLUTELLY love this recipie. Everyone that I make it for loves it. But right now being the fall, I'm wondering how it would be with apples instead of blueberries, anyone have any luck with swapping the fruit out for seasonal fruit?

The first time I made this recipe as-is, and it turned out perfectly with rave reviews. The second time I added 1/2c more blueberries and was equally as happy. Happy baking!

I baked it nearly 70 mins and the bottom was still not fully cooked, the cake fell right out of the pan. I used a convection oven which I use for  all my baking so I don't think that was the problem.

I've made this recipe several times and I absolutely love it. It is the most yummy, moist coffee cake ever. I shared this during a New Years Eve party and it was a huge hit. I've made with just blue berries and I've also made it with blueberries and raspberries. It was yummy both ways.

This was the best blueberry coffee cake I ever made!! It is very heavy, moist and delicious, just the way I like it!! I may try to cut back sugar to 1 1/2 cups next time just to see if it affects the taste. This will be my go-to blueberry coffee cake recipe from now on!

I baked for sports event for my kids.  They sold ice coffee and I baked this cake to go along with it.  It was more than good enough to sell.  A few things though I think I would change in recipe.  It was too sweat for even for my kids and that's a good indication to reduce sugar.  I would make with 1 cup sugar.  Also, sour cream without any liquid except for eggs is a little too thick to mix.  It could create over-mixing or some flour could remain dry without liquid. I would add some milk to make mixing easier.

Have made this several times for us & neighbors.  I do use 1 1/2 c sugar & may have to try 1 1/3 cups sugar or less.  I've been doing 1/2 the brown sugar, cinnamon & pecan mixture  & it is much better.  Using the entire amount is just way to sweet for us.  This is a big hit & goes fast.  I've even made this when I only had 3/4 c of sour cream & it still was great.

This was a disaster. It was wayy too heavy. The cake actually sunk on top of itself. It was too sweet. It fell to pieces after sitting and cooling in the fridge for 2 hours. I will never make this again and I don't recommend anyone else to make it either.

First made this for an Easter gathering and it was a hit. I have made it again multiple times in the last 3 months for company, as birthday cake and just because, and it always gets a great response.  I highly recommend watching the video before you start. I toss the blueberries in a little extra flour before folding in as suggested. I have done this when using both fresh and frozen blueberries. No need to change the recipe cause it is great just the way it is written!

The BEST blueberry cake!!  Loved it!  I will make it again soon.  I will also cut back the white sugar next time to 1 cup and I think it doesn't need that much sugar.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

This was just too sweet. I would definitely cut down on the sugar and the streusel .  I also think putting half the streusel at the bottom (fluted part) of the bundt pan would be better. That way, when the cake is inverted, the streusel is on the top of the cake, not the bottom. I also baked the recommended amount of time and used a cake tester, but  the cake was so moist, it felt like it was undercooked. The flavor of the blueberries was lost in the texture and sweetness of the cake. If I made this again, I would also increase the amount of blueberries.

Delicious but my cake did crumble a bit.  I had to cut it into slices to serve it, and then thick slices to have it hold up.  It is heavy and sweet so next time I would use less sugar.  I didn't use nuts due to allergies.  Nice recipe and I will make it again.

I have made this a few times and this IS, IMO..the BEST blueberry cake/cobbler/bread recipe on this site and maybe even online for that matter, as I have tried most of the recipes for blueberry baked goods on here. I do think there is too much butter in this recipe, so I recently cut out half of the butter and substituted one of those small snack size portions of blueberry flavored applesauce that I happened to have in my fridge and the cake turned out just as fabulous as it does with the 2 sticks of butter, so from now on I will probably do 1/2 butter, 1/2 applesauce on the butter requirements just to cut a few calories and guilt. My family DEVOURS this cake, it doesn't even last 12 hours in this house.. I made it yesterday at 4pm and the kids must've kept attacking it for late night snack because there was one tiny portion left at 7am. The sour cream and cinnamon/brown sugar swirl really make this recipe stand WAY above the others, one of my favorite finds on all recipes, I'd give it 6 stars if I could.

I have ALWAYS made this in a bundt cake pan and it has always risen just fine, I would avoid glass and stick with metal cake or bundt pans, maybe the reason some people are having problems with it rising is the vessel they are cooking it in, just a thought.

Just made this tonight, had to make a change due to a lack of ingredient. Had to use yogurt instead of sour cream and didn't have enough for 1 cup. So used what I had +/- 1/3 cup and added some half & half +/- 1/4 cup. Then only baked for 50 minutes. Turned out wonderful! Not dense or to heavy.

Simply delicious!  I used huckleberries, and the recipe was perfect as is -- no need to add additional sugar to offset their tartness.  Thank you for sharing this fabulous recipe!

Everyone that tried it said it was delicious and I agree. Although it was a little dense for me, I would've liked it to be lighter and fluffier. I topped the cake with cream cheese frosting and then put a bunch of glazed blueberries into the center (hole) of the cake. Very yummy, I'll definitely make it again.

Heavy like a brick but very moist like a coffee cake should be.  Has a rich flavor so a little piece is enough.  My husband cut into the cake before it was even really cooled without me knowing and said the first bite that I did not cook long enough and I turned around and said  "oh you got into that already" but I explained that it is coffee cake and not the same as regular and the next morning we had some with breakfast and he said it was very good.  Made just like the recipe.

I usually make this with a triple berry blend of blueberries, raspberries and blackberries (from Schwan's). I've made it on several occasions for church or family gatherings and there is rarely a crumb left!

AWESOME! I did as many others have said and cut down the sugar to 1 1/2c and butter down to 1/2c and just added a couple more spoons of sour cream to make up for it. Also added probably 2c blueberries. I didn't do the middle layer so it wasn't too sweet and just did the coffee cake itself. Will definitely make often!! Totally moist and delicious!

Made the for the first time today.  I used two cups of frozen blueberries and a cup of plain yogurt (didn't have sour cream) and chopped walnuts instead of pecans.  I cut the sugar by 1/2 cup.  Superb cake, texture was great and taste heavenly.  Next time I would use less sugar though as it was a little bit too sweet.  Thanks for this incredible recipe!

This cake is delicious. It cooks up so moist and the layers of cinnamon/sugar add interest and flavor.  Didn't change anything.

Wonderful! I made it exactly as the directions state, it is very very good! You really need to beat the butter and auger very well and after adding each egg beat longer than you think you need to. Love it! Thank you!

I made a 1/4 recipe and baked in two ramekins, added extra vanilla as reviewers suggested, and because I used frozen blueberries I just made a blueberry layer instead of mixing them in and turning the batter colors. I also didn't have nuts, so I just made a bit of streusel topping instead. It may seem like I made too many changes to accurately rate the original recipe, but the five stars were for the cake itself. It was light, sweet, extremely moist, and would make a good base for an apple cake or any other fruited coffee cake. Thanks very much!

I rate the original recipe 4 stars.  A great recipe when blueberries are in season.  Although I continue to bake this cake I usually omit the nut mixture and cut back on the sugar.  I also add a wee bit of almond extract for extra flavoring.

These were really good if you have really good blueberries.  I did cut down the white sugar but may need to cut it down waay more.  These are definately a keeper as it turns out pretty.

Fabulous! Everyone at my house loved it. I like the cinnamon/brown sugar flavor with the blueberries.  Plus, it was moist and dense on the inside with a good crust on the outside.

The cake taste good, and is fairly easy to make. Mine just came out way too moist. Maybe it should have baked longer. Half of it fell apart after I took it out of the pan. I would also consider using less better next time.

I suspect it is my fault that half of the cake stayed stuck in the pan when I turned it over, in spite of it being a non-stick Bundt pan and using copious amounts of non-stick spray. Perhaps reading down to the bottom of the recipe where is says to "cool in the pan" for people like me it should read "cool completely in the pan, not 20 minutes, dummy."
The cake is very tasty but even for a sweet-tooth afflicted person like me I think it could have done with less sugar. I used plain yogurt in place of sour cream and since I had some unsalted cashews, I ground them up to use in place of pecans. As another reviewer mentioned, I'd prefer to use 1/2 the struesel in the bottom of the pan and the other 1/2 in the middle. I too, tossed the blueberries with one tablespoon of flour and they didn't sink or turn the batter blue. Worth trying again. Docked it a star for the excessive sweetness, not because it fell apart.

Very moist and tasty.  I did use about 1 3/4 cups large in season blueberries.  I cup is definitely not enough and we really like the blueberry flavor.

This recipe received rave reviews from everyone who tasted it.  I will definitely be making it again.  I used fat free sour cream and almost twice the amount of blueberries the recipe called for.  Absolutely lovely!

Wonderful flavor!  However, next time I would definitely bake it for 60 minutes as opposed to 55 (even though my knife came out "clean"), if not a few minutes longer.

This coffee cake was very good. It was easy to make, and tasted like a seasoned cake with lots of flavor. I followed the recipe as per some reviews. It seems to get better and the texture is great. Love it, Norm

I actually used only 1 stick of butter (1/2cup) by accident and it still came out absolutely delicious. Good news for those of you who may be slightly health conscious!

I followed the directions and mine turned out awesome, no pecans though. I used huckleberries instead of blueberries I think it made it just a little bit better, and I used a regular 9x13 pan instead of a bundt pan.

I love blueberries and I was visiting friends on my vacation and when I got this recipe in an email I printed it out and their son and his fiance made it twice while I was there and it is awesome!  Moist and flavorful and served warm with vanilla ice cream it was a perfect treat!  They followed the recipe exactly and it was quickly devoured both times.  I wouldn't suggest changing a thing and plan on making it myself to bring to work.

This was like a sour cream coffee cake with berries. I used walnuts as I did not have pecans. I had to cook it a little longer.

Very easy to make and it tasted great.  
Didn't have blueberries but had raspberries instead so used them in the recipe. Really enjoyed it and so did my husband. The only problem I had was getting it out of the pan, but I think that was probably my error.

Like many others said, mine did not cook all the way through.  I ended up baking it or 1.5 hours and it was still gooey in the middle.  Tasted pretty good, but you had to eat around the uncooked part.  It was frustrating because I cooked it for a get together at my house and had to run to the store to get something else at the last minute.  =[

I made this cake this morning. I made it exactly as written and followed the directions to a "T" with no alterations. It baked for 60 minutes. It did not cave or fall. The blueberries did not sink to the top, they stayed throughout the cake just fine. I waited until the cake cooled completely (about an hour) before inverting it onto a plate and it came out of the bundt pan beautifully with no sticking or breaking apart. And the taste? Simply amazing!!! I think that, too often, some cooks do not follow the recipe as written, adding their own touches and experience, but then wonder why the recipe did not turn out well for them. Or maybe their oven isn't heating properly and it's time to have it calibrated. Or perhaps they live in high altitude areas and provisions need to be made for this. I don't know...but I do know that this cake, made as written, is a wonderful cake that I will make over and over again. Thank you so much for this recipe d newman!

If there is any problem with this recipe, it's the name. With a texture unlike anything I have tried before, it's not what anyone would think of when they think of "coffee cake." I think it ought to be called a "blueberry buckle cake" because that is exactly what it does...buckles in as it cools. That aside, it tastes amazing! As always, I followed the recipe exactly on my first attempt, and wouldn't change a thing. I have another one in the oven baking now, the first one was so good (both mine were bundt). Three warnings: One, the batter will be very thick and hard to spread in the pan. Two, it gets almost "goppy" when refrigerated (but if you microwave it for a few seconds, it's as good as new). Three, I wouldn't serve this if you are concerned with "presentation." It bakes up pretty in the oven, but looks quite sad once cooled. Those concerns aside, it tastes phenomenal! I even served it to a very picky brother, who found it tasty enough to eat most of it himself! :)

Absolutely To.Die.For!!! The only downside was not due to the recipe or cake itself, but my oven. I put the cake in for 55-minutes and when we checked it the first time not only was it still way too wet, but the batter was only warm at best. Put it back in for another 15-minutes and while the batter was stil wet it was at least hot when we checked it that time. All in all we ended up baking this for 1h 45m and had to cover it with foil the last 20-mins to keep it from getting too brown. Let it cool on the stovetop and it turned out perfectly. My 5 y/o polished off two pieces and the 16 m/o ate every last crumb from his plate! Definitely a keeper in our house!

tried recipe.  After 2 hours of cooking at 350 and a half hour of convection baking at 360 it is somewhat done.  After reading the negative comments one would think someone could explain the general problem???  The taste is wonderful but how does one serve a pile of very rich batter without a big scoop of vanilla ice cream??

I just took this coffee cake out of the oven, first time making it.  It is DELICIOUS and very, very moist.  I did have to bake it in a pie plate however because I don't have a bundt cake pan, so it got a little hard around the edges.  I also replaced the sour cream with Greek style plain yogurt-for some healthiness :-) and used walnuts (what we had on hand) instead of pecans. It is VERY sweet, so for the next one I may cut out some sugar, but I know my kids will love this one.  One piece will do you.  Will make this again, thank you!!

The taste was very good, but the texture was  too dense.  I cut the the sugar to 1 cup, so glad I did .  Increased the blueberries to 2 cups, and used yogurt instead of  sour cream.  I followed a previous suggestion to place the brown sugar/nuts/cinnamon  mixture at the bottom to get a caramely topping.  I don't know if it was this technique that prevented the cake from fully rising or the lack of baking soda.  Every cake recipe that asks for sour cream or yoghurt always had baking soda as well as baking powder.  I will try again going by the exact recipe, only adding baking soda next time.

I followed the directions exactly, but decided to use an angel food cake pan instead, as I never have any luck with a bundt pan.  Personally, I found it to be too sweet, but everyone else loved it.  Instead of topping it with powdered sugar I made a lemon glaze which complimented it nicely.  I did have to bake it about 15 min. longer, but I just kept checking on it and it turned out just fine.

This is the second time I made this. The first time, I could not get it out of the pan. Luckily, it came out in two large pieces, so I could slice it and no one was the wiser. The next time I greased the bunt pan with Crisco shortening and then used wondra flour dusted over it. It worked like a charm. Came out with no problems. Both times I made it, it was absolutely delicious. Thanks for this great recipe.

I loved this recipe.  I made it for my coworkers and it was devoured and raved over.  I used frozen blueberries, thawed, drained, dried out a little on paper towel, and (as suggested by some other reviewers) dusted with a little flour so they didn't "bleed" into the batter. The first time, I made it as written except I omitted the pecans because I don't like nuts in baked products. I baked it in a bundt pan and it baked in 60 minutes.  I made it a second time tonight and this time I didn't put the struessel filling in the middle.  I put it on the bottom in hopes it would unmold and the struessel would serve as a sort of topping.  This didn't work out spectacularly, as most of the topping stuck to the pan.  The cake came out in one piece, though and I am taking the advice of a few others and putting it in the fridge over night. Tomorrow I will drizzle it with a simple vanilla glaze.

Wow, this was really delicious! I made it with no changes to the recipe other than to add more frozen blueberries. It took a little longer to bake.... but worth the wait! It was super moist and still tasted yummy several days later. Will be making this again!

I made this exactly as is. It was wonderful and one of the best things I have made. I was a bit thrown off by  the 5/8th and so I just improvised  off the cuff. I at first thought the batter may be too thick but it was not once the blueberries and the rest of the sugar concoction was put in. I definitely recommend this for a brunch, late night snack or anytime. Thanks for the recipe! I will be making this one again.

I made this this am and oh my goodness, it is wonderful. I did follow exactly except I added more blueberries as mine are fresh from the NW and pretty good size. Mine didn't fall either. Neither my son or I eat many sweets but this will be eaten if not by us then will give left overs to the maintenance crew, they are like Mikey--they eat anything :-). I normally read many of the comments but this time didn't and tried this time to the tee, oh so good.

Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I made the cake this morning, and just ate my first piece.  Yum!  The only change I made was to add the zest of a small lemon to the flour mixture, because I love the flavor of lemon and blueberry together.  I do think the zest helped to balance the sweetness of the cake (and the blueberries I used were rather tart).  I baked the cake in a bundt pan.  I took the cake out after 50 minutes,and let it cool in the pan on a rack for 15 minutes. Then I took a small, soft rubber spatula and gently went  around both the edges of the bundt pan and around the center post to loosen the cake.  The cake came out beautifully when I went to unmold it.  This is a moist delicious cake that makes eating one piece extremely difficult!

Because it didn't bake inside and needed additional time in the oven, the outside was too brown and crispy. I also felt it needed more berries. I'll never make it again.

I made this by the recipe and found it too sweet. The cake part was very good and moist, but the brown sugar/cinnamon/nut mixture was too much. I did make it again with about half (or maybe less) of the brown sugar mixture.

I followed some other recommendations and cut the white sugar in half and added a lot more fresh blueberries than the recipe called for. I also didn't have sour cream so used a substitute of blended cottage cheese and lemon. This was a HUGE hit in my house. I doubled the recipe and one cake is already gone and I only made it this morning. Will definitely make this again.

This is not an UNHEALTHY dessert.  If you were using margarine I would say yes, it's unhealthy.  I only buy organic eggs and dairy and pure cane sugar.  Ain't nothing unhealthy about that.  Great recipe, thanks.

I made this cake exactly according to the recipe.  It came out raw.  I tried cooking it longer, but only had a mess.  I tried serving it just to family in a bowl with a spoon just not to waste it.  The ingredients are great, but I will never attempt this cake again.

Easy to lighten this recipe up. I use 3/4 cup stevia/sugar baking blend, plain greek yogurt in place of sour cream, Smart Balance in place of the butter, and whole wheat flour for 1/2 of the AP flour. Per my usual habit, I add 1/8 cup ground flaxseed meal. Never had a problem with it falling, and my DH and son love it.

first off Im not a baker.  I try, however, it never seems to come out right. That being said, this recipie was no different.  My daughter and I tried this and it just didn't taste right.  My husband and son liked it, so it didn't go to waste. I think they would give it 4 stars, but I give it two.

I made the recipe exactly as it's written.     It made a delicious extremely moist coffee cake.   I was worried that such a heavy cake would stick in the bundt pan, but it didn't.    I have a sweet tooth, but the cake was a little too sweet for me.    The next time I make it, I'll either half the brown sugar/pecan/cinnamon mixture or leave it out entirely.

This recipe has been declared a KEEPER!  My family loved the moistness of this and the flavor overall!  Next time I make this- I will lessen the sugar to 1cup-- 1.5 was STILL way too sweet for us~ otherwise a great recipe and a go-to for my family!

It is a great recipe! However, I decreased the sugar by half, which in my opinion tasted better and became healthier. I also added some nuts and raisins in the cake, giving the cake a more tropical and nutty taste.

Must say that this is DELICIOUS!  Melts in your mouth.  Next time I will try it with splenda sugar and brown sugar and fat free sour cream.  If it's not as good, I will go back to the original recipe.  I know I will be making this often for family gatherings.

I found this recipe yesterday and wanted to try it.  I didn't have any blueberries on hand so I used blackberries, and I realized half way through that I was out of vanilla, so I used lemon extract.  It was hands down the best coffee cake I've ever eaten! It was very moist. I'm sure the recipe as written is just as good if not better.  My husband said it tasted way too good to be considered coffee cake, and my 5-year-old asked why we were eating treats for breakfast.  I will definitely be making this again!

I made this for my mom's visit..it is very beautiful and sweet cake, i do suggest less sugar. Maybe 1/2 to 1 cup less since you are using the brown sugar as well. It came out delicious. I do suggest trying this with coffee with NO additional sugar for coffee needed. I did add blue berries as per my taste.. and they were frozen.. came out perfect. The only thing i would suggest is some type of thin frosting being added to decorate it. because it looks amazing and insider was soft, tender, Mouth watering and the blue berries was amazing!!! Plus ... dont be afraid to swirl in the brown sugar, it gave it an amazing design inside!! My mom was like... HOW DO YOU DO THIS!? LOL... i said.. WITH A LOT OF LOVE!!

Excellent recipe! I made it for a ladies breakfast this morning - and everyone loved it. Only thing I changed was the blueberries to frozen triple berries because that's what I had. Definite keeper!

This was a very easy recipe to make. The cake was very sweet, maybe a little bit too sweet for my taste. I also liked the added Pecans. The only thing for me was that it wasn't the prettiest cake to serve to guests. I just can't understand the swirl as it just looked as though I had thrown all the ingredients together in the mixer.

Pretty simple recipe. Every one really enjoyed this cake. I thought it was good, but nothing spectacular. Only thing was it was so tasty/indulgent, that it tasted like I had bought it haha. Didnt have that "homemade" taste. It was requested that I make this for Labor Day. Thinking of adding dried cranberries to it to make a red, white, and blue cake.

Love, love, love!  This gets great reviews every time I make it.  The only issue I have is with the bake time.  I have always had to bake it longer.  The knife never comes out clean, but I remove it from the oven anyway because I am worried about the outside being too hard.

This is exactly like the old "Sock it to me" cake with the addition of Blueberries. Still a nice comfort food sort of cake though.

i've made this coffeecake many times. it always turns out wonderful! today though, i had a lot on my mind, and FORGOT to add the sour cream.  since i already put it in the bundt pan, i figured, there's no turning back.  i'm crossing my fingers that it's just as good w/out sour cream, as it is with.

Very good!  I had fresh blueberries and sour cream in the frig that needed to be used, but I will make it again.  I underbaked it so it was more like pound cake, and made a lemon glaze.  Delicious!

I just tried making this, and perhaps I'm reading wrong, but there is nowhere near enough wet ingredient. After adding the dry to the butter-sour cream mixture, it literally was hard as a rock. I had to add some milk to even be able to stir it and get it into the pan. Then, after an HOUR of baking at 400 (I upped the temp because of a premonition that this wasn't going to cook at 350), it was like soup. There was about a quarter inch cooked around the outside, but the entire inside was uncooked.

Fabulous recipe.  The only change I made was using sugar instead of flour to dust the pan.  I'm thinking next time a little lemon zest either with the dusting sugar or in the batter.  This would be excellent to take to any function or for guests.  Absolutely delicious!!!!  Wish I could do more stars.

Great recipe - I didn't make any changes.  I brought it to a party/BBQ and everybody loved it.  I used fresh blueberries and it was very moist.  Thanks for the recipe!

Took this to a ladies brunch and everyone had seconds. I did add extra blueberries as well as light sour cream which worked just fine. Loved it!

I made it as directed originally, but do use butter flavored vegetable shortning about every other batch.  I've also turned in into streusel topped muffins rather than a bundt pan.  Outstanding recipe - I get nothing but raves and it's a new brunch/guests for breakfast standby for me.

This was DELICIOUS! A keeper for me. I made it exactly the first time then added some copped cranberries & added more filling (brn. sugar etc.) UPDATE 5/15/10 I have tried to make this after about 3 times & it has been soggy at the bottom each time. I have no idea what I could be doing wrong now. I do use frozen blueberries & maybe the fresh cranberries helped w/that in the first 3. I will try it in a 9x13 now.

This is an excellent recipe.  It is so versatile.  You can sub raspberries or diced peaches for the blueberries if you want.  It also freezes really well...that is if you have any left over to freeze... we never do.

I made two of these today - one for us and one to take to my Bible Study group tomorrow.  Instead of dusting with confectionary sugar I made a glaze using the confectionary sugar and lemon juice. I cut a slice of our coffeecake - it was delicious.  I'll be making this recipe often!

This first time I made this recipe it was awesome, but every time since then it has stuck in my bundt pan or has had a strange texture. It is good but I got so frustrated I am not sure if I will make again.

Made just as the recipe states...no substitutions or anything, and my husband absolutely loved it!  Said it was better than our go-to coffee cake recipe that has been in the family for ages!  That's really saying something!

This was super yummy! I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I thought the texture was a little off, and I didn't get the swirl of brown sugar... it sort of soaked in. The only changes I made were adding more blueberries because I picked huge ones, so I needed to compensate.

This is good, but not amazing. It's moist and has a good texture (almost like a muffin... not really spongy, though) and a nice flavor. There's just no real "wow" factor.

We loved this recipe!  I did add 1 1/2 cups of fresh blueberries because my berries were huge!  It turned out awesome even with Light sour cream & I followed the recipe exactly other than what I mentioned.  Definitely a keeper & I even shared it on FB with my friends :-)

This is the best recipe ever!  I followed the directions exactly and it came out great! Only thing I changed was I added walnuts instead of pecans because that's what I had. I made this for people that I work with and got many compliments. (One person even took some home!)I wouldn't change a thing - great recipe that I will make often!

I was really disappointed in this recipe as it looks so yummy. I followed the directions exactly. After an hour and 45 minutes in the oven it was still not done in the middle. I have had no problems with my oven temperature with other recipes. The outer edges that were done, were much two sweet, it kind of made my teeth ache. I guess I should have decreased the sugar like other reviewers suggested. I don't think I'll trying this recipe again, my fresh picked blueberries are too precious!

I'm thrilled with this recipe, I would give it 10 stars if I could! I only used 1 1/2cp sugar, added additional 1/4cp blueberries, 1 tsp orange extract along with the vanilla. This came together very easily, layered as directed in a dark coated bundt pan sprayed well with Pam Flour Baking Spray. I baked @ 375 x 10min. then 350 x 45 min. It took forever to cool, so by 1:00 a.m. I decided I was no longer interested in putting confectioners sugar on top. It was already pretty the way it was, and I just wanted to eat some, and go to bed! It is amazing when it's warm, and still wonderful and moist the next day. Such a fantastic recipe, I can't wait to make this for my mother.  --Sorry can't tell you about whether it freezes well, Newman. There isn't any left to freeze, maybe next time  :)

Decadent! I used a little less sugar and also ended up using less of the brown sugar-pecan mixture. It was still plenty sweet and next time I'll reduce the sugar a little more. This is a great cake though, and everyone loved it!

Made this for the first time to take to the in-laws for Thanksgiving.  Everyone loved it!  Very moist and flavorful.  The little that was left was even better the next day. Now I make it the day before I plan to serve it. Excellent!

I have made this cake several times now, for different occasions, and not once have I gone without multiple compliments! This is truly an outstanding cake. Moist, flavourful, different, and very "more-ish"! Yes, it is on the fattening side, but if you make it just for special occasions, you can justify it. It really is worth the extra calories. Superb. Glad I found the recipe! :)

I baked this in an 11 inch springform tube pan.  I baked it for 1 1/2 hours @ 350, and was still completely raw.  I'm no beginner, i'm not sure what happened here.

This is wonderful, I added a little more sour cream just to empty the container, and added more nuts... I love nuts! This is so moist and flavorful! I'm going to try different kinds of fruit in the future. Thanks for a great recipe!

This coffee cake is fabulous.  Everyone who tries it asks for the recipe.  The only thing I changed was that I used mixed berries instead of just blue berries.  Yummmmmm!

This was FANtastic!  It was incredibly moist, gooey and flavorful.  I will definitely make this in the future for brunches, etc.  I did have a bit of trouble getting it out of the bundt pan, so I'll let it cool longer next time.  No glaze needed on this!

The hubby & I really liked this coffee cake.  It has a great flavor to it, I made it as is but next time I think I'll add more blueberries or maybe even some raspberries.  I made it in my bundt pan, but it took close to an 1 hour & 15 minutes to bake.  Next time I might try it in a 9x13 pan.  Thanks!

I also baked this in a 9x13 pan and I had to bake it for much longer than the recipe states.  While the flavor was pretty good, the consistency was a little gummy in the middle.

Absolutely excellent as is. I made this in a 9x13 pan (I made 1.5 times the recipe and it was perfect). I've been asked for this recipe several times!

It's a family favorite.  We are blessed to have a blueberry farmer in the family and this is undoubtedly our favorite blueberry recipe.  However, I cannot say it is the healthiest...but oh! we all can splurge once in awhile!

This cake is delicious.  I had so many blueberries that I made two different coffee cakes from this site. This one and the blueberry buckle. This cake WON!  It is so moist and flavorful and has a wonderful crunch from the nuts. My coworkers finished it off within minutes.  It is also a real stunner.  The bunt pan just gives it an elegant look and with powdered sugar sprinkled on top, this cake is ready to be admired and devoured!!

This is an easy cake to make.  The cake turned out light and the streusel topping made it special.  I didn't use blueberry (not easily available here), I used lychee (canned, drained the juice and cubed them) instead.. yummy!  Thanks for the recipe. Will make this again and again. Just great with a cup of coffee or tea!

I used two loaf pans because I was carting these up north for a family weekend.  My family went on and on.

Delicious! I made 2 cakes for work since I knew 1 wasn't enough and they loved it. Very easy but it did take longer to bake than the recipe stated. Maybe my oven's slow.

SO GOOD!  I used fresh blueberries (and coated them with flour) and added 1T of valencia orange peel zest to the batter.  A great way to use fresh blueberries, and because you only need the 1 cup of them, you have plenty to use in other recipes or jams too!  Will definitely be making this again - the entire family is licking their lips!!

Very good but very rich.  I can't eat too much of this anyway bc of the butter--doesn't agree with me.  Mine broke in the pan, but I just cut it up and it was fine.  Bf liked it too, but we are not eating this all by ourselves, so I'll take it to work tomorrow and I'm sure it will be gone by lunchtime.  Only two adjustments I made was to use about 1-2 tbsp less of butter and about 1/2 c of sour cream bc thats all I had.  Probably would be fine with even less butter.

I added only 1 1/2 sticks butter and 1 1/2 cups evaporated cane juice instead of sugar. I baked it in a bundt pan and it was perfect except with the pecan sugar layer in the middle, it wanted to fall out before the whole cake came along so I would recommend to swirl it a bit before baking. It ended up looking good even trhough it had a slight crack in it. I had spread one batch into a 13x9 pan and thought it looked really flat so I did bake it in a bundt pan. Oh, I also put in some freshly grated lemon peel and it was heavenly!!! I put the normal amount of vanilla as well.

I just made this coffee cake this morning and it turned out fabulous!!!  I did not have a bundt pan, so I used an angel food cake pan instead.  The cake still had the nice round shape and presentation.  Very moist and delicious.  My only recommendation is to wait until right before you serve it (like the recipe suggests) to sprinkle with powdered sugar.  I will be making this again.

I brought this to church and it was a big hit.  I made it with blackberries because that is what I had on hand. I was in a hurry when I was making it and didn't swirl in the pecan mixture, just sprinkled it in the middle. This is probably the reason my bundt fell apart while removing it from the pan.  A liberal dusting of powdered sugar made it presentable, but next time I'm going to be sure to swirl it in more.

I've been looking for just this kind of recipe! I've tried so many coffee cake recipes, but this one is my favorite. It was fabulous. The only modification in the recipe was a little less sugar--used 1 2/3 c. sugar. Since I was using a darker coated bundt pan, I decreased the temp and baked it for a little longer. Bundt pans are great if you grease it entirely with vegetable shortening and flour it. Definitely a keeper!

This is sooo good.  It's very sweet and quite delicious.  The brown sugar and pecan layer is a perfect compliment to the moistness of the overall cake.  I will most certainly be making this again.

AMAZINGLY good recipe.  Would give it 6 stars if I could.  I get requests for this every time I bring it.  Can't screw this one up..I've made it so many times and usually add extra brown sugar and pecans...but I've drained the juice from my berries sometimes, other times not at all.  I've mixed everything together in my kitchen-aid mixer, and other times "gently folded" the sour cream or berries in..doesn't matter, it always turns out tasting great.  Be careful if you use a dark bundt pan, because this will brown fast!

This was very good.  Instead of a bundt pan, I baked my cake in a 8" springform pan for about 80 minutes at 325F.  The presentation of it was wonderful with the streusel on top.  I should mention though that this cake is VERY moist when followed exactly and it probably isn't good for more than 2 days (not that it would last that long).  Next time I will add more flour (1/2 cup more?) and less sour cream.

A wonderful, delicious cake.  My wife has made it 3 times within the past month -- for a girl's party (several asked for the recipe) and for us twice.  Each time it seems better! We're at a high elevation, so we need to bake it a bit longer -- 10 minutes or so longer. It's become my favorite cake!!

Love this recipe! I often mix in about 1 1/2 to 2 cups of strawberries instead of blueberries. So yummy!

This recipe was awesome. I read the reviews and took the advice of reducing the sugar, and Iam glad I did. It was plenty sweet enough. I loved it. The only changes I made was I used Almond extract instead of vanilla. This is a real keeper.

This coffee cake stayed moist after several days. It is just how I like my coffee cakes to taste, soft but with the crumbles on top.  I had to use cake pans because I did not have a bundt cake pan available at the moment.  It was a big hit at work!

Delicious!  Received rave reviews from guests.  I used fresh berries (frozen berries may be the cause of extra moistness mentioned in other reviews) and cut the sugar to 1.5 cups.  I also baked for 1/2 hour longer than called for as I find my oven to be slow.  To avoid the cake sticking I greased the pan with margarine followed by flour, no problems at all.  I will definitely make again, maybe this weekend!

I too could have baked the cake for longer.  It was a little gooey, but was eaten up quickly.  I think next time I will add a glaze to the top.

An excellent cake. Ours turned out to be a bit crispy on the outside and very moist on the inside. We cooked ours with a convection oven at the suggested time and temp. Instead of  sprinkling confectioner's sugar on top, we made a glaze out of confectioners sugar and little bit of milk and drizzled that on top of the cake for a decadent finish. We also sprayed the inside of the bundt pan with pam and sprinkled some flour, as the recipe suggests, and that worked out fine - the cake popped out fine after cooling.

--

My mom has made this cake twice more since our initial try. She's slightly changed the recipe such that she cut down the sugar to 1 cup and instead of the 1c of butter put in 1/2 cup canola oil and 1/2 cup butter and the cake has come out just as good.

I made this cake because I have free sour cream as goodie bag. Yeah, i know, it is really once in a life time opportunity =)
Anyway, I feel very attracted to this recipe because of pros and cons. Then I try to make it myself with several modification.
I don't like too sweet treats, so I reduced the white sugar to 60% only! I add 1 more egg (so that it will appear softer rather than dense).
And because I live in a tropical country, I don;t have any fresh blueberry, I use blueberry jam 100 gr. (I don't know how much is it in US conversion). Oh yes, and I don't have any brown sugar here, so I use palm sugar only 40 gram.
I bake for 30 minutes for the inside to baked well, and add 45 minutes with water bath at the bottom rack to continue baking, making sure the cake top is baked well but not burning the bottom.
It turns out verrrryyy smooth.
I like this very much!

I made this almost to the T of the recipe.  The only thing I changed was the fruit.  I had frozen hand picked strawberries in my freezer from last summer.  Everyone raved over this recipe at my bible study - trust me - it's a tough crowd of wonderful cooks.  My only complaint is that maybe it was too moist.  Yummy beyond belief (it should be with all that sugar and butter!!!) but messy.  I will make this again!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for some friends with a "berry medley" because I could not find blueberries and everyone agreed that it was fantastic.  Will definitely make again, next time with blueberries.

I was so excited to bring this to a church function but it turned out so bad I simply couldn’t bring it. I followed the recipe exactly but it didn’t come out of the pan very well and it was under cooked in some parts and over cooked in others. I’m giving it 3 stars simply because my husband still liked it and ate it all!

This was so yummy!  Mine split in half coming out of the bundt pan, but at least I could put the second half cleanly on top (maybe too much middle stuff!) and covered it up with powdered sugar - so it still looked pretty.  thanks so much

I brought this to work for a food day and everyone LOVED this recipe.  It is very tasty and moist.  Make sure you watch the last few minutes of baking, my sugars ended up burning around the edges.  I cut the edges off and sprinkled with powdered sugar - it was still GREAT!

This is my go to coffee cake for guests, especially my dear mom. I've been making this for the last five years time and time and time again. Every single time I even consider making something else, I go back to this recipe. It's incredibly moist, flavorful and just plain lovely. In my opinion, it's far better as a dessert cake rather than a morning cake. It's just very, very rich for the morning. I do decrease the sugar a bit and never dust it with confectioners sugar. Other than those two tiny changes, it's amazing. Lastly, I should say that I am SUPER picky about baked goods. I am nearly always disappointed when I purchase baked goods in bakeries, even at the top bakeries in Chicago. But this cake has no flaws. At all. Make it and get fat. :-)

My mom loves blueberries and she loved this coffee cake! I actually made a bunch of the brown sugar mix and swirled it in the middle and sprinkled it on the top of the cake. We just served it out of the bundt pan. Very good for dessert with vanilla ice cream!

I reduced the sugar by about 1/3 of a cup and used fresh berries.  It turned out perfect.  Moist and yummy!  Plenty sweet.

the cake turned out to be pretty dense. i used a can of drained strawberries instead and this increased the baking time by about 10-15 mins. i also cut down the sugar to 1 and 1/3 cup instead and i found that the cake was still sufficiently sweet. i expected the cake to be more flavoursome, but overall still a pretty good tasting cake to have with some raspberry ripple ice cream on the side

I've made this a few times now and it is absolutely delicious! My whole family loves it. I did have a problem with the cake collapsing when I added the nut mixture. Obviously something I am doing wrong since no one else seems to have this problem. But I ended up just sprinkling some cinnamon sugar for the middle layer and also on top before baking and it turned out even better for our taste (we aren't big on nuts in our house). But again, it is really delicious! Thanks for submitting it.

This is a delicious coffee cake, I'll definitely be making it again.  The swirl of nuts and brown sugar is wonderful.  Quite quick to assemble also.

I took it to church, and every slice was eaten before the end of coffee hour.  That's generally a success!
