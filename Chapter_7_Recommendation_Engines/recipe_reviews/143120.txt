I found this recipe was a little bland so I added blueberries, half a banana, honey and some cinnamon sugar. The only mistake I made with that was I put in a few too many blueberries and the muffins were a little gooey on the inside, other than that, they were pretty good. Add a little butter on them when they are done and voila! Delicious!

I found these muffins to be on the bland side and I even added some cinnamon.  If I make them again, I think I'll add a little honey for extra flavor.

From the reviews I added 1t cinnamon, 1/2 t nutmeg and 1/2t ground cloves. I also added a small container of mandarin oranges, (the kind you put in your lunch) to give a little extra moisture.

Pretty bland. We put apple butter on top and that made it taste better but next time I would definitely add honey, some raisins and walnuts and cinnamon to make it more flavorful.

I followed the recipe and added blue berries and a smart balance/brown sugar/flour crumbled topping and it was excellent!!
