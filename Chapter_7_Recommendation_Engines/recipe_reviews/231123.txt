This was very good.  I pan fried the chicken with the celery and added some mushrooms (based on the cooks note). Made the sauce in the pan that I fried the chicken in. I think that this would have been great out of the pot. I liked the crispy noodles but my guys didn't love them. I'd make this one again but I'd cover for the baking. Just a personal preference.  Nice recipe mikemsd. I only needed to bake it for 30 minutes.

I thought that it was a little bland, but my kids loved it.  I did cover it for part of the time in the oven as I knew that they would not like crunchy noodles.

Good recipe, I used leftover chicken in mine so skipped cooking the chicken. I added celery salt since I didn't cook chicken with celery. And as a PP had said it only needed 35 minutes in the oven. BTW I had an opps moment and forgot to put the bread crumbs in first so sprinkled them on top and covered them with the cheese came out fine. A very forgiving recipe. I will make this again
