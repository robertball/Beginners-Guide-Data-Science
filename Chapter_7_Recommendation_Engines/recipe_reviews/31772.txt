Awesome!  And, I must admit I don't really like chili which is probably why I like this recipe so much.  It's not really a traditional tasting chili - more like chili meets sloppy joe. It's not overly spicy and a little sweet with the addition of the sugar which I wan't sure about at first but after it simmered for a number of hours was fabulous. In addition to the onion I added a green pepper and sauteed them both until tender then added them to the chili. I used 3 (14.5 ounce) cans of beans vs. 4 - 2 kidney and 1 pinto and fire roasted diced tomatoes vs. plain plus 2 tsp. of cumin.  I love the addition of beer and used Sam Adam's lager.  If you don't have any beer on hand (we never seem to have that problem in our house) or you just don't want to part with any you can substitute beef broth. I let this cook low and slow for 6 hours and it got nice and thick.  My husband who is a big fan of chili just loved this and I was thrilled because this recipe made a ton.  I topped it with shredded cheddar cheese and served it with a side of cornbread - very filling.

This is a unique chili that my family absolutely loved.  I decided to make it as written the first time, with the exception of the sugar amount.  We  don't like things too sweet, so I cut the sugar in half.  I thought it wouldn't be spicy enough with only 2 Tablespoons of chili seasoning, but thought I would rectify that situation at the end, if needed.  No need, it was perfect!!  It is not a very spicy chili, with almost a cross between a sloppy joe and chili flavor.  There are a lot of beans, which we loved, but if you are not a big fan, cut back.  This is not a traditional chili but it is one I will make again and again. Not only did hubby rave, but, gasp!, my finicky child did, too.

I'm from Chicago and at first it was kinda of strange adding so many spices and the sugar, But it came out Very Good. I added some macroni noodles just a couple and added some red pepper too, with cheese... The bomb I will cook again..

Being from chicago, I just had to try this recipe. This chili had a great texture, but was way toooo sweet for our tastes. I ended up doctoring it up quite a bit just to counterbalance the sugar in the recipe. I also cut back on the ammount of beans and upped the chili seasoning for a more tangy flavor. Thanks for the recipe however...I'm glad I at least tried it.

Very flavorful and thick.  It was a little too sweet and next time I will leave out the sugar.  I think it's plenty sweet between the chili sauce (which is like zesty ketchup) and the beer... I used Guinness.  I also doubled the seasonings and added a teaspoon of Tabasco.  Makes a ton!  Great for a fall dinner with friends.  I would serve with either cornbread and beer or red wine and french bread.  A tangy salad with vinaigrette would be perfect on the side.

Very good...I didn't have any beer in the fridge, so left it out.  Also, I waited till the last 1/2 hour to add the beans so they didn't have that weird, bloated texture I find occurs when they cook too long.

This is very tasty chili, not chili!  It is a little sweet, but also has a little zing.  I used it on baked potatoes and it was a big hit at our house.

Made this as written.  My wife and son will only eat chili if I make this recipe.  They eat it as is because it's not too spicy and I add heat at the table.

Very good! I have made this twice and with only one change, I skipped the cayenne so my toddler would eat it. I still used the hot sauce and chili powder and found it sweet. My husband (who doesn't like sweet things) added plenty of spices later and was very happy. This one is a keeper, thanks for sharing Sharon!

This chili is amazing!!! It tastes sweet at first, then has a spicy afterburn. I halfed the recipe because I didn't think I would need that 10 servings, but I wish I didnt because I have no leftovers! Everyone LOVED it and couldnt stop eating! Next time I make this chili i'm going to make the full amount. :-)

Being from the Chicago area, of course I chose this recipe over other chili recipes on this site. It is very good...like others said a little on the sweet side. I would cut the sugar in half. Other than that, very good on a fall day while watching bears football. BEAR DOWN!!

I made this chili today, in fact, I've got a bowl in front of me. Wonderful recipe. I think I poured too much beer in. I don't drink, so I bought the smallest available bottle; 24oz Corona and poured some in. Too much, I think. I could taste the beer. Oh well, I'll just have to I.D. my dinner guests!

Overall this recipe was good. I cut back on the beans and added more sauce. Other than that the flavors of all the ingredients were yummy. First dish I made for my in laws and the first time I tried chili. Everyone liked it but recommended that I not mince the meat...I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I WAS THINKING! It's chili not sloppy joes...not a chef…yet! You can luagh I did and still am. :)

Because I was using what I had on hand, I used two cans kidney beans and two cans black beans. I also cut the sugar back by half and used brown sugar. After I browned the meat, onions and garlic in a skillet with a little EVOO, I added all the ingredients to my crockpot and set it to cook on low for the day. Not a bad chili recipe--very simple to make and used what I had on hand which helped because money's tight. I served it with corn muffins.

Very good!  Mine was a bit liquidy, but I'm fully ready to take the blame for that.  I used fresh tomatoes, forgetting that they tend to lose more juice than canned.  So I should have cut back on some of the other liquid, but didn't.  Hence, the fact that it was liquidy is all my fault.  I subbed Pace Picante Sauce for the chili sauce and used beef broth instead of beer.  Not that I object to beer in chili--just didn't have any.  I prepared the meat, onion, and garlic in a skillet and transferred it to a crockpot with the rest of the ingredients and cooked it all on high for about 5 hours.  Perfect! Not too spicy, not too bland.  This was great with a slice of homemade bread.  Thanks for the recipe!

I usually don't review recipes. But I would like to save someone else the trouble from making this awful recipe! I cut the beans back to 2 cans and blended 2 of the cans of tomatoes. The sugar is not necessary at all! My family was very displeased with this recipe.

I rarely write reviews, but felt I needed to with this recipe.  The sugar is not a good idea, it made this recipe too sweet and my family just couldn't eat this. We ended up throwing it all away.  Maybe without the sugar it would have been edible, but I will not try this recipe again so I will never know, sorry!

This had great flavor!  I like my chili REALLY thick, almost like a casserole.  I just added about 3/4 C brown instant rice.  It soaked up the liquid.  For your typical soup like chili, I wouldn't change a thing.

We enjoyed this tangy chili a lot. This had a nice tomatoey tangy taste with just the right amount of heat too. Not spicy by our standards, but didn't need any additional hot sauce or chili powder at the table either. I cut this in half and then only had half the diced tomates called for so I subbed a small can of tomato sauce. It did need the entire 4 hours to simmer and turned out great. Thanks, we like your Chicago chili here in Texas! Shhhhhh...(even with the beans!)

Great recipe.  I use it all the time for parties at the America Legion.  I cut back on the beer and chili sauce and no oregano.  Added tomato juice, bloody mary mix, celery and green peppers.

GREAT recipe! I love beans in chili just not to much, so I cut back on them a little & if you can, try to get a bottle of Ambrosia lager....that stuff makes it!!!

This is a good chili recipe; however, next time I will cut down on the sugar.  It was a little too "sweet"....  But, overall, good recipe!

This one was way too sweet for my tastes.  If you like your chili sweet, this one is for you.

This recipe was a let-down. It wasn't very flavorful in the end even with the garlic. I should have known a chili without cumin wouldn't taste right. I liked the sweetness though. Too bad I didn't make half the recipe as a test because now I've got to eat it all.

I had to send my husband out to buy the tomatoes (which I forgot) and he accidentally bought "seasoned" canned tomatoes.  It didn't seem to make a difference -- this was still delicious.  We all loved it, even my picky 8- and 4-year-olds.  My husband thought it was a bit sweet, but I like it that way!

Good recipe!  I'm going to make it again, but this time add more meat and less beans and tomatoes.  Other than that....great chili recipe!

This was a pretty tasty version of chili. I thought it maybe had too much of a sloppy joe feel (maybe because I use Jeff's Sloppy Joes from this site which also uses chili sauce).  It made too much for my small family, so I froze the leftover which I later added to a more traditional chili recipe and was gobbled down.  Thanks!

I was surprised at how well this turned out.  I did cut the sugar in half as I did not want it too sweet.  I also added pork sausage.  I waited until the last 20 minutes to add the kidney beans as I wanted them a little firmer than they would have been if cooked for the entire 4 hours.

Excellent overall, but WAY TOO MUCH chili powder. I will make this again, but with half the chili powder. It was so hot, OMG! Should have been titled “Sharon’s Ten Alarm Chili”.

This is the best Chili I've ever made! I usually half the recipe because it makes a ton. The full recipe is great for parties or a small Army!! I've made it several times my only suggestion is to OMIT the Sugar.. I've even tried just using half the sugar and its still too sweet... it really doesn't need any sugar. If you have left over chili it's perfect for nacho's! One more thing, sometimes I use black beans in stead of chili beans or a combination of the two. Enjoy!

I cut the sugar back to about 1/4 cup.  Gave it some hint of sweetness but not overwhelming.   Much better!

This recipe was great. I actually added some sweet pepper rings (will add hot pepper rings next time) and everyone raved about the chili.  Has become a part of my winter recipe book!!!

Hands down BEST tasting Chili.  Made a few changes.  Added a green & red bell pepper, 2 diced jalapenos & 1 habenero, a small can of corn.  Cut out the sugar.  Whatever you do..DO NOT omit the chili sauce...made the dish!  Definitely recommend!!!

Cooking instructions did not mention that you must drain the diced tomatoes to make up for the 12 oz of beer added to the chili. Had to add 2 cans of tomatoe paste to the recipe.

Have made this two times and boy o boy love it.  Took some to work and they really enjoyed it as well.  I am from southern Illinois and this beats the traditional chili my hats off to you.

I made this recipe two nights ago and it was absolutely AMAZING!!!! My husband is the cook in the house so when he says its good you can bet it is worth trying. I did only put in half the sugar and half the cayenne (I have small children and was worried it may be too hot) but that was the ONLY adjustments and it was PERFECT!! I will be making this again.
