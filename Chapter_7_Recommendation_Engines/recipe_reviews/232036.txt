This was an excellent creme brûlée. I used a couple of Snickers bars instead of Butterfingers, because that's what I had. I will tell you, my cook time was almost 2 hours to get the toothpick to come out clean, so give your self plenty of time. The creme brûlée was smooth and chocolaty. I will definitely be making this again.
