Because of the comments on not enough liquid and sauce, I placed my roast in the pan, covered it in the sauce prepared from the recipe, then covered the pan tightly with foil and baked as directed. I then added the veggies and covered it again with foil to bake for the second half, and I never ran out of the sauce, and had enough left to make the gravy. I followed every other part of the recipe exactly, and this was DELICIOUS! I am making it again and I am also passing it on to my extended family, it's just so good! Even my two pickiest eaters gobbled it all up!

I didn't really care for this recipe.  It was edible, but not very tasty at all.  When I turned the roast after the first hour, I had to add more sauce because it dried up in the pan.  I'm sure there may be other people out there who would enjoy this recipe.  Unfortunately, I'm not one of them.  As a hint, double the sauce and add the second half when adding the vegetables.

To make it no fuss spike the roast with garlic. add 1/4 cup of red wine to liquid mix. brown roast. Put in slow cooker,that way you dont have to worry about enough liquid the slow cooker takes care of its self.add vegies and potaoes one hour before done. walla

My experience with this was ok. The problems that I encountered were. There was not enough sauce, the veggies were still raw when I was done cooking and the meat was very tough. What I did to improve this was added some water to the sauce, cooked the veggies additonal time on the stove and put the roast back in the oven for 4 hours on 200. Chuck roast does not come out right unless you cook it until it falls apart. After I did that this was very good, my family loved it.

I thought this was excellent, much more flavor than a traditional pot roast.  I followed the recipe   but baked in the crockpot.  Tender, Flavorful, Fantastic!

first of all, i cooked the meat by temperature and not time. i think that is key! instead of chuck roast, i used eye of round roast. instead of traditional ketchup i had used ketchup from costa rica, aka a sweeter  ketchup with less salt. it was WAY yummy, my hubby made noises while he ate and my picky 2 years old daughter actually ate it all up! definetly making this again!

I made this one tonight.  The vote was for mashed potatoes and boiled veggies, so I just had the chuck roast and sauce in the oven.  I ended up with a TON of sauce!  The boys loved it and I am keeping the leftover sauce to marinate some boneless pork ribs later this week.  Thanks for a great recipe.

OH HEAVENS!This is good. Taking advice of other reviewers I added one cup wine and 1/2 cup water extra and used a big roast. (I had to resist garlic,and onions) Glad I did, it is a fabulous taste that EVERYONE raved about.

Wonderful roast recipe. This is far better than the average pot roast. Off the charts good!  The carrots and potatoes were also great and soaked up lots of flavor from the gravy. I made this in the slow cooker. Added the veggies the last two hours of cooking.  I REDUCED the liquids and had far more liquid than I needed when the meat and veggies were done. I also had a little bit of hot Asian chili sauce that was also a sweet sauce so I used that up instead of the sugar and chili powder.  Threw in a beef boullion cube, too. Very tender and delicious. I didn't add the flour to thicken the gravy. The leftover meat makes great sandwiches.  The leftover carrots are delicious cold.

I made a couple changes to the sauce (added some minced garlic, a little bit of red wine, and a few drops of worcester sauce), but still cooked as directed. After the two hours of baking in the oven, the vegies were still quite hard but the roast was done. I stuck everything into my slowcooker for another half hour on high, so that the vegies would soften up. I wish I would have just used the slow cooker to begin with, because the meat was very tough and dry. Sauce was quite good though and made for an excellent rue. I doubt I'll make this again though, it wasn't really a hit with the fam.

This was pretty good pot roast.  Mine definitely needed more cooking time, though, even baking covered.  After the recipe's cooking times, the meat was still tough and the carrots and potatos not cooked through.  I'd say give the meat another hour and another 30 minutes for the veggies, or about 3.5 hours overall.  The flavor was "okay", but I don't know that I'd make this one all that often.

I made this tonight with a good chuck roast; put the carrots in but baked the potatoes.  I kept it covered and had lots of sauce.  My son commented that he really liked the sause; it tasted like a sweet BBQ sauce.  For me, the sauce was good on the meat but too ketchupy for a gravy.  I don't think I would make this again.

What a nice change of pace. Yummy! DH just loved it. Made a smaller roast and divided the other ingredients, too. I used roasted garlic/sea salt blend. Used dried onions, too. Moist and flavorful! With the lid on it, did not dry out...add water if you need to, this is an excellent recipe.

This was an awesome recipe.  I used a much smaller roast (what was on hand) and only used 1/2 the sauce.  The whole family loved it!

Simple to put together for a starter cook like myself.  It will of course taste better with a good quality pot roast.  You may think it's a bit sweet if you aren't a ketchup lover, but we found it tasty.

Very good recipe.  The only problem is that I used a very poor cut of meat.  I loved the gravy and the taste of the meat.  I followed the suggestion of one of the reviewers who covered the pan with tin foil.  I would definitely make this one again and use a better cut of meat!

I don't like catsup so I used a package of taco seasoning with 2 cups of water and 1/3 cup of dark brown sugar - I added about 5 cloves of fresh chopped garlic also! Will def make this again! :-)

My family raved about this recipe.  Just the right blend of spices to compliment the beef.  Excellent!
