My daughter in law and daughter can't have dairy so I was looking for an alternative to the traditional green bean dish.  I made it with chicken broth and added an extra piece of bacon. This was a huge hit! They asked me to make it on Saturday nights when we do fried chicken.

I cut back the brown sugar a little bit, but would cut in half in the future, since it was just a little too sweet for us.  This well could be just a personal taste preference, since we seem to like food less sweet these days.  I bought a bottle of the McCormick Vegetable Seasoning just for this recipe, and I can see using it a lot on steamed veggies which often can use a little flavor boost.  This was a very good side dish to a baked Christmas ham, and I would make again.  Dana P, thanks for sharing your recipe!

Very tasty way to make green beans. I only used a tablespoon of brown sugar, otherwise followed it to T and it was delicious. Bought the vegetable seasoning just for this recipe and it was worth it, will try it on other veggies. Always look ohm for a way to eat more veggies, and I've never really enjoyed green beans until i made them this way! Thanks for the recipe!
