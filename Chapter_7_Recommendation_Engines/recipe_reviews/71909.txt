So I read through all other reviews and made the following changes to the recipe: substitute stawberry yogurt for the oil, up the cinnamon to 1 tsp, add some chopped walnuts (they make a huge difference!), and make sure to cut the strawberries really small, so the muffins don't turn to mush. They turned out really well and I'm enjoying them for breakfasts in the morning. I found they stuck to the muffin cups when they were hot, but once they cooled I had no problem. They also froze pretty well. A keeper for sure!

Very tasty! They were defintely not super sweet (I tend to like muffins sweeter...), but that may also be because my strawberries weren't very sweet. But the flavor was good and they were very easy to make. 

I filled the muffin cups almost to the top and was nervous they would rise too high, so I didn't quite use all of the batter. However, they did not rise much higher than they started, so feel free to fill the cups to the top. Mine baked perfectly in 18 minutes.

Well these were a delightful surprise!  They tasted a bit like baked oatmeal with strawberries.  I haven't made a muffin that used olive oil before but it worked great.  I used brown sugar instead of white and added 1 tsp of vanilla.  I also used 1 tsp of cinnamon.  If you cut the strawberries up small they should cook fine and get rid of the sogginess.  Mine weren't soggy at all.  Very nice, different muffin.

Yum!!  After substituting 1/2 of the flour for whole wheat flour, giving it a heaping 1/2 teas. of cinnamon (as opposed to just 1/2, using vegetable oil and a heaping 1/2 cup Turbinado sugar--all tips in other's reviews. . . THEY ARE GREAT!!  TRUST ME--I MAKE LOTS OF MUFFINS and am an experienced cook!

Awesome recipe. I added a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, used brown sugar instead of white and added some walnuts-made it a little bit sweeter!

I made a few changes but my roommate thought these were the best muffins she ever had! As others suggested, I used whole wheat flour and brown sugar instead and added a handful of walnuts (makes them so much better!). I also substituted the olive oil with vanilla yogurt. The result is definitely very healthy and tasty! Like others, I also couldn't taste a strong strawberry flavour. I think next time I'll try it with strawberry yogurt and add a little bit more sugar. Didn't give this 5 stars due to all the modifications, but otherwise, this was an excellent base recipe!

As is this recipe can be a little on the dry side and, as others have said, very good but not spectacular.  I only made these as listed a couple of times and then I started playing with the recipe to make other kinds of muffins which all turned out spectacular.  This is one of my favorite recipes to modify because it generally comes out well. Both times I have used whole wheat cake flour, and the whole wheat really seems to enhance the flavor, so I would suggest trying whole wheat instead of regular flour, and if you're not a big fan of berries, you could try adding golden raisins and walnuts.
Someone else mentioned a problem with tasting olive oil, but i did not have this problem.  I use the lightest olive oil I can find in the store, or I use high heat safflower oil.

These were good, moist and flavorful, but it kind of overwhelmed the strawberry flavor. If you want a tasty muffin, try this one, but if you want something that really tastes like strawberries, keep looking.

Made a double batch of these using frozen strawberries.  They were absolutely delicious, although I found they didnt take as long in the oven as the recipe says.  Had to rush some into the freezer to stop them all being eaten at once!

Definitely not a sweet, cupcake-y muffin. More like a somewhat healthy breakfast. Like others, I used brown sugar instead of white, half wheat flour/half white, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1/4 cup plain Greek yogurt instead of the oil.  I used 1 cup of finely chopped strawberries. These were good -- the kids liked them, and they freeze well.  We'll eat them for breakfasts and pack them for school lunches.  Thanks for the recipe!

Just ok with the modifications I made for a healthier muffin without all the oil.  I followed some other suggestions: used 1/2 whole wheat/1/2 regular flour, 1/2 brown sugar/1/2 white sugar, subbed light strawberry yogurt for oil, and used more cinnamon.  If I make again, will try adding some vanilla and/or sprinkling with sugar/cinnamon before baking.

This are wonderful! Try adding some more strawberries...also, if you use frozen strawberries you may need to cook for another 2 minutes.  The olive oil is a welcome surprise, used extra light.

Delicious muffins.  To reduce the fat content I replaced the olive oil with pumpkin puree.  I also increased the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon as I am a huge cinnamon lover.  I also cut the sugar to 1/4 cup as the fruit provides plenty of its own natural sugar.  I have made these muffins with strawberries and blueberries.  Next I will try apple!!

These muffins are pretty good but, as other users said, they really lacked that pop of strawberry flavor. I chopped up my strawberries and mixed them with sugar and let them sit while I made the recipe. I used brown sugar instead of white,  substituted 1/4 cup strawberry yogurt for the oil and added in some chopped pecans. Soaking the strawberries with some sugar helped sweeten them but definitely didn't solve the problem.

Very good.  I used a whole pint of berries becasue I thought one-half according to the recipe would be inadequate.  Final muffins tasted very strawberry for me.  I had high quality farmer market berries.  Make sure your berries are the best they can be!

Loved this recipe!  I followed some suggestions and doubled the cinnamon and added vanilla.  I also substituted natural apple sauce for the olive oil and I added chopped walnuts.  They turned out beautifully and I'm already looking forward to making them again!

Made these today for Easter brunch on Sunday.  Not thrilled with the way they turned out.  Not very flavorful.  I substituted 1/2 cup strawberry yogurt for the olive oil, used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 white sugar.  Also used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup wheat flour.  I will still serve these at my brunch but most likely wont make them again.

EEK!  Watch these when in the oven!  The only change I made was to se canola instead of olive oil...I put them in the oven at 425 and set the timer for 15 minutes (since I like to give myself leeway with new recipes).  At 13 minutes, the bottoms were burnt, and the tops were perfect.  *sigh* What a waste of muffins.  That having been said, the texture of the tops was good! Will bake at a lower temp next time.

These muffins are really good. They are moist without being soggy. Right amount of sweetness for a muffin. I did use all whole wheat flour and vegetable oil but did not change anything else.
Will make these again!

These are great! My changes were: 1/2 all-purpose and 1/2 whole wheat flour, I added vanilla and an extra 1/2 tsp of Cinnamon. I added two handfuls of wheat germ as well. Instead of the oil, I used apple sauce, however this one was strawberry and apple sauce. They came out perfect! lots of flavor.

Very yummy!  I added walnuts, a tablespoon or two of wheat germ, and half whole-wheat flour.  We made mini-muffins and they are delicious!

I used this as a base for the random ingredients I had in my house that i wanted to use up. I used honey instead of sugar, added half oats half bran, and some coconut. I also double the cinnamon and added vanilla like others suggested. I made these into mini muffins and baked for 12 minutes at 375.... yum!

These were really excellent.  I did the same as many and made half of the flour whole wheat, substituted 1 T of white flour with 1 T of soy flour (for some good protien), doubled the cinnamon, added 1 t of nutmeg, 2 tsp mexican vanilla, used half again as many strawberries, and used applesauce instead of oil.  These were a great way for me to impress my boss for his birthday!

These came out beautifully, cakey soft with a yummy crunchy top. Absolutely delicious, what a great way to use up leftover strawberries and my 8yr old daughter loved them! I do recommend that these are eaten on the day that they are made, after I stored them overnight, they were a bit soggy. Would definately make again!

This was a very easy recipe and they looked great when they came out.  I even made them in mini muffin tins (baking for 14 minutes).  Unfortunatly I didn't care for the taste.  Sorry to all who loved them.

These were sooo tasty and easy. None were left after the brunch and everyone wanted the recipe. I also filled my cups up and no spill over because they do not rise to much. I also used brown sugar and they were amazing!

I did not like these at all.  I thought the taste of olive oil was overwhelming -- if you're going to make them, use vegetable or canola oil.  And I thought the strawberries were strange.  Would have been better without the strawberries as just cinnamon oatmeal muffins.  Will not make this again.

I loved these muffins!  We bake with no egg or milk due to food allergies and not many recipes take the changes well.  This one certainly did!  They were moist and flavorful.  I did add some vanilla extract with our egg subsitute (arrowroot powder) and a little extra apple juice for moisture.  
This one's a keeper!

It's pretty good. I was a little worried after I had mixed everything together, because the batter looked a bit too thin. However, it turned out just fine. The flavor is on the weak side though, I think I will add some strawberry extractnext time just too see how it will turn out.

I tried substituting brown sugar for white sugar. The muffins were moist inside and got really done on the outside. I would definitely increase cinnamon and even sprinkle some on top. Also, I would do 3/4 cup brown sugar next time.

These are OK muffins, they are not very tasty and are a bit dry.  The only change I made was adding 1 tsp of Vanilla.  My kids liked them but I don't think I will make them again.

GREAT way to use up strawberries that are past their prime for eating raw. I played and through trial and error, eventually came up with a lower-cal version that my son and hubby both loved. I use WW flour in place of AP, upped the cinnamon to a full tsp, subbed in 1/8 cup each of stevia/sugar baking blend and Splenda/brown sugar blend for the sugar, and added 1/8 cup each of ground flax seed and wheat germ to the dry ingredients. I subbed a 6 oz container of low-fat yogurt (strawberry or vanilla) for the milk and 2 very ripe bananas (mashed) subbed for the olive oil. Yielded 24 mini-muffins baked at 375 for 15 min, using a dark pan sprayed with Baker's Joy (no muffin papers). I agree with other reviewers that the strawberries need to be chopped very small - I just quarter mine and put them in my food processor - quick and easy! I also recommend using quick oats - I tried rolled oats in my first attempt, and while they were still tasty and hearty, the quick oats are more suitable for a good muffin texture. I have also successfully used honey in place of sugar - just use 1/3 cup, and reduce yogurt to 4 oz - but my taste preference is with the baking blends.

Yummy Recipe! I added the zest of 1 orange and a bit of ginger to add some flavour oomph, as I love fresh strawberries prepared this way. I also substituted almond meal (almonds ground in the blender) instead of all-purpose flour to go GLUTEN FREE- turned out to be very tasty :)

I made changes - 1 heaping teaspoon of cinnamon, heaping half cup of sugar (as suggested by GIA3), used only whole wheat flower, added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and added a little white vinegar to my milk to let it sour. Because I made so many changes, I can only give 4 stars but these are delicious and I will make again with other berries!

As an avid warehouse club shopper I had a surplus of strawberries left over.  Not wanting to waste a thing I thought this would be a great recipe to try.  The only modification that I made was to use vanilla greek yougurt instead of the oil.  I also had on hand strawberry extract and used 1 tsp. of that.  I would like to add that I am sure the submitter of the recipe meant well, but I for one, would appreciate some kind of measurement on the strawberries.

Decent muffins - made the following substitutions:  1/2c whole wheat flour, 1/2c white flour, 1/4c applesauce instead of oil, omitted the cinnamon, added a little vanilla.  Also made mini muffins, baked for about 12 min at 425. Tastes like Special K strawberry cereal.

These muffins are pretty straight forward and tasty!  Easy to whip up when I've got some fruit I need to use before it goes bad.  Like many of the other reviewers did, I added some Vanilla and next time I think I'll try using apple sauce instead of the olive oil.  I find that I much prefer Raspberries to the Strawberries, but that just personal preferences.  :)

These turned out VERY good!  I used brown sugar instead of white, but otherwise followed the recipe directly.  I refrigerated them after they cooled and they kept well.  A little soggy around the strawberries, but that just makes sense.  My husband ate 3 a day :)

I had a container with some chopped strawberries and peaches in the freezer that I'd saved in order not to lose them. I figured this recipe would work well for what I needed.

I ground the oats in my blender, to make 
the consistancy a little smoother for my kids. I added a tsp. of vanilla extract and used buttermilk. I thought that olive
oil would be a little heavy for muffins(past experiance reminded me of this)
so I used vegetable oil.

Not too difficult to throw together for breakfast and the kids liked them. This 
made twelve muffins, which was enough for breakfast/snacks for the kids and I
and a couple put aside for my husband's 
lunch the next day.

This was basically a good muffin, but not sweet enough for my husband and me, but in all fairness we have a disgraceful sweet tooth. Next time I make them I will add a little more fruit for a more strawberry flavor.

I made these for breakfast the other week for my husband and me. I substituted vegetable oil for the light olive oil. They came out soft and moist, but the taste was a little particular. Maybe you'll like it, maybe you won't. My husband ate one or two, but it definitely was not his favorite-but then again, he doesn't like cinnamon. For me, the first time I thought it was okay. Then by the second or third one, it thought it was pretty good. So I'm giving this a mixed review.

These are very simple and easy to make plus they taste great.  Both my children really liked them.  I used frozen strawberrys and a little bit more sugar and they turned out great. Will make them again. Thanks for sharing

Substituted whole wheat for half of the flour, and also added 1/4 c flaxseed.  Substituted brown sugar, and used maybe 3/4 c, packed loosely.  Increased cinnamon to 3/4 t.  Didn't have enough olive oil, so used 1/8 c olive oil, and 3/8 c sunflower oil.  Skim milk.  These rose up, darn, because I didn't have muffin tins and only muffin liners, and read the reviews which said that they didn't rise much.  Used a food processor to blend all dry ingredients first, then tossed the wet ingredients directly in before blending briefly.  Used exceptionally sweet organic strawberries.  Baked at 400 using a convection bake setting.  Texture was excellent, but of course they were mushy where the strawberries sat.  I thought the muffins were great, but not very sweet, despite the extra sugar.  Couldn't tell there was any oatmeal in them!

These were pretty good, I will make again.  My husband said he really liked them, so that's always a keeper for me.  I followed the recipe exactly, although I'm not sure how many strawberries I used, I just kept adding them until my wet mixture equaled 2 cups.  These muffins didn't rise up at all for me, but they were still good.

Good recipe. I did make some changes suggested by others. I used only whole wheat flour and brown sugar. I doubled the amount of strawberries. I also added two tablespoons of flax seeds. I wil make these muffins again.

Except for cutting back on the sugar, I followed the recipe exactly.  Muffins weren't extraordinary.  Not much strawberry taste.  Muffins kind of crumbly from the oatmeal, I assume.

i did like these muffins a lot, but i made quite a few changes to the recipe.  i used spenda brown sugar, for one.  and, i added 4 times the cinnamon (i am a cinnamon freak)!  i didn't have any fresh strawberries, so i used some frozen ones--tasted great to me, and used an entire pint instead of half.

I used a little less olive oil than the recipe called for, but it came out fine. I loved this recipe, but my family only liked it. My mom said that the texture of having the strawberries in the muffins was odd, not bad just different. The sweetness was fine. Overall, I loved them!

Nice & healthy muffins that aren't too sweet!  I used more strawberries (1 1/2 cups), and it worked out well.  A great way to use up berries :)  Will make again!

I got some very good reviews on these muffins, but in my opinion they weren't fantastic. They were very good, however. The main issue was that they stuck to the muffin wrappers a lot, but that was entirely my fault as I substituted all of the oil for applesauce. I also added vanilla, a bit more fruit than suggested, and I substituted sugar with splenda and eggs with egg beaters. Overall, they came out quite well, just not amazingly.

This recipe is perfect and one of our favourites. The sprinkle of cinnamon and the slight pepper taste of the olive oil make for an amazing muffin. I highly recommend everyone try with the olive oil before swapping it out. I’ve tried several oatmeal strawberry muffins off the internet (most of which called for olive oil) and this one is hands down my fav.

I made this recipe Gluten Free as a breakfast option for my son who has allergies. I modified it by using GF All purpose Flour and GF oats.  I added a little more cinnamon and milk to help with the consistency of the batter. Turned out great!!  Will be making these again!

I believe the oven setting of 425 for 18 minutes is too long.  I baked these muffins at 425 for about 13 minutes and they were about to burn.  Great recipe, but I would bake at 350 next time

I made exactly as called for in the recipe - while i may read the reviews- if you make changes and are then  reviewing then it is NOT the same recipe!!!  AS is - it was very blah - and family members who usually rave over my baking - along with our B&B clients - found this recipe very inconsistent with our standards.  It had very little taste and was not moist or sweet.  Will not be making again using this original version of the recipe.

I will make theses muffins again as i liked the fact that the recipe uses olive oil but in a small amount and the sugar amount is not too high either. I may try substituting the sugar with honey or maple syrup the next time.

I substituted greek yogurt with honey for oil.
added 1 tbspn buttermilk powder to dry mix
used 1 tspn cinnamon

Very tasty - heartier than your usual breakfast muffin and not as sweet.  Will definitely make these again when strawberries are in season.

Great Recipe! I baked it at 20 min at 350 F and it came out underbaked- had to ut it in some more. Added some walnuts for some crunchiness- turned out absolutely delicious. Best cupcake recipe ever!! Really recommend!!

I made them the first time following the recipe to  the letter and they came out perfect.  They are delicious!!  The second time I made it vegan for my daughter and used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup unbleached flour, 1/2 cup almond milk and 1 flaxseed egg.  The  results were the same as the  first time:  DELICIOUS!!

had some strawberries that ineed to use asap &  found this recipe. since i had all the ingredients already on hand i figured i’d try this.  made a few substitutions tho:  unsweetened vanilla almond milk &  splenda for their regular counterpartes. i also added flax seeds & chopped pecans for texture.  the. finally i used cinnamon honey butter to grease the muffin tin. this added more sweetness to the muffin as well as keeping them fron sticking to the tin.  next time i think i will sub either greek yogurt or applesauce for the oil.  def a keeper! can’t wait to have it with my coffee in the morning instead of my normal oatmeal.

I, too, used brown sugar and used blueberries instead as I had a lot on hand and didn't want to waste them.  These muffins were really good, very tasty and moist!  I was leary of an olive oil taste as I could smell it in the batter, but I couldn't taste it after they were baked.  I will definitely make these again but will try it with applesauce as others have done.

I don't like to use oil, so I subbed an extra egg for the 1/4c of olive oil. I also cut the sugar from 1/2c to 1/3c. Came out plenty sweet, but if your strawberries are a bit sour I would stick with the 1/2c of sugar. Great breakfast (or snack!) muffin.

Delicious! Only issue is that I like to enjoy my hot fresh muffins right away & these stuck to the muffin liners. But I scraped out the good stuff anyway!  I read several modification suggestions and made several myself. I used brown sugar instead of white, pumpkin purée instead of oil,  1 teaspoon of cinnamon, added 1/4 cup flax seed meal, and macerated the chopped strawberries in sugar & balsamic vinegar (drained the liquid before I added the strawberries). I topped wth cinnamon sugar. Soooo good!

I did not want to use sugar so I substituted honey.  These muffins aren't very sweet, but I didn't expect them to be.  I cut the strawberries very small but the muffins fell apart anyways.  I would suggest to cut the strawberries amount in half and cut them as small as you can get them.

Made as is, these were not good at all. The strawberries needed to sit in the sugar to help them and like the other reviews said, it needs the yogurt and brown sugar. Very disappointed in these, waste of good strawberries. :(

I made these to the exact directions. I don't see how others can make changes to a recipe and then state they don't like it or they do like it. Ladies, if it's not done to the original recipe, it's NOT the same recipe. Write your own review on what you've done. These were very good and pretty when done. The taste is very good, and the texture is first rate. Since I had a bar of cream cheese that I needed to use, I decided to make a cream cheese frosting to top these.  Without or with frosting, these are winners.

These are pretty tasty.  I think quick-cooking oats would work better than old fashioned though.  Since the recipe didn't specify, I used old fashioned because I usually like them better but they were pretty chewy in this one.

good basic muffin recipe, easy to swap fruits for a different flavor. good way to add fiber into your diet.  add vanilla and increase spices. always remember to sprinkle sugar on the tops of muffins before putting them in oven to bake.

Made theses delicious muffins and my coworkers loved them!  I did use 1 tsp of cinnamon and used brown sugar instead of white sugar.  Also I think a key to this recipe would be cutting up your strawberries really small.  Great recipe and will make again.

I subbed honey for the sugar by warming the milk and stirring the honey into that.  Also subbed coconut oil for olive oil, as mine was not a "light" olive oil.  Good muffins with nice texture; the oats do make them a little chewy though.

Excellent recipe albeit I altered it quite a bit. I require wheat-free baking so I subbed Bob's Red Mill All-Purpose Gluten-Free Flour (next time I would use sorghum flour). I used Grape Seed instead of Olive Oil and Lowfat Buttermilk instead Milk. The most noticeable sub...I had Raspberries not Strawberries. I also increased the Cinnamon a little bit and added a dash of Mace. I added the Raspberries to the liquid mixture and mashed them with a potato masher.  I let the mixture rest a few minutes to give the dry ingredients a chance to absorb the moisture. These muffins are not very sweet which is what I prefer (sorghum flour would sweeten them a tad). They baked beautifully in 18 minutes. I used parchment cups, so I did not have any sticking issues. This is an excellent base recipe!! ...Definitely a keeper...and I'm sure it's delicious with Strawberries...

These were ok, but not one of my favorites.  I followed the recipe except substituted applesauce for the oil to make them a healthier option.  The batter was very runny when everything was mixed together, so I did add 1/4 c of whole wheat flour and a little more cinnamon (based upon other reviews).  The consistency is ok, but a little dry for my taste and at the temp and time suggested, the bottoms of my muffins were almost burnt.  I really don't get a lot of strawberry taste either.

I like to try out new recipes, and learn new tips.  I really enjoy making (eating) muffins.  I don't make the same recipe over and over.  I like to try new things.  I find I learn more.  Out of the many muffins I've tried these are the best by far in my opinion.  I read all the reviews, followed the tips of increasing the cinnamon and adding vanilla extract.  I substituted applesauce for the olive oil and used half dark brown sugar (only because I like that taste) and half powdered sugar (because I'm trying to use it up).  They were delicious  I used my toaster oven, so I reduced the heat by 50 degrees (I think due to the small confined space the heat needs to bake).  I also use silicone muffins cups.  I find those to be easier. A+++

This was a good recipe...not overly sweet. My 4 year old daughter really liked them so we will be adding this to our recipe box and making them often!

Tastes great and easy! I used frozen strawberries and put all the wet ingredients in a food processor with the strawberries. They came out perfect and were great for breakfast or snack on the go.

My picky kiddos love these!I have toddlers, who tend to waste food, so we made these muffins bite size in a mini-muffin tin. The first ones turned out a little burnt on the bottom and not quite done in the middle, so I lowered the temp to 400 degrees and cooked them for 22 minutes. They turned out very well, and are delish!

Yummy! I substituted unsweetened apple sauce for the olive oil and also added flaxseed for extra fiber.

Such a hit!  I made these for a parent breakfast at my son's daycare.  I tweaked it a bit though.  I used cinnamon applesauce instead of oil and replaced the other cinnamon with ginger, I love the health benefits of ginger.

I made these for supper tonight.  My family really liked them.  The only thing I did different was use frozen strawberries as I didn't have any fresh ones. The other thing I did was use instant oats.  I don't know if that made any difference or not but they were delicious! I will make them again.

I followed the recipe as directed except added 1/2 cup of All bran buds to the dry mix to balance the mushy texture of the cooked strawberries. I filled the cups full as there was little rise, it made 11. Good.

I really liked these muffins. They weren't overly sweet or too oily. I did use canola oil because I just couldn't use olive oil due a previous disaster using it in brownies. Other than the oil everything was the same. I did find 17 minutes in the oven was almost too long. Next time I will do 15 or 16 minutes.

Thought this was simple, moist and yummy. I used 1/2 C whole wheat and 1/2 C AP flour, a mixture of blueberries and strawberries, and 1 tsp cinnamon. Great, healthier snack for my one-year-old!

One of those sleepless nights where you feel like making muffins, right? Figure if I do the suggested substitutions, these will be awesome, right?  Well, no. Even with the tweaks (whole wheat flour, brown sugar, more cinnamon, a splash of vanilla) these were meh. Not bad, but just not very exciting.

These were just OK--a little mushy. I followed the recipe as written, subbing brown sugar for white. My husband seemed to like them, but i found them slightly disappointing.

This was delicious, you can really taste the oatmeal in the muffin. Remember not to wash the strawberries before you put them in the batter, or they could get soggy. Great healthy recipe!!

The "guinea pigs" were divided on this one. It's a good, healthy recipe with the oatmeal (I used brown sugar in place of white but goofed by putting 2 teaspoons of baking powder! Which didn't seem to adversely affect the muffins too much) I personally thought they were a little dry and crumbly, but on the plus side, very quick to make. :-) Thanks!

These were very good!  I used brown sugar instead of white.  I had to bake them until they were very brown on the outside for them to be done.  We really enjoyed them and will make them again. I may do blueberries too.  Love having the oatmeal in them!

i found these muffins good but not great.  i doubled the amount of strawberry as some other reviewers said that the strawberry was hard to taste, but i think this may have thrown the texture off (made a little mushier with the extra strawberry).  outside of texture, taste was good.

These were really moist and delicious.  My only problem was despite the many strawberries I put in, there wasn't really a strawberry taste in the muffins.  I thought adding a dallop of strawberry jelly might help but it didn't... they were still delicious though!

These were good, but didn't have enough strawberry flavor.  I will definitely use strawberry extract next time, like another reader suggested.
