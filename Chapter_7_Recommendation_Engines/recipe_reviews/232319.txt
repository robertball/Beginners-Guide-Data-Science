I recommend cutting the salt, pepper, and oregano by half. I also recommend rubbing olive oil on the chicken breasts before rubbing on the spices.

We basically followed the recipe as written and it was very good and I will make it again.  We ended up with a lot of juice in the pan so next time I will drain that off when I add the cheese / prosciutto and make a quick pan sauce for pasta.  I will also add scallions as suggested by others.  You could use diced canned tomatoes too when fresh are tasteless.  I agree with another reviewer that there was too much pepper and oregano.  It makes an impressive yet easy company dinner with only a few small adjustments.

Yum! The creamy brie was delicious with the chicken and mushrooms! I added scallions (as another reviewer suggested) and used a whole package of baby portabella mushrooms and more tomatoes so there would be more of the veggies. I used chicken broth and a little lime juice instead of the water and it turned out great. Served this with a spinach, mango, and avocado salad. Thank you for a great meal!

We loved this recipe and will make it again but with some additions like a few dashes of True Lemon crystals and Italian parsley for the rub portion to brighten it up with a tart flavor, and rough chopped scallions added to the other vegetables. Very easy to make and great with a simply dressed salad.

Sorry I was too busy dishing out to take a picture! Finally a highly rated recipe that deserves it. So, so good. I made this for an Italian themed family dinner family party of 10.
Slight changes I made were to marinate the chicken in the oregano, salt & pepper, (and fresh Basil) overnight. The cooking time was almost bang on and they were tender and flavourful woot!
Also, and I almost did it this time, but next time I would put the veggies in right from the start. The wine in the pan keeps them from sticking and likely burning as well. 
I also added shallots and big chunks of elephant garlic in with the veggies. Thanks so much for this amazing recipe.

Had no white wine so substituted with Limoncello. Also wrapped with bacon instead of prosciutto. My wife said it was the best thing I'd ever cooked. That's what I call a winner.

Did not have any prosciutto so added a strip of low sodium bacon to each breast about 10 minutes after I put the chicken in the oven. Turned out great

This is a pretty good recipe. Lesson the seasonings by 1/2 or 2/3rds.  Didn't add tomatoes,  and used very thin sliced black forest ham. Was really good. Will definitely make again.

Fabulous!  Grilled chicken until seared. Transferred to baking dish.
