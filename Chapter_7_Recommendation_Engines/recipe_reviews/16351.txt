I was looking for a way to use poppy seeds and stumbled across this one. My husband and I love all of the ingredients and had high hopes for this. 

The candy came out well but there was just something off about it. It's sweet with a slight nutty flavor but the poppy seeds killed it for me. (I love poppy seed bagels). They gave it an interesting texture but also a slightly harsh flavor.
