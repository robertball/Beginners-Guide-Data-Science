I cut this recipe down from 4 servings to 1 and realized after it was made that this is a very small serving. After all, 1 serving has only 86 calories in it! I could have had 2 servings easily with no damage done. I usually have green smoothies with yogurt in them, but this one was so refreshing with the orange juice and strawberries. I thoroughly enjoyed it.

I was out of OJ but had an orange, so I peeled it really well and tossed it in. I also did a cup of vanilla yogurt for the milk and real sugar for the sweetner. While it may not be as healthy as the above my children drank it!! They were not too keen on spinach at first but my 6 year old told the others...hey you can't even taste the spinach! Great way to add in healthy foods for young kids!

Been looking for a non-dairy smoothie since I'm lactose intolerant.  Delicious, even my husband likes it.

I had no banana . It was very tasty and liked that it wasn't too thick like some of the smoothies I usually make. Am trying to incorporate more spinach in my diet and will make it again

I substituted regular milk and only added 1/2 cup.  I also put in honey instead of the fake sugar.  Pretty tasty.

The suggested amount of almond milk and OJ give it a runny consistency and the flavor leaves a lot to be desired. Very Disappointed. However I added a cup of frozen strawberries and a half cup of frozen blackberries and a large scoop of vanilla protein powder and then it tasted pretty good but that is an entirely different recipe.

Yes I will make it again especially because I am able to include a vegetable like spinach in my diet
