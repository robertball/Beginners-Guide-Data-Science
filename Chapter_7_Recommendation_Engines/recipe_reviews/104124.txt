I suggest that the following directons are added to the recipe; be sure that the nuts are room temperature or chilled prior to adding to egg white mixture. The walnuts I used were a little warm and the meringue fell flat.  Also, anytime I am working with meringue, I always chill the bowl and beaters in the freezer.

I thought these cookies had a weird styrofoam-like texture and and unpleasant aftertaste. After cooking them for 2 hours, I was really disappointed.

This is a delicious cookie but it does not make very many and ties up the oven for 2 hours for each batch.  I really like the addition of the walnuts to the recipe.
