Followed the recipe exactly. Maybe my sprouts were too small but they were charred, not roasted. Should have taken them out sooner. I didn't think the prosciutto added anything special considering the cost. My husband enjoyed them but it isn't something I would serve to tailgaters or company

Deliciously good!  Don't crisp the prosciutto so much that you can't  poke a toothpick through it without  breaking it.

I'm pretty much the only brussels sprouts eater in my house, and I thought these were tasty! My husband said he liked them as well, and he usually doesn't care for them. I did add a sprinkle of Grana PadanoÂ® on top. Thanks for the recipe Jewel!

What a great pair Brussels Sprouts and prosciutto crudo make. Thank you for the recipe.
