I made these bites for a family dinner this Easter and they were a hit! Nice and moist, and a great consistency, and the orange zest was perfection! 
I didn't give this 5 starts as I found the instructions slightly lacking. It didn't work well at all combining the dates and cashews in the food processor together. The dates all clumped together on the side and the cashews were all at the bottom. 
I poured the two into a big bowl and went to work with my hands and this worked much better to combine the dates and cashews. 
I would definitely make these again.

Easy to make. I used nutmeg instead of cardamom,  1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of orange zest and I mixed in the coconut because it wouldn't stick to the outside.

Very, very tasty, but I had to add about 1 tablespoon of coconut oil to get the balls to hold together.  Also, I had to aggressively press the coconut onto the balls to get it to stick.

These are delicious! The orange and cardamom just jump out and grab you. I dressed  them up for Halloween by making faces with dried fruit and candied orange peel. Great recipe, thank you for sharing it with us.
