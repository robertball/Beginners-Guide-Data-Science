I'm new to this gluten-free cooking stuff, and these were great! Some changes I made right off based on some other recepies I looked at and comments: 1 c white, 1 c brown sugar; 1/2 tsp bkg soda; 1/2 tsp vanilla; 1/2 c coconut; didn't use pecans 'cause didn't have them.  Didn't bake for more than 9 min.

I have spent years baking and developing gluten and wheat free cookies and recipies we have many family members with celiacs. This the. The only changes I made was to add 1/2 tsp more salt and I omited the nuts (only because I diddn't have any on hand) I also chunked up some chocolate but not more than about 1/2 of a cup I like more cookie than chips. I have to admit I was nervous about the soft oily dough, but it cooked up perfectly crispy in the outside and chewey in the middle. I baked them both on my Silpat mats and on parchment paper lined cookie sheets, both turned out great. I let them cool on the cookie sheet a few minnutes before moving them to a cooling rack. These are the most cookie like gluten free cookie I have ever made.

I thought these were GREAT!! The only problem I had with these is I used and ungreased, air-bake cookie sheet... and had to pry them off, I switched to a lightly greased "regular" cookie sheet, and the rest came out beautifully!!

Really good cookies!  I followed some of the other suggestions--1 c. white and 1 c. brown sugar.  I added 1/2 c. (sifted) GF baking mix (Bob's Red Mill), 1/2 t. baking powder, 1/2 t. GF vanilla, 1 c. chocolate chips and 1 c. chopped pecans.  I made them a little bigger (1 T.) and baked them for 15 minutes.  Fabulous!

Much more gooey and deliciously peanut-buttery than most other PB cookie recipes.  If you liked eating spoonfuls of PB from the jar as a kid, you will LOVE this recipe!  Made them for a friend who is on a gluten-free diet and we ALL ended up loving them!
Natural PB is recommended if artificial preservatives are a concern (true in the case of my friend).  I used Hershey's Special Dark chocolate chips which was great to cut through the sweetness of the dough.  These don't really need nuts since the PB-nutty taste is quite prevalent.  I had to cook a little longer than specified, but they firmed up nicely and didn't stick to the cookie sheet (regular dark sheet).

This was a huge hit! Don't forget to grease the cookie sheet, because otherwise they would be impossible to get off! Better yet, use some aluminum foil and peel them off the foil.

I made these for my husband's grandmother and they were very good.  I gave her some dough to freeze and she said that it freezes well.

i don't even know what gluten is, yet i still love these. this uses twice the eggs as many of the other peanut butter cookie recipes, but i've found it is necessary as the other recipes tasted like solidified peanut butter. if you make these with natural peanut butter, splenda, and lots of vanilla you have an low-carb delicious snack! thank you very much!

These cookies are even better than ones made with flour! Truly the best PB cookies I have ever tasted. I add Hershey's Mini-kisses and walnuts. My grandfather, who can't eat wheat, LOVES them, and last time I made a batch, my grandmother and uncle ate them all before he could have any!

Made this today for my granddaughter who is gluten intolerant.  Can't wait to take them to her.  We think it is very good.  I added coconut to the second batch and they were even better and held their shape better with it in.

I made these for my husband (who has DH, a form of gluten allergy). He absolutely loved them! In fact, everyone that eats them loves them! They do not taste like a normal GF bakery item... that being not at all like it should taste. These are great! I did make one change. My recipe is 1/1/1.... so 1 cup PB, 1 cup Sugar and 1 Large egg. I also added some vanilla in there. One thing you will also want to do is let the batter sit for about 10 mins after you mix it and before you put it on the cookie sheet. Otherwise they don't bake very well.

I also did some modifications to this recipe: 
1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar
 1/2 tsp. vanilla
1/2 tsp. baking soda
 1/2 cup shredded coconut
CHUNKY peanut butter
 greased the pan with coconut oil
Baked for about 8-9 minutes, no more than that! They turned out fantastic...chewy, with a little bit of crunch from the chunky peanut butter and slight flavor of coconut (subtle). Try it out!! Next time I might also add chocolate chips for more layers in flavors.

I made these cookies tonight for a party.  I was the only celiac present, but I only had one or two and the batch was gone.  I omitted the nuts and still had enough batter to make about 36 big cookies (could have made 48 smaller cookies for sure).  I baked them on the top rack for 12 minutes and let them cool on the cookie sheet for another ten.  I also cooked them on wax paper and transfered the entire sheet to finish cooling otherwise they would fall apart because they were so gooey.  Once they were cool, they were amazingly chewy and wonderful!

I hate to say it but this was awful.  The consistancy was like poo. Baked it longer than it called for too. Gooey and sticky mess. I can't imagine what I did wrong?

This recipe exceeded my expectations. Most reviews are very positive, but I just didn't have high hopes for 3-ingredient peanut butter cookies. But yummm were they good! My kids loved them too. I made them late at night, left them on the counter to cool and went to bed. They got better and chewier overnight. (Delicious dipped in milk!) I cut up milk chocolate chunks for half the recipe and thought they had a good PB cup taste. The plains ones were good too. I used a small cookie scoop to make 1" balls and got about 80 cookies. Mine looked like normal cookies...didn't flatten out too much like other reviewers said. (I uploaded a pic.) Considering there are only 3 ingredients, there is a lot of room for customization. I plan to add coconut or different types of chocolate like others suggested. Since mine came out thick and chewy, I think next time I'll press a hershey kiss in. Make them for any PB cookie lovers!!!

Moist & delicious! An excellent choice for a fast, easy, gluten free cookie to have on hand whenever you're hankering for a sweet baked good. I've made as is and they were perfect. I've made as some suggested using 1/2 white sugar with 1/2 brown sugar. We enjoyed them both ways. There really is no need for baking soda (they raise slightly just fine on their own). I haven't yet added vanilla, with all that sugar there's really no need but I might. The only playing around I've done so far is using almond butter instead of peanut butter with the latest batch & THAT was a success. All in all a great cookie recipe for gf'ers. PS. I've never experienced a sticking problem but rather than grease the baking sheet I use parchment paper. No sticking!

I tried this recipe and... I unfortunately took the advice of those who added a gluten-free baking mix and baking powder.  It created a grainy chewy cookie.  I have had gluten-free cookies in my local coffee house that are incredible. Crispy through yet moist and smooth.  Unsure how they do it but I will not add the baking mix next time.  I am not happy with this modification and I suggest if you want a delicious cookie that is crispy outside and moist inside yet smooth, do not add the gluten-free baking mix.

I have never made gluten free anything, but I have a friend that can not have gluten. I made these cookies for a scouting event and WOW they were a big hit. I did not put in the nuts but I did add chocolate chips. My friend loved them so much that she took the recipe from me. Thank you!!

I used the most generic peanut butter ever and used parchment paper on the cookie sheet. I followed the recipe exactly.

I just made this recipe (the cookies are in the oven right now) I was excited after reading the other reviews that maybe I'd found a proper gluten-free cookie recipe but the cookies are running all over the pan, not holding their shape. they were very flat.  Is this the recipe everyone else was raving about? It seems to have changed since the last review.

Big Question!!! Is there no flour in this recipe?  I am, also, wondering if zanthan gum is needed; no one has mentioned that.

OK - I got brave and tried this recipe; my husband took the entire batch (minus the ones we ate) to work with him to share with his team - I'll see if there are any left!!!

So I doubted this recipe. Cookies without flour? They came out awesome. They were the best peanut butter cookies I've ever made. I halved the recipe and didn't use the optional ingredients, but I used super chunky peanut butter. These will be Santa's new favorite cookie.

These are delicious! I used super chunky peanut butter and didn't add either of the optional items. They are moist and chewy. I made them for a friend who is allergic to gluten, but I loved them just as much. Definitely a keeper for any peanut butter lover!

Made a 1/4 of the recipe and still got a dozen cookies out of it.  Just used the peanut butter, suguar, and egg.  Great recipe!  Made golf balls and placed them on a cookie sheet.  Baked for 14 minutes and they turned out like a regular cookie....this one is a gluten free keeper!

These Are wonderful! Thank you so much for this recipe. I never would have thought I could make cookies without flour!! I made this as written, perfect. What is nice is you can play with this recipe as you like to adjust to your own tastes. I added a 1/2 tsp vanilla, used raw sugar (about 1 1/2 c. And substituted gluten free oats for the pecans. I baked these on parchment for 10 minutes they were perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle.

AMAZING!  I modified these based on other comments - 2 cups PB, 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar, 4 eggs (EggBeaters), 1/2 tsp baking soda
Best GF cookies I've had, ever.  Even non-celiacs absolutely love these cookies!

I made this recipe with 1/4 brown sugar & 3/4 white sugar & no nuts - otherwise, just as written. One reviewer said these cookies were too cakey & right out of the oven I thought so too & actually thought they were just ok.  However, by the second day, they were gooey & chewy & very yummy!  Great recipe. It's a keeper!

Our local natural foods coop has an almond grinder, so I substituted some fresh ground almond butter for the peanut butter. I also added about 1 tsp each of vanilla extract and cinnamon and the results are divine - no one can resist them. Try swapping the chocolate chips and pecans for white chocolate chunks and dried cranberries or cherries.

We had some friends over for dinner tonight whose daughter has an intolerance for gluten.  I thought it would be fun to make a special dessert that maybe she hadn't had before.  Everyone thought they were pretty good.  I did take the advice of using half white sugar, half brown sugar, 1 tsp baking soda and vanilla.  I left out the pecans and added a bit of coconut.  Baking them on parchment paper worked well.  They were definitely done at 10 minutes.

Woah!  These are dynamite!  Here's a few changes I made, though I'm excited to try the recipe strictly as directed.  I whipped the eggs on high for several minutes and gradually added the sugar creating a meringue-like cookie that added a nice fluff in the end.  Plus I added 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  Overall, what a winner!

I made these & thought they were pretty good for no gluten.  I kept tweeking the ingredients trying to make it taste more like a traditional pb cookie.  With my alterations, I'll be making again for those who can't eat gluten.  How I make them: 2 c p.b., 2 c sugar, 4 eggs, 1/4 c soy flour, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp b.soda, 1 Tbsp vanilla, 1 Tbsp crisco, no chips or nuts.  They're flat as can be, but tasty!

I just made this recipe today and loved it!  I'm trying the gluten-free diet and this was the first bakery item I made.  I only had 1cup natural peanut butter on hand, so I added 1cup natural almond butter.  I used 1cup each of white and brown sugar.  I only had 3 eggs, so I added 1 tablespoon ground flax. I reduced choc chips to 1 cup semi-sweet and also used 1cuo crushed walnuts. So, I suppose this might be an all-together different recipe:) I baked for 10min in 350 and made 3dozen cookies- plenty to share! The hardest part about this recipe is waiting for the cookies to entirely cool before peeling off the wax paper- otherwise it's just a hot gooey, but yummy mess.  It was still too sweet however for my taste buds, so next time I will reduce the 2 sugars to only 1/2 cup each.  Thx for sharing this recipe!

I really should have followed the recipe exactly, I had added some vanilla and baking soda per a review I had read. These came out cakey I wouldn't call them cookies. I am going to try the recipe like I should have and then come back to review. Seriously people if your adding so many different things it turns out to be a whole new recipe!!!!!! MAKE YOUR OWN.

I just made these cookies to give as a Christmas gift to a gluten-free friend. Delicious!  I followed the advice of another reviewer and added coconut, soda, and vanilla. I also used half white sugar and half brown sugar  The cookies look just like a moist chocolate chip cookie made with flour.

These cookies are AMAZING and ridiculously easy to make!  Hands down my favorite cookie recipe and I am not even on a gluten-free diet. I made these for my father in law who has celiac disease but everyone else loved them.. I added 1.5 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon baking soda like others suggested. Soft and chewy and delicious!

I was invited to a gluten-free, vegetarian potluck and these were my offering. They were AMAZING -- and so popular! Plate was empty when I took it home :-)   As so many others, I did adapt the recipe as follows: 1 c. brown sugar and 1 c. white sugar; added 1/2 c. coconut, 1/2 bag choc chips (Ghirardelli), & 1/2 t. baking soda.  I did not find them too sweet at all --  but about 1/2 of the peanut butter I used was all-natural and unsweetened.

These were SO GOOD!  I baked a batch for a Celiac's Group cookie exchange and they were a huge hit.  I did swap half the white sugar for brown sugar.  Otherwise, I stuck to the recipe.  They were crispy on the edges and chewy inside- even ones that I froze to have later were amazing. MUCH better than your usual PB cookie.

These were really surprising. I made them for a friend who can't eat wheat. I suggest making the balls and then laying them on paper towels to soak up some of the oil. They were more cookie like and less oily.

Very good. will make again. Mine did not run on pan, and they werent flat. They were mounds of yumminess. Lined a dark pan w/ parchment paper, easy to take off. With more experimenting, these will most likely be 5 stars. I recommend mixing the eggs first, then adding sugar and let them blend well before adding remaining ingredients.  Also, if you have natural/unsweetened peanut butter, stick with measurement of sugar, even with some chocolate chips, it's not too sweet at all (and I usually scale back the sugar on everything I make). The batter tastes sweeter than the actual cookie.

It was great! These cookies were delicious! Instead of doing 2 cups of white sugar, I did 1 cup white and one cup brown. Also, I added a 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda and one teaspoon of vanilla. The dough was a little greasy, so I added 1/2 a cup of gluten-free oats. It really did the trick. I tried this recipe 2 other times without oatmeal and it turned out lumpy and greasy.I used parchment paper instead of greasing it which helped it not stick. I recommend these tips and extra ingredients and hope you enjoy these cookies as much as I did! ;)

Super easy and came out great. Wasn't hard to mix together. Cooked for the 12min and came out perfect. Cookies will NOT be set out of the oven but the bottom was cooked, after cooling 5min can be moved to a cooling rack and firms up.

This recipe was good only I had to bake these a little longer then required since my first batch came out a little "raw". I also reduced the white sugar to 1 cup and added brown sugar, baking soda and vanilla as suggested in previous comments, I also added chocolate chips but next time might add 1 cup Choc. Chips instead of 2 and do 2 cups coconut flakes.  I doubled this recipe and gave a bunch to my co-workers as a Christmas treat and they say that these are "The best cookies EVER!!!" And named me "Cookie Queen". Defientetly making these next year!

Yum!!! Like others suggested, used 1 c. white sugar and 1 c. brown sugar. Also, a dash of vanilla. Added mini semi-sweet chocolate chips. Omg...chewy awesome goodness!!! Make sure to spray your cookie sheet or you will have a mess on your hands. Mine cooked perfectly at 9 minutes, so watch the oven. Delicious cookie.

Well, I followed this recipe to the "T" with the optional chocolate chips.  My daughter-in-law if gluten free and I was feeling bad that I had nothing to set out for her on our pre-Christmas get together.  I made the HUGE mistake of baking the cookies while she and my adult sons were here.  Brought back lots of memories of when the boys were young as not only did the first warm dozen disappear immediately, but so did the second and part of the third dozen.  Nothing like a warm cookie and these were just the trick for someone that is gluten-free.  I wouldn't change a thing!

My mom has to be gluten-free so was looking for a gluten-free resipe that didn't consist of spending way too much for ingredients. And this was perfect. My family couldn't tell the difference so I was able to take my mom cookies. :0)

This was the first gluten free recipe I'd tried, and I was doubtful even as I spooned them onto the sheet.  I really didn't think they'd set up, but they turned out wonderfully.  I will definitely try them again.  I made them according to the directions without the optional ingredients.

Added 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 cup of coconut (in place of some of the pecans), 1 tsp salt.  Used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar.

I made these a couple of days before Christmas and watched some pretty discerning "big kids" become instantly addicted. I also used 1 C white (raw natural) and 1 C light brown sugar. Fast, delicious, and gone!

Tried these and my hubby and I still thought they were missing something. I read the reviews first and subbed 1/2 of the sugar for brown sugar, added vanilla and baking powder. These were chewy and had a great consistency!

For being gluten free these are pretty good. Mine took a lot longer than 10 mins to get a "little golden", more like 14 mins. I also added vanilla and 1/2 tsp baking soda. Don't let the flat appearance fool you, they are still soft and chewy.

The cookies are AMAZING! I followed the recipe exactly (only without nuts) and they turned out perfect! I made them for my father-in-law, who has Celiacs, but everyone loved them and couldn't even tell they were GF! I love the there are so few ingredients and no strange GF ingredients either. YuMmY!!!

It blows my mind that you can make a cookie without using any kind of flour or butter. Miraculously, this tastes just like a peanut butter cookie. It is way better with chunky peanut butter!

these are AMAZING!  my husband and i decided to go gluten free in 2010, so thought we would try these out since we both have a sweet tooth.  anyway, i was skeptical at first, because the batter seemed a little watery.  i omitted the choc chips and pecans, so was super fast to prepare.    my husband and i cannot stop eating these!  YUM!

For gluten free - you cant beat it! I followed recommendations and used 1c. white sugar, 1c. brown sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, .5 tsp baking soda, no nuts, .5c coconut flakes and 1.5c chocolate chip. Excellent! Thank you! My high school girls (one with special dietary needs) all enjoyed them immensely!

My family isn't big on nuts in cookies, so we first tried without them.  These are MUCH better when made with creamy pb vs. chunky.  We added butterscotch chips, dark chocolate chips , & coconut - were SO good!

This is a great recipe.  I omitted the nuts, and increased the moisture by adding a dab of butter (2 TBS) and decreasing the PB and sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  excellent!!

I just switched to a gluten-free diet and was looking for "goody" recipes that I could eat.  This was so easy and SO good!  I halved the recipe and still got two dozen cookies (teaspoon fulls).  I think they tasted better than my regular peanut butter chocolate chip cookies!

Best gluten free cookies yet. My husband loved them as did friends. No one suspected they were gluten free. I added 1 cup R Hood gluten free flour and 1 teaspoon baking sofa. Also used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. Only added 1 cup of chocolate chips. Turned out well. They puff up large. Made 38 large cookies. Bake 10 minutes. Any longer is too much. Used large cookie sheet but only put 12 on the pan or make them really small to get 15 but reduce baking time. I used the parchment paper and one sheet baked them all. Might be just as good to roll the dough and then flatten with a fork.

Amazing!     We are not gluten free but LOVED these cookies and will make again and again!!!!    Not to be contrary but ignore the naysayers- you must at least give these a try.  How can you go wrong with PB, sugar, and chocolate chips?    These cookies were an amazing discovery:   They are way healthier than butter based cookies, WAY easier than other cookies (so so easy), and absolutely delicious with crispy edges and delectably soft middles.    My kids were begging for me to save some after our grown up meeting for their lunch boxes and my ten year old is talking about making them tomorrow herself after school since they are so easy, and asked permission to make them every day!   Picky husband said they tasted just like soft chocolate chip cookies.   I never would have tried this without my gluten free guest, but I'm obviously glad I did!   THANK YOU!!!!

After reading reviews, I used 16 oz jar of natural crunchy peanut butter, 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup light brown sugar, omitted pecans but used the chocolate chips and added 1/2 t. vanilla and 1/2 t. salt. Sprayed nonstick cookie sheet with butter flavored cooking spray and baked for 14 minutes. Left them on cookie sheet 10 minutes and they came off easily with a pancake turner. They were crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside and they looked very nice and were delicious. This was so easy! I made them for a football game party and everyone commented on how good they were.

These cookies were super easy to make and delicious.  I made a batch because I needed a peanut butter cookie crust for a dessert.  I brought the left over cookies to work and they were gone in a snap (no pun intended).  The cookies are soft and gooey warm and even a few days later they are yummy and the consistency of soft baked cookies.  No one could believe they were gluten free.  I can't wait to try them again with chocolate chips!

These are delicious! Super easy and I always have these ingredients on hand. Every time I have made these, they get gobbled up.

These are good cookies, but they have a very different texture from traditional pb cookies made with flour.  Of course.  They are very chewy.  Good flavor.  The dough is extremely sticky and gooey, even if refrigerated.   I followed the recipe but  I used 1 1/4 cup white and 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of two cups of white.   I used Jif Extra Crunchy (regular pb, not "natural").  For the first twelve cookies, I used my Silpat.  Baked a little longer than 12 minutes.  They stuck to the mat but about 1/2 came off without tearing.  Second batch (now with chilled dough, which seemed to make no difference), I put foil on a normal metal cookie sheet and sprayed it with oil.  These also stuck, but I was able to pull most of them off without tearing them.  Third dozen, I used shortening on the the cookie sheet.  These were still stuck, but I was able to slide a spatula under each cookie and get them off intact.  I made 40 cookies.  My bake time was a little longer than twelve minutes for each sheet.  I prefer the texture of a traditional cookie, but can understand that these would be great treats for someone who is not eating flour.

I'm gluten free and when I get a sweet-tooth, it's the worst!This cookie recipe will be a keeper, thank you for sharing. After reading some reviews, I added a bit of baking soda and vanilla. They didn't spread at all, but made a moist cookie! Coconut flour cookies are like eating sawdust. I also used Splenda to save on some calories. Next time I'll add coconut - I didn't have any on hand today. Oh, and I baked on Silpat and parchment paper and they slid off very easily. It will be hard to keep these away from my husband and daughter who eat regular baked goods till the cows come home - hand's off, these are mine!

Loved these! I did 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar and added a pinch of salt. Whichever reviewer said to leave the dough out for 10 mins was right. I usually refrigerate the dough and it was unnecessary with these. Super good!

Made the recipe as written, except for the additional nuts, using regular old Skippy Peanut Butter. These came out very chewy and tasty - one person commented that most peanut butter cookies are impossibly dry, and these were the best he'd had. If you are expecting a traditional PB cookie/texture, this is not the recipe for you. But if you just want something that tastes good and can be enjoyed by people with an intolerance to gluten, it's a really nice alternative. A few notes: 

*These got REALLY greasy when cooking, which could be a function of the peanut butter we used.
*They don't look done, but ours were done at the end of 12 minutes. 
*I lined the pan with parchment paper, and that worked like a charm (and also soaked up some of the grease mentioned earlier).

Really yummy. I've never made a gluten free cookies before, and these were great. Kids have no idea they're 'different.' Will most likely make again. I added 1/2 t baking power and 1 t vanilla - omitted nuts because I don't have any.

Wow.  These are good!  I think it's important to BEAT the mixture with an electric mixer.  I used my Kitchen-Aid mixer with the cookie dough attachment.  When I put everything in the bowl, I thought it would be too runny.  As it mixed, it stiffened up.  I used All Natural Creamy Peanut Butter, which is very thin and runny as compared to conventional nut butter.  My kids LOVE these!

I've made these twice now and my family absolutely loves these cookies.  They cannot believe there is no flour in them!  I do have to cook them a bit longer to get the centers thoroughly cooked, maybe my cookies are too big.  Still they are delicious cookies (even if you can eat gluten).

These cookies are delicious.  I followed the white sugar/brown sugar recipe.  I used a tablespoon to measure each cookie drop on the cookie sheet.  Much to my surprise I had more than 30 cookies!  It actually yield 5 dozen.  This is a good thing, since I plan on bringing them to my grandchildren and now I have enough to give to each family.  Also, using parchment paper is the way to go.  Less clean up. I also reduced the chocolate chips and the chopped pecan  to 1 cup.  I used mini chips and they seem to work well with the tiny pecan bits.  (and it reduces the overall sugar content.

I seldom rate a recipe, but this recipe was so good that I must give credit where credit is due. These cookies are perfect! I have been in meetings all week with 2 gluten-sensitive people and they have shared their gluten-free cookies and cupcakes with me and I can sum all up in 1 word - YUK! I can't wait to bring these cookies to work tomorrow. I will be a rock star! I did appreciate the reviewers who suggested 1/2 brown & 1/2 white sugar, and gluten-free vanilla extract. I used Teddy Bear Natural Peanut Butter, and 1 1/2 cups of Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate Chips. For half the cookies, I added 1/4 cup of shredded coconut, the others I left as is. Both were equally good. Also, thanks for the tip on using parchment paper and letting them cool a tiny bit before removing from the pan.

These were very good! I only had 1.5 cup of peanut butter, so I used Nutella for the other 1/2 cup, and added a little brown rice flour to thicken up the batter. But they came out wonderful! Thank you!

This is an okay recipe for Gluten-free Peanut Butter. I have one that is similar but uses less eggs. Mine is 1c sugar (white), 1c peanut butter and 1 egg. You can add chocolate kiss or chocolate chips if desired. These are a hit with everyone.

these gluten free cookies were sooo good! They were especially nice when light iced with peanut butter frosting to give it more peanut butter flavor. The frosting recipe I used is Peanut Butter Frosting on this site. I used TRindell's recommendations.

We agreed with one of the reviewers and changed it up as follows: 1/2 cup of GF flour, 1/2 tsp. Baking powder, 1 tsp. Vanilla, 1/2 salt, 1/2 cup toasted walnuts, 1/2 cup dried cranberries, 1 cup brown, 1 cup white sugar. Bake 10 min. Awesome!

My husband loved these! And they are very easy to make also. More so than non gluten free cookies, I think. I didn't add the nuts and used crunchy peanut butter and did as the others suggested and used 1 c of white sugar and 1 c of brown sugar.

I changed the sugar to: 1c white, 1c brown and 1/4 t of baking soda and added some vanilla and coconut and they came out amazing!! I think next time I will reduce the sugar because they were quite sweet already.

These were fabulous! I made them for my son and hubby because they are hard core road bikers and this gives them a lot of protein, carbs, and other great nutrients. I did change it a lil though. I added about a half cup of shredded coconut, 1/4 cup almonds and left out the pecans, I added an extra egg, a little less peanut butter and sugar, and in one batch I put some Hershy's dark chocolate syrup to make them chocolaty :)  They turned out perfect! Thanks!

I made these for a friend who has herself and her family on a gluten free diet.  They loved them!  I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, added 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp baking soda.  They turned out great.  My kids even ate them.  I tried some with chocolate chips, but we all much preferred these without the chocolate chips.

YUMMY!   These were very good for GF baking, I did add 1/2 tsp baking soda as well.    The 1st time I made these, they were a mess on my baking sheet, spread, left a crust on the parchment paper.     The 2nd time I made them(with the baking soda and 50/50 brown/white sugar) they were very good!   A little thin, but in no way did they taste like typical gluten free!   YEAH!!!   Thank you for this recipe!!!

Great recipe.  I also used half brown sugar, half white, but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  I baked them on parchment paper and after I spooned them onto the sheet I smashed them flat with my hand and they turned out great.

These are the best PB cookies I have ever had! My modifications:  I did use half brown sugar/half regular. I greased the cookie sheet with coconut oil- it gave the cookies a nice, light hint of coconut.  I used all natural peanut butter and it turned out great ( it took 1.5 jars).

It was an oily mess in the bowl.  However, it came out pretty good for a gluten free recipe.  I made half a batch with no changes but using half brown sugar and half white sugar.  Tasty.  I tried the suggestion of adding coconut + the two different sugars and it looked a lot better and had a nicer texture than the first .  However, I liked how the first batch had more of a peanut butter taste.

Overall this is a very tasty recipe.  I added a few things that others suggested (vanilla, baking soda, brown sugar). Next time, I will omit the baking soda, in hope of a heavier cookie as these were almost cake-like.  Also, next time I will cut the sugar back by 1/2 cup.  These were VERY sweet.  I used natural peanut butter, so that might explain the variation.  I will definitely make these butter-free cookies again.  My kids and husband loved them.

Wonderful crunchy-chewy cookies. Very filling. Definitely better than anything I could buy in a store.  I made a few modifications to the original recipe. I used a combination of organic PB and sunbutter, both crunchy. I added about 1/3 cup GF biscuit mix. I skimped on the sugar by about a half cup. Likewise I cut the nuts and chocolate chips to half-cups. Mainly I was trying to reduce the sweetness.   I baked them on foil-lined pans until the edges were firm. Then I lifted the foil from the pain and let them half-cool before peeling the foil away, and placing them on racks.   With lumps about the size of a heaping teaspoon, I got about five dozen cookies about 2 to 2 1/2 inches in diameter.

These were awesome for a gluten-free cookie.  My kids loved them.  I used all natural peanut butter.  I read one comment where the user mentioned the cookies "slid all over the baking sheet".  I didn't have that problem at all with the natural peanut butter.  Regular peanut butters might not work as well.  We at half within 2 days and froze some that we just took out recently and let them sit out for a bit and they were wonderful!  I will definitely use this recipe again.

Baked half this batch for a celiac roommate and put the other half in a zip lock to freeze for him to bake whenever he wanted. The cookies were delicious if you are a peanut butter lover, and the dough keeps well in the freezer.

They taste very good but I'm having a hard time calculating the amount that this recipe yields.  I made it with 2 cups of sugar, 2 cups of peanut butter, 4 egss, 2 cups choc. chips and 1 1/2 cups pecans.  I find it hard to believe that it yields only 15 cookies.  I have around 48 made already.  My daughter has celiac and diabetes so I have to calculate her carbs and I can't figure this out!  Help!

I give these cookies 5 stars in the gluten free world of cookies. I think traditional cookies taste better. Having said that, these are the best G/F cookies I have tried to date. I changed them up a little. I used 3/4 of chopped pecans and some peanut butter chips, instead of chocolate chips. The Peanut butter chips gave them an extra peanutty flavor. My cookies came out big and puffy, soft and chewy. I baked them on a stainless steel sheat with a silpat liner and sprayed the silpat with pam. the cookies did not stick at all. Very good I would make them again.

This is great for everyone living wheat free or not. I cook them for about 13 minutes and have also made them substituting 1/2 the sugar with Splenda with success. The small quantity this recipe makes is perfect for you and a friends evening cookies and milk.

I make these now using Heath bar bits and mini chocolate chips. They taste great!  Also a little tip...  bake these on parchment paper on DARK pans.  They turn out perfect and don't spread or fall flat:)

I made these for a friend with Celiac and she LOVED them!!  In fact, my son thought they were the best peanut butter cookies, so now... I'll make these over the original any day!!   
My friend made them with dark chocolate peanut butter and white choc. chips as a variation!  Now she has 2 yummy cookies to choose from!

I made these for my niece who is gluten-intolerant. I made them for a family party that we were having. Everybody liked these cookies better than the regular ones. And, of course, my niece loved them. I will definitely be making them again whether my niece will be there or not.

I much prefer a regular peanut butter chocolate chip cookie recipie that I substitute my gluten-free flour in.  This was too sugary, flat, and crumbly for me...but my children who are on a GF diet also, thought they were OK.

Excellent!  Soft and chewy.  Didn't have enough chocolate chips so added Carmel chips.  Used crunchy peanut butter, no additional nuts.

I just took the first two trays of these cookies out of my oven and they are fabulous!  The gluten free is a new necessity to me and I so miss baking my old favorites but this is truly great tasting.  I did split the sugar as one other reader said 1 cup white and 1 cup light brown for the binding factor and it worked great.  I also added a Tblsp of vanilla just because I love vanilla.  Thank you for sharing this recipe and for the hard work it probably took to get it this yummy!  I baked them on parchment and some on a sillpat and no issues with sticking, falling apart.  To the poster that had issues with them spreading, I put my bowl of dough in the fridge for about 10 minute since I have had issues with "spreaders" before just in case so don't know if that helped or if the recipe just worked for me.

Liked it. Didn't add the nuts or chocolate.  Would add baking soda next time to make them lighter.

I have made these a few times now and my entire family loves them. I put the chocolate chips and pecans in mine! A family favorite now! I didn't change anything in the recipe. I did try an off-brand peanut butter one time and they didn't come out as well. I use parchment paper instead of greasing the cookie sheet.

Eeeeeek! I was so happy with how these turned out. I love reading reveiws and gathering the best tweaks. It seems to annoy other members but this is a community and I L??Ve hearing what worked! 

So in line with that, I used the advice from the most helpful review and used 1c white sugar and 1c brown sugar. Added in the 1/2 tsp of baking soda and same of vanilla. They are so freaking good. Can’t wait to share these goodies with my GF friend for the holidays. 

My thoughts... I did beat the eggs well and combined it with the sugars before stirring in the PB. I had a very good consistency. It does spread more than a typical cookie dough so I adjusted after the first batch to smaller drops on the greased cookie sheet for more normal sized cookies. Cooked for 13 mins. Super yummy.

I had high expectations based on reviews but determined too many changes would be needed IMO to make this a good cookie. Salt and vanilla are definitely needed and the cooking time is way off if you're using an airbake cookie sheet...need 14-15 min using 1T of dough per cookie. I agree with some others that additions such as coconut/cinnamon/GF flour may be a good idea. I won't be making these again, however, I realize everyone has different tastes :)

I followed the suggestions and swapped out 1 cup of white for 1 cup of brown. Forgot to add the 1/2 tsp of bake soda and vanilla. It tasted just like my moms. Next time I will add the soda and vanilla.

We did have some challenges with the peanutbutter ones, but we made them with almond butter and they were amazing. We've made them with sun butter too and they're just as good. This is our go-to cookie recipe!

These are fabulous. This is the best GF cookie recipe that I have found so far. I added 1/4 cup of GF flour and some shredded coconut. I will definitely make these cookies again and again.

Oily mess. I wonder if using natural peanut butter was to blame? I followed suggestions to use 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp baking soda. Added 1 cup chocolate chips and 1/2 cup shredded unsweetened coconut instead of nuts (what I had on hand). Chilled dough a few hours and baked  about 9 minutes. The taste wasn’t bad, but they were dripping in oil, the edges were thin and too crispy/ tough and the middles were chewy and ok. Would not make again.

When I told my family I made gluten free peanut butter cookies, they frowned, however after the first bite they couldn't put the cookies down and they became a hit instantly.  I followed the directions as stated except I didn't add nuts or chocolate chips (I didn't have any on hand) they are delicious and peanut buttery.

These cookies were surprisingly  good. I'm a novice to gluten-free cooking and was suspicious of cookies with absolutely no flour.  I made some alterations as per other reviews:  1 cup white & 1 cup brown sugar, plus I added 1/2 tsp salt. I did include the pecans and made half of the cookies with no chocolate chips & half with the chips.  I liked both and took them to a party where the cookies with the chocolate chips were the more popular. I decided they were more popular because they disappeared first.  I liked the chewy texture too. I cooked most of them 10 minutes which produced a lighter bake, the way my kids like.  One sheet was cooked 12 minutes, a little darker, which I liked best.  Both came out chewy and oh so yummy.

This is a great recipe!  I have made them twice now...first for a friend who has to be gluten-free.  She loved them and was eager to make for her family members who also have celiac disease.  The the second time I made them just because they are easy to make and delicious!  Will definitely be making them again.

Served these to a family of 10 where half of the members have a gluten intolerance. They were in heaven and so were those that aren't gluten intolerant! The mother was wide eyed and took home a copy of the recipe.

I have now made this recipe about 6 times and have finally figured out the trick to make them look pretty! They have always tasted amazing which is why I kept making them (seriously, can't keep them in the house before they're devoured!), but looked a huge mess, spread out all over and bleeding together. Trick is to cream the eggs and sugar first (I did 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar)(this is also where I added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp baking soda). Then beat in the peanut butter and hand mix in the chips. You also must let them rest at least 5 minutes on the tray before scooping them off. Soft and delicious, you won't miss the gluten!

I added the optional nuts and chocolate. I don't know what I did wrong but it was a mess. Too many nuts and chocolate to make into cookies that would maintain a good shape. Grease was flowing off the cookie sheets and starting to flame in the oven. Never again.

I found out a couple of things. If you whip the eggs first and then add the other ingredients you get a texture more like a chocolate chip chewy cookie. Also if you go this route and let the dough set for 15-20 minutes you get a more fluffy, chewy cookie.
If you mix the peanut butter and sugar first you get the more traditional texture of a peanut butter cookie.  
I used coconut sugar instead of regular sugar and coated my baking sheets with butter.  Came out great.

Added flaxmeal to solidify the texture a bit and made homemade peanut butter. First batch came out fluffier than expected. Second batch was made to be thinner and crispier. Yum Also, I made half of the recipes. Over 1 dozen of cookies.

I am really impressed with this! I am no professional baker, and I usually screw things up, but these turned out beautifully! I halved the recipe, though, and used  four tablespoons water, two teaspoons of peanut oil, and 4 teaspoons baking powder instead of two eggs, because I was out. I didn't add nuts, because there were already some in the peanut butter I used. I did add chocolate, but it was unsweetened baking chocolate. Ton make sure it wasn't too bitter, I added 1/4 cup of sugar to the recipe. Like I said, it worked out perfectly and I am extremely happy with this recipe!

Tasted good! My sister was just diagnosed with Celiac's so I am trying gluten-free recipes for get-togethers. I used the modifications recommended--1 c. brown sugar, baking soda. The first batch I made without nuts or chocolate chips. The flavor is good. They were a little underdone in the middle even though cooking them longer would have made the bottoms burn. They were also very flat. But still very good. The second batch I made with Nestle mini chips--totally different cookie. They cooked more evenly and looked better. They puffed up better. Very good and the chocolate cut down on the extreme peanut butter taste. They were more like regular chocolate chip cookies with a hint of peanut butter. Overall great recipe--even if you don't have to be gluten-free.

These are good! I'm not a gluten free person but gave these a try. I added 1/2tsp baking soda, a splash of vanilla, and 1/4cup almond flour. I rolled the dough in balls and pressed them with a fork. They are slightly more chewy than standard peanut butter cookies but none of my gluten-ful family and friends would know the difference.

Yum! My gluten free friends were appreciative. Taste great even though they are straight up sugar! Turn out best w chunky peanut butter and pecans. Did first batch w/o pecans. Just ok. Added coconut. Delicious.

This recipe was very, very salty. Too much salt. The cookies came out either undercooked or overcooked. Don't be fooled by how easy it looks to make it, because it's not worth it. It's a waste of ingredients.

I read the reviews, and went with one cup white sugar, one cup brown sugar, half a tsp baking soda, and half a tsp vanilla. They spread A LOT while cooking. I sprinkled sugar on top of them (they are so greasy that it's impossible to roll them in sugar), and pressed a fork across them to make them look like regular peanut butter cookies, but because they spread so much when cooked, you can't see them. Leave a lot of space on your baking tray, and definitely use cooking paper. They taste okay--I made them for a Christmas party for friends who have jumped on the gluten-free bandwagon, but honestly, I'd prefer regular ones with flour. But if you have to or choose to be GF, these are an acceptable substitute.

With the few adjustments that others have mentioned (substituting 1/2 the white sugar for brown, adding 1/2 tsp. of soda and a touch of vanilla), this recipe was fantastic!

Very rich,yet not too sweet. Very quick!The dough looks VERY goopy- don't worry. They're soft and chewy  but crisp around the edges. I'm used to having to reduce sugar for cookies, but these are a good sweetness as is. Baked in a convection oven at 325 for the full 12 min. The ones larger than 3" look a touch undercooked, but otherwise good. (I'm not familiar with convection ovens, reduced temp by 25 degrees as advised.)

Wow- I didn't think this would work without flour or oats, but it worked great! My kids and I avoid most sugary foods, but the rental cottage I bought had a partially stocked pantry. Hankering for something sweet (but with minimal carbs in the house), I stumbled upon this recipe. I was challenged when I had only about 1/4 cup of peanut butter left in a jar. So here goes: added an equal part cinnamon sugar, 1 egg, some organic raw cacao nibs and organic raisins from Trader Joe's. Surprisingly- 8 perfect cookies! My toddler is the healthiest eater of the bunch- the only one between me and my kids that likes raisins! She hugged me three times when I pulled these out of the oven. Quick, easy and tasty!

I tried this recipe as stated. It was tasty but I wasn't pleased with the texture. I wanted it to be more like a regular PB cookie. I added
1 cup of rice flour and 1 tsp baking powder. Baked for 10 minutes, cooled for 3 minutes. Results were great.

These were good! My husband and I liked them, but our friends LOVED them! I love how the texture is really chewy yet firm despite having no flour. Definitely add 1/2 tsp. baking soda and 1/2 tsp. vanilla, as suggested by other reviewers, and use a regular, greased cookie sheet to make sure these come off easily.

Yum! Not the best I've had, but very good!! I followed the other reviewers by adding 1/2 tsp. baking powder, 1/2 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 tsp. salt, and using 1 C white sugar and 1 C brown sugar. Then I made some each: plain (good and not flat as others complained); with whole grain rolled oats (oats were chewy as expected, but these held an extra high shape and were my favorite); with butter flavored shortening (went flat and burned at bottom); with semi-sweet chocolate chips. I was going to add gluten-free flour to the rest of the batter, but by that time the first batch was out of the oven, and they were great as they were! I made the rest with oats. Only issue was that they had a tendency to burn at the bottom while seeming quite underdone on top (I used a light colored baking sheet and parchment paper), so be sure to check bottoms and place on higher rack.

Sorry I don't have a picture!  These were so, so good!  I made half a recipe to test them out.  Listened to others and added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, 2 eggs, 1 cup of chocolate chips for half of the recipe.  Also listened and after mixing let sit for 10 mins. before placing on cookie sheet.  Baked 1 tablespoon of cookie dough for 10 mins. and heeping tablespoon of cookie dough for 12 mins.  When they begin to get a golden color on top they are ready!

After reading the recipe I was not convinced that these would be cookies, or how I picture cookies. However, I was pleasantly surprised with how they turned out. I only baked one cookie sheet at a time, so I ended up baking them on the third rack down for half the time and then on the top rack for the rest so they were cooked both on the top and the bottom.

Super yummy!!! They're moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside. For each cookie only use 1 or 2 tablespoons of batter and don't spread it beforehand, pile the batter really compact because it spreads a lot. I chose this recipe because I didnt have butter and it tasted better than I thought it would, it was so simple!

I made this recipe but I had a little problem. I am wondering if anyone else had the same problem. My batter was very oily for some reason.Could it have been the type of peanut butter I used? Even when the cookies came out, they had a lot of oil around them. The cookies were fine though. Help! :)

These are hard to mess up! I've tried some different combinations (e.g. brown/white sugar like other reviewers suggested) and they all turned out great. I even baked them with kids who have a tendency not to follow directions very closely, and they were still delicious.

I originally tried the recipe for my cousin who went off gluten, but EVERYONE loves them!

I had a very difficult time getting them off the cookie sheets; the first batch, following the recipe exactly, had to be dumped; the second batch, adding 1/2 cup gluten free flour, had to be scraped off the sheets.  I have stored them in the fridge, but they did taste quite nice.

Nobody in my family has gluten allergies but I am on a committee to provide food for our school's 6th grade graduation.  I found this recipe, baked the cookies, and gave them to my unsuspecting children and their friends...They all tried one and asked for seconds!  Along with a big glass of milk each, they were satisfied with this unexpected treat!  I told my committee members "they passed the kid test!" Today they will be tested at school for Grandparent's day...If they go over well there, on to the Graduation Ceremony!!!

I did not care for this recipe. Soft and so sweet they leave an aftertaste. Glad I made just half the recipe.

These were really good.  I used 1 C. brown sugar in place of 1 C. white sugar and used dark chocolate chips, as another review suggested.  The consistency is that of a drop cookie recipe, not a grain-based recipe.  Who cares!  They were great!

Really good!! I think this is how the bakery down the street makes their pb cookies and I love them!  I do think they were a little too sweet.  Next time I might try 1 1/2 cup sugar.  I also added 2 teaspoons of vanilla and 1 teaspoon of baking soda that I saw in a similar recipie.

Awesome cookies. only modified slightly. I added 1/4 cup of ground flax seed for some added nutrition. Cookie is chewy yet has a nice crunch on the outside. Very very good!!

Made these for the class I work in that has a gluten-free kid.  Loved them!  I had to bake them for 15 to 16 minutes.  But they turned out good.  I used parchment paper.

I had never heard of gluten free until a few years ago when a friend said they could not eat gluten.  I later found this recipe and loved it.  I now make these and take them to work for some people who can't have gluten or are going gluten free.  For being a special cookie, meaning gluten free, these are a 5 but against other cookies still good but have to say 4.

For gluten free this one is pretty good without any alterations.  

However I had an idea last night, tried it out and it was a success.  If you like hazelnut butter try it instead of peanut butter.  I used Kettle Foods Hazelnut Butter in mine.  I did spill half the oil while trying to stir it in, but these still came out with a perfect consistency.  Crispy edges and a chewy center.  I was very skeptical when I saw the dough consistency, but it just works.  I may have to try almond butter next.

Easy & tastes fantastic = my favorite type of recipe. I make these for my aunt and uncle and they are delicious enough that they don't believe me about how simple they are to make. They always ask me to make more for them for Christmas and birthdays, so I guess it's a win-win.

Nothing bad to say about this cookie. This was my 1st time baking a gluten free cookie and 1st time baking a flourless cookie so I cut the recipe in half,which made more than a dozen big cookies.I did experiment a little with the batter, I made  plain, some with vanilla and walnuts and some with chocolate all were delish!

I wanted to bake cookies for a friend for her birthday. She has celiac so of course I wanted something she could enjoy! These cookies we're very easy to make but I was a little nervous when I saw how gooey/doughy they were before baked. However, they turned out great! Very delicious! I would make these again.

The flavor of these cookies was great, and all my co-workers loved them- even those who aren't gluten free.  We have about 4 staff that can't tolerate gluten and they love when the potluck includes dessert for them.  The cookies would have gotten a 5, but they spread so much on the pan, they weren't attractive in presentation at all.  Luckily, taste trumps looks!

These are awesome! Takes 5 minutes to mix them up and they are just as good as any other peanut butter cookie i've made. Soft and chewy! I added chocolate Hershey Kisses to the middle to make a gluten-free peanut blossom cookie. So easy....so good!

These are some of the best cookies I have EVER made!! I made them once during Passover, and ever since I have been HOOKED. If you love gooey cookies, you MUST make this recipe. I like to take them out before they've fully hardened, so it's basically like warm cookie dough. These stick to the pan, so make sure you use parchment paper or  plenty of butter!

My teenagers loved these (which is a amazing) and so did my husband who has issues with gluten.  They look just like regular chocolate chip cookies.  Tips...these are super soft when the come out of the oven, so let them cool on the cookie sheet for 3-5 min. before you remove them.  Let them cool completely before you eat them up.  Added 1 1/2 tsp. of baking soda, 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/4 tsp of salt, 1 cup brown sugar and only 1/2 cup white...because the chocolate chips adds extra sweetness and chunky PB.  These are really good...but a WARNING on the calories and fat....1 cookie is 513 calories and 33g. of fat.  If you eat three of these, then you have eaten all the calories you need for a full day and the fat is off the charts...but they are  really, really good!

I am gluten intolerant and my roommate doesn't really eat carbs, so I tried these cookie and they are great!! I used all natural chunky peanut butter and 1 cup and 1/3 cup brown sugar instead just to cut down some sugar, very good and very sweet still! Next time I will try just one cup of sugar! We loved them! Great texture, excellent flavor!

When I read the recipe, I thought there is something missing!  But then I read the other reviews and figured out the recipe is whole.

I halfed the recipe, added baking soda and salt.  Mu husband and I realy enjoyed them.  I also added some chocolate chips to a few cookies.  I like theme better without the chips.

Excellent with the addition of the pecans and chocolate.  As another reviewer wrote, I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp. of baking soda. I used greased cookie sheets for 9 min of baking time. I also used 1 c. Splenda and 1 c. brown sugar in replacement of white sugar.  The cookies turned out wonderfully!

Must use 1C. sugar & 1C. brown sugar, and ADD 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp vanilla, to make nice and chewy! Best PB cookies ever!!  On new un-greased cookie sheet with ridges these cookies literally fell off the pan.  Love the cookies, Love the new pan.

We made these for a party and they were a hit with everyone! We used dark chocolate chips and baked them on parchment paper with no additional oil. I can't believe how easy and tasty they are! I just had one for breakfast. ;o)

I am allergic to wheat so this recipe was PERFECT! What I did add however is turned them into peanut butter cookie sandwhiches. I took two cookies and made the center out of peanut butter and powedered sugar I mixed together. So So good!

Great cookies!!!!  I only used 3 egg and 1.5 cups of sugar and they turned out wonderful!!  I used my baking stone rather than a greased pan, and no sticking at all.  I placed m&ms in the cookies right after they came out of the oven, rather than add the chips and nuts....a big hit!

These are awesome!  I even cut the sugar - used 1c brown and 1/2 c white which I would only suggest doing if you are using the chocolate chips.  I only had white chocolate chips on hand which worked out beautifully.  Had to bake a bit longer since my cookies were on the larger size.  Yummy, especially for this gluten-free mama!

personally, I would give this a 2.5, they were quite cakey, which depending on your preference, could be a good point, so that's why the 3.  I will keep looking as I prefer my cookies not cakey at all.

I did a twist! Instead of normal peanut butter I used chocolate peanut butter. My grandma and I made these and we all love them but I would suggest milk, whipped cream, or ice cream with it because it is a little bit dry! :)

Amazing! Tastes delicous, but a little rich. Maybe a little less PB?

I think that these are going to be my new go to cookie.  I made them for my small group, 6 adults and 8 kids, they LOVED them. I loved knowing that I didn't have to make something special for me to eat. I did make one change instead of adding chocolate chips I pressed a Kiss into the middle of the cookie after baking.

I did not like the way the final product was.  They fell apart, and it has been difficult for son to eat, as he has 2 loose teeth.  They tasted fine, but I will be looking for a different recipe to try.

These are GREAT!  Just found out I have celiac and wanted a cookie or something.  An added plus my husband and four year old love them too and they don't have to eat them but they do.

This was my first try at gluten free cookies. They seemed a bit too sweet for me. However, my children liked them.

This recipe is great!  I have a friend that is on a wheat/gulten free diet and so as a treat I decided to make them. They came out perfect. I also loved them.  Instead of chocolate chips I use M&M's. They came very colorful  Thankyou.
