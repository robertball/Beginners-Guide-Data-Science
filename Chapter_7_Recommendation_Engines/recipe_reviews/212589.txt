Kind of agreeing with the other reviewer.  This was certainly nothing exciting - just a meal.  I didn't add any seasoning but maybe I should have.  That's a LOT of rice.  Only half got eaten and I ended up with leftovers to try to do something with.  (And I don't think the sauce matched the rice.)  And it wasn't very filling either.  I would add that I'm not "disappointed" because everything coming out of Campbell's isn't always grand.  Sometimes it's really good, and sometimes not.  Without that expectation, there's no disappointment.

This was okay. I had to add seasoning. I was disappointed. I guess maybe I just expected more since it is a Campbells recipe.

This was a good base recipe, I did change it I boiled my chicken in my instant pot to shred. When I cooked all the other ingredients I added Montreal seasoning, added half an onion, and a tablespoon of garlic
 used half the vinegar and added liquid smoke and a tiny bit of cayenne.

nothing to write home about.  Too much vinegar and no taste too it.  I did add spices.  It was still bland.

It was edible. I added some spices, it seemed rather bland.  I should have looked at the reviews before making it!
