The whole family enjoyed this recipe.  I combined everything in a freezer bag and froze it.  When I was ready to grill, I removed it from the freezer the night before to thaw.  I added some of the juice from the marinade to my rice cooker for a flavorful rice dish.

This was great for chicken kabobs.  I used half the amount of olive oil, 1 Tbsp. of dried minced onion, Frank's red hot, and let this marinate 24 hours.

We made this on our new George Foreman grill as it is too cold outside. Made per recipe and it came out great. The lime juice made it. Thanks!

This was a big hit at a recent pot-luck. I doubled the recipe, but my husband thought that the oil didn't need to be doubled since it flared up on the grill. I used organic chicken thighs, and made extra for leftovers.

We really liked the flavor of this chicken.  I think using fresh lime juice is the key.  I'm also thinking next time I make it I just might use fresh tarragon.  The smell of this dish was fantastic!  We will have this again, I'm sure!

Really enjoyed this recipe exactly as is.  Was tempted to add garlic but was glad I didn't. Lime/tarragon combo is a unique delicious flavour. Used freshly squeezed lime juice, don't know if it makes that much difference. Also used skinless boneless thighs.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks Cindy B!

This recipe was good baked too. It had a great taste to it. I wasn't really into tarragon before, but this recipe made me a fan of it.

Great chicken dish!  I used boneless, skinless thighs and will try it with boneless, skinless breasts next time.  I may add a bit of chopped garlic to the marinade but otherwise, I wouldn't change anything.  It was excellent!

This was flavorful, and the chicken was so tender.  Great recipe!  I love the lime flavor in grilled foods.

Great recipe!  I halved the oil and used fresh tarragon.  It did have a strong lime taste, but the whole family ate this with no complaints.  Thank you for sharing.

Great recipe...had to make 2 adjustments but it still came out great.  1) Because of time constraints I only marinated the chicken for an 1 1/4 hours (instead of 4 hours as recipe calls for).  2) For all you who do not have an outdoor grill, I cooked the chicken on the stove on a grill pan first with a touch of olive oil coating it and then moved it to a saute pan with a cover.  I added a small amount of white wine during the process in the saute pan.   But as I mentioned above, the chicken still came out great.  Thank you for whoever submitted it.

This was a pleasant marinade but nothing about it really knocked anyones socks off. I think the lime might be a little too intense for the tarragon, or maybe fresh is needed to really flavor the marinade. We enjoyed trying this recipe, thank you for sharing.

I made the recipe as directed on a 6 pound whole chicken that I cooked spatchcock style.  15 minutes breast down 40 minutes breast up then 10 minutes breast down.  The leg quarters fell off the bird.  I checked with a thermometer to ensure that the internal temp in the thigh and deepest portion of the breast were at 165 degrees.  Will make this again.

I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and I did not use hot sauce as we do not like spicy food. These are the only differences I made to this recipe. It was easy to make and we loved the flavors. I intend to make it again this weekend when I have house guests. I'm sure they will love it too.

Loved it! I'm always looking for a new flavour and something apart from the ordinary and this has a nice fresh tangy flavour! The whole family loved it. We made the recipe just a written and it came out great. We will definitely make it again! Thanks for the recipe!

This was as good, if not better than the numerous 5 star ratings said.  It definitely wasn't too oily, but I don't know that it needed all of the oil in the marinade.  Also, don't rush the grilling process, at no more than medium heat it will be perfectly cooked through after about a half hour with great crispy skin and juicy flavorful meat!  Thank you again for sharing this amazing recipe!

Didn't love it...we did it baked..don't bake it. Would try it again on the grill, but the hot sauce did not come through at all would double all ingredients and add a powdered spice that would help it come together

Had it for dinner and it was delicious and moist.  I used fresh tarragon, half of olive oil, chicken breast, and marinated for at least 6-8 hours.

A very good recipe, easy to make, simple to double and simply flavorful.  We have a Traeger and used it to cook the chicken which added an extra touch to the flavor.

This is one of our favorite grilled chicken recipes. And a must when I want to WOW company. I use boneless skinless thighs and marinate it overnight  and serve it with French potato salad.  Like is said with the French potato salad it gets me to rockstar status  and keeps me there when they dig into the cold leftovers!

I cooked almost as written and it turned out delicious. If you are looking for something with a kick, this isn't it. Even though it calls for hot sauce, it does not specify any type. I used a Tabasco Habenero sauce and even my wife didn't think it was hot. (My wife does not like spicy foods at all). I may up the amount of hot sauce next time to get some more heat.

This is a wonderful marinade. I have been looking for some with less sugar and this fits the bill. I've used it twice with the same great results. I have used it both times for my chicken kabobs as opposed to bone-in thighs. The only hitch is needing 4 hours but it's worth it!

This is a keeper! I followed the recipe as written and marinated for 4 hours. In spite of being charred on the skin side due to a too hot fire, the chicken was moist and flavorful. I couldn't really taste the tarragon though--may try using fresh next time. Will definitely make again!

I substituted the onion with leek and grilled the chicken on a BBQ. The flavours were nice; the lime flavour was prominent. This went well with a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc.

I used chicken tenders, marinated 8 hrs. The were great on the grill, we ate these on a mixed greens salad for a wonderful  dinner. I would make this again and do extra for a quick lunch.

I've made this a couple of times now and it's just OK. Tastes good but not as good as some of my other chicken dishes on the grill. Plus, on my gas grill, it requires a whole lot of attention. With the oil marinade, flare-ups are a real problem.  Like others, I may want to try this in the oven or on the stove top.

This was delicious! I adapted it for the oven, because I'm a busy student and didn't have time to do grilling. I put it in the oven at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 40 minutes and it came out perfect. I also added carrots, potatoes, and broccoli, which I tossed in some of the marinade. I didn't want to cut into a big onion for 2 TBSP worth, so I cut up the white parts of 2 green onions for the marinade and used the green parts for garnishing (I wish I'd also saved some lime for garnishing).  This recipe has a really nice, zesty, interesting flavor profile and is perfect if you want an easy and different chicken dish and you're getting tired of ones with garlic. Thanks for the recipe Ms. Betancourt!

It was good.  I used fresh tarragon and wish I had used a lot more.  I think this would be a great marinade for lamb.

I make this at least once a week as part of my food prep for the week. By far the best marinade I have found. I use the broiler as I have no grill. 15 minutes to juicy flavorful chicken for the whole week. Goes with everything; in salads, wraps or main dish!!

Made almost as written (omitted the hot sauce) and the chicken was very good--moist/tender! I wanted more tarragon or a little less lime; hubs thought it was a perfect meld of flavors. Overall, we enjoyed the flavor of the chicken very much. Glad I tried this recipe, definitely a keeper and will make again!. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I made it as directed and was disappointed. I could barely taste the lime. I used chicken tenders and marinated them for about six hours, so I don't know why the flavor just wasn't there.

I made this exactly as recipe states, except that I reduced the oil by about 1/2 and marinated the chicken about 24 hours.  We cooked it on the grill.  It came out delicious.  What a great blend of flavors, and so moist!  We will definitely make this again (and again).

Made this using boneless thighs and marinated overnight. Was a hit at my dinner party! So easy and tasty. The flavor is nice and clean and perfect for a summer evening. Cooked it in my indoor grill and it was perfect! Will definitely make this again!

Very good recipe and easy to make.  I used boneless chicken breasts and agree with others, I should have stuck with the chicken thighs.  Also agree, I should at least double the hot sauce, it was barely noticeable.  I will definitely make again with these changes.

I didn't like it.  The lime juice was overpowering, I couldn't taste the tarragon, just didn't taste good.  The only thing I did differently was to use boneless, skinless thighs.  Bone-in would probably have been more flavorful, but I doubt that would solve the overpowering lime juice problem.

This is a nice recipe and the chicken was certainly  moist  and tasty.  In my case, however, the flavors I was expecting did not exactly come through.   I had more chicken thighs than the recipe called for so I needed to adjust measurements.  One effect was the heat really did not come through. This part was tricky so perhaps need to recalculate.  I also did not have tarragon so I did my best to substitute other suitable herbs.  The substitutions may not have been up to the task.  I am eager to try this again at some point.  

I will say that this recipe is a great suggestion for cooking chicken thighs.  They take the heat of the grill well, and they are hard to dry out.  Do not use chicken breasts as it is not the same. When grilling place the thighs skin side down over direct heat for 3-5 minutes.  You want a nice char of the skin.  After that turn chicken over and move to indirect heat for 30-35 minutes.  Cover the grill with vents partially open and leave the chicken alone so the heat can do its work.  When cooking over indirect heat it is helpful to have a drip pan of some sort to catch any juices.

I really like this recipe.   Small suggestions, use coarse salt  and pepper and use generously to the chicken directly, double the hot sauce or don't bother.  If you don't marinate in a ziplock,  do that,   way more effective than just using a dish.     I love the salt and lime and Tarragon together.   It's a great  flavor combo.   I do really suggest the coarse salt for both flavor and texture.

I use bottled lime juice, dried minced onions and Cholula Hot Sauce - Chipotle flavor. It's delicious!! This will be my 3rd time making this tonight, I'm using boneless skinless breasts this time instead of the thighs - but I'm sure it will still be fantastic.

Absolutely great, everybody loved it, served it with a green salad.
Works great with lamb steaks as well.
Next time I'm going  to add some cajun spice and a bit more heat, also going to try adding a little brown sugar or honey for a little sweetness.

I'll definitely make this again. Next time I think I'll pierce the chicken a bit to let the flavor get inside the meat.

I made this for my husband and grown children. They all loved it. I only substituted half the lime for lemon juice.

We skinned the chicken thighs before grilling. Made it twice so far. Quickly becoming a new favorite.

This is a keeper. 

If I make it again, I will use much more hot sauce.

Too bland as written. I changed the tarragon to fresh and used 1 ounce, then added 1 teaspoon of anise seed to enhance the taste of licorice; instead of hot sauce I added 6 drops of Tijuana Flats "Smack my  and call me Sally", then added 1 tablespoon of agave nectar. Plus, I decreased the amount of oil. Tasted the marinade and it crossed the entire palate; let you know how it grills.

We used a whole cut-up chicken and ended up marinating the pieces for two days (hey, life happens).  Meat came out very tender, but flavor was more mild than expected, tasting most in the skin.  Used fresh minced onion and garlic instead of powders (compensating for difference in intensity).
