this recipe is pretty good, although i did make some changes. i doubled the rice and water equivelent. in a different pan, i cooked the meat, then added the spices (1T old bay seasoning, 1/2 tsp chili powder), beans and onion and let that simmer for a few minutes. then i added the rice (which should be just-under cooked) to the pan along with 1/2C chicken broth and the tomatoes and let the whole dish simmer together for about 20 minutes. it turned out amazing!

Like the other reviewer, not saucy enough and the Cajun seasoning is too much. The heat is right but is too salty. My husband is suggesting only 1 tbsp of the Cajun seasoning and 1 tbsp of chili powder to keep the heat but lessen the salt. I also wanted some veggies in it so will also try adding a diced green pepper.

Using minute rice is fine for this recipe, but the cajun is a bit much.  I give it 4 stars because it's a good base recipe, but would need more of a broth and less seasoning to make it smoother.  But good nonetheless!

Very easy recipe and even the kids loved it. Used the Creole Seasoning recipe from this site.

Used Tony Cacheres in place of "Cajun seasoning" and it was WAY too spicy for the kids.  I like the idea of cutting in 1/2 and adding chili powder - will try that next time.  Not true red beans and rice but a great weeknight dinner for a working mom!

This was a little disappointing since I had expected better. I made it exactly as written, using Penzeys "Very Hot" Cajun seasoning. The results were just kind of boring - it's kind of like it didn't all come together. It is quick and cheap and well-rounded, ingredient-wise, and it made 4 big platefuls for me. But it was just kind of boring, and not the exciting, spicy dish I was hoping for.

I found this recipe looking for something to make with ingredients I already had so I didn't have to go to the store. I used ground turkey in place of beef. I added freeze dried garlic and some garlic salt along with Cajun seasoning. I also mixed in a bag of steamed veggies to add a little something extra to it. (A corn, asparagus and carrot mix) My picky eater loved it and asked me to make it more often!!

Next time I would sprinkle half the spice on the onion and beef while. browning. Sprinkle of cheese on top is great.

It's pretty good but not really cajun... The cajun seasoning is very salty. So like most people said cutting it is a good idea. Old Bay Blackened seasoning adds a bit more "cajun" style taste to this dish. This is what I changed in it keeping it still pretty quick and easy.
1 TBS Cajun Seasoning
1 TBS Blackened Seasoning
1 TSP Garlic Powder
If you have some extra time say 2+hrs I would recommend making a nice roux to cook this in for a more real "cajun" taste.
