I have to say, I was skeptical of this very simple recipe and wondered if it would "have enough flavor."  No need to worry, it was very good.  We had gotten kohlrabi in our CSA basket this week and I was wondering what to do with it.  This dish was wonderful.  I did this recipe as a part of the Western Region's Faceless Frenzy July 2012.

A simple and delicious one from Hungarian kitchens! I let the kohlrabi stand for about five minutes after grating and sprinkling with plenty of salt. And be sure to use butter for sauteeing the kohlrabi, as it makes it extra delicious.

Yummy!! I wasn't even looking for a kholrabi recipe, only one for using egg noodles and this popped up. I just happened to have kholrabi from my CSA share also and was thrilled to have a way to use it up. Wasn't expecting this to be as good as it is but it is GREAT! Really good flavor. My year and a half year old is sitting here gobbling it up. Next test? My 5 and 7 year old boys. Thanks for a great recipe!

I really enjoyed this dish! My grandfather grows Kohlrabi and gives them to my family, and we never really knew what to do with them until now! Next time I'm going to try to throw in some cut up brats or sausage and see how that works.

Excellent, got my very skeptical S.O. who'd never heard of Kohlrabi to sing its praises. I added some left-over cooked pork I add and a chopped red pepper to add some variety and protein, viola! A full meal.  I'm sure chicken would go well with this too.  This is a great base to begin a lot of creative exploration!

This was surprisingly tasty!!  I had a couple of small kohlrabi and adjusted the amount of noodles accordingly.  Also took the advice of one rater and salted the grated kohlrabi and let it sit while boiling the noodles.  Used green onion tops and flat leaf parsley for garnish, went generous with the pepper.  Hubby liked it too!! Reminded us of a German recipe of noodles and cabbage; the German one uses caraway seeds too, so might use those the next time.

This is a good use for kohlrabi. I added feta cheese and chopped onion too.

I added lots of pepper to the mix, and it was fantastic. Takes me back to my childhood because my grandma used to make this every summer when she had tons, and I mean TONS, of kohlrabi. Thanks for the easy, delicious recipe.

Mmmmmm! Added mushrooms to the kohlrabi in the pan, and was generous with butter, salt and pepper.  Chopped up some of the greens from the tops of the bulbs, and tossed that in too.  My 6 yr old ate it up, and didn't even noticed the shredded veggie in there! Win win!

This was super easy and tasty!  I had purple kohlrabi from my CSA basket and was clueless as to how to use it (I didn't even know what it was at first!)  I added some more butter for flavor and also sprinkled it with a generous helping of freshly shredded parmesan.  Adding some parsley on top gave it a nice pop of color, also.  My husband took the leftovers for lunch which he almost never does, so I'm pleased!
