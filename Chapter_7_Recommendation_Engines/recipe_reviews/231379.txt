I've been meaning to make this recipe for months, but couldn't find the frozen peppers and I didn't want to substitute and tinker too much with the recipe. I finally stumbled across Birds Eye Tri-Color Pepper & Onion Blend and thought that would be perfect. I figured because of the simple ingredients in this recipe, the onions would only benefit the flavor. First off, I love that this is healthy and easy! Second, I also love that there's none of that sweet meatloaf glaze that way too many meatloaf recipes seem to have. Eww. Third, I HIGHLY recommend seasoning the raw meat with salt and pepper. I made it as written, and ended up having to add salt because it was kind of bland without.  I bet garlic powder would also be a nice addition if you want to keep things easy. Overall, a very tasty recipe, and one that I'll keep saved for days I'm looking for something simple. Thanks Mary!

Very tasty! I added 1 egg, salt, garlic and pepper. For the veggies I used Trader Joe's fire roasted peppers and onion. It was super moist and very easy to make.

My husband really liked this.  I thought it was pretty good, so I will make it again.  I like that it only has a few ingredients.  I didn't have frozen peppers and onions, so I chopped some onion and pepper and sauted them before mixing them in.

Used frozen pepper/onion combo (frozen stir-fry mix is same thing).  Be sure frozen veggies are drained (used paper towel to assure they were dry).  Actually found 85 % lean turkey was better.  On third try added 2 tbsp. of catsup and 2 tbsp. tomato paste to blender when blending veggies and it was even better.  Neighbors loved and are getting recipe.

This was delicious and easy to make.  I did make a few small adjustments to the recipe.  Instead of using frozen peppers I used one container of Trader Joe's Mirepoix and added one chopped fresh yellow pepper that I stir fried until the carrots were soft.  Also substituted the cooking spray and used butter for the baking dish.  Turned out delicious with the fresh ingredients and everyone loved it!   Will definitely make it again!

4 stars for ease, especially if you're making a loaf and not meatballs. I did add an egg and diced fresh pepper. Great for a no-fuss, super quick dinner. (I would call this Easy-Peasy Turkey Meatloaf instead of Crazy Delicious though.)

I thought the meatloaf was pretty good. I added onions. I didn't think it was very flavorful, though. I will probably add garlic and more seasoning next time.

Turkey is hit or miss for me. We are reducing the amount of red meat we eat, and replacing ground beef with ground turkey doesn’t always work - but this turned out great. I chopped up a yellow pepper and onion (in place of frozen veggies) and added an egg. I also put catsup on top  for the last 10 minutes. Will make this again!

It was very good but I would have liked to mention it could use a gravy or sauce like traditional meatloaf.

It was good. Easy to make. I added sautéed onions and garlic and an egg.  Couldn’t find the variety of frozen peppers so I used frozen, roasted red peppers. Also covered the top with some tomato sauce and brown sugar mixed together. Put it on the last 30 minutes.   Good texture and taste!  A keeper.

Amazing recipe. I made meatballs and baked in a cupcake tin for 25 minutes at 400 which was plenty of time.

I definitely recommend adding an egg with 2-3 cloves garlic and extra spices, as others have suggested. Also no need to drain the pureed vegges completely as they add a nice moisture to what I'm sure can become a very dry recipe.

Was looking for a quick & easy ground turkey meatloaf recipe that could be used in cold sandwiches next day.  This worked great.  Maybe add a little more seasoning, pepper & an egg.  Hubby & I enjoyed as is though.  Will make the mini loaves & meatballs another time.  Thanks!

I have made it twice so far and I am going to make it again this week.  Followed the recipe exactly the first time.  Second time I added a small chopped onion and 1 Td. Each of parsley, thyme and rosemary.  Both times I had to fight to have leftovers.  We are a family of Two!!!

I love this recipe! The only thing that I changed is that after 40 minutes in the oven , I added 1/2 cup red sauce to the top and then baked another 15 minutes. I will be making this many times again!!

I used canned peas and added onion and garlic powder, salt and pepper. My family, who does not usually like ground turkey recipes so much, really liked it.

The taste was pretty good but the texture was a bit weak.  It was not very firm and tended to fall apart.

Very easy and very good!  My turkey/beef blend meatloaf had become rather ho-hum, so I stopped making it.  Then I stumbled onto this recipe.  I had a half package of frozen bell peppers needing to be used up and the reviews were good so I thought why not.  I did add an egg and salt, pepper, garlic powder and a pinch of herbs de provence (because I love it).  I also topped the loaf with a ketchup/mustard/brown sugar glaze we love and this is my new signature meatloaf recipe. I don't even mix half and half with ground beef for flavor anymore--no need, this is delicious!  I think the peppers are the key...and to think, as a kid I hated the bell pepper and onions my mom put in her meatloaf--my dinner would get cold while I fished them all out so I could eat it!
