Everyone enjoyed this. It was nice having a different twist on a classic. Served with egg noodles. Salad and bread.

3.7.20 I used a can of beef consommé instead of beef broth which I think made the sauce even richer, and I would use that again.  I used baby bella (cremini) mushrooms, and garnished with some chopped parsley for a pop of color. And  I cooked the meatballs on a rack over a foil-lined baking sheet just to make clean-up easier.  This turned out very, very well!  The only thing that I’ll do differently in the future is add a bit of minced garlic to the meatballs and cut the Worcestershire back to 2 tablespoons, but that’s personal taste preference.  I’ll also double the meatballs, cook them, put in a zip lock bag, and into the freezer.  Then all I’ll have to do is make the sauce, add the meatballs, cook the noodles, and this will be a quick-and-easy weeknight meal.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, it’s comfort food at its finest!

I used frozen meatballs to make it even easier, and a can of cream of mushroom soup.  The whole family absolutely loved it!
