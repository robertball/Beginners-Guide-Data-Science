Loved this recipe. I used chicken thighs instead of legs. Also added a little more organic honey. Poured the "glaze" on and put chicken back in the oven for about 15 more minutes to let it bake in. Turned out delish!!

Made this exactly as recipe was written. It is easy and delicious, that will have you craving more in the middle of the night.
Double the recipe so you have some in your fridge for that midnight snack!
Made white rice with it, the sauce on the rice is  ridiculously good!

I left the skin on and grilled the chicken legs. My son loved the sauce and said it had a bite and was sweet but wasn't too spicy. He wants it on wings the next time I get wings. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.

Only change is added another tablespoon of honey, soy made it a bit salty for my taste.  Family loved it and suggested wings next time.  Definitely a keeper.

That sauce...wow! Only thing I would do different is make a double batch of the sauce so I could marinate the chicken overnight with some of it so you get some of that flavor throughout the meat. Even my son who normally doesn't care for chicken liked it!

Great recipe. The only things my bf and I did differently is not use salt since soy sauce is already pretty salty, and very more honey and sriracha.

Made this exactly as recipe and it was awesome!  Great rub for chicken, which I use every time now.  You can use this rub and then bake/pressure cook with bbq sauce and it's great!  I have modified for a pressure cooker.  Apply the rub to chicken and cook it on my cast iron grill about 3 minutes each side.  Then add honey, butter, sriracha sauce and soy sauce to pressure cooker and heat it up.  Add water if necessary to make up for 1/2 cup liquid required for my pressure cooker.  Stir in chicken and pressure cook on high for 20 minutes.  I have used less honey and more sriracha as we like it spicy.

I made this for my significant other and my son who love hot and spicy food. I marinated the chicken legs in the olive oil and spices for an hour before baking. I made the sauce and tossed the chicken in it half way through cook time and let it bake in the rest of the time. It was amazing. Everyone loved it and asked when I would make it again. Next time I will make a double batch. Delicious!!!

Followed this recipe to a tee. I cooked the chicken in a cast iron frying pan and it caramelized the skin super well. The sauce really kicks this chicken into gear. I paired it with Asparagus wrapped in Prosciutto and a green Salad. Next time I’ll make some rice to go with it.

This is sure to be a new family favorite. I made this tonight and followed the directions except that I didn't have any thyme so I used a little oregano and poultry seasoning instead. Fantastic!

Made as written and this turned out pretty good. I think the only change I would have liked was more Sriracha to balance out the honey. I used only the oven but next time I think I will toss them on the grill for a bit after the sauce has been added. Good recipe!

Thank you for such a wonderful recipe! I made it exactly as written and it was amazing! My picky eater ate it without the glaze and even had seconds. The honey Sriracha was everyone else’s favorite. No leftovers and requests to make again! Perfect recipe as written!

I made it mostly following the recipe but I used only 1 TB. of Sriracha but next time I'll definitely use two! Also I baked it for 30 minutes, then tossed it in the sauce before returning it to the oven for 20 minutes more. Delicious!

I followed recipe closely, but  with additional sriracha to suit familial tastes, and was very pleased, along with spouse, with the outcome. The only major changes I would suggest (and will employ tomorrow for brunch) would be to brush on the seasoning sauce on the chicken before baking and sriracha sauce, after. I found dousing legs in these sauces difficult and unsatisfactory. Leftover legs eaten cold were also very tasty.

I had 6 lbs of chickens so I had to adjust the quantities of the ingredients. I reduced the amount of butter in the sauce but added a dollop of BBQ sauce and extra Sriracha. I also pulled the chicken out at about the 35-40 minute mark, coated it and finished the last 10 minutes in the oven. I gave everything a final coating and served it to a hungry family. FYI: this chicken tastes just as good as leftovers!

I used Thai chili sauce and omitted honey. I added a little Hoisin sauce. I will add grated ginger next time.

I basically made it as the recipe called for. I went light on the soy sauce, butter, and didn't add any additional salt, because I'm trying to reduce salt intake, but in the end, this recipe was delicious. I'll make it again.

Made this recipe as written, with the exception of increasing the Sriracha since we love our food spicy! I just think the thyme overpowered the chicken. I'll make this again but with maybe 1/2 tsp of Thyme. Otherwise, the flavors were great.

Excellent!  Wonderful taste even before the sauce.  Would also be good on the BBQ with the glaze added and allowed to caramelize.

As I often do, I failed to read the directions... I mixed all the seasonings and liquid ingredients together and coated the chicken legs. Also, I had 5 pounds of chicken legs, instead of two. I put the sauced legs in a 9 x 13 pan and baked them for an hour. The good news is that there was plenty of "sauce" and it was delicious! A nice amount of zing.

I did what I read in the comments which was to pour a little of the sauce on top and add another 5 minutes to the cooking time. It gave them a glaze and was so delicious! The kids even loved this recipe! Will make again very soon.

I've made this twice and really like it. It's got some heat but is not overwhelming. I did a half teaspoon less thyme and a half teaspoon more garlic powder than the recipe called for. That worked better for my tastes. Served with mixed vegetables.

My family enjoyed this recipe.  I made it with chicken thighs, half the dish had skin on/off.  After making the sauce as directed I tasted it and decided to add more sriracha (used equal parts honey/butter & sriracha)...other than that no changes.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I've made this recipe twice - the first time as written, and again last night with some changes that we thought improved the taste. When analyzing what I didn't like about the first attempt, I noticed that some of the ingredients that go in with the oil didn't seem particularly Asian to me, so I substituted peanut oil for olive oil, omitted the thyme, and substituted five-spice powder for paprika. I also added about half a teaspoon of toasted sesame oil. For the sauce portion of the recipe, I made it as written.

My family loved this recipe, but I personally love my food on the spicer side. So I will add more Sriracha and a bit less thyme next time.

Not a big fan of thyme. Would leave out next time. Otherwise really good. Would also be good on thighs.

So awesome and easy! I followed recipe to a t which I don’t normally do. I found 4 lbs of chicken legs on sale yesterday and then found this well rated recipe today. I agree that this will be a long time fave in my family. My picky 7 year old said he liked it too! Next time I will add more Siracusa though because we like more heat. Thank you so much for sharing!!

This was way over powered by the thyme. Ground thyme is much stronger than dried leaf  thyme so I would go with only 1/2 tsp. next time. I also removed from the oven before completely done and added the glaze on one side, bake 5 more minutes, turn and repeat. Other than the thyme, a good recipe that I will make again! Thanks!

My kids can be picky eaters with new recipes, but they both loved it.  I did add less sriracha and included capers in the glaze which I brushed on the chicken and baked for ~ 10 minutes.

This was a very good recipe for chicken legs, which I don’t care for but I had in the freezer.  The sauce is delicious and the next time, I will use thighs or wings.

I added chopped cilantro to the sauce and made it look like the picture...It was DELICIOUS!  I only used 1 T of Tapatio hot sauce instead of siracha, as I don't like it too hot. Will make this recipe again for sure!

Loved the flavor of the sauce. I actually decided to brush it on the cooked chicken, thereby saving some for another use. Great recipe!

Tasty!  My husband, 12 y.o. daughter, and I enjoyed the sauce, but we did not put the sauce on the chicken legs for my 7 y.o. son who prefers milder dishes.

This recipe turned out awesome for me. I used barbecue sauce instead of soy sauce and everything was delicious.

Delicious! I made this with drumettes, and followed the recipe without changing anything else. Great with lettuce wraps!

Tasty and simple.  I normally don't mix sweet and savory but my kid picked out this recipe so I made it.  It was very good and easy to make.  It was not too sweet and had light to medium spice.  We will add a little more sriracha next time.

I made it exactly as written, but I thought the honey Sriracha sauce was a little thin. I took another reviewer's advice and basted them, then put them back in the on 425 for 5 minutes and basted them again before serving. They were delicious! I served them with garlic mashed potatoes and cheesy peas.

Delicious! My family does not like things very spicy so I increased the soy sauce and honey by 1/2 tsp. I think next time I might try 1/2 tsp of salt instead. I will definitely make this again!

Turned out great! I was missing some of the ingredients so I had to improvise quite a bit. Used sloppy joe sauce, hickory "bold BBQ taste", instead of Sriracha hot sauce and did not have Paprika and Thyme so I used Cayanne pepper. My boyfriend loved it ;);)

Really great.  Easy to make.  Loads of flavor.  Served it with steamed broccoli and cheese grits with green chilies.

This was fantastic! The only changes I made were to omit the thyme because my family doesn't care for the taste and I didn't have any honey so I substituted brown sugar. I tossed the oil and spices in a large a baggie, then added the chicken to coat and refrigerated for a couple hours before cooking. Baked for 50 minutes, 25 on each side, and it came out perfect. I also made the sauce in the microwave. Very easy and great tasting recipe.

Delicious!  Doubled the recipe since we had 4+ pounds of chicken legs, but followed the recipe as written otherwise.  The boys DEVOURED it!
