This is amazing, and even better the day after.  I did add a bit of almond extract to the cherries, and next time will try Grand Marnier instead.  Also, I made the whipped cream according to another recipe: 2 cups cream, after thickening, add 4 Tablespoons powdered sugar and 1 tsp cream of tartar.  I think this helps keep the whipped cream from going flat.  Company left and the cake has now lasted four days, still great!  (and by the way, it looks just like the picture!)

Very easy and turned out great. I did make a few changes. I bought one box of cake mix and made two round cake pans, but they were not tall enough to cut in half and make 4 layers so I made two. For the frosting I added cheesecake pudding mix to the whipping cream and did a second batch with chocolate mix. I made the middle layer with the two frostings and cherries. I also covered the tire top with the canned cherry filling. 
I made it for my sons birthday and everyone loved it . The best part is it can easily be modified to be a different kind of cake.

Very beautiful, moist and yummy!  Even with a cold mixing bowl, beaters and heavy cream, it took me closer to 10 minutes to whip the cream into stiff peaks.  I folded 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 4 tablespoons of sugar into the frosting after it was whipped so it wouldn't taste so plain.  Also topped the cake with some reserved cherries.  This recipe is a keeper!

Cake was delicious but the cream was very bland. Needed something to sweeten it up. I found it difficult to keep the layers from sliding with the cherry pie filling. In the end it wasnâ€™t pretty to look at but it tasted good.
