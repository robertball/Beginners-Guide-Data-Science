Very yummy. I think the variance in reviews between liking it and saying it is too sharp and vinegary could be due to the quality of balsamic vinegar used. Good quality balsamic is so mild you can eat it straight off a spoon and it is almost sweet. Inexpensive balsamic might as well be plain white vinegar. So don't be thrifty on the vinegar quality, you'll only regret it.

Such simple ingredients for such phenomenal taste.  Absolutely delicious!  Definitely 5 stars as written, though the 2nd time I made this I reduced the vinegar down to 1/3 of a cup for hubby's sake.....  For a change of pace, try adding green onions and fresh minced garlic to the mix and letting the roast marinate overnight.

Excellent!  It's a shame that the previous reviewer chose to toss the tenderloin out due to the "vinegery" smell, because it produced one of the better pork tenderloins ever for me.  But then, I really enjoy the flavor balsamic vinegar lends.  I say try it (if you like that strong flavor too) because I really didn't think it was overpowering at all....in taste or smell! Thanks for the recipe!

I made this last night and it was awesome.  I made just a couple changes.  I used 1/4 cup balsamic and 1/4 white whine.  I also added a squeeze of honey and a clove of pressed garlic.  
After marinading, i put into a 9 x 13 baking dish and poured all the marinade in with it.  I put in one large chopped onion, 4 medium yukon gold potatoes cut up, 4 carrots cut in sticks and two stalks of celery cut up.  I layed them right down on top of the marinade in the pan and kind of mixed them around a bit to soak up the juices.  I then sprinkled with rosemary, salt and pepper.  I baked on 350 for 45 min in a foil tent, then cranked up the heat to 450 and took the foil tent off.  I cooked the roast for 10 min this way, then took out to rest & wrapped in foil.  Then I stired the veggies around in the juices and then put them back in the 450 oven for about 15 more minutes.  THIS WAS FANTASIC.  Everything had a wonderful glaze to it.  The meat was moist and oh so good.  :)  Thanks for the great starter recipe! :)

Simple ingredients, great results.  No need to change or add a thing. The roast turns out incredibly moist and tender and the juices reduce to a deep, rich, and flavorful "balsamic reduction," right in the oven!

My family loved this pork loin roast, it's the best we've ever had. I added 1/4 cup of honey to the marinade and cooked it until it was 160 which was perfect. With carry over cooking it ended up at 165. Perfect!

I made this with a dusty (and I do mean covered in dust) old half-gone cheapity-cheap bottle of Cento balsamic vinegar that I've probably owned for 3 or 4 years.  Shameful, I know.  But I say all that to say that...WOW WOW WOW.  You probably don't have to worry too terribly much about the quality or price of the vinegar.  This was SO incredibly good.  And the whole house smelled fantastic while cooking.  And my 3, 4 and 8 year olds gobbled it down, also.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and cut two yellow onions into thick slices and lined the bottom of the baking dish with them.  This was absolutely the way to go.  Those onions were perfectly cooked, drenched in the yummy sauce, and my husband and I heaped them all over the meat.  Just writing this review makes me want to go back to Trader Joe's right now to get another roast...annnnd *maybe* a new bottle of balsamic vinegar.

I marinated the pork loin as instructed, but cooked it on the grill instead of in the oven... 20 minutes over direct medium heat, followed by 40 minutes on indirect medium heat. It was scrumptous.

Excellent! I added about 1T Canvender's Greek Seasoning and 4 crushed garlic cloves to the marinade.  Moist and Delish.  Use a meat thermometer for best results, 145 is great because it will continue to cook, do not cover.  Again, very good.

This is the best pork I've ever made.  We too love the smell and taste of balsamic vinegar, so we loved the smell and the taste.  I had company the first time I tried it, the adults loved it, the kids loved it, and I was asked to make it again soon.  This is the only way I'll make a pork roast again.  I only marinated it for 2 hours due to time.  Don't know if that made a differece or not, but I will do it the same way when I make it today.

I love the taste of balsamic vinegar, so this recipe was right up my alley.  Added 3 crushed garlic cloves along with a little salt and pepper to the marinade - Perfect!

I have also noticed some discussion about the temperature to cook the meat.  On May 24, 2011 the USDA made some important changes in their recommended cooking temperatures for meats. Here’s what you need to know:

When Cooking Whole Cuts of Pork USDA has lowered the recommended safe cooking temperature for whole cuts of pork from 160 ºF to 145 ºF with the addition of a three-minute rest time. Cook pork, roasts, and chops to 145 ºF as measured with a food thermometer before removing meat from the heat source, with a three-minute rest time before carving or consuming. This will result in a product that is both safe and at its best quality—juicy and tender.

So anything above 145 ºF is safe after a 3 minute rest period.  Then it is just a matter of taste.  I use the following as a rule of thumb: 145 ºF yields a wonderfully juicy Medium Rare, 155 ºF produces a solid Medium Well and 165 ºF creates a dusty Well Done.  These temperatures are out of the oven temperatures and still need the rest period.

Thanks for a great tasting recipe.

This was fantastic.  Cooked to an internal temp of 150 (perfect)!  Marinated for about 3 hours and used "Regina" Balsamic Vinegar and Montreal Steak Seasoning by McCormick..  Some people recommended placing pork on a bed of onions so the bottom would not burn (good idea), and added 1/4 cup of water and some white wine so as to create some gravy later (good idea).  Very very tender.

This recipe is super easy!  I've substituted red wine vinegar, and I like that way better, but you can't go wrong with this recipe.  The pork is juicy and delicious!

This is unbelieveable!  Tender and moist.  I do not like vinegar or anything sour - so I figured I would just eat something else when I served this .  It is the best pork loin I have ever had.  We could not stop eating.  Like other reviews I added 1/3 cup honey to marinade and placed big thick slices of yellow onion under the roast.  Then topped off my plate with the onions.  My husband raved and raved...I'm raving too.  For the steak seasioning I used Montreal Steat Grill Mates. Thank you for this now family favorite!!!!!

Have made this recipe many times now.  It always turns out great.  My husband tells me every time that its worthy of being served in a fine restaurant.  A little trick that I learned, is if you take the leftover marinade after the roast is cooked, strain out the seasoning, add 1/4 cup brown sugar and boil for a few minutes, you get a wonderful glaze to pour over the cut pieces. Truly a simple and wonderful recipe!

Very tasty, and simple.  Just a note to the person that gave this a low review but did this in a slow cooker.  All slow cookers are not alike, and I think the word slow cooker can be deceiving.  I too have had things come out dry in the slow cooker, but usually from cooking to long to where you simply cook the moisture out of the meat. I think timing is so important in the slow cooker, and adding some chicken broth may help some.  Chicken broth and pork go great together.  I would try this recipe in the oven as it is posted here first, you might be pleasantly surprised.  I always follow a recipe to the letter, then make changes based on my likes and dislikes.

Amazing! Oh the smell is to die for. I am a huge balsamic fan anyways. I have made this a few times and recommend a thermometer for sure. I didn't use one once and it ended up too dry. Now I cook it to 145 and pull it out. I also used a metal pan once because my only proper glass one was in use and the marinade burned to the bottom. SO USE GLASS. It doesn't burn in the glass pan. I use Weber Chicago steak seasoning. And I marinate it for about 10 hours. How could something so easy taste so wonderful! I like to make it with asparagus and I used the leftover marinade over it and the pork when I serve it. Sometimes I splash a bit more vinegar on mine, but that might not be for everyone. Like I said, I just love balsamic. My other half cant stand the smell or taste of vinegar but he is a fan of this pork.

Hate to be the one who says it's great but changes everything, and yet...this is a great recipe, but I changed a few things, and it was truly gourmet.  I marinated as indicated (with my own dry rub), using organic golden balsamic vinegar: a great choice.  I then took a trick from prime rib and mixed 1/2 cup flour with some spices (herbamare, garlic, onion powder), and coated the roast with the flour mixture.  I then baked the roast at 450 for 15 minutes before lowering the temp for the rest of the cooking time.  This left a nice, crusty outer, and a lovely, juicy meat.  I used the scrapings from the pan and made a sauce by incorporating some homemade broth.  I also roasted some veggies (beets) along with the meat: it was great!

I use a very similar marinade all the time. Same amounts of olive oil and balsamic vinegar but I add a couple Tbsp each of dijon mustard and honey, several sprigs of fresh thyme and 3 or 4 cloves of crushed and chopped garlic.  When I want to spice things up a bit I'll add a Tbsp of crushed red pepper plus juice and zest of 1 lime. I always marinate overnight and salt and pepper the meat before putting it in oven or on the grill.  I use this marinade for pork, chicken and even rib roasts. Don't be afraid to try this or to experiment and make it your own. Excellent marinade, thanks for sharing, Melissa.

The smell of vinegar was so strong while this was in the oven that I had to stop cooking it so I could throw it out and air out my house!

This was a great recipe. I always have trouble with my pork loin -it never seems to come out tender enough for my young toddler (15months old) to chew -so we eat tenderloin mostly. There was a sale on pork loin this week and I decided to try another pork loin and this recipe was amazing. 

I made some changes:
I used 1/4 cup white wine vinegar and 1/4 cup white balsamic vinegar (because we were out of my regular balsamic vinegar)
I also didn't have steak seasoning, but I found the ingredients list and so I added salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika and rosemary. 
I marinated it all day and then roasted it that evening -it was so tender!! I could not believe this was my pork loin!! 
Because I used white balsamic vinegar I didn't need to add anything to make my drippings into a wonderful sauce for the pork! 

The only thing I had a problem with was the temperature. Pork cooks to 170 -175, not 145 as stated in the recipe. Even with standing and tenting, that would not be cooked enough. It took me about 1 3/4 hrs for my 3lb roast to cook and I had to jack the temp up to 375 after the first hour because I was running late by that time. I'm still giving it 5 stars though!

The flavor was delicious, but as other reviewers have mentioned, the meat itself is a little tough.
Update: I take it all back. I've tried a few different variation on this recipe now. The meat was only tough when I let it marinate for only two hours. When you leave it overnight or even 2 nights it gets juicy, tender, and delicious. Also, carrots, butternut squash, sweet potatoes, and pretty much any sweet vegetable taste AMAZING roasting along with this dish in its sauce.

I just had the most delicious roast pork loin thanks to this recipe!  My balsamic was a bit tart, so I corrected the flavor with a bit of honey to taste.  I roasted carrots and onions with the pork.  Yum!  Served with new potatoes sauteed in brown butter, steamed buttery hericots verts from the garden, and homemade wheat rolls, this was one memorable meal!

Thank you for posting the recipe.  This is so beautiful as a base marinade.  Many wonderful things can be added, or it can be great as is (with a sweetish balsamic).  Everyone just needs to taste the marinade before putting over the pork.  If your vinegar is too sharp, the marinade is easily corrected with a little honey or brown sugar.

this was a big hit here. I see some folks had problems with it baking dry. The instructions do not say to cover with foil when baking, but I did. It did not get dry that way. I think a piece of foil is the simple solution here...no need to make more marinade or add water.

Had a very good taste to it.  My wife felt the vinegar taste was a bit much.  Easily fixed by adding pineapple chunks as a topping.  I will be making it again, possibly adding some pineapple to the marinade.  The kids enjoyed it as well.

I did add sliced onion and diced garlic to the pan in addition to doubling the sauce ingredients. I seared the meat before putting it in the oven. INCREDIBLE!!!

I threw the stuff together and let it marinate overnight.  Was all in a baggie so clean up couldn't be easier!  Cooked as directed except added 4 garlic cloves to the marinade.  Threw some baby carrots and red potatoes on the pan and it was a meal.  Glad I used the meat thermometer, it came out perfect.  Thanks for a quick and easy meal.

This is a great idea but has too much oil which doesn't reduce.  The second time I sliced my meat into 1 1/2 inch rounds and covered with my preferred salty steak rub for slightly more than an hour.  I learned in a cooking magazine that this is a form of brining.  At first the surface is very wet but the salt and liquid is drawn back into the meat.  I used only 1/4 cup of olive oil and the whole amount of vinegar and cooked for a shorter time to reach the correct temperature.

Thank you for an amazing recipe!!  My husband raved over it and my daughter ate three slices!!  I took the advice of others and baked it over sliced sweet onions and some minced garlic for 45 minutes uncovered at 350.  It had delicious flavor and was incredibly moist - definitely a keeper!!  Thanks for sharing:)

FINALLY!!!  I'm a pretty decent cook but no matter what I do, I always and I repeat always overcook pork.  If it's undercooked and I throw it back in BAM it's overdone and bland.  This recipe was super easy, I actually had everything in my house already (including a pork rub I used instead of steak) and I did add sliced garlic to the mix.  I thought for sure it would be too heavy on the balsamic but it was amazing and although I cooked it a little long it was still super moist.  Usually left over pork gets tossed but we fought over the leftovers!  I also sauteed some mushrooms in a pan and added the cooked marinade (while the pork was resting) to the pan and a little flour to thicken it up and poured that over my finished product and it was incredible.  Thank you so much for this new staple to our meals.

Excellent.   I used Greek Seasoning instead of Steak.   I put new potatoes, carrots, mushrooms in with it.   I cooked it for 30 mins at 350 and then reduced it to 300 for 1 and 1/2 hours.   I did cook a 4 lb roast.   I was super......

I made this for dinner last night & everyone loved it!  The only thing I did differently is I used pomegranate infused balsamic vinegar, added lots of chopped garlic and roasted baby carrots along side.  I also placed the roast, fat side up on top of sliced red onion.  This keeps the roast from sitting directly on the pan. It won't stick to the pan and the onion flavor is infused into the roast.  I also added a 1/4 cup of water to the pan while roasting. There was plenty of cooking liquid left to make a wonderful gravy!  I will definately make this again!  Thanks!

This is delicious!  I seared in a cast iron skillet first, then put in the oven.  Truly the best pork roast I have ever made.  So juicy, just keep basting every 15 min. or so.

Moist and delicious.  After reading other reviews I worried it would be vinegary tasting.  I did marinade the meat for several hours but then discarded the marinade prior to baking.  I put the pork loin on onion and apple slices & added a can of chicken broth in the bottom of the pan to keep imeat moist and so I could make gravy when it was done.

Had a 4 lb pork loin, so I doubled the recipe. Added 1/3C honey, 2 cloves minced garlic & some minced green onion. After piercing meat all over with a fork, I marinated it for about 6 hours. Baked (with some sliced baby carrots) at 350 for 1 hour and 45 minutes. The meat was tender & the flavor was delicious! After baking, I mixed a cornstarch roux in with the leftover liquid...made a delicious sauce for the meat, carrots & mashed potatoes!

One of the best recipes I've tried.  I always start with an organic pork loin.   Did add 1/4 cup honey and lots of garlic  some kosher salt and pepper to the marinade as others suggested and marinated over 2 hours.  Place in large cast iron skillet and surrounded with sweet potatos, yellow potatos, carrots and onions poured in marinade with a little dry white wine (one time I used organic chicken broth) and cooked on indirect heat for 2-3 hours to 145 degree.  Family loved it!!  First recipe in a long time that there where absolutely no leftovers.  Must try and do use a good balsamic vinegar as well as good quality olive oil.

I've made this a couple times now, and it is delicious!  This time, I diced up some potatoes and carrots, tossed them with a little olive oil, lemon juice, and italian seasoning, and baked them along with the pork loin.  The potatoes and carrots absorbed some of the extra marinade, and they were even tastier than the pork itself.  Yum!!  This made for an easy, hearty dinner.

I usually agree with most reviews - but this wasn't good at all.  I used a good quality balsamic (I love balsamic vinegar and use it often).  But the pork/balsamic did NOT make a flavorful combination in my opinon.  The roast was VERY tender but I didn't like the flavor at all.  Neither did any one in my family.

Great recipe! Easy to make! I added chopped garlic and green onions to the marinade per others thoughts, as well as cooked it on a bed of sliced yellow onions. We will be having this again very soon.

I seldom follow a recipe exactly, but this was a great jumping off point.  I marinated a pork loin in balsamic vinegar, olive oil, onion, garlic and a little honey for about an hour, then baked it in the oven, covered in tin foil, just removing the tin foil for the last 10 minutes.  It came out tender, but just a tad dry.  My husband raved about it, and used the leftovers for sandwiches.  Will make this again.

If it weren't rude to write in all caps, I would do it. I love this recipe!!! It is freaking amazing. I almost always make my pork loins like this now. The only thing I've ever changed is added a tremendous amount of minced garlic. I love that I always have these ingredients on hand and that it yields such an economical and incredibly delicious dish. Thank you for sharing this!

Everyone really enjoyed this!  I made the following additions suggested by other reviewers here:  garlic to the marinade; 2 sliced onions under the pork; 1/4 c water and 1/4 white wine for additional liquid in the pan and threw in some baby potatoes and carrots. Everything was moist and flavorful and best of all, it was super easy!

This was really fantastic. The pork was so moist, tender and juicy I will make this again. I used a 4lb pork loin because that is what I had on hand. The only change I made was to cut slits in the meat and add two garlic cloves that I cut up. I love Balsamic vinegar so this was a no brainer. I was surprised I added extra  Balsamic vinegar and it was great. I made a gravy from the drippings.

I did have my doubts about this recipe, but decided to give it a try, using the marinade over night. I did add a light salt and pepper rub before marinating. This pork loin roast turned out to be one of the best we ever had.

This smelled delicious, but even though I had the pork defrost in my fridge for four days before, AND even though I upped the oven temp, the middle stayed raw in the middle after 8 hours in the oven. And my oven works fine. If I did something wrong, let me know. I followed the recipe exactly and I have never tried to make a roast before. I will probably never try again. We had to order food for the night.

too vinegary.  I bought a mid-priced balsamic and followed the recipe exactly.  My steak seasoning was not a salt base rub, but a pepper-based. Does that make a difference...does salt help neutralize vinegar? I would like to know what kind of seasoning others used?  I would also like to know what or how to grade balsamic vinegar?  Surely, price cannot be the only way to judge quality!  This recipe needs some pointers added to the directions, please!

excellent- I thickened up the sauce a bit by adding some WW flour at the end. I followed another viewers advice & lined the glass baking dish w/onions on the bottom, I also added fresh mushrooms. served w/twice baked pototoes & some green beans- wonderful aroma & tasted great!

So tender it melted in your mouth and was very flavorful.  As usual I made recipe adjustments by placing the loin in a metal pan and broiling one side then the other for 5 minutes each before baking at 350 degrees.  Using a meat thermometer it was done in 40 minutes.

Very good!! I didn't have balsamic vineger, so I used a steak rub and marinated the loin in balsamic vinagerette for about 3 hrs then cooked in a crockpot for 8 hrs on low with the marinade too....didn't even need a knife it just fell apart!

We made this recipe exactly as written using Montreal Steak Spice and marinated it almost 24 hours.  We placed it on the onions as others had suggested.  The house smelled amazing, the flavour was very good and my husband loved the onion addition.  Next time I think we'll increase the heat to 375 to have the sauce reduce more and caramelize.  Very tasty, thank you.

This was excellent! Other than adding fresh garlic, I didn't deviate from the recipe, and it was wonderful. It was so flavorful, moist and tender ... and let's not forget easy. I did marinate it overnight and served it with Jasmine rice and a crisp salad. Nothing fancy, just a wonderful meal!

I find that pork loin tends to be dry 95% of the time.  This recipe produced the BEST pork loin I have ever made!  It is tender, moist and so flavorful!  I agree with one of the reviewers that if you use a cheap vinegar, you will not get the same result.  I used a mid range balsamic and I did not experience any of the preview reviewers complaints of strong pungent odor.  I will be making this over and over again!

Don't even know if the roast taste good yet.  Had to come on here right away and say something.  I baked a 2lb 1 ounce roast for one hour as indicated.  Would have been cooked perfectly if I was cooking a beef prime rib roast.  Almost completely raw in the middle at one hour

As suggested by a previous reviewers, I used a high-quality (expensive) balsamic and also added 1 Tbsp Cavender's Greek Seasaoning. Marinated overnighted.  Served with steamed yellow new potatoes with were fabulous with warmed marinade.  Overall, a huge hit -- simple, simple and tasty.

This recipe was SOOO good!!!!! I loved it! I've had so much trouble with cooking pork loin before this recipe. It would always turn out dry!! This was the complete opposite. The meat was soo juicy and flavorful! This is totally my new go-to, favorite recipe for pork loin!!! We had this with garlic whipped potatoes and corn bread. We also used the drippings from the pork loin for a little gravy. Overall, our loin marinated for a full day, and it was well worth it! We also used, what I consider, a pretty good marinade. We used Marzetti's balsamic vinaigrette. I think the quality of the marinade makes all the difference!!! Try this, we loved it!! YUMMM!!!

Oh my!  This was SOOO moist and tender - and the flavor was amazing.  I think whoever said that it was too 'vingery' and they threw it out must've used regular vinegar, or maybe apple cider vinegar.  The balsamic really works well with the pork.  I had a big 5 lb pork loin, so I just doubled everything - YUMMY!!

Great recipe with yummy results. It did have a vinegar smell while cooking so I was concerned but when done the roast tasted great and was juicy and tender! I think this recipe would work great on the grill with porkchops.

This was great! So easy to throw together after work. I did not marinate it but will next next time. I will also use the other reviewers suggestions of adding other ingredients in the pan like veggies, garlic, potatoes and pineapple.

This was so easy to make and very tasty! The outside was slightly sweet and the meat was moist. Definitely do baste the meat while cooking, it makes a difference. I will be making this again.

This was delicious; my husband loved it, too.  I made it exactly as directed, and I used Emeril's Steak Rub.  It was a last minute decision, so I marinated the meat for only about 2 + 1/2 hours.  I wonder if the reviewers who complained of the flavor being too strong marinated overnight - balsamic is very powerful stuff and I think a longer marinating time would result in a much stronger flavor, maybe even overpowering.  2 + 1/2 hours seemed to be just right.  I will make this again.

Wow!!! What a great dinner. We love balsamic vinegar. I never thought of putting the two together. I served it with mashed potatoes and the family was using the sauce on the potatos also. I have no improvements at all to add. This recipe is a keeper!

Delicious! This has been added to our permanent selection. We may try this recipe on the BBQ when it's too hot out to roast in the oven. I also thought it might be good with chicken or turkey breasts.

This was FANTASTIC, will definitely make it again. I added some pressed garlic to the marinade, and before putting it in an onion-lined glass baking dish, I quickly pan-seared the roast on all sides at high heat. My oven tends to run a little low, so I upped the baking temp to 375, with the last 10 minutes or so going at 425 (but that was more for the benefit of the potatoes than the meat). Served it with roast potatoes, broccoli and carrots... my husband said I could make this ANY time. Sooo good, definitely recommended.

This is the best pork loin I have ever made.  I love basalmic vinegar and I let it marinate for 24hours, which resulted in a very moist, tender loin.  My two picky eaters also enjoyed this one.

This has become our favorite!  I add a little more vinegar and water, and at the end, I make a little roux, probably 4 T. of butter, 4 of flour, and add the drippings to make a sauce to serve with the pork loin!  Wonderful!

I followed instructions exactly and was disappointed, given all the rave reviews. While I very much like balsamic vinegar and used an aged, high quality product, it overpowered the meat. I'll have to agree with some of the others, that said to reduce the vinegar to 1/3 cup.

I'm not really a "reviewer" - but HAD to with this recipe.  Seriously, the best HANDS-DOWN recipe for pork loin I've ever had.  Husband made it for dinner tonight - and it totally ROCKED!  Extremely juicy and tender.  We didn't marinate it over night- just in the fridge for a few hours.  And he basted it every 15 minutes while it cooked.  So tender we could barely cut it!  He said did have to add a little water to the pan to keep the juices in there - but turned into a nice gravy.  We served it over rice - OUTSTANDING!  This is definitely going in our permanent recipe box!

Wonderful, Wonderful Flavor. From a previous reviewer,place a generous amount of sweet onions on the bottom of your glass baking dish. Next time I will double the marinade. pierce the loin for even more of that wonderful flavor. The baked loin with the marinade and onions make for a perfect sauce. I also add some cut potatoes and carrots, for an easy one dish meal. Try this, you won't be disappointed. Thank For Sharing.
I have made this on numerous occasions ,
And the flavor of this dish is outstanding. Most recently, I chopped some FRESH basil
Over the top, prior to serving and this took the recipe to a completely new dimension.
Thank you again.

This is an absolutely fabulous recipe.  We made this for Christmas dinner and even the kids enjoyed it.  I agree that the quality of the balsamic vinegar will definitely affect your experience with this recipe.  We marinated the meat 6-8 hours and found it to be excellent.  Next time I will marinate overnight.  We also didn't have steak seasoning on hand, so we googled it and found a recipe for Montreal steak seasoning.  Perfect!

I love balsamic vinegar and I did not care for this one bit.  I made the recipe verbatim and it didn't turn out.  Maybe with a little tweaking it could be better, but I am not wasting my time.  Thanks, but no thanks.

Most delicious pork I have EVER had.
I'm considering reposting the recipe because instead of putting it in the oven, I used my pressure cooker. It came out SO good. I used all the same ingredients, but I used 2.40 lbs of pork (what I had) and I added 1 cup of water and put it all right into the 6 qt. pressure cooker. NO MARINATING! Put in on the stove on high till it started rocking and knocked the heat down to medium to keep it moving gently. I let it rock for 40 minutes, then turned off the heat and let the pressure come down on it's own.
When I opened the cooker, the meat was falling apart and juicy and WONDERFUL. I will make this for everyone who will let me! I loved it.

Yum, yum, yum!  Even my 15 month old agrees.  This was sooo easy too.  I added garlic to the marinade but it probably didn't need it.  I also copied another reviewer and made a gravy with it.  It totally didn't need it, but I couldn't bear to just waste all that delicious marinade.  I separated out the oil first, then poured the marinade back in the pan, added some white wine, and thickened it up.  The gravy was outstanding although the pork itself was so good we barely touched it.  I think we'll appreciate the gravy when we heat up the leftovers though.  Or we might use it to liven up some turkey cutlets.  So many tasty options!

Used Wishbone's Balsamic Vinegarette instead of olive oil and balsamic vinegar separately (I was out of the balsamic vinegar). Also used the new A-1 steak rub. Threw in a crock pot and cooked for 8 hours. Turned out tender and perfect!!

Sooo Darn Good! I marinated a 4 lb. pork loin for 4 DAYS in fridge a zip lock with aged Villa Manodori Balsamic Vinegar which is a sweet balsamic from Williams Sonoma and Montreal Steak Seasoning and some olive oil and this was perfect! Not vinegary at all as I think might be with a cheap brand. Cooked resting on top of sliced sweet potatoes and onion slices so as not to burn on the bottom. Served onto a big bed of white rice with a can of French Onion Soup and a splash of red wine added to make more gravy. So juicy and tender! My husband, college sons and friends ate it up! Thanks for making me the hero tonight!

I was hesitant to make this cause my parents were eating over. It is now one of our favorite meals. Even my picky 4 year old ate it! It was DELICIOUS! Don't let the vinegar smell fool you, it tastes amazing! I'd rate higher if I could! Thank you so much for sharing!

Great starter recipe! Gave it a 4 because it needed longer to cook than suggested and it also needed a few tweaks or the vinegar taste (and yes we used high quality balsamic) would have been too strong. Modified as others suggested by adding minced garlic (lots), 2 tablespoons of honey, and an additional 1/2 cup of water near the end to make gravy. Marinated it for 24 hours. I watched it like a hawk so it wouldn't dry out while it was cooking. It took about 1 hour and 20 minutes until the pork was no longer pink for my 2 lb roast. I piled veggies (squash and red potatoes) around it and they had to be cooked longer to soften at a higher temp. Served this with gravy (just added cornstarch to the drippings) and homemade applesauce. Everyone raved about this recipe. It was by far the most tender pork I've ever eaten. This is a keeper!

This was fast, easy & AWESOME!!!  I subbed Montreal chicken seasoning for the steak seasoning. Didn't have time to marinate or cook for one hour;therefore, I used a meat tenderizer to flatten the pork loin, then dunked loins into mix & placed on a baking sheet lined with release foil. Poured any remaining mix over the loins & cooked at 450 for 15 minutes...delicious, nutritious & QUICK....whole family loved it & there were no leftovers. We usually hate pork loin because it gets dry & tough so easily, but not this time!!!. Thanks Melissa for the spectacular recipe!!!  UPDATE: Tastes incredible with vegetables (marinate when making kabobs), chicken (tenderized & cooked in electric skillet) & tilapia (dipped fish in marinade, then breaded w/ Panko crumbs & baked for 15 minutes).  This is my go-to marinade recipe & I would give it 10 stars if I could..it is awesome with everything!!!

I used a turkey loin and the result was so tender and yummy. My family loved it! Our daughter even went back for seconds! I'm sure it would turn out just as tasty using pork loin, but I had thawed a turkey breast loin and used it. I will definitely make this again!

Very good!  I don't usually marinate a roast, but I decided to try.  I did put an onion under the roast - it works as a grate to lift the meat up a bit and adds some nice flavor.  I also used this recipe with a red wine vinegar instead of balsamic.  I would serve it for company either way.

Used this recipe after hubby brought a pork tenderloin home unexpectedly.  I did use salt free steak seasoning(all I had), but did add my own salt.  We cooked the tenderloin using a rotisserie on the grill.  I did save the marinade and boiled it on the stove for a few minutes so I could safely use it to baste the tenderloin as it cooked.  It turned out beautifully.  Very flavorful and moist.  Will most certainly use this recipe again.

I added 1/2 tsp garlic powder to the marinade. Sliced the pork loin into thin fillets before marinating for 4 hours. We then grilled, beyond amazing! I served w/ real buttermilk whipped mashed potatoes, Au Jus thickened gravy, garlic green beans, and if I had the time, homemade garlic rolls!

recipe 'as is' would be a 4-star, but when you add onions to the bottom of the pan under the roast, it becomes a 5-star. the onions carmelized in the marinade and were delicious on top of the pork.  1-hour in the oven was perfect.  served with boiled red potatoes for a very healthy meal.

I made this for Christmas dinner. It was my first experience cooking pork and everyone RAVED about it all night and into the next day (no exaggeration). I took the advice of other reviewers and got a quality 10 year aged balsamic vinegar and added a squeeze of honey to it. I let it marinade overnight and cooked it to 150F. It was delicious, tender and so flavorful!!! Will definitely make this again!!

This is wonderful dish and can be prepared ahead of time. We let it marinade for two days and the flavor was sensational. My wife put the marinaded meat in the oven after work and made side dishes of canned green beans from our garden and some mashed sweet potatoes. A very easy and tasty meal! Enjoy

This is a easy & delicious way to prepare a pork loin roast.  I've made it several times and had rave reviews each time.  The roast is so flavorful and juicy!  I gave the recipe to both of my grown sons and they have prepared it for their friends and it was a hit every time!  One thing...do NOT marinate for longer than stated because it will make the roast taste too "vinegary".  If you stick to 2-3 hours maximum, you'll have success every time.  Note:  The gravy is delicious on mashed potatoes or rice!

This was excellent! Thanks for the post. I tented the pork when it was finished while I attended to the potatoes and veggies..and it was a little dry by the time we ate the pork, but that was my fault. I will definitely make this again, and no tenting next time!!! Thank you!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I added fresh cilantro, and made it with pork loin chops instead because that's all I had.  I only marinaded for 2hrs, would recommend a little longer.  Over all quite tasty, it will be made again!

I love it when I can add another easy but fabulous tasting dish to my recipe collection.  Not only that, this is a two for one recipe.  I love Cipolline onions, those little flat onions that look and are the size of little door knobs, I usually braise them as a side dish but this time I just peeled them and added them to my roasting pan with the pork.  This is the only way I am going to fix them from now on.  I served this with a citrus salad  with baby greens and a loaf of French bread.  Dessert was simple too, one of my favorites from Italy; a scoop of vanilla ice cream, a few chopped walnuts and a tablespoon of chestnut honey.  This whole menu leaves plenty of time for visiting with guests.
The poor reviewer who threw out her roast, may have thought that "Balsamic" was a brand name?

I tried this recipe for the first time a couple of days ago.  Like several other readers I guess I have cheap balsamic vinegar on hand because it turned out with a strong "wang" taste.  My 7yo son and I liked it but my wife did not.  So the next day I chopped 1/2 white onion and 1 green bell pepper that I sautéed in some leftover bacon grease from breakfast.  I then chopped up the rest of the pork loin and added a jar of BBQ sauce.  Mixed all of that together and let it simmer for 20min.  I plated the BBQ mixture on top of leftover mashed potatoes with green beans on the side.  The result was a very yummy tangy BBQ pork and best of all my wife liked it this time :).  And that's what matters.

Made this tonight!  So simple and amazing.  I used a center cut about 2 lbs. I used adobo seasoning some chopped garlic and a high quality balsamic. Cooked a little over an hour. So juicy and delicious. You should marinate overnight. I only did for two hours. I love balsamic anything, but you have to use a higher quality brand when cooking and having it as the main flavor. Excellent recipe!!  5+ stars!

Cooked this tonight for dinner and it was a winner. Family loved it. It was easy to prepare too. I followed the recipe to the T and added a little extra when roasting it. After reading some of the recommendations, I decided to line the dish with onions and baked the pork together with carrots and potatoes. It came out looking a little burnt but the taste was excellent. It was not dry as claimed by some reviewers. Instead it was just perfect; succulent. My husband loved it. 
Thanks for sharing the recipe. Will definitely do a repeat for the next family gathering.

I found this recipe on this site just before Christmas 2013.  Served it Christmas Eve for the first time and it was huge hit with everyone!  Followed the recipe exactly and loved it.  Have served it several times since including this Easter.  I add a little butter, wine and corn starch to the remaining pan drippings for a terrific gravy.

This was SO great! I read the reviews before starting and added carrots, onion and celery to the bottom of my glass dish set the pork on top of that and then put portabella mushrooms on top of that (they were on sale). I love vinegar so I had no issues with the smell. I brought it into work the rest of the week and every day I went to heat it up I was complimented on how wonderful it smelled. I bought a meat thermometer because some people were worried about the temp. This was my first experience using a meat thermometer so my readings came out all wacky. I stopped looking a it and just had the meat in there for 1 hour like it called for and it came out very nice. It had a light pink color in the middle. Not sure if this matters. I eat my steaks as rare as possible so pink and blood in any food never bothers me (iron stomach/immune system here). But I figured I would share my experience with you so you can make your own adjustments when making yours. I will definitely be coming back to this recipe again and again! Thank you for sharing!

Excellent. Followed recipe as written without any changes. Marinade resulted in a nice glaze while the meat was very tender, juicy and flavorful. Definitely a keeper. I did use a high quality balsamic vinegar which I believe may have resulted in the glaze on the meat as it cooked. Marinated the meat all day but not overnight.

This was excellent! So glad I came across this recipe. I don't like vinegar at all but this didn't taste vinegary one bit. Such a simple recipe. I can't believe how tender this turned out. I added chicken broth to the pan gravy & made a wonderful gravy. Recipe is a definite keeper!

Family loved the roast it was moist and very tender.   I marinate the roast for 4 hours placed in my roasting pan and poured a small portion of the marinate on the bottom then added water to this.  The smell in the house was great. Will be doing again.

I cooked a large pork loin with this recipe.  I followed the directions to the letter and it turned out perfect.  The only thing I did change was prior to placing the meat in the oven I used my grill and seared the meat on very high heat to lock in the juices.  After the meat the seared I placed it in a cooking dish with the remainder of the marinade, which I used to baste the meat during the remainder of the cooking time.  Great recipe I would encourage anyone to use this.

This recipe was very easy and the pork came out tender and moist. I kept all the measurements the same but added 4 cubed potatoes and 1 sliced onion to the sauce before baking and it came out perfectly in 1 hour.

My husband and I just finished this meal and was very happy that we both went for seconds.  I made a 3 lb. loin so I add a bit more of the steak rub seasoning and the balsamic.
As other reviewers recommended, I added vegetables (carrots and yellow onion) and minced garlic.  The flavor was very good but the steak marinade I used (Montreal Steak Seasoning) had quite a bite to it.
After, I took the pork and plated it to cool, and put the marinade in a small pot on low heat with Wondera and made a fantastic marinade...although when we cut the pork, it was so moist it didn't need it.
Great dinner, very happy with it and will definitely make it again, playing around with it...maybe adding honey as others suggested.
Thanks for this great recipe, I am not a "big" meat eater, but I will definitely make it again!

Awesome and unique recipy. Very tender.
I added 3 minced garlic cloves, mushrooms and sliced onions.  The onions and mushrooms end up being carmelized.

This was really easy and delicious.  After marinating two hours, I cut slits in the top of the roast and inserted a mixture of minced garlic, dried rosemary and sage, plus a little Lawry's salt and pepper (which is how I would usually make it).  Spread the remaining paste across the top and sprinkled with Lawry's and pepper.  Then I added onion sliced to the bottom of the pan so they cooked in the balsamic/olive oil mixture.  All in all, really simple to make and a big hit at home!

This was delicious BUT my husband & I are big vinegar fans.  I can see where it may be a little too tart for some.  I add a little Dijon mustard to the marinade to prevent the vinegar & oil from separating & make more sauce so we can pour it over the pork slices. Also add some sliced onions for a bed for the pork.  Otherwise this was perfect! Served with the pierogi casserole on this site.

This recipe is easy and all of my family loved it.  Definately for those that appreciate stronger flavours. If you don't like balsamic vinegar, go for one of the sweeter pork marinades.  This site has an abundance of them.

Loved the taste of this!!! I followed the directions for seasoning this, but it was so hot I didn't want to turn on the oven so I cut meat into 2 inch chunks after seasoning it, marinated for about 3 hours and then dumped meat & marinade into  a dutch over. Browned meat off on med-high& then lowered to med, covered it for about 20 minutes. YUM!!! Even my husband liked this & he's a very picky eater, Thanks for the great recipe. I'm thinking of doing this again & rolling in flour tortilla shells with sourcream & shredded cheese for a spicy pork sandwich.

This made a tender, moist pork roast.  We had a last minute change in plans so my roast marinated for 24 hours.  I think that was to long.  Will try this again with a shorter marinade time.

Awesome flavor!  I did change a couple of things though.  I had taken out chicken for supper so I thought that I'd use this recipe but change it up abit.  I pounded the chicken flat and marinated them in the steak seasoning, oive oil, and vinegar mixture for 3 hours.  I then broiled them for 12 minutes.  They turned out awesome.  They were super moist and just delicious!  I plan on adding cajun seasoning next time I use it for chicken.  I'm planning on making a pork roast this week and I will be using this marinade...it has an awesome flavor!  Thanks so much Melissa for this one!

This was fantastic. I marinated it over night with some smashed garlic, and followed the rest of the recipe and cooking time to a "T". Wouldn't change a thing. The hubby loved it. So, it's a keeper in my book. Thanks for sharing, Melissa!

Honestly I think the flavor might take a little getting used to but this is the most tender pork that I have ever made!!  I would definitely make this again.  Oh and I'm sure my balsamic wasn't top shelf and the recipe was still great.

Very good, but next time I will cut the olive oil in half. I see no reason for that much oil, it prevented the vinegar from reducing enough in the pan, and simply sat on top of the sauce. I ended up pouring it into a saucepan and cooking it down for a while, then spooned it out trying to leave most of the oil behind. It was very good then. My roast ended up a little dry, but ovens do vary and now I know to reduce the time a bit. Will make again.

Very good. The cooked down marinade was very good after adding a splash of white wine, a splash of chicken stock and thickening with a little cornstarch and water.  Yumm.

I really enjoyed this! I didn't have enough time to marinate the roast in the fridge (only 1 hour), unfortunately, but I kept basting to ensure the flavor and juices cooked though. I found the meat to be a little dry, but that was my fault as I left it in the oven a little longer than I should have.  I'd make this again - thank you for sharing!

This was a really tasty recipe. I did think it was a little too salty, but it didnt ruin the flavor. I would only use 1 tabl. spoon of the steak seasoning instead of the 2 tabl. to bring down the salt. This recipe is a keeper for sure thank you for sharing it!!!

I love when I can find a recipe so easy and equally delicious!  It's a great recipe to serve company.  I cooked a 2.7 lb. roast for 1.5 hours at 350. I marinated it for 2 hours. It was not over powering with the Balsamic Vinegar. UPDATE: I recently made with boneless thick pork chops and it was just as good. I marinated them for about an hour and used my George Forman grill.  EASY!

this recipe is all you could want...absolutely simple to make...and marvelous to eat. The stuff about the vinegar smell while it cooked?? about 15 min in, there was an odor (not overpowering); it diminished as cooking continued. I cooked till temp was 140, took it out and tented it for 10 min-by then temp was right at 155, more than safe for todays pork. I have a moist, tasty roast. I even spritzed it with balsamic vinagrette dressing, I like the flavor so much!!! Will make this over and over!! I am looking forward to sandwiches with the leftovers.

This is definitely a 5 Star recipe. Simple, yet delicious. I marinated overnight. I placed the pork loin atop a bed of thickly sliced sweet onions as others suggested. This was heavenly. I had my uncle over for dinner, he is an extremely fussy eater, however, he raved about this and had  3 helpings. I would highly recommend this recipe!

Sooo good. I marinated a 3 1/2 lb. pork loin about 5 hours in a zip lock bag and made no substitutions. Baked it with an instant read thermometer to 145 degrees  (@ 350). I forgot to baste it until the last 10 min. but it turned out fabulous. It served 5 of us with leftovers for pork fried rice the next night.

We really didn't care for this very much.  I'm just not sure that steak seasoning and balsamic vinegar go together very well.  Also, that was an awful lot of olive oil.  If I ever make it again I'll choose different seasonings, maybe something herbaceous, and use the olive oil only when I'm ready to put it in the oven and no more than half of the oil that was called for.

This is a go to recipe in our house. I use this steak seasoning from 17th St BBQ called Magic Dust. You can order it online and it is one of the best purchases I've ever made. We use it on everything!   I never marinate more than 2 hours because who really has time for that with jobs and kids.  I think the best tip I found in reviews is to add some honey.  It makes the recipe.   I just squirt some in the bag and I think it balances everything perfectly.  Honestly, this is our favorite thing to eat in this house!!!

I really enjoyed this recipe. My boyfriend bought me a pork loin, which I have never cooked before. So I ventured online to find a decent recipe and was so excited to find this one since I am a huge fan of balsamic anything. It was exceptionally easy to make, my house smelled wonderful, and my son and I devoured it! We used Montreal Steak seasoning as the rub. Great find and very filling, with side salads, mashed potatoes with cream cheese and cooked carrots. We added potatoes to it and off we had the perfect meal!

I received flavored vinegars for a birthday gift, how delightful.  I used Fig Balsamic vinegar to make this dish and it was great (was torn between that and cherry balsamic), served with scalloped potatoes and fresh string beans and viola!! a great dinner had by all.  Thanks so much for this recipe.  I'm in unchartered waters when cooking with vinegar, but with balsamic, it just really kicks up the flavor of food.  I recently made chicken marsala and added a 1/4 cup of cherry balsamic vinegar to the wine, not knowing if I just blew this dish, and it was better than I ever made it.  Start using flavored vinegars gals, and your palette will love you for it.  BTW, when using vinegar in a baked dish, turn your head away from the oven door when you open it because that first waft of escaping hot air mixed with the vinegar smell will be stunning and almost overwhelming.

Followed recipe exactly.  Turned out great! Easy, Easy, Easy.  Used Montreal steak seasonings. Let it marinate for 4 hours. Had a roast that was slightly less than 2 lbs. and it took approx. 70 min in a 350 oven.  Basted every 10 min.  Started checking meat temp at 50 min.

This is one of the best pork roast recipes I have ever tried.  The only thing I did extra was to add 3garlic cloves to the marinade...we are garlic lovers!!!  I made gravy with the marinade and drippings and it was fabulous...my husband said it was the best roast I have made...will make this again for sure.

This was a PHENOMENAL tasting roast!!!  I had a pork loin, had the (quality) balsamic vinegar but didn't have steak rub in the house.  So I used Adobo.  I didn't dilute or dissolve the adobo, instead the loin had been frozen immediately at the time I purchased it and was put in a zip lock back to marinate in the balsamic.  Once it defrosted, I sprinkled the adobo all over and let it sit about 15 minutes to permeate the meat.  Then I baked at temp as directed but in a terracotta porcelain glazed baking dish.  AMAZING!!!  Seasoned mashed potatoes (home recipe) and Harvard beets, a dinner the whole family LOVED!  Just for the record, I repeated a similar process with a beef roast using zesty Italian dressing and adobo (also inserting several cloves of garlic into the roast) and it too was phenomenal!  That dinner got seasoned roasted red bliss potatoes and peas with pearl onions. DELISH!

I was not sure that I would like a pork roast marinated in this mixture, but it was absolutely delicious! My daughter came to look at it saying that she wasn't hungry and just wanted a small taste - but once she tasted it she wanted more! She said that she had been debating as to which dish to serve for some visitors who were coming, but this pork roast recipe was going to be it!

Absolutely delicious; excellent flavor and so tender.  I marinated it all day. I prepared it as directed and added sliced onions under the pork as other reviewers suggested.  Definitely a keeper.  The next time I make it, I will invite company.

Great recipe as written. Very flavorful. I would recommend puncturing the roast before marinating so that it gets into the meat more and a bit more salt is helpful.

Why people give a recipe five stars then tell us all the changes they made is beyond me - that's not rating the actual recipe people!  We've had this roast several times and it's incredible AS IS, no changes, therefore five stars.

Fabulous! Who knew a few simple ingredients could produce such amazing results! The only thing I changed was to add 2 cloves of minced garlic to the marinade. Now, here's the secret to the success of this marinade... you MUST use very good quality balsamic vinegar! The cheap stuff is VERY vinegary tasting and will give poor results and then you will come and pan this recipe. Use the good stuff and you won't be disappointed!

This was just an awesome dish. My husband said it was Christmas dinner-worthy! Very quick and simple. I didn't have any steak seasoning so I used some Greek seasoning. I love another user's suggestion to slice an onion thick and rest the roast on the oven while cooking. I will be doing that with ALL my roasts in the future. Meat came out unbelievably tender. This one is a keeper!

This is really a keeper!  Tender and very flavorful.  Only used half of the marinade in roasting.  I think the difference in reviews has to do with the balsamic vinegar used.  I used a very high quality Italian vinegar which gave it a rich (not vinegary) taste - though I have to admit that I had serious doubts when it was cooking!

I used the marinade with a few pounds of pork tenderloin and threw them on the grill. So easy and very flavorful.  My family like it very much.  I would definitely marinate it over night. Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely wonderful! I added about 2-3 T of brown sugar to sweeten it a little (I have kids), but I think it would be great either way. I'm done looking for good pork loin recipes now!

After reading many of the reviews, I made it a point to have on-hand high-quality balsamic vinegar. I then cooked the loin exactly as the recipe instructed (adjusting the ingredients to a 5-pound loin).

This must be one of those dishes that appeals to particular tastes. While my spouse and I can eat it (in small servings), we definitely do not LIKE it. (Who can afford to waste 5 pounds of meat these days?)

Absolutely delicious! Previous comments about using an authentic, good quality balsamic vinegar are spot on. This is critical to the success of this or any recipe calling for it.

This is fantastic!  Even my hubby, who hates any type of vinegar, said this was incredible!  Just before putting the tenderloin on the BBQ, I boiled the marinate, so I could brush it on the meat during cooking.  I also used it to dip french bread into during dinner.  I then seared the tenderloin on high (approx. 3 minutes per side), then turned the burner off, so the meat did not get direct heat.  Every 10 minutes or so, I would lift the lid and brush meat with marinate, turn it over, and brush it again.  after approximately 25 minutes, I inserted a meat thermometer into the side of the tenderloin so that the tip was in the center of the meat.  When it reached 145 degrees F, I removed the meat, covered it with foil, and let it rest.  I brushed the sliced french bread with olive oil and placed it onto the BBQ, while the pork was resting.  Once again, fabulous recipe.  Thanks Melissa S. for sharing!

Made this tonight for dinner. It was awesome! Followed the recipe, but added garlic to the marinade. I also put slices of onions under the roast. I did thicken up marinade and juices for drizzling on the meat, but I added some brown sugar to make it more of a sweet and sour sauce. Definitely a keeper! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This was sooooooooo good that I probably won't even look at another recipe for pork roast!!  I used Montreal Steak Seasoning ......yum.  I did not cook it in the marinade but will next time.  Plus, I will try it in a slow cooker.  Thanks so much for a new HIGH standard!!

This was easy and so tasty!  I cut the oil to 1/2 and added 1/2 cup of brown sugar, did a bed of sliced onion and mushrooms, foil tent removed  for the last 10 minutes and it was perfect. Try it out once and  you will be hooked.

What I loved about this recipe was its simplicity, flavor, and I always have the available ingredients on hand.  What I didn't like was the salt, which is inherent in the steak seasoning.  For a two pound roast, I cut the ingredients in half and it was plenty of marinade.  Also, because of the salt, I recommend marinating for only 1-2 hours.  Definitely use a meat thermometer and take it out a bit early because it will continue to cook.  (Mine was a bit overdone.)  Next time I will cut the amount of steak seasoning and this should be perfect!  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  prepared exactly as written, took quite a bit over an hour to reach 145 degrees though.  145 was perfect- it continued to cook to 160 while sitting out as we ate our salads and was done to perfection.  Might add garlic next time as some suggested, but as is it's still great- use good balsamic vinegar.

so little ingredients, so wonderfully delicious...and I only marinated for 2 hours! Pork was so tasty and juicy.  I added baby portabella mushrooms & peppers to the pan & put on top of pork for serving...awesome!  This recipe is a keeper!

The flavor on this was wonderful - didn't taste vinegary at all. However, 1 hour for a thick pork roast was not enough time. Had to cut it in half and cook for another 45 minutes which made my lovely marinade burn in the bottom of the pan.

Made this tonight and the kids and my husband loved it. The balsamic reduces to create just enough sauce. I used Monterrey steak rub (that is what was handy).  Served it with roasted veggies and quinoa.

Best pork loin we have ever had. Kids and husband loved it. I too seared it first before putting it in the oven. I pulled it out when the temp reached 155 degrees and let it sit for 10 minutes before cutting into it. As other reviewers mentioned I believe it also depends on the type of balsamic you use. The one I used for this recipe is sweet. I don't know if I would have liked a tart one as much.

It was good. Made it using a 4lb loin.  I didn't have enough Montreal Steak seasoning so I wasn't able to double any of the ingredients.  I also used minced garlic.  Would probably be better if I could have doubled the ingredients.

Awesome! The whole family loved it. I too made a gravy with wine. I also made a vegetable and barley side dish from Chuck Hughs from cooking channel that really went well with the pork. Great recipe.

This was very good.  I followed the recipe exactly and was very tasty.  I surrounded the pork loin with halved red potatoes and those got rave reviews.
I think next time I make this I will add some crushed garlic to the marinade though.  It could have used just a little something else.  Maybe some herbs too.
All in all though, it's certainly a keeper!

Usually I am not a very big fan of pork, but I tried this recipe and I loved it! The pork was so tender and it tasted delicious. I also diced up red potatoes and added them in with the pork while the pork was cooking. It was a simple way to complete the meal.

Excellent! I have been cooking since I was a kid, but somehow I'd never made pork before tonight. My boyfriend asked me to cook some, so I wanted a simple recipe to get me started. This was so perfect! I used pork cutlets instead of a large piece, added 1.5 tablespoons of honey, and chopped some mushrooms to put in the pan with the pork. It was fabulous. He loved it! Thank you!

And the crowd goes wild! Everyone loved this.  I used Montreal Steak Seasoning.  When it was time to put it in the pan, I added sweet potatoes, carrots and onions, coating them in the marinade as well.  When the pork was done, I put it on a plate, boosted the oven up to 450, and let the vegetables cook a while the port rested 10 minutes.  A wonderful meal!

Delicious!  My son, who dislikes pork, told me he would eat pork as long as I prepared it in this way!  For those who thought the balsamic over-powered the meat must not be fans of balsamic vinegar.  This is what made the dish "restaurant quality," to quote my husband.  I took the advice of one reviewer and patted the roast with about 1/2 cup seasoned (onion & garlic power and dried rosemary & thyme) flour.  I also added 4 cloves minced garlic and 1/2 C white wine to marinade. Thanks for a terrific recipe, Melissa!

I put the meat in the marinade in the morning, and then had a nice weekday dinner.  I probably would increase the marinade the next time to make a little gravy.  The marinade just about cooked completely dry in the dish.

I'm always a little worried that pork roasts will be too dry, but this was perfect! I used a garlic and herb steak rub with the balsamic vinegar, and the flavors blended very well. I will say that after an hour and reaching a temperature of 145 degrees, the center of my roast was still very undercooked. I put it back in the oven for about 15-20 minutes more until the temperature reached 160 degrees and it was amazing! Everyone in the family was asking for seconds and thirds!

We didn't like this.  My daughter thought it was too sweet, my son asked "what's this marinated in?" I ate one piece and that was enough.  Bummer because I really like pork roast. I will stick with the old garlic and rosemary approach.

Truly 5 stars!  This was so flavorful and tender.  I followed the recipe almost exactly; only I made one addition.  I added 3 cloves of pressed garlic to the marinade.  Absolutely delicious!  Made the kitchen smell just divine.  I had to bake it for about 20 minutes longer, and it was perfect.  This is now a part of my rotation.  Thank you for posting!

Excellent roast and oh so simple. My seven year old came in while it was cooking and asked what smelled so good. She not only devoured her meal, she pretended to be a dog so she could lick the plate. I would say to marinate this overnight as I did; I don't think the marinade would lend enough flavor after just a few hours.

This is basically Filipino Pork Adobo but with balsamic vinegar instead of cider vinegar.  This would work very well with chicken, too!  Easy and tasty, was wonderful on a bed of plain spinach!  Yum!

I made this the other night for the family.  It was delish.  I did use a half of a pack of Lipton onion soup mix when disfusing the vinegar and olive oil.  Marinaded for two hours.   I was awesome.   Served with mash potatoes and garlic spinach.   Thank you for the recipe!   I would definitely make this again!

This is sooo good!  The Balsamic smell can be strong but doesn't taste strong. I have a small house so maybe that is why. My son (17) came home tonight and and said excitedly, are we having pork? Love this recipe!

This was wonderful. I had a 4lb pork roast, so I doubled the sauce. I was a little nervous as the vinegar smell was a little over powering. Do not worry, as it does cook off. And as I said this was a great dish!!!

This was a great dinner on a work night.  I marinated the tenderloin overnight and while I was preheating the oven after work I sliced up carrots and potatoes and added them to the pan after tossing with the extra marinade I set aside the night before.  My teen boys said this was a keeper.

Wow, what a wonderful surprise! Based on the reviews of this recipe I expected it to be good, but it was better than good...it was amazing! I added one minced clove of garlic to the marinade and cooked the roast in a cast iron skillet with some cubed potates. Minimal effort and just a few ingrediants yield a wonderful result. I can't wait to make this again.

Mmm, we loved this marinade!  I had to make my own steak seasoning and added a touch of honey.  I loved that it had a little kick to it but not overwhelming.  Even my kids enjoyed it!  Thanks for the recipe.

so tender and flavorful - and simple!  I used a cut of tenderloin I had in the freezer, and just marinated it while it defrosted for a couple hours in the fridge.  Baked it while it was still a little frozen, and it still wound up tasting amazing!  I served it with this: Garlicky-Baked-Butternut-Squash from the site.

Wonderful recipe.  I also added about a third of a bottle of white wine I had kicking around.  Turned out great!  Also added more garlic and my own herb blend.  Will make this again.

Excellent!!  My "go to" pork roast recipe now.  My whole family (hubby and my dad especially) rave about this pork.  Definitely a dish to impress guests.   I take care of the roasting of the pork, then my husband makes a gravy with the drippings.  He pours the drippings into a gravy seperator, then pours everything but the fat into a saucepan.  He then adds a little white wine, sugar (to taste), and corn starch to thicken.  Just go light on the gravy when pouring over the pork until you figure out the right ratio of pork to gravy for your taste.  The gravy is strong, more of a "drizzling" sauce, than a gravy.

Very tasty.  I did take some advice from other comments and added Garlic and some honey to the marinade and roasted the meat on a bed of Onion slices, which I think really helped add depth to the overall taste. The meat was tender and had a very unusual flavor from the ordinary.   My husband usually has a hard time eating foods with alot of Vinegar ( i.e. buffulo wings, mustards, ect...) but he really liked this dish.  A make again for our household!

This turned out to be a waste of balsamic vinegar. I put my roast in a slow cooker. After cooking on low for 8-9 hours, it was dry (first time EVER in my slow cooker) and you could not even TASTE the balsamic vinegar.

I agree that you should use a good quality balsamic vinegar.  I added garlic and Mrs. Dash, since I did not have steak seasoning.  This was simple and everyone enjoyed it.  I would make it again.

Very, Very YUMMIE!!... I followed the recipe and it turned out great.  Once it was out of the oven transferd to a warm plate and used the bottom of the skillet (crusts+juices) to reduce an even tastier dark sauce..10 stars...crowd pleaser!!!

This was very good. It was a nice change from regular seared pork roast. I used a very expensive balsamic vinegar, and it did not taste like vinegar. I also added some onion onion from tastefully simple and fresh crushed garlic. I marinated mine about 6 hours.  I used an oven thermometer and took it out at 160 degrees. It finished cooking and it was very moist. My 8 and 6 year old sons really liked it too.  I will make this again.

I didn't have steak rub so I used a pork rub I had, it worked well.  While cooking I got a strong vinegar smell but the meat didn't have a vinegar flavor.  It did have a nice flavor and was very moist, the outer layer of the meat had a very good flavor where the marinade had baked on.

This was delicious!!  I made one small addition.  I wasn't exactly sure what you meant by steak seasoning, but I had Montreal Steak Seasoning on hand, so that's what I used. It ended up being just a little too spicy for what I knew my girls would eat, but I loved the flavor, so I decided to add a 1/2 cup of honey to make it sweet and spicy...and they loved it!  I went out the next day to buy another piece of pork to make it again!

This was a great recipe, We loved it the first time we had it.  The second time, I added some fresh garlic, a touch of honey, and a big dollop of dijon.  I took out the pan juices when the meat was at about 130 degrees and reduced them into a glaze that I used for basting in the final stages.  The result was a beautiful crust on the pork which itself was moist and flavorful.

This is a good recipe for pork loin. It came out juicy (for a loin) and with just the right amount of balsamic flavor.  I recommend this for anyone who wants an easy first-time pork loin recipe or likes balsamic vinegar.

So yummy and so simple, I've made several times since. Used Montreal Steak Rub and it came out perfect. I actually did not have enough balsamic vinegar, one time, and I substituted red wine vinegar to make up the final amount.  Still turned out great.  Will make again!

Can you say tasty?!?!  I used a herb oil and regular balsamic from the Kroger.  Cooked mine on my friend's green egg until internal temp was 150 degrees.  Fantastic!

Very delicious!  However, next time i think I might have less balsamic vinegar and more olive oil.  I do really like balsamic too.  And any combination of seasonings work great with it.  I used an Italian seasoning mix.

I had to cook this rather longer than the recipe called for, but once it was done, it was tender and tasty. It was even better as leftovers, though-- sliced up in toasted wheat bolillo bread with cranberry-jalapeno sauce. Mmmmm... We'd originally planned a double batch to freeze half for a quick meal at a later date, but 2 days later we were digging out the frozen portion. Will definitely make this again!

I tried this recipe last night.  I had a 4.88 loin so I doubled the recipe.  I let it merinade for 6 hours.  I put it in the oven with a thermometer and 1 hour later I took it out.  The recipe said cook until temp reaches 145 degrees.  The meat was still bloody so I put it back in the oven until the temper reached 170 and yet it still had red areas.  Because it was so late I took some out and microwaves the meat so the kids could eat.  The flavor was good and the kids thought it was just OK.

This was a hit with the hubby (and me)! My grocer didn't have balsamic vinegar (out of stock, wrong isle, who knows) so I used vinaigrette instead. I also added fresh garlic. I marinated for 2 hours. After an hour of cooking, it was perfect. Thanks for the recipe!

Supremely simple, very tasty - I was pleased with the juiciness of the loin.  I marinated my 2lb loin for only approx 2 hours - I don't think that I would recommend marinating for much longer.

I just sprinkled Montreal Steak Seasoning on the loin (1.7 lb piece) and then poured in the liquids. Marinated in a bag for an hour and a half. Baked at 350º for 45 minutes. But my piece was a little smaller/thinner than the one in the recipe. Let it rest!!!!! It was the juiciest most tender piece of pork I ever ate. Served with stuffing and home-canned red beets. Delicious!

Made this one tonight...MMMMMM...fantastic!!!  Added snipped fresh rosemary & lots of crushed garlic cloves to marinade.  Also used only 1/4 c. olive oil.  Marinated about 4 hours, would do overnight next time. The kitchen was filled with mouth-watering aromas.  Cooked to 145F inside temp. (using oven probe) = perfect meat.  I will make this recipe over & over again.

This is a favorite! You can feed a lot of people with this recipe and the pork is just excellent.  I highly recommend it! After I served this dish a friend proclaimed "you have mastered pork!"  He's Cuban so you know that's a compliment.

I followied this recipe exactly and marinated the pork overnight.  The overwhelming taste of vinegar was so strong, my 7-year old son would not touch it!  Pork is normally one of his favorites.

Four couples (small church group) raved about my pork loin.  I was daring to try this recipe for the first time on guests and was not disappointed.  Everyone thought my house smelled scrumptous while this was finishing up in my oven.  This delicious loin was served with cabbage/raisin slaw, green beans with mushroom sauce, mashed potatoes, and topped off with chocolate mousse with raspberry sauce and real whipped cream.

I made it just as directed, but doubled the mix because my roast was 5 Ibs, it was nice and tender and juicy.  Everyone thought it was delicious!

Perfection! I put this in the fridge to marinade and then my hubby surprised me with a date so we didn’t cook it for several days. Oops. Good news is you can’t overmarinate this!!! And it was simply amazing. Definitely will repeat this! Also I added a clove or two of minced garlic because some others did in the reviews and I love garlic. Soooooo tasty!!!

Made this at least 4 times in the past year.  No changes.   Such a simple recipe with great results.  
Pork loin is not as tender and juicy as TENDERLOIN, but this recipe adds great flavour and i make sure to get it out of the oven at 140 or 145 and let it rest 15 to 20 minutes. ....  this keeps the loin as tender as a tenderloin.  Yummmm!

I made this for a dinner party, then recommended it to my Mother for a dinner party, and am making it for the third time for my daughter-in-law.  It's SO easy and very tasteful.  Make sure you use the marinate, that's left in the pan, on your meat potatoes or anything else you can use it on...It's delicious!!!

Excellent.  Added a tad more balsamic vinegar and chopped 2 cloves of garlic.  Also, USE your meat thermometer and check temp 3/4 through recommended cooking time!! It was done. A real pleaser with mash potatoes and a salad.  Bon Appetite

I really don't like pork loin or pork chops, but pork loin prepared this way is really good. Everyone else in the family will eat pork loin or pork chops any way you can make it, but I'm always on the lookout for ways to prepare pork that I am willing to eat.  Definitely marinate the loin overnight. It enhances the flavor so much. I put a few slits in the loin after marinating and before putting into the oven and basted it a few times during the cooking process. Really good. I will definitely be using this recipe any time my husband, who does the grocery shopping, brings home pork loin. Thanks for creating a pork recipe that I like!  Wonderful!

I didn't like the flavor when this was done, but the meat was incredibly tender. I just ended up eating some of the middle where the flavor wasn't reaching..

This recipe was so easy! I cut the tenderloin into slices and baked it for 30 minutes. Everyone liked it, even my roommate who doesn't like spicy stuff. I used 1 T. jamaican rub and 1 T. montreal steak seasoning. It was great! Thanks!

I will absolutely make this again.  The pork was full of flavor and so tender.  It didn't dry out at all.   My husband, who would normally choose beef over pork as a meal raved about this one.  I didn't make any changes and don't intend to ever.

This was excellent. The first time I made it, I used a balsamic that was aged 15 years in oak, so it was super mild and delicious. I loved the smell  of it cooking, and it wasn’t overly vinegary as a few have said. The second time, I made it for my son’s  family and they didn’t have the super aged balsamic, so I added quite a bit of honey to get it to the sweetness and consistency of my aged balsamic. Equally as good! This recipe is so easy and tastes so great, that I will be making this again and again! But the outcome will only be as good as the sweetness of balsamic you use.

This is a wonderful recipe! So easy but so delicious—sliced a few pieces of garlic and slipped it under the meat before popping it in the oven. And I didn’t get to cook it until after 48 hours of marinating because I was so busy. But this was perfect! Will be adding this to my rotation.

This was a very good pork roast recipe.  I did follow one comment and lined the bottom of the pan with thinly sliced onions.  I also thinly sliced garlic cloves, and pushed them into slits cut into the roast  I cooked it to 140 degrees and then let it sit before I carved it.  Very good dish!

This was awesome! I did half balsamic and half wine like some others suggested, and i used Pappy’s steak seasoning. I marinaded it for 24 hours since i put it together the night before and cooked it after work. Tender and delicious and wasn’t too vinegar-ish at ALL. Cooked it in a glass dish as suggested with carrots and potatoes. Next time I’ll add rosemary and garlic to the marinade and cook it on a bed of sweet onions like others did. Great recipe.

This was fabulous; I only marinated it for 3 hours, and roasted it for 1 hour for a 4-1/2 lb pork loin roast and it was perfect. Even the leftovers were fabulous; sandwiches, tacos, it is very versatile and tasty recipe.

Made with a tenderloin, but otherwise followed recipe exactly. As another reviewer suggested, boiled drippings plus some brown sugar to make a glaze. My husband said that made the meal. The whole family liked, even my pickiest eater. Served with mashed potatoes and applesauce.

We're vegan (oh, the irony), but I made this for my father-in-law--a man who is firmly entrenched in the 'meat and potatoes' camp.  While I think I may have slightly overcooked it, he raved about how the roast turned out and has claimed it as one of his favourite meals.  I used a good quality Balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil for the marinade and made a steak rub from a recipe found on this site.  The house smelled amazing as the pork roasted (and for quite some time afterward), and the vinegar didn't seem to be at all overpowering.  I served it with sauteed spaetzle and Bavarian style sauerkraut with apples and caraway.  It looked gorgeous, and I have a feeling I will be making it as a 'gift meal' at least once per month!

This recipe is fantastic and was a huge hit in my house tonight! I followed the recipe but did add some minced garlic to the marinade and put onions along the bottom of the dish before baking. I just happen to have a pretty good selection of balsamic, so I chose to use part raspberry blush and part aged Aceto Modena (10 yr). Now, I have no idea if using my choices or just good old Kroger brand really would have made a difference, as some other reviews have suggested, as this was my first time making this recipe. BUT it has now become a permanent addition to our home dinners and I’m very impressed. Easy recipe for anyone to follow and comes out beautiful, tender and flavorful. NOT Vinegar-y. I served mine over Parmesan Truffle couscous with a side of Italian broad (green) beans. Thank you for sharing your recipe with us!

This is the best pork roast I've ever made!!  I've always tried to steer clear of the pork unless it was pulled pork or pork tenderloin because most pork is too dry for me.  I found a pork loin roast in the freezer (only God knows how long it was in there) and started looking for recipes.  This one had so many good reviews I just had to try it.  I didn't have quit enough Balsamic Vinegar so I did what someone else did and used part Red Wine Vinegar.  Can't wait to try full Balsamic, the glaze that comes from Balsamic can't be beat.  I marinated it over night and all day and threw it in the oven for exactly an hour at 350 and it was the bomb.  Hubby said to make sure I write this down in my recipe book so he can find it when he decides to cook.  Thank you for a great juicy and full of flavor pork roast.

I made this for my husband and I.  We loved it so we made it for a family gathering we had.  We cooked 5lb with the balsamic recipe and 5 lb with another marinade we had.  Can I just tell you, the balsamic recipe pork was all gone by the time we got to the table.    Oh well, they loved it so that was all that mattered......lol   Would definitely make again!

I am a home cook of 40+ years. This was absolutely one of the best meat main dishes I've ever made. I had a 4.75 lb roast,  I doubled the recipe, I would be proud to make and serve this one again and again. Thank you for sharing!

I have made this 3 times now, and three different ways. The first was as the recipe was written with the only modification of adding minced garlic (WE LOVE GARLIC), and it was good. The second time was per recipe, but adding veggies and cooking in a slow cooker on low 8 hours. The meat was dry, and veggies needed either broth or extra marinade, not bad, just a little dry. This time I heeded another review and since I was cooking a 3# loin, I doubled the marinade, but did 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar, 1/2c white wine, 1c olive oil, 4T McCormick's Montreal Steak Seasoning, about 4T minced garlic, a generous squeeze of agave, didn't have honey for the marinade. Marinated overnight, then set roast down on a bed of sliced onions, poured marinade over and then surrounded roast with potatoes cut in 1/4's, carrots, celery and chopped onion. Because of the larger roast, cooked at 350 for 1hr 10mins under foil tent, removed foil and cooked another 20 mins. Removed roast and let set in foil while I turned veggies up to 450 and cooked another 20 mins. OMG delish and so moist! Great glaze on the veggies!!!! Thanks for sharing!

Made the recipe exactly as described and it turned out perfect both times! We used Trader Joe's balsamic vinegar (6% acidity, not sure if that's the main factor of sweetness) and it wasn't overwhelmingly tart.

I read about using metal bakeware versus glass bakeware and it's VERY important to use glass when making this dish: glass bakeware takes longer to heat up, but it maintains the heat over a long period of time. Metal bakeware heats up very quickly and is more suitable for when you want to brown things quickly (e.g: cookies). We also kept the marinade to use with the pork (we kept it in a tupperware in room temperature so the olive oil doesn't solidify).

100% would make again!

This is another one where you CANNOT let the simplicity fool you!  My husband loved this so much, he can't stop talking about it.  I had a 4 lb. pork loin in the fridge, so I cut it in half and made one for us and one for my parents.  Holy moly, this is a good dish!  I took the advise of another reviewer and put thick slabs of red onion under the pork as it roasted and then served them over the meat.  OMG!  Also, I served with roasted potatoes and carrots. My husband devised the system of cutting each roasted potato into fourths, so there was more surface area for the balsamic sauce!  Do yourself a favor and try this one.  New favorite at our house, for sure.

This was a very easy and tasty recipe. I would decrease the balsamic vinegar or add a tablespoon or two of honey, because the flavor is a bit strong. I made it with carrots they were delicious, that I cooked in the marinade. I served it with mashed potatoes. Definitely a good meal my family had seconds.

My family loved this !!! I actually layer it on top of onions ,carrots and potatoes and when the roast was resting for the 10 mins I continued to cook my veggies ... Great reviews from the family. Also my roast was only 7.00 dollars fed family of 4 with leftover pretty cheap but great dinner!!

Really, really good.  The quality of the Balsamic MUST be the key, because I used my reserve of "the good stuff" and it was in no way overpowering.   Also, I could see why some folks might say "yuck" because it's NOT the same-old-same-old pork loin.  But for for me--and the eight guys I feed five nights a week--quite delicious!!!  Thanks sharing your secret.

Made according to recipe. It was wonderful. I added about 2 cups of cut up fresh pineapple to the pan about half-way through baking and basted those as well. Yummy!

I had to make this simply to see what it was like.  How could something so simple be as good as this is?   Ridiculous.  

I LOVE balsamic and the flavor it gives to this pork is amazing.  

After baking the pork I made a gravy wtih a butter/flour roux, the juice from the pan, and some white wine.  Turned out really well.  We also like to saute mushrooms to have with this.  

If you are looking for a simple, quick, and delicious meal, try this!  You can't go wrong.

This was easy and great on the grill.  I used Costco balsamic vinegar and it tasted great and I'm not a balsamic vinegar lover.  I divided a 2 lb. loin into two parts  and marinated a few hours.  I cooked the loins for a total of ten minutes over high heat turning over once then cooked over low heat for twenty minutes basting a few times with the marinade.   I used my LP gas grill.  I mention this because if you use charcoal or a Natural Gas grill your times will vary.   My temp on the grill while at high heat was about 425 degrees and about 300 degrees with low heat.   
This is a keeper!

I absolutely love this recipe! the pork turns out perfectly cooked and moist. I agree with the other comments, you definitely need a good balsamic vinegar. I also prefer to use the Chicago steak seasoning from weber. Have made this recipe at least 10 times and it is great each time!

My husband loved this!  I took the recommendations of others and put the roast on top of a bed of onions.  I also added some minced garlic and a little honey to the marinade.  I added carrots around the roast and the carrots and onions turned out so great together.  This is definitely a keeper!

The acid in the vinegar acts as a tenderizer, breaking down the fibrousness of the meat--you end up with really tender pork loin! I used a big tray of pork tenderloin medallions (just a pork loin cut up into individual servings) I purchased at Costco. I had planned to marinate it just 24 hours, but got busy, didn't cook dinner as planned, so the meat sat for a full 48 hours, which was a little worrisome. Nevertheless, the medallions were absolutely delicious. At 20 and 25 minutes the meat was still too rare. 35 minutes worked perfectly. Served this with hot buttered rice and roasted broccoli with Parmesan (also on allrecipes.com). My family loved this dish. For the steak rub seasoning I used Montreal Steak.

As this was baking I wondered if it would be too strong, but my wife was salivating as soon as she walked in from work. This one will become a standard in our home. Very Good. The second time I made this, I changed the recipe to 1/4 cup each of  Basalmic vinegar, Olive oil, and Dale's steak sauce and 1 lb of tenderloin. This was even better!

I've made this several times. This recipe is fantastic just the way it is but there's a lot of ways to tweek it if you want. It's really simple and delicious but tastes like you slaved in the kitchen all day. Very hard to mess this one up.

Simple, quick & uses ingredients always on hand.  I have also added garlic powder and some rosemary and it was fabulous.  Ignore the negative vinegary comments - this was fabulous. Used a pork sirloin roast and sliced leftovers for sandwiches. Great leftovers too!

This was fabulous!  I followed the recipe exactly, and it produced really tender, flavorful, delicious  pork.  Our family loved it, and I've been asked to make it again.  The rub I used is Johnny's Spice Rub(also from this site). and it was wonderful.   I plan to use it on chicken and steak as well as pork.  The only down-side is what happens to the roasting pan--I used corning ware, and it took me two days to clean off the burnt food.  But it was worth it!

I enjoyed the easiness of the recipe, overall hit with the boyfriend. Rather than using plain balsamic vinegar, I used jalapeno flavoured balsamic, and garlic flavored olive oil. Overall, a flavorful and easy dish!

Simply amazing. My husband couldn't even tell this was the same cut of meat I made last week because it came out so juicy and tender this time! I did read other reviewers feedback and added some garlic and honey to the marinade but I'm sure it would have amazing even without it. My roast was 2.5 lbs and I cooked it for 50 minutes and it came out perfect. The packaging said to cook it 20 minutes per lb.

The best pork I have ever made!!! I never rate recipes on here, this is my first time. This one deserves more than just 5 stars! I followed the recipe exactly, but sliced the pork and threw it on the grill and it was to die for! So juicy, tender, and the flavor was perfect!

Ding! Ding! Ding! -- Johnny, we have a winner!

Very simple recipe that turns out fantastic. This is in the "keeper" file for  sure. One family member isn't crazy about pork, but we converted her with this recipe. As others have suggested, don't skimp by using a cheap balsamic vinegar. I found a balsamic in the North End of Boston years ago (Rubio) which is a delicious, high quality balsamic. At $25-30 a bottle, I was a bit reluctant to use a half cup of it on a recipe I hadn't tried, so I mixed it about half and half with another decent balsamic that was about half the price. I may use all Rubio next time - I think it does make a big difference.

This is wonderful. I followed the recipe as posted, marinading it overnight. The pork was moist and tender and very flavorful. I think the reviewer who suggested that the difference between loving it and thinking it was too vinegary was in the quality of the balsamic vinegar, and I whole-heartedly agree. I used a high-quality, (read: expensive) balsamic vinegar and there was really no vinegar smell at all in the marinade. Cheap balsamic vinegar can be quite harsh and I can imagine it would ruin this dish. This recipe is a keeper in my house.

This pork was outstanding.  Could not ask for better flavour and the meat was juicy, tender and done to perfection!  Thank you so much for my new go-to recipe for pork!

A hit at my house! I marinated as written but used a pork tenderloin. I’ve done this many times and we’ve always enjoyed it. I like to cook tenderloin to 145* , a little pink.(Salmonella is no longer a threat.) Tonight I took a suggestion from another reviewer and thick cut 2med onions, added some rough chopped garlic and some carrot slices, placed on baking sheet, poured marinade over veggies, laid tenderloin on top. Veggies were still crunchy after meat was done. Next time I’ll roast these veggies separately, or better, take out meat to rest and continue roasting those veggies. On a separate sheet, I made rosemary roasted red potatoes w/ the remaining carrot slices and those came out delicious! Thanks so much for this go-to marinade! I’ve used it on steak, too.

I've made this several times and it's a winner.  I use a really high quality Balsamic Vinegar.  It has a mellow almost woodsy note to it.  Some people with vinegar issues may be using the wrong kind.  Rule of thumb, if you couldn't pour it on lettuce as salad dressing - might not be good for this recipe.  I'm making this again tonight!

Next time I will use  a little less oil but this was good, added chopped garlic.  I cooked it on the gas grill,used the same marinade on brussels sprouts on the grill.

Made this recipe tonight and it was a HUGE hit, amazing and very easy recipe. I stuck pretty close to the recipe with a few small variations as previously recommended by other reviewers. I added 1/3 c. honey and 2 crushed cloves of garlic to the marinade. I let the pork marinade overnight. I also layered the pan with chopped onions when cooking. I cooked as directed at 350 x 55 minutes, uncovered. I cooked with diced gold potatoes, sweet potatoes and carrots. I removed the pork after 55 minutes and bumped up the oven temp to 375 , covered the pan with foil and cooked the veggies for 15 more minutes. This turned out AMAZING and my guests were raving about it. Fyi, I used Private Selection Balsamic Vin. and McCormick Montreal Steak Seasoning (for the steak rub). Must try!

I use Aromat seasoning, cane pepper and balsamic viniger. I did not use oil. I marinate it for two nights since I were going to be away the day before I wanted to cook it. It's a must keep!!!

The family loves this. I use Montreal Steak as the rub. It's much better if it's given the suggested time to marinade, but I've also just tossed it together and baked with good results.

I LOVE balsamic, but did not like this.  It tastes better cold than warm.  I plan to re-purpose the leftovers into something more palatable.  Maybe pork fried rice or Cuban sandwiches.

Looks yummy, except that it is cooked medium rare, and pork should ALWAYS be thoroughly cooked. That means no pink at all.

I can't remember ever being so conflicted about what rating I give a recipe.  First off, the flavor is fantastic! So I'll base my 5-star rating on that. I used Montreal Steak seasoning (McCormick) and the directed amount of vinegar and oil.  I marinated overnight and cooked to a temperature of 145 degrees using a meat thermometer.  My problem is this...I had very little liquid left after cooking, so I ended up mixing up an additional 1/2 batch to supplement what was there.  Maybe the baby carrots and 1/2 onion I added soaked up the liquid, but I sure didn't get the reduction that others described.  Bottom line is I'll definitely make it again, but will double the marinade.  Thanks for the recipe!

We have tried this simple but delicious recipe several times however we always grill it. Perhaps we just appreciate vinegar or grilling it outside does not permeate the house with a cooking vinegar smell, but we think this is delicious as written and so easy. Definitely saved to favorites!

Do use a good quality balsamic as that will make a world of difference.  I used a very nice, aged balsamic from when I lived in Italy and it was fantastic.  I marinated this for 2 days and the hubby threw it on the grill; turned out fantastic with a great flavor!

I added a squirt of honey to the marinade as some had suggested.  It was very tasty but I had only marinated the pork two hours... I think doing it overnight would have been best.  Definitely line the roasting pan with aluminum foil as the video instructs.  There was a big sticky mess for me to clean up after dinner because I forgot to do this!

This is exactly what I look for on AR.com, quick, easy & versatile. This is a really good recipe as is, but there is So much space left on the canvas. Cooking is an art, use your imagination...you Love garlic...add garlic, add honey or whatever. I made this for the 2nd time & added a few extras. This is a Great marinade/sauce for many things. A warm potato salad, chicken, brushed on burgers, or anything on the grill...endless. Use Good balsamic & Good olive oil, it makes a huge difference. Also folks...learn the difference between a pork loin & a pork tenderloin. They are Not the same at all.

This pork loin tastes absolutely amazing! I cooked this a couple of nights ago for my family and they couldn't stop eating it... Here's my 3 special ingredients: 1. I used a high quality balsamic (MiaBella Balsamic Vinegar, got it from Amazon). 2. I used McCormick's Grill Mates - Smokehouse Maple steak rub. 3. I added a teaspoon of minced garlic, then put it all together in a plastic bag in the fridge and let it sit for a full 24 hours. Took it out two hours before cooking to allow it to get to room temperature then cooked it at 375 degrees (not 350), and it was done to perfection in 50 minutes (must use a meat thermometer). Incredibly tender and full of flavor. You will love it!

I judge recipes on whether my husband says he would it it again or not. When he says "I will eat it again" that means it is REALLY good. This recipe is delicious! I used really high quality balsamic vinegar the second time and made all the difference, other than that kept the recipe exactly the same.

I was blown away by the smell and flavour of this recipe. It is absolutely delicious. Followed the advice from other reviews, and added garlic to the marinade - couldn't be happier with the result. The meat came out moist and tender, and the flavour had seeped through into every bite. Perfection.

OMG this was good.  This is getting 5 stars because it is quick, easy & no hassle & taste high end.  We did add some garlic like others suggested & would agree to this.  We also marinated it overnight.  This was so juicy & wasn't strong on balsamic which I was afraid would happen.  A definite keeper.  This will be used often.

Simple and delicious recipe! This would be excellent as-is, but I added some chopped onion and minced garlic to the marinade because we are onion and garlic freaks.  Also I added some quartered fingerling potatoes and baby Portobello mushrooms to the baking dish as a side dish.  I used a half-way decent balsamic vinegar ($10ish for a bottle) and it was not overpowering at all. Everyone in my family loves this recipe!

Loved this recipe.  Made it about 5 days ago with a pork loin. Marinated it over night/actually for 24 hrs, and it was just so flavorful and awesome.   Yesterday I used the same basic balsamic recipe with little different mix of spices and marinated boneless chicken breast for 24 hrs and used it cut up for shish kebobs on the grill. YUM! Also cooked up two extra breasts and cut up into strips and froze in separate ziplocks and will take out to use on fresh green salads. No buying the pre-packaged cooked meats with extra junk in them.  .. This basic recipe can be switched up a bit with different spices and used in all kinds of meats!

This recipe turned out to be quite good. I used the proportions called for in the recipe but used balsamic fig vinegar and chipotle infused olive oil. It gave the meat a little spice. It was easy to prepare and the whole family loved it, including the grandkids. Oh, like some others, I put a layer of sliced onions in the pan and put the roast on top. The juice was delicious over potatoes. Will definitely make again.

Very disappointed after all the rave reviews. I incorporated all the various suggestions-overnight marinade, addition of honey and garlic, onions underneath. Most positive thing I can say is it was as tender as promised. However, the balsamic vinegar taste overwhelmed the pork. Family not impressed! 

Dinners on.

Marinated the pork tenderloins for about 2.5 hours using good quality balsamic. After pan searing the loins in an iron skillet, added sliced portobello mushrooms and a medium sweet onion cut in wedges. Finished it off in a 425 degree oven for about 15 minutes, turning once midway. YUMMMMMMY!!! This was so simple and very rewarding!

The price of the balsamic vinegar has a lot to do with how strong it is. However, you can use inexpensive balsamic vinegar by heating it to evaporate the acetic acid. You'll smell it if you're sensitive, so use your exhaust fan. I use "the cheap stuff" which I reduce by 1/3 then add back either water or rice wine vinegar for a milder flavor.

This is an incredibly good and simple recipe.  Key to this recipe is to use a good aged balsamic vinegar…one that has some body to it. My tenderloin was a little under 2lbs so was done in 45 mins and still a hint of pink in the middle. To the reviewer that cooked theirs for an hour and it was still "hard" I suspect you might have used a pork loin and not a tenderloin. To the reviewer that says you should never eat pork that is still pink…in this day an age pink (not rare) pork is perfectly safe and is much preferred  by many folks including me.

The longer you marinate, the stronger the vinegar taste will be. Just marinate for an hour or two and see if that makes a difference.

I made this with a larger roast- and it was great! I added some garlic and green onions as other suggested. I also made a gravy with the drippings- soooo good! The whole family loved it! I even made another one as a 'new mommy' meal for a friend.

I was nervous about this recipe while it was in the oven. The entire house smelled like the vinegar, so much so that I had to open a window. Once it was finished cooking, however, the taste was great. It was very moist and even my husband was surprised at how well it turned out. I was only able to marinate for 3 hours but it still took a good deal of the flavor.

I reviewed many pork tenderloin recipes and I decided to try only crushed garlic, evoo, kosher salt, and made two loins, one I added ahso sauce 20 min. after they were in the oven at 350° for a total of 1 hr. an 20 min. They came out incredibly moist and delicious, my bff loved them...can't thank everyone enough for your constant reviews...xo

I used the marinade on a pork tenderloin and it was delicious.  Moist, flavorful, easy, excellent.  I used 1 1/2 times the amounts because I like a lot of marinade.  I marinaded 8 hours since I always feel as if longer is better and I was religious about turning over every two hours.  It was great and I will definitely make again!  Very easy.

I marinated this with Wild tree Rancher Steak Rub, Wild tree Garlic Roasted Grape seed oil and generic balsamic for two hours. Baked on a rack within a pan. The exterior got blackened and crispy. Great, subtle flavor.

So simple but sooo good!  I used a very nice, satuma mandarin balsamic, made my own simple steak rub (1 part pepper, 1 part garlic powder, 4 parts kosher salt), and EVOO on a roast from a home raised hog.  The kids wanted another dish the day I planned this and, since they volunteered to cook, I let the roast marinate until the next day.  Cooked it in a glass pan at 350 degrees until the meat thermometer read 145 degrees.  Took it out, let it rest, and cut it - like butter.  I thought it might taste fairly tangy but no.  It was moist,  not too sweet, not too tangy.  It was deliciously flavorful but did not overwhelm the pork itself.  Perfecto!  The whole family loved it.  I will make this again and will try adding sliced onion, as others suggested, just for fun.

Very moist, extremely flavorful. My roast was a 2.75 lb boneless pork loin, had little to no fat. I also made a bed of sliced onions for the roast (not a necessary addition unless you like that sort of thing, MHO YUM!). Served with parsley buttered egg noodles and green beans with bacon and red onions. So pretty I took a picture! Like the old commercial ... "Try it you'll like it!"

I like pork loin, I like balsamic vinegar, so I thought I'd love this recipe. I read the reviewers' comments, and made sure that I used a high quality aged balsamic vinegar and didn't over marinate.  When it was baking, the smell was sharp/pungent and overwhelming, and I wished I was not in the house. The first time I opened the oven to ladle sauce over the loin, my eyes and nose burned. When my husband came home, he said, "What is that smell..I thought you were roasting pork loin?"

Fast forward to when it was served....it was tender, juicy and flavorful. Hated the smell, though..which is still pervasive throughout the house. Definitely not a dish I would make for company.

Delicious, easy, and FULL of flavor!  I used this same recipe on a couple of thick cut pork chops we had just hanging out in the freezer with no meal idea for them.  I cooked them at 350 for 10 min on each side.  I too added copious amounts of garlic.  They came out juicy, tender, and had such a nice flavor that even my salt loving husband added only a dash of ground sea salt to his!  Brava!

Gave it 5 stars due to it's simplicity and great taste. Did add 2 large crushed garlic cloves to marinade and added 2 sliced med onions to bottom of the pan before adding roast on top . The addition of the onions gives it added moisture and taste. If you use a decent quality balsamic vinegar, you shouldn't need to add any honey as some others have, otherwise I feel this would be too sweet. It's great as is!

I've made this recipe over a dozen times over the past couple of years. I always add 3 tablespoons of minced garlic and use Old Bay, rather than steak seasoning. It's always a big hit and a very easy meal to prepare, especially if you're hosting a dinner party and need to focus on other items, such as appetizers, side dishes, and deserts.  
I've found that cooking it in my convection microwave oven on "combo" cuts the cooking time to half and creates a beautiful brown color, while locking in the juices.  This also frees up the oven for other items that require different temperatures.

This is the perfect recipe to use with a Trader Joe's pork roast. The average TJs pork roast will feed 3 or 4 adults for one night, or a couple adults for a good 2 nights. This marinade is so quick and delicious. I like to mix it in a measuring cup and just pour it into a large Ziploc with the roast in the morning, then it's ready to go into the oven as soon as I get home from work. Comes out nice and juicy, perfectly done. If I'm out of steak seasoning I just get creative with ground peppers and spices! It's always good!

This was wonderful! I am in the process of making it a second time.  The only change that I made was to cut the marinade recipe in half.  It definitely does not need a whole cup of marinade for a roast this size.  Our 2 pound roast fit perfectly in a 1 quart Ziplock bag.  I put the roast in, then poured in the marinade (which was 1/4 cup of EVOO & 1/4 cup balsamic marinade plus 1 T steak seasoning) squeezed out the air and zipped it up.  I used Costco steak seasoning which was too salty for us when used alone on a steak but when mixed with the balsamic vinegar and oil it was perfect! I am also delighted to find a way to use it up too.

The marinade was very good on the meat.  My suggestion to those who might use the marinade to roast accompanying vegetables is to use a fairly mild steak spice.  Otherwise, the marinade can overpower the great natural flavours of roasted vegetables.  I roasted potatoes, carrots, parsnips, beets, brussel sprouts and onions with the meat and it was a great meal and only the roasting pan to clean up!

Great recipe but waste of time marinating it or marinating anything since whatever you're marinating does not absorb the marinade.  Best to just cook it and either baste it while cooking or pour the marinade over the meat after it's cooked.  Read more about marinating to be better informed.

This dish absolutely lives up to its billing.  It is wonderfully moist and flavorful, not to mention easy to prepare.  With a high quality balsamic it neither smells like vinegar nor tastes like vinegar.  After reading a number of the reviews I chose a black cherry balsamic to enhance the flavor of the pork and used Rub with Love steak rub.  Also from reading the reviews I decided to try making a sauce with the drippings.  I made something up using the go-to sauce base my grandmother used:  1/3 cup brown sugar and 2 tsp. corn starch.  To prepare the sauce I skimmed off some of the fat from the drippings, added the remaining drippings to a sauce pan and brought them to a boil.  In a separate dish I combined the brown sugar and corn starch until well mixed.  Once the drippings were boiling, remove from the heat and slowly stir in the brown sugar and corn starch mixture until thickened.  The sauce with the black cherry flavor was delicious and wonderful for each guest to add to their taste at the table.  Next time, I might add a few fresh black cherries...but then again maybe not.  This dish was simply amazing and enjoyed by all!

I made this last night using a very aged balsamic I save for special dishes.  It made it a little too sweet for me so next time I will use my regular balsamic.  I don't use steak seasoning so I added my own spices.  I had to add additional liquid to the pan so used white wine and then made gravy while the roast rested.  I also added a large onion cut in wedges to the marinade and roasted them with the roast.  Everything was delicious and my husband loved it.  Served with fresh mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.
Always use a good aged balsamic, the cheap stuff isn't worth it.  However the more aged it is the sweeter it gets!

Made this recipe last night and it definitely is a keeper.  I did add some garlic and thick sliced onions which I served as a bed for the meat.  Served with thick noodles and carrots.  Will definitely make again.  Babci4

i used apple cider vinegar instead of balsamic. the roast was not that tender and the carrot that i tossed into the pan, tasted like vinegar. i dont think using balsamic would have made it taste less vinegary. i use the pan drippings to make gray, which in this case made it taste like vinegar as well. would not make again

This was good but it wasn't a show stopper for me.  I didn't find the roast to be incredibly moist or so good I couldn't stop eating it as some posters mentioned. It was adequately moist and good enough for me to enjoy my portion. I followed the recipe exactly using montreal steak seasoning, marinating overnight and felt it needed some sweet to counter the acidity of the balsamic. So, if i try this again i will add honey and tweak the other seasonings possibly adding wine and fresh herbs to the marinade.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. The 2nd time I made it I reduced the rub to about 1/2 - a bit spicy for us. It was great. If it is to vinegery for you, just reduce the balsamic and increase the olive oil just a bit to your tastes.

It is so important to chose the right balsamic vinegar....If you use a well-seasoned (costs more and is more sugary/less acidulous) the result is excellent.  My variant doesn't change the flavor that much but seals in the juices before roasting and gives a much more attractive presentation.  Same ol' prep with the resealable bag, and one SMALL crushed garlic clove (don't overdo it, folks), and a half tsp of erbes de Provence (the thyme and rosemary enhance and give structure to the balsamic vinegar) without overpowering the delicacy of the roast.  Hey, if you can't get that SUPER aceto balsamico from Modena (it's 20 minutes from Bologna where I live) add a tbsp of brown sugar or honey to the marinade.... that works, too.  THEN!!!!  Before you put it in the roasting pan and in the oven, brown that dude on all sides in some hot olive oil and one tbsp butter (don't let it smoke!!!)  to seal in the goodies.  Try it, you'll like it...  It becomes a 5 star PLUS if you poke a dozen or so whole cloves in the upper surface.  While it's cooking, I can assure you that you won't be tempted to throw it out for the smell of vinegar!!  If the doorbell rings it's one of the neighbors who wants to know what you're cooking. :-)

I have never made a pork loin but love recipes that are simple.  Since I read this recipe late I let it marinate over night came home from work and popped in. It was the best!!!  Aroma was vinegarest  and toast !? But pleasant. It was one of the best meals I have made this fall season.

I didn't have enough balsamic so I added a little apple juice.  I also added honey.  Roasted it with onion, carrots and celery and added chopped apple during the last 20 minutes of cooking.  Served it with mashed potatoes and corn.  I was moist and delish.  My Hubs was still talking about it 3 days later.

My husband is a big fan of Balsamic vinegar and he really enjoyed this recipe. I used Montreal Steak Seasoning as suggested by another reviewer. It was just a little too salty; I think I will reduce the steak seasoning by a teaspoon or so next time I make this. The recommended cooking temperature of 145 degrees was perfect. The roast was moist and flavorful.

We have had this dish two times and it has become a quick family favorite.  I found the flavors wonderful and the meat tender and juicy by following the directions.  I used Montreal Steak seasoning as my dry rub and it was fantastic!

The cook time made the pork dry but the sauce made it edible.

I used 4 "chops", not thick but large lengthwise and it turned out great.  The steak seasoning I used was a rub and is the "Outback" recipe, or so they claim.  I have not used it on steak yet and the recipe mix makes exactly 2 TBSP of rub.

Someone else said to use a good quality of Balsamic Vinegar which I believe mine is fine, Pompeian.  The taste was mild and balanced and very easy to make.

I made this for my boyfriend's bday and we both LOVED it. I followed the recipe exactly and just added chopped onions and carrots to the pan. Then I made mashed potatoes and used the balsamic sauce as a gravy. Soooooo good! It took me about an hour and 20 min to get to 145 though. My only complaint is that you don't want to trim fat from the raw pork loin so that it will flavor and moisten it while cooking, but then there seemed to be so much fat to cut away from the slices on my plate. That hungry fool just ate every bite of his though!

I followed the recipe as is. I cannot get steak seasoning where I live so I made my own. That is the only thing I did differently. I marinated it for two hours due to timing but I bet this would be even better if left to marinate over night.

My husband barely got seconds as our three kids were literally scarfing it down. He thought there might be some left for a 'midnight snack' - not a chance. 

Each of the kids (2 girls, 8 &10 and boy, 5) asked for it again. I served it with potatoes and carrots and a loaf of Italian bread.

Very delicious! Hubby, baby, and myself all enjoyed it. Used a mesquite steak seasoning blend which turned out quite nicely. Only reason it didn't get the 5th star is because it took longer to cook, and needed a little something like honey for sweetness. Will make again with adjustments.

Simple to make and my daughter, who hates meat, loved it! I used A1 Original steak seasoning, marinated for about 4 hours, and baked fat side up. Served with Brussels sprouts, carrots, and garlic mashed potatoes.

My 15 year-old made this at my instruction. She was complaining about the smell of the balsamic vinegar the whole time, (I CANNOT even get her to try it with oil on bread.) BUT she LOVED the roast and GOBBLED IT UP!!

I have tried several recipes for roasted pork loin.  This one is the best!  I did use a good quality balsamic.  Served it for a large family gathering.  Even my seven year old grandson said "Grammy, this meat is really good!" -  and I don't hear that from him often!  Easy and delicious!  Will add this to my favorites!

It was truly very good. The smell and taste of the vinegar was not overpowering at all. I did add garlic and some honey to the marinade. I baked my pork at 375 for 1 hour and it came out very juicy and perfectly cooked. However, the best thing was the onions on the bottom of the pan that cooked in the marinade but they were not even a part of the recipe...

My family loves this marinade on pork!  We even put it on pork chops before cooking them either in a skillet or on the grill after marinating for only about 10 minutes. Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this last night for dinner and it turned out delicious with only the minimum 2 hours of marinating time.  I didn't change a thing and followed the recipe exactly as is.  Instead of roasting in the oven, I grilled it on the BBQ.  Fantastic!  Thanks for posting a super easy and delicious recipe!

This was very tasty! Nice strong flavors from the steak seasoning with a slight tang from the balsamic vinegar. I used 1 packet of 'McCormick Grill Mates Montreal Steak seasoning' and marinated for 12 hours. And I used boneless pork chops instead of a whole pork loin. I thickened the sauce by making a slurry using 2 Tbls. dry red wine with 2 Tbls. cornstarch. It worked perfectly and I think it needed it. The red wine complemented the sauce perfectly. I think I'll try this recipe with chicken cutlets next time! A great easy recipe!

No one really cared for these. It may have been that I ended up cooking mine in the crock pot but the flavor was a bit off for my family. And the steak seasoning was way over powering. I added chunks of potatoes to the pot, as there was room and it sounded good. This just wasn't for us. Thanks though.

I made this for Easter dinner, exactly as written and it turned out great! I tripled everything since we had a crowd and it was a cinch to make.  I used a meat thermometer and pulled it out at 140 degrees. It wasn't over done or anything but next time I make it, I'll pull it out at 135 degrees.  I will be making it again.  Thank you!!

This was a good recipe, although I deviated from the original a bit. I want to preface by saying remember pork can be a little pink inside. I chopped some celery to use as a "heat buffer" in the bottom of my roaster pan (instead of glass dish). Carrots, celery, and apples make great buffers. I also put a cup of stock in the bottom of the pan and tented the roast for the first 35 minutes of cooking. It was uncovered for the next 35, totaling 1hr 10 minutes. Tender, flavorful, will do this again.

Tried this last night with some of the changes reviewers suggested.  Here's what I did:  Marinated for four hours,followed marinade recipe but added a tablespoon or so of honey, added potatoes and carrots.  What I would do different:  We like balsamic vinegar so I would leave out the honey as it took away alot of the tang.  If I added anything I would add molasses instead (trust me - really great flavor), waaaaay to much oil and I cut it to 1/3 C; otherwise it smothers the balsamic flavor.  I don't think it needs more than 1/4C at most.  Forgot to add the sliced onions (duh) and they are a must (delicious in balsamic)so won't forget next time, would marinate overnight for more flavor, make potatoes very small and carrots sliced (not chunked)as they don't cook in an open pan in one hour. Lastly, I didn't have time to make a gravy with the juices and there was alot of juice.  That would have added flavor to the meat and veggies.  This is a great starter recipe and I think you just have to fiddle with the marinade depending on how much you like balsamic vinegar and definitely use good stuff.  The cheap stuff or old vinegar can get too vinegar-y and balsmic should be sweet enough to eat from a spoon.

This was all right.  I marinated it about 6 hours.  I think it would be better if it was marinated longer.  It has a great flavor and seasoning on the outside of the roast.  I'm not sure the cooking instructions are the best.  I cooked it exactly as written.  I took it out after one hour and it was 145 degrees.  It rose to about 160 upon sitting.  When I cut it, the middle was a bit rare and the ends were dry.  Not a terrific result, but the family ate it with very few leftovers, and it was very easy. (I think pork loin is too lean to be reliably moist every time so I wouldn't blame the recipe for this.)

RIDICULOUSLY DELICIOUS! I read many, but not all reviews. I too follow recipes to the letter the first time. And if you don't, you should submit your own recipe because you're not rating the true recipe. I make it as written first, then if I make chages, I note accordingly, but only and always after I've tried it as written first. That said, I've made this twice now. The first time, exactly as written. Beautifully delicious and because of income constraints, used store brand balsamic. When I opened the oven door to check temp, I was overwhelmed a bit with the vinegar vapors, as was the downstairs. DO NOT let this stop you or even more stupidly, throw out a perfectly good roast. It does NOT taste like a vinegar concoction. It reduces to a seductively delicious roast. The second time I did add two finely chopped minced garlic cloves to the marinade. I was out of olive oil, so used Wesson. Out of steak seasoning so used Cavander's Greek. And I rough chopped an onion to create a bed upon which to place the roast. STILL amazing! Biggest key: We like a pink center so I don't cook it beyond 145 degrees. Forget time and use an instant read thermometer. This recipe will impress! Thank you, Melissa!

This was just okay. I also didn't enjoy the vinegar aspect, although upon reading other reviews it may be because my bottle had been open and in the fridge for a while. Next time I would reduce the balsamic and add the honey like others have suggested. I didn't notice that at first so I only added the honey half way through cooking, although I did add chopped garlic and white onion to the sauce during baking. Still was good, but I'd make it a bit sweeter if I made it again. Pork was a little under done at 145 degrees (1 hour). Okay for heating the middle as leftovers the next day though, so it doesn't dry out so much. If you're eating it in one sitting I'd cook it a smidge longer.

Very easy.  I marinated pork tenderloins overnight and baked in the oven until it came to temp.  My company wanted to know why it tasted so good.

I added about 1/2 tbsp minced garlic but otherwise followed exactly.  A bit hit - even with the kids.  Will definitely make this again.

I rarely give anything a 5* rating, but this one is super. I used a single packet of McCormick Grill Mates Garlic-Herb-Wine marinade and added 1.5 Tbsp granulated garlic [hate vampires! ;-)]. I scored the loin *very* deeply in an 1" (approx) crosshatch pattern square to the long access of the loin, leaving only the bottom 1 to 1.5" uncut. I filled the cuts with marinade and put directly into the oven. I'm certain allowing the marinade to seep into the meat would make this about a 5.5 recipe. This is *THE BEST* pork roast I've ever had, in fact the first one I've ever truly enjoyed. This has elevated pork roast from an occasional, obligatory, barely tolerable, alternative protein dish to a frequent, First Class, flier.

This was wonderful! Hubby hates vinegar. He never knew it was there. I scraped the bottom of the pan, added a little more olive oil and white wine in a pan. Heated, adding a little flour through a small sifter (to avoid lumps). Add a little salt and pepper and this dish goes from delicious to company worthy. Good, inexpensive and tasty.

This was a super easy to put together and to cook.  Pair it with roasted red potatoes or baked, a bagged salad and it's a super easy quick mid-week meal.

YES you will smell vinegar while the roast cooks, my teenage daughter on smelling vinegar but don't freak out! The results are so good! Teenage son ate 4 helpings and couldn't stop talking about it.  All the rest of the family had at least 2 helpings.

I was willing to try this after reading the reviews, although my daughter doesn't like most pork roasts or pork chops.  I will mention that when it says a glass baking dish, it must mean a smaller one!  I marinated mine beginning in the morning, using steak seasoning I bought at Aldi's.  It WAS great!  Even the non-pork roast eating daughter liked it, her boyfriend loved it!  I thought it was tasty myself.  After feeding 3 adults and a toddler, there was just enough left to pack my daughter's boyfriend lunch!  I served it with the Butter Pecan Sweet Potato recipe I got from Pinterest, which was also a hit, stewed cabbage, and crispy cornbread cakes.  Yummy!

I'm adding this 18 months or so after trying it the first time.  My family still loves it and looks forward to eating it.  I'm not sure how it turned out dry for anyone, but keep in mind that the author shows it in a small glass dish for roasting, looks like an 8 x 8 or 9 x 9, I think that affects how much marinade you have at the end.  We're eating it tonight with some roasted sweet potatoes and creamed spinach!  FYI, I usually forget to baste it and it's still juicy!

AMAZING!!!! I have never left a review for a recipe on here before but I felt I had to in this case. Everyone loved this roast at my house today! I had a larger roast not a loin, I made a rub using a mixture of season salt and brown sugar and rubbed it liberally all over the roast and then seared it on all sides. I then placed it in a glass dish and dumped the balsamic/olive oil and vinegar mixture on top and roasted it at 350 covered with foil for two hours. After about two hours I dumped in some baby carrots and added a little brown sugar on top and let it cook for about 30 more minutes. Let it rest for a few and then slice, best roast Ive ever made!

This was delicious!  The only thing I did differently, was to follow a review and do a little less oil.  The meat was perfect and my husband and four kids all loved it.  I also added quartered onions and that was wonderful.  Next time I will probably add red bell peppers too, or whatever veggies I have on hand.

This is a great easy recipe; I was afraid it was going to taste like vinegar, but that was not the case at all. I had it marinating for about 6 hours. The roast came out very moist and tender. I will definitely make this again.

Turned out great! Cooked a 3.5lb loin for 1.5 hours basted it once half way through. The only thing I might change next time is to reduce the olive oil. I think it would be good without it and would make it slightly lighter in calories. I used my drippings to sautée potatoes, carrots and onion in a pan on the stove.

I was looking for a new recipe for pork loin and found this one.  I was a little hesitant at first only because I have four teenage sons and none of them actually like Balsamic dressing for salads but I did try it out.  I used Montreal steak spice and added a little Rosemary to the marinade.  Amazingly all four of my sons liked it enough that they want it again next week.  Thank you for the recipe.

This is SO easy and so tasty.  My husband raved about it!  (That's not normal!)
Super simple.  Like trying different spices since I don't use or have steak seasoning! I agree that garlic is great with this.

Wonderful sweet flavor with savory highlights IF you use a decent balsamic vinegar. I used Colavita (about $3 at WM) and it turned out great. TIP: use a salt free steak seasoning since pork is naturally a bit salty. My inlaws and my kids all loeved this.

I would have given this 5 stars but I think there is way too much oil.  I'll make this again, for sure because it was delicious and everyone around the table raved about it.  Next time I'll just cut the oil back to a 1/4 cup.  Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe.

When I went to make this, I only had 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar so had to use 1/4 cup red wine vinegar as well.  I marinated it overnight. If I make again, I would actually cut the olive oil to 1/4 cup.  I may try again and cook in a crock pot or use a tenderloin.  I thought it was a little salty but that was from the steak seasoning I used.

I don't have steak seasoning so I subbed with Mc Cormick's Grill Mates Montreal Chicken Seasoning and rubbed it on the meat and then added the marinade and let it marry overnight till dinnertime.  Tried it with pork tenderloin 2lbs. My 1st time making this. Results, amazing!

2nd time I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and grilled it. Great too!  I did splash some more balsamic vinaigrette (Newman's Own Lite) near the end of grilling.  I prefer the oven because it's more flavorful with pan juices for basting.   3rd time I used 4 1/2 lbs pork loin and used original marinade and let it marry for 48 hours.  Oven roasted the pork loin with marinade and made a gravy with the juices.  Got rave reviews on the gravy especially (from the marinade and not discarding it but cooking it with the pork) also the pork was so tender. Fussy eater said he wants the marinade recipe and my gravy that was from the marinade.  Just added cornstarch, water and salt as needed for the gravy using the juices & whisk in till desired gravy consistency.  Eyeball it.  Highest compliments ever!  Thank you.

This turned out amazing- very moist! I took suggestions from 3 different reviews, I added honey and fresh garlic to the marinade and it was amazing. Also, half way through cooking I added diced baby red potatoes. Once the meat was done I took that out and added a couple other seasonings to the potatoes and let them finish cooking for 10 minutes. I will make this again and again!

I have done this recipe several times now, the pork loin is so moist and tender with an absolutely savory taste! One time I did not have enough Balsamic vinegar and finished the amount off with white vinegar. Still a fantasitic recipe everyone loved! Definately a keeper in my household!

I made this last night. While cooking, the aroma of vinegar was almost overwhelming. Both my husband and I were a little worried. As it turned out, the loin roast was very tender and very yummy. There was no over powering taste of vinegar at all. The only thing different I did was cook it for 15 more minutes to obtain an internal temp of 155, then let it rest for 10 minutes to reach 165. The whole thing was cooked to perfection.

Wonderful way to serve a pork loin or tenderloin.  Just as good cold, sliced and served with Dijon mustard.  Used 1/3 cup balsamic vinegar.  First time marinated 2+ hours - excellent,  2nd time, marinated overnight and did not like the strong balsamic vinegar flavor.

I added chopped onions when baking and scooped them onto the sliced meat when serving.  Turned out great!  The onions really soaked up the balsamic vinegar for a tangy flavor.

Fantastic! I used Trader Joe's balsamic vinegar, Costco's Kirkland steak seasoning & 4 smashed garlic cloves on a 2-1/2 pound boneless pork loin roast. Not vinegary even after 2 days of marinating. Thanks for this recipe. It was PERFECT!

Made one involuntary change....Didn't have any steak seasoning so I used roasted garlic montreal chicken seasoning instead.  Made one voluntary change..added about two tbsp of honey.  Turned out fantastic.  Wife loved it.

pretty = many like the sauce that I cooked down.  Used cheaper balsamic and needed to add honey to it to take off the bite of the vinegar.  Next time add a little salt and a little garlic.  Made about a 5 pound roast with 1 1/2 times recipe and it was sufficient.  Cooked it down a little and served on the side.

On a whim, used my immersion blender on the marinade (I had to hide the garlic I added!) then marinated overnight. The result was a nice crust on the pork loin with the same great flavor of the original.

Delicious!  Nice simple recipe with great results.  I used 4 precut pork loins and only marinaded it about 90 minutes due to timing.  I'd love to try this next time with the full overnight marinade.

Great reciepe,i changed it up a bit. Used 1/3 cup balsamic vinger, 1/3 cup of white wine, 1tbsp of honey,1/2 cup of olive oil, my own chicken seasoning with paprika, two sprigs of rosemary, and 1/4 cup of brown sugar marinaded it over night.  Preheated the oven to 350, cut of potatoes,carrots and sweet potatoes and two big onions. Placed the onions on the bottom as suggested in several reviews, placed the roast ovet the onions and the potatoes around the outside of the roast and the carrots on top. Cooked it for one hour then tuned down to 325 for another hour. Removed the meat and the vegs and made gravy with the drippingfrom the roadt. Thanks foreveryones help, it came out great!

We really, really loved this with roasted potatoes and roasted asparagus. We poured the balsamic reduction right over all three. My only issue is that there's so much leftover olive oil I wound up using the ziploc bag trick to strain it out so we didn't wind up eating it - yick. I feel that you could get away with manually rubbing the roast down with oil and then just using 2 TB in the marinade. Granted I haven't tried it that way, so perhaps that's a terrible idea, but it's what I'm going to try next time. Thanks for the recipe, we absolutely licked our plates, the sauce was so good! P.S. I used Penzey's "Chicago Steak Seasoning" mix for the steak rub.

I have never rated before, but I had to here. This pork was AMAZING! This is the first pork roast I have ever made. I marinaded the night before after poking the entire roast with a fork. My boyfriend raved!! This will definitely be on our dinner rotation!

I literally JUST finished eating this and it was so very delicious, I had to review it!  Even my 2 year old asked for 3rd's!  I did take the suggestion of adding onions to the bottom of the pan before cooking, they were quite tasty!   The dish was definitely vinegary but I love vinegar so I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED it!

Per other reviews, I lessoned the vinegar to 1/3 c and added 1/4 c honey. Smoked on charcoal grill for 30 min and finished in oven (350) for another 30-45 min. Delicious!

So simple yet so delicious! After I marinated the roast I put it in a clay baking dish along with the marinade. I poured corn syrup over the top and then baked for approx 1 hr., 15 minutes; it should reach an internal temp of 160 degrees F. It was fantastic - so moist and tasty! This is definitely a Keeper recipe!

Awesome! I used balsamic vinaigrette instead of balsamic vinegar because that's all I had and it turned out amazing!!! I basted (poured sauce in pan over pork with spoon) every 10-15 min. Awesome, simple, easy.

I love this recipe. It is simple and delicious. It has become a staple in our house. 
I buy a large pork loin and slice up a few steaks for one meal. Then the rest I use for this recipe  and have a wonderful gourmet dinner and the leftovers are used for sandwiches the next day.
Thanks for the great recipe!

What a great technique! What an easy way to prepare a lovely meal!! I didn't have steak seasoning on hand, so I just threw the vinegar, oil, roast and some other seasonings in a bag...plus minced garlic...and threw the whole thing in the fridge. As a busy mom and caregiver to my mother, I simply don't have time to make complicated meals but I want to feed my family good food at a good price. This fit the bill. I loved taking the entire contents out of the bag and throwing it in a glass dish in the oven. Great tip on basting too. When I baked it, I added thyme and rosemary, which I think pair well with pork.

My one suggestion would be to find a way to balance the tang of the vinegar, so as one reviewer mentioned, I might try a little honey next time. I could see adding a little honey and mustard glaze before baking as well. I do think marinating with the vinegar worked like a charm. This was the most tender pork roast I've made in ages. Next time I might also stop roasting a little earlier and do a final broil to create a crust. But the taste and tenderness made up for the crust I usually like.

As far as application, not only is this a lovely roast (which I served with couscous and broccoli) but it also makes for a phenomenal sandwich! Hubby came home late and enjoyed it on a kaiser roll. I look forward to using it in a sandwich I adore with basil mayo and havarti. Yum.

This dish is wonderful, and so easy to do!  I used Montreal Steak seasoning.  I agree with others that it's key to use good quality balsamic vinegar.  This came out  tender and delicious.  Excellent recipe - thanks for sharing it.

Very good, and very easy.  An excellent meal for a work day.  Made exactly as written.  I did cover with foil while resting because I wasn't sure when we were going to sit down to eat and I am a little uncomfortable with any pink in pork.  Was perfect after sitting for about 20 minutes or so.

So good!  I didn't have any specific "steak rub," so I used some Kona coffee rub that is particularly good on pork.  It turned out AMAZING.  My husband and I were dipping our bread in the balsamic goodness...I think the leftovers (there wasn't much leftover) will become pork sandwiches.  Definitely a winner!!

I had to review this recipe (I usually don't) because this was so EASY and GOOD.  I made it exactly as the directions indicated and it was perfect.  Very tasty.  My husband loves that steak seasoning stuff.  I only tolerate it, but it was great in this recipe.  I used McCormick's Montreal Steak.  
Also as another reviewer mentioned, use good balsamic vinegar!  I think it makes a difference!

I made a large, 5 lb pork loin roast so had to cook longer...about 1 1/2 hours.  After about 45 min., I sliced a Vidalia onion and roasted w/ it and added some ginger jam to the sauce.  I steamed some carrots and sugar snap peas and then mixed in w/ the sauce after it was done.  I think it is ready when temp. reads 140 b/c 145 overcooked it a little.  It was delicious and will make it again.

This was pretty good, but although I cooked it until the internal temp was 158, it was still a little pink in the middle after marinating for 2 days. It was a little disturbing. I shredded it and slow-cooked it in broth for 4 hours and used it for French dip sandwiches, which we all enjoyed. I prefer another recipe, but I was glad to try this. Thanks for posting!

HUGE HIT with my large family.  I sliced my pork loin into 1 inch slices, marinated them in a ziploc back with the ingredients for a couple hours and grilled them.  They are still singing my praises

very tasty. I let it sit overnight and it tasted wonderful. I took an idea from pioneer woman and seared it in a cast iron skillet first and then put the skillet in the oven, and cooked it for 30 minutes.

It was good.  Usually I serve the sauce over veggies/rice but I wouldn't in this case because the sauce is too sharp.  Flavors the meat nicely, but definitely wouldn't eat it if you are not a fan of balsamic vinegar (flavor is very strong).

one of the best pork roasts I have ever tasted.   The balsamic was a very prominent smell while it was cooking but was not overpowering at all in the taste.  May try different vinegars with it sometime but am a big fan of balsamic so may take me awhile!

Thank you for a good, simple, flexible recipe!  I didn't have enough balsamic vinegar so I used balsamic vinegar and sherry vinegar.  I also used some garlic flavored olive oil.  My pork loin was much smaller so it didn't require a very long cooking time.  Make sure you consider this when planning...you don't want to overcook this yummy pork loin!  I served it with roasted butternut squash.

Fantastic!  The only thing I do is add a tablespoon of garlic powder to the marinade since we love garlic.  This is one of my favorite meals now and I cook it at least every couple of weeks.

This was great!We had this for second Christmas day dinner and had guests and it was gone in no time!!We tried two different pork loin recipes,combined about 2 kg of meat and it was almost completely gone so a huge success!!!  Only thing we changed next time(we made it again on New years) was adding a bit less vinegar cause it was a little bit overpowering for us the first time around!!But this recipe is great,and the meat comes out moist and tender and delicious!

My family and I enjoyed this so much! I also cooked up some pasta and green beans, and used some of the meat juices from the bottom of the pan with lemon juice to sauce the pasta. Easy, fabulous dinner.

Soooooo yummy!  Second time making it this month.  I used Montreal Steak Seasoning and don't change a thing.  Turns out moist every time.  I make a gravy with the drippings.  I separate the fat out and then add a can of chicken broth with a T. or so of corn starch.  Serve the gravy over the meat and I also make mashed potatoes too!  Even my 3 year old eats this dish and she is picky, picky, picky!

Was a little skeptic, because my husband is picky.  Used Kraft balsamic vinegar salad dressing with aged parmesian  cheese.  This made it not so vinegar and he loves parmesian cheese.  No leftovers for this dish!!!

I followed the recipe as it is written. I only marinated for 2 hours because that is all the time I had. The flavor was strong, but I still might try marinating it longer next time to see how the flavor changes. It took just under an hour to cook. The meat was moist and tender. The flavor was pretty good, but I think next time I will try 1/3 cup of vinegar and oil.  It seemed a little heavy for my tastes. The quality of the flavor relies a lot on what kind of steak seasoning you use. If you don't quite dig it the first time, try using a different kind of seasoning. I definitely enjoyed this dish. I will most likely make it again.

I just used the same inredients in a small portion on my pork chop and baked it in my toaster oven on 350 for about 15 minutes or so. Pretty good with the parmesan rosemary polenta recipe from this site.

Very delicious! I added a small amount of brown sugar to balance out the acidity/sour flavor of the vinegar and a little bit of fresh ground pepper and rosemary. I spooned the sauce over the slices, as in the photo and served with roasted rosemary potatoes and pearl onions, steamed asparagus topped with a little lemon,butter and Parmesan. Fabulous!

We cut the pork loin into 1/2 inch chops before marinating and then barbecued them. Wow! Tender and sooooo tasty!!  We used Costco's Kirkland balsamic vinegar and Montreal Steak seasoning.  Excellent for the grill.  We served it to 25 people and everyone raved about it!

Made this recipe for company and it was excellent. Cooked it on the grill at high heat for about 15 min. then very slowly on the upper rack - very tender and moist.  We all loved it.  I added a package of gravy mix to the marinate to make gravy - was good on the meat but too strong for potatoes.

Sorry, I didn't much care for the flavor of this recipe.  I have a ton of pork loin / pork tenderloin recipes that call for baking in the oven, and after seeing the 354+ reviews for this one, I figured I needed to try it out.  I was disappointed with the flavor - just seemed kind of funky...

Excellent!  One of the best pork loin recipes I've made.  One hour for a 2lb roast though, is WAY too long if you don't like it overcooked.  I used one hour for a 4lb roast and it was overcooked.

Next time I'm going to add a brown sugar glaze for the last two hours of cooking to cut the vinegar. Be forwarned that the cooking process does NOT produce an appetite-inducing smell in the house.

This pork loin came out perfect.  I let it marinate about 4 hours.  Very easy to make! It was was juicy and tasty!  Followed the recipe to the T but didn't have steak rub so made my own with Kosher Salt, Black Pepper, Paprika. garlic powder and onion powder.  This is definitely a keeper.

The pork loin had great flavor but the marinade disappeared in the pan....leaving nothing to baste the meat with and an impossible to clean pan.  Also, I used a 1 1/2 pound loin and it took well over an hour to fully cook.

I was really worried about it because I didn't read the review about cheap vinegar until it was too late and all I had was the great value brand.  I used Grill Creations steak dust instead of rub and I added a tsp of garlic powder.  I put it on the grill instead of the oven as to not take the chance of making my house smell like vinegar.  Also in the last 5-10 min I put about a 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of hot water together and basted the roast with it.  It was EXCELLENT, my whole family loved it and I didn't even get the smallest taste of vinegar, just a real good flavor throughout and really juicy, the wife says this definitely goes in the reciepe box.

I really could not believe it tasted as good as it did with such few ingredients.  I loved the unique taste of the sauce, and will try this with chicken as well.  If looking for something different - instead of the same old, same old... this is a great recipe to try.

I have been looking for a recipe like this to make Balsamic Chicken. This was very good. But I did take it one step further. I put the juices from the roast, actually the store didn't have a roast so I used thin loin chops, and 4 pork chops instead. I marinated in a freezer bag and then stacked them in the baking dish. When they were done baking, I then poured the juices into a frying pan, and added sliced portobello mushrooms. That simmered and reduced until much of the juices had caramelized on the bottom of the pan. I added flour, a tablespoon or so, and some water, continuing to simmer until I had a light gravy. The gravy was excellent over mashed potatoes, but could also have it over garlic mashed potatoes.

This was SOOOO yummy!  I made it exactly to the recipe directions and it was really easy!  I used Grill Creations Kansas City Style steak seasoning, marinated about 3 hours and cooked at 350 for a little over an hour because my roast was about 2 and 1/2 pounds.  It was not only yummy but the marinade poured over the top before cooking gave it a beautiful textured appearance when I took it out of the oven.  It was little too salty for our taste so I'll probably cut back on the steak seasoning next time.

AWESOME.  Great marinade.  For the steak seasoning, I used Trader Joe's 'Spices of the World' 21 SEASONING SALUTE. It is salt free and all natural.  As the label suggests, it contains 21 different spices & is far better than Emerils (spicy) or Montreals (too salty) and less expensive.  I reduced the balamic vinegar to a little less than 1/2 cup.  That is the only change I made. Turned out fantastic  I do have a suggestion.  It would be helpful if the recipe named the type of pork loin roast tp use.   Pork loin comes in various 'cuts' & some can be very 'dry'.  There is boneless center cuts (too dry), outside & inside loin cuts,  pork loin 'sirloin', and tenderloin.  The butcher suggested the boneless 'inside' pork loin roast.  Very tender and flavorful.  With the exception of 'tenderloin', this is the best pork loin roast we have enjoyed.  Will definitely make this again.

This was outstanding!  I put it in a crock pot with my partially frozen pork roast, first putting a layer of onions on the bottom.  I loved it, my family loved it and my Care Group raved!!!  I didn't have steak rub, so I used steak seasonings--worked perfectly!  The gravy was delicious, also!  A definite have-again-soon!

this was so simple and GREAT! the meat tasted so moist and just the perfect amount of seasoning.  I also added a teaspoon of minced garlic in the marinade.  And only had an hour to let it marinate and it still had great flavor!

I have never marinated before, and was extremely happy with how great this turned out.  I didn't bake them, but instead grilled them.  They tasted GREAT!!  I couldn't even taste the vinegar.

As a balsamic vinegar fan, I thought this was yummy.  There was a lot of the marinade left in the pan.  Since  the marinade was simmering while the loin was roasting, I felt it safe to make a gravy out of it.  The gravy was very flavorful and the perfect with the loin.

I thought this recipe was definitely a keeper! I followed the recipe almost to the letter, only adding about 1 t of garlic powder.  Did not taste at all "vinegary".  I grilled on med heat for about 25 mins, let it rest for another 5 and it was cooked perfectly.  Moist, tender, flavorful.

This was the first time I ever used balsamic vinegar in anything,altho I had a bottle for just in case I ever needed it.  When my family walked in the house,they asked what smelled so good.  They found out at dinner time!  The meat was fork tender and the taste-delicious.  Thanks for the recipe and now,my favorite recipe.

I made this with a 1kg loin cut in half and halved the recipe. Marinated the night before. The olive oil seized up in my fridge to form a yellow solid paste but this was ok. I thought I could cook it half the time with it being half the size, but no. It was still raw in the middle after 40 minutes, I guess because of the thickness. Anyways, it didn't have any great flavor, the middle part which was still tender was good but the outsides were overcooked. I won't make this again.

This is very tasty when first made.  It's just my husband and me, so we nearly always have leftovers.  I always reheat roast at low temperature to keep it from drying out, but this just didn't have as good a flavor the second time.  That's the reason I gave it  4 stars.

Have made this twice once as the recipe is written and once using Teriyaki seasoning and canola oil (is what I had on hand at the time).  Both turned out perfect.  Used Ginger Ale & H20, instead of white wine to keep the pan sauce moist. Gravy turned out excellent!

All I can say is WOW!!! My only addition was minced garlic. I also let it marinade IN the baking dish overnight, and popped it in the oven the next day!!! Don't forget to use ALL of the drippings for gravy, and let it rest for 30 minutes...unbelievable!

Good flavor.  Tender.  Next time I'll use a cooking bag; marinade gets messy in the oven.

Great!  I made this beforehand and left the bag in the freezer for 1 1/2 weeks.  Cooked in slow cooker about 6 hrs, reduced all liquid in a saucepan and then poured back over pork as a glaze.

Very good roast.  The second time I made it I cut the amount of balsamic vinegar and added a pinch of sugar.  I preferred it that way, but the original recipe is very good.

Excellent!  I used a good White Balsamic which is a little bit sweeter then the red so for those that thought it was too strong, try the White Balsamic and agree, get a good brand.  I made the marinade as direct but added some garlic powder only because we love garlic!  I would make this recipe again the next time we have Pork Loin.

This was pretty spectacular. I had a 1lb pork tenderloin and baked for about an hour, but didn't modify the quantity of ingredients at all. Added: 2T honey, 2 minced garlic cloves.

My family loved this.  It was so easy.  Good enough for company.  I used red wine vinegar and maple syrup and studded the roast with garlic.  Superb.  Will definitely make this again-soon.

I could hardly wait to finish eating to write this review! This was delicious! I had to do things a little differently though. I thought I had balsamic vinegar, turns out it was red wine vinegar. I thought well...I'll try it anyway. I also used extra virgin olive oil and Montreal steak seasoning. I put the pork loin in a gallon size Foodsaver bag (it was almost 3 lbs.) along with the mixed ingredients. Then I vacuum sealed it and put it in the frig. around noon today. I started cooking about 5 tonight and thought I had made a huge mistake! The entire house smelled like red wine vinegar. (VERY STRONG) I thought well we'll see what happens. It turned out absolutely perfect! I cooked it for 1 hr. checked the temp and it was at 150. I removed and let sit for 10 minutes while I made mashed potatoes and heated green beans. It was so juicy and flavorful, but not overpowering at all. I can't wait for leftovers tomorrow night!

I have never reviewed a recipe, but this one finally made me take the plunge. It is sooooooooo good! I made it for my extended family once and now everyone makes it for their own families. Very easy, and delicious! You can try different steak seasonings to switch the flavor up, I've never had a bad flavor!

This is very tasty.  I marinated it for two hours but wish I had marinated it longer.  Still, it was excellent.  Because I used the less-expensive balsamic, I added two tablespoons of honey.

I had balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing and just used that. I also added honey to it so it wasn't as tangy. I've already made this recipe twice!!

Simple and tasty. It smelled sooooo good cooking that I could hardly wait for it to finish.  I only marinated for 2.5 hours but it still was great. Can't wait to try it again with a longer marinade time. It's definitely a keeper.

What a great recipe!  So simple and so easy on the pantry. I marinated for a full 24 hours and it was soooo worth it.  When the loin was cooling I used what was left in the dish to make a sauce.   This is now a staple recipe for my family.

This was a super simple recipe.  I didn't have enough balsamic vinegar, so i used a 1/4 cup of honey.  I also didn't have enough steak rub, so I used some salt free grilled chicken seasoning.  I grilled the pork loin over medium heat for 55 minutes, turning it after the first 10 minutes to sear the juices in.  This turned out so juicy and tasty, I will definitely be making this again.

Pressed for time, I chose this recipe because it was fast, easy, and called for few ingredients.  I was nervous because my husband is usually very picky when it comes to marinades - he hated the last few.  But he LOVED this marinade and couldn't believe how simple it was.  It's been several days since we ate the pork, but he's still talking about it!  The only variance from the recipe was that I cooked my pork in a rotisserie for about 30 minutes.

sigh....it was like a heavenly dream taking my first bite of this. i could not even begin to explain how wonderful this pork was. i accidently bought tenderloin instead of just loin but it was just as wonderful. however, i love things sweet so i added about two tablespoons of brown sugar to the marinate and also a teaspoon of minced garlic. i marinated it for well over 20 hours and it was fantastic. i am now a huge marinate lover!!! if i could rate this recipe a 10, i would!!! amazing!!!

This was my first time making a pork loin and this recipe was very easy. I marinated the loin overnight and grilled it. Since I did not want to use the oven, I tossed out the remaining marinade.  It came out great grilled, but I will be making this in the oven for sure next time so I can use the leftover marinade as a gravy over the the sliced roast.

Sensational. I marinated my pork loin overnight.  I sliced a large red onion and marinated it in balsamic vinegar and salt and pepper overnight as well.  I grilled the red onions on my George Foreman grill while the pork loin was in the oven.  Absolutely delicious.  I served this with the Roasted Potatoes and Green recipe from this site and it was one of the best meals ever.  Very elegant and somewhat gourmet ! Thanks !

This recipe was so easy to make and was very flavorful.  I agree with one of the reviewers, if yours was too vinegary, then you probably used too cheap of a balsamic.  I use Modena and it's not vinegary at all.  I would so make this again just for the easiness, but definitely for the flavor.

Mmmm I loved it! It gave a little bit of a steak flavor while still having a healthier piece of meat. I took it out at 145F and it was THE BEST pork loin I've made. SUPER tender! It was even good as a cold leftover the next day (my power went out). I had it marinate for 24 hrs. Served with roasted asparagus and mashed potatoes. Mmm mmm mmmmmmm.

Had this at our Easter Brunch 2009.  It was super simple and simply delicious.  I did slightly alter the ingredients, however, I used garlic flavored olive oil.  We are a family of pork fans and have tried many recipes from this site and this is one of the best.

Super easy and good flavor considering how little effort goes into making this. Definitely marinate for as long as possible. I would recommend a little spice like oregano or rosemary. I did two roast at the same time and it came out a little dry because I was trying to make sure they were both done. One definitley was dryer than the other.   Might try it in the crock pot next time.

Excellent. Easy to make. I used a chicken pork rub and red wine vinegar instead or balsamic.  It turned out really tasty.  Next time will take out when thermometer reads 145, 160 was a little dry but still really good.

Made this tonight on pork loin chops and then grilled. I didn't say anything to my family about the new recipe. I noticed the flavor and you could cut the pork chop with a spoon, but no one else said anything. I am going to try this marinade on chicken as well.

I used half as much balsamic vinegar, garlic pepper salt for the steak seasoning, and cooked the loin in my electric roaster for four hours at 325.  When we got home from church, it was perfectly tender and moist.  I plan to do this again.

I saw a lot of reviews commenting that the pork was too vinegary.  I think success with this recipe mostly depends on the quality of the balsamic vinegar.  For about $20 you can buy a pretty good bottle and it will last quite sometime.  If your vinegar is cheap, it may as well be white vinegar.

Great marinade.  I used it on boneless pork chops and they were soooo tender.  I plan to try it on chicken as well.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I scaled this recipe to serve four because I had one lb. of pork tenderloin. I didn't change anything else and used Montreal steak seasoning for the rub. It made a very moist tenderloin and did take the full hour to cook completely. I think next time I will add minced garlic to the marinade and make sure to only leave it in for two hours as three and a half hours made it a little too vinegary and salty for our taste. A very easy and quick recipe that I will definitely make again, Thank you.

This turned out amazing!! It was so unbelievably juicy. And the mother-in-law even asked for the recipe. Yea, it's that good!! Highly recommend it. I cannot recall if I added anything or not. I think I may have, but a few seasonings or something? Thanks for the recipe!

I did this in a crockpot and the only change I made was to add a few shots of Worchestershire sauce. My husband complimented me AT LEAST THREE TIMES on it! That's a record! This recipe is definitely a keeper. I did make gravy out of the sauce. I added soome chicken broth and cornstarch for the gravy.

This is a really great recipe.  I'm a beginner and this was my first time ever cooking pork loin that wasn't purchased premarinated so I wanted something that wasn't complicated and this was it.  It had a great smell while cooking and a great flavor to match.  Everyone loved it!!

Wow!!! Great flavor and super tender! I had a large peice of pork loin so I cut it in half and used two different types of rub. One was a butter garlic rub and the other was a rib rub. My family polished off most of it and we'll have the rest tonight!!! Thanks for this recipe.. it was a HIT!

This is so good!  My whole family of 6 loved it!  I absolutely cannot stand when so many recipes have reader comments that say it was good but better with their adjustments.  I don't even read those.  This was perfect as is.  Great flavor and very tender.  Thank you!

Great recipe.  Marinated for 24 hours, was not too vinegary.  Definately requires longer cooking to reach temperature of 160-170 degrees.  Let stand at least 15 minutes.  Adding brown sugar to the left over sauce is amazing!!  Would be a great chicken marinade as well!

Terrific dish!  My husband usually does not like anything with basalmic vinegar in it so I made pork two ways. He tried a bite of the roasted pork loin without the basalmic vinegar and then one with. He had two servings of this recipe, it was so sweet and delicious! Can't wait to have this one again!

I turned to this recipe because my pork loins have always been too tough. So I never buy loin and usually stick with butts. But pork loins were on sale and so I tried this recipe because so many of the reviews said it made the loin so tender. Unfortunately, it didn't work for my roast. I followed the recipe exactly, and while it did add some favor, the roast was still too tough and chewy.

Doubled liquid ingredients for 3.5 lb roast. Used 1 1/2 T seasoning. Marinated overnight and stuck in crockpot on low for 8 hours. It was great!

I made this last night for my family.  I only had 1/4 cup of olive oil so I halved the marinade recipe and used a 3 lb boneless pork loin roast.  The marinade actually seemed quite sufficient. I chopped a whole white onion and put it on the bottom of my crock-pot, followed by about 5 quartered red potatoes and then the roast w/ marinade.  I cooked it on high for 2 hours, then put to low for 4 more (until internal temp was 170.) With about 2 hours remaining, I added a few handfuls of baby carrots.  Roast and veggies had good flavor but roast was a little on the dry side... could be from halved marinade?  I strained the juices in the pot and made a gravy but will just use a jar of pork gravy next time as what I made was too tangy for our tastes due to the balsamic vinegar.

Works perfectly in the slow cooker also!  I probably used more vinegar and oil than the recipe called for, and I cooked it on low for about 6 hours.  Very tender and great flavor.

So easy and healthy.  Our family loves this with a touch of extra seasoning.  We added some garlic, a few dashes of salt and pepper on the meat before marinating and Voila!  Excellent dinner.

This was delicious and SO moist!  I didn't have steak rub so I used 2 Tbsp of Emeril's Essence and it turned out fabulously.  I also used 3/8 cup my really good Olivier 25-year aged balsamic vinegar with just 1/8 cup of lesser quality balsamic vinegar, just in case the recipe wasn't very good.  But it WAS!

Very Good!  Followed other reviewers and added 1/4 cup brown sugar to marinade.  I cooked my pork roast in the crockpot on high for 5 hours.  Delicious!  Yes, it made a great gravy.  Will have leftovers as pulled pork sandwiches with the sauce.

Great recipe!  The perfect thing when you need something fantastic and you don't have 10,000 ingredients.  

I used a pork shoulder and also seasoned with McCormick spicy Montreal steak seasoning.  Once the roast was done, I added about 1/3 cup of brown sugar to the pan drippings and let it cook down to thin ketchup consistency (it will thicken with cooling).  WOW.  It became THE most sweet/savory/spicy, homemade version of Pickapeppa/A1 sauce ever.  My family loved the roast, but I think we loved that leftover sauce even more!  I made simple sandwiches using leftovers on hoagie rolls with mayo and the "magic sauce" that were to die for...

I followed this as written and only added some garlic powder -- I didn't add any additional salt or pepper and roasted as described. I used boneless pork loin (NOT tenderloin) and the meat was tender and delicious and browned nicely.  Will make this many times again - excellent!

I marinated the pork loin in Kraft Balsamic Vinagrette for a few hours and it was indeed the best pork loin I have ever tasted. I will be making this again. My family loved it.

This was a winner per the whole family. I put sliced garlic in the meat, used a pork rub, quality balsamic & marinated overnight. The juices made an amazing gravy.

If you really love the flavor of balsamic, give this a try.  My family likes the flavor and enjoy it in salad dressings as well as combined with olive oil for dipping sauces.  I marinated the loin for 24 hours then baked as directed.  We didn't savor the taste of this meat. I was edible but not one I would attempt again.  Perhaps I marinated it too long but the balsamic was overpowering and it just didn't work for us.

Excellent! I was looking for something different to do with pork roast and this is it! Followed exactly but added chopped garlic and a touch of brown sugar to the marinade. Meat was so tender and my boyfriend loved it!

I followed the instructions exactly.  I  have a meat thermometer that is built in to my oven and removed the roast at exactly 145....it was still a bit bloody in the center however.  I didn't enjoy the flavor, so something was not right.  My son LOVES pork and commented that it tasted metallic. (?)  I think something must have gone wrong as this is SO highly rated!  I will try again sometime: maybe with a different brand balsamic vinegar!  (I will not give this a bad rating as I don't want to blame the recipe...I'll blame myself!)

I read all the reviews and made this exactly as the recipe instructed and I am telling you this was a HIT with my family, even my new very picky son in law.  I will be making this over and over again and so will my daughter for her new husband!

I just have to say ~ this was pretty good. I did have to make 1 minor adjustment though ~ I only had approx. 1/3 cup of The Balsamic Vinegar to use so I just added the difference in water...it was either that or drop what I was doing and run to the store or just wing it ~ so I did just that and it still came out pretty good. I will make this again but next time I'll use the amt the orig recipe called for ")

I made this exactly as the recipe called for but I used spicey montreal steak seasoning.  It was excellent and very spicey.  I served it with crunchy french bread and mashed potatoes.  The potatoes and bread helped your mouth from getting too hot as you ate.  Steamed asparagus and red wine rouned the dinner.  It was a hit with everyone in the family and I will make again for sure.  Thanks!!

I've made this recipe several times.  Love it!  The only time it wasn't great was when I roasted it longer than the recommended 1 hour.  Still it was good... but stick to the 1 hour cook time.  Even better when my husband grills it!

I prepared this just as the recipe was written.  It rocked!!  My husband couldn't get enough of it!  I did marinate overnight; wanted to get the full flavor of the marinade-it was awesome! I also pierced the meat several times with a knife to help the marinade penetrate into the meat.  It will be put in a cookbook I have comprised myself of our favorite meals, casseroles, desserts, etc.

This was a different way to have pork loin, but we really liked it.  I only marinated it for 2 hours and I think I will do it longer next time (I did have a pretty thick pork loin though).

I wanted something different and this was it. Everyone raved. I used 2 pork tenderloins (about 3 lbs.) put the marinade in a zip bag, added a little garlic powder, turned it a few times, let it sit for about 1 hour and put it in a crockpot juice and all for 4 hours on high. This is a keeper.

It goes without saying don't make this if you don't like balsalmic vinegar, olive oil, or steak seasoning. You won't like it. But if you do like those things, this is a great easy recipe. But like most simple recipes the quality of ingredients really does matter quite a bit. So spend a bit more and you will be that much more impressed. If using cheap balsalmic I would add a bit of sugar to this mix as well to take out the bite.

I thought I had the best pork loin recipe, but I was wrong!  This is great.  Of course, the balsamic vinegar flavor is dominant, so if you don't like balsamic vinegar, you won't like the roast.  I used a pork rub with rosemary and ginger.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  As good as it was straight out of the oven, it was even better the next day cold!

FANTASTIC recipe. My husband loved it. I used Balsalmic Vinegar of Modena and it worked great. I also added 2 Tbsps of freshly pressed garlic to the marinade and I think it added alot to the flavor. I marinated the loin overnight. It was super juicy. Will definitely make this again.

This was fantastic! I used the Balsamic Vinegar of Modena (Monari Federzoni)Even the 2 grandbabies 2-1/2 and 3 ate it! It was not over powering with vinegar at all. Just the right snap and very tender.

Spectacular tasting and so easy! I cut the olive oil in half, but the pork ended up a little dry, so I may have to follow the recipe next time.

We liked this.  I let it marinate overnight.  I did not have steak seasoning, but I used 2 tsp of minced garlic and 1 tsp of rosemary as suggested by others.  I did not find any of the flavorings to be overpowering.  Just a nice way to make a roast.

Very good recipe, and gets additional points for being so easy to prepare! I used a pomegrante balsamic and it added sme tangy-fruitiness to it which was very good.

O My Gosh, This pork recipe was awesome.  The best ever made.  I'm not too keen on pork since one of my pregnancies, but this one...the whole family LOVED it.  Definately will make it again.

This was the best pork tenderloin I've ever had. I made one modification, since I only had just short of 1/4 c balsamic vinegar I added 1/8 c red wine vinegar. We also cooked it to 160 but that is a personal preference as to how well done we like our meat. We'll make this again for sure.

I follwed this recipe to the note, and it came out perfect. In agreement with other reviewers, the quality of the balsalmic vinger makes all the difference. DELICIOUS, and looking forward to trying same marinade on chicken.

I was extremely pleased with this recipe, even though I only marinated it for about 3 hours. I did add 1/4 cup of honey which another reviewer mentioned and I cooked it in a cooking bag. It was very tasty (not vinegary at all) and really really tender.
I will definitely make this again.

Fantastic recipe!  The kitchen smelled divine.  Had some pierogis and a salad.  Great meal.  The A&P had a sale on boneless pork loin.  I bought a huge one and will be making this again this weekend.  Makes great pork sandwiches too!

let me preface by saying the last time I asked my wife to try pork she emphatically stated where she will shove the aforementioned pork....

That being said; I'm already in the doghouse, so I figured if I made a pork loin for dinner it couldn't be any worse for me (OK- so I'm passive aggressive) - she LOVED it.  (She's a big balsamic fan; as well as rosemary/garlic as others have said).  I also added potatoes (most were undercooked) and asparagus to the pan.

My wife and I loved this recipe.  She said it was the best roast pork loin that she ever tasted.  I added two more ingredients that worked well with the recipe; rosemary and garlic.

The one IMPORTANT item to note is that it takes much longer than 1 hour to cook, as mentioned in the recipe.  In my opinion, it takes at least 2 hours.

FANTASTIC!! Easy, Fast, Delicious, Bold. This is the first recipe I've taken the time to review b/c it is so good. FYI - I took the leftover marinade after cooking, and put it in a gravy separator. I was able to pour the extra vinegar/seasonings over the leftover pork without all the extra oil. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good however a bit more subtle than I prefer.  I wish I had followed previous reviewers and made the pan drippings gravy.  

One of the best things about cooking this is how yummy it smells.  The Balsamic Vinegar fills the house - in a very good way.  I can't imagine thinking that was a bad smell - to each his/her own I guess.  

I will make again but perhaps use a tent over to tenderize it a bit more and reserve some of that precious dripping.

Although the roast was moist and I thought it tasted pretty good, my husband didn't care for it. I hardly tasted the vinegar, but he did. Sooooo, I'll probably stick to the old marinade standby: Montreal steak seasoning, garlic, olive oil and a touch of soy sauce. Never fails to delight.

Yum!  SO easy and turned out great!  An impressive meal for my inlaws on Christmas Eve.  Will definitely make again!  "Vinegar smell" was not an issue.  Went very well with "Sarah's Applesauce!"

This was a very easy recipe. The marinade is subtle. I think we just like stronger flavors with our pork. I would recommend people trying this one if you like a light marinade. Thank you for the recipe.

I made this with a 3 lb turkey breast and it was really good, my husband really enjoyed the gravy I made with the pan drippings with mashed potatoes!  Only 4 stars though, because we both thought that the seasoning made it just a bit too salty...I used the Montreal Steak (not reduced sodium) so maybe next time I'll add my own spices to the basalmic mix or cut the bottled stuff in half - I really think that the basalmic and oil are what make this work so well any way.

Loved this!  It was a huge hit in my house.  Even my husband, who is not a pork fan, thought this was delicious.  The only thing was, I took it out of the oven at the recommended 145 and let it set the 10 minutes and it was way too underdone.  Just sliced it, put it back in the marinade and back into the oven for another 10-15 minutes.  It was perfect.  Very moist and flavorful.

Really enjoyed this easy recipe!  I used approx 3-4 pounds pork loin fillets and marinated 18 hours.  

I like my pork well done, so even after cooking to a temp of 150 degrees (higher than the suggested temp in the recipe), I put it back into the oven for another 15 minutes.  I'd recommend cooking to 165 degrees.

This is delicious!  I actually cooked mine in the slow cooker.  The whole family loved it.  I did not think it was too "vinegary" at all.  The roast was very tender with a wonderful flavor.  Quick and easy.  Great recipe!

I cooked mine on slow cook in the Insta Pot  because I wanted to try out the slow cook setting.  The cooker did fine but because pork cooks so fast I will use the oven method next time. It was good but a little overcooked for me. It didn’t really matter though because the sauce is delicious and really brought it to life. Quick and easy recipe and will definitely do it again. Thanks for sharing!

Scrumptious!!! As per other reviews, added fresh garlic, cooked over a bed of onions!!! Also, seared it 3mins on each side on a cast iron skillet before placing it on a baking aluminum tray. Marinated over night. It was super juicy and absolutely delicious! Even the kids loved it ! Served it with mash potatoes & salad m! Thanks yo for such great recipe!

Made this ahead for SuperBowl party, sliced very thin and served at room temp on slider rolls. I cooked the roast on sliced onions and served these on the side along with mustard or bbq sauce in case they wanted. Very easy to prepare.  I marinated overnight so the onions tasted pickled.

Today, I cooked around a 6 lb. pork loin so I tripled the recipe and let it marinate overnight this time. It came out amazing! This is the 2nd time I have made this recipe. First time I only let it marinate for 2 hours, and it came out excellent. By marinating it overnight, it had less of a vinegar taste. If you don't like the taste of vinegar anything, then you probably won't like this recipe.

Really enjoyed this - only change was to add the onions under the roast as mentioned by several commenters. They were delicious.  I used the steak dry rub recipe from this site, but with half the salt volume.  Will definitely make this again. Thank you!

Good flavor.  I’d use a tenderloin next time, just personal preference.

Excellent for New Years day dinner! I used Musini White Truffle Balsamic Glaze which is very concentrated, so I used 1/4 C and 1/3 C olive oil. I marinated it overnight and turned it several times while marinating. 
The pork loin was flavorful, juicy and made a great presentation for a holiday meal. The clean up was a messy issue because of the sugars in the balsamic vinegar. I saved some of the juice/marinate with the leftovers, but the remaining burned juice in the pan needed to be soaked overnight to clean. I am so glad I made it, because this will be made many more times in the future.

I cut the balsamic vinegar and oil to 1/3 c because I had 2 small pork loins. I was only able to marinate it for 1/2 hour. I used a homemade steak seasoning that I keep on hand. I like my pork well done to 160, the marinade kept the meat moist and we used the pan drippings. It was easy and very tasty, I will use this recipe again-next time leaving enough time to marinate longer.

This was absolutely delicious! My husband enjoyed eating this. The pork loin was extremely tender. I did cut the balsamic vinegar in half. We’ll do this again soon.

The marinade was good but a tad overpowering.  I would probably reduce the amount of seasoning to 1 Tbsp.  I think the leftovers will work well on a salad tomorrow night!

The best pork loin roast I have ever tasted. I followed the recipe exactly as written and it turned out perfect. Our house with was filled with this wonderful aroma and family couldn't wait! As another reviewer stated it makes delicious sandwich's. I will never cook a pork loin any other way. Thanks for the recipe!

Easy to make, but a little too salty and dry on the inside. I added 1/4 cup white wine and 1/4 cup honey as well, but that didn't do too much.

This was very good.  I almost didn't make it because I did not have balsamic vinegar but I did have pomegranate vinegar. I use just 1/4 cup of the vinegar, added some chopped garlic. I baked for one hour which was probably 10 minutes too long but the roast was still tender and delicious.  Next time I will check temp at 45 minutes.

This recipe is delicious exactly as written, but after reading the reviews, I decided to make some additions. I used a 3.5 lb center cut, boneless pork roast. I used 1/3 c of Kirkland brand olive oil & 1/3 c of Kirkland balsamic vinegar. I added 3 large cloves pressed fresh garlic & 1/3 c honey to the marinade, mixed well and put it all in a large ziplock bag. I marinated for just over 24 hrs. That did the trick! Cooked @ 350 degrees & it took a little over 2 hrs to reach 160  degrees, using an instant read thermometer inserted into the center. The honey gave it a nice caramelized glaze & the sweetness balanced well with the balsamic vinegar. The garlic gave it extra savory flavor. Don’t leave out the garlic! I sliced a large onion into thick slices and put them in the bottom of the pan, so the roast wouldn’t stick. I used a disposable aluminum baking pan, the size of a rectangle cake pan, for easy clean up. I wouldn’t use a very deep sided pan for this. Low & slow is the way to cook this because it came out so tender, it was heavenly. This is easy to make & you can serve this to company. Serve with roasted cut up sweet potatoes or baby potatoes. I used some of the pan juices over the meat. This is going into my repertoire for pork dishes! Loved it!

I followed the recipe and used Montreal Steak seasoning. I should have worked harder to dissolve the seasoning better. Next time, I’ll use a little more seasoning. Otherwise, It came out well. I used a food saver to vacuum seal for marinating.

This  roast is so good!! I used Weber's Mesquite Steak seasoning  and 1/3 cup canola oil and  1/3 cup balsamic vinegar that is middle of the line  as far as cost. There was plenty of juice after roasting that was excellent gravy on the mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus. I will  be making again.

Grilled the pork instead of in the oven.  Made a reduction from the marinade on the stove.  Delicious.

This was fabulous and so easy! I really do think a good. vinegar would make or break the recipe though. I don’t even like balsamic vinegar so this was such a pleasant surprise!

I made it exactly as described and it came out very well. I might try some of the suggested changes next time, but there is one thing I did not see mentioned in the reviews I read. I will slice it very thin to serve it and use the thickened sauce to add flavor. The thinner slices were even more delicious than when I first served thick slices. I will definitely make this again.

I believe I could have sliced them thicker.  I did marinate them for 7 hours and they still didn't have the flavor I was hoping for.  I will try them again to see if overnight would bring out a better product.

I have made this several times, and we like it so much we keep making it. It is our go to fro pork loin. I have a convection oven with a probe. I convection roast the meat. I put aluminum foil on the pain for easy clean up. I place the meat on a rack above the pan.

I made this on the...green ceramic grill/smoker.  I soaked hickory wood chips and added a handful on every ~15 minutes.  I grilled until the pork loin read 145 degrees in the center, then took it off the fire and let it rest under loose aluminum foil for 15 minutes.   We served it with sweet corn risotto and spinach salad.  And a glass of wine.  Good stuff!

I followed advice on cutting the wine by 3/4 and substituting water/beef broth because of picky eaters, and it was perfect. All the kids loved it and I've made it several times. I also eliminated the celery, and onion step. I actually confused this recipe with another one I make and added a packet of Lipton's onion soup mix one of the times I made it. It was good!

Love it!  I agree about the quality of the balsamic vinegar!  Use good/great quality!  Delicious! My pork came out dark because my balsamic is very dark.

Love this quick and easy recipe.  I cook it in the slow cooker on low for about 6 to 8 hours.  I use the balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing instead of the separate vinegar and oil.

This is my favourite way to cook pork, turns out great every time. The only change I made was marinating between 4 and 8 hours. I find 2 isn't enough, while overnight can be a bit too much.

The whole family, 4 kids and 2 adults, loved this. It was easy, my 6 year old helped me put together the marinade and put it in the oven, and the flavor was perfect. Even though I somehow overcooked it (internal temperature was 180!) it was not at all dry, or tangy (I'd anticipated not liking it much) - my husband asked me to always make pork loin this way from now on. Big hit, thank you so much Melissa S.

Very good. Just a few changes to suit our flavor profiles.
Added minced garlic and rosemary (both fresh)to the marinade omitted the maple syrup since we prefer savory to sweet. 
I did marinate overnight, reserving some of the marinade. We BBQ’d the lion roast basting with half of the reserved marinade... 
Served with rosemary garlic roasted red potatoes and asparagus also roasted during last 15 minutes of cooking the potatoes. Drizzled the remaining marinade on the asparagus just before serving.  Delish!

Made in my halogen oven. I should have basted it more than once and turned it over before I did but  the flavor was terrific and it still was very moist. It cooks quicker in halogen so use a digital thermometer for best results.

Loved this recipe, so simple and easy to throw together. I used Montreal steak spice and a new but inexpensive bottle of balsamic vinegar and didn't have any issues with the flavour. Marinated for several hours, then after I removed the pork from the marinade I tossed a bag of cut veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, and baby cut carrots) plus some red onion in the left over marinade, then cooked in the same dish with the pork (poured the remaining marinade over everything) Turned out great! Will be making this one again for sure.

I used a lager piece of loin so added a  more each ingredient.  Awesome!  I did use a good quality vinegar so don't be cheap and this will turn out terrific.

I'm on the fence about this one. I like that it's really easy and has only a few ingredients. What I didn't like was the sharp taste the balsamic vinegar imparted on the overall taste. I used very good quality vinegar but I still felt it was the wrong mix of flavors. I'm sure a lot of my friends would like this but I'm a bit warm on it. I may try it again using half as much of the vinegar. If so, I'll report back.

I use this recipe ALL the time;  whether we grill or bake, this marinade is top notch.  In addition, I use a bit of the drippings in a sauce (too much balsamic makes it too  tart) with a little red wine.  Reduce it all and add rosemary.  Great stuff.

Without a doubt the best pork tenderloin I have ever cooked. I added some brown sugar to the pan dripping mixture, brought to a boil after adding some wondra thickener. Poured over the sliced pork. I had some hamburger seasoning called gourmet burger that I rolled the tenderloin before baking.

I've made this twice and each time worked perfectly! Every other way I've prepared this meat I've gotten the meat too dry. This makes it moist and flavorful. Probably the only way I'll do pork loin again.

Awesome recipe I added some time for the thickness of my pork loins, but probably only about 10 minutes. Truly a great recipe because you can prepare it in advance and have it ready within one hour

Was only about 45 min for us to get to temp (convection oven), so be careful depending on the size of your loins.  We also did the onions underneath, which were enjoyed.

I had a small pork loin, one pound, so I halved the recipe, marinated for about an hour.  It cooked well, smelled great, and was tender and very tasty!  Easy as can be.  Next time I’ll do a bigger roast for the leftovers!

Good recipe! Tweaked the seasonings a bit and roasted away. I used a 4.2lb loin, so I doubled up on the ingredients (except the olive oil, I actually cut back on that a little). It was done in about 75 minutes at 375. Basting every 15..

Fantastic! Juicy, tender and so flavorful.  I did one thing differently--I made my own montreal seasoning, leaving out the pepper.  Making it again, and soon.

I’ve made this at least 6 times and we love it! I’ve marinated it for different time periods but like 2-3 hours best. The guality of the vinegar is important to the taste.

I made this exactly to specifics and it was delicious. At first, I was a little offput by the vinegary smell but after that first bite, was hooked! My husband loved it as well and I'll be saving this for a super quick and easy recipe.

I made it exactly by the directions.  Thanks to other reviewers for the suggestion to use a high quality balsamic vinegar.  I think that made all the difference.  We wanted to dip our French bread in the sauce - it was that tasty!

Turned out great! Family loved it! Super moist. Didn't have steak rub, used my go to Lawry's seasoning. Also, did as many reviewers suggested and placed them on a bed of onions after searing. Let them rest for 15 minutes. Not vinegary at all. Great recipe! It's a keeper.

I have made this balsamic pork loin many times. It is the most flavorful pork that I have ever had. I will continue to make this for dinner. Do not over cook. Follow the cook time on the recipe. If you like balsamic and olive oil you will definitely love this item. Again it is very moist and tender. My family loves it.

So simple and so good!   I did add some garlic to the marinade, but otherwise made no changes.  It turned out moist and  full of flavor.   I used the pan drippings for a gravy, adding a bit of flour and cooking for a few minutes while the roast was resting.   I'll definitely make again.

Ive never made a moist pork loin until now. I read through reviews and baked mine (4.25 lbs)  at  350°  for 30 minutes and the at  300°  for another two hours. My internal temp was  175°  so I could’ve probably could’ve gone a shorter cook time. I basted it a few times throughout as well. Excellent recipe!

Followed directions as listed. Pork was tender and tasty. Lots of juice/sauce for drizzling over the meat.

This marinade was awesome!  We have a local shop in town that offers gourmet vinegars & oils.  I used an Italian herb balsamic vinegar with a specialty extra virgin olive oil.  Extrordinary!  And the best part, easy!  5 stars for sure.

This was so simple & very tasty! I did use the crockpot - on hi for 2-3 hrs. Then I shredded the meat and served up with the pot juices. Next time I may make a gravy with the pot juices. Looking forward to left overs.

So so good and everyone loved it. I used Dark Cherry Balsamic vinegar and added garlic and onion powder. Made it for a wine pairing party and served with roasted red potatoes. Will definitely make again.

Not a lot of flavor except the vinegar.  It was ok but needs something to make it better tasting.  No one complained but no one said "make that again" either.

This recipe is really yummy. The pork was done with the exact time a stated in the recipe and was very tender. I served it quinoa, roasted corn and a Yuengling Porter. I will definitely make this again. My husband loved it just as much as I.

Instead of steak rub, I used applewood rub (McCormick makes a decent version), that added some sweetness to the vinegar and makes a great one-two tasting sensation when eating the pork.  This is super easy to make and a crowd pleaser.

This is a family favorite, I highly recommend a meat probe and a GOOD balsamic vinegar. I use Montreal Steak seasoning and the guys fight over the leftovers. Tip: if your family *never ever* has balsamic vinegar or that type of flavor profile perhaps reduce the quantity a little bit, use a 1/3 of a cup instead for the first try.

Outstanding, the marinade was wonderful. I used a pomegranate infused balsamic vinegar with the EVOO and I didn’t have a steak rub so I used herbs de Provence. Served with a chef Johns baked macaroni and cheese and braised artichoke bottoms. Followed with a caprese salad. Perfect blend of flavors. Big hit with my guests.

I've never written a review for a recipe...but this was so delicious, I had to.  I did add honey and fresh garlic to the marinade as other reviewers suggested.  It was super easy, I had everything I needed on hand...and it turned out amazing.  So tender we could cut it with a fork.

OMG this was awesome! Used a 4lb roast but kept marinade quantities the same. Marinated for 24 hrs   This the juiciest pork I have ever eaten. My husband and grandson both loved it and my grandson is a picky eater. Will certainly make again.

Good pork loin. Followed the recipe,  except added a little honey, 1/4 cup and cut just a shade off of the vinegar. Did marinate about 4 to 5 hours in the frig. Tasted great. Will do again.

Made this last night and it was delicious. I took some of other reviewers suggestions like adding chopped scallions and parsley in the marinade. I also cooked it on a bed of sliced onions. After cooking, I put the remaining marinade and onions into a saucepan, added beef broth, a little wine and some bottled balsamic glaze and dissolved some cornstarch in a bit of broth and added that in to slightly thicken it. Poured it over the sliced meat before serving. I cook boneless pork tenderloin in a way I learned on this website. Heat oven to 500 degrees. Put room temperature pork loin into the oven and put timer on for 7-8 minutes per pound. Then TURN OFF OVEN without opening the door and put the timer back on for 50-60 minutes. I like 50 minutes as when removed from oven it continues to cook when put on cutting board and tented with foil for at least 10 minutes. Perfect every time.

I made it just as the recipe said. The only thing I did was add a few thinly sliced onions on top. It was tender and delicious. Everyone I served it to loved it. I agree with another reviewer who said it is important to use high quality balsamic vinegar  it does make a difference.

This is one of the BEST recipes I have found.  The pork was tender and delicious!  Made this for dinner for a few friends and everyone loved it.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  I did not have any extremely vinegar smell  like some reviewers said.  Maybe it was the type of vinegar they used.  Anyway, I will definitely be making this again!  Maybe I'll try putting onions in the bottom of the pan as one reviewer suggested.

This turned out fantastic! Only addition was sliced onion in bottom of the dish before adding pork to cook. Leftovers make a great sandwich.

I marinated the loin for about 15 hours and you could really taste the balsamic vinegar. It was so awesome that my husband who doesn't normally like pork loin loved this recipe. Definitely a keeper!

Yum.  This works quickly and is very forgiving.  We didn’t have a lot of time to marinate, the meat was not completely defrosted and we only had an old half-empty bottle of balsamic vinegar in the back of the pantry.  I have used this on chicken and pork.  It was delicious!

I've made this 2ce. It's tasty and cooks up perfectly, never dry, always moist. However, next time I think I will cut down the vinegar and the seasoning. I do use very good balsamic, but I feel the recipe is lacking something, not sure exactly what yet, but perhaps garlic as others have said would be a good place to start.

Soooo easy and delicious. I threw potatoes and carrots into the roast pan with all of the marinade and the pork and it was a real hit with the whole family. My husband can’t stop talking about how good it was a month later.

This was phenomenal and so easy to make.  The only adjustment I would make is to use less steak spice.  I used Montreal Steak spice and found it a bit too salty but I will definitely readjust and make again.  This made wonderful gravy too.

Wow What a surprise. I had a little bit of a different situation where I had an 8 pound loin because there was a really good sale at the supermarket. It ended up getting cut in half but I cooked both at the same time. I tripled the marinade recipe. I read alot of the reviews and yes - it will make your house smell very vinegary but the end flavor is so much better than expected. Even my son commented that he expected it to taste more like vinegar. I added some garlic and a touch of honey as suggested by another poster. I let  them marinade for about 24 hours flipping after 12. I may have cooked them a touch too long but they were delicious. I cooked them on a rack since I didn't trim the fat before marinating and I didn't want them swimming in fat drippings. I think next time I might try pounding them (or it if they're not on sale :) ) before I marinade . Will definitely make again!

I added Brussels Sprouts (halved) and cut up pieces of bacon that I had rendered in a fry pan for a bit (to remove a bit of the fat) to the roasting pan.  The bacon and sprouts were tender and yummy.  The Roast was just a bit dryer than I like it, and my husband commented on the dryness, too.  I cooked it for one hour at 350 and used a probe thermometer  as well.  The timer for the oven and the temperature alarm went off at exactly the same time.  
  I will make this again, but I will probably cook it to 137 and let it coasts to 145.

Delicious!
I marinated the roast over night with the ingredients the recipe call for. I did bake the roast for 45 mins at 350' and then turned the oven up to 450' and baked the roast for another 10mns just as another reviewer did. Make sure to cover the roast with foil and let it rest a good ten minutes when it come out of the oven. I also added potato quarters. I did bake those an additional 15 mins. The roast was so tender and juicy. My family loved it, dog included. This will be my go to recipe for pork ribeye roast.

I didn’t have steak seasoning rub and so I made my own and it turned out very well. My sister says it is worth repeating. It was delicious!!

This was delicious.  So simple and tasty.  I had a 1.5 lb pork loin, so I cut the recipe in half.  It was the perfect amount of marinade.  I followed some other’s suggestions of placing the meat on onion slices. My husband and I both give it 5 stars.

Absolutely delicious! I use my own homemade season salt... I found this recipe so yummy. We put it into a cast iron skillet and added sliced Yukon gold potatoes on the side. Half way through we turned the loin over to Herba nice crust on it. Phenomenal! I cannot remember enjoying a port loin as much as this! Thank you!

This was delicious.  I didn't have steak seasoning, so I used dijon mustard and it was delicious and very easy.  I will make it again!

Prepared this exactly a written but for a larger roast. I marinated a four-pound pork loin roast, cut in half, using same measurements in a gallon bag overnight. This was amazing paired with the Scalloped Potatoes II recipe and steamed carrots. This recipe is simple and delicious! A keeper for sure!

I hardly ever review anything but the boyfriend says this is in the top favorite things I’ve made for him so credit is due! I’ve made this recipe 3 times now and yes, I’ve made some modifications according to our taste but the original recipe was delicious as well! I placed sliced onions on the bottom of the pan and set the loin on top before baking. I also added some honey and lots of garlic to the marinade. When a recipe is so simplistic, make sure to use quality ingredients, especially the balsamic vinegar!

Mixed the marinade as directed and marinated Pork loins for approximately 6 hours.  I smoked the meat at 325 degrees with Cherry wood using my Traegger grill.  Meat was turned every fifteen minutes and marinated during turn cycle until meat reached internal temperature of 155 degree which was roughly 45 minutes.  Meat was both moist and very flavorful.  I am really looking forward to eating left over pork loin tomorrow night.

Made tonight for dinner.  Everyone loved it!!   Made exactly as written but I only had 1/2 cup of balsamic vinegar left.  Will definitely make again.  I did add a tablespoon of honey (to get rid of it from my pantry).  Awesome

used the cooking method described by Angie due to the fact that I was using potatoes, carrots, celery and onion. Great meal string beans on the side.

Very good as written.  I will try with the addition of garlic next time.  Word to the wise, keep an eye on your cooking time.  Remember, the roast will continue to cook while resting.

Easy to prep  and good - 2 of 3  of my family liked it.  I followed the suggestion to cube up potatoes, slice carrots and onions sliced some fresh garlic and tossed them around the roast as well - they were delicious!   I will make this again - but use a pork tenderloin instead of a loin roast....and maybe play with the seasoning a bit.

I would definitely not cook this nearly as long as an hour. It came out SUPER dry. However, the marinade was great, and the family loved it, so I'll be making it again... I just won't cook it as long ;)

I used pre-sliced pork cooked in a skillet which made the flavor way too pervasive, but the flavoring itself was really great and with a full pork loin, would have been perfect

Delicious!  My whole family enjoyed it.  I put thick onions slices and baby carrots on the bottom of the pan as another reviewer recommended and it came out very flavorful.  Leftovers are great the next day too.  Will be making it again and experiment with different spices for variation.

No need to change anything, but I do take a pint of cherry tomatoes and half them then add for the last ten minutes of baking.  Adds a vegetable to the platter and a little spin to the flavoring.

I followed the recipe with one small exception (adding a bit of white wine per other reviewers).  It took much longer than one hour to get to 145 degrees.  My family and I did not care for this dish unfortunately and won’t be making it again.

This is a delicious way to do pork tenderloin.  Very easy and is a nice variation from my normal sweet & sour pork tenderloin recipe.  I get trapped in the same old food over and over again.  This was a very nice step outside my box, lol

This is a great recipe. I have made this multiple times, and one thing I have learned is to use quality olive oil. If you use the cheaper stuff, the balsamic vinegar is just too strong. But other than that, it has turned out perfect every time.

This is the second time I have made this amazing pork loin.   I had printed out the recipe back in 2015.   I noted on the recipe that my husband said this was the best pork roast ever.   I followed recipe exactly and I marinated it overnight.   Absolutely delicious.   Again my husband said best pork roast ever

I will make it again! The flavors are wonderful and the pork  tender. I cut  all the fat off of the tenderloin and add a bit of cayenne and fresh garlic to the marinade.

Marinated for 2 hours , .5 in fridge, .5 at room temp. Cooked for just about an hour to  an internal temp of 150 degrees.  Super moist and zesty is the word. We had it with a salad and really good bread during the Nor'easter and thought about Spring. Finished with home made brownies. We will make it again absolutely

Delicious. I used gravenstein apple balsamic vinegar and placed on bed of onions and rubbed it with garlic as on a sodium restricted diet.. Super Easy. Will be making on a weekly basis.

Delicious! As many reviewers note, QUALITY balsamic makes all the difference. Seems best served with the marinade when first cooked.
Leftovers the next day disappointed, the pork dries out when refrigerated.

So tender! I marinated the meat with some typical spices, and 1/2 cup of the balsamic, white cooking wine and 1/4 cup garlic/lemon EVOO. Added some garlic to the mix and it was awesome. Put in plastic bag in fridge for about two hours. Took about 1.5 hours in oven on 350. Had a side of cauliflower mashed potatoes and used the left over marinade from the oven. This is a keep recipe for my family!

This is a keeper. Made it exactly by the recipe. A slice of this was cut with a fork tender and this marinade was a perfect fit with pork. Slightly spicy and the sweet vinegar of basalmic wonderful.

I threw this together kind of last minute to use a pork roast before it went bad. This was a very easy no fuss recipe that gave a darn good end result. I may try some variations on spices next time but, for a quick and easy roast this was a winner.

It was very good. We grilled it though because we prefer the flavor. 5 stars for the actual flavor of the recipe. 1 star for the internal meat cooking temperature suggested. We cooked to 145 degrees and let rest, it looked a little under done to us but we trust the thousand reviews on here. My husband has had food poisoning symptoms all night. I would suggest cooking to 155, 145 was just not enough to kill the bad stuff.

Really did not like this. Family only ate a little bit of it. Threw the rest out. What a waste. May have been better with some brown sugar added in. Definitely won't make this again.

My family loves this dish. The one adjustment I make is instead of half a cup each balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil I use 1 cup of each. We like to have the extra sauce/gravy to put on our mashed potatoes.

This was one of the best dishes I've ever had!!! I used a Smokehouse Maple seasoning blend from Grill Mates and Costco's balsamic vinegar. My husband and three small children loved it! It also tastes fabulous eaten cold or sliced in a sandwich. I know I will be making this often.

Good and simple recipe. I followed the recipe to the t except I did sear it before baking it as recommended ,and it turned out nice and moist, and great leftovers for Cuban sandwiches .they only reason I am not giving It a 5 star is because although good and I will make it again mostly because of its simplicity. It wasn’t exactly fantastic.

This was a delicious easy way to make pork. I agree with previous reviews that if you use good balsamic it won't be too much vinegar flavor. I marinated in a baking bag and then just put the whole thing in oven. I opened for the last 30 min and got a nice crust on the outside. Delish!

This recipe is delicious! Family and guests raved about it. Followed the recipe exactly. Marinated for 5 hours. I did add some pressed garlic cloves. Then cooked my pork loin on my rotisserie and it was superb.

Absolutely divine! It makes all the difference in the world when making a basic pork chop. My small children even get excited when I marinade in this sauce.  Yum!

Absolutely as great as everyone says.  I followed recipe for ingredients but cooked in my Ninja Cooking System.  Cooked it at the oven setting at 350.  Stayed very moist  and flavorful.

This was a big hit in my family.  I covered it with foil part way through to keep it moist. The pork was moist and flavorful.  Very easy recipe.  I will be making this again.

that meal was excellent! We marinated the meat overnight and first time I've ever cooked a pot roast that has been so moist and tasty. One-note mine took almost 2 hours to cook it was not ready in 1 hour

Absolutely the BEST pork roast I have ever made!!! Easy, too. I cooked it to just a wee bit pink in the very middle. I took it to a potluck where of course there was too much food and plenty of leftovers - except for this roast. Every bite of it was gone. People obviously went back for seconds. I'm going to try this method on a rump roast I am thawing. Hoping it is just as good.

This is *very* good - we only had two double-thick cuts of pork loin, not a whole pork loin roast, so I just halved the recipe.  I'd gotten a lovely balsamic vinegar at a Christmas craft fair last year, and used the last of that on this dish.  I served it alongside the carrots I put in the dish with the pork, and a couple of baked potatoes.  Easy dish to throw together and put in the oven while we wrap presents and sing Christmas songs. Definitely a keeper.

I grilled the pork tenderloin over indirect heat.  It was moist and tasty.  I was a little disappointed that I didn't get a distinct vinegar flavor from my expensive balsamic.  Also it was almost too salty with my steak seasoning.  I'll use cheaper balsamic next time.

Nice flavor, and very tender and juicy. I didn’t plan ahead so only had 1 hour to marinate. I pre-sliced the roast, not quit all the way through so it would stay together, stuffed it into a 1 qt ziplock bag, and poured the marinade in, making sure it got between the slices.  I marinated at room temp for 1 hour, then roasted as directed until the meat thermometer indicated 145 degrees. That only took 45 minutes, but I thought it was because it was sliced and/or because I was using a convection oven. However, it was a bit too rare for us, so I microwaved it for a minute for each of our plates and that fixed it. Next time I will definitely roast for the whole 60 minutes. I used only half the marinade for my 2 lb roast and that was plenty because I didn’t want any excess for sauce, and I roasted it on top of some asparagus, carrots, onions, and sweet potatoes. All very good except the sweet potatoes, which weren’t done, but probably would have been fine with the extra 15 or 20 minutes roasting time.

Delicious recipe ! I recommend this too anyone. I did change a few things as per reading through other reviews which I think only made it better, I'm sure it would have been a delicious recipe regardless. I added a lot of chopped garlic, honey and used spicy steak rub or seasoning, my family is big on spicy meals, I didn't measure anything I just added it in to my liking. I also put big chopped onions on the bottom of the pork loin, and cut up some red potatoes and through them in the pan on the side with the juice. I cooked it for the hour with the foil tightly on, every 15 min basting it with the juices, then for 10 min I took the foil off and upped the temperature to 415 made the top and sides a little crispy. Such a delicious dish my family loved it, dinner was done in 5 min. I would recommend this meal for anyone, it's so easy and simple. I also only marinaded it for about 4 hrs and it was still delicious.

Brilliant as is.  Do not skimp on cheap balsamic (will be too vinegary).  
The second time around I added equal measure of maple syrup - IT MADE IT EXTRAORDINARY (and took a little of the 'edge' off the vinegar bite)  I marinated for 2 hours.  Like other reviewers I put the loin on a bed of ringed onions, added a few carrots and mini potatoes (halved) around the loin (though the carrots were a little 'crunchy') and poured the marinade over it all.  I basted it twice in the latter half of the cooking with its own juices from the glass loaf dish it was in.

This was delicious.  I didn’t marinade but did cut the loin into quarters for the fantastic sauce to cook into the meat.  I also used a balsamic glaze instead of vinegar which lent to a great favour

I modified this recipe with what I had available. Instead of balsamic vinegar I used freshly squeezed lemon juice as I was given several ripe lemons from a relative. I used Montreal Steak Spice (my usual standby) and stirred in a tablespoon into the lemon juice,let it meld overnight in the fridge while my pork loin was defrosting. The next day I marinated the pork in the lemon juice mixture and olive oil(1:1) all day then roasted it according to the recipe. It was so juicy and flavorful!

I did as other reviewers suggested and added sliced onion and diced garlic to the pan.  I also cut the vinegar down to 1/3 instead of 1/2.   Next time I will be doubling the sauce.

Tastes great when it is eaten fresh.  Not as great when reheated.  It was moist and tender.

made it exactly as the recipe, the whole family loved it. I used costco  extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  I ended up marinating it for two days due to leftovers that needs to be eaten first.

I'm not normally one to write a review on recipes because I usually tweak almost everything the recipe would call for. 
I have to say this is one of the best recipes I've ever followed, almost exactly as it is! 
I had a 2.5lb pork loin. I went to the store in attempt to buying the balsamic vinegar and olive oil. The store I went to didn't have balsamic vinegar, so I settled for Kraft Balsamic Vinaigrette "dressing" in with all the salad dressings. I used that, followed all of the other measurements this recipe called for, and marinated my pork loin for about 2.5 hours. 
After putting my pork loin in and basting a couple times, about half way through I thought the loin was cooking a little too quick for the time and heat called for. I reduced the heat to 325 degrees for about 20 minutes, basted it again and turned the heat back up to 350 degrees. 
I never changed the cooking time, and this loin came out absolutely PERFECT!! I made very minor changes, and I would not change a thing next time. my family loved it, and this will definitely be something we make again and again in the future!! Thank you for this recipe!!!

Used a pork loin, cooked to 145.  Dry, will probably end up throwing it out.

Not sure it was necessary but I did make some minor adjustments.  I used Napa Valley Raspberry Balsamic vinegar. I marinated the pork for approximately 2 hours.  Because I love roasting root veggies with a pork loin  I  cut root vegetables so they were approximately the same size,  briefly steamed  the vegetables ( carrots, parsnips, onions, sweet potatoes, rutabaga , turnips, Yukon Gold potatoes) and tossed them with the marinade and roasted them in the pan with the pork loin. I introduced them 30 minutes before I expected the roast to be finished.
I seared 2 roasts,  (2.5 pound) at 425 degrees F for 25 minutes, then reduced the temp to 375 degrees for 1 hour. All turned out beautifully.

Great. I made this exactly as written, and didn't really have time to marinate for very long, due to poor planning, so it only ended up with about 3 hours of marinade time, but husband loved it. I did need to cook longer than the recipe indicated, though.

The flavor was good but not amazing. I didn't have any of the steak seasoning but I had pork seasoning, so I used that. I also added minced garlic. I think this marinade lacked sweetness. It could use some brown sugar to help mellow out the acidity from the balsamic.

This recipe is amazing! Definitely will make again! I only has time to marinade the tenderloin for an hour and it still was perfectly juicy and very flavorful! I can not wait to make it again and let it marinade for longer!

This was fabulous!  Moist and delicious and did not taste vinegar at all!  The only additions I made were a little pinch of garlic salt and a little cayenne pepper.  So easy and flavorful!

This was incredible...and so easy!  The only thing I did differently was adding some garlic powder to the marinade.  I also roasted for an hour and a half due to the size of my roast.  I will make this again and again! Thanks for posting!

Took a short cut the second time making. Instead of using olive oil and balsamic vinegar, I used a balsamic vinegar salad dressing. Added extra minced garlic with steak seasoning. I also followed the advice of another reviewer and covered with foil for a hour on 450, then removed the foil and cooked at 350 for another 30. Did not marinate and the meat was still incredibly moist! Very easy and delicious meal! Definitely going to be making again.

This was the third time that I have made the roast and it is delicious! The first time the kids ( all adults) came in and complained about the vinegar smell. Now they give me the high 5 for making it for them. I had to up it to a 7 pound roast for 7 people since they eat lots of it and everyone wants a bit to take home!!
I offered BBQ ribs, steak or chicken or the pork roast and it was unanimous for the roast for a birthday Party.
It is a good starter recipe I have made it as stated the first time, cut back on the oil the second time ( good move) and had some fresh herbs so added a bit of rosemary, thyme and garlic cloves to the marinade . Definitely a favorite and very easy for a party!

I'm no expert at cooking but I did by the directions and migrated it for 24hours. Used a Trader Joe's coffee rub with garlic
The taste was a 4/5 
But it came out beyond dry 
I too kind it out 2 times once at 20 minutes and again at 50 minutes to put the juice on top of it.
I really want to know what I could do to keep it with a nice warm moisture on the inside

I have never before taken the time to review but I could not believe how good this recipe is!! It's so simple and I took the advice of several others to put 2 thick sliced onions underneath because after roasting  they were heavenly to eat.  I used montreal steak seasoning by McCormick so there was no need to add any fresh garlic.  It definitely matters what quality of balsamic vinegar you use.  Others mentioned adding honey, a good balsamic  vinegar is naturally sweet and that would not be necessary.  The recipe as is, is a masterpiece. I used Stuarto's 18 year aged Balsamic vinegar from a company out of Kentucky.

The flavor was great.  The meat was moist on the inside and a really great flavorful crust outside.

I made this last night for dinner guests, who raved about it. I marinated it in a zip lock for 24 hours, adding garlic cloves and a tad less olive oil. Placed it in a 13 x 9 glass baking dish with sliced onions, carrots and fresh green beans beneath the roast. One guest's eyes lit up when he sampled the onions, which always does a cook's heart good. Sweet and savory at the same time for layered flavor ...a good thing.

Deeeeelish.  A few minor changes to the recipes.  I used half the amount of the balsamic and half white wine vinegar, 2 cloves of garlic minced and 1 TBS of lemongrass paste to the original recipe.  I marinated the pork loin in a seal able plastic bag for a few hours.  I cooked the pork in an air fryer for half the time and it was beautifully browned and  tender,.

This is delicious.  There will be a vinegar odor as it cooks but the final result is well worth it.  It is super moist and is a hit every time I make it.  I use Montreal Steak seasoning.

This was a surprisingly big hit with my family. I modified according to what some other reviewers suggested for a 1.3 pound pork loin. (I only marinated for an hour but it was still delicious) I did 1/4 cup balsamic, 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup dry white wine. I added roasted garlic from the jar, and a small squirt of honey.  Also mixed in the steak seasoning before pouring the marinade into the bag with the pork. Mine took 1.5 hours cooking time.  Also baked it on a bed of onions cut into thick slices. The marinade made them delicious when all was "said and cooked." I served it with rice, which also went well with the tasty marinade.

I try to use what I have in the pantry as much as possible, so I didn't buy steak seasoning for the marinade.  I prepared seasoning from a recipe here at All Recipes.  I also had raspberry balsamic vinegar on hand for salad dressing, so I thought I'd give it a try. :-)  I am still enjoying this pork loin and the raspberry balsamic gives it a little kick. :-)  This meat is so tender and juicy, even after refrigeration and microwaving!

This was incredible and easy!!! Did it in my pressure cooker and it turned out perfect. Browned the meat in 2 tbsp olive oil first then added sliced onions, garlic, balsamic and the rest of the EVOO.  Set pressure cooker on meat setting for 25 min and let the pressure come down naturally. Also have done chicken this way (less time on the PC though) and it was just as delicious.

This marinade was great. I used 18 year balsamic vinegar which is very sweet and flavorful. It's not cheap but worth it. I got it at a vinegar and oil store. Your regular store likely won't have this quality.  I also used a high quality olive oil which also makes a difference but I added in the cheap olive oil as well. I took the advisee of a reviewer and added jarred fresh garlic and some green onions.  The marinade is simple and awesome. Yum. The only thing I did wrong was cook the pork a bit too long.  I used it for chicken too and loved it.

Very  easy and good.   I did not have the best quality balsamic vinegar, so I did half and half with cooking wine.   Did not have steak seasoning, so I used black pepper, sea salt, Italian seasoning and dried rosemary to equal the same amount.  Marinated overnight.
Baked with a foil tent @350 for 45 min., (basting occasionally,  then uncovered and baked at 400 for about 10 minutes.  Would have rated a 5 if I made no changes.

I found this recipe in the Allrecipes mag that came yesterday. I am actually halfway through the recipe but learned something to share. The recipe calls for a 1/2 cup of olive oil and to marinate 8 hours. Obviously you can't leave the pork out for 8 hours so I put it in the refrigeration. After 4 hours I went to turn it over in the bag and then realized that OLIVE OIL solidifies in the fridge. So I had to leave it out until it liquefied and then put back and fridge and do that twice more. It will not marinate the meat if the oil is hardened. In three more hours I will cook it and then I'll see how well recipe worked.

The roast came out done well, it looked good (perfect timing) and it was not too dry.  However, it tasted rather plain, even though I followed the instructions and I purchased a good quality organic roast.

This had lots of flavor, I used Montreal Steak Spicy for my seasoning. I served one on a bed of romaine with the cooked marinade as the dressing( don't need much). We served one with rice. Really easy to mix up different dishes within the same meal.

Super easy, fabulous taste!  I cut the pork tenderloin into smaller chunks to marinade.  After about four hours of marinating, I baked for about an hour and the meat was tender, juicy, and very flavorful.  Definitely a recipe worth using again!

Well written recipe, easy to follow.  The flavor could have been better, perhaps using fresh garlic would work better.

My wife still raves about this a year after making it. I mistakenly started using malt vinegar, instead of balsamic. I ended up using half malt and half balsamic. I was amazed by the results as well. It may have been that we were hungry when we ate it, but this variation was by far the best experiment that I've had.

This is a keeper!  The pork is so tender and juicy! I put fingerling potatoes, carrots and onions under the tenderloin. I had to roast about another 15 min to cook the veges. I also had some asparagus I needed to cook so threw them on the top for about the last 30 min. I drizzled more olive oil on the veges. I used a good quality basalmic vinegar. no vinegar smell or bad taste. I like it that you use all the marinade. Will definitely make again!

Made it just as recipe called for.  Used Montana steak seasoning from farmers market.  Had to cook 1.5 hours for 2.14 pound roast.  It was delicious!  No changes were needed.  We did line pan with onions as one reviewer suggested and threw asparagus in the pan the last half hour.  The only thing I will do different next time is add cut potatoes to the pan as well!

I usually try to follow recipes exactly but I hated the instruction to baste it. I prefer to open my oven as little as possible when cooking meat, so I decided seal it all up in an oven bag and tie it off. I used a high grade, expensive balsamic vinegar (used the entire bottle) because I new cheap ones would probably be too vinegary. I also marinaded it overnight instead of the two hours. It didn't smell like vinegar at all when I opened it and it was pretty yummy. However, I think the one hour cook time in my oven was a bit too long since I wasn't opening my oven.

DO NOT use cheap balsamic vinegar!   This is important you want the balance between sweet and acidity.  This is a great recipe without altering but lends itself to additional ingredients such as garlic, onion or herbs. I used the idea of using pan juices for gravy and this works wonderfully too. 

This is a ?. And I'll use it again.

I loved the flavors, but watch the salt levels for your steak seasonings. Great way to use some pork loin besides the usual BBQ.

I used a 3.64 lb pork roast and doubled the recipe for marinade, marinated it a full day.  Cooked it just as instructed even though it was larger roast; no need for meat thermometer just let it rest about 10 min.  Leftovers I placed in container with the cooking juice and that kept it moist.
The only cons about this is the marinade cold since the oil congeals.  While it was cooking,  my kids had to run out of the house because of the strong vinegar smell....no kidding!! It was so strong that it woke my 13 year old son up, walked around with his nose plugged.  I didn't mind the smell but it WAS pungent and lingered.  Beware for those with sensitive smell issues lol.

Fantastic recipe.  My party of 5 all raved about the flavor of this recipe.  My pork loin was cut into 2 inch thick portions and i marinated them for about 5 to 6 hours.  As we are garlic fans, I did add about a teaspoon of minced garlic.  I placed thinly sliced onion on the bottom of the glass dish and covered with the marinade then placed the loin cuts on top.  You will have to shorten the cook time as these cook faster than a whole loin (about 25 min for thawed meat).  The guests raved about how good the pork was and how good the onion taste with it.   I recommend adding the onion for an over-the-top dish.

I had to modify for what I have on hand,  but the flavor was excellent.  I mixed half olive oil and half grapeseed oil with red wine vinegar instead of balsamic, and blacken seasoning instead of steak dressing.  I used a small whole clove of crushed garlic in the marinade as well. After marinading, I coated the pork in blacken seasoning as well and put in a covered glass baking dish for 60 minutes,  which I think was 5 minutes too long for my cut.  At 50 minutes, i added chunks bell peppers and onions to the dish and removed the cover.  Fortunately,  the sauce saved me from dried pork by slicing and soaking in the pan just before serving,  and the flavor was excellent.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This worked out really well and was very easy. I didn't have enough time to crock pot the pork roast like I usually do, so I looked for a recipe that was under 3 hours. This one, with the 2 hour marinade and 1 hour cooking did the trick. Though, mine did take 75 minutes to reach the internal temp of 145, it was a big hit. Juicy and moist, not dried out. Nice flavor.

Pretty  good and simple.
First off, if you did not follow the recipe what is the point of your review? If you made it and make it again with adjustments the second time fine, just say so.
Quality ingredients are essential if you want this to work. A good aged basalmic and a high quality EVO make all the difference. Watch your temp and do not over cook!  This was truly delish. Brussels or an herb roasted potatoes work well as a side.
That said, I will probably try little rosemary or herb de Provence  to add an herbal note and balance the basalmic as a personal preference next time.
Thank you for a simple classic.

A nice alternative to my usual teriyaki pork tenderloin. It ended up marinating for 24 hours, so the meat was beautifully infused.

It was just okay for us. Not horrible by any means, just not great. I think the steak seasoning had too much pepper for me. I might try it again with a different seasoning. Thanks for the recipe though!

I loved it. Meat was moist. I didn't have balsamic vinegar so I made my own concoction. Which is most likely way it was a bit bland season wise. Balsamic vinegar has really good flavor. Once I get balsamic vinegar I will make again.

I don't mean to sound dramatic, I will eat any food you put in front of me.   But this was honestly one of the most horrible things I have ever eaten in my life.  I wish I could give it negative stars.  I love trying new things.  We often have pork loin and pork chops cooked all different ways.  I was looking for something new and based on the reviews I HAD to try this.  I used a decent quality grocery store bought balsamic vinegar (3rd best rating on Amazon).    I followed the recipe to a T and let it marinade over night.  It was practically inedible and as I said I most definitely am NOT a picky eater.   Oddly enough, I am not much of a vegetable eater.   But I made this pork loin along with a roasted vegetable recipe I found on this site that also required the same balsamic vinegar.  They were probably the best tasting vegetables I have ever eaten.    I loved them!  Will probably make them on a weekly basis.   So I don't believe it was the vinegar that made this dish so bad.  Would not recommend to my worst enemy.

We used a very high quality balsamic vinegar but found this very bland. We ended up dicing up the most of it, adding spices to create taco filling.

This was awesome! Everyone love it! I reduced to 1/3 cup the amount of balsamic vinegar as I read in one of the comments and I added 1 tsp of dried parsley, 1 tsp of oregano, 1 tsp of dried orange peel. Also, 1 fresh green onion sliced. The time and temperature were just perfect.

This is delicious. It's super easy, smells great cooking and tastes wonderful. I tossed sweet potatoes and onions with the leftover marinade and cooked them in the same pan. Almost as easy as buying a pre seasoned lori loin, but 100% better.

Although I didn't care for this, I'm giving it four stars because it's a good recipe.  It just care for the outcome. I used a good quality balsamic vinegar but thought it had too much of a vinegar taste - it needed a touch of sweet for my taste

I worked with a fig balsamic vinegar and although the overall taste was good, the pork was too dry. I pulled it at 145 to rest and shaved the pork was it the quality of the pork or the recipe?

I combined this recipe with the roasted  pork butt roast with vegetables recipe.  I made the marinade and rubbed it all over the pork butt (@4-5 lbs) and let it sit for about an hour.  I also made slits in the roast and inserted garlic cloves.  I places it in my slow cooked and sliced a whole onion on top, and cooked it on high for about 6 - 7 hours.  I used a combination of chicken broth and water to fill the slow cooker about two thirds full.  After four hours I added cubed potatoes and carrots.  As it cooked, I tasted the juice and added a bit of seasoned salt and pepper.  The meat was very tender, tasty and juicy = YUM.

Flavor was terrible. I marinated it overnight and after it came out of the oven I had to rinse it off and just dip it in BBQ sauce.

Very good.  Very easy.  2 lb loin good for 4 adults, with a little left over.  Took longer than 1 hr to cook, though.

Amazing taste, tender, moist, nicely glazed "crust" on the outside. Marinated in the baking dish overnight. I had big 5 lb loin, it cooked beautifully, kept eye on on meat thermometer,  don't remember how long it took, over an hour but removed at 145'  Sauce on mashed potatoes was yummy.

I made this last night and my husband loved it.  After reading the reviews I added green beans to roast and made a meal in one pan.  I only had four hours for it to marinate so the next time I make it I will marinate it over night.  It has a wonderful favor and is so easy to make.

I usually cook about 4 lbs of meat (2 pork loins). I end up using about 1/2 cup of steak seasoning, 1 cup of balsamic vinegar, and 1/2 cup olive oil. I marinate it overnight for extra flavor. Cook for about 35-40 minutes to an internal temperature of 140.  I've made this several time and it's delicious!

Very tasty & moist.  I followed the recipe but cooked it for eight hours in a slow cooker after marinating overnight.  Definitely a keeper!

My wife and I both loved it. The only correction I have is the same as mentioned in some other comments -- it has a little too much olive oil. Next time I make it I'll use half as much oil as balsamic vinegar.
Changes I made: I didn't have steak rub on hand, but I do know how to make it so I made my own from a little salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, Herbs de Provence, cumin, and smoked paprika. I also added a couple of teaspoons of soy sauce. 
And by the way I didn't notice the excessive vinegar smell mentioned by others. It was an excellent recipe.
UPDATE: I take back the comment about too much olive oil. I saw a video about this recipe after my critique and realized that the point is to make an emulsion by gradually stirring the olive oil into the vinegar. In an emulsion the oil is not so visible, and a 50/50 ratio of vinegar to oil is about right. So my amended criticism is that the recipe directions should be clear that you're making an emulsion. Also, emulsions generally require an emulsifier such as Dijon mustard, so that would be a good addition to the recipe.

I made this for our family New Years Day dinner. As written, absolutely fabulous. I can't believe how such simple ingredients can combine to make a plain pork loin taste so amazing! The whole family was blown away by how yummy it was. I agree with another reviewer who said buy good quality basalmic vinegar. It makes all the difference.

My husband tried this recipe thinking wow he's being inventive.... urghhhh nope! this is a fail.... sorry.... I wouldn't try this recipe if i were you... He did use good quality vinegar and yes the smell was strong and awful... not a nice smell at all....

Made this for Christmas dinner using the "Everything Pork Dry Rub" recipes from AR in place of the steak seasoning rub.  Easy and delicious.  My daughter had made a double batch of her cheesy potato casserole for her in-laws' party, so we had that for our dinner as well.  Just put things in the oven an hour before we wanted to eat, and had a great meal.  May become a new Christmas tradition.

I made this for a dinner party and wasn't sure what to think of it. I could not find the size pork loin that I wanted, so I used a different cut of pork roast. I think it may have been too fatty and might have absorbed too much of the marinade. My guests are it and said they liked it, they even had seconds. I was torn about the taste. My husband did not like it.  I will try it again but will use tenderloin and not a roast cut.

I ended up marinating for nearly 24 hours.  The most tender and moist pork loin I have ever made.  Typically, I am not a fan of pork loin, but this recipe converted me.  Next time, I will probably use more of the steak rub.

I've made this FOUR times and am making it again tonight.  The loin is SO tender and moist.  The marinade is absolutely DELICIOUS!  I've bought the loin from COSTCO.  The package comes with TWO loins so I prepare TWO at the same time.  The EXTRA plus is the quick and easy way  it is prepared.  I DO marinade for 24 hours.  You won't be sorry!

This is pretty good, healthy, simple ingredients, no fillers or garbage - simple taste.  I added some carrots and potatoes when I roasted the pork, a nice added touch and took care of another food group for the meal.  I would make this again.

I tried this recipe exactly as written.  My olive oil and balsamic vinegar were not particularly expensive or new!  The roast was as tender as a baby's bottom.  My husband raved about it.  I can't wait to make it for company.  This is the first recipe I tried that I felt I just had to review.  I highly recommend it.

Very easy to make. I used two Pork Tenderloins, about 3 lbs. total, and it was done perfectly in one hour. 
Next time, I would use less of the marinade in the pan.

I made it a little differently, leaning toward Italian/mediterranean : I skipped the seasoning, and added garlic salt, thyme, and I put half a can of diced fire-roasted tomatoes and a couple of spoonfuls of capers on top of the roast. I also chopped an onion and added it to the pan with about 1/3 cup of red wine, drizzled the whole thing with olive oil.  Amazing, and I didn't even get to marinate it that long.  Added a little water to the pan at the end to get a nice sauce out of it. Served with brown rice and roasted cauliflower. Will pair leftovers with a little pasta and roasted zucchini to change it up.

This is my go-to pork loin recipe.  Absolutely delicious.  I did as one reviewer suggested.  I had added potatoes and carrots to the pork while it was cooking, and after meat was done, I raised the oven temp to 450 and continued roasting the veggies for 15 minutes more. So good!

My pork loin turned out to be two smaller ones that cooked faster than expected.  I should have compensated for that, but the pork was still tender and very tasty.  We love balsamic vinegar and make our own reductions, which I used for this recipe.  That may have made it a tad more tart than the regular.  

I reduced the juices while the loin rested and added a little half and half to cut back on the acidity.  That wasn't the ideal - the cream separated - but it still made for a nice sauce that everyone enjoyed.  The onions and potatoes I added were very good, as well.  

For us, a sauce finish that is more able to offset the acidity will be the key to an even more popular outcome.

Simple, easy and delicious. I made a few changes: used a pomegranate balsamic vinegar, added a little white pepper and crushed garlic to the marinade.  Wonderful aroma and flavor.

Excellent marinade!  I would cut back the oil to a third cup maybe even a quarter cup heavy!  Marinated for seven hours.  The meat was very tender and juicy!!!  Had mashed potatoes and used the reduced marinade as gravy for the mashed!  Also had carrots and onions cooked together and a tossed salad!  To balance the tartness of the balsamic we had a side of diced chilled mango!

I, the non-cook, made this for my parents a few weeks ago and now for my husband(who usually does all the cooking). The recipe is east and the result delicious!  Made some roasted potatos and steamed veggie.  Easy, even. For me!

Delicious.  The balsamic gives it a great flavor.  Sliced up the leftovers and reheated them I. The sauce and I think it was even better than the first time.

Super easy to make and delicious!  I served this with fig jam as my husband didn't want it quite so "tangy" and it made it incredibly sweet & savory!   Very easy meal that I will make when we have guests - it is that good!

I think the reason some people think it  has too much vinegar flavor is based on the type of basalmic vinegar they choose.  Use a good quality brand and it is super moist and delicious!

Very excellent recipe. The slight sweetness of the vinegar comes through nicely, and is subtle enough that the flavor of the pork is highlighted. instead of the whole 2 Tbsp steak seasoning I did 1.5 and the other .5 cajun spice, because why not.

We wanted a change from our usual pork marinade, so I decided to try this.
 Yummy! It's a good basic recipe that's easily customized to your family's palate. Because of my husband and son, I reduced the balsamic vinegar by half and then added red vermouth and a tablespoon of honey.  After marinating the pork, I tossed onions, potatoes and carrots in the sauce and roasted everything in my big pan for an amazing and easy dinner

Kept the marinade ingredients as written. But I used pork tenderloins, butterflied them, pounded a bit for even thickness. Marinated them for 1/2 a day. Fired up the grill, direct medium, and grilled them 7 minutes on each side. Let them rest for 5 minutes before slicing to serve. Boiled the marinade for a minute or two and drizzled it on the slices before serving. High praise from hubs! Moist, tender, delicious!

Quick, simple  tasty. Relatively short marinating time works well. Flavour result depends on the steak seasoning in my opinion.  Will try different ones to find my favourite combination.

This recipe turned out perfect. I started out at 325 for 45 minutes and it wasn't quite done, so I turned it up to 350 for another 15 minutes. I also used dehydrated onions and minced garlic with my marinade. I should have taken a picture.

Quality vinegar is the key. I also thought the amount of marinade was too generous for a small 2 lb roast so you could adjust as necessary (less marinade or more roast). This was delicious and so quick and easy.

I used Italian balsamic and McCormick Grill Mates steak rub, marinating for 3 hours.  The pork turned out tender and moist.  The flavor was mild but good, I might try adding some minced garlic next time.

I was impressed by how tasty it was given that (1) it's so simple, (2) the pork was in the oven, not the slow cooker. It's definitely making it to my "regularly done" list.

Loved this! I added some "gourmet" Apple Butter to the marinade, and high quality Balsamic; seared the roast in a cast iron frying pan, then followed the recipe.

Our local grocer was having a huge sale on pork tenderloins so I bought the limit. I usually make carnivals or BBQ with them but wanted something different. I had a honey orange blossom infused vinegar so I used it. I thought I had balsamic but didn't and I'm a ways from a store so used what I had. the pork was super tender! sliced it in medallions and laid in the juices while our sides were finishing. You could cut it with a fork! The flavor was amazing. Definitely making again!

Oh my heavens! First time with a pork roast and this was amazing! I skipped the steak rub and just used salt and pepper. I made the drippings into gravy and that made it over the top. My 5 year old even said it was wonderful and ate his whole share. Adding to my favorites for sure.

Soooooo good!  Even after I had unexpected visitors and had to let it sit in the oven, this roast was so moist!!!  The balsamic vinegar was the key to great taste! Made this twice.  First time, followed the recipe exactly and husband and I loved it (that's what I rated as 5 star!).  Second time, used three large onions as a base, mixed with 1/4 c. brown sugar and 1/4 c dry red wine.   Added some lemon pepper, Vegeta seasoning and a T. of Worcestershire sauce. Placed the pork right on top and placed it into the oven.  Dam!  Even better!   Couldn't help playing with the basic recipe, but without my additions the pork was fabulous!  "Try it, you'll like it!"

This was very easy with ingredients I had on hand. The pork was very tender. I should have read the reviews earlier and would have cut back on the vinegar as others suggested.

Having read the reviews and knowing I didn't have a high quality  balsamic on hand,  I decreased the quantity  to 1/4 cup and added some honey.   Used Montreal  Steak Seasoning  and left it to marinade  almost  24 hours .  So moist and yummy!   Threw some Yukon potatoes,  carrots and yellow  onion on the bottom of my covered roasting dish and left those in the oven after I took the pork  out to rest.  Used a meat thermometer  and mine took longer to cook - most likely due to thickness  of my pork and variations  in oven temperature.   Will definitely make  again!

Going into the rotation. Marinated from the afternoon before. Followed the recipe to the T adding a little more garlic. Delicious and full of flavor. Used the trader joes balsamic. Served with rice and peas but next time making garlic mashed potatoes.

1.5 pound pork loin, Cooked it on a small Weber BBQ at med low.  I set it in a foil boat on a small rack in the boat.  Cooked slow and low for about 1.5 hours.  Loved it!  Lean and tender.  I used a good Basalmic vinegar so the taste was perfect!

I made this dish exactly as instructed and loved it.  Great pork dish.  I marinated for over 24 hours to make the  flavours pop!!  Good balsamic vinegar is paramount here.  I will definitely make this again and again.

This was so good and easy.  Followed another's suggestion and added sliced onions, cut up carrots, and new red potatoes to bottom of pan.  They absorbed the good juices and was a tasty meal in a pan..half the potatoes midway through so everything would finish roasting together.  New favorite pork tenderloin recipe.

My husband likes pork loin.  I emphasize "likes".  That is until I made this version.  It is so scrumptious that he now requests it pretty regularly.  It really is very tasty and tender.

I reduced the vinegar just little after reading the other reviews. Not sure it was necessary, the reduction was absolutely delicious and the pork so very tender.  I did use a good quality balsamic vinegar.

We made this and it was easy and delicious. I did add 2 cloves of minced garlic and a little bit of honey, but only marinated for 2-3 hours. We placed it on the BBQ and it came out great. I did not have enough balsamic vinegar so put a little sherry vinegar in. I used trader joe's balsamic vinegar. We are going to have it with salad to round out our meal. We BBQ because to hot to turn on stove.

This is awesome and so easy to make! I done this with green beans and side of long grain brown rice. My boys 11 and 16 gobbled it down and I done a 4 lb roast and they ate sandwiches with leftovers, with out asking. When my boys don't ask for it and eats on their own, the food is awesome.
I also used a themometer

This recipe was so helpful and a lifesaver on a busy evening.  We decided to do an impromptu trip to the zoo and I would miss the whole "making supper" time slot.  I followed this recipe and after looking at reviews and thinking of my kids preferences I added 1/4 cup honey and halved the vinegar.  Marinated for about 30 minutes then threw it in the crock pot with a frozen package of stew vegetables (including potatoes) on high for four and a half hours.  When we got back from the zoo supper was ready and ALL my kids ate it up and asked for more.  That never happens!  Couldn't have been more pleased.

Super easy recipe with ingredients easily found in any kitchen! Tenderloin turned out moist and tender. While cooking  the smell of vinegar was alarming to my teenager but when she took her first bite she was all smiles and devoured her dinner! This will be a go to recipe often!

This was so easy to make, and the whole family loved it.   The meat was pretty juicy, but we liked it more when we dipped the meat in a small bowl of the juice from the pan before eating.  This is going to be a staple in my meal routine!

This was delish. Even the spousal unit said "I don't really care for pork, but that was good!" I used only 1\4 cup of balsamic and added 1\4 cup of sherry (NOT cooking sherry) instead. Not because I dislike balsamic. On the contrary, I use straight balsamic on salad. But because I think sherry with either pork or chicken is the bomb! I normally add it to all recipes for both. Tender and juicy and scrumptious.

DELICIOUS!  This is the best tenderloin recipe I have ever tried! It was moist, tender, and flavorful! I followed the advice of a reviewer and added 1/4 cup of honey. I used Montreal steak seasoning by McCormick and Monari Federzoni balsamic vinegar. We loved it and will definitely make it again! Super easy!

I have never made a pork loin but let me tell this recipe is the best. I wouldn't fix my pork loin any other way. I didn't use any steak rub but I used steak seasoning and it came out great. I made the marinade and let it marinate overnight most likely (12 hrs) and cooked it for 2 hours instead of 1. It came out moist and delicious.

I followed the recipe exactly  and what a delightful meal. I took a chance and fixed it for a small dinner party. It was a hit. We had two slices leftover and it served as a great meal the next evening. Well aged Balsamic vinegar is critical. Don't take any chances by making a substitution on this.

It was absolutely delicious, however, my pork was a little over a pound & I baked it too long so it was dry. But the sauce was yummy. Will make it again and check the temperature often.Be sure to use high quality balsamic vinegar.

I've made this several times in the past. If you find the vinegar smell is to strong, you haven't used a well aged Balsamic vinegar. There is an enormous difference between aged Balsamic vinegar and standard Balsamic vinegar. Brand makes a big difference also.

Great flavor.  I added 1/2c honey, 1tsp garlic and 1tbsp dried basil.  The first time I used a boneless pork loin and the cooking time was much longer than posted.  Second time around I used boneless pork chops and it was a breeze- both marinating the night before.  Great for a week night recipe.  Thanks for the easy and delicious post!!

I followed the recipe as written.  It was very good, a little salty, though--maybe because of the particular steak seasoning I used.  I really liked how easy it was to make.

Amazing!! Added a couple spoons of stone ground mustard to the marinade. Seared on the grill and then followed the oven directions. Checked the temp every 15 minutes. My family loved it!

I don't typically review allrecipes because I change things up quite a bit to suit my tastes.  However, this pork roast was amazing.  I don't care for balsamic so I added half the amount, marinated overnight and roasted on a bed of sliced onions.  This was so delicious!! I will be making this often. Thank you for posting!

EASY marinade, and a tasty dish. BUT my sauce broke. Separated into oil + little brown granules. Any suggestions to prevent this in the future? Not sure what I did wrong.

This is excellent!  I didnt find it vinegary at all.  But I agree with others that the type of balsamic vinegar used could influence the flavour.  Mine was a "middle of the road" brand.  Loved it and will make again.  The most tender pork I have had.  Marinated it 5 hours.

This is one of my favorite go to dinners, even on a weeknight. I do not marinate the meat at all. I add in some dried, minced onion to the sauce and pour it over the pork loin. I turn the oven temp up some and let it cook for 30 minutes. Turn the pork loin over so both sides get the yummy flavor and cook for 30 more minutes. Then check it with a meat thermometer and go from there. When cooking this dish, I think it is important to pay attention to whether your meat cut is pork tenderloin versus a pork loin or roast. A pork tenderloin usually comes packaged as two tenderloins in one package. Get one that is not injected with brine or other seasonings. If you buy a pork loin, it's usually one, wide piece of meat in the package and will take longer than a hour to cook. Very good dish.

Tastes good but basting every 15 minutes is something I would only do for company.  If I made it again, I would sear the pork loin and finish in the oven while reducing the sauce in a pan.

Made EXACTLY as written.  Excellent!  Bravo!  Yummmmmmm (Angels singing).  I prepared the recipe as stated but I cut my roast in half and placed both halves in my Food Saver ® Quick Marinator (2 cycles). Then I placed it in a 350° oven (in a GLASS roasting pan) for just over an hour. My instant-read thermometer registered 150°.  Perfect! I took it out of the oven and loosely tented with foil while I finished the mashed potatoes and Chef John’s Five-Spice Carrots.  Save left overs (if any) to make Chinese Spicy Hot and Sour Soup by MARBALET.   Thank you, Melissa S.! (and Chef John!

I cut the vinegar amount back by 25% after reading some of the reviews. Honestly it smelled of vinegar now and again while cooking but it tasted great and the leftovers were still juicy and tender the next two days.

I've made this a few times. I do something probably a little different each time but it's always great. I few times I've done it at 425 degrees for a shorter time and it's great either way. I always add potatoes, carrots and onions to it for a side. Great dish. Easy recipe which makes it easy to make little tweeks here and there.

I made the marinade as noted and added vegetables (broccoli and potatoes) to the pan when I roasted the meat, which some of the commenters recommended. Everything tasted like vinega. It would have been OK on the meat, but on everything, it was too much. Plus, the flavors of the marinade never melded. I was looking for sweet-and-spicy but I got pepper-vinegar. I used my normal brand of balsamic, which I like in dressing, but it didn't work here.

Made this last night and my mother and I could not get over how tender the pork was - didn't even need a knife to cut and the meat seemed to melt in your mouth.  My picky 5 year old loved it, she even asked for seconds!  This will definitely go in my regular meal rotation.

This roast was delicious and my family gobbled it up.  I used the balsamic vinegar as called for and marinated for 2 hours.  I did not find that it was too sweet (I don't like sweet sauces on meat) and it smelled great while cooking.  I let it cook until my meat thermometer read 170 and it was still very tender and juicy.  I will definitely make it again!

I used McCormicks Montreal Steak seasoning . Could barely taste the vinegar. It came out moist and tender . Doubtful I would remake this ,

Made this for my family last night & it was a hit.  We're a family that loves vinegar based sauces, so I knew this balsamic marinade would be perfect.  Yes my house smelled like vinegar for a couple of hours, but it wasn't anything that opening a window couldn't cure.  Super moist, great flavor and left us wanting more.

Very easy to make.  Amazing flavour.  This  marinade is also great for sirloin beef roasts .  Note:  Use quality balsamic vinegar.

Easy & delicious! Added 3 garlic cloves to marinade and instead of steak seasoning (which I did not have on hand) just did a combo of favorite dried herbs along with some paprika. Also added big onion rings, celery & carrots along with baby potatoes. We put it all into the roasting pan & poured marinade over everything, added 1/2 cup of chicken stock and refrigerated it for 2 hours before roasting. Will probably make this a holiday meal it was so easy!

This was great.  I mixed up a batch of "Steak Dry Rub" from this site (by richlids), and made the marinade just as directed.  I only had an hour to let it sit in the fridge, but still...Delicious!  The balsamic vinegar, oil, and spices reduce to a very wonderful sauce while the meat cooks.

Absolutely love it!!  I mince fresh garlic and onions in addition to the other called for ingredients.  I marinate it overnight.  I cook it in a convection oven @ 20 minutes per pound. Beautiful and delicious!! My new favorite way to cook this type of roast!

Used Montreal Steak Seasoning, medium coating, yellow onions on the bottom, and asparagus on the side.  Was GREAT.  Will probably swap in some potatoes and carrots next time, but will def make again.  Keeper.

So simple to make. Hardest part is remembering to marinade. I had it marinating for about 18 hrs.. I used a larger joint and cooked for 2 hrs. It's a keeper. Used Aldi balsamic vinegar.

Pretty good.  I did substitute 1/4 cup of white wine for 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar.  It was good and everyone seemed to like it but no one was "wowed" by it.  The great thing was that all the ingredients I already had in the house so it was easy to prepare and wasn't overly complicated.

I absolutely adore this recipe, as does my family! I am requested to make this for family dinners. The only change I make is that I add about 1 Tbsp to the marinade. I very much recommend marinating overnight for the best flavor!

I made this even though my husband told me he hates pork; it was on sale at the store. I didn't have time to marinate it so I baked it in a bread pan so the sauce came up higher on its sides. I also cut the top and basted it 2 or 3 times. I used 1/4 c of the vinegar and 1/4 c of Canada Dry. My husband loved it and had seconds!!!

Very easy and very tasty! Let mine sit for an extra day for stronger flavor, added sliced onion to the baking dish, and increased the temperature to 400*F because the dish I had was a little thicker and I know stuff tends to take a little longer to cook in it (so upped the temp instead of the time). Was super tender and so good! Made this wish "Smashed Cauliflower Side Dish" for a healthier meal.

Very easy I only marinated it for 1 1/2 hours because I didn't read the recipe before deciding to make it. It was still very tasty and moist I will make it again and I will be sure to marinate it longer.

We absolutely loved this. The pork was fork tender and the flavour was amazing. I had a very small roast,  just over one  pound, so I halved the recipe. Because of the small size the vinegar didn't caramelize so I poured the drippings in a small pot and added a little red wine and let that reduce while the pork was resting. I seldom make a recipe twice but I can't wait to make this one again. Like so many others have said, a good quality balsamic vinegar is a must. I used http://allrecipes.com/recipe/242012/steak-dry-rub/ for the seasoning rub.

This is fantastic!  The whole family loved it (including two 6-year olds and an extremely finicky husband).  We didn't have any steak seasoning, so I quickly made Johnny's Spice Rub from this site- fantastic by the way.  
We reserved 1/2 cup of the marinade to be used as a sauce.
We roasted the pork on a bed of quartered onions and surrounded the pork with broccoli florets, then poured the marinade on top.  
After about 35 minutes, our roast was already cooked (a little pink in the middle).  We served the pork and veggies with the au jus and drizzled the reserved marinade on top.  
Thank you for sharing this quick and easy and delicious recipe!  We will definitely be making this again.

Made according to directions but used homemade spice rub and half olive oil half veggie oil cause its what I had. Other than that strictly followed recipe and directions. Did not cover during cooking. Basted twice. Pulled from oven after reaching the minimum 145 degrees. Came out super moist and with great flavor. Will def make it again. Easy and delicious.  The vinegar smell is strong as it cooks but mo more bothersome than deep frying food smell. Well worth it.

The only change I made was to add crushed garlic to the marinade. I also added some water and cornstarch to the drippings which made a tasty gravy. A definite keeper.  I layered quartered onions (1 yellow and 1 red) on the bottom of the baking dish  as another reviewer suggested, placing the roast on top. This added a nice flavour to the gravy.

This was the most moist pork I have ever eaten! I let it marinate for 5 hours and cooked it for 1 hr and 5 mins. I thought it was pretty delicious but my boyfriend said the cook was fabulous but it seemed to taste like soy sauce. I will definitely cook this again with an altered marinade. Happy cooking

Easily one of the best dishes I've ever made! So simple and so delicious. I made it exactly as written and loved it, though next time I will decrease the amount of steak seasoning a bit because it was a little salty and spicy for my preference. Didn't stop me from loving it though! I roasted potatoes and carrots to go with it and used the sauce from the roast to drizzle over the potatoes also.  Yum!

This was so easy to put together, and just delicious. I did not have overnight for marinating, so it was a quick 4-5 hours in the bag in the fridge, but it came out so tender and delicious. We sliced it very thin and served with tortillas and grilled veggies, fajita style to a big group. Outstanding, great Super Bowl meal. Will make again for sure.

Ive made many dishes with recipes from AR but this is one of my all-time favorites!  Special mention to "Angie E" here on AR  for her suggestions, (well worth the read) as they made the dish even better (Ive made this 3 times now, varying from the original after the first time).  

I used a nice quality balsamic, and the fragrance from this meal was *amazing* in our home as it was cooking.  Next time I'm going to try broiling the pork for the last 10 minutes or so to get the skin to be more crispy.  Thanks for a great recipe, this is definitely going into rotation!

Very good. Agree with chellebelle, the balsamic is the most important flavor of the glaze/marinade.

Great recipe!  incredibly most and perfectly flavored. Followed the exact recipe  (so easy). Don't be deceived by the strong vinegar smell as it cooks,  it is not overpowering when you eat it.

The marinade was delish but it only effected the outside. This recipe would work best with a long and skinny loin.

I simply followed the recipe and it was perfect! I did use a very good quality balsamic vinegar though. Definitely one of the best pork loins I've ever eaten!

This recipe was amazingly quick and simple.  The roast was extremely moist and flavorful.  I used steak seasoning that did not have a high salt content.  My husband (who usually doesn't care much for pork) thought this was delicious!  Definitely a recipe for any occasion (family or company).

I love pork loin.  I find it to be very versatile as well as economical.  It is very lean, so the right recipe can make or break it.  We generally buy a whole loin and cut it to suit for roasts, chops, etc.  With a piece cut for "roast", I generally smoke it or make a pork pot roast on top of the stove.  

I really took a chance on this!  Not only do I generally not make oven roasts, I also tried out the oven in our new 5th wheel for the first time with this recipe.  I had no idea how true the oven temp would be and did not have a thermometer with which I could test the "trueness" of the temp of the new oven.
I followed the marinade recipe exactly using "better" quality balsamic and olive oil.  Marinated a 3 lb. roast for about 8 hours.  For the "steak seasoning" I opted for Butt Rub.  I think next time I'll use Montreal Steak just because I think that the difference in seasoning taste will be better.  Actually, plain old salt, pepper and garlic would be great.

I left the fat cap on the pork.  The recipe did not address this, but some recipes specify that you trim the fat off.  Leaving it on helps keep the roast moist and adds flavor.  It took about 2 hours for the 3 lb. roast to register 145 degrees with a meat thermometer.   While it was cooking, I thought it smelled wonderful, but hubby came in from outside and said "it smells funky in here".   Well, so do broccoli and Brussels sprouts when they are cooking and they taste great!  Balsamic is balsamic!  It DOES have a dist

Made this tonight. Whole family enjoyed it, as the other reviewers had said. I added three cloves garlic, pressed in garlic press, garlic "juices" added as well. I think next I will split the balsamic vinegar with apple juice, with the remaining ingredients the same.

I used a Cranberry and Pear White Balsamic for this recipe, rather than a traditional one.  I think it added a tasty, subtle flavor of cranberry and pear to the sauce, which I drizzled over the pork on our plates.  It was delicious; I may try other balsamic flavors when making this recipe again!

Based on reading the reviews, I added garlic and reduced the Olive oil to 1/4 cup. It was the juiciest, tastiest pork I have had in a longtime, and better than any pork I personally have ever made. It is a keeper. Super easy, yet nice enough for company. I wondered if those who complained about the smell of vinegar was using Balsamic Vinegar versus regular vinegar or substituted a apple cider vinegar or red wine vinegar. Good balsamic vinegar is mild and smooth and taste great.

My husband and I both loved it. I think the advice from another reviewer about using a good balsamic right on. Any good recipe is dependant upon using quality ingredients.  The mess in the dish would have been a difficult cleanup without letting it sit in baking soda and boiling water for a bit.

I made this tonight for my family and it was really good, but I will make changes the next time to improve the over all result. I cooked a 3 lb pork loin roast and increased the cooking time accordingly. I used the recommended marinade portions for the 2 lb roast and it was more than adequate. I marinated the roast for 4 hours before cooking. My only addition this time was 2 cloves of minced garlic.  While the flavor was really nice, and the roast was moist, the marinade never became thick and truly sauce like. It was also much too greasy. I added quartered new potatoes 1/2 way through cooking and when I pulled the roast out to rest for 10 minutes I continued cooking the potatoes and increased the temperature to 450. 
Next time I plan to add the garlic again, add a tablespoon of honey and cut the olive oil in half.  I will probably marinate overnight and cook on top of a layer of sliced vidallia onions as other reviewers suggested.
Quick and easy. I'm glad to have this recipe!

Loved, loved, loved this recipe! So flavorful and easy to make. I definitely think the quality of balsamic vinegar makes a difference in the outcome of the dish. Don't get the cheapest you will miss out on a lot of flavor that way.

Great recipe. The first time I made this I thought it was heavy on the balsamic vinegar and overdone, so I have made a few tweeks. I have cut back the balsamic vinegar from 1/2 cup to 1/3 cup and decreased the cooking time to 45 minutes. Perhaps it is the size of the tenderloin I used, but it came out perfect on the second go around.

Yummy! I marinated it about 4 hours and actually forgot to baste it until the last 15 minutes. I preferred it cut in thin strips. We had it over fettuccine noodles and alfredo sauce.

Followed the recipe with the only exception being I added garlic (4 cloves) and Montreal chicken spice. While it was cooking the hubby kept turning up his nose at the vinegar smell and giving  subtle hints how I had "ruined"  the dinner party (all guests were his family members lol). Once I served the roast everyone including  hubby loved the pork roast. The vinegar smell was all gone 30-40 min into cooking. Great recipe thank you!.

This was wonderful and the aroma while cooking had everyone's mouth watering for the final product. It did take longer to cook than posted but it could be my oven or thermometer. Husband said this was a keeper so I will be making again! Thanks for the recipe.

I made the recipe exactly as written and it was excellent - moist and full of flavor. I used a good quality balsamic vinegar and it wasn't vinegary at all. I only marinated the pork loin for a little over an hour, but imagine that marinating it longer would only make it even more flavorful. I will definitely make this again!

UPDATE: I made it for a second time today and marinated it all afternoon. Marinating it longer really made a difference - it was very good last time and absolutely delicious this time. My 6-yr. old grandson's comment was, "This is even better than pizza!" Praise doesn't come any higher than that!

I had a dinner party for seasoned cooks and they raved about this recipe.  The pork was flavored perfectly, moist and DELICIOUS!!  The secret is using a high quality basalmic and  extra olive oil.

My 7 year old daughter loved this and she can be hard to feed at times! ? She said "Mmmmm I love this! ... and for once it's not overcooked" Cheeky pup!  But she's probably right, I'm not the best cook but this was easy. 

I added some garlic to the marinade because I love garlic but otherwise didn't change anything.

I would cut cook time back 5 - 10 mins next time. I added the same amounts of ingrediants to a 4# loin and it was good for us.

I make this often (exactly as written), especially in the winter. Make sure to use GOOD QUALITY Balsamic Vinegar. It gives the meat a sweet, slightly tangy taste and doesn't make your house smell terrible.

I love this dish. It has been my go-to potluck showstopper ever since I found the recipe on allrecipes.com. So simple in its ingredients yet so rich in flavor once done. The secret is in the slow cooking over low heat -- 350F. The right balance of balsamic vinegar  -- and yes, invest on the milder, pricey kind -- and olive oil to your liking, will do the trick. The first time you try it, just do 2/3 of vinegar. I use 2 lbs of pork loin and follow this measurement. I also replaced the steak rub with the McCormick burger onion rub and a bit of thyme. I garnish with slices of pear and then drizzle with the juice from the roast. Marvelous.

Nice and simple, but I modded it.  I can't make myself cook with expensive salad-quality balsamic or olive oil, and don't use steak mixes.   I mixed quarter cups of cheap balsamic and OO, added splash of soy sauce,  Heinz ketchup, some red chili and cayenne flakes to offset the vinegar.   Lined a baking tin with foil to avoid cleanup.  Good.

Delicious!  The whole family loved it.  Try to get some of the balsamic to stay on top when you cook it.  It formed a glaze during cooking and was the best part :).

Love this super easy prep so much and so do my kids! I don't much measure the marinade anymore, and I do add dried rosemary. Other than that, that's it! It's easy and you don't have to marinade for 2 hours. I have done just 30mins when in a pinch.

This was absolutely delicious!!  It actually marinated for 4 days, which was not intentional as I was ill. Made it last night and I did lay the pork over a bed of thick cut sweet onions. (Another viewers suggestion).  I will definitely make this again and again.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!!

Awesome. I used a really high quality balsamic-maple vinegar and high quality butter olive oil and topped it with bacon. I marinated it over night.  I cooked the bacon just a bit before putting it on top right before I put it in the oven. It turned out so juicy and delicious.

Very tasty and has good flavor.  I've made it in the crockpot and its moist and falls apart.  I've also made in the oven and I think I prefer it in the oven over the crockpot, though my boyfriend prefers the crockpot version.  I made it for a group of 15 and they all loved it and asked for the recipe.  I highly recommend this recipe and will be making it again soon.

Excellent recipe! Simple and delicious. Made exactly as written except for placing roast on a bed of sliced onions and cloves of garlic. Used my thermometer and took it out of the oven at exactly 145°. It was perfect.

This is really good! I did reduce vinegar too a 1/3 of a cup though and added dried rosemary. Couldn't imagine it without the rosemary. This comes from a woman's husband who can't stand vinegar. I was kinda worried thought well I can run out and get something if it doesn't work.  But he loved it. Told me make sure you poor those juices over the meat before you put it away.  Never told him its balsamic vinegar. Thought I'll just keep that my secret. ??

I made this exactly like the recipe called for with one exception--I had Apple basalmic vinegar -which is what I used.  Everything else was the same. I used WildTree Rancher Steakrub and marinated it for about four hours after which baked it in my cast iron Dutch oven for approximately 50 minutes. I took it from the oven and allowed it to set for approximately seven minutes and then lifted the lid. It. Was. Amazing!  Perfectly moist. Perfectly tender. Perfect! I have never had a pork tenderloin turn out so well-so moist and this will be my new "go to"recipe.

I have never written a review on here but this recipe deserves the highest praise! I've been making it for 3 years - sometimes as often as once a week. My family loves it and its soo easy! I throw it in the marinade in the morning and then have an easy dinner. 

My only modifications are that I use a Fig Balsamic Vinegar instead of regular and that the time is less if you cook two smaller roasts (like the two-pack from Costco) at once. I use a meat thermometer but it usually takes around a 30-40 minutes.

This one is definitely worth a try!

Loved this recipe.  I made it as instructed but ended up marinating almost 24 hours and it was fantastic.  Did not think it too vinegary at all.  The marinade, combined with the drippings made for a delicious, thin gravy.
So easy, so good.  Make this one - you won't be disappointed!

I made this as written, but  took the advice of others and placed the pork loin on top of sliced onion.  I also placed carrots along side of the roast. This was a very good. But, I usually make pork loin in the slow cooker for low fat barbecue and that is still my favorite way to use a pork loin. I might make this again.

Such a simple recipe, but oh so good.  There was no strong vinegar smell.  I just used some balsamic vinegar I had on hand.  This roast was delicious.  I followed the recipe as written.  Marinated the meat overnight.  But I cooked in slow cooker on low for 6 hours.   Next time I will add a gravy mix to make a thicker gravy.

This was delicious! I've made this several times and it always comes out great! It should never taste like vinegar! A good balsamic vinegar should taste sweet! I've even taken a whole bottle of balsamic, from Costco, and reduced it by half. I've used it on chicken, strawberries, and on salads. You could drink this. It was that good!

My family loved this. The only change I made was added 2 cloves of garlic and in the last 15 min I turned up the heat to 375. I used my Dutch oven. This was simple and delicious! Thank you.

A - ma - zing!  I would add garlic and make gravy next time, as some other reviewers did, but as is it is delicious.  And the recipe could not be easier.  Some of our guests who aren't fans of pork liked it.

This was just fabulous! I did add some white wine. I peeled and chopped potatoes and put them around the edges. My family all gave it five stars, and my youngest son was disappointed the star system only went up to five, as he deemed it a ten star recipe! :) It was really great served with steamed rainbow carrots and a can of pears, actually, as I couldn't find any applesauce. Wonderful! Highly recommend this.

This. Was. Delicious!!!  The meat turned out so moist and flavorful, and with this wonderful, MILD zing from the vinegar. (Not a basic vinegar zing, just a really nice flavor zing.) Followed the recipe as written, except I cooked it a little longer.  I was actually worried I overlooked it a little, but I think the vinegar kept it really moist. I had a special steak seasoning I get from a spice store in WI, and it was perfect for this. Definitely a keeper and will be making it often. Thank you so much for sharing this!

We made this & it's ok, the balsamic flavor is there, it's not overbearing but I feel it needed some other spices in general for more flavor. As for temp of 145, we used a probe & taking the meat out @ 135deg is recommended & definitely allowing to rest for the 10 min as stated as ours rose 15 deg AFTER removing from our toaster oven that we used & worked quite well. We marinated for 2 days & slightly tenderized the pork loin, which I would do again because it seems larger pieces of meat need this in order to absorb the marinate.

Simple and very tasty.  Was concerned with the vinegar being too strong but that wasn't the case.  I may add a little minced garlic next time.

I didn't have enough steak seasoning so I used McCormick's roasted garlic & herb seasoning. The roast was so flavorful, juicy and tender. The picky kids loved it, as well. Score!

we got mileage from this dish. I made it extra sauce and used it over my roasted broccoli and served it with the smashed potatoes on the site. It was a great meal, everyone agreed.

My husband loved this. He said to give it 4.5 because 5 would be hard to reach unless perfect and nothing is. 

I found it very easy to make, using the foil on bottom of baking dish and I'm glad I did as the glaze did get sticky and burn in some places. I only had a 1# pork tenderloin so I used 1/2 of the ingredients. Next time I will use the full amount so we have more juices for basting and serving. Will def make this again. . Thanks

I am big time Costco fan. I used Kirkland balsamic vinegar, Kirkland olive oil, McCormick Montreal steak seasoning and Swift premium boneless pork loin. All ingredients from Costco.
Marinaded overnight.  
I set convection oven at 340 for roast and set prob for 145. 
Dlicioso!!!
Very good with Charleston’s Slatherin’ Sauce also from Costco

Wonderful recipe, thank you.  I did add 2 cloves of garlic minced on my zester after reading other reviews (so mine was a five ingredient recipe) but followed the rest of the recipe and it was great.  Next time I'll take it out at 135-140 degrees.

Made this with a 7.5lb pork loin. Doubled the marinade for it. Marinated overnight. Cooked at 375 in roasting pan for 45minutes, then for about 30minutes at 425. Center temp was 147degrees. It was a rush job because of hungry children, but guess what? It was fantabulous! Very moist and the kids loved it. Thank you!!!!

Even though I tried to add some spices to it to give it more life, I will not tell you what I did because it failed miserably!  The pork was still good but, following the recipe would have made it great.  In the future, I may add a touch of garlic but, that is all.

I did cook this in a slow cooker on low for eight hours with excellent results on the meat.  My oven temperature is unintelligable and usually very high, so the slow cooker was probably the most intelligent step that I took!

Simple, succulent sassy solution to the question, "What am I gonna do with this pork loin in my fridge that's about to expire?"  Minutes to make the marinade, bag it, marinate it, into the oven for an our and voila... best of all its tender, moist, sweet and a major hit with the fam.  Definitely worth the upgrade from a last minute desperation effort to a planned mainstay in our pork repertoire.  I will say that the better the basalmic and the more time in marinade the sweeter the smiles. Oh, I used Webbers Steak and chop rub... Yumm!

Great recipe!  I made my own steak seasoning, from this website. Based on other reviews, I added 2 minced cloves of garlic to the marinade, and after marinating, I sliced some yellow onions to lay in the pan under the roast.  It did take a little longer to cook - about 20 minutes extra or so.  Use your meat thermometer!

AWESOME!! This is my new pork loin recipe. I've made it several times and it's perfect. I typically add veggies in with it. I also add some garlic and honey. Tonight I'm trying it in the slow cooker. I did add some chicken stock for the slow cooker.

My family loves this recipe. It's very easy to make. Marinate pork tenderloins for 1-2 days. Sear the loins before baking. Bake at 350F for 40-45 minutes to reach internal temp of 150 degrees.  Instead of steak seasoning in the marinade I mix up salt, black pepper and Lawrys Seasoned Salt. NOTE: Use 1/4-1/3 cup balsamic (1/2 cup is too much). Add worcestershire to marinade. Serve with rice or potatoes, green beans, cooked carrots and sautéed apples.

I love this recipe. It's so easy and the flavor is so good. Both of my kids (8 years and 5 years) love it, and they are picky eaters - especially my 5 year-old! I make the recipe as is. I usually make a 1 pound tenderloin, so I halve the ingredients. It has become a regular part of the meal rotation. Thanks!

This is a great piece of meat! My only suggestion is to buy name brand olive oil.. I bought meijer brand olive oil the second time and you could tell the difference.. It wasn't as good..however it is a really quick and delicious entree..

First time I made it it was perfect...the second time I covered it with foil (eh wrong answer) and added too much balsamic.  I'll go back to original w/o any changes.

This is wonderful if use a very good balsamic vinegar.  One with a bit of sweetness.  I also always add garlic but that is just by personal preference. It is very good and easy without.

Wow, it's super easy and delicious! I didn't have steak seasoning so I substituted a tablespoon of taco seasoning and a tablespoon of seasoning salt and it was great. It took longer than an hour to cook but I marinated it overnight in the fridge and should have taken it out this afternoon to warm to room temperature.

It was very bland even after marinating overnight.  We had to dip the pork back into the gravy as we were eating it and all I could taste was the balsamic vinegar.

I have made this several times and every time it comes out amazing! A high quality balsamic vinegar is key, and making sure NOT to overcook it. Pork can (and should in a lot of cases) be eaten more rare. Probably my favorite marinade recipe for pork loin. I rarely use anything else.

I LOVE this recipe and have made it many times!  Super easy and definitely would serve this at a dinner party.  This recipe is perfect as is but sometimes I add a couple cloves of minced garlic, some rosemary, and some honey to the marinade. I serve it with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.  One tip I have is to let your pork loin rest on the counter in the marinade for a couple of hours before roasting.  Shortens roasting time and allows for more even cooking.

Followed the recipe to the letter:  couldn't be easier, or tastier.  It did smell quite a bit of vinegar as it cooked but the balsamic is sweet and gave an incredible flavor.  Thanks.

The best pork loin I've ever cooked. I browned the meat first in olive oil in my dutch oven, then added couple cloves chopped garlic. Added 1 cup water to the rest of the ingredients, covered and roasted for a little over an hour. Was excellent.( I also soaked the loin in seasoned brine over night to add moisture and flavor). The aroma was wonderful, but we love balsamic anything!

My family really enjoys this recipe.  I prepare the tenderloin as written, however, I do cook it a bit differently. After marinating, I brown the meat quickly in my cast iron skillet with a little olive oil. Then I place the whole thing in my oven to finish for about 25 min. I did cook once as written and my balsamic burned in the baking dish...we now discard the marinade and cook as I described.

I don't know what I do wrong but my pork, every cut, always comes out tough.  Still a little pink in the middle. I think a 48 hour marinade would be even better.

If you think this is vinegary, you are using the wrong balsamic vinegar. You can't get the $5 bottle and think it will work. Added garlic to this and it was perfect.

Both my husband and I thought this was super! I made it exactly as in the recipe with one exception. I sliced (not peeled) potatoes in 3/4" slices and added to the bag with the marinade and pork. The potatoes browned and cooked as the pork roasted. That really made for an easy meal.

I enjoyed this dish very much.  I have made it several times now. Key is to make sure you cook the down the sauce enough or it does not taste as good.  I added mushrooms to the sauce a couple of times which was also a good flavor.
It takes a bit more time then some crockpot recipes with a bit more pre and post prep but if you have the extra time I think it is worth the effort. Recommend it!  I severed it with mash potatoes and once with rice both worked well.

My family loved this! I made it just as written only my loin was a little over 3 pounds so baked it for 1 1/2 hours. It was perfect and moist. I served it wit Chef John's Syracuse salt potatoes and roasted asparagus. It was a restaurant quality meal.

This was amazing!  I followed the recipe pretty exactly except I let it marinate for a lot longer.  The fat actually solidified but I just poured it in with the meat and it turned out awesome.

I was a little annoyed at first since the steak rub brand or composition was not specified. I generally ignore recipes that call for ambiguous ingredients. However, one reviewer stated that s/he used Adobo spice mix (thanks to whomever that was). I happened to have that on-hand and used the same along with minced garlic which was also recommended by the same person (I used five cloves). I used an good quality aged balsamic and marinated overnight. I also substituted avocado oil for the olive oil just because I worry about olive oil breaking down in the heat. We cooked it in our little Hamilton Beach countertop oven on 250 degrees convection setting until internal temp of 145 degrees. And actually olive oil would not have been a problem at 250, but I pretty much always cook with "refined", high heat avocado oil. Personally I would not use olive oil at 350 though. The roast came out perfect; extremely tender and very tasty but it took at least 2 hours for a 3 1/4 lb roast. I'm glad I didn't blow off this recipe. I agree with others who said to avoid using a cheap balsamic if possible because it will be more tart and probably less flavorful. But who knows; I have not tried the cheaper stuff which I do also buy as I cannot afford the good stuff for every use.

We loved this recipe! I had a 3 pound roast, but did not change the ingredient amounts, and I still had plenty of marinade. I marinated the roast for about 3 hours. The cook time was a little over an hour to bring it to 145 degrees. It came out beautifully tender with a nice flavor that was not at all vinegary. 
I used a Serrano Honey flavored balsamic. YUM!

This is our favourite marinade for pork loin, but we have also used it for lamb leg and beef.  It is delicious and the whole family loves it.  Don't change a thing!!!

I have made this recipe a number of times. Both in the oven and on the grill. The key is to use very high quality Balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil. I keep thinking I have not reached the full potential of this recipe because I have not hit on the just right rub.

Loved it! Only problem I had was I read other reviews and one suggested foil over top. I did this and after an hour was only at 115 degrees. I will not cover next time. Oh yeah put the onion slices on bottom and worked great. Thew in some carrots and julienne zucchini and the sauce really made them tasty. Will make again.

I don't know why everyone raves about this recipe.  It has no flavor!  I  used a pork loin and if I ever made it again I would use the tenderloin or bone in pork roast for more flavor and fat but I don't think I would make it again.  i did not even serve it for dinner guests tonight.  Fortunately I cooked it and tasted it ahead of time, no way would I serve it.  I sliced it and put it in the ref, will see if it tastes better tomorrow or will find some way to make pulled pork.

This was amazing, and very easy to make. I love anything vinegar. My 8 year old absolutely loved it.  My husband said it was "good but not his favorite" but he's partial to fried and overly cooked things.  I followed the recipe exactly, then sauteed some Portobello musrooms in butter and added them the last 10 minutes of cooking. Will definitely make this again, especially since I have most ingredients on hand already.

So I just put this in a baggy with the meat and it is marinating. I am not going to be able to marinate for the full two hours. So I will give 1.5. My family is not a fan of balsamic vinegar, so I cut that part in half. I added the honey as quite a few people seemed to like that. A bit of red pepper flakes for some heat and hopefully to counter act the vinegar. I am praying to god that this turns out well as I have an extremely picky husband. I have also cut up some potatoes that I will throw in the pan as well.

Delicious! I only had fig vinegar on hand and it came out wonderful. Used an almost 6 lbs loin and cooked for just over two hours. Doubled the marinade and that was plenty. Will be making this again for sure.

I would give this recipe six stars if I could, it is honestly one of the best recipes I have gotten off this site (Worlds best lasagna would the the other).  The only thing I changed was to add a couple tablespoons of honey to the marinade. My husband wanted to grill it, but I am so glad I decided to bake it in the oven instead. Two main recommendations for making this: if you are an onion fan, you will definitely want to put sliced onions in the pan while baking. The are soooo good served over the pork slices. Second, serve this with some type of bread or dinner rolls,  my family loved dipping the bread in the juices.....so incredibly good.  I baked a two lb. pork loin, half the time cover with foil, half without.  At the one hour point my thermometer read 120 so I kicked the Temp up to 375, but be careful, it cooked quickly at that point, getting up to almost 160 before I took it out (wanted to get it out at 145). It still was tender and not overcooked. This will probably be the only way I cook pork loin from now on, so simple with restaurant quality results.

This was delicious.  I used a garlic olive oil and a mission fig balsamic vinegar.  The pork loin was almost 4 pounds but I did not increase the marinade.  I will be making this again.  My family all gave it 5 stars.

This turned out pretty well. I didn't have steak seasoning, so used garlic powder, chili powder, salt, and pepper. I poked the roast with serving fork all around so the marinade could get into the meat and marinated for about 3 hours. Cooked at 350F but it wasn't quite done at an hour, about 125 degrees F, so I let it go for another 20 minutes or so. That got it up to about 150, so I was worried I had overdone it. But no, it was still tender and just moist. Any longer and it would have been dry. The flavor was good, with the balsamic neither overpowering nor boring.

Wonderful! Be sure to use good quality balsamic vinegar and olive oil.  I used Montreal Steak Seasoning and this is so delicious!

Great flavor. I didn't use steak seasoning though. I opted for sea salt, fresh black pepper, and rosemary as my seasoning mixture.

I cannot believe how good this was!  I am not a big fan of pork loin so I was beyond impressed with this recipe.  I made this with Prime Rib for a holiday dinner.  I actually cooked it, refrigerated it, and then reheated in the oven when I needed to serve.  It wasn't dried out at all.  I didn't baste the pork loin but instead just turned it over ever 20 minutes and then spooned the juice over the cut up slices of loin.  It was extremely messy to clean up but I didn't care - it tasted that good!

I've been making this since Dec 2012. Each and every time, it has come out perfectly. Yes, my house has an  almost overwhelming odor of vinegar while it is roasting. The taste is always great, and it's always very tender. I've marinated it overnight, sometimes for just a few hours and always get the same results.

Loved it!  We added the fresh minced garlic, but subbed out chives with dill weed and mint flakes. 
My family was so excited to eat, that asked to sit around the big dinner table. :-) thank you so much!

I loved this recipe and it was a big hit with the family. Half way through I drained half of the vinegar mixture and then placed it back on the oven. I also lined the bottom of the baking dish with one large onion thinly sliced.   It made a great topping  for the sliced pork.

This is a great recipe. Easy, flavorful, and light, much better than the molasses and mustard. I poured the marinade off before baking, and basted the pork every 10-15 minutes. Also, I only cooked mine for 45 minutes, and it was perfect. Love this recipe!

This recipe was ok. My husband and I didn't like the combination of the steak seasoning and basalmic vinegar.  However, it was moist and edible.

This recipe is a keeper!   I tried it and whole family loved it.  I cooked the  roast on top of sliced onions and put halved baby carrots on the side of the loin roast.   The onions and carrots cooked along with the pork and made for a savory side for the meat.  Added some baked taters  and dinner was done.

This was so incredibly easy to make! Uea the vinegar smell was strong at first, but it fades. The meat was very tender and the marinade made just a little bit of a crust on the outside. I will be making this again.

This was easy and delicious. I added some honey to the marinade and also a layer of thickly sliced onions to the pan for the roast to sit on. My company raved about it. ..so tender ...so yummy. A keeper.

Simple and tasty recipe for a crowd or it's great for leftovers. I did add garlic and brown sugar or honey to tone down the vinegar. Better vinegar requires less sugar.

I loved this.  The only change I made was to put some thick slices of onion and some cut up potatoes under the roast.  I used Carli Balsamic Vinegar of Modena P.G.I. and it was perfect.

I made this recipe for my family, and they loved it. The meat was tender and juicy, and the marinade was perfect for this type of meat. The only thing I did different was I put 3 tbsp of the steak seasoning and I used a 1/4 cup of the olive oil instead of 1/2 cup. I highly recommend this recipe for dinner, and its going in my recipe box to be a regular addition.

It was okay.  Cook with Balsamic a lot.  The taste added to the pork loin was disappointing.  Cooked to 145 degrees, the new temperature the pork industry recommends.  I didn't keep the recipe.

I made this recipe for dinner the other night.  The only variation was that I only marinated it 1 hour prior to cooking.  The overall flavor of the meat was excellent but the outer edges of the meat had a slightly more vinegary taste than we prefer.  Will definitely make again but will only use a 1/4 c. up the balsamic vinegar.

I had 2 packages of  pork loin tips on hand and loved it more than the whole Loin that would need to be sliced. I added 3 Tbs. Honey  and 8 cloves of Chopped Garlic  to the marnInade, reseasoned the tips before putting into the oven with a tent for 45 mins on 350 and removed the tent and cooked another 12 mins on 450 to get that amazing color caramelized flavor.... It was butter soft and the most amazing piece of pork I've  ever made!! TY for all the  great tips!! :)

Wow! This was the easiest, most juicy pork recipe I've ever made!
My boyfriend specifically said he hates pork and he loved it! I only marinated mine for 2 hours and it turned out perfect! I had a 1.2 lb tenderloin and it was cooked PERFECT in 45 mins.

I buy whole pork loins at Costco, and chop them into roasts. I used this marinade to put on one of the loins before I froze it. It comes out exceptionally moist and tender with plenty of flavor. I always make my own pork seasoning blend so as to avoid hidden MSG or other neurotoxins hidden in seasoning blends.

I made a while ago. I ended up doubling the recipe because I had a 4 pound loin. I didn't have enough Montreal Steak Seasoning so I used seasoned salt as well, half and half basically. It came out wonderful. My fiance and toddler loved it. My fiance loved it so much that he ate it cold for a couple days. Even reheated it wasn't dry. I'm currently trying it in the crockpot today, so hopefully it turns out just as great.

I went by recipe and marinated for 24 hours and I'm not sure why it came out somewhat dry. Temp was 160 and had great flavor. ..just drier than I thought it would be.

Considering the hubs loves anything drowned in steak rub or balsamic, this went over very well.  What I liked even more was how EASY it was to prepare.  Throw it in a bag to marinate, then throw it in a pan to cook.  Not a whole lot more preparation involved for a delicious meal!  Very mom friendly when you'd rather be playing with your kiddos than slaving in the kitchen.

I had 2 lbs of a 4 lbs pork loin roast that I used for this recipe .. I marinated for 4 to 5 hours and roasted it as suggested with some baby red potatoes and carrots .. the roast itself came out fork tender and was a hit with the family .. will make again but try marinating it overnight ..

This is the second time I make this and I love it.  This time I marinated overnight and put in the oven at 350 degrees along with new potatoes and baby carrots all in the same pan covered with aluminium foil.  I roasted for one hour and then took the meat out to rest.  While meat was resting I increase oven temperature to 450 degrees to roast the veggies further.  It made a one pot meal.  Yum :-)

This was great, and so easy! I added a little garlic and dijon mustard to the marinade to help emulsify it and add some flavor. I also used Pomegranate balsamic vinegar because I happened to have some. I roasted it in my convection toaster oven on 350 for about 55 minutes, until the temp read 140 (really you don't need to cook it to 160!) and it was perfect. We loved the sauce!

I love balsamic vinegar so I thought this recipe was amazing. I used this as a last minute recipe so I didn't marinate it, instead I poured the marinade mix in some foil and baked the pork in a foil pouch. I can't wait to marinate it!

This is delicious!!! We added a little garlic to the marinade and served it with a balsamic reduction sauce that we grab from the grocery store. It's easy and a go to for serving guests.

My family was impressed with this dish! It was simple.. didn't need any add-ons. I did this to a pork butt roast. We took advice and bought a good Balsamic vinaigrette cooked until it was tender! Everyone could smell it and couldn't wait for it to be done. Thanks for sharing!

Yummy!!  I didn't have any balsamic vinegar so substitued with red wine vigegar+splenda.  I also omit oil completely to cut some calories.  I didn't meant to but ended up marinating the meat over night and it taste VERY YUMMY!!!

Wow. This is a delicious roast that is so easy. I added about 2 tbsp of honey as someone else suggested. I really like to combination of balsamic vinegar and honey but I think this would be good without that addition. I marinaded this over night and when I put it into the pan to cook I threw in some potatoes and carrots cut up. I also poured all the marinade over top of everything and stirred the veggies so that they would be covered in marinade. The secret to a good pork loin is a meat thermometer. Cook it to 160* and let it rest a few minutes before slicing it.

We love this. So easy to make. And moist. Made it exactly as directed the 1st two times. Then I added some Raspberry flavored balsamic vinegar. Even better. Definitely a dinner for guest.

After reading from some that this recipe had too much vinegar flavor, I used 1/4 cup balsamic and 1/4 cup rice vinegar. It seemed a little mild. I would have preferred the 1/2 cup balsamic. Also, I added 1-2 cloves minced garlic and 1/3 cup chopped green onions. This recipe is definitely repeatable with those changes.

I used a good chili flavored balsamic and it was delicious!  I would use a lot less oil next time, though. The delicious cooking juice that remained was oilier than I like.

Made this twice - both excellent. Second time added 1/4 cup rice wine vinegar  & 1 tsp chili powder  to marinade. Leftovers made great sandwiches as well.

I will absolutely make this again.  I didn't read the recipe soon enough and didn't have 2 hours for marinating, so I did 20 minutes at room temperature.  Could taste the marianade, but I wish I had used a longer time.  Used Penzys American BBQ spice mixture instead of the steak seasoning and cooked on a Weber charcoal grill using indirect heat.  Came out great.  Served with sweet potatoes and applesauce.  Great dinner, whole family loved it.

Excellent dish!!  My husband and daughter loved it as much as I did- definitely a meal to repeat! The only thing I did differently from the original recipe was to add several cloves of garlic.  And I marinated it for just over 2 and a half hours.  Perfectly tender and not vinegary tasting at all.  Highly recommend!

Excellent! We try to marinate overnight, then cook on a grill using the 7, 6, 5 method (7 mins high on one side, 6 mins on the second side, 5 mins (usually a little longer) on grill with heat off or as low as possible to reach temp of 140 degrees.  Awesome flavor and very juicy!

Fantastic, I added about 1/3 cup brown sugar for a 2 pound roast and it was moist, flavorful, and the most tender pork roast I have ever had.
My  husband doesn't usually care for pork roast he thinks it is too dry but he raved about this one.  Thanks for the advise to add the onions so it would not stick on the bottom.  Tasted it this morning and we will have the greatest sandwiches for lunch, I think it is even better than dinner last night.

My husband, who HATES vinegar asked me if I was cooking something containing it - so I was a little bit worried. But I used an excellent quality balsamic and he gobbled it right up! Said it didn't taste vinegary at all. I only had a couple of hours to marinate the pork and it was yummy! I did add the garlic like so many suggested. Will definitely make again.

This was the best pork roast I ever tasted. I added garlic and Greek seasoning to the mixture and marinated it for 24 hours. I cooked it in a glass dish on a bed of sliced onions surrounded by cut-up potatoes, yams, yellow squash, carrots, onions, and apples, basting the meat and veggies often. It was a delicious meal.

Made this tonight, and my very picky 13 year old LOVED it.  That, in and of itself, is a huge compliment to the creator of this recipe!  My husband enjoyed it as well.  Might have to tweak it with the suggestions from other reviewers next time (honey, white wine, etc.)

This was a winner at our house.  So moist and tender and even better the next day. Of course, there were only 3 slices left over because we just ate and ate.

Smells vinegary, but doesn't taste like it.  Not the best dish ever, but I would make it again. Very simple.

Everyone really loved this!  I tried to ensure that it was tender, so I cooked it for 1/2 the time in a roasting bag, and the other 1/2 regular baking.  I tried to do what another person said and add potatoes and onions.  The onions were done, but the potaoes were not.  I had to take the meat out and let them cook a little longer, but they tasted great!  I could only let it marinade for a little over 2 hrs. I did add the garlic and the honey like someone suggested.  I liked it a lot.  Thanks!

tried this in the slow cooker instead of the oven - think I cooked it a little too long, it was dry and I thought the flavor was just mediocre

Just finished this meal. Family liked it a lot. Won't say it lived up to my week-in-planning high expectation, but it was pretty good.  Followed basic recipe exactly-but cooked longer (>90 min) for large cubed sweet potato I added to get done-plus from other reviews, I added 1 bunch of chopped green onions, 3 cloves of minced garlic and 1/8 cup of honey to my corningware dish. I do caution against using McCormick's SPICY Montreal as it had quite a distracting bite (especially harsh flavor on the potato), even though I only used 1 TBSP of it with 1 TBSP of Weber's Chicago Steak mix. Pork was somewhat tender after 9 hour marination, and even though cooked uncovered the whole time, I had plenty of liquid left in dish to spoon over sliced pork and potato, both. Meat wasn't moist, nor quite dry, but I probably overcooked it...? Silly amateur! I will try this again according to a lot of other reviews and set a bed of sliced onion under the loin, maybe add mushroom, too. Definitely will not use SPICY seasoning again! Will disclose if it turns up a winner.

Really great flavor.  I used this recipe on a 3 pound roast without increasing the measurements and it was still enough marinade.

Had some inexpensive Progresso Balsamic Vinegar and used pork tenderloin.  We were very pleased with the results.  Did not mind the vinegar aroma and plan to do this again.  Will try it on the grill like Nona did in her review.

This was really a winner.  Because of a schedule change with my family, I ended up marinating it for 2 days.  It was so flavorful, tender and beautiful.  My husband said it looked gourmet :-)  We served it with Chef John's Perfect Mashed Potatoes and asparagus...delicious!

Honee.......this is deserving of all the rave reviews.  I happened to have some balsamic vinegar infused with pecan in the cabinet.  Wonderful combination of flavors.  I had to laugh at the reviewer who say they threw it out before it was even cooked completely.  Some people would complain if you hung them with a new rope, don'cha know!

Truly yummy!!  I agree chellebelle's comments about the quality of the Balsamic Vinegar...don't go too cheap on it.  The higher quality balsamic gives this roast a truly rich taste.  I have made this as written and it is FAB!!  I have made it with other additions too, including garlic, lime juice, white wine...all has been good.

My husband and I LOVE this!! It is very simple and the flavor very zesty and wonderful.  I would say that the type of balsamic you use really makes a difference as well as olive oil.  A good balsamic is not too vinegary and shouldn't be overpowering.  Great recipe!!!

This was disappointing; I marinated overnight it was about 4lbs of pork roast; it cooked in the oven and was still hard after over an hour, so I put it in a pot of chicken stock for another hour and a half; it was relatively bland and was hard in spots.  will not make this again

This one totally surpassed my expectations.  It was one of the most enjoyable meals we've had in years.  On top of that, it was absolutely beautiful.  Almost hated to slice it up, and I definitely wish I had taken a picture first.  This will be a regular rotation meal here from now on.  Thanks, Melissa.  Great recipe.

This was absolutely the most amazing pork loin roast I have ever made. My family devoured it and they are not fans of balsamic vinegar at all. I do think having a good quality balsamic must make a difference because ours did not taste like vinegar at all. I didn't change a single thing in this recipe. I will definitely be making this again! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. It is definitely a keeper!!

Disappointed :(  I was initially very excited to try this recipe since I like the ingredients and the reviews were favorable overall. Given my success with other recipes on this site, I assumed it would be another hit. I was mistaken. The pork was fair at best. I made no changes to the recipe and made it exactly as instructed. In our family I always ask every time I try a recipe, "Hey guys,is this a do-againer?" it was suspiciously quiet after I popped the question. Finally my husband sheepishly said, "I like your other pork recipes better." I really wanted to like this recipe since it was easy and required few ingredients but it was nothing more than ordinary in the end.

Made it just as the recipe said, and my family loved it. Next time I will marinade it longer, but even with just marinading it for two hours it was quite delicious.

I prepared this almost exactly as written and it was fabulous! My husband had his doubts because he didn't care for the odor in the house, but he raved about the finished product.  I put thickly sliced onions on the bottom and basted it several times. Next time I'll try the garlic suggested by others, but this recipe doesn't need to be fiddled with much to be outstanding. Baked beans are a nice side dish.

This was a simple and delicious way to prepare pork.  Our pork loin was just under 4lbs, so it took a bit longer than the recipe states to cook.  It also mentions a temp of 145, but when I pulled the pork out at that meat temp, it was still a bit pink.  At about 165/170 degree was perfect for us.  Meat was still very tender and juicy.  The marinade was so flavorful and really added an extra "zing" to the pork.  We marinated it for just about 3 hours, I'm sure it only gets better the longer it sits. Paired it with some roasted asparagus, was a wonderful dinner!

Made this recipe this evening and it was yum yum! A kinda salty (but that could have been my steak seasoning) so I may adjust that. But other than that it was great!

This has become my staple when I need to add something that isn't chicken to my weekly menu.  It does smell very vinegary when it's cooking, but has a much milder flavor.  I followed the directions to the letter and wouldn't change a thing.  I recommend Webber Grill's Steak Seasoning, we've had fantastic results with it.  MAKE SURE YOU BASTE IT WHILE IT COOKS!

Very tasty and tender. Easy too. I added1/4 cup of maple syrup, used good Balsamic Vinegar. Pre- seasoned pork: rubbed on garlic, salt, and pepper. Marinated overnight.

I served this several times and it's always a hit.  A number of friends have asked me for the recipe.  The only change I made, was I used Florida Traditional 20 Year Old Balsamic.  It's delicious.

Excellent!  I like the taste and smell of balsamic so I was happy with the smell while it was cooking.  Pork cooked perfectly, juicy and tender and there was a little crust on the top from the steak rub. Will definitely make again!

This recipe was super simple & absolutely delicious!  I marinated the pork loins for 8 hours.  The only change I would make to this recipe is that I used the "Roast" feature on our oven at the suggested 350 temperature & it was done in 45 minutes.  I should note that I started with a two-pack of tenderloins with a total weight of 3 lbs.

I skipped the Olive Oil in marinade (just spices and vinegar), then after marinading for 2 hours, I seared in olive oil and then put in roaster with onion and rest of marinade and a little water.  It was perfect - just enough vinegar to be reminiscent of saurbrauten, but not too strong at all.

The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I changed a few things.  Added 2 fresh garlic cloves grated, and a scoop of grainy mustard.  Marinated overbite in the fridge and it was delicious - very tender and flavourful.

This was amazing! I was confused on if you're supposed to cook it in the marinade or drain it. I only marinated for 1 1/2 hours and then drained out most of the liquid. It took 1 hr 45 min for my 2 lb pork roast so next time start earlier.  I did bast it 2 times and it was delicious.  My 2 year old and 8 year old ate every bite of their meat as well. I only found it necessary to use half the required liquid listed because I was scared of it being too much vinegar or too oily.

Very simple recipe for pork loin.  Tasty and full of flavor.  There was a little too much vinegar for my personal taste, but that did not stop the pork loin from being eaten.  Thanks for contributing.

This is really excellent, especially in it's simplicity.  I added some garlic and some raw organic honey.  I didn't have time to marinate, but I did quickly brown each side to hopefully seal in some of the flavors.  Then I followed everything else, and it was perfection.

So good. I followed the directions exactly and I didn't even taste a hint of vinegar.  I did marinate about 20 hours. My meat was more than three pounds so it did take a little longer to cook.  However, so easy and really basic!

Easy, easy, easy!! This makes a wonderful roasted pork loin! I love it every time I make it, and the house always smells divine when its cooking. I have used McCormick Montreal steak seasoning and also rendezvous restaurant dry rub (from memphis, TN) as the steak seasoning in this recipe. Both are delicious! It's great for company, just slice up and serve!!

Great recipe for those cold winter months. I used a rib pork loin roast, cooked it fat up so did not need to baste it. It needed 30 minutes longer to cook but was worth the wait.

I just finished our meal with this recipe and it was a hit!  I had a 4lb pork loin so I doubled everything.  It marinated 20 hours.  The sliced onion bed for the roast should have been doubled since those caramelized onions were divine on top of the sliced pork.  I did not baste the meat while it roasted.  The only problem I had was the cooking temperature - it roasted about 2 hours to get to 145 on my instant read thermometer.  I tented foil over the roast but after 30 min. it only rose to 153.  The confusion over whether the roast was done or not is the only reason I gave it 4 stars.  We will enjoy the leftovers too.

WOW! So easy and so delicious - and only 3 ingredients for the marinade! I only marinated mine for 5 hours or so before popping it in the oven. It was done in EXACTLY one hour. My oven tends run low (sometimes takes up to 10 additional minutes when baking something for 35 minutes), so if your oven runs hot, start checking the temp after roasting for 50 minutes.

Made with a 3 lb. pork loin, Webber's Chicago Steak Seasoning and 10 year aged basalmic vinegar and it was sooo good. Mine cooked for about and hour and 20 minutes and came out super tender and juicy. I even put some of the "au jus" on the mashed potaotes! This will be my New Year's pork from now on...thanks for posting.
I forgot to add that I only marinated mine for 5 hours.

Prepared this for Christmas dinner. Followed hint of using great balsamic vinegar. The pork loin turned out wonderful. This is something I was proud to serve and guests thought it was wonderful. Will prepare again and marinate it over night. This is going into my recipe box for future dinners.

Great recipe and way too easy.  There is no vinegar smell as another reviewer said; balsamic vinegar is different than regular vinegar so make sure you purchase the right item (they can't be substituted for each other).  I used southwestern seasoning I had handy instead of purchasing steak seasoning and it was perfect.  I put the ingredients in a gallon sized zip locked bag and shook them up really well as the oil will want to separate from the other ingredients   I then placed the pork loin in the bag, put it in the dish I was going to cook in and put it in the fridge.  I rotated the loin every few hours until I went to bed.  The next day I emptied everything into the dish and baked.  I didn't baste the meat at all once it was in the oven and it came out great.  Even my picky 7 yr old nephew had seconds.  I will definitely be using this recipe again and again.  It's a winner.

This recipe is a definite keeper! You have to use aged balsamic vinegar for this recipe. I marinate it for two days, and serve it with twice baked garlic potatoes and fresh cut green beans. Friends and family drool over this!

I added few fresh garlic cloves and marinated it over night (almost 20 hours). My family LOVED it. Can't wait to make it again, and it is so very EASY!

Very flavorful and just different.  I marinated 2 hours and the pork was not tough at all.  I followed reviewer recommendations:  cook pork on bed of yellow onions to serve with it, add 1/8 cup honey and 2 tsp minced garlic, use good balsamic.

I gave it four stars because I made some changes. I halved it for only 2 people. Instead of "steak seasoning" I used 1/2 tsp. pepper and two cloves minced garlic. I set the timer and basted at 20 minute intervals.

Made this last night for dinner. Did not change anything! Used 
McCormick Montreal steak seasoning. Did add 1/4 c. honey to marinade. 
I can't say enough about how good it was! Moist! Tender! Great flavor! A real feast! Next time the only thing I will change is I will set the roast on sliced onion.
 per another viewer, I did use glass to cook it in,  soaked over night all was fine.   Thanks so much this is a REAL KEEPER.

This was so easy and delicious! As per other reviews, I definitely recommend adding a sliced onion and some cubed sweet potato (or other veggies) to the bottom of the dish. I used a pork tenderloin (I thought they were the same thing when I bought it) and marinated it for about 8 hours. My husband thought the Basalmic vinegar made it a bit sweet so I might use a little less next time or try a different kind of vinegar next time. Definitely will make again! So easy!

This is the best pork tenderloin I have made to date! I kept the tenderloin in the marinade for 24 hrs and it came out SO tender and flavorful. I really like balsamic vinegar so I was eager to try this recipe and it did not disappoint. It's simple and it's made with ingredients that I already have in my pantry. I highly recommend it.

OMG this was awesome.  Have to admit that after reading that someone threw this out mid cooking... we kept joking about the smell!  the aroma while cooking was mouth watering. This pork loin was fabulous. I marinated overnight and slow roasted at 325 for a couple of hours.  This will be my 'go-to' recipe for pork loin!!!

Very tasty. I think the number one problem with most of the critics is inept altitude adjustment and faulty butchers. I graduated from culinary institute of toronto and the cuts of meat we produced were choice.  Its a  shoot when you're out nickle and diming joe schmo for a pork loin, but even for you there is some hope.  When you get home from grocery, let the loin breathe(yes out of the package) for about 5 hours outside to rekindle the juices.  Then proceed with the recipe.

Delicious! My family loved it. It was also easy to make. I had it marinate overnight for 26 hours and it was so tender and juicy. Definitely going to use this again. Also put fresh garlic in it... Great addition.

Wow!! However; the aroma in my house was aweful!! Another reviewer commented on the bad smell and that she threw her roast out. My husband came home and immediately complained about the terrible smell. I am so glad we didn't throw it out. It was tender and moist and the flavor was amazing!! Followed exactly! Thanks for the great recipe!!

Marinated this overnight as suggested and made it last night. Truthfully, as it was cooking it smelled awful, but being an eternal optimist, took it out of the oven, let it sit, cut and served it and it was a hit. I guess the cooking of the balsamic threw it all off until it was done. I would make it again, but lessen the balsamic by a tablespoon or two so that it isn't so overpowering.

I fixed this last night and it was great, i didn't have any steak seasoning so i just used some garlic, salt and pepper instead but it still turned out wonderful. I didn't think it was too vinegary at all, and as someone said before it might be the brand you are using. Definitely one to add to the list of make again's.

I thought it was SIMPLY great.  The only thing I added was water after I put the roast in the pan for juice.  I marinated the roast overnight and the meat was so tender I could have used a fork to cut.

Super easy! This was really good. My husband loved it, and he just started liking balsalmic vinegar. I agree it was really good, the only change I made was adding some minced garlic to the marinade. I read more reviews while it was cooking and saw some cooks added honey. I think I will do this next time, so there is a bit of a sweet finish to go with the sour.

I liked this recipe and followed it, but also added garlic to marinade and onions and sweet potatoes in the roast. I really liked it, but wasn't blown away - perhaps I got high expectations due to the other reviews.

Just made this today for dinner -  very tasty and juicy.  I made it without any changes although I might consider adding garlic and perhaps honey/agave next time.

Love this recipe . I find it better to cook it in a slow cooker on low so tender. you can slice or shred the meat to make divine sandwiches. I added some brown sugar and corn flour to the balsamic omitted the olive oil and used a small amount of water to make a great glaze.

Not a fan at all....very disappointed.  I followed the recipe just as it said, but it was icky.  Maybe I just don't like pork though cause it seems like there are not decent recipes on here that I've seen.

Wasn't sure if it was going to be too overpowered by the balsamic vinegar, but it's amazing!  Other than changing the size of the roast because it was a huge crowd I was feeding, I had to triple the recipe but followed it to a T and it turned out fabulous.  I used McCormick's no salt added Montreal Steak Spice. Thanks, Melissa S.

I was SO excited to make this for dinner tonight---so many stars from people who loved it!!  Um yeah, I won't be making it again.  The pieces of meat that included an outside edge with the marinade on it was delish, but the flavor wasn't infused through the pork at ALL and inner pieces were very blah.  It was easy enough to make, and I always have all the ingredients on hand, which is super important in my meal planning, but the execution just wasn't there.

I was disappointed in how tough the roast turned.  The balsamic marinade is pretty tasty, so I cut up the meat into chunks and let it swim in the marinade.  That seemed to help, but cooking the roast to 145 degrees was too long for this roast.  It didn't have any pink in the middle at all.  For me, I like a little pin, so it stays tender.  I don't know what the problems were.  Maybe I didn't let it sit at room temperature long enough.  Maybe it's because I forgot to  baste it while it was cooking.

I used pork tenderloins, so I knew some things would need adjusting.  I used only 1 Tbs. of steak seasoning, 1 Tbs. of olive oil and cooked about 30 minutes.  The pork was 147 degrees when I took it out of the oven to tent.  Loved the color that balsamic vinegar gave to the meat.  Thanks for the idea!

YUM!!  Made exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing.  Very, very moist and tender.  I wouldn't roast any longer then 145.  It was perfect, no pink inside although I would have preferred that.

Made this roast for Easter dinner, and it was a total hit!  Used a bone- in loin of pork (bought that by mistake) and it was just fine.  This was the first of what I am sure will be many times making this easy and delicious roast!

OMG!!!!! This was amazing.  My fiancé loved it and he wants me to make it again.  I only changed one thing.  I actually basted the meat every 15 minutes.  It came out very juicy and it was cooked to perfection.  Definitely will make this again and again............

This recipe sounded too good/easy to be true-but decided to go for it because I had a pork loin and couldn't think of anything else to do-plus I had all (mostly) ingredients on hand. It was quite possibly the BEST pork loin we have ever eaten! Perfectly cooked, very moist and juicy, and flavorful. Definitely a keeper in this house. I even went and bought another loin to have on hand as I have a feeling will make again sooner rather than later. 
Now for the variations I used after reading many reviews...
We don't use steak seasoning but did have some Cajun Tiger Dust which I used in place of - it's basically same as steak seasoning but with a kick. I added a little honey (~1/4 cup) to the marinade. After reading up on marinating faster (an oxymoron but it worked!) , I "poked" the loin in several places with a paring knife as I needed to get on the table. Because I wanted to make it a meal, I thick sliced and onion (med size), cubed 4-5 red potatoes and sliced ~ 2cups of baby carrots in half, tossed all with the marinade, nestled the loin with the veggies and cooked to 150*. Wanted to put veggies back in oven for ~15 minutes but had hungry boys standing with plates ready to devour so turned out more like 10. Sliced the pork about 1/2" thick and served over a mound of the veggies. The sauce was phenomenal (we LOVE balsamic)-boys kept dipping forkfuls in dish for more "gravy!" One of the best meals I have enjoyed in a while and so simple.

The marinade was delicious, but I'm only giving this 3 stars because the roast was not tender at all.  I used a boneless, center cut pork loin roast and marinated it for 6 hours.  I think I will try this recipe again with pork tenderloin.

I was disappointed because the reviews were so great. I used a very good quality (and expensive) balsamic and felt I had wasted it.

Loved it.  I only used 1/3cup oil, otherwise all the same.  Marinated all nite then put in crock pot all day.  It tasted wonderful.   I love carne seca and this is similar.  My husband thought using the crock made it dry, but I loved!

I made this recipe last night for my husband and I. I followed the directions except I tweeked it a bit for my taste: 1) I decreased the balsamic vinegar and olive oil to 1/3 cup each; 2) I added 1/4 cup of red wine(zinfandel is what I had on hand; 3) I added about 1/4 cup of water to the resealable bag to get out all the seasonings and oil and squeezed the bag really well into my crockpot; 4) I placed everything in my crockpot and cooked on low for about 8-9 hours. I also microwaved (1) white yukon gold potato and (1) sweet potato(both sliced in quarters) and placed in the crockpot 1 hour before the roast was done.
This was probably the best pork loin roast I have had in a long time. It was moist and flavorful and did not have a strong balsamic vinegar taste. My husband is a picky eater and he really enjoyed it. I will definitely make this again.

VERY Good!
As Pork is getting so lean these days it's nice to have a good moist roast! Tasted Great!
Wondering if the 'Vinegary Taste' poster really used a good  balsamic vinegar........or just vinegar..... ;-)

I was inclined to give this one star because it has such high ratings and was so disappointing, but it was fine - nothing wrong with it at all - it certainly wasn't special. 

Normally I would have added rosemary and garlic, maybe some soy sauce, but I followed the recipe. Perhaps others used a better "rub," but I used one that I like.

So simple and easy!  The pork melted in your mouth and had a wonderful flavor.  I didn't have balsalmic vinegar on hand so I used cider vinegar and marinated it for only 1 hour.  Loved this!

Followed the prep as directed, merinanded over night, but cooked  the pork loin on an outdoor grill for about an hour, turning every 15 minutes. Turned out perfect. Thanks for sharing.

I've made this several times, and each time it was amazing. I don't change the recipe, but I do put a little of the marinade on the bottom of the baking dish before I drop the pork loin in to keep it from burning/sticking to the pan. I also lightly dust it with coarse ground pepper for a bit of a kick. It's so good, and SO easy to make. If you have the time, marinade it overnight, the difference in the taste is astounding.

I had a smaller roast, 1.2 lb.  but I used the same amounts for the marinade because we like lots of sauce.  Marinated only two hours, added a sliced onion to the bottom of the pan, placed the roast on top and poured the marinade over all of it.  Baked at 350 degrees until the temp was 150 degrees. Let it rest for a few minutes.  Wow!  So delicious.  Very tender and the onions were a bonus.  The vinegar I used was  from Williams Sonoma and I used a garlic infused olive oil.  Good balsamic is the secret I think.  Will make this again.

This was a fantastic recipe: super simple and easy to throw together before work, and delicious when we got home. After reading the reviews, I decided to add a tablespoon or two of honey to the marinade to avoid the vinegar smell, but I really think the trick is to use good balsamic, as the best balsamic vinegar is sweet enough to eat. Looking for terms like "barrel aged" and shaking the bottle to see how thick it is (it should be almost syrupy if it's a higher quality vinegar) is a good way to buy balsamic. You don't have to go for the most expensive kinds! I used DennyMike's Pixie Dust barbeque rub instead of steak seasoning, and it gave it the most amazing flavor. We poured the rest of the cooked marinade over asparagus because it was so good! Definitely will use again, although it's important to adjust your cooking time if you (like me) bought a smaller pork loin, as the original poster used a 2 lb. loin and I almost overcooked it.

Really good!  I didn't have any steak spice though, so just used the bottle kind of steak sauce, otherwise followed the recipe as written...still tasted pretty good!  kids loved it!  I thought it was so nice and easy to make, turned out very tender and moist!   Served it with mashed potatoes, and broccoli...yum...

Very good.  I quartered 2 onions and positioned them snug around the loin while it cooked.  I basted the loin and the onion with the juices.  During the last 15min. of cooking, I added 1/2 cup of white wine to the pan.  PS.  I only marinated the loin for 1 hour and cooked it until the internal temperature was 145...then let rest....covered for about 5min. Dinner was super. :)

This pork was amazing, I had a 4 pound roast, so I doubled  the marinade ingredients'. I followed other reviewers suggestions and added about 1/4 to half a cup of honey and slices of one whole big onion under the roast.
I was short on time so it only marinated for an hour and a half, but even so the pork was tender and the flavor was amazing. The onions were a perfect addition!
My 14 and 16 year old didn't especially like it, but my boyfriend and I loved it, I'll make this with a smaller roast for just us again definitely!! Five Stars, thank you for the recipe!

This was good! I only added a little honey to the marinade because I was afraid of the "strong vinegar" flavor. Let it marinate over night. But did not cook it in the marinade...put that in a saucepan and simmered it, then added it to the juices in the roasting pan afterwards. So good! I did cook it a little longer because I'm always afraid of undercooking pork. My hour and a half was a little too long, though. It dried out just a bit. Maybe hour and 15 mins next time? Will def make again. Thanks for the recipe :)

This by far is the BEST recipe ever! The bad reviewer most must have used poor quality balsamic vinegar.  I used "Ariston" brand balsamic vinegar.  It is much like the ones I had in Italy. It's available online or at many kitchen stores. It's great for everything! I added extra garlic because I had to use it up and like things really garlicky. My family was very impressed and you will be as well!

I used a 4lb roast and doubled the ingredients.  Had LOTS of sauce leftover for mashed potatoes, rice, or any side you wish!  The balsamic smell in the house during the day was making our mouths water!  I did add honey to the recipe as some reviewers suggested....think I will add garlic next time.  Made this for company and it got good reviews from all, even the kids - 17, 15 and 12.

marinated about 20 hours. olive oil got clumpy in spots so left that part out when I poured marinade into baking dish. Added a tablespoon of minced garlic and a quarter of an onion, sliced. turned out well, I'd make it again. just not too often because the balsamic IS strong.

SO easy and soooo delicious!!  I doubled the recipe and reserved most of the marinade though and cooked the meat with just a small amount.  I then sauteed six onions and added the remaining marinade and reduced it down.  When the pork was done cooking I toasted up some Italian bread, sliced the pork thin and put it on the bread with the onions and a prepared horseradish sauce.  It made the most mouth watering sandwiches!!!! I also made some homemade fresh cut french fries. My husband and kids want me to make it again this week. :-)

Had a boring pork loin roast and a bunch of veggies to get rid of and felt very uninspired until I saw this recipe.  I pretty much followed it but did make a few changes.  I lined my Pampered Chef cookie bar pan with heavy duty foil and sprayed with cooking spray.  I cut up 3 sm. onions, a green pepper and a red pepper, a head of broccoli and a couple handfuls of baby carrots.  I spread them on the entire sheet and drizzled with oil and sprinkled with 2 tsp. from a Good Seasons dry dressing packet.  I roasted the veggies at 450 for 30 minutes.  Meanwhile I marinated the pork in 1/3 c. balsamic oil, 1/2 c. oil, the rest of the dry dressing packet and a generous shaking of granulated garlic while the veggies were roasting.  I then made room for the pork along side the veggies and poured the marinade, which had thickened up, over the pork and some of the veggies. I also poured about a cup and a half of chicken broth over the veggies to keep them from getting dried out.  I put an oven probe into the center (the kind that you leave in while roasting) and waited for the temp to get to 150.  45-minutes later I have an amazing looking and tasting pork roast and the veggies are perfect!  I'm sorry I changed things up but this recipe did offer great inspiration and a good starting point.  I served it all with mashed potatoes.  A Riesling goes well with this, too.

My roast came out dry and it was not very tasty.  I only marinated it for 3 hours so maybe that is why. I won't be making this again.

It did come out tender and juicy but I felt like the flavor needed something. My husband said the same thing. And it was a bit on the salty side but that's probably more to do with the balsamic vinegar I used.

If the smell of Balsamic vinegar is strong, then you are using an inexpensive brand.  Balsamic vinegar has to be aged to acquire a mild yet yummy taste and smell.  A very good one is DeLallo Aged Balsamic Vinegar.  It costs a couple dollars more, but it is soooo good.  Rather than throw away a few dollars, enjoy something for a couple dollars more.

Loved the smell & couldn't wait to try it but when I checked the temp it wasn't at 145.  Cooked it some more & still wasn't done.  Finally cut it & chunks and it got cooked & we loved it. I did cook it on top of some thick onion slices - wonder if that was the problem.  can I cook this in my crock pot?  any suggestions?  Thanks!

My family begs for this pork loin. Easy to prepare and consistently delicious.  I've even marinated it 3-4 days if plans changed and it's still great.   I had a request from my son-in-law to serve it for Thanksgiving!  I declined, but promised it will be on the table for Christmas dinner.  I recently sliced it in smaller pieces and served with dijon mustard on small slider-like buns as a heavy appetizer and it was a hit there too.  I make it just as suggested here, using Montreal Steak Seasoning and it turns out perfect every time.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious!  The only thing I changed was mincing garlic into the marinade.  My pork loin was about 3.5 lbs and I cooked it for an hour at 350F and it was almost overdone.  Probably 45-50 minutes would have been better, but I will just watch it closer next time.  Great flavor though!

Followed the recipe exactly. Smelled wonderful while cooking and was very tender and flavorful. However boyfriend didn't care for the flavor. I used the balance of the pork cut up in salads for my lunch the rest of the week and it was great.

If I could find some way to make the vinegar/salty taste less pungent, I would give it 5 stars. Maybe I'll add some water to the marinade next time.

Made this last night and it was awesome!  Both hubby and I enjoyed it very much.  Pork loin was so tender and perfectly done.  I agree with the other comments that it is important to use good grade balsamic vinegar.

I used a reduced balsamic vinegar as that was all I had on hand. No other changes besides that. We really enjoyed it although the vinegar smell was getting to my dh as it was cooking. It was even great 2 days later!

This was super easy and gave the pork loin a very nice flavor without being overpowering or drying it out.

Delicious!! Roasted on top of cut up carrots, yukon gold potatoes and onion wedges. Very easy to pull together in a hurry. Can't wait to have some of the leftovers!

Great recipe.  I did add a couple of tablespoons of garlic and a tablespoon of onion powder.  I also increased the liquids by 50% because I had two pork loins.  It came out great.  I made gravy with the drippings some vegetable broth and wheat flour.  I used a mesquite seasoning from Costco as my "steak seasoning".  I agree with others that using good balsamic vinegar is probably important.

I hate to give this only 3 stars, but it wasn't a hit here. Maybe if I had used only 2 tsp of seasoning rub (McC's Montreal Steak Seasoning) instead of 2 tbsp.  It was too peppery for my family's taste.

It was VERY easy to make though and smelled fantastic while roasting.

Really enjoyed, as I like Basalmic vinegar, but it seamed to be missing something.  I think I will add rosemary next time and cook a bit less than suggested for a bit more pinkness.  Will make again!

This recipe is great. Although it uses a heavy dose of balsamic, the finished product is not noticeabley vinegary. I didn't alter this much, just added a clove of garlic to the marinade. Marinaded for 2 hours in the fridge, then put the loin and the marinade in a glass pie plate (9x13 was MIA). My meat thermometer was also nowhere to be found, but I baked at 350 for 40 minutes and it was perfectly tender. My roast was 1.3 pounds.

Will definitely make this again. So easy and very tasty.

The vinegar taste/smell was much too harsh for me but as a previous reviewer said, maybe this was due to cheap balsamic.  I won't be making this again, not because it tastes awful but because I can't get the smell out of my tiny apartment! lol

I made this for the first time last night and it was awesome!  I had to make changes to accommodate for what I had in the house and it turned out super tender and full of flavor!! 

I used 2 tablespoons Montreal Steak Seasoning, 1/2 cup creamy balsamic vinaigrette (Ken's Dressing brand), 1/3 cup olive oil, 1 tablespoon minced garlic and a pork loin cut in half.  I put the meat in the marinated and covered all sides, then took out and browned in a hot pan and put back in marinade for two hours.  I cooked for 40 minutes at 350 degrees then took out, cut into pork chop size slices and browned in hot pan until cooked through.

This was delicious and smelled heavenly and it looked awesome when I took it out of the oven.  I did add a little garlic powder and honey to the balsamic mix.  The family really enjoyed its flavor.  I will definitely use this recipe again for pork and will try it next week on chicken.

This is a very good recipe.  I can't give it 5 stars though as I felt it was somewhat bland.  To turn it up a notch, I added fresh herbs I had to the marinade: garlic, basil, parsley, oregano, and thyme.  Then also decreased the oil and vinegar to 1/3 cup.  Be careful not to overbake it or it becomes dry.

I made this tonight for my family and it was a hit!  This is the best pork loin I've ever made.  So easy and really good. I marinated mine overnight and it turned out wonderfully.  The sauce was excellent but I used a more expensive balsamic vinegar.

We had this for dinner tonight and it was excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding a small amount of water to the mixture in order to make more gravy; then I poured it over the meat right before serving.  My husband loved it!  We will be making this again very soon!  Thank you for such a keeper!

This is my first review, and this recipe was worth it.  I've been trying to find a way to cook a pork loin that all our children would eat because it's less per pound than even hamburger.  This is it.  I have to say, I made some changes due to what I had on hand.  Used Worchestershire sauce, a little paprika, salt, & pepper instead of the steak seasoning.  Only had a touch of balsamic left, so I used cider vinegar & honey.  And sorry, I never marinaded it, I just popped it right in the oven.  Yes, it has a funky vinegar smell while cooking (depending on your sense of smell).  Ignore it and move on to slicing!  All 6 children (ages 6-15) had 2nds!  My picky eater, my "I don't like that kind of meat." child, and my "only a small piece" child all had 2nds & wanted to scoop up the sauce in the bottom of the pan to drizzle over their rice & meat.  I didn't have time to make a gravy, so the kids just scooped the cooked marinade from the bottom of the pan.  Husband liked it, too. Thanks Melissa for an easy and flexible recipe!

I couldn't give this 5 stars yet because I used a pork tenderloin. The closest thing I had on hand to the steak seasoning was mesquite seasoning, which worked really well. I drizzled the pork loin with honey right before putting it into the oven. I left the tenderloin in the oven a bit too long, i tried to guess since it was slightly over 3 lbs and in 2 pieces, but it still turned out delicious. I used very high quality balsamic vinegar and olive oil. The resulting pan drippings made a fabulous gravy that was slightly tart, which made up for the dryness. My son had leftovers without the gravy and said it was perfect the way it was.

Tasty and easy. I used a fig balsamic vinegar I had on hand and added more garlic powder and a few onion flakes.  I actually have a recipe that I like a bit better from another site, but it's more complicated, so for a quick and easy meal - this is excellent.

I am so glad to now have a "go-to" recipe for pork loin. I doubled the ingredients and used it for a 5.5 pound pork loin. I marinated the meat in a sealed container overnight, and baked it at 350 for 1.5 hours. It turned out perfectly done and juicy. Everyone loved it!

Absolutely fantastic, we loved it!  Had to make some slight alterations due to ingredients on hand.  Used 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar and 1/4 cup red wine vinegar.  Added some white wine to sweeten (can't use honey) and used my own steak seasoning.  Also added 2 cloves of crushed garlic as suggested by previous reviewer.  Will definitely make again, would even do so for company.  Marinated for 8 hours.

Doesn't always get marinated, but after 8 hours in the crock pot it's just right.

I loooove this recipe! I used to hate cooking pork loin but now this makes it super easy & sooo tasty!

I've literally now made it at least a dozen times. Now I add 2 T. dijoin mustard with 1 T. minced garlic. 

My husband (who is so picky) always asks for second helpings and every time I serve it he asks "now how did you prepare this?"

Very moist and delicious. I served this for Easter Dinner and was a little bit nervous trying out a new recipe on a big crowd. Everyone loved it. 

Note: I did add garlic to the marinade as some suggested.

My family loved this pork!  My husband is not a huge pork fan because he likes lots of flavor in his meals.  This added the right amount of spark to the meat.  I didn't have time to marinate, but it still turned out awesome!  Great, quick, easy & healthy choice for dinner.  Served with applesauce & green beans sauteed in olive oil & sea salt.

This was tasty, but still, a bit plain. The flavor was great, but I think I'd have to add caramelized onions or something to it.

4.5 Stars:  I marinated for 10 hours and we did not think it was too vinegary at all.  It could have marinated overnight.  The sauce is wonderful served on top of the meat.  Ours was thicker in the center and took closer to 1.5 hours to cook to the correct temp.

We have made this twice now and it was fantastic both times!  The first time, we used a fig balsamic vinegar which was a nice twist.  Tonight, just regular balsamic vinegar and it was still excellent.  The family is already asking for it again.

Great recipe; hubby loves pork loin; cut all ingredients in half for l pound loin, marinated for 3 hours, roasted as per recipe and served with rice/veg mix.  A tender, delicious roast with juices to do with what  you like.  Thanks Melissa. p.s. as per other reviews, use good balsamic.

Awesome and easy!  Didn't use the juice as gravy because it seemed a bit strong for that and also pretty greasy.  We didn't miss it at all because the meat was very tender and juicy.  I served brown rice and veggies alongside for balance, and it was really yummy.  Will try this one on company soon.

This did NOT taste too vinegary!! Full of flavor and everyone loved it. I did need to cook it longer than 1 hour though. It took about 1 hour 25 min. and then I left it 10 min to cool. Served with rice and green beans. Super easy meal!

After the 6th week in a row of making this for Sunday dinner, I felt obligated to review this as AMAZING.  My hubby demands it, my 3 and 1 year old both love it.  It is a sophisticated pork dish that both adults and kids will appreciate, not for those who enjoy a sugary or bottled BBQ/french dressing pork dishes.  This tastes like restaurant food.  I make it in the crockpot using 3.5-4 pounds of lean pork loin, double the sauce, set on high for 2 hours then low for 2-3 more.  I add dried garlic, and a vegetable of choice for the week, either three cubed sweet or regular potatoes and a chopped onion, or even peppers.  anything goes with this.  I have made it once in oven and it turns out great as well, I just appreciate the crockpot with the liner for ease on the weekend, plus it does come out a little more "shredded" or "pulled" in the crock.  Also, I have a very LARGE crock so I can cook a lot.  We eat half the meat on day one with the veggies from pot, and the remaining meat and sauce is heated the next day in a saucepan on the stove top and served over Alton Brown's Baked Brown Rice.  We are eating this 2 nights a week, literally.  Also, for any of you Clean Eaters, this is a pretty basic ingredient list, great for those times when you need a reasonably clean meal for people who don't eat clean.  THANKS, MELISSA S!!!!!!

Made as described.  Very nice and i threw in some parsnips and red pepper to roast with it, which came out delicious. Served with some brown rice.
Would definitely make it again.

So good and so simple! Didn't have steak spice so I used fresh garlic, Rosemary, thyme, and oregano. Also put in a tbs of brown sugar. Baked it over potatoes, carrots and onions. This one will become a regular in our house for sure!!

Juicy and so tasty! I pierced the pork before marinating it overnight to let the liquids seep in even more. Great to slice up into a sandwich the next day as leftovers.

Made this for pastor and her family. Didn't have the steak seasoning, so substituted 2 teaspoons of rosemary garlic seasoning, some dry garlic chips and when I baked it I added a pound of thick, "steak cut" mushrooms. Better than good, a keeper for sure.

I was disappointed after all the great reviews.  I marinated it for 3 hours.  It was moist.  but, I didn't like the flavor, which surprised me, because I'm a big fan of balsamic.     Anyway...it's coming out of my recipe box.  I will not make it again.

I served this beautiful pork roast at a dinner party last night with the garlic added to the sauce plus I studded the roast as well.  It was so incredibly yummy!  The sauce was great with garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli.  And the leftovers the next day were great.  This was so easy too.

This is absolutely the best marinade for pork loin. Nothing was left  but the bone after we finished eating the leftovers 2 days later... Wonderful flavor!

so i really dont cook, my man brought home a 3.8lb pork loin and this recipe was so easy and simple ingredients so when i had to buy them all for our tiny apartment it didnt make us broke, i added garlic which was awesome and added to the extra flavor it was so delicious, the only problem i had was our tiny little oven actually took an extra hr and 15 to cook but it was totally worth the wait

Easy, delicious & very tender. I only had enough time to marinate for 1 1/2 hrs but that was plenty to give a great flavor. I think if I marinated it longer the flavor may be too strong for our taste. Will definitely make this again.

I made this as written with only the addition of fresh garlic.  It was moist and delicious.  I also made some roast potatoes and placed them in the pan - great flavor with the slight addition of the vinegar from the marinade on the on the pork.

This is a fantastic recipe! I've made it several times and it's always delicious. I add a few cloves of garlic to the marinade and always use a GOOD quality balsamic, it makes a huge difference. My favorite is President's Choice black label (pricey but delicious).

Excellent was the comment at the table. Added garlic powder and a touch of honey to the marinate and a bit of red wine to the drippings. A simple and very tasty recipe. Use a quality balsamic vinegar.

I used pork tenderloin and marinated it for 4 days - because I was interrupted - it was excellent and moist!  I did add probably 1 teaspoon dry thyme and 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder to the marinade.  I baked the tenderloin at 350 degrees to 160 degrees, per my instant thermometer.

The Balsamic acts as a tenderizer and I didn't marinate the loin, I just stuck it in a pan and baked until done. As my first attempt using the recipes here I'd say it turned out quite nicely.

Made this as per instructions.  Not at all vinegary, which makes me think that a good balsamic vinegar is very important.  Very moist. I roasted it to 145 and let it sit for 45 minutes.  Perfect!

I have never been a big fan of pork before, but I tried this recipe on a frozen pork loin my Mom gave me, and it was DELICIOUS!  It tastes almost like the balsamic and garlic chicken recipe, which I looooove.  The meat itself was so tender, which is in contrast to most chewy, tasteless pork that I'm used to and despise.  My boyfriend loved it too!

My family loved this.  It was so tender.  You have to make sure to use a quality balsamic vinegar.  It's such a sweet taste you will be surprised at the difference of a cheap vinegar.  The taste of the finished product was amazing.  Highly recommend.

This is superb!  REALLY MOIST!  I have both grilled it and put it in the oven as mentioned and they are both great.  I did get the best flavor though when I rubbed it with a greek season mix and then let it marinade over night - will make again and again

This was so good. I did add a little bit of honey and I used Montreal steak seasoning which I love. Easy meal and smelled great while cooking. I also added sweet potatoes that I had cooked in the microwave and slice into thick pieces and brushed with the marinade. Just delicious. I'll be making this again many times; especially when I want to impress guests.

I made this using Canadian Steak Seasoning.  I marinaded it overnight. I places the Pork Loin on a bed of onions.  I  cooked it in about half the marinade.  The broth off the roast had good flavor. It was great...looked good, was moist and had great flavor.  I took it to a church potluck and it disappeared real fast.  This recipe is a keeper!

I thought I had reviewed this once already, but can not find it.  It is an awesome recipe!  I do add chopped garlic and honey to the sauce in the pan though, and carrots and potatoes.   One of the best I have had.

Very tasty.  We didn't change anything in the marinade but we did grill it over indirect charcoal heat for approximately 45 minutes (until the appropriate temp on a meat thermometer).  Wonderful.

2 tablespoons steak seasoning rub is the "fail".  Do NOT pick a rub that has a meat tenderizer in it. This recipe is yummy tasting.  Meat tenderizer will ruin the texture of the meat.  I learned the hard way

We didn't find this particularly flavorful but that might have changed if I'd had 24 hours to marinate it.  That said, it still marinated for over 3 hours before cooking.  I cooked it until 145 degrees, as the recipe indicated, but even with carry over cooking I still had to put it back in the oven- it was still too pink in the center and the juices weren't running clear.  I had hoped to be able to make a sauce with the pan juices but the balsamic had mostly dried up and burned and all that was left in the pan was an oil bath.  I  might make this again but will use far less oil and I would marinate longer.

It's a GREAT easy main course. The longer the marinate, the better and it's ok to let the interior temp go up to about 180 degrees, otherwise, it's going to be pretty rare.

I liked it, I think the steak rub took away from the flavor.  Will definitely make it again, however will just use the balsamic  vinegar and olive oil.

This was absolutely delicious!! I've used it a couple of times; the first with two smaller pork loins and the second with one larger one. I would definitely recommend using two small ones since they were so juicy and flavorful. Great recipe!

Absolutely delicious! I used the organic meat rub available from LifeFoods and I added about 1/2 T. of crushed garlic. We marinated the pork for about 2 hours and it was fabulous and tender. I served it with a wild rice side dish that I topped with a toasted almond and green onion topping.

I loved it. I would eat cardboard soaked in vinegar, so I might be a bit biased, but one of my dinner guests went back for 3rds even. Another left most of his on his plate. I didn't want to embarrass him by asking why. My husband gave it an 8 out of 10. My roast was 3.5 lbs so I adjusted the ingredients. It cooked a little over an hour and a half.  I don't know exactly how long because I use a thermometer. I basted during the cooktime. It didn't look like the photo provided, but it looked pretty good. Very very tender.

This is very simple and absolutely wonderful.  I marinated it for about 3 hours & added garlic to the marinate. The vinegar smelled strong at first, but was great when done. The remaining sauce in the pan was great on the side too.  My husband can't stop talking about it.  I made it last week & he wants it again tonight.  Great recipe.

Marinate overnight! I only marinated for two hours, so for me it didn't have the full flavor. It was definitely not too salty. So, I drained the pan into a bowl, poured off most of the fat, and used it the remaining vinegar and seasonings as a sauce. That made it very tasty. My husband and picky six year old loved it.

My boyfriend loves when I make balsamic chicken & pasta so I thought he might like the balsamic flavor.  As others, I doubled the liquids and threw in crockpot with a large, sweet onion chopped at bottom of crockpot.  Low for 8 hours while I was at work.  When I came home I almost panicked due to the strong odor, I thought it would be too "tangy".  But my boyfriend ate it up, he absolutely loved it, the whole thing was gone!  Very good especially if your a fan of balsamic flavor.

Delicious as is.  It was not too strong for me as some others have stated, but I did use a pretty large (whole) pork loin.  I have served it for a sit down dinner, and it was also great sliced thin for sandwiches at a football party.  Thanks for an easy recipe that tastes delicious!

This is my favorite recipe for pork loin.  I agree with the comment about the quality of the balsamic vinegar can make a difference.  I have really fooled company with my culinary abilities with this recipe, everyone loves it.

I prepared this on a Sunday afternoon to friends & they raved this recipe to be the best! They loved it so much. I inadvertently used pork loin tips  instead of the roast cut, & it still turned out to be really good. I served it with caramelized onion around the platter as a garnish & a very delicious flavor with the pork! I highly recommend this recipe!

This was really tasty!  My whole family enjoyed it.  I didn't have "pre-bottled" steak seasoning, so I had some Adobe seasoning, seasoning salt, Mrs Dash and chile powder (I am far from an experienced cook and went out on a limb with this substitution, but it worked well).  I truly believe the Balsamic Vinegar was what "makes" the dish!

My family doesn't like pork much but I like some variety in our menus!  I used this recipe & I will definitely keep it!  They loved it and.  It doesn't need to be marinated for too long to get the great taste.  I marinated it for 3 hours and it was just right.  I think over night would be too strong.  I used the leftovers in a stir fry and it was yummy both ways!

Wow - this blew us away!  The simplicity of it was wonderful.  I followed recipe exactly and just adding a tablespoon of crushed garlic as others suggested.  The steak seasoning I chose was McCormick's Montreal Steak seasoning (that stuff is great!!). My roast was about 2 1/2 lbs. but cooking it for just an hour was perfect.  This meat was so juicy and delicious.  Thanks submitter!

I give it 5 stars for the juiciness.  I did take some suggestions and added rosemary and a teaspoon of minced garlic.  The flavors were very good.  I think the two keys to this dish: use a good quality balsamic (as others have said) and let it marinate overnight.

This is an awesome recipe!! I've made this twice for parties and it was a huge hit both times. I pretty much followed the recipe as given the only thing I added was 2 tablespoons of chopped garlic and I marinated this for 48 hours and it produced the most tender juicy pork loin that I've ever had. Definitely use a good quality Balsamic vinegar, I used a low cost one the first time and it was good, but used a high quality Balsamic the last time and it truly does make a huge difference! I'll be making this many more times for sure!

I tried this for the first time yesterday. My BH and I just loved it. I could hardly wait to tell my married daughters about it. My BH said to never made it any other way. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is by far the best pork loin I have ever tasted. I shared some with my Dad and he said it beats everything he has ever had in a restaurant. So moist, and so easy. It doesn't get any better!

This came out delicious! No weird smell, and extremely juicy meat. Will definitely make it again :-)

This was delicious!  I followed recipe as-is and it turned out great.
