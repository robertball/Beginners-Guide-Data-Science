I've made this recipe (or a variant) nearly half a dozen times for house parties, and every time I make it I tweak it a little bit because the flavor isn't quite there.  This time I think I've nailed it:  I add about 3T of mayo to increase the creamy consistency, substitute sweet onion for green, reduce worcestershire to about 1/2t and increase soy to about 1t. I also add 1/2t of lemon juice, 2T of grated parmesan, and 1/2t of white sugar.  I grease a muffin pan and add the mixture to the center of the wonton wrapper.  I then fold up all four corners to the center and pinch off, then place in the muffin tins and bake as directed.  It looks a little different, as you can see the filling inside of the openings of the wonton "cups", but that means it can hold more dipping sauce (sweet & sour)!   I suppose with all these changes I should just submit a new recipe, but so far this has been the best base for crab rangoon.

These turned out great, but just a little bland. So the next time I added 2 sticks of chopped up celery and lots of sugar. When the sugar melts it really makes a differance in the flavor. I also used fake  meat, much more flavor.

Very good, I always order these when I eat Chinese.   I do prefer them deep fried because it just gives them a little extra crunch.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I love this recipe.  I changed it a little for my taste but it was great.  I used a 1/4t of garlic powder b/c I didn't feel like chopping garlic.  I also added 2t of milk, 1t of parsley, and a 1/4t of sugar.  The sugar is important.  It adds that sweetness you find in restaurant rangoons.

this is a great recipe for the fact that it has the basic ingredients you need. however, i found it to taste too fishy. i tried it out by only filling and frying one at first to make sure i liked it before i spent time doing the whole batch. it was ok, but too fishy tasting for my liking. this one restaurant that i get them from - they are so sweet and that's what i wanted. So, I added an extra package and a half of cream cheese, a few tablespoons lemon juice, and a couple spoonfuls of sugar. And it was EXCELLENT. So I'm giving it 4 stars because while it's good, it's not GREAT... Everyone has different taste preferences though, I just prefer it to be sweeter rather than fishy.

These turned out great! Make sure you have a dipping sauce if you like the rangoons a little on the sweet side. Or like another reviewer, add a little sugar. Otherwise, they are great. Oven makes them crispy and not greasy like regular takeout.

I had a great recipe for these from years ago but could not find it. My husband loves crab rangoon and always brings it home. I wanted to make it from scratch and as I worked on this recipe I remembered that an ingredient from the old recipe was a little hot sauce. Otherwise it really was great, but we did fry them and I probably added a little more garlic. However, I think that the whole process of using the typically available small wonton skins could be a challenge for the first time maker. But thanks for the recipe we had fun and enjoyed the result.

Delicious recipe, howver I could not find wonton wrappers and wasn't excited about making my own, so we put the crab mixture on slices of toasted french bread with melted monterrey cheese - YUMMY!

Made a few changes, like most everyone else.  I added a few tbsp of mayo--makes it unbelievably creamy.  I didn't have any green onions, so I just used yellow.  Doubled the garlic, and added a dash of sugar.  I also substituted canned crab for fresh crab from the meat counter.  They turned out so awesome.

I didn't want to spend the time frying individual rangoons so I ended up just making the filling and using it as a hot dip.  I made it for a party and it was eaten within seconds.  I ended up using more crab than what the recipe called for because I had a larger can but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I will be making this again but will probably stick to using the filling as a dip as it is so simple and delicious.

Thanks for providing the basic ingredients but I took some of the other reviewers recommendation and referred to another crab rangoon recipe to great avail.  I minced real crab meat, mixed it with green onions, softened cream cheese, minced garlic, paprika, and sugar.  Mixed that in the AM, refrigerated and fried the wonton once i returned from work.  It was so tasty!  My boyfriend loved it.
Can't wait for our annual cookout so I can WOW my guests!

These were ok. I agree that they needed something. I coudn't even taste the garlic. They were'nt bad though. I actually fried them and that worked out well. I think maybe less cheese more crab and something else for flavor. Spinach maybe? Parmesan cheese? I may try these again.

I know its the healthy way of making them. But I'm never baking these again. Ew. and I had to bake mine at 8-9 minutes cause the tops began to burn. I think the oil from frying makes them taste so much better

Been making these for years but I got the recipe from Kraft.  I use 4 ounce of cream cheese to every 6 ounce  can of crabmeat.  We like more garlic in the recipe.  These are always a hit every time I serve them.

Great recipe, however I added 1 tsp sugar to make it closer tothe sweetness of my favorite Chinese eatery and used garlic powder(1/4 tsp) I also could not find Wonton wraps so I used egg roll wraps and it worked perfectly. For you diabetics out there SPLENDA works perfectly instead of sugar.

Thanks for posting!  I used imitation crab meat, instead of canned since that is what our local restaurant uses.  While it was quite enjoyable, I found 6 oz. of crab a bit much for our taste.  Next time I will use half the amount.

Excellant recipe as is. I did add a little cayenne, though, but not enough to change the overall taste. Unlike others, I didnt think any one flavor stood out over the others. Very good.

I made these for a "Chinese" themed potluck. Everyone raved how good them were. I made 3 variations 1 with only crab and cream cheese, one with plain cream cheese and the final exactly as the recipe calls for. It was a big hit!!!!

Loved this recipe as it is.  Makes a bunch, and they cook quickly. My daughter has always loved crab rangoon from the local Chinese restaurant, and I made these as a surprise when she was coming home for a visit.  They were a hit! Thanks for sharing.

This filling is really good. The first time I made it, I only used half a can of crab, and I think I like that better. I couldn't find wonton wrappers at my store, so I'm using the filling to stuff pasta shells.

I learned to cook them for 10 minutes at 400 degrees. The corners won't burn at that time.

First do not bake as they will blow out in the oven. Second the filling is not good.

Recipe altered by using 16 oz cream cheese and 2 Tbs powdered sugar and NO CRAB MEAT. Most Chinese restaurants don't use crab meat and I like it that way. I also fried them. Very good and to my liking!

I don't know what I did wrong but I couldn't get the wontons to seal. The filling was so thin and runny. Maybe I didn't drain the crab enough? Also they were not sweet at all like the restaurant's version. 

I wound up with a sheet full of burned bubbly crabby cream cheese leaking out of the wrappers. 

I will try again but will chill the mixture first and add a little sugar like I've seen in other recipes. Maybe will use surimi since it's sweeter than real crab.

These were perfect!  I did add a bit of sugar to it as I like them a bit sweeter.

I made these without the crab and they came out very good. I also fried them instead of baking them. It took care of my cream cheese wonton craving.

Really good recipe! I subsituted chives for the green onions, and i thought it tasted better that way.  :)  also, if you put more than a teaspoon of the  mixture in a wrapper, it will bubble out in the oven.  I personally prefer the oven to frying, but to each his own!  Made these for a crowd, and they were a hit!  I myself am Lactose intolerant so i use Dairy free cream cheese when i cook these at home.  works just as well!

Great Recipe! I would use scallion cream cheese instead of plain. Add more garlic,salt, and pepper. Make turnover pockets with the dough and fry them in peanut oil. Full of flavor and yummy.

Good but could be better. When I've had these in restaurants the main ingredient is cream cheese with a hint of crab flavor. In my opinion the cream cheese/crab meat ratio was off - WAY too much crabmeat, almost like the consistency of a tuna fish sandwich. I also think there was too much Worcestershire sauce so the next time I make these I would use 1/2 or maybe 1/4 can of crabmeat, reduce the Worcestershire & up the Soy sauce a tad.

My husband and I thought these were very good. I found chunked crab in the seafood section, but next time will try to find the one mentioned in the recipe, as the pieces of crab were too big.

did this on Thanksgiving for an appetizer.  Family loved it. In fact my son requested them for Christmas.  I deep fried them for more crunch. For those of you who can't find the wrappers, they are with the tofu in the fresh veggie department.  Im going to put a little sugar in half of them so we can have a little variety.

I made these a few days ago and they are great!  Not as good as fried but, still great!  They do not brown well because they are baked but that's okay to save on all the grease that comes from frying.  The filling was marvelous!

Awesome, followed recipe exactly and these were a great hit with family and friends.  Everyone asked me for the recipe.  If you deepfry these be sure to squeeze the air out of the pockets or they tend to burst during cooking.

I made these today and they were amazing. I boiled them and then sauteed. It was not worth the time I took to do so. Next time, I will be deep frying the rangoon. I made the mistake of stacking them after boiling. Silly me. They were stuck together. I made it all work. They didn't need to look pretty, just taste good. Best of luck fellow cooks.

This is a great recipe.  I've made them with leftover king crab meat and once with finely diced ham. (a friend even suggested using Spam!)  The basic recipe is very adaptable to any meat really.  I gave it four stars because I thought these really should be deep fried for the best flavor and crispness from the won tons.  Thanks for sharing!

Pretty great! I used imitation crab because that's what I had on hand. Baking them gave them an interesting texture but the taste was yummy. I think I will fry them next time.

I fried these instead of baking. I also added 3 tbls. of mayonnaise, lemon juice, and 3 packets of Splenda. My husband is diabetic and the Splenda worked well. I will try baking them next time and see how that does. Thanks for a great starter recipe.

This was a spur of the moment thing since I had leftover cream cheese & wontons. I didn't have any crab so used shrimp. I'll make again with crab and then update my review. The shrimp was fine except should've diced it smaller. I liked them even better after warming them up from the freezer.

I followed the directions and removed from 425 oven after 12 minutes. All ingredients leaked out and shells were empty.

Tonight was my 2nd time to make these. I used the filling as written both times. 1st time, we attempted to seal each one at the corners, making a square pouch. But not all of them were well-sealed, so they oozed into the pan. (Still tasty!).  Tonight I drained the crab well, mixed up the filling and put back in the refrigerator to chill. Using a non-stick mini muffin pan, we placed a wrapper in each compartment (18 total), making the folds as even as possible. Use 2-3 tsp of filling for each wrapper. Try to keep the filling from getting into the folds. Lightly wet two opposite corners and pinch to hold them together. Bake at 400 for 10 minutes.  Cool slightly before removing from pan. (These did not ooze, were beautiful, tasty and SO easy!)

Surprisingly, I preferred these to the rangoons I buy at an oriental restaurant  because they are baked and not fried.  I sprayed them well and they browned nicely and came out crispy.  I  formed them in packets so I could  fill them generously.

I love these. They're easy to make and they taste great. I recommend getting some thai sweet and spicy dipping sauce to go with it. It's honestly delicious.

I love Crab Rangoons but these were hard to make.  The dough didn't stick well and the crab/cheese mixture would fall out.  They came out so oily, we didn't like them.  I will just get them at the restaurant.

The filling was perfect but i did not care for baking  them. They turned out a little hard. The second time i made them i deep fried them in a sauce pan using canola oil. They turned out magnificently!!!

Add half of what is suggested for crab so it isn't too chunky. I also added a bunch of minced fresh chives as green onion stalks are too big in my opinion. I put in a tbsp of sugar and 2 tbsp of mayonnaise as well. I used won ton wrappers that I found in the refrigerator section near produce and deli. They are thin and crisp perfectly in the oven. I dabbed my fingers with water and pressed the edges closed and did not have any leak out.  I used the method that looks like a little pouch with 4 sealed edges on top and tried a few triangles and they were both good. I prefer the pouch method because it holds more filling. Imitation crab meat, minced is what you want to use. Not fishy or chunky. 
These Crab Rangoons were AMAZING !! I will definitely make these again and let me tell you I am extremely picky and a very good cook. So I would not look further for a recipe! These were better than any I have ever ordered from any restaurant by far!! My family gobbled these up and will have to double the recipe next time. I am planning on making more tommorow.

The filling is wonderful, however they taste much better when we fry them! Somehow the fishy taste is too strong when we bake them. Perfect filling, although my daughter would prefer a little less garlic.

Filling was not good at all. Used canned lump crab meat and it was too fishy tasting. Filling did not stay in the wonton wrappers, when I took them out of the oven it was an empty cooked wonton wrapper. Tastes nothing like an actual chinese restaurant.

Just no.... . I created an account just to warn other people. It tastes like a bad crab cake inside a destroyed wonton wrapper. 

It needs twice the cream cheese and skip all the other additions except the scallions and crab itself. If you want them sweet add in 1tsp of sugar. If you want them savory, add in a little garlic and onion powder (not minced garlic since the flavors wont mingle properly and you'll end up with garlic bombs). 

Also, DO NOT cook these in the oven unless you want wrappers that are both burnt and chewy at the same time.

I should have ordered take out since these cost more to make.

These were tasty and not too difficult to make.  I checked the oven at 10 minutes and so glad I did because the tops were almost starting to burn.  I would make them again and I would love to try them fried!

Only change I made was I used more crab meat and I prefer to not trifold them. Like a nice sweet and sour sauce to dip in.
I made 2 batches and froze the bulk of them.....super  easy to make a snack or side meal anytime.

The flavors are off. I'm not convinced the soy and worcestershire complement the other flavors, and these didn't taste close enough to what I've had in restaurants. I think I would try to make again without the soy & worcestershire, but these still seemed to be missing something.

Made this tonight with chicken fried rice and teriyaki chicken. I don't eat seafood, but they were a hit. Next time I will add some sugar for the sweetness my boyfriend said it was missing.

I've made these a couple of times, but for some reason I never get 48 - I get about 1/2 that.  Not sure what's wrong (and I use less than a teaspoon of filling per wonton).  Overall, good flavor - and we use a sweet chili sauce for dipping.

This is yummy! I DID NOT have problems with these being too garlicky or fishy as a few others had complained. I have made them several times now and decided I like them best with the suggestion of adding a little Mayo, and also I like to use oyster sauce instead of Worcester and soy sauces. They are definitely better fried, but baking is good for cutting calories and less mess.

My mom n I agree to double the crab meat in this.  We also added sugar like it said.  We didn't have any of the Worcester sauce so can't wait Til we try it again w it and double the meat.  I used fat free cream cheese (only milk product I can't handle normally so the fat free is less harsh on my tummy ). I don't know if that effect the taste or not either. 
I used wonton wraps.  They started to burn up top n be raw looking on bottom in the oven (first time we used that oven at my moms new place) so there are several factors of unknown there. But I will be making these again.  Does anyone know if the fat free cream cheese will alter it?

I made the filling as a dip and just fried some wonton wrappers to use as chips. The recipe was too fishy and called for too much Worcestershire sauce. I just added about 1/3 cup of sugar, and that was enough to make the dip better.

The Worcestershire was strong, and NOT EVEN CLOSE on the cream cheese ratio.  It was just too much crab meat to cream cheese.  It definitely needs to be tweaked - looking for a different recipe.

As some other reviewers mentioned, the canned crab gave the rangoons a slightly fishy taste.  Was still pretty good.  Might try it again with fresh or imitation crab.  I also deep fried it in my wok.

The recipe was perfect for me, as I like my crab rangoons to lean towards the savory side, however the worschishire sauce was intense; either cut the worschishire measurement in half or replace it with ginger and sesame oil.

I didn't care for the baked wonton wrapper, it just made it really hard and difficult to eat.  I'll fry it next time for a crispy but flaky outside.  I did add in some chopped green onion for some extra flavor and color.

Made it to recipe & we did not enjoy this recipe.  I'm not sure what restaurant is being referred to, but in our area crab Rangoon is slightly sweet.  This isn't. Baking the wontons also made them hard to eat.  I will continue looking for a recipe for this family favorite.

OH MY GOD! These were delicous!!!!

I deep fried them instead of baking as it's easier for me to do this out here in Asia.  Also, i think i used a little extra cream cheese as i bought a portion of a bulk quantity which is maybe 2-3 tablespoons more than what is in typical packages.

And just a friendly reminder to other cooks that 1 clove of garlic is not the whole bunch/head of garlic.  It's just one smaller piece that you have to peel.

But seriously, really good. Thank you so much!

Easy recipe! Love the baked version over the deep fried. Added a teaspoon of sugar to sweeten it a bit but other than that, I stuck with the recipe. Delicious! Might try to muffin pan next time.

Wonderful. Add a little shredded carrot to lift the flavor and deep fry in peanut oil. YUM!

I am literally eating these right now!  They are so good!  The only reason why I don't give them a perfect 5 is because, as some others stated, I'd add sugar to it.  It's a little on the salty side if you don't.  I also reduced the amount of imitation crab.  I only used like an once or two, cause I like more cream cheese.  I also used imitation crab meat and not canned (cause it's what I had) I also fried mine.  I tried a different recipe last night that turned in disaster!  I baked instead of fried and there was more crab than cream cheese....awful!  These are soooo much better!!  Try them, add some sugar, deep fry them, and they will be PERFECT!!

This recipe works well... The garlic is a little strong so if you use fresh I'd use like half the amount. They fried well in the oil too. Just have to be sure you seal the edges well so your filling doesn't ooze out while cooking.

Great we are going to try baking them in a mini muffin pan next time to see if the crisp is a little more around the edges instead of just toward the top!

Made these as directed & deep fried them. Tasted a little too 'cream cheesy' to me so for the 2nd batch I added 2 tsp of sugar, 1/4 c more crab meat & 1 tsp more Worcestershire sauce. Next time I'll cut down on the onion and I think it'll be perfect. The kids loved them :)

Just made for the first time. Tweaked alittle. Added a little mayo and parmesan. Still missing something - going to play around with it til I get it how I like it.  Thanks for a good base recipe. I also fried mine instead of baking.

OK, I admit I changed the recipe a bunch, which is the only reason why I'm rating 4 stars not 5.  to the mix I added a good squirt of lemon, replaced cream cheese with 3 T mayo, & a good sprinkle of parma sean, cut worcestershire to 1/2t and increased soy to about 1t.  In my one batch of these, I tried them both fried and baked.  both were good just different. I put them in a mini muffin cup pan, lining each slot with oil and then brushing the exposed tips of the wonton wrapper with oil and then pinching together the four corners.  baked as directed otherwise.  As for fried, the pockets puffed out ALOT, wondering if I did something wrong here? filled them too much? still super tasty, just not quite as pretty.  My favourite dip with these is thai sweet chili sauce. Mmm...

Absolutely the best! Followed the recipe exactly and chose to deep fry. The crab cheese was soft and very flavorful. Will definitely make these again. The whole family enjoyed them.

I was quite impressed with how easy these were to make.  The filling needed a little bit more flavor, maybe some more garlic or add some other kind of spice, but otherwise this was good.  Definitely gonna be playing around with it.
