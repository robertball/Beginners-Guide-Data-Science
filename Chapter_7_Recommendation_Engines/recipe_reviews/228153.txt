Made this up tonite and it was fabulous!  I added a few extras b/c we like it spicy. I added some jalepono's fm my garden, cayenne pepper, and a bit of Louisianna hot sauce. Really was great!  Thanks for experimenting and sharing this recipe, I will definitely use this again!

I found this to be very bland.  Next time I will season the mushrooms with a little salt, pepper, and garlic powder, as well as add some sautéed onion, pepper, and garlic to the crab mixture.  Then I think this will be a 5-star recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

This was good, but I agree with other reviewer. It was a little dry. I didn't follow the recipe exactly. Of course we modify to what we have on hand right? :)
First off I took the stems out and cleaned  the mushroom "gills". I then salted the mushroom caps and put on a baking sheet to precook at 350 deg.  
I chopped the stems and sautéed the stems with some garlic and small shrimp just for a minute to incorporate the garlic. 
I put the shrimp mix into a bowl with my imitation crab, some parmesan cheese and panko bread crumbs. I added a Tbspn of mayo and some peppered gouda cheese (had no mozzarella). 
After the mushrooms were in oven for about 10 mins I took them out and dryed them off as they had sweat out a lot of moisture. 
I then took my stuffing and mounded it into the caps. I topped the mound with some more panko and sprinkled with olive oil. I baked for about 30 mins and finished with a quick broil to brown the top. 
Next time I will use Mozzarella and more mayo for moisture. 
Overall very good.

This turned out pretty dry and heavy, even after adding additional eggs and milk to the stuffing mixture. After scraping off the stuffing, the mushrooms themselves were delicious. The filling on this needs help.

These were intriguing.  I used shrimp as the meat and as surprised at how dry the filling was.  It was very much stuffing (think Thanksgiving) consistency, albeit a dry stuffing.  I also didn't get much cheese.  I DID eat all of my mushroom, but I'm not sure I'd make these again.  THANKS for the recipe, rocklightning!

Easy, simple and it tasted great! Served it as a side dish to Christmas dinner. Will be making it again with smaller mushrooms for my New Year's get-together. Side note, mushrooms naturally give off water ensure that you 'bake' the dressing/ water out of the shrooms before you add the crab mixture to help reduce the amount the risidule liquid in the baking dish.

We really enjoyed this recipe but would definitely make some minor alterations. I might consider adding a small amount of diced peppers and more spinach.  This would be great over a risotto as well!  Overall 4 stars. Will be 5 next time we make it!  ??

Real easy to make and filling for two servings. Delicious to have this one appetizer as a main meal and have one leftover for another meal.

Well, it's in the oven. Except I didn't really stay close to the original. I used a can of tuna, half a zucchini (finely diced), a quarter of an onion (finely diced), one egg, half cup of mozzarella, some fresh basil, and "enough" bread crumbs, all for three mushrooms. Here's hoping. It's easy enough so I hope it's good. -- Okay, a little sauté for veggies would have helped. Baked for expected time, then broiled for about 5, and they were good!

I made this for mother's day as a appetizer, but it could have been the entree. It was well received!

My family loved it.  I added medium shrimp along with the crab meat and used Cajun seasoning.

Made two of these for lunch and I really only needed one. I added spinach to mine, so I wonder if that helped with the dryness I've read in other reviews because mine were not dry. I will agree, it is A LOT of stuffing per cap. I may use a different meat next time, though the crab was pretty good. Overall, I enjoyed them.
