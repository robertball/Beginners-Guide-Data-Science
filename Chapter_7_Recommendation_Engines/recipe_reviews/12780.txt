This turned out good but I would make some changes next time.  First, I would double the sauce.  This just didn't make enough for our taste.  Second, I would sautee the shrimp separately in olive oil with minced garlic and add it into the sauce just before serving.  Cooking the shrimp in the sauce made the whole thing taste a little too shrimpy, and the shrimp was a little overcooked.  Other than those small changes, this is a good dish.

This is a very good shrimp alfredo recipe.  I would recommend removing the shrimp from the pan once it's cooked through, and then add the half and half to the pan to thicken.  Otherwise, the shrimp can become overcooked and tough.  Just add the shrimp back to the sauce once it's thickened.  Overall, very good.  I've made it twice, and the second time, added some steamed broccoli to the dish.

Made some changes:
1.  With the onions I added a red bell pepper, mushrooms, and just used an entire whole white onion.
2.  Didn't use any butter.  Just sprayed some oil into the pan.
3.  I added 1/4 cup white wine in with the shrimp.
4.  I added a pinch of red pepper flakes, and just put the black pepper and parmesan right into the sauce.  I only used maybe 1/2 of the black pepper it calls for, if that.  Add some and then taste as it's all person preference.
5.  Used about 1 and 1/2 tablespoons of corn starch to thicken sauce.

With those modifications it came out delicious!  For even less fat try using homo milk and then just add a little more corn starch at the end.

Enjoy

After some personal tweaking...this was delicious!  DON'T overcook the shrimp.  Fry it in the butter/onion/garlic until just cooked.  Set aside. Pour 1 cup half and half, 1 half cup white wine and 1 tbsp of lemon juice into pan and stir constantly. (This heats up fast so keep stirring!) Add parmesan cheese to sauce as you are stirring(constantly!).  Pour over cooked pasta, garnish.

This was very good but I made a few slight changes. I used !/2 cup butter, omitted onions as my hubby don't like them, used the 4 tsp. garlic, 2 cups half n half only 1 tsp. pepper, 12 T fresh grated parmesan, instead of parsely sprigs , I used some dried parsely from my spices. Used frozen shrimp and added a can of crab meat. I cooked shrimp in butter till thawed and removed from pan. Then added my cream and cheese. To thicken a bit I used about 2 T cornsarch mixed with a tad of water until it was the consistency I like. Then added my shrimp and crab and gently heated. It made a nice amount of sauce so it wasn't dry. Everyone loved it! I imagine everyone could make this to their liking. It's a great recipe! Thanks!

Great recipe. I took other members advise and added more garlic, basil, white wine and parmesan to the sauce.I also cooked the shrimp and then set it aside and made the sauce on its own. I added a tsp cornstarch and then put the shrimp back in the sauce for 1 minute.

my bf thought this was fabulous. i liked it but we both agreed it was missing something. i used cream instead of half and half. the sauce was pretty thin so we dumped a whole lot of parmesan cheese into the sauce until it thickened up. the next time i make this ill add more garlic since that flavor seemed to be lacking.

Made this last night in a snap before heading out to darts. I added some fresh sliced mushrooms while sauting the onion and garlic. Also, I added a dash of cajun seasoning to the shrimp for a little kick and took another's recommendation and added some white wine to the sauce. I did have to thicken it with a little cornstarch (not much) but it was VERY GOOD!! Tasted like fine dining! Thanks Tina!!

I don't know what I'm missing here...  I put only 1 tsp of black pepper and it was still pretty spicy to me.  Maybe everyone else out there loves extremely spicy dish?

Was great!  I accidentally thickened it too much with flour, but was happy in the end when I had extra sauce above the doubled amount having added milk to thin it out.  I also included grilled scallops on top and steamed asparagus.  Heaven!  Oh, and mushroom, but I don't know if I'll do that again as it was too many extras.  Lots of fresh grated parm cheese made this one a success.  I certainly didn't measure it.  Just put in a whole lot of it.  I didn't use the lemon.  Oh, and all I had was rotini.  Yum!  Husband and I made it together.

WOW - this makes awesome Alfredo sauce!  I did make a few minor adjustments. 1) Remove shrimp when cooked through, then complete the sauce, adding shrimp back just before serving. 2) Used heavy whipped cream, as I had it on hand. 3) Added Parmesan to the sauce as it cooked (probably 1/2 cup).  My hubby loved it too, and we have decided we're never buying Alfredo sauce again - this was easy and delicious!

Very rarely do i make a dish and immediately come upstairs to review it! I thought this was excellent! I felt like i was at a great seafood or italian place. That being said i did make a few minor changes per other reviews suggestions and a few of my own to cut down the fat and calories. I did double the sauce but I only used half the amount of butter and used fat free half and half. To make sure it thickened i made a rou by adding flour to the butter, then slowly added the half and half. I used jumbo shrimp and cooked them with butter, onions and garlic and then removed them slightly undercooked and added them back to the sauce the last minute or so. I also salted the sauce to taste. Served over whole wheat linguine with asparagus on the side. It was still rich and creamy, you really won't miss the fat at all! I will be adding this to the menu rotation for sure.

We loved this dish. I followed some reccomendations from other reviewers and I doubled the sauce and removed the shrimp from the pan as soon as it turned pink. The sauce does take a pretty long time to thicken, especially since I doubled it, but it was so good and i didn't have to add any thickener such as cornstarch. Also I only used about a 1/2 teaspoon pepper. With these changes it was so creamy and had such a great flavor that I'm not only going to make it often, but I'm going to try it with grilled chicken. Thanks for a great recipe.

I think this recipe has potential, but requires modifications.  I agree with the other reviewers that the sauce needs to be doubled, but don't double the pepper!  I used 1 tsp pepper in a doubled recipe and that was plenty.  This recipe would benefit from some seasonings especially basil, parsley, &/or oregano.  Several little things aren't quite right with this recipe, but it's the reliance on all that pepper for seasoning that I would change first if I were to try this again.  I removed the shrimp before making the sauce so they wouldn't get overcooked.  The sauce did not really thicken much, so the recipe was better after it sat for a little bit and the linguine absorbed some of the liquid.  I stirred the pepper & Parmesan into the sauce at the end...I think this worked better than sprinkling those two ingredients over the top.

My sauce did not thicken enough for me and there was still something lacking in the flavor dept.  My shrimp did become tough while waiting for the sauce to thicken.  I will continue to look for a good alfredo recipe.

I made this per recipe. The sauce wouldn't thicken so I disolved a tsp. corn starch in 1/8 c. cold water and started adding it. I only had to add 1/2 to get right consistency. The flavor was perfect. Resturant quality! I will definately make this winner again!

Good recipe with adjustments. Always read reviews first!
Definetly DOUBLE the recipe (not noodles), cook the shrimp separate from cream mixture as sauce takes a while to thicken, I added small amount of corn starch or flour to thinken cream mixture up.  I added fresh parmesan to the cream mixture as well.  When I cooked the shrimp I added mushrooms, garlic and diced red bell pepper.  You can cook the onion and garlic (use lots, gives good flavour-at least 6 cloves) with butter then add cream and fresh parmesan plus little corn starch or flour.  Cook shrimp mixture separate and add to sauce when thick and combine with noodles. Served with bread. So delicous!

very simple, and very good. i did not put the shrimp in with the sauce, but added green and red bell peppers while the sauce was cooking. the shrimp was already cooked so i sauteed it with olive oil and one crushed clove of garlic. seasoned it with salt and pepper too. i took out the bell peppers so they wouldn't get mushy, then i put the pasta in a bowl, put the bell peppers down, shrimp on top then added the sauce to the whole thing. oh, i doubled the sauce too. it was YUMMY!

absolutely delicious! I used 7 cloves of garlic and red pepper flakes for some zing. I also added a package of mushrooms  to the butter after removing the shrimp. Stir the parmesan into the sauce slowly a couple minutes before serving.

I rarely write reviews, but this recipe deserves its 5 stars.  I took alot of the suggestions and this dish served great heated up as left overs too.  Finally a flavorful creme sauce dish!  I diced one small onion, used 1/2 C butter and 4 cloves garlic minced.  I sauteed the onion in butter and garlic until almost done and then added large shrimp for a couple minutes, not quite fully cooking the shrimp.  I removed from heat and set aside.  In another pan on med-high heat I used   1 1/4 C half and half, 3/4 C white wine, 1 T fresh lemon juice and 1 T cornstarch with water.  Cooked until thickend, then added 12 T  fresh parm. cheese until melted.  I then added in shrimp mixture for another minute or two along with about 1/4 C of fresh chopped parsley.  Fabulous!  The wine made this.  My husband couldn't get over how good the shrimp was.  Next time I will add the lemon juice to the shrimp instead, but other than that, this is a dinner for guests.  Will serve 6 if you make a salad to go with it on the side.

Like others, I doubled the sauce. Cooked the garlic and onions, then added the half & half. Once that reduced a bit I slowly added the cheese (didn't measure, just eyeballed)..use a good cheese, it does make a difference. I used Grana Padano and it added a great rich flavor. Then I added the shrimp in the end while the sauce simmered so they wouldn't overcook. I added lots of pepper & mushrooms..but you can season to your taste.  Really good and easy.

Easy, delicious and re-heats well.  You  should either cut the noodles by half or double the sauce and shrimp.

This tasted very good, however I, also, felt that it was missing something.  It didn't have quite the rich, flavorful taste that I really like.  I made the recipe and there was only "just-enough" sauce for my husband and I.  I will double the batch next time.  I cooked the shrimp separately in garlic and olive oil.  I also added the cheese right to the sauce during the last few minutes, it thickened up nicely!

The recipe definitely needs to be doubled for sauce and needs salt desperately. Otherwise, it was good.

This recipe is good but adding a little salt would be better. It's a bit bland without salt.

As always, I read all of the other reviews.  So I doubled the sauce.  To me the sauce was a little too  thin.  And as others mentioned, it's missing something.  I'm just not sure what.  I will definately make this again.  I"ll just have to play around with it and read more reviews.

This is a good recipe, but there isn't enough sauce and my family prefers a few more shrimp.  I ended up using half of the noodles for another dish because the sauce ran out.  I also added a couple of fresh broccoli crowns to the onion and garlic mixture, and I added the Parmesan cheese directly to the sauce to give it more of an alfredo flavor - otherwise it's just a milk sauce with some garlic and onions.  The next time I make this I will double the onions, half-and-half, and Parmesan cheese.  I thought there was enough garlic flavor, so I will probably keep this the same.  I will also reduce the pepper to 1 tsp. and add it directly to the sauce.  With these changes, I think it deserves 5 stars!

Not the best Alfredo I have tasted but still pretty good. Unless you want the shrimp flavour to permeate through your Alfredo sauce I suggest cooking the shrimp seperately in some garlic and butter and adding it to the sauce at the last minute. I used heavy cream and added the parmesan to the sauce. Also try this with fresh linguini pasta...there is no substitute!

WONDERFUL!!! My guests loved this one! I didn't have half and half so I used heavy whipping cream instead and it was great! Served with a simple spinach salad (tomatoes, Parmesan cheese, olive oil and vinegar) yum yum! I will use this recipe again and again.

This was good but know I did something wrong with the sauce.  It did not get thick at all.  I still enjoyed it but will have to figure out what I did wrong the next time.

This was quick and easy and tasted pretty good.  It seemed like it was going to be bland so I added a few spices like parsley, salt-substitue, and another time I added cajun seasoning, soul food seasoning.  It always has a good flavor.  I buy this package of small shrimp and havent had any issues with overcooking, unless I just dont know the difference.  Served with salad and was dinner was ready in no time.  Super quick.  And if you don't go adding alot of stuff, it is inexpensive.  The package of shrimp was less than $3 so it is a relatively inexpensive dish.

Very easy to make recipe.  Good flavor, the only problem I had was getting the sauce to thicken.  I didn't want to make the shrimp toughen up by cooking the sauce too long.  Next time I will make the sauce first and only after it's at the right consistency will I add the shrimp.

The key to alfredo sauce is this; equal parts cream, butter and parmesan.   Alfredo will always appear thin when done, then thicken upon standing and it will always taste like the strong cheese it is-There should be no mistake.  Also Real cream, not 1/2&1/2.  If you only have 1/2&1/2, use a conversion chart and add appropriate butter to make it heavy cream. Other than that, this recipe is great if you're looking for a lower fat creamy meal-This recipe is not alfredo sauce, It's garlic cream sauce with parmesan garnish. Very tasty, but not alfredo.

Very good and easy to make.  Only change I made was add some roasted garlic to it (since I made it the night before and had leftover cloves).  Delish !

Other than adding mushrooms & spices, removing the shrimp before thickening the half & half with cornstarch diluted in a bit of water, the recipe is wonderful. So fast and easy!

We all loved this. It was so simple, but tasty. I customized based on what I had on hand - no fresh parsley, lemon or half and half. I subbed dried parsley, lemon pepper (used less regular pepper) and whole milk respectively. I also added a pinch of red pepper (not too much because of the kids). And salt. Ofcourse. Great recipe - thanks for sharing!

I served this with lobster tails so I substituted shallots for the onions to give it a more delicate taste. Yummy! However, not enough for 1 lb. of pasta--I made about 3/4 lb--just moist enough.  Great flavor otherwise. Thanks 4 sharing!

A very good base recipe that can be seasoned to taste.  I use unsalted butter so I have to add sea salt at the end.  I added 2 tsp. flour to the sauce to thicken it and added more Half & Half than called for.  I reduce the amount of linguine to 10 oz since  I prefer a thick sauce and lots of it.  Tried it with scallops, and it was good as well.  I have made several times.  This last time I made with Fat Free Half & Half and it was still very, very good.

Yum! Yum! I made this recipe because we already had all the ingredients. I didn't even know how much i would enjoy it!  I vegan-ized it by using vegan butter and a bit of nutritional yeast instead of cheese. Subbed vegan half and half, too. I had trouble getting it to thicken up-- I'm just not patient enough-- I'd rather just STUFF IT IN MY FACE!

Delicious! I substituted plain yogurt for the cream; it gave the dish a tasty tang that I really liked. I also used a wee bit of flour to thicken the sauce a little faster, which I'm glad I did, because otherwise the shimp would've overcooked.

Really super easy to make.  My kids hated it because they said the shrimp was yucky, but my husband and I thought it tasted as good as any Shrimp Alfredo we've ever had at a restaurant.
The only thing I changed was mixing the parmesan cheese into the sauce while it was cooking as opposed to sprinkling on top.

I made this special for my husband, and he LOVED it!  Whenever I ask how his food is he says, "Good!"  Tonight I asked, and he said, "DELICIOUS!".  I'll make this again.  

Adjustments: I didn't have half and half, so I used 7/8 cp milk and 7/8 cp melted butter mixed as a sub.  The sauce was a little thin, so I added 2 tbsps of flour mixed with water (cornstarch sub.).  This thickened it up quite nicely.  Enjoy!

This was pretty good; simple, yet rich. My sauce never really thickened, but I didn't mind that much. Obviously, I didn't mind it enough to attempt to thicken it with cornstarch or anything. :) The only thing I did differently was to add the parmesan and parsley to the sauce instead of sprinkling on top. Tasty, thank you! ♥

This is excellent!  I sauteed the shrimp with the onion and garlic and removed to prevent over cooking.  Once I added the half and half I added some of the cheese which was the thickener versus corn starch.  I topped the pasta with the shrimp and poured the sauce over the shrimp which warmed them once again instead of over cooking them.  This dish is excellent!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I made this twice, once as a test trial type thing and second time for my boyfriend. Both times I didn't have the Parmesan cheese, because I didn't happen to have any in my house. Anyways, I felt the sauce was a little liquidy and not creamy enough. Also, I added more salt and pepper for flavouring.

I'm giving this 4 stars because I  did change quite a few things.  I  used jumbo, frozen shrimp. I cooked that with the butter, garlic and onion. Like others, I used 1/2 cup butter. Once the shrimp was cooked through, I removed it and made the sauce by adding the cream and cheese.  I also used heavy cream because that was all I had on hand. The sauce was pretty watery, so I cooked it a little longer to thicken it up.  I didn't have any cornstarch on hand.  After about 20 minutes, it was just right.  I also added some red pepper for a little kick and a pinch of salt when I returned the shrimp to the sauce. It took a little longer to cook than the recipe called for but it came out great and is pretty easy and quick to make.

As recommended, i added more garlic and more onions. I used some cornstarch to thicken the sauce and because i didn't have a full cup of half and half i completed the amount with heavy cream. I also used large shrimp. This dish was so incredibly quick and easy to do... and better than some i've had in restaurants.

Yummy, I followed some of the previous advice.  I used 1/2 lb butter, a generous amount of garlic, and removed the shrimp after they were just cooked through.  I used a pint of whipping cream instead of half n'half and added 1/4 cup wine.  On medium heat I let the sauce cook down, thickening nicely.  When the pasta was done cooking (we use whole wheat pasta in my house) I tossed it with a tablespoon of olive oil and a half cup of parmesan.  I will surely make this again, it is total comfort food. Thanks

I modified this recipe heavily.  I put oregeno, parsley, basil, pepper, lemon and salt in with the butter, garlic, and onions. I also added double the Parmesan cheese.  If I had had some descent white wine, I would have added that as well.  I also had to add about 2T of corn starch to thicken things up.  With these modifications, this dish turned out delicious, and I plan on making it again.

Not sure if it's worth the fat content.  Per other recommendations to increase the taste, I made these revisions: 2 c half and half, 1/2 c. butter, Parmesan and Ramano cheese, 1/2 c mushrooms, 1/2 c broccoli, dash of white wine and cajun seasoning.

Nice basic recipe. Next time I will add more half and half for more sauce. I also did not add all of the black pepper (that's a lot!), but I will be experimenting with this recipe to find something that gives it a little more flavor. Overall a nice dish.

This was so good.  Just like you would get in a restaurant.  Too bad it is so rich though, can only have it once in a while, but it is so worth it!!!  My husband really loved it, I served it with french bread and a nice bottle of wine, and had a wonderful dinner.  YUM!!! :)

Absolutely loved this!  I added salt to pasta water and also to sauce to taste.  We just added pepper to taste.  2 tsp. scared me - lol.  I increased butter to 1/2 cup and increased half & half to 2 cups as we like a lot of sauce.  I increased the onions 8 tablespoons and garlic to around 6-8 cloves (lost count! lol we love garlic). OMG - this sauce was sooooo good!  We grated some fresh parmesean and also fresh ramono cheese.  They were both good but I think I prefer the ramono.  I had the linguine pasta and also some angel hair.  Good on both - we love angel hair.  I only fed 2 and not much sauce was left.  Keep in mind if serving more people.  Highly recommend this one. (maybe I'll add mushrooms and a little broccoli next time - hmmm.....)

Cooking for one so i cut the portions drastically. The shrimp I cut down to only 5 and added almost every vegetable i had in my refrigerator that was left over from previous meals...Green Beans, asparagus, zucchini, roasted red pepper, yellow squash, fresh diced tomatoes. Throw the vegetables in at the last minute just to warm them. Vegetables are what the recipe missed.

Very very good!  Sauteed shrimp seperately with butter and garlic, since I"m vegetarian and hubby is not.  Used 1 cup heavy cream and about 1/2 cup of half n half.  Needed about 1T cornstarch to thicken.  Added about 4 cloves of minced garlic to sauce with the diced onion.  Easy, quick, and very good!  Would recommend!

I made this for Valentines day.  This was extremely good.  I would have to agree with others, this dish is not to be real heavy, and creamy.  Just a light creaminess.  You may have to give it another quick stir in your bowl before serving also.

Excellent dish- fabulous flavor. Do not expect a heavy-soupy conventional Alfredo dish. More comparable to a scampi consistency (healthier and lighter). Still fabulous. My only change was using Jumbo shrimp which aided in not overcooking while flavor was absorbed.

Tastes like what you would find at a restaurant. You will need to double if not triple the amount of sauce though....there is no WAY the amount of sauce is sufficient as written...that's not even one serving's worth. It's great, though!

This recipe has great potential, but to me it lacked the distinct flavors I like in Italian food.  I added a lot more garlic, parsley, and Parmesano Regiano, used fresh, coarse-ground black pepper and salt.  My daughter--a picky teen--loved it!  As far as it being an elegant dish, that is certainly true.  It just needed a bit of help to suit my family's taste.

We really liked this recipe, but it's nothing like Alfredo, if you ask me.  It's more like a creamy scampi.  I put lots more garlic and added about 1/2 cup of parmesan while cooking.  I also used a little lemon juice.  Very nice and very easy.  Served with homemade garlic knots.

I made this recipe for my boyfriend and he loved it! I did like most and doubled the sauce. I saute the shrimp, onion and garlic in some white wine and when the sauce was finished I added the shrimp. It goes great with garlic bread also.

this was ok. I used spaghetti noodles instead because that's what I had and added some red pepper flakes. I wish the sauce would have been a little thicker.

Actually this should be a 3.5 rating.  I agree with many of the other reviews in that the recipe was quite bland (missing flavor).  I followed the recipe as written, however, followed other reviewers advise and removed the shrimp from the sauce pan )about 2 mins sauted on medium heat (med size shrimp) before making the sauce and adding back in long enough to re-warm before serving.  This is a definate MUST, otherwise the shrimp would be overcook and be rubbery.  I also added extra garlic and other spices including a few red pepper flakes, oregano, etc. as mentioned in other reviews, being careful not to alter the recipe too much as written, but flavor was still missing.  While the dish was definately edible, my family was disappointed and suggested I try a different recipe next time.

I made some changes because we like garlic and I wanted to make sure I had plenty of sauce. I added 2 TB spoons of garlic (instead of 4 tsp) chopped very fine. One and half cups heavy cream and one half cup of cool water with 2 tsp corn starch stirred in it (as a thickener). I also used one cup of shaved parmesan cheese which I stirred in just before the shrimp. I thawed the shrimp and drained all water from them. The shrimp was in the sauce just long enough to heat them. They were still soft and juicey. We don't usually eat dishes like this very often, but when we do, I go all out. Just have a big salad with it!!

This was a great weeknight quick meal.  I used whole wheat pasta and about a pound of leftover shrimp I had peeled for shrimp cocktail the previous day for a party.  I mixed the parmesan in with the half and half to thicken the sauce.  I also thought it needed some salt with the pepper.  I added extra parmesan cheese to taste.  Very yummy given those modifications. Update:  I made this again and it is every bit as easy and delicious.  I wanted to mention that I used fat free half and half and it was still thick and rich thanks to the butter :-)

Great easy recipe. Sauce thickened up fine for me...After adding the half and half, keep the stove on high and constantly stir it. It took about 10 or 15 minutes to thicken up, but it did get thicker. Added the parmesan and pepper after, and mixed it all together.

Good stuff. This is very easy and simple to make. Only things I have to say are 1. I added a splash of lemon juice to the sauce. Yums. 2. It needs a bit more spice. Maybe some pepper in the sauce as well as on top, or extra onion and garlic... something. I have very bland taste, but this was too bland as is, even for me. 3. I agree with a previous comment about removing the shrimp after the 1 minute, and adding back in after the sauce has thickened. But all in all, a very good recipe. I will make again I'm sure. Thanks.

Excellent recipe!! You can always use flour if you want to thicken it.

I have made this several times and it is always a hit. I used the suggestion of cooking the shrimp and then the sauce. This works well. I added the shrimp back in about two minutes before I served the meal.

I made this recipe and my picky bf loved it! I changed it just a bit by doubling the sauce, cooking the shrimp seperate and then adding it right before serving. Also, I added breadcrumbs to thicken the sauce and a pinch of crushed red peppers for an added kick. It was wonderful!!!

I made this last night. It was phenominal. I did however alter it just a bit. I used an entire onion, about 4 or 5 cloves of garlic and I used 2 cups of the half and half as opposed to the 1 cup that the recipe called for. Also, I sauted the shrimp in a seperate skillet using just a bit of butter and then added it to the sauce of the last 2 or 3 minutes of the cooking time. This came out amazing. I will definately be making this again.

This recipe is amazing!  Very few ingredients and bursting with flavor. I did remove the shrimp from the pan after sauteing them to keep them from over cooking. The next time I make this I am going to make half more sauce. I just used a sprinkle of black pepper and a little salt but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I can't recommend this one highly enough.  I wish everyone would try it.

I LOVED this.  It was as good as any restaurant.  I used large shrimp because they were on sale. I also used a little bit of flour and parm. cheese at the end to help it thicken faster.
Yum. My whole family liked it!

Followed the directions as given other than added a little parmesan to the sauce toward the end to help thicken it up a little bit more. VERY easy and very good. Will be a keeper!

Yummy taste, however, the sauce is too thin.  But excellent taste!  I added some cayenne pepper to the shrimp while cooking and salt to the sauce.  My husband liked it also.

good recipe but the sauce didn't thicken so the second time around I changed the recipe a little. Added flour which thickened the sauce. I got the inspiration from  "Creamy Cajun Shrimp Pasta" from this site.

I made this for my husband to try and use up some leftover shrimp and he loved it! Next time I will add less garlic because he said there was a bit too much. Also, we didnt have any half and half so I used a half a can of cream of mushroom soup and a half a cup of whole milk and it came out great! He requested that I make this again, and again!

It's easy and quick. I added a little bit more half-and-half and pepper.  I added salt and mushrooms as i was cooking the shrimp.  I also added Cajun Seasoning powder to the shrimp while hte pasta cooked.  The dish came out great.

I will NEVER use a jar alfredo again!  I substituted heavy cream instead of half & half, as it was all I had on hand and used shredded parm.  Next time I will try half & half.  It was an absolute hit with the kids!

Incredible!  A total comfort food with great depth of flavor and, in addition, was a great presentation on the serving platter with the fresh parsley and lemon slices.  I used medium sized shrimp and added just a little bit of Old Bay Seasoning.  Every bite was a celebration to our tastebuds!

Meal had great flavor.  I doubled the amount for the sauce, and added 1/4cup white wine.  Because past reviews advised sauce to thin, I added 1 1/2Tbsp cornstarch.  Should have added less because sauce was way too thick. Other than that, great recipe. Will make again using less corn starch.

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  First of all, there was way too much pasta for the amount of sauce. Then, the sauce never did thicken up, and finally, by the time I gave up on the sauce, the shrimp was way overcooked and rubbery.  A waste of good shrimp.  I won't make it again.

This was fabulous.  I threw in some small diced tomatoes with italian seasoning that I had left over, and also a few shakes of red pepper flakes for just a LITTLE bit of spice.  It made sort of a rose sauce b/c of the tomatoes but it was excellent!

Very tasty and easy!  I used one and-a-half cups half-and-half and next time will use two because it was a little dry.  Used only 1 tsp of pepper and added salt to taste.  Very good recipe, a "keeper".  Thanks!

Absolutely wonderful! This got rave reviews from my family! I used pre-cooked frozen shrimp and cooked in the butter only until it was warm. I added about 4 teaspoons of cornstarch, about a teaspoon of Italian seasoning (and will use more next time), about half of the called-for amount of pepper, and the Parmesan cheese to my fat-free half-and-half mixture. It took about 10 minutes to thicken. I also used whole grain linguine, which made it taste even better! I STRONGLY recommend sprinkling some fresh lemon juice over this!! I used a lemon wedge per serving and that really added to it. I made a little extra sauce, but then spilled a pretty large amount of it on the floor :) so I think the called-for amount of sauce would be plenty (since that's pretty much what I came out with, if not less). The flavor is so strong that you really don't need to drown the shrimp and pasta in the sauce. My dad is already requesting this again this week.

Very yummy dish! I used a whole pint of the half and half for more sauce, & added about 1/2 a cup of parmesan cheese to the mixture while it was cooking.

Delicious.  I cooked shrimp in another pan as other reviewers suggested but had to anyway as one of my kiddos hates shrimp and sauteed some chicken breast tenders as well.  I sprinkled about a tablespoon of flour in sauce while whisking and a splash of sherry.  Very good, very easy and the family loved it.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent! Took others advice and doubled sauce, used heavy cream with chicken stock. Doubled cheese - will consider even more for next time. Added bell peppers, broccoli and instead of lemon slice garnish, I squeeezed a half a lemon into the sauce as per another's suggestion. Used approximately 2 tsp cornstarch to thicken sauce. Again beware: don't overcook the shrimp!

We had this for dinner on Christmas Eve and it was fantastic.  I did add fresh mushroom slices when I sauteed the onions and garlic.  Also threw in a splash of sherry at the very end.  Wonderful and easy company dinner.

Made this last night, it came out good but we followed others advice and added aprox. 1/2 cup white wine, 2 tsp. lemon juice, an addtional few tablespoons of parmesan cheese and a touch of corn starch to thicken.  It was alttle bland for my taste... but a good enough alfredo sauce.

Wow, this was amazing. I used a different type of spaghetti though because i wanted a more authentic look. Then when i was done making the Fettucini, i added Extra Virgin Olive Oil to it, and sprinkled black pepper then mixed it. Then my boyfriend heated the shrimp in the sauce so the shrimp weren't too hot, then i just threw it all together and it was an amazing mother's day present for my mother. Thank you so much for this recipe. And my boyfriend loved it so much, I'm making it for his parents next week.

My family liked this. I did make changes made. I used whipping cream instead of the half and half,used a 1/3 cup of red wine-instead of the white wine  ( that what I had on hand), seasoned bread crumbs to thicken and touch of lemon and parsley. I used everything else in the recipe. I will make this again...or some variation.

I have to agree, this recipe was quite bland.  I added some Old Bay seasoning to give it some taste.  Probably would not make again.

As written, extremely dry; not enough liquid and not enough parm for our tastes. Fortunately this recipe is very forgiving, so I just kept adding fat free half and half, parm and I even threw in a bit of whipped cream cheese. With these additions, my birthday girl and gang were thrilled with the outcome. Thanks!

Simple and delicious. 1st time making this and my hubby loved it. The milk took quite a while to thicken and added mix cheese and some basil to favour up the cream.

There actually wasn't that much flavor even though I made some alterations like were suggested. The best flavor in it was the scallions that I added right at the end before we ate!

This was a very nice surprise. I used heavy cream because I didn't have the HalfnHalf....just added some milk to it. For me, the trick was to let the sauce get thick enough. Also, next time I will make more sauce as my husband says there was not nearly enough of it.

This dish is to die for.  I added a big pinch of red pepper flakes, it really gives this dish a good kick. I mixed in the cheese while the half and half was thickening.  Very good and thank you for the recipe.

Easy and tsty.  I served this at a dinner party for 8, so I increased the recipe(hoping to have leftovers) everyone ate it like they would never eat again.  I served it with a spinach salad that has apples and red onion and a honey mustard dressing, and the best garlic bread from this site.  I had nothing left..But I guess that is a good sign.  I just like cold leftover seafood and was hoping...

Just followed general ingredient list, but changed by adding: havarti cheese (for creaminess), garlic powder (along w/ garlic), organic cream w/ a dot of butter from the cream, and FRESH lemon juice and parsely IN the sauce. Result=creamy and delicious :) It's even creamier after chilling in the fridge. Heavenly 0:-).

I was hesitant about this recipe at first because of the other reviews, but it was really quite fine. No recipes is set in stone so I added scallops, extra garlic, parmesan into the sauce, and thickened it up a bit with starch. Yum!

This was pretty darn good for being so quick. Mine didn't thicken so I just added the parmesan while stirring. Everyone loved it. I followed recipe exactly except omitted lemon and parsley - don't care for lemon and didn't have any parsley. Everyone liked it - so it goes in the permanent file!

My sauce didn't thicken up, and I found it taste bland. I added some Italian seasoning to it, and ended up adding half a jar of pre-made alfredo sauce to thicken it up.

This recipe is excellent, creamy and exactly what I expect when I think of alfredo sauce. The key is to use a good quality parmesean. I did add 1 T of cornstarch, as suggested by others, and I added the cheese during the cooking process. I made this for my husband's birthday and he said that it was the best he's had. This could only be improved by using fresh pasta - it's a keeper!

Well, overall a good recipe, though might need more tinkering with next time I make it.  I used heavy cream instead of half and half...this is just personal preference I suppose.  Also, I used half romano cheese and half parmesan.  Added the cheese (and other ingredients) during the cooking stage instead of afterwards so that it melts better.  As someone else mentioned, it comes out rather thin, but sticks well to the pasta and doesn't seem to affect the flavour, which was quite good.  The shrimp is an exceptionally tasty addition.

This was great!  I sauteed fresh mushrooms in butter w/garlic first.  Then I added a little bit more butter and white wine before I put in the shrimp.  Like others, I added about 1 Tbls. corn starch to avoid a thin sauce.  Thanks!

Overall, we thought this was a good basic recipe. It was so easy to make, just a little bit bland for our taste. We only used 9 ounces of pasta - turned out to be the perfect amount for the amount of sauce the recipe makes. Next time we'll add a little white wine for flavor and maybe some fresh mushrooms or broccoli to jazz it up.

After hubby's initial taste test, he said that it needs a lot of 'somethings'.  I will try again replacing some of the garlic with garlic salt, add more onion and maybe some bell pepper, mushrooms, thicken the sauce with cornstarch, and maybe just add extra Parmesan in the sauce.  As written, this was not for us.  Maybe it's just a little too simple, but use your imagination because it does have potential.

This is a keeper. I added fresh mushrooms and had to add about 1 teaspoon of flour to the sauce to thicken but a nice dish overall. Thanks!!!!

This was a great recipe and does taste like Red Lobster's.  I used salad shrimp and did not want to use half and half due to the fat content.  So I used flour and milk to thicken it.  If I ever make it again, I'll use raw shrimp and marinate it before to give it an extra garlic kick.  Since my husband's a meat and potatoes kind of guy, I probably won't be making it again.

After reading reviews, I decided to remove the shrimp after 1 minute of cooking.
I felt this sauce recipe was a good base, but after reading other reviews, I decided to increase the amount of butter and half and half. I also added sherry and cornstarch to the sauce near the end of cooking once I saw for myself that it would not thicken on it's own.  I added salt too.  I returned the shrimp to the sauce and simmered it a minute or two longer at the end.  
It turned out really nice, but only after I played with it to get it just right.

Double the half and half for sure but over all, this recipe rocks!  Taste as good if not better than restaurants.  I found this recipe as it is will only serve two though.  Toss in freshly diced tomatoes before topping with cheese and it is complete.  THANKS!

This was real easy to make. I doubled the sauce and put the cheese into it while still cooking, instead of on top. I think 2 tsp. of pepper was too much, even with the sauce doubled!! I put it into the sauce too. Next time I'll use white pepper. All in all this is a keeper!!

Amazing!!! I've never made shrimp alfrado before and this was easy and delicious!!

Mods: I doubled the sauce and it was the perfect amount.
-Used half skim milk and half heavy cream since that's what I had
-cooked the shrimp in butter onion and garlic then took shrimp out and added it back when the rest of the sauce was ready
- added 1c fresh shredded parm to sauce at the end

Fantastic!

I minced the onion, added about 5-6 cloves of fresh garlic (or however your heart desires), used a tablespoon of cornstarch and mixed that in with the butter and onion mixture. 
I did a whole cup of cream instead of half and half. I doubled the parmesan (the more you add, the thicker the sauce will be). Didn't add as much pepper as it says. 
But added the peeled shrimp after the sauce was made. I cooked then until it was pink. 
**Just like pasta, you never want to overcook shrimp**
After the sauce was made I added the last clove of fresh minced garlic.

Loved this easy to make sauce.  As many others have commented, I would thicken the sauce before adding shrimp.  I added cooked salmon pieces from leftovers at the time the shrimp was called for, but because shrimp cooks so quickly I recommend you add the shrimp before serving. Cooked shrimp only needs to be warmed up and uncooked shrimp takes about as long to cook as warm up; just a different tempurature. I would do the same if adding scallops.

Turned out great! This time i had to substitute a bit because i didn’t have much Parmesan left, but it was still amazing ! It also helps to add a bit of pasta water to thicken the sauce up a bit. I even added a dash of lemon juice to the shrimp!

This was okay if made as written.  The sauce did not thicken so I had to add some flour to abit of cream, also I didn't think there was enough sauce. Next time I'll make some changes as I felt it was missing something. I also think the shrimp should be removed after sautéing and added back in at the end.

This was great, but I didn't use the full amount of pasta and still there wasn't enough sauce - it could be doubled. I only used 1/2t of pepper, and added mushrooms, red pepper, and white wine. I cooked the sauce separately from the veggies and shrimp and combined it all with the cheese and pasta in the end.

My husband and I loved it! After tasting it 'as is' I added a couple shakes of  Italian herb mix because I didn't have parsley. I also added a big pinch of red pepper flakes with a lot less black pepper.  But we like spicy v.s. Peppery. Will make again. Please use wild shrimp if possible! Taste and smell s so much better!

Made this per recipe plus added the following to sauce while sauteing-chopped spinach, porta bella mushrooms, 1/2 cup white wine. Used white pepper instead of black. And please do remove the shrimp when cooked and allow the sauce to simmer. Loved the lemon garnish - really made the flavor sing. Also mixed whole grain & angel hair pasta. Served with re toasted buttered garlic bread for the crunch fix. The flavor was superb!

I didn't have the half and half that I thought I did, so used milk with the flour that others suggested. The recipe fell flat. I will try it again with fat free cream cheese.

We loved it and would definitely make it again! I did add a few changes,  I added a half cup of white wine during the onion and garlic. I also added considerably more parmesan and a half cup of sour cream while adding the half n half. I also used large shrimp instead of small..

Nice basic recipe to start with.   I added parsley,  chives, and a 1/2 block of cream cheese (about 4 oz).   I follwed this receipe exactly as explained and felt the shrimp was overcooked and rubbery by the time the sauce thickened and was ready to be served.  The next time I make this recipe I plan to cook the shrimp separately and add to the sauce just before serving.

This is such a good recipe.  The only difference that I made is that I added the parmesan cheese to the half and half and I added mushrooms.  This was so good and cheesy.

This is a really great recipe.  I made it on the weekend and I did the recipe as written but I did make my own linguine noodles.  Also added some lobster meat with the shrimp because it was Valentines Day and wanted something a little special.  My boyfriend said it was one of the best he had ever had which is a huge compliment.  This is going in my favourite recipes!  Thanks.

I have been making shrimp Alfredo for my family for twenty years. This is the best recipe ever!!! I purchased extra large jumbo shrimp from a really reputable fish monger so it didn't taste fishy at all! I agree that you should double the sauce. You are going to get out of this recipe what you put into it! I used high quality grated Parmesan cheese. It made all the difference in the world compared to grated Parmesan cheese. I did make a batch with gluten free penne pasta for my daughter and I because we have celiac disease and it was seriously the best thing I have tasted in a long time.

It was delicious, HOWEVER, we used less than 1 teaspoon pepper and it was spicy.  I can't imagine TWO whole teaspoons--eems to be a lot of pepper.  Maybe it should read 1/2 tsp pepper.

Good and garlicky.  Used olive oil instead of butter and doubled the sauce, adding 1t cornstarch and 1t black pepper, mixing the pepper and cheese directly into the simmering sauce.  Also removed the shrimp while preparing the sauce, adding back in to prevent overcooking.

This is just what I have been looking for.  It is fabulous.  I did make some changes.  I used butter and olive oil when I sauteed the shrimp and about 1/3 cup of white wine as the shrimp was gettting done.  I put freshly grated parm cheese in the sauce and then more on top when it was all done.  It was fabulous

My son was hungry and looking for something to make with some shrimp.  I gave him this recipe and it turned out excellent.  Loved everything about it, especially that it was easy enough for a 17 year old to make but elegant enough that it tasted like it came from a high end restaurant.  Loved it!!

Best Alfredo I've made yet!  I like that it uses half and half instead of heavy cream:  a little less fattening without compromising the creaminess or flavor.  I cut the black pepper back to about 1/2 t. and increased the Parmesan cheese to about 1/2 c.  I used pre-cooked shrimp and added them to the sauce at the very end.  I also added a few tablespoons of fresh basil at the end to give it more flavor.  To make sure it thickens well (has the "right consistency"), stir together the cooked sauce (it will still seem thin at this point), Parmesan cheese, and seasonings into the drained pasta using the pasta cooking pot, and let it stand for about 5 min. before serving.

This is one of our favorite recipes. It is very tasty, though a little on the heavy side (lots of yummy cream). The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because I sometimes have trouble getting the sauce to be the right consistency. Besides that... it's great!

This was excellent.....I am pretty much a novice cook and this turned out wonderfully. I doubled the base ingredients like others suggested and added 1/2 cup of white wine, and also added the parmesean cheese as the sauce was cooking. I also added a few red pepper flakes and used about a 1/2 yellow onion. Doubling the ingredients provided plenty of sauce for a box of linguini. My 4 and 7 year old kids both cleaned their plates and my wife told me that I am going to have to cook this at least once a month.

This was very eatible, but not what I was looking for.  I was expecting a thicker sauce with a more complex flavor, so I'll keep looking for a good alfredo sauce and use this when I want a simple garlic sauce.

This was absolutely delicious!!  I didn't change a thing - except to add the shrimp after the sauce thickened and to add dried parsley (didn't have fresh) to the sauce mixture.  IT WAS SOOOOOOO GOOD!  I will make this again for sure!

This recipe is divine!  I doubled the garlic, onion and half and half.  I also recommend removing shrimp after it is done and then adding back to your sauce when it is thickened.  I added about 1/2 cup parmesan to my sauce along with about 1 Tbsp cornstarch because the sauce wasn't as thick as I would like.  And I also used larger shrimp. The family loved it!!

Easy, fast and excellent.  What more can you expect!  Would be nice to try with one third white wine and two third cream.

We really enjoyed this!  Used mainly whipping cream, a lot less pepper, & a dash of nutmeg; added most of the parmesan with the sauce; added the shrimp after the sauce had thickened due to the fact I used precooked shrimp.

This was good but slightly bland. I added more garlic then it called for. I also used margaring insteatd of  butter because I didn't have butter. Maybe that is why it tasted alittle bland.  The sauce wouldn't get thick so I had to add some flour to thicken.

Sauce was defiantly on the thin side and there wasn't enough to go around, Tasted good though. Halved the shrimp and added asparagus which worked great. Sauce didn't taste very strong and I think it would be a good base to work with.

I used fresh ground pepper, just a little instead of the whole amount.  Then I let everyone crack additional pepper for their dish.  I used pet milk instead of half and half since it was all I had.  I put the garlic and onion through a food processor, since some don't like chunks of onion.  I also removed the shrimp and then added them back towards the end. Loved the dish, it will be a must for my diet bad days!

Oh my goodness!  Instead of Shrimp, add Johnsonville Cheddarwurst (cut up)!  It makes it so flavorful & yummy.  Great combination.  Also use 1/2 c butter and take out the onions.  Cook the parsley  and parmesan cheese in.

I followed the recipe almost exactly as written and LOVED it - hit the spot.
Since shrimp is not one of those foods you mess with, I did take it out of the skillet just before adding the half and half then threw it back in when the sauce was ready.
I also omitted the parsley since I didn't have any. Oh! I just realized I forgot the lemon. I'll add these next time!

This recipe is very yummy, the only thing is it was not as thick as I would have liked it to be. But it still tastes very good. I followed other reviews and added the shrimp later.

I used jumbo shrimp that I cooked separately for 5 minutes in boiling water.  Then added the shrimp to the half & half/butter mixture and poured everything over the cooked pasta.  Easy and good.  Would make this again.

A very rich sauce, the secret to thickening the sauce is toss a handfull of Ramano cheese and seasoned breadcrumbs.
If you like a little heat to the bland sauce I added a few red pepper flakes and cajun seasoning when cooking the shrimp. Do not over cook shrimp. A keeper recipe.

Used fat free half and half and added a little cornstarch...I don't like parsley and the BF doesn't like lemon. Thought it tasted pretty good. Had no linguine so used thin spaghetti.

Don't waste your time making this.  The sauce did not thicken.  You are better off buying alfredo sauce in a jar and adding shrimp.

My husband thought this was very bland, but 5 yr old daughter loved it and asked me to make it again.  I was in the middle; didn't love, didn't hate.  I think I will try other shrimp pasta recipes.  If I don't find a better one, I will doctor this one up.

This was great. I made this for my husbands birthday party and it was a hit! I did add some cornstarch to the sauce because it was not thickening quick enough.  I kept adding cornstarch little at a time until it started to thicken.  Delicious!  Thanks

Awesome recipe! Only thing I changed was to stir in the Parmesan while the sauce cooked, plus I had to add corn starch to thicken it (which can become lumpy, so I try not to add too much).  Top with some extra Parmesan.  Excellent, even reheated.

This was a wonderful recipe. The flavor was outstanding. Not only was it fast, but had to be one of the easiest recipes to make. This sauce is also wonderful to use with clams. Only made enough for 4 servings, but next time will double it.

It seems that everyone likes this recipe, but my family just thought it was okay.  Had to double the sauce and even then there wasn't very much (perhaps I cooked it too long?).  The bottom line is an awful lot of calories for something that's just so-so.

This was an excellent dish. The only thing that I will change next time is less noodles and more garlic. ( I just prefer my alfredo a little creamier) My 6yr old even loved it. Thank you.

Excellent dish.  The sauce was a little on the thin side.  I added more than the recommended cheese and that thickened it a bit.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It's nice when you're hungry for a good pasta dish, but don't want to spend hours blending spices and letting things simmer. I've made this many times, and will make it many times more!

This was so good, it was sinful.  I used 20 small shrimp, 20 small scallops, and as much lobster as I felt like - added a bit more 1/2 & 1/2 as a result.  So, so good!  I'll be making this "SEAFOOD ALFREDO" forever!  Thanks for giving me a headstart on an excellent recipe!

This was great!  I made it for my boyfriend and he also loved it.  I made a couple changes, I was trying to get rid of some bottled alfredo sauce so i poured it in instead of the half and half, and I added some fine herbs and basil.

This was my first attempt at an alfredo sauce, and it didn't turn out half bad.  I guess I'm really critical because I've had some really excellect alfredo sauces before...  As I was cooking, I was a little concerned about the thickening (or lack there of) of the sauce, so I added a little cornstarch, which, in turn, made the sauce a little too thick.  If I make this recipe again, I will also remember to add more salt to the sauce.

This was good, but a little complicated for me.  The flavors were good, but I had a difficult time getting the sauce the right consistency.  Will probably not try again.  For an experienced cook, this is a good recipe.

Delicious!  I added extra cheese and some red pepper.  I also added some sauteed asparagus and bell pepper.  Yum!  Added cornstarch as another reviewer suggested.

Made this recipe and loved it!! My husband usually shies away from alfredo sauces, but not this one. He absolutely loved it! And so do I! This recipe is definitely a keeper in my house. I added a couple things like mushrooms and red onion and bell pepper.

I have made this recipe a couple of times, because it is a very easy way to cook shrimp. It's good, but I am still looking for a better shrimp recipe... I gave 4 stars.

Excellent recipe that requires very little prep time. Next time I will add a little more half and half to smooth out the sauce -- got too thick. Also, an off-the-shelf Parmessan cheese like Kraft probably isn't the best bet. Made mine a little sweet.

The best we've had.  We ordered this meal in a rest. and paid $16.00.  It was not as good as this recipe we made ourselves--great find for a meal to keep on hand for unexpected company(to use with frozen shrimp).

I used frozen uncooked peeled w/tail on shrimp instead of fresh, worked fine. Just ran the frozen shrimp under cold water for 10 minutes. The flavor of the dish is great, husband and daughter really enjoyed, along with self:)

My husband could not get enough of this.  I had to make an extra batch of sauce though.  We had more pasta than sauce the 1st go-around.  I will definitely be making this again.

Very Easy to Make! My fiance was very impressed. She
even bragged to her friends that I can cook this well.
If you like your sauce a little thicker I would recommend
using a little more butter, and Half & Half. Overall
it is a Wonderful recipe. Great Job TINA!!

Very Good! The only change I made in the recipe was that I added the grated cheese to the sauce while cooking instead of just putting it on after the sauce was cooked. I also used grated locatelli instead of Parmasean. I would recommend this dis with those changes.

I am a tough on recipe rater, especially when it comes to Italian food.  I married a sicilian man and he expects the best. This recipe is not bad at all.  It is just simple and is needing a little something more other than the parsley and mushroom I added extra.  Make sure not to thicken the cream souce too much!

This recipe was so easy and turned into such an elegant meal.  I added a can of lump crabmeat along with the shrimp(because there's never enough seafood for me!).  Next time I'll try adding mushrooms.
