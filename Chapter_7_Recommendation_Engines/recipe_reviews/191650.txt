I made this for my kids this morning for breakfast, using up the last of a package of bacon I had leftover from making soup a couple days ago. Believe it or not, they loved it. I took a bite just for posterity and thought it was unique but not my style. They flipped for it though, and that's what matters. The toasted bread is crucial to make this sandwich work. I'll make this again.....for them.

This was delicious, quick, and easy. The only thing I did different was use Honey-wheat English Muffins. This is really going to be fixed a lot around here in the future!

It was ok..I couldn't really taste the honey so I added jelly instead which in my opinion made it better

I really enjoyed the flavor combination of this! The only change I made was to use white bread. I would make this again if I wanted something different. This was tasty! Thanks for sharing. :)

I think I'd heard of a sandwich combo like this before, and I like all the ingredients, so I gave it a try. I made it exactly as written. I'd never bought applewood smoked bacon, but managed to find some (it wasn't cheap!). I didn't cook the bacon by time ("about 10 minutes"), but by feel, and I think it took less than that. My slices of whole wheat bread were larger than the usual small squarish bread. It was a pretty tasty sandwich - not the best ever, but still worth making again, especially since I have the ingredients on hand still. One minor quibble: I thought there was too much honey here, as maybe half of it dripped off the sandwich while I ate it. I'm not a huge fan of honey anyway, so maybe I'll cut it in half next time.

A total comfort food for me.  If I have them on hand I'll also add a sliced banana.  Yummy!

Wow! Great combination of sweet and salty! I love peanut butter so I had to give this a try and I'm glad I did. I was a bit liberal with the peanut butter and the honey added a nice touch of sweetness. This proves that bacon really does make everything taste better...even a peanut butter sandwich!

Hit the spot! I didn't measure anything but it turned out fine. Used 12 grain bread and syrup would work if that's all you have. Yummy salty sweet snack or breakfast!

I often use a PB/Honey combo on a wheat english muffin...the bacon pulled it up a notch and it was already yummy!  Make a bunch of bacon in advance for a quick and somewhat nutritious fast breakfast or snack.  Also, because the EM is smaller than reg bread, one strip of bacon suffices so you save a few calories but the sandwich is still great.

This was incredible!  It's a great way to eat bacon if you just want bacon and don't feel like making a big breakfast to go with it.  Another great excuse to eat bacon!

Buckwheat honey if you have some of that and don't know what to do with it this recipe if perfect for it. It is strong enough to stand up to the bacon and peanut butter without getting lost like some jave said the honey did. Talk about YUMMY with buckwheat honey and thick cut twice smoked bacon I did not even miss the PB when I tan out.
