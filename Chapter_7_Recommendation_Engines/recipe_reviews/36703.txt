I really liked this recipe.  I did add a couple changes though.  Instead of frying this in flour, I skipped the flour and frying the shrimp right away.  I marinated the shrimp overnight in the sherry with the spices and then I fryed it the next day.  Other than that little change, this was simple to fix and everyone thought that it tasted wonderful:).

My husband liked this dish, but it had too much thyme for me.  If I make it again, I will substitute something else for it.  I served it with wild and long grain rice with garlic and almonds as recommended, but I think next time we would prefer it over angel hair pasta.  It went well with a nice Riesling.

Not really that flavorful - it needed something else to give it a kick, but I couldn't figure out what it was.  I think that if I liked green peppers I'd have liked it more.  It seemed a lot like non-spicy jambalya.
