Absolutely terrific. I am Swedish and have been looking for a way to make Kladdkaka on my own. This is it. I only had a 9" glass pie plate (rather than 8" as the recipe calls for) and it worked perfectly. You get a crisp/gooey crust and a sticky, moist inside. Note that the top will sort of collapse and crack as the cake cools. This is normal and authentic! Also, you must let it cool completely or it will just seem runny. Most importantly, for those of you who felt the cake was too liquid: it is all about how you mix the batter. Beat the egg/sugar mixture for a good 5 mns with an electric beater. But stir just a little with a spoon when you mix in the flour mixture and the butter. A total of 30 strokes should do it and it should be by hand. This way, you'll get just the right consistency. Awesome with a bit of freshly whipped cream and a cup of coffee.

okay, I have to ask!  Did anyone manage to let this cool before getting into it?  I tried hard.  Thought I would just cut it into 8 pieces while still warm.  Then I thought I would just snag a small piece of the crust of 1/8th, and then the fork was in there, and now the bowl is out cause I need to make another one so there will be something when the kids get home!  I used a 9" light coloured cake pan and sprayed with cooking spray.  No problem at all.  Also cut back on the sugar to 1 cup (to make it a diet cake of course)  :) and it is wonderful.  Thank you so much for this recipe!!! I'm thinking those that did have a problem have most likely over stirred.  Important to just gently rotate with a fork, no electric mixer!!  These are very much like making brownies, so just a little stir to mix will do ya!  Happy baking all!  Lorrie

WOW. This is the best cake I've ever tasted! Great recipe!

Oh, and I also learned that if you cut the recipe in half, the result is a delicious batch of brownies!

Maybe not the prettiest, most perfect looking dessert, but that is quite possibly part of its appeal.  I made this on a whim, needing something for a last minute dessert when time got away from me and I no longer had enough of it left to make what I originally planned.  Thanks to AR and its reviews, I came across this recipe and was instantly sold.  And what a big pay-off for the little time and effort I put into it. It’s REALLY gooey when it’s warm and, granted, it does cut more neatly when it’s cold – but it’s sooo much better warm!  Reminiscent of a molten chocolate lava cake but in addition to the creamy, gooey, oozing middle, you have a very delicious, light, crispy, almost chocolate wafer-like crust.  This was an enormous hit with the “boys” at the dinner table tonight.  They couldn’t have cared less I’m sure, but in addition to a good plotch of whipped cream I prettied it up with fresh red raspberries and the ubiquitous sprig of fresh mint.

I exchanged the flour and chocolate in this recipe.  So I used 1/2 cup chocolate and 1/4 cup flour.  I did this because we are trying to cut white flour in our diets.  Plus we are big choclate fans.  I followed the rest of this recipe exactly.  And it turned out beautifully.  I did serve it slightly warm though, and it had the texture of a starbucks cake with the gooey center.  After it was completely cooled it had the texture of a cross between fudge and brownie.  Brownie on the outer edges and fudge on the inside.  Overall a definite keeper, it is going into my recipe book!! We had this for Valentine's day and we decorated the top with a little whip cream and peppermint candy on top.  Since it was warm the peppermints melted slightly and added a nice flavor to the cake.  :)

Wonderful and decadent!! This cake is a cross between a chocolate pudding cake and chewy, moist brownies. Heavenly!! Although I am part Swedish, I was not familiar with this recipe. I am glad that I came across it when I was researching Swedish recipes. Very quick and easy.I beat the eggs and sugar for 5 minutes, as suggested by another reviewer.  I used a buttered 7" glass pie plate and baked it for 30-35 minutes. Be sure to bake on the bottom rack  of oven to avoid it from becoming too overdone on top. Wonderful topped with cool whip and drizzled with melted chocolate chips. Best served warm. It has become a part of my favorite recipe collection. Yummy!!!

Great Recipe. I'm Swedish too, and I can vouch for this recipe being the real, traditional deal. Don't hold back on the pinch of salt, as it complements the sweetness beautifully. You can also lightly coat the greased form with a mix of bread crumbs and a tiny pinch of salt before you pour the mix, for added texture and flavor. 350 degrees at 30 minutes also works well, for those that want to bake it at a higher internal temperature.

I followed the instructions exactly as written and it did not turn out.  I cooked it until the top was way more than "just set" and it was still raw on the inside.  It also stuck to the pie plate really bad even though I greased it.  It might need to be buttered and floured or something.  I tasted a little bit that got cooked and it was pretty good.  I doubt I'll make this again though, I would rather just make brownies.  Thanks anyway.

Fast to make a real sugar fix for sure, turned out just as described a bit like brownies but much sweeter than the average one.  Buttery,  not too chocolaty and soft, yum, could eat the entire pan :)

I used almond extract, since I am out of vanilla. It was really good, gave it a bit of a Kahlua flavor!

We took it to a pot luck, and everyone loved it!

This is one of the best quick and easy cakes you can make!!  Absolutely delicious and addictive.  I double the Vanilla Extract and make a few variations adding a tablespoon or 2 of Bourbon or half a teaspoon of Espresso and a tablespoon or 2 of Espresso Vodka.  You'll be famous in no time after you serve to to a few friends and family.

This is awesome. I didn't change a thing and I have made it a few times now. It's something I always have the ingredients on hand for. I must say, although the recipe says let cool for an hour,  we usually leave it for about 15 mins. In my family, if your not around shortly after this comes out of the oven - you lose!

Truthfully, I decided to make this because kladdkaka was served in an episode of the TV show Archer (Season 1, "Killing Utne").  I'm so glad I did.  If you've ever wanted to eat warm brownie mix, this is the recipe for you.  I sprinkle just a little powdered sugar on top right after it comes out of the oven and serve it with coffee or milk.  I recommend eating it while watching Archer.

This is delish.  Chewy and gooey.  I think I may have baked it a little to long, but that is something to improve on next time, and there will be a next time.  I also followed the reviewers advice to beat the sugar and eggs for 5 min.  Many thanks to the submitter

Absolutely delicious! Since I don't like things very sweet I only added 1 cup sugar. I used a non-stick cake pan  so I had no sticking problem. For little cakes I like to use my small convection/toaster oven.  Because of the convection, I reduced the heat to  325 and baked for only 20 minutes, let it sit about 30 minutes and then just couldn't stop eating it once I got that first bite! Mine was not at all gooey - just crusty on the outside and soft/firm on the inside. Will make again and again.

Since it was too long since I posted this recipe, I cant edit it, so if you want a firmer cake, just bake in the MIDDLE of the oven.
Sorry being away for so long, life just got in the way.

Rather disappointed with this one. Baked at 300 degrees for 35 minutes (on the lower rack of my oven). Let it cool for an hour and it came out so under baked that we couldn't eat it.  Stuck it back in the oven at 350 degrees and now we wait...

Holy cow this was yummy! Made it on a whim one afternoon. It was so gooey and chocalatey, almost like brownies, and it didn't last long! As a bonus, made the house smell so good while it was baking. Will make it again and again!

This is supposed to be like an undercooked brownie and while most serve it with whipped cream, some even serve it with vanilla sauce which is quite nice.  This is an easy, tasty recipe but as one poster stated it's not the cake you want to serve when presentation matters.  Also, keep in mind that it SHOULD have the texture of a huge undercooked brownie ESP near the middle.

I prepared and baked according to recipe directions, and the top definitely set and formed a crispy top within 35 mins.  Unfort, it was not set.  I put back in oven at 350 for another 20 mins, then cooled and refrigerated overnight.  It is now cuttable and even still "sticky" in the middle, but it is overwhelmingly sweet like fudge- not cake. I won't make this again.

I made this for a Kräftskiva in August and everyone loved it- Americans and Swedes. I made it a second time for my boyfriend and he asked that I reduce the sugar (I used only a cup) and he loved it even more. I served it with lightly sweetened homemade whipped cream. It was great served warm or cold.

I followed the recipe as written and we enjoyed it and I will make again, but I will cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup and I will add some coffee granules to the cocoa powder because we just found it to be too sweet.  I may also try using dark cocoa powder.  In all, a good recipe to start from - Thanks for sharing!

I live in Sweden (moved here from Texas) and was looking for an easy kladdkaka recipe. This was it! Made it directly as stated except I didn't have any vanilla extract (can't find it here???). It is kind of tricky since usually you stick a toothpick in to see if it done, but you want the insides to be fudge-like and gooey. I just stick the toothpick on the corner and check until nothing sticks there. Came out perfect! Also, personally I like it chilled in the fridge overnight. My Swedish fiancé likes it with vanilla sauce on it. I prefer ice cream. :)

Great Recipe! Mine didn't come out runny at all, it just came out moist and almost like fudgy brownies. I used 1 cup of sugar cause i didn't want so much sweetness in the cake. I'll definitely make this again

OK, I just made this (during a major storm) and at first I thought I had completely screwed it up because it was "jiggly" when I took it out (I baked it an additional 10 minutes because I thought I had messed it up!).  But now I see that it is meant to be that way....well, I think it is!  It doesn't matter because I'll still eat it!!  Chocolate is chocolate and this has a wonderfully "different" taste to it.  It is wonderful, whether made perfectly or screwed up!!!!  :)  YUM!!!!

Delicious! I used double the chocolate and 1/3 cup less sugar. This was definitely sweet enough for me.  I also added walnuts. Yum!  Don’t over cook and you will have a gooey, chocolate delightful treat.

I wouldn't have called this 'sticky', more like runny and uncooked.  I don't know what went wrong, or what to do right, but I won't try it again.  It was very sweet, too sweet in my opinion.  The kids liked it (solid sugar, why wouldn't they??)

Beat eggs well, add sugar, melted butter  & vanilla.  Combine two mixtures and blend well but do not beat.  After baking and cooling,  cut into pieces and freeze.  Great frozen treat.

I made this exactly as per the recipe. I have had swedish kladdkaka in Sweden, and my husband is a born and raised Swede. He said it was perfect. The only change we agreed the recipe could use was less sugar. I'll halve it next time. But man, this is so easy and delicious!

I give this recipe 4 stars because although the taste and texture were lovely, I was expecting something a bit different based on the name and this is really just a thin chewy brownie. I didn't have a pie plate so I made this in a small metal pan and it did stick ALOT even though it was greased. Very tasty and quick to throw together. I make this before dinner then have dinner while it is cooling.

Great! Careful though, I didn't hear the alarm and over cooked it by about 4  minutes and so lost all of the gooey  middle. Cracks me up that a lot of the bad reviews for this are by people who didn't realize it should be like a chocolate lava cake: its supposed to be gooey  in the middle ;-) next time I will cut back on the sugar though. It is VERY sweet. Super easy and so good for chocolate cravings!

Yummy!!! I made it for my Book Club the other night and it was definitely a hit. One lady left with another piece in her purse!!

I think the next time I make it though I will use a little less vanilla.

This is really good! I highly recommend letting it cool. I couldn't wait so I stuck it in the freezer after it cooled for about 20 minutes (be careful doing this if you use a glass pie plate!) It turned into brownies/fudge. Yum!

Yummy and sticky!  I changed out a few tablespoons of sugar for brown.  For another great swedish cake try the tuppakaka- also crispy on the top and little gooey in the middle but without the chocolate...

THIS IS AMAZING!!!! I think its probably the best chocolate cake i have ever eaten. Its like toffee, bubt in the form of chocolate, hehe. So my cake was changed slightly, due to my ingredients at hand. I just maiz corn flour, instead of baking flour, and instead of half a cup of butter, i used a quater of butter and a quater of sunflower oil. I melted it all and then put it into the mixure. I used a slightly bigger dish, so my cake is probably only just one inch thick, BUT IT IS AMAZING!! And if you are reading this, good, because you have just read a review on the best chocolate cake in the world and  now hurry to go make it! and make sure there are as few people around so you have more than just a tiny slice for yourself. The best thing would be do bake it a night, with everyone sleeping. But the smell is also so amazing, and would wake everyone up!!! :S

Tastes pretty great, only it came out just like a brownie. It wasnt 'sticky' for me. Perhaps it was my oven. However they still tasted good. 4 stars, highly recommened :)

Fantastic simple dessert! It is like chewy brownies around the edges, with a gooey center with rich silky pudding texture when warm then sets to a dense chocolaty truffle. My pie plate is 9", so I baked it in an 8" square Corelle Ware baking dish. Perfect with whipped cream- great easy small yield treat.

Such an easy, delicate, small dessert.  
Just enough for a dinner party.
Easy to "dress up" with a few raspberries & ice cream.

I suggest definitely using dark cocoa powder if you can!

Omg this recipe is to die for! I am half Swedish and was dying for a good Kladdkaka recipe and was so happy to come across this one. It’s ridiculously easy to make, pretty hard to mess up and so delicious! I literally made it three times within the first 2 days of finding the recipe. My kids couldn’t get enough of it and ask for it almost daily now.

Came out nicely.

I made this recipe because my husband likes the show Archer and there was an episode where they have this dish for the desert. I made it exactly as directed and it came out delicious, everyone liked it, they said it tasted like gooey brownies. yummy

This is like a large lava cake, very yummy! I am lazy and hate doing extra dishes, I mixed the batter right in the pie plate. I bake mine for 35 minutes, I think it was perfect for us, let cool for 30 minutes, served with whipped cream. A great addition to our Swedish themed dinner.

I needed a chocolate fix, and this took care of that! I halved the recipe and used a small baking dish. I cut back a little on the sugar and would even cut back further.  I sprinkled the top with about 1 tblsp of semi-sweet chocolate chips and baked for about the 35 min mentioned. I'd take it out sooner than that to have more of the gooey effect. I was not able to wait the hour mentioned. I just had some right from the oven with whipped cream and it was fine.

I followed the recommendation to not overbeat, but it still got terribly stuck to the pan. The taste was great, but probably I will stick to brownies...

This is ooey gooey and good! Four stars only because I thought it needed to have a bit more salt to counteract all of that sweet. So maybe increase it to 1/4 tsp of salt? I whipped some cream for the top but vanilla ice cream would be great with it. My kids loved it! Thanks for posting the recipe!

the main thing is that it's very quick and handy when you need a cake for unexpected company and are in a hurry. Mine was good, if a bit disappointing as it wasn't lusciously gooey as in the picture. It did stick to the pan a bit, and it was a bit brownie-like. Next time I'm going to decrease the permanence into the oven

Swedish American here whom had 100s of sticky cakes in the past! This was the best I've made. So yummy with whipped cream! I've made it now 3 times and tweaked it a little bit.  1 cup sugar and 1/4 cups chocolate chips. I think the low temperature and the 35 minutes is the secret for the amazing crust and perfect sticky, semi melted inside.  Thank you!

I made this twice, both times with only one cup of sugar. I cooked it in a light cake 8" cake pan and made sure to stir just until the mixture was mixed. The first time I made it I left it in the oven for 30 minutes, but one I took it out it was more like a brownie. Assuming I just overcooked it, I made it again a day later leaving it in the oven for 20 minutes, it was a bit more sticky, but still very brownie like and I never got a cracked top. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but be very careful not to over bake! It does taste good, but I wouldn't say it's as good as a brownie. Maybe you need all the sugar...idk?

Nice recipe that's simple, quick, and uses stuff most people keep around their house. My biggest complaint is that it's too sweet and the cocoa flavor not deep enough. If I made it again, I would decrease the sugar to 1 C and increase the cocoa to ½ C.

Loved this with a little vanilla ice cream...., but a little goes a long, long way... Well, it did for both my family and friends who shared this with us.....  Really, this is soooo rich!!!  I personally can't begin to imagine eating half a batch. My husband specifically stated that he would not want this often, because he would tire of it, but he would enjoy it for a special occasion or a special dinner from time to time.   --- We did beat the eggs and sugar with an electric mixer for the five minutes suggested.  That sounded like a long time, but I enjoyed watching the eggs and sugar fluff up into a lovely, satiny, smooth mixture.  The rest of the ingredients folded in wonderfully.  We made five batches (for a big group), so we divided this between two 9x13 casseroles - well, one was a stoneware that was a little bigger than 9x13.... don't remember the exact #'s, but we did calculate that the two pans were just shy of the same square inches as 5 - 8" pie plates.  Well, dividing the final batter between the pans was a little awkward because some of the foamier portions rose to the top, and dividing that about evenly was a minor challenge. --- Other than that, we had to cook this longer than suggested, especially for the casserole that was in a baking stone.  End result?  Love it! - but will probably cut back on the sugar next time.......

I made this for my Swedish boyfriend and we absolutely loved it! He said it was the best kladdkaka he has ever had. I mixed together the eggs, sugar, vanilla and butter with a hand mixer for about two minutes then gently stirred in the flour mixture with a spoon. Baked on lower oven rack for 35 minutes exactly and let sit for 20 minutes.  Gooey, chocolatey deliciousness. Served with freshly made whipped cream. Couldn't have asked for a better result!

I was in two minds how to rate this cake, firstly even though I baked in a glass dish which had been greased, it was still incredibly difficult to remove, so the overall presentation is not good.  My Swedish friend enjoyed the cake but found it too sweet compared to the Kladdkaka she eats back in Sweden.  Glad I made the cake, as I wanted something Swedish but because it was not very appealing to look at, I will not make it again, but it does taste yummy !!!

This was a pretty tasty cake...it had the taste and texture of a very gooey brownie. I thought it was overly sweet, though...I served it with whipped cream, which helped cut the sweetness a little. Some of my family loved it, and some didn't like it at all. This is a very rich cake...thanks for sharing!

Very easy and delicious.  Very rich and gooey.  This is definetly not a cake to service when presentation is important though because even after letting it cool for the hour the inside is very soft and gooey and so it all kind of crumbles together when you cut a piece.

This recipe is so good!! I made it for a school project and everybody loved it! You just have to make sure that you cooked it long enough. It is also so easy to make. My sister is making it as a snack and she's 8! Best recipe! House favorite!! :)

WOW! How can you eat more than one piece of this at a time?  I made this for my mother-in-law's birthday and we all enjoyed a piece, but it is definfinately sweet.  She did ask for the recipe however so she must have liked it.  I think I will occasionally make this agian, but probably wont become a regular.  Thanks for the recipe.

I live in Stockholm right now and can say that this is the best kladdkaka I have had. There is one cafe here that serves a similar one and I have been testing different recipes trying to replicate it.  This one comes closest.  I have served it as dessert at dinner parties - warm with a bit of powdered sugar, unsweetened whipped cream, and fresh rasberries.

I don't know what wrong, but this did not turn out at all. It was runny and not cooked all the way through. No one liked the taste and we ended up tossing it.

The title says it all - sticky and chocolaty! Yummy. I followed the recipe exactly (almost impossible for me!) except I doubled it and baked it in individual ramekins. They turned out soft & fudgy in the middle with a light crust all around. I was surprised when the tops caved in as soon as I took them out of the oven but it gave them a rustic look. I WILL make this again.
