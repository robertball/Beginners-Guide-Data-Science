I posted this recipe a while ago....after reading everyone's reviews we decided to try cooking this in our crock pot.  I had never thought about it before and would only make this when I was home for most of the day.  It really worked out well.  We cooked it for about 4 hours on low and then put it on high and cooked for another 2 and a half.  It was tender and delish but I think it could have been a little more tender so next time I will cook on low all day about 8 to 10 hours.  Everyone really loved it...even my mom who taught me how to make this thought the crock pot was a great idea.

My husband loved this recipe.  I used shoulder steaks instead of butt steaks, after 2 hours it was falling off the bones.  Made cheesy mashed potatoes with it, turned out great.  One of our new favorite recipes.  Will definitely fix it again.

I did this in my crock pot. My husband usually doesn't like pork, but he loved this. He is part Filipino, and eats rice with everything, so I served it over a bed of jasmine rice- and I loved it too! Thanks for the recipe and everyone's great reviews that convinced me to try it!

I wanted to do something different with the pork butt steaks I had on hand.  I usually just sprinkle with Season All and bake or grill.  Came across this recipe.  Glad I did.  The steaks came out amazingly tasty.  I still sprinkled with Season All, baked at 350 for about 15-20 minutes.  Then covered with sliced onion and a mixture of 1 cup Sweet Baby Rays and water (did not have ketchup).  I continued to bake, uncovered, for another hour or so.  The meat just fell apart.  The onions were so good.  Next time I will slice up about 3 onions.  I basted the onions and exposed steak with the sauce a couple of times.  My husband could not stop raving.  This is a keeper!

My husband bought the meat, so I'm not sure what kind of cut I was using, but I think it was a pork shoulder blade steak. Whatever it was, 16oz of liquid was enough to cook it in. Rather than using a cup of ketchup, I used an 8oz can of tomato sauce, and mixed in about 1T brown sugar, 1T vinegar, 1/4t cinnamon, 1/4t dry mustard, a of pinch allspice, and a pinch of cloves. (Essentially a ketchup recipe, except with tomato sauce instead of tomato paste.) I then used the can to add 8oz water, put in the onion, and let it cook away. Every half hour or so I used a pair of tongs to rotate it. About three hours later I took out the meat, removed the fat and bone, tore the pork into chunks, and served with with the sauce over gnocchi. It was tender and flavorful, and quite easy to make.

Excellent recipe!  I will make again and again.  I did make a couple adjustments.  I do not like ketchup, so to tame the sweetness, I used 2 C ketchup, 1 C water, and 1 C strong brewed coffee.  I also added minced garlic, ground red pepper, salt and pepper to the liquid before adding it to the meat.  After simmering 3 hours, the meat was just as tender as promised.

This was excellent. I was a little skeptical about the ketchup, but it turned out to be just perfect. And the meat was so tender, it fell right off the bone. My husband didn't even wait for me to come home from work before he ate his! He said it was the best pork dinner he'd ever had. I'll definitely be making this again in the future.

This is fantastic!!  I made it just how the recipes said but I cooked it for about 4 hours.  The meat was so tender if was falling right off the bone and practically melts in your mouth.  The ketchup makes a wonderful sauce and the onions add great flavor.  My family loved this, I think it will be a new favorite.  A must try!

These were awesome!  I can't believe how tender they were. We all loved them.  Well, all except for my 6 year old son. I made him try it, which he liked but refused to eat because of the name.  I didn't find out until after supper that he thought it was called, "Juicy butt STINKS!"  ha ha. I wouldn't recomend telling children what they're called.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I wish I had made more!

I was skeptical of the ketchup/water sauce, but it turned out great. This was our New Year's dinner.  We were out of the house most of the day so we cooked it in the crock pot on a high setting for about 6 hours(originally intended 4).  Very tender, tasty and the the onions really complimented the dish.  Served with collards and black eyed peas.  Next time we'll serve with mashed potatoes or maybe gnocchi like one reviewer suggested.

I made this with a 1/2 recipe and some modifications.  I used one 1.2# butt steak, a whole onion sliced, 1c of medium salsa, 1c water, salt/pepper sprinkle when browning.  Cooked over medium-low in a cast iron dutch oven for 2.5 hours.

It was fall apart tender and incredibly tasty.  The pan remnants (strained) made an outstanding sauce for rice and I easily pulled the steak apart with a fork.

Found this recipe by searching for new ways to prepare that most delectable cut of pork and we absolutely loved it. It was so tender and full of flavour. Thanks for sharing.

I enjoy this recipe. My teens all clean their plate, and even hubby thinks it tastes alot more glamourous than ketchup & meat. I use half the water with the rest of the ingredients. Turns out great every time. I even did it in an electric skillet once, and it still turned out great. I'm planning to try it in the crockpot next. Don't get fancy with seasonings until you've tried it once. It is surprisingly flavorful!

AMAZING!!!  I cooked this for dinner tonight, everyone loved it!  I did make some minor adjustments.  I had 4 steaks so had to adjust accordingly.  I only had 3 cups of ketchup, so I added a cup of bbq sauce.  I also added minced garlic when I added the onion.  Also, I added paprika when I seasoned the steaks.  I cooked the steaks on low heat for 3 hours, they came out so amazing.

Made this using pork shoulder steaks but when I got to the part where I was meant to add ketchup I realised I didn't have enough! What to do....? I decided to make my own, using a 400g box of passata  (sieved tomato), a bit of brown sugar and Worcestershire Sauce. The result was amazing, meltingly tender pork and a delicious sauce. I didn't have any garlic powder so I used fresh chopped garlic, I think 5 cloves was a bit much. Next time I will jut use 3 cloves. I served it with semolina pasta ( like noodles) fromvthe Asian supermarket, which went very well. My husband and 2 year old daughter (usually fussy) cleaned up and requested I make it again. Success!

This was wonderful! I found two pork butt steaks in my freezer and looked about for recipes and tried this one. I'm not a big fan of cooking with ketchup, so I added about 1/2 cup of Yoshida's marinade to the ketchup and water just to give it a bit of zip. I served this with mashed potatoes, and we enjoyed very much!

I'm only giving this 4 stars due to the change I made.  Only one change, but it was significant.  As suggested by another reviewer I substituted salsa for the ketchup.  We are eating healthier and the substitution made the calorie and fat counts fit into our diet much better.  It was fantastic!  Moist, spicy, and very tasty.  I served this dish with brown rice and a steamed vegetable medley which worked very nicely.

My entire family loved this recipe as written!  Like others, I was skeptical about the whole ketchup thing, but I'm glad I followed this one completely.......YUM!  I'm making it for a 2nd time now.  The smell is driving my family crazy.  I keep hearing...."is it ready yet?"  This will be in our regular rotation for sure.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good! I put the steaks in my crockpot for about 4 hours after I browned them. The only problem I had was the meat was falling apart as I took it out! I served with spinach and some mashed potatoes. Soooo good.

Got to rate this... this recipe is AWESOME!  I also was skeptical about the ketchup, so I put 1 cup ketchup and 1 cup meat flavored pizza sauce, it was delicious!

Surprisingly good.  I made this because I had the few simple ingredients on hand, and it was very easy to prepare.  We ended up with a lot of sauce, which had very good flavour.  My husband requested I make rice with this meal next time using the sauce.

Nothing fancy here yet this recipe is simple and delicious. I didn't have enough ketchup on hand so I ended up doing 1/3 ketchup and 2/3 Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. Left it in the crock pot on low for about seven hours while I was at work and this fell right off the bone. My picky eater husband said it was "pretty good" and when it comes to a recipe with so few ingredients and so little effort, I give it two thumbs up.

make sure you don't boil all the juice out and we add mushrooms to cook. we also do this with pork chops and fresh pork.  Very tasty and very very tender.  Great recipe. Don't let the ketchup scare you.

Tonight is the third time I've made this and it is fantastic! I tried it once with bbq sauce as other reviewers did, but it just didn't have the same flavor I loved from the ketchup. Although it was still super tender. This time I had the whole boston butt roast,  it was just over 3 lbs. I sliced 4 pieces about an inch to an inch and a half thick and cooked as directed. I had about half the roast left so that went into the freezer for next time since there is only two of us and my three year old who devoured her meat before anything else on her plate, which is very rare. I was also quite generous with the garlic powder. Thank you for sharing!

I have made this twice now, third time will be today.  First time I made it, it was too ketchupy for my taste.  The second time I did half ketchup, half bbq sauce and turned out perfect.  Spoon the sauce over a side dish of rice.  YUM

I made quite a few changes. I mixed an 18 oz. bottle of barbecue sauce with 1 1/2 C. water in the slow cooker and added 4 browned/seasoned steaks. Forgot to add the onions. Cooked on high for 2 1/2 hours. The family ate every last bite. Will definitely make again, may even try the ketchup..

After reading reviews I went ahead and prepared as stated (no additions to sauce/seasoning) with one exception, because of the quantity I was making after browning I baked on low heat in the oven for a few hours.  This dish was excellent - tasted much like spareribs to me but without all the fuss of ribs. I wasn't sure about turning while baking (thus losing the onions on top) so I left as is, but in the future would likely turn in the pan a couple times so the sauce stayed mixed and cooked down more evenly, then scoop onions back out on top for those that wanted them.  Very easy recipe!

I had only had one cup of katsup, so I supplemented one cup of BBQ sauce.  I used a crockpot and put it on low for 8 hours. The meat was so tender I had to use a spoon to get it out of the pot.  It was delicious!!!

I changed this a bit-I floured and fried the steaks & then followed the recepe.  The family liked it-other than the sauce being a bit ketchupy.. next time I might water it down.  Leftovers were the even beter than the first time around!

A wonderful meal.  I found that all the ingredients didn't seem to "meld" until about the last hour of cooking.  So don't be worried!  It's well worth it!  
So easy!  I'll make this again.

I thought this was very good--like a comfort food. I would serve it to family but not to guests as it doesn't look that attractive on a plate. The chops were soft and full of flavor. I fried them in an electric frying pan.  I personally think that making these in a crock pot would make the sauce to thin and watery. By frying them on the stove in a frying pan or using an electric skillet, the sauce thickens as they cook and is a nice compliment over the chops themselves or to put on mashed potatoes as a side. I will use this recipe again.

I've made this recipe a few times and altered it after reading reviews. I use on cup ketchup and one cup bbq sauce with 2 cups of water. I salt and pepper and sprinkle Garlic salt on the steaks. I use a crock pot to cook them and spread a little sauce on the bottom. I put the steaks in, put the sliced onions on and then pour the rest of the sauce over it. I alternate low and high cooking an hour each setting for about 4-5 hours until it just falls apart. My five year old LOVES it, but she's also a ketchup lover.

This was soo much better than i expected. I had to write a review. I used only one cup of ketchup and one cup of water chopped onions and minced garlic and mixed it with the sauce that the ketchup and water made. Then i put lots of pepper and some salt on both sides of the pork steaks (i only used two steaks) then i fried the steaks for four minutes on each side. I poured in the sauce made from ketchup and cooked for 2 hours. Severed it with mashed potatoes! my bf scarfed his down in like two seconds! thanks for this!

Great recipe.  Will be adding some more ingredients and play with the recipe more.  I added some worcheshire sauce and after finishing I decided it needed some spice so I dropped some hot sauce on my plate helped tremendously, next time I will be sure to drop some red chili flakes in the dish as well.   However it was a winner in the house.  I also blended the rest of the sauce so it was nice and creamy and I baked this instead of leaving it on the stove top.  350° for approximately 2hrs and turned out great.  Nice and tender falling off the bone.

I first made this when we were staying in a vacation condo and I didn't have access to my spice cabinet. I had brought the staple condiments along so I had ketchup and garlic powder on hand and, though I admit to being skeptical, this turned out SO, SO good!  The ketchup transformed into a sweet, oniony tomato sauce/glaze sometime during it's journey in the skillet and was fabulous on rice and also, I discovered later, mashed potatoes. So easy, so inexpensive, so delish! I'm loving all the slow cooker hints and will definitely give it a try. Thanks for sharing Melissa!

Made this last night. I was leary of the ketchup sauce but I made it as directed. My family and I absolutely loved it! I served it over rice. Next time, I will serve it over mashed potatoes. I will be cooking this again for sure. I used 6 pork shoulder steaks and cooked them for 3 1/2 hrs. Tender and fell right off the bone! Loved it! These steaks are also cheap, fit right into my shopping budget.

Made this in the slow cooker (8 hours) and it didn't come out as tender as I had hoped (I was looking for the texture of pulled pork. But this is a great way to cook butt steaks that are on sale. I didn't love the flavor but that's just a personal thing.

Very good, I used 1/2 the amounts for ketchup and water and there was still too much sauce! But I cooked this in a tightly sealed dutch oven, so there was no moisture loss. I think this recipe would adapt well to a crockpot.

I had never cooked a boston butt before and this turned out great! I had never heard them referred to as "steaks" before.. but this is what I did: Cut the huge chunk of meat (about 2.25 lbs) into about 5-6 chunks, seasoned them, and seared them in a pan. I added them to a crockpot set on low as they finished. I sliced the onion and sauted it in the pan and once they were slightly turning translucent, I added the ketchup mix. Let it come to a simmer, added it to the crockpot. I let it cook on low for 1 hour, cut it up to high for 2, then back to low for 2. WOW!! Sooo good to me!! And it was so tender, we could hardly pick each piece up with tongs, it would start to fall apart. I think cutting it up helped it get so tender without having to leave it in for 8-10 hours. :)

This was melt in your mouth delicious and oh so easy.  I cooked the pork in the crockpot on low for 8 hours and it just fell off the bone.  The only substitution I made was minced garlic in lieu of garlic powder.

Easy, on hand ingredients, so cheap and so tasty! I used 1 cup of bbq sauce and other of ketchup...great to eat like barbacue sandwiches with potato salad or mashed potatoes. If you use a thin steakes, you can get your meal in 2.5 hours or less...Try it, you CANT regret!

I'm always trying to find a good recipe for pork steak since I always buy it on sale.  This made the most tender tasty meat ever!  My husband said the sauce was delicious and was shocked when I told him it was ketchup.  I have even used this recipe to make shredded pork for sandwiches and mixed it with a little BBQ sauce before serving.

Seared 2 - 1  1/2 lb.  pork butt steaks,did sprinkle a little BELL' S SEASONING  on them with salt and pepper to taste my choice for seasonings on pork. Cut the  ketchup and water down to 2/3rds, and used a TBSP. dried chopped onion. This is how I remade it to my tastes. Original recipe was great, but I like to recreate.Like with any recipe, make it yours, after trying the original. Because someone worked to make it, so try it there way first, before you play with it.

So easy, put in crock pot like many suggested.   Didn't have that much regular ketchup so used 1/2 cup of siracha ketchup too.  Added a couple tablespoons of Worcester sauce.  The rest I did as recipe suggested. Serve it w noodles.  Hubby loved it too.

The only thing I changed was the ketchup. I cut it in half because 2 cups seemed WAYY too much. I'm glad I did because the steaks turned out great! Will make again.

I made these today with 3 of the "large pork chops" our stores  featued on sale. I don't really like Ketchup, so I used a 10 ounce can of store brand  low salt  Tomato soup and equal parts water, otherwise as stated.  I cooked in the Crockpot low for 6 hours,  amazing flavor. Simple and  easy - I will be making this often.

We love it! And it is so easy, a real no brainer, and not very expensive and that's always a plus! I made it with pork gravy once in place of the ketchup and it was good. Everyone said they like it both ways equally.

I was about to cook this when I realized that I am out of ketchup. I found a homemade ketchup recipe on line. Instead of making it separately then adding it to the meat, I will let it simmer with the meat. I'll be back to let you know how it turns out and update my rating.

Addition to Review: 24 hours later. This recipe came out pretty good. I didn't double the recipe because I thought my husband would not really like it. I was hoping for leftovers. There were one. We ate it with a side of buttered egg noodles. Will definitely make again.

My husband and children absolutely LOVED this recipe! I added my own little twist on it though, I did the 3:3 ratio with the water and ketchup, but while all the steaks where in the pot I added a can of tomatoe sauce and adoboe to the liquid and brought it to a boil, stirred it and let it simmer for 4 and a half hours!!! It was so delicious and juicy and yes the meat was definitely falling off the bones!!! Yummy! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe I'll definitely be doing it again sometime soon! It went very well with double baked Mac and cheese and corn on the cob!!! As well as our favorite Garlic toast! ?

I liked this recipe and my husband LOVED it, so it gets 5 stars. I used shoulder steaks and baked it in the oven instead and it came out great. I served it with mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. I thought we might have some leftover for tomorrow but he didn't leave anything behind. I was shocked. I'll be making this again since he loves it so much.

I made this recipe for my family today with rave reviews.  Even my picky 4 year old loved it!  I made 3 steaks and trimmed the fat off the sides of 2 of the steaks and left the fat on one (for the flavor).  I actually think that I'll trim the fat on all steaks next time.  It was so tender, the meat just fell off the bone!

Amazing - you'd never expect it to taste so good - my kids LOVE it (and they think the name of the recipe is funny too!)

I was hesitant to try this as well because of the ketchup and water but thought with so many good ratings it must be great. It was just ok for us. I did add some rosemary and thyme because we like them and it did have a nice flavor overall. I just wasn't crazy about all the sauce. It was very watery and overpowered with tomato flavor. My meat was thin and was falling apart at just 75 minutes even though I simmered it so I turned it off and we ate early. The meat was tender and the seasonings were good but overall it would have been better without all the watery tomato (and we like tomato, just not on our pork) If I had let the sauce cook down much longer so it was thicker and had more time to absorb the other flavors I think it would have been just fine. It was just too watery with 70-90 minutes cooking time. If your steaks are thin cut the water by half maybe or really cook it slow. I'm giving it 4 stars even though I probably wouldn't make it again. Nothing wrong with it but it didn't knock my socks off. My husband who hates sauces on meat said it was ok and ate it all. The kids liked the flavor of the sauce but not the meat (go figure) 
Overall, a decent easy to make meal but just not our cup of tea.

I served this for dinner tonight and my college age son said, "Wow!"  I used some Tastefully Simple Dried Tomato & Garlic Pesto instead of the garlic powder and salt and pepper.  Yum!

This was soooo good.  I followed the directions and cooked them for about 3 and a half hours.  The meat was falling off the bone and practically melted in your mouth. I made it for my husbands birthday.  I had most of the family over and everyone raved about it.  My Dad's girlfriend couldn't believe it was boston butt steaks.  They asked for the recipe and requested to take some home.  Thanks!!

This was absolutely wonderful! I didnt have 2 cups ketchup so I used about 1 cup along with Hoisin Sauce and a Chili Garlic Sauce that I originally found in a Vietnamese restaurant with about 1 - 1 1/2 c water. Cooked it for about 3 hours and it was wonderful. My husband said it was just so-so but I think he is crazy lol

Most delicious! It became a family favorite, the moment we tasted this juicy, tender meat and tasty sauce. We had left overs,they were even better than the day before. Thanks for sharing.
