I was hesitant to make this recipe cause it wasnt reveiwed by anyone yet and i never cooked lamb before but i was so glad i tried it. It was soooo good. I had to make the marinade twice cause the first time i made it, it was way to hot and i actually like to eat hot things. So the second time i made it i reduced the cayanne pepper to 1/8tsp and it was perfect. I also tried the lamb 12hrs in the marinade and then 24 and definately the 24hrs was best.

Made the full recipe for the sauce with the addition of 1/4tsp. allspice. However only used 1lb of Dall Sheep (game meat) cut into bite sized pieces. It was lovely.
The yogurt, like buttermilk, tenderized the meat, seasoning imparted great flavor. It was not overpowering like some spice blends. Made it into gyro-like sandwiches, but would be great in couscous, chopped salads, or as Kebabs!

Other reviewers have noted to cut back on cayenne if you aren't  into "hot." I'd agree. Only used 1/2 tsp of cayenne and it was just the perfect amount of spicy without inducing tears and sweat.
Thanks for the recipe!

The flavor is to die for!  However, I do have some suggestions.  I would double the recipe for this much meat.  It was barely enough to coat 2 1/2# of meat, and I still had to add some water after a few hours because the top layer of meat was drying out.  Also, I would cut the salt in half or delete it altogether.  I used 1 tsp. for 2 1/2# of meat and it was still too salty.  I doubled the garlic as I didn't think I'd be able to taste it at the suggested amount, and it was perfect.  I also used Thai hot peppers instead of cayenne, substituting 4 peppers per teaspoon -- I chopped them up with the garlic and onion.  It was pretty warm, but I like that! With the recipe doubled for the amount of meat, the spices were just right, very fragrant and the meat was so tender from the yogurt.  I marinaded for 12 hours and it was terrific.  The last comment I have is that I might try grilling the meat next time because in the skillet, when the marinade boils, the yogurt curdles.  Overall, I think this recipe is flexible and forgiving, and the flavor combination is exotic and thoroughly enjoyable!

I made this yesterday and it was divine! I was attracted to this recipe because of the many spices/herbs. And the smell of the marinating meat was a great indicator of how it was going to taste. 

I only had half a pound of lamb, but I did not scale down the sauce to a tenth -- I like sauces with my food. Also: I did not use a tablespoon of salt -- I used just a teaspoon and it was fine. If I had 5 lbs of meat, I probably would use more. Finally, I only had whole spices. I guessed on the conversions and tossed them all in the grinder.

And because my lamb was *very* thinly sliced (paper thin), I only left this in the marinade for about 3 hours. My cayenne was probably old -- I used a full teaspoon and the dish was not hot. .  I'm sure if I let it sit overnight, the flavors would be intense, but I was hungry and did not have the foresight to refrigerate this the night before. 

I did not have this as a shawarma, but as a dish of meat and sauce over bulgur. If I do decide to have shawarma, I might just scrape off the extra marinade before I grill this.

This dish was superb!

Loved it! I fed it to my roommates and friends, and everyone ate seconds and thirds. I didn't have lamb, so I used steaks instead, and it turned out great. Thanks for the recipe!!

Smelled exactly like I remember shawarma smelling when I lived in the Middle East! And I was very happy to find that there are no obscure ingredients in this recipe. It was fun making this at home, but it's hard to slice the meat thinly, and lamb is SO expensive... I think we'll stick to the professionals when we want shawarma.

This is my first time preparing lamb and I decided to use this recipe to prepare it. The lamb came out great and the flavor was superb!!! I love how you marinaded the lamb in sauce overnight to enrichen the flavor. I marinade mine 18 hours prior to cooking(prepared saturday night). I had 4 pieces of lamb shoulders and decided to grilled 2 pieces of lamb on stovetop (do not have a outside grill) and I decided to bake the other 2 in the oven at 350 degrees for 45 minutes, and both methods came out great!! This is going to be one of my frequent dishes to prepare for dinner.

I halved the recipe and made it with chicken.  I marinated the strips for 8 hours and they were phenomenal on pita bread w/the thick-style lebanese garlic sauce recipe from this site, some sliced dill pickles and tomatoes.

I made it exactly as per the recipe, except that I cooked the sliced meat on skewers over the grill instead of in a pan. I served it with rice, yogurt/cucumber sauce, sliced tomatoes and onions, and grilled pita with hummus. Nom, nom, nom! It was, in a word, delicious. The leftovers didn't last long because I kept sneaking pieces of meat. Even cold it was delicious. Next time I'll have to make a double batch.

I added the tablespoon of salt without thinking and immediately regretted it. But I have to say, the end result was not overly salty. The recipe is good but next time I would cut the lamb into chunks and grill them on skewers. I made the pieces to flat and they were immediately overcooked. Plus, it grilling would have preventing them from almost steaming in the grease that came out of them as they sat cooking in the pan. I would also cut back the salt to 1 teaspoon. Not sure why the salt content is so high unless it's for tenderizing, which didn't work for me since I overcooked the pork. I'd try it again tho

OMG...this was fabulous!!! Like others, 1/8 tsp cayenne and only 1/2 tbsp salt.  I let marinate for a little more than 24 hours.  Flavor was so good!!  Served it on pita bread and hummus.  Can't wait to make it again in spring when I can grill it!

Great recipe.  I only had time to let the meat marinate for about 5 hours, and it was still really good. Lots of flavor. Next time I will have to give it the full 24 hours.

My store was out of lamb (except huge leg of lamb) so I bought beef stew meat instead. I then put the meat on flatbread and added home made hummus. It was fabulous!

I followed the recipe exactly except for adding a bit more olive oil to the marinade. I thought that it was very good as is but I think that putting the lamb on skewers and cooking it on the grill might just kick it up enough for the 5th star. I had it with naan & pita both (since I had both on hand) plus roasted garlic tzatziki (actually the Greek Tzatziki recipe on this site with a whole bulb of roasted garlic substituted for the 1 clove pressed the recipe calls for) and some feta cheese and sliced onions & tomatoes. It was worth the $5 it cost for me to buy a jar of mace. Definitely something I will be making again.

Scrumptious ... however, one word of caution: a full Tbsp of salt seemed excessive & I scaled it back to 2 tsp. Next time I'll drop it to 1-1/2 tsp. I'm infamous for a heavy touch with salt and 2 tsp was on the borderline even for me. I took another poster's suggestion of doubling the amount of marinade and was glad I did. Also, the lamb contracted into a thicker form as it cooked (similar to hamburger patties), so I sliced it again after cooking. Next time I will also make as a wrap or bake my own pita bread; store bought pita is too flimsy for this purpose. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing, jwagner!

I grew up in Dubai. This recipes was spot on. Marinated some lamb shoulder cubes overnight, made skewers and grilled on a charcoal BBQ. Next time I'm going the whole hog with the Arabic bread, hummus and tabbouleh.

Good start but felt it was too much meat for all the spices. I love spices, the more the better, but this didn't knock my socks off. Plus, we had leftovers for about a week.

Was very yummy. All 5 kids enjoyed this on pita bread. Made half lamb and steak.  Kept both meats separated in marination and cooking. The steak obtained more spiciness than the lamb. (I used double the marination with half salt and 1.7 lbs of lamb and 1.7 lbs steak. )   Served with rice and chips.

We thought this was so yummy!  I have made the lamb shawarma several times now and it gets better and better.  I use all spice instead of mace and just a TINY bit of clove.  When I made this using the posted ingredients it ended up too 'clovey'.  Also, I have issue with the yogurt curdling when cooking.  To solve this, I cut thicker slices, skewered the lamb, and grilled.  No curdle and yummy char.  Love the lamb over a Israeli Couscous and homemade hummus.  DELISH!!!

I didn't add the lemon juice coz I'm afraid it'll be too sour just like the other recipe, and I didn't have mace, so I added allspice instead. It was flavorful! Maybe I'll add half the required lemon juice next time. Thanks for the recipe :)

A good recipe, needed a bit more garlic, but other than that, it was great. I'll definately marinate it another couple hours longer like the recipe suggests. Great with an arugula salad and rice.

Great flavor, though I changed the method a bit.  I Threw the onion and garlic in a blender cup till smooth before adding it to the marinate and skipped the water. Then, rather than manage the little strips in a skillet, I greased some cookie sheets (make sure they are the kind with a lip all around) and put them under the broiler one sheet at a time. I served in wraps with fried onions and bell peppers and topped with greek yogurt.

Had left over Lamb shawarma from a restaurant. Made the sauce and put it over the meat for a few hours. Warmed it and it was fantastic. Plan on using the "sauce" for other left over meats. We needed a sauce to cut calories and fat and this was it!

We did eat this but not a meal I plan to make again. Just tasted different and wasn't for us I guess.

Wonderful marinade! I used 3 lbs of beef and 3 lbs of leg of lamb in separate ziplocks, doubled marinade recipe and let sit 24 hours. Cooked on my George Forman grill. Everyone raved about this.

I absolutely loved this. Basically cooked it exactly as written. I marinated for about 20 hours. Next time I make it I won't use as much cayenne, but that's just preference.

My husband said that this was brilliant. I cooked my meat in the crockpot and shredded it. Then I made the tzatziki sauce from allrecipes.com

Made this half a dozen times now. I use a boneless leg of lamb, around a couple of pounds worth, for four people. Only had enough leftover to take for lunch once. Served with pitas and Israeli salad from this site. Great informal dinner. Do the prep and marinate beginning the night before, and it takes very little time to get this on the table when I get home from work.

this was ok, but a bit spicy for me and the kids. I did however make it using leftover roasted Leg of Lamb from a holiday dinner and added few other toppings and used naan and flat bread instead of pita with Tajiki sauce; and was almost as good as what we get in the Big D and Dearborn MI. SO close my father said it was so scary how close it was. Might post how I did at a latter date for everyone else.

Wow! So good! Thanks for sharing this dish! My boyfriend can't stop eating it! Great blend of spices and truly better the longer u marinate it. I added yogurt cilantro sauce and this was a hit combo.

Yum! Love this combo of spices. Used with ground lamb and made my own gluten-free wraps. Me and my husband loved it. Even better served with tzatziki sauce.

Really great! Just like other reviewers, my husband has been in the Middle East and said this was just as good as what he has had before! Thanks for sharing this recipe! Served on warmed naan bread with yogurt dill sauce (found in local market), julienned cucumber, tomatoes, and finely sliced onions.

This was a little on the spicy side for our tastes, next time I will cut back on the cayenne.  Yogurt curdled on cooking, but flavour was still very good.  Served on rice, which was helpful in absorbing the extra spicy heat.

This was marvelous. Instead of stove top, I grilled it using a grilling basket. And instead of pita, I laid it on top of the Authentic Lebanese Fatoush, which you can find here on AllRecipes.

I only had time to marinate it for 9 hours and it still came out wonderful. I served it with homemade pita and hummus.

The flavor of this meat was amazing.  The only thing we will do differently next time is cut the meat slightly thicker and place on skewers to cook on the grill.  I think it would give it the perfect taste and texture.

Absolutely wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I marinated for 48 hours (because I had no time to cook it).  This was a great dish!
