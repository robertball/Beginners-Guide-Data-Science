Tomatoes and fresh basil are a classic combination! It doesn't get much better or much simpler that this - it's absolutely delicious! I decreased the onion and I probably could have left it out altogether. I plated this vs. tossing in all in a bowl. Plus, I NEVER chill it, but rather leave it at room temperature. It's so fresh and so good it could be a meal in and of itself! It's perfect with a a side a crusty Italian bread and a good wine. A definite crowd pleaser!

N.J. is known for growing the tastiest tomatoes in the country and we all know never to refrigerate these red beauties, as they will lose their flavor. After combining the ingredients, including garlic, I just let the mixture sit on my counter to absorb all the wonderful flavors. Ten minutes before serving I added the cheese. Thanks so much Kathy for a great side!!!!

Use fresh ingredients...especially the mozzerella, and seed the tomatoes so it's not a wet mess.

This was a great salad. I messed up and got shredded mozzarella without thinking, but it still turned out great! Rave reviews all around!

Very good salad.  I only rated a 4 because I changed it up a bit by adding a clove of minced fresh garlic and making the dressing using 3 parts extra virgin olive oil to 1 part of the balsamic vinegar.  1/2 balsamic and 1/2 oil makes it very tart and overpowering.  Make sure the balsamic is the best you can buy, the older the better, the more syrupy it is, the better.  Trader Joe's sells a very nice aged balsamic for less than $10 a bottle.

I wanted add a new italian salad for italian night dinner. My husband and 17 year old daughter loved it.  It was so flavorful and zesty.  They ended mixing leftovers with lettuce berg.  Thanks, it was a hit!

Yummy! I made it following the recipe to the letter the first time and it was great. Then I took the advise of other reviewers and didn't refrigerate the tomatoes and it really enhanced the flavors.

I thought it was great - just be sure to use really good quality mozzerella, oil and vinegar (it won't taste as good if you skimp).

Also good if it soaks overnight.

Even though I forgot to add the red onion, this salad is always excellent!  Tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, fresh basil and balsamic vinegar are such a winning combination.  The key to this is to always use the best, and freshest ingredients you can find!

This was ssssoooooooo yummy! So easy, so fresh, and gorgeous! I will be making this over and over again. What a treat! I did not use all of the oil and balsalmic vinegar it called for. 1/3 cup oil seemed like a lot. I used 3 TBS, but I think you could use even less. Great salad!

Had this every week this summer once we started getting ripe tomatoes, basil and onions from the garden.  Sorry that the home grown tomatoes are gone, but will have to buy the cherry tomatoes from the store this winter so we can continue to have this wonderful side dish.  Will still have our own dried basil and home grown onions for a few months.  This is so easy and so good.

So simple, and yet fantastic.  I reduced the balsamic, and like other reviewers, I served it at room temperature.  My husband and I enjoyed it with NY strip steaks.  I will absolutely prepare this again.

Wonderful! The traditional sliced, layer salad never quite hits the spot because I like more dressing. This hits the spot exactly. I did seed the tomatoes as suggested and would probably suggest it.

Admittedly, I picked this recipe based on a photo.  I liked the cut up cherry/grape tomatoes for a "dish-able" side dish.  This was delicious.  I cubed fresh mozz., halved red & yellow cherry tomatoes, chopped the basil (chiffonade, and thinly slice the onion.  I mixed those and then waited until just before travel time (taking dish to a gathering) to add the liquids.  I'll definitely make this again.  Thanks, katquilter!

Great summer salad. I don't even like tomatos, but the vinegar makes them tasty!

We make this salad often but without the onion. Usually we don't even use the olive oil, we just serve it with some really good thick balsamic vinegar. With the tomatoes and basil fresh from our garden, everyone loves it!

These were awesome. Fresh GARDEN tomatoes are a must - the store variety don't cut it. I sliced my tomatoes in thick slices then seasoned them with salt and pepper, topped with a slice of fresh mozzarella and onion then drizzled olive oil and balsamic vinegar glaze (a little thicker than regular balsamic). Topped with fresh basil thinly sliced into ribbons. Everyone loved them and it was a quick and easy summer appetizer.

This is a wonderful, fresh salad & a perfect accompaniment to grilled meats.  I happenened to have a fennel bulb on hand that I wanted to use, so I added it to the salad & it complemented the flavors well.

After an hour in the fridge the mozzarella didn't look very appetizing, but my guests did enjoy this with french bread - sort of a hybrid caprese-bruschetta - which helped soak up the excess dressing.

I assembled this in the traditional, sliced way and used a local restaurant's sherry vinaigrette.  It was light and a great addition to an Italian meal.

YUM! I scaled the recipe down to make enough for 2, so I didn't used all the olive oil and vinegar called for, just to taste. Also, I didn't have red onion, so I used vidalia. Very fresh and delicious! This will be made very often in my house! Thanks for sharing. :)

A light, tasty side. :) Here in Iowa we have locally grown tomatoes labeled "Graddy's" that really lend themselves well to this dish. Personally, I thought the medley tasted better after chilling in the refrigerator. The fresh mozzarella has a very mild taste and almost spongy texture. :) Oh, and yes, seeding the tomatoes helps.

This recipe is simple and classic.  The key however, is to have very fresh ingredients.  If you don't have very fresh tomatoes, don't bother.

I make this 2-3 times a week when tomatoes are at their peak. Last night I grated a garlic clove and minced a little red onion.  I use my very best olive oil and 10 year old Balsamic, but I never measure.  Let it set on the counter while prepping the rest of dinner.  I use the little mozzarella boccatini balls available at most groceries and Sam's Club. Seriously good stuff.

Super easy and super delicious.  I agree w/previous reviewers' posts about using more EVOO and less balsamic vinegar.  I used twice as much oil than vinegar.  I added about a tbsp. of garlic pepper and a tsp. of sea salt.  After sitting overnight, the next day's leftover batch tasted even better!  If you have the chance, let it sit overnight.

I made this without the red onions & it came out great.  It's really pretty if you lay it all out on a plate or platter & drizzle the vinegar over it. It reminds me of a salad that the restaurant Johnny Carino's served this summer.

I made this salad for a salad luncheon.  I used garden fresh tomatoes.  I did not use onion, but did use fresh ground sea salt and pepper along with the fresh basil, olive oil, balsamic vinegar and fresh mozerella.  I had many good compliments and recipe requests.

Made with only fresh mozzarella, sweet onions, caprese tomatoes, fresh basil and olive oil.  Sprinkled kosher salt on the sliced mozzarella, onions and tomatoes and let them drain several hours (in separate colanders) before combining.  Really good.

I used red wine vinegar because I was out of balsamic. It was amazing. Will make again for sure.

This is a good recipe if you like fresh mozzarella. The texture doesn't do much for me.

very very good. It is sitting on the counter letting the flavors blend now. Will serve with salmon fillets (left over from last night) and some toasted garlic bread. I have high hopes.

I suppose this is just personal taste, but personally I found this to be too oily, not vinegary enough, and very bland. More onions or garlic could have helped I think. I put in more vinegar than called for and still was disappointed. It was still edible, so I'll give two stars.

I thought the flavors to the salad were great, but, I still think I prefer the layered caprese better than having it mixed together.  The cheese soaked in the balsamic giving it an unappealing dark brown color.  I also think the balsamic flavor overwhelmed the fresh basil.  I totally forgot the red onion, but, I am sure it would be great in the salad.   Thanks for the recipe, but, I will stick with the simplicity of a traditional Caprese salad next time.

I didn't have basil and tried using fresh lettuce. Apparently basil makes all the difference in this. I've had this before with basil and it was great.

This recipe was a great addition to my homegrown tomatoes and basil. I did use a balsamic reduction and there's nothing like putting those fresh ingredients to work on a tasty treat for me and my girls. I totally forgot to add the onions, but oh well, I will next time. Loved it Loved it!! Will make again.

Such a basic salad with a really nice taste. I left out the onions because I made it for a bbq and wasn't sure if everyone would love them like me. The mozzarella was expensive, but it is so worth it to buy fresh.

Fresh mozzarella really does taste great, but if you're not planning on eating all of this in one sitting, you might want to consider using regular mozz. Fresh tends to break down a bit if it sits in the oil and vinegar for a long while.

Loved this!  Served it to company and they loved it.  Leftovers were great next day.  Next time I will use the mozzarella balls I've seen in store.  They're an inch size and that would look good but the other fine too.  Will make again!

Like a good wine, it tastes better with time.  The first night the vinegar taste was a little too much; the next, the liquid had a mellowed sweetness.  Sure the tomatoes are mushier, but it still tastes awesome.  Definitely serve with bread to sop up sauce.

Delicious! Just like an Italian Pizzeria we have locally. Just the restaurant here I added some olives to the side. Topped with sea salt & fresh ground pepper. Very tasty!

I had some extra fresh basil from another recipe this week and was trying to think of what I could make.  I didn't want to slice tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil and lay them out in something time consuming and fancy for just us and so I found this recipe.  I had some mozzarella in the fridge, but next time I will definitely use fresh mozzarella.  i also used grape tomatoes as they were on sale and the dish was delicious.  Never had it with balsamic before and it was great.

Fabulous. Full of flavor. You could serve this with just about any meal. Make sure and splurge for the fresh mozzarella.

Excellent! So simple and easy to prepare and very eye appealing. Everyone loved this, even my father, who is a real meat and potatoes type of guy. I knew he liked it when he went for seconds! I thought there was a bit too much olive/vinegar mixture, I may reduce that next time but everyone loved dipping their garlic bread it in so it was OK.

Yum!! Any variation of Insalata Caprese is delicious. I did use a blend of oregano and basil though. Excellent!

This was really good. So fresh tasting and simple. I served it as a first course with chicken fettuccini alfredo. It was definitely a hit. I'll make it again for sure.

Looked nice and tasted good. I took this to a picnic and most of it was eaten, but no one asked for recipe. Thanks for recipe.
