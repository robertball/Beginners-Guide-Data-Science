This dish is a HUGE hit whenever it is served!!  I have begun using canned diced tomatoes and the result has been excellent! Whether you use fresh or canned tomatoes, be sure to eliminate as much juice as you can.  This will ensure that your pie will slice nicely and not be too runny!  
This dish tastes so much like deep-dish pizza!!  MMMMMMM!

Great taste and way to use up our garden overflow! Tasted like a pizza or BLT, can't decide! It was runny, despite my chopping tomatoes at room temp, draining them in a colander and then on paper towels; but - they are tomatoes after all! Tomatoes are watery! I actually prefer more of a tomato quiche (basically tomato pie with eggs) but this was a nice alternative. I let this set up but it still kind of fell apart when sliced. I diced my tomatoes and onions (yea, I think adding onions is a MUST!), maybe next time I will do slices but I thought diced made it easier to cut and serve. Next time I will use only 4 tomatoes or 5 smaller ones; 5 tomatoes were just too much! This is best served hot, right after the cooling period. I added more basil and it was well received. Thank you for sharing.

I love this recipe.  Am using the last of this year's tomato crop today.  The only change I make is to add about 1/4 cup of the cheese to the bottom of the crust before I start layering the tomatoes...helps keep the bottom crust from getting soggy.  Oh, and I also add a little oregano to the spice mixture.

This was a fabulous yummy pie and i don't even like tomatoes all that much! It disappeared in one sitting and my family absolutely loved it. Use the freshest tomatoes  you can find for best results. I substituted fresh chopped basil which i think made a difference (and i added lots of it!)

I doubled this recipe and made two pies.  I read all the reviews and made adjustments accordingly.  I used 3/4 cup of sour cream and 3/4 of cup of mayo for my two pies.  I was afraid of the overwhelming taste of mayo that some people experienced and I'm glad I replaced some of it with sour cream.  Everyone that ate this really enjoyed it but I was not exceptionally thrilled with it.  The mayo with the mozzarella cheese was odd to me.  I really tasted the mayo even though I replaced some of it with sour cream.  I used fresh basil leaves which I left whole.  I added some minced fresh garlic.  I didn't peel the tomatoes.  I sliced them thin and layed them on a cooling rack and sprinkled both sides with salt so that they could drain.  I then patted them with a lot of paper towels.  I used probably half a roll of paper towels.  I had no problems at all with the pie being runny.  Before layering the tomatoes in the pie crust I brushed the bottoms of the pie crust with egg whites and cooked the pie crusts for about 10 minutes.  I then sprinkled some mozzarella cheese at the bottom before I started layering the tomatoes, basil, garlic and so on.  Topped with the mayo/sour cream/ mozzarella and baked for about 30 minutes in a 350 degree oven.  Waited about 30 minutes before I sliced into it.  This pie was not runny or soggy in the least.  I will probably make again but might leave out the mayo completely. Thanks for sharing !

I did not care for the topping, it tasted too much like mayonaisse, the tomato part was good, but did not like the topping, neither did my husband. I don't think I will make it again.

Tried it last night and it was great!  The first thing my husband asked was if there was "meat" in it but after he tasted it and I gave him my "its summer and you are supposed to eat light", he was okay with it.  Even my son enjoyed it and he is "picky".  I did use "italian seasoning" instead of just the basil.  Will definately keep this for future use!

My husband and I really loved this recipe.  I modified it a bit--used only about 3/4 C of strong cheddar and used yogurt instead of mayonnaise--but it was still rich and very flavorful.

Oh! This was really good! I used fresh basil and a mix of mozzarella and cheddar cheeses. I let the salted tomatoes drain, using paper towels and also dipped them into flour (lightly). After pre-baking the crust, I sprinkled a bit of Parmesan cheese onto it, then started layering. I also added a small, thinly sliced red onion. 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream worked great for me. My crust was nice and crispy.

I made this for dinner last night and we loved it.  The only problem I had was a soggy bottom crust.  I did as others suggested and put a layer of cheese on the bottom before I added the tomatoes but it was still pretty soggy but the tomatoes were fresh from the garden and very juicy.  I made a few modifications as well.  I used fresh basil which I highly recommend.  It's so much more flavorful than dried.  I eliminated the salt and used garlic salt instead.  I also used an Italian cheese blend instead of the cheddar.  I added some fresh Italian herbs to the cheese/mayo mixture, too.  I'll definitely make this again even if the crust gets soggy.  The flavor is just amazing with all the fresh ingredients.  I could have made a meal on just the tomato pie.  Thank you NWW for sharing this recipe.

This was great! I brushed egg whites on the pie's bottom before the 10 minute heating part, and I tried both cheddar and mozz cheese, we prefer the mozz. My hub took a whole pie to work and didnt even get to have a piece for himself, everyone else ate it first. I squeezed most of the juice from the tomatoes first, then added a dash of olive oil to them. I also recommend covering the edges of the pie crust with a little tin foil so it doesnt burn. Thanks! I'm adding this to a favorites file.

My husband loved this recipe and he usually he doesn't like casserole type dishes. I lightly brushed mayo on each layer of tomatoes(only used 1/4 cup mayo) and add a little cheese between layers. Great recipe and will defiantly make it again!

This recipe originally called for 5 large tomatoes, but I used 3, and it was perfect.  I baked the pie crust for 12 minutes to get the bottom cooked a little more.  Everything else is the same.   I shredded sharp cheddar cheese (don’t use pre-shredded stuff).  I’ve been told that makes a big difference in the taste for some dishes (I’m still testing that theory!).  Let it cool for about 10-15 minutes after taking it out of the oven.  It is delicious!  I have to make myself stop at two slices!

This is sooo delicious! I used fresh tomatoes from the garden, which I'm sure helped the flavor. I also used fresh basil, chopped and sprinkled in the pie, instead of the dried basil. The cheese and mayo topping may seem strange, but they give the pie a delicious creamy/tangy sauce. Well worth making.

I used 1/2 light sour cream and 1/2 light mayo...was still too rich for my taste.  Might try again adding some other veggies and using less mayo and sour cream.

The pie cut clean! I drained the tomato all night (I used 2 canned diced tomatoes) and I brushed the pastry with an egg wash and baked it to golden brown before adding tomatoes.  I already have a friend asking for the recipe!

Very nice dish!  If you use Roma tomatoes and take out the seeds, you should not have a soupy mixture like some reviewers had happen. I served this with the  Salmon Pie I recipe from this site. Both were very good and a big hit with those partaking of the meal!

The crust was soggy but the filling was tasty.  If I were to make it again, I wouldn't use so much mayonnaise.

Very tasty (I used fresh basil), but it was REALLY soupy. I might have had too many tomatoes--they were pretty big--or maybe I should have let them drain a bit. Would try again, though.

Made with fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder and Italian seasoning rather than just basil. Also, we used one roll of refrigerated pilsbury crescent rolls as the crust because we didn't have a pie crust on hand. Sliced and salted the tomatoes and then set them on a paper towel to draw out the water for about 10 minutes before making the pie. Delicious!!!  Would make it exactly like this again.

Made this lastnight with tomatoes from the garden. I sliced them then took the skin off. I followed the recipe to a T. It was GREAT! Husband does NOT like mayonnaise, never told him there was any in it until he had finished his 4th piece! I am ready to make it again. It was fast and so easy. Thinking about adding some mushrooms, green pepper or onion to it, as it tastes so much like pizza

This is a wonderful way to use up the overabundance of tomatoes I have in my garden.  Of course I did make a few changes (a couple based on other reviews/suggestions).  I found the first time I made this that there was so much juice from the tomatoes that I literally had to drain it after we cut a few slices.  So the second time I made it I sliced the tomatoes and drained them on paper towels while I cooked the crust.  I also added real bacon bits to the cheese/mayo mixture, it made it taste almost like a BLT, very tasty and my husband loved it.  I've already shared it with others and they loved it also.

Made this today using a wheat flour crust. Used a combo of sharp cheddar and fontina cheese and put a thin layer of cheese on the crust before layering the tomatoes. I also added some chopped scallions. Used half mayo and half sour cream. The sour cream added a nice tanginess. My husband loved it and even my 3 year ate it. Will definitely make again.

Awesome and incredibly easy! I used canned, whole tomatoes (2 28oz. cans) and drained them very well. I topped the tomatoes with a layer of fresh spinach  before I put on the cheese mixture. I can't wait to try it with fresh tomatoes. It would be very impressive at a brunch!

This recipe was DELICIOUS!!!!  Left out garlic powder and basil (personal preference), added thinly sliced onions.  Happened to have some crisp bacon and threw a little of that in. The taste is incredible!  I have to confess it was "juicy", perhaps I didn't let the tomatoes drain enough, but they were fresh from the garden and you know how juicy those are. I just tilted to drain so tomorrow's leftover pie will be a little drier.

Fresh basil takes this to a whole different level.  Slice the tomatoes thick so they stay somewhat firm.  I always add a touch of thinly sliced Vidalia onion or scallion.  Tomato Pie for brunch is always a great summer treat with the good homegrown tomatoes!  It should not taste like pizza!

Good!  I did make a few changes.  First I used Roma tomatoes as stated in other reviews.  After I sliced them, I drained them on a paper towel.  I also browned sweet italian sausage, pre baked the crust for a few minutes, omitted the mayo, and used sliced onions and mozzerella cheese.  I put cheese on the bottome of crust, then used the sausage.  Then layered the onions, tomatoes, and cheese.  Using the seasonings inbetween the layers.  I am not a tomato lover, but this was really good and will make its way to the menu at least once or twice a month.

This recipe is very close to the one our family used to make, glad I found it! To me, it is cleaner and fresher than the ones burdened down by a ton of cheese and meat. Great taste - a seasonal favorite!

used a mix of mozzarella-emmenthal-sour cream instead of the mayo-cheddar mix... 
I suggest not to bake the crust, but put in the oven everything with the filling and also to put a layer of emmenthal on the bottom, before putting the tomatoes, it shall come out better.. 
anyway, loved it!

Made it as-is and it was DELISH!  Didn't have any sogginess issues (thankfully).  Next time I think I will add a little bacon and some cooked onions for some added flavor, and will probably sub half of the mayo for sour cream to reduce some of the richness.  It really is a great recipe!

I only needed about three 4 large tomatoes, and I didn't peel them, just sliced them.  This had a great taste, but it was really runny.  If there was any way to absorb/take away the moisture, it would be a 5 star recipe!

Very nice.  I really don't like mayo, so I subbed sour cream.  I used about 4 tomatoes, not 5, and the pie wasn't soggy per se, but it was not easy to get out of the pie pan.  A bit fragile, so I'm wondering if a stouter (heavier?) dough would be better--like a pizza dough or something. It could have just been the dough recipe I used.  At any rate, I put cheese on top of the crust first, then layered the tomatoes.  I added some tomatoes on top of the cheese mixture for garnish.  I like all the flavors, but the pepper is quite strong, so maybe a bit less next time.  I did layer the tomatoes as directed, but probably should have patted them dry after draining as another reviewer did.  Thanks for the recipe!

What a unique dish! It's soooo yummy, especially with fresh tomatoes and basil from the yard! This tastes like a pot pie/quiche sorta concoction. The one thing I did differently was due to an accident. I forgot to add the fresh basil leaves so I had to dig up all the mayo 'n cheese to try to get the basil down with the tomatoes. SO I wound up with the basil some tomatoes and the topping jumbled up together...but it looked REALLY pretty and yummy when it was all cooked up cuz u could see bits of tomato and basil poking through the cheese! Add lots of basil. LOTS

It was very good.  I baked the crust first. I salted/sweated the tomatoes and dabbed them with paper towels to remove extra moisture. Since I did that, I omitted the extra salt. I also added mozzarella to the cheddar/mayo mix, and spread it over both layers of tomatoes, not just the top, like the spice mix. Finally, I added sliced tomatoes to the top. Delicious, but still a bit too salty (like most American recipes?)

Something was missing in the flavor - sauteed onion, crushed red pepper, bacon, pepperoni, something like that. I used a miracle whip style mayo and it had an incredibly strong flavor. If I make it again I'll add more veggies (maybe sauteed onions, garlic, and spinach, maybe even mushrooms) and halve the mayo.

Exceptional and we look forward to having this each summer.  I lightly coat the cooked crust with mayo to keep it from getting soggy.  I like to chop up the 'watery' fresh tomatoes and let them drain to minimize the moisture.  I like using fresh basil, about 1/2 cup.  So many variations you can add to this recipe and it still tastes great!

I like all the ingredients listed in this and am a huge tomato fan so I thought I'd really like this. I've never had or heard of "tomato pie" before. In the end, it was edible but not great. It was overly mayo-ey and rich...somehow in a bad way. I used some really great tomatoes for this recipe and was disappointed that most of this dish went wrapped up as leftovers that were eventually just thrown out.

I grew up in the south and have always loved tomato pie.  It is a quintessentially summer dish.  So....why have I never made it before now?  Because I thought it was hard and that it required some complicated ingredient list.  Well I was dead wrong!  This recipe is as simple as it gets!  Easy to modify and easy to double!  Don't put it off!  Get some tomatoes and a ready-made crust and wow your friends and family!  You won't regret it!

This was a great hit at work. The changes I made :
I laid slices of tomatoes on a double thickness of paper towels and sprinkled with salt. I let them sit while I prepared crust and other ingredients. I used about 5 Tbs of fresh chopped basil.  This is so good !

I loved this dish. I have too many heirlooms in my garden right now, so this is a great way to use some up. My family enjoyed this as well. I made my own pie crust since I don't really care for store bought crusts. The only problem was it was a bit runny but that was probably the heirlooms since they tend to be more juicy than others.

l made this exactly as stated, except l formed it in
a loaf pan - l just like cutting slices better than wedges.  We enjoyed this, and it was a nice change
from just a regular veggie side dish.  Next time, l will make this with crisped bacon, for that realy BLT taste.

This was really good! Ended up using less basil, because I thought it seemed like too much. I forgot to peel the tomatoes. It was alright anyway, but would have been better if they were peeled. My husband & kids were teasing me as I was making this, because they thought it sounded gross. But in the end, they liked it.

Both me and my husband loved it!  He doesn't like tomatoes, so him liking it is saying something.  It didn't remind me of pizza much, but still delicious, and I do agree it would be good with mushrooms.

A little bland and soggy.  Would like to try other's suggestions of canned drained canned diced tomatoes.  Thinking about adding mushrooms and onions next time.

My family thoroughly enjoyed this recipe.  I made it exactly by the recipe but mixed cheddar and mozzarella cheese.  It was quick, easy and very economical especially now that fresh tomatoes are so abundant.  Loved it!

I gave this one a shot because it had so many good reviews.  I had my doubts because based on the ingredients and methods of preperation it didn't sound quite right.  Well, live and learn.  Not even my boyfriend cared for it, and he'll eat anything.  But use your own descretion, perhaps this just isn't a dish for everyone.

Took this to a church potluck and it was rave reviews and passing out the recipe to everyone. Easy and simple this makes a great meal or side dish.
