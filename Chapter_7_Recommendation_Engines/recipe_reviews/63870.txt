This was a big hit for my family. They were licking the bowl. You can add some jalepeno peppers to spice it up.It is really quick and easy to make.

Very yummy! Made for Monday Night Football last night. Very easy too. Used Tostitos Scoops- they work the best! I probably used more cheese than called for- I used the light Mexican blend. Thank you for the recipe!
