Really liked this.  I think next time I will cook the bacon by itself, remove it from the pan, then cook the pork and onion.  I think I used half the pork called for and twice the sauerkraut (being what I had on hand), and it tasted pretty fantastic.

My family really enjoyed this. Instead of putting it in the oven, I put it the slow cooker on low for 6 hours and it turned out great.

Ok, so you look at these ingredients and think "This'll be good, but not overwhelmingly good", and you'd be wrong (don't worry I thought the same thing)! This is so incredibly good! I used a full 32 oz jar of sauerkraut and added a touch of brown sugar to the mixture. I also browned everything in a Dutch oven, then added the drained sauerkraut to that mixture; then just put the Dutch oven in the oven. It made for a one-pot meal and less dishes to do. And it seems like it's a lot of paprika (and it kinda is) but it's not overwhelming at all. I will definitely be making this again, thank you!
