Thank you for sharing this recipe! I have been looking for years for the perfect waffle recipe. Our 23 year old son who scorned waffles now begs for these! I bought an Oster Belgian Waffle  flip style maker and we have  used this recipe so much that I make up Ziploc bags of the dry ingredients to have them ready in advance which makes waffle hungry men very happy when mama is still half asleep in the morning. Everyone wants this recipe once they try it! I have tried it with lemon juice & milk in a pinch, but buttermilk is THE best baking ingredient.
We loved your recipe so much that we bought our kids their own waffle makers to go with it because they were so wowed.
I also divided the recipe in half for just my hubs and me, and  made it larger for crowds. 
I used to think you couldn't get moist, airy, crispy outside delicious waffles without an expensive mix.
Rejoicing!

The batter was WAY too thick, and I had to add a considerable amount of additional milk to get it to the correct consistency.  I did add some additional chopped strawberries, and if I make again, I think I’d add some vanilla and maybe a bit more sugar. The recipe made six Belgian-size waffles which cooked perfectly at 5 minutes.   Although I wouldn’t say these were my favorites waffles, they were pretty tasty.    Thanks, Brad, for sharing your recipe.

my husband loved these. I made them for his birthday breakfast. I did use margarine instead of butter, light buttermilk (I mistakenly bought light instead of regular), and I added a little more chopped strawberries than the recipe called for. just over a cup. I also sliced strawberries and topped the waffles with them. to me, they didn't have quite as much flavor as I was expecting, but still very good. I couldn't put syrup on mine, so maybe that is why. my husband suggested putting sugar on the strawberries I topped them with to get that syrupy strawberry juice and we'll just use that as the syrup next time.  as far as the batter being too thick like a previous reviewer said - I thought it seemed pretty thick, too, but it worked. I had no problem with them turning out just fine, and didn't need to add any more liquid.

Easy to make.   I used, fresh raspberries.   I think waffle recipes need a little sugar.
