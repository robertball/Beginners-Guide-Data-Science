Yes! We had an interesting dinner, all bacon in everything... so for the Semifreddo we followed the recipe to the letter up to adding extra ingredients. In place of the raspberries I added 1/2 cup of crisp bacon chip, 1/4 cup chopped roasted almonds, 1/4 cup pistachio, 1/4 cup pumpkin seeds & 1 vanilla bean.
Give it a try, it was amazing. Made a light caramel sauce for topping. Also, none left!!!

Confession time - we ate it as a pudding after the first round of freezing and the raspberries and the pistachios were folded in. It was so delicious we couldn't wait! Can't wait to try it  again, actually frozen :)  The semifreddo base will adapt easily to whatever we have on hand...

This was amazing. I am trying to kick sugar to the curb so I made this with honey on hand, and it came out great. Some of my guests were tempted to lick their plates!

Following this recipe to the T produced great results, but I did add a few minor changes the second time based on what I had available and the need to make more semifreddo without double all the ingredients  - I used frozen raspberries and added them before I put the mix in the mold, and I used 2 cups of cream to add some bulk.

It was wonderful, and it had a chewy taste!
