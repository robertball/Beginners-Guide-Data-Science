This was pretty good did make some changes.  I used fresh mozzarella.  Next time I will make homemade pesto and not put as much on it.  It was a little strong.

One of my favorite pizza styles, however I didn't use the pesto & basil combo. I instead sprinkled the crust with red pepper flakes, then layered the cheese, the  tomato slices, the fresh chopped basil, and a little more cheese on top. Now THAT'S pizza margherita!

I used homemade pesto and Jay's Crust from this site, but store bought would have tasted good as well. I used regular sliced tomatoes, and added basil leaves. I seasoned it with just a bit of garlic salt and oregano, then topped it with mozzarella and parmesan. This came out wonderfully! I love a simple pizza.
