Wow, these were really good!  I only made enough for two of us, and I rehydrated dried minced onion instead of using fresh.  They needed about 12 minutes to heat through and melt the cheese.  I can definitely see making these ahead of time when you want to feed a number of people at once.  Very convenient.

Quick, easy, no mess, delicous and very filling bunwiches. Family enjoys them. I now keep frozen ones in the freezer at all times for any occasion. Just pop one or a couple in the oven and in 8 minutes you have a gourmet sandwich. Thank you for the great recipe.

What a great way to dress up a ham and cheese. I used a full sized burger bun and sliced cheddar since I was out of Swiss. I don't care for onion s crunchy texture, so I used onion powder instead and Dijon mustard. I baked mine for almost 15 minutes and it was warm but not hot by any means. I could have given it a few more minutes easily. I only made 1 sandwich and baked it in the toaster oven. I'd fix this again, it was a nice change from a cold ham sandwich. Thanks Pasofanatic.

These sandwiches are great!! After making them once my fiance & I are now hooked on them. They're really great with Arby's sauce too if you happen to have any left over :)

So easy and soooooo good.  I made these in an assembly line with my son and husband.  Took no time at all.  They freeze wonderfully and are so convenient.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

GREAT!!!  The leftover ham is now serving double duty in these sandwiches.  I did the assembly line with my husband as well.  I agree the cooking time for frozen needs to be longer.....but THANKS for a great idea.

I added some horseradish to the spread and used spicy brown mustard.  When baking, we found sandwiches needed the full 15 minutes to get everything warmed through (from frozen).  Served with soup for a fast, filling meal.

I'm surprised these don't have more reviews. They are a huge hit in our house. We serve these when the kids have friends over, for grab-and-go lunches. They are also great served with soups. The only change is I use dried minced onion instead of fresh. But that's laziness ... I am sure the fresh is even better!

I scaled this down to just 2 servings. Next time, I want more dressing on the bun, so I'll probably scale it down to 4 servings. I left them in the oven for 15 minutes and they were just warm, not hot. A really good, different way to eat a ham sandwich.

This was soooo good!! I didn't put the onion or the butter in it, but I might try the onion next time, since the flavor needed a bit more kick to it. Still amazing! I usually don't like Swiss cheese, but this was a great combo

These were very good.  I've made the hot ham & cheese rolls where you melt the butter, mustard, poppy see mixture and pour over the top.  I like this better, doesn't seem as greasy.  I shredded the onion in my scaled down recipe and that worked out very well.

Quick, easy, delicious and I can make up in the morning and heat in the evening for dinner.  I had leftover ham and whipped up three of these for dinner, in the morning.  Wrapped in foil and put in the fridge.  At dinner time, I baked for 15 minutes as they were lukewarm at the 8 minute mark.  We really enjoyed these, very minimal prep and clean-up.  I great idea for nights when you are going to be rushed or a night when you are having a large crowd for dinner.  Yes, I would make these again!  I served these with corn-on-the-cob and 'Sweet Potato and Black Bean Salad' from AR.

I make this for pot lucks with just couple of alterations.... I used deli-sliced ham instead of steaks and I use the 24 pack of sliced party buns (mini buns). Makes plenty for sharing!

Very Good.  I also added 1 tblsp Worchestire & left out the onions.  After mixing the ingredients, I put it in the refrig so the butter mixture would set up, so I could spread it on the buns.  I got 12 servings from recipe & also baked for 15 min.

I used leftover Honeybaked Ham from Easter and they turned out great.  I omitted the poppy seeds and used sesame seed hamburger buns.  Instead of swiss I used both american and muenster. This is a great way to use up the leftovers and have an easy to fix meal in the frig for the kids.  The cooking time is longer than stated to get nice and toasty and warmed through.  I did for about 15 minutes.  If frozen it is closer to 30 minutes.  Thanks!
