Hey, ive made this recipe quite a few times now, and i think that with these improvements, you could have a 5 star dish:

1) Fry the onion with the aubergine and garlic. Otherwise the onions still stay crunchy when youve got them out of the oven.

2) You dont have to layer it if you dont want to. Its just if you need to be particularly careful over presentation.

3) In the last 5 minutes of cooking, take the lid off the casserole dish, to allow the parmesan to brown slightly

4) Leave the casserole lid off for the last 15 minutes of cooking, to try to evaporate the liquid that stores up at the bottom of the pan. Otherwise, you'll end up with a rataouille soup!

Anyway, thanks for sharing!

This is a flavorful, hearty recipe, but very low calorie. I served it as a main dish with couscous to soak up the liquid. 

Like many other reviewers, I made a few adjustments based on the availability ingredients, and prices at the supermarket, but nothing major:
*I cooked everything in a crock pot on low for 8 hours (the house smelled wonderful!)
*I added only a little freshly grated romano cheese just before serving, instead of parmesan as the recipe calls for
*I added yellow squash in addition to the zucchini

I had enough ratatouille for dinner for my husband and myself, lunch the next day, dinner several days later, and frozen portions for an easy dinner this winter. 

Great recipe!

I usually make a saute version of ratatouille, to keep the vegetables crispy, but this baked version came out with nice crisp vegetables too, and it was very easy to make.  I added some thyme and rosemary, and a splash of white wine and served over rice to soak up the delicious juices.  This is a perfect addition to my harvest season collection.

Excellent vegetarian dish! Instead of cooking it in the oven, I just sauteed the whole thing. I first cooked garlic and onion in olive oil, added the rest of the ingredients, put the cover on and cooked until the vegetables were tender (about 30+ minutes). Some changes I have made: One large tomato and one can of diced tomato instead of 2 tomatoes, added some  basil, pinch of red pepper flakes and a drizzle of olive oil at the end, and sprinkled freshly grated romano cheese right before serving instead of mixing parmesan into the vegetables.

Will make it again!

After watching the Disney Movie "Ratatouille". My kids wanted to make the dish. I cut up all the veggies with a mandoline and let them layer everything into a baking dish.  It was a wonderful accompaniment to parmesean chicken.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.  Who would have thought a Disney movie would make my kids eager to eat their veggies.

Loved this!  Aside from the chopping, very easy to prepare - popped it in the oven and had time to do other things while it baked.  I did make a few changes: used 1 zucchini & 1 yellow squash, a whole 12 oz pkg of mushrooms,sliced, no green pepper (forgot to buy it, but don't really care for it anyway-may try red or orange next time), sprinkled a mix of chopped fresh parsley, basil & oregano over each layer, used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh (but can't wait to try it with fresh tomatoes from the garden!), and added browned italian style turkey sausage for my meat-loving guys.  I also forgot the parmesan on some of the layers, but added some shredded mozzarella on the top for the last 5 minutes or so of baking. 
I used a 9x13 baking dish, and it just barely fit.  As noted by other reviewers, 45 min didn't seem long enough, so I baked it for about 60, covered part of the time.
I served this over brown rice, which soaked up all that yummy liquid, and a nice Tuscan bread.  Family loved it . . . will definitely make this again with all the fresh veggies from garden.  Thanks for sharing!

I used the ingredients listed, with the exception of the cheese, and prepared it in a large saucepan instead of baking it. I added a little red wine, one cup of tomato sauce, a little thyme and rosemary. I cooked the mixture on medium heat until the extra liquid was absorbed. Prepared this way, it was delicious by itself or over pasta.

Made this twice, and I feel a few little tips makes this go from great to fabulous. First, use a lot of eggplant (use a large eggplant, not a small or medium) as this is the "top" flavor. Press the garlic rather than mince for a bold garlic flavor in the eggplant. Remove the eggplant from the saute pan then lightly brown the onions in the same pan. If it's sticky, add a little water, but be sure to keep the browned bits from the eggplant/garlic mixture. This flavors the onions like you can't believe. Use both yellow and green zucchini squash if you can. Use FRESHLY grated Parmesan cheese. Use red, orange, or yellow bell pepper instead of the green to add a nice sweetness. Other than than, follow the recipe as written. It's really yummy!

I really liked this recipe. Cutting up all the vegetables was the only lengthy part. I added some paprika with each layer to add some spice to the dish!!! I was looking for a ratatoullie recipe that I like... this one sure qualifies!!!

This was actually really yummy.  Alterations:  we sprinkled mozarella over the top which was good, we're not big zucchini fans so we might use yellow squash next time.  Beware, this does take a long time to prepare.  There were three of us chopping vegetables and it took 20 mins.

What a great recipe.   Not an eggplant fan so I used butternut squash and only sauted the garlic.   This was easy to put together and smelled wonderful while cooking.   I have passed this on to several family members and friends who just rave about it.  Thanks for sharing!

Very pretty, fresh, versatile vegetable dish with lots of room for improvisation. Simple enough too--just layer your choice of vegetables with a drizzle of olive oil and cheese in between layers. Throw some minced garlic in wherever you choose. In my case, I didn't do the sauteed eggplant/onion thing, just layered sliced zucchini, portabella mushrooms, yellow squash, onions and tomatoes. But use and layer however you like! I have always done this on the stovetop, but baking it in the oven makes life so much easier!

Wow! I was looking forward to trying the leftovers after reading these reviews, but there weren't any! My kids (thanks to THE movie) wolfed it all down. The cat even licked out the bowl. I made this once before (pre-kids) and don't remember it being this good. Thanks for the wonderful recipe. It went perfectly with a nice loaf of crusty sourdough bread.

A couple of notes: be generous with the garlic. I used 3 large cloves with one medium-sized eggplant. I also used fresh parsley from my garden (2 tbsp). I forgot to get the mushrooms, but added one yellow squash to the layers. Remember to slice all the vegies THINLY (about 1/8") making the ratatouille cook through in 45 minutes in an 8 x 10" pan. (It shrinks quite a bit from cooking.) I also sliced the tomatoes thinly and placed them on top, using Asiago cheese throughout. It was fantasticly moist with a delicious broth. I'll be making this again (certainly at my kids' request!). Who would have ever guessed that they would ever ask for something WITHOUT meat made WITH eggplant, green peppers, and squash? Hallelujah!

I have one reason and one reason only for giving this recipe 5 stars. You have done the impossible and created a recipe that #1: I actually can say that I enjoyed zucchini in (I am a zuke hater!) and #2: utilizes eggplant in a way that tastes good. I wasn't going to say that I hate eggplant, I just hadn't found any way that I liked until this recipe. I gambled on this and figured it was a 50/50 shot, my husband & I were either going to really like it or really hate it and it's a good feeling to say that we really liked it. I love the flavors of all the vegetables together. I liked how all of the veg on the upper layers leaked down and flavored the zukes and eggplant. This would be an awesome vegetarian main dish if one were to use sliced portabellos for the mushroom layer. I used chanterelle mushrooms because they are in season here and my neighbor is kind enough to give them to me. Thanks for a delicious recipe!

Great ingredients ..... especially the sauted garlic and eggplant.   Did that, as given but used much more garlic!!  I made the following major change ... mixed the remaining ingredients (except for the tomatoes), LIGHTLY  sauted them, layered then in thirds, about 1 cup each, adding tomatoes, cheese, white wine, and basil between layers.  I used more cheese on top.  I reduced the baking time to 30 minutes = perfect outcome.  The vegetables were not overcooked.  I RARELY alter the original recipe the first time but think the ingredients look better with a little more color from sauting.  I will make this on a regular basis. Thank you for the healthy, meatless dish!!

I sliced the eggplant into rounds along with long slices of zuchini.  Then salted and sweated both for 1 hr, rinsed and patted dry. Sauted garlic and added eggplant to slightly brown.  Layered in 2 casserole dishes with chopped bell peppers, onions, summer squash, lowfat  moz & fresh basil blended with dolops of fat free ricotta.  Topped with planko mixed with low fat parm.  Cooked in middle of oven for 50 mins then moved to top to brown on 'low' broiler setting.  Good with diced chicken and couscous.  Definitely will make again! Very hearty and filling.

I took the advice in other reviews and cooked the onion and garlic until soft along with the eggplant.  I also added 1 T corn starch to it before spreading it on the bottom of the pan so that when it produced juice in the baking process it was not so runny.  I baked uncovered and it was absolutely fantastic !  I've added it to my favorite vegetable recipes.

It's a good ratatouille recipe and the top-rated review mentioning frying the onion, garlic and eggplant was right on.

One other suggestion: add oregano and basil to taste.

I prepared it in two containers (one was full, the other was half full) without covering either. This didn't seem to affect the preparation, although the one that was full produced a lot of liquid at the bottom.

This is such a great recipe! It's fairly easy to make, aside from the chopping. Healthy. And delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except for 2 suggestions. I sweated the eggplant first and sauteed the onion along with the eggplant.
Also, I noticed some people said it was "soupy". I think sweating the eggplant and NOT covering the dish during cooking resolve that. All I had was a bit oh juices in the pan.

Absolutely delicious!!  What a wonderful way to use my summery, garden veggies.  I followed recipe to the tee with the exception of omitting the green peppers (I didn't have any), I used vineripe yellow tomatoes, and I sprinkled grated Italian Blend cheese on it layer in addition to the grated Parm.    I served with Salmon but definitely substantial enough for an entire meal.  I did not have any "soupiness" that others described....

I followed the recipe to a "T", except I threw the garlic in with the eggplant for the last few of the 10 minutes to prevent burning the garlic.  As I pulled the completed ratatouille out of the oven, I was prepared for it not to be anything special, because it's basically just layered cooked veggies without a lot of herbs.  I don't know what it is about this dish, but it is a very special treat.  My carnivorous husband took about three bites and then said with a very serious, sincere look "Amazing.  One of my new favorites."  I am looking forward to making this healthy, tasty dish more often.

This was really good. I used portabella mushrooms in it and a mixture of Parmigano Reggiano and Pecorino Romano for the cheese and it came out fantastic!

I really didn't think I was going to like this.  I was afraid it was going to be dry and boring.  I was very surprised. It was not dry at all and the vegetables were moist fresh and tasty.

A very nice version, though I admit that I did salt down the eggplant for an hour prior then rising it and sauting it afterwards, along with some butternut squash and mild Italian sausages. I used my madoline to slice and layer everything, adding the paresman with some paprika, thyme and little fresh basil at each layer. I added about a cup of merlot wine over the top and left it uncovered in the oven. I drained the fat (from the sausages) before serving, using a ring to serve a nice tiered cylinder, allowing the accent layering. It was very tasty, and my wife who normally hates eggplant and was complaining when she heard I was making Ratatouille, loved it. Thank you.

This was absolutely outstanding. I've never even tried Ratatouille before but my hubby was recently diagnosed with super high cholesterol, and I am trying to lose some weight from having my baby, so I've been looking for healthy meals to make. I saw this, had the ingredients, so I went for it. It was amazing. I had the parmesan in the bottle, by Kraft, and sprinkled that in between layers. I added a bit of brown rice I had left over from last night. And then I cooked some whole grain pasta. I topped the pasta with the ratatouille. A-m-a-z-i-n-g. I also went heavy on some oregano and garlic salt. This really made it delicious (I didn't have parsley). It's super healthy too-- great for those trying to cut some calories and cholesterol. Since I am trying to lose weight, I ate more of the ratatouille than pasta. Veggies are naturally low in calories. Try this recipe. I promise this will be a regular meal in our home from now on!

Delicious recipe!  This time of year, with everything so fresh and yummy, you can't really hurt a dish like this!  I layered the veggies in a 9 by 13 baking dish, and the only changes I made were not using mushrooms (I love them, but I didn't have any) and I used fennel rather than onion because I had it in my fridge.  I also probably used closer to 4 T of olive oil in all and a splash of white wine just before putting them into the oven.  I made these alongside meatball hoagies for my family of meat eaters, and made myself a roasted veggie hoagie of my own topped with fresh mozzerella!  Yum!  I would definitely reccommend using these for sandwiches, if not the first night, then with your leftovers!

Glad to get a baked recipe for zucchini and eggplant.  This is very good, but does need some spicing up.  I add about 1/8 tsp red pepper flakes when suateeing the garlic plus some mozarella and old cheddar between layers.   There is a lot of flexibility with this dish and one can use their imagination.   It certainly does not have to be dull.   Thanks again.

This recipe takes longer to prepare than 15 minutes. It takes quite awhile to chop and cut everything. Also, I'd use a larger than a quart and a half casserole or reduce the amount of each ingredient.

I made this last night to go with Parmesan Crusted Tilapia also from this site. I sauteed onion after egglant, added more garlic, used vine ripe tomatoes, salted both eggplant and zucchini to sweat out some liquid from them before cooking for ~45 minutes wiped dry, sliced everything very thin, baked at 375F (my oven usually take longer than most suggested time on recipes) for 30 minutes and lowered to 360F for last 15minutes (both time uncovered), I probably used less parmesan (around half the amount stated or less). I loved it, my picky husband liked it and had second serving! Not so sure with the kids so I am letting them see the Ratatouille movie again right now. :-)

I really enjoyed this super-easy dish!  I had no zucchini- but no matter.  As a few other reviewers noted, it does create quite a bit of liquid, but the flavor is wonderful!  Next time I will add some spinach.  Thanks Lynette!

I made it as listed.  Unfortunately the recipe doesn't say whether to bake it covered or uncovered so I guessed uncovered (which may have been wrong).  It came out a little salty and the vegetables were still crunchy after 45 min in the oven, so I covered it and cooked 20 min more.  It was still crunchy and there was a lot of liquid in the bottom of the pan after cooking.  Next time I will try some of the suggestions for modifying the recipe, such as sauteeing the onions first or even cooking the entire thing in a saucepan instead of the oven.  In my view, this recipe has too many faults to warrant five or even 4 stars.

Excellent! I incorporated a lot of the User comments from the most helpful reviews. First, I baked this dish without a cover the entire time and I still had a lot of (extremely flavorful) liquid in the bottom quarter of the cassarole dish. Second, after sauteeing the eggplant in the garlic parsley and olive oil, I used the same pan to sautee the onion on medium high heat until it carmelized lightly (so it has a light brown color but still has body. IMO, this added a nice flavor of the overall dish. Third, I did layer the veggies ending with the tomato on top. After sprinkling with the parmesan it gives a pretty design on the top if you do it this way. Oh, and in the last 10 minutes I added a thin slice of fresh mozzarella over each of the tomato slices, and this made the dish more hearty and was delish but the dish would be excellent without. This is a wonderful recipe! Thank you so much and I will certainly make this again.

First time making this dish I went by the recipe. The eggplant was soggy and onions undercooked and the tomatoes were blah. What I would do is instead of chopping the eggplant I would slice it and cook it with the onions. the tomatoes don't need to be chopped but sliced, and some more seasonings would help rosemary, thyme, oregano, little bit of red pepper flakes. Good dish hope my suggestions help.

This was great - baked it in a 9 x 12 dish to give you an idea of how much it makes.  I look forward to the leftovers this week.  I used about 1/2 c of pecorino romano cheese rather than the parmesan.

I had never tried cooking ratatouille, but the eggplants in my garden are being produced like crazy so we decided to try this for dinner last night and it was SO SO SO good!  My husband and I ate everything but maybe two servings in one sitting!  I normally hate it when people leave reviews for altered recipes, but I had to do it because I stayed very close to the recipe and it really was that good that I have to share!  I made two minor adjustments: first, all the ingredients did not all fit into a 1.5 qt casserole dish.  I had to up it a 2.2 qt dish and everything fit perfectly.  The second alteration I made is I added a a couple of layers of chopped, fresh basil.  Our herb garden is doing well also and I was excited to use the basil, otherwise I would have probably followed the recipe as is.  It's so good, we are cooking it again tomorrow!

I loved this recipe.  I cooked the onions first and added smoked paprika.  BUT, I added goat cheese to the leftovers and that made it amazing..I will add crumbled goat cheese to the dish in the last 5 minutes next time.

Fantastic!  I've never had ratatouille before, but I really like the way this tastes.  I just cooked all of it on the stove top, so it got a little mushy, but the flavor was excellent.  Thanks for a nice recipe!

Loved this! Made it tonight for me and my husband. We made it our own version Ra(vi)toulle. I put raviolis on the bottom. Added green chilli instead of bell pepper. Added 1/2 a beer and used Monterrey Jack cheese. It came out delicious. Even made my husband (the vegetable hater) a Vegetable lover.

Great Recipe. I don't like eggplant so I substituted with summer squash.  Cut the parmesan to save a few extra calories and removed the foil the last 15 minutes to brown a little more (electric oven and the rack was set low).  Everyone enjoyed this dish.

Absolutely fabulous!  Made only a few changes… 1 zucchini & 1 yellow squash instead of 2 zucchini.  Instead of parsley, I used sprigs of fresh rosemary & thyme.  **Also a little warning, prep time takes much longer than the 15 mins the recipe suggests.**

Some notes from our experience:

These are our fav veggies! Because it is a little bland though, we serve it on couscous with black bean sauce. Yum. I cut out a lot of the salt because of this.

Next time, I will add more cheese, maybe an extra half cup on top. I have also made this without cheese, and it's just as good. 

I add bread crumbs on top, and sometimes tomato sauce or condensed soup. Paprika to each layer adds some variety, as was recommended earlier. 

We used most of a large red onion. This tasted great, but there was too much onion. If you're using a red onion, maybe stick to half.

We use one yellow and one green zucchini, this was perfect.

Also we only used 2.5 small tomatoes, and so were short on the sauciness other reviewers talk about. Maybe this is a good thing, but next time I will try with two medium tomatoes. We also used one orange pepper, which added to the colour really nicely, and was much more interesting to eat.

About the eggplant, we find it helpful to coat the eggplant mixed in with a little water, which prevents it soaking up too much oil. 

I make this regularly now.

This was SOOO good!  Inspired by the movie to try something new, we looked up this recipe and gave it a try.  EVERYONE loved it.  Even my kids ate it up.  The tomatoes on top were so good, we were all looking for more.  I served it with egg noodles and mixed it all in with the noodles for the kids.  My husband took the leftovers to work and big tough marines were wanting some of his veggie dish!  This will definitely be worked into our regular rotation.

I really loved this recipe! This was very easy to make and you can make it ahead of time. I was looking for a recipe  that would help me get more veggies into my diet and this was it.  Lots of flavor.  You can really adjust this to your liking.  I added some dried seasoning mix I had with dried tomatoes,rosemary and basil.  Also used a four cheese mixture.  Turned out  fantastic!  I could eat this everyday and have already made it 3 times in 2 weeks :-).  I took some to work for lunch and had people coming over wanting to know what smelled so good! My husband even liked it and he doesn't like eggplant(he asked later what the weird vegetable was). Thanks Lynette for sharing this recipe!

Delicious!!! My 6-yr old son requested this for dinner recently, being inspired by the Disney movie, and we made it together. Putting it in the oven, I wasn't too impressed. But after it came out, I took my first bite and was hooked!

Increase the parsely up to 3 Tbsp and add 2tsp oregano.  It really adds to the flavour.  Also, I cook mine over the stovetop (sauteed) and omit the parmesan, but the rest of my family wouldn't like it much without the cheese.  Serve over steamed rice.

Fantastic! My family really enjoyed it. We didn't have mushrooms, so skipped that part of the recipe and we subbed a yellow squash for 1 zucchini. (again, based on what we already had!) We served it with jasmine rice.

Delicious! I loved this recipe. I served it with bread and chicken parmesan, but to be honest, I think it would be better as a main dish with a side of bread. It   is really delicious! The only thing I did differently was to sauté the onion and bell peppers before layering them. I did this only because my daughter doesn't like those veggies and I knew that she wouldn't eat them if they were even slightly crunchy. I will be making this again.

Excellent veggie dish.  I had some fresh basil and oregano from the garden and added it plus a few sprinkles of balsamic vinegar.  Next time I'll cover it until the last 10-15 minutes in the oven since it took quilt a bit longer to cook than 45 minutes.  I toasted some french bread with melted mozzarella on it and topped it with the ratatouille.  Will make this again!

Mozzarella broiled on top just made the dish. Next time I won't saute the aubergines as much. They came out much too soft. I sprinkled oregano and basil between the layers along with salt, and the last layer before the cheese I added black pepper. I loved how this recipe had a little of every flavor, sweet, sour, savory... it was excellent.

I loved this recipe! I made it with my 5 1/2 year old daughter, thinking it would help her eat different veggies, and she loves the movie "Ratatouille" so I figured she would love this. She didn't end up eating any - but I sure did! There was not a problem with too much juice - in fact there was no juice in mine when it was done. I figured this needed a little more salt but I was not generous with it when we were preparing it so that may have been why. We ate this over jasmine rice.

Very very watery (I had to pour out a bunch of liquid when I pulled it out of the oven) but delicious!!  I forgot bell pepper, added yellow squash, and used much less parmesan cheese. I love veggies, so I could have eaten the whole thing in one sitting :)

I have been making ratatouille for years and this is the  best ratatouille recipe that I have ever made. I could have eaten the whole thing by myself. The only thing that I did different from the recipe is that I didn't add any salt because parmesan cheese has enough flavor in my opinion.

When I told my boyfried that I was going to make Ratatouille, he made a face and said, "Isn't that just vegetables?"  Based on his reaction, I could tell the real reason why he wanted to take me out for dinner Saturday night, the night I planned to make it.  He didn't seem any more thrilled when I announced I was making it Sunday instead.  He grumbled about it all afternoon, until I finally put the plate in front of him.  He GOBBLED it up and asked for more, repeatedly saying how good it was.  I got several more compliments from him, later, as we were cleaning up the kitchen.  Needless to say, this went over very well.  I made the recipe as instructed, except that I also added pepper with the salt and parmesan.  Thanks for a good, healthy meal that I'm sure will be a repeat!

This recipe was absolutely delicious, flavorful and wholesome as well! I highly recommend serving with rice or pasta, as it is much of a side dish. Next time, I'll add either chicken or pepperoni to the mixture as it tastes much like pizza with mozzarella cheese. Yummy!

Awesome! Definitely use high quality parm cheese for this(and lots of it.)Also, be sure you cube the eggplant into pretty small cubes or else it gets tough. My kids and I even put one chive on top of each serving (like the movie.) All three kids LOVED it and would never have eaten those veggies on their own.

Surprisingly delicious!  I honestly didn't think I would like the recipe, but after seeing the Disney movie, I thought to give it a try.  We loved it. Even my husband, who grew up only eating peas and corn from a can, liked it I did play around with a few extra spices and added some oregano and a little extra cheese, just our personal preferences. Also, I added some dry bread crumbs on top.  Thought it gave it a little something extra.

I made this with yellow squash instead of eggplant. It was so good, they asked for it the next night. The second time I made it with eggplant, we liked the yellow squash better, but this is still a great recipe.

I haven't done a review in ages...  I prepared this for a small dinner party.  It was very good, and easily prepared.  I didn't include mushrooms (my wife does not care for them), and added yellow squash, red bell pepper, and used sweet onions.  I prepared the dish several hours ahead of time, which made it very convenient.  I received numerous compliments and was pleased with the results.  I would advise fresh cheese, perhaps a Parmigiano Reggiano.  I used grated Parmesan as I forgot to purchase fresh cheese, and I think it made a (negative) difference in the flavor.

I'll prepare this dish again - most definitely - but will use fresh cheese next time.

Loved this recipe.  I followed instructions pretty close.  My husband who can't stand eggplant said "Wow this is really good!"  It took much longer than the 45 minutes.  I baked it for additional 20 minutes then upped oven to 400 degrees for about 5-10 minutes.  It was really good.  Next time, I am adding more eggplant and using a larger pan.

This is delicious! It's a simple meatless meal. I think it's best to layer the eggplant in slices on the bottom and the tomatoes on top. That way the eggplant soaks up the juices and the tomatoes are roasted.

Great recipe! I do not like eggplant, but was so happy I tried this! Used tomato sauce for paste, fresh basil--not thyme, and didn't have any red/yellow peppers on hand. Tasted amazing with all adjustments. Love how flexible this recipe is!

Yum Yum Yum!  Great Italian Flavors.  My family was never a fan of eggplant until tonight when I served Lynette's Ratatouille.  I personally love eggplant parmesan and other eggplant dishes, but never could get anyone to join in happily.  --  In the past, I had been curious about the great reviews that ratatouille usually generate, but with draining, sauteeing, and baking, all after a good deal of chopping, it seemed a daunting task.  These days I'm more adept with a knife, and this recipe did not call for salting and draining any veggies....  That appealed to me.  Tried it this way ***but baked the casserole in an oversized 'baking stone' type casserole to enhance evaporation***.  We did have a few juices in the bottom of the casserole, but not a problem at all.  We simply served with a slotted spoon.  The tomatoes which were purchased to go with the eggplant and zucchini were already eaten up yesterday when I wasn't looking, so I subbed canned, diced tomatoes.  I was concerned about that substitution, but it worked out just fine. Served on a bed of brown rice with Connie's Zucchini 'Crab' Cakes (baked not fried) from this site and a side salad.  Gobs of veggies all across the plate, but it felt like an old fashioned, comfort food, meaty meal.  The 12 yo (our youngest) had seconds of everything - eggplant too!!!  Thanks Lynette & allrecipes.com, for another healthier meal on our rotation! Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.......

This was delicious! I left out the cheese because I don't do dairy, and didn't have parsley (which offers little flavor anyhow) so I used some fresh basil. I also forgot to throw in the tomatoes (which I was planning on adding after the rest cooked so they wouldn't be super mushy). Even so, this was really tasty! Did not miss the parmesan at all, nor the tomatoes. We ate this over a bed of cauliflower rice, and were supremely satisfied. I will be making this regularly!

Took others' advice, and sautéed onions with eggplant, did not layer (just put it all in the dish) and added basil, oregano, thyme, crushed red pepper. Made part with some tomato sauce stirred in for a thicker consistency. Really enjoyed it and will make this again.

Mmmm, it's no coincedence that my house smelled like fresh pizza (minus the dough)! 1. I sauted the mushrooms and onions to release and remove the extra water before baking. 2. I added oregano, & chile pepper flakes, and omitted the salt (the cheese has salt in it). Spoon the cassarole over rice or pasta and sprinkle with mozzarella and remelt.

A really nice surprise,  kinda watery (should have used rice to soak it up) and perhaps some basil or italian spice to spice it up and would  add black pepper next time but otherwise very good.

Perfect side dish! I love recipes like this that let the natural flavor of the veggies come through. I used Reggiano Parmesan cheese which was so delicious with the fresh vegetables. Thanks for the recipe!

This was excellent.  I paired it with rice and black beans (for a complete protein).  I baked it in a 9x13 uncovered (so it wouldn't be soupy, like other reviews had mentioned) for 45 minutes, then sprinkled colby jack cheese over the top and cooked for an additional 10 minutes. It was delicious!  We will definitely be enjoying this one regularly.  The leftovers were even great the next day for lunch.

Great recipe and very, very versatile.  If you have a a cup of left over home made pasta sauce (I'm Sicilian so we call it gravy), you can use that as layer between the vegetables.  If you're serving it for company, spend the extra dough and buy Parmesano Reggiano.  It's not essential, because this recipe is killer, but it kicks it up just a bit.  Thank you!  Will make this over and over!

This is a great recipe, I did make some revisions though, just minor things that really brought out some great flavours.  I used portabella mushrooms to give some really great flavour and nice meaty chunks, I also used fresh cilantro to make the herb flavour more intense as well I added some fresh dill and fresh basil. It was great and the broth that the veggies made was superb, you could start this as a soup recipe really.  I also used orange and as well as yellow bell peppers, as they are nice and sweet and have way more flavour than a green bell pepper.

Healthy, Yummy dish.  I added a total of 1/2 cup of barley between the layers to soak up the juices and to fool my DH that this was a main dish (no meat, gasp!). Served with garlic bread.  This is a great way to use up whatever is growing in the garden.

This is a fantastic recipe!  It smells so good, it's irresistable - even to teenagers.  I sent it to my son's French class on a party day and it was a favorite.  (Shh, don't tell 'em it has eggplant!)  If you overcook this, it becomes watery.  I omit mushrooms, added yellow squash and used fresh parsley.  Also, I always saute my onions.  

Like others, I serve this with rice or couscous and sausage.  YUMMY!

This is such a yummy dish! I was worried about it being dry as it does not call for much oil but the veggies supply a lot of liquid when they cook which keeps things moist.

My husband is about as picky as the kids when it come to veggies but he loved this so much he was eating the leftovers for lunch the next 2 days! Awesome recipe but make sure that you get really fresh and ripe tomatoes. If not it will just take away from the rest of the veggies.

This was a big hit!  I sauteed the onions with the eggplant and made that my base layer.  Before sauteing the eggplant, I tossed in a little salt and let sit in a colander to make a little less bitter.  I didn't include any other salt.  I included dried thyme to the eggplant, and a bit of paprika to the tomato layer.  

I doubled the recipe and it was enough for two 9x13 pans.  I covered with foil for the first 45 minutes then removed the foil and continued baking for another 15 minutes to allow some of the juices to evaporate and to brown the cheese on top.

I ended up with a fair amount of liquid, but served the dish with a slotted spoon and with couscous.   People took extra liquid to soak their couscous.

Made this recipe a  star with the below changes. Used: Sweet Turkey Italian Sausage, 1- Zucchini, 1 - yellow squash, 1- egg plant, 1- red onion, 1- green pepper, 1 - pack Baby bella mushrooms, 2- cans of diced tomatoes with Oregano/Basil, Freshly Shredded Parmesan Cheese, minced Garlind, Dried Oregano, Dried Basil, black pepper and Sea Salt. First I sliced all of the veges very thin.Then I cut the casings off of the sausage and browned about 5 links. I then transferred this to a simmer pot. I then added more olive oil and sauteed the onions, peppers and mushrooms. I added these as well as the cans of tomatoes to the simmering can. At this point I added 3 tsp of minced garlic, covered the top of the pot with dried Basil and Oregano, salt and pepper to taste. I then sauteed the Zucchini and Squash and added them to the simmering pot. At this point I have been simmering the pot and transfer everything to a baking dish. I then take my freshly shredded Parm and add it on top. I put this under the broiler until melted. It really tasted like a Lasagna!! Even the kids ate it up ( except for the tomatoes :-)

Ratatouille is a weekly dish in the summer using our fresh veggies from the garden.  I make many different versions and I do enjoy this one.  Great over pasta, with crusty bread or over rice or grain pilaf. Love it!!

I thought it was awesome, but my meat-eating roomates didn't exactly care for it. Next time i'd put some mozzarella with the parmesean on it for extra cheesey-ness. I also added acorn squash because i needed to use it up. Yeah, no. Bad idea. Ended up eating around the squash. All-in-all, great recipe!

A really good low cal veggie dish, although I found it a bit lacking in flavour (added extra garlic, onions and a few red pepper flakes to give it a bit more kick). The mix of veggies gives it some visual and taste interest. Served it as a main dish with bread.

I made this and was very skeptical, boy was I wrong! The veggies are soooo good! The only thing I did differently was I added more garlic (5 cloves) and I layered everything from the eggplant(cut into thin slices) which I still sauteed in the pan until the became soft. I wanted it to look like the Ratatouille from the Disney movie , layered so the kids would try it!! It came out great and I can't wait to make it again! Thanks for a keeper!

Delicious!  I used 1 large eggplant, 3 zucchinis, 1.5 onions, 1 pkg of sliced mushrooms, 1 green pepper, 1 red pepper, 1 yellow pepper, and 1 can of diced roma tomatoes.  My zucchini and peppers slices were quite large and took about 1 hour to cook fully.  Everything barely fit in a 9x13" baking dish.  I covered for most of the baking, and uncovered for last 20 minutes or so to get rid of some liquid.  Served with wild mushroom couscous and roasted chicken.

Absolutely fantastic as written.  We prefer more garlic and more tomatoes... The recipe makes about twice as many servings as listed.

Excellent!  I looove garlic so I added a tad more and it came out so great.  One bite and I had to get in the car and drive an hour to slap my momma.

AMAZING! I just made this for my anti-vegetarian-meal husband and two little (2 & 3 year old) picky veggie eaters. When I put it together and realized what a fool I was for thinking they would eat eggplant, mushrooms, onions, bell peppers... and hubby hates tomatoes... I actually started cooking something else for them while the Ratatouille was baking. But they ALL ate it! I myself love veggies (but not mushrooms) and couldn't believe how wonderful this dish was. Two thumbs way up!

This was a delicious summer supper. I sprinkled a bit of mozzarella cheese over the last layer, and when I served it I drizzled it with a bit of balsamic vinegar.

This was wonderful. I did make it a little differently then the recipes said because I didn't want to use the oven. I made this on the stovetop and sauted all the veggies together. I used eggplant, onion, green pepper, tomatoes, zucchini and carrots. It was such a yummy side dish!

This was delicious!!!  The only thing I changed was I used 2 cans of seasoned undrained diced tomatoes, as suggested by another user.  If serving over rice or pasta, it adds some flavored sauce.

I have made this twice now, once with fresh tomatoes and the second time with canned diced tomatoes, because it was all I had.  The canned tomatoes turned out better, I thought they gave it a little something extra.

Amazing. I can't wait to make this again! My six kids gobbled it up, even my eldest daughter who does not like veggies in any form! The only thing I did differently was to use canned tomatoes, saved the juice and mixed a bt of cooking wine with it and added about a 1/2-3/4 cup on the layers. YUMMY! We watched the movie after eating it and the kids were delighted that they got to feast on the real thing!

Great recipe!  The only change I made was cooking it in the crockpot instead of the oven (after sauteing the egglant).  I put it all in the crockpot on high for about an hour and a half and it was cooked perfectly. Served it over polenta.  Yum!  I will definitely make it again.

Really enjoyed this with fresh-from-the-garden vegetables. Had to make a few substitutions because of what I had on hand, and I ended up making it in the saucepan rather than baking. But the flavor is definitely there, substitutions or no. Served it over rice, and tossed a can of pinto beans in it (didn't have mushrooms). Subbed yellow banana peppers for the green bell. For the kids, shredded cheddar/jack and for the adults freshly grated parmesan. Very yummy.

Really good! As a new cook, this was really simple, and really amazing! I'm not a fan of veges, esp. eggplant and zucchini, but this was amazing! I agree with some, the cutting of the veges takes a while (maybe 5-10 minutes) but it's def worth it and it's very easy! Will def cook for my wife (when I'm married of course :p)

This was absolutely wonderful!  I started out making this as a side dish, but once I saw how much it made decided to make it the main course.  We did not miss the meat at all.  In fact about an hour after dinner my husband commented, "that ratatouille didn't have any meat in it did it?".  "Nope".  He loved it.  I served it with a spinach and fruit salad and french bread.  The only alterations I made was to use yellow and zucchini squash and omit the green bell pepper.  I am not a big fan, and did not have one of the colored bell peppers on hand.  I may try an orange or yellow pepper next time.  I will make this again and again.

Truly the most delicious recipe I've made from this site yet.  DO NOT change a single thing.  The only thing I had to do differently was use a bigger dish.  Perhaps because I didn't really, measure anything.  Just chopped and dumped.  I've gotten 4 meals out of it already, and have enough for 3 more.  I suggest serving over brown rice so that you don't waste a single drop of those delicious juices.  Ten stars wouldn't do justice.

I loved this dish. I made it for movie night at home, and to encourage my son to try it, I served it over whole wheat linguine with pesto. It tied in well with the movie Ratatouille (whose main character is a chef named Linguine). My son, and even the hard-core carnivore husband, thought dinner was great. Everything fit (just barely) in a 2 qt. dish. I also recommend sauteing the onions before baking. NOTE: I think that the ingredients might fit better if only one zucchini is used.

This turned out great.  The changes I made were I followed the suggestions of adding a splash of red wine and a splash of basalmic vinegar.  I also stirred in a few tablespoons of tomato paste and some chopped fresh basil and parsley.  Oh, and I had some red onion, so I added a bit of that as well.  I will make this over and over again.  Plus I saved the leftovers, chopped them up, spread them on a pre-made pizza crust, topped with mozzarella and it made an excellent pizza.  My fiance said it was the best he's had in ages.  A great way to hide those veggies!

This is a good basic recipe, I use red onions and red , yellow and orange peppers for the color and sweetness. Just before serving I add a tsp of balsamic vinegar just to jazz it up a little.  Great over rice, pasta or baked potatoes.  This is the kind of recipe that you can let your imagination run wild.

This is a good dish.  I'm trying to get myself to eat more veggies, and this certainly helps!  I did make some changes because I didn't have eggplant and we never have onions.  So I omitted both and changed it so that all of the veggies would have the flavor of olive oil and garlic.  I mixed each veggie in a bowl with a bit of olive oil, minced garlic, and onion powder, then layered, salted, and added parmesan.  Although I have to admit that after I placed the zucchini I just started dumping each veggie in and spread it out to make a layer. What can I say?  I'm lazy--but it still looks pretty.  I like the roasted flavor, and it's a good way to make veggies.  I did end up with a lot of liquid at the end, but I'm really not surprised with all the fresh veggies.  I'll make it again, but maybe half as much because it does make a lot.

Loved it....used one eggplant peeled and cubed, one zucchini, onion, red bell pepper instead of the green, a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes, 1/2 large can of cruched tomatoes, dried oregano, basil, and a drizzle of evoo....let that bake. So healthy and delicious....would be great served over pasta.

This was absolutely delicious. I'd recommend increasing the heat to 400 degrees as mine was not fully cooked after 45 minutes at 350. I upped the heat to 450 for another 15 minutes and it was great. So I think 400 for 45 minutes would do it next time.

I love making ratatouille.  I am doing the south beach diet, and this recipe is VERY south beach friendly, as all of the veggies are low on the glycemic index.  With mine, I add italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, a couple of cups homemade marinara sauce, and some mozzarella cheese on top at the end of the cooking time.  I also cover it with foil for the first half hour, and cook for about an hour.  It's great served with grilled chicken for a very healthy south beach meal.

This is excellent and versatile.  I made twice in 1 week, didn't have any mushrooms the first time and found the recipe even better with the mushrooms.  As good re-heated.

This is absolutely, hands-down, the best vegetable dish I have ever tasted.  The only thing I changed in the recipe was I omitted the green pepper and used an orange and yellow pepper for color.  My husband said..."I'll definitely eat this again".  Thanks Lynette.  Definitely a keeper!

Served it over pasta, and I did not like it. Just tasted like cooked vegetables. Nothing special.

This was, bar none, the BEST vegetable dish I have ever tasted!  I brought some garden veggies to my mom--her only changes were to sub a 1/2 c of mozzarella for 1/2 c of the parmesan to lighten it up a bit.  It was marvelous--try it!

I added a few drops of very good olive oil to the top and browned in longer than 45 mins.-did it more like 60 mins.  It had an amazing taste.  didnt use eggplant, but yellow squash instead.  i will cook this often if i can.

OMG!  This was so, so, so good over couscous!  And talk about guilt free, healthy eating!  I followed the recipe exactly other than grilling the onions prior (I'm not a fan of crunch onions), using two bell peppers rather than one, and slicing the tomatoes versus dicing.  
New favorite.  Tons left over for healthy lunches... I've had this in my recipe box for over a year...shame on me for not trying it before now.

I've never had ratatouille before, so I wasn't sure what I was to be expecting-but it's a nice refreshing dish. I only made half of what the recipe originally called for. I left out the eggplant, the boyfriend and I just plain don't care for it no matter how we prepare it. Used two zucchini to kind of make up for the eggplant, plus we LOVE zucchini. I did not layer it, I mixed everything together and put the tomatoes on top. Added just a touch more cheese, like I do with practically everything. I think the biggest change I made that would help this dish is ADD some seasoning! Had I not, I feel I would have been rather disappointed. I served over some white rice. It's not a 5 star dish, but for the amount of effort it took it's something I would again make after a long day.

Try roasting the vegetables single layer on sheet pans until tender crisp and lightly browned, instead of baking or sauteeing., then mix them all together with their juices and fresh herbs. I do the tomatoes separately, for less time.  The caramelization really ramps up the flavor and uses less oil (and less hands-on time). So versatile - hot or cold, with parmesan or mozzarella, stuffed in a pita or by itself. I make this all year round, but it's heavenly with summer farm stand vegetables.

I followed the ingredients of this recipe, but used fresh herbs - basil and parsley, because I had them - and I omitted the mushrooms, because I didn't have any.  It turned out wonderfully!  This  was our main dish on Meatless Monday, with some fresh green beans and crusty bread!

I followed the recipe exactly, but the finished product had no flavor. It was just a pile of watery and somewhat soggy vegetables. Unfortunately it didn't live up to all the rave reviews.

I've never cooked with eggplant before, and the one I used ended up being pretty bitter. I'd try it again and hope I get a better eggplant. I added fresh thyme and rosemary, and that was delicious.

I had to use a 3 quart casserole dish. There was no way to fit it in a 1.5 quart dish.
This recipe needs some more flavor besides salt and parmesan cheese. I think next time I would use some other herbs and saute all of the vegetables, not just the eggplant and garlic.

The ingredients as portioned will not fit into a 1.5 quart casserole dish (they barely fit in a 3 quart). That aside, I found this recipe rather nice. Aside from some minor tweaks it stands up quite well as a dish on its own or over pasta. I added a sprinkle of parsley, black pepper, and oregano every other layer the second time I made it and was quite happy with the results.

I made this for my family and my boyfriend and they all loved it. The vegetables are delectably soft and moist, and the flavors blend perfectly together. The parmesan and salt add a lovely touch and bring out the juicy flavors of the vegetables. So good served with chicken and bread. Its extremely healthy too! I will definitely make this dish again!

Doing South Beach, vegan or vegetable diet? This was fabulous, the blend was great and my wife used a variety of mushrooms, portabellas were in there and would've sworn the juices left were French onion soup. Will make this again & again, healthy & delicious!

I have no idea how authentic it is since I'd never had ratatouille before I made this, but I must say this was fantastic, and very easy to put together. The only change I made was to use romano cheese instead of parmesan, and I probably used a lot more than the recipe called for since I had a big bag of it and just grabbed handfuls of it to sprinkle between layers, but the end result was very nice. My husband wasn't incredibly keen on it because he hates eggplant, but even he thought it was pretty good.

This is tasty but..  I suggest using fresh parsley when sautéing the eggplant.  Also, make sure to sweat the eggplant before cooking for about 20 min.  They sauté faster and it gets the bitterness out!  Also I add a yellow squash instead of two zucchinis, adds a different flavor to the pot!

Dinner tonight. I replaced the mushrooms with yellow squash, used the Kroger brand "3 pepper and onion blend" frozen veggies in place of fresh peppers and onions, and skipped the herbs entirely. . . And this was a fantastic dinner! Going to double the veggies next time. Very hearty, and amazingly tasty!

Good recipe and easy to make.  The first time I made it I followed the recipe, except I went easy on the salt, since the cheese already has a salty flavor to it and I don't like my food too salty. It needed a more savory flavor.

The second time I made it, I added more cheese - Romano, Asiago, and Parmesean.  I also left out the salt, but added dried oregano and basil in addition to the parsley.  This added just the flavor I was looking for. My husband loved it. YUM!!

We used the leftovers to make ratatouille pizza - it was awesome!

Love this recipe!  I keep it even more low cal by leaving out the cheese, and don't miss it a bit!  I like to take the lid off for the last 5 min. and turn the broiler on to give the tomatoes a nice brown color and roasted flavor!  Have made this over and over with rave reviews from the whole family.

This dish is delicious! I had never made Ratatouille before, but it turned out wonderfully the first time thanks to this easy to follow recipe. I substituted Romano cheese for the Parmesan and it tasted great.

The recipe makes quite a lot of food. It made enough for a dinner for two and lunch for several days after.

Easy. After slicing veggies, pretty quick recipe. Looks pretty when finished but doesn't hold up as well once scooped into. Omitted green peppers, still flavorful.

I love this recipe.  I think this is a very simple and "rustic" type meal.  I like to serve it along with a "rustic" style bread that helps soak up the delicious juices.  I do not have one complaint.

Tasty combination. Like other suggested, no need to layer the vegetables. It does tend to have a lot of extra water after it is cooked, which I am not a fan of.

My stepson has been wanting to try ratatouille for a while. I have never cooked it before though. My wife was a bit concerned that everything was sliced except the eggplant but it was spot on. It was exceptionally good! We had it with those Perdue chicken with white wine and garlic thingies. I would definitely have this again with minimal changes (more garlic as we all love it). One thing i noticed though for 1 eggplant was that you didn't need so much of the other ingredients as stated in the recipe. You could probably have one zucchini and cut back rest as well, then again it may just have been the dish i used.

Ok. The eggplant should really be peeled before being diced and cooked... maybe it's just me, but I find eggplant skin to be chewy and add nothing (and if you cook the dish correctly, it won't fall apart with the skin off). I also left out the mushrooms; they are traditional to the dish and don't really belong. I like muchrooms, just not here. The onions should also be cooked until tender BEFORE being added into the casserole, otheriwse they don't cook all of the way through.

This was a great main meal recipe.  I'm not a vegetarian and was leary of this recipe but my son wanted me to try it.  I'm so glad I did.  I broiled up some italian bread to go with it and it was wonderful.  I never missed the meat!

Layered all in a slow cooker.  Substituted yellow squash for bell pepper only because I don't like bell pepper.  Used a few more tomatoes because hubby likes them.  Served over pasta.  Fabulous.  Will make again!

This was just as others had said:fabulous!I just used cooking spray in the bottom of the pan.I didn't have the eggplant so I subbed in 2 sliced cooked chicken breasts.I didn't saute the garlic or parsley.Sprinkling it over the chicken was fine.The 2 cups of mushrooms was exactly 1 8oz box of fresh ones.Half-way through& on top I did sprinkle thyme & rosemary with the parmesan.It was perfect for a 9x13pan.This is SO easy & delicious the first time as well as a reheat!Wow!

Excellent!! I usually do this stove top but baking in the oven was super easy and I am so pleased with the vegetables keeping their shape!  I added coriander and rosemary for flavor...Try serving in a bowl with melted provolone on top  WOW!

I used Blue Cheese just because I thought it would give it more flavor and added about a TBS of butter to sautee the veggies.  I didn't even bake it.  I just cooked it on top of the stove.

This recipe did not turn out for me, and I can't figure out why. I did not use eggplant, but otherwise everything was as the recipe, I just substituted additional zucchini. The flavors did not come together. The zucchini and the tomatoes were undercooked. Bitter, watery and unappealing.

This was very good!  Will be perfect in summer when those tomatoes and zucchini are growing like crazy.  Might try it with some browned Italian sausage next time, but very good veg dish just as it is, too.

This was really good!!! Often the acidity of tomatoes will keep onions from cooking, so, as suggested by another another reviewer, I also sauteed the onions with the garlic and the eggplant. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. My husband and I loved this! Definitely will make this again!

I love this recipe. I am busy with small kids so we take several shortcuts to make prep fast and easy. I use a bag of frozen squash slices, bag of seasoning blend (onions, celery, bell pepper), couple cans of Rotel tomatoes, grated parmesian and then I just have slice the zucchini! Makes a whole dinner with some parmesian chicken and some brown rice.

This was a very hearty and delicious veggetable meal, but there really wasn't that much flavor except for the natural flavor of the veggies. I experimented with various cheeses and seasonings and found that there has to be more seasoning. This was good but I warn you that you should put in a lot of cheese and seasoning to make it really tasty.

This was my first time eating ratatouille. I followed the recipe exactly, except that once it was done cooking, I drained off the juice, reduced it by half in a saucepan then returned it to the veggies. It was delicious! I ate it by itself this time. Next time I'll try serving it over rice and sprinkle the cheese on top after it's plated. Maybe try different types of cheese.

Most delish! Very easy to make, I followed the recipe. The only variation I made was that I added some low-fat shredded mozzarella in the last few minutes of cooking. I served it with some multigrain angel hair pasta and some fresh ground pepper. I may try adding some fresh basil in between layers next time.

this was the perfect way to use all the fresh local vegetables we had been getting in our co-op share this summer. Hearty without being too heavy. The perfect vegetarian dish.

Simple healthy and hearty.  Next time I wouldn't sautee anything - everything was more than soft when it came out of the oven.  Crunchy onions would have been nice! Use a yellow or orange pepper for color.  I served with couscous because it was quite soupy on the bottom.  Don't skimp on the cheese!

I cut it all up as thin as my uncoordinated hands would allow, tossed it in a huge pan that was lightly oiled, a lil salt/pepper & parsley and cooked it til it was soft (took about 35 minutes).  Sprinkled a lil fresh Parmesan on top of each serving and the family loved it! :D  Traditional ratatouille nicoise doesn't have Parmesan, parsley nor half the vegetables asked for but they do add to the dish quite nicely.  The only thing I will change in the future is the bell pepper as its flavor is a bit too strong and takes away from the other veggies.

Very good and not bland at all.  Omitted the mushrooms because I did not have them.  Added some mozzarella cheese on top because I thought it would be bland but it didn't even need it.  Great quick recipe!

I've always felt that a recipe had to have meat in it to be considered a main dish.  This recipe changed my mind.  Served with couscous it is a complete and very satisfying meal.  Pulling from various reviews I made the following changes.  I sauteed the onion with the garlic and eggplant.  Used 1 zucchini and 1 squash rather than 2 zucchinis.  Used one can of diced tomatoes rather than 2 tomatoes.  Added thyme, rosemary, red pepper flakes, and basil to the top layer just before topping the whole thing with the last bit of parmesan.  Before serving, we drizzled each serving with olive oil and romano cheese.  I used a 9 x 13 baking dish with foil for 30 minutes and uncovered for the last 15.  I'd become a vegetarian if I could eat like this every night.

I made the recipe as stated.  It definitely could improve with the addition of more seasonings.  My suggestion would be some balsamic vinegar.

This was the best thing I've made in ages!  I just made a couple little changes... I sauteed the onion with the eggplant and added fresh chopped basil, thyme and parsley to each layer along with the cheese.  I did everything in my dutch oven; only one pot to wash.  I baked for 1 hour with the lid off for the last 20 minutes or so.  I put a couple pieces of toasted ciabatta on each plate before piling on the ratatouille to soak up the sauce.  Heaven on a plate!

It's good, but a bit bland. Make sure to add a bit mroe spices, including chili pepper flakes with the garlic. Also, cheese is important.

OMG, It's an AWESOME recipe!! I sauteed the onion, garlic, capsicums, fresh herbs and the sliced mushroom in tomato paste and use it as sauce on every layer of the veges. Thyme & sliced celery sticks make a great addition to the dish. I put an inch layer of half cooked spiral pasta at the bottom of the dish to soak up all the extra juices. It comes up perfect! One pot meal.

I had made ratatouille once before, and wasn't too pleased with it.  After reading this recipe and the reviews, I felt like I needed to give it one more try - and I'm so glad I did!  I used extra virgin olive oil, a little less than called for, and an extra clove of garlic (just because I like garlic).  I didn't have any mushrooms, but I didn't miss them.  Also, per other reviews, I sauteed the onion with the eggplant, and skipped the whole layering fiasco, just throwing everything together in a 9x13.  And I didn't have any trouble with extra juices as I never put a lid on it.  Oooh it was so good!  I am going to go eat the last of the leftovers now.  Thanks for the amazing recipe!

Wonderfully simple, healthy, and delicious! Makes the house smell awesome! I sub. fresh rosemary for the parsley, add a few sprigs of thyme and sprinkle torn fresh basil on top just before serving.   I serve mine with rice pilaff if im in a rush and homemade bread if i have the time.

Fantastic!  I can't decide which veggie I like best because they all work so well in this dish!  I threw in 1/2 cup of pesto and with a bit of reckless abandon I threw all of the veggies in together rather than carefully layering as instructed.  It all turned out excellent...I don't think it's going to make it until dinner!

This was a really great recipe. I followed it but was conservative with the cheese. I didn't cover it while baking in the oven, and it still came out a little too moist. Tomatoes are not in season here, so I used spaghetti sauce over the top instead. It came out great, although a little watery. I will surely make this again!

Delicious.  Followed previous reviewers recommendations and sautéed the onions.  The veggies where nice and crispy.  Also baked uncovered the last 15 minutes.  This recipe is a keeper!

Very good...love the parmesan taste! It does get runny though so I drain it near the end and pop it in the oven with the foil cover and comes out nice and steamy.

I have to say I am jealous of all of the reviewers using fresh from the garden veggies.  Being from Ohio orignally I know that feeling!  However, this was great!  I have wanted to make this ever since the movie came out but thought the veggies would too over cooked.  Not so with this recipe.  They were crunchy, just the way I like them.  Thank you for sharing.  The only change I made was adding Romano cheese instead of Parmesean and a little more garlic and fresh parsley.  BTY I got the idea from a post I had on this site looking for fresh veggie casseroles.  I really love this site!

This was wonderful. I did it all on the stove, used fresh herbs instead of dried, omitted the bell pepper, and added garlic spinach chicken sausage. I sauteed the sausage separately, added it to the veggies after they were done, and served it over rice. The kids weren't too thrilled with all the veggies, but my husband and I loved it.

This ratatouille is probably one of the heartiest dishes I've ever had, and it's only made with vegetables!  I like to pack on a LOT of parmesan cheese-- it adds a really nice flavor.  The juices from the tomatoes drip down through the layers of the ratatouille, making it very succulent and flavorful.  I recommend this easy dish to anyone and everyone, especially vegetarians looking for a hearty meal!

I hate vegetables and I loved this. I used way more than 1 cup of cheese, though. Maybe 2 cups. Awesome. Husband said he wasn't hungry then ate half the dish... I will make this again.

This is awesome! I made the recipe basically as it is written, except that I left out the mushrooms (my husband hates them) and added some yellow summer squash. I also probably used less cheese than the recipe actually calls for; I just grated the cheese over the pan as I layered the veggies in. I would say that this recipe also makes more than 4 servings, probably closer to 8. The leftovers are just as good as the first time around, I made this dish yesterday for dinner and wrapped it up in a tortilla with some Italian dressing for lunch today and it was wonderful!

Added red pepper flakes between each layer.  Delicious served over brown rice.  Cooked for an additional 10 minutes.  I added garlic, parsley, basil, and onion powder to the rice.  Great healthy meal !

This dish is delish! With a few adjustments... I replaced the eggplant with butternut squash, threw in a cup of finely chopped fresh basil, added 3 extra cloves garlic plus a helping of garlic powder, 1/4 tsp. Italian seasoning, 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper,  1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes, and 1 can of tomato paste.  I threw mine in the slow cooker- on High for over two hours (until butternut squash was tender) Very Easy, great on its own or with pasta!

delicious!  My boyfriend and I loved the recipe. Roughly chopping and slicing only took about 10-15 min. I did follow a few suggestions though, while I was layering in the rest of the ingredients I let the onions saute and caramelize a little before adding it in.  I also chopped up some kalmata olives and put it on half (i hate olives but my boyfriend LOVES them) the olives gave the 'sauce' a nice tangy bite.  I served it over white rice and black beans for added protein.  It was instantly a hit and I will make it again and again.

Excellent!  A new family favorite!  The only changes I made was to skip the mushrooms and cook it at 325 for two hours or more.  I substituted 1 can of diced tomatoes and poured them over top of all the other veggies.  I serve it with small pasta or rice.  Yummy!

I layered in portabella mushrooms, green zucchini, Vandalia onions, red and yellow peppers and sliced tomatoes, the cheese blend I used was parmigiano Reggiano and parmesan and of course the egg plant I increased the garlic by 2 tsp.
Everyone loved it and the presentation was fabulous.

I was completely curious what Ratatouille actually was and stumbled upon this recipe.  I must say that this is by far my favorite dish ever.  I use more of a shredded cheese with Parmesan in it to give it a kick in between layers.  I also make sure to salt each layer and must advise to take good care of the eggplant when you season it.  If you saute it with the right amount of garlic and spices it becomes almost the main component of this dish.  We also put a few sprigs of Thyme on top for flavor and cosmetic purposes and eat it with a crusty french bread and a glass of wine.  Delicious.

It was okay. Really it's just baked vegetables with a little cheese. There wasn't enough fluid/sauciness to have it over noodles like we tried, and it was just really plain by itself. Needs some more seasoning.

This was the best vegetarian dish I've ever made or ate. I didn't have mushrooms, I used fresh parsley and I was low on parm. cheese so I added 1/2 mozzarella instead. It was perfect at 55 minutes, served with crusty bread and buttered noodles (just one would be more then enough).

Was used to mixing and sautéing all the vegetables, but now much prefer this gorgeous recipe.  Doubled it and followed the recipe. Used fresh garden tomatoes. While others used crushed or diced, having the sliced red tomatoes on layered on top finishes this dish perfectly.  It a 9 x 13 it took me 45 minutes at 375. Perfect for when you have guests.  My kids asked me if I made this or if I had help from our alley rats...

Very good base for a veggie recipe! I didn't quite follow the recipe, but loved the principle; veggie/cheese layers baked till done. I topped with cheese and Italian Seasoning and served over couscous like others recommended. Thank You!!

What a great recipe! I shared it with my neighbor and she loved it as well! I tweaked it a little by dicing the onion and adding it in with the garlic. I also minced some fresh herbs from my garden for added flavor. I used thyme, romsemary and oregano! Yum!!! What an easy, flavorful recipe!

We were skeptical because ratatouille sounds so fancy and this recipe seemed so simple-- it was great!!  I've seen a lot more complex recipes, but this one was simple, only a little time consuming with some chopping, and such a great mix of flavors!  I sprinkled a little thyme on the tomatoes based on other reviews, and it seemed to fit right in.

This was a very flavorful and pleasant way to eat veggies.  This recipe could use just a tad more seasoning, maybe a little black pepper and dried basil (Which i added to the tomato layer).  We enjoyed it over pasta.

I am a vegetable hater and this is amazing! I used acorn squash instead of eggplant and added some feta cheese in addition to the parmesan and breadcrumbs on top and i cooked it for about an hour and a half. I found mushrooms, onions, and peppers that were already sliced, but it still took some time to chop the rest. totally worth it!

OH MY GOD!  My first attempt ever at ratatouille and my entire family loved it.  I was surprised we all loved it so much, now I can cook something with eggplant other than traditional dishes I commonly use it for.  This was wonderful.  I did only one tiny bit of change, I mixed fresh Parmesan and Mozzarella together that I seasoned with oregano.  And that was it.  This is WONDERFUL.  I loved it so much.

This is an EXCELLENT way to prepare vegetables!  The only modification I made to the recipe was omitting mushrooms b/c I didn't have any, and I used canned tomatoes b/c I didn't have any fresh.  All the flavors blended together into a delish dish!

It was good, though the eggplant was bitter. Definitely will soak eggplant in salt water before cooking next time. I also added large dried breadcrumbs and a layer of mozzarella on top toward the end of baking time.

Very easy dish! You don't need all the veggies listed, just as long as you cut them to the same size. I left out the eggplant as my grocery store didn't have any fresh ones. Also, as my family's mostly lactose intolerant, I took the suggestion of one of the reviewers to use squash (I used acorn squash, cut into chunks, boiled in water until I could easily poke a fork in, removed the skin with a spoon and mashed like potatoes). Mixed in garlic and parsley into the squash and put it in between each layer of veggies. Huge hit!

This was OK.  It was a lot of prep work, but easy.  The taste was kind of bland, though.  If I make it again, I'll add some more flavoring.  Also rice, couscous or something would have been a good idea, as others have mentioned.

I really wanted to love this but my veggies came out soggy at the end where I was expecting them to be crisp. I followed the recipe as is for the most part, used fresh parsley when cooking the eggplant and used a sprinkle of Romano and black pepper on top of the tomato layer. I used a mix of button and cremini for my mushroom layer and red and green peppers for the bell pepper layer. I will try to figure out what went wrong and will try this again some time. It still tasted good, I served it with the "easy curry couscous" from this site.

It was delicious for a veggie meal.  I would agree with other reviews to serve  as a side dish, served with rice my husband said he was still hungry.  He had two huge servings.  But if you are trying to eat healthy this is a great flavorful meal.  My son wouldn't touch it but he's two.  My husband had suggested I make it after we had seen the movie.  He also commented how I wasn't making it like Remy. He now thinks he's a food critic.(lol)  I would definitly make it again.

This was really good. I didnt add the eggplant because I didnt have any, dont know if I would.  I did add yellow squash and some red pepper to the mix.  I didnt layer, I just prepared on stove and then baked it.  It was really very good.  I had used a can of seasoned diced tomatoes as well.

i made this for dinner last night, and while it was good, it was just okay. with these provisions, i am sure to make it magnificant.

i satuaeed  (s?) the eggplant in evoo and garlic, then added that as well as the rest of the veggies. i mixed all of them together and used sargento mozz with sundried tom and basil, mozz cheese, and parm to top it off. i also added what i thought was quite a bit [but obviously not enough] seasoning from my italian seasoning grinder and fresh garlic in with the veggies. added a few splashes of white wine and drizzled with evoo. i didnt get the sauce consistency that everyone else did, and was hoping to since i served this over spinach and tom pasta. next time, i will use sundried tom for more flavor, garlic salt, fresh basil, rosemary, and a can of tomatoe sauce italian seasoned. then i think it will be perfect and more for our tastes. good starter recipe, very versatile.

I used very little oil and omitted the salt entirely and still the Parmesan cheese made it too salty for my taste.  Will make it again substituting the Parmesan Cheese with a Breadcrumb/ground Flaxseed mixture and topping it all with shredded cheese.  Good Recipe

I had never had this before and for an all vegetable dish including eggplant, I think it's really good.  Of course, the more cheese you put in it the better it tastes (to me), but it's really not about the cheese, it's the vegetables.  The peppers, onions and tomatoes compliment the texture of the mushrooms and eggplant.  It's a hearty, good for you dish.

Bland.  I would take the advice of other reviewers and cook all of the ingredients in a crock pot or convert into a spaghetti sauce.  In order to make this edible, I would add at least another clove of garlic, a can of tomato sauce, some tomato paste, perhaps an extra tomato, add some oregano and basil.  Would only make again with adjustments.

It is good, but it is not a meal, it is a side dish.  I made it as a meal, thinking it would be alot heartier all baked together and was disappointed when it ended up being a pile of cooked veggies and cheese on my plate.  Will definitely make it again and again, but along side chicken, beef or fish.

I have died and gone to heaven. I am in LOVE with this recipe. Right now I'm eating it for dinner with parmesan couscous. I added yellow squash and used dehydrated onion instead of fresh onions. Next time - and there WILL be a next time - I'm going to sprinkle a bit of mozzarella cheese on top. I can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow!

I thought this recipe was terrific!  I took some suggestions about cooking the onions with the eggplant, and cooking the ratatouille covered until the last 15 minutes. It turned out great, quite a bit of liquid in the bottom of the dish still, but didn't take away from the dish at all.  Might try a srinkle of oregano next time...and there will definately be a next time!

Great recipe!! I loved it and my friends inhaled it. The little that was left over was even better the second day. After I reheated it I crumbled some fresh feta on top and   I'm telling you it was delicious healthy comfort food. Fantastic!

YumYum. Use portabello mushrooms, and add a few sprigs of fresh thyme on top.  Instead of onions, I use 2-3 leeks (milder flavor, easier to chop), and saute them with the garlic and some herbes de provence first before sauteeing the egglplant/parsley.  Oh, and serve over pre-packaged saffron rice it's a nice touch and more flavorful than pasta.

Watched the movie... made me curious. :-) This is very good-- would recommend slicing the veggies thinly, so they cook in that time, mine too a little over an hour.

After reading all the reviews, my entire family was anxious to try this recipe.  We thought this was a major let-down.  We love vegetables but this was not what we were hoping for.

This is very, very good.  The flavor is subtle, which is how I think it should be.  There aren't a lot of herbs or spices to take away from the wonderful taste of the vegetables. I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was perfect.  Oh, and the broth is amazing!

PS: I too looked into this recipe after watching the movie.  I'm impressed with Hollywood for inspiring so many people to try such a healthy dish!  :-)

Tastes good hot out of the pot, but even better warmed up the next day.  I served it over rice and my five year old gobbled it all up!

Great change from the norm!  I omitted the green pepper and added yellow squash for personal preference.  I have to admit, I was a little nervous that it would be dry, but it was VERY juicy--which went well with the brown rice I served with it.  I also added a little mozarella because I'm a cheese lover.

This was very tasty and my husband loved it!
But it was a lot of work - it took much more than 15 minutes to prepare and the cooking time were closer to 60 minutes than 45.
I added Oregano, Basil, thyme and used more garlic than the recipe called for. (because we are garlic-lovers) 
I served it together with Penne but next time I will serve it with rise because of the amount of liquid.

This was a good recipe.  As written it makes a lot!  If I were to make again, I'd scale down.  Not a big hit with the kids...but then again, its veggies!  Overall, good recipe.  Might try it over pasta next time as someone suggested.

I cooked this without mushrooms, and really loved it. I needed to add a small can of tomato sauce 8oz, when I pulled it out of the oven, as the vegetables weren't completely tender, and didn't mesh into what I consider ratatouille. So it simmered with the sauce about 15 minutes longer on the stove with lid on. It was awesome.

This was pretty good. I would make it again. The only thing I was alittle disappointed about was that unlike what previous reviewers said, mine did not end up with much liquid on the bottom. When it came out of the oven, I mixed it with penne pasta. Served it with lots of parmigiana cheese and some ciabatta bread.

Didn't seem very flavorful to me and it was a lot of chopping.  I was sad to have used my eggplant in it.  My roommate and I found it edible, but didn't feel the need to save the leftovers.  Sorry!

It was okay, however was very watery and maybe called for too many different vegetables.  Perhaps try fewer veggies and make sure to drain them well.

I do give this recipe three stars for being quick and easy.  However, I must be honest.   The dish tasted AWFUL with the eggplant.  It was the first and last time I ever ate egg plant.  Egg plant has a real spongy texture.  About an hour after eating this dish, I felt really nauseated.  

This dish would definitelly taste A LOT BETTER without the eggplant.

This was delicious! I did make a few adjustments. I sautéed all of the vegetables until they were soft, as recommended by other reviewers.  I then added fresh parsley and some italian seasonings. Finally, I topped the dish with fresh slices of tomato and parmesan and mozzarella cheeses. I baked in the oven for about 30 minutes. Will definitely make this again! I served it over quinoa to absorb the delicious juices. This was yummy!

Started in skillet and finished in a pot. Used a generous amount of basil with garlic salt and italian seasoning for the veggies.  It was so good, especially with homemade garlic bread; I will be cooking it again, but this time I will be adding some diced potatoes.

We loved this dish! I did make a few slight modifications: I took the suggestions of others and cooked the onions with the eggplant until soft, I used Italian seasoning instead of salt and pepper, and I only salted the first two layers. Delicious!

Based off of reviews, I sauteed the onions with the eggplant. Next time, I will also add the peppers with the eggplant and onions. I used only one zucchini and shredded parmesan rather grated. I also used a bit less of the cheese while cooking, but added more on top when I served it. I also added red pepper flakes to spice it up. I will definitely be making this again.

As suggested, I removed the lid during the last 20 minutes to evaporate some of the juice and give the cheese a chance to brown a little.  Also, I had a few ounces of smoked turkey breast that I sliced.  YUM!  Thank you for posting this recipe it's incredible and no more calories than a salad.

The onions should be lightly sauteed before layering in with the vegs. Otherwise they do not come out cooked enough. I Cut the parmesan by about 1/3 otherwise it overpowers the flavors of the veggies.

This dish is so delicious I can't wait to eat the leftovers!  I followed the directions except for the length and cook temp.  I prefer my ratatouille to be tender so I baked the dish covered for 30 minutes at 350 degrees and then turned it up to 400 degrees.  I kept it covered for an additional 15 minutes and then uncovered for the last 10 minutes.  The veggies were all nice and soft and the flavors blended together beautifully.  I also only layered the cheese a couple of times due to health reasons.  I have always made ratatouille on top of the stove and will never do so again.  This recipe rocks!

Sauté the onions. Add yellow squash and substitute fresh parsley, add some marjoram and thyme in place of more salt with some of the layers.

I followed other reviewers' advice and cooked the onions with the eggplant first to avoid the crispy texture. I had to use a bit more olive oil than called for but overall this is a great dish. Tasty, healthy and great with plain yogurt as a side.

Healthy and nice, light Parmesan flavor.  Veggies cooked just right, not overdone.  Easily serves 6 (not 4).  Good for a dinner party because all the effort is upfront with the chopping and layering, then you just pop it in on the oven.

Cooked this for Christmas Eve. Made some changes: Instead of 1 eggplant, I made it 2. Added thyme and spanish paprika. Couldn't find dried parsley so I used fresh parley instead. It was so good, my family loved it!

OUTSTANDING! BUT, this filled half of a 6 quart Dutch oven even after it was cooked (and required the full capacity with raw ingredients). When I make this again (and I surely will!) I plan to cook the green pepper along with the onions in order to soften the texture of the pepper. For the record, this would feed 8 easily.

This is a wonderful vegetarian dish. I followed the recipe as written except to reduce the cheese a bit and saute the onion after the eggplant. I served over couscous as a main dish meal. My only quibble is that all these veggies would never fit into a 1 1/2 qt casserole. I cooked it in an 11 x 7 dish. The recipe does not say whether to cover the dish, but I did based on other reviews, taking the cover off the last 15 mins. Will definitely make this again!

This is the absolute BEST ratatouille recipe ever! Even though the preparation for this dish can be time consuming, it is so worth it. The different layers of cheese and vegetables is the best, and it is so flavorful. Even the liquid that was created from all the veggies roasting was good! We had leftovers, so we just kept it in the same pan and reheated it in the oven the next night, turned out great. Definitely a keeper recipe!

Very very good. 
I must confess, I made my version by starting out with Italian sausage for a more hearty main dish. Everything else was according to the recipe. It was awesome. I also sautéd the onions prior to constructing. I did the layering as suggested in the recipe. Will make again. It was pretty time consuming to do all that chopping and slicing but worth it.

This was my first time making ratatouille and my husband and I loved it.  I served it over a moist corn bread but polenta would also be good. I used two cans of diced tomatoes instead of fresh and cooked the onions for a few minutes with the garlic. Otherwise I followed the recipe, except for adding about a half hour to the baking time.

Good as is or made with a marinara sauce (added once it has baked) and put between two slices of toasted wheat bread or some other roll.

Oh so yummy! Love this medley of vegetables! I used extra, extra grated parmesan (don't use the powder stuff). With all this cheese it is like a veggie pizza without the yucky dough and too much tomato sauce. I declare it my new favorite pizza!!!

The parmesan cheese really makes a dish.  I thought it was going to need tomato paste, but I followed the recipe, but didn't use as much parmesan cheese as the recipe called for.  After the fact, I wished I had used exactly the amount recommended for parmesan but the salt in between every layer may not be needed.  Thanks!

Overall an easy recipe.  Hardest part is the chopping of the veggies.  It is a fantastic one dish meal, less to clean up!  I used only salt on the top and very little and the use of real, fresh grated parmesan cheese makes all the different.

I served this at a large family get-together, thinking it might be a way to get the kids more interested in veggies.  My oven was full, so I made it on the stovetop in a skillet.  Everyone loved it, children included.  I did add sliced smoked sausage, and a variety of colors of bell pepper, just because they were on sale and I knew it would be pretty to look at.  Eggplant is on sale this week, so I will be making it again very soon.  Thanks for the recipe!

I don't know what I messed up here, but I must have messed it up badly because everyone else seems to like this.  I was expecting tender, flavorful vegetables.  They were still pretty hard and not that tasty.

Overall the recipe was very good. I have two changes that should be made. The recipe calls for a 1-1/2 quart casserole dish, I couldn't fit all the ingredients in my 1.5 Liter (slightly larger) dish. Also, it would be better if the eggplant were "salted" and compressed (closes pores) before baking. Eggplant absorbs a lot of liquid due to its porous nature and leaks it as it cooks. My ratatouille dish was very "soupy". Also, the eggplant should be browned, literally. The texture of the eggplant is typically "soft", raw or cooked.

I served this dish with grilled chicken breasts.

But even with all this criticism, we enjoyed the dish and I would make it again, albeit with the changes I described. Thanks for your offering!

First of all, WAY too much salt! You don't have to add a bunch of salt to each layer, as shown in the video. Most Parmesan cheeses are salty enough. Fresh parsley is a bonus if you have it. Saute the onions after the garlic, parsley and eggplant so they are not overbearing in the final dish. The eggplant can be cut into rounds, laid on a paper towel, slightly salted and covered with another paper towel to remove bitter taste and to reduce moisture. This avoids the ratatouille soup ending.

I made this recipe last night just as it is--after I baked it I drained much of the juice out of the bottom of the casserole.  I then mixed some of it with cooked rice.  Today I mixed more of it with spaghetti.  Very delicious both ways with a little extra parm. cheese sprinkled on top.

This definitely needs more than 45 minutes in the oven. I cooked it for 60 minutes. Some liquid but nothing a slotted spoon couldn't cure. I would add more cheese and maybe some oregano. It was slightly on the bland side but the flavor of the veggies is definitely there. I did not cover it and I made one large layer in a long lasagna dish. Perfect! This is going in the rotation.

This was so good! I used a 9x13 Pyrex casserole dish and it was almost overflowing. Next time I will put the onions in the skillet with the eggplant. My husband likes his onions really soft. I didn't have any tomatoes on hand, so I used canned fire roasted tomatoes and it was delicious.

Its Weber gas grill time.  pre-heat to 400f.  12" cast iron pan with olive oil, 2 Tbsp salt free butter onions and mushrooms in pan until the onions start to brown stir in remainder of ingredients.  when soft, salt melt cheese over the top and serve.

Variations are numerous.(1) add a cup of chicken stock before the cheese.  (2) add cooked noodles)(3)stir 1/4 cup flour into milk add to dish to thicken. (4)add left-over rotessirechicken (5) you get the idea.  Wonderful grill dish also your air is not trying to cool the oven. Also gets the guy out of the house lol

I make it in a large sauce pan.  If you dust the eggplant and zucchini in flour and then brown them, the results are slightly thicker sauce. I do not layer but add tomatoes cut in wedges last. I also brown hot Italian sausage and add it to the vegetable mixture. Makes a great main dish!

This was OUTSTANDING! I did a very small amount of tweaking - added some Italian blend spices to the eggplant while it was sauteing and because I really like garlic, I doubled the garlic. One other thing I can recommend is to not cheap-out on the Parmesan cheese - get a good quality cheese & use a decent amount between layers. I thought the salt between each layer was going to be too much, but it wasn't, just use sparingly between the layers. Finally the 45 minutes is about perfect at 350. The vegetables are not mushy, but done. At the end I turned on hi-broil for a minute or two to kind of toast the top layer of Parmesan. Incredibly tasty dish and healthy to boot. Thank you Lynette Marie for posting this!

This is a little difficult to review. only changes I made was to add some fresh thyme and rosemary when I added the parsley. I served it as a main dish with some crusty bread.  It tasted really good and my 3 year old ate it without a fight (which is a HUGE feat).  I really liked the eggplant too and I am NOT a big fan of eggplant usually.  I am looking forward to making it again.  only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because it didn't really stand alone and its a lot of work for just a side dish.  we ate the leftovers over pasta and marinara and that gave it a bit more substance.  Its too much work to be a "go to" week day meal BUT I have most of the ingredients growing in my garden so I do plan on making this often this summer :)

We had this last week and it was a hit!  I added a drained can of garbanzo beans, about 1 teaspoon of basil and a teaspoon of oregano plus a splash of white wine. I'm making it again this week. Yum!

This is a great base recipe for ratatouille.  I did saute the onions and mushrooms along with the eggplant.  I used an herb flavored olive oil which went along well with the flavors of the vegetables.  I also did not layer the vegetables.  I seasoned everything with salt and pepper, stirred in the cheese, and placed the mixture in a baking dish.  I will be making this again, thanks for the recipe.

This was delicious! We cut our vegetables in slices and layered them. We browned our onions. Baked covered for about 20 minutes, then uncovered for about 40 minutes. Will make again!

Minor add of some Lawry's Basil, Citrus, and Garlic Rub for seasoning and about a cup of shredded mozzarella for binding and this was amazing.  It was very good as listed above but the small adds sent it over the top.  Leftovers were even cleaned out.   Fair warning.  This makes a FULL casserole dish of veggies.

This was really good. I did saute the onions as recommended by others, and added some dried basil and oregano. Then I simplified baking by throwing all the ingredients into the dish and mixing them up before simply putting the cheese on top. I brought this to a potluck as a side dish and nothing was left by the end. Thanks!

Honestly I went into this recipe not knowing what to expect, I just happened to have the garden fresh vegetables on hand and this took most of what types I had.  I loved this, I would give it 5 stars other than not everyone in the family shared the same opinion.  I don't like mushrooms or tomatoes usually but they were good in this...I will definitely make this again when I have the vegetables on hand.  I made it as it was written other than I used fresh parsley instead of dried.

This is a great recipe. I took advice from others and served it over rice. Also, it is a very good idea to saute the onion a little before layering, otherwise it will be crunchy. I was out of parsley when I made this, so added a bit of thyme and basil and it really was wonderful. Love this recipe to use up fresh veggies from the garden!

I made this using finely chopped fresh parsley as opposed to dried. Also for the mushrooms, I used a giant wild oyster mushroom that I had found in the woods the previous day. I rinsed it off to remove the dirt/debris, and cut it up in to cubes. Any kind of mushroom would do, but I bet it would be amazing with spring Morels or summer Chanterelles (which should be coming up in my area any day now!)

I am on a health kick and this recipe really proved not only healthy, but delicious!  To avoid mushy eggplant, I wouldn't saute the eggplant for 10 minutes.  I would recommend cooking the eggplant for about 7 minutes.  The eggplant will soften more in the oven while baking.  I did have to use quite a bit of salt, but it came out perfectly.  This recipe was economical, healthy, and delicious, easily giving this recipe 5 stars!

used salt to draw out moisture in eggplant before sweating it in the pan along with the onions and garlic and some evoo. used a mandolin for the zucchini and added basil to each part of it...skipped the bell pepper and skipped the mushrooms...when it started to brown on the top too much i put a foil tent over it and let more of the liquid evaporate. delicious!

Loved all the vegetables & the fact that fine slicing & dicing wasn't required. I thought the simplicity was really nice & flavorful, but David thought it was too plain. He thought it needed some sauce, so next time, we'll have with some Exquisite Pizza Sauce (also from this site).

The smell of this cooking should be bottled! I was looking for a recipe that would use eggplant, zucchini and herbs (basil and parsley) from our garden. The first couple of times that I made it, I split it into two small casseroles that didn't have lids, so I covered them with foil and they were not too dry or watery. When I made it in a large casserole with a lid, it came out with a lot of liquid that I spooned off and reduced in a separate pan before adding it back. Loosely covered seems to work best. Had Romano cheese so I used that and didn't add much salt because the cheese is salty enough. Had it with pizza a couple of times and another time with brown rice.

It was okay. I love vegatables but it was so-so. My boyfriend actually ate it and he is not so much of a veggie person. I did not use the eggplant but instead substituted squash. Used more cheese too. Probably won't make this again unless it's a small side dish.

Was pleasantly surprised by this recipe.  Because there is no added liquid I was unsure if the veggies would be dry, but it was surprisingly juicy with lots of flavor!

I serve side by side with pasta dishes to get some veggie goodness in. Great for when you first go grocery shopping and have a ton of veggies to use up, as you can substitute or omit where needed. Personally, I liked the "juicyness" of it over noodles and found it dried up a bit more as leftover. I can make a big batch for myself to last a week as an easy dinner and lunch dish or side dish.

I made a few changes but really loved this recipe.  I sauteed all the veggies together for about 10 minutes then put them in a cassarole dish, I didn't bother to layer them.  I also used canned tomatoes and added chicken sausage to it and all my step kids loved it.  Really easy and simple to make.  This one's a keeper!!!

It is so packed with flavor!  My husband and I love it.....it's taking the kids a little longer to appreciate.  I haven't used the parsley, but I like it just the way it is.  It's delishous.

I love this recipe. I have made it several times now. I usually include a summer squash in place of one of the zucchinis to mix it up, and I use red bell pepper instead of green because of personal preference. I use mozzarella cheese sometimes too in place of parmesan. Delicious!

Great way to use the fresh produce of summer. I didn't have time to let it bake for 45 minutes and since I had to cook the eggplant on the stovetop anyway, I sauteed each layer with fresh garden herbs and then layered it in the casserole dish and baked it at 425 for 20 minutes. I sprinkled goat cheese on my serving. Delish!

I'm sure the original recipe would be fantastic, especially if you sautee the mushrooms with the eggplant first to evaporate some of the liquid in them. However, I have so far made ratatouille twice with great success using the following alterations to this recipe:   [1] Omitted mushrooms.  [2] Assorted summer squash instead of zucchini.  [3] Drizzled about 1/4 cup olive oil over the top before baking.  [4] Based vegetable proportions on what the garden could provide.  [5] Freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese instead of Parmesan.   Also, the first time I baked it for 0:45@350º then 0:30@425 and it turned out fine; the second time I baked it for 0:50@350º, but sliced the onions (top layer) extra thin so they'd cook faster, and it was also good.

This was an absolutely fantastic recipe!  The only ingredient I omitted was the bell pepper, not a fan.  I also added some fresh rosemary to the top and it was delicious!  It is the perfect way to use up all of those summer veggies coming in from your garden, just make sure to have some crusty bread on hand to sop up those wonderful juices!

I liked this, but skimped on the cheese and then wished afterwards I hadn't because that was what gave it all the flavor.  Otherwise simple and delicious

A great healthy recipe. I followed exactly, except I added a little lemon juice to the eggplant after I cooked it, and a little red wine drizzled over top. Also, I used cherry tomatoes sliced in half, since it's what I had on hand. I used a combination of fresh parmesan and the grated kind to stretch that expensive cheese. I was generous with it, though. Served it with a crusty french bread and cleared out our farmer's market inventory from the previous weekend. I would definitely recommend it as a way to use those summer veggies.

I let everything simmer in a beef broth to give it a little more meaty flavor & served over rice. Pretty good & very good for you.

I made this for my DH and 7 kids tonight, it turned out great! I did change the dried parsley for fresh and threw in a hand full of a mix of fresh herbs, all Italian. I also left out the bell pepper because I didn't have one. Served it with some grilled chicken that had olive oil and fresh herbs on it as well. A great dinner I will make again!!!

This recipe will surprise you if you've never had Ratatouille.  When you look at the ingredients (at least when I did) you may fear there will be little flavor.  Boy was I wrong!  I really was shocked by the amount of hearty flavor these simple ingredients provided!  I know many people eat other things and use this as a side dish, but I make my whole meal out of just this...maybe a piece of bread as a bonus.  This has become a real staple meal in my household....THANKS FOR SHARING!!!

LOVED this! I didn't notice any mention of sweating the eggplant, so I went ahead and did that- just in case! I sauteed the onion and eggplant together and it added great flavor.

I made a few adjustments based on what others said, but this was the most amazing dish!  My oldest son couldn't believe there wasn't meat in it, and my youngest son finished all of his too.  I'm looking forward to the leftovers.  Some of the changes I made-peeled, cubed & salted eggplant, then rinsed and sprinkled on a pinch of sugar (this step could probably be omitted, but I was afraid the eggplant would be bitter without it).  Cooked the onion along with the garlic in half olive oil, half butter.  Used about 1/4 t. thyme, rosemary, oregano, and about 1/2 t. basil and paprika.  I used 1/2 c. mozzarella along with the Parmesan in each layer; just used 1/2 green pepper but that's because I don't like a lot of it. 1/2 red onion.  Used a can of diced tomato, one cup sliced mushrooms, one small zucchini and one small yellow squash.  Whatever I didn't mention, I followed the original recipe.  I drizzled about 1/4 c. red wine over it all.  Covered and baked one hour.  Uncovered and let cool and refrigerated it, covered.  Later, I took it out for an hour before reheating.  Reheated 350 degrees for about 20 min.  That was to further blend the flavors. Am looking forward to making it again when we have all these vegetables fresh from our garden.

I was in a hurry so I ommitted the zucchini and only only used eggplant.  Also, I used a sprinkle of mozzerella because I didn't have any parmesan.  I also used diced, seasoned, canned tomatoes.  This came out wonderful...the tomato and green pepper and mushroom mix together wonderfully.  I also added black pepper.  I was certain that this would be my own personal treat because my husband wouldn't eat any, but he loved it!

I tried this dish for the first time last night, and my family couldn't get enough. My 11 month old was grabbing pieces off our plates and shoving them into his mouth, all while bouncing up and down in glee. My 3 yr. old loved it, and as a bonus he was able to help me make it by layering the veggies and sprinkling Parmesan cheese.   The only change that I made was to saute the onions w/ the garlic and eggplant, simply because I prefer my onions to be well incorporated. Also, I forgot the pepper. So, I am sure it will be even better next time.

I've made this recipe several times now and I love it. When you tell people you've made ratatouille, their mind goes to two places: 1. isn't that a Disney movie? 2. isn't that really difficult to make? Well, I have to say that this recipe makes it really very easy, even without the help of a rat under your hat. I have a tendency to be more than a little heavy-handed with the parmesan, otherwise I make this recipe exactly as is and love to package it up to take for an easy lunch at work.

It was simply wonderful! Even my husband, not a big fan of veggies, loved it! We also don't like onions, so I simply skipped that layer

Sounds cool when you say you made ratatouille. Easy and delicious, even without the tomatoes. Great with couscous.

Excellent! I left out the mushrooms and bell peppers because I didn't have any on hand, sauteed the onions a bit before adding them to the dish, and only used 1/4 cup of cheese to cut down on some of the fat. Delicious!

Delicious! Added summer squash. Used imported Italian Parmesan. Baked 20 minutes extra because I cut the squash to big. We put it over spaghetti noodles.

This is fantastic.  I cooked the eggplant with the garlic, onion  & parsley  first.  Then layer the rest of the veggies with dried rosemary, basil and thyme.  Used 1 cup white mushrooms and one cup baby portobellos. Asiago cheese is a preference of mine. Small can of seasoned diced tomatoes on top and your're set to go.  Ok alone or over pasta.  Super healthy

Very yummy!  I added some left over pasta sauce (about six ounces) because it seemed like it needed something, and it was the perfect amount just to lightly coat everything but not cover up the great veggie flavor. Will make this again, thanks!

This is delicious!  I have made this for my non-vegetarian family, served as a side dish along with some baked mostaccoli, and they loved it.  Then I made it for my non-vegetarian boyfriend as a main dish over rice and with some french bread, and he ate 2 helpings.  I love this recipe!

This recipe was very good, but you just cannot make it as written.  I used a large eggplant (vs. the smaller Japanese variety), 2 large zucchini & only 1 - 8oz. pkg. of sliced mushrooms, & I needed to use a large, 12-inch frying pan with high sides.  My method was also different: I sauteed all the veggies, adding them one at a time.  To them I added a can of diced tomatoes with the liquid (to help them cook more quickly), a Tbsp. of tomato paste, & a Tbsp. of dried Italian spices.  When the veggies were all softened, I stirred in a container of fresh grated Asagio cheese from the deli section & baked it all in the oven, in the frying pan, for about 15 minutes.  I served it over fresh herbed cheese ravioli from the deli section, with fresh grated Parmesan sprinkled on top.  No casserole dish could have contained this large amount!

this recipe turned out wonderful! i cut my veggies chunky for a nicer visual effect and used a reviewer suggestion of a can of diced tomatoes(w garlic basil oregano)and one large fresh tomato added near the end to keep them from dissolving.  i also cooked on stovetop and for only 30 min to keep some texture to the veggies.  all i added was parsley salt and pepper to taste and what a wonderful fresh vegetable dish it makes! thanks for a keeper!

I took the advice of another cook and made it on the stove top.  Will definitely try it in the oven next time.  I added basil and rosemary.  We all enjoyed it!  Will review again after I make it in the oven!

This almost turned our perfect, except for my eggplant never came out..well.. right. I made it again, and it was perfect! It's now a once a week addition to our meal list! I use cubed butternut and banana squash, sliced yellow squash, sliced, zucchini, julianne onions, 1/4rd tomatoes(or pierced cherry), baby corn, sliced carrots, julianne green-red-orange bell peppers, 1/4rd baby red potatoes, and sliced mushrooms all piled high in a casserole dish and dusted with seasonings and olive oil, then followed all directions here but staying in the oven a whole hour while stiring once-YUM!

This was delicious!! I made this for a family gathering and there were no leftovers. The flavors are so yummy and this recipe is so easy!  The only change I made was to sautee the onions with the eggplant and garlic. I could have eaten that alone! I will be making this dish all the time.

I've never had ratatouille, but this is a great recipe!  The flavor of this dish is like a loaded, delicious veggie pizza without the bread.  All the flavors mix together really well.  I recommend playing with the thickness you slice the veggies- having them all the same thickness will look aesthetic, but I think it's better to slice thinner the items that need to cook through more, like the zucchini, and leaving the tomatoes thicker.  Mine does not come out looking like the default photo at all, but a lot juicer.  In fact, I end up with a couple inches of delicious vegetable juices on the bottom of my dish, but I find it only adds to the flavor when served with the veggies.  Veggie au jus!  I'd imagine it being perfect as a side for a summer barbecue, but I dont' eat meat.  Great as leftovers, filling, but light flavored enough to eat a big mound of it!

AMAZING! My husband loves the movie "Ratatouille" so I decided to make this for him tonight. It did take a little time to get everything prepared (maybe 30 min.) but after that the house began to smell delicious with all the flavors mixing together. I would definitely recommend this recipe!

Did not like this recipe.  Used all garden fresh vegetables, followed recipe exactly, and thought it was bland and flavorless.  Will definitely not make this again.

I never heard of ratatouille let alone tried it but after seeing a movie, had to try it.  Honestly I wasn't expecting much but boy was it good.  And the biggest plus is, it's VERY healthy!  Thank you.

Very good! I made some slight changes, used the eggplant as a part of the layering instead of just having it mixed with the garlic at the bottom. Along with the cheese and salt between the layers, I also added oregano which gives it a more authentic flavour. Guests loved it.

This is an amazing veggie dish! My husband and I both loved it! I did modify it a bit based on other reviewers and personal taste. I did use 1 yellow squash and 1 zucchini , and sauted the onion as suggested. The layers worked out beautifully as well as fresh basil, parsley and oregano. It was baked in 45 minutes but I added another 8 minutes for mozzarella to melt on top. Served it on couscous and couldn't stop eating! Thanks for a great recipe! :)

This has become one of my staples (I don't even have to read the recipe anymore!) and every time I whip it up my friends are seriously impressed (which is funny given how easy and simple it is). I have no problem with the extra liquid, in fact, I think it's delicious when it steeps into whole wheat pasta or quinoa. I even love this recipe cold the next day with some white beans.

Really delicious! Perfect on a cold winter night. The eggplant was the best part! Next time, I will follow the advice of others and saute the onions with the eggplant first. They were a bit on the crunchy side instead of soft like all the other veggies. I didn't cover my casserole dish and loved the veggies and their juices on top of rice.

This was interesting...I had never made Ratatouille before.  I think I went a little overboard with the veggies, I got towards the end of my chopping and the 9x13 was piled pretty high.  I also think that I may have baked this too long.  It was a little on the mushy side too.  It was a lot of chopping, but worth it.

This was so awesome! I cooked it on low in a crockpot for about 6 hours, and added some thyme and ground peppercorns. Juicy, flavorful, and I even got my boyfriend to eat eggplant!

This was a pretty good recipe.  My husband said he really liked it and he's not a big vegetable fan.  It was also pretty easy to make.  We sliced everything except the eggplant and layered it.  Next time I'll slice the egg plant too instead of dicing so everything is the same.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was so good! I used fresh parsley and added a little rosemary and thyme. I also used one zucchini and one squash but stuck to the recipe otherwise. We loved it!

I don't like eggplant so I substituted one butternut squash instead.Didn't have any mushrooms on hand.I used one 28oz can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh.Came out great and not too much liquid, probably because I didn't use the mushrooms. I caramelized the onions on the stove before adding to the rest of the mixture.I think it is important to do this. I did not layer the dish,I just tossed everything into a huge mixing bowl before pouring it into the casserole dish and it came out great. tasted even better the next day. good with wild/brown rice.it would probably be very good even without the parmesan cheese. add lots of seasonings, if you don't have italian then just be generous add:basil,oregano,parsley,thyme,rosemary and lots of fresh garlic. I didn't find it to be bland at all. Next time, I'm going to substitute the squash for sweet potatoes and see how it turns out.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  My kids have been begging me to make this dish ever since they saw the Disney movie Ratatouille.  They didn't like all the veggies in the dish, but were willing to try them all and discovered their were some they actually liked.  I really enjoyed all the flavors and it was nice to have a veggie side dish for a change in place of the heavy starch side dish.  I used parmesan as well as an italian cheese blend and saute'ed the onions and peppers before layering in the casserole.  Really great recipe and I will definitely make it again.

I prepared this last night (Sept 23) and while good I will stay with my own. It was not as flavourful as my standby which is based on store bought (Costco)bruschetta. I strain 3/4 of a 940 gram container but add 2 tbs of the  bruschetta liquid to which I add 1/2 chopped large sweet onion, 1 cup chopped green pepper, 1 medium zucchini chopped into 4th's, 2 small chopped ribs of celery, 1 1/2 cups chopped mini carrots and 6 large chopped mushrooms.  To this I add 2 tsps garlic powder, 1 tsp Montreal chicken spice (or to taste) 1 tsp McCormicks Malabar black pepper (or to taste). I bring the juice to a gentle boil, add all the veg's and spices at once, stir to mix, let simmer uncovered for about 3-5 min's to ensure veg's are hot and still el dente. Just before serving I stir in 1-2 tbs romano cheese and serve. There is a good tasting liquid with this and I often serve the ratatouille over rice. Also a nice accompaniment to spaghettini or over mashed potatoes and a sneaky way to serve veg's to children because it is tasty.

LOVED THIS RECIPE. I USED SQUASH AND NO GREEN PEPPERS. I SUGGEST SLICING THE EGGPLANT INTO NICE FLAT DISCS FOR EASIER LAYERING. THIS IS A KEEPER AND EVEN BETTER THE NEXT DAY!

Excellent Start.  I did adjust because we like our spices.  To shorten bake time, I parboiled eggplant and zuchinni in salted water.  Sauted chopped red onion and green pepper in olive oil, adding chopped garlic at the end.  Tomatoes from the garden aren't quite ripe yet but I had a lot of sundried tomoates in the fridge so I chopped up about six large ones.  Did have fresh basil and oregano and was generous.  I also added in some chopped black olives, paprika, and leftover tomato sauce that was a little spicy with the addition of some red pepper flakes.  Also added splashes of red wine and balsamic as someone suggested.  Stirred it all together in a caserole dish and topped with cheddar/monterey jack shredded cheese and a little bit of bread crumbs.  Covered with tin foil for 1/2 hour at 375.  Absolutely delicious.  Very versitile recipe that you can modify to your tastes.

Excellent dish. Hubby went back for thirds, good thing it is low calorie! :) I paired it up with some brown rice. I also sprinkled basil onto the tomatoes. I will be making this again real soon. Thanks for the recipe.

Great! Very flavorful with the Parm. cheese. I changed around the vegetabels to what was on hand...Eggplant, summer squash, tomato, red and green bell peppers, and red onions. I omited the salt and it turned out fine. I served it over brown rice and even went back for seconds!!

Wonderful flavor...so warming on a cool night!  I doubled the amount of garlic (it could use even more than that after tasting  my finished product).  I also added a few dashes of dried thyme and used 1/4 C fresh chopped parsley instead of dried.  I was afraid it wasn't going to come together right, but in the end the veggies turned out tender but crisp, and all the flavors blended beautifully.  I served it over couscous. Great recipe, and very healty!

This recipe was a great starting place for an amazing dish. I cubed all the vegetables and put them in a big stock pot with some homemade turkey stock and stewed garden tomatoes to give it a little more liquid. I then simmered it for a while until the veggies were nice and tender, then served it over couscous to soak up all the liquid. I also sprinkled some feta cheese over the top instead of parmesan which added even more to the Mediterranean flavor of the dish. Amazing!

This is awsome! Who new vegetables could be so tasty! I followed the recipe and it turned out perfect! I took another users suggestion and added more olive oil when frying the eggplant cause it did soak it up . My husband LOVED it too! This is a keeper!

I love this recipe, and have used it quite a few times.  Instead of eggplant, I have substituted sliced potatoes, which are excellent as well.  You also don't have to cook them beforehand.

This was delicious! We were surprised at how flavorful it was with so little added spices, it was easy to make after all of the prep work of chopping. In the future I might leave out the bell peppers, but that is personal preference, they did add some different texture than the rest of the veggies. The egplant and the mushrooms soaked up a lot of the garlic and parmesian flavor, great over brown rice.

More rich and "meaty" than many veggie things.I sauteed/steamed  all vegies together with minced garlic in oil (about 1 TBS spread over all easily with a little hot water).I drained it,and I made 2 layers in a 9x12 glass dish covering each layer with shreded parmesean cheese. I baked it for around a half hour to melt the cheese and evaporate the liquid.It was great.My husband and son are meat and Potato types and they thought it wasn't that good. I said "at least it's different" and my husband said "Sh-t would be different too".This also referred to the oven baked scallops on this site, by Bragg.I loved those too. Oh well, back to meat and potatoes.Pork roast encrusted with rosemary tonight and mashed potatoes. sigh.

This was great. I used 1/2 the parmesan and replaced the parsley w/ 1/2 tablespoon fresh rosemary. I was out of mushrooms and also out of tomatoes so I replaced them w/ 3 cups of homemade marinara sauce. I also added 1 cup of ricotta in little dollops across the top about halfway through the cooking. I served this over fresh, raw spinach.

This was really really good. I made it in a glass loaf pan (1.5qt) and my husband and I ate half and then froze the other half. I decided not to alter the recipe at all, just to see how it was as written, and I enjoyed it that way. :) A make-again for sure!

This was tasty, but not quite the texture I had expected based on other ratatouilles I'd eaten. I found it was better served at room temperature rather than hot or chilled; and it was a bit runny so I had to drain the juices. Like another reader, I needed more room for the veggies than a 1.5 qt. casserole provided. With a few tweaks, I will definitely make this tasty and nutritious dish again!

I made this for a vegan friend, substituting crushed cracker crumbs for the parmesan cheese.  While I don't care much for eggplant or zucchini, he was very impressed!  (or else just really polite.)

Very good ^_^ although I think the prep time should be corrected. This took way longer than 15 min to prepare but in spite of that, I think my labor paid off. I had to skip out on the cheese since one of my family members is vegan but she (and I) still loved it. Mine was slightly on the liquidy side so I think I'll serve this with rice or bread next time to soak up the liquid as other reviewers have done

YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY!
I skip the eggplant and add about 8 oz of mozzarella and some red pepper flakes because I like it spicy.  I made it for a picnic last weekend, everyone loved it.  My mother-in-law asked for the recipe and was going to share it with others.  I don't layer each individual veggie.  I cut them all up into a big bowl, and stir it up with the cheeses.  Super YUMMY!

We went to see Ratatouille in the movie theatre and I was not familiar with this dish so I looked it up and cooked it up with this recipe.  I loved it.  I served it as a main course and believe it made either a hearty side dish or a light dinner.  Everyone liked it.  Definately to be used during the harvest season.  Vegetables must be fresh.  This was a great recipe and I will make it again as one of my favorite vegetable meals.  Thanks.

This was very good.  I drastically decreased the amount of cheese since I am lactose intollerant.  I put some fresh cheese on the table so my family could add more.  It was still great.  I may in the future try adding some herbs to make up for the loss of cheese flavor.  Will definitly make again.

I found this recipe in May of '07 and this is my 3rd time making it.  It is very delicious and great accompaniment to grilled chicken.  The only changes I make is that I add more mozz and cheddar per layer.  I serve it over any noodles available in the house (usually spaghetti or penni).

This was terrific.  Easy to prepare and tasted delicious. I used sliced portobella mushrooms and they really gave it a hearty texture which we all liked. I served it to some "very vegetarian" friends and they thought it was terrific.  I think when I make it again, I will add some red, yellow and orange peppers as well as green to give it some color.

I sauteed the onion 1st too.  I used a cup of regular mushrooms & 1 large portobello mushroom, which I think adds richness to the taste.  I also have substituted a yellow or orange pepper for more color.  Once I just mixed everything together instead of layering it (like mixing baked ziti instead of layering  lasagna) as I thought it would be a little quicker.  For some reason (I don't know why), it tasted better to me when it was layered than mixed.  I also think it tastes even better the next day as the flavors have a chance to meld together.

I didn't put the parm on every layer just sprinkled some on the top layer. I baked covered for 30 mins and uncovered for about 20 mins. This recipe does make a lot, my daughter had it as a main dish last night and tonight we all had it over pasta with some sausage chopped in for the meat eaters. If I make it again I think I would scale the amounts down. Thanks

My husband and I LOVED this dish. I had to use cheddar cheese instead of parmesan, but it came out very well. Next time I'll leave out the onions -- the flavor didn't mellow enough for my taste-- but we'll be making this again. It's a great way to eat your vegetables!

This was an excellent dish.  Both me and my husband loved it.  Like others, I think it needed to be baked a little longer, will do that the next time I make it.  My husband took the leftovers for lunch the next day.

definitely cook longer than 45 minutes!  I did an hour and it still wasn't done.  This dish was a little better reheated on the skillet, but overall, even with the many improvements suggested by the other reviewers, it's not 4 or even 5 stars.

Sorry to say, I didn't find this recipe to be that great.  I've had ratatouille before that is pretty good, but this recipe didn't quite make the 5 star.  Sorry.

Very good!  I forgot the parsley and garlic since I didn't have eggplant to saute.  Used Asiago and Parmesan cheese, and then put shredded mozzarella on top the last 15 minutes.  I don't think it needs as much salt either (the cheeses have salt), and used pepper and garlic powder on every layer.  Saw the other cooks paprika suggestion late so only put it on the top.  Next time I'll add the parsley in the layers.   Thank you for the recipe.

Excellent recipe!! Good as a main dish or as a side. I followed the recipe exactly except per the advice of others, I fried the onions in the pan with the eggplant and I threw in some Italian seasoning. Definitely making again.

It is impossible to layer eggplant on one level, zucchini in another, and individual layers for mushrooms, peppers (capsicum), tomatoes. so I mixed the last three items together and made one layer.  In addition, I added a bottom layer of marinara sauce and topped it off with another layer of marinara sauce.  
Secondly, 1 1/2 liters is half the size of container it should be.  Thirdly,  I had too many vegetables. 350 degrees minimum.

Followed exactly.  Needed 10 more minutes in oven.  Recipe should call out additional seasonings.  Sort of bland.  Next time I’m going to use different cheese and add some meat.   It’s ok.  Healthy.

I made this almost totally as directed. I steamed the eggplant pieces so they were almost totally cooked before they went in the oven. I didn't saute the garlic and onion and although I used 6 cloves of garlic I couldn't really taste it. The onion never cooked enough (my fault.) At 45 minutes the mushrooms, zucchini and onions were not cooked enough, so I ended up cooking it for another 45. It was incredibly soupy but the broth was fantastic and I enjoyed every spoonful of that. The vegetables not so much. I would use my old recipe and make it on the stovetop or try another new one.

Omitted the peppers simply because I didn’t have any on hand. Otherwise I made it fairly close to the directions with the exception that I add a bit of very coarse sea salt and Italian seasoning for the oregano mostly. 

One thing 8 find is that the upper layers shed moister which settles at the bottom of the casserole dish; coming mostly from the tomato I gather. With the rest of the vegetables moister it forms a bit of greyish liquid which is not appealing. I found that if I add more eggplant to the bottom it seems to soak it up.

A delicious recipe!  I would suggest cutting the onion rings into smaller pieces, same with the peppers.  In my opinion the salting between layers is completely unnecessary, I stopped salting after the first layer. Used a mandolin slicer to get uniform slide for the veggies except mushrooms and peppers. I used fresh grated Parmesan cheese and it added plenty of salt favoring.  I only cooked for 30 minutes, my zucchini was still tender crisp, loved everything about the side.  Tasty and satisfying.  The only thing I added was some Jimmy Dean sage sausage which I browned and crumbled.  Also used a gourmet mushroom pack as no crimini's at my grocery store.  Would definitely make again.  Any veggies can be used to clear out the refrain.

I was amazed that this tasted so good!  I am used to flavoring ratatouille with oregano and basil, but this was so much fresher tasting without those additions!  I am also used to doing it in a big pot (sort of sautéed) on the stovetop, but this was so much easier.  It is true that there are a lot of juices, so be prepared for that. Also, I increased the oven time, and I used less salt than was called for.  Like one of the first reviewers said, I did saute the onion rings before assembling the layers.  And I did not use any mushrooms.

Delicious flavors. The only thing was that the eggplant made the dish very liquidy . I read somewhere if you salt the eggplant and leave it sit for 30 mins, all the moisture will be drawn out and you can drain it first.  I will try that next time.

I didn't have egg plant, so I substituted yellow squash. I also added basil (dried 1 tsp maybe a bit more) as I thought it would complement the tomato and parmesan. Just WOW!!!

This was delicious, but was not cooked through in the 45 minutes specified. I'll use a 9 x 13 pan next time. I sautéed the onion with the eggplant & garlic as another cook recommended, which worked great. Next time I will include the green pepper too. The flavor was outstanding & I will definitely be making it again!

Simple and delicious. I kept my skillet red hot, and scorched each of the veggies just a bit before piling them on.   Splash of white wine. A tangier cheese on top. Also needs more herbs, IMO.

Good and easy. Make sure you use fresh parm, not that stuff in the can on the shelf, get it from the cheese department, it makes a big difference. I haven't had any problem with the onions being crunchy like someone said but there does tend to be a lot of liquid in the bottom. Just pour it off when it's done and there you go!

I haven't tried this exact recipe, BUT I've made a stripped down version of it stove top for decades. In a large pot/dutch oven  on medium high put in a little oil, and add 1 diced potato, 1 chopped onion, 1 chopped green pepper, 1 peeled and diced eggplant, 1 chopped zucchini or calabacitas squash, 4 chopped tomatoes, salt and pepper as desired. Cover and simmer for 1-1 1/2 hours. Stir occasionally, scraping the bottom. Uncover towards the end if you want less liquid (which I prefer), or  you can leave it slushy to go over rice, for example.   It can also be cooked in a slow cooker. It makes A LOT. I usually eat as a generous serving over a slice or two of whole wheat bread (Orowheat 12 Grain). I don't add Parmesan, but i love it with feta on the side. It's a meal in itself.  You could also have it over spaghetti, or mixed into  meatloaf, or whatever you want. However, this sounds like a good variation. I'll have to try it.

Easy and excellent dish.  I subbed a summer squash for one zucchini and also sautéed the onions for 5 min to soften them a little as a couple reviewers suggested.  We really enjoyed this on very much!

It was actually really delicious! I made one pan with all of it, and then another pan with all of the leftover ingredients. I would definitely make it again.

The only modification I made is that  I added one clove of garlic to my eggplant and I used one yellow squash that I needed to use from the fridge. It was great and I'll definitely make this again!

It was great! Next time I will dice the onions instead of leaving them sliced. Just a preference for those who "can't" eat big pieces of onion...for some ridiculous reason. I didn't add as much salt as the recipe calls for as well. Very good though.

I've made other recipes of Ratatouille but this recipe exceeds, by far, all of our expectations!  The salt and parmesan cheese in between the layers made a world of difference!!  If I could, I'd give you 10 stars!!

I’ve made this dish many times over the years. The one thing I always do is,  slice your eggplant, place on double layer of paper towel, generously salt each slice, allow the paper towel to absorbe the liquid, replace paper towel, repeat salt on the reverse side. RInse slices, pat dry. This will take a bit of time but you’re recipe will be moist but not soupie. Give it a try, you won’t be disapointed.....

Amazing Recipe!!! The one thing I changed is that I used fresh  parsley. It added a fresher feel, and complimented it well. The small downfall, a lot of liquid. Be warned.

Oh my! All my teenagers LOVED this. The only changes I made were replacing a red bell pepper for green and cooking for 30 minutes longer because I knew my kids wouldn't like any crunch left in the veggies. Served with egg noodles, it was fabulous! This will become a cool weather staple!

I've never eaten ratatouille before but we love vegetables so thought I'd try it. I read reviews always before preparing for tips. 
We don't care for eggplant so I used butternut squash as one reviewer suggested. I subbed red bell pepper because I like it better and it's colorful.  I used mozzarella cheese instead of Parmesan, personal preference. 
I baked a spaghetti squash while preparing the vegetables. 
This dish was moist and flavorful! I served it over the spaghetti squash ( to keep the vegetable theme going). 
Absolutely delicious! This dish is a keeper!

The potion of veggies didn't work and it didn't fit in the casserole. I would change the quantity of ingredients and add ricotta, small pasta and maybe chopped meat for additional flavor.

I did not change a thing and thought this was absolutely scrumptious.  My husband and most of my kids did as well.  It was like eating a fresh combination pizza without the crust.  I served this with grilled steak and parmesan macaroni.  So good!

Good stuff!  I did add a couple layers of chicken (left over from the night before and shredded) because my husband would hate vegetarian dinner.  I did omit the garlic because my meat-loving husband is also a vampire with a "garlic allergy".  I put this is in the oven at 200 degrees for several hours because it is baby goat season and I had no idea whether or not I'd be home to cook at dinner time.  It turned out very well.

I salted and sweat the eggplant and zucchini for about 30 minutes, then rinsed and dried them before sauteing. The flavors in the dish are amazing and even though it is only vegetables, it tastes very hearty! Served over rice.

These are not vegetables that I gravitate toward. So, imagine my surprise and delight when this easy dish was incredibly delicious and even the kids liked it!

Excellent! Did not know this existed until my son had to make it for grade 9 French.  Now it's a regular for us. Easy to make. He doesn't cook and he made it. Just have to figure out how to reduce the amount of liquid left after cooking.

I increased the garlic to 6 gloves and added shallots for additional flavor. There was a lot of liquid which I drained off before serving. 

It was delicious and enjoyed by all at Thanksgiving.

This is delicious!  We had ratatouille at an Italian friends house and loved it.  I searched for a recipe and decided to try this one.  So glad I did.  This is even better than my friends recipe.  The only change I made was to not layer everything, although I'm sure that would look pretty.  Next time I make this I will put my fresh grated Parmesan on top of the baked ratatouille on each serving instead of mixing it in.  Try this, you will love it!

The only change I would make, and I've seen others mention this, is to saute the onion along with the eggplant.  

I also omitted the salt for dietary reasons, and my father, who LOVES salt, said that it wasn't needed....which is very rare.

Fantastic use of late season garden veggies...including the butt end of the baseball bat zucchini. I made it exactly as written and served it over jasmine rice cooked in chicken broth. Mmmm... Only comment is that mine didn't look like the photo at ALL. Photo is a different recipe.

I adjusted the cook time 15 minutes to ensure that the onions and peppers where done. Furthermore, I added a small can of tomato paste to the bottom of the baking dish, and it turned out great. Thanks for the recipe my wife loves it.

I baked this in a deep dish, but next time will try a shallow dish.
Excellent way to use some fresh out of our garden vegetables. It was very popular with dinner guests of all ages.

I love this recipe, so many family members have asked for it after having it at my house. I usually use Italian eggplant and slice it like I would the zucchini,  and cook the onions a bit before putting them in.

I lightly sauteed all the veggies except zucchini and tomatoes, then layered as directed. Also served over a little bowtie pasta. Delicious! I will make again. Passing the recipe on to vendors at our local Farmers Market.

Great, it is a family favorite.
I did use yellow and green zucchini instead of eggplant.  I also sauté the onion with the garlic.

Very much enjoyed this recipe.   Being August,  I didn't want to use the oven and heat up the house,  so I started by sautéing the onion, eggplant and garlic,  then added the rest of the veg and cooked everything stovetop.   Delicious!   I'll definitely try in the oven next time.

Left out the bell pepper because I can't stand it and the mushrooms because I didn't have any, but the zucchini I used were really big so it worked out. My nightshade-using family loves it.

Tasty but I would chop all the veggies not slice them as indicated.  Also I will add more eggplant next time and skip the green pepper.

Outstanding texture and flavor. The only changes I made were fresh parsley since I had it on hand, and I baked it in an ovenproof skillet that I used to sauté the eggplant and onion. I think the mushroom and tomatoes are key to the flavor. The mushroom gives depth, and the tomato gives brightness. The zucchini and eggplant are mostly texture. I served it over couscous, and it was both beautiful and delicious.

This recipe is fantastic! I did add a light layer of bread crumbs with the cheese to soak up the moisture from the veggies and sliced the onion super thin with a mandolin so they would soften up nicely. It turned out perfect!

I've made this again and again and have tweeked it. I no longer cook the eggplant; I just make it the bottom layer and sprinkle with ground garlic (DO NOT salt it because it causes the eggplant to ooze liquid making it a soggy dish). I use dried (sundried) halved tomatoes as a layer after the eggplant. They moisten during cooking but don't water down the dish. I used sweet peppers for added sweetness and color instead of green. I also add fresh basil (or dried) in addition to dried oregano and pepper. I use generous amounts of ground garlic on each layer too. Shaved parmesan instead of grated.

I had never even seen ratatouille before but I loved it!  I roasted all the vegetables first (adds so much flavor) and then cooked it on the stovetop, no layering. I added Parmesan and quinoa when serving. It was even better the next day. Thanks for a terrific recipe.

Delicious and hearty! I swapped out the mushrooms for butternut squash, and cubed my veggies because that's what I prefer. Otherwise kept to the recipe. This was very filling and satisfying.

I will make it again. Made with eggplant. Cubed eggplant, sprinkled with salt let set for one hour, rinsed salt off, poured olive oil over eggplant, baked on cookie sheet at 425 degree, keeping eye on it so it don't burn. After the baking process, layered the vegetables, eggplant, parmesan cheese, mushrooms, parm cheese, etc until all vegetables are used, very good.

Oh my gosh...I made this for the first time and it was delicious! I read the reviews and made a few changes based on these.  For one, my last visit to Trader Joe's one of the clerks showed me a squash called 'Delicato' and said he's invented his own recipe for Ratatouille using this squash. He also shared with me his secret ingredient is pesto. I used this recipe as my base and also followed some of the posted suggestions...ie (cover for 30 minutes then remove cover for the last 15 minutes) and sautéing the onions and it was magnificent! Great first experience making Ratatouille!!!

Light, easy, healthy AND Yummy!
Excellent as a side vegetable dish.
I added fresh rosemary instead of parsley and used greek Kefalotiri grated cheese instead of parmesan. (I always use Kefalotiri instead of parmesan its the best cheese) 
I also only had cherry tomatoes on hand which I found added a really nice richer taste.
Definately will be part of my montly recipes list!

I actually made it twice, the first time I couldn't get a picture because it was eaten so quickly!  It gave me something different to do with my bumper crop of summer vegetables.  It's a keeper!

Loved this. The only thing I changed was I used green onions (because that is what I had) and sauteed them with the egg plant as someone else suggested. It would be a good winter dish also if you used canned tomatoes.

I do not think a 1 1/2 qt. casserole dish is big enough for this recipe. I had it in the oven for 45 minutes and it did not seem that the vegetables were soft enough so I took it and put it in a covered pan and cooked it an additional 15 minutes. If I made this again, i would just do it over the stove and not in the oven.

Super delicious. I put the zucchini at the bottom so it can get all the flavor and swiped the mushrooms with ground beef. Served it with basmati rice.

AWESOME!!! I don't just throw around 5 stars, but this is definitely deserving of the 5 stars. The only ting that I did differently was to saute all of the vegetables in a little olive oil before cooking and I used some red bell pepper as well. Served over rice. This heats up VERY well the next day. 2 minutes in microwave then 25 in the oven.

My roommate and I are college kids saving our dimes.  This recipe was delicious and pretty inexpensive. The prep was very easy.  If you cut the eggplant first, you can finish the vegetable chopping while the eggplant cooks.

I sautéed turkey sausage and when nearly done I added the garlic, eggplant, and onion. Added salt, fresh Rosemary, and dried parsley. Replaced green pepper with can of chic peas. Baked 45 min covered and 20 uncovered. Put over quinoa. Delicious!

I LOVE this recipe! It's hard to believe that veggies, parm cheese and salt could create such an incredible flavor. Be sure to leave yourself plenty of time to chop and slice all the vegetables. It definitely takes awhile. The "sauce" at the bottom of the pan is so good! Make sure to spoon it over each plate before serving. Excellent recipe...thanks!

We all thought this was a great dish!  I was almost out of Parmesan cheese, so I put some mozzarella on it after I got it out of the oven.  I think it would be helpful to have approximate cup measurements for the ingredients, as there was no way my interpretation of size of vegetables would fit in a 1 1/2 quart dish.  I served it with white rice and grilled sweet Italian sausage links.  I will definitely be making it again with a little more tomatoes, eggplant, and cheese.

Excellent!  We feel so healthy eating it!  I picked this recipe because I had the veggies from my garden to use: four small eggplant, two zucchini, green peppers, and tomatoes.  Even my spouse that doesn't like veggies loved it... A perfect end to a summer harvest!

This is an excellent dish that is simply, easy and delicious. I have made this numerous times and it's a hit among even the "meat is the main part of dinner" folks. I second another reviewer to pair with couscous.

This recipe is delicious and easy.  The only ingredient I measured was the cheese.  Because recipe listed 1 cup of cheese, I used very little salt.  It turned seasoned just right.

Very yummy but will try adding a tin of chopped tomatoes next time as it was slightly lacking. Also the ratio of veg is a but off so use your common sense. I slow roasted this for almost 2 hours and it was delicious!

Wonderful recipe! Like others here I tweaked a bit. Didn't have parsley or mushrooms & I noticed a lot of people complaining about too much liquid so I pre-cooked everything before layering. Kept forgetting the salt too. I had some shredded mozzarella that needed to be used so I put some between the layers along with the parmesan. Thought it would make enough for 2 meals but I had seconds & hubs kept coming back for more & more & more.
I know it's traditionally a vegetable dish but tonight I thought I'd try it with a layer of cooked ground beef on the bottom to make it a 1 dish meal. We shall see........

This was an excellent recipe. What a great way to use all the summer vegetables! Bought all the vegetables at the local farmer's market.
Only changeI made was to lightly saute the mushrooms to eliminate some of their moisture.
Definitely going to make this again while all the vegetables are available locally!

Made the recipe for a dinner part but had to triple the ingredients.  What I would have liked in the directions was the new cooking time.  As it was I did not cook it long enough so what was cooked was the eggplant but all the other veggies were par cooked.

Best ratatouille recipe that I have made.  I loved having the layers rather than cubes.  I did switch out fresh tomatoes and used canned fire roasted tomatoes instead.  I also added a layer of yellow summer squash.  Delicious!

Yesterday I called my sister-in-law and asked what she had planned for dinner. I told her I planned to make Ratatouille and there would be way to much for us, so come over and get a portion for her dinner as my veggie contribution. Lots of chopping and the baking dish was over full but the results...... well it didn't last long. My sister-in-law picked up her portion and we almost polished off the rest. I made it exactly as written without changes and served with chicken. It was delicious and I got a call asking when I would be making it again. lol I told her SOON. She had never heard of the dish so I told her the Disney story and she is now looking for the movie. Too funny.

When you add meat, it makes this non-ratatouille btw, defeats the pupose so to speak. I think people are confused on the salt. Since the proper way to cook this, is layers, very lightly salt each layer (key lightly) or I have found Mrs Dash every other layer compliments. As with a cooking is balance, so need to have the layers tasting consistantly. Also note, the layering was done because each vegetable has different cook times and the layers closest to the heat, would be the ones that needed more cooking (onion).

Cooked it for the first time tonight, following the recipe exactly with two changes. Ain't no way you can get all that in a 1.5 qt dish, I used a 13x9 which is 3qt dish and it was stacked over the top and I cooked it for a full hour and covered it with foil the last 20 minutes or so.  I will be fixing it again and will be adding different graded cheeses along with the Parmesan. A friend has already suggested adding  a few pieces of Italian sausage. But as it is it's definitely a keeper and will definitely be doing it again!!

Ratatouille was on my daughter's bucket list and we finally made it.  It was a Hit!!! It even tasted better the next day with garlic bread.  A delicious and full satisfying meal.  I omitted the tomatoes and next time I would go less on the grated Parmesan cheese.  Thanks for the recipe

I made this... probably added too much salt, I've had no idea how much to add or what eggplant tastes like. But it's awesome with mashed potatoes. I used whole mushrooms instead of sliced ones. Great, easy to do, just go easy on the salt if you use a lot of cheese.

Surprisingly delicious despite few ingredients. While putting this together I didn't expect it to be good at all; but when it was all done, we were shocked at how good it was. Nice clean flavor and something you feel good eating. I did sautee the onion and garlic and add it to the sauce. I still want to know where Remy finds equally sized squash and eggplant, and what he drizzles on the top of his ratatouille :)

I skipped the eggplant because I didn't have one. As it was, it barely fit in the casserole dish, but it turned out beautifully. A big hit with the family. Delicious. I thinking using really good cheese made a difference, too.

My entire family loved this recipe. No one even mentioned there was no meat. I only made two changes. I omitted the Parmesan because I did not have any, although it sounds delicious. I also made this in a large cast iron skillet and did not cover it while baking. All the veggies were well done and still moist, without any water left at the bottom. This recipe will definitely be made again!

I made this for dinner last night.  I have so many fresh vegetables from my garden I had to use them up. This is the perfect recipe for that. I made this as directed with only one change, and that is I added more spices. Added some oregano and basil along with the parsley. This was delicious! My family of 4 devoured it like it was their job! I had no leftovers.  I'm not kidding. This makes alot and we ate it all. There was about a cup left over and my husband was afraid I would throw it out, so he stuffed himself and ate it. I served this with beer can chicken off the grill and enjoyed every bite of this flavorful dish (with added spices).  My family is already asking for it again!

This was absolutely delicious. I made it in a bigger dish than called for - a round LeCreuset bistro pan and the presentation was gorgeous. Even the very small children at the table enjoyed it!

This dish was a winner!  I was skeptical that my husband would like it and he ate it all up.  I'm always trying to find veggie dishes for my vegetarian step-daughter and her boyfriend and will be serving this up again, for sure!  I followed a couple of suggestions - I sautéed the onions with the eggplant and garlic.  I added paprika, thyme and a splash of red wine.  Layered the rest as the recipe directed and baked for an hour.  Since it was only my husband and I, I divided up and froze a second casserole.  I'm looking forward to seeing how the second one turns out.

Great flavor, very healthy but HOW ON EARTH did anyone fit ALL of these ingredients into what the recipe calls for....a 1 11/2 casserole dish?!  I couldn't use all my veggies because there was way too much.  Not sure if I will make this again.

Good advice Melanie (Booth)!
Haven't tried it yet so wasn't going to star rate it but seems I cannot comment until I do rate it (strange), so I shall give it a 4 star rating (without even having tried it yet!!!) but when I do try it, I shall do it exactly like Melanie suggests.  Sounds delicious!  Thanks for sharing.

Tis was awesome!  Wonderful to take as a vegetable side for pot luck gatherings...
Do not, however, put into a 1 1/2 qt. dish. I ended up using a 9x13 pan.

I thought the recipe as executed a bit salty.  There is a saltiness to parmesan cheese, so I would cut that out next time.  It was too hot to put the oven on, so I also used fry pan.  Will make again.

I like ratatouille, but this recipe is bland and watery.  Since there is no recommendation to salt out the eggplant, I am sure many cooks found this to be quite bitter, as well.

Loved this! Never had ratatouille before, but will have it on the rotation now. I followed the directions except for the mushrooms (we were out), cooked uncovered for 45 mins and had no issues.

Quite tasty! I left the cheese off it though because I'm lactose intolerant and found that it really wasn't very necessary to the dish's consistency or flavor. I also paired it with chicken which rounded it out and made it a meal.

I really enjoyed this recipe. The whole time it was cooking it smelled like a veggie pizza in my house which was a great bonus! There were mixed reviews about layering or not and I horizontally layered just to be sure you got a bit of everything in every serving. Very tasty! Not really enough sustenance for a full meal though, used it as a side dish.

I finally had the time to make this dish and my boyfriend and I loved it.  The only thing I would change next time is to take out the onion and add yellow squash. I am not sure how that affects the integrity of the official dish, but we could have done without the onion.

I've made this twice, the first time, following the recipe exactly except using oregano in place of parsley. Absolutely fantastic!! I did use very little Parmesan cheese though, still wonderful. There was a little bit of liquid that was very flavorful at the bottom. I would probably add more tomatoes and eggplant as I loved how they turned out. One of the reviewers was right when they say add more eggplant, since it has the strongest flavor. The second time I made it, I microwaved the eggplant in a bowl of hot salted water instead of sautéing and sprinkled minced garlic and oregano over it after draining. It tasted awful. Will stick to the method stated.

Great, easy, and warms up the kitchen in winter.  I added more garlic and red pepper flakes, and will add a little garam masala next time.

I followed the recipe and it tasted very good. However the directions do not mention the excess water that stacks up in the bottom, it needs time to evaporate.

This is my first attempt at ratatouille, but definitely not my last.  It does require a lot of prep, but I broke it up by cutting up some of the vegies in advance and then pulling it all together the night before.  I came home from work and just had to pop it in the oven for a really tasty dinner.  The blending of the vegies and the cheese was outstanding. My only regret was not having a nice loaf of whole grain bread to sop up the delicious juices. One word of caution.  I ended up cooking this up in a 6 quart casserole, not a 1.5 quart one.  All the better--plenty of leftovers.

I really wanted to like this dish, but something just didn't work for me. We only eat meat a couple of times a week, so I'm always on the lookout for new vegetarian entrees. Perhaps if I made this with the intent of it being a side, I would have been more satisfied with it. I might attempt it again with less eggplant, since as another reviewer pointed out, eggplant is the "star" of this dish, and it tasted too eggplant-y for me.

I don't know what went wrong, but this was disgusting.  Perhaps I should have cook it longer.  There was soup at the bottom.  IF I make it again, I will thoroughly cook all of the veggies separately, and add the tomatoes to the top.

I made this recipe and it was delightful!  My family enjoyed it over a bed of spaghetti. A few things we changed, we used 2+ cups of parmesan and a lasagna dish instead of the 1 1/2quart casserole dish using the same measurements for 4 servings.  Thanks for sharing.

This dish took a while to prepare due to having to prep all the veggies. It smelled VERY delicious as it was cooking and afterwards although, my family and I didn't particularly like this dish. Maybe if it was a side dish or an appetizer, it would have been fine but as a main meal, not so great. Thank you for the recipe though!

Good. Prep time was longer than stated due to the amount of chopping involved. Hubby and I liked it, but my two toddlers did not.

Amazing!  I had never cooked eggplant so I was a bit intimidated.  This recipe is super yum and very easy!  I didn't have parmesan cheese so I substituted with mozzerella.  This is a great side dish, could add meat if you choose, very versatile...will certainly make again!

I give it five stars for versatility, taste, and color. :)  This is a very beautiful dish when prepared, even if some veggies are omitted. (My son isn't big on Eggplant- but I've made it with and without now.)  I actually prefer to make a pie crust bottom, make the recipe, then arrange the slices into the pan 'semi-standing'. (Like in Ratatouille, the movie.) then drizzle the veggie juices over the tops of slices- then top the whole thing with a lattice crust in a stoneware baking dish.  If you make the crust from scratch, some of the dried herbs found in this dish also added to the crust recipe makes for a very fragrant and gourmet taste. :)

kind of bland.  I used about half the salt suggested and it was too salty.  Needs more spices to make it more flavorful.

I don't know, maybe I need to try this again but I wasn't impressed. I cooked it forever and it seemed like it needed cooked longer. It also seemed really bland and dry. I'm sure next when I put my own twist on things it will turn out better.

I make this but saute the veggies separately, use more garlic and no shrooms or cheese, I use red, yellow & green peppers and oregano, thyme, rosemary, basil. I think by sauteing the vegs alone then adding them all together you get a lot more individual flavors that stand out rather then a melting pot. But this was still a quick, easy recipe but I will stick with mine.

This dish came out amazing! I followed the recipe exactly as written and served over brown rice. I may have cooked it slightly longer because I set the oven to auto shut off leaving the dish in the oven during cool down. I think this actually made the flavors meld even better. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was an excellent and savory dish! A perfect recipe for fresh seasonal veggies that are readily available at the local farmer's market - anything could be used really!! Thanks for reminding me how enjoyable cooking is when it's just kept simple!

Delicious and easy. Salt the eggplant cubes in a colander 1 hour before sauteing. Rinse, squeeze, and pat dry. This makes it less bitter and it cooks down better. I served this with homemade french bread and white rice.

MMMMMM! So Good! I can't believe what a hearty, filling dish this is made up only of vegetables. I did saute the onions along with the eggplant and it turned out great. I also added a little fresh rosemary. I think you could take this recipe and mix and match whatever fresh vegetables and herbs you have in your garden and it would turn out great.

Such a tasty dish! I follwed the recipe almost exactly; I didn't have mushrooms so I used up some yellow squash that I did have in place of the mushrooms.  This is one of those dishes were it's all about the flavors in the veggies and letting them shine rather than covering them up with lots of spices/sauces.  I'll be making this again this summer, its a great way to use up the veggies of the season.  Thanks :)

I got my kids and husband to eat vegetables last night!   Left out the eggplant and onion, as I thought I would be pushing my luck with those (added yellow squash). Since I then did not have to saute anything, the dish went together very quickly and the house smelled divine while it was cooking.

I love this! I skipped the baking because I wanted to save energy/time/washing and it turned out great! Whole thing took about 15 minutes to make.

This is SO GOOD!! Be warned, prep time is not 15 min! Between chopping all the veggies and sauteing the eggplant, it took 40 min. I seasoned every layer with Trader Joes 21 Seasoning Salute, and added basil and oregano to the eggplant when sauteing. Used baby bella mushrooms and Parmesan and Romano cheese blend. Did not cover the dish and was perfectly done at 45 min. Absolutely delicious!

Delicious! I had to use a can of diced tomatoes, but it still turned out just wonderful. I did not use any extra salt between the layers of vegetables. Just the cheese. There were NO leftovers. LOL

I was very pleased with this receipe-I didn't add bell peppers and used some of the changes other people suggested, like the mozzerella cheese and was very happy. So good!

Delicious and healthy! The only problems I had were that I felt like the onions were way too crunchy and so I would sautee them for just a little bit before putting them in the casserole. I also felt like the Parmesan was unnecessary and so I omitted it. I served this over mashed potatoes.

Turned out good!I will omit the peppers next time, they were too firm and the other veggies were at the verge of being too soft. Grill season is coming and this will make a nice side dish. Thanks for the recipe!

Great!  I followed the recipe to a 't' with just a few minor exceptions.  I cut all the veggies with my Vidalia Chop Wizard so they were uniform cubes and mixed together instead of layering.  Also, I put the onions in with the eggplant so they could soften.  Next time I will double the cheese and add a little more garlic.  Excellent way to eat veggies I wouldn't normally eat.

This was a big hit with my family!  I like it with more tomato and plenty of salt and parmesan.  I keep trying to cram it into a 9x13 dish, which doesn't work very well, but I never seem to learn.  Maybe now that I'm putting it in writing I'll remember to use a bigger dish next time!

This was delicious! My 2 and 3 year old didn't appreciate it, but I think if I cut everything more uniformly, they'd enjoy it more. I seasoned it every layer with salt and Italian seasoning, and put mozzerella cheese on the top. Excellent. I think next time I will either slice my green peppers thinner or leave them out. Also, I tried it with spaghetti noodles and it tastes better all on its own! Tastiest way to eat eggplant!

This is a very delicious dish! I also sauted the onions before adding them to the baking dish, used red pepper instead of green. It was very flavorful. I will make this again.

While I liked it, the kids and hubby were not fans.  I also think I'd like just the eggplant/tomato/zuchini combo without mushrooms, peppers, and the rest.

I sliced the tomatoes and eggplant and added a little parsley between each layer. I served over bow-tie pasta. My wife does not care for onion and mushroom but she enjoyed this recipe.

My boyfriend and I dressed up as Remy and Linguini, the rat and chef from the movie Ratatouille, for Halloween, and wanted a ratatouille recipe to hand out to people who recognized us. We tested this recipe beforehand and it blew us away! We could not believe how good it was for being "just vegetables." We LOVED it and will definitely make again!

It was not what I was expecting and just tasted to crunchy and did not have enough flavor. It was worth a try but did not go over well in our house.

this was really yummy! and a great way to eat veggies, which is always a double plus. the only changes i made were to lightly sautee all the veggies first in olive oil. i was also concerned about it possibly being too bland, so i added some italian seasoning, paprika, black pepper, and crushed chilli flakes, as well as some mozarella in one of the layers. served over couscous and with the toasted garlic bread recipe from this site. made for a delicious, healthy, elegant meal, husband loved it. it made alot so tonight ill be serving the leftovers over pasta. thanks for sharing, have been wanting to try rataouille ever since i saw the movie a couple of yrs ago!!

I make as is, but mix up the squashes, you really can make it with any.  Excellent flavor, it eats like a meal.  I serve it over rice or pasta and that helps pick up the juice and flavor them.  I saute my zucchini too though, so it gets soft and I know it will be done in time.  Excellent for famer's market veggies in the fall.

I made this with my 6-year-old and we enjoyed it while watching the movie together. He loved being able to help assemble the dish. The prep time is probably closer to 25 minutes. I sauted the onions with the garlic and then sauted the eggplant. I was worried that the rest of the veggies would be too raw tasting, but they came out perfectly. I baked mine for 45 minutes and then took the foil off and left it in the oven for another 15 minutes. I served it over rice to make it more of a meal instead of a sidedish. This is a dish you could make ahead because it tastes even better after sitting a bit.

This was an awesome recipe, I served it over rice.  I sauteed each veggie before layering it in the pan to get a nice browning crisp on them, then I didn't have to bake as long.  I also added some mozzarella before baking.

Yum, yum, yum!  Doubled the veggies and put in a 9 x 13 pan.  Also sauteed onion and garlic with the eggplant.  My boyfriend requests this dish specifically at least once every couple of weeks!

Excellent dish! My husband & kids loved it, and request it all the time. I did take some of the suggestions from the reviews and added yellow squash, white wine, small amount of red pepper flakes for a little spice, rosemary, and thyme; however, I used diced tomatoes, added cut up chucks of chicken breast and served over brown rice. It makes lots of great juices & smells delicious! Humm!

The only thing not mentioned in this recipe was: to cover or not to cover.  I covered.  It was totally delicious, although we used a LOT of salt total with salting each layer of veggies.  Wow!  Cool dish!

I've been making ratatouille like this for years, sometimes adding herbs, sometimes not.  All that chopping  takes probably ten minutes if you know what you're doing!!  I love ratatouille over polenta-----and I'm not even Italian!!!!  Just finished making a huge casserole with the last of the garden veggies.  After tonight's dinner the rest will go into the freezer.  Not as good as fresh-from-the-garden, but better than "imported" veggies.

This is one of our favourites at a local restaurant. We love making this dish.  It is delicious and hearty.  We cut the eggplant and slice it rather than cube it.  We also saute the eggplant and onion along with the garlic.  We add about 1/2 cup or more of crumbled feta cheese or goat's cheese to the layering, since the restaurant does this, and also sprinkle some bread crumbs on top with the parmesan cheese.  We bake it for up to 60 minutes, taking the lid off at the 30 minute mark to evaporate some moisture.  We serve it on couscous.

Another yummy recipe! I have made it two ways, one as written and one with squash instead of eggplant. Very good either way! The eggplant adds a another layer of flavor, but when I don't have time for the extra step, I omit it. I also add pepper with the salt, we like it with a little kick.

I thought this was good. Next time I would serve as a side dish - we were missing some pasta or meat with this dish.  Maybe next time I'll serve with some cheese ravioli.

Although I liked the taste of the dish, I made it exactly as stated and the onions and zucchini were not soft enough for me or my husband. I do want to try it again, although I will soften the onion/zucchini a little before it goes in the dish.

Awesome!  I'm really impressed with how this turned out.  However, I made a couple of modifications.  I topped it off with feta cheese and ground pepper, then drizzled with olive oil.  I think the dish would have been too dry without the drizzle of olive oil.  When I removed it from the oven, I poured everything into a large bowl and tossed to mix all of the flavors.  Also, I might suggest using a larger casserole dish than called for.  I didn't even add mushrooms and my ratatouille almost didn't fit!!

I was not crazy about this - the vegetables were a great combination, and the flavor was good, although a little weak in my opinion, even with the addition of some basil and oregano.  I was expecting it to have more liquid too - maybe I will try again with more olive oil and a splash of wine.  I noticed on some of the other ratatouille recipes that the amount of olive oil was higher - about 1/2 cup. Still a very healthy dish with lots of potential!

Very good! i could not for the life of me fit everything in a 2quart casserole dish. :( so i left off one tomato. BIG MISTAKE! the bites with tomatoes were a billion times more flavorful than the rest. next time, i'll put it in a 9X13 in dish. I served it over pesto pasta (gave it some more flavor) and hubby said we could serve it to guests!....

Great!  I'll admit, I strayed from the recipe.  I added yellow squash and okra and made the whole thing on the stove.  It was great!  I sauteed the onion and garlic until soft, then threw in all the other ingredients.  I covered and let it simmer about 15 min, then cooked uncovered until most of the liquid was evaporated.  Yum!

We have an abundance of squash and my son, because of the movie wanted to make this so I took the basic recipe and included both zucchini and yellow squash along with the eggplant. I sliced them on a mandolin and layered it up like they do in the movie which made a nice presentation. I also followed another reviewer's suggestion and sauteed some turkey sausage and my onions and put that in with the tomato sauce. I have made this with crushed tomatoes that I seasoned up with some Italian seasonings- simpler. Add a salad and crusty bread and you have a complete, simple meal. My 7 & 17-yr-olds both LOVED it and my husband, who is not a big squash or eggplant fan gave this a thumbs up.

Loved this - used rosemary, thyme, yellow peppers and canned diced tomatoes for a fantastic flavor.  I cooked the onions, tomatoes, garlic and rosemary and thyme until soft and then layered per the recipe.  I topped with mozerella.  Fantastic!  Great with Foccacia bread.

What a perfect dinner!  This is easy to make, delicious, and beautiful.  You will impress company with this great dish.  I serve it with cous cous and put a little mozzarella/parm on top and broil for a couple minutes at the end of bake time.  Light, gorgeous veggies, great taste.

This was absolutely delicious! (And I'm not a big vegetable person.) It made much more than I expected, in fact, in order to fit it into my 2-qt casserole dish I had to cut it in half.  I served it as a veggie side dish for a dinner party of 5 and had some left overs. Believe it or not, it was even better reheated a few days later. Very simple to make.

So good. I added some stewed tomatoes and seasoned it pretty well, but it was amazing. I didnt know eggplant could taste so good.

I loved it! It has a similar taste to the "No-cream pasta primavera" from this site, which I also love. My husband ate his serving but wasn't interested in leftovers. My 5 and 3 yr olds loved making it and gave it a try, but in the end, realized they were still vegetables. That's about what I expect out of a veggie recipe, honestly, so I'll probably still make it again!

We loved this recipe! It is very tasty. I followed it exactly except I drizzled a little olive oil on top before baking. I will definitely make this again.

Delicious! Next time I will layer it and add more herbs to season it, then toss the layers and bake it. Great way to get your veggies, and couscous is a great addition. I loved it with herb roasted chicken.

This recipe, even with some doctoring afterward, was fairly bland. I will try this again since it's pretty much veggies and cheese, but I'll add much more Italian seasoning, and possibly cook it all in a pot instead of the oven. Thanks for the recipe.

We really enjoyed this...very tasty and very easy.  My 8 year old helped chop the veggies and it only took 15 minutes to prep. I used red pepper instead of green (didn't have the green pepper) and served with brown rice.  I also sauteed the onions with the eggplant, and baked it an hour instead of 45 minutes, based on other reviews.  My 8 year old loved it (and he doesn't usually like any of the vegetables in the recipe).  Of course, we watch Ratatouille, the movie, while we cooked!

This was a fabulous basic receipe - one that would be good with just about anything you decide to add or leave out.  I added sweet italian sausage and always put red pepper flakes in my olive oil before I saute anything - which gave the egg plant a very nice flavor.  I used plenty of cheese between the layers (ricotta and fresh parm).  We enjoyed it with garlic penne and soaked up the delicious sauce with a fresh baguette.  I froze the leftovers and can't wait to try them on a flatbread pizza!

I don't know what kind of watch the person who estimates "prep time" is using, but this takes a long time to prepare.  Allot at least 45 minutes to an hour for prep.  It's good if you want to put that much time into a side dish...

I don't feel this is a true "main" dish, but it was so good.  Delicious.  Tips: Precook peppers/zucchini, took over an hour to cook it to make them soft enough to enjoy.(unless you prefer them hard). It makes more like 6-8 servings.

Excellent ratatouille! I'd always made mine on the stovetop but this is a nice variation when you need your burners for other dishes. Personally, I prefer to add the parmesan at the table, but either way works.

Great recipe! Instead of using sliced onions, I chopped them and sauteed them in with the garlic. I also substituted 1 oz of fresh cilantro for the parsley. Made this for my roommates with some whole weat cous cous and everyone loved it!

I hate to be the grinch, but we thought this was a little boring.  It's basically baked veggies, no more no less; tasty for what it is, but kind of a long way from what I think of as ratatouille.  I think I was looking for something a little richer, something that was a bit more of a stew.  Might make this again anyway, but I'll probably keep looking.

Used this as a side dish because we love lots of veggies on the side.  I'm not particularly a fan of mushrooms but I did follow the recipe and added them.  Overall, we really liked the dish.  The peppers were so much more crunch than the rest of the veggies so next time I'll leave them out.  It is pretty liquidy at the bottom so don't let them sit too long or they get water logged.  We enjoyed them as leftovers the next day too.

I used a 2.2 qt casserole dish, but it was still full to overflowing.  Overall taste was okay- I did sprinkle the Parm with a heavy head.  Next time I will sautee the garlic & onions & peppers together in a separate pan, and add some other spices- Italian seasoning blend perhaps.

Really tasty. I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but pretty close. I used thyme and basil, which was nice, and these veggies need a fair bit of salt. Easy and fresh - I'll make it again.

This was good.  I would make it as a side dish rather than the main course.  I felt like it was missing some thing.... I can't put my finger on it.  But I almost want to make a light sauce to add to it next time.

This is off the hook.  Maybe next time i make it, i'll combine all the vegetables together, instead of layering them separately.  That way, the taste of tomato would be evenly distributed throughout it.

Really terrific recipe, that tastes delicious. I tried to follow the directions as best I could, the only variations I used  were vegan Parmesan cheese, instead of real Parmesan cheese. Also I used fresh basil instead of dried basil. I put fresh basil into the pan while sauteeing the eggplant and garlic, and then also put a little bit in between the layers of this dish. Additionally, I  used about double the amount of garlic and a little bit extra olive oil.  My kitchen smelled beautiful while it was baking. I think this will be a weekly favorite.

Pretty good.  Needs more flavor, like garlic on more then just the egg plant.  Should have doubled the cheese, and tossed all veggies in olive oil, will do next time, because it was good enough to make again, just not as written.

Delicious recipe! I had 4 teenagers and 3 adults eating this dinner, and everyone loved it! My daughter is a vegetarian, so this was a perfect, healthy and delicious meal for her!

Well I messed up and didn't do this in the oven. I thought I'd cheat and throw it in the slow cooker on low for 8 hours like another reviewer suggested. It tasted just fine. I had two bowls full actually. It sure didn't look appealing though. It looked like a big container of brown mush. I'll definitely make it again, just as written this time.

WOW!!  This stuff is absolutely awesome.  I made this because my daughter loves the Ratatouille movie.  I had never heard of it.  The family loved it.  The recipe makes quite a bit, but the leftovers went quickly the next day.  (and were very good, by the way!)  I also added  one sliced squash, just because I love vegetables.  I also used a lot more parmesan and seasoned it with Season All between layers.  It's tough getting my daughter to eat vegetables, but she ate this.  I served it with grilled shrimp (on the side) and garlic bread.  Excellent meal.  My wife and I agreed it was like eating a restaurant meal.  I'll be making this one again...soon!  Thanks!!

I have never made Ratatouille before, and was very pleased with the way it turned out. My husband (who doesn't necessarily like vegetarian dishes) had seconds and thirds, and my vegetarian friend asked for the recipe. I used a 2 qt casserole dish, and still had veggies left over. Also, I had to use a little more olive oil when sauteing the eggplant because it seemed to just soak it right up. All in all, very pleased with the way it turned out. The veggies were just  the right amount of crisp.

I made this in a stew pot and it made a lot.  I guess it depends on the size of the eggplant.  I did add some chicken broth and white wine and more seasonings.  I really did not care for it, until, I let it sit overnight in the fridge. Seems it mellowed.  I experimented by adding more cheese, and then I really liked the addition of a little sour cream at serving time……….It was really very good.  I will make it again, and next time, perhaps, I will follow the directions.  I’ll bet it is good!  Freezes well!

Wow, even better than I thought it would be!  I made this in the middle of winter and was able to find all the vegetables.  I bet this would be even better with fresh summer veggies! I used a little more cheese than the recipe called for, and yellow squash would be fun. I have a picky family.. I think they tried it because of the movie, but ate it because it was so good!

I made this 2 weekends in a row. Both times I added 1/2 lb. of smoked sausage, as we like meat in our family. It was wonderful.

We were looking for a recipe for our eggplant from the garden, my sister sugested Rataouille.  We found this recipe and LOVED it.  The only thing we had to change was to use two 1 & 1/2 quart casserole dishes (we had too many veggies evidently).  Thank you!!!
