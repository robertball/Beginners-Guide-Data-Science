I have a B&B and made this because I had goat cheese on hand. I added bacon. Everyone loved this quiche!

This was a really good quiche. Easy to make and the flavors worked well together. I'm not sure if I could really notice the nutmeg but I put it in there anyway. Make sure you measure everything accurately. My filling was almost over the crust but it settled nicely after the bake.

Really Good.  I did add 4 strips of crisp crumbled bacon and subbed 1 cup fat free half and half for the cream and milk.  Baking time was much less - 30 minutes.  Covered edge of crust.   I didn't expect it to turn out as good as it did.

This was really tasty! I didn't have any goat cheese so subbed queso fresco. I will definitely make this again!

Really delicious!  I used garlic and herb goat cheese to give it extra zing.

I love the recipe but my crust was almost burnt after baking the filling. Next time I will prebake the crust for less time.

Turned out great exactly as written, and I have a tendency to screw up quiche as well.
