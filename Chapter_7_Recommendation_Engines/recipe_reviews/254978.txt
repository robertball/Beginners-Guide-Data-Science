I was looking for something different to use up all the tomatoes and peppers at our home. This was a simple, tasty dish that my family enjoyed. I added diced zucchini and chopped flat leaf parsley. It was nice as a hot dish, but even better after it had time to cool down and allow the flavour to develop.

Turned out great! I actually added a can of 'Manwich' which added a nice spice (or as I like to call it, 'zing'). A pinch of dried red pepper and chili powder. Then I added some cooked shells to wrap it all up. Good stuff!!!

This was delicious, we ate it as a soup base and then added a can of tomato sauce and kidney beans and made it into chili. Very flavorful excellent as a base or by itself. Was a big hit for entire family.

No changes, fresh tomatoes and peppers from our garden.  Used to make Okra and Tomato Skillet, and Tomato Bacon Gravy from this site.  I recommend both of those recipes, too.

Absolutely delicious! I made these tonight and they were a hit with my family! I did not have celery, so I substituted zucchini instead. I did not have cornstarch, so I used flour instead. I will definitely make these again. Stewed tomatoes have always been a comfort food for me. Now I have this awesome recipe! Thank you!

I did add a bit more oregano and basil then called for, kept everything else the same. Very nice addition to a meal as a side dish or add to fish.

I made this recipe to use up an abundance of tomatoes from my garden. My husband doesn’t like onion or celery in it, so I left it out. I did cook the peppers for a while before adding the tomatoes to soften them up a little quicker.  After it was done and tasting  it, I added a little extra dried basil, and oregano to enhance the tase a little more since I didn’t use onion or celery.  We loved it. Made another batch and froze it. Will definitely keep this recipe for next year.

Use stewed tomatoes cold to top off a bowl of mac and cheese. This works great.
