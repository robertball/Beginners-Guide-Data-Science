2/26/07 - This recipe was excellent with a few modifications! I scale the recipe to 27 servings (2 cans black beans) and use a 16 oz. pkg. frozen corn, cooked. Add 1 Tbls. cumin, 1/4 tsp. garlic powder, 1/8-1/4 c. chopped cilantro and 1/3 c. fresh lime juice with pulp (1-3 limes depending on size.) Make sure you drain all cans before adding to salsa. It tastes best if you let it chill for 2 days. Excellent over rice! 6/20/06 - I have made this three times already. It makes taco salad wonderful! I just can't get enough of it!

I have made a variation of this recipe and everyone loves it! I do not use the canned tomatoes, but instead use 3 tomatoes. I also omit the green pepper, but substitute jalapeno peppers (usually 2 or 3 depending on size, no seeds). I also add 4 capfuls of white balsamic vinegar and the juice of 1/2 lime and 1/2 lemon. I really recommend the fresh cilantro (1/2 cup), it adds so much!

Excellent - thanks so much for sharing!  I've been looking for a guilt free black bean/corn salsa that rivals the one I get at Trader Joe's (their's has fat though).  I admit there was something missing and per usual I tweek these recipes and end up with new favorites.  Anyway, I realized it was vinegar, but I didn't know what kind to use.  My roommate suggested cider vinegar and that did the trick perfectly!  I didn't even bother with the fresh tomato because the Rotel was fine for me.  We munched on this before dinner with baked corn chips.  Homemade pita chips would probably be fine too.  We ate so much I had to make another batch.  The second batch I used the Rotel with lime and cilantro and added chilis separtely.  Impossible to screw up!  I too used the cilantro inside instead of as a garnish.  Also added a dash of salt and pepper.

This is not a spicy salsa, but it has a lot of flavor and it makes a ton.  Make sure to prepare it the night before you serve it and mix in the cilantro leaves.

really really yummy - i wasn't too sure about this recipe, but figured other people might like it - of the four dips & spreads i made for that party this one was the best.  i did change the recipe a bit - instead of canned tomatoes with jalapenos, i used regular canned tomatoes and threw in a real jalapenos, it could have stood two.  and regular corn instead of mexican.

This was easy because everything was in cans.  I've had better, fresher-tasting salsa, but you can't beat the simplicity for a quick bite.

I love black beans but I guess not this many black beans, I found myself wanting more corn at the end.  And there really is no flavor within the recipe. I ended up adding salt, cumin, lime juice, vinegar and a little more salt! A good base but needs some sprucing up.

This is the best basic Black Bean Salsa . Yes, you can add, subtract and modify but just start with this. It's easy to cut down by about 1/3 for just a couple of ppl but go ahead and make the whole recipe.  You can roll it in a torillia with a little grilled chicken for lunch the next day.

Rebeckah -- what a recipe! -- what a hit!
It was extremely tasty and filling!
I added extra cilantro and black beans and processed part of the mix in the food processor so it wasn't as 'crunchy' as the original recipe required.  
Thanks so much for sharing -- this is definately a "do-over"!

This salsa tasted great, but wasn't quite hot enough.  I added a fresh diced jalapeno pepper and lots of extra cilantro.  This made it a definate 5 stars!!!

I followed this recipe practically to a T, but I used "plain" canned corn and one of my 2 cans of diced tomatoes was plain, as well. For starters, refrigerating at least 1 night ahead of time makes a difference! And this makes a TON of salsa.. I brought this to a gathering with 5 adults and we barely put a dent in it. Good thing it makes wonderful, delicious leftovers! Will definitely keep this recipe for future use!

Dont't forget the juice of a full lime, chopped cilantro instead of green onions, cumin and cayenne.  Eat with Baked tostitos scoops or on top of Mrs. Dash Fiesta Lime seasonsed grilled chicken breasts.

I am so tired of making this salsa.  Every time I get together with my family (3 or 4 times a year) I have a request for it.  Don't really mind though since I love it too!!  Follow some of the suggestions but use what I have on hand and always just as good.  I might add 2 black beans and one of another small bean.  Also I mix up the variety of canned tomatoes usually draining juice before adding.  I might use one garlic and olive oil, one with green chiles and one plain it that is what I have.  I like using the canned tomatoes instead of fresh for some reason and always get the petite diced.  Also, always use the shoepeg corn and do add some fresh or dried cilantro mixed right in.  Never have had this turn out bad and is always gobbled up.  Even had a coworker tell me her son wanted this sent to school when the teacher requested they bring in their favorite recipe.

This was easy, and it made a TON of salsa.  My guests seemed to really enjoy it.  I also added the cilantro to the salsa.  It seems especially great for a summer get-together.

I added red jalepeno peppers to make it "hotter."

I work in restaurant, and this salsa is almost as good as the salsa we serve.

Yummy, yummy, yummy!  I modified the recipe slighly - I added only 1 can of tomatoe/chilis and substituted the other can for salsa to add a little extra kick.  I also added a generous tablespoon of chili powder.  It turned out great!

This is delicious and easy.  My husband and I both loved snacking on it and even my 2 year old enjoyed it.  We used a can of black-eyed peas for one of the black beans.  I omitted the cilantro since I didn't have any and I think it was fine, but hopefully next time I'll have it!  This made a healthy snack with plenty to share.

This was good but lacking something. I added vinegar and lime juice per other reviews, however, it needed something more. A spice of some kind. I will make again.

So easy to make.  Last minute needed an appetizer and did not have time to chill prior to serving.  Added fresh lime as one post suggested.  Tasted prior to adding cumin as another post suggested.  Did not feel it needed another layer of flavors.  Has a small kick.  I could not find Mexican Style corn....Used very little cilantro- little bit goes a long way with cilantro.  This is a keeper and I will be making this a lot this summer!

Made this tonight. Didn't stick exactly to the proportions, but kind of eyeballed it. I used 3 cans diced tomato instead of 2 cans and 2 fresh because we didn't have any nice ones at a reasonable price at my store. I also used the stalk and the bulb from the green onion. We're onion freaks. My husband literally cannot stop eating it. I made more than this recipe, and it's more than half gone with just the two of us. Love it! This will become an often used recipe at our house. Thanks!

My family all loved this salsa!  Since tomatoes aren't in season, I used 2 cans of finely chopped tomatoes along with the rotel...turned out perfect!  I'd love to can this in small jars, tie a ribbon around the lid and give as gifts next Christmas!!

Very delicious and healthy recipe.  I used Rotel w/green chiles to give it a little spice and chopped up one bunch of cilantro instead of using it as a garnish.  Next time I will add an extra can of Rotel to balance out the tomatos and beans.  Excellent salsa!

I made this as a dip for a Mexican Mother Day's get together.  The girls liked 
it so much, after appetizers, they brought over to the table used it as a topping
for the chimmychangas!  The best part about it is that it's completely guilt-free
as it contains zero fat or sugar.  I did add garlic salt and mixed in a 1/4 cup of 
cilantro instead of just using it as a garish.  I'd definitely make it again!

Love this!  When I make it, I can't eat that much.  So, I just used a can of each (beans, mexi-corn, and rotel).  I used white onion and load it down the cilantro.  The cilantro makes it, in my opinion.  Makes a great dip but also delicious filler in tacos or burritos.

This was a hit with all of the teens at my son's high school graduation party!  I left out the fresh tomatoes and it was great.  Just used regular diced tomatoes and added a small can of chopped green chilies.  Added at least 1/4 cup chopped cilantro.

Great recipe.  Here are a few tweeks I did:  added some adobo sauce to taste (how much you add depends on how much you like the flavor), and I used frozen corn instead of the canned.

I've made this recipe numerous times.  It does make a ton, so you may want to cut it in half if you aren't having a party!  The only changes I make is that I chop up the cilantro and add it to the mix and I use the cans of black beans with cumin in them.  I eat it with chips, but I think I'm gonna top a taco salad with it for dinner this week.  Thanks for the great recipe!

You always see this for sale in the grocery store. You get like 16oz of it for like $6.00. This is delicious! I wanted to make my own for a long time, but I saw this recipe and just went for it. I added some course ground black pepper and a little salt so that it would be almost a little like a pico de gallo mix with corn and black beans. I added chopped cilantro to the mix and used it as a garnish as well. My friends loved it and I'm sure that anyone else who makes it will too! Excellent recipe! Perfect and refreshing for summer!

This was good but I added suggestions from several other readers.  I only used 3 cans diced tomatoes (they weren't in season yet), 2 cloves crushed garlic, 1 lime, squeezed, 1/2 small chopped onion, 2-3 tablespoons cilantro (we love it!) and cumin and salt to taste.  This definitely needs to sit overnight, but it is such a FRESH salsa - YUM!

An excellent base for salsa but I would add more spice to it next time to liven it up. I loved the fresh taste it had from the fresh tomatoes. I used one can of black beans and one can of tomatoes and pureed them with my hand blender to make it thicker.

This was for a party, which was perfect because it makes lots!  Its highly tweakable.  I skipped the green onions and extra tomatoes.  I added a can of green chiles and used plain cans of chopped tomatoes.  I added lime juice, added the cilantro to the salsa (1/4c), pinch of salt, added cumin and a whole avocado.  It was a big hit.  Next time I would add more avocado and lime juice.  Mine sat in the fridge overnight which I highly recommend.  Very tasty inside fajitas!

Love this salsa!  It is quick to make and is good for you.  I usually add quite a bit to cilantro to this dish as well as about 1 tsp. of cumin.

I've made this a couple of times for parties, and it's always a hit. I spice it up, usually adding fresh minced garlic and salt and ground black pepper.  Last year at a company party I made it, and now this year they've requested it!!!!  Good starter recipe that you can tweak until you get it where you like it.

Good lord this makes enough to feed 100! Unfortunately, it wasn't all that great. The flavor was lacking AND then I added some cilantro, cumin, vinegar, and olive oil. Still just ok. I won't be making this again.

Can't be a faster or more fresh and delicious tasting salsa!  I used 3 cans spicy tomatoes - no fresh.  Added 3/4 juice of a lime and some fresh squeezed garlic (1 to 2 cloves) and fresh chopped cilantro too.  Since I threw it together the day of the party, I simmered all the ingredience for awhile to help speed up the blending of the flavors (except cilantro - I didn't want it to wilt).  This was wonderful to serve with the "scoops" nacho chips.

definitely needs some spices, cumin, salt, pepper, garlic powder and most definitely some fresh lemon and lime juice.  Play around with the amounts to your taste, it's not a picky recipe.

I use 1 can each black beans (rinsed and drained), corn (drained) and tomatoes with green chilis (drained).  I add 1/4 vidalia onion, 1/2 green pepper, and fresh parsley, cilantro and chives.   Added olive oil, vinegar and a healthy dash of goya adobo seasoning...yummy!

MAKE THIS!!!!  Didn't think that I'd like it, but wanted to take a salsa to a potluck.  I tried it and really loved the flavor.  I had to give out the recipe several times.

We loved this salsa.  I scaled the recipe back to 10 servings and it was plenty for our family of 5. The only thing I changed was adding the juice of a lime and some minced garlic.  Not very spicy which is just the way we like it.

yummy!  The only change I made was to add cumin and black pepper.  I also made it the night before I served it.  I honestly think that's the best way to serve it

Its a good starting point for a salsa, and has a great texture to it, but I wasn't impressed with the flavor of the recipe as listed.  I tried lime juice, cumin, chili powder, cayenne, garlic..  you name it.. every flavor I added seemed to disappear. My next attempt may be to roast the tomatoes and perhaps some chipotle peppers & try that...

Great recipe - but needed taste modifications: I added lime juice (1 squeezed lime), chili powder, cumin, black pepper and a dash of cheyenne pepper. I added cilantro straight into the salsa rather than as a garnish. Yum-malicious!

I made this for my daughter's 2nd birthday party and got rave reviews and many requests for the recipe.  I added 2 cloves of garlic, cumin, chopped cilantro, frozen white and yellow corn and green chilies. I chilled it for a day the flavor was absolutely wonderful.  I used it on salads and also grilled chicken.

I have been looking for a salsa recipe like this - so good!

I made a few changes based on other's reviews.  I added fresh juice from one lime and used regular canned corn.  I also used all canned tomatoes (used regular because I don't like it too spicy).  Be careful not to drain your tomatoes too much (I should have reserved a little extra juice).  I'm looking forward to trying this with fresh tomatoes when they are in season.

Great recipe...I may add fresh lime juice next time for change.  Instead of canned corn I used frozen white/yellow corn.  Everyone loved it at the New Year's Eve party.  Makes a lot but you can eat more because it's so healthy.

This recipe as is would only get 4 stars in my book, but with a few modifications it is definitely 5.  I use all canned tomatoes, petite diced with jalapenos. I use shoepeg corn instead of mexican, then add the juice from one lime, salt and cumin. It makes such a huge amount but I have never had any leftovers.  It's always a hit at the party.

I used a can black beans and fresh everything else.  The corn was left over from grilling the night before and tomatoes from my garden. We use this as salsa on our grilled fish tacos. Be sure to chill it as it really brings out the flavor. Yum!

Tasty, delicious, and healthy!  Used regular canned corn because that's what I had and omitted the onions due to personal preference.  This dish pairs well as a side with the Salsa Chicken Burrito Filling recipe also on this site.  Next time, I'll try adding a bit of lime juice and chile powder.

This is great.  I make huge vats of this now.  I add in some garlic, a little olive oil and salt.  We eat it cold, heated up over tortilla chips with cheese melted on it and as a base for making chicken tortilla soup.    And, it is so easy.  That's the best part.

I made a few changes to give it more flavor: used Ro-tel tomatoes with chilis for the canned tomatoes, added a good amount of cilantro directly to the salsa, added some garlic powder (fresh minced garlic would have been better). I let everything marinate overnight and it was delicious with corn chips.

I left out the fresh tomatoes because it seemed like a little too much with the canned-I think next time I'll only use fresh.  Also added jalapenos, 1/4 cup distilled white vinegar and cumin for a little extra flavoring.

This is a little bland when made as-is, but I doctored it up a little bit and it's delicious!  I add fresh garlic, salt, and cumin to taste, and I also chop up a lot of cilantro and mix it in instead of using it as a garnish.  Sometimes I also chop up some jalapeno peppers and mix those in too.  I get asked for the recipe all the time, and I'm told to bring it to work when we have food days.  It's a great snack to have around the house.

I wasn't sure my family would dig it but they did! Used a can of Mexican diced tomatoes (the ones w/ jalapenos) and a 4 oz. can of green chiles. Also, I added 1 TBSP. of fresh cilantro. Cilantro is not meant to be a garnish! Chilling is a must.

Now that I am married I am just learning to cook - and this was such a hit at a recent party!  Everyone was raving about it - not something I am used to!!  The added lime and extra cilantro are definately a key - and when it sat overnight it was even better - we will be using this again and again!!

I used regular canned corn and all regular canned tomatoes...I just add extra seasoning (including garlic and some salt!). Everyone raves and eats it all up! 

I love the leftovers heated up with plain rice....YUMMY!!!

I used 4 Roma Tomatoes, 1/2 diced
red onion, regular corn, 1 squeezed lime, cumin, chili powder, and herb garlic seasoning
with less than 1 T. of minced garlic in oil.  It still needed
something so I added the canned diced tomatoes.  It seemed to need the
juice from the canned tomatoes.

The flavor here is o.k. but a bit flat.  For a dip, it was a bit too chunky.  Something is missing from this recipe, but I can't put my finger on it.  Neither did 
half my guests.

This recipe was good but we like it a little Spicer......I eyeballed it since the original was going to be to much for us. I added 1 can of original rotel for a little kick, chopped cilantro & lime juice. This has so many uses .......we even put it on top of some tilapia with  fried rice...yummmmm!

Okay, this turned out to be absolutely delicious and really easy to make. It is imperative to note that I made a few essential tweaks. First of all, I didn’t use the canned diced tomatoes and chili peppers. I just stuck to fresh tomatoes and diced half a jalapeño instead. I also added both lemon and lime juices. Add salt and pepper to taste. Don’t leave out the cilantro for garnish. This turned out to be fantastic and I will be making this again!

Successful at a superbowl party! After putting it together and tasting it, I added salt, chili powder and cayenne pepper. I would use less beans next time.

Great guilt-free recipe!  I used the Rotel tomatoes with chilis, lime juice fresh squeezed from 2 limes, minced garlic, and added the chopped cilantro in the mix.  It's easy to start eating as you "taste" to get things right.  Letting it sit in the fridge overnight made it even better!

Absolutely delicious!  I have made this at least 10 times.  It is definately a favorite among women.  I leave out the cilantro and scale it down a bit.  It makes a ton.  I have also used a can of regular corn.  It is always a hit and I think it is expected of me to bring it now.  It is so easy to make so that is no problem!

This was very good. Needed to add red onion to replace the green onion, Gave it more flavor. Also added extra cilantro, garlic powder, onion powder, salt & pepper. Lime juice from fresh lime. It was very fresh and light. Very good for canned veggies.  Would make again, for a summer bbq. its nice & light to have.

I love black bean and corn salsa, but I still like the tomatoe part of salsa and a little spice.  This is a great simple recipe, but after several trials I prefer it with only 2 cans of black beans, 3 jalepenos, and half a bunch of green onions.

I have now made this several times, and everyone raves about it!  It makes a ton and can sit out for hours for grazing.  The perfect summer salsa.

I've been making this recipe for a while now and it's always requested at family get-togethers.  We enjoy spice, so I use the extra hot cans of ro-tel and I like to use about 2-3 teapoons of cilantro in the dip for flavor.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a good base but needs a little kick, I added some cumin, minced garlic, chili pepper and lemon. I also used fresh tomatoes since they are in season right now. I love how colorful this dish is it really brightens up a plate.

I used sweet canned corn, left out the fresh tomato, and followed other reviewers’ suggestions to add chopped cilantro into the salsa along with lime juice.  I didn’t care for the cilantro and will leave that out next time, although my inlaws thought it gave the salsa an authentic Mexican taste.  I wish I had known that green onions are scallions – I couldn’t find anything called “green onions,” so I substituted a yellow one, which was a bit too strong…I’ll definitely try scallions next time!  I also might use petite diced tomatoes and add the canned green chilis separately, since the tomato chunks were a little large for my taste.  Overall, this recipe was super easy to prepare and could even be served as a salad if you drain out all the juice.  I’m looking forward to trying it again with a few modifications!

Dynamite stuff and you can't get any easier to make than this. Dump the cans in the bowl, chop up the cilantro and you're out of there! This is a dish for guys to prepare. I put it together on Friday night for a Sunday party and I think it greatly benefits from logging the extra time to let the flavors mingle

This was delicious and popular!  I scaled the recipe back a bit (used 2 cans black beans, one can rotel).  I also used fresh corn that had been cooked briefly.  I dressed with lime juice and salt and pepper.  Even after I added a can of chopped green chilis, it wasn't very spicy, but I was OK with that.  It was very fresh-tasting and light.  I even enjoy it by itself as a salad.  Thanks!

Added in the chopped cilantro as others suggested, it added needed flavor.  I think it may have been bland w/o it.  Added an extra can of tomatoes... used 1 can of extra hot Rotel and 1 can of regular for some kick.  Very good, will make again.

It was good except the vinegar overwhelmed the flavor. It also needed more flavors  we added garlic and onion powders as well as some Mexican flavoring.   Next time reduce the vinegar and still add the flavors.

This is a good base recipe, but a bit bland as written. I really liked the green onions in it.  I cut the recipe in third but still used a whole can of corn. I used fresh tomatoes and a small can of hot green chilies. I added cilantro in with the salsa. It still needed flavor, so I put in some cumin and a good amount of hot sauce. It was excellent by the time I was done with it. DH can't wait for me to make it again.

I took this recipe and enhanced it with some salt, cumin, and chili powder. Also incorporated the cilantro versus using it as a garnish. I had regular corn on hand and used it instead. Turned out perfect for a dip or for burrito bowls

Need to make a few changes next time. We did use cumin as suggested, but don't add the cilantro until ready to serve. Thought letting it sit to add to the flavor made it bitter tasting.

This was tasty and healthy, but I think a lot of the tastiness came from my addition of apple cider vinegar, lime juice, and cumin!

This was ok....it wasn't anything special. I even added spices since it didn't seem to have anything with any flavor. If I make this again I will use LOADS of garlic and some other seasonings to spice this up.

Made per the recipe, minus the cilantro (not a big fan).  Two days later, added V8 and a few drops of hot sauce to the leftovers, simmered it for 30 minutes and had a delicious fresh tasting soup that I served with tortilla chips on the side.

Beautiful blend of colors and flavors!   I didn't follow the recipe because I didn't have canned beans or corn on hand instead I used left over black beans that I bought dry and cooked, and I used frozen corn that I cooked and cooled. I also had left over cilantro that I chopped very finely (stems & all)and mixed it right in with the canned tomatoes. No seasonings needed! Can't wait to make it again for friends/family :)

This is a great recipe!  Even my picky husband enjoyed this salsa.  I have been looking for a black bean recipe and this one was the perfect find.  I did make a few changes by using fresh corn from our garden (boiled and cut off the cob), lots of fresh cilantro, 3 cloves fresh garlic and a splash of red wine vinegar.  This will be a new staple in this house!  Thanks for sharing!

I’ve been making this salsa for several years now and it’s always a big hit.  The nice thing about this recipe is that it’s quick and easy.  I make it often on camping trips, and with the exception of the green onions and cilantro, you can keep the ingredients in your food box at all times.  Onions and cilantro are standard items for me as well, but if you didn’t have the cilantro with you I think it would still be fine.  After all, who doesn’t at least have onions with them when they go camping?

I really loved this recipe!! It was fresh tasting and light. The only thing that I might say that I didn't like, was the extra juice at the bottom of the bowl. I guess that happens when using fresh tomatoes.  I will make again, and maybe add different beans instead of just black.

I've tried several black bean salsa recipes, and this one was good. However, I think it needs some spices added, maybe cumin and some salt?

This is a great black bean salsa.  Very flavorful and easy to make.  I always add an extra can of corn.  This is a good side dish if you are watching your calories.  I just eat it with a fork as a salad.  My sister and friend have put it in omlets and mixed in wiht pasta.

Made a few times now.  Used frozen corn rather than canned, fresh tomatoes, lots of cilantro and added cumin, and crushed peppers along with some green tabasco. Also added some lime juice. Husband loved it. Very fresh tasting with the fresh ing but does need to sit a couple of hours for the flavours to mingle

I found this to be a little bland but will probably follow some of the other suggestions to "doctor" it up and give it another chance. I plan to add some cheese and make wraps out of my leftovers.

This recipe was a hit!  The beans and corn really set it apart.  I used the mild tomatoes with chilis, but I would recommend using the medium instead.  This would be perfect with a bit more heat.
Great recipe!

Really good! I used a lot of garlic and cilantro because I love the flavor and it gives an "authentic" taste. I also used lime because it helps me cut back on the salt. I use regular corn and caned diced tomatoes with onion. I warmed both, separately, with a little Adobo for the corn and SAZÓN for the tomatoes, just to get rid of the can taste.

I made this for our food day - OMG - it rocks.  Although I changed it up.  I did 2 cans of petite tomatoes with zesty jalapeno instead of regular tomatos.  I did add cilantro, salt, and lime juice.

Was told I did not make enough.....

Excellent dip!  I've made this numerous times when hosting cookouts and it is the hit of the party!  It makes quite a bit and I'm always able to send a to-go container home with my guests.

This was good but not quite spicy enough for us. Great source of protein. I usually just use all canned tomatoes, unless tomatoes are in season. The petite diced work well.

This recipe was great!! I prepared it exactly as was stated but served it with celery and whole grain crackers instead of chips for a healthy twist. The recipe made a whole lot more than I thought, but the leftovers are welcome!!!

Wonderful recipe! Thanks so much. I served it with Tostitos corn chips (with lime) and grilled chicken. 
Also, I did not have tomatoes with chile peppers, so I just regular diced tomatoes and added chopped jalapenos to taste.
