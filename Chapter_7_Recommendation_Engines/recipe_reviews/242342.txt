Simple and delicious! I used chicken tenders, so they were cooked in about 4 hours on low. Also, I did opt to use the whole packet of taco seasoning b/c I didn't want to keep the little bit that was left in the packet. After shredding, I poured some of the liquid over to keep it moist. This was very flavorful. We used this to make lettuce 'tacos', and topped them w/ red onion, tomatoes, shredded cheddar and a bit of sour cream. The whole family LOVED this...definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Fiesta Slow-Cooker Shredded Chicken Tacos Haiku: "Mine shredded at 5, left the chicken there on 'warm' up til dinnertime." The chicken breasts I used were smaller, so maybe that's why they were done more quickly than the recipe suggested, but a quick fork-jab at 5 hrs and they fell apart, so I shredded them and put them back in the slow-cooker w/ the taco seasoning/chick broth "juice" on warm setting until we served them w/ your typical taco toppings. Thank goodness for a nice variety of garnishes to liven up the flavor, b/c the 3 TB of taco seasoning really didn't make the chicken all that flavorful. But the prep was such a snap that this recipe certainly deserves stars for ease; it just needs a flavor-bump.

Yummy! Like the others said, I used a whole package of taco seasoning. Also added red and green bell peppers, red onions and tomatoes with the chicken. Added two cups of broth instead of one. I went to the gym and left it at the crockpot on high for two hours. Just perfect! I had some leftovers so I used it as toppings to my salad with ranch dressing! And its good!!

In reading previous reviews I added some extra spices for flavor, but was most interested in this recipe for the texture of the chicken (can get chewy in crock pot) and ease of preparation.  It completely hit the mark on both.  Everyone in my house, including 3 picky kids, loved this chicken.  I will be using it from now on instead of ground beef for tacos, nachos, burritos, since it is so much healthier.

I added a whole packet of low sodium taco seasoning plus a packet of ranch dressing seasoning and a jar of salsa. I also used a hand mixer on low speed to shred the chicken in the crock pot. Turned out great. Super easy.

I figured this would not be spicy enough for us Soooo this is what I did. 1 can of chicken broth, 1 can of tomato sauce,1 package of taco seasoning, 1 jalapeño chopped fine, a few dashes of tabasco, 1 can of green chili's  and 4 large chicken breasts. Crock pot on high 4 hours. Chicken was already falling apart. Shredded and returned to the small amount of liquid left and placed on warm. Served with Pico de gallo, avacado on corn tortillas. Tasty. None left over.

This is an awesome meal anytime, but especially great in the summer when you want to be outside, and not spend time cooking. I cooked mine on high for only 3 hours, took chicken out, shredded it and returned to cooker. I then added 1/2 cup of salsa and stirred together, and let it sit on warm for about 1 hour. 
I used a homemade taco seasoning from this site, as well as 1 tablespoon of ground coriander, and 3 cloves of garlic to amp up the flavor a bit. 
Very customizable as everyone can top with their favourite toppings, and child friendly :)

We love this recipe! So easy and convenient.  I used my own taco seasoning recipe, being generous with the seasoning. I cooked on high for 3 hours, shredded and returned chicken to the seasoned broth on warm, then devoured half an hour later. The chicken was juicy and delicious! The leftovers were lunch the following day--still amazing!

I have made this recipe numerous times because it is a family favorite and way too easy to be so good.  I have two helpful hints.  One, use Chicken Taco Seasoning.  Penney’s is my favorite.  Two, I use my hand mixer on low to shred the chicken in the crockpot with the juices.   Perfect every time.

This was SO easy and tasted great with only 3 ingredients!!! I had 3 large chicken breasts (little over 2 lbs) I halved before putting in crockpot, mixed the 2 cups of broth and the full packet of taco seasoning before pouring over them. Left it on low all day while I worked and it literally fell apart when I tried to pull it out to shred. AMAZING!

We will definitely make this again!  My husband and I loved it.  We used 4-1/2 pounds of bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, and slow-cooked it for 8 hours on low.  We followed other reviewers' suggestions and added 1 can of green chilies and tomatoes plus 1 chopped red bell pepper at the beginning.  Also, we used 2 cups of chicken broth and 6 (six!) TBSP taco seasoning.  We followed other reviewers' suggestions and added 1 packet of classic ranch dressing.  At the end of the 8 hours, we removed the thighs, took out the bones and the skin, returned the chicken to the crockpot, and shredded it inside the crockpot.  At that point, we added 1 can each of black beans and corn (both rinsed and drained), PLUS 2 cups of Costco's "Organic Jack's Cantina Salsa".  We then turned the crockpot on high and cooked it for an additional 45 minutes (the salsa was the refrigerated kind, so we wanted to warm it up).  Using skin-on, bone-in thighs is economical and gives more flavor.  We'll be freezing some of this, if there's any left!

My husband says I have perfected chicken for tacos (using this recipe)! I've made it quite a few times trying the original recipe, using taco seasoning from the store, using fiesta ranch and combining taco and ranch seasoning.  I definitely like it best when you use a packet of Hidden Valley ranch and a packet of Lawry's Taco seasoning. I have a large slow cooker, so I can add an entire bag of frozen chicken breasts

This was a hit with my picky-eater 6 year old! Right before I shredded the chicken, I took out most of the broth and added a little more taco seasoning once it was shredded. It helped give it more flavor (since people mentioned it didn't have enough)! I added corn to the shredded chicken near the end. I used a homemade recipe for taco seasoning as well, so I felt it had plenty of flavor!

I added a can of diced green chilies for every pound of chicken and also added more taco seasoning and lime juice. Excellent recipe and will definitely be making it again. Easy for a large crowd

I have made this recipe 4 times now. To start I made my own taco seasoning (the recipe you find in this website). The first time i didn't like it too much and then I made some changes. First was the  chicken broth, i put just a little and it's much better. When you use a slow cooker, food doesn't use much water, if you put the cup of chicken broth, it's almost a soup what you end with. I also put olive oil and used boneless chicken  thighs and it turns juicy and soft .

Will not make this again using this recipe. The flavor was completely off. For me it ended up tasting like roast beef for some reason. In addition to that, the flavor was super bland. Would not recommend using this recipe. Try finding one that has a better seasoning combo or something like that.

This is very bland if you follow the recipe as stated. Three stars for ease and the tenderness of the chicken. Next time, I will add more spices, onions, peppers, and maybe some salsa.

I followed the exact recipe and was very pleased! Such an easy recipe. Let it cook for 6 hours on low and the chicken was so tender, it was falling apart before I even shredded it. Used low carb tortillas, beans, shredded cheese, lettuce, cilantro, and Valentino hot sauce to top it off! Would make this again

This is the tastiest chicken I've had in a long time.  I didn't have the package of taco seasoning so I made some using a recipe from this site. Awesome, I waiting for my (adult) sons to try it today.

A little bland as written, but an excellent base. I made a few changes:
Added onion, red and green peppers, salsa and about 2 tsp of ground cumin. Cooked on high for about 4 hrs. Shredded chicken and put back in crock pot to keep warm until dinner.

TuRned out really good. Very flavorful. I served it on romaine lettuce leaves topped it with chopped onion, cilantro , chopped tomato and a dollop of Greek yogurt (in place of sour cream).  Everyone likes it.  Definitely a keeper  but next time I will double the recipe ??

My husband and I love this recipe, and it's so easy! We do substitute packet seasoning with a homemade one and I tend to add extra broth. Today I'm going to add some lime juice to it for extra flavor

Keeping in mind that it's the quality of ingredients which determines how good your outcome will be, with only three ingredients, this recipe is still a winner with quality ingredients. We used whole wheat tortillas for a healthy, delicious supper. This recipe could be used for nachos and a variety of other healthy and unhealthy choices.

Do not make this recipe! It has no flavor. I like a lot of flavor in mixed chicken/beef/seafood, whatever you can think of. For one, DO NOT USE TACO SEASONING UNLESS YOU HAVE TO! Taco seasoning is super salty and you have no control over the flavors. Use cumin instead! It has that “taco” flavor without being salty or confusing. Also, I would recommend using some canned chipotle sauce or adobo sauce (whole peppers preferred!). If you can’t find any of those, then some jalapeños and red chilies would do just as well (about 2-3 jalapeños and 2-3 finely chopped chilies or more depending on your spice preference). Aside from that, I would say some rich chicken broth (low salt), chopped onions, fresh garlic (finely chopped or grated), and some fresh cilantro (right as you’re serving). You can also add tomato paste at the beginning if you want a richer taste! Put those bad bois on some tortillas or a pizza and enjoy!

Super easy and quite delicious ! I made few changes. I used chicken tenders which needed only 4 hours on low to be fork tender. I made with Taco seasoning I, from this site which made about the 3 Tablespoons called for. I added 1 clove of garlic chopped. Also I didn't want the chicken taco filling to be too watery , so I went ahead and used only 1/2 cup of chicken broth and with the water released by the chicken, there was plenty of cooking liquid to make the chicken filling moist..( actually, it was still too watery for me, and I might just skip the broth next time). Finally I added some chopped cilantro and a squeeze of lime  just before serving, in tortillas with guacamole, sour cream and shredded cheese.

I used my Insrant Pot to cook this for 30
Minutes and it came out perfectly cooked, tender and easy to  shred. I sautéed 1/2 an onion first with a teaspoon of olive oil and then put the chicken breasts and while Packet of taco seasoning. Very tasty.

I've made this 3 times now & it's amazingly easy & delicious every time! I always use around 2lbs of chicken, the whole packet of seasoning, 2 cups of broth, plus a jar of Chi-Chi's salsa to bump up the flavor.. cook it 4 hours on high, then add it to tortilla shells with cheese & sour cream.. it's a hit, even with my toddler & kiddos

I wasn’t measuring the broth but I probably used 1/2-1 cup more than the recipe called for.  I also added another tablespoon of spices.  After 4 hrs on low, I added lots of thinly sliced peppers and red onion.  At 5 hrs, I shredded the chicken and changed the temp to warm until we were ready to eat.  Very good!

This recipe was quick and easy. I added some additional seasoning to the chicken, based on previous reviews. I added salt, pepper, chili powder, and garlic. Cooked on high for about 4 hours using thawed chicken and it turned out perfect.  I love anytime I can use my crockpot and this was a terrific way!

This was better than I imagined! I doubled the recipe and started cooking Saturday night. Because I didn't want to reheat it, I left it on low until after early church on Sunday. I used low-carb tortillas for my husband. First on the tortilla, I put a stripe of guacamole, then the chicken, next black beans, sauteed garlic onion and peppers, fresh shredded cheddar, some jalapenos, and lastly a dollop of sour cream. AMAZING!

I made this recipe the other day. Didn't have chicken breast, so I used boneless skinless thighs. I used most of the taco packet. I was going to make my own taco seasoning but didn't have all the ingredients so just used what was on hand. I eyeballed the broth, I think I might have used chicken stock can't remember. It came out really good and flavorful, my boyfriend loved it. Will definitely add this to the recipes I will make often.

Being diabetic, I am always looking for meals that have limited carbs.  This one is a winner!  It is so easy,it's hard to believe it tastes as good as it does.  
I used a whole packet of low sodium taco seasoning and a whole can of low sodium chicken broth.  Used romaine lettuce, bottled salsa, vadalia onions and low fat sour cream.  Served with some roast brussel sprouts because I felt we needed something more.  Excellent!  Thanks for sharing recipes.

Super easy. I used 1.5 lbs chicken, used 1/2 cup chicken broth, made my own taco seasoning with the recipe on AllRecipes.  I added a can of the Rotelle diced tomatoes mostly drained of the liquid. Cooked on low 1 hour then high for 2 hours. Shredded the chicken and stirred it up and kept on warm for about an hour. Came out great. A little watery when eating the taco, but not a problem. Very easy and very good. Had leftovers. Will serve on salad tonight.

It was good, but  I’ve made a similar easy dish with a can of Ro-Tel tomatoes instead of broth and a full package of dry taco seasoning mix that has a bit more kick.

This was delicious! Cooked it with two chicken breasts for my husband and I on low for about 5 hours and that was perfect. We also added another 1/4 cup of chicken broth because it was starting to look a little dry in the slow cooker. Used the stated amount of taco seasoning and it was perfect amount of flavour for us. Had it with tortillas for chicken tacos and sour cream paired wonderfully with it. Will make again! :)

I've made this twice now and both times it has been really good. The second time, it was a "last minute" meal, so the chicken was still frozen when I put it in the crock pot. I cooked it on high for about 3 1/2 hours and it still turned out great. I added salsa after shredding the second time as suggested by others. I used the whole seasoning packet both times as well. The only complaint was that it had a little too much liquid, but it tasted great anyways!

I made this dish, using one of the recipes on Allrecipes for taco seasoning mix.  Once the chicken was shredded, I put some of the juice back into the chicken and added a couple more teaspoons of taco seasoning.  It was much better with the additional seasoning.

I've made this about half a dozen times and I love it! I also recommend it to everyone. I don't often care for leftovers but I'll eat this shredded chicken for days after I make it. 
I've only ever made it with bouillon cube broth, I don't know if it's better with canned broth.
