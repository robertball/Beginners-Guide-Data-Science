These were great! I used Sriracha for my hot sauce and it was okay but it would be better with a peeper sauce such as Tobasco or even a Louisiana hot sauce. Excellent recipe!

So good!!!! The lime makes it, I think. I added a bit of freshly grated Parmesan and Italian bread crumbs. We are so anxious to get more fresh oysters!
