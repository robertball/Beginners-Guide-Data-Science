The best Chicken Marsala yet!! The prosciutto adds so much velvety flavor. Ive made it according to the recipe numerous times and it turned out perfect.

Excellent! I followed recipe exactly but added 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic! My family devoured it!
I served it over fettuccine mixed with pesto (not sure if that is paleo) but it was a hit! Will definetely make this again!
