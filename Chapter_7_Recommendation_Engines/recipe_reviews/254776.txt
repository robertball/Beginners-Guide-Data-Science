This is more like a quick bread vs a cake.  That said, this bread has a lot going on, but it is delicious.  I did omit the dried fruit, cuz with zucchini, poppy seeds, orange zest and spices, I felt it was complex enough.  I made it for a farmers market and it was the first item to sell out.  Definitely will stay on my baking list.
