I am so happy to find a recipe for eggplant that doesn't involve bread crumbs or flour! This is delicious as written, simple flavors blending well. I made it the first time without making any variations. The second time I made a few modifications and it made it even more flavorful. I used heirloom tomatoes (de-seeded) and peeled eggplant both times. The second time, in addition to the recipe as written, I sprinkled garlic salt and Italian Seasoning blend over the tomatoes and eggplant. I then sprinkled 1/2 cup shredded Parmesan (not the kind from a can) and 1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese on top. Baked 25 minutes, which was enough. This is a perfect recipe to add veggies into a family meal (always a challenge) and use fresh summer produce. Thank you for this recipe!

I suggest peeling the eggplant 1st.. the rind is not a fun thing to eat. Also sear the eggplant on both sides so it doesn't become soggy when the tomato goes on during the baking process, i also recommend putting some parmesan between the tomato and the eggplant to absorb the tomato juices..DO NOT OVERBAKE.

This was a good jumping off point. I added minced garlic and some dry basil.  I also layered the eggplant and tomatoes with mozzarella.  The baking time was too short so I dropped the temperature to 375F and increased the baking time to 50 minutes.  This was simple but very tasty.  Thanks, Jezz!

After reading some of the reviews I ended keeping the Parmesan cheese & Italian seasoning, then I peeled the eggplant, used canned diced tomatoes (I was all out of fresh as I had just made a very refreshing tomato salad),and added diced kalamata olives & garlic to the whole mix. I also lowered the temp to 375, and after baking for 40 minutes sprinkled shredded mozzarella on the eggplant slices and broiled for the remaining 10 minutes. 
This was absolutely delicious! I love eggplant but am not a fan of frying or breadcrumbs so I was thrilled to come across this recipe. What a super way to have a meatless meal. I bought some good semolina bread so the next day my husband made himself a hero with the leftover eggplant. I will definitely be adding this to my cooking repertoire...thanks Jezz and thanks to all the other posters for adding some great ideas.

Absolutely loved finding a non-breaded recipe and was surprised how delicious! This will be my go-to for summer bumper crop eggplant. Thank you so much for sharing--love, love, love this!

Preparation Must and would eliminate several of the soggy and bitterness reviews I read. As with all eggplant recipes, the key is to sweat the eggplant first. Do this by skinning, slicing, and heavily salting (I use canning salt) and let set for at least 30 minutes -- all the excessive water and bitterness will bubble out. Then rinse thoroughly  and squeeze out all the excessive water with clean tea towel or paper towels.  Then proceed with the recipe.

Tip: bake on stoneware and eliminate the cooking spray. I baked 35 minutes at 400, no broiling required for nice brown crunchy Parmesan. Resist the urge to put mozzarella on as some reviews suggested as it's the browned Parmesan that is so very very good. I also put Parmesan between  the eggplant and tomato--yes, I love Parmesan!

Seasoning Variations: use Italian seasonings (mixture of oregano, basil, thyme), garlic powder, minced up jalapeno between the eggplant and tomato.

I loved it!  After reading the reviews, I followed these suggestions:  I peeled and sliced the eggplant and placed it in a colander and sprinkled it with salt to sweat for 30 minutes.  Then I rinsed it with cold water and patted it dry with paper towels.  
I used a cookie cookie sheet sprayed with PAM.  
I made them WW friendly - 1 smart point for 2 slices.
I topped the eggplant/tomato slices with fresh, chopped garlic; oregano, basil, salt and pepper, crushed red pepper flakes, and 1 tbsp. Pecorino Romano cheese and 1 tbsp. olive oil.  I baked at 400 for 30 minutes.  It was delicious!  I will definitely make this again.

Thank you for the posting.  This recipe was easy to prepare and very healthy (no breadcrumbs needed).  I used a can of diced tomatoes with garlic and oregano.  Plate of spaghetti and garlic twist on the side with cherry cheesecake for dessert.  Excellent.  [I know cherry cheesecake isn't healthy-but it was a boxed mix]

Great recipe - substituted feta because it was all I had... it was delicious. Will definitely make this again - so healthy and flavorful. Followed other suggestions to bake longer at 375... also added lots of garlic and fresh basil.

I made this recipe with Rotel instead of tomatoes and added some squash, while using roasted garlic oil. It turned out absolutely delicious!

I made this dish last night and it was delicious. The only changes I made were adding some garlic powder for flavor and I sprinkled 1/4 cup of shredded mozzarella in the last few minutes of cooking under the broiler. I would definitely make this again!

SO good! After reading a few other reviewers suggestions, I made some minor modifications.  First, I brushed my eggplant rounds with EVO and lightly salted them and roasted them at 425 for 10 minutes.  Then I added chopped fresh tomatoes, fresh shredded basil and oregano, a little cracked black pepper and then the shredded (not the grated stuff you put on your spaghetti) parm.  Baked at 375 for about 20 min then broiled for 3 minutes.  AMAZING!

Hubby came in from the garden with his hands full of eggplant and tomatoes. "Please," he said, "could you make that yummy recipe for baked eggplant? It was so good."  This time I'm making lots so we can have leftovers!

Delicious. I ate the entire thing myself. I used fresh eggplant and tomatoes from my garden. I also just used the dried parmesan that you sprinkle on spaghetti and it was good. I might try it next time with fresh parmesan. It could only get better.

The best eggplant recipe! According to my husband and I concur.  It was very easy to prepare.  It would delight those who do not like egggplant because of the tomatoes and Parmesan.  I followed the recipe precisely and can find no fault with it.

This is totally awesome! I made it as stated and it came our perfect. Because I wanted the antioxidant value of the skin but read reviews suggesting it be peeled, I peeled it every other peeler width so it looked striped. I sliced it into 1/2 inch rounds, salted generously and let sit for about 1 hour. Then I rinsed them off in cold water, pressed them dry with paper towels and proceeded to follow the recipe. I lined the baking sheet with parchment paper and baked them at 400 degrees and they were done in 30 minutes. The parmesan was nice and browned, the eggplant was soft but not mushy. The flavor was fantastic. I am so happy to have this recipe. Hubby liked it too and he is not an eggplant fan.

Oh yes!!! Me and the hubby along with our  girls 3 and 9 loved it!!!! I used mozzarella cheese instead of Parmesan and just sprinkled it, not to much. I cut up grape tomatoes because those were all I had on hand at the time. Baked in grape seed oil instead of olive oil, I also cooked on 375 for 45 mins like one of the reviews suggested.  It tasted awesome I will definitely be keeping this recipe on deck!!!  THANK YOU!!!

We loved it.  Even my husband who is not a huge fan of eggplant said it was the best eggplant he has had and voted to have it again!  I peeled the eggplant first as others suggested. I also added some mozzarella to the parmesan to give it a little more melty goodness.  I served on a bed of cheese grits which worked great with the eggplant. Definitely make it again.

Delicious I followed the recommendation of one of the reviewers who peeled the eggplant and used feta and shredded Parmesan. I also didn’t use the cooking spray but parchment instead brushing the top and bottom of the eggplant with olive oil with minced garlic. The 30 minutes was enough time baking. Skipped the 5 minute broiling time. YYYUUUMMMMYYYY!!! ??

Love this! Only changes: added olive oil between layers of eggplant & tomato. Had fresh mushrooms I needed to cook, so stuck a few of them in the pan. Lots of shredded Parmesan cheese on top and it was delicious!

This was really good, but I would cut the eggplant and tomato thicker. Got a little to mushy so thin. Also minced some garlic and let it sit in the olive oil for about 20 min, then brushed the top of the eggplant.

Single guy. This recipe is so clutch. It has all my favorite hallmarks of  a great recipe; simple, few ingredients, two steps, hard to screw up. I followed recipe exactly the first time but switched it up a little bit see below.

Up the amount of Parmesan a lot. Turn that broiler thing on for like 30 seconds if your parm doesn't look brown and toasty enough. 

You can play around with the herbs that go on top too. Marjoram, Rosemary, Oregano whatever.

I made this recipe tonight as part of a meat free dinner and my husband loved it. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and removed the skin and heavily salted the eggplant to sweat out the bitterness. I rinsed off the salt and dried it before putting in the baking dish. I sprinkled it with garlic powder and dried Italian seasoning and a little freshly grated Parmesan cheese. I topped it with homegrown tomato slices and baked at 400 degrees for about 30 minutes. My husband said it tasted like eggplant parmesan but better. I will be making this recipe often because of its easy preparation and great taste.

I can't seem to find A spot where I can add notes. So I guess I'll put them in the review. This was incredible, I will never make eggplant Parmesan again. I basically follow the directions exactly except I put the Parmesan cheese in between the eggplant tomato, added mozzarella cheese to the top and I drizzled olive oil on the top before I baked it.

I LOVED this recipe! I followed some suggestions of others: I put about 1/3 of the parmesan between the eggplant and tomato, I added basil, I lowered the oven temperature to 375 for 40 minutes, sprinkled a bit of mozzarella and then baked for another 10 minutes at 375 instead of broiling it. DELICIOUS! Will serve to company next time!

Good recipe. Like others suggested, I peeled the eggplant and also added garlic powder. I had a huge eggplant, so I made it 4 different ways (with the tomato, without tomato, with mozzarella and finally with feta). The one that was with Feta was by far the best! Leave out the tomato and add feta. Incredibly delicious. Love that this recipe is versatile and you can simply add or change the toppings to your liking.

Perfect replacement for fried eggplant parmesan served over marinara spaghetti. Will definitely be making this again. I think I'll try mozzarella cheese rather than parmesan next time.

I used Sicilian eggplant and beef tomatoes. Drizzled with olive oil and ground fresh black pepper, sea salt and a pinch of fresh grated Parmesan over the top of each eggplant/tomato stack. 400 for about 30 mins and broiled for 3 as in the recipe. Garnished with fresh thyme rather than oregano.  Unbelievably delicious!  As others have said, finally a fantastic recipe for eggplant that does not use breadcrumbs and frying!

This is so easy and tasty!! I loved it. I added a little hot pepper and dry cilantro to mine. Cooking time was also less because I cut the eggplants into 1/4 rounds. It only took me 20 minutes.

This is an awesome recipe!  We are so happy to have found it.  We have lots of eggplant and tomatoes from our garden right now, so it is perfect.
We grow Japanese eggplant.  The skin is never bitter, so these were just fine with the peel.
We followed the recipe exactly except that we added some Parmesan between the eggplant and tomato in addition to the Parmesan on top.  
We served with pasta.
Heavenly!

This exceeded my expectations.  It was sooo good.  I prepared first the eggplant, I salted, let sit, rinsed and dried the slices.  I also added dried thyme, granulated garlic and a pinch of cayenne.  Alone it is very good but I topped mine with homemade turkey meat sauce, just wow!!!

I loved the recipe best as written with the addition of the garlic powder; however, I liked it with the lightly fried eggplant too. I liked using a cookie sheet better than a baking dish.

Definitely will keep this in the veggie repertoire. Simple to make and gives the impression that you really know what you're doing in thekitchen :). I used diced canned tomatoes, well drained, because the supermarket fresh tomatoes were especially unappealing. I was serving lamb chops so I tried feta as the cheese, and it came out well. Will definitely use parmesan on the next batch and hope for decent fresh tomatoes, can also see trying mozarella or gorgonzola for a different taste. Wife really enjoyed it.

I made some changes after reading reviews. I peeled half of the eggplant to see if that would be better than unpeeled (peeled is much better). Had to use a knife; difficult with peeler.  I had Campari tomatoes that needed to be used up, so I sliced and removed the seeds. Not the best tomatoes for a dish like this. I had some sun dried tomatoes in oil on hand and am now thinking it might be worth it to try some of those chopped up. Topped with drizzle of garlic oil, then garlic powder, salt and Italian seasoning. Only had Romano cheese, so topped with a sprinkle of that and then some crumbled Feta cheese. Gave it a quick spritz of roasted garlic oil and baked in 375degF oven. Started to brown too much, so after 20 min lowered to 350degF for another few minutes. Seemed like a healthier alternative dish without the breadcrumbs and all the melted mozzarella.

I made this for a demo party for Cabi fashions and all the girls love it.  It always a wonderful companion with the tray of baked ziti or stand alone as an appetizer.  I will most definitely will be making this again for a take along to any hostess party or holiday table.  Yummy

As others have suggested, I placed the grated parm between the eggplant and the tomato.  I also put a little extra cheese (mozzarella) on top.  My favorite way to prepare eggplant--so good!

This is an easy and flavorful recipe. As some others did i peeled the eggplant and sliced it, covering it with salt for 30 minutes. Rinse them in cold water and pat dry. I used a glass baking dish sprayed with pam and drizzled it with olive oil. Place the cut eggplant in the dish, salt and pepper. I used some dried basil, oregano and ref chili flakes along with fresh chopped garlic. I used a can of crushed tomatoes and then covered it with parmesan cheese. 373 for 45 minutes. You can use the broiler to make it crispy .

I thou that I would never find a replace for pizza until now. This was the first time ever  that me or my family ate eggplant and they all thought it was pizza. I didn’t say a word until they were all done. Thanks for this great recipe.

Made this with eggplant and tomatoes from the garden. I used salt, pepper, fresh basil, and a little onion powder. For the cheese I grated smoked gouda and blue cheese crumbles. My husband said it was the best thing I ever made with eggplant, and I could make it anytime!

This recipe is amazing!!  It turned out beautifully and tasted delicious.  Before I cooked the eggplant, I salted and dried the slices for 60 mins to improve the texture.  I topped the finished product with torn fresh basil and served it with a side of fresh mozzarella and balsamic.  A+++

Excellent! Baked in 20 minutes and 2 minutes on broil in a convection oven.  We'll add more cheese next time but will definitely make it again. Looks just like the photo.

I knew that this recipe would be good, so, I used two eggplants and doubled the ingredients.  I also used peanut oil in place of olive oil.  Very easy to prepare and was delicious.  I only gave this four stars as AllRecipes' 'Eggplant Parmesan' is better.  Highly recommended! :)

This recipe surprised me.  The photo of the finished dish didn't appeal to me that much and it seemed too simple & basic, however, somebody gave me an eggplant and I figured "What the heck?"  It turned out great and I love the taste.  I made a few minimal adjustments.  1. I peeled the eggplant although the photo showed the peel on.  2. I salted and rested the eggplant to drain the bitterness, which wasn't called for.  3.  I used regular olive oil instead of extra virgin.  4.  Instead of salt & pepper, I used garlic pepper, that also includes salt at #3 on it's ingredient list, so I got the salt and pepper plus added garlic.  I will probably  fix this again, it's so good.

I found myself with a lot of eggplant, and decided to make 3 different eggplant parnesan 3 different ways using 3 different recipes.  This one was the favorite.  The only changes that I made was adding some garlic powder and putting the spices/salt between the eggplant and tomato instead of on top.  This was also the easiest recipe to make, as there's no breading, etc.  Just chop. layer and bake.  Easy and tasty.

We have had a lot of eggplant from the garden. I did not want any more eggplant parm so we decided to try this recipe since we also have a lot of tomatoes. It was delicious. I did lightly salt the eggplant with kosher salt and let it sit in a colandar to drain for about a half hour, then wiped the pieces with a paper towel. We used fresh parm and basil instead of oregano (not a fan). Baked 375 for 40 minutes. Great recipe!

I really liked this one I followed the advice of the review that used basil garlic and mozzarella and lowered the baking temperature and increased the baking time.I also made half of the pan with parmesan reggiano and they were both great! I will make this one again.

Very good recipe. I adjusted time to 45 minutes at 375 degrees. Covered with foil. I did peel it because skin can be bitter.? Used canned tomatoes, fresh garlic and added sliced cheddar cheese last five minutes.  This was so much easier and healthier than frying.

I salted the eggplant beforehand and let it sit for 30 mins. Used dried basil and oregano from my garden. I found this dish very bland and uninteresting. If I were going to try again, I would add pre-roasted garlic and a hearty topping of mozzarella or feta cheese.

This was good.  I layered the eggplant and tomato so it was more spread out rather than on top of each other like in the pictures.  The cheese added some great flavor without too many calories - thanks!

I followed a bunch of suggestions. I took the skin off the eggplant, cut, and let it sit and sweat with salt on both sides like others suggested.  I pan seared the eggplant in butter and garlic before I put it in the dish, and put cheese in between the eggplant and tomato as well as on top. I also added some red pepper flakes. Definitely a keeper, I usually only like fried and breaded eggplant.

Really good. I didn’t think I liked eggplant but fixed this way I did. I followed a couple of the reviews and put salt on the eggplant slices and let it set about 30 minutes then rinsed and dried. I also dried the tomatoes after I sliced them. I seared in a pan to help it not be soggy. Not sure that helped. Mine were a little soggy but they sat for a little but before we ate them. It’s a keeper though.

Love this idea. To me it was almost a healthy version of eggplant Parmesan. I diced and peeled my eggplant for easier serving and used canned diced tomatoes because that’s what I had. I added breadcrumbs and Parmesan on top.

It was very simple to make...although I made it in two dishes I didn't measure the olive oil or the ptarmigan as it needed to cover it.  Next time I will see what happens when I measure it.

I ran out of oregano so I used Herbs de Provence.  They are so yummy and so easy. This one is a keeper!. Now that I have an eggplant recipe that is easy, attractive and low calorie, I will buy more eggplant from now on.
I didn't peel the eggplant and it was tender.  Eggplant did not get soggy and the dish looked pretty.

I make a variation of this recipe that is also great. I peel the skin because it does tend to be a bit tough. I also sprinkle kosher salt on both sides of the slices and let stand for an hour. Rinse the salt before cooking. This draws the moisture from the egg plant and reduces the bitter taste sometimes present. You can add and subtract spices to satisfy your tastes. I fry my egg plant slices in egg with half/half before preparing for the oven.

My 14 year old daughter and I loved it!  We used what we had on hand (canned crises tomatoes), and added a little shredded mozzarella.  Teen says “it tastes like pizza!”

I used Italian seasoning and mixed it with Parmesan cheese. I sprinkled that on the eggplant before the tomato then added the tomato and sprinkled more on top. 400 degrees for 30 mins then broiled for about 3 to 4 mins.  Reminded me of mini pizzas!! I let the eggplant slices and the tomato slices sweat for 30 mins. I will make it again and I think the only thing I’ll do differently is use real Parmesan cheese.  But it was deelish!!  I also used foil and drizzled EVOO on the foil..

Easy,quick and wonderful. Time your prep and all works fine.  Fixed with pork tenderloin that need 20 minutes so the eggplant finished while the pork rested.

Used small eggplants and should have peel them it was a bit tough. It would be 4-5 otherwise. Light and tasty.

Amazing!  I’ve made this twice in the last month and I’m making it again tonight.  I’ve paired it with spaghetti squash to make a healthy version of eggplant parmesan and had it as a side.  It’s just as delicious for leftovers the next day.

This eggplant had good taste. I am not experienced with eggplant yet, so this was a good start. I might peel the eggplant first next time. Very good.

Yummy! I took the advice of another reviewer and used canning salt on the egg plant. I sprinkled the eggplant with the salt,  let sit for 30 minutes, washed the salt off, and patted dry before proceeding with the recipe. Great taste, loved the crisp melted parmesan cheese!

My rule of thumb when trying a new recipe is to follow the recipe completely.  Then critique it to suit my family's pallet.

I'm sure I cut the eggplant closer to third inch instead of the half inch. Yet this is the problem I have with this recipe.  After following the cooking instructions the eggplant was not cooked,  only around the edges.

The tomatoes and seasoning were enjoyed by all. But I will not make this recipe again.

I had never cooked eggplant before, so I didn't know what to expect.  The flavor was very good. I cooked it as written.  I didn't care for the skin of the eggplant, so next time I will peel it.

This was delicious and added to our rotation.  As others suggested, I peeled the eggplant, and the only other change I made was to put shredded gouda on top of each slice before adding the tomato slices so the eggplant didn't suffer with too much liquid and become soggy.  With the oven fan on, it only needed to bake for 20 minutes.  Delicious!

Easy, versatile recipe. Can use as side dish, on top of pasta, in sandwiches, or warmed up as a fast snack. Today, I'm making it for the second time, and this will be my go-to recipe.

Really enjoyed this lower carb, lower fat way of preparing eggplant!  Be generous with the spices and parmesan and maybe feta cheeses.  Will repeat this during the seasons for oven use.

Very good.  The only thing I did different was salt the eggplant and let them sit for a half hour then used a paper towel to absorb all the moisture that rose to the top. I’ve made this several times and once I forgot the tomatoes and it was still great.

This recipe is a good recipe everything turned out well and tasted good. I was very glad to find a no-fry eggplant recipe, however, it turned out soggy and limp. #disappointed I did add a little mozzarella and Mrs. Dash tomato, basil, garlic seasoning on the eggplant and then the tomato topped with a little parmigiana and garlic salt. It was good and makes a good left over snack, I liked the tomato on top, but I don't think I'll make this recipe again.

This is fabulous as written. I also love it with fresh mozzarella and basil. The Parmesan cheese is a must, in my opinion. This is definitely lighter than eggplant parmigiana but, for me, is better. I don't need or want the breaking and frying anymore.

This dish was ok. I will definitely make again but will omit oregano and maybe do garlic and parmesan cheese. I will definitely peel first also. I've never made egg plant before so this was my first experience with it. Live and learn.

I took some advise from the reviewers, adding spices.  I'm not a good cook, so cut the eggplant too small.  Still very tasty.  I just need to tweak it for perfection.  Very delicious.

Like other reviewers, I peeled the eggplant first, added some mozzarella cheese between the tomato and eggplant.  I also added garlic powder and oregano.  I baked at 375 and it took 20-25 minutes.

My variations: I used a Japanese eggplant, 2 Roma tomatoes, and Pecorino Romano cheese. My slices were on the thin side because I used a mandoline, so I only baked it for 20 minutes. 

Will try layering with fresh mozzarella next time. Will also make thicker slices and peel the eggplant, which I usually don't do. Good weeknight dinner for one.

Loved it. I did not have parmesan, substituted mozzarella (and piled it on thick!) and did not peel the eggplant. The skin was unnoticeable to me. Will definitely make again!

I didn't have enough ripe tomatoes in my garden so I used 1 green tomato.  It gave it a little extra zing.  I also used a splash of balsamic vinegar as suggested by one reviewer.  I will use green tomatoes again.  Red and green are both good.

Enjoy tasty veggies in a healthier way.

Super simple meal w/ really quick preparation. A perfect recipe if you have lots of eggplant and tomatoes and don't want to go to the trouble of eggplant parm or even eggplant rollatini.  It doesn't have the flavor of these two, but it also doesn't have the calories of those two. 

I really liked this, but my husband did not.  He goes for the flavor of the higher fat eggplant preps because he isn't that in love with eggplant.  That's why I gave it 4 *s.  I will make this again, but maybe put mozzarella on top so it tastes more like eggplant parm.

Excellent! Mixed garlic, onions and peppers in olive oil and spread on foil lined cookie sheet. Added pealed eggplant with sprinkled Italian spices, basil, parmesan and mozzarella on top. Topped eggplant with thick tomato sprinkled with parmesan. Cook 375 degrees 35 mins. adding more mozzarella cheese on top last 5 mins. Ate with crackers out of the oven. Will eat with toast next.

Delicious!! I was looking for a simple recipe to bake eggplant b/c I was tired of frying them, with all of the mess that makes. I didn't have a tomato to put on top of the eggplant but I'm sure that would have made it even better, and I'll do it that way next time! The parmesean cheese was so good on top.  We are harvesting a bunch of eggplants from our garden this summer so I'm happy to have an easier way to make them now!

I will not make this again. I followed the recipe with no changes, but the eggplant came out soggy and bitter.

Quick, easy and tasty. I used young white eggplant, and the rind was tender enough to be no problem; I agree that peeling might be good if using a larger/older eggplant. I added a bit of fresh minced basil from the garden and a dusting of granulated roast garlic. I also used two cheeses: a thin layer of finely grated Parmesan, overlayered with a bit of shredded mozzarella. I would definitely make this again; the one change I might consider is giving the eggplant a bit of a head-start in the oven before adding the toppings. A portion of the batch was overlaid with mock cheese for a dairy-intolerant family member; that also was a success.

We LOVED this recipe!  I also had no fresh tomatoes so used a large can of seasoned diced tomatoes and also used fresh oregano, since I had some in my garden.  Baked at 375 for 1 hour and it was perfect. This recipe is a keeper!

Wonderful recipe.  Sprayed pan with coconut oil.  Prepared a small eggplant into  1/2 inch slices.  Seasoned with powdered garlic &  Italian Seasoning with  a tad pink himalayan salt.  After 25 minutes,  I turned eggplant slices then added tomatoes.  I only had small plum and mixed organic hierloom so I sliced these 1/4 thick.  topped with  1 cup of shredded low fat mozzarella and 1/4 cup shredded merlot asiago cheese.  l Baked a total of 50 mins at 380.  Then broiled for 5 mins.

This was absolutely the best way I have ever made eggplant.  I just happened to have the tomatoes so I thought I would give it a try.  It was so easy which is how I like it.  I will definitely make this again.  Lowrey's seasoned salt is a must.

Easy to make. Added a little garlic and teeny amount of onion. Had to improvise on the cheese with what was in the fridge (Kraft Parmesan and mozzarella). Served it with a crusty bread.  Will definitely make this again

It's really healthy and delicious, but mine came out a little soggy. May be the tomato? Anyway, it's worth a try.

A tasty, simple and healthy side-dish. I've been trying to bring my own lunches to work instead of eating out every day. This dish takes very little time to make and can be used as a side for days.

I increased baking time as suggested in other reviews. I think 50 mins was too long because the eggplant was very mushy. This was my first time preparing eggplant. I will try this recipe again and shorten the baking time. The seasoning was good and the tomatoes were a good complement.

Hard to believe something this easy could be so good.  Took it to a dinner and everyone loved it.  Like others suggested I added garlic (just because I love garlic) not because it needed it !

This is a great recipe. Easy and tasty. For some reason I thought the eggplant would have a bit of a crunch or firmness to it. Thanks for sharing.

Ten star recipe! I made the entire recipe for a Meatless Monday and ate half all by myself!  I added 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder and a sliced jalapeno - almost tasted like pizza. . . Highly recommend and WILL make again! Thanks JEZZI16.

Really good! I'm not always a fan of cooked tomatoes, but this recipe makes them delicious. I did have to cook mine significantly longer than the recipe calls for, but it was delicious when it was finally done! I think next time I'll sprinkle a bit of crushed red pepper on it, to give it some kick.
