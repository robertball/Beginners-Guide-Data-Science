This is a creative spin on trout, without question!! An excellent pairing trout/wasabi!! So, I prepared it first to the letter. (Really respected the original recipe for its creativity) And it was really good, but any Asian inspired fish recipe without ginger is lacking something, in my opinion. The recipe was good just not memorable.  Found out trout really is an excellent fish to accompany wasabi! It's mild flavor lends itself well, and does not need a full-blown teriyaki or overpowering marinade. The second time I adjusted by adding a tsp of ginger, substituting sesame oil for olive oil, added 4 teaspoons of brown sugar and finally swapping parsley for oregano! Lastly, as other reviewer's recommended I added additional wasabi. Give it a try, but I really believe it needs the ginger at the very least and brown sugar binds the sauce adding a shimmer and is well suited as a glaze. The extra wasabi should be added, per your own taste and sesame oil is kind of a no-brainer being that it is an Asian inspired recipe.

A gorgeous blend of flavours.  I followed the recipe as written The wasabi was wonderful with the trout.  I will add even more next time.
I added some lemon.  I didn't find it too salty, but my husband did.  I have a real salty tooth :-)

Very good prepared according to recipe.  But, I used salmon, not trout.  Some changes on subsequent preps....Too salty? use low sodium soy sauce.  I double the wasabi and actually marinade it for about 1/2 hour before cooking.  Use remaining to make the glaze.  Line pan with parchment paper to make for easy clean up.

Very good!  I used this on Swai and it came out very nice, a little soupy in the baking dish (probably from my fish choice).  I will use a broiler pan or a rack to keep the fish up a bit next time.  Agree with other posters - More Wasabi, little less soy, and maybe some sugar for a nice glaze

This was excellent! The grocery store didn't have trout so I made it with tilapia (at 350 instead of 450).  It was so good!

Just made this - delicious and easy! As others suggested, I used low sodium soy sauce so did not find it too salty. I followed the recipe on the amount of wasabi, and would definitely add a bit more next time.

This was fantastic. Quick easy and amazing flavor. You may want to double the wasabi, but it was a very very good dinner. We put the fish on a bed of Thai noodles. This is gonna be our new go to recipe.

This was really good. The only change I made was to half the amount of wasabi. Next time I will use the whole amount  as it was not as spicy as I thought it would be.

Fish recipe good but disappointed it was not as spicy as I expected it to be with wasabi in it. Will try again but will increase amount of wasabi. It may be because I used powder instead of paste.

Used this to prepare Steelhead trout. Used wasabi powder without making it into paste; twice as much as called for, and equal parts sesame oil and olive oil instead of just olive oil  per Nance’s review. I grilled it on non stick foil, with lemon slices tucked under the fish. Yummy! Next time, I will add some ginger to the sauce (also Nance’s idea).

Fantastic! Agree with other reviews to add more wasabi. The flavor didn't come through. I also used sesame oil instead of olive oil. Will definitely do this again, likely with salmon or rockfish!

My husband really enjoyed this dish. I made a few alterations to it. I did not have wasabi so I excused that from the recipe. I added 1/2 tsp of ground ginger and 3 tsp of brown sugar as suggested by another reviewer. It was delicious.

It was way too salty, and I could not taste the wasabi. Next time I'll use double the wasabi and half to 1/3 of the soy sauce.

This was amazing. I didn't have wasabi paste, so I used wasabi mayonnaise I had. 
The smell coming from my oven was delicious from the time I placed in oven.

Loved this! We catch a lot of trout and this is a great new way for me to prepare. I agree that the wasabi flavor is mild at this quantity, so add more or enjoy the more subtle taste.

Easy, good flavor. Couldn't really taste wasabi.  I doubled recipe, and used tilapia.  I would use less soy sauce next time.  Also took longer to cook.

Wow! This is so simple and so amazing. I use wasabi powder and a pinch of basil.
