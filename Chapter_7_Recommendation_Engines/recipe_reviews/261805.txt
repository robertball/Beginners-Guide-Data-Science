This was the first time I ever made a vegan cookie! I thought the consistency was great but I will add more spices next time. I couldn’t taste the difference between this and a cookie made with butter. Also the 2 hours of chilling time didn’t do much in my opinion, so next time I will probably only chill if I’m having trouble rolling it out.

I followed the directions exactly and these cookies were delicious. For me, 1/2" thickness was easier to cut and made cleaner cut cookies. Great recipe!

We cooked at 9 minutes because I prefer a chewier cookie and they were amazing. Be sure not to roll the dough too thin, my men became amputees when I pulled them up from the cut out so I rolled them again and left them chubbier and they kept all their limbs.

So I made quite a few substitutions for my dietary needs. First, I used bob's mill 1 to 1 flour, coconut sugar, and blackstrap molasses. The result while making them was a very crumbly dough. But working it with my hands helped soften the coconut oil and make it a very firm dough. Chilling did not help, as I couldn't roll it out without it breaking apart, so I rolled them into individual balls, pressed flat, and cookie cut out. The result was a very dark, only light sweet, and kinda dry cookie. Next time, I will add a little more wet ingredient. But for a first try, it wasn't bad

Really good, wasn't expecting much but ended up loving the cookies (and the dough ??) The third time I made them I forgot to pick up molasses and so substituted it with maple syrup and a few ground cloves, still good. Glad this recipe is so wonderful

Wonderful! Super easy and tasty. I used daiya soy-free dairy-free "butter" instead of coconut oil.
