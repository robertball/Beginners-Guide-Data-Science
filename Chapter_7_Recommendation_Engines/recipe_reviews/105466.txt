For being a sugar free crust it was really good. Easy to make to. First pie crust I have ever had turn out for me!! One thing I did change; I used butter flavor crisco instead of regular shortening. I think it enhanced the flavor and helped to brown the top as well. I made this for my fathers birthday since he is diabetic and he loved it. The pie came out looking beautiful however as it cooled the crust did collapse some but I think alot of crusts do. Definatley something for diabetics to try and those who want to cut back and sugar.

I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was horrible. I followed the recipe exactly and I thought it was brittle and unappetizing after trying one piece.

I LOVE this recipe, not only does it cut the calories in nearly half, but it turns out light and flaky every time I've used it, and I always get rave reviews and requests for the recipe. Brushing the top with milk about 15 minutes before its done really brings out a nice golden glow.

just tried this recipe - it's excellent. was hesitant as i'm a purist but had to bake my husband's apple pie with splenda - doc's orders. his blood sugar is too high. For those who are hesitant... don't be! It's excellent - it tastes just like regular pie crust. YUMMY!
