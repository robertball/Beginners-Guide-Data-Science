My x-mother-in-law would always bake knots and it has been twenty-five years since I have been divorced and have not eaten these cookies. I made them and they are the same cookies and came out perfectly. I sure mixed not knowing how to make them. I added a lb container of fruit cake mix after I kneaded the dough and I didn't even have to frost them.

This recipe was very good. It took a little while to make but my eight year old daughter helped and we had a great time! We took some of the dough and rolled it into balls and stuck Hershey's Kisses in the middle. All of my children loved those. Thank you Susan!

These cookies are not sweet so I felt it needed the confectioner's drizzle. Plan of having plenty of time to shape the cookies. The texture is excellent however.
