I took other reviewers advice and used 2 cups whole wheat flour & 1 cup bread flour, and added 1 tsp salt, increased the honey to 1/4 cup, and used 2 tbsp melted butter instead of oil. I also used the dough cycle on my breadmaker, punched down the dough and let it rise for 30 mins. in a loaf pan covered with plastic wrap before baking it @ 350 degree's for 25 mins. I also put a pan of water on a lower rack of my oven and my DH said after eating some of this bread...EXCELLENT! So this is a keeper with some minor adjustments....

This is the BEST bread recipe I have come across.I did change the amount of honey to 1/4 C. and used real butter instead of oil. This is my new staple bread recipe. Thank you so much for this submission. It also works well with molasses( I ran out of honey).

I only gave this 4 stars since I changed several things based on other reviews. I used 2c. wheat flour and 1c. bread flour. I also used 1/4c. honey. I was concerned that this would make it too sweet but it balanced the other flavors perfectly. I also used 1t. salt. The end result was WONDERFUL. I will definitely make this bread again and again. Thanks for the recipe!

This bread is good. However, it is much better with more salt: 3/4-1 tsp, depending on taste. More honey also improves the taste;  my friends and I like about 5 tbsp. BTW, I measure the oil in the tablespoon first, which helps the honey not stick to the spoon.

This is a great recipe as is (although the amount of salt called for does seem too little), but also great for tinkering to personalize to your own taste. So, as many others have done, I put my own spin on this. I had milk I didn't want to waste, so I used that instead of water. I upped the salt to 1 teaspoon, substituted butter for the oil, used equal amounts of whole wheat and bread flour, and added 1 T. of vital gluten for good measure! Many reviewers increased the honey to 1/4 cup, but I found the 3 tablespoons to be perfect.  For those who choose to stick to the recipe as written, I suggest you at least increase the salt to 1 teaspoon. This is just a great loaf of bread - moist and tender crumb, beautiful color and simply delicious.

Terrific!  Increased the honey to 1/4 cup, the salt to 3/4 teaspoon, and changed the flour -- decreased the white by 1/4 cup and increased the whole wheat by the same amount.
My husband and I stood in the kitchen eating thick slices of this with butter while the rest of dinner was finishing!  This will make a perfect set the timer on your bread machine and awaken to homemade bread recipe!

I modified the recipe for high altitude (I live at
4700 feet) by reducing the water to 1 cup plus 1 T, and
reducing the yeast to 1 teaspoon.  It turned out great.
It is very light for whole wheat and should pass the
"kid friendly" test OK.

This bread is wonderful, even my 9 mo. old son thinks so!!  I upped the honey to 1/4 c. and the salt to 1/2 tsp.  Try this:  Slice off a nice thick piece, butter both sides and toss into a warm skillet.  Fry on both sides as if making a grilled cheese sand.  Right out of the pan, spread on some peanut butter and drizzle with honey.  That is so awesome.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Good basic bread.  I didn't have enough honey though.  I agree with the other reviews, add more honey.  Also, this is for a one pound loaf so I changed the serving size from 10 to 15 to make a 1.5 pound loaf.  Next time I will size it to 13 because it slightly overflowed the machine and was a little doughy.  It might also use just a little more salt to bring out the flavors.

In my search to find a bread that would work for sandwiches and toast, I have tried four recipes on this site and this is it!  While the others were good, Simple whole wheat bread and Fabulous Homemade bread, this was far superior in taste, texture and the ability to cut for sandwiches without crumbling.  If you don't have a bread machine, you can follow this is a guideline.  Combine yeast, water and a tsp sugar and let proof for 10 minutes.  Meanwhile combine white flour and salt in a bowl.  When yeast is proofed, add to flour and combine with 1/4 c. honey and veg. oil.  Mix well.  Add whole wheat flour until it pulls away from the bowl and knead well.  I use my Kitchenaid.  I then let rise in a glass bowl in a slightly warm oven and then formed in a loaf in a loaf pan and let rise.  I cooked at 350 in a convection oven for 25 minutes.  However, I did cook it once without a convection bake setting and it took an additional 15 minutes.  Hope this helps.

I love this bread; light and tasty. As usual, I used the dough setting and kneeded the bread a little on a floured surface folded the sides under and flipped it into a well oiled bread pan. I baked this one at 375 for 25 mins and it came out perfect!

I used the yeast and water as recommended in the recipe. I used my breadmaker on light crust/basic setting and it was perfect.  Am now making it for the third time.  I will seek information on how to make a cinnamon raisin version of this same recipe.  Delicious!

Thank you all for your tweaks.  This is the best wheat bread I have ever made.  I put in 1/4 C of honey, 1 tsp. Salt, 2 C whole wheat flour, 1 C of all purpose flour, and 2 tbsp. Of butter instead of what was listed on the recipe.  I baked it in a bread machine using the basic setting, light crust and 1.5 lb. loaf.  Even my husband ate it, and he is not a fan of wheat bread!

Great bread!  Perfect density, holds up well for sandwiches, great taste!  I will make this one often.  I like it as written but do think that the changes other reviewers mention (2 c whole wheat to 1 cup bread flour, 1/4 cup honey, 1 t salt) make it even better.  I used my bread machine to mix/knead and baked it in the oven for 27 mins at 350 and it came out a beautiful loaf to look at too!  A new favorite, thanks!!

First from-scratch success in my bread machine!  I'd been using my machine mainly for just dough, as anything other than a packaged mix just didn't bake right in my machine.  This recipe was DELICIOUS!  I used the suggestions made by several reviewers (increase honey, salt, and whole wheat flour) and my loaf was beautiful!  Nice crust, soft enough to slice for sandwiches, and toasts up wonderfully without being too "crumby".  Thank you for this recipe.

As written, it is pretty decent other than the salt ratio was off so I used a tsp. This bread as written wasn't my favorite.
The second time I made it though it came out outstanding. We like a sweeter wheat so I used about 1/4 of a cup of honey, I also used more wheat flour like the other reviewers- 2 cups wheat, 1 cup bread flour and still 1tsp of salt.
It was loved by my family and is always requested.
I love this recipe was easy to customize. I would rate a 4.5 because of the lack of salt, it really does add to the final loaf and it could mess a newbie bread cook up. But other than that fabulous!
Thanks for sharing.

I had been looking for Whole Wheat Bread that tastes better than what you buy from the store...THIS IS IT!  The crust was perfect, the bread was tasty.  My kids wanted to eat just bread.  I followed other reviews and put 2 cups of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of bread flour.  I didn't have a lot of honey so I put 1/8 cup of honey and 1/8 a cup of agave.  It was delicious!  This is going to be our weekly sandwich bread now.  Thanks!

I made this recipe a long time ago, no modifications.  That's some regular bread, there.  Then today I tried it with the suggestions in the comments.  1/4 cup honey, 1 tsp salt, butter instead of oil.  I also added a handful of crushed walnuts for texture.  I just had a slice, lightly toasted with butter, and... wow, that's good.

I gave this 3 stars because my loaf was beautiful and the bread consistancy was perfect for slicing.  
I made it as written however, I put my machine on dough and shaped in a loaf pan let it rise 45 min and cooked in a 350 degree oven between 25 and 30 minutes.  I will definately make again taking the advice of other reviewers and add more honey, salt, butter and divide the flours differently as the taste was lacking in flavor.

This is the absolute Best whole wheat bread ever! I have used it many times and agree with others: change to 1/2 c honey, use 1 cup white and 2 cups whole wheat bread flour and substitute melted butter for oil & DON'T try doubling it lol!

PERFECT!!  SO SO SO SO GOOD.....I can't add anything to this wonderful recipe.  This is our "99%" of the time bread.  I have had my bread machine a long time and have tried a LOT of recipes and this one produces a nice light and perfectly textured loaf.  Thank you SO MUCH for sharing this recipe with all of us here! 
**I usually only do the dough cycle and bake it in a regular loaf pan**

I've made this bread many, many times.  I follow the other reviewers suggestions and use 1 cup white bread flour and 2 cups whole wheat flour.  I also increase the salt to 3/4 tsp. and use 1/2 canola oil and 1/2 olive oil.  This bread is wonderful!  Try it, you won't be sorry.

Liked the taste of this bread; I followed a reviewer by removing it from my bread machine prior to the 3rd rise; let it sit in a covered pan for 30 minutes, then baked in an oven with a pan of water. 

It's a lot heavier than I imagined, but that may just be wheat bread itself...

Even though I normally don't care for whole wheat,  I'm trying to switch over and this was really pretty good.  My daughter complained because it wasn't white bread, then proceeded to eat 2 slices.

This bread is just okay. The loaf turned out well, but the taste was not anything wonderful. I used 1/4 cup of honey and I couldn't even really tell. I probably won't be making this again.

I make a loaf of bread every week or two. Mostly Jalapeno-Cheddar, Spelt, Oatmeal etc.. This is the First Whole Whet Recipe that I actually Liked. And I REALLY LIKE IT! I did make the recommended adjustments, and baked it in the oven. EXCELLENT Recipe! Best Whole Wheat by far!!!

WOW!  I thought that the Amish White Bread was the best bread, but that doesn't even compare to this amazing bread!  Changes:  honey to 1/4 cup, salt to 1 tsp, 2 cups wheat and one cup white flour and added 4 tsp vital wheat gluten.  Mixed on dough cycle in breadmachine, let rise 40 min in pan and baked for 25 min at 350.  This is it!  Look no further!

Very easy to make! I use only whole wheat four and just increase the water by a little, and it comes out great. One of the easiest breads I've ever made. Healthy too!

Loved this bread recipe! Like others, I used 1/4 cup of molasses instead of 3 Tbsp of honey, and 1 tsp of salt. Also used 3 cups of whole wheat bread machine flour. The bread came out a beautiful shade of brown from the molasses, and was just perfect moistness and flavour. Next loaf I'll try 1/4 cup of honey instead and see how it comes out.

Great recipe!  I made a few changes the 2nd time around, and now make this weekly, with the following changes:  use melted butter in place of oil, increase salt to 1 tsp, decrease yeast by about 1/4 tsp, increase honey to 4 Tbl, and use 1/2 cup bread flour & 2 1/2 cups white whole wheat flour.  Delish!  I've had trouble off & on with the bread rising very high, but then collapsing during the final hour.  The bread still has great taste, and texture, but just doesn't look as nice.

I Double the recipe to make it bigger… also adjusted it 2 cups bread flour to 1 cup wheat,and butter instead of oil. Also added 1/2 teaspoon more of yeast.
As the bread comes out of the oven completely cover the top with real butter… Love it!!
Thanks

This recipe is very easy to follow, and turns out great.  We just got our bread machine, and have been looking for recipes, and this one is definitely a keeper.    We did take into account what some reviews said and used 1/4C of honey, and also added some vital gluten, but everything else was kept the same.  We couldn't wait to cut into the loaf!  Delicious!

As others have mentioned, this is the BEST bread yet! I did make some changes myself. Added 1 egg, only 1 cup water. Instead of vegetable oil, six Tbsp ground Flax seed and 2 cups whole wheat flour and 1 Unbleached, Unbromulated white flour and 1 tsp salt. Wonderful texture. Thank you Kathy.

High Altitude/Vegan Changes Great recipe. With a few changes, came out perfect! I live at 8000 ft alt. It's neccesary to increase water a little bit, increase salt and decrease yeast at this altitude. I added another tbl water, changed the honey ( I am vegan) to 1/8 c molasses and 1/8 c agave sryup. Increased salt to 1 teaspoon, 1 3/4 c whole wheat flour and 1 1/4 c spelt flour. Same on oil and used 1 tsp yeast. I put it on the bread dough cycle and when it was completed I took it out, punched it down and put in a greased bread pan. I let it rise again and baked at 350 uncovered 20 min and then covered with foil for another 20 min. It came out light and airy and very tasty! Excellent!

Well I made even more modifications. I used whole wheat flour ONLY (no white flour, no bread flour). I replaced the water with 1 and 1/8 cups warmed whole milk. And used 2 teaspoons of bread machine yeast. I used the 1/4 cup honey and 2 tablespoons of melted butter and the full 1 teaspoon of salt. I set the machine to rapid bread cycle and waited. We had trouble restraining ourselves to wait even 5 minutes after this came from the machine to cut it but it was no matter. It was INCREDIBLE! I was not sure how it would turn out at all and was prepared to have wasted the ingredients since I made so many modifications. But this is a very forgiving bread, evidently...and did I mention incredible? It's been done for almost a half hour and is nearly gone now. I'll have to make another loaf!

This bread is wonderful. It came out very light and delicious. The only thing I did was decrease the white flour by 1/2 c and increase the wheat by 1/2 c and the salt to 1 tsp. Other than that no changes are needed. Great bread.

I just made this recipe twice and this is the best wholewheat recipe I have made in my bread machine so far. I adjusted the honey to 1/4 cup and added 2 Tbs. of Vital Wheat Gluten and used the White Bread cycle. Very tasty and good color. I also tried the recipe using  with 2 cups of Whole Wheat and 1 cup of White Bread flour. Also very tasty however did not rise as well. In addition I have left the salt out of the recipe as I have to lower my sodium intake and it does not seem to affect the taste, I could not taste a difference

Mine keeps sinking in the middle. It rises great but when it bakes it falls every time.  I have tried the whole wheat setting and basic setting with the same result. I have white bread down to a science but the darn wheat is putting up a fight.  Yes I measure ingreadents carefully.

I took tips from other reviewers and made it with: two cups whole wheat flour, 1 cup bread flour, 1 tsp salt, 1/4 cup organic maple syrup, and the rest is exactly like the above recipe. The previous night I tried making a whole wheat loaf with the breville recipe booklet but it was so dense and didn't rise. This was AWESOME; chewy, moist, soft, not too dense not too light, semi sweet, tasty, and it rose perfectly. I put my bread maker on basic/ light crust like one of the  reviewers and it took an hour and a half to bake which is magnificent compared to the whole wheat setting which takes 3.5 hours. I love this bread and will be making it over and over:)

Delicious! Followed all directions except added 4 teaspoons vital wheat gluten to dry ingredients to create finer texture and aid in rising. Mixed dough in bread machine, punched down and shaped into loaf, let rise another 30 minutes. slashed top, brushed with butter, &  baked in 350 degree oven for 45 minutes. Divine bread.

Change servings to 12, then use 2 lb setting on breadmaker.  Added a little extra honey, use more WW flour than white, and add flax seeds and about 3/4 cups of nine grain.  Very tasty, the kids love it.

Followed the advice of others by changing: salt to 1 tsp , 1/4 c honey, 2c wheat flour & 1c bread flour, and butter instead of oil.  Amazing flavor & texture.  This one is a keeper.

I would like to try this recipe again, using the changes suggested in the comments, but I made it exactly according to the recipe, and the bread rose way too much and overflowed into the machine, burning and leaving a big whole in the middle of the loaf. My guess is that more salt would keep the yeast in check.

so good, but also took other reviewer's advice to use 2 cups whole wheat and up the amount of honey...I'm addicted to this and my house smells incredible in the morning as my bread machine finishes this up for breakfast and sandwiches.

This is the first loaf of bread I made in my breadmaker.  We regularly purchase honey wheat bread so when I recieved a breadmaker as an early Christmas gift the first request from my fiance was honey wheat.     The bread is delicious (tastes almost exactly like the store bought that my family loves but is so much fresher and softer), and my fiance and kids love it! I'll probably add more honey and salt for a bolder taste as other reviewers suggested the next time.    The serving size is a little off and the recipe makes a 1.75 pound loaf instead of a 1 pound loaf. I doubled the recipe to make a 2 pound loaf (the biggest size my breadmaker accommodates) but the dough overflowed from the top of the pan while it was rising so I split it in half which yielded two almost 2 pound loaves of bread.

Was a good bread. I did a half white flour and half whole wheat flour. The Kids don't like whole wheat bread and they ate it up. I thought the flavor was good, but it came out heavy. Could've been me with the measurements. Don't think it was the bread machine. May try again to see if it works out better.

Good bread with a great texture.  I personally feel that the writen yeast amounts are too small, so I increased it to 2.25 tsp and 1 tsp salt and it almost overflowed my bread maker.  My mistake, but the texture was amazing, and I'm pretty sure that the extra yeast got it there.  The extra salt was to moderate yeast activity, but I guess I have some healthy yeast in the kitchen right now!

I make all my own bread, and this is the recipe I use to do it. This recipe exactly as written is fabulous. I chose it because it is whole wheat, has less sugar and less oil than most other recipes. The taste and texture are fabulous, and my family and I love it. I won't eat store bought bread now unless I have to!

With the changes that others made (2 cups wheat, 1 cup bread flour, 1 tsp salt and 1/4 cup honey) this bread was fantastic! I bought an electric knife which made slicing much easier and the result much less ugly. Better than store bought.

At the suggestions of others I did the following alterations...2 c whole wheat flour, 1 c bread flour, 3/4 tsp salt, and 1/4 cup of honey. This was my first whole wheat bread and I am very pleased with the results. Crust is a tad thick for my toddler, but I usually cut the crusts of anyway, so no biggie. If you are looking to try a whole wheat bread, I highly recommend this one. Thanks Kathy!

I made this over the weekend and it tasted good - but I needed to add another cup of water.  The 1 1/8 made a "mealy" looking dough so I added the water and restarted the cycle.  Turned out good.

This was the best wheat bread I have ever made.  It was so light and soft.  My kids loved it.  I used the dough setting of my bread machine and then put it in a loaf pan and let it rise.  I baked it in the oven at 350 for 35 minutes. That way the shape is better!

This bread is the perfect texture -- not too dense and not full of holes.  I add 3 Tbsp of vital wheat gluten to help with rising, as well as increased the salt to 1 tsp.  Per other reviewer's suggestions, I increased the honey to 1/4 cup.  I use the dough cycle on my bread machine and then turn the dough out into a bread pan and let it rise about 30 minutes before baking for 30 minutes at 350 in the oven.  We just like the traditional bread shape better, and I think bread baked this way is lighter than bread machine baked bread.  Great recipe!

I use the dough selection on my bread machine and bake the bread in the oven.  I have found if I change the recipe servings to 15 (from 10), the amount is perfect for two 1 lb pans.  I also use 1 tsp of salt and 1/3 cup of honey.  I have sucessfully used honey or molasses, oil or melted butter depending on what I have on hand.  I someimes toss in a little oats, or flaxseed meal, or unsalted shelled sunflower seeds, or coarsely ground yellow cornmeal for variety.

This bread is OK but I was hoping it would be a bit sweeter since it is called "Honey Bread."  Was more like a standard dense whole wheat bread.  This recipe is good if you like normal whole wheat but look elsewhere for honey wheat.

This is very, very good! I followed the others advice and upped the honey to 1/4 cup. Also increased wheat flour by a 1/4 cup, decreased bread flour by 1/4 cup. Changed salt to 1 tsp. It lasted less than a day! Thanks!

I've made this bread more times than I can count in the past month -- it never lasts more than a day!  Even my picky daughter loves the taste.  This bread is our everyday bread.  I double the amount of honey and use butter instead of vegetable oil -- we like it sweet!

Excellant, excellant, excellant. Came out perfect the very first time. I won't use any other honey whole wheat recipe from now on :) This goes perfect w/ my homemade vegetable soup that we just had for dinner. I need to make another loaf...this one did not last.

Good texture. I mixed it in the machine and baked it in the oven to get a full loaf for slicing. Family thought it could use a touch more salt, and perhaps a bit more honey.

Yes!  I love this recipe! I wanted to use my bread machine without having to take the dough out, etc.  I made this bread using this exact recipe, thinking I could tinker with it later IF it came out at all.  YAY!  It came out with just a slight drop on one side - This bread is delicious! I didn't change this recipe at all.  My daughter loved it too, and she would not hesitate to let me know if she didn't like it.

I have made this twice and love it.  I rated 4/5 because I did modify the recipe slightly after reading some of the reviews.  The biggest change is that I mixed the dry ingredients in a bowl and stirred it thoroughly prior to placing it in the bread machine.  I used olive oil.  I used the rapid wheat setting on my bread machine.  The texture was so light and airy and the flavor was wonderful.  I will be making this again.

I decided to buy a bread machine after several disappointing purchases from my neighbourhood bakeries. The last loaf I bought cost $3.00 and was as hard as a rock. I couldn't even use a slice as a frisbee; it was too heavy. What made it worse was that the lady assured me the bread was baked that day. I received my Hamilton Beach bread machine last night and couldn't wait to try this recipe. This was my first time baking bread - ever.  

I took the advice of other users and increased the salt and honey. It was hard to wait 15 minutes to cool the bread down. The smell was enticing. It is delicious - soft, warm,light, mmmmmm. My two year old son was adamant that he was not hungry, yet ate 2 slices. He even rejected eggs - his favorite breakfast food so he could have "more bread please, mommy." I cannot wait to make this again when my husband comes home. I believe this bread will make a whole wheat convert out of him.  Next time, I will try the dough setting and bake it in a traditional loaf pan.

Thanks, Kathy.


Update: I baked this bread for my husband when he got back from his trip last night. He told me not to feel bad if he didn't like it because he doesn't like wheat bread. Needless to say, he ate his words and 3/4 of the loaf.

Since my husband is on a low sodium diet, I am glad to find a bread that works for us.  This was very good.  I made it exactly as called for with the ingredients, but don't have a bread machine, so made the "old fashioned" way, by kneading and rising.  Put the flours and salt in a large bowl.  In a separate bowl, put honey, yeast and water and mix, add the oil, then put that into the dry ingredients.  Mix well, knead for about 8 minutes on a floured counter, let rise in a greased, covered bowl for an hour or so, punch down and form into a loaf, put in greased loaf pan, let rise again. Bake for about 30 minutes at 350.  I will make this again - made a delicious, dense, sweet bread with very little salt.  Also, being in a loaf form, we got more than 10 slices from it, making each slice lower in calories and sodium content.

Doubled the recipe except the honey (which went to 1/3cup) and the oil (where I used 2T organic coconut oil instead). Used the bread machine on the dough cycle then made 4 PERFECT delicious loaves. This recipe is a keeper!!!

Excellent and easy! On my first try, I followed some other reviewers' advice and used more honey and salt.  This made it too sweet for use in sandwiches.  The next time, I followed the recipe and it came out perfect.

I made this today using some of the modifications recommended by others. I used 1/4 cup honey, 1 teas salt, 2 cups whole wheat flour, 1 cup bread flour,   2T softened butter instead of the oil and added 1 Tablespoon vital wheat gluten. The rest was unchanged. I ran the bread machine on the dough cycle, pulled the dough out, punched it down and put it in a greased loaf pan. I allowed it to rise until it reached the top of the pan--it took almost an hour. Then baked for 25 min at 350. It was really good. Thank you.

The bread had a light texture just like my hb likes it. The four stars is because it doesn't taste that wheaty, which is what I like. Next time, I may try putting the dough into two bread pans and baking them in the oven, as my bread machine loaf came out really tall -- not a fault of the recipe.

Delicious! I made the adjustments suggested by others -  1/4c honey, 2c wheat flour, 1.2 tsp salt. Made this on the dough setting in the breadmaker, then put it in a regular 9x5 loaf pan and let it rise for an hour, baked at 350 for just over 25 minutes in a pre-heated oven, and it was perfect!

I made this bread AS IS and it is DELICIOUS!  I saw other reviews say they added more honey but I think it would make it way too sweet.  I did have a problem with it collapsing in my bread machine so I may add less yeast next time but I think that may also have to do with the higher altitude.  But the flavor was AMAZING!!!

I no longer buy wheat bread, but make this recipe about once a week!  It is so simple and so delicious.  The first time I made it, I didn't have the shortening or the dried milk, so I followed others' suggestions and added and 1/8 of a cup of milk to 1 cup of warm water and 2 T. of veg oil.  It came out fabulous!

I made this bread last night did take advice and did 2c wheat flour bread maker flour (Redmill) 1c white bread maker flour. 1/4c honey and 2tsp bread maker yeast. I used my breadmaker on dough setting. then took the dough and made 4 lg dinner rolls and 1 loaf I buttered the pans first. ( cover with plastic wrap and put on top of stove to help rise with oven on low, in 30 min the dough had risen up beautifully.As good as my Moms or grandmas. This Redmill whole wheat bread maker flour was beautiful I am going to try it with no white flour next time. Baked 375 for 20 min med brown color on top. The rolls were so pillowy soft inside. This is going to be a family favorite. Cinnamon rolls coming next.  Enjoy :)

I recalculated the recipe for 14 servings from 10 and it was the perfect amount for my 2-pound loaf machine.  It was perfect, by the way.  Great texture, good rise, amazing flavor.  I ground my own whole wheat flour, so it felt very Little House on the Prairie.

This bread is wonderful! I decided to make them into dinner rolls, so I just used the dough cycle on the bread machine. I took the dough out of the machine let it rest for 30 minutes then divided the dough into 16 dinner rolls, which I put into greased muffin tins and let rise for one hour. Before baking at 350 I made an egg wash with one egg and a splash of milk and brushed onto the tops. Baked for only about 15 minutes. They came out perfectly, just like the bead from restaraunts. The only other changes I made are pretty much the same as everyone else's I added 1/4 cup honey and 1 tsp salt. I also used milk instead of water and added a heaping tbs. of brown sugar just to give them even more flavor. You have to try this bread as dinner rolls they are amazing!!

This is a great loaf for sandwiches, I make a loaf every couple of days for lunches and every scrap is eaten! I add about 1/4 cup of ground flax seeds, and sometimes will use 2tbsp of cooking oil instead of the butter. Good all-around bread!

Great bread!!!!  Moist, and not too crumbly like other wheat bread recipes I've tried.  And not too dense either.  Perfect!  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and did the following adjustments: 2 cups wheat flour, 1 cup all-purpose (I didn't have bread flour), increased honey to 1/4 cup, increased salt to about 1/2 tsp., and used butter instead of oil.  I also used the dough cycle on my bread maker and then took it out, put it in a bread pan covered with sprayed plastic wrap, and let it rise for an additional 40 minutes.  Then baked it at 350º for 35 minutes. Lately I've been separating my bread into two small bread pans and baking smaller loaves.  (350º for 25 min)

I'm new to making bread and this was so easy. I made it in my breadmaker on "quick wheat" setting. I did add 2 tsp of brown sugar, used all whole wheat, added close to 1/2 cp of honey and a bit more salt and it's a hit. It comes out great!  I tried other recipes on here and they were too heavy, too moist, too bland. this one is fantastic!

This is really good wheat bread!  I took other reviewers reviews in mind when I made it and I made it with:  2 cups wheat flour, 1 cup bread flour, 2 tbl butter, 1 1/2 tsp yeast, 1 1/8 warm water and "eyeballed" 1/4 cup honey (it was probably more on the heavier side).

I will make this again and again!  It was so easy and so tasty!

I loved this!  I did do 2c. whole wheat and 1c. bread flour, and I raised the salt to 1 tsp. ... also, I baked in the oven after mixing in the bread machine ... just made the loaf, let it rise in the pan about 40 minutes, then baked at 350 for about 50 minutes ... it turned out GREAT ... just the right sweetness, wonderful texture ... thanks!

This bread was excellant!!!  I doubled the recipe and set it on the dough setting in my bread maker.  Once it had done all the work I divided it into three loaf tins, let it rise half an hour and then cooked for 20 minutes.  Delicious!  I've had requests for the recipe.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I have made this many times!  Like some others have suggested, I increased the honey to 1/4 cup because I like a sweeter bread.  I made the dough in my bread machine and baked off in the oven.  When I'm stretched for time, this recipe makes wonderful rolls if you roll into 2 inch balls and bake for 12-15 min.

This recipe is excellent! I changed the oil to melted butter, also and increased the salt a bit. My machine "soaks" w/w flour before it starts the cycle, so mine takes 4 1/2 hrs total, but it's worth the wait.  Delicious, light, great texture and taste...

This bread was really yummy!
I used a little more honey than the recipe said, to give it more flavor. And I didn't have bread flour so I just used white flower instead. 
I will probably make it again.

I changed the servings to 15, used the dough cycle.  Then rolled out into a circle and made crescent shaped rolls.  Let rise 35-45 minutes, baked for 20 minutes on 350.  A new healthy alternative.  Will make again and partially bake, freeze and keep for busy days.

Ths is about the 4th wheat loaf I've tried and it was the biggest hit by far!  All my other loaves sat around after the first slice, but this one was gone in one night -- my entire family devoured it!  I did add extra honey and a little extra salt, which did help the flavor, but made the dough extremely sticky and hard to work with for kneading and forming into a loaf pan for baking in the oven.  (I worked more bread flour into it to fix this.)  I served it warm with some whipped butter infused with roasted garlic spread on it and it was incredible!  I am going to be making another loaf of it this afternoon!

I put this on the dough cycle on the bread machine, then took it out, formed it into a ball, let it rise, then baked it in the oven... Just a hint of honey makes it great for breakfast or a sandwich!

My family loves this bread! My kids have never liked store bought wheat bread due to dryness. But they love the soft, moist texture and sweetness of this wheat bread. I took the advice of others to suit our tastes. (2 c whole wheat, 1/4 c honey OR molasses).

One of the very best if not the best bread recipe.  I also live at high altitude and used a slightly modified recipe as submitted by EJonespr - but the bread is top notch and will make it regularly.  The texture is perfect -  it is hard to get a good bread at over 6,000 feet high altitude.  Thank you so much.

This is a delicious recipe. I love the slightly chewy texture of the bread; I rarely get that from bread maker recipes. I did 1 cup whole wheat and 1/2 cup white and it turned out perfectly. A little extra honey adds a touch of sweetness.

I've just tried this bread today for a first time. Baked it in my new bread machine. Turned out wonderful! I used 2 cups of wheat flour and 1 cup of bread flour, 1/4 cup of honey and 3/4 of tea spoon of salt. The bread is soft and moist. Great flavour! It's a keeper :-)

This recipe was really good. I used molasses instead of honey, only because I had some that needed to be used and I really like the flavor of molasses in baked goods. It's really good warm with butter. I think the recipe is great the way it is and requires no changes.

I liked this recipe a lot! It is THE one I will be using for my wheat bread from now on. I recently received a Breadman bread making machine. I have to say, it is the best I have ever had. This particular recipe is almost exactly the same as the one for whole wheat bread in the machine recipe book. I made a couple changes, having read the other reviews. I used 1/2 cup honey, 1 tsp. salt, then after experimenting with this recipe, I decided to used 2 cups whole wheat flour, and 1 1/2 cups bread flour, because I the machine is larger and also because I found to improve the wheat taste of the bread. The texture of this bread, whether done my way or as written is excellent. The temperature of the water is crucial, in my opinion. I used canola oil instead of vegetable, to make it a little healthier, or at least I thought it would. :) Next time I shall run the dough cycle only and bake it in the oven. I did this when I added raisins to the mix for a raisin wheat bread. Although I did not like the taste at all fresh out of the oven. After it had sat and cooled for a day, I toasted a thick slice, just so as not to waste it. It was quite good. I will be doing it again. I found that eating it without butter or margarine is preferable to my taste. I also put a light coating of 10X sugar and milk on the loaves fresh out of the oven. Definitely a keeper. So many ways to adapt this basic recipe. Thank you so much for sharing & all the reviewers for sharing their experiences!

Loved it.  Updating the review.  A few changes were made increase water to 1 1/4 cups, decrease yeast to 1 1/4 tsp and decreased salt to 1/4 tsp.  In the break maker pan I measured the water then added the honey then the yeast.  I allowed it to sit for about 1 mintue then added the remaining ingredients. I set my bread maker and set the timer for medium loaf which has a 4 hour setting.  After 2 hours I divided equal into 2 small loaf pans.  Poofed in warm place for 1 hour and then baked in a 350 degree oven for about 17 minutes.  This has been my go to recipe for brown bread for the last couple of months now.

I made this bread today and the middle caved in....this is the first time this has happened to me.  I have made several loaves of bread in the machine using other recipes and they turned out fine.  Not sure what happened here.

I subbed my home ground rye flour that I needed to use up, for the whole wheat as I had none ground and ready. I ended up using close to two cups of rye and  cup of all purpose (Canadian AP has enough gluten for bread making) along with a couple of good tablespoons of gluten flour. I had to adjust the water by 3 tablespoons to accommodate the rye flour's dryness. This turned out FABULOUS with excellent texture and structure and makes fantastic toast. I can slice it very thin too for toasting. I am not a huge fan of my machine for actually baking bread, usually using for the dough cycle only. I will be making this bread again...and again...and again!

I also changed the wheat/bread flour ratio, upped both the honey and salt.  used the dough feature on my bread maker and then let it rise in the pan for half an hour.  baked at 350 for 25 minutes.  This was by far the best bread I have made.

This is my go-to bread recipe. I do use butter instead of oil, milk instead of water, and I use all white whole wheat flour. I was having trouble with my bread collapsing at the end. When I decreased the liquid to 1 cup, that problem was resolved. It's a great basic bread recipe.

It took more than 5 tries to get this recipe not to fall/sink. Here is how I fixed it. I live at 3600 ft and usually don't have to adjust for high altitude. 
Decreased water to 1 cup + 1 TBSP
Increased salt to 3/4 tsp or heaping 1/2 tsp
Decreased yeast to 1 tsp
Adjusted bake cycle to Basic Light setting and removed promptly upon completion. It was very delicious so I was determined to make it work. I have an Oster 5838 Bread Machine. Good Luck!

Excellent. Followed the recommendations - 2c whole wheat/1c bread flour, increased honey and salt.  It made such delicious and tender loaves.  Reminded me of warm donuts (but less sweet)!

AWESOME recipe that can easily be adapted.  I've been making this basic recipe for the last couple of years now, and have added my own adaption: instead of using basic bread flour, substitute with Multigrain Bread Flour Blend (I use Robin Hood).  Always make sure your water is warm enough to activate the yeast, and for a softer crust you may add a little dry milk powder.  My entire family LOVES this recipe, I am always having to make more.  Canadian flour does not require that you use "bread flour" in machines, although you will find that your bread is slightly more dense and less bubbly if you don't.  Save money by using a basic whole wheat flour combined with your multi-grain bread flour.

An excellent basic wheat bread receipe for everyday living.  I love knowing exactly what's in my bread (no mystery ingredients).  I used 2 cups wheat flour and 1 cup white bread flour, and increased the honey to 1/4 cup (per numerous rater's advice).  Plus, I used melted butter instead of vegetable oil.  Comes out beautifully in the bread machine.

My kids love it!!  So I have made a loaf about everyday for the last week or more.  Recipe is perfect, wouldn't change a thing.  Great toasted with a little jelly for breakfast,  awesome sandwich bread for lunch, and great served hot out of the oven for dinner.

Did not raise well enough. Maybe I need to test my yeast. Very dense and moist. Nice crust. A little salty (will cut back on salt next time when using salted butter.)Will try this again.

The middle of my bread fell in. Despite that the flavor and the texture of the bread was good. I used 1tbsp of blackstrap molasses in place of one of the tbsp of honey. I also increased salt to 1 tsp.

Nice bread.  I followed recipe exactly and I can definitely taste the honey...  Next time, I'll increase the amount of Wheat to Bread flour ratio, as I think a more dominant wheat flavor would be good.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This bread was very good.  I did as other reviewers said.  I did 2 cups wheat flour to 1 cup bread flour.  I also increased honey to 1/4 cup and salt to 1 tsp.  I used the dough cycle on them machine.  Pounded it one more time and formed rolls.  Let it sit in warm oven another 30 min then cooked at 375 for about 12 minutes.  I will warn you, first bite you're like eh then the flavors kick in mmmhmmm

This bread is so wonderful that I had to comment! I agree with the other comments that it is great for sandwiches. I was always looking for that great bread machine recipe and this is it! One tip is to make sure the water is very warm (110 degrees) you may want to use a thermometer the first couple times to make sure it's in the right range. One of my loaves did not rise and I think this was why.  Great recipe!

Very yummy! I used all whole wheat flour (sifted) and did not have 7 grain cereal so I used 1/4 cup of oats, 1/4 cup of sunflower seeds and a 1/4 cup of flax seeds (ground). It turned out to be a very healthy, hearty and flavorful bread.

I followed the advice of more salt and more honey in the comments area.  This is an excellent bread.  Having a slice now with margarine and a drizzle of honey and it's DEEEE-LISH!!!!!!!!!!!

I added 3 tablespoons of Vital Wheat Gluten, increase salt to 1 teaspoon, I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour, and 1 cup of bread flour.  The bread rised nicely and fluffly.  For the twist, I added 1 and half tablespoons of cocoa powder, the bread came out to be very dark in colour with a hint of chocolate.  Very nice recipe, thanks!

I think I have finally found the "sandwich" bread I have been looking for!  I did change to 2 cups whole wheat and 1 cup bread flour but only because I like to get as many whole grains into the family I possibly can.  I have made a loaf a day for about a week now and nobody has asked for store bought because they are so happy with it.

Great recipe! We adjusted like earlier reviews suggested (3/4 tsp salt, 1/4 c honey, etc.) and everybody loves it! Baked it maybe 5 times these last couple of weeks and goes good with anything.

I made this last night in my Breadman bread machine and it came out a bit spongy/firm. It definitely wasn't soft and fluffy, so I may need to experiment with the ingredients. I ended up modifying the ingredients a little bit. I used 1 teaspoon of salt, 2 cups of wheat flour and 1 cup of all-purpose flour. I'll try it agin soon.

2/06/10 OK I just got a Wolfgang Puck bread machine.  I am attempting this recipe as per the suggestions and my manufacture order of ingredients I will be back in 3 hours to rate... OK so if you tuned in 3 hrs ago the recipe had 3 stars why because I couldn't give it 0 to keep the rating in limbo until the bead finished well needless to say my family..... LOVED IT!!!  It came out perfect.I followed the suggestions and adjusted my flour, honey and salt I also used butter instead of oil.  I used my Wolfgang bread maker and walla  Homemade bread.  I topped it with some melted honey butter and it will now become our new sandwich bread absolutely awesome

I made this without a bread machine and it turned out great. I used 1 cup white flour, almost 2 cups wheat and 4 teaspoons vital wheat gluten.  I didn't increase the honey or salt as other users recommended and still found it delicious. A perfectly textured crust and deliciously soft center. Nothing beats homemade whole wheat bread!

This was a really great bread.  I used all the ingredients that the recipe call for, except I didn't use vegetable oil or a bread machine.  I dissolved the honey in the warm water then I added the yeast.  Then I let it sit till it was foamy.  Once foamy, I added the salt and canola oil.  After this was mixed I added the wheat flour and bread flour.  I let it sit until it rose about an inch above the pan, then put it in the oven.  WOW!  Best wheat bread I have made so far.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is the best bread recipe I have ever made, and I've made LOTS of bread through the years!!  I used 2 cups of whole wheat four and only 1 cup of regular flour, and did increase the honey to 1/4 cup, because I like honey!    Turned out wonderful, I'm making the second loaf now. OH, and I used the Dough Cycle on my breadmaker, punched it down and let it raise in a greased loaf pan, then cooked for a little over half an hour (watch the bread, ovens can vary).... YUMMMMMMMMMY!!!!!!!!!

Don't add extra honey! That is, unless you like really sweet bread. The first time I added extra honey as others have suggested and it came out nice, but too sweet to go with dinner. I made it again tonight following the recipe and it had the perfect sweetness, you can still tell there's honey in it but it's not overly sweet. I recommend making it once before adding more sweetness.

I bought a bread machine a few weeks ago and was not having the best luck with it. Most of the bread fell or came out like a brick. This bread came out great! I did take the advice of other reviewers and used 1/4 cup honey, one tsp salt, changed the flour to 2 cps whole wheat and one cup bread flour. I also added one tbsp vital wheat gluten. Bread filled my 1 1/2 -2 lb machine. Was light and flavorful. Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent bread!  I added more honey like other reviewers suggested and a pinch more salt.  I also added milled flax seed (1 tbsp) as a personal choice.  Mixed it in the bread machine using dough cycle and baked it in a bread pan in the oven.

I also used 1/4 cup of honey and 2 c wheat and 1 c AP flour.  Next time I will add a little more salt as well.  An excellent recipe...so nice to have fresh bread without any fuss.  I did not bake in my bread machine.  I greased a small loaf pan and baked for 25 min at 350 degrees.

This bread isn't too bad but I have made Steakhouse Wheat Bread from this website that I feel is better.   It was also disappointing that there seemed to be an air bubble in the middle and the loaf fell in.

Stick with the 3 T of honey!!!  It doesn't taste too sweet then.  I, following the reviews, switched to 2c whole wheat, and 1c white flour.  I used a delay bake, and it turned out nice and light and fluffy!  Yum!

I did as other reviews suggested and increased wheat flour by 1/2 cup and decreased white flour by 1/2. I also added a little extra sweetner.  DELICIOUS AND BEAUTIFUL!

I increased the amount of honey in this recipe to 1/4 cup, which helped the flavor tremendously, however, I still think the texture was just too dense for our taste.  I like a light and airy bread, and this one was just not it.  It's consistency is just much too heavy.  Will continue to look for a lighter bread.  But thanks for sharing this recipe.

I added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of yeast and it had great texture, but it needs more salt(maybe 1/4 ts. extra),it was somewhat flavorless.  I will bake it again with more salt and maybe some ground flax seed.

I made this bread the other day and it was great.  I followed the recipe exactly but added 1/4 cup or so of ground flax seeds.  It was so moist and fluffy and as a few other reviewers said, stayed that way for quite some time.  My 11 year old daughter could not stop eating it!  Making another loaf tonight to be ready by morning.  Make this!

Based on some other reviews, I made the following alterations; used 2 cups whole wheat pastry flour and 1 c. white; added 1.5 T. wheat gluten; increased honey to 1/4 c.; and this recipe came out AWESOME! I have only used the "dough" setting on the breadmaker, though; I've found that this recipe does take quite a bit of time to rise, so I'm a little reluctant to let the breadmaker bake a loaf. I just prefer to let everything rise until it looks right, and then put it in the over myself. This has made excellent dinner rolls and loaves of bread. I highly recommend it.

This is the best whole wheat bread recipe I have ever found. I have tried many. It stays moist for many days, not like most that tend to dry out in a day or two. I do not like the shape of the loaf in my bread machine. I just use the dough cycle and then let it rise in a loaf pan. I bake it at 35o degrees for about 40 to 45 minutes in my oven. It also make great bread sticks for those special meals. I did increase the honey to 1/4 cup and I only use canola oil. Instead of butter on the crust, I use the butter flavored spray oil. No fat.

"...Give us this day our daily bread..."  I just found our daily bread recipe! Oh my goodness, this bread is just way too good! I wish I could give you 10 stars but you'll have to settle for 5. I would have taken a picture but it was gobbled up so fast! Thank you for this simple and simply wonderful recipe.

So delicious! I did something wrong so my dough didn't rise, and I ended up with a flat, doughy loaf, but it was still so good. I originally took other reviewers' suggestions to use 1/4 cup of honey, 1 tsp. of salt, 2 cups of wheat flour and 1 cup of bread flour. I'm making the dough again in my bread machine right now. This time I used only a cup and a tablespoon of warm water (another reviewer's suggestion for high altitude), and added 1/4 cup more of wheat flour. The dough still looked too wet as it was mixing so I just had to add another 1/4 cup of flour. I hope it comes out better this time. Even so, this recipe is worth experimenting with until it works!

With rising food costs, I've begun making our bread instead of buying it and this is now our staple bread.  I too took other reviewers advice and used 2 cups whole wheat & 1 cup bread flour, use 1 t of salt, and used 2 tbsp melted butter instead of the oil.  I use 1/4 C agave syrup instead of honey because it has a lower glycemic index.  Works great in our bread machine and the hubby and I can't resist a slice or two as soon as it comes out.

I took the advice of other reviewers and used 2 cups wheat and 1 cup white flour.  I added gluton because I wanted it to rise nicely.  I measured 1/4 cup honey and 3/4 teas. salt.  I used my bread machine to knead but removed it and let it rise in a bread pan.  Delish!

This recipe is great just as written. I tried it with extra honey as others suggested but hubby and I agreed that we liked it less sweet. I've been having issues with my whole wheat bread since getting married (I guess its from moving to another state with a different climate) but this one turns out wonderful!!

This bread is amazing! I did everything exactly as it says except for adding way more honey because my husband LOVES honey wheat bread so I added 1/3 cup of honey and it turned out amazing. The dough may seem a little sticky when taking it out of the machine to put in the pan but after it bakes it's amazing! I will definitely continue to make this bread often!

I added half an onion, a pod of garlic and a teaspoon of cumin to this recipe. It was delicious! The texture is perfect. I used a  tsp of salt like the others, and 2 cups of whole wheat flour + 1 cup of bread flour. I  didn't change the recommended amount of honey and it tasted   fine. Delish. I think this is going to be my weekly bread, with a few variations each time. Jalapeno and cheddar next??!

I've tried a lot of bread machine recipes and this one takes the cake (excuse the pun). I mistakenly put 3 tbs. of canola oil in the recipe instead of two and decided to continue on my second batch... the first batch almost lifted the lid on my bread machine so I increased the salt to 1/2 tsp and kept the 3 TBS of honey.  I found it to be a very tasty bread with just the right amount of sweetness for me!

So good!  I took other reviewers' advice and used 1/4 cup of honey and a whole teaspoon of salt.  I also used an entire 2 1/4 tsp. packet of yeast.  This bread came out wonderful, soft and earthy.  The aroma alone is enough for me to make it again!

The entire family loved this bread!  I followed the advice of previous reviewers to use 1/4 cup of honey, change the whole wheat to 2 cups, white flour to 1 cup and use melted butter instead of oil and it was excellent.  Thank you for sharing!

We really enjoyed this bread.  Even my kids like it.  I love it with tuna for a sandwhich.  I also increased the honey and my bread machine is either white med, white light, or wheat and I used the white light the 2nd time.  The wheat setting would have way over cooked it as I stopped it with 19 min. left to go and it was done.  I may try adding the butter the next time I make this recipe.  It is my new staple bread recipe!

I thought that this made a really good and tasty loaf of bread. It's not bread that I would use to make sandwiches, but it's really good with just butter or jam, or even plain. Just as other reviewers have done, I made alot of adjustments to the recipe. First off I used 1/4 cup of honey, which gave it just the right amount of sweetness. Then, I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour, and 1 cup of the bread flour, and I also used melted butter instead of vegetable oil. It made a super yummy bread!

I followed the recommended proportions: 2 c wheat flour, 1 c reg. flour, considerably more honey.  I also do not have a bread maker.  I don't know too much about bread, but I just let the kneaded dough rise for an hour, then baked it at 375 for 30-35min.  It was delicious!  I noticed other non-bread-maker wheat bread had an extra period of rising after the initial hour--this still tastes good, though.

Delicious! However, the bread fell while baking. I think in the future, I will have the machine do the dough and bake it in the oven. Excellent with peanut butter and honey!

I'm new to making bread, but this turned out perfectly! I used the dough setting on my bread machine, and then let it rise and baked it in the oven (I never like the shape of bread machine baked bread). I also used 1/4 cup honey and increased the salt -  I will be making this again and again!

INCREDIBLE. Absolutely delicious. I followed previous advice and increased the honey and salt. I also used all-purpose flour in place of bread because I was clean out of bread flour, and it still tastes great. My father's on a whole "no sugar, no flour" kick, and he cracked the moment he smelled the bread.

I was very pleased with the results.  I made 3 changes based on other reviewers:  1/4 cup honey, butter instead of oil, and I used regular flour instead of bread simply because i was out.  My 3 year old LOVED this bread.  It makes a great loaf for snacking and for sandwiches--with a dense crumb.  Based on my calculations, it should be a pound AND a half, and I set my machine accordingly.  This is definitely going in my recipe box.

I make this in a bread machine. I scale down to 12 servings which ends up being a loaf. I go ahead and use a whole packet rise instant yeast with warm water and brown sugar or honey or both because we like our bread slightly sweeter. I also put a Heaping Tbs of powdered buttermilk blend and increase butter to 2 Tbs. throw it all in the bread machine on 1 lb loaf med crust and presto!

I had to give it a four star review because I went off the reviews of other.  I did the 1/4 c honey, 2 c whole wheat and 1 c breac flour.  With those it was great.  I will go back and try the original just because I feel I owe itnto the person who gave us this recipe.  Thanks.

I LOVE this bread!
Like others I changed things a bit but only because I know my family likes slightly sweeter bread. So: I added 1/4 c raw honey, 1 tsp salt, 1/4 c margarine (I don't have access to butter). Oh, and in my warm and humid country, I only added 1 tsp active dry yeast on top of the 2c wheat flour, 1c bread flour and 1 tbsp of wheat gluten. The machine setting was wheat, and medium crust.
So, ok, I changed it a lot! But, seriously, this recipe was the basis so credit where credit is due, right?
The bread was DIVINE. Soft and fluffy, lots of wheat nuttiness, the crust was perfect (not too thick or tough).
My go-to recipe from now on!

Good loaf, by hand.   I did up the salt to a teaspoon and added a  little more honey, as did many of the other reviewers. .   Nice, crumb, crust and flavor.

My 5 year old son is somewhat of bread snob and is picky about his bread with normally the fancier it is the better he will eat it. I've  been searching and trying wheat bread recipes with mediocre results until I found this recipe. I normally make 2 loaves a week and as the recipe is I give it 5 stars. His preference is a little sweeter tasting so I did go on the advice of others on here and add 1/4 cup honey instead of 3 tbsp honey, added 1 tsp salt instead 1/3 tsp and added 2 cups wheat flour and 1 cup bread flour instead 1 1/2 cup wheat and 1 1/2 cup bread flour.  He says it's perfect with the extra honey and loves it! Thanks for sharing it

This was a nice change from the recipes that were included with the bread machine.  The bread is soft and porous, and this is the first recipe that my kids have asked me to make again (we just got the bread machine, and are trying different kinds).  The recipe doesn't indicate the loaf size, but it worked as a 2.5 pound loaf in my machine.

This bread came out PERFECT! I followed the one review of adding 1/4 cup honey. I also only used wheat flour as I did not have any bread flour on me, and it was still amazing! My kids love it and I've made it several times already.

I made this bread according to recipe but was disappointed in the flavor.  The crust was crispy and the texture was good.  But the flavor was very bland.  Even butter didn't help.   I think the recipe needed a little more salt.  I will probably add some seasonings and make croutons with the rest of the bread loaf.  

Sorry.....I wanted to like this bread.

I have been trying several wheat bread recipes from Allrecipes.  This is my favorite so far.  Making a second loaf this morning.  I love wheat bread.  All wheat is too dry, but half white, half wheat is tender.  I used to make home made bread all the time when kids were little.  This compares to that consistency very well.  Just husband and I now.  One loaf lasting 3-5 days.  Perfect!

I followed the other reviewers advice with the ingredient measurement changes and it came out great.  I  used a breadmaker.  How do I make this into a 2 lb loaf for the breadmaker? It is currently a 1 lb loaf.

I did not like this recipe. The end result came out looking good, smelling nice, but the taste was just NOT there. It was slightly gummy (even though baked through).  I will not be using this particular recipe again. It may be great for others, but for me, I'd have to say, nay.

I took the guidance of previous reviewers:  used 2 cups whole wheat flour, 1 cup bread flour, substituted maple syrup for honey and increased it to 1/4 cup and finally increased the salt to 1 tsp.   I got a lovely result!

Excellent easy hearty bread recipe. Very tasty. Will add more honey next time. Hubby loved it too. I added 1/4 cup honey  but a little more would be good. Toasted brought out the flavor. I should have used the whole grain cycle. Store bread getting too pricey, will use this recipe a lot!

I tried with 1/4 cup honey and 3/4 tsp salt according to other reviewers. I also added some sunflower kernels. Even though my dough was really wet, and the bread is dented, it turns out to be delicious, soft and fluffy. But I still keep wondering if anyone had a really wet dough like mine. Anyway, I am going to try it again and give as a gift to one of my friends.

My family doesn't care for too much wheat taste, so I used 2 cups flour ,1 cup wheat.  It was gone in 1 hour.

I've made this recipe a dozen times and it turns out great each time. I'm sure you could tweak the ingredients to suit your tastes, but as is this recipe is a winner.

Quite good, would definitely recommend.  I had also tried it with just all-purpose flour and had enjoyed the flavor more.

Everyone loves it. I used butter instead of oil, increased the salt to 3/4 tsp, and used 1/4 cup of honey. I selected the dough setting on the bread machine, and baked the bread in the oven on convection at 365 degrees in a Pyrex loaf pan for 30 minutes.

This recipe is my very favorite one. I have made about 42 loaves so far over the last two years for just my husband and myself! I use 2 cups whole wheat and 1 cup bread flour, 1/4 cup honey (no molasses), 1 tsp salt and 2 Tbsp sunflower oil for the shortening.  Thank you to Kathy for this top notch recipe!!

I added 1-1/2 cups warm water; 2 cups whole wheat flour and didn't have any bread flour so used 1 cup regular white flour. The rest of the ingredients I used as in the recipe. It came out very moist, not overly sweet and a very nice texture for cutting.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

Very good- I've done a lot of baking with my machine and this loaf came out the easiest to cut into nice slices like store bought.  Appreciate the no refined sugars and preservatives!

I did as the reviews said and used 2 cups wheat flour, 1 cup bread flour, 1 tsp salt and 2 T butter. Recipe is for 1 1/2 lb loaf. This bread was delicious.... one of the best I have made.  It is very soft and not overly sweet.  My kids and husband also loved it.  Thank you for an easy and tasty recipe!

Awesome as is.  However I've tweaked it for a softer/sweeter taste that my kids will eat without complaining.  I use 1 1/4 cup water,  1/4 cup honey,  1 TBSP white sugar,  1 tsp sea salt.  I add 1-1/2 TBSP Vital Wheat Gluten to make it softer.  Other than that,  everything the same,  put on dough cycle then I put in a greased bread pan, let it rise,  and bake at 375 degrees for about 30 mins.  (keep an eye).  

YUM!!  My go to recipe!  Thanks for sharing,  gave me a good base to start with.

I have been searching for my perfect honey wheat bread recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I'm still looking for my perfect recipe.  This was dry, bland, and oddly spongy.  I'm not going back to this recipe.  The search continues...

I wasn't real happy with this recipe until I modified it: I proofed the yeast adding it to the 115 degree water and honey for 10 minutes, then add the oil and SIFTED flours in that order.
It worked just as good in a $20,low quality, purchased on CL bread machine! I've substituted molasses for honey and it's even tastier.

I thought this was really good.  I did make the changes many had suggested. I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour and 1 cup bread flour.  I upped the honey to 1/4 cup and added 1 tsp salt. I also used butter instead of oil. I baked this in the oven instead of my bread maker. It rose nicely, I did 2 rises, the 2nd in the loaf pan.  The bread came out beautiful and tastes so good with the modifications.

Very good bread.  I did make some changes.  I only used wheat flour, added some vital wheat gluten, and reduced the honey to 2 Tbs. I'm making 4 loaves a week now, as this has become our everyday bread.

This turned out perfectly. I bought whole wheat berries and ground them in the coffee grinder to make the whole wheat flour. Used 1 1/4 cup of whole wheat and then used 1/4 cup ground flax seed and then the regular amount of bread flour. Also substituted butter for oil and upped the salt to tsp. Great recipe!

Is the original recipe really only for a one lb loaf of bread? I doubled it because I wanted a two pound loaf and it completely exploded out of my bread maker. I'll try it again with the original recipe because of the great reviews, but I am highly disappointed in this :(

This bread is phenomenal. I tweaked it slightly - 1/4 cup (plus a tbsp) of honey, 2 cups whole wheat flour and one cup bread flour, and then I use two tbsp butter instead of oil. I make a loaf every week - it's amazing with my grandma's homemade jam.

Really good bread!  I took the advice of other reviewers and used 2 cups whole wheat flour, 1 cup bread flour, 2 tbs melted butter and 1/4 cup of honey.  I've made this a few times now, and my whole family loves it.  I used the dough cycle on my bread machine, then punched it down and put into a bread pan for a second rise (about 30 minutes), and then baked in the oven at 350 degrees.

This was very tasty. Made the recommended ratio tweak and used 1 tsp salt. Mixed with my Kitchenaid with the dough hook. Used agave instead of honey, added a 1/2 tsp brown sugar to feed the yeast. Delicious. Thank you for sharing the recipe, we will make this again!

This is the BEST bread ever in my opinion!!! I followed the suggestions of increasing honey to 1/4 cup, increasing salt to 3/4 tsp, and changed the flour ratio to 2 cups WW and 1 cup BF.  I also used 2 tbsp of melted (and cooled) butter in place of the oil.  Baked up beautifully in my bread machine on the light setting.  I took it out 6 minutes before the baking cycle was over. Perfect crust!!

I made this and followed the directions as they were. My son who is 4 years old and a very pickey eater said this was "very good!" My husband likes to eat very healthy so this will be something we will make again and again! ( BTW- this was my first time making bread and it turned out! Good luck to all)

I also give it four stars. I used some of the suggestions posted by other users, but it's a great basic recipe and I use it all the time. However, I only use my machine on the "dough" setting and then I move the dough to a loaf pan and bake in the oven so that it will be shaped properly for slicing for toast and sandwiches without the hole in the middle from the bread machine.

Excellent bread.  This is now one of my favorites. I took other reviewers advice and increased the honey to 1/4 cup and used 2 tablespoons butter instead of oil. I will make this often. Thank you for the recipe!

This is my bread staple.  I do add more honey as per other comments.  Great bread toasted.  I always get comments from my co-workers about how good it smells while toasting.

Yummy!  I added the extra honey...1/4 c. And 1tsp salt.  Also used 2 c. Whole wheat flour and 1 c. All purpose.  It is moist and my 3 year old will not stop asking for more honey bread.

Excellent recipe! I use my bread machine to make the dough, but I don't really like the shape of the bread if I bake it in the machine so I put it in a bread pan to rise for an hour. Bake at 350 degrees for about 25 minutes. Always comes out great.

awesome!  I used half water and half milk and a bit more honey.  Then I made rolls with the dough.  They were the best Ive ever made.  My boyfriend ate half the rolls with blueberry jam before they were even cool.

My husband loves this bread!  I use my bread machine and end up making two loaves out of this by using the dough setting my my machine.  I then bake in the oven.  Great Bread!  Easy recipe to follow.

This bread was great! I was leary because I haven't had good luck with bread machine recipes other than those that came with my bread machine. The bread was fluffy and moist and tasted great with just butter on it. I increased the honey to 1/4 cup and used 2 cups whole wheat flour and 1 cup white bread flour.

It was ok, but not my typical honey whole wheat.  I needed something different since I was almost out of honey and this was good in a pinch, but I will go back to the other recipe I have.

This is my standard breadmaker recipe.  I use butter instead of oil, and add about 3T of gluten.  I love using the local honey in thei bread - it has such a richer flavor than the cheapo grocery store stuff.

I changed the amount of water to 1.25 C & the honey to 1/4 C, which resulted in a better loaf, in my opinion, because I had a nice crust that I didn't "have" to give to the dog.  (He still got some; they own us, you know.)  The crust was obviously there, but it wasn't rock-hard.  And when the machine told me the bread was finished baking, I immediately opened the machine & sprayed the top of the loaf with cooking oil, then shut the lid & let the loaf cool as usual until it was cool enough to handle.  Then (also as usual) I removed the loaf from the machine & put it in a plastic bag to finish cooling.  Got a nice loaf with beautiful crumb & crust.  I'm happy.

This is a good recipe, but it states that it makes 1-1 pound loaf.  My breadmaker was for 2 or 3 pounds and so I doubled it.  It was way too much for the breadmaker, so it makes me think this recipe is actually for 1-2 pound loaf.  Also, I tried the amount of honey doubled from 1/4 c. as some suggest, and we found it too sweet.  We would probably keep the honey as suggested in the original recipe.  Otherwise, a good recipe.

This recipes give a nice, good textured bread with very little effort.  Nice flavor.  I use the dough cycle on my bread machine, then rise and bake outside of the machine.

Very nice.  A light, slightly sweet, whole wheat bread.  I loved it and bf thought it was good, which automatically makes it a 5 star in this household (bf is not a ww fan).  I was worried the dough might be too wet (having issues the last few days--snowy & cold here so I think the humidity is up, which can make dough too wet) but it wasn't a problem at all.  I made the dough in the bread machine but baked in the oven at 375 for 50 minutes.  Turned out wonderfully.  Thanks for the recipe.

Like, not love.  It made a small loaf.  Next time I might add some wheat gluten and see if I get more rise out of it.  Thanks for sharing.

I increased the honey as per suggestion from other viewers - was a big hit in my house, many ate this bread like cake or desert.  My husband a diabetic could detect the sweetness, but everyone else just thought it was a good hearty bread with great texture.

This bread had really good flavor. My kids loved it. This has become my #1 bread machine recipe.  I did have a hard time getting it to rise tho, and ended up needing to add gluten flour the second time I made it and it rose nicely for me.

Sorry, didn't like this one. Suprised at all the wonderful reviews. It really didn't have much taste at all. Definitely needs more salt. I did increase the honey to 1/4 cup after reading the reviews, but even that didn't help in the flavor department. It was really lacking something. I prefer the other honey whole wheat bread on this site.

I got a new bread machine and this was the first loaf of bread (after 2 other failed recipes) that turned out great!  Although I did what other reviewers suggested, using 1/4 cup of honey and used 2 tbls of butter instead of veg oil.  Thank you for sharing!

Wonderful recipe! I live at 6500 ft. elevation and didn't have to change a thing. I did use the "Rapid" cycle instead of the "Wheat" cycle because the longer cycle doesn't seem to work in the altitude. This bread was a good combination of light texture and still having the benefits of the whole wheat. It came out of the machine just when the grandkids arrived and it was a real hit! I will be using it again for sure. Thanks!

I made this bread for the first time today. It came out perfect. Great flavor, nice texture and good crust,  only problem is my husband keeps eating slices of it and he needs to lose weight. I increased salt to 1 tsp and added an extra tablespoon of honey. Easy and delicious.

Turned out really well. Did up the salt to 1 tsp, but added 1/4 cup honey (as per other reviews) which made it a little too sweet.Will definately make again, with 3 tbsp of honey only. I don't have bread machine, so made it by hand. Texture was great, didn't have the crumbly effect. Thanks alot!!

Wonderful recipe!  I used the dough cycle on my bread machine and made sandwich rolls.  Like many of the reviewers I added more salt--3/4 teaspoon, but kept the honey at 3 tablespoons as I prefer a more subtle flavor.

5 stars when it's hot!  Great bread, makes great toast - but goes stale too quickly.  I like to slice thin and use for sandwiches, but you need to use the whole loaf within a couple days or it's dry.  I use this recipe at least once or twice a week.

The bread turned out really great! I did as others did and used 2 cups wheat flour, 1 cup bread flour, and added a little extra honey. Next time I won't add the extra honey because in my opinion it didn't need the extra.

I made this recipe exactly as directed (as I feel it's how it should be reviewed before "tweaks" are made). It's good, but a little on the dense side, but I find Whole Wheat bread is typically on the dense side.  As for tweaks?-Perhaps it would come out fluffier with 1/2 the yeast, and letting it sit out for 12-18 hours to rise before baking.

I made this bread yesterday, and it turned out really well.  I made some changes after reading other reviews.  I used 1/4 cup honey, 3/4 tsp. salt, 2 cups whole wheat flour, 1 cup bread flour.  Next time I will try substituting butter for the oil.  Also, the reviewer with the 9 month old son should be aware that it is not safe for children under 1 year old to consume honey!

I don't have a bread maker, but I wanted to try this anyway, so I just followed the traditional bread method and subbed in these ingredients.  I upped the salt to 1 tsp and used 1 cup milk (the other 2 tbsp of water I used to soften the yeast).  I also added an egg and used margarine.  This bread has a really good flavour and texture.  I baked at 350F for about 40 minutes.

I've made this bread a few different ways over the past two months. As stated, adding 1T vital gluten, using all wheat flour, adding wheat germ and/or flax seeds, extra honey, rapid rise or active yeast... Each time I've had great results. It's a very versatile recipe that has become our daily bread. I change the servings to 20 for a 2Lb loaf, then after the 2nd rise in my bread machine I split the dough to make 2-1Lb loaves, do rise #3 in the barely warmed oven, and bake in the oven at 350 for 30min. After they've cooled, I freeze one, and slice/use the other for sandwiches. No more store bought bread for this house!!!

This recipe was only the 2nd recipe I had used with my new bread machine, and OMG... it was wonderful (expect if over rose). The consistency is light are airy and I love the flavor and texture. I followed recipe exactly expect I used all purpose flour because I usually only make whole wheat loaves and that is what I had on hand. And it worked! Yummy!

These are the changes I made; honey 1/4 cup, salt to 1 tsp, 1 cup white wheat, 1 cup rye flour, and 1 cup white bread flour. It was good plain but I think it will taste much better as a sandwich. I really liked the texture.

With a few modifications this recipe makes and EXCELLENT loaf of bread.  I changed the recipe size to 15 servings which made a perfect 2 lb loaf.  Based off that change I made the following modifications:  I added extra honey, I'm not sure exactly how mch, but it was more than the recipe called for, I would add it to suit your tastes.  I also added extra salt, all the other bread recipes I make call for a ratio of one packet or 2 1/4 tsp yeast to 1 1/12 tsps salt, so thats what I used.  I also changed the ratio of flour to 2/3 wheat flour and 1/3 bread flour so that I got more of a wheat bread than a white wheat bread.  The bread is perfect, it has a soft but not too soft texture with an excellent crust, the taste is also perfect!  It looks just like the bread I'd buy from the store, but at a fraction of the price and a much better taste.

I haven't tried the original recipe, only the modified version with increased honey and modified flour measures. I also modified it to 2 tsp yeast for a fluffier loaf, and added 1/4 cup soft white wheat berries to produce a honey wheat berry recipe, and it was delicious!

I also used the other reader's suggestions of 1 tsp salt, 2 T butter, and 1/4 cup honey on the dough setting, then punch down and rise.  It's my first successful bread, and I am now in love with my machine- I made four loaves today!  This recipe works with almost any combo of grain, including oat and potato (Those don't rise much though). For ww grain, I added Italian seasonings & garlic with the ingredients, and topped with cheese before baking- that was amazing!  This is an excellent recipe!

Our new everyday bread recipe.  I have to make all of our bread due to allergies and this is fantastic.  My husband says it's the best yet (and I have tried a lot of recipes).  I upped the servings to 14 so I could bake this in a pullman loaf pan.  It was perfect -  and it made  beautiful, thin slices despite its softness.  The only change I made was to up the honey to 1/4 cup.  I also mixed it in my stand mixer and kneaded it with the dough hook and then did a normal rise, punch down, shape and put into bread pan and let rise again.  I baked at 350 for about 40 minutes.  

I love this recipe!

Great recipe! I made some adjustments to the salt measurement (I like a little bit more) and depending on my mood I use more or less of the whole wheat flour.

I made this bread just as the recipe says and my 18 yr. old son asked me to make another loaf just for him!  I did rub the entire crust with marg. as soon as it came out and wrap it in clear wrap.  This makes it easier to slice. It is Great!

My absolute FAVORITE!  My family can eat a loaf in a day and I'm happy it's relatively healthy.  I do 4 or more TBSP honey, though - makes it taste wonderful.  Perfectly moist bread.

Looking for tasty ways to try whole wheat bread, I thought I'd try this recipe. Though it was a nice loaf, it is not whole wheat as the name claims. In fact, this recipe calls for half regular bread flour.  I'll keep looking for a whole wheat version.

I've been on a bread baking binge recently using an old bread machine my mom gave me.  Anyway, the last wheat bread I made was so dry.  This one was awesome!  The only change I made was upping the honey to 1/4 cup as suggested in some of the other reviews.  This smelled delicious and tasted even better!  I will definitely be making this one again!  Soft and moist wheat bread....who'd have known!  :)

This was a great recipe, though I did modify it based on other suggestions. I used 2 cups wheat and 1 cup bread flour, 4 TBS honey, 1 tsp salt, and 2 tsp gluten. I also used 2 1/4 tsp of the yeast and used my bread maker's rapid wheat cycle for a 1.5 pound loaf with a light crust. This was the 2nd loaf I have ever made and my family and I loved it.

As suggested, I increased the honey to 4 T and the salt to 3/4 tsp but left everything else the same.  It is soft and delicious!  Just what I have been looking for.  This bread will be made often in my house.  Thanks!

This was really delicious bread, especially right out of the oven with butter. I upped the honey and salt as per other reccomendations. This will be my staple recipe for my son who is allergic to dairy and soy.

I didn't care for the texture of the bread. I think my whole wheat flour was too grainy, there must be diffent types of whole wheat flour. I will try again with all purpose flour instead of the bread flour. I also used more honey. That was good.

Fantastic healthy bread!  My kids (and husband) love it!  I like a traditionally shaped loaf, so I take mine out of the bread machine and bake it in the oven... comes out perfect every time!

Love It!  This recipe is absolutely perfect just the way it is. I have a big family of boys and I make about 10 loaves of this bread a week and they can't get enough.

Was a nice recipe, I like a different recipe for honey wheat bread on the site better though.  I mixed it in the stand mixer and kneaded for about 10 min, let it rise for about an hour, punched it down and let it rise for 40 min and baked it on pizza stones.  Came out with a crisy crust

Really good.  I put some raisins in my.  It is a good thick, chewy texture.  Made really good peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

The texture was great, but the bread seemed to really be lacking in flavor. Not quite sure why . . . maybe next time I should add more honey. At any rate, not a recipe that I'm dying to make again anytime soon.

I have been trying different bread recipes in my bread machine for the last month. This has been my favorite by far. My family loves it. It is so delicious. I used the 1/4 cup of honey like a lot of other viewers and 1 tsp of salt.

I'm having a devil of a time. Both runs yesterday, two different half 'n half WW and AP flour, both loaves I used 1 t of Vital Wheat Gluten per Cup of flour. First recipe called for regular white granular sugar, second had honey, (3 T) for the sweetner. First loaf programmed 1 Lb, Med Crust, White Bread. Second loaf I used 1 Lb, Light Crust, & White Bread. Both loaves tops collapsed in last 15 minutes of baking cycle. I don't need this much French Toast, Bread Crumbs, or Bread Pudding. I also need more ideas for what to use failed breads for. Is there a general reason why ABM Bread collapses? I never had this happen with "oven bakes". Please help!! Maybe next time I will just follow the recipe exactly. TIA

Cheers,
OTRPU

This is a very tasty loaf! I am a novice breadmachine user, and this is the only "repeat" recipe so far, despite the fact that I failed to note the yield is for a 1 lb loaf, and was making it using the 1.5 lb setting on machine. My loaves have looked a little odd because of this, but they have still tasted wonderful. I also increased the honey, salt and did 2 cups of whole wheat and 1 cup of bread flour.

Wonderful!  I added extra honey and salt and it came out sweet enough to be a "breakfast" bread.  We haven't even gotten around to toasting it yet, my husband and I just eat it as is.

This is proof that sometimes simpler is better!! This made a delicious soft wholesome loaf of bread with just a very little bit of sweetness added.  The whole family LOVED it and I will use this recipe daily!
Thanks for sharing! =)

I am new to bread making and have only made 3 loaves.  This recipe was great!  It was very easy to follow with common ingredients.  It took longer in my bread machine than given cook time, about 4 hours.  I will make this again, soon.  Thanks.
