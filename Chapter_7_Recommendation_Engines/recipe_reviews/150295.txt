This is 5 stars if you let the beans bake til hard and crunchy! This will take over an hour. Check them every 20 minutes and shake the tray to let them dry evenly. I seasoned mine to suit my own taste. I coated the beans with the olive oil then sprinkled them with seasoned salt, garlic powder, onion powder, a pinch of cayenne pepper and about 1/2 tsp. of smoked paprika. With these seasonings and baking them til they were hard and crunchy, made this taste like you were eating crispy fried chicken skin! So good!

I was nervous this would be too garlic-y, but the taste is delicious!  I added about 1/4tsp coriander as well.  I baked mine in a small glass pyrex dish and the beans stayed a little soft, making the texture and flavor enjoyable.  This is a great fiber-rich food for any gluten-free dieters.

omg this was soo good! I've made recipes like this before and found the beans to be really dry. so i decided to cook the beans in a pot first till they got soft. then i drained them and followed the directions for preparing them. i used my own blend of spices. then i put them in a 375 degree oven for 45 min. they came out crunchy and fabulous! some of them were crunchy all the way through and tasted like french fries! the other ones were crunchy on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside. yummm! these are my new go to snack! love them!

These were tasty.  I may have done something wrong though because they were not crunch at all.  I'm not sure if they should be.  But, these are nice as a side dish.

These are really tasty!  After baking for 60 minutes and omitting the feta & thyme, we really enjoyed them.  They're great to eat as little snacks or on a salad.  We can't wait to try them in tacos, too.  Thanks!

It was strange at first (never had crunchy garbanzo beans before!) but with every bite it became more and more delicious!  Now I crave these and make a batch every week for snacking.  Love the healthy factor!  So far I like it best with salt, garlic powder and curry powder!

I didn't bake this in the oven due to lack of time.  I made it on top of the stove using the same ingredients except for the olive oil and the roasted garlic.  I used dried minced garlic instead.  That is why I only gave it four stars.  It was delicious.  I will be making this again but just the way the recipe is written and then I decide which way I like it best.  Thank you for this great side dish.

I didn't really like this recipe straight from the oven. It wasn't crunchy enough. I did like it a lot better when they were cooled, although they still weren't crunchy enough. I would try it again but I would try cooking them longer. I would also omit the feta cheese if I was just eating them as a snack.

Very good.  Had to substitute toasted garlic for roasted since I had that on hand, and parm for feta.  Hubby loved it.  Next time I think I'll try something else in place of the cumin, though.

These can be tooled with and made so many different ways-- different tastes, crispiness, etc. I like them to still be a little moist, and they taste like roasted & spiced potatoes to me!

I pressed 2 cloves of garlic and let it bake with the beans instead of using roasted garlic. 
I served these on top of a romaine salad with onions and raw zuccini. The dressing was a mixture of lemon juice and olive oil. The flavor intensity was yum-o.

I cooked these about 40 minutes or so and then after adding the feta and thyme, tossed some of the garbanzos with whole wheat penne and some sauteed spinach,onions and diced peppers for a simple dinner for myself.

At first I thought these were a little boring.  Then after I couldn't stop eating them I was trying to think of different spice combinations I could try next time.  I did have to bake them for quite a while too.  Next time I'm thinking BBQ flavor?

I've made garbanzo beans somewhat like this before but never used fetta cheese...didn't use it this time either (not appealing).   Just thought I'd list some of the other ingredients I used to make them more flavorful: SALT! (I can't believe no one mentioned this) Season salt, lemon juice, oregano, onion flakes, seasoned pepper and seasame oil for a nice roasted flavor...in addition to olive or grape seed oil. I personally prefer grape seed oil over olive as it has a higher burn point for cooking, fyi.

This was a great way for me to use up my chickpeas.  I probably should've drained & rinsed my beans better.  It took quite a while for the beans to get crunchy- at least an hour.  But, end result was great!

This was the first time i have experienced garbanzo beans outside of a pre-prepared hummus (which I love) .  I opened them from the can and tasted them.  I nearly ate the can right then.  I reduced the olive oil to 1 tablespoon and only used 2 cloves since I knew the garlic we had on hand was very hot.  I love these.  I could only wait 10 minutes before taking them out of the oven, but i tend to like things not piping hot so they were absolutely perfect!

Line pan with foil.  I spray with PAM, add curry powder, chili powder, roll it all around together.  Oven at 400, check at 40 minutes.  The crisp curry flavor is dynamite.  Lightly salt if you prefer, but not necessary.  Yum!  And minimum carbs vs fiber vs protein for the type IIs.

I agree with most of the other reviewers......cook them until they're crunchy and eat them as a snack.  I tried them first exactly as the recipe suggests and they were okay.  I tried cooking them for longer and found that the oven was too hot at 350 and the beans started to pop and burn.  I tried them again except I added a little extra seasoning and then I lowered the temp to 250 and cooked them for a little over an hour......fantastic!  This is the only way I make these now!  Flavorful, filling, healthy, crunchy and satisfying!

Tweaked to my personal preferences - can't do spicy so I did garlic salt and cumin and took the advice of others and cooked longer until they were crunchy. At 325 convection baking that took about 30 minutes.

How many calories per serving? Tasted great as substitute for bread cubes  in soups and salads. Just about anything.

I must have fouled up somewhere, the beans were pasty and flavorless. I put them back into the oven for a little bit and they became gravel. Needs tweaking!

I cook these for about forty five minutes to make crispier.  I make them about once a week.

I make this as a last minute side dish all the time. There's lots of room for variation in the recipe too, so I can pair it with lots of different entrees. Love it!
