If you are using a mix of ground meats, I like equal parts beef, pork, and either chicken or turkey.

This recipe makes for a generous 8 servings. Plan on cooking once and eating twice or thrice! To freeze the leftovers, put it in a large sealable plastic bag. This will keep it nice and thin so that it will defrost easily.

If you have a large enough pot, the recipe can be doubled and you will have lots of bolognese in your freezer. Just give some extra time to each of the steps. 15 minutes for the meat, about 40 minutes for the milk and wine, and at least 5 hours for the simmer.

Also, if you are doubling it, 4 cups is more than one bottle of wine. I just pour the bottle in and call it good rather than opening another for just a little wine.
