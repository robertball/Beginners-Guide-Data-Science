This is an excellent marinade. I omitted all the directions...instead I mixed up the ingredients and put them in a large plastic bag..didn't cook ingredients first. I marinated the chicken for 4 hours. Then I baked it in a 425 oven for 45 minutes in the marinade (per another reviewer)...I didn't bother to baste it...it turns a beautiful golden brown. I removed the ginger before baking. Also, instead of crushing the garlic, I diced it up really small...yum! One thing I will do next time is put foil in the pan that I'm baking in...makes cleanup much easier. This is very moist and tender.

I give this one 5 stars.  I thought it was a very easy recipe and resulted in an excellent asian grilled chicken.  Reminded me of an Japanese restaraunt I used to go to in downtown LA.  I made everything per the recipe, except I doubled the marinade.  This left me plenty for basting and drizzling.  I also sprinkled sesame seeds on the sliced chicken.  I served over Jasmine rice.  Highly recommended.

This recipe was alright, but lacked the true bento flavor I was after.  I made a few changes: doubled the marinade, marinaded overnight and cooked on the stove top.  I also recommend using sodium reduced soy sauce as it was very salty.  I will not be making this again.

Wow. That's all I can say.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I ended up adding green onions to the chicken.  I cooked it in a skillet with a tbsp of oil over high heat.  It is sooo good, and even with the soy sauce, it's not really all that salty.  I served it with jasmine rice and some Wendjoe chilli pasta (hot chile sauce).  Next time I'll steam some broccoli to go with it.  So awesome.

The whole family loved it.. and I mean the WHOLE family all 9 of us! So far this has been the summer grilling favorite! The longer you marinate the better it taste! I definatly recommend pounding the chicken and not grilling for more than 10min very moist!! 

If you have leftovers there great chopped up in a salad!
Thanks Janet!!

This had a subtle, nicely balanced flavor, but only after I fiddled with the marinade a bit.  First, I used about half the amount of soy sauce called for.  I know how it can permeate delicately flavored chicken and it could potentially have made it too salty as well.  Half the amount was the right amount.  Second, the type of sesame oil was not specified, and it should be.  Does the submitter intend the light, cold-pressed sesame oil used for salads and for frying?  Or did she intend the boldly flavored *toasted" sesame oil, used for flavor, usually not more than a dribble in ANY dish?  I just used my own judgment, using the light sesame oil for the most part and just a little of the rich, brown, toasted sesame oil for its wonderful flavor.  Ginger root is not something I use often so I rarely buy it (and I'm not terribly fond of it anyway).  A light pinch of ground ginger sufficed.  The honey was a nice addition, giving the chicken a beautiful glazed appearance once it came off the grill.  The chicken was tender and moist, but I credit Hubs' expertise with grilling for that!  Served with Classic Fried Rice and Easy Bok Choy, this was a delicious, darned near memorable meal, and beautiful in its presentation. (Note: I didn't see heating the marinade ingredients as necessary, so I didn't bother with that step. I just used the easier, more common method of just dumping everything into a Ziploc bag.  I marinated the chicken as the submitter recommended, about 15 minutes)

Please follow the recipe to the T the first time you make it. I really hate when people rate recipes that they have changed in any way. I loved the recipe!! The only change I made was letting the chicken sit in the marinade a bit longer.

Great and easy recipe. I added a little brown sugar also. I made it with "Betsy's Mandarin Orange Salad" and "Sesame Broccoli Salad" all very good.

This marinade was such a hit!  My boyfriend and his son declared it the best chicken they ever had.  He said it put his own grilled chicken to shame (and his is really good!).  We liked it so much that I made it again the very next night with pork chops.  Still very good - but I think I liked it with chicken better.  I will make this again and again.

Very good! I marinated this for 7 hours and boiled the left over marinade to use as a sauce. Served with grilled pineapple, which was perfect! Even better on salmon the next day.

Excellent marinade! I doubled the marinade sauce except for the sesame oil, which I kept the same, at 4 tsp. The sesame oil already has a strong flavor so I did not want it overpowering all of the other ingredients. I normally don't add slices of ginger to a marinade, I grate the fresh ginger root for a more ginger flavor in the sauce. To the sauce I added 3 cloves of garlic, crushed and also diced. I did not heat up the sauce in a pot as I chose to put it in a ziplock bag. Lastly I added about 2 to 3 Tablespoons of the honey, to taste.  I did not want it too sweet but enough to balance out the other ingredients. I poked holes in the thickest part of the chicken breasts with a fork and placed the chicken in the bag to marinate all day.  Instead of grilling, I threw them into a casserole dish along with the sauce. I baked the chicken at 400 degrees for 25 minutes. Very easy to put together with mouth watering results! I had tender, juicy chicken breasts. The meat was not dry or tough. The sauce was so delicious and balanced with a hint of ginger-not overpowering at all. I poured the sauce all over my rice - that is the way I like it. To complement my meal, I served this with, "Betsy's Mandarin Orange Salad," and "Sesame Broccoli Salad," all from this website, (all tasty salads by the way).

Quick to make and very delicious.  The chicken ended up marinating for 30-45 min.  I used 1/2 tsp of ginger powder because I did not have fresh ginger, but that is the only change I made.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Delicious! I'm an apartment dweller though, so couldn't follow the directions (ie grilling) exactly. Instead, I marinated the chicken overnight and then baked it while simmering the leftover marinade (I had doubled the amount because I like it saucy ;) to pour over the chicken, which I served on a bed of rice. Quick, easy and pays off bigtime!

Thank you for adding flavour to my dinner table. My husband liked it so much he just mmmmed the whole meal. This is what I did: Chicken cut into square inches before marinating for 30+ min. Added 2 tbs rice vinegar to sauce before microwaving. 1tsp of ground Ginger instead of fresh. Cooked on stove top, less than 10 min on medium heat, chicken first then added rest of sauce last 5 min. Incredible. More please.

A great recipe because it was super easy AND super tasty.  I only made some slight modifications:  I used diced garlic and grated ginger and also forked the chicken several times to allow seepage of the tasty juices into the meat.  I then baked the chicken (covered) for ~45 minutes at 350 degrees, then uncovered the chicken and baked it for 5 or 10 minutes more to let it brown up.  Then, I diced it all up and used it in a bean thread-based chicken recipe.  Super delish!

This recipe is easy but the dish tastes phenomenal. I would also suggest following the directions of the first person who left a comment (itzjust_me). Mix all the ingredients together and marinade the chicken for a few hours. Then bake it. AND put aluminium foil on the pan, otherwise the marinade will stick to the pan and it'll take you half an hour to get it out.

Very nice marinade! I used low sodium soy sauce, 1 tsp. of fresh minced ginger, 1 tsp. fresh chopped garlic. I didn't cook the marinade like the recipe called for. I marinaded the chicken for about an hour before throwing it on the grill. Would definitely make it again!

I'm giving it 5 stars, even though I messed up a little.  Like another reader - go with low sodium soy sauce or it will end up too salty.  I went with regular, but tasted it and just added an extra 1/4 cup of water a splash of rice vinegar and some extra honey (which also made up for my over ginger and garlic - I used the store bought minced kind for both and tried to estimate).  So in other words - you can double the sauce, but I would add water instead of extra soy sauce.  I also was doing this last minute and had no time to marinate.  It was a lighter flavor, but still very good.

Very good asian chicken, although the soy sauce can give it a salty taste. I added more honey on my chicken, after it was done cooking to make it more flavorful. I did not have ginger root available; so instead I used powdered ginger in place of it. I also used garlic powder instead of cloves, but overall it was good. What is also great about this recipe is, no additional seasoning are needed on the chicken. Awesome combination of ingredients to give the chicken a wonderful taste!!! I also substituted boneless chicken breast instead of bone-in chicken.

Thank you Janet!  I love this marinade.  After tasting how delicious it was on chicken, the next night I made salmon using this marinade - - - as I ate a bite, my mouth watered for the next bite!  The only subtle change that I made, was to grate the ginger root instead of using slices (used 1 Tbsp of grated ginger root).

Absolutely delicious. Other than using reduced sodium soy sauce, I made it exactly as listed and it was unbelievably tasty. I've made it quite frequenty lately since so many friends and relatives request it. Truly yummy. :)

this was fantastic! my husband who is the pickiest eater in the world and one who will not compliment my cooking unless he truly means it said "this is the best chicken you've ever made". i did poke the chicken and let it marinate for an hour before cooking. i cut the chciken after grilling, served it over brown rice, and brushed a little more sauce on the chicken after cooking it.

This was so good!  I doubled the marinade and added a couple extra crushed garlic cloves to the marinade. While the marinade was simmering my 10 year old shouted "it smells sooo good!" My 18 year old said it was the best chicken he has ever had.  My husband said he could eat it everyday. We had it with rice and steamed broccoli. BIG HIT :)

Fantastic! Probably one of the most tender, flavorful dishes I've made with boneless chicken breasts.  I couldn't believe how much the marinade soaked through to the meat...delicious.

Overall, this is a great and fast/easy recipe!  You'll definitely like the taste of the sauce!  (It's a bit easy to overcook the sauce, so be careful!)

Next time, I will let marinade overnight. I didn't think the flavor was very intense and would have liked to have had it stronger. Think this was because it didn't marinate that long. Still pretty easy to throw together.

Super easy to make - since I had the time, I marinated mine for 4 hours and it did have great flavor.  I will always marinate this for at least 2 hours.

This was awesome.  I pounded the chicken to about 1/4 of an inch, as someone else had suggested.  I also brushed some marinade on yellow, red, and orange peppers and then grilled in a basket on the grill!  Yum!!!

I've made this several times now, and it is just delicious.  It is a hit with my husband and I both.  For best flavor, you want to marinate all day, and be sure to baste with the marinade several times while grilling.

After reading the ingredients of this recipe, I just knew it would be a winner, and boy was I right.  I didn't make any changes other than marinating the meat longer than 15 minutes.  After the chicken was done, I sliced it and added it to a bag of frozen stir fry veggies with noodles that I had cooked already and it came out great.  My husband and stepson gave it two thumbs up and told me they definitely want it again.

I used a teaspoon of powdered Jamaican ginger because I had no fresh but it didn't matter, the chicken was juicy and delicious right off my grill! I followed the directions and am cooking the leftover sauce to have the next day with leftover chicken.

Great recipe.  Asian styled flavor.  Everyone loved it and it turned out nice and juicy on the grill.  Did a couple of things different.  Didnt quite have enough soy sauce (low sodium) so I added some fish sauce and oyster sauce to keep the saltiness up without adding a whole lot of kosher salt.  i think the addition of those two things helped round out the flavor.  Only thing I would do different next time is to cook the marinade longer so that it is really thick so it will adhere to the chicken better.  Otherwise great quick dinner and I didnt make a huge mess, for which my wife is eternally grateful!

I was looking for a quick chicken marinade with ingredients I had on hand.  I didn't have a lot of time to marinade it like most recipes call for.  This was a great recipe!  It had good flavor and I had everything on hand.  The only things I changed were to used ground ginger, I added extra garlic(we love garlic) and some sliced onions.  I used three big Costco chicken breast, butterflied and this was the perfect amount of marinade.  I put all the ingredients into a freezer bag and put the chicken in the bag and into the fridge for about 3 hours, turning it every so often. It was so juicy and had really good flavor. My husband grilled it for about 4 minutes on each side and it came out perfect!  It was even good the next day heated in the microwave on 50% over white rice.  Not dry at all.  Thanks for sharing.  This will definitely be going into our monthly rotation.

This is the best Asian-style chicken I have ever tasted! I used brown sugar instead of honey and added Chinese five spice. I used this in Chicken Fried Rice II and it was the best! Thanks Janet!

I took the advise of the other reviewers, and marinated it for about 4 hours. As I deforested the chicken in the microwave, I put the marinade in a pot and let it simmer for a few min. Then I put it in to a large zip lock bag, and ,marinated it for about 4 hours. I then dumped the hole thing in to a pan. Marinade and all, and baked it at 425 for about 45 min. It was amazing, and even my picky son eat it. And thats saying a lot. Also I didn't have fresh ginger I used powdered.

Very good! I use this all the time when I need a last minute meal. I use my George Foreman grill and baste it occasionally, and it's ready in minutes. I LOVE the flavor and aroma of this dish - but best of all, the easy prep:) THANKS!

The perfect last-minute marinade!  Very yummy.  I substituted peanut oil and pickled ginger for the sesame oil and fresh ginger.... no problems.  Great taste, fast and easy to prepare... and no leftovers, even with two toddlers!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is really delicious. I find that using a low-sodium soy sauce cuts down on the saltiness, desirable for me.

I thought this chicken marinade was awesome.  I was able to marinade the chicken breast for about an hour and then placed them on the grill.  I also used "shallots" (please note the change from previous review), unstead of garlic because that's what I had on hand.  This was an excellent meal served with the Tasty Green Beans (also on this web site) over rice.  A nice taste of the Orient!

This was so good! I added red pepper flakes and a little bit of teriyaki and hoisin sauce.  Also, I used ground ginger as I did not have any fresh on hand. Next time, I will pound the chicken to get more flavor in every bite.  I love this marinade as it's something that you don't have to prepare hours ahead of time.

This was excellent.  I will be making it again and again.  The color and flavor were a treat, and my guests loved it.  (For even cooking, pound your chicken breasts to a 1/4 inch whenever you grill.)

This is my go-to marinade for Asian-style chicken. I make the marinade as directed and marinate chicken thighs for 48 hours before freezing. When it's time to make them, I just thaw and grill. It's as good as going to a restaurant!

TIP: Make a little extra marinade to drizzle over the cooked chicken & rice -- you won't be sorry you did!

It needs something, but on its own it tastes pretty good. 
I did it in the oven for about 30 minutes or so on 350. I doubled the recipe when I did this so the juice covered the chicken. yum yum. served with rice

Very good!  A little saltier than I would've liked but delicious nonetheless.  I served it alongside an Asian medley steamed veggies (snow peas, carrots, baby corns, broccoli).  Hubby was happy, I was happy.  Will definitely make this again, but try to cut back on the soy sauce (which may have been my own fault.. I'll update next go-around).

Tried this just yesterday.
Really good! I didn't have any sesame oil so instead I used ground sesame seeds. It still turned out amazing.
I highly recommend it!

Quick and easy to put together. Very moist. I used low sodium soy sauce and 1t. ginger from a jar. My kids loved it. Next time I would like to marinate longer.

Great flavors just verrrrry salty, would use a low-sodium soy sauce or just cut it in half and replace with water or stock.  Possibly because I did it on the stove top rather than the grill as well.  Probly won't make again unles major adjustments made.

We did really like this and it was extremely moist and tender.  I want to tweek this recipe a little as I feel it was still missing something.

Added a little extra acid to compensate for saltiness (i used lime juice but rice wine would work just as well). added some green onions because I had them around. I cooked on stove top and will defiantly do this one again, perhaps in a stir fry style with snow peas

I followed the recipe exactly except I marinated it for 5 hours instead of 15 min. and I cut each cutlet into 3 strips before marinating.I found it to be good, but I thought it would have much more flavor.I served this with " House Fried Rice" (a recipe from this site).I think next time I will cut up the chicken into bite sized pieces after grilling and mix it in with the fried rice to give it more flavor.

I made this last night and it was DELICIOUS!  My boyfriend who claims he doesn't like chicken had 2 helpings and took the leftovers for lunch.  I did cut back on the sesame seed oil and also used ground ginger instead of fresh ginger root.  I did not bother cooking the marinade first.  I simply stired the ingredients together in a bowl and then poured it over the breasts in a zip lock bag. I also sliced the breast into smaller strips, as was suggested, and marinated for about 30 min.  I cooked mine on my Foreman Grille and it was so moist and flavorful.  Will definitely make this again!

WOW!  I made this for a quick and easy dinner for my husband and kids and it was a success without altering or changing anything.  I did it as per the recipe and only added Salt before pouring the marinade over the chicken breasts.  I did however let the chicken breast marinate for over an hour only because my husband hadn't arrived from work yet.  The chicken breasts were extremely moist and succulent.  Will definately make it again.  Enjoy!

Very tender and easy. I did do as several others suggested. I 1) added 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes 2) marinated for several hours and 3) doubled the marinade. Everyone in the family liked it but it needs something else to give it an additional "kick", to use one reviewers description. I highly recommend this recipe. You can get it marinating in the morning and throw it on the grill in the evening.

YUM!!!  You definitely need to marinade for at least an hour to get the best flavor.  We also used burnt sesame oil which really added to it!!  Every time I make this now I always make extra--makes a great lunch when cut up and added to a green salad.  (Cooks really fast when you pound out the chicken to one thickness.)

This was awesome.  I have to admit that at first I was a bit afraid that the sauce was going to be too overpowering, but I did add the couple of teaspoons of brown sugar, too.  But this turned out AMAZING!  My hubby and very finicky kids loved it, too. 

After I marinated the chicken I made another batch of the sauce with a bit more brown sugar and leaving out the ginger and garlic.  I put the ginger and garlic in a skillet and sauted that then put in about four or five tsp of the rest of the sauce.  I then stir fried red and green peppers, mushrooms, celery, and onion. I put a few tsp of corn starch in the rest of the sauce then poured it over the veggies and finished cooking.  I cooked them until a bit brown and carmelized (I like it this way).  I served this and the chicken with rice and yum, yum, yum!

I gave this recipe such a high rating because it was so simple, quick, and flavorful.  I only marinated the chicken for 1 hour, and the meat really took on its flavor.  I did add a little brown sugar because the marinade seemed a little salty to me.  Next time I will use low sodium soy sauce.  Definitely will make again.

This was okay. I marinated for a full hour and the taste was still something to be desired. Perhaps a longer marinade time will increase the flavor? However, the chicken was VERY moist and tender. Our grill is having problems in this cold weather so I was forced to use the broiler..and they turned out fine. IF I make this again, I'll try a day's worth in the marinade and see if the flavor improves.

This is delicious.  I love seseme oil in anything, but the surprising thing was how much my kids liked it!  We didn't have fresh ginger in the house, so my husband the cook just skipped it and it was still great!

Very quick & easy, good to put together when it's too hot to cook. I marinated for a couple hours and did not baste, the chicken stayed incredibly moist and the outside got a beautiful color. However, this recipe was missing something, it was very bland. The flavors went well together without being overpowering, but it didn't impress me as a flavorful recipe. I probably won't make it again as I have other Asian style marinades that have more "punch".

I made this chicken with skewered chicken strips for a Memorial Day weekend BBQ party - Heavenly!!!  Funny thing was a friend also made chicken skewers but with a different marinade - mine went in about 15 minutes and an hour later there were still a bunch of her chicken left on the buffet table.  Even she admitted these were the best!!  Thanks for a great simple recipe.  I did marinate for about 4 hours or so - yummy!

This is okay. As written the marinating time really does nothing. It was missing something to me...not exactly sure what.  
I recommend marinating for at least 4 or 6 hours.

This is a very good marinade that’s easy to prepare and flavorful.  I cut my chicken breasts into medallions and pounded them to a uniform thickness.  I marinated them for an hour and a half but would add additional time the next time.   Unfortunately, because of a severe storm, I was unable to grill them but they came out wonderfully in my cast iron skillet.  Everyone enjoyed them.

Fantastic, super tasty and so easy using only 5 ingredients!  I used this marinade for mini chicken skewers when we hosted a retirement/65th birthday party.  It was a hit with the adults and kids!  I cubed all of my chicken and then put in the marinade for almost 24 hours - YUMMY!  I will use this one again NO doubt!

Great marinade. I just used minced garlic and still turned out perfect. I had little chicken tenders for this recipe, used 6 tenders for 4 servings (like the recipe calls for). Really good.

This was good, but I would DEFINITELY use low sodium soy sauce.  The salt overwhelmed the rest of the flavors.

Super easy and so flavorful.  I pounded out the chicken and only marinated for about 10-15 minutes.  I grilled and then added to the peanut butter noodle recipe on here.  Very tasty.

Great recipe! I doubled the sauce and served over rice. If you have left overs, be sure to store the chicken in the left over sauce...the flavor the next day is incredible!

I don't usually review a recipe if I don't follow it exactly, but I had to say this was great!   I screwed up & didn't cook the marinade first.  (Intended to, but I was doing batch cooking & had like 8 different marinades that day - this was the only one that was just "mix & marinade" - and I was on a roll."

Anyway - it was delicious.  Next time I will make it the right way & I have no doubt it will be even better.

This was an excellent recipe - my husband loved it! I added an extra clove of crushed garlic, and I cut up the chicken into chunks then marinated it for a full 2 1/2 hours. Instead of grilling it, I poured the marinade into a frying pan, reduced it slightly then added the chicken and cooked as normal. The taste was wonderful and well soaked into every bite. I paired it with some asian noodles tossed with some sesame oil and a little chili sauce for heat, then poured the sauce from the cooked chicken over top. Delicious!

Yum.  I cooked the chicken on the stove instead of grilling it, and it was still pretty tasty.  Served with the Quick Chinese-Style Vermicelli.

This marinade is excellent!  I did not make any changes to the recipe except to stir-fry my marinated chicken strips.  I then added them to a peanutty pasta dish and it was a very good combination.  Thank you for this recipe, it's a definite keeper!

Very teriyaki in flavor.  Ok, but we thought it needed some heat - a shake of red pepper flakes would be a nice addition.

This was good. I didn't grill it, but baked instead, 325 for about 35 minutes, and had marinated the chicken for about 7 hours. Family really liked the flavor, will make again.

I made the marinade as stated in the recipe, but only used 2 chicken breast. I also added a pinch of chili flakes, an additional glove of garlic, as well as one chopped green onion to marinade.  We still found it a bit bland so perhaps next time I make will use more garlic, ginger, chili flakes and green onion in the marinade.

Thanks for a great recipe!  By heating the marinade, the garlic and ginger release their flavors.  While it stands very well on its own, for my tastes, I did add a splash of rice vinegar to give it some acidity and siraccha sauce for spice.

Excellent marinade.  I used low sodium soy and powdered ginger, marinated for about 5 hours then discarded marinade.  Served with jasmine rice and stir fry veggies.

Great but I did what a previous reviewer suggested which was marinade the chicken in the fridge and then put to the oven. My chicken came out with a light flavor and probably needed more marinate then what was given for the size. Next time, i will cut the chicken in to slices first and then marinate to cut cooking time and also to add more flavor to the chicken. I also suggest that you might increase the amount of marinate.

Absolutely amazing! Best chicken hands down I have ever eaten. I tweaked the marinade a little bit by adding a handful of chopped green onions 1/2 tsp. of red pepper flakes to give it an extra kick. Also, I chopped the garlic up into tiny pieces instead of crushing it. I marinaded the chicken for 5 hours and then cooked it on a seasoned cast iron skillet, as per one of the reviewers suggested, at 400 degrees doing 12 minutes on each side. I then simmered the marinade until it turned a little pasty and put it ontop of some white rice. For a side, I sauteed some asparugus using sesame oil, salt & pepper, a lemon juice...mmmm. My gf is now calling me her personal chef. ;) This one is a must try!

I used what I had in the kitchen, so I just used canola oil (and added sesame seeds) and ginger powder.  We liked the recipe fine.  I marinated for 20-25 minutes.

The whole family enjoyed this chicken. The subtle and light flavor of the chicken is very good, it was not too salty.  I used 1 tsp and 1 tbsp of brown sugar liked another reviewer suggested and baked at 425 degrees in the oven.  Next time I think I will double the marinade which I think will make it even better.

I just added the ingredients to a ziploc bag and marinated the chicken for about 4 hours.  I then made another batch of the marinade and heated it to use as a sauce for the brown rice we had.  Delicious!  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

This was pretty good, but my sauce came out a little runny so it didn't stick to the chicken breasts very well.  Didn't think this chicken was that great, kind of bland and salty.  I will probably use another recipe if I want to attempt Asian chicken again.

This dish was way too salty. I thought that the other people who complanied about it being too salty just marinated it too long, but I marinated according to the recipe and it was still too salty. Needs less soy sauce.

Very good, but the soy sauce is overwhelming. I'd cut it to 3 T. or even 2. I also cut the oil in half. Powdered ginger took the place of ginger root. Family love it.

This was great and light. I also marinated for about 2 hours, then cooked the chicken in the marinade at 325 for 35 minutes. Juicy and tasty, not overpowering. A nice summer meal with rice and sauteed vegetables.

Thank you, Janet M.!  What a fantastic flavor and so quick to put together!  To speed up the marinating time and infuse the flavor I poke the chicken breasts with a knife a few times, put the chicken and marinade in a "FoodSaver" marinating container, vaccuum seal and put it in the fridge for about an hour. Awesome!  It's definitely going in the "Family Favorites" folder! P.S. I recommend the "Marinated Veggies" by Mathilda Sprey (from this site) as a side dish for this recipe...yummm!

I took it to a camp out for a family reunion.  We can add 29 reviews for EXCELLENT.  They loved it and wanted the recipes.  I recommend it.  Great grilled the first day and then cut up on an asian salad the second day!

I was very happy with this recipe. The chicken marinated for about an hour and came out juicy. I cooked it on my George Foreman then sliced it up and stir fried veggies with the leftover sauce. REALLY good.

This was a delicious way to prepare chicken.  I pan fried it and then added some Asian vegetables, it turned out great - my husband and children loved it.  I used ground ginger because it was what I had in the pantry.

The chicken turned out so moist!  I didn't have any real ginger root on hand, so I put a few dashes of ground ginger instead.  It worked great.  The chicken also turned out very pretty.  :)  Nice little grill marks.

I let this marinade over night but I think it would have been better if I had done it for 2 hours or so since it came out really strongly flavored. Over all I think it was very tasty and will defintly make again. Thanks for the recipe!

This was lovely.  I marinated for one hour before grilling and made extra marinade which I set aside to use for basting while cooking.  I didn't have any ginger root, so used a teaspoon of minced ginger from a jar.  We loved this.

My family really likes this recipe and they said they would love it in the future. I think that next time I cook it I will let the chicken marinate longer (this time I let it marinate for about 20 min) also I need to watch the grill a bit better...my chicken was a bit on the crispy side...hehe oops. 

I made the chicken with white rice!

This is a great marinade.  I made it exactly as written & it was wonderful.  I chickened out cooking the left over marinade to use it as a glaze because it had all that raw chicken in it... but it was still great.  We marinated overnight.  Very good.

This is an excellent marinade!!! I didn't have any fresh ginger, so I used 1/4 tsp of ginger powder instead. I let it marinade for about 5 hours and it had really good flavor. Thank you for a great recipe!!

We liked this.  I used chicken leg quarters and boiled them for about 20 minutes the night before since they take a little longer to cook and I don't like the blood in the bones.  I then marinated them overnight.  Next night we grilled them and they turned out great, moist and tender with a lot of flavor. Thanks for the post.

Simple and Delicious.  Marinaded boneless dark chicken leg/thighs for 3 hours and then grilled.    Tasted better than the chicken from my favorite Chinese restaurant.

You rock Janet!  I don't care for chicken but I will eat it with your wonderful marinade.  I love the fresh garlic and ginger.  In fact, the ginger slices stay on the chicken pretty well when grilled and taste so good you can eat them too.  Because of the Asian taste of it, it goes well with fried rice and a little bok choy.  Thanks for your recipe!

I fixed this the other night over on our firepit (not a gas grill or briquettes, a slow fire) and it was wonderful!   Also, regular vegetable oil worked fine in place of the sesame oil.

This recipe sounded good and we liked it but I have a few suggestions.  After microwaving the marinade pour it into a glass pie pan and casserole then the chicken.  For better flavor allow the chicken to marinade longer than 15 minutes maybe 1-2 hours.  If you can't grill it, broil or bake it.  CJS

Terrific chicken! I minced the ginger instead of adding then removing slices. I marinated the chicken in the fridge for a couple of hours then baked it in the sauce turning halfway through the cooking.

This was an excellent recipe!  I made as written, except that I used 1 T. of minced ginger instead of slices of ginger.  I always mince ginger and garlic ahead of time and freeze it, so thats what I had on hand.  I will certainly keep this yummy, simple and very easy recipe in our normal circulation.

I used liquid aminos instead of soy sauce and reduced the amount, as it's very salty and it tasted great!

Marinaded for several hours instead of 15 minutes, otherwise followed the recipe more or less exactly. Tastes great and not too hard to make, would definitely recommend.

I was looking for an easy delicious recipe tonight with ingredients I had.  This was a perfect choice.  I followed the recipe mostly.  I doubled the sauce, I only had teriyaki sauce, and I added dried onion flakes.  I used my George Forman grill, and just tossed the chicken in the left over sauce afterwards.  My little kids and husband went back for seconds.  My kids kept saying how good it was.  With it I made Jasmine rice and turned it into a simple fried rice with onion sauteed in sesame oil and 2 scrambled eggs.  I will definitely be making this again and again.  Thank you.

I've used this recipe almost weekly since I found it. My entire family loves it. I've replaced ginger root for powdered ginger at time when I did not have any ginger root and it still turned out very well. I've served this with rice, noodles and have even made salads with chicken and broccoli slaw. This recipe is quick and easy to make. I usually don't heat the marinade either.

Great marinade! Used boneless/skinless chicken thighs instead of breast since I already had those on hand and decided to marinate over night for more flavor. Works wonderful topped with green onions with a side of fried rice.

Yum!  I followed the recipe exactly regarding the ingredients.  However, I marinated all day and then baked it in the marinade. I served this with Chinese Chicken Fried Rice II from this site and steamed broccoli.  DH mixed everything together in a bowl.

I liked that the chicken did not need to marinade all day, so, I thought I would give this recipe a try.   It was ok, but, nothing special.   It seemed slightly bitter and salty to me.  It didn't seemed to have a great balance of flavor for us.  There are so many really good Asian marinade recipes out there that I don't think I will be making this again.

My family raved about this one. For 6 chicken breasts, I doubled the recipe. For the ginger, I used 3 Tbsp of jarred minced ginger and 2 tsp of jarred minced garlic. 

I didn't cook anything; I just mixed the ingredients well and poured over the chicken in a ziplock bag and let sit for about 20 hours.

Very good flavor! May marinate overnight to enhance flavor as some pieces had less flavor. Used ginger paste to make things simple.

Good.  I grilled pineapple at the same time.  Nice addition.  Don't do the microwave bit tho'.  Add'n. of lime juice to marinade gives it a bit of zing.  Depends on what you have in the fridge I suppose.  I'm always in favour of using what's on hand.

Awesome, easy & authentic tasting! I combined the ingredients & simply marinated the chicken. There isn't a need to cook the marinade before adding the meat. 
I used chicken thighs & garnished them with sesame seeds & green onions.  
I think this marinade would go well with any meat, including beef & salmon.

Well I can't follow directions and skipped the microwave step and went straight to the marinade step, but this turned out fine. The soy was a bit strong and maybe teriaki sauce would be better next time even though I used a low sodium soy sauce. I used powdered ginger and only 1 tsp. It could have used more though as I really like ginger. I used a packaged asian salad mix and then sliced this grilled chicken and placed it on top and this was as fancy and plate pretty as something you would get when dining out. I'd like sesame seeds added next time too, and maybe even some chives or green onion.

Absolutely delicious! I too omitted directions by not melting honey, just mixed all marinade ingredients with a whisk and poured over raw chicken in a ziplock bag. I grilled the chicken but didn't use remaining marinade to baste, added chicken to my veggie fried rice I had already prepped and cooked and it was AMAZING!! Very light and fresh tasting! Excellent recipe!!

Very very good grilled chicken.  Hubby couldn't stop saying how good it was.  I did marinate it for about 4 hours but otherwise changed nothing.  It was very tender and VERY juicy.  A keeper for sure.

We used a double recipe for 5 chicken breasts. Used low salt soy and added 1 tsp red pepper flakes and 1 tbsp rice wine vinegar. We used a serving fork to puncture the chicken breasts for better penetration of the marinade. Heated the marinade after boiling for 15-20 minutes to thicken and poured over white rice. It was excellent--we will be using it again

I made the entire batch of marinade for two large skinless boneless chicken breast halves. I used about 1 t. of ginger from a tube (found in the produce department) and I ended up putting in another squirt of honey because I thought the soy flavor was a bit overpowering.  I didn’t bother heating the marinade, just whisked the ingredients together and poured most of it over the chicken.  I reserved some for Hubs to baste on while grilling.  I marinated this in the refrigerator for about 4 hours.  The chicken came off the grill looking beautiful, with wonderful grill marks.  The taste, however, was disappointing after all the rave reviews.  This was ok, but I’m sorry to say we weren’t wowed by it at all.

This was tasty. We marinated the chicken for 24 hours, and after that the marinade sort of "broke" apart so that it wasn't suitable to do anything with, so I can't be 100% sure what it would have tasted like with the basting sauce. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe. I doubled the sauce (which wasn't really necessary) and broiled the chicken for about 30 minutes. Great flavor.

This made more than enough marinade for 5 chicken breasts.  Choose this recipe because I like all the ingredients and it didn't require a lot of time for marinating. Our chicken actually probably sat in it for closer to 45 minutes.   Chicken was juicy and tender and excellently flavored for every bite.

This was good, but next time I would double the marinade.  It was not much for 4 chicken breast.  I wanted to use the sauce after to put on top of the chicken and it wasn't enough.  Also, I didn't heat the sauce prior to marinading I just put it in a zip lock bag and put it in the fridge.  You might need to heat it if your only doing it for 15 minutes, but mine marinaded for a couple of hours and it was fine.  Thanks for sharing.

This is a favorite in our house! I usually double the recipe and put a little less sesame oil than a double recipe calls for.  I've made w/ chicken breasts and thighs and thighs, to me, have a better taste and stay more moist when grilled.

this was deeeelicious! we're buried under 2'+ of snow right now, and I was looking for something a little more interesting to make than soup. this fit the bill perfectly, and while we didn't get to grill it, it turned out fantastically well sauteed. I am very much looking forward to making this again, marinating it a bit longer (I did aprx 20 mins while other things were cooking) and grilling it on our charcoal grill.   the only variation otherwise that I took was mincing the garlic and ginger together to add to the sauce. mm mm mm!

This was SALTY!  I did not season the chicken with salt and I even used reduced sodium soy sauce and it was still too salty for my tastes.  Next time I might add pineapple juice and/or more honey in place of some of the soy sauce.  Thanks anyways!

Enjoyed this recipe very much!  I only used 2 chicken breasts and made the full recipe of the sauce.  Was out of fresh ginger and had to substitute crushed ginger.  I marinated the chicken for about 2 hours, then cut it into strips and cooked with veggies as a stir-fry over rice.  Looking forward to grilling it next time!

I registered just so I could rate this recipe. This was just SO, SO good! It was so quick and so easy, you almost can't believe it came out this well. I used a foil-covered griddle pan on my stove top to cook the chicken, and when it was the colour I wanted on the outside, I covered the top with more foil and took it off the heat so it would gently steam until done. Delicious! It was moist and juicy on the inside and slightly crisp on the outside. Best chicken breasts EVER!! I sliced them paper thin and used them in a salad. I used pickled ginger and canola oil because it was all I had, but it worked wonderfully. My husband declared that we'll be having this twice a week from now on!

This was a good recipe and very easy to make.  It is a nice change from traditional chicken recipes. Nice asian flavor but would be good for those not  fond of asian food. I did marinate it longer and added onion. Per other reviewers, I tried doubling the marinate and putting it over rice. It was, well, totally gross. Way too sweet and cloying.

This was delicious!  Followed the recipe, but I ran out of soy sauce and had to substitute 1/2 of it with red wine vinegar.  I was nervous, but it tasted wonderful!  We marinated it for 20 hours, grilled it beautifully!  Served with Taste of Home's "Sweet 'N' Sour Tossed Salad" (this site).  Paired great!  Next time I'd serve over rice.  MMMMmmmmm....

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to grill but used the sauce to flavor the chicken before cooking it in the wok, with asian veggies. I added a few shakes of chicken boullion granuals and two tablespoons of brown sugar...look forward to basting with it on the grill next time.

Very good recipe.  Like others, I made extra to baste the chicken as I grilled it.  The sesame oil really gives a nice nutty flavor to the meat.  I would suggest marinading for more than 15 minutes, to allow the flavors to infuse the meat a bit.

4and 1/2; added extra ginger to tone down soy, also I used a mortar & pestle for ginger. Marinated 35 min. in a gallon zip-lock turning the chicken, which I cut 2 slits in (to soak in marinade) and turned bag periodically to better marinate. Tastes best in oven at 400 degrees on a cast iron ribbed skillet.  Cook 10-12 min. on each side. (on 2 boneless breasts that totaled 2.2 lbs.)

made this tonight.  Melt in your mouth, and full of flavour.  I didn't have seseame oil, so in place I put Balsmic vinegar. I changed the honey to DaVinci's Hazelnut syrup.  This one is a keeper.  Thanks.

This was a great-tasting marinade if you want a simple sesame Asian flavor!  Nice balance of sweet and salty.  I used it not as a grilling but a stir-fry saute marinade and it came out absolutely delicious.

This turned out REALLY GOOD!  I had to modify the recipe a little bit simply because I didn't have all the ingredients.  I used vegetable oil instead of sesame oil and ginger powder instead of fresh ginger simply because I didn't have it.  It still turned out super delicious.  Someone else said it was similar to food they'd had at a Japanese restaurant and it was the same for me.  It tasted exactly like a grilled teriyaki chicken from a bento box at a traditional Japanese restaurant.  This is a great recipe that I will use over and over again.

Very good marinade.  Baked the chicken at 350 (convection) for 20 minutes.  Turned out very flavorful.

I thought this recipe was excellent!  I did make a few changes though...I used drumsticks instead of skinless, boneless chicken breast and added a teaspoon of roasted red chile paste and changed the servings to 18 as I was cooking 18 chicken legs; otherwise I followed the recipe as it was written.  The chicken was moist and flavorful, but not overpowered by the marinate/basting sauce. My dinner guests loved it.  This recipe is definitely being added to my recipe box and will be made again.

This is a very simple and delicious recipe!!  (Hubby doesn't like ginger, so I didn't add it, but I did throw in a little red pepper flakes.)  We enjoyed this dish with "Green Bean Stir-Fry" from this website and sweet potatoes.  What a yummy, healthy and easy meal!  Thanks!

This was excellent. I used boneless/skinless thighs, marinated for several hours, then baked them in the marinade in a 350 oven for about 20 minutes, so grilling time would be minimal--I find it hard not to overcook chicken on the grill... They looked grilled and tasted wonderful.

Lovely. The family loved this. I used skinless thighs instead of breasts & stir fried vegetables. Very low fat but very tasty. Will definitely cook again.

I made this last night and it was delicious, the whole family was there and they all loved it. The only change I made was I added a little pinch of crushed red pepper for a slight spicy kick.

Made this without the ginger but still turned out fantastic! I would suggest marinating this overnight. Mine sat for 3 hours and the chicken was cut up but it didn't seem like long enough.

I rate this a 5 star recipe because everyone in my family including my 5 and 3 year old girls devoured this chicken! I myself found that the soy sauce was a bit overwhelming but next time I will just reduce it a bit. We will most definately make this again. Yum!

Very Good! I agree with other reviewers that used low sodium soy sauce and marinated the chicken longer than the recipe recommends. My husband is not crazy about barbeque sauce, so this was a nice alternative for grilled chicken, plus the leftovers can be used for salads and other recipes.

Excellent! I have fixed this many times and it is always a hit! I usually double the recipe for the marinade, and use 1 tsp of the fresh minced ginger from a jar. To make the sauce thicker, for dipping, just cook longer until slightly thickened. It will thicken more as it sits. Have also used this marinade for a pork loin. Yummy!

Tantalizing taste experience. I like to increase the garlic and ginger and add cilantro leaves as well.  Must marinade for at least 4 hours, this will maximize the flavor and tenderness of the chicken. Great recipe only, gave it a 4 because you must marinade longer than the time listed to permeate the chicken for the utmost flavor.

Very good....marinated the chicken early in the morning and grilled later that night....I did reduce the amount of oil to 2 tsp. because sesame oil is very powerful...great flavors with the garlic and soy (which I used low sodium). Will add scallions to the mix next time.

What a perfect marinade. The chicken tastes exquisite without the need to marinate for a long time. I substituted Splenda for the sugar (diabetic wife), and took the advice of others to substitute water for half the soy sauce. I also gently heated the chicken in the marinade to room temperature before grilling.

I found the flavor just right after marinating for a little over an hour. I thought the flavor was great but I can see where others found it lacking, if you are eating it on its own you will want to marinate longer. We had the chicken as a sort of stir fry. I also took the advise of others and doubled the marinade but diluted the soy sauce with water or else it will be too salty. My husband thought it was fabulous and I am sure I'll be making this again soon.

VERY good.  I served it with green beans and brown rice cooked in low sodium chicken broth.  Even the kids ate it!  Sure smelled good while cooking.  I will probably try marinating it for a bit longer in the fridge to see if I can get even more of that flavor.

Delish!  Added 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes to the marinade for extra "kick".  Next time might double the marinade for extra basting and maybe marinate a little longer for extra flavor.  But overall a really good recipe.

It smells great and tastes pretty good. It definetly needs to sit for longer than 15 minutes. I put it in the fridge for about 45 min and it could have stayed in a little longer. Good, but Im not rushing to make it again.

This recipe was simple and delicious. I did marinate it for longer than called (about an hour) simply because that was convenient, and I would do that again in the future as the taste was good, certainly not too strong. Also, I used 1 t. ground ginger since I didn't have the fresh and I fried instead of grilling the chicken. If you want sauce to pour over, I would suggest doubling. I served it next to fried rice, and I think grilled or sauteed asparagus or steamed broccoli would go great with it as well. A keeper!

We have an extremely picky eater in our household and he said it was "the best chicken ever!!" Everyone cleaned their plates. It is truly so easy to fix and just melts in your mouth. I served it with jasmine rice and the sesame green beans at the suggestion of another reviewer on here, which was really tasty. I only wish I'd known it would have been so good - I would have doubled the recipe. I'll definitely be fixing this again soon!

DELICIOUS! This was so easy to prepare and make. The taste was truly satisfying. I followed this recipe exactly, and it turned out great. I will definitely make it again and again. Next time, I might use the chicken to make lettuce wraps.

This was so good! Served it with sesame green bean recipe from this website. Will defnitely make again. I will probably double the sauce next time though as it would have been nice to have some extra for topoing the rice.

This was good, I'll make it again. The marinade time didn't seem like enough but it was perfect, especially when basting with the sauce during grilling. Served with grilled pineapple circles.

This was a great recipe.  I made 2 changes.  I didn't have any fresh ginger on hand so used ground ginger, and I marinated it for about 4 hours.  Even my husband who never gets excited about Asian flavors liked it.  There were leftovers and I used it in lettuce wraps with the sauce part on the recipe here on Allrecipes for Cherry Chicken Lettuce Wraps.  Yummy!!!!

This was great! I should have marinaded the chicken longer or even overnight and it would have been superb!  But for lack of time, I prepared as stated.  Tasted like a satay.  This marinade would be great with fish, too.  I served with sweet potato and steamed veggie infused with ginger.   One word~ yummy!  p.s. I used a 'honey substitute' which is sugar free... couldn't tell the difference.

WOW! I LOVED this chicken! At first I was a little nervous about it since seseme oil is expensive where I live (or in general!) but it was worth it. Hubby thought it was OK but I absolutely loved the flavor & the beautiful golden color. I used the full amount of marinade but only used 2 chicken breasts & that worked out great with the taste & had plenty of marinade to baste the chicken with, too. Thanks so very much for the recipe!

This was a HUGE hit with my family!  I couldn't find sesame oil at the grocery store so I used toasted sesame salad dressing!  It added extra flavor and worked wonderfully!  This recipe is a definate keeper!  Next time I would double the sauce so there would be a bit extra sauce to put on the rice i served with it!  YUM!

This was a great recipe, very easy to make and it smelled terrific. I really enjoyed this but it turned out a little bit salty for my liking. I added a little bit of brown sugar to tone down the soy sauce and it turned out very well. Also, I doubled the marinade sauce and cooked the chicken and the sauce in a pan (after boiling the sauce separately first) on the stovetop together. This was great with steamed rice and I just poured the extra sauce over the rice. I would definitely make again, maybe just use low sodium soy sauce next time. Thanks!! :)

We didn't find much flavor in this dish and I even added more garlic. I even marinated the chicken overnight. It was a disappointment after reading all the positive reviews. Won't be making it again.

Great marinade! I didn't have sesame oil so substituted with olive oil and turned out great. I let the chicken marinate about an hour, and thought the flavor was perfect - not overpowering. Looked and tasted grate. Versatile, can serve with a variety of sides. Looking forward to making it again.

I didn't have the sesame oil so I used olive oil. I am sure it would be more authentice with sesame. This was some of the best chicken I have ever made.

This recipe was excellent! I'm assuming the honey was in the recipe to help brown the chicken, because I couldn't taste it.
Also, I had no fresh garlic or ginger on hand, so I used dried. Amazing! I'm sure it will taste even better with fresh ingredients.
I used bone-in chicken thighs that I left marinating for two hours, so the grill/cook time had to be adjusted for that.
This was a delicious recipe that I will make again.

After tasting the marinade, made as directed, I added more honey to balance out the saltiness of the soy sauce. Marinated chicken breasts and thighs for 10 hours then grilled. Very tasty. Would make it again.

Love this marinade! Perfect for a quick weekday dinner with rice and a salad.  Only thing I did differently was to blend the marinade to help intensify the ginger garlic flavor.  Sometimes add Sambal to add a little kick.

Mmmm so good!
Easy and fast too!
We paired with an Asian salad and green beans with rice on the side.
Definitely a new staple in our rotation. Thank you!

I baked the chicken in the oven at 400 for 35 minutes.

Next time I will cube the chicken then marinate it for longer and cook it on the stove top.

I thought it was really good, but I think it lacked green onion. I think green onion would have added just the right touch of flavor. I did thicken the sauce with just a bit of cornstarch, and that was a great touch. Overall, this was a really good dish and I'll make it again with green onion next time! Thank you!

I thought this was outstanding. I followed the marianade ingredients exactly, however, placed chicken in the marinade for a couple of hours instead of the 10 minutes.   This chicken was heavenly.  I served with Asian noodles posted by another member on this site.

Very good recipe as given.  Flavors go well together.  As usual, I did double some of the ingredients,  bug that is personal preference.

Instead of using this as a marinade, I used it as a sauce to coat cooked chicken to make rice bowls. I doubled the recipe in a saucepan, then let it come to simmer and added a few teaspoons of cornstarch and whisked until thickened. I poured over cooked chicken chunks and topped with sesame seeds. Very very good.

This is going on the "once a week list". We couldn't be happier  with how good this is. I followed recipe exactly except for using  organic low sodium tamari instead of regular soy and powdered ginger in stead of fresh,  and did not heat the marinade. I made marinade, put in ziploc bag with chicken and marinated in fridge a few hours. I made a second batch of marinade (half amount) to use when grilling (did not heat marinade before). I followed advice of another reviewer and pounded the chicken breasts flat. We used free range organic 2.5 pounds.  It took 5 minutes or less per side to cook. Served over rice. WOW

This was delicious! I did do two things differently, but don't think that would really change the outcome too much.  I didn't have fresh ginger so I used a teaspoon of ginger powder.  I also marinated it overnight because no one came home for dinner the first night so I just let it sit in the fridge overnight.  

I pounded out the chicken breasts so they wouldn't take long to cook on the grill.  Grilled maybe 6 minutes on each side and basted only one time. This was very flavorful and juicy.

OMG!  This marinade was amazing!  I didn't bother heating up the ingredients.  I just mixed them all together and poured  it over the chicken.  I didn't have enough sesame oil so added canola oil for the remainder of the oil called for.  I didn't have ginger root so used 2 teaspoons of the ginger that comes in a tube (found in the fresh produce section).  Will be making this again, that's for sure!  Thanks for posting. Can bake at 400 for 40-45 min, covered. Next time I'll try uncovered as sauce was thin.

I made exactly as the recipe called for. Marinated only 15 minutes. My husband loved it. The chicken was very tender, however, (I knew you were waiting for a however), I thought the sesame oil overpowered the chicken. I would make again, but probably cut back on the sesame oil. I would cut in half,but that is me. To each his own. Will make again. Have fun and enjoy!!!!!

This was a delicious recipe. Let me start off by saying I'm not the best cook in the world and this recipe made me look like a pro! Haha. This was a last minute decision lunch so I only made 1 serving and adjusted the ingredients accordingly. I added a tsp of sugar and some red pepper flakes for a kick. I also put the chicken in a bag and marinaded for only one hour because I was low on time. Being marinaded for only an hour, it was still so flavorful and juicy. This will definitely be my go to for marinating chicken!

Loved this! I used extra garlic because we love it, and marinated for two hours. I used bone-in chicken thighs. I used the extra sauce to drizzle over the chicken and served it with rice. A great weeknight meal!

4.5 Stars: I heated the marinade and marinated the meat overnight.  I put three deep cuts in each breast so the marinade gets in better. I boiled the marinade, baked the chicken and basted.  The flavor was good.

Realized at the last minute that I needed a quick marinade for the chicken I was about to grill for my salad tonight. Found this and figured it was quick and easy so why not give it a shot. Boy am I glad I did. Removed the tenders from the breasts and pounded the breasts nice and even then butterflied them and marinated at room temp for approx 20 minutes. They only took about 4-5 minutes per side on the grill and turned out fantastic. Next time I make this I will double the marinade and thicken it to serve as a sauce. Definite keeper.

Just whipped this up tonight for dinner with some asparagus and jasmine rice.  It was VERY flavorful, and with a relatively small ingredients list, it's an economical dinner as well for those working with a small grocery budget. I chose to cut three large chicken breasts in to smaller 1 1/2 inch strips in order to reduce the cooking time and get a more intense marinade soak that penetrateed the entire piece of chicken. I'll be making this dish again :)

Easy, delicious and made with ingredients I keep on hand. For easy cleanup, I marinated the chicken in a sealed plastic bag. I may double the marinade next time so I have more sauce for rice. Do be sure to boil the marinade though, to make it safe to eat after it's had raw chicken in it.

I marinated this overnight and grilled it the next day. I doubled the marinade, took out the chicken and boiled the marinade to use as a basting/ dipping sauce. I tasted the sauce and thought it was too sweet so I added some white vinegar and siracha sauce until I liked the spiciness, so when you bite into the chicken first you get the spicy sauce then the sweet and tender chicken

This was really good!  I only marinated the chicken for an hour and I thought it might not have much flavour, but it was delicious!  So easy.

So easy and so delicious with the recipe as is.  A great edition to any barbecue.  I've used chicken breast and chicken thighs and both worked well.

MMM YUM!  My only changes I was out of soy sauce (for the first time in my life, lol) so I substituted Kikoman's Teriyaki Sauce, used powder ginger, small diced garlice and let my chicken marinate for a good hour.  Excellent marinade!  Thanks!!

Very strong soy sauce flavor. I didn't even get a hint of the ginger. And, it definitely needs more honey. Overall, I didn't care for it enough to try again.

This is a great recipe.  Very basic, but lots of flavor!  My whole family loved it.  I marinated the chicken for about 6 hours.  I think the marinade could be used on other meats as well...beef, fish,....

Great!  I doubled the marinade and marinated for about 20 minutes before broiling.  Delicious, even the next day reheated for lunch.

This was a good and easy recipe but a little too sweet for my taste.  If I made this again I would add a small amount of chile paste and a little less honey.  Remember the sugar from the honey will make it burn a littl eon the outside so be careful and watch it.

Very simple recipe using ingredients I already have on hand.  I used chicken wings, didn't pre-cook marinade and baked in oven at 375 degrees for 45 minutes.  Next time I will try using grated ginger and a light soy sauce.  I will also marinate for longer to see if it gives it more flavor.

Oh, wow!  This was SOO good!  We tried the recipe exactly as written and the only reason it wasn't five stars because it really does need to marinate overnight and the recipe did not call for that.  So in order for this recipe to truly be five stars you'll need to change it.  But the flavor was absolutely perfect, I wouldn't change a thing there.  This recipe WILL get used over and over and over and over...

Very easy.  Took some other recommendations - cut the sesame oil in half, added some water (since I did not have low sodium soy sauce).  Marinated overnight and it was yummy the next day after the grill!

I found Grilled Asian Chicken while I was surfing the website for easy and fast chicken recipes.  This is definitely a keeper!  The only changes I made were that I used approximately four tablespoons of fresh finely chopped ginger root, and Kikoman Teriaki Sauce, since it was all I had in the fridge.  I put everything including the chicken in a zip lock bag and tossed in the fridge.  How easy...and really tasty.  I can't wait to try the leftovers in a salad tomorrow.

Good marinade.  It tasted better on drumsticks than boneless/skinless breasts.  I used the marinade (added cornstarch) as a sauce with lo mein noodles and vegetables.  My family enjoyed the noodles with the sauce more than the chicken.

This recipe is so flavorful for its simple ingredients.  I used my broiler and kept basting with the sauce throughout cooking and it turned out golder and yummy.

This was really good. I used the ingredients as listed, except I always use reduced-sodium soy sauce in everything and had to substitute garlic powder. I didn't cook it as directed, though. After microwaving the marinade and pouring it over the thin-sliced chicken, I just stuck the whole thing in the oven for awhile. Then I took it out and put it on the stove top until it kind-of glazed. With this cooking method there was plenty of marinade and a nice strong flavor. The only thing is the sesame oil is a little too strong like this. I will cut it in half next time, since we don't actually own a grill and I'll just be making it in the oven.

Great flavor.  When I make chicken I cover it while its in the pan to kind of steam it and take it out as soon as it is cooked.  It comes out juicy and tender.

I made this exactly as stated with the exception of using ground ginger instead of fresh and I loved it. I made this for a party and everyone loved it. I actually doubled the entire recipe and felt that there was plenty of marinade.  This is a very simple marinade and tastes delicious. I will definitely make this again.

This was delicious, but I agree with the other poster, it was way too salty! The only thing I changed was to use 2 chicken breasts instead of 4, and I found there was just enough sauce! I suggest doubling the sauce recipe if you're using 4 chicken breasts.

This was OK, I discovered I don't like Sesame Oil too much-it just tasted like burnt sesame to me.  I doubled the sauce but left the Sesame Oil at 4 tsp but it still left a mild burnt taste in my mouth.  DH thought it was OK.

We really enjoyed this chicken!  Followed ingredients exactly - let it marinade for about 3 hours and then grilled it.  I do suggest using low sodium soy sauce as it was a little salty.

We made this chicken tonight - used the full sauce recipe but only two pieces of chicken.  We marinated it for several hours instead of just 15 minutes.  After we took the chicken out of the marinade we strained it and then boiled it for a few minutes and used it as a sauce for the chicken.  This was great.  Also used low sodium soy sauce too.

Served this with cold sesame noodles.  What a great summer meal to cook on the grill.

Thanks for posting.

Good, but I think I marinated the chicken too long--one hour.  It was kind of salty.  No one complained, but I didn't get the whoots! that I had expected.

This was grrreat!  I made it with boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  Next time I have to remember to salt and pepper the meat first.  I would serve this to company at a BBQ.  Served it with cauliflower and potatos.

Modified the amount of the ingredients to taste, as I made the marinade. Added more honey, and used ground ginger because I didn't have any ginger root. Not a fan of regular soy sauce, but I ran out of low-sodium soy sauce so I used regular instead, and diluted a bit with water. I thought the Asian flavor was subtle, but tasty and the chicken turned out moist. My boyfriend barbequed and basted the chicken twice. but said it was too salty for him. My parents loved it though. I will definitely make it again.

I made this recipe for the first time tonight. I was afraid it was going to be too dry on its own so I prepared a peanut sauce to go with it... The chicken ended up soooo juicy and delicious it didn't even need the sauce I had made. We did it just like it said on the recipe: marinated it 15 minutes and then basted it with the remainder of the marinade while it cooked on the BBQ. I served it with Jasmine rice and a spinach and strawberry salad. MMmm... We'll definitely make this one again!!

This is a great recipe.  The marinade is very quick and easy, and I only marinaded it for about an hour.  I used chicken thighs instead as they are more flavourful.  It turned out great.  Very flavourful. Thanks.

So tender and delicious!  My husband doesn't usually like grilled chicken because it tends to be a little dry, but this was so juicy and tender!  I let it marinade for about three hours and I think that really helped.  Really nice flavor.  We definitely will be making this quite often :)

This recipe was excellent.  I marinaded it for 45 minutes because I had the time to.  The flavor was really there too!  At the indian markets they have a ginger / garlic paste that I always keep in the refrigerator for all sorts of things and in this recipe it was wonderful.  Saved time too!  I grilled them on the grill and I recommend this recipe.

Very good.  I followed the recipe exactly and the only comment from hubby was " a little too much ginger".  I will make again, but reduce the amount just a little to suit our tastes.  Thanks for the post.

Although I used it differently, this recipe was still very good.  I used it as a sauce and not a marinade.  I sautéed the garlic and ginger in the sesame oil and then sautéed shrimp.  I removed the shrimp and then sautéed an Asian stir fry kit (snap peas, bok choy, bean sprouts, shitake mushrooms, and red peppers).  I added the cooked shrimp just before the veggies became tender and served over coconut rice.  It was a bit salty so consider using low sodium soy sauce.

We love the flavor of this marinade. Our favorite way to serve it is by chopping it up and serving over the Asian Salad by Juanita Peek (also on this site).

I baked it instead of grilling, so my rating is distorted.  Even though I marinaded it for 6 hours, the taste didn't sink in.  It was blah and tasteless.  Next time I'll broil it, except I won't make it again.

This recipe makes a yummy and flavorful chicken!  I actually marinated mine for 48 hours (by accident, actually) and the chicken was so delicious and tender.  This will be a staple in our house!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good.  I doubled the marinade for four large chicken breasts and marinated for an hour.  Very tasty and smelled great while cooking.  A little bit on the salty side even though I used the reduced sodium soy sauce.  Thanks for posting!

Good chicken. I cooked it in my foreman grill. I used boneless thighs and shouldn't have, breasts are better.

This dish is amazing, and a hit for get togethers. It takes awhile to make, but its worth the effort. Just be sure not to take the chicken off the heat too soon, because it will not get sticky enough.

My husband thought it was flavorful, but I thought it was very bland and not particularly pretty.  I do not think that I would make it again.

It was very good on my cast iron grill with a side of asparagus and brown rice. Had a nice flavor to it. I also made a green salad with Newman's own Seasame ginger dressing.
The kids loved this one.

Not bad... I feel like it was missing something or maybe a little less Soy and a little more honey.

Nice flavors.  I followed the directions but made extra sauce.  Cut the chicken into slices and placed over white rice.  Next time I will add some Chinese vegetables to go along with the rice and sauce.  Thanks Janet

This is SO good, and I make it at least once a week,  the chicken breast are good alone, but they're really good on a salad.

This recipe was wonderful!  My husband is very picky when it comes to marindes and he absolutely loved it.  I even got my 3yr. old to eat every bit on her plate.

Would have given this a 5 star rating if directions had been clearer, be sure to use light sesame oil, not the dark.  I made a double batch and used 2 tsp dark and 1 Tbs regular vegetable oil.  Marinated boneless chicken breasts 12 hours, then grilled.  Used simmered marinated for basting.  Great tasting chicken.

This was great!  Fast, easy, delicous...a combination that is hard to beat.  I didn't even pound the chicken like I usually do and it was so tender!!  Also, I used a cast iron grill on my stove top.  It was a huge hit with the whole family.

Very good and make sure you save some of the boiled sauce to pour over your chicken once served!

Everyone loved it! They couldn't stop snacking on it even after dinner! Instead of using chicken breasts, we used thighs because they are more moist. Because of this, we used half of the recipe and doubled the garlic and ginger. This gave it extra flavor and we baked it instead of grilling! It was still delicious and a big hit! Definitely will make again!

This marinade was great!  I added a little more soy sauce & seasonings plus added a little scallions & sesame seeds.  I marinated the chicken for 2 hours and served with vegetables and rice also cooked in a little of the extra marinade & it was a great meal.  Thanks!!
