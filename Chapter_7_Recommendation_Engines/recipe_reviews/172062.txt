Very cute name for a quick soup. For someone who's battling a pretty nasty strain of the flu, I appreciate all the help I can get making something fast that will help me feel better. I had two large chicken breasts just hanging around that I'd poached in chicken broth that I didn't end up using as well as cooked brown rice that was leftover from another meal earlier in the week. I did add more veg(about a half cup of thinly sliced cabbage and more carrots and celery) and I used the chicken broth from poaching the chicken(plus a bit more)for the soup. This will feed me well for a lowfat lunch for a couple days at least and it's flavorful enough where I don't feel like I'm depriving myself of anything. This is so quick it should be illegal and for those of you who have a little of this and that from the week's meals can throw it in and make it work to feed the whole family on the cheap without wasting leftovers. Way to rock it, Ladyslew!

This was excellent. I simmered 2 leg quarters in some chicken broth I had in the freezer. I also used dry thyme as I didn't have any fresh oh yeah I used egg noodles simply because my family is kinda riced out right now =) We really enjoyed this and I will certainly be making it again!!

My whole family did not care for this soup. We didn't like the broth and the whole flavor was just weird. Will not make again!

The flavors are good, but my rice came out too mushy and I didn't care for the chunks of fresh rosemary.  I love rosemary, but I prefer dried and ground.  I'll probably try again with a different rice.  Thanks for submitting.

This recipie is my favorite.  I used Brown Gluten Free Rice becuase I don't eat anything white anymore these days because I'm allergic to bleached products.  It was awesome.  You can use noodles or rice either way it's just as good.  I prefer rice though bc the noodles expand too much.  Most of the herbs I used out in the side of the house they were fresh.  If you don't have a fresh herb garden it may become discouraging to find these fresh herbs. So I would make a goal during the spring to plant fresh herbs!
