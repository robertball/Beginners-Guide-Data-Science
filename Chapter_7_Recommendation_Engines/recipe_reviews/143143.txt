The instructions are confusing in this recipe.  It calls for 1/2 cup spiced rum "divided," but the instructions just say to mix the rum (no qty?) into the other ingredients, so I added all of it.  But then at the end it says to "stir in remaining rum"â€¦what remaining rum??  I don't know, I just added another splash of rum at the end.  The flavor is intense, interesting (different), and was tasty on grilled bone-in chicken breasts.

If you use the "clasic ketchup" recipe provided on this website instead of regular ketsup it cuts way down on the sugar and carbs.  The hoisin sause also contains sugar so I use 1 tab of it. I did not use the rum - instead I used 1/2 cup crushed pineapple.

I'll make it again. I only used a tiny pinch..probably only a fraction..of the cayenne it calls for & made up for it w/a much lighter "creole" seasoning as I'm SUPER touchy about spiciness (I like FLAVOR, *NOT* hot-spicy!). I also used real brown sugar (stevia) instead of splenda b/c I like my body & I'd rather not poison it w/anything fake..but that's a personal choice.
