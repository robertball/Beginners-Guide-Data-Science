This was amazing! I will forever make broccoli this way and can't wait to have others try it! The purple onion and sage made a great flavor combo for the broccoli and the texture was yummy! The only thing I didn't do, and would do next time, is to toss all ingredients in a bowl first and mix well. I found that drizzling olive oil over the broccoli made some pieces over bake in spots that the olive oil didn't hit.

Great tasting broccoli recipe. If my mom had made broccoli like this when I was growing up I actually would have eaten it instead of feeding it to the indiscriminate dog!

So healthy and yummy! Much to my dismay, I didn't have fresh sage leaves. I substituted with rubbed sage and 2 fresh pressed garlic cloves. It worked perfectly. Who knew that sage could impart such a wonderful flavor to roasted broccoli?

Wow, the fresh sage makes this sooo good. I thought it was a little salty, but still yummy. I had some chickpeas I needed to get rid of so I added those to the pan which I would definitely do again. I would make this for company!

Loved this recipe!  We usually roast broccoli with toasted peanut oil, but this may become our new roasted broccoli recipe!  Thought my DH might not care for the sage, but he raved about the flavor of this dish. My own minor comments:  I used kosher salt (sparingly).  I sliced the red onion very thin, which allowed it to crisp up a bit in the roasting, which we loved.  I also put the broccoli in a large bowl to coat with the olive oil - think it did a much better job of getting the oil over all parts of the veg.  Since I had another dinner item to bake, I roasted this at 375 - just took a little longer to finish, but with no negative effect.

Waaaaayyyyy too salty.  No one could eat it.  I followed the instructions exactly, but what came out was inedible.  Would omit most of the salt if I ever tried it again.

Really good. I couldn't stop eating forkfuls off of the roasting pan straight out of the oven. I used probably 2x or 3x the sage leaves and it could have used more. I used olive oil spray on top of tinfoil and again on the top of the veggies. Sliced a  whole sweet onion into thin rings. The onion was really good too. Baked on 375 and that seemed perfect. Didn't stir at all but it might have helped with more even browning.

Really delicious.  I don't think I will ever steam broccoli again.  I have a hard time getting hubby to eat veggies, and he had three helpings.  I only had a vidalia onion on hand, but think it would also be great with red.  Might use a touch less salt next time.

I'm not a fan of broccoli, but this recipe was really good.  I love how it comes out crispy and the sage really adds to it.

Loved this recipe. I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt but other than that followed the recipe.  My husband I I both loved it.  In fact he said he could eat just that for dinner.  I will definitely make this again. Thank you Zest to Impress.

There's too much salt. Instead of garlic salt, use garlic powder and 1/4 tsp salt = better garlic flavor and less sodium.  Also glad to know dried sage can be substituted for fresh.  Great flavor change for those of us who love broccoli anyway!

Personal preference - I don't prefer crispy broccoli.  I baked it for 15 minutes.  Nice flavors.  I'd use sage again with broccoli.   I paired it with quinoa and Bulgar wheat with a few peas  it.  It was a nice grain side next to the broccoli.

Hi all!  Zest to impress here.  Unfortunately, I can't edit the recipe, but I wanted to clarify, the broccoli in the recipe is FRESH.  Thank you all so much for the reviews and I see a lot of people recommend a reduction in the salt.  I love the idea of using garlic powder or fresh garlic and leaving out the garlic salt.  Keep trying it out and keep the reviews coming!

Not much I can say except I made it with fresh broccoli. It tasted great and there was none left over after dinner. If there is nothing left over I know it was a 'hit'

this was pretty good.. bf liked it more than i did.. in all fairness, i was using dried sage (1/2 tsp).. i omitted the salt and just went with the garlic salt.. used yellow onion instead of the red.. bf said to really enjoy this you need to eat the broccoli at the same time as the onion.. not just pick out one or the other.. ty for the recipe

I was looking for a recipe to use fresh sage from my herb garden and decided to try this. It is so good! I used fresh broccoli so I can control size of broccoli florets. I don't like the stems. I have made this three times now

This was so good!  I used fresh broccoli and ground sage because that is what I had.  The flavor was light, but so tasty and it didn't overpower the natural yummyness of the broccoli.  I will definitely make this again.

Tasty and easy dish! Subbed garlic powder for the garlic salt; it was just right. Found the sage flavor too mild even though I doubled it; I plan to triple the amount next time. I used scissors to cut the sage in strips—faster than tearing each leaf. Stirring everything in a bowl worked well.

Loved it, not salty at all.  I added some tomato slices to keep some moisture in the broccoli while roasting, and it came out beautifully.  I also cooked 2 cups of penne pasta and tossed it all together with about 1 cup of parmesan cheese right after it came out of the oven.  Next time I'll add some more sage though, it was hard to taste it in all that broccoli goodness.  It was a big hit with my friends who I made it for.  Sorry no photo cuz we were hungry!

I didn't add the salt, just the garlic salt,  but I thought it was great and both my girls liked it too( 6 and 4). I'm happy to have a good use for the sage in my garden.

This was just really good and easy. I'd make it again! Also, it was a great way to use up some leftover sage I had from another recipe.

I loved this brocolli, best I've had in my life. I did mix the salt, pepper etc. with oil in a bowl first, as someone else recommended. And I also added some brown sugar, mixed with soy sauce. And that last bit is what made it absolutely perfect to me!

I made it twice, once as is- it was great! But since I have a large sage plant I also tried it with cauliflower- equally as good!

I really don't like broccoli, but this recipe with fresh sage has changed my taste for broccoli for the better.  I followed the recipe and didn't change a thing. its just that good.

Very good, used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Found it didn't need the full 20 mins. Loved the crispy sage. Will make again.

I skip the garlic salt and add the rest of the seasonings by eye, but this is the only way I've made broccoli since I found this recipe.  We love the sage!

This was delicious! I used fresh broccoli. I didn't measure any of the spices, just sprinkled on (and I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt).

Would have given this 5 stars if it wasn't so salty.  Made a second time with half the salt, and substituted garlic salt with garlic powder.  Much better.

Skip the salt and garlic salt. Add minced garlic. Delicious.

I love broccoli so I had to try this recipe. I used fresh garlic and a bit of garlic powder. Used fresh Broccoli not frozen. Taste was really good. added a bit of red pepper flake at end for some spice. First time I roasted broccoli came out good. Will try again.
