Love the flavor that the cinnamon and pecans add to this! Personally, I prefer just a little added Truvia, but that's a preference. The process for this recipe works to make a soft serve ice cream, or wait a few minutes (or blend longer) for a thick, drinkable smoothie.

I love it! I ate one serving fresh and put the remaining servings in canning jars for a sweet treat later!

This vegan ice cream is so delicious! I used walnuts instead of pecans because I had them on hand and put in only as much almond milk as would make it creamy. I didn't want to make it too soupy. The amount of sweetness is perfect, and I love all the flavors.

Absolutely delicious.   Used walnuts instead.  My son added brewed coffee to his shake.   Very versatile recipe.

Even after freezing the banana, this with nothing more than a smoothie. It had no hard consistency at all. I did tweak it and add a drop of vanilla extract and instead of pecans I used almonds.

This was very nice.  I put some vanilla extract, strawberries and 2 scoops of vegan protein powder in it as well.

I tried this yesterday for my vegan daughter in law. Other than being cold on a hot day,, I found it tasteless . There is too much liquid in this to make an ice cream consistency. It was more like a smoothie. It also needed a sweetener. Maybe honey? My daughter in law makes these "ice creams" all the time and says she only uses a little liquid or as much as it takes for the right consistency.
