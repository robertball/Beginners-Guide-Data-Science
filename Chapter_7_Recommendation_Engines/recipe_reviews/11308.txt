This is my husband's Grandma's recipe.  She won the Pillsbury Bake Off in 1971 with this recipe and flew all of her kids to Hawaii (she and Grandpa were already there for the finals).  She died in 1999 but would be tickled pink to know that so many are still enjoying the recipe!

Superb recipe !!! My husband's favorite pie is pecan pie, and he is also a "cookie monster". So, this recipe fills the bill twice. Very rich but absolutely delicious! Easy to make, too. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.

This is almost the exact same recipe as the pillsbury bake off winner recipe except that recipe calls for 1/3 cup softened butter. It is good but like pecan pie is sweet. I agree more pecans would be good. Maybe as much as 2 cups. But they are tasty and easy.

These bars were pretty yummy. Why were so many confused? Save out 2/3 CUP of cake mix; not 2/3 of the box. Soften the butter and you should get a ball of dough you can press into the pan with a spatula. I recommend baking the "crust" as long as you can and let it cool before pouring on the filling.Also, I'd use more than 1 cup of pecans. tasty!

The only variation I made in the ingredients was to use a full 6 oz bag of pecan pieces, equal to 1 and 1/3 cup, as suggested by previous bakers.  I baked the bottom layer for 17 minutes and it was quite brown around the edges.  The next stage, the filling was bubbling quickly, so I decreased the temp to 325 and increased the cooking time a few minutes because it was still jiggly at the 35 minute point.  After cooling, I ended up cutting all the edges off because they were so hard and brown.

These came out very good!!  If you have problems patting the crust into your pan, just wet your fingers, and it will go down very easy!!  I followed the recipe exactly other then mixing all the pecans into the filling, and I did add about an extra 2/3 cup of them.   Pecan Pie is DH favorite dessert, and he was more then pleased with these bars!!  Will make again, Thanks for sharing your recipe@@

Excellent!  Will make these again. They must set and cool before cutting.  After cooling the center has set and the bars keep there shape yet are still nice and moist on the inside.  I did a 24 cut and with that cut it serves 24 as well. As rich as these are you only need one!

Don't forget the whipped cream or ice cream to top this off - then it's not so rich.  
This was our absolute favorite when we were kids - exactly this recipe (by Glenda).  Dad loved it too... I'm glad I'm now making it myself!

This has been a family favorite since the early 1970s when I first discovered it in a cook-off winner publication.  My gosh, it is so delicious.  I still have the original paper recipe.  The measurements are correct.  Take your time and read the DIRECTIONS carefully - set aside 2/3 cup, not box, of dry cake mix for the filling.  The remainder of the dry cake mix is used for the crust.  The only time I ever had a problem was when rushed and I turned on my large standard mixer and tried to blend the crust on high - it got doughy - my mistake.  I pressed it into the pan, baked it... and no one knew the difference.  Now I look for cake mixes that do not have pudding in the mix.

You're not left with 1/3 of the whole box of cake mix if you reserve 2/3 cup.  Try it again because these cookies are awesome.

I usually pass recipes which are based on store mixes, but believe me - this one is worth trying. I tripled the zmount of pecans and put some parchment paper on the bottom of the pan before pouring the batter - separating the bars when they were done was a breeze. Though the aroma of the baking will make you drool, make sure the pie cools completely before you cut it, otherwise the filling will be still gooey and the bars will look messy. Even better - refrigerate for several hours and then cut into bars. Good way to exercise your willpower! Beautiful recipe!

The measurements are ALL wrong. The cake batter ratios are completely off. Might be good if revised, but this should not remain posted as is.

I have made this recipe at least five times in the past two months for picnics, bake sales and as gifts.  It freezes very well!  The whole family loves it.  The kids have to get used to the nuts.

Two things:
1) The recipe I used for these yummy bars says to mix ALL the cake mix with the egg and butter and THEN reserve out 2/3 of the, yes, DOUGH (not crumbly at all).  Then you press the 1/3 of the dough into the pan and bake for 15 minutes.  All the rest seems to be the same though.
2) I was making these the other day and had everything mixed and ready to go when I realized the only syrup I had was maple pankcake syrup.  I went ahead and used it and it turned out great! (a little different than the way they are supposed to be) but still delicious!!  Just a tip in case you run out of corn syrup! :)

Something is wrong here !  I tried
these yesterday, and 1/2 cup of melted butter and one egg to 1/3 of the cake mix does not equal "crumbly"  It was DOUGH !  That was way too much liquid.  I can not believe the others made this by the recipe and came out with such rave reviews.  After seeing the results of all that liquid, all I could do to salvage it was to add the additional eggs, etc. called for on the box of cake mix and just bake a plain yellow cake.  I was very disappointed as I was baking these for company.  After reading the response.  I wish to say that I did not misread the directions.  My only thought is that perhaps they meant "softened butter" as opposed to "melted butter."  I still say that 1/3 box of cake mix, 1 egg, and 1/2 cup of melted butter was not crumbly.

Demes best cookie at my gourmet cooking group Christmas cookie exchange! 
These bars are not elegant - the are actually rather a sticky gooey mess but Oh What a Mouthful and so EASY!

Definitely needs 2 cups pecans.  At final baking watch the last few minutes carefully as it sets up all of a sudden.  I prefer Duncan Hines mix for this.

On one batch I ran out of dark corn syrup and subbed some light, extra brown sugar and maple syrup and liked it even better.

Last tip, on first baking take out on early side when just cooked, very light brown so base does not overly harden at end.

Wow, these are amazing!  I like the other type of pecan pie bar too, but these are better.  I made the recipe as written, and WOW, they are so good!  Oooey gooey perfect.  Not sure why others had trouble with it, because this was an easy, perfect recipe.  Thanks so much for sharing, this one is going into the family recipe book.

These were a total hit!  People kept telling me all night how good they were as they kept coming back for more!  The only variation I did was to use light corn syrup instead of dark, as that was all I had on hand.

Okay, I have a very similar recipe to this, and it calls for combining the cake mix, one egg, and SOFTENED butter together. After you mix it all together (it will form a dough, not a crumbly mixture), press all but 2/3 cup of the ENTIRE MIXTURE into the pan and bake. Then follow the rest of the recipe as listed. When I made it this way it turned out wonderfully. So even if the dough is doughy and not crumbly, the recipe still works, so don't give up.

I prepared using 2 cups chopped pecans.  I also waited for the crust to cool 10 minutes before pouring the filling over the crust.  Good, taste like pecan pie, good for a get together of family and friends.

Bottom Layer was very much a dough, not crumbly~ and I used softened butter instead of melted, just cut it in like for a pie crust. Once I got it into the pan (messy work), it was fine. Try dipping your fingers into a little of the reserved cake mix to minimize the sticking. Next time I will cook the base a little longer but overall the final result was very good.

I wish I would have read the reviews on this before I wasted my time and ingredients. There is NO WAY you can get crumbly consistency from the recipe. What you get is dough which you have to try and press into the pan. I don't know how the folks who made them from this recipe could have enjoyed them.

This recipe for pecan bars is superb.  Even though I had to use a white cake mix in place of the yellow mix; and probably used twice the amount of pecans, I'm pleasantly happy with this recipe.  This is for people who love the taste of pecan pie without all the gooey mess inside! The recipe was easy to follow, and all ingredients are readily available; GOOD JOB GLENDA:)

Yumm! Great recipe. Finally, I can give my husband Pecan pie without having to make pie (I really dislike making pie)! This will be a regular at Thanksgiving and Christmas time for sure. I only gave 4 stars because I am reserving 5 stars for something that makes me go "oh my God!" but this was really good, no doubt.

I made these for the guys at work last week....well today I am making two batches....these get five stars from myself and about twenty guys at work'.     I did add extra pecans....well after all us southerners gotta have those precious magical nuts and I make my own vanilla extract and add a table spoon and then push the cavier from one vanilla bean into the last stage. Thank you soooooo very much for sharing this.

This recipe is the best!  The only thing I did different is light corn syrup instead of dark because I didn't have dark on hand.  The yellow cake mix crust is so much better than traditional pie crust, which I'm not a huge fan of.  Also instead of melting the butter I softened cold butter for 20 seconds in the microwave and it worked great.  Thanks, this one is a keeper for sure!!!

I love these bars. So simple (Cake mixes are wonderful shortcuts!) and delicious. I couldn't believe my taste buds when I ate these. Just like pecan pie. If you like pecan pie you will like these as well.

Very disappointed.  Followed the directions carefully and I agree that the bottom layer wasn't crumbly, it was a dough. Yuck. I bake all the time with excellent results but this one ....

Redirg was right -- the butter and cake mix together make a dough, not a crumbly mixture.  I double-checked that I did the proportions correctly, too.  The cookies are in the oven now -- I think they'll taste fine, but the crust was a sticky dough that had to be patted into the pan.  Maybe it depends on the type of butter/margarine used?  And maybe it should be softened, as someone said, instead of melted.

Great and easy recipe!. Instead of yellow cake mix I used caramel cake mix.I had to spread the cookie bottom instead of sprinkling it, which made me kinda nervous.This is a perfect alternative to the traditional pecan pie!

I was skeptical about these because of the cake mix, but they are delicious. I served these near Christmas, cut into triangles. Nice presentation. Very rich and tasty.

I made a pan of these for Thanksgiving and they disappeared.  I also made a pan to take to my office and a pan for my significant other to take to his office.  People RAVED about them and begged for the recipe.  They are absolutely delicious!  I altered one ingredient the second time I made them - I used 1/2 cup of pure maple syrup and 1 cup of Karo dark.

This is a very good recipe, probably even a 5 star but my oven was heating much higher than the gauge showed so it affected the texture, parts too dry and parts not baked enough.  I don't mean to penalize the recipe for my error so will make them again, not baking too fast.  The flavor is awesome, much easier to eat than pecan pie but all the same deliciousness.

These came out okay.  I followed the recipe exactly and the filling kinda fell into the crust. Maybe I didn't bake the crust long enough.  Not sure, but they still taste great, they just don't look as pretty as the photo.
