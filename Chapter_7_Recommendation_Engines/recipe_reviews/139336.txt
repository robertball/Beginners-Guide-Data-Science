These are pretty good.  They have a unique flavor & people have a hard time guessing what the "secret" ingredient is.  I used 8 Earl Grey tea bags. I also used dutch chocolate. I will definitely make them again.

I thought the combination was intrigueing, the cookie was soft and the tea added a nice little something missing in alot of cookies. Not overly sweet as some cookies but good with hot tea or milk? My kids werent thrilled with them but the adults thought they were great. This would be a good church or social function cookie for adults.

This is a new favorite in my house. I made these with Republic of Teas Vanilla Almond black tea and a 1/2 tsp of almond extract. They were moist and delious. I made a double batch and froze half, the frozen half tasted just as good and moist after thawed.

Sophisticated cookies!  I used Hersheys Dark Cocoa powder, 6 Stash teabags and added a pinch of salt.  I made them small, about 1 tsp of dough.  I chilled the dough and they barely spread at all.  These will become a regular treat around here.  Thanks for a lovely new taste.

Very unique cookie! I didn't have a coffee grinder so I had to suffice with just crumbling the tea leaves as best I could with my fingers, they still ended up in rather large pieces but I didn't mind at all. Definitely an adult cookie, savoury and not overly sweet

You really need to tell people what they are eating or else it just tastes strange. But if you KNOW that flavor is Earl Grey, it makes it pretty cool. The texture of these is perfect. I'll probably make them occasionally in the future.

I had this cookie from a bakery without the cocoa and it was fan-tab-u-lous!  Remember when baking to not over bake at all.  Bake through just until done.

These cookies have somehow managed to push ahead of chocolate chip cookies as my favorite type of cookie. Everyone who had one loved them and couldn't get enough. They were soft and cakey, a little crumbly, and very delicious. I added white chocolate chips, which I felt really added to the delicious flavour combo. We used a food processor to grind up the tea, and it worked perfectly. They were really chocolaty, which I personally loved, but someone who isn't such a big fan of chocolate might want to use less chocolate or a semi-sweet cocoa powder. A great recipe, if you are a tea lover you MUST try it, and I can't wait to try it with other varieties of tea.

Tasted like a less-sweet version of a brownie. Word to the wise - do not overcook! Using the same batter, the second tray of cookies became dry and chalky by adding only an extra minute of cooking. I think 7-7.5 minutes is enough; they will taste better the next day using this time frame.

I made these to fill a super chocolate + earl grey tea craving I'd been having. There's a coffee shop where I used to live that made a blended drink incorporating these two things, & then my friend from the UK sent me Belgian dark chocolate with earl grey in it. It was lovely. But I needed some more. These cookies certainly filled my craving. The tea was noticeable and enjoyable. The texture of the cookie is pleasant  - nice and soft. I agree with another reviewer that the cookie is brownie like. I shared these with my husbands' fellow graduate students and even the picky ones liked them.  I will make again, but I will use more tea and super dark chocolate (just my preference - these were excellent as is).

These were quick, easy, and really tasty. Tastes more like a brownie than a cookie. The batter was really thick, which at first worried me, but they came out beautifully. Do not look like the picture, which was confusing. They look more like the #3 picture. I am definitely making them again. Go really good with the tea they were named after.

Good and tasty. I don't find them moist but they are fluffy and have a nice taste of earl gray. However by the next day they are very dry and I'm not caring for them.

If you like extremely cakey cookies, these are for you.  I up-ed the tea bag count to nine (3 Earl Greys, 3 Lady Greys, 1 Indian Spice Chai, and 2 decaff supermarket brand Earl Greys) and it wasn't too strong.  Like one of the reviewers said, I sprinkled decorative sugar on top for presentation's sake - that was good advice since these cookies aren't really pretty given their color and shapelessness.  The flavor is unique, and makes for a good candidate to add variety to a cookie box gift, but I don't think I'd recommend them for shipping because they are so soft.

I made only a half batch.  I thought that the bergamot flavor was quite strong- these are definitely cookies for a tea lover.  I also rolled them into balls, and baked for 8 min.  They were soft and cakey.  Maybe I'm really sensitive to caffeine, but I sure could feel the effects after eating only 2 of them- next time I will use decaf!

Absolutely delicious.  A mortar and pestle also works, although it takes longer and makes, perhaps, for slightly coarser tea, but it's a nice taste that way too.

Absolutely wonderful!  Instead of dropping onto the cookie sheet, I rolled the dough into small balls and then pressed slightly.  Then topped with decorative sugar.    Lovely!  Don't cook more than 8 minutes.      Perfect, dense, cake-like cookies!

These were really good, despite the fact that the cookie turned out hard, and not soft like the other reviews said. It may have been because the butter was too hard when I mixed it with the sugar. I will definitely use this recipe again and make them over and over until I get them perfect.... and I won't even mind eating the mistakes.

These were nice! Had a different taste than the cookies I normally have around since they're more spicy than sweet and sugary tasting. I'd probably make these again, just to change things up from what I normally bake.

This was a tasty, unusual cookie. However, the texture is so much like cake that I think I will make it as a brownie or even cupcakes next time. I used Twinning's loose Earl Grey, which I ground finely in my thoroughly-cleaned coffee grinder. The flavor keeps well and even my super picky husband liked these cookies!

These were decent. I liked them, but my parents did not. I thought they were a bit on the dry side and a little too sweet. I did like the earl grey flavor, though! I don't know if I would make them again.

Very nice! The cookies are definitely not sweet, I like that but my husband would have preferred a little more sweetness. Next time I'll make them with more sugar, or I might ice them with coconut. I used extra Earl Grey because I love tea... it was quite nice even my grinder didn't get it very fine.

Sprinkling some powdered sugar on top adds just a bit of extra sweetness to balance out the yummy bitterness of the tea and cocoa. Very, very nice!

these cookies are a huge hit whenever i make them. they're great just following the recipe, but I've also modified it to make Vanilla Chai cookies by subbing 1/3 cup of flour for the cocoa and chai tea for earl grey.

I Love these cookies! I halved the amount of cocoa powder and used 8 earl grey tea bags. Next time might make it 9 or 10 to up the flavor even more! Sprinkled powder sugar on top to finish them off for a snowy look. I can't stop eating them!

A very good cookie although I did think the cocoa overpowered it a little. I used the tea from three Twinings Earl Grey tea bags (about 3 tsp) and it was already so finely ground that I didn't do anything more with it. Next time I may use more tea. I also added 1/2 tsp almond extract, which added a bit more depth to the flavor, and 1/8 tsp salt. I chilled the dough for about half an hour, then rolled it into balls, flattened them slightly and pressed them into colored sugar before baking. I think my cookies were bigger than the recipe intended since I only got 2 1/2 dozen and I had to cook them 9 minutes instead of 7 or 8 as other people have reported. They still looked very underdone when they come out, but I let them cool on the pan for about 5 minutes before moving them to a rack, and by then they were perfect.

I made some substitutions - margarine for butter, egg replacer for egg - and I didn't have a coffee grinder, but the cookies turned out wonderfully. I used the advice of other reviewers and only baked 7 minutes. I guess I made my cookies too small, because I ended up with ~60, but all the better for portion control!

These are so excellent. Really, they're a thing I often long for now. I put in a bit more tea than called for, but that's just a matter of taste. What great little tea cakes they would make; they are actually more of a cake than biscuit, arn' they ?

Delicious and very easy to make. Chocolate-y and the hint of bergamot is great. I am okay at baking but these were easy for me. The only thing I didn't quite do right, I left them in longer than the instructions said because they seemed too soft.

I love recipes that use tea and these were exceptional! They were moist, different and absolutely tasty!
