I loved this however i was 100% confident that my kids wouldn't go for the hot sauce so I made my own sauce. I soaked the bacon in 3 tbsp of Soy sauce, 1 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce, 1 tbsp of Maple syrup and 1 tbsp of White wine. OMG It was good!!!!!! The kids ate all of their veggies last night.

This is my recipe and I appreciate everyone trying it and giving it an honest review.   I want to say that I do not recommend cooking these on a grill where the grease will be exposed to flames.   The flare ups could be uncontrollable.   I strongly recommend that you use a tray or some other means to keep the grease above the flames.  Thank you again for trying this recipe.

This was awesome! I mean who doesn't love bacon, asparagus and sriracha?! I had planned on cooking this on the grill, but it rained, so I put them in the oven on 400 degrees for about 25 minutes. I turned them once and they turned out great. My family and friends loved them!

AWESOME!!!!! We LOVE bacon AND sriracha, so I knew this was gonna be a hit, and it was. Great combo of flavors w/ the spicy sriracha, smokey/salty bacon and the fresh flavor of the asparagus. This is a keeper and a new family favorite~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

Absolutely amazing! Gotta love these simple recipes that POP with flavor! Due to poor planning on my part, I ran out of propane, so I threw them in the oven at 400F for 20 minutes, turning halfway through and they were perfectly done. I imagine they'd be even better on the grill. I will also try these in the smoker. New favorite in this house! I bet this would make an asparagus lover out of anyone!

I used 2 spears instead of 3 and pizza sauce. I also added some provolone cheese on top for the last 5 minutes of cooking. Turned out well, I like how quick and easy it was. A great fun way to enjoy asparagus!

These were delicious..addictively delicious! I'm sure these are excellent with Sriracha, but unfortunately I could not use it. Instead, I combined some Balsamic Dressing with Maple Syrup and a little cayenne. Grilled in a foil tray and they came out perfect. All we could think of after eating these was making them again and even in the smoker! Thanks for a delicious and different way to make asparagus!

I'm not a fan of sriracha and didn't want to buy a bottle just for this.  But I absolutely LOVE Chipotle Tabasco, so it was an easy substitution.  These skewers turned out perfectly.  They cooked a lot faster than I expected.  The bacon was crispy and done in about 11 minutes total.  I will definitely make these again.

Really an exceptional recipe. Very easy to make. I used turkey bacon and baked it in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes. Came out just wonderful. As others noted, the heat from the sriracha mellows out when cooked with the bacon. The end result is spicy and quite tasty  but not very hot.

bacon wrapped anything is delicious.  the idea to put sriracha on it is genius.  i cut the spears in half and used half a strip of bacon to wrap them.  it makes it more bite sized.

First time I made the recipe following the exact ingredients  from the recipe, and it was totally yummy. 
Second time I was making it for a party and couple of children weren't crazy about spicy food so, so l did half and half. I did the second half with a balsamic honey dressing.... Everyone enjoyed them both. 
All gone by the end of the party.

What an incredible recipe! The Siracha sauce adds that little bit of kick just to liven up the dish! I made this along side some breaded pork chops bad it was a perfect match!! Will definitely make these again!!

What an excellent idea! I made a batch for my lunch..just to try it out. It was great. As with any cook I modified a bit by adding some minced garlic inside the wrap.

My bacon-wrapped asparagus came out perfect.  The only change I made was baking them at 400 degrees for 40 minutes.  This will be a part of my menu next week.

Awesome recipe!  I used 2 strips of bacon for each bundle and  instead of sriracha sauce, I used the Jaymo's Heat & Sweat sauce....mmmmm.  Just keep turning on the grill till the bacon is the crispiness you prefer.  No leftovers!

Soooo good and flavorful with just 3 ingredients, super easy to make.  We made this for Easter - used 2 lbs asparagus and 1 lb. bacon. We used 4 asparagus spears wrapped with 1 slice bacon and still had 3 slices bacon left. My daughter helped put this together and she was skimpy with the siracha sauce but didn't need to as the bacon really mellows out the hotness of the sauce. Only had one person out of 19 that complained of the hotness. I like hot spicy foods so next time I make this I will be generous with the siracha which really does not make it hot due to the bacon, just adds so much awesome flavor (in my opinion). Only had 1 left so almost everyone loved it!
Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Loved this! On my second batch I added some goat cheese.  And I didn't use toothpicks for either batch so you can get by without if you want. Enjoying flavors!

My first time trying this one. Rather than the grill, I cooked them on my favorite cast iron skillet over medium heat, turning frequently. My wife, who shoes away from anything spicy, loved them!

It was a hit! I made my wraps with at least six stocks of asparagus and I actually did them in the oven using the broiler. I broiled for 17 minutes on high on a lower rack and they were perfect. The only thing I probably could’ve done was turned them so that they would have broiled evenly and the bacon would have cooked on the backside. But I will definitely be making this again!

Prepared as written, this was so easy and the flavor was just incredible!  I paired this with marinated half chicken on the grill and stuffing that I created at the spur-of-the-moment. (Recipe will be shared on the site) 
Tip:  The Sriracha that I get from Aldi has great flavor and comes in a squirt bottle which is so convenient for putting this recipe together.   Lay out your bacon strip; squirt on your Sriracha; wrap from bottom end of asparagus bundle & secure each end with toothpicks. 
I grilled all in a foil-lined, mesh grill basket as directed in the recipe. 
Try this!  You won't be disappointed! ??

So totally forgot to add the hot sauce before, so I poured a bit onto my fingers and rubbed it on the bacon after they'd been wrapped. Still came out amazing and my family didn't know the difference! I left on the gill on Medium heat (about 350 degrees) for a good 30 min. Be sure to coat the aluminum foil pan in olive oil so that they will come out easily!

I used less siracha and some hoisen sauce as my wife doesn't like spicy hot. Still to spicy. Other than the spiciness it was flavorful and delishious. That's the reason for four stars just too spicy. I can't imagine if I had used straight siracha sauce how this would be a mouth burner.

I absolutely love this recipe! Instead of sriracha, I used Red Hot, hot sauce and lightly coated the bacon for a hint of flavor before grilling and they turned out amazing. Family favorite recipe.

I've done this similar only without the siriacha and used prosciutto with a little garlic salt instead of bacon. Huge hit when cooked on my big green egg.

Really enjoyed these. Not spicy at all.  Just a nice zip to them. Did in a foil pan on BBQ with barbecued steelhead trout. Cooked in the same amount of time. I just did 2 stalks in each bundle.

A delightfully delicious grilled veggie that I'll make many times!  Just the right combo of fresh, salty and spicy!  Bonus...super simple to prepare!'n

GREAT!!! I used asparagus fresh out of the garden, I bunched 4 stalks together because they were very slender.  The combination of bacon and Sriracha was perfect.  I used a grill pan for more flavor because I grill with charcoal. Perfect and easy!

Loved this,  And so easy to make. I would use more hot sauce next time so they are more spicy.

Very good!  I would recommend the larger variety of asparagus, but worst either way.
