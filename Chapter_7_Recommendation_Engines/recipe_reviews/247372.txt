Made these for my husband as he loves meatballs alot.
Serving them tomorrow at Christmas eve dinner..but he already tasted them and loves them.  I made my own meatballs as I had meat defrosted and needed to be used. These are so easy quick  and really tasty. Thanks Jody!

My husband had 3 servings. The meatballs stayed in the crockpot on low most of New Year's day and my husband and adult sons came in an "noshed". Didn't change anything.
