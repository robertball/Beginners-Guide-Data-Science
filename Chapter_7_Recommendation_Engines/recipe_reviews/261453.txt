EXCELLENT!!! My family loved it. I tasted the sauce and it was too tangy for my taste and needed a little more balancing. I added 2 additional tablespoons of brown sugar 2 teaspoons of molasses and 1 tablespoon of sriracha. Perfection! I don't care for the idea of mushy cashews so I added those just before serving. I didn't realize that this recipe called for a multi-function pressure cooker until it was too late to turn back (oops!) so I just threw it in a regular slow cooker. Since the chicken was already mostly cooked from being pan fried this wasn't an issue at all. I served over basmati rice with broccoli.

Family loved it. I added the broccoli about the last 20 minutes of cooking time and added 2 tablespoons of white sugar for little extra sweet. The cashews in the last 10 minutes for extra crunch.
