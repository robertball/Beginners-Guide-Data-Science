What a good flavor combination.  I used EVOO instead of vegetable, and used liguine because it was what I had on hand, otherwise followed the recipe completely.  The flavor was very good, a great combination of flavors, and not your regular pasta dish.  However the flour measurement is way off.  I think 1/4 of a cup is plenty, if not too much.  I definitely recommend adding in little by little until you get the consistancy desired.  Overall very flavorful, but wish I didn't use as much flour as called for.  Thank you for sharing, I will most likely make this again.

Good, quick pasta sauce!  I added some basil, parsley, and parmesan cheese.

Not bad.  Something gave it a slight bitter flavor though, perhaps too much rosemary?  I might make this again in a pinch, as it is healthy and the ingredients are commonly on hand.

Different, and good.  I especially like the fact that these are ingredients I almost always have on hand.  I used EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) instead of vegetable oil, as Mandy Sue recommended.  I did not have green peppers, so I omitted that ingredient.  I combined the last two fresh garden tomatoes of the year with some diced canned tomatoes and accidentally put "too much" in, so I doubled the other critical ingredients and ended up with way more than I needed.  No problem, we'll eat the rest later!  This is a flexible recipe, one that can be tweaked with spices, volume, and other ingredients.

Flour is necessary I think (I mean with pasta!) and made it sticky. Made without the green bell pepper.

Real nice and I love the idea that it is made with fresh goodies I was able to get from my garden.  The only problem I had with it was the flour.  Like others I used only 1/4 cup which seemed to be right, but next time I will not just dump the flour in.  I ended up with lots of little flour clumps.  Other than that, wonderful.  I am sure that I will make it again.
