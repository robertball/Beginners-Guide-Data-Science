I enjoyed this pie. it is simple to make and seemed to be a hit. for the crumb mixture i found that i needed 1/2 cup instead of 1/4c. it was pasty not crumbly  with 1/4c.

Delicious light pie. I might advise, though, to precook a little bit pastry, for I've had big troubles taking the pie out of the pan. I omitted lemon extract, but may add lemon zest next time. The filling is absolutely excellent "plain" as well.

Great tasting pie! Wonderful use of extra pears on hand! Doubled topping and used softened butter instead of melted butter, cutting in with pastry cutter. Terrific pie! Will serve to guests!

This recipe was as delicious as it was easy.  I substituted some of the sour cream with low-fat yogurt and added currants.  Everyone who tasted it raved about it.  Will be using this recipe a lot.

We thought this was very good too.  I made it like pudding in small individual ramakins and didn't mess with the crust at all.  Added crushed pecans to the mix as my pears were real ripe and kind of mushy and I wanted some texture.  I didn't have lemon extract so used a little lemon peel.  I did put a little cinnamin in with the topping, but no other changes.  I liked the slight almond flavor.  I would love to try this with other fruit as one reviewer suggested.  Very easy and a keeper.

My family enjoyed this. I also made more topping. My daughter thought the almond conflicted with the pear flavor. The next time I added an extra 1/2 tsp. of vanilla and omitted the almond. I liked both versions. I used Bartletts as we have a tree. Nice when the tree is full.

Delectable!  The topping is great.  Make extra!  The almond extract makes the flavour so smooth!  Not a bad choice healthwise, too!

While living in Japan I found a great love for the Nashi/pearapple grown there. Luckily, they are imported to Australia, where I am living now. I bought a whole box and needed a recipe to cook some of them. I found this recipe and it is the ONE!!! I only made one change in that I added some apple pie spice, it was wonderful. I made it for my sewing group and it was a hit. I am now making copies for everyone! Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!!

Was an excellent way to use up the ripe pears I had on hand.  I did make extra of the crumb topping for the pie...and had to cook it a bit longer as the pears that weren't as ripe took longer to soften.

I was disappointed with this. It did not have a strong flavor even with all of the extracts. I was hoping for more. Not a bad pie overall though - easy to make and very light, but not a favorite.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. The only complaint I got was that I only made one pie. LOL! It was delicious. I did have to bake it a little longer than the recommended time. Next time I will put foil on the edges of the crust so they don't get too dark due to the length of time required to cook the pears.

Wonderful! My husband and I don't really like pie but this was great. I had my pear slices soaking in lemon juice so they wouldn't brown so I didn't use the lemon extract. Only change and this was great. I'll definately make it again.

I agree with the previous rater who was in the minority.  If zero stars were available that's what I've give this.  Not only my opinion but that of the 3 adults in our house.  A waste of my time and ingredients.  Flavorless filling, even though I used ripe Bartletts.  I don't think even adding some spices would help.

Different but really good. I was short on sour cream, so I used cottage cheese blended smooth instead. This would be good with other fruit. Next time I will try pineapple.

Huge hit! I used overripe Bartlett pears and it came out delicious and with a great texture. A light taste and extremely easy to make.

This was enjoyed by all who tried it.  I made the topping as written and had to throw it out, there was no way it was going to go from goop to crumbly.  I started over and used cold butter which I cut in and that worked out beautifully.

Loved this pie, as has everyone who's tried it. I was looking for a pear pie that was not trying to be an apple pie. I used lemon zest in place of lemon extract and doubled the topping recipe. I also pre-baked the crust for 5 minutes before pouring in the filling.

I never knew what to do with all the pears on our pear tree, but now I do! I also doubled the crumble for the topping and it was easier to use softened margarine instead of melted.

Delightful, I used brown sugar instead of white and prebaked the crust wrapping the edge with foil so it wouldn't brown. I also used more flour in the topping and then added sliced candied almonds (Trader Joes) on top of the crumbs - yummy!!

I was really impressed with this pear pie. However, I did make a couple of changes. I used sugar substitute (my husband's diabetic) and I used Greek yogurt because I didn't have sour cream.

 The pie crust I used was made with oil and mixed in the pan and pressed right in the pie plate, not rolled out. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I thought the lemon extract was too powerful and took away from any pear flavor. This is definitely a keeper!

We used an oreo crumb crust and added a few cherries to the filling, and it worked well.  The surface stayed pasty white, even when we baked it for 15 minutes more than the recommended time, so we ended up  putting the oven on broil for a couple of minutes to make it brown.  My family thought it tasted even better straight from the fridge the next day.

It was okay. I won't make again. I added dried cranberries. Glad I did or it would have been just Pears in a slightly chalky white stuff with a tasty crumb crust.

Our neighbors have a pear tree, so we are always baking "pear something".  Since he gives me the pears (He never uses them), I always make extra goodies for them. I am not a big fan of apple pie so I was hoping this wouldn't taste like too much like apple pie. It doesn't at all!   This is a delicious pie!  
I get requests to make this pie from everyone now. :-)

Couple things I do different:   double the lemon and almond extracts, and added lots of cinnamon (never measured, just tasted eyeballed it) I also doubled the topping.
