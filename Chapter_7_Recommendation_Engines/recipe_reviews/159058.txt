I will absolutely make this again, but it only gets 4 stars because I doubled the spices and changed the cooking method of the mushrooms and onions.  I did brown my pork chops, then cooked them for 5 hours on low, but I think they would have been done in 4.  I sauteed the mushrooms (used two containers of fresh because I like them), onion, 3 cloves of garlic (once clove would never be enough for me), olive oil and a half cup more of marsala until the onions were translucent.  Then I added that to the pot the last hour.  My husband and I LOVED it.  I served it with roasted red potatoes seasoned with rosemary, olive oil, salt and pepper.  Super yummy, but I changed the proportions of the ingredients and cooking method so only 4 stars.

To be honest, I haven't tasted the finished product yet ... it's in the crockpot now, and it smells heavenly.  I took several reviewers' suggestions -- saute onions, mushrooms, garlic and add low-sodium beef broth -- they made good sense.  But I was surprised by the amount of flour I had left over after dredging 8 boneless chops; I threw away about 3/4 cup seasoned flour.  No wonder so many said the seasoning seemed non-existant.  I think there was plenty of seasoning, but next time I'll mix it in 1/4 cup flour -- that should be plenty and it will perk up the spice level. Thank you for the recipe, D-

This was great!  Couldn't believe how tender the pork was! My husband said reminded him of a pork roast b/c it was so tender. Put in crock pot at 11:15 & took out at about 5:30 after having cooked on low.  I did not use butterfly chops, used thicker cut as thought would be better for cooking so long as the recipe says.  The gravy was very good & plenty for the two of us!  Served with pasta, green beans & garlic breadsticks. It was very good!

I took the advise of other reviewers and sauted the onions, garlic and mushrooms prior to adding them to the pot.  I also increased the garlic and doubled the mushrooms.  This was quite tasty but I couldn't really taste the Marsala even though I doubled the amount (we really like Marsala).  Next time I may use a less expensive wine.  Otherwise this came out delicious and the gravy was yummy.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was yummy but a note to those who have new crock pots, 6 hours on low was waaay too long.  It dried out the meat immensely.  You might want to try 4 to 5 instead.  And the sauce could stand to be a bit thicker.  Might want to add some flour after you pull the pork out to thicken it up.  Flavors were great though.

This is delicious!!!  I think it is very important to carmelize (brown in oil) the onions first, it really adds to the appearance.  The next time I make this I will use extra garlic and salt.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I've had this in my recipe box to try for nearly 3 weeks - all b/c of not having the marsala wine - which is a MUST! I finally got around to making this last night -and I'm sold!  The pork was SO tender, and the sauce was a perfect compliment!  For the mushrooms, I chose to use baby ports which I sauteed in butter.  I made this exactly as instructed - and it was wonderful!    I read another poster had problems w/ the sauce being runny...the reason why -this poster acknowledged having added MORE wine than was called for - I think the problem is solved.   This will be added to my "tried & true" crockpot recipe collection.  Thanks for sharing!

This was very good. I only made a small change and that I didn't use Marsala wine because I didn't have any. I used a very nice Italian wine I had open. The flavor was terrific.

I didn't bread the pork and brown it.  I used a 2 pound pork tenderloin and threw it in whole with all the dry ingredients (minus the flour).  Before serving I shredded/cut up the tenderloin which helped to absorb some of the moisture of the sauce, which is quite runny.  This made it the perfect consistency for putting it over noodles.  My family liked it.

Great recipe!!! The only changes that were made was to saute the onion and mushrooms before transferring  to the slow cooker. Also low sodium beef stock was added along with the Marsala wine to make more gravy. Comfort food at it's best.

I thought this was a great recipe. I did make some changes. I used country style ribs instead of pork chops. I browned the ribs but did not dredge them. I put 1/2 cup flour and all the seasonings into the crockpot and poured the wine over them. I omited the cream of mushroom soup becuase I hate canned condensed soups. I had A LOT of ribs. I cooked them for about 7 hours on low and they were fall off the bone tender. Everyone in my family thought it was fantastic. I am adding this to our crock pot go-tos.

Not bad. The sauce was nice and rich and adding sauted mushrooms and onions like recommended by other viewres really heightens the taste and adds a bit of sweetness. I added a dollop of sourcream and sprinkled paprika on the individual servings and my family liked it quite a bit. I do think we prefer chicken marsala but the pork was not bad.

This was very good. I used 3/4 cup of flour and I think about 1/4 cup would be about enough.  I hated to see all the seasoning in the left-over flour not being used to season the dish, so I added the same amount of seasoning ingredients to the mushroom/wine mixture to make up for what was lost in the left-over unused flour.   I subsituted a white semi-sweet wine for the masala.  In the end the chops turned out delicious.

The changes I made was to add more garlic (2-3 cloves more), use white wine (that's all I had), simmered the onions and mushrooms for 15 mins adding the garlic in the last 5 mins) and add this to the slow cooker in the last hour of cooking. 4 hours of total cooking time was enough.  My husband said it was the BEST pork he has ever had. This will stay in my recipe box.

I thought this was okay.  Next time I will use less wine (1/2), I thought it was to strong tasting.  I also dont drink wine so that may have been why.  I do like it in food recipes though.  Thanks for sharing.

Very good recipe - pretty basic for a roast. I used a 2 1/2 pound pork loin instead of chops, added about 1 pound fresh button mushrooms (halved) and 1 pound of baby carrots. I didn't use the marsala, but substituted low sodium chicken broth instead and added a little extra since I was using a loin. I cooked mine for about 5 hours, and added a little extra flour to thicken the sauce up a bit after taking out the pork. I really like the egg noodle suggestion, so I served mine over egg noodles with the roasted carrots and mushrooms on the side along with steamed broccoli. The pork from this recipe was absolutely delicious and moist.

I made this tonight for dinner and my family loved it...they are HUGE fans of chicken marsala so I thought this was a neat idea..Only thing I would change is maybe to add a little salt and pepper once its all in the crockpot. It was slightly bland but no biggie...we just salt and peppered to taste after it was done.

Delish!  I used 2 small tenderloins instead of chops and didn't bother browning first.  Doubled the marsala since I had more meat than the recipe called for.  We all enjoyed very much.

This was good and easy.  I didn't bother browning the chops first, I just threw them in frozen.  It needs a little more seasoning/flavor to make it a five star.

Used 6 bone in pork chops and baby portabella mushrooms, sautéed the veggies after browning the chops. Used leftover red wine as that is what I had and cooked on low for 6 hours. Incredible aroma while cooking and outstanding flavor!

This recipe is fantastic! I didn't use the wine, but made the rest as directed. The meat was very tender and tasted incredible. I think this is the best slow cooker pork recipe I have tried so far. Will definitely be making this again!

I loved this!  I had all the ingredients on hand (except for fresh garlic, but most of my family don't like a lot of garlic anyway).  I added some Cavender's Greek seasoning to the flour dredge, but I add that to most everything I cook.  I took one reviewer's advice and whisked together the wine (I used red wine) and the soup.  I also added fresh mushrooms and sauteed the onions. I only used 4 chops. I cooked this for 5 1/2 hours in a solar oven.  Pork chops were falling off the bone and I loved the sauce.    YUM!!

Hmmm. Not what I was expecting. I must admit... neither me or my bf like mushrooms, but we DO like mushroom sauces (i.e. without actual bits of mushrooms) and cream of mushroom soup. We thought this might be good with the acutal fungi removed. Not really. The pork chops had an odd texture (i.e. more like ribs) that just didn't suit us. The gravy (although runny) was good, but there wasn't enough of it, even though I used an entire can of soup and a tad more than 1/2 c. of wine for half the recipe. The pork chops were bland despite the dredging/frying step. I sauteed my onion (1.5 small sliced onions) and 2 cloves of garlic (we LOVE garlic) in the browned bits and a little more oil, but their taste was also non existent. One comment to those who want to try this: be sure to mix your soup/wine together with a wire wisk BEFORE adding to your slow cooker. It makes a difference and gives the two ingredients a chance to equally blend. Served with a side of Parmesan noodles (i.e. Knorr) and garlic bread. Thank goodness for sides! Sorry, but I will not be making this again.

This did not turn out the way I thought it would, but to judge the recipe for what it was, it was good.

My husband doesn't eat mushrooms, or i should say until he had this dish...I used 1 tsp. of yellow mustard and crushed fresh garlic because i didn't have dry on hand and it was wonderful...trying some capers in it tonight. Wnjoy this recipe...Egg Noodles Rock with this as well...  :)

I followed suggestions and used 1/2 cup flour and Greek seasoning. Then used 2 Tbsps. left over mix in a little water as a thickener and added that about 1 hour before it was finished. Also used Prosecco instead of Marsala.  It was very good and very tender.  Next time I will use Marsala and C. of Mushroom Soup with Roasted Garlic.

Some foks complained about lack of seasoning so I just dumped them into the sauce. That solved that problem and how.  Then they seemed overwhelming, especially the rosemary. Won't make again

I thought this recipe was awesome. I believe the ingredients tasted wonderful without spending the time to saute the onions and mushrooms.  If you have the time great, but I don't.  I also substituted the chops for a pork sirloin roast and it was yummy!  Great meal during the work week!!

I used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic and doubled the mushrooms and increased the Marsala wine (to compensate for extra mushrooms)- it came out great!! Definitely will make it again, but will decrease onions  (by at least half) and toss in some shallots.

I didn't have rosemary  so used thyme and marjoram instead.  Fresh rosemary  would have been better.  Baby Bella mushrooms were good.  Sweet Marcella  wine would probably have been better than  the dry I used.  Served on a bed of rice.

I made this dish last night for dinner, following the recipe as written. While the dish wasn't terrible, it had very little flavor. There was only the faintest taste of the Marsala, and little garlic or Rosemary flavor either. I've made several Marsala dishes on the stovetop, and have a favorite crockpot pork dish which uses dry gravy mix and canned mushroom soup, and my husband and I agreed we'd stick to those recipes from now on.

AWESOME! But I did not flour and brown the chops, I seasoned them with the dry seasonings (omitted the garlic cloves, since I was out and increased garlic powder) and added some McCormick Grillmates steak seasoning and carmalized the onion and mushroms together. I also added my potatoes on top.

This one was more of a 3.5 for me.  It wasn't bad and was pretty easy to make, it just wasn't stellar.   I may keep it around for the future, but I don't forsee having a real craving to make this again.

Great recipe with potention to be 5 stars for me!  I would definitely bump up the spices.  I'm not sure if I would double them but would increase the i garlic and rosemary; doubling the marsala wine might be too much for me.  I sauteed the onions and mushroom then added the chops to the pan to give it more flavor.  Thanks!

I've made this twice, the first time exactly as written. It was good, but it needed more flavor. The 2nd time, I used the same ingredients as the recipe, but I doubled the seasonings, mushrooms and wine.....wallah.....it was fantastic! I guess, as with any recipe, personal preference is what it's all about. Very good combinations of flavors though. Thanks!

Great easy slow cook recipe. I read some of the other reviews and since I love mushrooms & onions I doubled them plus added an extra cup of the marsala, a cup of low sodium beef stock since I think it made the sauce too thick once I added the flour. I cooked my chops in 3.5 hrs. since my crock pot cooks super fast. I thought cooking it for 6 hrs. was too long as well so I cut the time in half. Lastly I added more mushrooms at the end just for presentation and my family loved it. (No leftovers). Please, please sautee mushroom & Onions prior to adding to crockpot plus add extra garlic. It makes it all taste soooo yummiiii.

The biggest thing i so different is use 1/2 cup white wine with 2 tsp brandy as a substitute for the Marsala wine. It is so good i have never gone out and bought Marsala, but i always have sauvignon blanc, which i usually use, or i have used Chardonnay. This has become a standard at my house. You do not need 1 cup flour, 1/2 C usually will do, but use the same amount of spices in flour. I do think carmelizimg the onions really helps and sautéing the mushrooms, but I have made it without and is still good. I serve over rice. It makes a,good gravy right in the pot. I usually cook on low about 4- 41/2 hours. Have made in 3-1/2 on high. My old, original "crock pot" could go 6 hours, but not my new slow,cooker. Have made for company and everyone see,s to love it.

My whole family loved this. The pork chops were so tender we did not need knives to cut them. Was great served over broad egg noodles. Will definitely make this again. Will try it with the onions carmelized next time.

Made this last night and was a hit. Porkchops so tender. I did take the advice for my picky eaters that do not like mushrooms and mixed the soup and wine in my Blend tec. then left the mushrooms till the end and sauteed them in butter garlic and marsala and served on top. this dish goes well with baked herb red potatos and green beans.

The family loved it, and we will add it to the keeper file. I went with the advise and sauteed the onions and mushrooms but used olive oil. Cooked to perfection in 6 hours in my pot on low.  Thanks for sharing.

This was excellent! I made some slight changes but didn't drastically alter the recipe.  I reduced the flour from 1 cup to 1/4 cup.  It was more than enough and I poured remaining flour with seasoning on top of pork chops in the crockpot. I used 2tsp of dry rosemary instead of fresh. I was worried it would be too much, but it was just fine. By the way, didn't find this recipe bland at all. It was so tasty! I followed the recipe for the onions/mushrooms and did not saute them as many reviewers suggested. It was easier not to saute and I can't imagine how the result would have differed because our mushrooms and onions were very nicely cooked. Used 98% fat free cream of mushroom because it was all the store had but I'm glad that I did for a slight improvement to the health grade! Finally, I used cream sherry instead of marsala - my boyfriend loves "marsala" recipes but his mother uses cream sherry for her marsala. We had the same amount of pork as recipe calls for, but only 4 individual chops. Cooked on low for just under 6 hours and it was perfect. Pork was almost fall apart tender. Plenty of very creamy "gravy" and all around a good and EASY meal! I served this with peas/green beans and mashed potatoes. Mm mm!

I made this according to directions and it turned out awesome. The only thing I did slightly different was to season the chops after layering in the crock pot. The gravy turned out perfect, nice and thick. Perfect dish.

I followed this recipe to make chicken breasts in the slow cooker and it came out awesome.  The chicken was fully cooked after 5 hours on low and I servedit over egg noddles.  I'll use pork next time.  This recipe is a keeper!

I made this 2 weeks ago for dinner, it was wonderul! I didnt have any pork chops so I used a pork roast; I was unable to cook the roast before hand so I coated it with the flour and seasonings,  and added a teaspon of dijon mustard. The gravey was really good and had a good thickness to it.I will definitely be making this again.
