This was a fun cake to make, and very easy.
I made this exactly as directed, but used a heart shaped silicone pan instead of a springform. It came out perfectly and the bake time was spot on.

I made mine in a Bundt cake pan with center cone. Next time I'll add another five minutes to make 30 minutes. Was delicious, like a big, soft chocolate chip cookie on a plate!

We made it on a rainy day & it was perfect to lift everyone's spirits!   Easy to make,  we used white chocolate pudding instead of vanilla, you could play with this ingredient until you find something your family loves.  Easy to make with kiddos!  (We used a round traditional 10 inch cake pan, came out great.)

This is exactly what I was looking for! My son does not like regular cake, but loves the fondant decorated cakes that I do, so this was a perfect option for his birthday. I made two and stacked them to sculpt a skull. It gave me the perfect height and texture for an amazing sculpted fondant covered birthday treat for him.

Amazing way to make cookies. Everyone went for more.  I appreciate the picture of the piece of cake since I was concerned it was under cooked. Iâ€™ll definitely make again.
