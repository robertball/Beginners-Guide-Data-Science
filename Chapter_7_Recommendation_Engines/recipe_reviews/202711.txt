Great last minute recipe. I used canned salmon, as it's all I had, and I was having one of those "what am I making for dinner?!!" moments, searched salmon and pasta and lo and behold this one came up. I added zuchini. It was excellent!

Delicious!  We used whole wheat pasta, and tossed in some shrimp.  Thanks for sharing!

I make a similar dish often. I like adding the tomatoes last, uncooked, when using a white sauce. You can also use a little smoked salmon or bacon instead of filets, don't use too much or you'll overpower the sauce.

Of course I give it a 5! But when I submitted this recipe, I did not list a specific pasta...choose your favorite (I love angel hair), cooked to your preferred firmness.  Also, I love tomatoes!  I put in 4-6 romas diced.

This was pretty good! Very simple and easy to tweak for your tastes. We followed it almost exactly, only used home-grown cherry tomatoes and half a can of diced tomatoes that had to get used up. We also added cayenne pepper to give it a little zest. Will make again - thanks for a quick and easy salmon dish!

I was really skeptical about using tomateoes with salmon...I'd never done salmon that way before.  But this was wonderful!  It looks and sounds fancy, but is really easy.

I wanted to wait a couple of days to see how I really felt about this dish. I regret using canned tomatoes (all I had in the house) because it didn't help it at all. I needed to add easily 2-3 more cloves of garlic to offset the tomatoes. I will try the recipe again, but I'm just not sure about including salmon. Not amazing...not horrible. I'll review again after I make changes.

Excellent dish!  The salmon came out so moist and tender.  The only change I made was to use a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh.  I also used 1 tsp. dried basil since I didn't have any fresh (it's winter).

Very simple, and very good. Could use a little kick. Next time I may take the advice and try red pepper flakes!

I gave this 5 stars because it is really quick and easy and it tastes delicious. It only took about 30 minutes from start to finish. It is a perfect meal to throw together when you are in a rush. I added about 3x as much garlic and I used some tomatoes I had on hand. I don't know what they were. But they weren't romas. I think it would be good with some spinach thrown in. I will definately make this again.

I roasted the salmon with 3 cloves of garlic. Didn't have an onion. Then added to the tomatoes and olive oil. It was a little bland so I added a little dill. Definitely needs salt and pepper. All I had was grocery store tomatoes that weren't that great.  This would be so much better with fresh summer tomatoes and basil.

Good basic recipe. Chopped tomatoes good, but not enough accent. Would suggest either an addition of tomato sauce. or a 1/2 cup of Marinara. Salmon prep is right on , although I used a dash of white wine and lemon pepper while steaming. I also used mini farfalle (new to me) as the pasta and found it a great size for this dish.

I prefer to add two cans of Fire Roasted Tomatoes, a little more fresh garlic and a handful of Capers. It gives a little more juice so that I have an excuse (like one is needed!) to get a loaf of french bread.

I just finished making this. Very delicious, but in my opinion not too flavorful. I also added scallops since my mom and I love scallops. The pasta probably would've tasted better if I didn't use can salmon too.
I highly recommend this recipe if you have the ingredients at home.

Ive made this recipe as written a few times and it's wonderful and simple, but this time I tried a few suggestions from other commenters and it was amazing. While steaming I added a few dashes of lemon pepper and a splash of white wine. Then while mixing in pasta and tomatoes I added a simple white sauce. Fantastic! My husband had two huge helpings. Thank you so much for the recipe! It will be in my rotation.

As written this was a little too bland. I added a spoonful of sour cream to each serving and that really seemed to help add flavor.

Delicious, used whole grain spaghette which worked well. Thought it was a bit oily and will reduce the olive oil next time. Removed some oil by blotting it with paper towel and added moisture by adding 1/4 cup white wine and a table spoon of seafood sauce. It enhanced the flavor.

I had leftover pasta and salmon so this was perfect!  I even used some grape tomatoes that I’d frozen because they were past their prime but great for soups and in this case this meal. Also used dried basil but about a third the amount of fresh. Talk about quick and easy peasy!  Will definitely make again!

Delicious. Made it to the T. Used 2 cups of cherry tomatoes as that is what I had from the garden, fresh basil, angel hair pasta. Seasoned the salmon fillets with lemon pepper and salt. Threw in a handful or two of spinach that needed to be used...we loved it... will make again for sure.

Easy to  make a very tasty. Only thing that I did differently is that we had pasta left over from the night before so I followed the directions and put it in with the SALMON  
Since the pasta was dry and at room temperature I added some White wine to  moisten the Angel  hair pasta  and it came out excellent

I've made this quite a few times and it is very good!  I use a can of good diced tomatoes instead of fresh ones and it keeps the pasta moist and delicious.

I make this simple recipe regularly with Alaskan salmon. It is one of our family favorites. Use fresh tomatoes, fresh basil, plenty of garlic, good salmon, and freshly grated parmesan cheese (and a lot of it!). Absolutely delish.

In the US we've allowed our concept of Italian food to become dominated by high calorie, creamy and often difficult to prepare dishes. As a result, we're often eating it from pre-prepared ingredients with tons of additives or in restaurants, paying more for it from our pocketbooks and our health than we ought to. Italian traditions like pomodoro and cacciatore are typically light, inexpensive, easy and healthy, and dishes like this are a fantastic example. I used this recipe as a guide, but used what I had: two cans of Honeyboy boneless, skinless salmon, a 14 oz can of whole, peeled tomatoes, dehydrated basil and garlic, and a bag of cheap grated store brand Parmesan. The pasta I used was a spinach and chia variety that cooks up in 3 minutes. All in all, my family had a very enjoyable meal that cooked up in under 30 minutes with no premeditation, and from all non-perishable ingredients except for the onion, which we almost always have on hand. For the amount of food and quality of meal, it was also remarkably inexpensive. The entire yield also came in under 2000 calories, meaning the adult size portions were likely around 500-700. Meals like this are what save a busy, working middle class family's culinary life.

This is a recipes we make a lot.  We love as it is fresh and healthy.  We added triple the tomatoes and fresh basil to give it more flavor.  You will not be disappointed if you love salmon and pasta.

It was just dry, boring and lacked any sauce. Easy, yes.

 Also, keeping a lid on the pan is a way bad idea, the salmon cooked all the way through and did not get crispy. I'm not going to do that again.

Great tasting, easy, and quick!  I followed the recipe closely but not exactly -  less oil for the salmon and a few capers (2 T?) at the end.  Great summer meal!

Turned out really good. I don't like to cook but it was very easy. Used a little less than full pack of spaghettini. Added 1 extra raw tomato at end. And used the shelf Parmesan cause it cheaper. So yummy. Steamed brocolli on the side. Looking forward to leftovers tomorrow...

Forgot to put cheese in so just grated some and served it separately! It was my first time to cook anything this decent and it wasn't so bad!
