These are amazing! Following the directions precisely, they came out crunchy on the outside and delicate on the inside, like pillows! As a comment in response to the review that said there was too much filler in these... this is not a recipe for classis jumbo lump Chesepeake-style crabcakes. You should only use as much bread as you need to hold this mix together. You CANNOT use a "wonder" style bread either.
All that being said...Try these. They are wonderful!

Excellent!  I made this for Christmas dinner and my family loved it.  I used the claw meat and it was very tasty. I actually added a little extra bread because the cakes were falling apart! They did not lose the crab flavor. I will be making this again!

Too much filler(bread,hard boiled eggs)lost the taste of the crabcake.
