Yes, it's yummy and authentic. But watch out, especially when serving to guests.  It doesn't taste as boozy as it is.  It looks like a big Shirley Temple, goes down very easily, and tastes like a delicious fruit punch with a nice splash of rum. NOT!  I had to take a nap. But I do recommend it as a sipper! LOL

Made for a very tasty, fruity, not so knock-you-on-your-butt  with one little change... we replaced the amaretto with Malibu for a little more of a tropical flavor that all participants at our "hurricane tasting" really preferred.

Very good!  I like my fruit driks blended and it tasted great. Others enjoyed theirs on the rocks.   Thanks for a great drink!

Aha! Amaretto was what I was missing all this time...Almost perfect! I say almost & rated this 4 stars instead of 5 only because to be perfect, I'd have to be drinking this in New Orleans! Also, i added a splash more dark rum cuz i love it so.

This is my new signature drink. I make it differently every time depending what I have on hand.  I usually use a orange/mango mixed juice. I have used both lemonade and pineapple juice. I add all the alcohol listed, but instead of grenadine, I use Raspberry Liqueur.  It is always a hit and gone fast.

Fantastic drink.  I make Yellow Birds the same way except I substitute Galliano for Amaretto.  It's a nice way to enjoy the sunset from your sunroom.

This drink is really what has been known previously as a "Yellow Bird".  The only difference was the addition of the grenedine which changed the color. Be sure to only serve one drink to a person as this drink can make you tipsy very easily.

Super-Awesome! I used coconut rum with spiced rum and thought it turned out great! The almond, pineapple, coconut combo was really nice. So refreshing, it went down almost too smoothly!

Loved it! I followed the recipe to the letter except I added a little more grenadine than it called for. Can't wait to make these again for my next party!

Being a Brit I had only heard of this lethal weapon in that song. Then I encountered it last summer whilst on a cruise. I spent the rest of the day asleep. It is wonderful, but should carry a government health warning. This recipe is pretty much identical to the one I experienced.... Thank you for sharing.

This is an excellent concoction.  My only complaint was that it was a little strong on the rum but I am a lightweight!  I made it with Malibu coconut rum to cut down on the alcohol and add to the taste.  Next time I'd use less regular rum but all you pirates out there, enjoy the rum!

Very tasty!  Perfect compliment to a big dish of gumbo and bread pudding!  I used Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum for the "dark rum."  Wasn't as red as I remember them being on our trip to New Orleans, but still tasted good.

This would have been awesome even if we drank it out of an old shoe...hurricane glasses are definitely optional!  Delish.

Can I rate this recipe 6 stars??? It was incredible and the crowd went wild for it! It's delicious and refreshing. It doesn't get you very intoxicated, but I imagine if I added more liquor it would. Highly recommend!

Very yummmy!! I used lime juice instead of lemon as that's just what I had. My sister asked if I had put the rum in yet when she tasted it, it's that smooth!!

These are awesome! Very sweet, very refreshing, crisp and light. An energizing drink with the citrus and like my husband pointed out, these would have been even better frozen like a slushie. Wonderful tropical beachside drink! (or poolside) I made a pitcher full of these and added 1 can of Sprite at hubby's request. (Hubby doesn't like pineapple so I used Sprite as a sub, but then he said go ahead and use the pineapple juice, so I did) These are a new favorite! As hubby said, "these  blow me away", lol. I used Cruzan Estate light and dark rums, Tropicana Orange juice, and Dole pineapple juice in the carton. Thanks Kim, these are sooooo good! We will definitely be serving these at our next party or bbq this summer!

Did a little adjusting since we didn't have Amaretto on hand while we were preparing for hurricane Florence. Our drinks were very Yummy! We replaced the Amaretto with Malibu Rum and used about 1/8 tsp or less of almond extract for the flavor.

My glasses weren't big enough to hold everything, and we like our drinks strong anyways, so I halved the juices. Tastes just like I remember them from NoLa. ...or should I say, don't remember...!

Loved our trip to NoLA back in the day; wanted to recreate the Hurricane bliss.

Pros: GREAT taste. Standard ingredients, no special prep required. And, the 'Dole' brand mini pineapple juices come in the 6oz size so the proportions are easy to accomplish.
Cons: Color. But that's probably a 'marketing' thing down in The Quarter. There, it's red (kinda sick red..like you might feel if you drink too many of these) and served in a plastic cup (mostly because you can legally drink in public, just not in a glass!). Either reconcile to the muddy yellow color, serve in a 'red' solo cup (Toby Keith anyone?) or add a drop or two of red food coloring.

We added another shot (1 oz) of vodka and split this recipe between the two of us with our Jambalaya dinner.

No need for Pat O'Who-ever's mix. Just use this one and enjoy.

FAIR WARNING: Even with the extra ounce of vodka, these were not boozy at all and you might find yourself, in the morning, with a Hurricane of a Headache.

The color of this made me nervous at first, because it looks a little muddy until you add the grenadine, but the flavor was outstanding.

Absolutely delicious! This was my signature drink at a Mardi Gras themed dinner party. I changed the servings to 6 and mixed juices and alcohol in a glass pitcher. When ready to serve I just filled rock glasses with ice, poured over ice, added dash of Grenadine, orange and cherry. Everyone loved them and appreciated that they were smaller portions so they would be able to enjoy the evening without being smashed after their first drink!

This was a delightfully smooth and refreshing cocktail which was enjoyed by everyone at our Mardi Gras party.  We did substitute Malibu Coconut rum and gave everything (garnishes withstanding) a good shake in a cocktail shaker, but otherwise made it as stated.  Thank you for a great recipe that we will be putting into our drink rotation!

This was excellent. I don't care for amaretto so I didn't use it and I used coconut rum! A great drink for a hot day!
