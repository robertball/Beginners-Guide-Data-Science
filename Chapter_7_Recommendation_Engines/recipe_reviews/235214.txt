I tried this recipe but just half because I only had one packet of yeast. It came out GREAT!!!  My oldest son said it was better than at our favorite buffet restaurant so now I'm beaming! This is a keeper!

These rolls were oh so yummy and very easy to make! Definitely going to be a regular for me. I love not having to do two rise sessions, just knead, rest, shape, rise once and bake. Easy as 1-2-3. Ssooooo good, I bet these are great with a stew or soup?!?! The texture is very fluffy and the taste is even better. I love these, thanks for a great recipe! ????

These rose and looked real pretty.  Taste / flavor needed a little more sugar and needed some salt.  TOO MUCH YEAST---the taste was kind of malted --like beer flavor.   Prefer the freezer rolls to these completely.

My mom always made rolls by a recipe from an old Watkins cookbook that I’ve never been able to find. Couldn’t find any to compare with hers so stopped eating them. Tried this recipe and family loved it. Added an extra tablespoon of sugar and they loved them even more. It’s quick it’s easy and only makes 12, just the right amount. It’s not my moms Parker House rolls recipe, it’s the next best one.

Love these. I live in a very humid climate so I had to add a touch of extra flour. So easy to make and always gobbled up by my picky eaters!

The rolls tasted great. However, there were very sticky and it was hard to form them in to nice smooth rolls.  They ended up looking a bit rustic -- but again the taste and texture was great after they were baked.  Will be checking out what to do in order to make them a bit more uniform.

These are delicious and easy to make. They were a hit with the family. I used instant dry yeast instead by using the equivalent's chart online.

My husband and I loved these.  They came out just right, I wish I had taken a picture they were so pretty.  To us they came very close to a roll we used to get at a local restaurant, now closed. I will be making these again and again!!
