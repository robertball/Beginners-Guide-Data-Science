I am the poster of the recipe…here are some “Side Notes” - You can find the sponge cakes in the bakery and/or produce department. They're typically used to make strawberry shortcakes. Also, the can of crushed pineapple did not contain enough juice on our last trip, so I used some of the liquid from the jar that the maraschino cherries came in. Also, some clarification on the cooking, you’ll want to pull embers from the main part of the fire and not cook directly in the campfire(I do about 95% of my camp cooking via the campfire). I have an adjoining ring branched off the main fire where I pull embers and do my cooking..either using a grate (pots/skillet) or cooking in the embers (foil packs, corn/potatoes, dutch oven). You can regulate the temp a little better this way..adding more embers or taking embers away if needed.

what a refreshing change from the standard s'more!  The first time I tried it didn't go so well.  After following the instructions they burned.  So 10 minutes in the embers is just too much.  A few minutes on the grate not directly over a flame works very well!!

really really really good idea.  Super simple.  The cakes took no time at all to heat up in the coals, ours were very hot, I think I didn't even leave them on 3 minutes, as soon as you hear steam and bubbling, they're done... and the sugar on the foil caramelizes and it's a real treat when you're out in the middle of nowhere.  Fantastic idea.

I made one change--when I made the topping, I used 1/4 cup brown sugar, four tablespoons flour, four tablespoons butter and a quarter cup pecans. I sprinkled the topping over each individual "cake". I wasn't camping when I made this--the kids and I made this in the foil packets but baked them on a cookie sheet in a 350* degree oven for about 20 minutes. This was incredibly easy to assemble and it was a big hit with everyone, even the adults. I served each "cake" with a dollop of Cool Whip. Excellent "pantry" dessert.

These were pretty good, but we didn't care to much for the smokey flavor.  
Do not put them in flames!

These were a big hit! I forgot the cherries and pecans when we went camping, so just made them without and they were gobbled up. Thanks for this great recipe!

My 16 year old daughter made this for the family while camping.  It was delicious.  We used less pineapple than called for but it was still a wonderful treat and a nice change of pace from s'mores!

We have made something similar for years but always used plain cake donuts.  I love the idea of shortcake cups because they are easy to find.  These cook quickly and should not be put directly on hot coals or they will burn.  Indirect heart  while sitting up on the grill will work.  Yummy!

Forgot to bring more foil so we just cooked the pineapple, brown sugar, and marischinos over the fire until it started to thicken and poured over the cakes. Soooo yummy!
