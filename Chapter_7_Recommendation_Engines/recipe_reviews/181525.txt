Very simple and fresh tasting. I did add about a tablespoon of melted butter only because powdered sugar can have a chalky-like under tone with too few ingredients. This was perfect as a glaze over a deep chocolate cake.

Great easy recipe to have on hand.  I like a strong orange kick, so I added 1/2 teaspoon of finely grated rind.  Ended up having to add 2 tablespoons of orange juice.  Goes well on cranberry orange nut bread.

The name of this recipe says it all--it's a simple, fresh orange glaze.  I made this to go on Big Soft Ginger Cookies (also on this site), and the combination was wonderful.  I had to use a bit more orange juice to get the right consistency for drizzling on cookies, but the results were perfect.  This is a nice glaze to have on hand for a variety of uses.

This is really good for a simple orange glaze - and it's all fresh and super easy to make! I ended up needing considerably more orange juice also, a little less than the juice from half of the orange I was using, to get the drizzly consistency I was looking for. But this was awesome!

You're going to need more orange juice! I did 1 cup confectioner's, about 1/2 teaspoon zest and 3 tablespoons juice.

this glaze was used in a cake from this site called too much chocolate cake...(LOL No such thing as too much chocolate).Any way the combination of chocolate and orange flavors goes wayyyyyy back and this was a perfect topping. many have asked for this recipie and I always steer them here. Will make this again...and again...and again!

This glaze was wonderful. I used it for the Cranberry Nut Bread I on this site, great combination. I liked the glaze very much and would use it again for other things like cookies or breakfast rolls. Thanks so much!

I have used this sooo many times.... and it is perfect.  Adjust the sugar or juice to make it as thin or thick as needed.  This time I replaced the orange zest and juice with lemon.  I have also done lime. Love it! Thanks for sharing!

This glaze was perfect on top of the butter snowflake cookies I baked.  It's very citrusy, which I love.  I had to use about 4 Tbsp of orange juice instead of 1, but it came out great.

The recipe is on to something but it needs work: The addition of butter is critical since without it the glaze lacks body. Plus, as stated above, much more juice is needed to achieve a glaze consistency.

Refreshing flavor! I added a bit of butter to make it a bit more creamy, and put it into a ziploc bag to pipe it on cranberry orange scones (from "simple scones" recipe on this site). Tomorrow, I'll be serving these to my daughter at breakfast...I already know she's gonna flip for 'em! :-)

Just made this to go on Cranberry Scones from this site. Found this glaze to have a real orange kick, more so than I'd expect from one made with orange juice concentrate. Perfect sweetness to help the scones with their slight baking soda aftertaste.

I love how uber easy this recipe was to make and a great compliment to my cranberry-orange muffins!!! I will say 1tbsp of OJ is not enough, but it's such a good starting point to gage your preferred consistency. I used approx 2 1/2 tbsps of OJ, and was PERFECT! As it glided down the muffin top, it began to stiffen and left a beautifully glazed muffin. Though after seeing the results, I was disappointed I did not have scones on hand to glaze. I'll DEFINITELY be using this recipe again.

Delicious....an easy and very fresh way to dress up a cake. I used this on Buttermilk Pound Cake II from this site...the orange was a nice citrus compliment to the lemon flavor of the cake. Thanks for the recipe!

Perfect! I needed more liquid so I just added some water, and this did not seem to dull down the orange flavor at all. Thanks so much for sharing.

Outstanding and perfect topper for pumpkin bread and cookies.  I too added the tbsp of butter and it hardens to a nice shiny glaze that tastes fresh.  Great simple recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

A very flavorful glaze.  I followed other reviewer's advice and added a bit more juice.  This was great on the Beat and Bake Orange Cake on this site.  I'll use this again - on chocolate next?

Great simple recipe. I put it on a chocolate-orange marble cake. I love the orange, so I added a little more than 2 teaspoons of zest, and I wanted a less thick consistency so upped the orange juice to 2 tablespoons. Also followed previous suggestions of adding 1 tablespoon of melted butter. Definitely will use again, and maybe try it with lemon instead.

I never mad scones before. Made them for Watching the royal wedding Prince Harry and Meghan. I used the food processor method as others suggested and used only 1/3 cup sour cream because I used fresh strawberries cut small instead of traditional raisins or currents. I did a simple glaze, whisk 1 cup using sugar, 2 tbsp milk and pinch salt.

I made this to put on cranberry pecan scones I made.  Worked great. I added a little bit more Orange Juice to flavor it more and thin it to me he right consistency. I wanted it thin enough to put on hot scones so it would run over and down the sides. It was perfect. And tasted just right.

This Orange Glaze recipe is very good, very easy. I did add a tablespoon of melted butter to rid the chalky under tones as did ALIA_26. That made a huge difference! I used two tablespoons of orange juice and for added flavor - almost a tablespoon of grated orange rind.  I made an Orange Bundt Cake and everyone loved it! Thanks!

Super simple like it says. Never made a citrus glaze before and wow! I will be making a lot more. I used blood oranges and also a tablespoon butter. Waited till my mandarin coffee cake from a box was almost completely cool. Spread it over the top of the 8x8 cake and got rave reviews!

I added about 4 tablespoons of fresh orange juice and 1/4 teaspoon more of orange zest. I used this to cover a Martha Stewart's orange yogurt cake and it was amazing!

I put this icing over orange bread on this site, taste like they both would make good sweet rolls. Like cinnamon roll very good together.

4 stars as written.  I needed a bit more juice but, more importantly, the addition of just a little melted butter to reduce the chalkiness makes it 5 stars.

The powder sugar came through a little too strongly for my taste, maybe a bit of butter as other reviewers suggested would help. Still tasty and hardened nicely!

I had to add 2 extra tablespoons of oj to make it into a glaze. I also added more zest for it to have flavor. It did have a chalky taste. I'm sorry I didn't read the reviews before I made it and add butter. What I did was add a couple drops of orange extract to overcome that taste and it was good after that.

Yummy! I used tangerine juice instead of orange, and drizzled it over cranberry orange biscotti. Delicious!
