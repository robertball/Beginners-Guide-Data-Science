Excellent!  Because it seemed like an AWFUL LOT for one pizza, I cut the eggplant and kalamata olives to about 1/3 - 1/2 of what the recipe called for.  It tasted perfect!  I also cut the cheese down to about 1/2, just as a personal preference.  Because we had lost our power, my young son suggested we grill the pizza.  Have heard of it but never attempted it myself before.  It turned out great.  I cooked the pizza straight on the grill for about 3 or 4 mins. to brown up the bottom, then put aluminum foil underneath to cook the rest of the way.  The pizza is a tad dry because of the lack of sauce, but still quite good.  I will cook future pizzas like this again, and I will make this recipe again!

The eggplant and olives make the pizza taste a little too bitter for my family's preferences.

Very easy and versatile recipe. I used a tomato sauce base so didn't use the fresh tomato but added mushrooms, salami and fetta cheese. Will definitely be using this again.
