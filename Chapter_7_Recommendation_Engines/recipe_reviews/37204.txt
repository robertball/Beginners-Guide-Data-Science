There are many recipes that I have tried that have been as easy as this recipe but surprised my in their great taste. This recipe did not produce such pleasing results. Ediable but bland bland bland. I added a little more italian seasonings, a dash on onion/garlic powder, and 1/2 tsp of chicken buillion granuels. I also tossed in some minced green onion and chopped green bell peppers. Still, no success.  Like the old cliche' goes...if it sounds too good to be true...it ussually is. Sorry, wouldn't make again.

This is the first thing that I made from this site and I love it!  My family and everyone that comes over thinks its great and it doesn't take long to cook at all.. I make it so often that I know the recipe by heart.  My family doesn't like celery so we leave it out and it still tastes great... oh and a little hint.. if you loooove cheese like we do, you should use a bit more than it calls for.. I use a whole bag of shredded cheese when I make it.  I definitly recommend this recipe !

I can't heartily recommend this recipe.  It was okay but pretty bland, even though I substituted cream of chicken dijon soup for cream of chicken and added garlic salt and pepper.  It was okay, and I do think most kids would like it; it's not that different from mac and cheese with some chicken and chicken soup added.

Too bland for my tastes, even added extra italian seasoning but still didn't add much.  Probably would be good for kids though.

Great for a busy night.  Easy and a real crowd-pleaser.  Can sub vegetable on hand (such as broccoli) for celery and other cheese (such as cheddar) for Italian blend and, of course, any other kind of pasta for rotini.

I made the chicken with garlic and pepper seasoning.  I also left the celery out, as my boyfriend and I do not eat celery.  This was surprisingly tasty, and I am definitely going to make it again!

Pretty good but I agree that it could use some more seasonings. I added garlic granules and salt and that helped

overall not bad.  Kids loved the pasta but it didn't have a whole lot of zip or pizzaz to it.

Really Good but not spicy enough.  I added some red pepper flakes, crushed pepper, and lots of salt. In addition to the Italian cheese I added 1/4cup of shredded cheddar, some Italian seasoned bread crumbs and some torn up soft taco shells that I put on top the last 5 min. to give it some crunch.
It was great, I will definately try it again.

OK but just too bland.  The sauce needs a little more zing, maybe some curry powder.  I followed the recipe exactly, but added a chopped red pepper and some spinach, to increase the vegetable content and make it a one-pot meal.

I really liked this!  I am not usually a fan of cassoroles, but this was good.  I did omit the celery, because I don't like it.  I will definitely make this again!

Unlike a lot of reviewers i didnt find this bland. Maybe because I used leftovers from a chicken roasted with lemon and garlic and used garlic and herb pasta. I substituted green bell pepper for the celery as my youngest doesnt like it and used a mature cheddar cheese as I didn't have any other cheese. I also made a vegetarian version of this for my oldest daughter with lots of veggies and celery soup. As always when i do something new we had a vote on whether to make again and it was a resounding yes. Thanks.

Very plain and kind of tasteless.  I even added a few extras and it did not help.

This is really good!  The kids absolutely loved it.  I made it also for a friend who had just had a baby, it's great for nursing moms, not too spicy.

This is a great recipe.  I doubled the recipe and added frozen broccoli (instead of celery) and a can of cream of mushroom soup also.  My 2-year-old had two helpings!  It's great to use up those chicken thighs and drumstick quarters.

I give this a 3 star only because of it's blandness.  It actually is a great, quick & easy staple recipe but had to add more seasoning and pepper!  Speaking of pepper, next time I will try adding some roasted red pepper into the mix!

I was hoping for a dish with more flavor.  Since I'm new to the kitchen, I didn't try to dress-up the recipe with extra seasoning and felt it was too bland.  However, my guests did enjoy it enough to ask for the recipe.

This was very good even with low fat cheese, soup and milk.  I made this for my lunch to take to work and over the week the celery got a little mushy but I'm sure freshly baked that's not a problem.  I added salt, but I salt everything so that might not work for everyone.
