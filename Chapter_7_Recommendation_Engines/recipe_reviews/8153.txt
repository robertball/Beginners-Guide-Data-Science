This recipe is identical to one of my mothers. It made me a hero at my OLDER brother's 60th birthday party! NOTE: Burnt sugar syrup should be cooled to room temperature before adding to egg yolk mixture.

This cake was exremely moist. The flavor was excellent very different. Next time I plan to use a carmel glaze to compliment it.

Very good and yummy. My kids loved it. A nice change from the usual chiffon cakes taste like custard or "leche flan". kinda too sweet but it's ok if you have very sweet tooth. I used 9x13x2 pan size for this.

The burnst sugar flavor is exquisite. It bakes up really high up to the rim of the tube pan. This can be topped with caramel sauce or something of the like if desired.

It is just way too eggy! All I smelled and tasted was egg and that's pretty gross! It had good texture and moistness but I just can't handle pure egg bread! I tried to put a strawberry topping to override the egg and just ended up w/ strawberry egg bread. Horrid!

cake tasted delicious and moist. I whipped up some heavy cream to soft peaks and folded in some left over Burnt Sugar Frosting that I'd made for a different recipe. First I heated the icing in the microwave let it cool slightly and folded it into the whipped cream. got big raves. the cake has so much taste a heavy frosting is just not needed.

it was okay... pleople seemed to like it but I didnt think it was anything special. certainly not worth the work. i used an entire set of mixing bowls a sauce pan and a tube pan... spent more time cleaning up than i thought necessary for a cake with so little flavor.
