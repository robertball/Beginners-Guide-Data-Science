I wasn't quite sure how to rate this, because I think it's an okay recipe, but I won't make it again as written.  The parmesan made kind of a weird mushy crust on top, and the basil was *really* prominent.  I will make this again with only a sprinkling of basil (or replace with oregano, or something else), and mix the parmesan into the egg before cooking.

I made this frittata for a healthy breakfast one morning using Johnsonville's Pork & Chicken Italian Sausage links. I used steamed fresh cauliflower and broccoli because to me fresh is best! It was delicious!

Quick simple dinner.  We used vegies we had on hand, broccoli, onion & spinach.  Served with a biscuit.  Can't wait to eat leftovers for breakfast.

This turned out great.   I made this for brunch and was very good.   I should maybe have plated with a tomato slice or so...it has quite a bit of flavor even though my pic looks plain.

Thank you for a wonderful recipe. I halved the sausage and used 1 tablespoon fresh chopped basil in place of the dried. We loved it! Economical, delicious, and quick to make!  Thanks Johnsonville!

I changed a few things for this recipe to be fantastic.  First, I used fresh cauliflower and broccoli and also added some seasoned kale as well.  I boiled the kale first in garlic and chicken broth with a dash of salt.  Secondly, I used ground sage sausage and browned the sausage before adding it.  I thought the basil was delicious and didn't change that at all.  I put shredded cheddar cheese in with the eggs, as well as added some on top with the parmesan.  I also used 8 eggs, mostly because I ended up with more extras than the recipe called for.  This was easy to make and a great "breakfast for dinner" recipe.

It wasn't over the top, but it was okay.  I think my broccoli overpowered the dish.  I might make a different vegetable selection (spinach?) next time.

I used 1/2 package of mild Italian sausage and found the proportion was just fine for us.  I served this for brunch, with a toasted English muffin and cherry preserves.  A hash brown patty completed this yummy meal.

We really like egg meals because they are quick and easy and kid friendly.  I think that next time I'll crumble up the sausage instead and use more red bell pepper (kids favorite).

I did this with different vegetables just because it was all I had.  I used mushrooms, spinach and onions and spicey ground beef (Black pepper, cumin and cayanne pepper) instead of Italian sausage.  Yummy!

Above average in taste and appearance,  AND the old adage, "You eat first with your eyes." is absolutely the truth.
Quick and wonderful.

This is a pretty good little recipe.  I made it as written.  I prefer a little more spice and flavor, but it was filling and delicious.

This was flavorful, and very easy to cook!  I subbed broccoli, onions & green bellpeppers because that's what I had on hand, and even my super picky kids enjoyed it.  My sausage was still half-frozen when I sliced it, so I cooked that first in the pan, then added the veggies to cook in the oil.  I think I probably should have drained the oil first (I think I read the recipe too fast and didn't see where it said to cook the sausage first then add the cooked sausage to the pan).  It was definitely delicious, but I will do that next time to reduce the fat and make it look nicer since the oil rose to the top when I poured the eggs in.  Thank goodness it wasn't for company, but overall, a good, fast recipe and one easily adjustable to accommodate whatever veggies you have available.

Fantastic! First frittata ever! I used fresh carrots, fresh onion, chicken sausage and fresh spinach with fresh cilantro, basil, and parsley. Ran out of parm so I added some shredded sharp cheddar. Still turned out fantastic. I think you could use any veggi & herb combo ;) Served it with a fried corn tortilla (my kids and hubby made it into a taco) and a side of sliced tomatos. Dinner success! Thank you, thank you I will be using this again with what ever I happen to have in the fridge.

I was not a fan, but Mr. LTH like it, so 4 stars it is (I'm not a fan of sausage).  Time got away from me, so I used steamable veggies (nuked for just 3 min) and pre browned ground sausage and tossed everything with beaten eggs in a pie pan and left them in the frig overnight for breakfast.  The next morning, I baked for about 40 minutes at 350.  The sausage and basil were overwhelming to me (fresh basil would be better), but I did like getting veggies at breakfast.  THANKS for the recipe!

This was easy and had good flavor. An excellent recipe when you need dinner in a hurry. I used mild all natural ground sausage instead of the links and was happy with choice.

Loved it, will make again...made w/ fresh broccoli and onions w/ chicken sausage and habanero cheese.  I loved it but a little too spicy for the toddler.  Husband loved it but gave him indigestion in the middle of the night.

I made this for dinner tonight and it came out so nice and delicious! I did change a few things. I don't like cauliflower so I used carrots, broccoli, and fresh mushrooms. I also did about a tablespoon of fresh basil and didn't add the parmesan cheese till about the last 2 minutes of cooking. Loved this and will be making this again for sure!

This recipe is so versatile!  Life conspired against me today and I was first contemplating dinner at 9 pm.  I used potatoes, red pepper and sweet onions.  As I was beating the eggs, I received a phone call and had to leave the house, so instead of cooking on the stove, I layered the ingredients and poured the eggs over all and baked at 350F for about 30 minutes.  It still tasted great and will be repeated at brunch often.  Thanks, Johnsonville!

This was pretty good for a quick,easy weeknight meal. I don't think I will make it again. There are too many other frittatas to try.
