Good recipe Marty! Thanks for sharing.Some months back I tried my first Allrecipes Beer Chops recipe. Since then my knowledge for cooking, drinking etc...with beer has greatly changed. here are some facts to ponder on beer before cooking this recipe yourself. Is your favorite brand of beer a lager, ale or malt? You can not just run to the local store and grab the cheapest thing you find. You don't have to buy the most expensive either. The only thing you must do is adjust your flavors accordingly. The way you store your beer can have an effect not only on the drinking quality of beer, but cooking with it as well. A bottled beer tastes much different than a can beer. Storing a bottled beer on it's side can cause the yeast to oxidate with the cap. Always store your beer upright. Be careful when buying can beer. Always know the brand of beer is just fine to your palate and liking before cooking with it. Also, the less expensive beer will naturally have a higher salt taste than a more expensive beer. When using a less expensive beer adjust the measure of salt down for the recipe. I hope this review helps anyone who is willing to explore cooking with beer for this recipe and others. Best Dishes and Enjoy!!

This is kind of a sloppy joe for grown ups.  I didn't think it was bad, but it does need some spicing up, because it really doesn't have much flavor.  I used season salt rather than regular salt, but that didn't seem to help any.  All I could taste was the pepper and my 13 month old would have nothing to do with it.  If I make again I will add some onion and garlic to the hamburger when I brown it.  
Also, the cook time was much longer than stated.  It took almost an hour on low for all the moisture to cook out of mine.  I ended up removing the lid and turning the heat up to medium.

Tried this last night and, like most of the other reviews here, found the cooking time had to be extended. I'm pretty impatient sometime when cooking; I ended up, after 14 minutes or so of simmering on "low," raising the heat to just above medium, and it took about another half hour.

Outside of that, made the recipe exactly the way it's published here. It's the first dish I've made in a while where the spouse specifically asked: "Is there more of this?" while still eating.

After putting meat on rolls (potato hamburger rolls), I topped with some "medium-diced" white onions and smattered a small amount of mayo/Miracle Whip on rolls.

We both really liked this sandwich. I can't tell you how the other two residents of our home liked the recipe... since there was none left to scrape into their dishes (And, boy, did they look unhappy about that)!

I grew up in a little town in Ohio where there is a sandwich shop that's been there since the 40's that serves Maid Rites which are loose meat sandwiches.  They won't give out the recipe but rumor has it that they are steamed in beer and a little sugar and mustard.  I haven't been able to duplicate them but this isn't too bad.

Excellent! I loved the flavor! It reminded me of Maid-Rites, (to my suprise!), I just wasn't sure how the beer would flavor the meat. Thanks so much for the great recipe!

I reduced the amount of salt, added some onion and garlic to the meat while browning.  Got too impatient (like another reviewer) and ended up turning the heat up.  Got hubby's favorite beer and it turned out very well.  He definately likes anything with that ingredient.  Thanks for the post.

This is a very good version of a loosemeat sandwich. This recipe has now replaced my own loosemeat recipe. The beer makes the difference and it is very good. Be patient - it takes a while for the liquid to evaporate - if you like more seasoning - just add salt and pepper to taste. Don't forget to serve with diced onions and sliced pickles. We also like to serve on toasted hamburger buns. Thanks for a very nice recipe!

An ok recipe. Needs a lot of seasoning, as others have suggested, to give it flavor.

You have to be patient, but the wait is worth it. These sandwiches are awsome and the beer is a perfect addition. It is a great way of getting rid of that bottle or can of beer that is approaching it's expiration date.

I thought this was great.  I added garlic and onion powder and served on toasted buns with a cheese sauce.  Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe idea.  :)

Halved the beer,doubled the sugar,omitted the salt. Hubby has a relative that owned a maid-rite store in Iowa for years. This recipe is good,but not quite maid-rite. lol

I've made this twice with mixed reviews. I cut down on the beer, as it takes forever to steam off. Kids want to know why the meat falls off the bun and my dh sez that hamburgers would be easier to handle. Taste was okay. I did notice that many people who rated it higher added spices...hmmm

Love this recipe! It does take quite awhile for the beer to simmer off, but it's worth the wait and your house will smell great. :) I add onion and garlic while browning meat, and I throw in some cubed Velveeta (any cheese would be great) at the very end. The cheese makes it that much yummier.

Try this.  Use the same recipe but instead of browning ground beef,  Mix all ingredients together and cook in a double boiler or a heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring so the beef don't brown and all liquid has evaporated.  The flavors lock together and the meat will be alot more moist. This will make more of the maid-rite texture

Excellent and easy!  I let it simmer in the beer for a little longer, as the mix was a little soupy, but it was worth the wait.  I'd love to try it with different beers to see how the flavor is affected.

This is definately a unique recipe. I have never had a loosemeat sandwich before but it was OK. I will try making this again but maybe add more spices to it for more flavor. Thanks for sharing.

This was very good recipe, though I did heed the ideas of the before reviews.  I added one whole small onion, diced with the burger when I cooked it; one-half a tsp of Old Bay seasoning; and only one-half a tsp of salt, but I think I would have left this out because of the Old Bay seasoning it was a little to salty.
Thanks for sharing Marty.

I THOUGHT THIS WAS PRETTY TASTY. I ONLY ADDED HALF THE AMOUNT OF BEER THAT THE RECIPE CALLED FOR. PLUS I ADDED A TBSP OF CATSUP AND SOME RED PEPPER FLAKES TO GIVE IT A LITTLE KICK.

I just cooked this and ate the burger(s) and it was fantastic!
Couple of notes though (things I added): 
I added a roma tomato, chopped
a tad bit of minced garlic
a small white onion

These gave it a lot more flavor and really helped complete the burger!

Really good and easy.  My kids loved it.  They said it tasted like "McDonald's hamburger meat."  I substituted season salt in place of regular salt.

I am giving this a 5 because its is so simple - I would suggest seasoning the meat some when it is browning in addition to the recipe - I will do so much more with it next time (and there will be a next time) - My husband approved it - We added chopped onions when served

I love it and so does my family! I am from the Quad Cities and they are known for their Maid Rite sandwiches. It is almost impossible to duplicate because there is a secret ingredient. This recipe replaces all of my other attempts at mastering the local favorite. I wouldn't make any changes. Yummy!

I made these for my daughters birthday party over the weekend.  I followed the recipe except I put them in the crock-pot & changed the recipe to serve 16.  I think they could have used more sugar & had to much pepper.  I used to live in a town in Ohio that has a Maid-Rite & this recipe is close.  I will probaly make them again for another family get together.

I thought it was really good; reminds me of the MaidRite sandwiches.  I added more of all the seasonings.  The beer was really good, and I'm sure my husband will not appreciate me raiding his fridge!

Great recipe!  I used the other advice and added more spices to the meat while cooking.

The beer made the meat have a very good flavor.  Although, I did become impatient and turn up the heat as it was taking forever.

I thought this was a great twist on the hamburger and the sloppy joe and have always wanted to try one since "Roseanne" he he. When making them again though I would make a bit of a change. For one, I would try making with half the amount of beer called for and for two, I would use a more basic beer (I used a pale ale too gourmet for this recipe beer). It definitely had a beer taste and I like beer but felt it could be cut back a wee bit. I, too added some minced onion and garlic while the meat was cooking. It does definitely take longer than stated for all the liquid to cook out. Good starter recipe though and easily adaptable to suit each family's tastes.

Very good, and so simple to make. I added dried red onions, and crushed red pepper flakes along with the beer.  Simmered for a little over 1 hour. Thanks...

This is good!  Upon reading the other reviews I made the folowing adjustments.  I added chopped onion to the mixture at the same time as adding the beer, etc.  I also used a tablespoon of heinz tabasco flavored ketchup and a dash of cayenne pepper for some tang.  It turned out to be very tasty.

I wish I could rate this higher, but my family just didn't like it. Neither my husband or son would eat it after a few bites, and threw theirs out. I hate to say it, but I ended up agreeing with them. Definitely salty tasting, so I would cut that back considerably. The flavor may have been improved by adding some of the ingredients mentioned in other reviews. I wouldn't make this again.

This recipe is a winner at my house! It *does* take longer for the beer to cook off than is indicated in the recipe. I timed it at about 45 minutes. Also, I add garlic powder, red pepper flakes, and canned portabello mushrooms to the mix. And, I slather the bread with mayonnaise (low fat), which goes really well with the meat mixture. I serve it with either a salad or peas with white sauce.

A couple reviewers have mentioned the Maid-rites from a small town in Ohio, near where I grew up - Greenville. My husband is from the Quad Cities so we had a Maid-rite-off. He had to agree the Ohio 'rites were superior. This recipe was as close as we have come to the Greenville Maid-rite. Next time I will halve the salt, double the pepper & mustard & start with a TBS of sugar. Season to taste from there. I used Bud Light tonight because it was that or an IPA, but I'd be curious to try Budweiser or Heineken next time.

We have made this several times over the years and LOVE it! If anyone has had a Maid Right sandwhich it is pretty close to it. Sometimes i have to adjust the salt/pepper depending on how the meat turns out..other than that i leave it and everyone LOVES it. Great for football gatherings

This is a great start. Because of personal addiction, I added onion and garlic. Used grill seasoning instead of salt and pepper and honey in place of sugar. Add cheddar cheese, and this is comfort food that will make you wanna smack yo' mama!

Excellent and a nice change from traditional sloppy joe sandwiches. Made according to recipe except for adding about a teaspoon of ketchup and about a tablespoon of dried minced onion. Will make again soon!

I always wanted to know what would make Roseanne open up a loosemeat sandwich shop on her show..now I know. This was good! I loved the way the beer made my house smell. I didn't have ground beef, so I used a pound of ground turkey instead. It took about 30 minutes on medium for the liquid to cook down. I put it on hamburger buns with mayo like someone suggested, wish I had the pickles though, bet that would have been good. It is kind of salty, so next time I will cut it by half. Thanks for a nice easy recipe that my kids, 3 and 6, even ate!!!

I doubled the recipe to take to a potluck.  I also added onion and a little minced garlic to the meat while browning.  It was a bit too salty, next time I will cut back on the salt.  I also added one teaspoon of ketchup.

I really liked this recipe even though I don't normally care for beer.  It has a unique flavor.  The cooking time did take longer than stated, so be prepared for that.
