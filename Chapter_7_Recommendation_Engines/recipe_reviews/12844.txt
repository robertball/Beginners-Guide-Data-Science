This is a wonderful recipe.  I've used it for baking Halibut, Ling Cod, Yellow Eye, Tilapia, and I'd guess it would work for just about any other fish you'd want to try.  I've reduced the amount of cayenne pepper as my husband can't handle really spicy food.  Otherwise, I love it!!!

Great recipe!!  And so pretty...  I may use stewed tomatoes the next time as the plain baked tomatoes were a little bitter.

I love seafood but I'm a little timid about making it.  This recipe was foolproof, and delicious.  I love spicy food so I added some hot sauce to the fish before I baked it.  Awesome!

Great tasting dish. I did change a few things to accommodate time and available ingredients. I seasoned the fish with garlic powder and rosemary, quickly sauteed it in a little butter, dumped in a little soy sauce and a can of drained canned tomatoes and let simmer until the fish was flaky. The sauce was great on rice. It looked pretty and tasted "fancy". Family all enjoyed it, even the pickiest eater. Thanks for an easy to adapt recipe with great flavor.

I don't eat fish myself, so I made this for my husband and his father, they LOVED it! I used a little less than a half teaspoon cayenne, because my father in law doesnt like this too spicy.
Instead of fresh tomatoes, i used canned Italian Stewed Tomatoes. Hubby was leery of using soy sauce on Cod, so I subbed Worcestershire Sauce instead(he said it gave it a more "New England" flair than the soy would have).
EXCELLENT!

My husband and i are always up for new cooking ideas and i hate to say it but neither of us enjoyed this dish, and a half a cup of butter is way too much for anyone trying to eat healthy. Soy and Cod do not mix well. 
Better off staying with lemon pepper.

I agree that this is quick and easy.  I also thought it was tasty, but I also agree that next time I would cut back on the butter.  Thanks for sharing.

Really great recipe!!! Simple, quick and pretty to serve. A hit at our house. I've played around with the marinade/steak sauce thing. I've used soy, dry rub, and a great recipe for steak marinade from this site. This recipe is so good because you almost can't mess it up!! (And for anyone watching calories, most of the butter stays in the pan - it's just a beautiful cooking method to keep the fish moist and yummy.)

This was definitely spicy--even using scant teaspoons of the peppers.  We don't use salt, so omitted that, but it was a good twist on boring old fish!

Very good! Definitely cut back on the butter. I doubled the recipe into a 13x9 glass baking dish.I had a red bell pepper that needed to be used, cut it into strips and used one lemon and one lime. Everybody loved. Next time I am going to cut back on the baking time.

I used olive oil instead of butter when making this. It was simple, tasty, and foolproof. I'll definitely make it again. I used about half of the cayenne and it was still a little too spicy for us.

I was a bit perplexed when you asked for a soy-based steak marinade. I wasn't sure what that was. I used a recipe on here called Greatest Steak Marinade. Since that recipe used Franks Red Hot, I left out the cayenne. I also didn't see the need for salt since we are using a soy based marinade. I subbed just a bit of olive oil in the bottom of the pan for all of that butter. It was good!

So delicious! I used red snapper and had to change it up a little because I didn't have exact ingredients on hand. I subbed steak sauce with part worcestershire and part soy sauce. I also added a half onion sliced on top with tomato. I forgot the lemon and it still turned out amazing! Thanks to freeda for such a  great recipe!

Loved it! Easy and tasty. I did cut down on the butter, I used about 1/3 cup, and since I didn't have any tomatoes I used mushrooms and onions.

I used Lawry's Signature Steakhouse Marinade, half the butter, and just over half the cayenne (ground, not flakes). This was really wonderful! Would have been too spicy as written, for us, and my husband loves spicy food. Used fresh garden tomatoes, just sprinking salt and pepper over them (not the suggested amounts, just to taste), and they are a great addition to the meal. My husband says it would be a great dish to make for company. First time he's ever said that!

I only cook Jan. and Feb. otherwise outside.  This was fun to make and I was proud when I opened the oven door.  I will back off on the cayenne a little next time.  I will make it again but make more for a serving; the whole pound.  Just do it.

It's sort of unfair for me to rate this recipe, since I didn't have the exact ingredients.  I had thawed the fish (cod) and needed to go ahead and use it, so I had to substitute.  Not having fresh tomatoes, I used canned and didn't think to drain them, so I ended up with wayyyy too much liquid (but the liquid had a great flavor and I saved it to use in another dish).  I also found that my steak marinade was actually teriyaki, but I used it anyway.  However, it did come out well and hubby said, "Yes, we could have that again."  I prefer my fish grilled or broiled, but I had seconds of this, so Id say it was pretty good.

I enjoyed this, and my husband LOVED it. It was a nice easy way to do fish.  I took the suggestions of other reviewers and left out the lemon pepper, which I think was a wise choice. Will use this one again.

We made this for lunch today and it was instant hit with myself, 2 teens and spouse.

I used the Best Steak Marinade in Existence recipe found here on allrecipes.com, changed it to 2 serving quanitity.

I also used fresh organic tomatoes, which came out very sweet tasting in this dish.

I did cut back the butter as suggested by others, and used a little more than a quarter cup.

Overall, we found this to be great tasting, very quick and easy to fix, and a new favorite for our family.

This was pretty good but do think I will sprinkle just a couple pinches of brown sugar on the tomatoes if I make this again to take away any bitterness from the tomatoes.

I used tilapia and I thought it was pretty good.  I think next time I will add 1/4 cup of honey, I think the sweetness of the honey with the cayenne would definitely compliment the sauce.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!  : )

This tasted pretty good, but it not my favorite way to prepare fish. I didn't have cod, but used tilpapia, instead of fresh tomtoes used canned diced tomoes with garlic and used a lot less butter. I thought the soy, butter and tomato combo was a little odd. Just not my favorite. I migt try this again with a differnt marinade.

Very good. I used a combination of A1 and Worstershire instead of the soy based sauce. I think I’d use more lemon next time and less butter

I added only 2 Tablespoons of butter, and about a half cup of water (I just couldn't  see adding all that butter), and I didn't add salt...there's enough natural salt in the lemon and tomatoes.  I also added only 1 teaspoon of chili  cayenne pepper.  We like things spicy, but I thought that extra half teaspoon would have overpowered the fish.  Otherwise, this was very tasty and easy.

This is a great recipe!!!! I've never been one for cod filets but I'm giving it another try to change things up. This recipe gives the perfect amount of spice. I didn't have steak marinade so I used 1/4 cup reduced sodium soy sauce and as a sub for lemon, I lightly sprinkled lemon garlic seasoning on top. The only thing I would suggest changing is the amount of salt. I think next time, I'll cut it in half.

Made this for dinner, had to cut the recipe in half since there was only 2 of us.  Also left out the cayenne pepper. Initially was a little confused about the soy based steak marinade but used recipe I have for london broil and it worked out well.  Made it with cod and will try with other fish. This was easy and delicious. Definitely a keeper.

Was very good but I think too buttery for my taste.

Not only  did I like it so does my family did too. It was quick and easy.  I did it kind of makes a little bit of changes as I'm putting a little bit more lemon and a little bit more Italian dressing but other than that I think that it was an amazing recipe and I will be making it again very soon   !

Wasn't a fan of the steak marinade/lemon combo but I tried again and just eliminated the steak marinade and tossed in a few capers and it was delicious.  Thanks for a good basic recipe that's easy to doctor to your own liking!

Cod was on sale but I didn't know how to prepare it (other than fried). This was very good. I decreased the cayenne to our taste and spooned drained diced tomatoes on top. Will serve this again.

Delicious.  Admittingly, I had a hard time visualizing the combination of a "soy based" marinade and lemon.  Instead, I used 50/50 A1 and worcestershire. It was wonderful.  In retrospect, I have had many wonderful terriyaki (soy based) fish dishes, often with pineapple (citrus) so I will give it a shot with the lemon next time.  I did prefer the added flavor from the stewed tomatoes to the plain.  It's worth saying that since the recipe doesn't require a specific sauce and if you do alter it with stewed tomatoes - you may want to consider reducing or eliminating the addition of salt.

Used A-1 as the sauce and sprinkled Pikes place Market sea food seasoning on the fish. Killer. If you can't get this seasoning use garlic powder and dill.

Love this recipe. My husband, who doesn't really care for fish, likes it too. We use coconut oil instead of butter. It's healthier and gives a great flavor.

This is awesome!  My husband wants to make it 5 nights a week! The calories are much lower than the nutrition stated due to most of the sauce is left in the pan!  I used only 1/4 cup of butter and mixed 1/8 cup soy sauce w/ 1/8 cup water & half a pack of the seasoning for steak marinade- either Mckormick or grill mates- not sure, (the kind you normally add vinegar & water to).  I used lemon juice instead of fresh lemon.  I also used the cayenne pepper.  Best fish we have ever had, thanks!

Loved it.  I made a few changes.  I used Bragg's Liquid Amino Acids, instead of a steak marinade.  I also used half the butter.  It came out great.  I put extra tomatoes in the pan and they came out great.
