These were fun to make with the kids.  We decorated the cupcakes to look like "baskets" using licorice sticks for handles, green coconut for grass, and mini peanut butter eggs!

I tried this recipe because I wanted to make cupcakes for my fiance's family and my own...but my mom wanted carrot cake and I thought the design was really cute. Instead of making regular vanilla cupcake I got a recipe for carrot cake so I just made carrot cake cupcakes and made some cream cheese glaze & dyed coconut shavings green & got sweet tart jelly beans and fruity twizzlers. They came out so cuuute and so yummy!! Everyone loved them!

These were really good.  I used mini-marshmallows to make bunnies decorations.  Really fun for Easter.

I'm not the greatest fan of cupcakes, but these were delectable! I used Lilliput eggs that I had left in the freezer for several days, but I'm sure they would have stayed whole even if I hadn't frozen them. However, when I bit into a cupcake after I had let them cool, the egg was still quite cool, which I found refreshing.  I ate them without icing, but my friends prefered them with icing.  By the way, DO NOT tell your friends that there is a chocolate egg in the cupcake before they find it. They WILL be angry with you. :P

for me, the cupcakes were really good.  not all the ingrediants dissolved well, so the batter was a little lumpy.  When it was baked, the lumps helped add nice texture to the cupcake, it was like cornbread.

for me, the batter only made 15 cupcakes, instead of 24.

These are fantastic! I've made probably close to 40 of these in the past 24 hours. They're gobbled up by everyone who comes over. (I use that sour cream frosting recipe with it, and it's delicious together!) Even when I ran out of butter, I replaced it with oil and it still tastes fabulous. This is definitely staying in my list.

A nice one.  Could make plain vanilla cupcakes too.  Iced with vanilla on some and plain on others; topped iced ones with easter colored sprinkles.  A pretty good hit, considering the party we were going to already had too much food!

My brown sugar was loosely packed.

Kids liked these but the egg went to the bottom and stuck to the cupcake paper. The cake part is good when it's same day but doesn't take very good after that.

A fun recipe! I had to make it without muffin cups (because I forgot to buy them, silly me) and I found the chocolate eggs sank RIGHT to the bottom. My advice would be to put a bit more batter at the bottom of the cup than you think you need - that way the egg can sink to the middle! All in all though - delicious! I made mine with colored sprinkles funfettying the top! :-)

I have been looking for this cupcake for a long time and I ound it! 

I loved the consistency of the dough and the cupcake turned out a little "cake" like, but that was actually really awesome, as I like denser cupcakes. 

My chocolate eggs did not melt through, they were awesome also; i used the cadburry mini eggs. However, if you make these without the eggs, they will still turn out fine.

I found that 20 minutes at 350 was not enough. I had to turn it up to 375 and bake for almost 30 minutes. however, it might just be my oven or my flour even. Definitely check them after 20 minutes. 

I made the sour cream icicng and tinted it four different pastel easter colour - YUM!

Overall this cupcake was delicious!!!

thank you so much for posting this recipe!

These are by far the best home made cupcakes I have made in a long while!  Usually they come out too dense or heavy, these turned out more cake-like, but still light, moist and delicious!  I also used half the amount of sugar than it called for, used real unsalted butter, and omitted the choco eggs and it still came out wonderful!

This was not good. For some reason, the ingredients were not appealing to me, mixed together as they were. Also, the brown sugar would not melt, and stayed in chunks. Therefore, some cupcakes got an overload of brown sugar, while others did not. Also, the cupcakes were bad by the next day. I would not make these again.

Not what I expected, very good though. A little cakey, I don't know if I did something wrong or thats how they turned out. My eggs always dropped to the bottom and stuck to the paper.
I also topped with the Sour Cream Frosting. A plus!

I was so disappointed. The cupcake it's self was good but the "eggs" fell right out the bottom or was stuck right in the bottom kind of defeating the "surprise".

I made these cupcakes with my children, lots of fun, thought they would be sweeter with all the sugar.  It made 16 not 24 for me. I found the ones with chocolate inside did not rise and the chocolate did go to the bottom. I enjoyed them very much but my children were not the biggest fans. I guess not sweet enough for them.

The cupcakes were easy to make, but I did not favor how they tasted that much. Put the chocolate eggs in on their sides instead of straight up and down (seems obvious, but might not be) that might help with the chocolate not melting to the bottom. Also, freeze or refridgerate the eggs before using them so they get hard and do not start to melt when you start to handle them. Great idea!

This is a pretty good cupcake.  My eggs sank to the bottom and to be honest, I don't think you need them.  But then there'd be no surprise!  I frosted mine and put jelly beans on top and they were quite delightful.

Chocolate did drop to the bottom of the cupcake and I think it's because the cake recipe isn't very dense. This might work better with a different cake recipe. Another "surprise" you can add to the center of the cupcake is a scoop of cookie dough. It comes out pretty good.

You can use 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar for a lighter taste.  I frosted these with butter cream grass and had chocolate eggs with a Peeps sitting on the nest.  Happy Easter everyone!

Really good, but unfortunately the eggs sunk to the bottom of the egg. Tasted good but I was sad about the egg.

The batter had a great vanilla taste however these cupcakes cooked up very heavy and dry.  I did not have any problems with the chocolates as I used mini Cadbury eggs and they have a thick covering on them.  The girls loved the surprise inside.  Just not a great texture - I like a light and fluffy cupcake.

Wow! These are very tasty and quick treats that your family is  sure to enjoy!!!! When I first saw them, I knew I had to save this to my recipe box. Later today, I tried it out for the first time, and everyone wanted seconds!!!My only precaution is that you will most likely NOT turn out with 24, but end up with 23.So, if you are expecting EXACTLY 24 people to come by and eat your treats, don't count on it all the way...But other than that single flaw, it's a delectable treat for everyone with an appetite for sweets!!!:)

wow this recipe was amazing. The cake was so good, and better than anything out of a box. I didn't add the egg in the middle but i for sure didn't miss it. I don't have a flour sifter but, I mixed this all by hand and it was great. thanks

I made these for my son's 9th birthday party and the kids were RAVING about them.  One boy even said they were the best cupcakes he had ever had!  Personally, I thought they tasted "cakey" but were ok none the less.  Great recipe for kids!!

This recipe is THE best. I made them for my family, and they LOVE them. Trust me, if you make this recipe you WON'T be sorry. And if I were you, I'd make more than 24 cupcakes. They go FAST.

Recipe was easy to follow with basic ingredients you typically have on hand. I substituted the Regular Twizzlers for the colorful ones which didn't work out as they were too soft and kept tipping over. I suggest leaving the Twizzlers out of the bag separated for a while so they harden as they'll stay bent and maintain the shape without collapsing. The finished product is super cute and your kids can help you decorate them.

This is a great recipe.  I was worried about the egg melting. So I unwrapped them a popped them in the fridge for 1/2 hour before putting them in the cakes. Didn't have any problems with melting.  The only problem I had was not eating them all before I decorated them!

Pretty easy to make, but at first we thought it was a chocolate mix since you can see a tiny bit of chocolate cupcake in the photo, but then we looked at the ingredients and saw there was no coco.

It was not pleasant we tried to make them but they sank.
DONT make them it is a waste of time ,money and possibly a better dessert. I am serious like I am sorry but this was really bad. They grew perfectly and then the popped and sank. BEWARE: don’t make!
Sorry to the creator. No offense but NEW RECIPE please.

For those having problems with the egg sinking, add them last and poke them down into the batter until just the top is showing.  The batter will rise up and cover them. I'm sorry, but I did not care for the taste of the cupcake.  It tasted like a big, overly sweet sugar cookie. I used the converter to halve this recipe and it only made ten cupcakes (no biggy, but just a warning for those needing an exact amount).  I also found that I needed the full 20 minutes and then some, checking constantly. I like the idea, but will try again with another cake flavor that I love. On the plus side, these were very moist and came out of the silicone liners with no problems.
