I added a tsp of dijon mustard to this recipe and it turned out great! I'm not sure if I would have liked it as much without the mustard, b/c it may have been a little too bland.  But the mustard gave it a good kick that went well with the smoothness of the sour cream and mayo.  I'll definitely make this again!

This is a simple, sumptious recipe. I made it with a very minor alteration:
Sprinkle "Old Bay Seasoning" and some fresh parsley.  ( I used Italian parsley, but any type could be used, I'm sure.   This goes really well served with the spinach and rice casserole also found on Allrecipes.

This recipe is fantastic and so easy!  I sprinkled the fish with Cajun seasoning to add a little kick.  My husband and I both loved the flavor and texture. I served it with sauteed brussel sprouts and potatoes.

I thought this was excellent with salmon!  I had one salmon fillet and one cod fillet, both about 8 oz, and so put both in the recipe.  My husband and I both preferred the salmon (which was farm raised) to the cod (which was wild caught).  In addition, as many suggested, I added some dijon mustard.  I also made about 1/3 less sauce than called for - which for us was more than enough.  This is an easy and tasty recipe that uses standard ingredients that most have on hand.

This is the type of "end-of-the-month" dish.  You're broke, yet you have all these ingredients in the refigerator! Hehe...
I've added a teaspoon of mustard to the sause, grated gouda cheese on top and put some breadcrumbs on top of that.
It was devine!  The household loved it, and I've made it twice since!

This was OK and certainly easy to make.  I might let it marinate a little before baking it next time.  It didn't really soak up as much flavor as I would've liked.

Good. But my wife does not think it is great. I found it tasty. semi-sweet. 
I used MircalWhip instead of mao.. 
I thought it was above average: simple to prepare/cook. It smelled good. May use it again with company!???

This was such an easy recipe that tasted like you spent hours perfecting the sauce.  I added fresh rosemary before serving and another time I added capers.  I have also made it using yogurt in place of the sour cream.

I'm not sure I can imagine this recipe good with the original ingredients only. It was really not impressive even after adding some flavor. I decided not to use Dijon, as I use Dijon with most fish recipes and wanted something a little different. So I sprinkled some Old Bay on the cod, covered with the sauce (which had less than half the lemon as most suggested), then added some salt and peppered diced tomatoes on top for more flavor and at least a little color. Very bland. Had to sprinkle more Old Bay on just to get through it. Would recommend possibly trying with Dijon, but would probably avoid and go another route.

Not everyone will like this because it has a very distinct flavor to it.  Be cautious trying to feed it to finicky eaters.

I think this has potential but redoing it to be more palatable would make it an entirely different recipe.  As others have mentioned this was kind of a "bottom of the fridge" meal for me prior to my holiday menu shopping.  My first red flag was "mayonnaise" which is about equal in my book to "open a can of cream of mushroom soup."  In terms of something to add on the fly that might make this palatable it was a toos up between dill and ground red pepper.  I chose the pepper and it gave it a bite which was the only thing that made it edible.  I think the dijon also might work and I might try it again with that change just to see.    Butter AND mayo?  That much fat overpowers the fish.  Also this sauce makes the cod fillets (a hearty, flaky, firm fish) quite soggy and miserable.  Sorry.  I do see the potential (without mayo and with something that tastes like something) but this is a full thumbs down for me.  About as white bread middle of the country as it is possible to get.  Without cream of mushroom soup that is.

I loved this dish, but like the other reviewers recommended, I doctored it up a little.  I added mustard (yellow not dijon - it's all I had) and put in about a Tbsp of Creole seasoning and then sprinkled fried onions on top.  Delicious!  I'll be making this again and again!

We made some simple changes and additions and it was wonderful!  We didn't mix butter into sauce...decreased lemon juic to 1/8 cup and then the real makeover came.  We added dill weed and garlic salt to sauce, plus some salt & pepper.  After we spread the sauce we added a can of well drained spinach, a layer of panko bread crumbs and parm. cheese.  Served with mashed potatoes with gorgonzola cheese.  DELICIOUS!!!

This was a fabulous meal. My husband and I enjoyed it.  It goes great with seasoned potatoes! I will make this twice a month if not more. I will try it on fish tacos and fish patties!!! If you love fish you will love this. I plan on sharing this recipes with friends and family. Thank you

I made this tonight and it just was not what I expected.  It might have been my fault b/c I had to use bottled lemon juice and used Miracle Whip instead of mayo.  The taste left something to be desired and 30 minutes left my fish so tough it was hard to eat.  I did add dill and some cayenne as suggested by other reviewers but this dish just didn't taste good.

very good, however for my personal taste I will cut down on the lemon juice next time.  Also the dijon mustard sounds good for the next try.

The taste of this fish is very strong and unlike what I expect fish to taste like. I won't be using this recipe again. Maybe if you love mayonaise and lemon, you might like this.

Added mushrooms and slivered almonds to sauce.  Very good, but a bit bland.  Next time will add the dijon as suggested by previous reviewers.  Might want to try the sauce on bonless, skinless chicken breasts.

My husband made this dish and only added some Dijon mustard and it was fabulous. We may cut the lemon a bit. However, cod never tasted so good. We will definitely make it again.

I added salt & pepper prior to putting the sauce on the fish.  I also let the sauce sit on the fish for about 10 mins before baking.  Turned out really well, will definitely make again!

Excellent with the addition of dijon mustard and sprinkled with a little Old Bay Seasoning, as suggested by several of the other reviewers.  Moist, tender, and flavorful!  An easy and elegant dish!

Super easy.  Nice tangy sauce.  I used cod sprinkled with creole seasoning.  Served over pasta.

We enjoyed this easy recipe, although made a few changes at the suggestion of other reviewers.  I added 1 tsp. Dijon mustard and garlic powder to the sauce, forgot the lemon juice :(  My fillets were frozen, and therefore probably thinner than fresh, so the fish cooked in about 20 min.  I sprinkled a little Parmesan over for the last few minutes and ran the pan under the broiler to give it a tinge of color.  I sprinkled my own portion liberally with Cajun seasoning, which gave it a nice color and great flavor!  Served with sauteed mushrooms and Brussels sprouts - yum.
Update: made again adding mustard (accidentally more than recommended - maybe 2 T) made with mustard which included balsamic mustard with Mediterranean spices such as oregano. This made all the differences! My fish-hating daughter cleaned up the pan and asked for it again tomorrow. Wow!!

I followed a lot of reviewers tips and added 1 tsp of brown mustard to the mayo and seasoned the fish with Old Bay.  It was delicious.  My kids ate it all up!

This was a very easy to make delicious meal.  I seasoned the fish with salt and pepper before I poured the sauce on top.  I will definitely make this dish again.

It turned out flat-out disgusting. Interestingly, it looked great, but the flavor was just off. The sauce is very heavy and overpowers everything. The hint of sour from the lemon is just off. Not for me.

The combination of mayo and sour cream with lemon is also known as mock hollandaise sauce. I've used this same sauce with Eggs Benedict. I added 1 teaspoon of dry mustard and a sprinkle of mrs. dash along with fresh dill sprigs on top. It was very tasty and a nice change from pan fried. I used fresh caught northern pike. Mmmmm

very easy recipe. I also added a tablespoon of mustard and some chili powder. I think it might have been a little bland without it. otherwise very good!

I made this for lunch today for the second time today. Delish as is, but this time I added a few dashes of powdered mustard, 1 large grated garlic clove, and a dash of salt. Mmm-mmm good!

I found a great way to improve this recipe. I rubbed my fish on both sides with the seasoning called "Dianne's Fish Seasoning" also on this website. Then I put a healthy spoonful of this sauce on top (I used no butter and much less lemon). Baked until flaky and it was fabulous! Had a lovely herbal flavor with just the right amount of zip from the sauce.

Per other reviews, sprinkled fish with cajun seasoning before covering in sauce.  In future, might prefer lemon/pepper, cracked pepper, or dill.  Added thyme, a little sweet/hot mustard, some leftover tarter sauce and a little basil and garlic to sauce.  Sauce made enough for 3 large fillets.  Very, very good.

Not one of my favorite recipes, I would trim the sauce by at least half and add a 1 to 1 1/2 tsp of dijon mustard.

This did nothing for my family.  The lemon flavor was too strong and the rest was too bland.  I did like some of the suggestions given by other reviewers and will try incorporating some of those -- makes this a totally different recipe though!

This was very tasty. Reminded me of a similar sauce my mother uses with orange roughy. I too felt it seemed a little bland so I used less mayo, more sour cream & added a few teaspoons each of crushed black pepper & dill weed. Outstanding!

Have made a recipe similar to this; sprayed the pan with cooking spray, mixed equal amounts of light mayo and sour cream, and topped with finely chopped tomatoes.  Seasoned fish and tomatoes with salt and pepper.  Delicious!!

I halved the recipe and added 2 tbs of Dijon mustard. DH loved this recipe. I thought it to be a little too bland for my taste.
