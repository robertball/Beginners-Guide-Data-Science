Darvulya, Plum pudding, or christmas pudding as we brits call it is made from Suet and is steamed. This recipe IS the British Bread pudding that we all grew up on, smells and tastes fantastic. I also used left over cake (i carve and make Birthday cakes) If you are looking for that great stodgy heart warming dish you grew up on, bake this, sprinkle some sugar on top, grab a cuppa and enjoy. Thanks for taking the time to list this for us all to enjoy!!!

This is the real bread pudding that my pommy mum makes - all the other connotations that i noticed in my mind are bread and butter puddings 
Dad used to call this the good stodge and was what I grew up on with alot of siblings and was a great desert to use up stale bread (which didnt happen often lol) 
Excellent - I leave out the peal though cant stand it.

A TRUE British bread pudding recipe, thank you.  Every bit as good as my mother and grandmother made. I left out the mixed fruit because I don't like it and just added extra sultanas.

This isn't bread pudding.  It's plum pudding.  If you were looking for bread pudding, this isn't it.

This is a great recipe.  I did reduce the 1 tablespoon nutmeg to 1/2 tablespoon.  I couldn't find mixed fruit, so used golden raisins and currants.  I've already made it twice in 2 days - it disappears so quickly.

this is a very versatile recipe, because I changed a lot of things (used leftover bagels for one, and added yogurt) and it still turned out very well.  I would recommend it!

This was a really great base.  I made 1/4 plain, 1/4 with raisins, and 1/2 with frozen cranberries.  My favorite was with raisins.  It would be great with apples and an increased amount of cinnamon.  I only used 1/2 teaspoon of Nutmeg and it was almost too potent, I can't imagine what it would be like if the recommended 1T was used.  I also added an extra egg.  

Compared to all the other recipes, this looked like the quickest recipe.  My friend loved it.  So great recipe in great time.  Thanks for sharing!

This is the classic recipe for British bread pudding. You can use different kinds of bread or fruit as you have available. Great hot with custard and even better cold. It is meant to be quite dense and heavy and not at all like cake. Also, it is not bread and butter pudding which has similar ingredients.
NOTE FOR DARVULYA: This not at all like plum pudding which is VERY dark and rich, contains suet, and is steamed, like Christmas pudding. 
I have been using this recipe for years (long before allrecipes came along and it is great.

I don't know why people are saying this isn't bread pudding!  I come from a big ol' London cockney family and this has been the only bread pudding I have ever known from my grandmother/mother and also seen in bakeries throughout the area I grew up in.  Plum pudding is what we called Christmas pudding and nothing like bread pudding.

Great British recipe that is so easy, plus a good way to use up left over bread. I always freeze all my bread crusts until I have enough to make this recipe. Only changes I made was to add more cranberries, a slurp of vanilla paste and a dash of Maple Syrup. We were brought up on this in UK in the 50’s & 60’s and I would take slabs to school to swap for shop bought cake!  This recipe is very similar to the one my Mum made, except she soaked the bread in water & squeezed it out, then added the milk later. Will be sharing this tomorrow with some Scottish friends coming to visit.  Thanks for your  recipe Anne.

Just like my Welsh grandmother made when I was growing up.  Left out peel too but next time I will only use sultanas and currents.  No raisins.  Loved it.

I have been learning how to make whole wheat bread, and I have had several failures.  I hate to waste so I make this recipe out of my loaves that just are not right.  This is a great recipe to use!  Love it!

I was trying to replicate my long-gone grandmother's recipe but this recipe came out too cake-like - texture wasn't the same as I remember. Her Welsh recipe of bread pudding was much more dense and wet. Was able to find and make another recipe from a relative and it was much better.

Thank you for helping me to find a recipe for the bread pudding my husband's Irish mom made for him. He was thrilled! This is different to the bread pudding most of us know but is good. It is almost better the next day.

I reduced cinnamon and nutmeg to 1 tsp and used fresh frozen rhubarb instead of the raisins ad dried fruit, add more or less milk to get a well soaked bread but not over soggy.

Really enjoyed this recipe & it was so simple to make. Used special French bread (several days old) and left over raisin bread (both from the famous Paris bakery Poilâne) which gave it a firmer texture than sandwich bread. Didn't have raisins, but the raisin bread was heavy with them! Also reduced the nutmeg to a tsp. -  really enjoyed the good taste of bread pudding that I remember from British school days!

We made this for a class project (traditional food from England) and loved it!!  I added a tsp. of vanilla to the recipe and let the bread soak a little longer in the milk and it was good! I used skim milk as that was what we had but next time I plan to use whole milk.  We will definitely make this again!

This was an excellent use of leftover wheat bread I had made.  I estimated the dried fruit I added, just adding a handful of this and that, which was probably a little more than the recipe requested but it worked out great for us.  Because I’m not a fan of nutmeg, I only added a slight grating which was fine because of the amount of cinnamon in the recipe.

Exactly what I was looking for, real British bread pudding. I used leftover bread crusts, added a can of drained diced pineapple and soaked the bread for 15 minutes because the bread I was using was so dry. Great way to use stale bread ends and fill up my three growing boys, just like my mum did when my siblings and I were kids!
