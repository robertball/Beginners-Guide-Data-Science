It could be bland, but I gave this recipe more kick by adding sauteed mushrooms, scallions and red onion to the mix with crushed garlic. I also replaced the cup of mozzerella cheese with a cup of jack and half a cup of parmesean. I took out the bread crumbs for a real low carb recipe!

I'm having a hard time reviewing this recipe because I didn't make as-is.  I think as-is would be very bland.  But this has to be one of the most awesome base recipes ever.  With any add-ins you could change this to Bbq, Thai, Mexican, Indian - whatever you feel that night!  I threw in literally most of our leftovers and it came out great!!  About a 1/4 cup diced each: leftover chicken, mushrooms, onion, cilantro, bleu cheese, and green pepper.  It was fan-tastic, and was all gone by the end of the evening!  I will go to this recipe over and over again to refresh my leftovers!!!

Delicious and Delightful, the bread crumbs  make a perfect light crust (I used italian style) and the squash makes for a nice texture and firmness to the quiche.

Wonderful recipe! I added some carmelized onions with mushrooms and bacon and it was great! I didn't tell the kid what was in the quiche and they all ate it for lunch licking their fingers! Don't forget to add some salt and pepper.

I changed a couple of things with this recipe, and it came out very well.  I used a shredded Italian cheese blend instead of plain mozzarella, used whole eggs rather than mostly egg whites, and 2% evaporated milk instead of skim.  I also added a little seasoning salt, white pepper and nutmeg.  It smelled terrific and had a nice, creamy comfort food kind of flavor.  My boyfriend and I both really enjoyed it. I'll definitely make it again!

Decided to use the whole squash, so I doubled the recipe, except kept it a just 3 whole eggs, and 1 can (12 oz.) plus just a splash more reg. (skim) milk, as the mixture seemed kind of runny.  For extra flavor, I added onion and garlic powder, Mrs. Dash, some parmesan cheese and a bit of nutmeg.  Two deeelish. quiches!  Will make again, possibly in just one casserole dish...

I think this recipe made an excellent base to really be creative with! I used shredded zucchini instead of spaghetti squash because I did not have any and it turned out great! I also used fresh instead of frozen spinach threw in a little onion, some fresh tomatoes, portabella mushrooms, oregano, marjoram and topped each serving with a fresh basil and oregano leaf. I really liked the bread crumb idea...it made for a nice texture. I didn't have evaporated skim milk so I used one can of regular evaporated milk and 12 oz of 2% milk (I doubled the original recipe), however that made it quite moist and I think next time I will reduce the amount of liquid a bit.

This tasted like nothing. That's what my husband said anyway. It's very nutritious, but it was really bland. I even added quite a bit of salt.

This is a wonderful dish. I did make a few tweaks & I recommend using this recipe as a base. I used 2 beaten eggs, 2 egg whites, fresh spinach (about 1/2 a bag) and added saut√©ed mushrooms, shallots & minced garlic. I also added Italian Mrs Dash for extra flavor. I used a jumbo muffin tin for individual servings - perfect for on the go or brunch. I still baked it for 45 minutes and added parmesan cheese the last 5 minutes. I think next time I'll add some crumbled bacon. Recipe made enough for 6 individual quiches.

This is a great recipe.  I was skeptical about the crust, but it turned out awesome.  What a great healthy alternative!  I added cayenne, paprika, and mustard powder for some extra flavor.  I didn't have skim evaporated milk, so I used one cup of skim milk and 1/2 cup cottage cheese instead.  I also didn't have any spinache, so I used 1 cup of spaghetti squash.  What a tasty way to make a dent in the big pile of spaghetti squash I've got to deal with :)

Modifications I made: Sauteed the 1 small onion and garlic in olive oil. Sauteed the greens with some soy sauce and balsamic vinegar, then combined  mushrooms and the spaghetti squash with the greens and onions to quickly saut√© all together. 
Used skim milk because I did not have any evaporated milk on hand. My family loves regular crust but said the bread crumb crust was a nice alternative. My husband like the squash part because it cave the quiche a real "meaty/chewy substance" quality to the texture.

I have to say, I had my doubts how this would taste, but it‚Äôs fantastic! I cooked up 5 slices of bacon and chopped them up, and saut√©ed 1/2 an onion (chopped) and a large clove of garlic (minced). I added half a frozen package of chopped spinach (cooked), 2.5 cups of cooked spaghetti squash, 3 whole eggs, 12 oz. of evaporated milk, 3/4 cup shredded cheddar, onion power and garlic powder, and used a thin layer of breadcrumbs on the bottom. The squash keeps the quiche very moist and it‚Äôs yummy!

This was AWESOME!  I love anything with Spinach and this year, my dad grew Spaghetti Squash and didn't know what to do with them.  I spotted this recipe last Thursday 10/15/2010 and tried it on Friday 10/16/2010.  I made a revision and added some finely chopped onions and when I baked off my Spahghetti Squash, I added some garlic powder to it.  Yummy!!!!

Did not care for this recipe.  Not only is it bland as written, the texture of it is not pleasing. The spaghetti squash is too stringy (hence it's name...).  It just didn't compliment with the spinach and cheese we think.

This is ok. I used the whole 10 oz package of spinach and the whole squash. I used panko bread crumbs and real mozz cheese, but not nearly as much as is called for. This could use some hot sauce and/or red pepper flakes. We'll eat on this for breakfast this week. It is a different and interesting combo, but we'll be dashing on some hot sauce!

Relatively easy to put together, tasty and filling. Used almond meal in place of breadcrumbs, which worked beautifully and gave it a lovely hint of sweet & nutty flavor. May try a variation with saut√©ed onions and mushrooms, and even some bacon. Will definitely make this again!

This recipe was a good base for a wonderful dish, especially with the addition of: approx. 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp onion powder, 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes, 1 tsp. oregano, 1 tsp. basil, 1/2 tsp. ancho chile pepper, and 1 tsp. parsley. I also added 1/2 cup flour, ommitting the bread crumbs, so the quiche formed its own crust. Those measurements are for a double recipe. Delicious aroma and very flavorful.

Creative recipe that was fun to build on! Like other reviewers said, I think it would have been very very bland made this way, but it was great to add stuff into. I made it with 5/8 cup egg substitute and regular 1% milk because I'd run out of eggs and evaporated milk, and it still turned out fine. For mix-ins, I added leftover chicken, red pepper, onion, garlic, basil, salt, and pepper.

Good after adding spices, but a little watery.

Delicious! Needed more salt mixed in. I also added more garlic than the recipe called for.

I really changed this recipe but I think the idea of using spaghetti squash is unique and tasty. I used all squash for the vegetable, a frozen deep dish pie crust, 1/2 mozzarella/1/2 cheddar, some crumbled bacon, tsp. corn starch, refrigerated fat free half and half and 1/2 tsp. salt to fight blandness. Looked good and cut easily. Next time will use more bacon.

So, I couldn't give it a full 5 stars because I did alter the recipe a bit. I agree with others that the quiche would have been very bland if I had not made the following changes.  First of all, season the mixture with salt and pepper at least. I also added a bit of garlic powder.  Secondly, it did not take 45 min to cook. It was more along the lines of 25-30. I ended up added in a full cup of spaghetti squash which stretched out the batter, leaving me with a total of 18 muffins. Additionally, I added chopped mushrooms to my mix as well and sprinkled only a few strands of cheddar cheese and green onions on the top for an extra bite of flavor.  I think this recipe is worth a high rating because of the many ways that you could customize it.   It was delish, after adding salt and pepper of course.

This turned out much better than expected.  It had great presentation, and made a great light vegetarian meal by itself.  I didn't change a thing on the recipe.  The bread crumbs back up to look like you made a special crust for it, when really you just put a layer of bread crumbs on the bottom.

This is my first experience with spaghetti squash.  Maybe mine was extra watery--the breadcrumbs didn't make a crust on the bottom.  If I make this again, I'll probably squeeze out the squash like the spinach.  And even though it's an egg dish, I would probably double both the spinach and squash.  Also would have loved to know temp and time for making the individual quiches like the picture--they're so cute!

I made this for a brunch with friends. I made a few changes based on the ingredients I already had at home. I used kale instead of spinach, cooking it in the microwave for a few minutes.  I used colby jack cheese, added a green onion, and about a quarter teaspoon of nutmeg, maybe 1/2 teaspoon.  I didn't measure the nutmeg, unfortunately.  The flavor was good, I got some compliments, and nearly all of it was consumed.  Even better was the next day, when I warmed it up for dinner!

The squash noodles shriveled up to a thread like consistency and gave it an unplesant chewey stringiness. Other than that, it tasted good. I modified the heck out of it, though. Added saut√©ed onions and garlic, salt, pepper, nutmeg. Exchanged for full eggs, mixed Mexican shredded cheese, and half Greek yogurt and half cream cheese instead of milk. My husband said it needed ham, bacon or turkey to complement the flavor of the spinach... I'll make it again, but next time either no spaghetti squash, or I'll pur√©e it first.

This will become a staple for me! I loved the flavor (although if you're looking for a dish with lots of kick, this isn't it), and the quiche reheats well. Appropriate for any meal or a snack. Delicious and versatile!

this was a great recipe. I added black olives, garlic & onion powder, and substituted an extra egg for the can of condensed milk, (which I was out of) and cooked it in a muffin tin. it made a great side for sage pork chops.

I was low on mozzarella, so added some Swiss cheese which gave it a little kick.  Artichoke hearts would be a good addition, too.  I used skim milk and some extra cheese for thickness.

What a wonderful recipe with a few additions, like garlic, onion, mushroom,& bacon. I seasoned with salt, pepper, oregano, and basil. I made half my egg muffins with out the bread crumbs because 1 of my guest can't have gluten and they were very good too.

Made this for the first time.  Added mushrooms and green onions. Also added some salt, pepper, garlic, based on the comments of blandness.  The beauty of this is you can add what you like to change it up. My family loved it.  They are not easy to please so I am stunned and thrilled.  I will be making this again.

I wasn't impressed one bit with this recipe. There was absolutely no flavor, and what's the point in eating if you can't taste anything. I followed other's advice and added cayenne and garlic, but still....nothing! My guess is, use real eggs and a nice thick crust and this might be a keeper!

This was too bland for me.  With some dashes of Chipolte Tabasco it was better.  Too much milk and too little eggs also for my liking.  Loved the idea with the spaghetti squash though.
