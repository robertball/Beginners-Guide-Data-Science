We really liked this the only change I made was just added a second can of artichokes to it to use up what I had and because we really like artichokes.  Super quick and easy and usually have all of these ingredients on hand.

I just made this and immediately ate half of it with Triscuits. I don't care for mayonnaise, so I substituted 1/2 tub (4 oz.) of cream cheese spread. The only thing that kept it from getting a perfect score was that it was a little salty, but that could be blamed on the Triscuits. Great recipe!

This dish....O my gosh! I dream about this all the time. I serve it with a baguette that I slice thinly and toast it in the oven. Then everyone takes a slice and scoops up the dip. Once you have one bite, you can't stop. It's so addictive. Great for any party, holiday, or heck, anytime is a great time for this wonderful dip. I'm taking it for a Thanksgiving appetizer next. (Everyone is asking for it.)

I chose this recipe mainly because of how simple it is and how few ingredients it has. However, I did make a few changes. Because I used two cans of artichoke hearts, I added 1/2 TBSP lemon juice, 2 additional TBSPs light mayo, and 1/4 extra parm cheese. After I tried it, I realized that I didn't even need to add the extra mayo- it was still very creamy. During the last five minutes of cook time I broiled the dish on high to get a browned top. I served this with Carr's Cheese Melts crackers, which were PERFECT with this recipe.

Made this for a party last minute and it was the first thing everyone ate. So many people wanted the recipe, I felt almost guilty that it so easy. I make it for all my parties now.

You can't go wrong with this recipe.  Change as many things as you want and you can't screw it up!  Everyone will always love it!  I chop my artichokes (non marinated kind) in my food processor first and actually 'eye-ball' my ingredients until it looks like the right consistency before I throw it in the oven.

Great dip to have on hand. I added more garlic, and also included a lump of cream cheese to make it a little smoother.

I make this all the time for friends, I've made it with pimentos and veganaise and everyone always loves. I've also served it with jalapeno bread from panera, which sounds like a random mix but so good

Wow!  This is really good & easy.  I used 2/3 cup real mayo and doubled the amount of artichoke.  It came out perfect.

This dip was great and so easy. I took some cues from other reviews and doubled the amount of artichokes.  I'm also not  big fan of mayo so I used 3/4 cup light mayo plus 1/4 Greek yogurt.  I also used a mix of fresh Parmesan cheese with Kraft-style Parm.  It was a big hit and several people asked for the recipe.  It is definitely going in my keeper file.

i agree that it needs more garlic and i am not a huge garlic fan. i tried it with greek yogurt because i despise mayo and it was only...so so...didn't have the creamy consistency i have seen when served this at parties...will go back to the mayo because i think that perfection should be left alone

Had guests comming over in thirty mins. Had this fantastic dip in and out of the oven to be served by the time they walked into the house. My guests were scraping the sides of the dish and asking for the recipes when it was finished.

My sister brought this dip for Christmas to eat while we opened presents & I ate so much of this, I hardly had room for dinner!! It's amazingly good! I probably would have never tried it had I known about the mayo so don't be scared to attempt this because it's wonderful and easy too!

It was OK. Very salty, even though I used plain artichoke hearts. It wasn't creamy enough for me.

This is so wonderfully yummy and so easy I make it at any opportunity I get! I've added some spinach also if I'm in the mood but not necessary. And for the record, I'm not a mayo fan at all, but I LOVE THIS! I don't taste the mayo at all but it makes the consistency great!

I thought this was great! Several people commented on how good it was.  It was a little salty- I served it with sliced french bread that I lightly toasted so as not to add more salt that would be on the crackers.  I also used 2 jars of artichokes because 1 definately wasn't enough.

I got this exact recipe off the back of a Hellman's jar years ago.  But whenever I make it the dip is oily and separates.
