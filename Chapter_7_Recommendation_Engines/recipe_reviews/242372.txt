I normally do NOT make changes to a recipe without first making it as is. That being said, I was cooking for my parents, and my father needs to watch his salt intake. I saw 1 Tablespoon, and immediately knew I had to scale it back. I think I used 1 1/4 tsp MAX. I prefer my tastes to come from other herbs/spices anyways. 
I also didn't cook this on a conventional grill.  I cooked the ribs using a Holland Grill, which uses an indirect method of cooking- resulting in ribs that were OH SO MOIST, and not dried out (think "rib jerky").  I must've overlooked where it said to let the ribs rest an hour before cooking...we were hungry! So I slathered the ribs up with the seasoning, and onto the grill they went. Within less than 2 hours, they were cooked to perfection!  My dad was thankful, and I received many compliments about how fresh, moist and tasty the ribs were. I also heard the comment "you wouldn't find ribs THIS GOOD in any restaurant!"   Smithfield/Farmland you guys were the star of the show!!!

I did not make any changes with the exception of not using the Apple juice. I did cook it  for four hours on the grill with the meat side down and never turning at all. Wrapped in aluminum foil halfway through and let it sit for about 20 minutes after it was done.
Holy Cow! When people would say the the meat would fall off the bones they weren't kidding! It was delicious,  tender,  flavorful, satisfying! 
Yes, I will make it again and again!

This recipe is very close to my own. I, however, love a sweet, thick honey glaze on my ribs, applied the last 10-15 minutes, back on the grill, using indirect heat. Either way, you can't lose with this recipe...

We loved this rub. I did cut the salt back to two teaspoons,  added a tsp. cayenne pepper, and 1/2 tsp. of black pepper to the rub mix since my hubby likes it spicy. If I make these again, I would add more heat.  I smoked it in the smoker with hickory and apple wood.

These were awesome! I followed the recipe almost (lol) I did take others advice and only used two teaspoons of salt. I added black pepper and cayenne to the recipe. Used smoker and did not use indirect heat. Cooked for six hours, used aluminum foil the last two hours. Smithfield St. Louis ribs were very meaty and cost was a very good value! Will definitely use Smithfield Pork Ribs again!

My family loved the flavor of this rub.  I used an alternate preparation however. I placed the ribs in my electric pressure cooker and added enough water to cover and added the spice rub along with a teaspoon of liquid smoke to the water and ribs. Set the pressure cooker for 20 minutes and when it was done I put the ribs on the grill.  I glazed some of the rib portions with sauce and left some plain.  All of them came off the grill flavorful, tender and juicy.  You just grill them long enough to get some grill marks.  This method of cooking took maybe an hour.  Can't wait to try this on pork tenderloin.

This was yummy but just a bit too salty for our taste. I did these on indirect heat on my gas grill with perfect results. Next time I will cut the salt by half....and there will be a next time :)

I made a few changes , first I added hot chili flakes, second I increased paprika but also made it smoked paprika. Otherwise this rub is great on ribs and pork chops.

Awesome rub, I am saving it for future use. Followed the ingredients to a "T" but did the 3-2-1 method for rib smoking.  They were fantastic.  The rub paired well with "Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory Brown Sugar" sauce, not too spicy.  We rounded out the meal with BBQ beans, mashed potatoes, broccoli and cheese, and cornbread muffins.

First of all, we thought the ribs were the greatest because they are so very meaty!  Yum!  Then we thought the rub was excellent.  I used the 3-2-1 method of cooking these on my barbecue, and they were just like we love them---fall-off-the-bone tender!  At the very end I did apply a little of Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory and Brown Sugar sauce.  One full rack supplied us with two dinners plus tastes for extended family members.  I would like to add just a very small bit of cayenne to the rub next time.  Thank you, Smithfield!

Made this twice and loved it.  So did my guests.  Left out the sugar, apple juice and cut way down on the salt.

Made these and another rib recipe at the same time and hubby preferred this recipe. We didn't use this cooking method but was able to use our smoker for the first time on ribs. We smoked for two hours at 225 degrees then wrapped in foil and cooked an additional 2-1/2 - 3 hours in the smoker. The were tender but not quite fall-off-the-bone tender. LilSnoo suggested the 3-2-1 method, which I will definitely put to use next time we smoke ribs.
