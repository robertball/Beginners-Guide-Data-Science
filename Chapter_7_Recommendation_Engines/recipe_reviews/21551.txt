I just made this for breakfast & we devoured it ...my husband had refused to eat it for supper the other day (he threatened to go out to eat if I made it!) so I snuck into the kitchen before he woke up & started this UNBELIEVABLY FAST, easy & so delicious quiche!!! Thank you so much for submitting this, it's absolutely easy & my early teen daughter will be whipping this up for us often!!!
*NOTE* glass pie pans take 5-8 minutes longer so don't open the oven door until you've made the adjustment!  Otherwise your's will fall, as mine did --but its going to still be great!

I have made this quiche many times.  My recipe calls for a 1/2 cup of complete pancake mix instead of flour.  Quick and very good!

I loved this easy recipe.  I added a few things to it as I always do.  I chopped (in a food processor) some fresh broccoli and an onion.  I sauted them in a pan with a SMALL amount of the bacon grease, just till onions were soft.  I used less bacon and cooked on Forman grill so grease dripped off bacon.  I added chopped ham and a bit of parmesean.  I also used mozerella.  I used whole wheat flour but you could not tell in the final product.  I did have to cook it longer but did not have to broil.  Crispy skin was already on the top.  Easiest quiche I have ever made.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was great to whip up at the last minute using items I had on hand. Delicious, and impressive because it seemed much harder to make than it really was. For more servings, I increased the ingredients by half, used a 9X13 baking dish, and cooked for an extra ten minutes or so.

Holy wow. I may have to go back and change all my other ratings down a level to make room for the comparative awesomeness of this recipe. I don't want anyone to get too excited, but this may be my favorite recipe EVER.  I love quiche the way most people love Christmas. However, quiche is unfortunately loaded with fat and calories and all sorts of bad stuff, meaning it's way off my diet. :-/  NOW I CAN EAT QUICHE EVERY DAY, because this recipe, while preserving the general awesomeness of quiche, cuts out the cream AND the butter-filled crust, leaving only diet-worthy deliciousness. I made only two changes; I cut out the two tablespoons of butter, and I like my quiche a little "thick" so I changed one-half cup of milk to plain unsweetened yogurt (I put the yogurt in one cup of milk and mixed well before adding to the flour). This made the texture a little "richer" without adding calories or fat.  I really, really love you for this recipe. Really.

This is the first recipe from this site that I had very low expections, and I was wrong!!  This was wonderful!

My changes:  Omitted bacon, added broccoli and mushrooms, sprinkled paprika on top to add to the 'browned' look, which it did beautifully.  I love this recipe!

This was pretty good, although next time I will not add the butter...I don't think that it needed the extra fat, as there is already enough in the cheese. I also substituted turkey sausage for the bacon because my husband is muslim and doesn't eat pork. It was really good though and I will make again, adding more veggies next time and maybe trying Cheddar cheese.

It's a keeper! I used some of the reviews and cooked the onions about 2 min before adding to egg mixture. Blender is the way to mix this one. Also baked in my cast iron skillet 35 min it turned out beautiful. No need to broil.

GOOD, EASY RECIPE. Quick clean up. Since I just lost a lot of weight recently I did change a few things. (as I'm watching what I eat) I changed the bacon to turkey bacon, used 1cup of egg beaters, used skim milk and added sauteed fresh spinach. Left the cheese the same. Even with the reduced calorie version it was delicious. If it was prior to my weight loss I probably would not change a thing. Thanks for the recipe.

I have made this many times.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it was a hit.  Since then I have made it mostly based on what I have.  I have cut the salt to 1/2 tsp and I add 1/4-1/2 tsp black pepper.  I have used sharp cheddar, pepper-Jack, colby and Mexican blend cheeses. I have made this with sausage and with no meat. At different times I have added bell pepper, jalpeno, cubed leftover baked potatoes, mushrooms, cauliflower, broccoli, peas, chopped drained zucchini. This recipe allows for a lot of variations, so you can't be disappointed.

This is a time saving keeper!  I used 6 eggs as opposed to 4 and used light cheddar.  I will try this again with extra veggies such as spinach, peppers or asparagus. Just a tip to really grease the pan...sticks like glue!

Note for those new to making quiche: Try not to add any more than 3 ingredients. I learned that by adding more than that, your quiche tends to look and taste more like a pizza! 5 stars for prividing me the perfect ratio of flour and milk. The quiche rose in the oven perfectly in my 9" stoneware pie pan and browned beautifully. Like others, I used what was on-hand: didn't have Swiss & used Monterey Jack, I also sauted chopped onion because I had fresh mushrooms and sauted them with the onion which helped by using the cook's required amount of melted butter. Delicious and easy!

I had just under 3/4 cup of evaporated milk to use up, I used it in this recipe adding enough regular milk to equal 1 1/2 cups. I went easy on the salt and I did add fresh ground pepper and a little Frank's Hot Sauce. I kept to the same idea of the recipe, only I made little handheld quiches out of them. I wisked together the eggs, flour and milk with the fresh ground pepper and the hot sauce. I then crumbled the bacon and equally divided the bacon and onion into 6 well-greased muffin tins. I poured the egg mixture into each greased muffin tin, then sprinkled a little cheese over each little egg......mixture. My little quiches were done at 20 minutes. My kids and I thought these were great. NO LEFTOVERS. Between the three of us, we ate them all.

This was very good.  I made it for brunch today.  I had planned on making quiche, but didn't have a ready-made frozen crust, and I didn't have time to make one from scratch.  The adjustments I made were cooking the onion in the butter, left out the salt, and I added 1/4 cup of cheddar cheese.  I also cooked some sausage, about 1/2 cup, and made the quiche half sausage and half bacon so we would have a choice.  Quick, easy! I will definitely make this again!

This tasted okay. I thought it was kind of salty and a little oniony. I liked the fact that it didn't have a crust which cut back the saturated fat and calories in a normal quiche. But, I think I would have to work with it to get the right combination of ingredients and definitely cut back on the salt as there is enough in the cheese and meat. Made a good breakfast change either way.

This was very tasty and very easy to make.  Would definitely make it again and try different ingredients.  The only problem I had was the cooking time.  I had to cook it about 50 minutes and my oven temperatue is fairly accurate.

This recipe is the greatest.  I love quiche, but from now on I will actually *make* it, too.  =)  Besides the fact that it to some extent makes its own crust, I love the fact that substitutions/variations/fudging works so well.  I used a 10" ceramic pie pan (and therefore upped the amounts), cut the amount of bacon, added chicken and broccoli and substituted mozzarella for the Swiss, and it was great.  I served it with a strawberry-spinach salad (sliced strawberries, sliced almonds, crumbled feta cheese, baby spinach and vinagrette dressing) and Riesling.  We loved it.

***Edit: Didn't have bacon and tried cut-up pepperoni...REALLY good.  For some reason pepperoni makes it creamier.

This is one of the better recipes I have tried. Whatever ingredients you decide to use, I think the key is broiling it for 5 minutes after it is done cooking. It gives it a great brown crisp topping.

I liked this so much that I threw all my other quiche recipes away.  Great for a low-carb diet and I preferred it over quiche with a crust.  I used only 6 slices of bacon, shredded colby & monterey jack (from Costco), broccoli, sauteed mushrooms & sweet onions and some fresh basil leaves.  I made it the night before and served it for a brunch the next day.  Everyone loved it!

This recipe is a version of the old Impossible pies that Bisquick published in the early 80's. You can make them with Bisquick or make up your own mix with flour, baking powder, shortening, & milk. I've been making them for years as they're so easy to throw together when you're rushed for time.  If you do a google search for Impossible pie recipes, you'll find dozens of variations.  cheeseburger pie,  turkey & stuffing pie, chicken pie etc etc. Lots of impossible dessert pie recipes too!  If you READ the recipe and actually TRY the recipe, you'll find it forms its own crust!

This was a very good recipe. Easy and quick to put together and very tasty. I added half a cup of frozen spinach to mine and it was fantastic. I think next time I will add some tomatoes or some red bell pepper. This would also be really great with shrimp.

This is a great basic, quick crustless QUICHE recipe.  I made it this morning using baking mix, 5 large eggs, and one can of evap. milk.  DELICIOUS!  Hubby will take the leftovers into work this evening.  Bravo on an easy, quick Quiche recipe!

I used my pottery pie plate (a little smaller than standard).  Instead of shredded Swiss cheese, I used sliced smoked Muenster cheese from the deli and lined the pan with that.  I also sauted the onion a little before adding it to the mixture. I also added a pinch of nutmeg and about a tsp of mustard. I also used powder pancake mix instead of flour.  All in all, we gave it 5 stars and will be making it again!  Btw, the cheese slices lining the pie plate worked beautifully as a "crust"!

Very easy and quick. I make this for breakfast,lunch or dinner. I use the base of this with eggs/milk/flour/butter (process this in the blender) and then change the other ingredients often. Example: sausages,bacon, or crab, fresh diced tomatoes, green peppers, onion, red peppers, spinach, asparagus, etc.  There are so many ways to change it to your family's likings. Tonight it is for dinner with diced cooked sausage links, onion, peppers, fresh diced tomatoes and cheddar cheese. I topped it off with a little Parmesan cheese for a little crunch to enhance the tomatoes. I also use fresh herbs in this dish. It does make a little crust on its own with the flour. Serve some fresh fruit and muffins and it is a nice meal anytime.  It freezes quite well also. Cut individual pieces and heat in microwave for a quick breakfast.

And excellent idea! A vegetarian option: We don't eat meat, so I crumbled some Romy cheese (the Egyptian equivalent of Parmesean) in the food processor with some coarse breadcrumbs and a few drops of olive oil, and lightly packed into large, heavy ramekins (the same ones I use for souffles). Omitted Bacon from the recipe, but added 2 tsps garlic pwdr, a dash of Italian herbs, spinach and broccoli and sprinkled more cheese on top. FABULOUS! My husband ate two, and he is usually a staunch believer that eggs should only ever be fried, sunny side up! Quick, easy and  quick clean up. Merci!

My husband has prepared this dish several times for our family, and even with variations, it turns out great every time!  He's made it with different cheeses, sausage instead of bacon, all veggies and no meat; each time, everyone enjoys it!  The only real "change" he's made to the recipe is that he mixes and bakes everything in our cast-iron skillet, which results in a crispy, brown layer on the bottom.  Quick, easy, and yummy!

I made this quiche for a church breakfast, and it was a big hit!  The flour settles toward the bottom, and keeps the quiche firm, it wasn't runny at all.

Great easy Quiche recipe.  I made several batches of this with slightly different ingredients (salsa in some, veggies in some, some with different cheeses) for a dinner party and it was a big hit.  Instead of one large Quiche I made it in muffin pans.  Just be sure to grease the muffin pan or it will stick.  I even made extra that I froze so my husband has a quick breakfast option.  I will be making this again and again!!  Try this, you will not miss the crust.

thanx for a good basic recipe. I never knew exactly how much flour and milk to put for a quiche so tried this one and it was great! I omitted the bacon and butter. I sauteed the onions with a red pepper, brocoli, cauliflower and grape tomatoes and it was succulent! my husband asked for a second round and he's not a quiche eater! even my picky-eating boy had a second round! that's a keeper!

I did make some additions.  I added spinach, zuchini and red potato (cook potato in micro until softened just enough to cut in cubes).  I also used colby/monteray mix for cheese.

This was a huge hit in my family! Even my extremely picky, only eats peanut butter and jelly, 3 year old cleaned his plate! I sauteed some onions, red peppers, and broccoli, and added feta and cheddar cheese. I didn't have any meat but had some bacon pieces that I used. I reduced the milk to one cup omitted the butter and salt (I sauteed the veggies in butter) and put in a 9 inch glass pie dish. I cooked it for 50 minutes and it was perfect! Will definitely use this base recipe again!

This is our favorite quiche! I make it several times a month to use up our chicken eggs. I add veggies...whatever I have around including chopped mushrooms, bell peppers, and tomatoes. One other thing I do, I bake for 35 minutes and broil for 2 minutes at the very end to cook the top a bit more. I don't change anything else from the recipe just add the veggies and it turns out GREAT.

This quiche was great. I doubled the recipe for a 9/13, used mozzarella instead of swiss, added garlic, and one bag of frozen broccoli. Baked for about 50 mins, then sprinkled with feta and parmesan cheese, baked for another 5 mins. The whole family loved it!

I added slightly different fillings, but I followed everything else precisely, and I found it to be too loose for my preferences.  My husband and I thought it OK and we ate it, but my daughter didn't like it all and I found myself finding something different for her.

I just tried this because it was today’s “Daily Dish” email recipe and it sounded like a creative way to use the leftover taco meat I had on hand, so the timing was perfect.  I used the taco meat and Mexican cheese mix instead of the bacon and Swiss.  I was out of milk so used 3/4 c. sour cream as it complements the taco theme anyway.  The custard I’m sure was a little denser, but Wow!!  This was so delicious and easy – definitely going to add this as one of my “go to” recipes!  I’m sure I’ll try this with the bacon and Swiss (and milk) at some point, but with so many ingredient possibilities, it probably won’t matter, the basic recipe is a delicious starting point.

Excellent exactly as the recipe states!!!  But the third time I made it with fried mushrooms and onions, and it was very good too!
Just back to add that this has become one of my regular morning meals and although we like it best with bacon or ham added, I have made it several times with just the cheese and veggis... delicious and easy!!  Note: 4 oz. Shredded cheese is 1 cup and any kind of cheese works great!

No crust=no Quiche.
We prefer the traditional Quiche Lorraine.
This has no flavor and is oh so bland.
If you are lazy and will accept something other than a quiche you will like this I am sure.

Was a pretty good recipe, used Chedder cheese instead of Swiss and had my tiny 7 year old helped with the mixing he loved and felt like a little "Chef Ramsey" criticing his own food .. I was excited because not only did he actually eat but he asked for seconds. Great recipe for kids that don't like to eat to participate in making to get them to eat.

A+++ recipe.  I made three  for Mother's Day.  I cut up thick sliced turkey breast and used a different cheese in each one - Swiss, Monterey Jack and Cheddar.  They were all really good but the Monterey Jack was a stand out.  Like one other reviewer said, you really don't miss or even notice there's no crust.  This is going on the meal rotation.

I just took this out of the oven a little bit ago and it looks beautiful...smells yummy too! We are not eating meat on Fridays so I didn't add any to this batch. Instead of meat, I added homemade hash browns in which I sauteed the onions during the last few minutes to make them tender. Disposable aluminum pans were used and I had no sticking at all. I used this recipe as a base and tripled it to take to a school function (fit tripled batch into two 11-3/4 x 9-1/4 x 1-1/2 casserole pans). The flour/milk proportion was perfect. Broiling during the last couple of minutes is a must for a beautiful browned top. This is definitely a keeper! Next time, I will add some sort of pork...bacon, sausage or both...which will probably be tomorrow!

This sounds so simple, but it is divine!!  My husband and I were blown away.  It is like eating a breakfast casserole and bisquit at the same time.  I wish I would have listened to the reviewer who said to add 5-8 mins for a glass pie pan or it will deflate.  I used a prepared round corningware dish and it needed an extra 8 mins.  This makes an AWESOME breakfast.

Very good for such a quick fix.  I used marbled cheddar cheese since I didn't have any Swiss on hand and added about 1/3 c. sweet red peppers which really gave it something extra.  I only used 6 slices of bacon and wish I had used more - the more bacon the better the bottom will turn out taste wise, so don't hold back on it!  I baked it in a 9-inch glass pie pan and the sides rose quite a bit during baking, but evened back out once cooled and looked great.  I recommend a glass pan if you have one since it cooks more evenly and thoroughly.  I would make this again if looking for a quick delicious brunch dish, and will definitely try adding other ingredients to it as well!

This is absolutely delicious, I added more to the ingredients to allow for more servings, adding 3/4 cup flour, 2 cups milk, 6 eggs, 6 oz cheese, 1 1/2 tsp salt, etc. This is so flexible, you can use just about anything to taste, it turned out so fluffy and rich! I cooked mine in an 8x8 glass baking dish and it puffed up above the top. I did have to leave it in a little longer, I believe 10 minutes longer because I used a glass pan as another reviewer suggested. The incorporated crust makes it perfect. Husband absolutey LOVED it :) This is my new quiche of choice!

This was okay - is very versatile, you can use any meat or cheese you wish, but it's not particularly special.  It's something you can make at the spur of the moment w/items generally kept on hand.

Delicious and so easy!  This is something that you can throw together when you have few ingredients on hand, or change it to suit your tastes.  I used cut up gouda and shredded parmesan, and added broccoli, and it turned out great.  Next time it may be fun to play with flavors by adding ham, peppers, sausage, etc.  I didn't have milk so I used 1 c water, and it still turned out great.  Love this recipe!

This was surprisingly wonderful!  I omitted the butter as it wasn't needed.  I used chopped ham in place of the bacon and green onions in place of the onion.  I also used whatever cheese I had on hand.  I used 5 eggs and pancake mix instead of flour.  Also, only used 1 cup of milk.  I added broccoli and 2 chopped roma tomatoes.  Cooked 5 minutes longer because I used a glass pan.  This recipe is adaptable to whatever you have in your refrigerator.  I can't wait to make this again!

This was so good and so easy to make. I sauted the onion and then added diced ham, then I added about 1 teaspoon of dried mustard to the egg mixture. It came out perfectly!  Thank you Myrite! This is a great recipe! I will make this again and again!

Excellent base recipe!  I was surprised to find that the cheese had formed sort of a crust on the bottom (I was leery of a crustless quiche), and it cooked up fairly nicely.  I did have to throw the oven on to broil for an extra 5 minutes to get the middle to cook up a bit more, but that was likely due to my throwing in every green, red, and yellow vegetable within my reach.  I'll make this again... I may even serve it to my family.  (*gasp*)

Excellent recipe! I made this into individual "Mexican" quiches by adding around 1/4 c. diced green chiles, and changing the cheese to a cheddar blend; then I poured the egg mixture into 6 ramekins instead of a pie dish. Added a dollop of crema (Mexican sour cream) and some salsa fresca, and it was perfect!! Will use again & again!

5.27.13 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/21551/quick-quiche/ ... Well :D, Me, the one who really doesn't care for quiche REALLY LIKED this recipe.  I like the more custardy texture, light & ALMOST fluffy, creamy somewhat. E, the one who requests quiche, didn't.  :/  He likes the more dense type.  I may try the suggestion of another review by subbing yogurt for some of the milk.  Greek yogurt would, (well, may ;D) please that kid.  K didn't try.  S tried, but said nothing.  Sigh.  I never thought there'd be a quiche only I liked - & for speed, amazing!  Oh, one more thing: thanks to the reviewer who said to add 8 minutes to a glass pie plate.  Okay, two more things: I don't think the butter is all that needed, or at least 2T.  It spilled over - just the butter - around the pie plate.  Not enough to burn, but make it greasy on the bottom.  And, I used 8oz sharp cheddar w 2T parmesan on top, no bacon, no onion (a little powder) & added 1/4t dry mustard, then sprinkled w paprika when done.  I think this recipe is open to so many additions.  It's good as a base or by itself.  Yummy quiche uses 3c cheese & 5 eggs.  Too dense, toooo dense.  Quiche uses 1 1/2c cheese & 3eggs.  1 1/2 or 2c cheese I'll try w yogurt.  :)

Simple and delicious! I had to use cheddar cheese because I didn't have any Swiss, and used turkey bacon because I don't eat pork, but aside from that I stuck to the recipe. Amazingly easy.
Edit: Well, the first serving was perfect. All of the servings after it were very salty at the bottom. My roommate thinks that all of the salt sank to the bottom of the pan. I whipped it pretty well before pouring, so next time I'll just cut the salt in half.

I hate pie crust so i thought this would make a great alternative to the standard quiche, but not at all.  Next time i would rather skip the flour cut out some milk and leave the rest the same.  It was extremely bland, make sure to put in lots of pepper or maybe a louisiana seasoning to kick it up.

really easy and hubby loved it. I used green onion and no additional salt as the bacon and swiss cheese are salty enough. Put it all in the microwave with turntable and cooked for 10 min and let set in there, after cooking,  for 5 more to finish. Kept the kitchen cool and it still came out great! You could add cooked chopped broccoli or spinach as some have said and change the meat to whatever.

This was super easy and very tasty. I left out the butter, used whole wheat flour, sauted the onions and mushrooms in the bacon grease and added 1/2 box of thawed spinach.  I had colby jack and used that instead of swiss.  SO GOOD AND EASY!!!

As always, I read the least positive reviews for this recipe.  I decided to make the recipe pretty much as it is, but added some broccoli and mushrooms.  It came out great and my family loved it.  Not to mention it's much healthier than other recipes where are you use a buttery crust.  Some people out there must be a really poor cooks to not make this recipe good.

Love this recipe! Delicious, quick, and easy! Topped with additional cheese last two minutes of baking time and then garnished with additional bacon bits. Ham would be a great addition as well. This is the perfect recipe to make ahead of time; hours or even the day before. Reheat individual slices for a few seconds in the microwave. For me, it was even more flavorful the next day.  Served with fruit for a nice balance.

The heavier weight of the flour sinks to the bottom to form a bit of a crust, but it isn't as thick as making a separate crust would be.

Very good.  Had to make some substitutions based on what I had available. Instead of bacon, used about 2/3 cup of chopped ham (leftover from Easter). Omitted butter and salt, but lightly sauteed the diced onions in olive oil and blotted dry before putting in the quiche pan, so this added a bit of oil anyway and the parmesan made up for skipping the salt. Also used cheddar instead of Swiss and used less than recommended amount. Added sprinkle of parmesan on top of dry ingredients. Added about 1/2 cup of frozen broccoli, which I first cooked in the microwave, blotted dry and diced. I let it cook 10 minutes longer because at the recommended 35 minutes it was only partially risen and partially still flat. After 45 minutes it was entirely risen. The flour settled to the bottom and makes an almost-crust. The cheese rose a little bit towards the top. Even though there was no official crust, it still had a similar taste to a quiche with crust (a hint of a taste of dough) that I quite enjoy.  This was really good and easy. I've seen other quiche recipes calling for a dash of tarragon or a dash of nutmeg or a sprinkle of garlic powder so if you feel it's missing something, you could try one of those, but I was happy with it as is. I'll try this again with other varieties of veggies (spinach would be great) and cheeses and with or without other meats too like sausage or turkey.

Ignore all negative reviews; this is a great recipe. Very quick and easy and tastes delicious. I added 1/2 tsp. black pepper, 1/4 cup chives, and a dash of Louisiana hot sauce. The chives floated to the top, which made the quiche look more colorful and appetizing. I baked it 40 minutes and it was perfectly done. I will definitely make this again.

We really liked this.  Quick and easy.  This is a recipe that you can add or delete what you want.  I added onion, pepper and zuchini which I sauted a little with butter.  I also added an extra egg and decreased the milk by 1/2 a cup per other reviewers.  I will be making this again.

Never had/made quiche, so this was entirely new to me.  Recipe couldn't have been easier and the results- DELICIOUS!  My husband scarfed down his portion and asked for seconds.  I cooked these in muffin tins and used cheddar cheese instead of Swiss as well as onion powder instead of real onion.  Oh, and I used 1/2 tsp of salt and my husband pointed out how salty they tasted, so I'm going with 1/4 tsp salt from now on.  To make single serving sizes, I put about a tablespoon of bacon in the bottom of each muffin tin, sprinkled in some cheese and poured the egg mixture over both until they were covered (about 3/4 full).  Very surprised to see my quiches try to "puff" out of the tins, but equally surprised when they fell back down after being taken out of the oven.  I think they look very nice and are very, very tasty.  I've never made quiche with a crust, but now that I have this, I'm sticking with it.

My kids loved this!  I used cheddar and mozzarella cheese, and 1 tsp onion powder instead of chopped onion because the kids don't really like onion.

Awesome recipe! so easy and adaptable. I've used different cheeses, meat and veggies- the possibilites are endless. the one thing i recommend is to season the eggs a bit more with salt and pepper and to be sure to sautee any veggies and onions until soft before baking. YUMMO!

Very easy.  I added sauteed spinach and onions and used cheddar cheese.  I wouldn't say it served 6.  4 of us ate the whole thing.  Quick to make and delicious.  Will make again.

Thank you so much for this recipe. My family loves it! I followed the advice of some reviewers and cut out the butter completely. I also use only a 1/2 teaspoon of salt. I added in green peppers and used sausage insted of bacon. Yum!

Delicious & easy!  Even my husband asked, "Isn't quiche supposed to have pastry?" :) It was great without! I changed it up a bit, since I didn't have bacon, substituting diced mushrooms, which I sauteed with the onion.  Also added a bit of extra-sharp white cheddar cheese to give it some bite.  I'll definitely make this one again; thanks for sharing!

A super easy, versatile, tasty quiche recipe.  It's true that many times I haven't made quiche just to not make the crust (store bought- bland).  This recipe saves me from that, and it really doesn't need the crust.  I made it with the cheeses that I had on hand, saving a handful for sprinkling on top in the last 5 minutes. Came out great. No leftovers. Rave reviews. Will make again.

Wonderfully easy and a cinch to throw together!  It came out lovely and fluffy - almost like a souffle!  I usually make the recipe exactly as written the first time in order to give it a fair review, but this time I made some changes based on the ingredients that I had on hand (e.g. ham instead of bacon, other veggies, etc.).  As myrite suggested in the introduction, it's an easy recipe to adapt to your own personal tastes!

I just made this for dinner tonight and it was quick and easy!  My husband went back for seconds and thirds!  I did substitute turkey bacon and low fat cheddar cheese.  I also added 1/4 cup finely chopped red pepper and reduced my fat free milk by 1/4 cup.  I omitted the salt completely and added black pepper.  It was delicious!  Will definitely be making again and again!  Thanks!

I loved this recipe! I added a few things though. I used a mix of cheddar and jalapeno cheese, and layered with turkey bacon or ham cubes. Then sliced mushroom, and diced tomato. I also doubled the egg mixture and removed the flour and put it in a 16x9" baking dish. YUM!

This was very good and a quick easy recipe for a different, tasty breakfast.  I used dried onion, sausage, and added some halved cherry tomatoes and green pepper.  You could substitute almost anything that suits your tastes, I think.  Will certainly make again.

So good! I used a couple more pieces of bacon, added garlic powder and omitted the onions. The middle won't rise as much as the outside, but that isn't a problem. Mine fell after it came out of the oven, but tasted great-even my super picky husband who usually hates quiche ate it!

Delicious. Took at least 15-20 mins longer to bake. Eggs still soft... maybe less milk? Used colby jack instead of swiss, ham instead of bacon, no onion, no butter, and added broccoli.

Way too much salt. A whole teaspoon! Yikes. It made our mouths burn. Aside from that, great recipe and we will make it often (with maybe 1/4 tsp of salt max).

This is really good.  Made it exactly as written but used cream instead of milk (needed to use up a open container).  Turned out great.  For my personal taste I will probably cut back on the onions next time.

This was yummy! It was my second Quiche ever and it was delicious! I did use a frozen deep dish pie crust. I also used shrimp, spinach, cheddar, and mozz. cheese instead of the bacon & Swiss. This was really easy. Had to whisk a little longer to get the lumps from the flour out! My husband ate half of the Quiche in one shot. I had to keep him off of the other half!(Funny but very true) He said he should have just taken the whole pie! That speaks for itself! Will try it next time with ham and broc.

This was delish!  I added fresh spinach on top of the bacon and cheese before I added the liquid.  It also took about an extra 15 minutes to cook but that may have been because the spinach added extra moisture.

This recipe is awesome!  My husband is not a "quiche man", but he LOVED this!!  I tweaked it a little to use the ingredients I had on hand:  I had sliced swiss cheese, so put 4 slices on top of the crumbled bacon in the bottom of the pie pan.  I used a little bit of the bacon grease to saute some thin-sliced ham and sliced mushrooms,  and layered that on next.  I covered that with some shredded monterey jack cheese.  I mixed the rest of the ingredients as directed, although I used seasoned salt in place of the salt.  I poured the mixed liquid ingredients over everything, and baked as directed.  YUMMM!!  It's been good as leftovers, too!

This is a delicious recipe -- no matter what you call it. How sad some peeps rate a recipe by its name rather than by how it tastes......

I have tried a crustless Quiche before and loved it.  I prefer no crust and my family enjoys it more.  So, this recipe is very welcome.  I use turkey bacon instead of pork & enjoy it just as much.

Excellent and easy!  Next time I will use canadian bacon to cut down on the fat.  I'm looking forward to having leftover's for breakfast!!  Oh, I did saute the onion in the 2 T butter and then scraped it all into the egg mixture.  I just felt like raw onions wouldn't be cooked enough for the kids.  I'm glad I did this as it made the onions soooo sweet.

This is fantastic and so easy. I made it with ham and Costco's 4-cheese blend for a scrapbook group. Everyone loved it.

This was very good and super easy!  I added some broccoli and mushrooms to this as well.  I steamed the broccoli and onion in the microwave so that it was slightly tender before I mixed it in with the eggs. I love that this recipe can be so adaptable to your own family's tastes!  Both my 4 & 2 yr. old ate their portion and they usually care for eggs.  Will definitely make again.

Very quick and easy to make.  I added whole wheat flour instead of regular, and added some broccoli and peppers to sneak in some veggies.  Yum!

I love when I have everything in the house on a lazy Saturday morning for a recipe.  I used leftover ham, broccoli, and shredded cheddar cheese.  I added cheese to the top at the end and it made the crispy crust so yummy.  I had to cook an extra 10 min. or so to let the middle set.  The kids and I ate the whole thing while my husband slept.  :)

Loved this quick and easy recipe. My guests raved over the version I made!  My changes: 4 slices of bacon instead of 8 Reduced melted butter to 1 tbsp.  Omitted onion all together Added 1/2 cup chopped fresh spinach Added 12 jumbo cooked shrimp (shelled and cut into pieces)  Follow recipe as written adding the spinach and shrimp to the bacon and cheese. Mix remaining ingredients together and pour over other ingredients.  I cooked my version at 375 degrees F. for 50 minutes. Test centre with knife and removed when eggs are set.  Enjoy! We sure did!!!

Two words to describe this recipe: EXCELLENT and EASY! This is a great recipe, and so versatile, you could add any fillings you like. I didn't have bacon, so I substituted with something similar to Pastrami (here in Egypt it's called "Basterma"), cooked it in some vegetable oil after cutting it up in small bits. I added chopped onion, like the recipe describes, and added shredded Parmesan cheese instead of the Swiss (didn't have Swiss on me). The batter mixture was super easy to assemble; most of the time was spent baking the quiche in the oven. I think next time I'll be trying it w/ some broccoli and cheese or something. But definitely, you should give this recipe a try. Thank you Myrite! :)

This was very good.  I forgot the milk the first time I made it and was wondering why it was so dense and dry.  :)  The second time, I followed the recipe correctly and it turned out perfect.  I did, however bake it for 6-7 extra minutes to make sure it was done and it was still very moist.

Definately quick and very tastey!  Mine took about 10 minutes longer to bake than stated.  I was looking for a recipe like my mother's because I couldn't find hers, and this is very similar to my mother's except not near as dense.  After dinner I found her recipe, which calls for 8 eggs to the same amount of milk and flour and placed in a 9x13 pan and I think I may prefer that, but it's just a matter of preference and this was an excellent substitute recipe so thank you!

Tried this today and it is delicious.  When it is done, it has a custard-like surfact and may not look as though it is "set" - but run your knife into the center and if it comes out clean, it is done.  I made two of these at once and guests loved both - one bacon and one smoked salmon.

This is a great quiche and easy to put together after a very long day.  I also left out the butter and used skim milk and was delighted with the results.

I used mozz. cheese in this and loved it. It took longer than stated, but I used a pastry shield to prevent over browning of the crust. Will make this again the next brunch I serve.

mmmmmmm, i made this delicious recipe as a breakfast treat over memorial day weekend. no modifications were made aside from cutting back the salt (since the bacon & cheese have it) using a mellow baby swiss cheese & broiling the quiche 1-2 minutes to a golden brown. terrific as a leftover too. thank you debbie!

This recipe is great and very versatile. I used honey ham lunch meat, and laid it over the shredded cheese on the bottom of the pan. It turned out great after 35 minutes in the oven and 4 minutes under the broiler. I might use a little less salt next time, but my boyfriend loved it as is.

I needed to make a meal with just the ingredients I had on hand, and this fit the bill perfectly. I used ham instead of bacon and left out the onion (because my husband won't eat it). It took about 50 minutes before it set (I used a glass pie pan). Easy and delicious, will try this again with different variations.

I made this today while my husband grumbled the entire time, "Real men don't eat quiche." I added sliced grape tomatoes, shredded zucchini, diced mushroom, and asiago cheese. Baked for 45 mins at 350 and broiled for 4 minutes (could have used 5). I did use a glass 10 inch pie plate. My husband ate two helpings in less than 10 minutes. Will definitely add this to my favorites!

This is indeed quick to prepare.  I made it for my wife and me.  I immediately put it in my recipe box so I can find it again.  We loved it. I used cheddar cheese because we did not have swiss cheese on hand.  We will have swiss cheese to use when we make this again.

I have made very much the same recipe for years and love it.  I do wonder why the recipe calls for flour.  I've never used it for my quiches and they turn out very well. As a result, it's great for those of us who limit our carbs.  Also, if you want a really luxurious taste, use heavy cream rather than milk.

This is great! You can actually leave out the flour altogether and it is still great! Crustless quiche! 
Make a bunch of them in large muffins pan and freeze for instant breakfast.??

This was great!  I made it with Red Mill gluten baking flour blend instead of flour since I am gluten free....turned out amazine!  I also used half and half instead of milk for a more rich flavor (with extra calories of course).  We made one with sausage and one with just vegy, both were delicious!  Definitely will make it again.

So easy and delicious! I read the suggestions and used only 1 cup of milk. Threw in some ham instead of bacon ( didn't have any bacon on hand), 1/4 bell pepper chopped, a cup of spinach chopped, and 1/4 cup of chopped cherry tomatoes, subbed the salt with garlic salt, and it was delicious! Baked in ramekins (filled 3 of them following the same measurements as the recipe) for 40 minutes at 350!

This was the first quiche I have ever made.  I used this recipe but modified it a little.  I did not have shredded swiss cheese, so I used a fiesta blend cheese and added some bell peppers and jalapenos to make a Southwestern quiche.  It turned out great!

Made this as directed, using bacon and spinach with a small amount of red onion.  Delicious!  This one's a keeper.

Made this today, and modified a few things. I had some leftover ham, and diced it fine instead of using bacon. I also used cheddar, omitted the butter, and added some spinach, a bit of feta, and a little parmesan. I'd add a few more herbs next time, but overall this was very tasty. Had to cook it for almost an hour to set it properly, so I would cut the amount of milk next time. The husband loved it.

I liked it. I used three links of Italian sausage, removed the casings, crumbled, and browned them. I sauteed the onion in the butter for five minutes. I cut back the salt to 1/2 teaspoon and that was plenty. I added a little fresh chopped parsley for color. I was worried that all that stuff wouldn't fit in a 9-inch pie pan, but it did. After 35 minutes of baking, I jiggled the pan and could see that the center was not set. So I baked it an extra 5 minutes. It was still a little loose in the center, so I probably could have gone an extra ten minutes. It would have browned more too. It needs to stand at least 20 minutes after it comes out of the oven, to set up.

I have never made any type of quiche before so I was a bit wary, but this came out great! Only alteration was to use complete pancake batter instead of flour, since that's what I had on hand. Next time I will make a double batch in a 9x13 because this quiche was quickly devoured by just 2 people!

Mine turned out pretty good.  Even my husband, who is a nonadventurous eater, liked it.  I am allergic to milk, so I substituted water for milk and left out the cheese.  I also substituted gluten free flour, which did not work as good.  Next time, I plan to try a gluten free pizza crust in the pie pan.

Great, easy recipe! I used cheddar since I didn't have swiss and added spinach. I layered the bacon and cheese before I poured the mixture in and the bacon and cheese moved to the edges. Next time I'm going to mix everything, then pour in the pan. Definitely going to make again!

I just became a member of allrecipes.com JUST so that I could give this recipe the 5 stars it deserves.  It's great as is, but I usually add more bacon and hot sauce since my husband is basically a carnivore.  Once out of the oven, this dish rarely survives an hour...and there's just 2 of us.

One of the best quiches I have had.  I made with maple sausage and cheddar.  I took some advice from another reviewer and used pancake mix instead of flour and I believe that this is the key!  The sweet flavor that the pancake mix offers is what makes this quiche so delicious.

This is a wonderful quick quiche.  I followed the recipe but did a quick saute of the onions in the amount of melted butter called for in the recipe.  If baked in an 8" square pan and cut into 1 inch squares, this would make a nice addition to an appetizer buffet.  Delightful!

Our tradition is that on every Sunday we have homemade breakfast/brunch.  I always make it a point to have a full meal to start our day and am always looking for a new recipe (plain ol' bacon and eggs gets very boring after a while).  Found this recipe last night and very happy I did.  I cut back the bacon to 5 slices, omitted the onion, and opted for shredded cheddar cheese.. all variations were due to my unwillingness to go to the store for something different :)  The only CHANGE to this recipe I made was instead of melting the butter I left this cold and chunky throughout the egg mixture so it melted slowly while cooking.  The flour made it taste as though there was a crust.  Altogether this made 4 servings for us and it was so good!  I will for sure be making this again!!

Thought I had reviewed this awhile back but I was wrong!  Great light supper on a busy night when paired with a tossed salad.  I didn't have Swiss so I used Cheddar, but next time I'll try it as written.

Don't get me wrong, this quiche had a wonderful flavor. I baked it ten minutes longer than written and the eggs didn't seem to set up. Next time, I will add 1 cup of milk and see if that works better.

Exceptional!!  I used many of the suggestions in the reviews.  Also, sauteed onions, added mushrooms.  Used cheddar and mozzarella and added broccoli.  Next time I will skip the salt completely, we like LOTS of cheese and it has plenty of salt, almost overdid it.  Also baked in my cast iron skillet.  Another fav for our family!  Thank you :)

This is now one of our staples.  You can use many different ingredients.  I make a batch and a half in a larger glass pan.  For a batch and half in a glass pan it generally takes about 55 minutes to cook through.  I basically use whatever is left in the fridge.  I have added 1C broccoli or Spinach.  I also substituted ham for the bacon, mozzarella for the swiss, etc.  It's a very good, base for whatever type of quiche you want to make.  Thanks for the recipe.

yummy... made mine with bacon, onion and some frozen green bell pepper I had in the freezer. Will certainly make it again. It's nice not having the crust. I used a Demarle mold and the baking time was twice as long. I was surprised how very creamy it was even though I used skim milk

DELICIOUS!  My boys are 3 and 1 1/2 and they LOVE it too.  I let it cook about 40 min or so instead of the 35 min.  
Thank you, a new meal for the family.

This quiche is really delicious.  I doubled the recipe and it took a lot longer to cook.  I baked it for at least an hour in my stoneware and it was still a little "mushy" in the middle.  I might use a little bit less milk next time.  But it tasted great!

I cook eggs terribly, so I was hoping to find a delicious breakfast recipe. IT WAS WONDERFUL! This is the first quiche I have ever made, and there is no need to try another recipe- this is perfect!

Made a few changes to lower the calories and fat- used whole wheat flour, a few egg whites in place of a couple of the eggs, added spinach, used turkey bacon and 2% milk. Amazing recipe. Thank you!

GREAT!  This is a fantastic basic recipe that you can customize to what you have on hand.  The ratios are perfect.  I doubled the recipe, and baked it in a 13x9x2 pan - it took about an hour to bake at 350*, but that was to be expected since I had doubled the amount.  My family, who does not like quiche at all, LOVED this 'breakfast casserole'. :)  Ah, the power of a name. 
I used ham and cheddar cheese, substituting rice flour for a gluten-free alternative, and it worked wonderfully.  
The family enjoyed spending dinner time thinking of all the things that we could put in it next time... and saying that we should just call it 'leftover casserole' and use up whatever leftovers were in the frig at the time.
Thank you for taking the time to share this great recipe!  I appreciate it!

I've made this twice now, once with bacon and once with sausage. It came out super both times. 5 kids and 2 grown men loved it. I'll make this again and again. It's a good basic quiche recipe you can expand on based on the contents of your pantry. Thank you for this winner of a recipe.

Tastes great, cooked really well and was super easy! Cooked in casserole dishes instead of pie plates, so was just like a Quiche Casserole.

This was a good base recipe that you can change up to meet your tastes. I added spinach to mine and thought that it was a good addition. I had trouble getting the flour to blend with the milk and eggs. I ended up using a little cornstarch mixed with milk because my flour didnt blend. Other reviews were correct that you dont even miss the crust.

Love love love this quiche.  Adding flour to the mix combined with the cheese layer on the bottom makes it have a bread- like crust layer which is delicious.  Some other reviewers complained about it taking too long to cook, so I cut back on the milk by about a 1/4 cup and cook it for 40 minutes and it comes out perfect.

This was the first quiche I ever made...and it was so easy and delicious.  I decided to go very basic with just some cheddar cheese and chopped turkey meat for the kids and wife.  I plan to use this recipe again and start customizing the ingredients and naming each dish.  This will easily become a regular weekend breakfast staple.

So good and easy! First time ever making quiche. I didn't have that much bacon so I combined what I had with tiny chopped breakfast sausages for the bottom. I also added fresh uncooked broccoli florets to the egg mix, mushrooms sauteed in butter and garlic, and a teaspoon of italian seasoning. I didn't have regular milk, so I used rice milk, which seemed to need a few extra minutes in the oven. Everyone scarfed it down. I don't know if I'll ever take the time to make a crust since this was so awesome.

I really like this one.  Easy, especially if you used frozen diced onions.  I switch bacon for ham and use 5 eggs and whatever cheese (especially cheddar) that I happen to have.  Yum, even the kids eat it.  Oh, it took longer to cook than the recipe called for, more like 45 minutes so give yourself time

A-MA-ZING. I love how it made its own crust! We skipped the onions and only had cheddar. I can't wait to try it with different ingredients.

My kids (ages 7 & 4) loved this "egg pie."  I used what I had on hand:  black forest deli ham, cheddar cheese, green onion and it turned out great.  I used 5 eggs.  I did have to bake it longer - maybe even 15 or 20 minutes longer than the recipe calls for.  Next time I would reduce salt just a bit.  The ham or bacon would more than make up for the reduced salt.  Simply Scrumptious - will definitely have this again!

              Fast forward to one week later - Nov. 4 - we had it again & loved it again.  Used bacon this time - Yummy.

Love, love, love this!!!  Will use over and over, especially because you can adapt this to your own likings.  I had some leftover potatoes, so I added those with the bacon and cheese.  This assemble in minutes, and the oven does the rest of the work.  I did let it sit for about 5-10 minutes after baking to let it set up and make it easier to cut.  Thanks for such a versatile, delicious recipe!

Wow, I loved this.  I cut the recipe in half and baked it for about 25 minutes in a shallow casserole dish.  I used ham instead of bacon, lightly steamed broccoli, and sauteed the onions before adding them.  The cheese backs in the bottom of the dish, almost like a crust.  Really rich, great texture.  So good and easy!

I was expecting this to be good but I have to say, it was much better than I had imagined!   It was light and tasty.  I made one addition - I had some deli ham I wanted to use up so I diced it and added it.  I did as another reviewer said and used pre-cooked, crumbled bacon - about 1/2 Cup.  I left everything else the same.  I can see where this could be a great base to add other ingredients such as broccoli, sun dried tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms, crumbled sausage or other cheeses.  The possibilities are endless.  Thank you, myrite for posting this one!

Loved it.  We used sausage, broccoli and mushrooms instead of bacon because I had a little leftover sausage.  As per a few reviews, I sauted the onions (and broccoli) in the sausage grease before adding them, and I had to increase cook time by about 10 minutes because the center was a little runny.  I'll definitely make this again.

UPDATE:  I have made this at least 8 times now, and have used ham, morning star veggie sausage (2 patties) and spinach -- all awesome, so don't worry about mixing it up!  I also took the suggestions to use pancake mix instead of flour, and lately I use a 1/2 tsp of onion powder instead of the onion (quicker and we actually prefer it)  I usually use spinach and mushroom and I saute them quickly in the butter instead of just adding the melted butter to the mix.  After trial and error, I bake this at 375 for 20-25 minutes and it turns out great.  The edges are golden, but not too crusty.  Many people have complimented this recipe.

Really yummy and super easy!  Only had a few slices of bacon, so added some ham and used cheddar instead of Swiss.  Next time I think I might add an extra egg for a more "eggy" taste and lightly flour the pan to reduce the sticking on the bottom.  Used a metal pan and had to bake an extra 7 minutes for the center to be done.  The kids won't eat quiche, but they loved "egg pie" and even asked for seconds. :)

This was my first time making quiche, I don't care to bake so I like the fact that I don't have to mess with a crust. I did not have swiss cheese on hand so I used colby-jack and threw a hand full of left over ham and a hand full of chopped onion into the egg mixture. This was very good and very filling but I thought it was very rich and I could almost hear my arteries and heart arguing over who was going to dial 911. I was only able to eat one small peice because of this. I will make this again but I think I will cut back on the cheese and add some mushroom next time. Overall it was good and quick & easy to make without a lot of clean up afterwards.

This was a very tasty dish, but for some reason, mine turned out very flat.  It blew up like a balloon in the middle of cooking and then deflated just like one.  I'm thinking that is has something to do with the High Altitude that I live in (8,000 ft above sea level).  I'm giving it five stars because even though it was the weirdest looking quiche I ever saw, it was pretty tasty (and one shouldn't fault the recipe just because of one's altitude ;D)

WONDERFUL ! I used 4 slices bacon and 1/4 c diced pepperoni, also added a little oregano and nutmeg, and subbed longhorn cheese! Even added some diced,cooked spaghetti noodles for a little "volume"! I have determined that ANYTHING GOES in a quiche! LOVE IT!!

4 stars for a great base that you can do anything with! I too omitted the butter and did not miss it at all, and I used cheddar cheese as I had that on hand. I grated a small russet potato and added that to the mix, it was a great addition (you could also chop it into small cubes and add). Also, in my oven at 350 in a glass pie plate it took a good 45 minutes to cook. Next time I will saute the onions beforehand, they were crunchy, and I will also add more spices, it was a little bland for my taste.

this was very good, I made it the same night I made a traditional quiche and this was preferred by both the kids and me.  I almost forgot to add the flour, so I had to mix everything (including meat, cheese, milk and eggs) in one big bowl.  Still good!  We liked it very much and of course, you can customize any way you like!

I really liked the ease of this quiche.  But I did choose to leave out the salt.  It was way too salty for our taste when I made it as directed.  We will be having this again and again.  Thank you for a wonderful receipe.

I modified the ingredients a bit to suit personal taste! I used 1 1/2 cups of cubed lean ham instead of using bacon, only beaaten 2 eggs instead of 4 and but added 2 cups of broccoli with a dash of salt for extra healthiness! I have also added 1 tbsp of corn flour into flour mixture when beating to ensure that it thickens nicely. The quiche even tasted better on the next day and  I may add in some shredded carrots as well as sliced tomatoes for a change of taste next time as it is really a forgiving and easy recipe.

This was a yummy recipe for quiche. I didn't have a pie pan, so I used a square glass pan about the same size and cooked it for 45 minutes. I served the quiche with La Victoria green sauce, and it completely hit the spot! I'm totally using this recipe again!

Quick and easy, I fried up the bacon then sauted the onions in a cast iron pan. Then added the cheese and topped w/ the milk and flour mixture, baked for 35 minutes with no broiling needed to brown. Thanks so much for the quick meal recipe!

Amazingly easy and really delicious!  It's great if you eliminate the butter and add in chopped spinach or broccoli.  It takes 7 or 8 extra minutes to bake in a ceramic pie plate.  I also use prepared, reduced fat bacon pieces to make it even quicker.  Definitely a winner!

This is a great recipe and the other reviews were very helpful as well.  This is a great dish to make if you're trying to work with what you have at the house!  Instead of using Swiss cheese I used cheddar and a little Parmesan, Morning Star vegetarian bacon, about 2 1/2 tbsp of butter, 2% milk...and added asparagus, red pepper, finely chopped onion, a pinch of minced garlic, salt, pepper, and a little dried basil.  I baked it at 375 degrees for about 50 minutes and it came out wonderfully! :)

This was easy to make and very tasty.  I sauteed the onions in the 2tbsps of butter and it had a nice oniony flavor.  Maybe could use a bit more bacon.

I may never make a crust for quiche again! Although I really like pie crust, this cuts preparation time to practically nothing, and I didn't even miss the crust. For extra laziness I used pre-cooked bacon. I made substantial tweaks to the actual ingredients list because I already have a recipe that I love (more cheese, replace some of the milk with sour cream, leave the onion in rings, add garlic and sprinkle the top with paprika and parsley), but thanks for giving me the courage to go crustless!

Wow! I am only 15 and I made this recipe for me and my family the other day. It was so easy and fun to make. Everyone loved it so much, including my picky sister. :P

I read alot of the reviews, and I also sauted the onions for about 3 minutes before I put them into the mix.

Everything turned out awesome!! :]

YUMMY!!!  And so easy! I was so happy to get this recipe today. Hubby looked at it and said, "yeah, make it for me".  He was half kidding, but I had all the ingredients, so I did!  It took about 50
minutes in the oven, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  It turned out perfectly!  I can't wait to try it with other ingredients.  This recipe is a keeper!  Thanks!

I have made this recipe many times and love how quick and easy it is. Made it this morning for my in-laws and they loved it too. Ham, mushrooms, onions and co-jack shredded cheese were in it for breakfast today but have made it before with spinach or whatever else we have on hand! It does take about 5 minutes longer to bake firm than the recipe states though...

I made this quiche for 6 people.  Three rated it a 5 and three rated it a 1.  Personally I found the "crust" that formed doughy and unappealing.  I did love that it was easy to make and might try it again with a 1/4 cup flour.  As well, it took 50 minutes to bake.

So yummy and easy!  I used diced ham, omitted the butter and used Colby cheese instead of Swiss. (just used what was in my frig.) I'm amazed at the crust that forms and the fluffy texture of the eggs.  Next time I will make this will FULL confidence.  Thanks for the keeper!!

Love this recipe - so easy and delicious! Hubby and I devoured half in one sitting. Changed out ham instead of bacon because we didn't have any, and added broccoli.  Well definitely make I again.

I loved this recipe! I wanted an egg bake that didn't require bread. I made it with less bacon, added spinach,  and omitted the butter, just to lighten it up a bit. It was delicious--a perfect brunch or dinner dish. Also reheats well for breakfast the next day.

This was a wonderful base!  I like that the flour provided a simple healthy "crust" as opposed to all the extra fat in pie crusts.    I did make changes according to my needs/preferences.    First, I substituted ham for bacon to save myself a dirty pan.   I substituted cheddar for Swiss, onion powder for onions, and added frozen broccoli.   I reduced the amount of butter.  Finally, since we are watching cholesterol, I substituted egg beaters for half of the eggs.   (This was the first time I used egg beaters and was a little Hesitant, but this recipe was wonderful with them and no one could tell!).    Even my children liked this and my mother in law gave it her stamp of approval.   While I will continue to explore quiche recipes, I will add this recipe to my list of keepers.  And I must add, it looked just lovely all puffed out coming out of the oven.

I use this recipe about 3x a month. I have used a variety of ingredients and every time it comes out amazing. I often use egg whites instead of eggs. It is simply The Best quiche recipe I have found. So, so, so good! A staple in my cookbook! Thanks for sharing!!!

Really delicious.  I did add spinach ... gave it extra zip.  Exactly 35  minutes to cook.  Need to allow more than stated prep time of 15 minutes... More like half hour, as bacon takes time even in microwave.  I had to shred cheese ... couldn't buy shredded.  Assembling time adds up.  This was more than an hour's job.

Great recipe!  I added ham as well as different veggies (such as peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes, broccoli etc.)
Also, instead of flour I used pancake mix. It adds a hint of sweet and seems to rises better.

I came home after spending 4 days in hospital and a diagnosis of a Duodenal ulcer.  My first thought was what's for supper given my new diet. Easy with mild changes omitting any products which may offend my newly acquired dietician, and we had a quiche.  Such a nice simple recipe. Thanks. I shall be maxing my data bundle with new recipes.

Used 5 eggs, so I added a little extra milk and flour.  Sauteed the onions in the bacon pan in just a tiny bit of butter (only because I used turkey bacon so there was no grease in the pan). Super easy (even easier if you use pre-cooked bacon or chopped ham).  I thought it could use a bit more flavor, although I used cheddar cheese since my kids don't like swiss - the swiss would help, I think.  Great weeknight, low-carb meal.

I never made quiche before this recipe. I've since tried a few other recipes and the family always asks me to go back to this one. I've added many different meats and veggies and they love it.

Made this today after following advice from others. It was really good!
Pure rustic comfort food!
Used pancake mix instead of flour.
Reduced milk to one cup
Added peppers to the onion sautéed  in bacon grease
Added diced broccoli
Dotted halved cherry tomatoes on the top
It took an hour to bake. 
No butter or salt because it definitely didn't need it.
Thank you for a great recipe!

I've never had quiche before and this was a great introductory recipe.  I didn't have onions so I used onion powder, and I didn't have swiss cheese so I used shredded extra sharp cheddar and Velveeta slices.  I also added chopped up baby spinach leaves for color and left out the butter. It was very good. My 18 year old who doesn't experiment with food enjoyed it too.  I'm looking forward to making this again and playing with the ingredients.  Maybe I'll add more veggies next time.  Definitely recommend.

Very good recipe.  Only thing we do is usually use cheddar.  Sometimes I add very finely chopped broccoli to it.  Have been using this recipe for years.  I did try to make ahead once and it didn't work well.  My fault.  Things settle badly when it's left too long.  Thanks!

Made it as written except for substituting sausage for the bacon. (it was what I had on hand) It was a hit with my family, we had it for brunch. What a wonderful base for many wonderful combinations of ingredients, I know this will be on my recipe list for a long time to come. Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

Great! I used complete pancake mix in place of the flour, as another reviewer suggested, which was wonderful. I also heated it an additional 5 min since I used a glass pie dish. My husband thought it was the best quiche he'd ever had. It was good right after I made it, but it was even better the next day reheated. Will be making many, many more times!

I like the fact that you don't have to have a crust for this recipe.  It had just a little crisp and I actually think I prefer this over a crust. I think I will go with 5 eggs next time, tho.

Thanks so much for this super simple recipe!! The only things I changed were sautéing the onions first (in bacon grease), adding less butter (maybe 1 tbsp) and I used cheddar because that's what I had in the house. Excellent and I can't believe how easy it was.

This was truly incredible!!!! Wow! Delicious! I added chicken, fresh broccoli and tomato. I didn't use ham and I used marble cheddar cheese since I didn't have Swiss. Even cold later it was fantastic. I don't think I will ever make a quiche with a crust again because this was perfect! And easy!

This is my go-to quiche recipe, since I rarely take the time to make my own crust (and I don't use store-bought ones). It is easy and yummy! I typically use smoked ham (sandwich meat) rather than bacon since I have it on hand and it is a healthier option. Always nice to be able to mix up the ingredients according to what you have on hand. I often add spinach.

I use this recipe every time I make quiche as an outline.  I have switched the additionals to things like ham and cheddar, spinach and mushroom, etc.  either way, it is always a hit!

I really enjoyed this, and will definately do it again.  I changed it a little.  I used sweet onions, spinich, and sun dried tomatos.  I think using the sweet onions and especially the sun dried tomatos really made the dish for me, because I used a little less salt and low sodium pre-cooked bacon.

P.S. my cook time was more than the posted time, but it was still quick and extremely easy!

Because of the cook time and the believe that without the sun dried tomatos it would of been a little bland, I gave it 4 our of 5.  BUT I will be doing this again, and soon.  Thanks for the recipe :).

OMG This is Great.  Easy to make.  And very versatile.  This is going into my menu plan, not just my menu file.

Real men have no problem eating quiche, and asking for more!

Supplemented green pepper for onion and added Parmesan.  We were completely stuffed from the first piece, but kept going back for more.  Super simple to make.

This was the first recipe I used to make quiche. I use this recipe as my base and add ingredients and usually don't use the bacon. Use any cheese, add veggies. Just remember any wet vegetable will make more liquid in your quiche.
Today I substituted a half cup salsa for half cup of milk. Very good!

This was really simple to make. It is a great throw together meal. I wanted a little more color, so I added frozen diced peppers and dried chives, which made it look really nice, as they rose to the top when it baked. I will use sausage next time (a personal preference) and put in a few more spices to add a bit more flavor. As simple meals go, it's great. Thanks for the recipe! :)

So easy! I suggest removing the butter and salt from this recipe. You can't taste the difference. I use 6 slices of bacon, add chopped broccoli and spinach. Using mild cheddar for Swiss works well too. So versatile!

I though this was pretty good although my husband questioned it a bit :) Very quick and easy to make.  I did use mild cheddar because that's what i had, but i think the Swiss it called for would have been better. It came out a bit too moist in the middle, which was the only thing I didn't really care for. I would make this again but I would cook it a bit longer or use less milk to help firm it up. I like that this is easily adaptable to your tastes and what you have on hand (like swapping cheeses and meats, adding veggies, etc).  Overall a good recipe, just needs a few tweaks for me.

This was great. I made this for my brother for dinner. His diet won't let him eat flour or milk so I used light cream instead and just omitted the flour entirely. I doubled the butter and used Swiss and Cheddar cheese. He really liked it but we both would have added more bacon as a personal preference. Thank you.

This was super easy and seems to work with whatever I have on hand.  I did not have any bacon and wasn't sure how the cheese would work at the bottom of the pan, so I sauteed some mushrooms and spinach, set aside to cool.  Mixed together eggs, salt, milk and flour; added cheese, mushrooms and spinach; mixed well and poured into a pan.  It was delicious.  I've tried with reduced fat swiss cheese and mexican fiesta cheese.  Both were very good.  I also omitted the melted butter as other reviewers recommended.

This was decent.Although I don't think there is a great need for a whole teaspoon of salt in this, I didn't think that it made the dish much saltier tasting than it would have been without it.Bacon is by itself pretty salty so you won't really be able to say whether or not it's salty because of the bacon or because of the 1tsp of salt...lol if that makes any sense.I didn't have butter so I had to use 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil but really if there is any dish that doesn't need the extra fat, it's this one!I also didn't have the swiss cheese so added a sprinkling of parmesan but like I said this didn't need all the extra fat.It all had a nice taste.The texture was like really fluffy eggs. I usually would prefer something a bit firmer. The flour formed a bit of a crust at the bottom.I had to soak up the grease that pooled at the top. I'll probably use other recipes in the future but I think this was worth trying at least once. (Note: I hate when people review recipes that they have altered but I didn't really miss the swiss cheese and the butter wouldn't have improved it.)

OMG!  This was amazing.  I just made this and it was so deliscious.  I will definitely be making this again.  Wow, I cant stop eating this.  So yum, the only thing I changed was that I used cheddar cheese since I had swiss on hand.  But it came out so good.

This was delicious and easy!  I added 1/2 cup canned diced tomatoes and about a cup of sauteed mushrooms.  Cut the amount of cheese because it seemed like too much.  Did not use melted butter because I didn't want the extra fat. I don't like pie crust much so this was perfect.  Thanks!

So easy to make and tastes great. I've made it twice since I found this recipe last week. I added in loads of vegetables, substituted in turkey bacon and replaced half the salt with pepper. It had to stay in the oven a little longer but I highly recommend this recipe. The bonus --tastes even better warmed up the next day!

The last time I tried to make quiche it came out pretty goopy. I was skeptical about making a quiche without the crust, but this recipe is worth it. This was so simple to make. I greased a ceramic circular dish with butter, put some ham and sharp cheddar cheese on the bottom. Then, I mixed the other ingredients together with an electronic mixer. At first I thought that there wouldn't be enough mixture to fill the pan, but it was the perfect amount. I baked the quiche for exactly 30  minutes, and it came out perfectly. The flour settles to form a thicker "crust" at the bottom, making it easy to serve. One quarter quiche was the perfect amount for dinner!

This is the most delicious dish I've had in a long time! I made mini quiche for a potluck at work and people begged me to make the dish again for them. The only thing I did differently was caramelize the onion (I prefer caramelized to just raw - gives it a nice sweet flavor that mixed well with the bacon) I can't wait to make this again! It's so easy and absolutely delectable!

This was a hit with my family!  I left the onion out and instead of swiss I used sharp cheddar cheese.  A nice alternative to our usual weekend breakfast routine.

This was fabulous!  I followed the recipe (only had cheddar cheese though) and the whole thing was delicious.  Thank you so much for this easy quiche recipe - it will  become a regular weekend feature in our house!

Well, I hate to be the lone dissenter here... but this was....  eh - OK.  I mean, its pretty hard to go wrong with cheese and bacon, and it is basically tasty, but the texture has some issues.  First it was very greasy.  (This may have been my fault, it calls for swiss, I had cheddar, which probably has a higher fat content, but even still, it really didn't need the extra butter.)  I ended up with a pool of oil sitting on top.  The second problem I had was the timing.  At 35 minutes, it still didn't look quite done, so I turned the broiler on for a bit.  Even then, I didn't think it was quite cooked enough.  Perhaps if I had used one of those thin aluminum pie plates, the timing would have been better.  I also think the amount of milk may have been kind of high contributing to it seeming like it hadn't really set up.  And lastly, I had thought that the flour might sort of settle making it somewhat more solid at the bottom.  That didn't really happen.  The bottom was just slightly thinker glop.    On the plus side, it was quite quick to put together and seriously -   Bacon -  Cheese yum.    I think next time, if i am going to do something like this - sans pastry, I might just farget the flour and make a frittata.

I followed the recipe exactly and I will definitely make it again. About as easy as it gets  The next time I will eliminate the salt since the sodium in the bacon and cheese is all that is needed.  I will try adding fresh mushrooms and green peppers and use cheddar cheese next time.

I thought this was decent. The flavor was good but it never seemed to set right. I cooked it for 10 minutes longer than suggested and it still didn't seem done all the way (although I know it was). I'll probably make this again but use only 1 cup of milk and eliminate the butter (it pooled on top).

Love this recipe! I think you can use any cheese and any veggies inside and it will be fantastic. I used cheddar cheese, bacon, tomato and onion. Next time I would like to add mushroom. YUM, we all loved it.

Great and quick recipe! I used Mozzarella cheese on the bottom with Turkey Bacon. Tasted delicious and has lower sodium and fat content! Less greasy too! Definitely will save this one. :) Thank you for sharing!

Very, very good!!!  Actually had to use Bisquick because I was out of flour and it was still wonderful... moist and fluffy.  Added little broccoli heads, too, and, voila, a special brunch for friends or family.  Add a fruit medley and you are good to go!!!!

Fantastic. I followed advice of other reviewers and cut the salt in half, and spread a mashed potato into bottom of pan before adding bacon and cheese.  Used an extra egg. Looking forward to making again with a variety of ingredients. Thank you!

Very good as is...it would be easy to customize this however you want but it's delicious just like it is. Only reason for the 4 stars is because it took exactly 53 minutes to bake this at 350degrees, which was very annoying considering I was short on time and trusted the bake time to be accurate. Otherwise, I will definatley make this over again!

Had bacon, leftover veggies and lots of farm fresh eggs I needed to use up. This is heaven whether you call it a quiche, torta, or frittata. You can add all kinds of fillings and it is so yummy. Reheat in the microwave on 50% power. Thanks for a great recipe myrite.

This turned out great! I didn't have swiss cheese though, so I used mild cheddar cheese and a little extra mozzarella cheese than the recipe called for. I was surprised at how easy it is to make, yet it tasted delicious!

I made this recipe as it was and it was just ok! If I make this again, I would make two changes. I would omit the salt and the butter, neither one was needed. The salt was overpowering and the butter made it too greasy! Not my favorite recipe, would definately tweak recipe for next time!!!

My first quiche and it was amazing.  Everyone loved it and it was so easy.  It was too much batter for one deep dish so the next time I used 2 regular sized pie crusts and it was perfect.

Excellent!  Had some friends over for brunch and everyone had seconds...super easy and very yummy!  Only thing I did differently was sauteed the onions with a dab of butter beforehand, and added some mushrooms.  Thanks!

The fact that this quiche has no crust is what I love about it. I usually modify it just a bit, though. Different cheeses and meats. Green peppers.

This is my husband's new favorite quiche recipe-- and he used to hate quiche! Very light and fluffy, and oh so tasty. I followed the recipe pretty faithfully (though I did add a little more bacon and cheese!) and it came out great.

I have made this numerous times and it is always great. Recently, a woman in church needed dinners so I put this in a disposable tin from the dollar store and sent it over. It was the only thing she requested again! This is a great recipe and I make it with a bag of frozen broccoli tips from Aldi. I always have so many eggs from my chickens and this helps me to get rid of them. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was wonderful the wholes family enjoyed.  I made a few changes.. I cooked sausage then chopped in small pieces, sauted red onions.  Will make again for Sunday football games.

Yes, changes made...but permission was given at the outset. I added 3 spears young asparagus, 1 sliced shitake mushroom, used red onions, cheddar cheese and ended up having enough "batter" to do a small quichette besides. Had to add about 15 min. to cook time for the 9 in, but the quichette was done in about 20. Very, very tasty. Having microwaved the bacon, very, very quick, as well.

Wow--what a surprise!  I was just expecting something that was "Quick" and not expecting it to be as tasty as this was.  I added mushrooms and green onions to a little of the bacon grease and threw that in the mix.  We loved it and I am planning on making this again for just me to munch on for a few days since I am going to go back to eating low-carb Monday morning.

Great inspiration recipe. I doubled the ingredients as I added zucchini and mushrooms. I precooked the onions with the vegetables sauteeing them together, seasoned them with ground garlic, cumin and ground oregano. I used mild cheddar cheese and combined 3/4 of it with the mix, sprinkled the top with the rest of the cheese, the crumbled bacon and Italian seasoned breadcrumbs for a crispy crust on top. Delicious!

This has become one of my go to recipes. I mix up the ingredients all the time. Last night I sauteed mushrooms and scallions, let them cool before putting in the bottom of my dish, then added chopped bits of smoked salmon. OMG, it was so delicious! It was gobbled right up by my friends, who didn't seem to notice that there was no true crust.

Incredibly easy recipe.  No swiss cheese in the house and I don't eat meat, so revised it this way:  bottom layer - shredded sharp cheddar next layer up - chopped onions next layer up - sun dried tomatoes next layer up - crumbled feta cheese  I added minced garlic, pepper, and basil to the egg mixture then poured this over the layers.  Cooked up beautifully.  A nice, savory vegetarian dish!

This is a great, quick way to use up some extra eggs and whatever cheese and veggies you have lying around!  I usually don't like the crust of quiche, and with this recipe, who needs it?!?

Great recipe for a quick and easy meal that people with all sorts of different tastes can enjoy. Also great when other things are thrown in, like chopped green peppers, broccoli or sliced mushrooms... you know, whatever is leftover in my fridge.

Two words: EASY and YUM!  I measured everything the night before and mixed it in the morning.  I ommitted the onions.  One thing I love about this is that everything goes in one bowl.  Less mess, less hassle.  I will keep this one in the recipe box for sure!  Thanks!

I used crumbled vegetarian sausage instead of bacon, cheddar cheese, and bell pepper instead of onion, but the basic recipe is still the same since it's SO versatile!  Also added about 1/8 teaspoon baking powder because so many other reviewers used pancake mix, which I don't have.  I accidentally mixed the cheese in with the other ingredients but it still formed a nice crust.  Next time I'll try sprinkling the cheese in the bottom of the dish.  In any case, it turned out wonderfully- my fiance had 2 servings- and I'm already thinking of different things to put in this quiche.  Ham and swiss, pesto and tomato, pepperoni and mushrooms... there are so many possibilities!

I love this recipe!  It is so easy to make, and comes out great every time.  I always have a package of bacon on hand, so I just use that and whatever random cheese and veggies I have in the fridge and it has yet to disappoint.  I also always use more onion than it calls for and some garlic.  One tip though is to beat the flour in with the eggs to get a smooth consistency before adding the other wet ingredients.  The first time I made this I added the ingredients in the order specified and could not get the lumps out.

Very good; very simple! This was my first attempt at quiche and the fact that this was crustless was really appealing. I read several reviews and skipped the butter completely. I added onion, red pepper, turkey bacon and mozzarella. I sprayed my pie pan with Pam & it worked out great! I had to cook approximately 50 minutes at 350 in my glass pan. Thank you for the recipe!

Followed reviewer's suggestion to increase ingredients by half for a 9 x 13 pan; worked great, added a can of mushrooms, drained, to recipe and some seasonings (garlic powder, dash of chili powder).  Will make again because it is so easy to make, uncomplicated ingredients and it tastes good.

I am a busy Mom of three small children and this was so easy to put together.  Everyone enjoyed it.  I used a well drained can of spinach and bacon.  I also added a tsp. of ground mustard and 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper.  Yummy with cheddar and jack cheese too.  Great recipe!

This was my first attempt at making quiche. I followed the recipe with the exception of sauteeing the onions and added some broccoli (sauteed that slightly with the onions just to soften). Then followed the recipe exactly. 4 eggs was plenty as it nearly overflowed the 9" plate. Bake in convection oven at 350 for 40 minutes and it was set perfectly. My husband never had quiche before and he said it was excellent! Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I love this quiche!! It's great that it works without a crust because of all the calories saved! I sauteed some mushrooms and spinach to add and used no butter and less flour. Yum! Can't wait to make this again. The combo of bacon and swiss is my favorite!

I was so disappointed in this!  It came out flat and dry and had no taste.  I thought it looked strange when I mixed it and with only 4 eggs I should have known it wasn't going to be good.

I've been making different variations of this recipe for the past year, and it has always been a huge hit!! i love adding chopped tofu and mushrooms or spinach to make it healthier, and my husband gobbles it up ALL the time. (BTW, he hates tofu so I never tell him it's in it until he's finished. I don't think he even cares anymore ;p)

This came out great! I had never attempted a quiche before and was taking it to a football brunch, so I was pretty apprehensive. Everyone really liked it. The only change I made was I omitted the onion and added spinach. I would have given this recipe 5 stars, but I had to cook this quiche for almost an hour. I don't know if I added too much of something by mistake or what. But altogether, a great recipe.

This is the first quiche I have ever made, and it was easy and YUMMY!!! I used ham that I "fried" in the skillet to get out the extra water. I sauteed the onions in a small amount of butter, but I omitted the butter from the recipe. I also used cheddar. I baked it for 40 min., then broiled it for a few more to brown the top. It was very tasty.

Good heavens this was good.  I made it for a weeknight dinner and used turkey bacon.  Used the suggestions to mix the flour, eggs, milk, and onion in the blender and I added a dash of worchestershire sauce.  It was delicious and I will *definitely* be making this one again.

Fantastic!  So easy to make and great with whatever fillings you have in the house.  I've make this three time in the past few days (used whole carton of eggs) and each time it turned out great.  Excellent with Tastefully Simple Garlic Garlic instead of salt.

The first time I made Quiche I ended up having to throw it away beucase it was the texture of Jello, so with this recipe I was hesitant to try it.  I'm REALLY glad I did.  It was very easy to follow. I've made this many times now.  I change the recipe just a little since the beginning.  I use a deep dish pie dish with 6 eggs, and reduce the milk by 1/2 cup.  If you dont want to sautee the onion first try grating it on a cheese grater.  You will get all the flavor without the extra step.  We've tried lots of filling combo's and the house favorite is ham, cheddar, onion, and tomato (squeeze all the seeds out or it will be too watery) Sometimes I also add some minced garlic and it adds a nice flavor.  I'll make this over and over.

I came across this looking for a crustless quiche (just didn't feel like making a crust) and this was great. My kids liked it too.  Was great the following morning cold too.  I sauted the onions in some of the bacon drippins (for extra flavor), and added some broccoli left over from the night before.  I did have to cook this much longer than the stated cooking time to get my eggs to set up (just short of an hour).  Only thing I would do differntly would be to cut the butter down to about half.  Came out a little oily ('course that could also be from my onions sauted in bacon drippings).  I can't wait to try other fillers!  Yummy!

i have made this recipe many times and always turns out yummy. i have made a lower fat version where i put in 8 egg whites, skim milk, a light butter and reduced fat cheese and use a deli ham instead of the bacon. sometimes i will add some veggies like mushrooms. always yummy and i like to make it becuase my 1 1/2 year old son won't eat scramblede eggs but LOVES quiche!

What an quick recipe!  I too sauteed onions and I added mushrooms and green peppers.  I also added some of Epicure's 3 Onion Dip and Cheese Chive and Bacon Dip mixes for some added flavour.  Awesome!

The name says it all. Super quick and super tasty. Brought it to an office breakfast and everyone raved about it. I added some cubed ham in addition to the bacon, which helped beef up the meatiness a little. Otherwise, I didn't change a thing. This quiche is a winner!

I think I found my "recipe". I have tried almost every one I can find! This is just perfect. Versatile and easy! I find no matter what I do, using a pie crust just doesnt yield my expectations. I tried this with mozz. cheese instead and great. Will be a regular. Thanks!

Just what I was looking for!  I used to have a "crustless quiche" recipe that used biscuit mix, which I don't always have on hand.  This was just as easy and tasted great!  Iused left-over ham in mine, but this is so adaptable you could put almost anything in it.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Excellent- in fact I preferred this to my quiche recipes with crust!  I eliminated the meat (don't eat it!) and combined sharp cheddar and fresh romano.  Very tasty and light recipe.  Thanks!

This was excellent and YES men do each quiche when it is this recipe.  I changed the bacon to sausage (Jimmy Dean 50% lean) and used only kraft fat-free shredded cheese.  The butter I used was the parkay buttery spray that is also fat-free. I added chopped peppers and mushroons too.  Thanks Debbie for a great recipe

I had to change my review to five stars because when I am in a rush out the door I can make this really quick for the family and they ALL love it!!!  Thank you so much for the recipie - I myself am not an egg eater so I didn't try it.  But my kids loved it!  I didn't have any onions on hand but I used just a little bit of dry minced onions and a tad of garlic powder.  I didn't have bacon but I used some bacon bits and salami as well as ham.  They said it was a bit bland.  But I also didn't have onions in it...may have made a difference. They suggested mixing the meat in with the eggs as well as some tomatoes and parsely.  They also complained that they couldn't taste the cheese but loved the crust that magically appeared!  DEFINATELY a recipie to keep on hand.  With a few adjustments this may come to be an EASY family favorite (except for the non egg eaters like me. :o)

Made this for breakfast this morning. This is a bit doughy for our tastes and had I not added my own seasonings this would have been bland. If you are a bread lover you will love this. This is a good recipe though, especially when you don't have a pie crust. I do think that this is more of a baked omelet than a quiche. Hubby wants to give it a 5, but I am the one typing so I give it a 4. Thank you for the post.

I love this recipe! This has become staple in my recipe collection. The first time I made it, I follwed the directions exactly and WOW! The base recipe can also be tweaked to suit your fancy. I ALWAYS USE 1% MILK and usually omit the butter (the cheese has enough oil on it's own although they do say "Everything's better with butter"!  That said - I've made an all veggie version with bite sized pieces of steamed or a package of frozen chopped spinach that I've defrosted and squeezed by, then added it to a bit of diced sauteed onion, and sliced mushrooms, I've added dijon mustard or dried mustard, I've substituted diced ham for the bacon, I've switched up cheeses and have used cheddar (the pre-shredded stuff is fine), swiss or gruyere.. My only other tweak is that I add a heaping teaspoon of baking powder to the flour to add some additional lightness to the quiche. Last but not least, the quich fits perfectly into a square Pyrex baking dis.

I didn't use any bacon. I placed slices of Swiss  cheese at the bottom o the dish and sped some mozzarella on top of it. I used fresh  broccoli and onions (after I softened them for 8 min.cooking them in mixed olive oil and little butter). I followed the recipe. The result was wonderful.

I was encouraged to try this since it was no crust, and I wanted to use what was on hand at home. I added spinach, green onions, ham and crushed red pepper. I also used muffin tins - 3 eggs made 6 muffins. Also, since I used 1 less egg, I adjusted the cook time to 25 minutes - came out perfect! This was my first time to make quiche, easy peasy.

Have always thought quiche without the crust would be a waste but this was great.  I didn't change a thing.  My only advice is to make sure all the flour is blended in smoothly.  I made two recipes at once and the one with the flour blended in better puffed up very nicely in the oven.  The other was a little flatter but they both tasted great.  Just watch not to overcook it as the sides and bottom will taste like burnt eggs.

This recipe is very good, I've made it over 30 times now. The recipe is great as written. But there are some things I've changed over this period to make it just right for me. I cover the bottom of the quiche plate with a layer of cooked ham, then grated cheese. Then I chop and cook 1/2 a green pepper for 2 minutes in the microwave while waiting for the pepper to cook  I chop 1/2 an onion and 200 grams of  mushrooms . When the pepper is cooked (I add it to a hot frying pan to get the moisture out)  do the same for the onion, then again for the mushrooms (microwave for 2 minutes each). The mushrooms especially need to have the moisture removed. Then put the veggies on top of the cheese and follow the said directions. 35 minutes is almost always perfect. With a few changes the the fat content of this recipe I make it every week when I'm on a diet. I have found that you can reduce the cheese by 1/2 but don't change the amount of butter. This makes a great diet supper with a salad, and  one eighth of this makes a low cal satisfying snack in the evening  when you feel like snacking.

This is hard to remove from the casserole without a crust but has a nice lighter flavour without it.

This is about the 8th time I have made it.  I just love it!  I add broccoli.  It has such a good flavor.  I usually bake it 5 to 10 minutes longer than it says.

It was a super easy recipe, but the flour all sank to the bottom, which made it taste doughy and bland. Won't make it again.

I've made this recipe quite a few times now,  tweaking it a bit more each time, until I've found the perfect blend! It's a great quiche recipe for us low-carbers and paleos out there. 
First off, with the bacon fat still in the pan after frying the bacon, I used that to cook the onions rather than tossing them in raw, which gives it a much nicer flavor;  Also, instead of using white flour - a no-no for low carb dieters - I substituted 3 Tbsp. of carb-friendly coconut flour instead;  Then, instead of 4 whole eggs, I used 2 eggs plus 1/2 C. liquid egg whites;  I also completely eliminated both the butter and the salt, since all that bacon adds plenty of fat and saltiness already!   Lastly, I tossed in a  traditional pinch of nutmeg.  It comes out fantastic, and hasn't once yet reached the "leftover stage" at our house.  As we NY'ers say, "we glom it up".

Note that in this recipe, you can use just about any flavorful shredded cheese variety that will melt (avoid mozzarella though...too bland).  And do let the quiche rest for at least 30 mins. after cooking, for better slicing and flavor.  Delicious!

loved this recipe!  I changed out the bacon for bits of ham, added asparagus, garlic, tomato, pesto, and black pepper.  Loved the consistency of this recipe.  I had to bake it for an additional 15 minutes (probably because I added so much stuff).  Great for a quick dinner that needs to get pulled together

Really good...and super easy. I love that I can use what I have on hand (chopped ham instead of bacon). I have also made this the day before and reheated it the next day. Full of protein and good carbs.

We loved this recipe it was soo good.  I altered it a little I sauted brocolli and onion and used a 3 cheese blend instead of swiss and also added some honey turkey lunch meat with the cooked turkey bacon. This would be perfect for an Easter breakfast!  Thanks for posting the recipe!

Amazing, even without the bacon! I just used what I had in the fridge and added broccoli and carrots, threw in some sour cream that was about to go bad, and had mozz cheese. It was gone in 10 minutes! My brother did break out a fake Irish accent and said "this would be soo good sprinkled with a little bacon."

I used leftover chicken with onions and carrot, and provolone cheese instead of Swiss. Turned out great! A bit flat, but I was too hungry to wait 10 more minutes. Great recipe!

Followed recipe exactly.  This is a very good quiche and I didn't even miss the crust.  Served with a nice green salad it made a wonderful Sunday night supper.  It would probably good with cheddar cheese too.

I made it with tomato basil goat cheese, ham, red peppers, onions and a little pepper jack cheese near the top.  It was great!  My husband and I ate the entire dish before dinnertime.  Next time, I'll follow another recommendation to cook the veggies slightly before adding. They were very crunchy.

Fantastic after a long day. I omitted the bacon, and used dried minced onion because I was in a hurry. Wonderful flavor. Thanks for this little gem :) Update: Made this again, using the bacon and subbing green onion for regular. Found it a bit too salty with the bacon added, otherwise, still delicious.

I have had this recipe for years.  A couple tips.  Put anything you like in it.  After I have my "toppings" chopped up, put them in a ziplock bag and add a 1/2 cup of SELF RISING flour and shake to coat the "toppings". Next mix all you wet ingredients (eggs, butter, milk) and add them to dry ingredients.  Salt and Pepper to taste.  Spray the bottom of pan with Pam and add the mixture.  Bake at 400 for 45 minutes.

Extremely easy to make, and very quick--name says it all.  I made this for a breakfast meeting and it was gone by the time the meeting was over.  I didn't have shredded Swiss so greased my quiche pan very well and laid out slices of Swiss cheese then went from there.  I didn't really adjust otherwise, but I did broil for about 2 minutes after baking according to suggestions, and it did make it brown a little better.  An easy way to make quiche when I don't have a lot of time.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very nice recipe. I have always used the Impossible Bacon Pie recipe from bisquick. I like this one better. I did add 1/2 tsp baking powder and used 1/2n1/2 instead of plain milk. It came out great!

Very good recipe, HOWEVER... I agree with some of the reviews that spoke about the cooking time for this Quiche. The Quiche did not set in the middle with a 35 minute cooking time, I had to cook it for an extra 15 minutes. Overall, it is a tasty quick recipe. I used triple cheddar cheese instead of swiss, and because I have eliminated white flour from my pantry (due to a wheat/whey allergy), I used coconut flour instead. I have used this recipe with both flours and they both need that extra 10-15 mins of cooking time. I also added 2 more eggs for a total of 6. I added baby sweet red and orange bell peppers, chives, and mushrooms as well. Very yummy Quiche, and a great low carb or gluten free option for those who can't do crust. Thanks for sharing!

This is great. I sauteed fresh zucchini and onion, then mixed that in with the egg mixture. I also eliminated the butter, as others suggested, and changed the flour to reduced-fat Bisquick, also as others suggested. It came out great.

I just made this today (5/4/14)and it was really good. I added a blend of swiss and sharp cheddar,spinach,mushrooms, and black pepper. I think I would omit the salt next time and maybe add 1/4 cup less milk. It was plenty salty with the bacon. The center seemed to need more time to cook than the edges, but I didn't want it to get too brown, for this reason I'd add less milk next time. The next time I make it I'm sure I would give it 5 stars.

Since we are gluten free and all organic house, I replaced wheat flour with almond flour, added spinach, feta cheese instead of swiss and topped it with tomatoes. It was very yummy and quick!

This recipe is awesome!  I have made it as is, and have switched it up a bit for my diet restrictions.  Using 2% milk and leaving out the butter with turkey sausage is yummy!  I have to say my favorite is using shrimp with broccoli and cauliflower!  No matter which one I make, my husband devours it!  The possibilities are endless!   Thank you so much for sharing!

This was great my wife, mother in law and daughter lived it. The only thing I did was cook the onions in the bacon grease until done mixed it all up.

Used the basic recipe minus the butter for items I had on had which included turkey sausage, onion, pepper jack cheese, chopped chiles and green chile salsa.  

I only seasoned with black pepper and did not need any salt.  I also topped with sliced fresh tomatoes and it looks oh so pretty.  Great recipe.  One more thing.  

I like the plain flour MUCH BETTER than Biscuit!

I never made any kind of quiche before.  I have had it but never made it.  I kinda prefer stuff like this without the crust so the recipe was right up my ally.  I didn't have bacon so I used sausage.  After reading a couple reviews I scaled salt a lot to like 1/4 teaspoon if that.  I used not quite 1/4 of onion.  So, not too oniony like another reviewer said.  I used a 9 in. round baking pan to cook it in cause my pie pan was too small.  This recipe would be ideal for a deep dish I think.  After baking it for 35 minutes it wasn't very brown at all and decided to put it back in for another 10 minutes.  Perfect!  I did add more cheese to the top to melt it too cause we love cheese around here.  Will make again with spinach and bacon next time!  Thank you!

Very good the only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it took 50 mins to cook in an augratin dish at 350.  Next time, I'll try a cast iron pan - it did need a mixer to blend and I also added spinach.

My husband HATES Quiche....I made this recipe as is...he took a large second helping and said," make this again"..I absolutely wiil.I would use 1/4 tsp salt as I substituted Compte cheese(a nice and less expensive sub for Gruyiere which we like)and is salty.
Also I used only 6 slices of Bacon having used thick cut Vermont Bacon also salted.
All that aside thank you so much for an easy,attractive and delicious  Brunch.Mimi.P.S I also added 1/4 c.cooked fresh spinach.did I say that I didn't change the recipe ..sorry Myrite (-:

I like the idea of no crust. Another thing I like about this recipe is the possible variations. I used pepper jack cheese and mozzarella because it's what I had. I used a combination of fat free half and half and skim milk, again because it's what I had. And I added fresh spinach. Still very good.

I really appreciated finding this recipe. I cannot handle salt so I left it out (the bacon and cheese have enough salt so it was not missed). I added sauteed spinach and mushrooms, and replaced the butter with olive oil. My cooking time was about 12 minutes longer which may have been due to using 1% milk rather than whole milk, as well as the added veggies, but that's a minor thing. Thanks for the great solution to avoiding a crust!

I REALLY like this quick quiche!  It was fast easy and you can use whatever you have in the fridge or pantry to make it "your own".  I used turkey bacon, then sauteed the onion in the turkey bacon pan for about 4 minutes.  I added tomatoes, green chiles, gruyere cheese and pepper jack.  It would have been good with anything in it that you like.  I think the green chiles added alot.  Next time I am going to add a Tablespoon of dijon mustard...it was missing just a tiny bit of tang.  Thanks for this easy recipe - I really did not miss the crust that goes along with traditional quiche.

DELICIOUS! threw some spinach in that i needed to get rid of soon, tasted great. seems like the kind of recipe that's flexible enough to add whatever you've got lying around - mushrooms or other things you're wanting to use up.

Super Easy!!! I made it with sausage instead of bacon. I was really afraid that it was going to stick (like one of the reviewer's comments), but it did not stick at all!!! I would reduce the amount of salt a little bit next time since it was a little salty. Also, it took about 1 hour to cook (instead of 35 minutes). At 35 minutes, I looked through the glass door of the oven, and only one side of the quiche was just beginning to rise. So I waited and kept on checking. Total was about 60 minutes. All of it rose nicely and some of the top was browned. Afterwards, it deflated quickly when it came out of the oven. But that didn't affect the taste. It was yummy and quick. Definitely will make again with variation of fillings.

Love this recipe because substitution still makes it easy and delicious!  

Didn't have Swiss so used Colby Jack, added a can of diced tomatoes and instead of all purpose flour, I used Bisquick.  Came out delicious.  The bisquick kind of makes a crust at the bottom.  Really good and super easy!

My kids love this!!  When they asked what quiche was, I told them it was egg pie.  They ask for egg pie all the time now.  My oldest says it fills his stomach with happiness :)  The only change I made was not adding the bacon since we don't eat pork.  Quick and easy for any meal.  My husband loves it for breakfast when he has to leave for work early.  This has become a staple in our house.

This is the best quiche I've ever had! Far better than any restaurant or pre-made. Super easy too. Even my husband who refuses to eat breakfast food said it was delicious and ate 2 slices. I made it exactly as written with no changes. Thanks so much!

This was really easy to make and actually quite tasty.
I needed to make it ahead for a camping trip. It still tasted great but I think it would taste even better served immediately.  I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9x13 pan.  I cooked it for 50 minutes and it came out just right.  I also added broccoli, red pepper and sauted them with the sweet onion prior to adding to the egg mixture.  I didn't double the salt, butter or milk because of other reviews, but think next time I will just to see the difference.  Although really good, I think it lacked just a little something and felt I should have followed the recipe more.  I will make this again.

This was easy and good. I cheated and used bacon bits (the real bacon pieces) that were in the cabinet.  I did have to cook it an additonal 15 minutes for it to set.

This is excellent, and does exactly what it is supposed to do. I did have to bake it for longer than the stated time, however. Even children who do not usually eat quiche ate this, and there is not a crumb left over. I am looking forward to making this again in the near future.

Even though I had pie crust, I loved the idea of using cheese and bacon. I used store bought bacon pieces and layed them first and then shredded cheese on top, figured it would be less messy when cleaning up. I cooked celery, tomatoe, onion and yellow papper before hand and shredded a carrot, as well as used some leftover ham. i crumbled cheddar cheese to mix in with the eggs, and used a salsa cheese for the crust. My brother who usually doesn't like quiche was forced to try it, and even took seconds!!

My husband isn't crazy about quiche - you know, it's "girlie food".   After munching down 3/4 of the quiche (only because I took our 1/4 for myself)  he said, "If this is a quiche, you can make it ANYTIME!"    I'm making it tonite, adding broccoli because I have leftovers, and american cheese.

This was simply delicious!  I made it for my boyfriend and myself for supper tonight.  I used bisquick instead of the flour and used turkey bacon for a healthier alternative.  Love!

This was my first quiche and it turned out great! I altered it a bit, adding mushrooms and spinach and using turkey sausage instead of bacon and bisquick instead of flour. It cooked about 7 minutes longer due to the glass pie dish. Will definitely make again!

Great recipe.  I made it for lunch with a nice garden salad.  I followed the recipe but added ham and a defrosted box of chopped spinach.  My cousin came over for lunch loved it!  it was her first time eating quiche.

Very good!  You could add almost anything to this!  I added mushrooms and fresh broccoli.  I didn't have any Swiss cheese so I used Mozzarella and it was still delicious!

This quiche was delicious and extremely easy to make.  First time I made a crustless quiche and there are so many different ways to tweek this recipe.  Needless to say, the hubs and I both enjoyed tonight's dinner tremendously.  Thanks for sharing.

My family and I really enjoyed this quiche recipe. I tweaked it a little bit. I added 1 tsp dried parsley and 1/4 tsp thyme. I also 1/2 of a bag of frozen broccoli, thawed.

EASY and very tasty, my husband loved this and said he liked this recipe the best.  I have wasted so much time making homemade crust!  I did have to bake it for 40 minutes though because the middle wasn't quite set at 35min.

This was great! Even picky teenagers liked it. I even messed up and realized half way thru pouring egg into pan I forgot to add the flour. Whisked it in the remaining egg/milk and poured it in; it turned out great. I did have trouble with it sticking to the pan even though I greased it. ???? This will be a great busy night dinner also.

Excellent, easy, cost-effective meal. I added a handful of baby spinach and served it for dinner. Husband and daughter thought it could use more bacon... I thought it could us more veggies... but it satisfied everyone at the table which is rare for us these days as we're on a strict food budget.

I couldn't believe how tasty this was, having no crust, and modifying the heck out of it. I layered slices of Tillamook cheddar cheese on the bottom, and added broccoli, mushrooms, tomatoes, and green pepper. I left out the butter, since the bacon was present, and didn't grease the pan either. The result? A VERY rich, decadent breakfast. And the glass dish I used cleaned up quite nicely too.

This recipe indeed was quick, but our tastebuds found it bland--the flour just didn't do anything for it. Compared to other just-as-quick familly favorite egg recipes, this was a zero. Sorry!

I made this as a make-ahead breakfast I could reheat quickly and eat before heading off to work. As one reviewer did, I multiplied the ingredients by 1.5 and baked them in a 9 x 13 pan. I also included 1 head fresh broccoli and a red bell pepper to get some more vegetabley goodness in there. Even my 1-year-old who dislikes broccoli will eat this!

This is quite yummy...I used low fat mozzarella instead of Swiss, turkey bacon and also added 1/2 cup of thawed chopped spinach squeezed dry. What a nutritious breakfast! I considered doing a Mexican quiche, with salsa and reduced fat mexican blend cheese...maybe next time.

I followed this recipe essentially. I had jalapeno jack so I used that and doubled the amount. Very good. It setup nicely and made a nice crust on the bottom. Thank you.

This was a great quick meal!  I followed others reviews and cooked the onions slightly in some of the bacon drippings and added a bit more bacon and used a mexican blend of cheese since thats what I had on hand.  I've already passed this recipe along for others to make and will definitely be making this again.

Very good recipe. Will make this again.  I didn't have the Swiss Cheese, so I added mild cheddar, and I added a small zucchini.  Great basic recipe that can be made in so many different ways.

This was a great recipe, my husband and I had just been talking about making a quiche but didnt want to go through all the time making a crust. I did add a little shredded cheddar to the bottom of the pie pan and threw in a little chopped spinach and some diced ham! It was delicious and will definately be making this again.

I made this for a family of picky eaters and kids and it was a total hit! I made it a second time with just shredded lunch ham and about 1 1/2 cup of onions with  about 6 -8 ounces of Cheddar cheese and it tasted wonderful. I am making this again tomorrow, because it was so good and family friendly!

I use turkey bacon.  Today I did not have shredded cheese so I cubed some and mixed it in the egg mixture along with the bacon---worked wonderfully in my opinion.  I also added an extra egg and more onion for flavor.  I always use plain soy milk.  Easy, simple, and good.

This quiche turned out 'just okay' for me. Yes, it tasted good but was it something amazing? No. The bacon takes a lot of time to prep and other than that, I don't see the difference between this quiche recipe and others on this site. For myself, I added sweet potatoes, which I blanched beforehand- just to add some dimension to the dish. Don't know if I will use this recipe again. Thanks tho.

I gave this 4 stars because it needed more salt and next time, I would add the cheese after it was done cooking. Also, because I used a glass pan instead of a metal one, it took me more than an hour on 350 to get it set and cooked completely.  Other than that, great recipe and quick and easy idea when you dont have time to make a crust. ?

The perfect, easy brunch dish- yum!  I made three versions for a brunch and received rave reviews from everyone!  A ham and gruyere version was the favorite!

Great, easy recipe.  First time making quiche, but I doubled the recipe.  Turned out excellent - both were devoured by my teenage boys and husband.  This will be a steady rotation now that the hens are laying!

Very good.  I did have to cook 10 minutes more to set middle.  And next time I will not add the salt; it was a bit salty for my  taste.  Overall, this recipe is yummy, and I will make it tons in the future.

I  used a store-bought pie crust for a traditional quiche. A word of caution: be careful of how much extra you "add-in" because you will have too much filling which will spill out over the top if you aren't careful! I added a little broccoli and found out the hard way. Also-don't forget salt and pepper. This is a great basic recipe and my husband and I loved it. Plan to try again with different "add-ins".

This is your basic quiche. I made it my own by using: diced shrimp, garlic, scallions, feta, & roasted red peppers. I also added 2 more eggs & it still didn't rise all the way to the top of the crust.

Wonderful crustless quiche and easy to adapt. I made this for an office brunch and it was the first thing to go. I used cheddar instead of swiss and added some finely chopped broccoli. It was heavenly!

Thought this was an excellent and easy quiche recipe. Its been years since I made a quiche so I can't remember of flour goes in the filling, but I didn't miss the crust at all because of the flour in it. The flour sunk to the bottom and formed its own crust. I also used whole wheat flour to make it a little healthier. I made ham, broccoli, cheddar, doubled the recipe and threw one in the freezer for later. Am definitely looking forward to eating this again at a later date.

Don't leave the butter out.  Yes its more fat, but if you do, your crust will taste like uncooked flour.

So so easy and versitle.  You can add so many different things to change it up.  I add broccoli or spinach and use any cheese I have handy.  I also love this recipe because I usually carry all ingredients so everything is usually on hand.

Wonderful!!! I doubled the recipe and put in a 9x13 pan. I cooked the bacon and shredded the cheese the night before, then did the rest in the morning. It cooked for longer than the time stated - probably double the time. I used cheddar for swiss; added broccoli and mushrooms, used about 2 slices less bacon. Even the leftovers were great!

I would prefer that the egg be denser; I'll probably try less milk next time. Otherwise, this recipe is a good base for Quiche.

This was tasty and easy.  I didn't pay attention to the pan size and ended up using my 8-in. pie plate instead.  I increased the baking time by 10 minutes and it was perfect.  Can't wait to try it again with other veggies and cheeses!

Such a nice, easy recipe!  I used cheddar cheese and added mushrooms and fresh spinach.  It heated up really well in the microwave.  Like some of the other reviewers mentioned, I think I will cut the butter (or at least reduce it) from the recipe next time.  It was a little bit too rich and oily with it.

We thought this was pretty good.  I'm not sure if it is supposed to do this or not, but my flour sunk to the bottom and formed a sort of gummy crust between the bacon pieces...that's why its not a 5 star (we like crunchier crusts).  Also, if your quiche isn't done when you pull it out (mine tricked me) then pop it in the microwave for a few minutes!

Best recipe yet from your site! What a hit at the potluck! My changes to the recipe included: I used half Swiss and half English Coastal Chedder, sauted the onions & about 1/4 cup of a red pepper sliced in small ribbons--added cooked broccoli from the night before. I spread these ingredients in a layer over the bacon & cheese as someone said their ingredients migrated to the edges. I used no salt. Recipe cooked in exactly 35 minutes. I decorated top with a sprig of fresh basil. Thanks for an easy, versatile recipe that tastes delicious! Marcie Hines

My picky husband and I absolutely loved this.  I took another reviewer's tip and let it bake in my glass pie plate 45 minutes and it was PERFECT!  I also used very lowfat ingredients including 1/2 cup Hormel real bacon bits, 1 cup Eggbeaters, & 3 oz of 50% reduced fat swiss cheese.  It was still awesome and the texture was perfect.  I hadn't thought about making a quiche without the crust but this certainly has changed my mind!  Thank you so much for the recipe.

I used mozarella/provolone with turkey bacon; and I used what I had on hand to fill it, which turned out to be red bell pepper, broccoli, carrots, and fresh rosemary. I really think the rosemary enhanced the flavor and made the dish! Anyways it's a great recipe, great base, will be adding this to my regular recipes! Thanks!

Simple, fast and tasty! It's foolproof too.  I made it for my neighbours and the wife, who is a petite, small eater, kept helping herself to seconds and thirds.  I think I'll make two of these at a time in the future; the first one barely fed us.  Thank goodness I had other food on the table.  I added sauteed red peppers for a little colour and I think I'm going to add some sauteed mushrooms and more onions as well.  Thanks for the terrific recipe!

I made this quiche for a potluck and it was a big hit!  I added spinach and a bit of dried parsley. I used turkey bacon and nobody could tell that it wasn't regular bacon.  I also added some slices of tomato at the top, which make it look nice and also add extra flavor.  My friends begged me to make it again, so I am making it for our next potluck!

This was a pretty good and very quick recipe.  It was definitely a good way to use my extra eggs and it was nice not having to make a crust or use a store-bought one.  I added broccoli and mushrooms and sautéed them along with the onion.  I used turkey bacon and some salad-type bacon pieces, and also used mostly mozzarella cheese with a bit of a Mexican cheese blend.  Next time, I might add a little more bacon and cheese since this didn’t have quite as much flavor as I would have liked.  I omitted the butter, however, so that probably reduced the flavor; I’ll leave that it next time, too.

This is an awesome recipe!  I made this for a brunch for a dozen people and EVERYONE raved about it.  I made it in a frozen deep dish pie crust and substituted scallions for the onions to add a little color.  I also used cheddar because I didn't have any swiss on hand.  It came out perfect.

I made two, one with Sausage, Moz chesse, green onion, mushrooms and pancake mix instead of flour. The other had bacon, red peppers, mushroom, jack cheese and flour. I like the bacon one better, but I think it is because bacon brought more flavor then sausage. All in all it was a great recipe.

This was fabulous!  Easy, quick and delicious - my family devoured it. I used ham instead of bacon, cheddar and mozzarella instead of swiss, and added some broccoli - mainly because I didn't have some of the original ingredients listed. As other viewers suggested, I used pancake mix instead of flour.  Next time, I will try it with bacon and swiss, and also cut the salt down to 1/2 teaspoon.  Even tho it didn't require a crust, when it was done, it seemed as tho it HAD a crust - somehow the pancake mix/flour sank to the bottom and automatically formed a crust.  Magical!!!

I just made this for lunch for my husband and myself and we both LOVE it!  It was so fast and easy to put together and tastes so yummy!  I will definitely be making this again and again and again.  I did saute the onions a couple minutes before adding them, as was suggested by others.

THEY ATE THE WHOLE THING! My goodness, this was a great idea! I used buttermilk complete pancake mix instead of flour and added broccoli minus butter. Next time, figure friendly with low-fat cheese, whole wheat pancake mix, 2% milk and ff ham or turkey bacon. This is my new [fast] quiche.

Holy cow this quiche is awesome! Whenever I try a new recipe from allrecipes.com, I ask my husband to rate it on a 5-star scale. He gave this one an 11. A few adjustments I made - I used elk summer sausage instead of bacon because that's what I had. I also threw in some canned drained mushrooms and chopped bell pepper. Another time I made it, I threw in broccoli, which was good too, but I liked the mushroom/pepper combo better. Thank you thank you thank you for this awesome, quick, flexible, nutritious recipe!

Wonderful basic recipe for quiche.  I have also added vegetables and it is still great.  Try using turkey bacon or ham instead of bacon, or use a different kind of cheese (cheddar, provolone, colby, etc.).  I usually skip the butter and put a little more cheese on top (about 5-10 minutes before it si finished).  This is also a great "make it the night before" recipe for a holiday brunch - just heat it up in the microwave the next morning (remember to use a microwave-safe dish).

We substituted ham for bacon and added some spinach.  The second time around we prepared it in a premade crust.  Fabulous both times.

I actually forgot to add the Swiss Cheese and this came out wonderfully. It was moist and light. I made it the day before, under cooked it, by 5 min.  When heating it the next day I used a 350 degree oven for 30 min.  Next time I'll make two.

Excellent quiche -- and so versatile.  I made one as described in the recipe and one with chicken and asparagus.  They puffed up dramatically in the oven, and were great when it was ime to eat them.  This is a delicious, easy, versatile recipe and one I will use many times.

With modifications this is a 5 star recipe.  I eliminated the butter & bacon and used dried onions instead of fresh...much easier.  I also added steamed broccoli on top of the cheese (used mozarella since that's what I had) and added 1/4 tsp dried mustard & 1/8 tsp white pepper.  It was fantastic!

This recipe really is quick and easy!  I made it this morning with ham, sharp chedder, and broccoli.  It could use more seasoning, I'm usually light on the seasoning anyway.  I used salt, garlic salt, and pepper.

This was quick and easy. I added a few ingredients, some suggested by the author. I think this woudl be a five if there were more seasonings. I added chilli powder, garlic, etc., but I think even an adobo sauce or maybe even something like saffron. The bacon really did add good flavor- I would just suggest to add to it. In addition, I added cheese (grated parmesean) to the batter and a jack/cheddar mix (shredded) on top.

So good, and best of all, very very easy.  I thought it was a bit too salty, but apparently I was the only one who thought so out of all my coworkers who had some.  Excellent recipe!  I will be making this again and again.  (I did use a four cheese blend instead of the swiss since I didn't have any, and it was wonderful; I'm sure it would be good with any cheese you like.)

Good recipe and very quick and easy.  I sauted onions, green pepper and fresh mushrooms in a bit of butter to add to the egg mixture and omitted the bacon.  I placed grated old cheddar on the bottom of the pie plate and poured the mixture over which turned out great.  My only tip - to avoid lumps when you add the flour, stir half the flour with half the milk in a separate cup to create a smooth paste, add that to the egg mixture and stir, then repeat with the remaining flour and milk.

Fantastic base batter to use with any filling I have handy.  I save a lot of calories over using a pie crust.  I like putting my shredded cheese on top in the last ten minutes of baking to give it a good crusty texture.

I made this recently and my family loved it!  I used a frozen pie crust, cut the flour in half and added a little extra swiss and it turned out marvelous. It did take a little more time to cook than the recipe called for, but I will definitely be making this again.  Oh, and after cooking a huge variety of meals for my family the last 21 years, this was my very first time making quiche!

I thought this was great! The only thing I changed is I added mushrooms and sauteed the mushrooms and onions before adding them to the dish, did NOT use the bacon, used a Mexican cheese blend and used 1/2 cup of Wheat/Honey pancake mix instead of flour.  Turned out amazing!

LOVE this recipe!  I've made it so many times for friends and family and always get raving reviews and repeat requests.  My funniest compliment came from a friend who said:

"This is better than McDonald's!" 

Doesn't sound like a compliment, right?  The thing is that this friend L-O-V-E-S McDonald's breakfast.  Seriously.  His wife quickly piped in, "Oh!  That's a compliment!  That's a HUGE compliment!" ha! :)

Super simple and delicious.  I made this for a neighborhood brunch and it disappeared and tons of people asked me for the recipe.  I agree the salt is a bit to much.  I use half the amount and it is great (and I like salt).  I've also used ready made frozen crusts and it works great.  Usually just need to increase the baking time by 10 minutes or so.  This has become a dinner favorite.  Add a green salad and dinner is done!  Enjoy!

I put everything in a rectangular Pyrex dish last night and plopped it in the oven this morning.  It took about an hour to bake since it was in the fridge all night.  I had about 2/3 of a pound of bacon that I cooked and crumbled used shredded cheddar and freshly grated parmesan.  Stirred everything up and put more of both cheeses on the top about 10 minutes before it was done.  It turned out delicious if I do say so myself!!!

This is a delicious, quick and easy meal.  I love that I can throw it together quickly with ingredients I have on hand.  I have found that I need to increase the cooking time to about 50 minutes for it to fully set.  My whole family loves this, and asks for it regularly.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent taste! I sauteed the onions along with the bacon, and I whirled the remaining ingredients in the blender before pouring into the plate, but otherwise I made it exactly as written. There's no way that this would have been done after 30 minutes, though - when I checked at that time the top was just barely beginning to form a crust and everything underneath was still liquid. I cooked mine in a glass pie plate, and it took around 65 minutes at 350 to be properly set (I only opened the oven to check that one time after 30 minutes, so it's not like I was letting hot air out by checking frequently). Even after whirling in the blender the cheese still formed a bit of a crust on the bottom of the plate, but nothing that a regular fork couldn't cut through. I didn't miss the crust at all, and this will definitely be my go-to quiche recipe from now on. Thanks!

I have made many quiches and none of them have ever turned out.  This was by far the easiest one to make and the best tasting.  I didn't have Swiss cheese so I used Monterey Jack cheese.  My kids and husband and our small group all really liked it.

YUM! I just realized I only used about half the recipe of bacon. I was going to half the recipe then changed my mind... I like leftovers. Forgot to up the bacon though. It was great with just the 4 pieces though :) Only other minor tweaks were using cheddar cheese because it's what I had and threw in some chopped parsley to use it up from another recipe. I took the advice of another and blended the mixture, super fast! I used a metal pie pan and baked the 35 minutes... would probably bake another 2 minutes or so next time. YUM!!! I impressed myself =)

Easy and very good. The consistency of it was good, not drippy and it is good that there is not too much cheese. I did 2 of the 4 eggs using only the whites and used mostly skim for the milk. I omitted the bacon and did broccoli and mushrooms. Even with all the changes it was really good.

YUMMY!! Only thing i did different was saute the onions before putting them in, and i had to cook a lot longer than the recipe specified but it was definately worth the wait, can't wait to make again and again trying new fillings!

Darn! I really wanted to give this 5 stars like so many others, but something must have gone way wrong with our version because it just didn't taste like or have the consistency of quiche. I'm vegetarian so omitted the bacon, but otherwise followed to the letter and got a bottom crust of cheese that turned too hard to cut as soon as it was out of the oven, and the eggs were a bit rubbery and just tasted like eggs. 

On a more positive note, I did find pieces of this made for a decent egg sandwich the next day.

This is the first time I've attempted to make ANY kind of Quiche and IT WAS EASY! Great tasting and my guests loved it. We made two, one with and one without bacon and they were both great.

Highly recommended!!

Totally worth 5 stars because it's quick, easy, delicious, and very easy to adjust to personal likes. Didn't have bacon; sauteed Italian sausage instead...worked great. Also sauteed the onions...worked great. I only had non-fat milk and a bit of heavy cream...worked great, but next time I'd use half-and-half or whole milk. Loved not having to buy/make a crust. Didn't miss it at all. Used my square cast iron skillet...worked great. Broiled it for a few minutes for that crusty flavor. Yum. Would definitely make it again...already thinking of what to add next time. Thanks for sharing this one!

I REALLY loved this quiche. I lightened it up by using turkey bacon, Egg Beaters, and low-fat mozzarella cheese since I didn't have any Swiss. It was super easy to make and it came out brown and delicious! I used a foil pie plate and 35 mins was just enough time.

So easy and very tasty.  Made 12 mini quiche using muffin pan instead of pie plate.  Cooked approx. 20 at same temp.  So good and really portable.
Made second batch and replaced bacon with spinach and asparagus. I loved these.

This was so good, and so easy. I've made it at least 5 times in the last month, a few times for dinner, a brunch, to a potluck, and for a friend after having surgery. Each time I've used the ingredients I've had on hand and it's been delicious. My favorite so far is bacon and parmesan crust, with broccoli, onion and pureed green beans (originally intended for my baby) and parm on the top. Yum!

Very good.  The self-making crust was nice.  I used a little less onion than the recipe calls for, since my wife is not a fan of them.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written.  Everyone who tried it loved it.  Next time I will try some broccoli or spinach.

Great quiche.  I like it simple with two or three ingredients max.  It's a bit too much to pack more in.

Thanks for such an easy and delicious recipe! The cheese and bacon on the bottom acted as a crust, which was nice since I was a little afraid this would just fall apart with out using the traditional pie crust. I served this for brunch with a fruit salad, my family ate it up!

Good, fast recipe!  To save even more time save leftover bacon from another meal and use it on the quiche.

This turned out really well. I also took out 1/4 cup milk and added some broccoli and green pepper. I actually wouldn't put broccoli in it again, though, because it didn't add anything to the dish. I used turkey bacon instead of regular bacon and it turned out pretty good as well! (Maybe try microwaving the bacon instead of cooking on the stove. It took a long time for me.) I cooked the onion a bit in the pan once the bacon was good and that helped. Finally I also used 6 oz cheese and it was good!

I liked the texture of this quiche and the fact that the flour settled to the bottom of the pan and made a crust of it's own.  I would suggest, if using bacon, cut back or omit the butter and salt, it seemed too greasy on the plate and I don't think the added salt is needed with already salty bacon.  I used a 10" glass pan and cooked 10 extra minutes to be done.  Overall, a nice simple quiche that I will alter a bit next time to my tastes.

I've tried other quiche recipes and this one is just OK. It didn't have enough substance to it and tasted like an egg fritatta. If I'm not using a pie crust, we prefer the texture of the recipe using pancake mix.

This is delicious! I had to bake it for about 50 minutes so that the quiche was set and slightly golden. I recommend using only 1/2 teaspoon salt if your bacon is pretty salty. I can't wait to try out other variations with sausage and green peppers!

My guys love this dish.  I prepare it with turkey bacon to make it a little more healthy and the flavor is great.  My family  loves this quiche and it's so easy to make.

So easy and delicious!  Although other reviewers experienced problems with cooking time, my quiche was golden and bubbly at exactly 35 minutes.  I added extra bacon because my family loves it, but I can't wait to experiment with different cheeses and fillings.  This quiche does have a more dense texture than a typical quiche, so don't expect it to be exactly the same.  In fact, my kids thought it was very much like pizza.

Great recipe!  I will not use pans that I would place on a baking sheet.  I thought my sheet pan was a good one, but as it heated up, it "jumped" spilling my egg mixture all over making a burnt mess, twice!  After all that it was a wonderful recipe that I will make again...in glass pie pans.

If it wasn't for this recipe I would have never made quiche! This recipe is easy and it tastes so good. My 12 year old son loves it, as does the rest of the family. You might need to cook it longer than the stated time, but I've never had to broil mine. I make 2 each time using mozzorella cheese and bacon.  Trust me, this recipe is amazing!

This is really good but it took a lot longer to cook then the recipe called for. I ended up having to cook it for over an hour! I ended up using spiced sausage for the meat and sprinkled cheese on top.

This was a recipe I found when I had no idea what to fix for dinner at the last minute. I had all the ingredients on hand and fixed it in no time. I sauteed the onions in olive oil, but followed the recipe exact otherwise, and it was very good. A great recipe to have on hand for a quick and easy dinner....family loved it too!

I made this for my diabetic boyfriend and it was perfect because it's pretty low carb and could be almost carb free if you made it with soy flour but I used regular flour.  He loved it and I even liked it and I hate eggs and swiss cheese.  Froze it to enjoy the left overs later!  Thanks so much!

This is such a simply and very tasty breakfast/brunch dish. My whole family loved it! I only made a couple of changes/additions. I used green onion and added a layer of thinly sliced potatoes I had left from making scalloped potatoes. I also added some cheddar cheese. This is a recipe box keeper!!

I was dying for something else to make one night (so tired of my same standard recipes).  I found this recipe  and whipped it together.  I didn't have any milk so I used 1 c. of half and half and 1/2 cup of water.  I also used the recommendations in the other reviews such as sauté the onions first and cook it longer if it's in the glass pie pan.  I served it up with fresh zucchini bread and sliced water melon.  I can't wait to make it for a family breakfast - it was great, and my family loved it! Thanks for the recipe

Gave this a 3 because I will use the basic egg, milk & flour portions to make quiche again. We decided to use our regular fillings because my husband didn't care much for the broccoli. We usually use smoked sausage, mushroom, onion, sweet peppers. I'm going to check my favorite recipe also for any other spice/herb that I used to use. Parsley is one & I think garlic powder. Like not having a crust & so I like this basic recipe. Need to use a deep dish pie pan if putting in alot of fillings.

It was quick and easy to make!  We tried turkey instead of ham/bacon and Italian cheese instead of Swiss.  Not very good.  Not enough saltiness to flavor the dish.  We'll certainly stick with the ingredient list next time!

This sounds very much like a Frittata, only using fewer eggs. With a Frittata the eggs, 6-8, and flour are beaten together, poured into an ovenproof pan over medium high heat. When the edge of the eggs become firm,scatter your chosen ingredients over the eggs,(the centre should be soft but not runny and do NOT stir), remove from heat, place in a 350 oven till firm (about 10-15 minutes)  How simple is that. It should work with the four eggs called for in this recipe. This makes a filling and satisfying dinner with a salad and rolls or bread.

My husband and I thought this dish was pretty good, and it was very easy to make, but we both thought there was too much bacon for our tastes. The recipe is a good concept, but I think if I were to make it again I would use ham instead and throw in some vegetables to lighten it up.

This is a big hit with my family.  i usuallly double the recipe and put it in a 9x13 pan.  i like to use cooked sausage links instead of bacon and fresh broccoli works very well as an add in.  i usually just shake some salt in, as i found the original recipe makes it very salty.  sometimes less flour is good too, if you don't want it too stiff.  otherwise, great recipe.  thanks for sharing!!!

Excellent recipe - very easy! I did not have bacon and used chopped ham. The egg mix was placed in my blender and I added a cup of brocolli, a dash of nutmeg and roasted minced garlic. Topped the quiche with frozen white sweet corn! Hubby loved it and picky two year old son had two slices! This is a keeper and can not wait to try other variations mentioned from other reviews!

Absolutely Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for. Wanted something similar to my grandmother's recipe, and it was just like I remember. The only change I made was adding some of the bacon to the top to keep it crispy. Thanks so much! Definately a keeper!

Pretty good! I made a few low carb adjustments. 1/2 t. onion powder to replace the onion, 1/4 c. flour instead of 1/2, (worked just fine) & half cream & half water for the milk. I also used Fontina cheese since I had that. This could do with some more spices, & I think 1 t. salt is too much. I also used 8 T. real bacon bits in place of the bacon slices. Took 45-50 minutes to cook. A pretty quiche.

This is an excellent standby meal.  I have made it with ham & cheddar, shrimp & mushrooms, and even a greek version with shrimp, feta, & spinach. All of them were awesome!  This recipe always gets rave reviews.  I even save a bit of fat & use skim milk, but you certainly can't tell the difference.  A very useful recipe!

I added tomatoes and canned lump crab meat to this recipe. (I also used parmesan cheese instead for the crust)  I served it with a side of bacon and a dab of sour cream.  Wonderful!  Also, I refrigerated it over night and just popped it in the oven for 20 minutes in the morning...Quick, easy and delicious! I found the cooking time took a bit longer than what's listed but that might be due to the additional ingredients I added.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful. You can substitute any meat and cheese that you would like. I leave the onion out because it takes over flavor wise. This is a great recipe to experiment with.

This was great! We didn't even miss the crust. I used half the bacon (to be heath-conscious) and we still enjoyed the dish. Definitely a good find!

Great recipe - great without the bother or carbs of making a crust.  I sauteed the onions (out of habit) and it tasted great. Add ins are such a breeze with this recipe - I added mushrooms that I sauteed with the onions - delicious! Will do this one often!

Very good and very easy. I made it with egg substitute (Better'n Eggs I think it's called), without the bacon, with some spinach, and then another time with turkey bacon--all were good. Very adaptable recipe. Good stuff!

I liked it very much.  I added sausage, & broccoli to your recipe.  It worked fine except I got carried away on the amounts of them and so it kinda crumbled when I went to serve it so I'll obey better next time. I used foil to line my pie pan & it helped clean up but it wasn't to easy to dish out the quiche. 
 I'll try something else next time to line the dish. thank you

Great recipe as is, but also lends itself to embellishment to personal tastes well. Depending on what’s on hand, i’ve added fresh mushrooms, baby spinach (cooked and cut up), green pepper, a smidgen of chili powder (it livens up scrambled eggs too, but just a pinch in both cases) and sometimes cut back swiss cheese a bit and replace it with old cheddar.Still it’s great as published here too. So i give it 5 stars

I adapted the recipe by leaving out the bacon and adding veggies. I took advice from previous reviews add subbed the flour for pancake mix. I baked mine in cupcake pan and served them. It turned out great. If you want to serve yours as quiche muffins like I did recommend using silicone liners, cupcake liners or make sure you REALLY grease your pan or you will have a hard time getting them out.

This recipe is not a keeper for me. Even though there is no crust, it wasn’t that much faster. It’s missing vegetables (even though I added in parsley). It’s very heavy on the bacon, and even though I drained the bacon well, it still seemed greasy to me.

Did I round deeper individual dishes instead of pie plate, used one cup of milk and sautéed onions and broccoli first.  Took long to cook.

I followed the recipe, adding a little bit of ham and spinach, but for some reason it took 70 minutes to cook through instead of only 35. It was still liquid at 35 mins. In the end though it tasted very good.

This is a great go-to recipe when you need to make brunch or breakfast ahead of time.  I made this recipe - as written - for Christmas brunch, since we are pressed for time due to travel obligations.  I threw in one bag (12 oz.) of frozen chopped broccoli (after fully microwaving it).  I did not saute the onion, although I was tempted to (doing so is not needed).  I also did not layer the recipe, but mixed it altogether.  I made it the night before, put it in the fridge and microwaved it the next morning.  Easy and tasty.  Recommended!

My family and I love this recipe.  I only make a few changes, and really it is the addition of a few items.  I add chopped maple honey ham (from the deli) and chopped broccoli to the mixture.  Just adds a bit more flavor.  Thanks for posting and sharing as we will use 5his

Used 1/4 cup less milk and put it under the broiler for crisping. Added broccoli and bacon, next time I will try mushrooms. Very good recipe!

Great taste! Added minced garlic and sautéed with onion in bacon grease. Used cheddar because that’s what I had on hand. Topped with shredded Parmesan. Probably won’t add salt next time, but will make again!

I liked the simple recipe, but made couple of changes.  Instead of bacon, I used canned chicken and shrimp.  I also used some veggies - tomato and some peppers.  Here is what I did and it came out really good - kids loved it.

Cook the chicken and shrimp (I cut the shrimp in bit size pieces) with half the onion and half of one jalapeno) with bit of crushed peppers and a pinch of allspice as we like our food spicy.  You can adjust the spice to your need. 

Happy eating!

This is my new go to quiche recipe. No need for a crust and I like the crust! It is so easy to make it your own with different cheese and meat if you want to. It’s a definite keeper.

I have made this several times.  The first time I followed the directions.  Other times I swap out the Swiss for whatever I have on hand.. mozzarella, cheddar, etc.  and swap out the bacon or add to it (turkey sausage, mushrooms, spinach, green peppers, etc.).  It’s always a little different, but the base is the same.  I highly recommend it for a quick and easy meal!

I used a glass pie dish, ham instead of bacon and Monterey Jack instead of Swiss. I had to add about 10-15 minutes of cook time to give the top a little bit of browning and to make sure the eggs were fully cooked in the center. I serve warm right or if there oven instead of traditional quiche that is cooled. My young kids (4 and 6) really love this recipe.

This is a fantastic recipe that is so easily modifiable based on what you have on hand. I took one reviewers tip and used 1 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of plain Greek yogurt (mixing it together before adding the other ingredients. I also used Monterey Jack because it's what I had. I sautéed the sweet onion until caramelized and then threw in a diced red bell pepper. I also used Whole Wheat flour instead of AP for added nutrition, and folded in grape tomatoes sliced in half and a diced small avocado. So basically, this is a great base of ingredients that allows you to use up anything fresh you have on hand to make a great meal! I served mine with hot sauce, my husband had it with toast.

This was so easy to make. Very light and tasty. I made some changes based on what I had in the fridge. I went with a combo of Swiss,Provolone and garlic herb Jack cheese. Then I added left over baked ham and broccoli lightly fried with garlic (also left over from a previous dish). I used half milk and half heavy whipping cream ( left over from a previous dish) I went with pancake batter instead of flour and add shredded Cheddar cheese on top after the egg mixture. Will be making this often-I love using leftovers to make a new meal

This was great! I only had cheddar (probably would've been better with swiss).  One significantly change: I did not add salt; one comment mentioned the flavor was too salty, and I realized the cheese and butter already had salt.  I did not add the bacon, as I avoid swine.  The flavor was not bland at all!  And it took 40 minutes to completely set in the oven.

The family loved it! I was afraid it would be too bland or them without some herbs or spices, but the blend of bacon and swiss cheese added a good amount of flavor. There was nothing left at the end of the meal!

You can make this recipe according to the directions or you can change it to whatever you have available. Instead of bacon, leftover chicken or a tin of tuna, ham, beef or anything else you have available can be used. This is really a versatile recipe and it takes just a few minutes to assemble. I also like to add fried mushrooms or green bell peppers, actually any cooked vegetables like peas, green beans potatoes.  Cheddar cheese with sliced tomatoes on top is also a nice addition.

So good and easy. I only had 5 pieces of bacon, so I used that. I had about 5 ounces of Swiss and so that made up for the bacon. I chopped up onion, green pepper, and mushrooms and sauteed it before adding it to the egg mixture. It took an additional 5-10 minutes to bake.

It was easy and quick to make, and tasted great. I added dried thyme, and avocado. I ended up using Havarti cheese instead of Swiss cheese. I’ll be making this again in the future.

Worked great.

Mods: Added mix of sausage, bell peppers and onions in place of the bacon (didn't have).  Sure original would be as delicious.

My family loves this with the changes I made. I added 1 tsp. Italian seasoning, 1 tsp. yellow mustard, 1/4 c. ground pepper, and about 3/4 c. chopped broccoli or asparagus. Also, when I have time, I saute the onions in the butter. Sometimes I add celery to the onions. Instead of the bacon, I add chopped ham and/or Canadian bacon. I sprinkle the top with grated Parmesan cheese and a little chili powder, too.  Experiment with foods and seasonings you like and enjoy!

Absolutely amazing quiche it was fluffy and delicious. I love making this quiche, it's super easy. 1 teaspoon of salt came out way too salty. Second time I made it I put much less salt and it was perfect.

Very easy to prepare. I reduced crumbled bacon strips to 6 & the result still carried a full bacon flavor. The cheese melted on the bottom to create a firm bottom "crust". I also used a scallion which gave the quiche a nice edge/finish to the bacon.

The 35 minute bake provided a near perfect consistency after allowing the Pyrex pie pan to sit/set for 5 to 7 minutes.

This recipe is a keeper.

Suuuuuper yummy! My family and I loved this recipe. To be honest I didn’t expect much. But holy cow it was so yummy. I substituted sharp shredded cheddar and it was amazing. I also only used egg whites. I used six egg whites to be exact. And it turned out perfect! I found this on a whim so it wasn’t planned at all.  Next time I’ll have Swiss ready.

Amazing recipe. Like said in the video you can add anything you want in there and it will be amazing. I substituted shredded cheddar to American cheese just because I got some at the deli. I simulated shredded cheese by cutting American deli into little pieces. Came out beautiful

Delicious, quick and easy. I did add broccoli. I sautéed the onions and broccoli for just a minute or two in the butter before I mixed it all together. Perfection!

It was good. The whole family loved it. I used a combination of onions and peppers to add a little flavor. Next time I make it, it could use a bit of pepper.

Before calling people names you may want to be better informed.  Making this has nothing to do with being lazy.  Some people are on Paleo diets and I am diabetic so no pastry means no carbs which means no blood sugar spikes for me.   I love quiche and this is just as much a quiche as one with pie crust.  This is a delicious recipe.

This is a great jumping off point for a crustless quiche.  I used the exact egg mixture as written but added asparagus, white onion, red bell pepper, green onion and chopped honey ham.  Sautéed the veggies first until soft then spooned the veggies into a muffin pan for twelve individual servings.  Poured in the egg mixture and baked for 35 Mom.

The only change I made was left out the salt since we have high BP.  You can add whatever your taste buds desire.    The no crust is a hit with me.    This turned out wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Wonderfully easy.  I thawed and added some California Blend veggies and it took longer to set.  Next time I think I will up the heat to 400F as I had to add 20 minutes at 350.

This is a great recipe that can be adjusted and added to, to suit your taste or what you have on hand.  I did not have swiss cheese, used sharp cheese, added some chopped ham, leftover asparagus, red pepper flakes.

I liked this but kept wishing for that flakey, buttery crust.  I did add just a little mustard powder, with just a touch of red pepper flakes and dill to the egg mixture. It had a very good flavor. I topped the quiche with additional shredded sharp cheese and a shake of good parma cheese. In my oven I had to cook the quiche a total of 60 min. I just checked it till a knife came out clean in the center. I'm curious how a complete pancake mix would work as suggested by another reviewer. Since I'm watching by daily carb total this was a good choice.

I won’t be making this again. I found the flour addition a bit worrisome and was right. The consistency was like a custard pie, instead of a light, fluffy egg consistency. The family, however raved about it!

I love this recipe because you can add anything to it.   So I used odds and ends in my fridge:  a few slices of ham that I chopped, 1/2 chopped onion that I sauteed, some spinach and grated extra old cheddar and montery jack cheeses.  I didn't measure these add ins.  What worked for me was that the base of the recipe can work with anything and I didn't have to go out and buy a crust.  I'll definitely be using this again as quiche is one of my "go to" foods where I'm trying to use up ingredients in my fridge.

This recipe is very tasty and really easy to make! I used ground bulk sausage instead of bacon, cheddar instead of Swiss cheese, and reduced the salt by half. After browning the sausage, I left it in my cast iron skillet, layered the shredded cheese, added the other ingredients and baked it in the oven in my skillet. I will definitely make this again, it will be a treat for us or for houseguests!

This is easy and delicious!!  I love quiche but rarely make it because I don't have pie crust on hand or don't have time to make one.  This is a perfect option.  I did saute the onions for a few minutes in a little of the bacon fat to cut the bite of the raw onions.   Definitely a keeper!!

I sautéed broccoli, mushrooms, yellow, red & orange bell peppers in avocado oil. I grated red onion instead of chopping it. Used Mexican blend cheese as we don’t like Swiss cheese. Hubs loved it.  Went the quickest of all the Christmas breakfasts!

Have made this twice in one week, after just finding the recipe in the magazine.  It's terrific!  Once I used ham, the second time bacon.  Also combined both swiss and cheddar cheeses to make 1 cup.  On top of those added spinach leaves,.  Decided to saute the onion with tomato in the bacon fat, plus a squirt of sriracha into the eggs.  It's perfectly easy and so very tasty for anytime.  Thanks myrite!

Delicious recipe and added a few hints from others like adding blanched Broccoli cut in small pieces and added some chopped red pepper about 2/3 cup combined. Gave it some nice color and flavor.  I used Colby Jack cheese instead of swiss. Broiled it a bit at the end too. Now for the bacon instead of frying the bacon, I used a cookie sheet and placed the bacon on parchment paper, sprinkled it with pepper and baked it for 15 to 20 minutes in the oven at 400°.

Used a whole package of bacon instead of 8 strips. Substituted cheddar cheese instead of Swiss. Added 1 diced Roma tomato and a handful of green onions on top before placing in the oven. Didn’t mix the salt in the mixture, rather sprinkled kosher salt on top before placing in the oven.  Turned out amazing. Thanks for the recipe.

This was incredibly delicious. My boyfriend and I could not believe how tasty this was. However, I did not have bacon and substituted steamed broccoli. Highly recommend this recipe which can be modified to ingredients you have on hand.

I made this today for a brunch party and it was the first time I've ever made quiche. My guests loved it and I thought it was pretty good too. :)

Excellent dish and easy to make. I'll use two 6" x 9" casserole dishes next time  because it fluffs up quite nicely. And I'll melt the margarine first as well. I used ham and bacon plus green pepper, red onion, minced garlic and mushrooms. Tasted great! I'd recommend it - you can make any combo out of it, which is what's so good about the recipe.

I love Quiche but do not love crust, so this is perfect.  i just made this and it is so good.  I followed the recipe but did add pepper.  Next time I can change it up.  I also like the suggestion of making them in a muffin tin.  This is so good.  I will be making it many more times.

So good! Followed the recipe exactly as written with the exception of using self rising flour because it was all I had. Threw in a little half n half too. AWESOME! Definitely will continue to make

Great and easy recipe. I've added zucchini, scallion, and a little basil. Also took me but longer to bake, about 50 minutes. Came out delicious.

I added 2 more eggs, dehydrated onion, green and red bell peppers raw, mushrooms raw, cooked turkey sausage (no bacon), and it was a huge hit! I also found that I needed to add 10 min to the cooking time, so it was the perfect consistency.

This was great, even though I accidentally messed up the recipe. I only used 2 tablespoons of flour to keep it not low carb. Then I forgot to add any milk! But it came out fine and was very tasty.

I forgot to add butter the second time I made it but never came to know the difference. The family loved it. It's a good way of feeding eggs to those younger ones who don't like to eat eggs in their regular fashion. Will definitely rnake it again.

Instead of using bacon I used pepperoni which I mixed into the batter. Instead of using a pie pan I baked them in a muffin pan. Cooking it in the muffin pan took less time so I got to eat faster. ;}

This came out great. I'd never made a quiche before and was pleased with how easy this was. After I cooked the bacon I saved a little bacon fat and sautéed the onions, mushrooms and spinach. I added to the egg mixture and added a little more cheese on the top. I used sharp cheddar to give it a little kick. I omitted the salt since the bacon was salty enough. I had to cook it a little longer, about 40 min and it came out perfect. Will be making this again many times and look forward to using different variations. I didn't even miss the crust and used skim milk to make it less fatty.  Thanks!

This quiche was easy and delicious.  All I had was skim milk, so I used half skim and half Half-N-Half which made a light, fluffy quiche.  Next time I will scale back to 1/2 or 3/4 tsp of salt b/c it was a tad too salty for our taste (and my husband loves salt.). I did use a glass pie plate and didn't have to make any adjustments on the baking time.

I make quiche often but I wanted a recipe with no crust to cut back on carbs.  This was easy and really good.  I followed the recipe almost exactly but didn't have the cheese it called for so I used shredded cheddar.  I also added broccoli for more greens and used 2 egg whites in place of one of the eggs.  It came out so good and my whole family loved it, even more than the quiche I make with the crust.  I am making it again this  morning but will be doubling the recipe and using a 9x12 instead of a deep pie plate.   It took about 35-40 mins to cook the first time and I'm guessing closer to 50 mins with a 9x12.  Very good recipe!

I made this for a friend that has pancreatic cancer.  She needs to be very careful about what she eats.  Cutting out the crust was important.  I used a little less bacon, added broccoli and cut the milk by 1/4 cup.  It turned out good.  She really liked it.  It is very easy to put together which is great.  The only negative comment I have is it had a bit of a flour taste.  That might have been because I cut the milk.  Next time I make this I will use the amount of milk called for in the recipe and see if it makes a difference.

Super easy. I had no crust ingredients, and this recipe makes it own crust with the cheese-it was fantastic. I changed these things:  used 6 eggs, used sharp cheddar cheese, added a dollop of sour cream to the mix, sauteed 1/4 c onion, 2 whole green onions, tsp of parsley, 4 mushrooms, 1/4 c red bell & 1/2 c green bell peppers-which I folded into the beaten egg/milk/flour mixture.  I topped it with fresh parsley and sprinkles of fresh chives.  Served it with fresh homemade bread & homemade Porter peach & plum jams. This will be a staple for brunch at the house for sure!

I made this using a toaster oven (a large one, not the tiny ones) and it came out very good, for a beginner, that is.
But since I have high blood pressure, I used 4 1/2 strips of bacon and half of the salt in the recipe. I used mozzarela and parmesan cheese.
The thing is that since I am using a toaster oven, next time I will lower the temperature and increase  the cooking time so the crust the eggs form will not be too tough.

I love recipes that can be adapted to what I have on hand and still come out great. The subs I made were evaporated milk for regular milk, pancake mix for the flour, Canadian bacon for the bacon slices, and white cheddar for the Swiss cheese. I added two cloves of garlic and a cup of chopped fresh spinach, plus a little parmesan cheese on top. I didn't see the need for salt since there was already salt from the meat and I used salted butter. I baked it in the same cast iron skillet that I sauteed the onions and meat in. I know that's a lot of changes, but that's just how I roll!

I thought this looked like a good nutritional way of cutting a few calories, and also good for those folks on the low carb diet. I added about a half cup of spinach and some grape tomatoes cut into halves. I  sauted the onion and spinach a little before I added them to the egg mix; just to make sure they were not crunchy. I had to bake it a little while longer, probably because I had added the spinach and tomato, but it was very good. I will make it again. I will probably use a deep dish pie plate also. It didn' t overflow but was close!

Made the first one per the exact ingredients and instructions for a birthday brunch and my guests loved it.  Served the leftovers the next morning (reheated in a cast iron skillet covered for about 5 minutes to reheat) and my husband loved it! Remade it again for dinner a week later and didn't have the Swiss cheese so added sharp Vermont cheddar instead along with a cup of fresh chopped spinach and 1/4 c sliced cherry tomatoes.  Again fabulous but the cheddar cheese made it taste saltier so when I redo this with these same ingredients I will cut the salt back to 1/2 tsp from 1 tsp.  Making this for company coming next week because it is so quick and easy and always delicious.

I would suggest you cook the chopped onion with the bacon and place on bottom of pie pan or 2 qt pyrex dish.  Much better flavor and add  pepper.  All in all this is a very good quiche.

This was very good, very easy, and I like that it didn't require pastry.  I'll make it again.

We love this!!  The flour makes a perfect "crust."  I added 1 more egg and spinach and used feta instead of cheddar.

Amazing. I added chopped mushrooms and substituted mozzarella cheese since I didn't have Swiss. Added some minced garlic as well and increased cooking time by five minutes.

I will probably cut back on the onions next time, and will have to make a larger portion.  I got just a small amount and my wife and daughter polished it off.

I. Do. Not. Cook. However, the mood hit me & I wanted to do something different for Christmas morning. This was very easy. I used mozzarella instead of swiss and added fresh spinach on top that I had quickly sauted in the bacon pan. It took much longer to cook, more like 45mins. My family was impressed!  We all loved it and had leftovers the next morning! I will be making this again.

This was my first time making a quiche. It was easy, and came out tasting perfect. My husband and our 14 month old both enjoyed it. My only change was to substitute onion powder for chopped onion, only because I didn't feel like chopping onion.  I'll definitely make this again. It would probably be simple to modify the recipe to include other common quiche ingredients.

Made this for my holiday brunch.  The crust was excellent, it was light, fluffy and tasted great.  I received nothing but compliments.  Decided at the last minute to make this, so I didn't have everything on hand (onion or swiss cheese) I used havarti and shredded italian six cheese. Great recipe,  thank you!  I posted a picture too, used my new quiche pan!

This is a really delicious recipe! I made a few changes based on what I had in the pantry...I used a combination of swiss, gruyere, and cheddar cheeses..reconstituted dry milk, 1 cup instead of 1 1\2, .ground black pepper and a sprinkle of mixed dry herbs topped it off. The cooking time was not long enough even after adding ten minutes but three minutes in the microwave finished it. Next time I'll start at a higher temp and the reduce the heat. Or maybe it was because the eggs and milk were cold...and room temp would have done better. Anyway, it turned out delicious and I'll make it again.

Great Recipe! I like to put 1/2 chopped onion and 1/2 chopped jalapenos to give it a spicy  kick in addition to the other optional veggies. So good!

Very easy recipe and tasted excellent! I added some chopped broccoli and I think that's what caused it to need a little longer cooking time (10 minutes). Definitely a keeper!

Great recipe! My twist on it was doubling recipe. Started with meat in  12" cast iron skillet. I then added onions, butter and many other veggies available and sauteed. Finally put the eggs, milk, spices, and flour over veggies. Topped with cheese and parsley and put in the oven.  Turned out delicious! I should've taken a picture.

Used this recipe and admit I made several changes, but the result was delicious. I didn't use bacon, but poured shredded Swiss cheese in bottom of glass quiche dish.  I used chopped raw broccoli florets, and rotisserie chicken breasts shredded. Also spiced it up with black pepper,  dried parsley,  red pepper,  garlic powder and minced onion from a bottle, skim milk, paprika, and mixed with remaining Swiss cheese and baked  in convection mode until top was browning.  This was seriously amazing! My husband LOVED it. Highly recommend. Don't think you can ruin it. Just add in what you like!

I know I did not really follow the recipe,l but it served as a great inspiration! Added a lot of vegetables and used much less cheese and no bacon. Used slightly less flower too and it was delicious and quick vegetarian dinner. My husband and I both loved it! What a great and healthy idea to make this without the crust! Thank you for the inspiration!

This is awesome.  It's so easy to add to as well!! It's great as written or to add in any leftover veggies I need to use up!! The only thing I do differently is add another egg. I also use my NutriBullet to blend the egg and flour together. It makes it very light and fluffy! Thanks! It's awesome!!

This was really quick and easy to make. Very versatile, too. I had mushrooms on hand that I needed to use up so I substituted them for the bacon. I used the butter int he recipe to sauce the mushrooms until they were golden brown. Great recipe!

I made this last week and we're already making it again. This time I'm making two because the two of us devoured the first one. I used 5 eggs in each, 1/2 lb of Jimmy Dean sausage in each and used a combo of colby jack, cheddar, parmesan and queso fresco; sprinkled with paprika on top. 35 minutes was perfect. We both thought it was one of the best quiches we'd ever had -- didn't miss the crust for a second. It feels like there is one! A favorite for us.

I made a slightly healthier version of this quiche by adding sautéed mushrooms, garlic, broccoli, zucchini and spinach and it was delicious! I also reduced the eggs to 3 and the milk to 1 cup. Will definitely make it again!

With one exception, the recipe was followed exactly as described and it turned out wonderful.  The only change was inadvertent: I was out of milk so Soy Milk was substituted on an equal basis and the recipe turned out fine. Both my wife and I loved it.

This is my go-to quiche. Very versatile in what you can add. I do add a little more flour if I add lots of veggies to compensate for the extra moisture. It cooks fantastic in cast iron, you will not regret it!

I did have to change a little bit but only because of what I had on hand but overall followed the recipe. It turns a lovely golden brown on top and is fluffier than other quiches I have made. This is my fav way though when short on time. I like the recipe because you can play around with it. I didn't have bacon but I did have a left over smoked sausage I cut up in small pieces, used a shallot for the onion, no swiss cheese so used a cheddar/mozza blend and cut back on the salt just a bit. I also used about 1/4 cup of chopped red pepper and sauted with the shallot in the butter called for in the recipe. A dash of pepper also added into the quiche. Thanks for posting a quick delicious recipe.

Made mostly as stated with exception of addition of pancake mix instead of flour as suggested by one reviewer.  Added mushrooms and red pepper.  Delicious.  Thanks for this crustless quiche

Great basic quiche recipe. Love the Swiss cheese, but we've tried all sorts of cheese and veggie combos. A go-to recipe for a quick dinner.

I followed most of the recipe. Instead of onion, I used some tri color peppers and green onion. Only used 3/4 cup of milk. Followed the rest of the recipe, except only cooked it for 25 min. It was delicious!
2nd review - I made this again with 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup milk, but it was too much flour. The consistency was a little off. Otherwise it was yummy!

What's great about this recipe is that you can use whatever ingredients you have on hand and it still turns out great! This time I substituted veggie bacon (I'm a vegetarian), avocado, mushroom, and topped with shredded Parmesan. Family loved it!

I made this for breakfast yesterday.  I was in a hurry and this is really quick and easy but it definitely needs to cook longer.  I substituted one half cup Bisqick for the flour.  Next time I make it I will add some grape tomatoes and zucchini and more cheese.  M

This was fantastic! So easy to make. I cooked the bacon first. When I was half way done with the bacon I used that to oil to grease up my glass backing dish. Once I finished the bacon I took it out and diced it up and spread it over the bottom of my dish and sprinkled some mozzarella cheese on top. In the bacon grease cooking pan I lightly cooked my diced up onions, mushrooms and ham. Then I mixed that with the egg mix which I followed the recipe ( minus the salt because of all the bacon and ham). I poured that on my dish and sprinkled a little more mozzarella on top. And baked at 350 for about 40-45 mins. It came out perfect. My picky husband could not get enough of it. It had a strong bacon taste for obvious reasons. That's the way we like it. ;) This recipe is a keeper!

This is my "go to" quiche recipe, as it eliminates the crust and so many calories ( oh, I also don't do the butter).  I have substituted the add-ins in too many ways to list them all (ham for bacon, asparagus, more onion, broccoli,  all sorts of cheeses, etc).  It's the basic eggs, milk and flour combo that is essential.  That said, I do have to push the top to the bottom about 2/3 of the way through cooking, to let the liquid in the middle cook and evaporate, especially when I double it.  It will puff up in the oven, but collapses when taken out.  Great leftovers, cold or heated for 1 min per slice in microwave.  Have served it to many quests who rave about it (hubby too)!

This has become a staple in my house and I've made it with spicy Italian sausage, smoked breakfast sausage, ground beef, and bacon with any type of cheese I have on hand and it always comes out great. I don't always add the butter and I don't add salt, the meat and cheese is  fatty and salty enough and I have not noticed any real difference when I've added the butter.

I liked the fact this was crustless. Very good and easy to put together. I used this recipe as a starting point, using things I had on hand--cheddar cheese,  frozen broccoli cuts (lightly steamed) and thinly sliced zucchini.  I only used about half the bacon, just due to personal preference.  I cut the salt to about 1/4 tsp., and added garlic pepper, Italian Seasoning and a little parsley .

This is the first quiche I've ever made, using flour in the egg mixture.  I like how it made the it "set"; however, I think I may cut the amount of flour in half next time.

I layered my filling ingredients; next time, I'll combine them before adding to the pie plate and covering with the egg mixture.

Will definitely make again!

I replaced the bacon by chicken breast cut in little chunks that I fried in avocado oil, with onion, half a green pepper and a cup of baby spinach.  I followed the recipe as is for the rest.  My husband and I loved it, and I will do it certainly again.

This was my first attempt to make quiche.  It turned out delicious. Substituted with rice flour and ham instead of  regular flour and bacon. I added spinach, broccoli, cauliflower and carrots and it was a winner. Very easy to make but did take  about 50 minutes to bake.  I would definitely recommend this recipe.

This was very good and quite easy. I had to change the onion for leeks because I hate that combination. I chopped and sauteed the white part of 1 leek, added 1/3 cup to the butter. I didn't have bacon so used some salami I had at home and in an effort to keep it relatively lo fat I used 9% Swiss. I felt that 1 teaspoon of salt is too much for this dish with the bacon/salami so added less than 1/2 tsp and it was perfect. I will make it again with bacon next time and it will be good too with slices of chicken/turkey hotdogs. A very useful, easy and tasty recipe.

Making it for dinner but when I entered it into My fitness pal and listed it to serve two people, it was very, very high in calories...so I cut down on the bacon in it to 5 pieces and put it to serve 4 people. We will just eat smaller portions and maybe a low cal side dish with it....other than that, it sounds great....can't wait to make it tonight.

This is a very good, simple, easy quiche recipe. I pretty much made it as written, but because of the bacon and cheese, I did cut the salt down to 1/4 teaspoon. I am glad I did, because it was the perfect amount. If I had added the whole teaspoon, it would have been way too salty for my taste. I also added some freshly ground black pepper. This is one of those recipes that you can change up easily (by adding/omitting filling ingredients) to suit your tastes. Great recipe - thanks!!

This recipe was the featured recipe in my inbox today. I had nothing planned for dinner when I got home from work, so figured I'd give it a try. I had some asparagus from the garden that needed to be used and some lunch meat, so decided to put both of those into this quiche. Since we only had cheddar cheese, that's what I used also.  Wow, it turned out wonderful. My husband really liked it too. This is a keeper! Thanks for sharing.

So good! Added in a lot of extra vegetables (red pepper, eggplant, squash), and did a 12-egg casserole to have it for breakfast at work all week. Also swapped out the Swiss cheese for cheddar, as it's a personal taste preference.

This was delicious.  I used pre-shreded  Italian cheese mix and added some sauted mushrooms.  I carmelized the onions and added them to the egg mixture  and blended blended that and the dry ingredients in a blender.  Like another reviewer I substituted part of the milk for non-fat yogurt.  I did not miss the crust at all.  I will use this recipe again perhaps adding different vegetables.  It was also excellent the next day served cold.

I don't think we like quiche any more or something. I added mushrooms an extra egg and some cheese. Everything else I did the same. It refused to set up in the middle even after some extra baking time and leaving it in the oven to set for about 20 minutes.

Super easy and delicious! The best thing is that you can add your own personal touches. I didn't have swiss cheese, so I used a colby jack blend. Pretty much any cheese would work. I added about a 1/3-1/2 cup of broccoli and sauteed those in bacon grease for a bit before adding them into the egg mix. I also added some cut up sausage links. When it was finished baking, I added some shredded cheese to the top to let melt...which may have been overall but it was delicious either way!

My family loved it--gone immediately!  I read through the reviews & I used the pancake mix instead of flour.  I did not use bacon as I was short on time.  I had some  already sauteed mushrooms, onions, & asparagus that I added, also did not have Swiss so I used some Parmesan, cream cheese & mozzarella instead--turned out great!  Very easy to make , & I loved that it was crust less as I did not have a pie crust around either.  I did bake about 10 minutes longer & had it near bottom of oven & the top was browned to perfection!

Good basic recipe. I use at least 6 eggs, no butter, no flour, and about 1/4 cup of cheddar cheese, and 1/2 cup of  ham or turkey bacon. Then about 1/2 cup of asparagus or broccoli, and 1/4 cup green or regular onions. 
I've made it many times, starting with the exact recipe and tweaking as I've gone along and I've discovered omitting the butter and flour are hardly noticeable. It's a good, nutritious meal when there's not too much cheese and meat in it, too. :)

Since I didn't have any Swiss cheese on hand, I used sharp cheddar.  I also added some diced ham.  Next time I will add a couple more eggs.   Everyone loved this!  Goes together quickly!

I think I may need to try this again.  The ratings were very high so I was hopeful but I needed to cook it longer than 35 min. for it to be completely set in the center.  Perhaps that is because I added many more veggies (broccoli, mushrooms, grated yams) and substituted green onion for the white.  Not bad, but not as good as I'd hoped.  Thanks for sharing, though!

My family loved it! They said that it was the best quiche they had ever tried. Since i have a  lot of family members leaving in my house; i used mozzarella cheese instead of swiss, and it still worked just the same.

Really enjoyed this. Incredibly simple and absolutely delicious. I used veggie sausage instead of bacon and added spinach too. My husband was scraping the baking dish, when we'd finished.

Great recipe! I use whatever cheese I have hand and swap the bacon for veggie blends. Our favorite so far has been cherry tomato, mushroom, and onion.

De-lish! And easy!! 
I used grated Tasty cheese, the Australian equivalent of Cheddar,  and Jarlsberg cheeses, and also I used sliced honey ham that I sautéed and cut into small pieces. Also, I found the onion a little overwhelming so the next time I made it, I omitted the onion altogether. 
This one is a winner!

I made this using 3 oz. of Canadian Bacon cut into small pieces and shredded white Cheddar cheese instead of the Swiss cheese.  I chopped half of a red bell pepper and a small shallot and sautéed them in a tablespoon of butter before layering on top of the meat and cheese.  Followed the rest of the recipe as written except that I used a 10" quiche dish.  This was very good, but a little greasy probably due to my slight alterations. When I make it again, I think that I can safely omit the 2 tablespoons of melted butter.

For those that don't eat flour or are counting carbs you can make this recipe by just leaving out the flour.  I've been doing this for years and it still tastes good.  I also don't use onion.

I had some ham and half-and-half cream left over, so decided to make this quiche. I also used cheddar cheese instead of Swiss, added some chopped red pepper and mushrooms for added colour and flavour and sprinkled it with chopped chives and parsley on top. I suppose it's a whole new recipe by now!  I prefer no crust quiche and this one has turned out very nice and tastes divine! Will definitely make it again using what I have on hand and perhaps next time I'll add a bit of pepper or dash of Tabasco for a bit of a bite.

I changed bacon to sausage and used Italian sausage which I fried ahead of time in small chunks. Added garlic because I love garlic! I doubled the recipe and put into a cake pan. Would easily make twelve servings this way!

So easy and delicious every time.  I add thawed frozen brocolli to the recipe and use pepper jack cheese.  If you use dried crumbled bacon it is ready in jiffy.

It was easy and delicious, and you can get creative with substitutions . I'm a vegetarian, so I skipped the bacon, but added diced bell peppers and tomatoes to the main mix (I recommend thoroughly draining them or soaking excess moisture up with a paper towel to avoid the dish being runny). I also subbed the cheese with an aged cheddar and a little parmesan. You could easily substitute a veggie meat-like product as well.

This is hands down the only quiche that my kids will eat! We don't usually eat bacon, so I cube ham instead and only put in a tiny bit of salt (abot 1/8 tsp). Don't forget to butter the pan you use if you do it this way, otherwise it will stick a bit more than the bacon version. A great crustless recipe and very quick.

Made this exactly as the recipe said and turned out being the best quiche Ive tasted. I made it the night before so I could just reheat it for dinner for everyone the following day and ended up eating almost half of it with my girlfriend we just couldnt wait. So easy to make too. Thanks for the recipe.

I left out the bacon and added hot Italian sausage and sharp cheddar cheese.  Baked it in a 10" quiche pan.  It poofed over the sides a bit and was rather thin, so I would use a 9" pie dish next time.  I added about a tsp of dry ground mustard also.  It wasn't bad, but was hoping for a lighter, more even bake.  I will try it again though, but will make further modifications.

This turned out pretty good.  And it was easier than your typical quiche.  I did add an extra egg, used cheddar instead, added spices (garlic powder, cajun seasonings, salt and pepper) to the egg mixture, used green onion instead, and also added spinach.  It fluffed up nicely and was definitely gourmet.  Will make again!

This is the first ever quiche I made!  It turned out so good and was so easy.  Even my dad, who freaks out at the mere mention of something that isn't red meat n' potatoes, liked it and went back for seconds!  We paired it with homemade salsa.  This is definitely going on my list of things to make again and again! c:

I've been making this recipe for 40 years.  I love the bacon swiss, but I have used many combinations also;  spinach, mushroom and ham with cheddar; asparagus and mushroom;  chicken with mixed veggies; artichoke hearts with goat cheese.... just use what you have and try any combo that comes to mind!  If you add a side of fruit or a small salad, it makes for a great meal, or make in cupcake (or mini cupcake) pans for a nice appetizer.

Substituted frozen mixed veggies for bacon. Also sauteed the onion. Added 1/2 cup of Jamima Complete Pancake Mix. And a sprinkle of paprika at the end. I had shredded fancy Italian cheese and shredded 4 Cheese Mexican so I used them both. I cooked it for 40 minutes. Very good!

It turned out awesome, and tasted great.  I didn't have swiss cheese, so I used sharp cheddar and a Mexican cheese blend, and I added a couple of dashes of Texas Pete.

This quiche was fantastic.  I made a few changes, added a layer of sourdough bread to the bottom, a mix of goat cheese, Parmesan, and mexican cheese mix.  Wonderful, my family who, "hates eggs", devoured their brunch.

Delicious.  I did bunch of asparagus, red onion, mushroom,  cheese and ham.  Cubed 1.5 slices of bread too and added in it.  Best brunch ever do not need crust.  I didn't have Swiss cheese so used Edam or any cheese will do.   Think bróccoli, bacon And tomato would be delicious too.

Absolutely loving this quiche!  I used a bit less than 8 pieces bacon in the bottom and a shredded cheese blend I had on hand. I didn't have milk but I did have heavy cream so I subbed that in plus a bit of water (maybe 1c cream + 1/2 c water) and it turned out so decadent! 
I thought the amount of onion was perfect, although some other veggies might be nice too, but I will dial back the salt a bit next time I make this. The fella was a HUGE fan.

Came out great. The other half told me I need to make this all the time. He's never said that before! The only changes I made: I baked it for about 20 minutes instead of 35. My oven is small and so that might have affected timing. I also used a little creme freche instead of milk because I happened to have some, added a little fresh tomato, and some jalapenos. The only thing is it was a tad salty, maybe because of the bacon. Next time I might pull back a tad on the salt.

I have never made a quiche before so while hosting a girls lunch, I found this recipe with all the rave reviews.  Have  no fear, this recipe is a KEEPER!!!  I only made a few minor changes.  The ingredients I used were broccoli, bacon and cheese.  I steamed and chopped the broccoli first then followed the recipe to the tee.  Delicious!!  I have since made my children a more "kid-friendly" version made with chopped ham and cheese alone.  My 8 year old had seconds... very rare!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

This was a fantastic recipe! Had to cook it for 1 hr 15 min but it turned out very good, excellent color! Added a few extras like some mushrooms, zucchini and blanched broccoli but other wise made as directed. I did only use 4 slices of bacon since I had thick sliced and omitted salt, added pepper. Definitely a keeper!

I made some changes to this recipe and everyone in my home loves it!  I use leftovers from eating out. When we have steak and home cut fries leftover they go into this the next morning. I cut the steak in very small pieces, cut the fries into small pieces, add the grilled onions and mushrooms, and use cheese cheese. This is awesome!

This was quick and easy and everyone loved it.  I made a couple of changes just to use up some things in my refrigerator..added chopped red and yellow peppers and used sharp cheddar cheese.  It looked festive and tasted great.  The next time I would cut the salt in half and my guys suggested adding hash brown potatoes.  Was good with a crisp tossed salad and small dish of flavored yogurt.

I loved this recipe! It worked perfectly and impressed my breakfast guests. I made a few changes. I did not add bacon because I don't eat it, and I added a little spinach. I also only put about 1 tbsp of butter instead of the 2 and cut down on the onions a tiny bit. I also used white cheddar instead of swiss since I already had it on hand.

I made this yesterday because I had 3 slices of bacon to use up...  This is so delicious - better than I thought it'd be and I didn't miss the crust.  I think having less bacon reduced the saltiness (and fat!) so it worked out well.  I sauteed the onions with some mushrooms and the remainders of a freezer bag of southern style hash browns.  Used two more eggs also.

Yum!  Made in xtra large muffin tin since that's all I had on hand. No bacon either so I used diced ham. I'm happy to report that this works as individual quiche servings. Didn't even have to change the measurements or the cooking time.  Excellent recipe. Thank you!

This was great!  I was going to make breakfast for dinner and I didn't have as many eggs in my refrigeration as I thought so I thought I would find a quiche recipe to stretch the eggs as far as I could.  This was easy and everyone really liked it!  Maybe next time omit the salt because the bacon had enough salt in it or use turkey bacon instead. It would be good with whatever veggies you want to add too. Will definitely make again!

Quick, easy, delicious. Even my 5-year-old-picky-eater granddaughter ate it ("You like bacon and cheese right? Try this.") I followed the recipe to the letter and my guests raved about it. Thank you for submitting this. Next time I think I will soak the unchopped onion in cold ice water for 10 minutes before chopping to subdue the onion taste.

This recipe is easy and delicious! The only thing I would change is the amount of salt which I will cut in half or eliminate completely.

Made this dish today for Sunday School, it was great!  Had two very small slices leaving church and they were taken by one of the teens, who said he went back for thirds!  I will definitely be making this again... Thanksgiving and Christmas morning.

This was quick and easy and delicious. I did add mushrooms and some green pepper, both of which I cooked briefly in the bacon grease while the pan was still hot. Just to soften them a bit. I didn't have any Swiss and I'm not a big fan of it so I used pepper jack and mozzarella mixed and added a bit of Tabasco sauce for a kick. As others did I had to cook it about ten extra minutes. It still sank but was cooked through and came out so deliciously that we all had seconds. I took the picture before it sank. Very easy, very good and tweek-able to you own taste!

While I do think this is a quick, easy way to make quiche, it was very salty.  It may have been the combination of bacon and the smoked swiss I used, but when trying this one again I will omit the added salt and the butter, and add some more veggies to it.  The texture of this was wonderful, but again, just too salty.

As the author suggested, I spread 2 cups of broccoli florets over the bacon before adding the egg mixture.  After baking the quiche for the suggested time, I broiled it for 4 minutes. Turned out to be the best quiche I've ever had so definitely a keeper. My husband said that I have outdone myself again :)

This was a hit
We added mushrooms and had some white cheddar and manchego cheese handy. So we used them instead of the Swiss. Even used gluten free flour because one person is gluten free. Everyone loved it and finished it in one sitting. Great breakfast with a side of fresh fruit.

This was faubulous! So easy to cook and heat up in the toaster oven for breakfast all week. I used 5 eggs and added about 2 cups of veggies. Today I used onion, red bell pepper, zucchini, and chopped parsley. I have made two times now and have used whatever veggies I have on hand. I am gluten free so I used gluten free pancake mix instead of flour and it was fantastic; you could also try other gluten free flours, next time I will try almond flour for a nutty flavor. I read about tip from other review on glass pie pan; yes, it does take a it longer, add another 7-10 minutes. Glad to come across this recipe, very easy, extremely tasty and easy to make gluten-free.

Had to use different ingredients-broccoli and shredded Mexican mix cheese-but otherwise followed recipe. Excellent, and such a quick meal yet looks like you spent so much time in prep. Will be making many more times!

We made this in a 4 x 6 rectangle pan, additional time is needed.  About 10 more minutes.  Before addicting the egg mixture we also added a bit of chopped tomato (a slice and a half) and about a quarter cup of spinach.  Then poured the egg mixture over as directed.  I would also cut back more on the salt.  The bacon will provide the salt you need.  I'd say a quarter of a tsp at most.  Such a keeper.  Will be made in our household quite a bit.  Enjoy

Awesome!  I added some fresh tomatoes, green onions, and mushrooms. Followed everything else accordingly and it turned out great!  This is a great recipe when you have no pie crust around.

I enjoy this recipe.  I have it 3 times.  The first time was just as written.  It was too salty for me.  The second time, it was simply with half the salt.  The third time, I made it with ham and cheddar cheese.  Had to cook it for 45 minutes.  It was great.  Can't wait to try it with veggies.

Fabulous recipe! I needed to bake it for about 45 minutes, but that may have been because of my oven. Like some others, I also made mine a lower fat version (1% milk and 2% cheese), and I omitted the raw onion. I used a carmelized onion and a red pepper/roast eggplant puree instead of the bacon.  Me, my husband and our brunch guest loved it.  I especially love how easy it was to make and how accommodating the recipe is to changes.  Thanks so much!

I would have eaten the entire thing if I didn't think it would kill me. I made a crust (super fast in the food processor) and added broccoli and some black pepper. Also changed the Swiss to cheddar. Divine.

Sorry, but I did not like this recipe.  It was kinda like runny scrambled eggs.  I think it had too much milk in it, not only because of the flavor, but also because I had to bake it an extra 25 minutes to get it firm.  My family was excited about quiche because I had made some other recipes from Allrecipes, but I am afraid they were disappointed with this quiche. Maybe it was me - I dunno.

This was a great recipe.  I, too, used baking mix.  I sautéed red onion in 1 T of butter. I didn't have enough swiss so I added a little cheddar.  I also used part whole milk and part skim.  Turned out perfect!  So easy.

Very good! Made a few changes: For a start because is was on hand along with left over chicken drumsticks and cheddar cheese. Sub the regular flour out for gluten free flour. Also added nutmeg and black pepper for a little added flavor. I severed it in 2 oblong individual dished which were well coated with butter. Very good.

I thought this was mediocre. The only deviation I made was turkey bacon to save on calories. Next time I'll add mushrooms and maybe broccoli to give it a little more substance. The flavor was good and it was relatively easy to make, I just felt like it needed more.

I thought it would be "meh" but it was amazing. It's definitely going into the breakfast recipe rotation. 

I used whole wheat flour. It didn't come out as pretty, but I like the slightly different flavor it adds versus white flour.

This recipe is so good and easy for a cooking dummy like myself.  It took me awhile to make the bacon and shred the cheese with my toddler son so I would prepare these items a night before. I did add additional 8 minutes in the oven since I used glassware.

Awesome recipe! I used mozzarella cheese (it's what I had) and sautéed both fresh spinach and halved cherry tomatoes and added them to the egg mixture. I didn't have onion, but it didn't matter. I also baked it in my casserole dish, instead of a pie plate just because i added more to it, so i didn't know if it would fit.  It took a little longer, but i added more eggs, so I expected that. The flavor was great! I have never made a quiche, but now i have been told by my family I have to make this all the time!

I added Italian herbs, peppercorn, Parmesan instead of Swiss cheese and absolutely loved it. My favorite quiche yet. I liked the cheesy bacon crust vs the bread crust.

This was very good!! I left out the onion, but did add onion powder. I used cheddar cheese and hot pepper cheese, will use more hot pepper cheese next time, as we like things spicy. Will leave out the butter, don't think it needs it.  I think next time I make this I will add shredded hash browns.

Big hit with friends. Omitted onions, added a ready-made pie crust to bottom, finely chopped spinach, and sautéed mushrooms. Replaced Swiss for 3 blend shredded Mexican cheese.

Quick and easy to make your own. Added sausage and pepper jack cheese to mine and my family loved it. Thinking next time I'll add salsa in place of the onions as well.

It was good, BUT definitely didn't need ALL OF THE SALT!! You already have enough sodium from the bacon and you can always "salt to taste" after it is on your plate. I had to bake mine for 45 minutes, in order for it to get done....maybe because I used skim milk? I am not sure. I will make again,  but skip the salt.

Exceptional taste and easy to make!!  Only change I make is to add red peppers, and reduce the milk just a touch, just so mixture would fit in pie plate. I also put onions and red peppers right on top of cheese, and then added egg mixture. Much easier to whisk liquids and flour together that way.

I went overboard on the filling (1 bag broccoli, 1/2 c. ham, 4 oz sliced mushrooms and 4-5 chopped artichoke hearts) so to make it fit in the pie pan, I cut back the milk to 1/2 c. and the flour (gluten free) to 1/8 c.  I also was unfamiliar with the oven and ended up having to finish cooking the quiche in the microwave after discovering the casserole wasn't set.  Nonetheless, it turned out and tasted great!

Cleaned out fridge! Sauteed onions, garlic, fresh spinach. Set aside to cool. Added, a little shredded carrot and shredded yam, some diced green/red peppers, & a few canned mushrooms. Sprayed a 9 1/2 glass pie dish & lined with cheddar then the cooked bacon. Whisked 5 eggs, 1/2 tsp salt (I used salt when sauteing spinach), flour, 1 cup condensed milk, 1/2 cup water, ground black pepper, red pepper flakes, & butter. Added cooled veggies to egg mixture and poured over bacon. Baked approx 1 hr

Wow! This is so good!  I decided to make individual quiches by pouring the mixture into muffin tins - made a dozen. Watch out, this is so yummy its addictive :)
This has become my "go to" casserole for morning functions - PTA/PTO, Sunday School, home visits - it's great!

I used American cheese in place of the Swiss and I shaved some left over steak from dinner the other night in place of the bacon. I think the salt needs to be NOT added or at least half of what it calls for. Otherwise it was delicious and I would make it again.  I took some pics and posted on Facebook and one of my friends asked for the recipe and I shared the link to the recipe.

Love that there is no crust in this quiche! I used pancake mix instead of flour and use triple vcheddar cheese.   I grated the onion and added some chopped ham.  Excellent!

Excellent recipe, really!!!  My husband loves it.  We have it for dinner.  He even brought one to work and he says it was gone in a few minutes.  Slices perfectly too. Followed the recipe as instructed except microwaved the regular bacon and baked the quiche longer than 35 minutes, would say at least 40 but no more than 45 minutes.  I use a shallow round corningware dish, 24 cm, which is slightly over 9 inches, works perfectly. Delicious and easy recipe!  Do not hesitate to try it.

Simple to follow and nice clean taste. I think the only change I will make next time is to cut back on the salt as it was a bit much. Otherwise made as directed and it was good.

I made this tonight, only change is used 1/2 cup light cream and a cup of water, and uncle bucks pancake mix from basspro. Gave it a lovely vanilla taste.  Added broccoli and a bit of nutmeg.  Very nice, will make and vary often.

Great easy recipe. My 9 year old son made it. We used bisquick instead of flour. Outstanding!  We reduced the milk by 1/4 cup and cooked it about 5 minutes longer.

This was a great basic recipe, made a few changes: used pancake mix in place of flour, cut the onion back by half, used a heavy pinch of salt, added 1/2 cup chopped ham + 2 oz of gouda cheese + 3 tablespoons of egg whites whisked several times the last time just before pouring.  Started my base layer with meats then added the cheese, baked extra 12 minutes on convention baking setting and let stand for 10 minutes before serving.  It puffed up about 2" and fell gradually while cooling, but man oh man was it good!  Husband when in for 3rds!!!

I added the Quick Quiche to my Allrecipes recipe box back in 2009 and have been meaning to review it since! The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly with excellent results. Since then, I have made the Quick Quiche several dozen times, adding my own variations (subbing out the bacon for sausage or ham, using different cheeses, adding veggies, etc.), all with stellar, 'aw mom! It's all gone?!' results. The basics of the this recipe allow so much wiggle room for experimentation, so don't be shy! Add all the stuff you love and enjoy the ease of a delicious, hassle-free Sunday morning quiche, or breakfast for dinner (we love breakfast for dinner in my home!). Thank you for sharing this awesome 'go to' recipe. It has a permanent place in the family cookbook!

For a first time quiche, it turned out fine. It took 45 minutes to cook. Next time, I plan to include more bacon and some veggies. Great base to be creative.

I made this last night and followed the recipe but used the complete pancake mix instead of flour. I added baby porabello mushrooms, spinach and used shrimp instead of bacon. It baked perfectly and tasted completely awesome!  This is my new healthy breaskfst staple!

I love this recipe, it is just a basic that My family enjoyed the first time I made it.  Since making it the first time, I have changed things around such as a pound of sausage instead of the bacon, used Cheddar cheese instead of the Swiss.  Very versatile.

Loved this recipe!  Made it last night and the only changes I made were to use whole wheat flour and added a shredded orange pepper.  I think the orange pepper worked really well because it added a bit of sweet to the recipe.  I also used sharp cheddar cheese instead because that is what I had on hand.  My family absolutely loved it and this will certainly go into our rotation.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have made this about 5 times. I add steamed asparagus (1/3 - 1/2 cup chopped); 1 bunch green onion - didn't bother to saute them. 1/2 cup gluten free Bisquick; no butter or salt; 1 deseeded, peeled and chopped one small - medium tomato. For the bacon, I used Oscar Mayers's Real bacon pieces. 1 teaspoon of Mrs Dash's extra spicy seasoning. I also use jumbo eggs; which necessitates using a 10 inch pie plate. I cook it at 375 degrees for roughly 50 min. Generally I just start checking at 35 min and keep checking until the quiche sets.

i loved this easy recipe.  I spiced it up using Italian seasonings, mozz and parm instead of swiss, and a bit of pancetta instead of bacon.  also threw in a few red pepper flakes to give it some kick.  yum.  served with garlic bread and a bit of marinara on top.  good dish, and very easy and cheap for a quick dinner.

I have been making my quiches without a crust for about 15 years.  Who needs the extra calories.  I just follow

I thought this was a great quiche and it turned out so good.  And the best part:  it was easy to make with ingredients that are right at home. It was my first time making it, and following the instructions, I made it to be perfect!

Just made this and taste tested before putting away for breakfast.    Changes were chopped ham instead of bacon, added about a cup of fresh spinach and used whole wheat flour.  Great flavor and texture.  Thanks for a n awesome and easy recipe.

This is simple, easy and very good.  I found this recipe to use up some Swiss cheese I had on hand.  Also, in my quest to clean out the frig, I used Johnsonville sausage instead of the bacon.  
The end result was a little saltier than we liked, and the cooking time was an additional 25 minutes, but it was very good.

I loved this recipe. I chopped some fresh asparagus, onions and mushrooms and sauted them in a little butter for a few minutes before adding to the cheese and bacon. I had to contain myself from eating the whole dish. I made it in a souffle dish and it did take an hour to cook but it was so worth it. Thanks for a great recipe. I will definitely make it again!

It was so easy to make and no pie crust!  I found it to be rather salty though, so I would reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp.

So easy, so good!  Even though I know cheddar bakes "greasy", it was the only cheese in the fridge so I made do.  Hoping next time to have Swiss on hand so as to experience this wonder fully!  If cheddar is all you have on hand, it's best omit the butter.  Would love to try this cold, but I fear that it will be all gone by tomorrow!
Edit 2018:  Tried this with a tsp of curry in the mix - still delicious but in a whole new way!

This was great for what it is - a quiche without a crust. I served it cold at a baby shower and it was yummy that way! I used a bit more cheese, just because I really like my quiches cheesy. YUM!

Cut bacon to 4 slices and added ham, half-tomato & a few mushrooms.  Also sprinkled with Italian seasoning before cooking.  Turned out really good!

I omitted the bacon, used fresh spinach, added garlic and mushrooms. I thought the butter added too much fat, so next time I will cut it by half. I baked this about 5 minutes longer, then put it under the broiler for a few minutes to make it crusty. Really tasty!!

Really quick and delicious Quiche.  I never made Quiche before so I followed the directions exactly and I added some ham, broccoli and mushrooms to the original recipe and it was GREAT!  Will definitely make again.

my boyfriend inhaled this dish. I  had extra blue cheese left over so i used  that in lieu of swiss. So easy and great I'm sure any cheese would be excellent!

For a quick but special breakfast to thrill my truly abnormal 4-year-old on school picture day, this did the trick! She loves the quiche at our local downtown coffeehouse, Acoustic Cafe, and said this was better (I thought it was about the same, but being vegetarian she's never tried one of theirs with bacon). We used 6 slices of Morningstar vegetarian bacon, probably too much swiss cheese (we didn't measure) and about 3/4 of a package of frozen spinach I had left over and melting in the fridge. I don't think we ended up using quite as much salt; I use a grinder, so I pretty much eyeball it. Oh! I mismeasured the milk and accidentally used 2 cups, so we used 6 eggs. It set up just fine in 35 minutes, or seemed to, but there was a little egg pooled on top after I let it sit, so I microwaved it for a couple minutes, maybe 3 or 4? There was extra (obviously, with an extra 2 eggs and 1/2 cup milk)which I poured off in a small glass frying pan with cut up ham for my husband. He was also pretty thrilled with it. In a smaller pan it only takes about 20 minutes to firm up nicely, so the people having trouble with it not setting up may want to try a couple smaller pans.

My kids and I really loved this!! I cooked the onions with the bacon to kick up the flavor a bit and added a bit of pepper. Will definitely make this again.

Absolutely delicious!  My Husband never eaten quiche before. Now he loves it.  I didn't have any real crab and used the artificial crabmeat and shrimp.  I followed the recipe as written otherwise.  Using the rollout dough from pillsbury which taste great, my quiche was creamy, delicious and the crust was perfect.  Thanks.

Now that was awesome!!! We made triple the recipe so that we could freeze some for later. I did make some adjustments though... I didn't use bacon, I used 2 lbs of pork sausage and about 1/2 cup of finely diced mushrooms. I also added a little bit of garlic powder, and for the entire mix I used 2 tbsp of butter due to the suggestions of other reviewers. Also, I used 2 parts pancake mix and 1 part flour (1 cup pancake mix and 1/2 cup flour) One other touch I added was syrup. In 2 of the 6-- 8" pans that we used, I added syrup over the cooked sausage/cheese mix.  This was an awesome awesome awesome recipe as I only expected to get rid of 2 pans tonight but we ended up eating all 3. The kids ate more slices than me!!! Definitely a keeper!!!

I tried to lighten up this recipe by using turkey bacon, reduced fat sharp cheddar and mozzarella. I added tomatoes and used green onion instead of regular. It was ok, but nothing special. It would probably have been better with regular bacon.

Terrific recipe. Typically, I choose to not add milk with eggs in a quiche recipe. However, the milk and flour (I blended these two ingredients together in my Ninja blender) set up a creamy confluent texture to the eggs and butter mixture. As such, I saw an opportunity to add in a conservative handful of fresh poblano and jalapeño, thinly sliced shallots, a couple more slices of swiss floated inside the poured in mix topped off with a good handful of freshly shredded colby jack cheese. My husband  l o v e d  this dish which performed as a side dish, this morning, to some fresh scallops sautéed in butter, garlic, basil and sweet onion. Bonus round: its all carb free, my friends. Thanks a million for a terrific recipe that helped clean out the fridge and meet our brunch needs this morning! Ness Orr in Houston

Okay, I messed up and threw all the ingredients together and it came out AMAZING! I just greased the pan really good, and it did take a bit longer than 35 minutes but even the soft middle was yummy and creamy. Oh, I also forgot the salt and added some fresh spinach. Even my kids loved it, definitely a keeper!

Great, easy dish that is really tasty! The changes I made: sauteed onions in bacon grease and added chopped broccoli; used colby jack shredded cheese instead of swiss; added an additional egg; baked in a 7x11 dish for an additional 6 minutes.
Family loved it and it will be an easy "go to" dish.

Very good, next time i will use less milk though and take out the butter. I added green pepper and put cheese and paprika on the top at the last 5 minutes. I used a glass pie dish and it took about ten minutes longer. I will use this recipie again

This was pretty good for my first quiche.  I did not add bacon, but instead added brocooli, onion, and cheese.  I did needed to cook mine for probably 45 minutes instead of 35 like the recipes says.  At 35 minutes, the quiche was still a bit too runny.

This was DELICIOUS!!!! I only made a couple of changes...I used only 4 slices of bacon (I didn't want to make it too bacon-laden) and I used 5 eggs since the ones I had were smaller. I also used shredded cheddar cheese instead of swiss. Everyone loved it and it was sooooooooooooo easy and had a very simple clean up. Yum yum!

I used 5 eggs, about 12 slices of bacon, added sauteed mushrooms, substituted green onions for the regular onions and cheddar for swiss.  I left out the butter because there was so much extra bacon.  I baked it in a round casserole dish.  It tasted good, but different from regular quiche.  I would describe it as less egg tasting even though I used an extra egg.  Microwaves just fine the next morning or for a midnight snack!

Made this the other day and it was absolutely delicious. It's easy - and if you can easily customize it to your taste or to whatever is available in the fridge. The beauty of it is that it only needs 3 or 4 eggs.

I substituted Muenster cheese for the swiss as well as substituting the butter with grease produced from frying up the bacon.  Instead of using 1 1/2 cups of milk, I used 1 cup of sour cream and 1/2 cup of Rotel.  It turned out delicious!

WOW!  The best quiche!  So super yummy.  I added tomatoes last time and plan on adding mushrooms next time.  I used fat free milk, low fat swiss cheese and egg beaters.  Thanks so much for this awesome recipe.

EXCELLENT!  I made this quiche on a whim for dinner and my husband is a happy man, as am I.  I followed recipe as written but just chopped up the swiss cheese instead of shredding and added a handful of mild cheddar and broccoli to the egg mixture.  It was just great.

This is a great quick quiche!  Having backyard chickens I am always looking for good egg recipes and this one is a keeper!  I don't like making pie crusts from scratch (unless it's the holiday season) and I refuse to buy the ones loaded with chemicals so this seemed the perfect compromise.  I love how the slight crust forms at the bottom of the pan and how you can mix up with basic recipe with different veggies and different cheeses.

awesome recipe! I made it for my breakfast club and it was full success.  I did not add any butter since the bacon was greasy enough, also followed the advices here and reduced milk, fried up the onions in bacon drippings, added some fresh spinach as well as some chili flakes.  I will definitely make this quiche again.

Absolutely delicious! This was so quick and simple to prepare. I used ham instead of bacon and added garlic. This is one I will keep and use frequently. Great for a quick weeknight dinner.

I made a few modifications: I processed the ham briefly in my Magic Bullet. Then processed the onion and one jalepeno also. Layered it as directed and finally whipped the eggs, 1T butter and my homemade buttermilk bisquit mix, and milk  in the Magic Bullet till blended. Turned out great.

Delicious.  I did use 1/2 cup of pancake mix instead of the flour, but it would have been just as good with the flour.  Thanks for a great recipe.  It was quick and easy....just the kind I like when I am feeling too tired to cook.

I never knew I could make quiche before!  This recipe was a great change of pace from the other recipes I had been making for my family.  I substituted a different kind of cheese and removed the bacon.  I think I could add just about anything found on an omelet to this dish and it would still be great!

I admit that I added a little red pepper and mushroom to the onion, which I sauteed ahead of time in about a tablespoon of the bacon fat. The quiche turned out great. I will be making this again.

Easy and fun to make. It's SO fluffy! All SO easy. We added broccoli. I took out the bacon, onion and butter. But it was SO YUMMY! I want to do this recipe again adding mushrooms and  onions. Try it!!!

This was a little more bland than I expected it to be.  However, I used Colby Jack rather than swiss (because that's what I had).  Next time, I'll use the swiss.  I'll definitely make it again, however.  We ate it for dinner with a spinach salad.

This is what you call easy breezy. I made this using plain old mature cheddar (I did not have Swiss at the time) and it was a hit. If I did not put my foot down, based on the continued requests at home, I would have been making quiche for a week. You cannot go wrong with this one.

This was an "okay" quiche in my books. It was easy and quick, but didn't look as pretty or taste quite as good as I was hoping it to. I might make it again, but we'll see.

Very very good! I followed the recipie, with the exception of substituting Colby/Jack instead of swiss because I'm not such a big fan. This turned out splendidly for my veryy first time making any sort of quiche! My only complaint, if any, is that the amount of salt added in addition to the bacon made it ever so slightly saltier than I might have wanted. But this will be an easy fix the next time I make this, which will be very soon! The "crust" came out perfect, and I look forward to experimenting with adding other ingredients in the future. Thanks!

Not a big pastry fan so this recipe was a perfect choice for me.  Excellent base to add what you have available, namely grated carrot, red bell pepper, spinach, feta and mozzarella cheeses, I used cooked chicken instead of bacon.  Didn't have enough eggs so used the three I had and it came out fantastic!  Will make this again and again.

I cut the bacon into tiny pieces before frying it, so I wouldn't have to crumble it later.  After pouring off the grease, I sauteed the onions (and added some mushrooms) in the pan for a couple minutes, as other reviewers suggested.  For some reason this took a lot longer to cook than it should have - at 35 min, the outside was done, but the center was still wet.  I finally had to turn off the oven and just leave it in there for an hour since we had an appt.  It was very tasty though and I'm looking forward to trying it again with different fillings.

I love this recipe. It's a great base for the perfect quick quiche. I've used the base for this recipe to create 5 cheese quiche, asparagus and sweet onion, spinach with mozarella and parmesan and many other things. There is no end to the possibilities of mix ins available with this recipe!

I adore this recipe! I have made it dozens of times already, and each time I use the egg-milk-flour base and just throw in whatever else (chicken, ham, crab, asparagus, etc!!!) Sooo delicious and unbelievably easy. Thank you so much!

I was skeptical about the flour in a quiche but it really turned out great.  It is a great base recipe to play with when you have limited ingredients.  I used 1 c milk and a 1/2 c sour cream (that I wanted to use up), cheddar/jack cheese, and asparagus.  I can't wait to make it again with bacon.  Very good!  Thank you!

My husband and I loved this recipe. It was super easy and tasted great. The only problem we had was trying not to eat the whole thing between just two of us! I did use cheddar instead of swiss and added some canned ham to beef it up a bit. Greta recipe!

So good! I have a really hard time convincing myself to eat vegetables, but this recipe made them taste great. It is great just as it is, but I am still exciting to try adding different things.

Unfortunately I'm neutral on the rating because the edges where the bacon and cheese seem to have migrated to, taste really good. The middle taste like bland egg pudding. I may try again and use bisquick or pancake mix to get a different texture and see if that makes a difference.

Like others, I used what I had in the cupboard ... and made it my own. GREAT idea for the pancake flour ... all out of Bisquick, so that was a plus !! I sauteed onions, garlic and celery, blanched some fresh asparagus with frozen peas, added more cheese ( a mix of Gruyere and Jack ), added heavy whipping cream instead of milk, put in 1/2 can of diced tomatoes (strained) and mixed the whole thing up. Bravo to all those who contributed and made this a keeper for me !!

This was great! I made it 2 weeks ago for my fiance and I. We took the leftovers up for a ski trip the next day and it was even better the 2nd day. Since I live in Colorado (altitude issues) and was using a 9 inch round glass baking dish. I had to add about 20 minutes of baking time, but it was fantastic. I used Colby/Jack, but will try Swiss next time, and maybe a bit less Onion.

This just didn't work for me.  I didn't care for the bread like texture.  Also wasn't crazy about the flavor.  My husband who is an egg lover didn't like it either.  My kids refused to eat after tasting it.  Will stick to a more traditional quiche next time.

I changed this recipe around a bit, so I couldn't give it 5 stars because I didn't try it the original way. I made a mashed potato crust using instant potato mix brushed and baking with olive oil and then just mixed in the bacon and cheese. I will omit the butter next time so it's not as rich. I also used pancake mix in place of flour as one person in these reviews did. It rose so high! It came out fantastic!!!

OMG! I also modified the recipe by adding rice crust, celery and baby corn, carrots, broccoli, and snow peas, Kraft Mexican cheese blend, S & P, chipotle, garlic. Baked more than an hour. No sticky pans if you use PAM. AWESOME!

I brought this into work and got MANY compliments on it.  I made the following changes...substituted 1/3 cup diced ham for bacon, substituted 1/3 cup green pepper for onion, 2 tsp. of deli mustard for the 1 tsp. of salt, and 1/2 cup whole wheat pancake mix for the 1/2 cup of flour.

This was a mediocre recipe.  I found it odd that this recipe called for no seasonings whatsoever.  I used some, nonetheless and it was still way too bland.  I also poured it all into a crust, which is really the only way I'd make a quiche...otherwise it's more of a souffle, in my opinion.

This has now become my favorite quiche recipe.  I have made it three times without modifying the recipe and my family loves it!  I made it last night on our "breakfast for dinner" night and added frozen spinach on top of the bacon.  All I can say is YUM!

Great stuff! This is very close to the Quiche my grandma made when I was little. It was easy to make and the only thing I did different was adding a little garlic powder.

Three Stars. Because to me, It just don't taste as good as traditional quiche.  Of course this is a quick version, and it works. But I find the other just, as easy.  Now, for the positive side. =)  It's a good, quick, and easy recipe.  And it tastes not bad.  We ate it for breakfast, and Im going to eat it for lunch.  Thanks for this recipe. =)

holy moly, what a quick, convenient, good tasting recipe!!  if you take the basics of it, the egg, milk, flour, salt, and egg/cheese bottom, you can add anything to this to make it your own, and it tastes fantastic!!!  thank you!

This is the easiest quiche recipe I've ever tried. You can even add different types of fillings--blanched spinach, diced, cooked sausage or ham cubes. I also substituted 1/2 cup cream for part of the milk.

This was a very good recipe to build on.  I agree with the post that said they left out the butter.  I thought it was a little greasy and next time I make this I would definitely leave that out.  But I used ham instead of bacon and added mushrooms.  Thanks for the recipe!  I'll definitely make this again!

This isn't all it's cracked up to be.  I followed the recipe exactly and found this to be very bland and somewhat dry.  I made this for Christmas brunch and it was a complete flop.  Usually, the recipes with high ratings on here are good but NOT this one. Won't make this one again...

I was excited to try this because it got really rave reviews, but mine just turned out so-so.  I'm still giving it 3 stars because it was so-so, but nothing spectacular for the amount of time it took.  I also did change some things, so part of the ho-hum results were probably my fault.  First of all, I think the name "quick" is misleading -- it took me about a half hour to prepare this, but that was mostly because of pre-cooking the bacon, and I also added some chopped broccoli and chopped spinach (which had to be nuked in the microwave for a few minutes).  Also, I had that Saturday morning slow-start syndrome going, so again... maybe my fault.  Then, I had to cook it nearly an hour to get it to set up, and even then there were some parts which were "iffy," but the family was getting so hungry we went ahead and ate it anyways.  The only other changes I made were to halve the bacon, use whole wheat flour, and omit the onions since my hubby doesn't like them, and use cheddar (didn't have any swiss).  Overall, the taste was ok, but a little bland, and to me, the flour taste waaaay overpowered the eggs, but I take responsibility for that since I used whole wheat.  Maybe that made the difference.  I've made several different quiche recipes, but probably would not return to this one again -- all the flavor was on the bottom with the bacon and cheese, and the top was, again, flour-y tasting! :)  On the upside, we were so hungry by the time it was done, we gobbled it down anyways!

I've made this a handful of times in the past few months and love it! I've made a few healthy tweaks along the way too.  I use extra lean turkey bacon, 3 eggs and 2 egg whites, low fat/fat free cheese, and skim milk.  It turns out great every time and tastes even better!

Very easy and I modified it, too. I added chopped broccoli, cauliflower and carrots (California blend). I omitted the bacon, onions and butter and added one chicken breast, diced. I used cheddar and Parmesan for the cheeses. I used part pancake mix and part whole wheat flour.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was easy and tasted great.  I used 4 pieces of thick apple cinnamon bacon from the deli.  I also used white cheddar instead of swiss.  It took about 50 minutes to cook.  I look forward to making it again and adding ingredients.  It's perfect for me because I don't like pie crust.  Thanks for posting.

This is the first quiche I have ever made. It was absolutely delicious. Super easy and quick. Used cheddar, mozzarella,& parmesan cheeses instead of Swiss and added a few more spices like garlic, thyme, and pepper. I'm going to make it for a meeting next week! Thank you!

Awesome, quick and easy!!  I used pancake mix instead of flour and it turned out perfect.  Also, I only had cheddar cheese and turkey bacon on hand and it tasted fine.  Recipe definately leaves a lot of room for alteration.

Made this for a simple supper last night. Used gruyere cheese (that's what I had), and bacon.  I also added about 1 tsp hot sauce to batter.  I think I like it better than quiche with a regular pie crust and it's certainly eaay.  I will definitely make again.

This is a great recipe. Like others, I made a few changes to the recipe. I substituted 8 thin-sliced deli ham slices for the bacon, and substituted 2 oz of shredded Cheddar for half of the Swiss cheese. I also added 1/8 tsp of black pepper to the recipe, and decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp. I sauteed the onions in the butter in the microwave for a minute before adding to the other ingredients. Baked it for 40 min.  Our family loved it, with my husband declaring that it deserved "award-winning" status. Tasted great cold, too. Thanks for an excellent crustless quiche recipe.

This recipe is fantastic.  This recipe is so versatile!  I like quiche, but don't like eating the crust (not because I don't like the taste but because I know all of those calories are going to my hips.  I have made this recipe a few times with various "what-ever was left in the fridge" ingredients.  I have used deli ham and cheddar, then I used low fat mexican cheese and some frozen broccoli.  You can put just about anything in this recipe and it will turn out perfect.  I have even used half eggbeaters and half eggs and I always use skim milk and it sets just fine.  I love how a "crust" forms on the bottom from the cheese, but it isn't really a crust.

I love this recipe!  It's such a great way to make a meal out of eggs w/o just making a boring old fried egg or omelet.  I used caramelized onions I had in the fridge, bits of blue cheese, and beef bacon (I live in a Muslim country and can't get real bacon.  This looks and tastes quite different, but has a nice smoky flavor nevertheless).  I found it was saltier if the cheese and bacon were concentrated at the bottom, so for my second try at it, I mixed the bacon in with the rest of the ingredients, and I sprinkled the cheese on in the last few minutes, so it was bubbly on top instead of crusty on the bottom.  I guess it makes it more like an egg casserole, but whatever you call it, it's delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe that's easy and frugal, too! :)

Turned out very well! I only used 1/2 the amount of bacon and sprinkled paprika on the top prior to putting in the oven. I think next time I'll use a little less butter. Served with a spinach salad this was a tasty, easy dinner.

This was a very good crustless quiche. I lined the bottom of the pie plate with cheese like it said, added green chilis instead of onion, broccoli, and mushrooms and then baked it for longer (like 50 mins) and the cheese was crispy on the bottom, making a nice tasty thin crust. It was so easy, I will make again.

Great basic recipe.  What I mean, a great foundation to add or delete whatever ingredients you want.  This will definately be on my list to use frequently.  Quick, fast and usually I have all ingredients on hand.  Thanks

Excellent!  I followed this recipe exactly and it was fantastic.  Even my picky 9 year old loved it!  I did have to bake it for an additional 5 minutes.  Will definitely make this again and again.

Wonderful and simple - I took it into work and people ate it all up. I made the following changes: used four strips turkey bacon, low-fat sharp cheddar cheese, margarine, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.

It was a good, QUICK meal. Preparation was no time!  Changes to the recipe: Added Italian Sausage instead of bacon. Then I put mozzarella and cheddar instead of swiss. My fiance loved it! We ate it for dinner and he ate the leftovers for Breakfast!

This was awesome. I did make some changes though. Used sliced cheese instead of shredded. Layered that on the bottom, then put the bacon crumbles. Added another light layer of cheese. Added a layer of lean honey ham (ripped into pieces). Added the egg mixture (used Southwestern Egg Beaters) and substituted onion powder for onions. Served with Sri Racha (kickin chicken) sauce. It was a hit!

This is just awesome and quick.  My family loves quiche but doesn't like the crust. This is the perfect fix.

You don't need to change anything except to season to taste.  

If you are a bit heavy with the bacon and cheese, you may need to add more eggs/milk to cover.

We do sometimes add steamed veges.

A standing ovation! Fewer carbs & less work, I didn't miss the crust at all while inhaling my piece!  I used Gruyere cheese, which gave it a more sophisticated  flavor. Then, because I was in a real hurry, I used jarred minced onions and real Hormel bacon bits.  No one had any idea I hadn't slaved over this one!

Great, quick recipe with so many variations!  Made this one for my boys last night and used diced ham, broccoli and a mixture of shredded cheddar/mozz.  I left out the onions and didn't add the butter to the mixture.  Cooked for almost 40 mins then just broiled the top a bit.  Hubby and I had leftovers tonight and it was fantastic...I especially like that there was no crust as that part alone can add a ton of fat and calories!!!

So easy!  I omitted the butter and using a glass dish, didn't grease the bottom at all.  I also love onions, so I added more directly, no pre-cooking needed as long as it's diced into small pieces.  I didn't have Swiss, so I used some mixed shredded cheese and crumbled Gouda, and it turned out great.  Will make again soon with cherry tomatoes and other vegetables.

EXCELLENT, AND SO EASY TO COOK, AND CLEAN UP AFTERWARDS. IT MAKES ENOUGH FOR TWO DINNERS! IT TASTES BETTER WITH HAM THEN BACON INSIDE IT, ONIONS ARE NOT NEEDED FOR GOOD TASTE IN THIS ONE. THE SECOND TIME I MADE WAS BETTER THEN THE FIRST BUT NO COMPLAINTS OF IT FROM ME OR MY MOM. WHEN I FIRST DID THIS I NEVER MADE A QUICHE BEFORE BUT THIS ONE IS EASY. YOU SHOULD TRY THIS RECIPE, FOLKS.

Made this for overnight company and they loved it.  They made sure they took a copy of the recipe.  Used left over grilled chicken and cheddar cheese instead of bacon and swiss.  This is a great recipe.  Very versatile.

Great quick recipe.  Removed the butter from the recipe and reduced the amount of milk to 1 cup to reduce the fat content.  Also used real bacon pieces rather than fried bacon to speed things up and then reduced the amount of salt to 1/4 to 1/2 tsp rather than 1 tsp to cut back on sodium.  Turned out great.  If you omit the butter, could brush the top with melted butter to provide browner topping.

This was awesome. First quiche I ever made. I chopped up some fresh sausage to substitute for the bacon, and added a handful of chopped red & green peppers which made it look real pretty. Thanks for making my and my GF's Saturday brunch great!

This was excellent.  I left out the teaspoon of salt, and it turned out perfect.  The bacon made it plenty salty.  I didn't have swiss cheese so used cheddar and it was wonderful.  This is a versatile recipe, just about any cheese or veggie (such as mushrooms, shallots, spinach, broccoli or? ) would work well.  If you don't put in a salty meat, such as ham or bacon, I would add the salt.

This was not only my first time making but also eating Quiche.  My husband loves quiche and asked me to make him one.  He prefers crustless, so I tried this recipe.  He LOVED it!  Said it was the best he's ever had.  I did make a few changes.  I used left over rotisserie chicken that I cubed and added to the cheese and bacon on the bottom.  I also used a small onion, and some left over steamed broccoli.  I really liked this quiche!  Very tasty!

Great recipe.  This made a wonderful, hearty Sunday brunch and was so easy.  I used cheddar and pepperjack cheeses (the pepperjack was amazing) and added bell pepper because I put it in everything.  I cooked it a little longer, but it probably would have been fine at 35 minutes.  Cooking it a little longer did give it a delicous, crispy top.  I will make this one again!

I like bread, so I went ahead and used a pie crust.  This was good, thanks for the recipe.

I made this for a brunch gathering of friends and it was a big hit. I did one with ham & cheddar (no onion), and one with bacon, onion & mozzarella, using extra onion. Even my picky 5 yo loved it! Very easy, quick and delicious. I will definitely make this again.

Great easy recipe.  This is not for the dressed up, fancy quich Lorraine lovers out there, but makes an excellent quick easy lunch or supper, and easy to adapt to many different tastes by adding different veggies, meats or cheeses.  Thanks for this keeper.

So easy, so tasty. I LOVE this recipe! I've made it a ton with different "fillers". Chicken, basil, cashews, tomatoes, and cheddar cheese instead of the bacon and Swiss is my fave. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very, very good!  I prefer it without bacon though.  And I always use green onions, which I sautee in the butter before adding.  A super terrific quick tasty dinner!

OMG I really enjoyed this!!! I was nervous about it because there was no crust and I love the crust but the flour in the mixture really does it justice. I did have to cook it longer than the recipe called for but thats ok and I also used spicy Italian sausage instead of bacon. Delish!!

This was pretty good.  I used the basic recipe, and changed the filler to suit our tastes.  Ham, cheese, and sauteed onion worked very well.  But, I do miss having a "crust".  A combination of spinach, artichoke hearts, sauteed onion, and sauteed mushrooms... not so good.  If you don't use bacon or ham, remember to add WAY more salt and pepper.  The vegetable version was pretty bland.  Both of my quiches turned out pretty buttery... be sure to account for the extra butter you use to saute any fillers and cut back accordingly.

I'm not much of a cook, so I thought I was really going out on a limb trying to make a quiche.  This recipe was so easy, and delicious though, that I have made it over and over.  I have used sausage instead of bacon in it as well, which I liked even better than the bacon.

Very tasty and easy but I would recommend less milk because after the 35 minutes it was still a little too milky.

Everyone loved this! I used this recipe as a guide in making 2 quiche. Some tweaking I made included using a crust, turkey bacon, broccoli, cherry tomatoes (diced) and cheddar and mozzarella cheese. I also had to bake them for about 1.25 hours. Wonderful!

I tend to shy away from quick recipes, but this one has great flavor, is unbelievably simple to make, and lends itself to lots of variations. Next time I'll add a bit of nutmeg and try low sodium bacon. Definitely a great addition to my recipe box.  Thanks for sharing!

This was good but had too many onions for me. I did change a few things. I didn't have swiss cheese so I used cheddar and parmesan. Next time I will also add other veggies like mushrooms and maybe some spinach.

This is an ok recipe. It was great not having to spend as much time preparing as a normal quiche. However, it was quite bland. I'm partial to traditional quiche with a crust though. I think if one were to add another meat, half & half and veggies, it would give it the added flavor it needs.

Huge hit with the family.  I agree with the other reviewers that you can just use what ever "filling" you like.  I put some spinach in the blender and then mixed in a little already cooked bacon crumbles and it was great!

loved it. my hsband found is a bit too soggy,b ut i think it's just the perfect quiche. I did use a LOT less bacon tho, gouda cheese, less milk and no salt added, caus ethe first one i made was just way too salty, had to throw that one out. But with the less salt, it's awesome.

Fantastic
I made the bacon a little too crispy so will adjust next time.  I also used semi-skimmed milk powder with water.  Lovely recipe.  Thanks
