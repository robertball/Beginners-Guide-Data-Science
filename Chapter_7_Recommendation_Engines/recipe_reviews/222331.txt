Oh Chef John, your reputation precedes you!  From your how-to videos to your numerous published recipes, you've earned your title.  I was craving Summer and happened to find this recipe, and while  I don't have end of season tomatoes yet, this gazpacho turned out incredibly.  If you love to cook, but take satisfaction in the preparation of the dish, then try this recipe.  I had some time on a Saturday afternoon all to myself to create, and chopping the vegetables was a great source of relaxation.  I felt like a character in a movie (have you ever seen Julia & Julia?) while I was preparing this soup.  OK, maybe that's a bit dramatic, but the finished product is DELICIOUS!  Don't be intimidated by the steps, and here is a great tip from the video--to peel tomatoes easily, dip them in a pot of boiling water for a few seconds.  You'll be able to pull the peel off easily before dicing them.  THANKS for a wonderful, fresh, healthy recipe!  I can't wait to share this with my friends.

This might be one of my favorite recipes of all time.  Delicious, simple to make and tastes as good or better the next day.  I've already had 5 people ask me for the recipe.  I made this over the weekend and I am now making it again for an end of school party on Friday for the teachers.  I didn't change a single thing in this recipe.  This is an absolute MUST try recipe.  On a side ntoe - I served this for dinner, but I also served it for brunch along with a southwestern breakfast casserole and it worked very well together.  Thank you again Chef John - your flavor combinations are ALWAYS spot on!

WOW! As a registered nutritionist and personal chef  I always look for healthy foods that are quick to make and great tasting. Just last Friday I held a workshop at our local Cancer Center and wowed the participants. This recipe is quick and easy to prepare and has great texture and taste.  Thank you Chef John!

After trying Chef John's Gazpacho a few days ago I have now pitched my own recipe of over 20 years! Yes folks it is true! You can teach an old dog new tricks or new recipes anyway. ;)
I made no changes to it and my family and friends loved it! Gazpacho can be time consuming to make but John's isn't but 45 minutes and viewing his video to make it makes it all the more easy. Plus his voice is so relaxing to me! ;)
The only thing I added was a cucumber slice and a dollop of Daisy Sour Cream to the top of each serving. 
Bon appetit!

SHUT THE FRONT DOOR PEOPLE! This soup is phenomenal. Who knew that a simple, cold, tomato summer soup could taste like this? I'd all but given up but this recipe showed up in my inbox and I thought "what the heck, we'll try one more gazpacho recipe." SO THANKFUL I DID!!! and I'm sorry to say I did change one thing. I did not see the 4 tomatoes called for first thing. so I got home and had all the rest of the ingredients but not those. So-what to do??? I followed the rest of the directions and then added 2 cups of low-sodium V8. This soup is amazing. I'm letting it chill now as I write but it already tastes so good I know this is going to be a once-a-weeker for the rest of the summer! and I am doing great things for my body!!! also I didn't strain the blenderized cherry tomatoes. and I used 1/4 of a yellow onion and blenderized that with the cherry tomatoes. I'm coming in with a spoon, boys, and y'all better get out of the way!!!!

This was amazing- the time was worth it. I gave up on the straining and put all the "chunks" of the cherry tomato pur√©e in with the rest of the soup, but I don't see a problem at all with the texture. I also used a lemon instead of a lime. Other than that, I followed all the directions and the video! And here's my secret: I used supermarket tomatoes. Who knows, it might taste better with real vine ripened tomatoes, but it still tastes great either way!

Made this with fresh veg from my garden. Left out the cayenne and the jalapeno so my young son could eat it. Also left out the lime as our tomatoes were bright enough without. My son didn't care for the raw onion, and my husband and I decided I should dice the onion a lot smaller next time (I used my vitamix to chop the veg). I was, however, very pleased with the flavor. I think I might go heavier on the cumin and oregano next time, just to play up the Spanish influence. I made some biscuits to go with (didn't have time to make bread) and that was dinner. It was delicious. Our cherry tomatoes are candy-sweet, and the big yellow tomatoes were very mild and relatively low acid. So this ended up on the sweet end of the spectrum, which really suited me very well. I think it will be even better tomorrow.

Never had Gazpacho. Didn't think I would like a cold soup. I was surprised to find this is absolutely delicious. I didn't have farm tomatoes, so I used on the vine ones from the supermarket and added 1/4 of a mango for sweetness. So good, savory, and lite. Will eat again.

Best gazpacho I have ever tasted. My friends were wowed by it! Diced avocados and a touch of sour cream really enhanced the beauty and taste. This will be my go to hot summer day recipe.

This certainly wasn't a Gazpacho recipe that I enjoyed. Perhaps the tomatoes weren't ripe enough, I don't know. Either way, it wasn't bursting with flavor. I also couldn't get past the blended/pureed tomatoes, it didn't look appealing at all. My kids and wife tried it and didn't like it either. I was a bit disappointed, perhaps I should be more disappointed with the lack of fresh/flavorful produce in my area.

WOW!  Made the gazpacho yesterday and had it for dinner this evening.   Can't say enough good things about it....I thought my gazpacho recipe was good...but this one is way better.  I added one clove more garlic and a tad more vinegar, plus a pinch more cayenne ... and this was absolutely perfect.  I think the cumin makes this gazpacho unique.  And don't forget the sliced basil when serving ... definately makes a difference.  Although Chef John doesn't like "wet bread" on the soup, I top the soup with croutons ... a few at a time while eating... as I like a little "crunch" to my soups.  I'll be making this great soup often during the summer months.  Also ... unlike other gazpacho recipes which add tomato juice or V-8 juice (as mine did) ... rely on fresh veggies such as very ripe tomatoes for the flavor you crave.  Also, I didn't strain out the pureed cherry tomatoes .. didn't notice much difference and added additional bulk to the end product.  Thanks Chef John!

My favourite thing about Allrecipes.com is reading reviews on how different people put their own spins on recipes to suit their individual taste, but this recipe is absolutely perfect as is. Followed the recipe exactly and was a HUGE hit at a potluck dinner, wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks!

Awesome! I used more cherry tomatoes to cpmpensate for the lack sweetness in the other tomatoes.  I also added an extra clove of garlic and doubled the balsamic vinegar and worchester for a little extra tang and to contribute to the salt. I will make this very often.

Yum! I have never made Gaspacho and I don't think I have ever even heard of it.  I had excess tomatoes in the garden and found this recipe, hoping I would like cold tomato soup.  I LOVE it!  I followed the recipe to a tee and it turned out perfect.  Thank you so much Chef John!  I really enjoyed your video on the recipe as well.

Wow! I moved away from Spain a few years ago and have been experimenting (badly) ever since to find a great gazpacho recipe.   I was skeptical about including jalape√±os and green spring onions, but I'm glad I stuck to the recipe.  The best Gazpacho I've ever had. 

I've since tried this recipe with some additional water, as well as taking the lazy option and just throwing everything a bowl and blending. Delicious!

Thanks Chef John!!!

Completely addictive. I'm not much of a raw tomato fan, but this is awesome!. I think I will even try completely blended for a Bloody Mary base. Didn't peel the tomatoes because I like the extra fiber and I just used a regular cucumber(peeled) and tomatoes. Didn't strain anything either. I did substitute Steak Sauce for the  Worcestershire Sauce as I'm allergic to fish.Super good!

Pretty much my first real attempt at gazpacho, having nothing to compare it to (save salsas and spaghetti sauce) Modifying ingredients only slightly; upon my first taste I WAS BLOWN AWAY!!! A symphony of flavors orchestrated perfectly for pallet! I'm hooked... it...another addiction to feed.

The vegetable prep takes more time than the "throw everything in a blender gazpacho recipes but it's worth it!  The cold temperature of the soup contrasts nicely with the spice from all the different peppers. The flavor is amazing.  The best part is the video showing veg prep and how to make the soup more or less chunky according to your taste.

Amazingly delicious!  My husband is not a fan of Gazpacho, but he truly loved this!  There is absolutely no substitute for using only fresh tomatoes; do not substitute V8 or tomato juice!  What a find!  Thank you, Chef John.

The tomato skins didn't loosen as much as hoped with a minute in boiling water.  I want to try leaving them a little longer next time.  My friends LOVED this recipe as the starter for our annual basil banquet.  They took almost all the leftovers away from me.  (I wish I could serve them in smaller bowls so I'd have more left for me the next day.)

Amazing recipe, and no, I did NOT have super sweet/fresh end-of-summer produce (just Wal-mart's) and it was STILL fantastic!  The few changes I made were: used a food processor instead of a blender, left the peels on for the chunks (tomato & cucumber) switched the tomoatos-used cherry tomatoes for the chunks and the large peeled tomatos for the pur√©e.  Also, the other half of the cucumber (peeled)  and the rest of the red bell pepper went in with the pur√©e too! (And increased the evoo & balsamic slightly as well, to match the veggie amount.)  Next time I'll make a fresh loaf of bread to go with it!

definitely satisfied my crazy pregnancy cravings for VEGGIES!!!

This is wonderful!  I made it yesterday with tomato from my garden and it was simple and easy. I followed the recipe but I added a tbsp of sugar to combat the acid in the tomatoes. This is a keeper. It is very refreshing on a hot day.

This was fabulous! I eliminated the red bell pepper just because I didn't have any around. I simplified the process by not bothering to peel the tomatoes or strain anything, and did it all in the food processor. 

I sarted with step 2 and poured it all into my separate bowl. Then went back to step one and started with the jalepeno, garlic, and seasonings to get those the finest. Then added the green onion and cucumber until pretty chunky. (Bell pepper would have gone in here too.) Finally added the tomatoes till they were the right size. Poured it into my bowl, did a quick mix, and poured some back to the food processor to do the final puree- not even sure that step was necessary! 

We got everything necessary in our CSA box again this week, so I'll be making more soon!

Hands-down, this is the BEST gazpacho recipe I've ever tried! Incredibly flavorful with a fantastic balance of flavors and the perfect consistency. Definitely worth the bit of time. Make a day ahead so the flavors develop.

I used LOTS of tomatoes about 15-20.  By the time the pulp was pureed and seived, it was about 6 cups. I used about 2 quarts of cherry tomatoes also.  The recipe doesn't say how many servings it made, but I don't know what I would have done with only 4 tomatoes. I did everything else  according to the recipe.  I thought is was very oniony flavored, but I liked it.  This recipe served a luncheon for about 6 bowls of soup.  We decorated the tops with crumbled bacon, feta, grated parmesan, and avocado chunks.  Really a nice looking soup.
September 22, 2015
I made this again, following the recipe exactly.  I'll have to recant my first review.  It was just perfect, still oniony, which I like.  The amount of tomatoes was correct, so I must have done something wrong the first time, like sieving out too much pulp.  This is so good with big, bold flavors.

Super soup! I added purslane (yes the weed) and omited the jalapeno pepper.  To save all the juices I de-seeded the tomatoes into a mesh colander over a bowl so as not to wast any of the yummy tomato juices.

I didn't have any cherry tomatoes, so I used extra garden tomatoes. I also didn't strain after blending and it was delicious!

My daughter has refused to try gazpacho before and LOVED this.  I used supermarket ingredients but  can't wait to try it with the farmer markets ingredients.  

I made has instructed (doubled recipe).  Was better the next day.

Excellent! Had my first bowl as Pablo Sandoval (vegetarian, baseball player) hit a home run. Enough said. Replaced the cherry tomatoes with puree because the acid in cherry tomatoes causes sores for me. (Don't do this!) In the future I would probably do juice instead of puree. For those of you who don't have this problem, this recipe is perfect. I thought I wouldn't taste enough cucumber or bell pepper but they are well represented.  Be sure to patiently chill this dish for hours; the key to the blending of great flavors. Can't wait to eat it again tomorrow, outdoors in 85 degree heat. It's the bomb!

This was GREAT!  Took a lot of time to chop, and made quite a mess in my kitchen (but I tend to be quite messy all the time), but the results were terrific, and made a very big batch!  I didn't have a jalape√±o pepper...put a few drops of hot sauce, but we don't like much spice, so it was just fine without.  I may add a bit more lime juice when I have it for lunch tomorrow. Try it...you'll like it!

After reading the reviews, had to try making this. I used my mother in law's recipe for 25+ years. Done with that. This is the only recipe for me. We loved it!!!  I didn't peel the tomatoes and didn't add Worcester sauce because we are doing whole30 diet. Awesome!!!!

Yum yum yum. I cheated and used one can of mild Rotel in place of some of the tomatoes since I didn't have quite enough fresh, and it still turned out lovely! Thank you for such an easy, healthy and delicious recipe. Did I mention this is a great base for Bloody Marys? :)

The best gazpacho I've had.  I added a bit (maybe a tsp or 2) of Old Bay Seasoning which is my secret ingredient for most things - rounded out and savored up the flavor a bit and was absolutely delicious.  If you don't like celery/celery salt, though, don't use the Old Bay.

Excellent!  I did use store bought vine tomatoes because it's too early in the season for the farmers market.  So, I added a little bit of suger to the puree.  The video was very helpful; and I always enjoy Chef John's easy explanation and great sense of humor :-).  The next time I make this I will double the ingredients to share with more friends!

I had most of the ingredients to make this recipe so I only replaced green onions with white onions, and didn‚Äôt have cherry tomatoes and chili pepper either so I didn‚Äôt add those. It was so easy to make and so fresh and delicious even my 9 year old daughter loved it that asked me to bring some for school lunch.

Thank you Chef John!  This came out great.  I could eat the whole batch by myself.  I was about to give up on gazpacho as I have made it several times in the past with various recipes and never enjoyed it much but this is absolutely delicious.  I followed the recipe all the way until the end.  I worried that my chopping wasn‚Äôt fine enough so I pur√©ed all of it.  Next time I will try it the right way.

Another home run by Chef John.  This on-line recipe has changed since the June/July printed version which called for different tomatoes (4C cherry and 2 lge beefsteak).  It tasted great even with less than prime seasonal tomatoes.  Leaving some tomatoes in sliced form instead of puree-ing all of them added a good substance to the soup instead of being all liquid.

I love gazpacho but have never found a fabulous recipe. When you pur√©e the cherry tomatoes, olive oil and balsamic it changes the color to a dirty orange, not at all attractive . I used fresh produce from my garden but it lacked flavor. I can find a better use for the abundance of tomatoes I have.

I just loved it and I think the worteshire sauce and balsamic vinegar really gave it a great flavor. I ate mine the first night with halibut ceviche and had some French garlic bread on the side the next night.  I will for sure make this scrumptious recipe again.  Thank you so much Chef John!

I prefer this more like a salad.  Less puree, more veggies.  Overall works well.

This recipe is so amazing. I've made it 5 times now. It's very time consuming but my husband loves it so much, I make it for him. One thing that saves time is to not chop everything but just put it all in the Nutri Bullet.

Lots of peeling and chopping but am delighted with the results.  I left it too late to prepare, so stuck it in the freezer for 45 mins + last 15 mins in freezer so I could serve it on time at dinner!  My guests loved it.

I discovered this recipe several years ago and can't wait until tomatoes are in season to make it again each year. It is absolutely one of my favorite dishes of all time. It's now a tradition for back-to-school lunch for my teaching partner and I, since I take it in to share with her. Amazing recipe. You won't regret making this!

There is never ever any of this soup thrown out.  I drink it for breakfast.  I've turned lunk headed veggie haters onto this stuff and they LOVED it and are constantly wanting me to make this for all get togethers.

Cannot get enough of this soup.  We love you Chef John the real one!!

Made it, cooked some shrimp, chilled both and served the next day.  Other than adding a bit of cayenne before serving, it needed nothing to be perfect.  It was the best gazpacho I'd ever made!  Thanks for the recipe!

So much fun to make when you have everything you need in the garden! The only thing I had to buy was green onions. My jalape√±o was extra hot, so I had to balance it out with an extra cucumber.  That seemed to help.  Topped with sour cream to also give some coolness. It was delicious on a hot summer night!

As usual with Chef Johns recipes, Outstanding!!  This is truly amazing, and actually quite easy to make compared to most Gazpacho recipes.  Made it yesterday, and just made another batch now; the only change I made today is I swapped out red wine vinegar for the balsamic and used about 3 Tablespoons.  Thats just a matter of personal taste.  I grow my own Heirloom tomatoes, and I have to agree the tomatoes make all the difference!!

I followed the recipe according to Chef John.  The only thing different I did was, I added all of the ingredients together and blended them.  It was a personal preference.  It tastes VERY good and I'll be making this again.

I think the ingredients are a good start, but a lot of time can be saved if you use canned peeled and diced tomatoes. 

Also, I felt that having so many ingredients solid might make the consistency less like a gazpacho, so I pureed everything together. It was very tasty that way and the flavors really blended well together.

I followed the recipe with the use a significantly less jalape√±o since I cannot handle spicy. I found it to be missing flavors that I wanted in a gazpacho the first time I made made it but this is a great base for the second time around. I added celery, more garlic, used red bell peppers, additional cucumber and more balsamic vinegar. I also like to garnish chopped ingredients for additional texture.

I added about a cup of salsa and hot sauce to taste. Also used sweet onion instead of green onion. The recipe was a little bland for me as written but these additions made it perfect.

That is an amazing recipe and I will definitely make it again. I added a little more garlic- just because we love garlic.  I used a variety of tomatoes just picked from the garden.  I will be making this again this week since our garden is very productive this year.  Thanks, Chef John!

Very tasty! I used coconut aminos instead of Worcestershire sauce and I didn‚Äôt add cayenne and instead served hot sauce on the side. I got lots of compliments! And whoops I forgot the olive oil and didn‚Äôt miss it and added extra lime juice. I didn‚Äôt bother with straining or peeling and it was fine.

This is amazing!  Made as directed, but I didn't measure anything.  I probably blended a little more than 1/3.  Let it sit for a full day and serve ice cold.  On my 2nd batch in as many days...  so good!

Lots of chopping :-) ... but definitely worth it! Made this for a family function as a first course. After making before refrigerating, I was a little concerned that it was too thin. After refrigerating 24 hours it thickened up to a perfect consistency and was a big hit! Thanks Chef John!

Easy to make, just a little tedious with all the slicing and dicing. I wound up refrigerating it overnight because my dinner plans changed at the last minute. It was very tasty! I am on a low-salt diet, and if you're on low salt, you might want to increase the other spices. I would definitely add at least a teaspoon of cumin. I used more cayenne because I like spicy-hot food. The basil tasted so good with the soup I thought it might taste good as part of the soup. Maybe I'll try that when I make this again.

We made two batches - one as written and one with two small changes. 
   We did not feel that the olive oil added anything to the end product (and even seemed to ‚Äúmuddy‚Äù the flavor a bit) except slick lips so we left it out on our second batch which resulted in much cleaner, crisper flavors. 
    We also substituted cilantro in place of the basil and pur√©ed some in as well in our second batch. 
   If you like cilantro, give this a whirl...so to speak.

Loved this recipe. Easy to make and ended up sharing it with about 6 guests who just had to have it. I've had Gazpacho in Spain, this is just as good.

The problem with this recipe is that there are no bread crumbs included. Gazpacho actually should have some  bread crumbs of some sort. There are other types of gazpachos in Spain as well, Gazpacho Manchego, Gazpacho Jumillano. These are hot plates with meat, and unleavened bread crumbs or better said, pieces. That's why people may enjoy this style but others may be disappointed in the overall taste and texture.

Excellent! I used ripe heirloom tomatoes and followed the recipe exactly. Made  the day before our dinner, the soup had plenty of time for the flafors to marinate and it was deliciously cold.  Served it with with diced black olives, and avocado, feta crumbles and garlic croutons for toppings.  A definite do-again!

My whole family loved it. I pretty much stuck to the recipe. I accidentally added 1 TBSP of Worcestershire sauce instead of 1 tsp. It was an accident but turned out fine. I also used fresh oregano from my garden. Those were the only changes. I‚Äôve made this twice so far and it goes in no time. It‚Äôs healthy and we love it. Thanks Chef John! Love your recipes and your videos :)

Chef John comes through yet again!  This is a winner. 
OK if you don't have fresh from the garden tomatoes, at least go with Marzano tomatoes.

Very good!!  I used Mexican oregano and added fresh cilantro in the blender and on top with the basil because I LOVE cilantro.  Followed recipe other than this and loved it for a great light but satisfying work lunch.  I‚Äôll definitely make this again.  Thank you for another great recipe, Chef!

This is a very delicious gazpacho and worth all the prep!  The only thing I changed was to omit the jalapeno pepper.  With the cumin and cayenne, it was tasty enough!  You must try this, especially with the bounty of end of Summer tomatoes!

Very good gazpacho.  I make this every year with all my fresh garden veggies.  I add all the ingredients listed except I'm lazy and I add everything at once to the food processor  and pulse until it's the desired consistancy.

I substituted a bulb of roasted garlic for raw garlic. I added a teaspoon of sugar. This is delicious and yes, probably dependent on the flavor of the tomatoes.

Excellent. I made about 3/4 of the recipe with fresh ripe red and yellow tomatoes, cucumbers, and jalapeno from my garden. I used a stick blender to blend the cherry tomatoes, etc., in a mason jar, then used it again to spot-blend the batch.  Served with goat cheese on crostini, which was delicious. Our 12-year-old son told me he loved it. Thank you for the recipe!

As suggested I waited until the tomatoes here in Pennsy were freshly picked and at peak flavor.  Chef John's version of this classic was full of flavor and refreshing. Adding the cherry tomatoes just brings deeper tomato flavor to the bowl. I may play around with the herbs next time by trying fresh thyme or tarragon instead of the oregano or basil. I might play with the heat level by trying different peppers or spices. But just because I like to play not because it needs any changes.  Thank you, Chef, for another wonderful recipe!

I substituted the jalape√±o for 3 medium tomatillos. I really like the tomatillos flavor and I know the jalape√±o has a heat that builds with storage. Since it was pretty zippy with just the cayenne, I knew I made the right choice.

I also really appreciate that this recipe does not add chunks of bread to thicken it (I don‚Äôt need the extra carbs), it has a wonderful texture all by itself. I garnished with a sprig of cilantro instead of basil. 

My husband has already asked for a repeat performance for this summer treat so I will definitely be making it again.

Have been making this with some personalization  for years.

The original recipe  was for double the quantity and this freezes beautifully .

The changes I use from the original are,

* I don't peel but only core the tomatoes as I sieve the result.

? I use spring onions ( but this maybe English v US terminology) and use a bunch as not sure about cups.

* I like a contrast between cold and spicy heat so don't seed the hot peppers.

* An English chef, Jason Atherton, softens (I slightly more) the   
peppers, bell peppers,  basil, garlic and spices in a pan with some olive oil. This I blend into the cold mixture with other ingredients and leave, preferably overnight in the refrigerator.

I then sieve heavily so that there is a thick texture and any remaining skin and seeds are not noticeable.

Delicious with maybe a fresh basil or mint garnish.

Instead of a jalape√±o, I used half a poblano pepper. I left out the cayenne and the lime, because I forgot (I didn't miss them). I also just put everything in my NutriBullet and pulsed for a split second and it is perfect! Since my husband isn't a fan of cold soup, I can make this for myself anytime I want. So good!

Love it! My chef-like husband was initially dubious with some of the ingredients in this treat I (the cook) had made for us, but then really enjoyed...even more the next day! I can‚Äôt wait until I get the REALLY good late summer jersey tomatoes!

Only change I made was one extra clove of garlic and I used 6 Roma tomatoes rather than 4 large regular tomatoes and two Roma tomatoes ??  instead of a pint of cherry tomatoes since that‚Äôs what I  had i on hand. Delicious and I will absolutely make it again. Best gazpacho ever!!!

BOO YA! used 1/2 of the cumin, no jalapeno on hand, and Vidalia onion instead of the green onions. Added a can of black beans for protein. This is a keeper!

Best gazpacho EVER!!! I lost my old recipe that everyone loved. Came across this masterpiece of flavor in the hunt for one like my old one. This isn‚Äôt anything like my old recipe it‚Äôs one hundred times better. We grow sweet 100‚Äôs and all veggies came fresh from our garden right before making. I never thought to use cherry tomatoes in gazpacho it made it o so good. I made this six times over the summer. I kept meaning to take some to my mother in law. But since I like to make gazpacho a day before planning on eating. Everyone kept sneaking bowls and it never made it to day two.

This is so good! Gazpacho is my husband's favorite. He absolutely loved this. I did get halfway through and realize that I had no cherry tomatoes, so I used a can of diced tomatoes and 2 cups of v8 (I doubled the recipe). I should have quadrupled it. It will go fast!

I spent  an hour making this today and it is by far the best recipe for Gazpacho I current have. It is a spicy, tasty dish. Well done. I used all organic ingredients, even the tomatoes. That make a big difference in taste.

I love Gazpacho!  I have made this several times and follow the recipe but I have also added some small cubes of watermelon at the end.  I think it is extra good with the watermelon.

This is excellent, Gazpacho.  Though I used every one of the listed ingredients and quantities, I didn't peel the tomatoes - I put the the lot into the food processor and pulsed until I got the texture I wanted.  The one thing I differed on is that I elt the need to add 2tsp sugar to reduce the acidity.  I served the soup with fresh-made crusty loaf of bread.  It was good on the 1st, the 2nd & the 3rd third day - today. Mmm mm good.  Thanks, Chef John.

Did as the recipe indicated as closely as possible.  It is more complex than other recipe , but I liked that it does not include tomato juice.  It came out great! Very tasty.  I am making it again tomorrow by request :)

I made it with 3 kinds of home grown tomatoes including Sun Gold for the cherry tomatoes. Very easy recipe using a Vitamix. The pur√©ed cherry tomatoes gave a wonderful creamy texture but this is a very healthy recipe. It was delicious and easy.

Didn't have cherry tomatoes so I used one extra garden tomato. Added about 3/4 cup of chopped watermelon at the end. Also great topped with avocado chunks and sour cream or yogurt.

I didn't use the balsamic, but subbed in rice wine vinegar. And used a fresh jalape√±o instead of the cayenne. Also I chop my veggies a bit bigger to start. Still very good! Very tasty!

Loved this recipe! Thanks, Chef John. I used only Roma tomatoes, substituting 2 for each large tomato and 2 for the pint of cherry tomatoes. Also, since I'm lazy, I just threw all the ingredients into the blender and let it rip. For a slight variation, I added just a tiny pinch of sweetener...it soared!

This is an excellent, simple recipe. I used v8 juice instead & I opted to not blend together the veggies, I left them sliced & served it that way. My family loved it & it scored points with the coworkers. I will DEFINITELY make it again.

I made it but didn't peel the tomatoes, I just ninjaed 3 kinds of small fresh garden toms, so who knew and who cares basically no one  I know.  They all liked it anyway and me too.
If peeling tomatoes is done when you order it in a restaurant that's probably reflected in the price.
It was on a hot day that I made it and it did the trick quite  well with large tortillas for a snack by the pool!

OMG! I loved this.  However, the recipe wasn't enough for three, so I added some elbow noodles made from quinoa and corn.  The three of us ate it all. Sooo good.

I've never made this dish before. It was tasty but I'm not into cold soups. However, I was open to trying it. My son and husband liked it but it wasn't like grandma's. So, I have to give 3 stars since my family said it was "good." Sorry Chef John.

The current heat wave and bumper crop of tomatoes and basil in our garden inspired a search for a gazpacho recipe using fresh tomatoes vs. V8 juice.  This took some time to prep  but was definitely worth it.  Made it exactly as written except for omitting the jalapeno since it can overwhelm some taste buds and can be chopped and served on the side.  Make a trip to the Farmer's Market or Whole Foods to pick up locally grown tomatoes if you don't have them in the garden.  The flavorless refrigerated ones available in most grocery stores just won't cut it.  This will be our go-to gazpacho recipe from now on.  Perfect with a crusty baguette on a hot summer evening.

I didn't like it. However It was my first time having this type of dish. So I may just not be a fan of gazpacho in general. I just found it tasted like tomato juice with chunks of tomato floating in it but again like I said could just be me. On a good note it does seem to be extremely healthy.

Delicious.  I didn't have the time to follow the steps, but really wanted this soup. So I chopped up and peeled and took the seeds out of everything. Pulsed in the blender a few times. Served with a few croutons on top and a side of day old canteloupe and beets I grilled this weekend. Rave reviews, even from my kids!

This is a wonderful tasting and easy recipe.  This is the first time I have made gazpacho and was pleased with the consistency and flavor profile.  I got all my ingredients at our local farmer's market and followed the recipe to the letter.  I have given it four stars because, you never know, there might be a better recipe out there.  But, I will definitely make this again.

I made this yesterday with ingredients fresh from a local farm market and changed the recipe only by adding a few more tomatoes. The result was excellent and well received by the diners, including the one who said he "didn't normally like gazpacho"but loved this.A dollop of sour cream was a nice garnish.

Excellent! I made this with fresh from the garden tomatoes, cucumbers, and basil.  I also used pickled jalape√±os instead of fresh jalape√±os.  The four of us thoroughly enjoyed this dish!  Yummy!  We all feel it's the best Gazpacho we have ever had.

The hubby made a little fun of me for making 'cold soup'. After a bite, I'm starting to worry about hiding the leftovers! Very delicious for my first time gazpacho... hubby even suggested making it into a salsa!

I didn't care for the first gazpacho I had a few years ago and wasn't hopeful on this one. But this was definitely much better for my taste. I didn't peel the large tomatoes nor strain the pur√©e. We don't mind the chunks. I also omitted the jalape√±o as this was for a post wisdom teeth extraction meal. I would make this again for sure.

Holy cow! I've never had gazpacho before but being over-run with a ton of tomatoes I need something to do with them.  This soup is ah-mazing I will make it every time I have great homegrown tomatoes, Thanks Chef John!!

Delicious!  I made this tonight and it tasted fresh, flavourful, and healthy.  The only change I made was to cut the amount of oil in half to reduce the fat content, and I left out the pepper to make it child-friendly.  Even my picky toddler finished a bowl (I pureed his so he couldn't pick out the veggies).  My only comment would be that the serving size seems a little off to me (or maybe my tomatoes just weren't large enough) but the serving size for 6 was just barely enough for 2 adults and a toddler.  Otherwise it was great, and will definitely make again!

This gazpacho is the best ever.  We have tons of tomatoes fresh from the garden every summer and we make a batch of this every two days.  I use my garden tomatoes and the super sweet store bought cherry tomatoes.  The result is exceedingly fresh and delicious.  Also, Chef John is great.

This was a big hit at my house.  I made it as described except the straining part - that all went into the blender and it came out fine.  Next time I might try a green pepper instead of the red bell.

The best gazpacho ever.  I chopped 1 tomato and 1/2 a cucumber.  I tossed everything else in my Vitamix whole  and blended.  I added cilantro from my garden.  Mine looked a bit brown,  wondering if it was the cuc skin? Cilantro? Basalmic?  worchestershire? Anyway, it tasted fantastic!  Thank you, Chef John.

I followed the recipe except used juice of one lemon instead of lime because that's what I had.  I also used regular cucumbers (peeled) and a Vidalia onion in place of the green onions.  Absolutely delicious soup and just perfect for dinner on a hot summer night.  Thank you for providing such a winner.

This is perhaps the best gazpacho I've ever had! I left out the cucumbers and cumin, because I'm not a fan of either, and I only had one type of tomato in the house. It turned out perfect for my tastes.

This was quite good--I like the mix of chunk and puree, as well as the spiciness.  I just wish it were thicker!  Could be great with some toasted bread.

I love this recipe.  Served a double batch at a dinner party for eight last week with my heirloom and green zebra tomatoes, and it was a huge hit!  Grazi, Chef John!  Best recipe for gazapacho I've made yet.

This was very good gazpacho.  We love garlic, so I added a little more, but it was too much.  John's portions were right on.  I used a regular cuke, peeled it, and it turned out fine, in fact, I added some more and it was good.  We will definitely make this again this summer.  We're trying to do meatless Mondays, and this fits well with that plan.
