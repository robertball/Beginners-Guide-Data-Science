Not everyone liked the salad because of the quite original flavors, but those of us who loved blue cheese liked this salad tremendously!! I'm a big blue cheese lover, so this was the perfect salad for me. In the future, I'm planning on making a few modifications for those of us who don't like blue cheese, such as:
-Intead of blue cheese dressing, use Thousand Island Dressing. (A creamy kind.) and I plan to replace the cheese with crumbled feta. Also, for all the blue cheese lovers, I would recommend using crumbled blue cheese. Thanks for sharing! :)

THanks for all the good reviews! I came home from school starved one day and my husband was making dinner. He said 'Go ahead and fix you a salad' and I just started adding ingredients and came up with this really good combo. But I love blue cheese and if you aren't a blue cheese lover, it might not be your thing. Also, I have always added fruit to my salads for some reason---I love the pineapple or canned peaches and Ranch combo, and that might be an aquired taste, too. (:

This salad is very yummy.  I love the sweetness of the grapes against the tang of the blue cheese!  I added some tomatos from my garden because I love the combintation of tomato & blue cheese also.

YUMMY! One of my favorite salads! One tiny thing...it needs some texture so don't forget the sunflower seeds! I use ranch but I am going to try blue cheese now. THANKS for the great idea!~ :)

Wow - this salad was fabulous! Both my husband and I loved it! Easy and yummy!  (I used Maytag blue cheese and my husband used blue cheese salad dressing - both are great,)

Well, we discovered we don't like raw avocado! But, we did like the blending of the sweet grapes with the tangy blue cheese dressing. I forgot the 4-cheese blend on top, but I'm sure that would've been delicious. We added croutons for crunch, but sunflower seeds or toasted nuts would be good too. Thanks for the recipe, am always looking for new ways to incorporate more grapes into our meals without having to cover them in sugar!

YUMMY and EASY salad!  I followed the directions exactly and it was REALLY tasty!  Next time I think I will not use the shredded cheese to save some calories.

This was pretty good but it needed something like nuts or bacon bits too. The blue cheese was a bit overpowering though and seemed to dominate the dish. I used ranch dressing and added blue cheese chunks. I didn't like this enough to make it again though, sorry.

This is a tasty salad.  I had everything on hand except the Mexican cheese blend so I used blue cheese crumbles.  I liked the sweet grapes contrast to the tang of the blue cheese.  Much as I love avocado, I'm not sure it did much but make the salad taste richer.  Thanks for sharing, Dana

Very good flavor combination!  Used "Chunky Blue Cheese Dressing", pepper jack cheese, and omitted the avocado.  Served with steak and couscous wraps.

I have made something similar to this instead of grapes I diced a plum tomato with feta cheese and seafood, usually shrimp and ranch dressing and definitely baby greens!

Loved this salad. Made it following recipe and it was delicious. The next time I made it, I had some pistachios on hand so tossed them in, yummy!
