Ive made this twice and find it refreshing.  These are my modifications: I use unsweetened almond milk, no ice, a frozen banana, (I keep a bag of peeled bananas in the freezer for smoothies.) Bob Red Mill unsweetened flaked coconut, about an inch of fresh ginger, and I used less honey - about a teaspoon. I used the persimmons, cinnamon, and nutmeg as directed.

I used frozen mango cubes rather than ice cubes and threw in a 1/2 cup of spinach for added nutrients.  Delicious way to use my past their prime persimmons!

I made it with soy milk.  While it was really good, I think I'll try it again with dairy.  Makes quite a lot.

Great smoothie. I used coconut milk to make it non-dairy, and no ice since that would make it too thick for my taste.

I didn't have any of the ingredients, so I just substituted with partially melted chocolate ice cream.  Honestly, I didn't have all the ingredients, so I used 1 persimnmon, the spices, about 1 C plain yogurt, honey, raw egg and orange/mango juice.  Tot fab!  : )
