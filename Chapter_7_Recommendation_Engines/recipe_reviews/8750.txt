I'm not sure how the reviewers who complained of "pink" sauce attained that color (maybe they forgot the chicken broth or maybe they didn't reduce the vinegar  ???) but mine was exactly the color as in the photo. I used minced red onions instead of shallots (I had a feeling the stronger onion flavor might enhance this dish & I was right) & evaporated milk for heavy cream  & I did add 3 cloves of minced garlic plus I used a homemade raspberry vinegar (from this site). I pulled mine off the heat after I added the milk for fear of it curdling like MollysMama's did. I had kept the chicken on warm in the microwave so I didn't need to reheat the chicken...I just mixed the pieces up in the sauce to coat them & then put them on a platter, drizzling what little of the sauce there was (next time I am doubling the sauce) on top.  I sauteed the breasts whole but after they rested for a few minutes, I sliced them into 3 slices each before adding them back to the sauce mixture. I served this w/ Oven Roasted Red Potatoes (from this site)....wish there had been more sauce,it was good on the potatoes & Bodacious Broccoli Salad (also from this site). This was a good recipe & I enjoyed the challenge of executing it well...thanks.

This is the first recipe I have made that I give 5-stars all around. I needed something to make with that raspberry vinegar I have. The sauce was so delicious, I think I will double the recipe next time. I served it with simple boiled/ browned potatoes and a green salad, to not take away from the fancy, rich sauce. My husband and kids loved it as much as I did! I had dinner on the table in 30 minutes!

This recipe is one of my top three recipes of all time. The sauce is flavorful and creamy--excellent! I usually make double the sauce and pour over potatoes and vegetables too. Thank you, Jill!!!

Made this, but instead of vinegar I used raspberry vinaigrette salad dressing, and 5% cream instead of heavy cream. It turned out fantastic.

Good base recipe! It just so happens that I was given some Raspberry Vinegar and was looking for something to cook with it! This is quite tasty - family enjoyed it! **********
I browned the chicken and then heated some spring onions and garlic (MUST have garlic!) in the remaining butter/oil - then added the stock & vinegar plus 1tsp cracked pepper, 1 tsp salt & 1tsp rosemary and stirred in the cream.  I then added the breasts back in and simmered for like 1/2 an hour until the breasts were infused with flavour and the sauce was reduced & thick.  Divine!
Very good meal with mashed potato & greens (peas or beans). TASTY! Thanks.\
~~~Oh yeah - my sauce was a lovely light brown in colour - no nasty red/pink so dont know what previous person was on about!

I doubled the, shallots, seasoned the chicken with a little garlic salt rather than adding the salt to the sauce. I increased the amount of liquid, and served it over home made pasta.
We Love it! Next time I will try it with fat free sour cream instead of heavy whipping cream to cut back on the fat.

Very enjoyable. The flavor is a winner. I'm a little confused by the ingredients list, it says 2 skinless boneless chicken breasts, but the recipe serves 4. I assume that means it's 2 "whole" breasts or 4 of what I usually find in the store for skinless boneless breasts. I may try to cut the fat by using fat free half and half or evaporated milk next time, but 1/3 cup of cream isn't too bad for 4 servings.

Even though I had to substitute (bone in) skinless legs and thighs for the bonless, skinless chicken breasts in this recipe, it was FANTASTIC! I prepared it for my husband and two grown sons and myself and it was a huge hit. Everyone had seconds or thirds and there were no leftovers at all. I have already got to the supermarket and got ingredients (boneless, skinless chicken breasts, this time!) so I can make it again this coming week. THANK YOU for posting this recipe!

This was quick, simple and delicious.  My husband asked me to keep making it.  I make double the sauce as we love it over rice.  Make sure that your vinegar is high quality as that is very important to the flavor of dish.  Yum.

Awesome! Made for a large party and cut the chicken breasts into strips so everyone could serve themselves some. I marinated the chicken in the raspberry vinegar with garlic before hand and then used garlic and green onions because I didnt have shallots. I also added mushrooms. Came out great and was very easy to do.

I made the recipe exactly as written. After tasting the sauce I felt there was too much raspberry vinegar. You may want to cut back on the raspberry vinegar at the start and then adjust to your taste.

This recipe is heavenly!  :D

I made a few minor changes, based on comments in the review section, but only to add to the 'bones' of this great script!

To augment, I added garlic to the red onion sauted prior to adding the chicken breast. 

I upped the quantity of all liquids to 1 cup, with the exception of I had no cream on hand.  Therefore, I made a rue with 1.5 Tablespoons flour, 1 Tb butter, salt and pepper, and thickened the 1 cup of milk in it, prior to adding it to the reduced broth/vinegar.

I also added a pinch of rosemary.

My raspberry vinegar came from Chapparal Gardens in Atascadaro, CA.  http://www.cgvinegar.com/

Absolutely DEElishious!  Thank you for sharing it!  :D

This was a good recipe for a nice twist on chicken breasts. I did double the sauce with the exception of the vinegar and family really enjoyed it. Will keep it in my box for something different and a good use of my raspberry balsamic!!!!

I made it for Valentine's Day.  Went over well with my boyfriend and the pink color of the sauce coordinated to Vday :)  I used less vinegar than the recipe called for and a bit more cream.  Turned out great! (Served over mashed potatoes and side of asparagus.)

I doubled the sauce except for the vinegar, which turned out well.  It takes forever for the sauce to thicken, so I also used some cornstarch.  Overall, it's an alright recipe.

Some of the ingredients I found hard to find but I substituted the RASPBERRY VINEGAR for a combination of CRANBERRY SAUCE and BALSAMIC VINEGAR and CREAM CHEESE for the WHIPPING CREAM.  Noice!

This is surprisingly good.  I suggest that the chicken be sliced into thin strips.  The wonderful fragrance adds to the enjoyment of this dish.

I suggest the Spinach Saute as a side, a nice match.

I'm rating this recipe with 4 stars because my girlfriend liked it, it was easy to make, smelled great while making, but the taste (for me) was just OK.  The sauce was really good, but overall I felt the dish was a little bland. I doubled the sauce, but not the vinegar as others suggested.

My rating scale (cause number of stars is subjective): 1-Didn't like it, 2-It's okay, 3-Liked it, 4-Loved it, 5-Can't get enough of it. Way to much vinegar for what should be a creamy dish.

This just didn't work out for us. The vinegar was too overwhelming. I buy an expensive Lebanese vinegar so could it be that the amount stated are for cheaper (watered out) vinegars?

This was ok, but a little weird.  Could be because of my subs of evaporated milk, raspberry BALSAMIC vinegar, though.  However, my issue was the sweetness of the raspberry, so I am thinking it would have yielded a similar result regardless of having heavy cream and straight raspberry vinegar.  I am thinking this might be better with a straight balsamic vinegar reduction or a red wine reduction.  Maybe I will give this recipe a try with a different vinegar.   My sauce was also a very dark brown due to the use of balsamic; it was like melted chocolate in color- very gravy-like.  So the color vs the flavor may have messed with my taste perceptions.

This recipe is absolutely divine and has been a favorite of ours for years!  Consider doubling the amount of sauce and serving it with rice or risotto...the sauce tastes so good with the rice and/or risotto!

Who ever shared this thank you so much!! This is one of my favorite recipes. Every1 I have given this to loves it. I did double the sauce bc it is very yummy on the potatoes or rice. I also added garlic. I have seasoned the meat and the sauce with garlic. I think its best with seasoning the meat with the garlic while browning the chicken. One of my families favorites for sure :)

Amazing! My only issue; I ran out of chicken! My entire family loved it including a pickey 4 and 2 year old. I didn't alter the recipe in any way.

Amazing! I subbed Veggie oil for Sunflower Oil, Shallots for Green Onions, and Raspberry Vinegar for Raspberry Vinegairette, and it turned out PHENOMENAL. I had Brocolli Cheddar rice as a side. Added a little more chicken stock and a dribble more vinegairette at the end with the chicken to create a little heavier sauce to go on top of the chicken. Will make again!

I just wanted to add that I came across this recipe while looking for something to make with the minimal ingredients I had around. (Was in desperate need to go to the store) So I revised this with what I had and it was still good! Probably not as good as what the original recipe called for, but I found it delicious. Without having any shallots, I decided to use some scallions and garlic. Without raspberry vinegar, I used red wine vinegar. Before I found this recipe I had already seasoned the chicken with some ground coriander, onion powder, lemon pepper seasoning, and S&P. Those seasonings did not seem to take away from the yummy sauce. I will definitely make this again, probably try it with the given ingredients the second time around.

We loved this recipe.  I did make a few changes.  I used a Raspberry Vinagrette Salad Dressing in place of the vinegar as I had some on hand, and, I seasoned the chicken breasts with garlic, rosemary, salt and pepper before cooking them. Delicious!

I attempted to make this recipe low-fat. The chicken was browned -- not cooked through -- in a Teflon pan in just a bit of olive oil. After the chicen was browned and removed from the pan, I poured out all but a tablespoon of the remaining fat, sauted the onions/shallots in that, added a tablespoon of flour to make a rue, then stirred in the chicken stock, vinegar and low-fat milk in place of cream. Chopped garlic, tarragon and pepper rounded out the flavours. The chicken went back into the sauce and finished cooking in it. The result was a wonderfully flavourful meat, but the sauce was over-powered with vinegar. The outcome would have been different had I used cream, I'm sure. The solution was fo me to eat just the meat. The sauce was saved with the addition of some real berry syrup (jelly would have worked, too). That the rest of the family loved the sauce. So the recipe became was low-fat, just not as low-calorie as I had hoped. I'll try this again, maybe experimenting with low-fat sour cream instead of milk. Thanks for the inspiration.

This tastes great.  I made a few substitutions though.  I only had rasberry infused balsamic vinegar, so I used that & decreased the amt. by 1/2.  I added some garlic, too.  I also used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream and, sadly, it curdled.  We ate it anyway, and I'm not quite sure why it curdled-I let it cool quite a bit before adding the 1/2 & 1/2.

This may seem like a strange recipe, but it is so good and easy to make. The raspberry vinegar gives it just a little bite without overwhelming it.  l did make some minor changes. I added a minced clove of garlic after turning the chicken over. I did not have shallots, so used scallions, and they worked great. I doubled the chicken broth because it cooked down too quickly and added a little extra cream.  Mashed potatoes and green beans almandine complemented it well. My husband thought it was a gourmet meal!

I made this according to the recipe except that I used Greek yogurt in place of the whipping cream.  This was not a good idea.  The flavor was good, but the yogurt separated, so the sauce was more liquid with little chunks of yogurt cheese in it. (Curds and whey.)

Very Good!  I just made a few adjustments.  Used seasoned chicken breasts from local meat market, added fresh garlic to onions to saute, used balsamic raspberry vinegar, and doubled the sauce.    I didn't have heavy cream on hand so I used 8 oz cream cheese but added more chicken broth as the cheese melted to keep the sauce from getting too thick.  It made a rich, velvety sauce and I think the cream cheese helped cut the tartness of the raspberry vinegar. Serving with panfried rosemary new potatoes and salad.  The husband said it smells really good, can't wait to see what the family thinks!

I substituted plain low-fat yogurt for the heavy cream.  It has a little more tang but we found it delicious.  A son-in-law favourite.

Very easy, and turned out great despite using raspberry dressing rather than vinegar (which my grocery store doesn't carry). Served it with baby new potatoes, which sponged up the sauce and were lovely.

Very Very good.  This one will go in my regular rotation.  I, too used raspberry balsamic vinegar and it turned out fine.  The sauce was rich and the flavors blended well. I served it over buttered noodles with a veggie on the side.  Looking forward to making it again.

I had a bottle of Cherry Vinegar in the cupboard and was looking for something to use it with - this hit the spot. The sauce was very tangy but the cream balanced it nicely. I dusted the chicken with flour so it browned up better and used half a normal onion instead of shallots as I didn't have any. As others have said you can't taste the fruit flavour so don't be put off by that - give it a go!

This recipe was very unique and very popular with my family. You can't taste the raspberry at all, nor is the cream overpowering. I did use one chicken breast for each of us, and some extra vinegar. I loved the flavor, it was just a perfect combo, and very easy. I will definitely make again.

This was a very easy and unique dish.  I didn't have all the ingredients on hand so I had to make some substitutions.  I did not have any shallots so I used chopped onion and fresh garlic.  I used strawberry vinegar in place of raspberry vinegar and evaporated skim milk in place of the cream.  It tasted pretty good, but next time I will try it with raspberry vinegar and shallots.  The evaporated milk lowers the fat content so I will keep that.

I would give this more than five stars.  I'm not so sure I tasted much raspberry, but the moist chicken and the flavors in the rich gravy were terrific.  I also added garlic to the butter & oil when cooking the chicken and added mushrooms to the gravy.  Served it with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Thanks Jill.

This recipe was awesome.  I made this for my "gourmet-type" husband and he absolutely loved it, so did his golfing buddies.  I added garlic to the butter and cooked the chicken in that.  I also added sliced mushrooms with the shallots and it turned out great.  I don't know how anyone could say that there is no flavor, quite the contrary.  This is a keeper.

I did not care for this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly as stated and the end result tasted like pure vinegar. I tried to fix it by adding a little more broth, then a little more cream, etc. But still couldn't change the strong vinegar taste of the sauce. I dumped all the sauce and ended up making another sauce for the chicken.

Most of the recipes I have tried from Alrecipes have been fine,but this one was not only poor in taste but sickning to look at along with anything else you would put along with it. I am a believer that no matter what you serve, it has to have looks appeal and this lacked any appeal. Dark pink or burgandy--ugh
   Im surprised that so many loved it but thats what makes the world go round. Sorry I just cant rate this because it was not that good.I give a one for effort.

I tried a little variation by using white vinegar and framboise wine, then I thickened the sauce with a little flour.  Turned out very flavorful and nice!

I thought I had some raspberry preserves in my fridge, but turned out to be strawberry instead .. So after browning the chicken, I  removed it from the pan and then added the shallot, de-glazed with the chicken broth and then added about 1 heaping tablespoon of the strawberry preserves and  some balsamic vinegar. Turned out great. Served over basmati rice and peas .. Will make again

This is a very good recipe. I didn't have raspberry vinegar so used cranberry pear vinegar. The sauce was fantastic with the chicken.  This will be added to my favorites.

I'd like to make this again since its got all the makings for a good recipe, but I had trouble!  I used half and half instead of heavy cream (that's what I had on hand), but it curdled immediately. Ive added cream many times when making soups without this problem. Anyone know what might have happened? I think this would be a 5 star recipe for our house if I could figure out how to add cream without curdling.

This recipie was easy to follow and make.. I wanted something different for my chicken breasts and this was very good. Instead of using the vinegar I used raspberry salad dressing . Would recommend for you to try for something  sweet but not to sweet with a little tang to it.. Enjoy..

What a nice change for just pain ole baked chicken, breasts or any other parts.  

We used chicken thighs since we already had them out for dinner.  It is one we have saved in our go to recipe folder.

Thanks

Our family didn't enjoy this dish at all.  Too much vinegar taste.  Sauce didn't thicken (how could it without a thickening agent?).  Won't make it again.

It was good. Not exactly what I expected, but still tasty.  I tried the substitute of evaporated milk instead of the cream.  That might be why it tasted a little funny.  If I make it again, I'll use the cream.  It was nice to have something different for a change, though. :)

I found the outcome of this recipe to be very odd, but it may have been my fault.  I couldn't find raspberry vinegar in my grocery store, so I used raspberry balsamic vinegar instead. I think this is what caused my sauce to look like chocolate sauce.  I followed everything else carefully. The flavor was just ok.  If I use this recipe again, I will use white wine vinegar and/or white wine instead of the raspberry vingar.  My family ate this to be nice, but I don't think they enjoyed it. Once again, this may be all my fault.

I'm watching my weight, so I eat a lot of boneless, skinless chicken breast, and I'm constantly looking for new recipes. This is the only one so far that I absolutely couldn't stand.

The flavor wasn't as strong as I would've liked. The leftovers actually tasted butter, because the chicken had more time to absorb the flavor of the sauce. I'd suggest somehow marinating this in something, even if it's not that sauce.
