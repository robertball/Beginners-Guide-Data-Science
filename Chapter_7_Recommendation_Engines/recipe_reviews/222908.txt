Very tasty recipe, though I confess I had to alter based on what was in my pantry. I used 1/4c rolled oats and completed with 1/2 c seasoned panko crumbs. Also,I  reduced the Dijon to 1 tsp simply because my five and one-year-old were eating as well. These patties took about 10 min total to cook, and I served on a bed of arugula tossed with a lemon dressing and Parmesan. Both kids devoured it and the older one said this is the only way he'll eat salmon from now on. Go figure!

We liked the burgers. They were indeed quick. Took the advice from another happy cook and slapped some lemon dill sour cream sauce on 'em. Very good, thank you.

I really love this recipe for several reasons - 1.  I had everything in the pantry (or at least I thought I did...more on that in a minute.)  2.  They were awesome.  3.  They're great for adding in random veggies that are about to go bad in the fridge.  4.  They're almost better cold out of the fridge at 10:30 (note: I know nothing of this fridge-raid and that's my story.)  I was out of oats, unfortunately, so I used some crushed up whole wheat crackers for the breading.  I added in just a bit of parsley, also, because I had some going bad (yay versatility!)  The lemon and Dijon gave it a great flavor - I served it with some Tzatziki sauce and they were amazing.  Expecting this to be a regular summertime dish at my house, and probably year-round after that.  Thanks!

These salmon burgers had a really good flavor and they were quick, easy and inexpensive to make. I added a little more dijon and an extra egg to bump up the flavor and help them stick together a little more. We'll definitely make these again.

Everyone loved these, and I loved how quick and easy they were.  I added some chopped parsley for color and flavor.   Loved being able to use oats... I am a big fan of bread crumb substitutes.

I used two frozen salmon filets that I bought at Walmart, cooked on George foreman grill, added some garlic and a couple of tablespoons of plain yogurt.  Doesn't even taste like salmon!  Yummy

This recipe was GREAT!   I am trying to lose weight and watch what I eat, while still trying to cook things that are yummy that my husband will also like.  I love the 'flourless' recipe, and was worried it wouldn't taste very good, but we both loved it, and my husband had seconds!

I made these with tuna instead of salmon, and they were delicious! I only had a 9 oz can, but that was plenty to make 4 big burgers. They were a little bit difficult to keep together, but not too bad.

I made this with some Chinook Salmon I caught and canned from the Trask river in Oregon. I added crushed pineapple,  green pepper, some McCormick spices, and I used two eggs and had to add Ritz crackers to get it to make a good patty. I also used  Kingsford BBQ sauce instead of  Dijon mustered. It made 8 patties and was great. Now I have a recipe I can use to use up all my canned salmon.

Easy recipe!  Kids loved it!  I omitted onions because my family is not crazy about them.  I also doubled the recipe for a family of six, but I should have tripled it!

Good basic recipe to build on.  Added an egg, used 2 T. Almond Meal, 2 T. rolled oats, 1 large piece of jarred roasted red pepper, 2 minced cloves of garlic (or use one large), 2 dashes of Tapatio hot sauce, juice from a whole lemon, dried dill (would have been better with fresh dill) but my dried dill was really freshly bought from the bulk herb dept. of our COOP.  Also used onion salt in addition to kosher salt and 4-5 rounds of freshly ground pepper. Had put the salmon can in the fridge the day before so it and the eggs, mustard and roasted red pepper were already cold plus I put the mixing bowl inside another with ice in it to keep it cold.  Before cooking I stuck it back in the fridge for 30 minutes.  They didn't fall apart and cooked in 10-11 minutes.  Served with chutney and a slice of sweet onions and lettuce.  My son had ketchup.  Will make again.

This was really tasty. I also added diced red and yellow peppers. My burgers were dry and were hard to keep together. I will add another egg next time. Made a dill tarter sauce and it was a great touch.

My husband and my kids loved it, although I thought it was a little bland and a little dry, even with adding the lemon dill sour cream that others mentioned (which made a big difference). I did use more egg, lemon juice and dijon, since I had about 18 oz of salmon, but I may try to add more next time. Also, I'm thinking a little Old Bay or something like that with a little zip would be good to keep it from being bland. I'll make this again and play with the recipe some more, though, since all my boys were all raving about it.

Loved it! So easy and very tasty with excellent flavor. I added half a seeded jalapeno and a chopped celery stalk, plus a tablespoon of mayo, and they came out perfect. Definitely my go-to recipe from now on!

I try to review recipes only if I make them as written. In this case, I did need to make some slight alterations but I don’t think they really impacted the recipe or my review. I  used green onions instead of a regular onion, for instance. No big deal. I didn’t have any lemon and I knew it really needed the lemon flavor, so I put in about a teaspoon of mayonnaise. As many have suggested, it could have used another egg. I figure the mayonnaise covered both the lemon and the egg! They held together nicely, and I was able to get five patties out of the recipe. It was a really quick and easy dinner to pull together, and I served it on top of a Caesar salad, the dressing of which complimented the patties nicely. .My only drawback is that I really tasted the uncooked oats. Maybe next time I will try grinding them a little. I really liked not having to use breadcrumbs to make them gluten-free.

I always follow a recipe exactly as written when I make it for the first time.  That being said, this dish was absolutely delicious and everyone enjoyed the dish.   The family was asking for more, but I did not make enough.  This dish will definitely be in the family meals rotation in the future.

Will definitely make it again! It was a hit with the whole family. My husband and I were impressed by the flavour and the moistness of the burger.  I added  an extra egg as well as 2 garlic cloves. I would use less onion next time. I grilled the burgers on the BBQ and they still turned out moist. When bbqing you need to be a little gentle with the panties so they do not fall apart.

Loved this.  I made sliders and they were a big hit.  Served with a homemade sriracha mayo. Spicy and good!

I made it with left over salmon,not canned.  I added a finely chopped celery, about 3 tablespoons and about 1/2 teaspoon of OLD BAY seasoning.   might add more of the Old Bay the next time because I could not really taste it.  The celery made it really great.

I had to make changes due to what was in my pantry. I baked two fillets of salmon, used bread crumbs, lemon juice instead of fresh squeezed, two eggs, and added parsley. It came out delicious! No sauce need, just a slice of tomato and lettuce.

I meshed this recipe with the "Yummy Lemon Salmon Burgers" according to ingredients I had and they turned out great! Very easy and quick, not to mention tasty. ;) Made 6 large burgers.

I made this just as directed. They fell apart a bit so next time I will add another egg.

These were okay, but really on the bland side to be honest.  I added an extra egg to help the burger patties stick together better.

These were tasty, and easy to put together. But the mixture was dry, and the patties fell to pieces once I put them in the pan. They just needed something more to hold them together. Mayo, perhaps?
