I didn't bother with the fry pan. I just put the butter and sliced onions in crock pot and let them cook until they were soft just like I would do for onion soup. Saves time and extra pans

This recipe turned out great! I admit I was worried at the 4 hour mark by how tough the rump roast was when  I took it out to slice it diagonally , but it was falling apart at 6 hours. Plus,  I had never carmelized onions before but it was really worth the effort .  Toasting the buttered rolls before adding the cheese and then putting them under the broiler gave the rolls the heft necessary to stay in one piece when dipped in the soup.  My husband requested this recipe after he saw it in an email from All Recipes.  I was initially  reluctant because I don't  like lots of sliced onions in recipes but caramelizing the onions made all the difference.  I wanted to eat them with a spoon! My husband and I both really liked this recipe.  The only thing I did differently from the recipe was that I used 14 oz of beef broth and 6 oz of chicken broth because I did not have any more beef broth.  It came out fine with that substitution. This recipe is a keeper!

Excellent recipe! Recommend making it when you have about an hour in the morning for prep, but it is so worth it!

Great recipe! Delicious! I browned the meat in a frying pan first and then cooked the onions in the same pan. It seems to be a more natural order of events.

This was great for my family with simple prep on a busy Sunday afternoon.  Absolutely delicious!  I threw in a few extra onions, mushrooms and carrots just b/c the beef seasoning stews them up so nice.  That was just an added bonus. ENJOY!!

Excellent.  Used a top sirloin from Costco and actually cooked it longer than suggested but didn’t matter.  Used the beef broth gel packs dissolved in water.  Maybe try the beef broth in tetrapac next time.  Used Swiss cheese slices. Otherwise pretty much followed the recipe. Also made sticky rice and a salad with it.

Just amazing - I followed the soup receipe but cut the time in half for all of it. Substituted the rump roast for sirloin and didn’t use that cheese but other than that, followed the rest of the recipe and the 6 hour cook time. It was by far one of the best dishes I’ve ever made so thank you!

Absolutely worth the prep!  Carmelizing the onions, then making sure I took up the dripping with it was the kicker!! I did it for Sunday dinner, also,  and everyone was clamoring for seconds. Served it with a potato salad and fresh spinach salad. EXCELLENT!

I am retired so have a lot of time to cook. This recipe was well worth all the prep time caramelizing  the onions. Meat was fantastic.

I cut back totally on the garlic..I have a distinct dislike of garlic; do not like how it lingers in my body.  Totally satisfied with this recipe; it is fantastic; sans the garlic.

Have honestly not tried this yet... However I am hoping this, will cause a suggestion for allrecipes.
Could you include how many servings your recipes will render?
It is now just my husband and I and it would be helpful to know so I can adjust accordingly.
Also I have one of the  new Instacrocks, so I can happily and easily do it all in one pot!
To the person who said they needed an extra hour in the morning, I do everything the night before, then put in tbe fridge. Next  morning I place the pot in crock, set the timer and go.
I have done it this way for over  30 years. :)

This was great.  We used sirloins that were on sale and I'm sure you could use just about any cut of beef (my opinion).   We also did not precook anything.  I simply tossed it all into the crock pot and cooked according to the balance of the recipe.  My family fought for the left overs in their lunches.  A keeper for sure.
