I made this for Sunday lunch, and it was my first experience cooking pasta in the sauce.  I really appreciate having one less pot, especially on Sunday!  I stayed very close to the recipe, only using chicken broth instead of water.  I feel this is a great place to jump from, to customize to your family's tastes.  For us, it was a bit bland, and would have benefited from some onions, from fresh garlic instead of powder, and from a bit of cream at the end to give the sauce some oomph.  Overall, it is a solid recipe, and a great way to work in some veggies.

Thanks for the comment, Bibi! Great suggestions. (I had next to nothing in my house -- fresh garlic would be great!) This was my first time actually submitting a recipe to the public. I'm so glad it worked out for you.

This is exactly the type of recipe I'm looking for when I look for 'quick week-night meal'.  I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but I believe that's the whole point.  This is a recipe with basic instructions, and then one fills in the blanks with what's in the fridge at the moment.  I used chicken stock and water instead of plain water; and used red bell pepper, celery, and onion for the veggies.  This was the first time I ever cooked pasta this way.  I was a little nervous that it wouldn't cook completely, but it was awesome - absolutely love that was all prepared using one pan.  I'll definitely try this again, and again will use whatever veggies and seasonings are available at the moment.

Truth in advertising - this one is quick! The only changes I made were to use stock instead of water, and parmesan gnocchi instead of the angel hair, and we inhaled the results! I love how fast it came together, and with all in one skillet, clean up was fast too! It's a keeper.

I thought the spinach was bitter - next time I will use less.   A whole pound of pasta seemed like it would be too mucn, so I used half-a-pound, which was perfect.  I also added sliced mushrooms, sautéed onions, garlic, fresh basil, and a little cream at the end.  All that made it a tasty, easy meal.

5 stars with the following changes: I seasoned the chicken with soy sauce and chopped fresh garlic, and sautéed the mushrooms and chicken in olive oil with an additional tablespoon of butter before before adding the other ingredients. I used chicken broth instead of water and I used fresh thyme instead of poultry seasoning, because I had it. Just before serving I sprinkled with freshly grated Parmesan cheese.

Super easy. Used zucchini instead of peas, didn't have spinach.

Flavorless. This needs so much more. Broth instead of water, seasoning and some kind of fat or oil - maybe evoo, butter, or a bit of cream. The water in the directions wasn't nearly enough to cook the pasta and 5 minutes wasn't long enough to make the noodles even close to Al dente. Not enough chicken for the whole pound of pasta. Better to either cook the pasta separately or remove the chicken before adding the water to keep from losing flavor and overcooking the chicken.

1 1/2 cups of water was not nearly enough to boil the angel hair  pasta.  I ended up boiling a separate pot of water and transferring the pasta over, which took away most of the flavoring.  My family of four agreed that it was edible, but did not want me to save the leftovers.

I was looking for something like this to use up leftover rotisserie chicken with mushrooms and baby spinach. It was perfect to cook the pasta (I used bowties) in chicken broth and add the mushrooms. When pasta was almost done I  added white wine, herbs d'provence, garlic powder, salt and pepper with cubed goat cheese, rotisserie chicken and baby spinach and cooked for remaining cooking time till pasta is done. It took longer to cook the pasta than what the recipe recommends because of the different type of pasta. This recipe was the perfect starting point for what I needed. Thanks so much for giving me the roadmap.

Very good! Great for using up odds and ends in the fridge. I added some roasted tomatoes and a couple tablespoons of pesto. Skipped the peas, used frozen chopped spinach. It was a hit!

Used chicken broth instead of water.  Added fresh garlic and shallots & thyme.  Pasta took a while to cook.

Of course, I don't read directions before starting... Boiled a large pot of water for the pasta, then threw in the frozen peas & fresh asparagus, fresh spinach, mushrooms and chopped ham (what I had on hand) on top. Drained. Sprinkled with garlic powder and added some butter. Didn't have any wine. Put peppercorn grinder on the table, plus the grated parmesan. It was so good!

I marinated the chicken in balsamic vinegar, soy and garlic for 2 hours before frying.  I also used Parmesan cheese and cream to finish.  Reviews were mixed in my house.  Two liked it with the cream, and one liked it plain.  I liked that there is a lot of flexibility with the recipe and it's quick.

I had a feeling it might be a little bland, so I added a splash of lemon juice, some capers, and at the end some grape tomatoes and a big dab of sour cream. I also added mushrooms. That didn't change the taste much, I just love mushrooms. I did use chicken broth instead of water and loved not having to use the extra pot!!

It was OK. It seemed like it was missing an ingredient. Could have used some basil or thyme. Also a whole pound of pasta was way too much.

I didn't have poultry seasoning and I think that made it too bland. Needed to add something else in its place. My veggies were mushrooms, corn and spinach. I used half the pasta and it still made 5-6 servings.

Added roasted red peppers and the some cherry tomato slices at the end.  Easy, filling, and tasty.
