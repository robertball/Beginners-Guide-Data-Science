this was very easy to make. the only change i would make to the recipe is to add more water. to reduce the mangos to a sauce i needed a lot more water, but after i did that, it was great! my guests put this over white cake and loved it.

I came across this recipe while searching for a "strawberry shortcake" substitute. I put this topping over a slice of pound cake, and my family LOVED it! This recipe has so many possible applications, and I can't wait to explore them all. Thanks for a quick and easy recipe.

I was looking for a way to use some mangoes that were ripening faster than I could eat them. This was easy and worked well as a pancake topping. Had no OJ so substituted passion fruit juice for a little more tropical taste. Felt like the butter overshadowed the fresh fruit taste and will definitely leave it out next time.

Outstanding. This topping elevated simple vanilla ice cream to a decadent, unexpected delight. And it couldn't be simpler. I'll be making this again.

Great flavor!  Made exactly as written - used it on our pork chops for dinner and it had on our pancakes the next morning.  A simple, quick tasty topping!

I did not use the exact measurements, I just used one mango and adjusted it to my taste. I used a lot more orange juice and water than the recipe called for. I also found it helpful to mash the mango with a fork while sauteeing it in the pan. I put this on top of a betty crocker vanilla cake, it was DELICIOUS.

I hate to be a party pooper, but I really didn't enjoy this.  I love fresh mango, but the combination of sour/sweet in this sauce was not to my liking.    Maybe I'll try it on some different things and change this review, but I really didn't enjoy it.

This is a fantastic and versatile topping! I used on top of my belgium waffles with a dollop of plain greek yogurt. I am sure I'll find many more uses for the leftovers.

This recipe was so easy!  One thing I did to make sure it was nice and creamy was to put it in my blender on low for just a few seconds. It puréed it nicely. I also added a bit more brown sugar as it was pretty tart and I’m using as a dessert topping for guests tonight. I can’t for the life of me figure out why to lady who said she needed to add more water to reduce the mangoes had to do so. Mangoes have a good deal of natural juice, so adding more water would have made it soupy. I mashed the chunks of mangoes on the bottom of the sauce pan to help smooth it out while it was cooking. A good thing to do. I followed the ingredients exactly except for the brown sugar, and it turned out perfectly.

Quick and easy and tased good on pancakes.  I used frozen mango which worked fine but was more difficult to mash, will  cook longer next time.  I put in pan with water and cooked on low until thawed then added other ingredients.  May add more water next time as there wasn't much liquid sauce.

This was a pleasant fruit sauce that wasn't very sweet to go with  my sweeter cakes.  I used the yellow skinned mangoes which isn't as stong flavoured/fragrant as the red/green skinned ones.  So I adjusted the tartness  to my taste and added a pinch of salt to bring out the flavour.  I did use a little cornstarch and water mixture to thicken the sauce more.

This was a great way to quickly use up the mangoes that were getting away from me. A dollop of this, some fresh mango, fresh whipped cream, and angel food cake made for a great dessert!

Great way to use up mangos that are getting too ripe. My sauce was a little thick when I went to use it so I just added a tiny bit of rum. I liked the result. Be warned if the mngos are truly ripe, this is very sweet. You could probably cut down on the sugar.

Tasty!  I used twice as much brown sugar, twice as much OJ and probably an extra T of water.  It was quite thick without that.  Used it on Seth's pancakes to make them soft enough after surgery.
