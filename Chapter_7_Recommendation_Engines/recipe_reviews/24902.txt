i added a carton of sour cream to cut the saltiness of the soup, much better that way.

I came across this recipe while browsing and know that it is very similiar to one our family has done for years...however, we use leftover turkey or chicken and cube or shred, we put in a lot more cheese than that (500g bar) and use 2 cans of 1/2 salt condensed cream of chicken soup.  I prefer jalenos over banana peppers and always add just a little of the juice from the can.  After baking in the oven until it bubbles we like to eat it with tostido scoops

I made this for a party and it did not go over very well - just did not have much flavor - also did not know what to dip with - i used bread and maybe that was not the right thing.  it was just "ok"

I absolutely love this dip and so does everyone I make it for. My recipe is slightly different. I use 2 chicken breast, 3 cups of shredded cheese and I add 1/2 a  cup of the banana pepper juice from the jar with about another 1/2 cup of banana peppers chopped it.
