Turned out great! The number of ingredients and steps seems daunting, but itâ€™s actually quite simple. Our cake was very moist and flavourful.!

I have been craving fruit cake for a long time and decided this recipe sounded good even though there were only 2 reviews posted.  Just had my first slice of "heaven"  - it is moist and delicious and I would definitely make this particular recipe again.  The only thing I did different was to change up the dates and add currants and prune slices and the candied fruit mix was 1/8 plus another 1/8 sliced graced cherries.  I brushed the finished product with grand marnier.

Excellent ideas to make for the holidays, there are a lot of ingredients though which can make it a little spendy.
