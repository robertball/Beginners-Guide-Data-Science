Tasty and different.  I did make some alterations to this recipe.  I threw the onion and garlic in olive oil with chicken breast strips and cooked until the chicken was cooked.  Then I added only two cups of chicken broth with diced tomatoes, drained, and added Italian spice blend and garlic spice blend.  I cooked this down a bit before adding about six ounces of spinach.  After the spinach wilted, I added a small amount of corn starch and water to thicken it just a touch.  I served it with an herbed brown rice pilaf and sprinkled feta on top.  It was fantastic and so far from ordinary.  It looked beautiful too.  I might serve this the next time I have company.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe!  I do it all in ONE POT which is really nice.  I saute onions and garlic in olive oil with salt and pepper, add the meat (I now use Italian Turkey Sausage instead of chicken) and cook until browned.  Then I add the tomatoes, basil, broth and pasta (I use rotini now - easier to eat with a spoon) and simmer until the pasta is done.  Then I add almost a whole bag of fresh spinach until it wilts and serve.  (don't do the cheese b/c of a dairy allergy).  My 2 and 5 year olds love it and my husband and I do to.  Tastes great and you can't beat a one-pot meal!

Very interesting, light Italian flavor. It's so quick and easy, too, especially if you cook the chicken the night before. My only problem is it's a bit of a trick to eat; you need a fork for the pasta and a spoon for the sauce. My 2-year-old (who loved it, by the way) ate all her noodles and then dipped her breadsticks in the sauce to soak it up. :) In the future, I think I will cook the pasta right in the sauce to save a step and a clean pan. I may also add a can of tomato paste to make it slightly thicker.

This was SO good!  I made modifications based on previous reviews and what I had on hand.  Here are the modifications I made: Used 2 cups broth, 1 can whole tomatoes drained and cut in half plus a heaping half teaspoon italian seasoning, used 2 leaves fresh basil chopped, only about 1/2 a large onion.  I also added the  pasta (1/2 box whole wheat linguine) right to the pot a few minutes after i added the tomatoes and broth and simmered on low for probably 20-25 min.  the pasta was done perfectly al dente.  I used about 3/4 a bag of pre washed baby spinach, and shredded about 3/4 of a chicken i had baked yesterday. I topped with parmesan and grated asiago.

Very tasty.  I added a little bit of cornstarch and broth mixture to the broth in my skillet.  It helped to thicken it up a bit.  That would be the only thing I would do in the future.

This is wonderful! I recommend using a smaller pasta such as macaroni/ cavetelli/bowties/ etc. Because this recipe is more of a soup, this helps so that you don't have to use both a spoon and a fork. This is a great recipe!

What a great recipe to use up what's already in the cupboard. I used chicken thighs instead, and reduced the sauce a great deal before adding the pasta. Light, healthy, and perfect for summer.

This is a light and delicious meal.  The first time I made it, I doubled the spinach and still didn't think it was enough.  The next time I used 5 times the spinach and liked that a lot better.

Followed advice of others: cooked pasta in the sauce, added 5 tsp cornstarch, and used 5 oz frozen spinach.  Really enjoyed it, but could have used a bit more spice.  Next I will try sausage.

Nice fresh flavors.  I had some tomato paste in the refrigerator and added two tablespoons.  That, plus about 30 minutes simmering, gave a little more body to the sauce.  Great for left-over chicken.

I found this recipe to be very bland.  I used 2 cups of broth & can't imagine using more...I even tried to thicken it up with cornstarch but it was still very liquidy.  I used fresh basil and 3 handfuls of spinach but other than that, I followed the recipe to the tee.  Next time, I will season the chicken, add more onion, add green pepper, and less chicken broth.  It was very attractive with the wilted spinach.  I will make this again with more seasoning.

Our whole family, even picky preschoolers, enjoyed this dish.  I substituted fresh tomatoes and basil, and used less broth.  Also at the end per previous reviews I added twice the spinach (next time will use even more), and threw on top a few sliced black olives and some Parmasan cheese for good measure.  Husband's only negative comment: "Needs more garlic."  Thanks for a great family recipe!

I doubled the recipe and it was very flavorful and light-tasting.  However, there was too much liquid.  I would reduce the broth by 25% at least.

I thought it was kind of boring with just the broth instead of a sauce. It wasnt bad though either.. so a little blah for me.

This was good, but I thought it needed a little more seasoning. I too cooked the pasta in the same pot. Used one can crushed tomatoes, didn't have diced. Used frozen spinach that I cooked and drained separately. Will make again.

This was really good. Great for cold weather. Used mini bow-tie pasta and a bag of pre-washed baby spinach instead.  My kids loved it.

This was OK.  I opted to cook the spaghettini in the broth thus mine wasn't the soupy consistency of the others.  Instead, mine ended up a bit dry.  If I made it again, I'd add a little more broth to hopefully get a happy medium.  In any case, we weren't that crazy about the flavor either.

mmm, nice flavour!  we had it with rotini noodles and served in a a bowl, taking advice from previous reviewers. Easy to make and I also cooked the noodles in the broth.  I let it simmer for quite a while so there wasnt too much liquid, and it was GREAT as leftovers.  I also added a LOT of spinach....yum!

Absolutely wonderful, a nice change from heavier tomato based sauces. The chicken stock creates an interesting layered depth of flavors. I will be making this often, thanks!

As the description says, "it's a soupy sauce"! Why are people going to try  and thicken it up?  Just do a recipe for thick sauce! This recipe is absolutely delicious, the flavor fantastic!  Sometimes, I like soupy sauce  and this fit the bill.  When I want a thicker sauce, I go to the thicker sauce recipe file. I know when you change a recipe, you create your own but- Gee's.

This is really not a rate review because I did some variations to the recipe.   The only thing I did was I added tomato sauce and a tad bit more of the basil seasoning with salt and pepper and instead of waiting to add the pasta I added it to the sauce.

The only changes I made were, I didn't have onion, I used about half the broth and I cooked the angel hair pasta right in the skillet, covered. First I cooked the garlic, then the chicken, then I added the diced tomatoes and broth and then added the angel hair and cooked it all covered for about 4 mns. The pasta helped soak up the excess broth and the consistency was perfect!

I used a can of Rotel (all I had in the house) and boy, was it spicy!  But I loved it - so quick, easy, and tasty.  Will make again!
Edited to add - three years later, I still make this on the regular and love it.

Not super impressed with this recipe (sorry!) but it wasn't bad, either. It was just very...bland. And the pictures posted here show it more like a chicken dish with a drizzle, but mine definitely turned into a soup and we ended up having to eat it out of a bowl with spoons. It wasn't anything special, so I won't be making it again, but it was by no means inedible. We all finished it and I'm glad that I at least tried it. If you want a homemade chicken noodle soup, I'd recommend this because that's basically what it was (with a bit more flavor than the store-bought stuff, but not too much, really). And oh, by the way, I left out the tomatoes and spinach and added more Parmesan (which we still couldn't taste)...just wanted to mention that.

YUMMY!  Made this one last night for dinner and we really enjoyed it.  Per some other reviewers, I opted to cook my pasta along with the broth/tonatoes.  I simmered for about 20 mins and used whole wheat penne...did not end up with too 'saucy' a result as others noted.  I also added considerably more spinach than asked for at the end along with fresh basil instead of dried.  Since I had cooked shrimp out of the freezer already as opposed to chicken, I used that with great results...I'm sure chicken would be equally delicious!

This recipe is really, really good!  It has an odd soupy consistency, but tastes great.  I couldn't decide whether to eat it with a fork or a spoon, so that's why I gave it 4 stars, but I definitely recommend it.  I had fresh spinach that I needed to get rid of, so that's why I chose this recipe.  I didn't have any onions on hand, but I doubled the garlic because I love garlic.  It turned out great!  Next time, I might try roasting fresh roma tomatoes instead of using the canned tomatoes, but it's definitely easier to make with the canned.

I thought this was just ok.  I prefer somthing thicker on pasta but thought I'd try it anway for something different.  My kids really didn't like it at all.

This recipe was surprisingly good. I added paprika, a pinch of nutmeg, and moe chicken. The sauce was liquidy, but in a nice, light way. Overall, it was very enjoyable to eat.

I found this recipe using ingredient search and thought why not. My husband and son are pretty easy to please.  However my 7 year old daughter is a very picky eater.  Long story short, this was a big hit all around as well as a nice change of pace.
