This recipe couuld stand with some improvement. It is easy but lacks the flavour a seasoned swiss steak maker can give it.Mines better.

I made this for dinner tonight and everyone loved it.  I cooked it all day long in the crock pot.  I also did deer steaks instead of beef.  I'm always looking for a way to mask the gaminess of deer and this did it.  I didn't have wine, so I added a little vinegar.  I also added several splashes of worchestersire sauce and fresh crushed garlic.  Toward the end it mixed a little water and flour to thicken it.  I will make it again.  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  My family loved it, even my pickiest eater!  I used one 24 oz. jar of Tomato and Basil spaghetti sauce and one can of beef broth in place of the additional spaghetti sauce and wine, and it came out great!

Excellent!  I used a whole onion and 1 jar of garden vegetable pasta sauce since I didn't have the green peppers or celery.  Also threw in some sherry since I didn't have quite enough red wine.  Came out surprisingly tender and tasted delicious!

I used stew meat, but I have found that supermarkets dont cut it small enough. Then, I used beef broth & spaghetti Sauce. Also, I put the pepper (Red sweet) in with the onion after the beef but before the simmering began.  I love it when you get raves rather than complaints after you slave over a hot stove all day.  (Don't tell em that the stove did all the work!! and only 45 minutes.)

Followed this basic recipe but had to make some changes.  Omitted red wine because I didn't have any available, left out celery because my husband won't eat it, used one red bell pepper and one orange bell pepper because picky husband won't eat green.  Served over rotini rather than egg noodles and used and entire onion.  This was phenomenal!

Like many others responded, "Half the amount of sauce!".

Unless you're making soup.Swiss steak is meat, usually beef, prepared by means of rolling or pounding and the recipe didn't mention that-

I had to cook for 30 minutes longer, even after brining for 30 minutes.

The final taste was very good.

Made per recipe only used a 24 ounce jar of sauce instead of the two 16 ounce jars. It had plenty of sauce in the pan with just the one jar. Seemed very bland. Won't make this again.

I sauteed the vegetables in olive oil, removed to a bowl, dredged the meat, sauteed in olive oil, added the vegetables back it, added spaghetti sauce, I used one jar of Barilla Mushroom. For seasoning I added garlic, basil, oregano, pepper, salt free garlic and herb blend, salt free Emeril's Essence, savoury and a bay leaf. I omitted the salt and did not have wine so I substituted beef broth. I braised in a 250 degree oven for 2 hours instead of doing it on the cook top. Served over pasta.

Pretty Darn good! I liked it with pasta but I thought better with rice. The steak was very tender & this was easy to make
