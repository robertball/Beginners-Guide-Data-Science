I am the submitter of this recipe but when it was published the original serving of 2 was changed to 12. Yes, you will have 12 sticks from 4 slices of bread but not 12 servings.

A favorite with the kids. Make sure your eggs and milk are at room temperature. The butter will harden if not.

My picky kids loved this. I made it with brioche bread. Although I didn’t try them they’ve asked for it a second time and it was their breakfast today. I made it as the recipe said and no adjustments...which is rare for me because I almost always adjust!

Very easy & yummy! Grandkids loved them! Not sure how to keep the cinnamon from clumping up though...I whisked & whisked but could not get the clumps out. I think next time I will just sprinkle the cinnamon on top of them once I put them in the basket.

I received a Ninja Foodi grill for Christmas and I love it.  I wanted to try French Toast in it. This is a very simple and delicious recipe.  I did increase the time. I was going for crispsy I increased it to 11 minutes and flipped it a few times.  I also add a dash of sea salt to my French Toast for the hint of salt with the sweet!

Made just as the recipe calls only halved it as I was cooking for two.  Came out great. And so easy.  I’m new to the air fryer so this really helped. Thanks.
