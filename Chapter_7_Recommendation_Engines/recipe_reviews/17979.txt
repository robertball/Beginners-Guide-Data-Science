this was the worst pie I have ever made. my family had many laughs about this. thank goodness that i had excellent apple, chocolate, and pecan pies to redeem myself.they sent it home with me due to "insuffucient quality". at least it provided many jokes throughout the day. good thing i am not sensitive! they referred to it as my pumpkin jello mold, my squash delight, no crust pumpkin mush, and so on.. do not ever make this!!!!!!!!

There are no spices included in this recipe. Looks like it would be pretty bland.

I make this recipe, add pumpkin pie spice and pour mixture into greased or sprayed muffin tins.  After they've cooled, they have an indentation in the top, that's just perfect for a dollop of whipped cream.  Makes perfect individual tarts!

This had no flavor, even though I added more seasoning and pumpkin than it called for.
