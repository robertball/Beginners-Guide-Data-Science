Very quick, easy and came out great.  I preheated my oven a bit before placing the bowl of dough in it and it doubled in about 20 minutes.

This makes a delicious pizza.  It takes some time and effort but well worth it.  I followed as directed and had excellent results.  My first time baking a pizza on a stone, will not make one any other way now.   I made only 1 pizza, wrapped remaining 3 balls with plastic wrap and put in fridge.  Next day removed one, let come to room temp and punched back down.  Made pizza, came out as perfect as the first.  The whole family loved this pizza.  Thank you for the recipe.

I substitute 1/4 cup cornmeal for flour. I've also found that whole milk mozzarella is easier to handle in a semi-frozen state and I cube it instead of just slice it. 

My "pizza sauce" is little more than a can of drained plum tomatoes which I puree with an immersion blender and add  a little bit of olive oil, black pepper, a pinch of sugar and a pinch of sea salt. Simple.

I have to ask, did a lot of you buy the pizza dough?  I rechecked the ingredients over and over....this dough was totally unworkable. I'm confused as to why this wasn't a problem for others.

Delicious and fresh! I did not use pizza sauce, instead I used sliced homegrown tomatoes that I lightly salted and let drain in a strainer to get the excess  liquid out. The dough was super easy to make and I used whole wheat flour to replace a cup of AP flour. So simple.

This is EXCELLENT!!  It is our new favorite pizza! Make sure the water is about 110 degrees to activate the yeast.  We have tried this with several different toppings and it still tastes great!

This pizza was delicious but I couldn't quite figure out how to get the sliced mozzarella to cover the entire pie once cooked. I followed the directions but my pizza was not covered in the cheese. Next time I may opt for shredded mozzarella instead.

Yum.  My favorite pizza.  Plain and delicious.  No need for all sorts of add-ons. Please make your own sauce though because something this simple demands quality.

Had to substitute flour based on what I had on hand: 2c unbleached white all purpose flour, 3/4c whole wheat bread flour, 3/4c whole wheat pastry flour. As I was adding the flour, needed to add about 1/4 extra water to blend in all the flour (may be my local climate since I've noticed this with other bread and pizza dough recipes). Used slightly warm water, around 100-105degF and used about 1 tsp of honey instead of sugar. Warmed oven to 170 deg F then turned off  and put the dough in there to rise.  Topped with tomato sauce, pepperoni, sauteed broccoli, and mozzarella. Cooked at 430 deg F on a nonstick baking pan for 15 min. Made a nice thin crust. It was pretty good but not amazing.  I'll try it again next time using all white flour not the wheat mix.

Best recipe for pizza ever!! The dough came out perfect. We used home grown veggies on it and it came out perfect. I love this recipe. God Bless the one who developed it.

I have now made this recipe many times. It IS great and just like a Margherita pizza should be. I made only a few changes. First off I only use 3 cups of flour, anymore makes it dry and unmanageable. I use quick rise yeast too. I also use my food processor to do the dough which works great. I divide mine in HALF. I found them to be too small if divided into 4. I also just use a pizza pan and not oven tiles. I just keep an eye on it but it takes about the same time to bake. I also put a few more Basil leaves on because the shrink when baked. So I put on at least 8. The mozzarella even in large slices should melt down and spread out but if that doesn't work for you tear it into smaller pieces and dot it all over. Just do not use too much or it can make the pizza too WET.

My family including my 7 y.o. son loved this recipe!  It is delicious and as good as a restaurant.  Follow the directions exactly - just adjust the amount of sauce, you don't want to put too much on.  Also, you must use fresh mozzarella for the best flavor!  Don't skip the olive oil or the sea salt, they matter, believe me!  If it's too dry, add a little more water.  If it's too wet, add more flour.  A+

Love, love, love it!  Followed the recipe pretty carefully, except for a few "common sense" observations,  thinking alterations could be made after the initial try!  I didn't use all of the flour, as it "looked" good with just 3 cups!  Also, reading the other reviews, I agree that more specific instructions for the yeast and water mixture should be included!  I do wish however, that I could figure out how to make the crust crispier...any ideas?  Use cornmeal on the stone instead of flour!   Highly, highly recommend!

I admit that I cheated.  I used Mama Mia's premade crust, then finished with toppings as directed.  The picture showed tomatoes, so I thinly sliced a garden tomato and added it before cooking.  Delicious!  I will make this a favorite!

Good... However, the crust wasn't crispy at all. Also, the recipe doesn't say to use warm water with the yeast, which you need to know. I wasted one packet because it wouldn't activate due to my using of room temperature water. I would make this again, but I will have to alter it some more. For me, I could only use two cups of flour per one cup water, or  the other flour wouldn't mix in.

I have to agree with the majority that this pizza is out of this world! My kids thought it was better than our favorite pizza joint. I used Contadina Pizza Sauce (all there products are fabulous in my opinion), peppers, onions, pepperoni, and spinach. I tried both the shredded mozzarella and the fresh mozzarella to see the difference and hands down the fresh mozzarella was much, much more tasty. I did not have sea salt and like spinach on my pizza, so I did not use basil. I topped it off with olive oil and cracked black pepper.  As a well-known picky eater, I can't say enough about how good this pizza is. I would recommend trying a second time if you did not rate it well the first time. DELICIOUS!!!!!!

this was fairly good! I don't own a pizza stone so I just used a cookie sheet and the crust came out a bit floury and pasty, I'm not sure if it was a problem with the lack of pizza stone or the yeast I used that caused that. I added some garlic and oregano to the sauce because that's how I like it, overall tasted good!

Very easy good base recipe on its own!  After a few times I added 2 TBLS of wine, 1/2 TBLS of basil, 1/2 TSP onion powder.  With those alterations I had several people compliment MY Sauce itself rather than just, this is good pizza!

This recipe is totally wrong. If you are going to use that much flour you have to add another cup of  water. 
To  bake at 500 degrees you get top and bottom crust and RAW inside. Reduce heat to 450. Bake for 16 minutes.

This dough is a pain to make.   It's dry and works hard.   I had to add in extra water to make it work at all.   To make it work even better, it probably  needed oil of some sort.   However, the end result was a perfect crispy/soft crust.   So I guess the work is worth the end result.   The rest of the recipe is solid and made one of the best margherita pizzas that we've ever had.

Easy recipe. Fast to make. No rise time required for the dough. Used Fleishman's Yeast for PIZZA dough. No proofing needed. Crust turned out very nice. This pizza was good, but I still prefer a brick oven pizza.
