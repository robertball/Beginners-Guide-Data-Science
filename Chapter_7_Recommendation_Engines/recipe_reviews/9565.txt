I find the secret to making perfect coleslaw everytime is to put the sugar directly on the cabbage mix for about 10 to 15 minutes before adding the dressing mix then refrigerate and let stand before serving. Also, try additing salted sunflower seeds for an interesting twist your family will love.

I made the recipe using cider vinegar, and I skipped the onion and green pepper. I served the slaw with baco-bits sprinkled on top. I thought it was tangy and tasty.

I didn't use any vegetable oil. Used half as much sugar as called for... it just looked too sweet as it was. Delicous. Keeps for a long time in the fridge. (At least eight days.)

A friend gave me a recipe similar to the dressing part. But she used a bag of slaw mixture, added 1/2 c. shelled sunflower seeds. She also used a package of ramen noodles. The "chicken broth" powder was mixed with 1/2 c. vinegar & 1/2 c. oil. The noodles were broken up into small pieces (uncooked) & mixed with the cabbage mixture. The dressing was put on & mixed through last minute. She called it "Oriental Cole Slaw" & almost everyone who has tried it loves it. It is great for outdoor pitch-ins, since there is no creamy dressing to go bad.

Great recipe. Very flexible - I adjusted it to work with what I had on hand, and it turned out great! I used apple cider vinegar and olive oil instead of white wine vinegar and vegetable oil. I also used a bag of a pre-shredded slaw mixture so the bell pepper and onion were left out.

I loved it! I just used a bag of shredded cabbage and carrots, and did not use onions or green peppers(prefer cole slaw without them).  Oops, I used regular vinegar and it tasted fine! My husband really liked it too (He is very picky)! I only made 1/2 C vinegar, 1/2 C veg. oil and 1/2 C sugar for a 16 oz bag.

Very few of the recipe reviews are helpful because most people alter them.  There are as many alterations as there are reviews.  I never know how the original recipe came out.  It would be nice if more people could make the original recipe first and then make the changes and write reviews.  I guess I will just have to do that myself.  But there is too much sugar in this one without making it.

I was thinking I would try to substitute stevia for the white sugar. Stevia is much sweeter than sugar for the same amount, so I'd have to adjust the amount but I need to test it as sometimes stevia works really well in a recipe and other times not so much. If stevia works then the calories would go way down to nothing nearly and you could enjoy a lot more cole slaw - I'll get back to you all with the results of my test.

This was pretty good cole slaw. I left out the bell pepper because I didn't have any. Quite tasty.

LOVED IT!!! I only used red and green cabbage and added some pepper and celery salt.  It tasted just like the slaw at Giordano Brothers here in San Francisco!

I found it too sweet and halve the sugar. Also add good shaking of celery seed. This should cure overnight to allow celery seed to flavoe. I make the dressing separately in a piny jar and use on store bought packages of Cole slaw.

I have made a cole slaw similar to this for years and everyone loves it.  Instead of carrots I used chopped pimento and a little celery seed really makes a difference.

Great mayo-free, sweet coleslaw recipe as is. I like to decrease the oil and use a stevia/sugar blend to further cut calories.  But people.....why are you posting pictures of this recipe with what is CLEARLY mayo in it?? I almost didn't look at this recipe because i was searching for a sweet oil & vinegar coleslaw.

I make this but I use a bag of coleslaw (with the red cabbage and carrots). I then mix together 1/3 c seasoned rice vinegar, 1.5 tbsp of sugar, 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, 5 drops of sesame oil, with a sprinkle of salt and pepper to taste.Pour over cole slaw mix and mix well.  It comes out perfect all the time and takes only minutes to make. You should let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours to 'marinade'.  Its also low in fat since I don't use a cup of oil. I like to add shredded chicken and sliced almonds when I bring it as lunch to work.

I added 1 TBL Pampered Chef Asian seasoning, used apple cider vinegar, omitted the pepper and onion.  Right before serving, I added some red cabbage for color; it was a big hit.

Made this using 1/2 red onion and 1/2 orange pepper with regular white vinegar. Will cut back on oil and sugar a little next time, but was very happy with this alternative to using mayonnaise and everyone loved it.

very nice and simple too. 
I used red onion and a mix of red and green cabbage, it came out excellent. 
I cut the sugar a bit little more then 3/4, I think next time I would cut it even more.

I've been making this recipe for several years and everyone LOVES it! I sometimes use white balsamic vinegar and it's still a hit.. My husband uses the smoker ALL day, smoking delicious meats, but I receive all the compliments on the cole slaw! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

pretty good recipe.I like to use honey for the sweetener instead of sugar,realize sugar is sugar but honey does give my cole slaw a nice flavor.Also use a lot less vinegar and NO vegetable oil but the added vege's are very good.
