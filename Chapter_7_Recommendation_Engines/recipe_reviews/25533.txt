This recipe is really salty unless you rinse the dried beef with water.  It tastes really good when served with round bread

Sorry, I even rinsed the beef, and it was still WAY too salty.  I think part of the problem is using that much italian seasoning....maybe half would be better, and use the Buddig beef packages that are much less salty.

Made this last night for New Years Eve.  Everyone loved it and there is very little left.  I used a rye bread bowl because that is all there was at the store and it was good.  The only change I made to the dip was I added 2 tsp of creamy horseradish to give it a little extra kick.  I will make this again and again.  Thanks for the recipe.

It's very good but very salty, i should have read the reviews and rinsed the beef to see if that helped.  I'm going to try adding more sour cream and mayo to tone it down.  Next time I would chop the dried beef even finer since it thickens as it sets, it's hard to get it on the bread pieces.

Make sure you wash the dried beef as it is way too salty. Thank you.

I think I used about 1/2 as much beef--rinsed as the other reviewers recommended--and it was still plenty for the dip. Turned out really well!

Only really used this recipe for some inspiration. I changed so much about it. I didn't use Italian seasoning at all, but instead used garlic powder, onion powder, Wild Tree dill dip seasoning, and salt and pepper. Also, only used about half of a jar of dried beef. I let it sit in the fridge over night, and the result was pretty decent.

I make this and I Love it the only thing that I do differently is that I don't use the Italian dressing I use just the beef, mayo, sour cream and I add onions. I also let it sit the longer it sits the better it tastes. Also rinse the beef off otherwise it is too salty.
