Had one brat bun left, so I thought WTH, let’s give this a try.  Well, I’ll never again throw away a hot dog bun because this worked GREAT, and the kids are gonna love it too (maybe without the hot sauce).  In the future, I’ll just jazz it up a little like I do with scrambled eggs or an omelet, and add some shredded cheese, chives, chopped ham, bell pepper, onion, whatever.  I did toast the bun and added salt and pepper to this simple Egg Dog.  Honestly, I thought this recipe was a bit of joke, but I’ll admit it, I was wrong.  What fun!!!

As soon as I saw this I knew it was a door opened. This thing is the bomb. Put you some cheese in it scramble them eggs up an u got a meal worthy of a king. If I had some sausage or ham that would've put the cherry on the shake. Salsa or ketchup too. What you've made should be known to all people my friend. This dish should be on every persons table in the morning. Definitely making again. 5 stars, 10/10, whatever u wanna call it, the legendary egg dog is number one.

07.19.17 ~ What a fun way to eat an egg sandwich!  I'm not sure how I stumbled across this recipe, but an egg sandwich is one of my favorites.  I added a little salt and pepper to the egg before cooking it.  I had a package of 'Top Sliced' hot dog buns and it fit perfectly in the bun.  Having rolled the egg, it made for a nice bit of egg in every bite.  I'm going to share this with my extended family as they will get a kick out of eating an egg this way.  I will be doing this more often from now on.  Thanks Seth, for adding a little fun to an egg sandwich!
