My boys and I really liked these. I used one of my husband's light beers, my own homemade biscuit mix and an extra sharp cheddar. I mixed the batter lightly and until just moistened as to not overmix the batter. I pressed it into a round cake pan, popped it out, cut it into six large triangles and baked it like scones. We had them with Creamed Eggs and Ham. Most filling. (You can find Creamed Eggs also on this site.)

Wow - so easy and so good! I'd been eyeing up this little recipe for a while now and am so glad I got around to trying it!  Who knew so few ingredients could produce such a tasty little scone! I had exactly 2 cups left of some Bisquick I wanted to get rid of and I have to admit there's NEVER a shortage of beer around here so with just the third ingredient up for grabs I opted to give these an Italian flair.  I used 1/2 cup of shredded Romano cheese, 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan, 1 tsp. of garlic powder, 1/2 tsp. each of oregano and basil, plus 1/4 tsp. of salt.  I baked it in a 9 inch round cake pan and sprinkled the top with a bit more shredded romano cheese.  It baked up nice and golden brown.  After it cooled I cut it into triangles.  It went great with "Rachel's Tomato Basil" Soup from this site.

Very good.  I used Miller 64 light beer and Bisquick Heart Smart, added about 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, used reduced fat cheese and added 1/4 cup more cheese. Sprayed with butter-flavored spray oil and dusted with a little more garlic powder.  I also added a little extra salt, personal preference.  Very, very good.

I made these and when they were done baking, while still hot, I brushed them with melted butter and Old Bay seasoning and they were better than Red Lobster's Cheddar Bay Biscuits.  MMMMMGood!

I chose this recipe as I had a box of Bisquik in the pantry that had never been used and its fast approaching its use by date!!  This worked well with Pasta for dinner this evening.  Made a few changes I added Garlic and Italian seasoning to the dough along with 1 cup of mature sharp English Cheddar.  Cooked in the oven for 10 minutes than topped with another 1/2 cup of cheese and more Italian seasoning.  I used Samual Adams Boston Ale for the beer.  Great quick recipe, when you don't have enough time to bake bread!

use light beer (your fav brand)  because dark/heavy beers give it a sort of sour dough or slight rye bread taste

Excellent...simple to make. I also added chopped green chilies (a couple of teaspoons) along with one cup of shredded cheddar. Used Miller 64 beer and they were very tasty. Will add salt or try the Bay Seasoning as others suggested. Even my 8 yr old daughter loved them!

Excellent! Super quick and I had all the ingredients on hand. I took this to a cookout and all I heard was next time I better double the recipe!

These were ok. Taste like regular biscuits to me. I really thought I was going to have a nice cheese flavor. Needs more cheese. I even tried it with mozzarella and basil.

Good.   A little dry, but that's to be expected with any dough that calls for beer and biscuit mix--at least in my experience.  I'm planning on serving with soup, though, and I think the triangles will great with that.  By themselves they aren't quite moist enough.  I think they need a bit more flavor--salt and pepper, some more cheese.  I added some old bay seasoning to the batter and could've added more.  I pressed into cake pans and cut into 8 slices before baking with my pizza cutter, then I put pats on margarine on just a few more minutes before the timer rang, and it worked well.  Thanks for the recipe!

I added a whole cup of "diced" cheddar and added about 3/4 cup of beer. Made into to drop style biscuits and cooked at 400 instead of 450. 450 Seemed too high to me.  Also added some flavor of dill, garlic and chive. Super easy to make but glad I added the spices or these would have been tasteless. Cutting in some butter might help, since they were dry.

This was ok.  I don't drink beer and used leftover beer from when a friend visited.  Used an amber ale.  The taste of beer wasn't real strong so it was ok.  I think if I were to make this again, I would add more cheese.  Since I don't drink beer I didn't think it would be fair to rate it a 3, so I gave it a 4 since it was ok and real easy to make.

Love love love love these!  I whipped these up with some chili, and my husband and couldn't believe how tasty they were.  I probably put closer to a cup of cheddar in mine and only cut out 8 wedges.  We will be eating these for years to come!

This is a very simple recipe that benefits from a few additions. I followed recommendations from other people and added extra shredded cheese (1 1/4 cup total), 3 tablespoons of softened butter, 1 1/2 teaspoons of garlic powder and about half a teaspoon of salt; I used a mild fruit-added ale made with summer berries because that's what I had on hand. I shaped the biscuits into traditional rounds (10) dropped onto a greased baking sheet and baked for 12 minutes 30 seconds. They were golden brown and moist. Delicious, I will be making these again.

Boring and not very tasty.  I used bisquick as other reviewers suggested, but all you could taste was the bisquick even though I added more cheese than was recommended.  I won't make this again.

Yummy!  Hubby loved them, too.  I don't use store bought baking mixes, but my own personal biscuit recipe using the beer instead of milk worked great!  Time to try out on family and friend :)

Very good! I served these with deep fried shrimp and it was perfect for thes meal. So simple yet very tasty. I was so surprised to see Odell IL pop up as I am your neighbor. I live in Dwight. Thanks for a quick and delicious biscuit.
