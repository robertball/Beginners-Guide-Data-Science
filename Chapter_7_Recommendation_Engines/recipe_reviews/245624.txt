This is perfect!  If you like Italian seafood - this fills the bill.  Make it - serve with a biscotto.  Finish with tiramisu.

I did not have cayenne pepper so ground some hot red pepper and used that.  I also cut down the amount of black pepper.  They came out delicious and will def make again.

I followed the recipe exactly. Some of the best scallops I've ever had. Everyone loved them.

I made this exactly as written and the sea scallops were perfectly flavored, cooked and delicious.  I served them over toast with the pan drippings drizzled over them as well as the Balsamic vinegar. Don't be afraid to have a strong hand with the Balsamic drizzle, but use a very good one.  I've made this many times. Lately in addition to the Balsamic drizzle, we've been adding a drizzle of black truffle oil and serving them over toast. Scrumptious!
