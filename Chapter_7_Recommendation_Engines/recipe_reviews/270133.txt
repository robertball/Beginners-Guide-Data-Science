Something is wrong with this recipe - the liquid to flour/cornmeal ratio is WAY off. 1 c milk to 1 1/2 c cornmeal doesn't make a "sauce" - it's barely enough to make the cornmeal stick together.

Adding about 1 1/2 c water made it "stir-able", but that was such a huge problem, I had to make multiple additional changes to finish it. Taste was fine, with modifications, but this recipe is wrong.

Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and easy to make! Although, you have to add a lot more milk to get the liquidity you want to be able to knead it well.

It does make a good rustic loaf, surprised I don't taste the corn meal as much as I thought it would.

What is the measurement of a pat?  1 Tablespoon?
I rated it 5 stars since the ingredients look great.
