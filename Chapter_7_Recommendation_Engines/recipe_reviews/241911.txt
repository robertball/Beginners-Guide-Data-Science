I am the one who submitted this recipe. Not sure why it doesnâ€™t say to make the loafs, then let rise again. The website changed up my recipe. Also do not over bake this! Also, the first rise should only take 1 to 2 hours, not 3 to 4.

Great recipe.  Moist and really good.  It would be great with or without the glaze.  I recommend letting the bread cool before eating it, and letting the glaze set, or the texture is a bit too moist (like a quick bread). That said, it's hard to resist warm bread.
