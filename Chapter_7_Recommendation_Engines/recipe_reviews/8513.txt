This was outstanding! All the flavors blended perfectly.  I was afraid the sherry would be overpowering, but it wasn't at all. I used poblano peppers (couldn't find regular chile or "aneheim" peppers, believe it or not)..they turned out great...they are nice and fleshy and complimented it well. Also I used a large can of peeled whole tomatoes cut in half, fresh vine-ripes were $3.99 per lb. I opted for the $1.99 can, and it was just fine. I topped with shredded jack cheese and a little cilantro over white rice to soak up the broth. We also enjoyed a nice cold ale with it, yum!

This was a wonderful recipe!  Instead of baking my own green peppers, I used one small can of chopped hot green peppers and it was perfect.  The chicken meat was moist and delicious with a fantastic broth.  Next time I might try chicken breast without skin to decrease the fat, but it was excellent with a whole chicken.

I have to admit that I was dubious about using so much sherry (especially in combination with the chile peppers), but this was really wonderful!  The broth had a great depth to it.  Given the high fat, sodium, and calorie content, though, we gave it four out of five stars.  A good one for those indulgent days.

If you like it spicy, you will love this!  I substituted 6 breast with bone in and skin.  Otherwise I followed it verbatim. The only real challenge for me was skinning the peppers.  I find that roasting for about 30 minutes seems to make it easier to peel, much longer and it is too difficult peeling them.

We found this to be really bland. Tons of salt and pepper needed and yet still bland. Definitely won't make this again.

Truly awesome! Note that different sherry's have different strengths in taste, you might want to taste it before adding the last bit of sherry. Also remember if your going to make a large batch and leave it in the fridge for a few days, it will get spicier as the chillies sit in the stew.

I did this in a slow cooker, to really get the richness of the flavor. I filled the pot with chicken stock and sherry in the same proportionate amount, but enough to make sure the chicken was covered.  First I slow cooked the chicken on low in the broth for 3 hours before adding the other ingredients.

The recipe suggests only quartering the onion, but since I wanted to leave the onion in the soup I cut into more comfortable bite size pieces. Next, I peeled 10 garlic cloves (slow cookers require increasing the aromatics).  I threw these into a pan and cooked on medium high, covered, until the onions started "sweating". This releases a lot of the oils inside them before they enter the lower temperature of the slow cooker letting them penetrate better.  

When there was two hours left I added the tomatoes. I also added the chili. Tomatoe cook faster then onion and garlic. In the last hour I added the 2 tsp thyme, and 1/2 tablespoon of thyme olive oil we had made.  I tasted it to see if it needed anymore chili, and decided it was fine.

Wonderful winter soup, so nice to have after a cold day.

I made this recipe exactly as written, and it was the best soup I've ever had. My boyfriend and his grandpa are always asking me to make more. 
We had a house full of sick people recently, so I decided to tweak the recipe a little. On those days we don't have wine or sherry, I add about a cup of tequila and some grand marnier. It's a magical sinus-clearing soup that makes you feel REALLY happy afterwards. Thank you for the lovely recipe!

Could not have made a better meal while being stranded in the house all day because of a blizzard!  I had to use what I had on hand so I substituted a small can of fire roasted tomoatoes for the four fresh, a tiny can of diced chilies for the four fresh green chile peppers, and mozzerella cheese instead of Monterey Jack.  Still came out perfect!  I made a pot of white rice and scooped some into each bowl before ladeling with stew and topping with a sprinkle of cheese.  My six-year-old loved it despite being a little spicy.

This is absolutely the best chicken soup/stew I have ever tasted.  It is hearty and glorious!  Don't scrimp on the sherry or the chili peppers!

OMG! This is DELICIOUS! I have three kids who never all like something and this totally pleased them all. I only did a few things "different" but not really. I used ~4 lbs chicken thighs, removed the skin beforehand. 1 small can chopped green chiles. 1 can diced tomatoes. Other than that, I followed the recipes exactly. Also, I served it in a bowl over some twist noodles. Soooo good. This is something I'm going to make often. Thank you, CBASS, for the wonderful recipe!

I would have to give this 3 stars as is, but next time I make this I will add less sherry in the end and substitute remaining liquid with chicken stock.  The 30 mins of simmering the alcohol out just wasn't enough and it tasted like I could get drunk from it.  My hubby didn't eat it until the next day when it was much better and the alcohol was completely simmered out, but he still complained about the overpowering sherry taste.  Good recipe though with a little tweaking.

I used chicken breasts and what I had: large can of diced tomatoes, can of diced green chilies, mozzarella cheese and it tasted great! The flavour of the sherry is hard imagine initially, but it does give the stew a deep flavour. Thanks for posting!

I did not use the full 2.5 cups of sherry, as I live in the buckle of the bible belt and all I can get without driving 16 miles is cooking sherry and it comes in a 12 oz bottle.  That being said, I filled in the rest of the liquid with stock, used one whole chicken breast and 3 boneless skineless thighs from the freezer and this is the best broth I have ever tasted. I almost did not add the chiles and tomatoes because it tasted quite good before the addition.  The kids are a little bit freaked out at the large pieces of onion and tomato though...  I will definetly make again, but maybe chop things smaller next time

This was a nice-tasting stew with delicate flavors. We enjoy white meat, so I used 4 bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts rather than a whole chicken.  I wasn't sure what kind of green chile pepper to use so got 4 Anaheims and that was perfect; there was not an indication in the recipe how long it would take to bake & blacken them, but mine were in the oven for about an hour; toward the end I turned the broiler on to get them going a little faster.  It is a bit of a trick to peel them at that point, so I just ended up dumping the stems and seeds and scraping the insides of the chiles into the broth; these gave a hint of heat and nice flavor.  I added about 1.5tsp salt to the broth (I used low-sodium broth!)  Served with grated Monterey Jack cheese and a garnish of cilantro, alongside toasted "French Country Bread" & "Garlic Butter", both from this website.  Thank you, Colleen!

fantastic. i almost had to stop myself from eating all the chicken while i was peeling it off the bones. i highly recommend making it in a pressure cooker because then your hour of simmering goes down to 20-25 minutes of pressure cooking.

Really good stuff!! I couldn't find the pepper the recipe called for so I purchased jalapeno peppers and the stew was not spicy at all... So I was a tad disappointed, but it was my fault. The chicken was so tender, it was lovely.

Simple, but good--the roasted chile gives it a bit of a kick in the back of the throat. Serve with crackers or tortilla strips--you'll get something pretty similar to most tortilla chicken soups (I mean that as a compliment). You could probably top with a slice of avocado and cotija cheese, too.

This received a unanimous thumbs up from my family. I used a combo of Anaheim and Pasilla peppers and broiled them to expedite  the peeling process. I also only had two tomatoes on hand so I added 2 cans of fire roasted tomatoes and 2 peeled and cubed potatoes to make it more hearty.Served it over brown rice. Yummy!

This was great!!  The sherry added a wonderful flavor. As suggested by other reviewers, I used 1 can diced green chili's and 1 can diced fire-roasted tomatoes. I used 4 hindquarters (what I had on hand).  Instead of pouring over rice, I added 1/2 cup barley in the last hr of simmering to help thicken it.

I'm not exaggerating: this is my most favorite thing I've ever made, and I make it a lot. It's become my "signature dish." Wish I could take credit for the recipe. I actually make batches as gifts for people. I like to use one habanero to amp up the spice and garnish with avocado cubes on top of the cheese.

I LOVE this stew.  I serve it with tortillas (either fresh or crunchy).  I sprinkle Monterey Jack cheese in the bowl, scoop the soup over it and sprinkle strips of crunchy tortillas on top.  Sour cream will reduce the spiciness as will the amount of cheese.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this stuff.

The only things I would change is I cut the pepper ammount in half ( it can make it very very spicy if you use too many) and I added rosemary and thyme for taste(about one tablespoon of each) I also added about one more cup of sherry and one extra cup of chicken stock. Not something for a picky eater though, but we all loved it!

Excellent blend of flavors! Kudos to this cook. Suggested changes: cut onions smaller/use 3 Anaheim & 1 Jalapeno peppers(use gloves!)/broth tasted much better before final addition of sherry-either increase sherry & chicken broth at beginning, or just don't add additional 1-1/2 C Sherry

This is how much I LOVE this recipe - I took some to work for breakfast, and printed the ingredients so I can make another one tonight. By far the best chicken stew I have ever made. Thanks so much!
