I liked the concept of this. It sounded so good. I realized I actually purchased steel cut quick oats. According the package. They just required a little extra time, in the microwave, over the Quaker quick oats. I didn't care for the chewier texture, but that is not the recipes fault. My issue is it didn't taste like an oatmeal cookie at all, and it wasn't quite sweet enough. I also had odd egg white bits in the oatmeal despite blending in the milk very well. I have never had a microwave oatmeal recipe call for an egg. I made Becky's baked oatmeal recently, from this site, and it may have raised the bar on hot oatmeal. That recipe also made storing leftovers with ease. Something important to me for quick and handy breakfast ideas during the week. Also, note, this recipe makes at least 2 good sized servings.

Really easy to make and packs a lot of flavor. Definitely will make again. This took 5 minutes in my 1000 watt microwave. Not quite the texture of an oatmeal cookie but the flavor is there.

Yummy!  I threw everything in a saucepan and made it over the stove.  The consistency was great and was done in 10 minutes.  Didn't have raisins on hand so I used cranberries instead.  Delicious warm flavor for this cold morning :)

Yummy and so easy to make for a quick and hearty breakfast! Definitely add the optional raisins and for a little crunch I added some chopped walnuts. I topped it off with a dollop of greek vanilla yogurt and a sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg. Thanks for a great recipe!

really good recipe. I made it the way it says except raisins because my daughter doesn't like them. she loved it!. Then I switched up the milk for almond milk,  coconut oil for the butter, and added a tsp of wheat germ and a tsp of flax seed, and a sprinkle of nutmeg... it turned out just even better and its good the way it is written.

Much lighter than traditional oatmeal by adding the egg.
