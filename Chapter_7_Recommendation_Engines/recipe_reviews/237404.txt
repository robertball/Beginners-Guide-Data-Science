Super easy recipe, really yummy result!
Made it just as is with 3 modifications. Had no dried garlic, so added an extra clove. I made smaller "patties", 12 and the size of meat balls.  I  also added salt. They were outstanding. Thanks for sharing

best turkey burger ever. the burgers cook in the juice of the onions, so these burgers are nice an moist.
 I use Hot salsa and a bit more than the recipe calls for. if your patties feel too moist, add some breadcrumbs.  This is one of my staple meals. thanks for sharing it!

I really enjoyed this recipe! The ground turkey I used was a little on the wet / finely ground side and because of that my burger patties wanted to fall apart; but they tasted very good; I loved the caramelized onion and melted cheese on top and the garlic flavor of the turkey burger. I caramelized my onions for about 15 - 20 minutes to get them good and browned and tender, but other than that followed the recipe exactly. Thanks!!

I substituted marinara sauce for the salsa and just used a large serving spoon to make the patties. They held up great and tasted wonderful! Hubby liked them as well, but thought they would taste better with the spicer Mexican flavouring.
I'll definitely make these again.

Excellent!! Made this several times now. I have added rolled oats or chia to keep it from crumbling and once replaced beans with lentils. Both are excellent. The men preferred lentils when polled...

This was a very tasty turkey burger.  I was just making one burger so I scaled the recipe down accordingly.  I omitted garlic powder and just used more fresh garlic.  The only other change I made was to add a little himalayan salt and fresh ground black pepper.  I didn't need to add any breadcrumbs. I just "dumped" the ground turkey and black bean mixture into a cast iron skillet with some olive oil and used a spoon to form a patty shape.  I served it on a bed of lettuce and topped it with the sauteed onions.  It was really good!  I'll make these again, but might spice them up a little more!

Edit - 6/28/17 - this time I was using a full pound of organic ground turkey.  I used a full can of organic black beans, rinsed and drained and mashed slightly with a potato masher.  I didn't have any salsa so I substituted some organic jalapeno sauce, cumin, dried cilantro and chili powder (a few shakes of each).  I again added some himalayan salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste.  This time I decided to add a little diced onion to the mixture so the onion taste will be in the burger as well as on the top.  I formed the patties on top of some waxed paper and popped them in the freezer on a tray.   Am looking forward to just popping one out of the freezer on nights where I need a quick, tasty and healthy meal!

Paleo!! These are fabulous! The meat mixture will be pretty wet prior to cooking which made me skeptical but they turned out moist and delicious:) I didn't add bread crumbs and I don't think you really need them unless you absolutely do not want your burger to crumble whatsoever. I ate them sans buns but hubby had them with buns and we were both impressed with their taste, texture and how nicely they held together. Try them!

These were good. I didn't want the cooked onions on top, so I minced about 1/4 of an onion and added it to the burgers. I also added some breadcrumbs, and they grilled nicely on the George Foreman.

Great recipe! Added 1/4 breadcrumbs & used Cuban style blackbeans for a little more kick. Also topped with fresh avacacdo, along w/ the onions.

I left out the salsa (don't like hot stuff), and added more beans to it. Like another review mentions, it wanted to fall apart on me bc of the added beans, but it turned out really tasty.

The flavor was fine, but it needs something to bind it together.  I ended up with a crumbly mess
