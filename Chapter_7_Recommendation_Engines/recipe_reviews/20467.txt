A good basic coconut pie recipe...the buttermilk gives it a rich flavor, I think. I made 6 of these in 1 week- 5 were for a church dinner. I used the "Bakers secret pie crust" on this same site.

Wonderful custard flavor! This is one of the most delicious coconut pies I have ever tasted. Its so amazing to me that the coconut and pecans float to the top, while the custard part stays on the bottome. I was afraid it would all blend together! Thanks Shirley.

"WOW.  Did I really make this myself??  Because it tastes like something from a 5-star restaurant"--that is what I thought every time I took a bite.  SO EASY yet SO SO SO yummy and unique.  I used home-made pie crust and half of the butter and can't imagine it any better.  Did I mention this pie is amazing?

I have been making this pie for years with just a few changes and it is always a favorite and highly requested at family gatherings.  I add 2 teaspoons vanilla, only use 2 cups sugar and up the coconut to 2 cups. I have made with and without pecans and it is great either way.

Freaking awesome.  After reading the reviews- here's what I did:  added a splash of vanilla and a handful of mini chocolate chips.  I only did 2 cups of sugar.   The amount of coconut is just right. I cooked it up in 8" pies- set up very nicely after the 45 min cook time.  The chocolate chips really add a ton to this pie.  My SIL said it reminded her of an Almond Joy bar.  What I will do in the future- add even more chocolate chips.  I will try a half cup more pecans, and maybe try toasting them ligtly before adding them to the mix.  They get lost in the coconut and sugar.

Wow!  This pie is going to be replacing my regular coconut pie recipe.  It is so simple to put together - just takes a couple of minutes, and the flavor is outstanding.  I wasn't sure about pecans in a coconut pie, but they go great together.  I filled 2 regular pie crusts and had a little bit left over so I grabbed my small cast iron skillet and poured the remainder in it and threw it in the oven for about 15 minutes and it was great even without a crust.

This was very good.  I did cut the sugar back to 2 cups, and will try cutting it to 1-3/4 cups next time, as it was still a little too sweet, and I'd like the tangy flavor of the buttermilk to be a subtle background note.  (Remember, the coconut is also sweetened).  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla.  It was a nice, light dessert, and I will definitely make it again.  I used Trader Joe's frozen pie crusts with this and they were the best pre-made pie crusts I've ever found.

I used the 9-inch pie crust, it took about an hour and half to cook. I love the custard texture with the crunchy pecans. But it's to sweet for my taste.

I don't know what I did wrong but this did not taste good to me. Coconut and pecans are one of my favorite food combos - how can you go wrong? The flavor of this pie was not tasty or delicious, unfortunately. I was expecting something "more" but it seems to be missing something in the recipe? Maybe some vanilla?

this recipe is most definitely 5 stars or better.  it is a kicked up cross between pecan pie and coconut custard.  i used the butter pie crust recipe on this site and this entire recipe fit in my 10" ceramic deep dish pie pan and that is using extra pecans and extra coconut.  the wonderful aroma in the kitchen and house for that matter is worth the reccipe alone. it is my second time making it today, and i am taking it to an office dessert contest tomorrow so i will see if i win!

I just made this pie for my family at Christmas! It was really great.  Everyone loved it and my dad even said he thought it was much better than my Grandmothers coconut pie recipe.  That's saying alot.  The only thing I will say is, I guess after reading too many coconut custard pie recipes, I remembered reading somewhere that the pie was done when you pulled a knife out clean from the center.  Well, that little rule doesn't apply to this pie so mine was slightly overcooked.  But everyone still loved it.  I can't wait to try it again and actually remove the pie after an hour.

Delicious! I didn't have enough granulated sugar, only 1/2 cup. I used brown sugar to substitute white sugar. I made my own buttermilk using milk and vinegar. I also didn't have pecans so I used walnuts. Delicious. I'd say a great sucess! I had to bake for about an hour and 25 minutes. The top was golden brown.

Yum! This is very different, and very good. It's like a custard pecan pie. My kids loved it! I did add chocolate chips as recommended by another reviewer. If you like choc. then add, if not, leave out. Will be good either way. I did have extra (made one 9 in. pie) and put it in a casserole. I think next time I'll just put it all in a casserole and skip the pie crust! Although I used the Easy Pie Crust recipe from this site and it really was simple. Could be served like a warm custard pudding. Very good recipe!

i was really hoping for a delicious pie. ack! the pie has been in the refrigerator for six days (only 2 slices have been tasted)... We did not care for this pie. "Grandma's coconut pie" is much more appetizing than this one.  (in addition, this pie is greasy.)

This was a wonderful recipe. I took some to some of my favorite ladies at the nursing home and the next day she said it was so good, it reminded her of home when she was a little girl. She's 97. Thanks for letting me make her so happy.

Nice pie.  My husband loves coconut pie and buttermilk pie, so I thought this would be a winner.  He said it reminded him of the pecan tarts he ate as a kid.

Do you keep this in the refrigerator after it's baked or leave it on the counter?  I love it!  Tastes yummy--a little sweet.  Might put a little less sugar next time.

I made these pies yesterday, and I have to say it is probably the best pie I have ever made. I agree, adding chocolate chips would be wonderful and a graham cracker crust would also work wonderfully. If traditional pecan pie is too sweet for you, this pie is a remarkable alternative for the pecan lover. This pie goes straight to the top of my Thanksgiving menu from now on.

Hmm I really love the topping; makes an awesome icecream topper. Not so much for the custard part though (not for us). For some reason i can taste a little egginess the next day. I don't get a chance to experiment with coconuts that much but im diggin' the coconut/pecans combo. Kinda inspired now!

I can't say myself if this pie was delicious because I can't stand coconuts.  But I made this for my Boyfriend and he loved it.  He said it was very rich and flavorful.  The only problem was that I made my own pie crust from scratch, but I didn't prebake it in the oven before I added the filling(DUH).  So the filling saturated the pie crust and made it a little soggy.  But that was totally my fault.  Next time I will definitely bake the pie crust beforehand and then it will be perfect.

Fantastic.  Before mixing filling, line pie plate with crust...and after removing from oven, cool completely before cutting.  My family LOVED this, though I must agree that it is rich.  Small pieces are plenty.

This pie is wonderful.  My husband loved it.  It looks gorgeous too.  It is rich and sweet.  It does make 2 pies!  I froze one.  We shall see what happens when I thaw it.

This was absolutely awesome.  I am a novice cook, and it was really easy (even while feeding my finicky 2 year old while making it).  It is rich but delicious.  I will be happy to bring this pie to my first Thanksgiving table.

Thankyou for the recipe.

This was very easy to throw together. I made one large pie and it was done in one hour. Everyone agreed that it was very good. Rich, super sweet, creamy custard. My company did not think it was too sweet, but I do think the sugar could be cut a bit. I may make this again. Thank you for such an easy, yummy recipe!

I made this for the first time this Thanksgiving.  My buttermilk had spoiled so I made my own??
This pie is sooo easy to make and tastes sooo decadent, like it took hours!!!
This is now a Hughes Family favorite??

My husband and I loved it!! It's good warm or cold. I don't think it's as rich as pecan pie, not as strong of a coconut taste as in a coconut cream pie, but just really nice.  I wonder what it would be like with some German chocolate chips in it?

This was insanely delicious. It is divine. I can't wait to eat it again. I made a gluten free crust for it, and no one could tell. This is definitely worth making, it has good presentation, it's different but not weird. Yum!

was looking to make a pie that wasn't apple or pecan pie... this was perfect, the coconut flavor was great and the texture is delightful. Followed the recipe as is, could see that some chocolate added in would make this even more yummy!

I'm not a huge fan of making pies and average 1 pie every 10 years. This pie was easy to make and had great flavor, texture and held together very well. I took one of the pies to work where it was a major hit. I will definitely be making this recipe again soon.

I make my own buttermilk with a scant cup of milk & fill to the line with red wine vinegar.  I lined the pie edges with tin foil for the first 30 minutes and then took if off for the last 15.  I used Marie Calendars deep dish pie crusts from the grocers freezer.  This recipe fills both of them.  A great recipe!!

This was a great coconut pie!  I followed the recipe exactly, but added a splash of vanilla.  I made one with pecans & one without. The were both fantastic and not too custardy.

Very good.  It's a very creamy cocunut pie with a mild pecan pie flavor.  I will most certainly make it again.  I cut the ingredients in half b/c I only had one pie shell.  The filling fit perfectly into a 9 inch deep dish crust.

Perfect for people who don't bake much (or in my case, at all)! Amazingly simple with a wonderful taste. Two coworkers asked for the recipe at our Thanksgiving function. Made two more pies for the family and they loved it! This one's a keeper!

I left out the pecans becuase I din't want it to get in the way of the coconut flavor, because I love coconut and am not too crazy about pecans. The pie is very sweet, but still good. Next time I will put foil around the edges of the pie crust half way through baking because the crust did get a little too dark for my likings. A very good pie though.

VERY rich and almost too sweet.  It was good but I still prefer the smooth and creamy texture of a traditional coconut custard pie.  My "sweet-tooth" 16 year old son only had one piece as he found it a bit much too. I am glad I tried it though as I enjoy trying new recipes and appreciate that people share them!

This is a great pie with little effort. A dollop of whipped cream and you have it! If I had it to do over, I would have made more of the filling but I asked for  ingredients for 6. It was delicious tho! Thanks Shirley

This pie was EXTREMELY RICH, almost too rich for me to eat. It was very buttery...eat only the tiniest slice at a time. If you love butter, you will love this pie. Also, it was kind of pricey to make, but worth it.

Lovely pie.  I made a half recipe for a single pie.  I also used a scant cup of sugar and added a half tsp vanilla and touch of nutmeg.  This was a great pie.  It did get really brown on top at 45 minutes so next time I'll check it at 35 minutes.  I'd rather it not be as brown.  But it was a great pie

My grandkids like this, but I don’t think I will make it again. I did add 3/4 cup mini semi sweet chocolate chips and a capful of vanilla.  I toasted the pecans and prebaked the crusts for about 5 minutes. My two 8” pies baked for 40 minutes and I had enough filling to make 2 little ramikins.  They turned out perfect.  However, I wasn’t crazy about the custard mixed with the pecans, coconut and chocolate.   I should have realized that 6 eggs (and the description itself) plainly told me it was custard like pie!  I have made something similar before but it has sweetened condensed milk instead of the eggs.  I will look for that recipe the next time I have a craving for a decadent coconut, pecan desert.

This is very easy to make and tastes great. It took a little longer  to bake. Just make sure it's set in the middle. I also reduced the sugar to 2 cups which was sweet enough for me.

I was very optimistic about this pie while making it. Sadly, the pecans overpowered any taste of coconut. There wasnt much custard. Overall, it didnt taste bad at all but it just isnt coconut pie. I wil give it another shot without pecans and submit another review. Timing for cooking at 45min was accurate so the instructions are good at least.

I made this pie, and it was delicious, but next time I will reduce the sugar to 1-1/2 cup or even less, if using sweetened coconut flakes, I did one with just pecans and coconut, and the other I made coconut, pecans and a few chocolate chips   I also made my own buttermilk, by mixing   a plain yogurt and skim milk, delicious

My husband & I love this recipe! I did add a teaspoon of vanilla per pie, and a handful of mini chocolate chips, but I’m sure it’s delicious as written. Just FYI, I’ve tasted this pie when it was still slightly warm from baking, at room temperature, and after refrigerating, and I think the flavor is superior at room temperature.

My husband and children devoured this.  I added a handful of chocolate chips to the batter and served with fresh whipped cream which I highly recommend.  I also prebaked the crust for about 10 minutes before adding the filling which ensured it baked through.

This pie  is die for.  I made two in one week for different set of friends and both raved about it.  I added 1/2 C mini choc chips to one and I prefer it with the chips but it was a hit w.out them as well.  Several people asked me for the recipe.  Best coconut pie I have ever had. Use a deep  dish pie plate, not enough filling for two pies but too much for one pie. Or plan on pitting extra filling in ramekins for pudding.  If using sweetened coconut ( that was all I had) reduce sugar to 2 cups.  Next time I will reduce sugar a little more. I have a convection oven and my pie baked in about 45 min.

I have made this pie recipe twice. The first time i cut the sugar to 2 cups and added 1 1/2 tsp vanilla. It was still to sweet so next time a cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cup and it was just right! Very easy to make.

This was fantastic! I'm giving it 4 vs 5 because I made a change I think is necessary to make it 5. I read other reviews and used 2 cups of sugar but I also used unsweetened coconut.  The recipe doesn't specify. (My family won't eat sweetened coconut but they did discover they like fresh, or unsweetened, coconut.) It was the right call (unless you really do want it to taste like a candy bar.)  I sprinkled mini chocolate chips, after baking, around the rim so that people COULD have chocolate if they wanted it. Not necessary for a high rating though.  The base pie without chocolate is GREAT! I will make often.

Found this recipe years ago and made it for extra credit in my French II class. I left the extra one at home and my family ate it before I came back from school. Now every year for Christmas or Thanksgiving I get asked to make it, Thank you so much for sharing!

I made this for a family gathering last night.  I used Pillsbury purchased pastry crust, added vanilla, used 2 cups sugar  as suggested by previous reviewers and lightly parched the pecans in an iron skillet on top of the stove.  Three generations of people loved it.  Next time will try it with the chocolate chips.  Thanks.

This was insanely good. Followed the recipe to a T. Makes you look like a pro, the pie separates into 3 distinct layers with different textures. Loved it on Thanksgiving.

This was THE hit dessert at our Easter get-together. I used a graham cracker crust from this site, left out the pecans, and increased the coconut until it looked like enough and replaced butter with margarine. The top was crispy, and custard-y in the middle.

This is an awesome coconut pie!  Since i made it the first time I've had to make several more do to requests.  At work we have a couple of guys who you wouldn't normally be able to get them to eat sweets (gym-aholics) but when I bring this in they can't get enough of if.  A few have even exclaimed "this might be better then sex".  If your on the fence about making this recipe or another, choose this one.  Its not your traditional Coconut Cream pie but it is well worth the try!

I made two  8" inch pies with about a cup of filling left over.  The pies turned out perfect, baking for 43 minutes.  Although good, this is more like pecan pie, and nothing like coconut pie.  It's VERY VERY sweet.

Oh my gosh, this was wonderful!  
I did use real butter, and whole Spelt flour, with organic coconut flakes.  It was extremely creamy and velvety soft.  
Taste's better than my grandmas. :) And so much healthier!

I made this yesterday and it came amazing. Instead of using a round pie pan I made it in a 9 x 13 dish and let it bake for about 50 minutes. It was anazing. I had company over for lunch today and what they didn't eat here they took it with them. It was a big hit. I also made my own crust.

This was my first attempt at a "custard" pie..and the first time tasting one too!  I thought it turned out great.  I used regular milk instead of buttermilk bc I didn't have any, and substituted walnuts for pecans bc that was what I had on hand.  Definitely suggest covering the crust for half of the cook time.  Great recipe!

I CAN'T BELIEVE I FORGOT TO ADD SUGAR! It was hiding in the first line of the directions. Anyway, we didn't let it go to waste and used an icing based on condensed milk. Very tasty, I can only imagine it w/sugar! thanks!

I really liked this.  I wouldn't give it 5 stars, and it won't become a staple.  However, it is so quick and simple to make and does taste good that I will keep it on hand when I need a dessert quickly.

I made this pie for my boss's birthday and she loved it!  In fact, the whole office loved it.  I had to give the recipe to several people in the office and to one client.  Thanks!
