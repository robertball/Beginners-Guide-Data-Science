Wonderful wonderful wonderful!  Great flavor, tender chicken, wonderful aroma.  My husband had no idea that it was "light".  You've got to make this recipe.  THe only thing i did differently is I forgot fresh mushrooms.. so i used a can of mushrooms.  Great recipe!

This was a pretty good dish.  Boiling the chicken gets it very tender.  Be prepared though, because preparing it gets quite messy.

This recipe was ok; I think if I made it again, I'd use less liquid.  I think with just the wine and 1/2 the broth it would be better.

This dish was OK but I would not make it again. I do not think it tasted like stroganoff.

Your guests will think you have made beef stroganoff.  Only when you cut into the meat do you discover that it is chicken.  Very tasty alternative to beef stroganoff.  I will definitely make this again.  Even the kids, who are tired of 'another chicken dinner' liked this one!

Stupid recipe.  Why bother with using chicken and then cover up the taste with beef broth and browning sauce.  Use chicken broth and a little worcestershire, thyme and parsley for added flavor without covering up the taste of the chicken.  The ketchup is only useful in beef recipes, it does nothing but turn the sauce pink here.  Better to use a little (1 T.) Dijon mustard instead.

This is a great alternative to its red meat counterpart.  I substitute chicken broth for beef and omit the ketchup.  Love the taste!!  :)

This was a bit bland and watered down but still good.  The browning sauce made it look really impressive.  I would add pepper and other spices to add more flavor though.  I didn't think it tasted like a stroganoff.

This is a great tasting recipe, I think I like it better than the beef version. The only change I made was I added a little diced green pepper to it. We will be making this again for sure!

Absolutely SCRUMPTIOUS! Husband and picky 4 yr old approved!  I used all of the ingredients called for, but not the low-fat or low-salt versions- and broth in the place of white wine. This will be my regular stroganoff recipe!  I'm looking forward to trying this with beef also :)

My boyfriend liked this. He was surprised that it was chicken and not beef. I, however, was not a fan. It definitely could have used more sour cream. I don't think that it was creamy enough. And it almost had a sweet flavor.

Excellent!  I did not have browning sauce, so I just cooked the chicken in olive oil.  Very good -- will make again and again.  It even passed with my husband who does not like mushrooms.  Please make it with fresh mushrooms, it is well worth it -- they are so good!

This is one of my favorites!  I crave it every now and then.  It takes a little time and effort, but not too bad.  Good left over too.  I think it's the browning sauce that makes it so good.  Don't leave it out!!

Delicious!  It did make quite a bit of sauce - but everyone in my family told me to make it again.  (A rare thing!)

My family really liked this recipe. I thought it had an "odd" taste with the first bite, but it quickly grew on me.  The only change I would make is to use a little less browning sauce (maybe use 3 tbl instead of 1/4 cup) and reduce the liquid just a little bit. I will make this again.

This recipe was simple and tasted great.  My only concern was that next time I don't think I will use so much browning sauce.  It was a little too much for me, but otherwise the recipe was perfect.  I will definitely make it again.

The family liked it, but it seemed to lack a little seasoning.  Will make again and tweak a little.

Very good! I didn't know what browning sauce was so I used boxed brown gravy and it worked just fine. Whole family loved it for dinner and as leftovers for lunch - even my toddler!
