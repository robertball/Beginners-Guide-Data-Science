I'm totally on a diet, buuut weekends are for cheating. I really needed something sweet and this simple and delicious apple cobbler hit the spot. I made as directed with no changes and it was great.

Will definitely make again,  but would add more apples to make the proportions between apple and topping a little more equal.

I made this as directed except for the sugar. I reduced the sugar by almost half (it's just what I always do). I also used brown sugar instead of white in the granny smith apples mixture because I was running low on white.  As noted in the recipe, I used 1/2 and 1/2 milk as a replacement. Very tasty! The topping is what makes this special. Served with a bit of whipped cream on the side. Delicious with coffee :)

Very easy and delicious! I used a casserole dish and a little less sugar and it was great. I wasnâ€™t able to spread the batter to cover my apples but once it baked the dough fluffed up and covered it all.

YUM YUMYUM!  I didn't have a 9 by 9 pan so used my 9 by 13 and increased my apples to  fill it up (probably about 10 cups), every thing else the same except only had 2% milk and cut the sugar back a bit  I will be making this again.

Tastes really good for such a simple recipe.  And it's pretty forgiving - I realized after 15 min that I'd forgotten to add the sugar to the biscuit topping, so I did a heavy sprinkle of cinnamon sugar.  Came out fine. Yum!

Yes, I will make this cobbler again.  After reading previous reviews, I increased the amount of apples to 6 cups and made a double batch of topping.  It came out finger licking good!  I also used a combination of apples to give cobbler a richer taste.

This was a hit with my family!  I put a little less sugar in and more apples.

I have never made a cobbler or really baked anything.  Substituted flour with GF flour substitute but otherwise did the recipe. Got rave reviews from everyone.

Very good. I doubled it and used a 9x13 pan. I used less sugar. 1 c. when doubled  with the apples, as some suggested. Disappeared quickly! Less in crust too.

No changes this time except about 1/3 less sugar. Half the sugar would be just fine.
