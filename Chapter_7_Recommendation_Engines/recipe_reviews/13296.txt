This recipes is very good, but I changed it up a little.  I cooked my chicken in olive oil and some seasonings.  I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and 1 can of broth, and for some extra flavoring I used more regular chili powder and a few dashes of hot chili powder because my husband likes a little kick!  I used 2 cans of garlic, basil, and oregano flavored tomatoes and only canned green beans and corn for the vegetables.  I decided to add rotini pasta as suggested in another review and my family and I decided this made the chili so much better.  If you do add the pasta, you will have to add about a cup or two of water. It was delicious and I will definitely make this again!

EXCELLENT recipe!  I turned this soup into a hearty stew by making only a few changes.  I did what some reviewers did by browning your cubed chicken with olive oil, lots of garlic, garlic salt, and pepper.  Also, I only used one can of chicken broth and added one cup of water.  Then during the last 10 minutes of simmering I added half a box of rotini pasta.  Turned out perfect and delicious!  Thank you!

This recipe is great.  In the morning, I throw all the ingredients into my crockpot (chicken and veggies still frozen!) and by the time I get home from work, I've got a delicious stew.  I crumble up some tortilla chips in it...my husband and I love it!

I wasn't too sure this would be very flavorful, but gave it a try anyway.  YUMMY!  I made a few adjustments that I highly recommend if you enjoy a good amount of flavor.  I fried the chicken in light fajita seasoning and fresh garlic.  I used only green beans and corn.  I used regular ro tel.  I also fried some fresh garlic with the onions and pepper and used a TBS of chili powder.  Even better if you shred some jalepeno jack on top.  BOTH my children 5 and 2 ate this!!!  THEY ATE ALL THE VEGGIES!  Trust me...a must have recipe for any family!  Thank you for sharing!

This recipe is so tasty and easy to make. I'm far from a good cook and this stew comes out excellent every time. My aunt is Portuguese (from the old country) and the best cook, she went crazy for this soup! She even asked me for the recipe!! Now that's a first!

As Mr. Burns from the Simpsons would say, "Exccellenttt!" This stew is fantastic and we truly enjoyed it after a hard day at work. Served it with a loaf of French bread and called it a complete meal. Definitely will make it again in the future.

I made this in the crock pot this morning so it would cook for lunch while I was working on some chores. I threw everything in raw--except the chicken which I quickly cooked in the microwave.  Any substitutions were made strictly because I was trying to clean out my fridge.  For the veggies I used some leftover baby carrots and green beans, I also added some fresh garlic and salt and pepper.  I upped the chili powder to 1 1/2 teaspoons. I also threw in a handful of tricolor pasta for the last half hour. This was really really good. I think maybe next time I will add the extra can of cream of chicken that other reviewers used.  I really have no complaints.  My kids and I have been picking at it all day.  This is a must have for your recipe box.

Soup, stew, who cares? What matters is this soup/stew rocks. My roommate was saying "five stars" after every third bite. I used canned corn and frozen green beans for the veggies, doubled the chili powder, and reduced the chicken broth to 1 can, as per previous reviews. Thank you Corwynn ~ you never disappoint me. :-)

This was great! The only change I made was no green pepper because I didn't have any and lots of chicken because I had lots of it to use! I took a full crockpot (the large size) to the church potluck and brought home only enough to fill one bowl! Lots of compliments from family and church family! Thanks for recipe!

Definately more a soup than stew.  The was awful.  I only made it because it had a good rating.  My husband took one bite a refused to eat anymore.  He has never done that ever.  The tomatoes in it gave it a weird flavor.  If you still plan on making this after reading this review at least omit the tomatoes.

This was really tasty and smells great! I made it for the first time and didn't make any changes to the recipe. Next time i would add a little salt & pepper to taste. Makes a great meal for cold fall/winter nights! I will definately be making this again.

Love this soup! Very yummy and easy to make. I was afraid that it'll taste like Campbell cream of chicken soup but it was far from that!   The only change I made, is that I omitted the chicken broth since the cream of chicken and water already add lots of flavour to the soup. Had also browned the chicken beforehand with olive oil, garlic and sliced chilli. Mommy, who love spicy, gives this a thumbs up as well!

This was very good, I gave it four stars because I like a little bit more flavor, but overall was tasty.  I added noodles to it like some others did.

Very good! I'm impressed. The picky kids ate their veggies!  I used 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can cream of celery, 1 can chicken broth. I used a can of Rotel, as another suggested, instead of tomatoes. Nice flavor and the tomatoes were small enough for the kids not to complain. I sauted garlic, onion and bell pepper and put in crockpot with raw chicken and rest of ingrediants.

Definitely a soup consistency compared to a stew but still tasty!  I only used one can of chicken broth, added a can of corn and 1/2 teaspoon of cumin.  Easy recipe for a weeknight where you can literally just throw everything in a pot!

This was a quick meal. I think it is plenty tasty and the leftovers reheat just fine. My husband was not too impressed so I have had lots of leftovers all to myself.

This came out very tasty, but I did deviate from the recipe quite a bit.  First, due to time constraints and my personal preference, I used the slow cooker as other reviewers had also recommended.  I threw all ingredients in together except the vegetable oil, which I did not use, and the chili powder, which I realized too late that I did not have on hand.  I used 98% fat-free cream of chicken soup in place of regular, and I used two large uncooked chicken breasts.  I cooked on high for 3 ½ hours before taking the chicken out to cube.  Since I was out of chili powder, I used Cajun seasoning and cooked for another 30 minutes.  At this point it was still pretty soupy (probably due to the slow cooker), so I added a few handfuls of elbow macaroni for substance, a little butter for richness, and a sprinkle of instant potato flakes to thicken it up a bit more, then cooked for 10 more minutes.  For dinner that night, it was just okay, but when I added a little shredded Cheddar cheese and reheated it for lunch the next day it was DELICIOUS!!  Next time I will try it on the stove and follow the instructions exactly, just to see how it turns out.  Thank you, Corwynn, for a great recipe.

This was pretty good, after reading the reviews i made a few changes... i omitted the tomatoes.. used only i can each of chicken soup and broth, boiled some cubed potatoes, added a small can of diced chilies, and only about 1/2 tsp of chili powder ( hubby's a spice wimp )
i also scaled down the onions and pepper to only a half of each, added a little frozen corn.

this served the 2 of us for dinner and had lunch the next day :)

So yummy, easy, and delicious! I followed a reviewer's advice and made it in the crockpot- I threw in everything in the morning- raw peppers and onion, raw chicken, and a bag of frozen veggies- and it was pretty good. I served it with some tortilla chips and sour cream, and that really made it! I plan on making it again this weekend- thanks for the recipe and all the advice!

This was very good! I made a few changes...I didn't have any thawed chicken on hand, so I used canned chicken (which actually tasted fine) and I also added some lentils to increase the fiber (which I don't think I'll do again). I added some jalapeno slices (from jar) to the top (which was excellent).

Very good.  It makes a lot more than 4 servings though, but that was fine with my family because we all had seconds :)

I LOVE this recipe! I love making this in the middle of the winter. I add whatever i can find in the fridge that needs used. I also add some jalapenos to spice it up and garlic.

Fabulous recipe and even better topped with tortilla chips.  I loved the thicker consistency from the addition of the cream soup.  Use any veggies you want and have on hand.  YUM. :)))))))))))

Used two cans of cream of chicken. I can chicken broth.  Red and yellow pepper, kidney beans, peas and corn. Very easy.  Sprinkled shredded 3 cheese/jalepeno on top.

Good Enough for a weeknight. Easy enough my 14 year old daughter could cook this all by herself. Taste was better than average--I've had plenty of recipes that took twice as long to make that tasted half as good. Will keep for those despearate nights where I want something good for my family that doesn't stress me out!

Awesome stew.  I changed it a bit by sauteing the pepper and onion with a couple cloves of garlic.  I used salsa intead of the canned tomatoes, added some cumin and a big handful of whole wheat noodles- skipped the frozen veggies but threw in a can of corn.  Amazingly delicious!

Yum! I modified the recipe (only because I did not have green bell pepper on hand) Exchanged a red pepper for the green and a red onion. This is a great soup / chili, whatever you want to call it! I did follow suggestions from a few others and added pasta to the dish as well as shredded pepper jack cheese over the top of the soup when finished. Very good!! A keeper. Thank you :)

I love this stew. My 10 year old daughter loves it too. My 13 year old son hasn't tried it yet but I know he and my husband will like it . I used 2 cans of cream of chicken like others suggested and 1 can of chicken broth half a can of water and a chicken cube. I used a 10 oz can of rotel and added about 1/4 cup of salsa. This was very delish thanks for sharing

I live south of San Antonio, TX so I had to make this with a Tex-Mex flair.  I whipped this up in about 30 minutes.  I sautéed the onion, green pepper & garlic.  Then added chopped pre-seasoned, HEB Fully Cooked Fajita Chicken Thighs.  Add 2 cups chicken stock, 1-14.5 oz can diced toms and bring to simmer.  In a separate bowl I creamed 2 cans 98% FF Cream of Chicken Soup, 1 Tbs. comino (cumin), 1 Tbs. chili powder, 1 tsp onion powder, 1.5 tsp Spanish paprika, 1.5 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp dried cilantro leaves (I didn't have fresh or I'd do 2 Tbs. of that).  Stir and heat through.  I skipped the other veggies.  Top with shredded Pepper Jack cheese and serve with nacho chips.  FABULOUS!  Tastes like you're down on the Riverwalk!  Hubby is down with the crud and this is exactly what he needed to warm him up from the inside out.  And it is SO healthy!

I needed to change a few items for my picky son and for my very senior mother. I used a package of McCormick Mild Chili Seasoning Mix. The only kind of Chili Seasoning my son will eat. For my mother, I omitted the bell pepper. And I added a box of Garden Delight Rotini. It turned out great. Another chicken recipe to add to my arsenal. Thank you so much for a awesome recipe.

This was soooo good! We had a chili/soup dinner at church and I made this based on how good the recipe looked - I know, I shouldn't try new recipes on other people, but this was one experiment that turned out well! Add a dollop of sour cream and a few crumbles of tortilla chips. Delish!

I tried this because of the high reviews, however I thought it was pretty bland.  The first time I try a recipe I make it as stated - maybe changing it up will help this one out.  Needs more spice for sure...

Fantastically easy and healthy! Lots of flavor - my family all loved it, and I loved that they were eating their vegetables! I added extra chili powder, and I used canned veggies instead of frozen, and it worked great! I also thickened the broth with cornstarch mixed in about a tbsp of cold water. Freezes ok.

My husband liked this recipe, but I found it was more of a soup than a stew.  Next time I would try more of the condensed cream soup and less broth to make it creamier.  I doubled the chili powder as well to make it tastier.

I did make some changes, like the others. Used red pepper, two cans of cream of chicken, one can of broth. Also used diced tomatoes w/ green chilies for some flavor, you do need to drain the diced toms, makes stew to watery. Otherwise pretty good dinner!

My husband and I really enjoyed this last night for dinner.  Like another reviewer, I threw everything in the Crock Pot, then shredded the chicken and threw it back in before serving.  This is more a soup than a stew, so I might do like others next time and add more cream soup and less broth if I want a stew.  Added cumin, dried cilantro, basil, oregano, and garlic.  Also left out the green pepper since I didn't have any.

this turned out way better than I thought it would.  Was a little hesitant because I don't like using canned soups due to the high salt content, decided to try anyway with reduced sodium soup.  I will definitely be making this again.

Great dish. Made it in the crock pot. Grilled the chicken and threw in with rest of the ingredients. 4 hrs on high. Didnt include the chili powder and added a can of navy beans  Family loved it. Served it with a nice loaf of fresh bread. Will make again.

Better than expected.  I added dbl the amount of cream of chicken to make it creamy instead of soup.  I did not put in the can of tomatoes. I just can't see that being good with this recipe.

Mmmm...lovely on a cold winter night.  Used 2 cans of Cream of Chicken soup and only 1 of chicken broth.  Upped the chili powder to 1 tbsp.  Nice and thick and flavourful.

This was very good, very flavorful.  I boiled a whole chicken to make my own broth and get the meat I needed; didn't have any green pepper on hand so substituted a few cloves of garlic; used two cans of cream of chicken soup per other reviewers recommendations; and for veggies used broccoli/cauliflower/carrot mix.  Loved it, thanks for the great recipe!

Great soup/stew.  I would definately cut down on the chicken broth to make it more of a stew than soup.  I added snap peas, corn, petite diced tomatoes, carrots and some orzo.  I would delete the orzo next time and add spiral pasta.

This is a great recipe. I followed what others recommended...used extra cream of chicken soup to thicken it up. I also added rotini pasta, corn and garlic powder. It's perfect for fall weather!

This is a good, hearty and flavorful dish.  I added snap peas, cauliflower, broccoli, corn and carrots for the veggies which made a great combination!  I also doubled the condensed soup and cut the chicken broth in half, as recommended by other reviewers, and I thought that it was the perfect consistency.  Maybe a litle salty...I will probably use reduced sodium soup next time.

I thought this recipe was great! I used the 98% fat free cream of chicken soup to make it healthier. Also, since I love garlic and rosemary, I threw some of that in there also. It was delicious! My husband and friends really enjoyed it. Thanks

I have made this stew so many times simply because it is so wonderfully delicious and spicy. Sometimes I add a can of tomato sauce to make it more saucy, other times I add seasonings such as a little garlic powder, cayenne papper, and/or tabasco. I serve it with corn bread and a salad. It is one of my family's favorite meals. No fail, guaranteed delicious if you like stews!

Good but not great. Too bland and it needs salt. My husband can be picky, and he wasn't too wild about it. I probably won't be making it again.

This was easy and sooo good. My husband and son loved it. I used a mixed veggies that had okra, corn, green beans, potatoes, and baby limas and it was perfect with the chili flavor.

I liked this one so much I'm glad I doubled the recipe!  I did modify it a bit. I used a lot more chili powder and added tabasco sauce to give it a kick.  Instead of mixed vegis I just used a bag of frozen corn.  The best chicken soup I've ever had!

This is really good stew.  As some other reviewers have noted it is a bit bland as written but that was easily fixed with the addition of a little salt and an increase in the chili powder.  I had no bell pepper but I did have one baby bok choy which I added, chopped, to the mix along with carrots.  I had no frozen veggies so the bok choy, carrots, onions and tomatoes were the extent of the veggies in the stew.  I added some rotini (another reviewer's suggestion) and it became a very filling, thick enough, stew.  We loved it. I halved the recipe and we still have enough to freeze for another meal.  Thank you Corwynn Darkholme.

I liked this recipe very much.  I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers here and doubled the amount of cream of chicken soup and cut by half the broth; additionally, I also added garlic and pepper flakes for additional seasoning.  I also added a quarter cup of rice to the pot for additional umph.  I would definitely make this again.

The stew was good but I think it could have been better. Don't get me wrong my family liked it but when I tried to serve left overs everyone declined. I just took it to work for lunch, however, the chili powder was the right touch to give it that special  taste. Happy Cooking America!

I made this for my boyfriend and I and he couldn't gobble it up fast enough. It was really very delicious...and very easy. I am just a newbie...barely transferring over into the world of cooking and this was great. We dished it over some brown rice. It wasn't as spicy as I thought. Maybe some jalapenos next time. Super yummy.

This was decent. I think my husband liked it better than I did. I would likely make it again. I also used 1 can of broth and 2 of the cream of chicken soup. If I make this again I will pour off the diced tomatoes before using them. All in all a good recipe.

This is a delicious, healthy soup!  Since it is basically just chicken and veggies you can eat tons of it guilt-free.  I did make a few adjustments though.  I used Campbell's low-fat cream of chicken soup.  I omitted the green pepper and added kidney beans.  Also, rather than using mixed vegegtables I used sweet corn, which was a great contrast with the chili powder.  I will definitely be making this in the future.

I have made this recipe soooo many times. I add an extra can of soup and a box of frozen cauliflower and snap beans. It's perfect to make to bring someplace or just to treat someone going through a hard time.  Travels easily and I just add salad and a hardy bread.

This was a lot better than I thought it would be - very tasty!  I also used only one can of broth, increased chili powder to 1 Tbsp, and sauteed the chicken breast with southwest spices (cumin, cilantro, more chili powder).

This is a very flavorful stew. I cooked mine in a crockpot, but the next I will make on stove top, when you put in a crockpot the broth seems to evaporate more. The green bell pepper gives it a nice taste.

Excellent, very tasty and easy to make.  My husband made this for me as my Mother's Day dinner.  The consistency was more of a hearty vegetable soup.  (Thinner than stew and thicker than stew).  The only thing we might change next time is to substitute low sodium varieties of the canned items.
We'll make it again.

Taking the advice of the other reviewers, I decided to add extra flavor to this recipe.  I cooked cubed chicken breasts with onion, garlic & peppers, plus a little cumin and season-all.  I also subbed a can of Rotel tomatoes for the plain tomatoes and cut back on the broth, making it more "stew-y".  Overall, very tasty.  We ate this over noodles, but will try Mexican cornbread next time.

This was pretty easy to make and my kids liked it but my husband and I thought it needed a little a little more spices even after I doubled the amount of chili powder and put in a couple of pinches of cumin. I think next time I'll add a can of chopped mild chilies.

This is a good recipe (easy and yummy). It's more of a soup than a stew.  I only used 1/2 the chili powder because I thought it might be too strong for my kids, and they really liked it!

Very tasty! it's more of a hearty soup than a stew, and I used 2 cans of soup and 1 can of broth. also added some red bell pepper and chopped celery...maybe that's where the extra water came from. also I added only frozen sweet corn to give it sort of a corn chowder feel.  We ate it over baked baby yellow potatoes and it was delicious.

This didn't look like it was going to be that great, but it was!  I think the cream of chicken soup really made the stew.  It gives it a deep rich flavor like cooking with wine usually gives soup.  Great recipe!

I tried this recipe for the first time when I had my entire family over for dinner, (eight people). Every single one of my family member's LOVED it, and we ended up logging onto the website after dinner to print out the recipe for my mother, sister, and sister-in-law.
