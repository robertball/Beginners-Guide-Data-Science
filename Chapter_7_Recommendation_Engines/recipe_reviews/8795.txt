I baked these at 400 for 45 min to crisp them instead frying. I then brushed on the glaze that I had added a couple of dashes of tamari soy and baked at 450 until a little caramelized.  Delicious!

These were excellent! I love lime, so I will be making these again often. One trick to try for those who like crispier chicken wings is to let the wings sit in the flour (in the refrigerator, or course) for at least 30 minutes, longer if you have the time. It helps the flour to stick and makes the wings crispier. This is the secret to making them just like restaurant wings!

This is a wonderfully different way to do chicken.  I hate frying anything so after preparing this recipe as written a couple of times and having my kids fall in love with it I made a simple change.  Now I use boneless chicken breast halves and cut them each into three even pieces.  Then I bake them at 350 in the oven for about 30 minutes and finish with the same honey/lime treatment!

Delicious! 4-Stars b/c: the idea is fantastic but too many wings for the amount of sauce stated in the recipe; you must either make more sauce or fewer wings. Although I did bake instead of fry them they still came out really crispy. I seasoned my flour and chicken w/ garlic/onion, powder salt/pepper, sprayed my foil-lined pan and wings w/ a little butter spray, and made 1.5 times the sauce. I also added the sauce in the last 15min of baking. Total bake time was 48min at 400 degrees. Slightly sweet w/ a kick of lime. Served w/ Shrimp Fried Rice II.

My husband and I enjoyed the different flavor. The first time I made it I did not use the zest of lime, big mistake.  You must use the zest....

This recipe is awesome!!! I didn't have any fresh limes, but "real lime" juice in the plastic lime and used 3 tbsp and used more garlic. I mixed all the sauce ingredients, lined a 9x13 pan with foil, placed chicken and sauce in pan and baked until chicken was a rich brown color. My husband and I finished the whole pan of wings.

I tried this recipe with boneless chicken breasts, which I had on hand, for my picky, picky family.  I served it over white rice. It was an absolute HIT!

I just made this tonight! They were soooo awesome! The honey and lime just make it! I read a review below saying they were to greasy. Just place chicken after frying on a paper towel- and dab the oil away. They weren't to greasy at all for us. Infact, i didn't make enough!!! They are a hit here, and will make MORE and MORE of these again!!! 
Thank you for submitting this wonderful recipe!!

WOW! Very good...my tastebuds couldn't decide if these were sweet or sour but they were good. I made 18 wings AND 3 chicken breasts (cut into strips) with this method and enough "sauce" for all. Will keep this tantilizing recipe around. Thanks Jana!

These were really good. I did use an alternative cooking method, though, to try and cut down on the fat. I roasted the wings w/ a little olive oil, salt, and pepper at 400 degrees for 40 or so minutes, and for the last 10 mins of cooking, I basted with the honey/lime marinade. They were quite tasty and crunchy, with a good mixture of honey and lime flavor. A nice alternative to the standard buffalo sauce-based wings.

Sorry to say, these wings did not hit the spot with our group.  With high expectations from the positive reviews and the fact we enjoy lime flavoring (Chipotle chips and salsa - yum!), we were a little disappointed ... but, thankfully we had regular hot wings and crab wings prepared as well.  The wings actually lacked in flavoring.  The lime was very strong for sure and the honey sweetness was present, but it just was kind of "there" ... no zip or wow factor.  We first thought perhaps cutting back on the zest a bit would help on a second try, but we all were just too not impressed to bother again.  The dish was prepared as given except we allowed the flour coated wing to rest in the refrigerator about an hour in order to get the most crunch.  If you are expecting a sticky glaze, this is not that kind of coating.  Thanks for the chance to try a new wing, just can't recommend.  :o)

Made this tonight and I have to say they are absolutely out of this world!  Instead of grating the lime zest I used a potato peeler and peeled the green skin off the limes.  I placed all of the sauce ingredients into the blender and processed on high until the lime zest was small particles.  These are outstanding and there is no need to change a thing!

I really liked these!  BF wasn't as impressed, but I love lime so I really enjoyed them.  My sauce was thin, so it never got sticky like I expected it to, but maybe it wasn't supposed to.   I went for the oven method (400 for 45 mins), little too hot I think, bottoms browned a bit too much so will decrease temp a little next time.  But they were wonderfully crispy.  Thanks for the recipe, delicious!

I made these wings last week and they turned out super delicious! My husband thought they were great!And he's not the type that's big on sweet wings, but I think it was the tartness of the lime and ginger that kept him lickin' his fingers and going back for more! I made a double batch of the sauce because I used a whole bag of chicken drummettes instead of wings. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

made it exactly like the recipe, except I battered the wings with beaten eggs before flouring them and then added about 3/4 a tbsp of lemon juice. AMAZING WINGS. great thing to try so that you can get away from traditional flavors.

This went over really well with my housemates.  I'll defenatly make it again.  Also if your wondering how many limes to by the juice and zest, peal for any beginning cooks, from 1 lime just about the amount you need.

I was making about 40 wings for a few people we had over for football and one friend can not handle spice at all. Looking for alternative to honey garlic, I came across this recipes and boy, I was glad I did!     I added a little more of everything to have enough to use as a dipping sauce. Definitely one to make again!

These are sooooo awesome!! I didn't fry them. I did what other have done- bake them. I placed 3 lbs of wings in a 13 by 9 pan. Tossed them with some olive oil and sprinkled with salt and pepper. Put in oven at 400 for 40 min. Double the sauce. Drain the fat from 
wings and pour sauce over top. Shuffle them around so all wings are covered :-) Put back in oven for another 10 minutes. After this, shuffle them around some more and turn up heat to 450 for last 5 minutes to gut some nice golden color on them. Take out and let them sit for 5 min to redistribute those wonderful juices and then dig in! They are sticky, messy but oh so worth it!

I'm not crazy about frying so I baked chicken
   wings .What I did is what a reviewer said to do 
   I put the flour on my chicken wings and put them
   in the refrigerator for over a hour that made  
   them more crisper I think .I baked them at 375 
   for 35 mins took them out put the sauce on 
   on them for 10 more mins still at 375 then I like 
   my wings to be a little crispy so I put the rest of
   the sauce on them and turned it up to broil for
   5mins .They were sooooooooo yummy yum    
    yum .The reason I didn't give this a 5 star is 
    it needed more garlic and more lime and felt 
    it lacked a little something . But will try this 
    again with more seasoning next time. Thank 
    You Jana.

I made this using thin strips of skinless, boneless tenderloins, which I cut in half.  I added fresh cilantro from my garden to the honey mixture and it came out great.  I also beer-battered the chicken instead of putting in plain flour.   My husband said this deserves to be on a menu in a restaurant.  I served it with coconut rice.  The entire meal was a big hit and I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!

needed a lot of alteration ,so i'de say it's a great basic concept recipe for honey chicken . be specailly careful from over heating the sauce becaaus it will caramelize to give a very chewy unwanted taste.

the changes I made were:1) I did not use the lime zest as I didn't have real limes on hand....I used key lime juice only.  2) The other change was I doubled the garlic. I liked them right away. My husband (traditional wing fan) didn't love them at first/thought they were too sweet...but they grew on him....in the ende he decided he did like them. As noted this is not a thick/gooey sauce...but I rather liked that  about it. I used sea salt and fresh ground pepper.

We enjoyed this nice variation of wings. Instead of grated lime zest, I used lemon juice instead. The flavor wasn't too strong, just a slight tangy flavor as I bit into it.

These wings were awesome!  I ommitted the salt and added a generous dash of cayenne pepper to the flour mixture for coating the wings.  To the  wing sauce I added 1/2 a jalapeno finely diced.  Would definately make again.

I made these with boneless chicken breast cut into strips---I didnt have limes available so I had to use lemons and that may be why I didnt understand what all the hype was about with these, but th flavor was good overall. A few adjustments I made after tasting the sauce as is and finding it lacked a certain "oomph": added about 1/5 tsp red pepper flakes and 1 tsp soy sauce. Also, as other reviewers mentioned, its really important to let the chicken sit for about 20 min in the fridge after flouring until it starts to look dough-y

Delicious!  This dish is a hit at summer BBQs.  When I am pressed for time, I order fried chicken wings from the local Chinese food restaurant and pour the sauce over them.

I baked the chicken instead of frying it like some of the other reviews suggested.  Which was great, they came out crispy.  The only thing I would say is after they're done let them sit for 15 to 20mins.  My wings were very lime-y, which was fine for me but my husband thought it was a bit much.  After they sat and cooled a little the lime flavor wasn't as strong.  Still very good wings sticky, tangy, and sweet.  Perfect for a party or a snack for football games.

Not bad, very different kind of flavor. I made the glaze exactly as instructed but chose to bake the wings for about 50 minutes, adding the glaze during the last 15 minutes of baking. I advise making more glaze then recommended however, because I was barely able to coat all the wings. Good combination of flavors though.

This is an amazing recipe, although, I did have to make more sauce. I didnt follow the directions due to lack of ingredients, but the chicken still came out great! I used about 3/4 cup of honey, a clove of minced garlic, pepper, and about 7-8 tablespoons of lime, instead of lime zest. It still had the same kick and was great! I used about 18 wings, and also removed the skin before frying them. I let them sit in the fryer for about 10-15 minutes each batch. I do recomend after frying to use paper towels to absore the excess oils. Used a brush the glaze the sauce on, and repeated glazing it about 2-3 times. It lets the chicken absorb some sauce and gives it a greater taste. Enjoy :)

rather than frying - I baked these at 400 for 40mins and then brushed glaze on every 5 minutes until I was out of glaze so about 60 mins total cooking time - absolute MVP of our Super Bowl menu

If you fry the chicken wings I suggest you use corn flour instead of all-purpose flour. And you MUST put the mixture in the fridge for about one hour (freezer will do, 1/2 hour top) first before coating. The coating will be much, much more crispy.

My friend made these wings/drumettes for Superbowl XLII and they made a bigger splash than the game! Thanks for this intro Donna! I had to double the sauce recipe though and then added some low-sodium soy and chopped cilantro to it. Fab addition! Then simmered the sauce with a little cornstarch to thicken it slightly. In addition, I seasoned the flour with some onion powder, garlic salt and cayenne. Then baked, instead of fried, @ 375 for 45 min (flipping halfway through). These wings/drumettes are becoming a fantastic negotiating weapon for favors!

Great spring appetizer! based on previous reviews, needed a little "finessing" to bake. Baked wings coated w/ flour on jelly roll pan 45 min. at 400 degrees, brushed with sauce for about 10 minutes more 'til crispy brown, then poured remaining sauce over, and let sit in oven that was turned off until serving. Warm, not to "tacky to handle" and good cold next morning.

I had planned to make this for dinner, but asked my 13 year old to help me out and make the wings. He followed the recipe and they were delish! Very tasty, crispy and refreshing for a summer dinner. We loved the sweet and tanginess (sp?) of the sauce.

Made these last night and they were a hit with my family! I didn't have any lime zest so I just added more lime juice and a little lemon juice...also added a little more salt, peppercorn pepper, garlic and honey...only because I used more chicken wings.  Finger-licking good and I will definitely be making these again!

I made these for a birthday party. Everyone liked this recipe. I used both lime juice out of a squeeze bottle and then fresh lime drizzled over the wings prior to serving.

I loved it!!! I made them tonight for dinner and I was amazed with the honey flavor. I didnt change the recipe at all, all I did was season my chicken wings {which I didnt split} with season salt, garlic powder, & oregeno put then in the fridge for about an hour {longer if u want} then I took another reviews advice and coated them in the flour and put them back in the fridge for another 30 mins. I will make again, next time I will try to bake them.

We grilled some chicken thighs after brining, and then used the honey-lime mixture as a glaze (added about 1t of fresh ginger to the sauce, since I had it on hand, and also about 1t of olive oil) and these were fantastic. The honey caramelized on the grill and made a nice, sweet crust. Was excellent with grilled sweet potato fries on the side. I will definitely make this again, and bring it to the next BBQ.

Love the sauce. I do not deep fry my wings. So instead I took some flour, onion pdr, garlic pdr and cayenne and tossed the wings around. Placed on a baking sheet and refrigerated for an hour. Then baked at 400 for 45 min. Took the wings out and tossed in the sauce and then baked another 10 min. So good.

I baked these wings at 400 for 45mins per other reviews. I doubled the sauce and tossed. Yummy, did not expect such flavor for such few ingredients. I did marinate the chicken with tbsp each, vinegar, and brown sugar, salt and pepper to taste (overnight). My inlaws loved it and they are picky

I tripled the sauce, poured it over the chicken wings and put them in the frig for several hours.  I lined a cookie sheet with foil and baked them at 375 for about 30 min.  I basted them every 10 minutes.  They were golden brown and GREAT.  Nice fresh flavor.  We are having a Chicken Wing Cook Off at work on 9-12-08.  I'm submitting these : )  Thanks for a great recipe.

These wings were so yummy!  Perfect for summertime -- light but very flavorful.  I love the balance of the sweet honey and tangy lime.  After tossing with the sauce, I did pop the wings in the oven (350) for 15-20 mins just to set the sauce a bit, so that it adhered a little better to the wings.  These are the type of wings that are perfect along with a light salad or slaw, fresh corn on the cob and a fruit plate.  Mmmm mmm!  Thank you so much, Jana -- fantastic recipe!

Pretty good flavor but it would  have been better if it was crispier. I fried 1/2 of them and  baked the other 1/2. There was no real difference, so the baked version is a neater and healthier alternative.  I also tried breading the chicken with bread crumbs first, Not bad but the flour method was better

I'm a guy who's fairly new at cooking. Not only was the recipe easy to make, but the taste of those wings was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!

I love chicken wings, so I made this for dinner tonight as a treat.  I can't say enough about it.  I enjoyed the sweet and sour taste and the texture of the wings!  I have a breading recipe that I always used when I use to fry chicken and the flavors were awesome!  This was quick and easy and my family enjoyed it!  I will make this again!  Thanks for the recipe!

I really liked these wings. The lime gave them a nice tangyness and the honey kept them from being too sour. What a great combination. A nice change from the usual. Thanks!!!

I did not care much for these.  I added a little soy sauce to the honey mixture after I did a taste test to add a little more flavor.  I used a cheap brand of honey so that may have been my flaw, but I doubt I'll try it again. Thanks anyway.

Excellent!  I didn't have chicken wings so I cut some boneless breast into thick strips instead and served with rice pilaf.  Awesome taste -- a margarita would be a nice addition! Thanks - will definitely keep this one!

Unless I did something wrong, I really didn't think they tasted very good.  I thought the lime would be interesting, wasn't impressed.

Very good wings!!  Made these for Super Bowl and followed the recipe to the "T".  However, next  time I will season them a little more and double the sauce.  I did follow another reviewer's advice and let my wings sit in ther frig coated in flour.  I think this made them extra crispy and delicious!!!!

These were really good. Slight tang from the lime, slighsweetness from the honey. I baked mine at 400. They came out crispy and juicy. I did add garlic salt to the flour mixture. Will def. make again.

These were super awesome!  The only modification I made was to add a little salt to the wings after i tossed them in the sauce.  My 6 year old, 11 year old and husband loved them!

Delicious flavor!  I chose to bake instead of fry, as recommended by another reviewer.  The wings turned out great, but I would recommend flipping them halfway through cooking for crispiness.  I mixed the sauce onto my second batch of wings for the last 10 minutes of cooking.  Stickier and yummier...

Best chicken wings ever! I doubled the sauce because my wings were huge. Plus this added for extra dipping sauce. I like my wings extra crispy. I baked some and fried some, both really really good! Baking is easier and healthier so I will go with that from now on.

Hubby and I loved these wings!  I made these as one of three different kinds tonight and wish I would have made them all like this!  All the flavors were subtle but worked so well together and I loved that they weren't "swimming" in sauce.  Oh and I added just a little bit of cayenne, paprika, salt and garlic to the flour.

This recipe is awesome.  My husband and kids (all boys 9 and twins 6) loved them.  The flavor was tasty and unique.  I would like to try to grill the wings or bake them next time because we are trying to not eat fried foods.

This recipe was extremely delicious! My family loved the fact that I found a new way to spice up chicken wings. I followed the suggestion of another review and baked the wings instead of frying them. I love spicy food and this is why I seasoned the wings with some cajun seasonings before baking.  Also, I added some seasonings (red pepper and salt) to the honey mixture.  Also, I use more lime zest, garlic, and honey than the recipe called for. I remove the chickens during the last fifteen minutes and tossed them in the honey mixture and then continued baking them.  The wings were great and a pleasant change from the regular baked or fried wings.

mmmm... made these last night for dinner.  husband loved them!  i baked at 400 for 45 minutes, brushed on the sauce, broiled for 5, flipped, brushed more sauce, and broiled for another 5.  was sooo good.  better than frying!  i would suggest lining your baking pan with foil, since it does get messy.

Very tasty. My husband said that he is opening a restaurant and locking me in it. We're having it again tonight by the way...And a cooking tip if you've never fried before. Use a candy/frying thermometer and heat the oil to 320-340 degrees. Then put your chicken pieces in and cover, cooking on high until they're browned on both sides. Then reduce the heat to med-low and cook, covered for another 30 mins. You don't want to turn the chicken more than 3 or 4 times during cooking. Happy Frying!

I made these for a church potluck, and everyone wanted the recipe. I couldn't taste the lime very much the first time I made them. So I increased the amount of lime peel I used the second time, and they were perfect!!

This recipe is fabulous!  One small suggestion...for those who are frying chicken wings for the first time (like me), a description of how the wings should like before taking out of the pan (until golden brown) would have been helpful...salmonella chicken is not good.

I would give this a 10 if possible!  Used 2lbs of drummies and all other ingredients except the oil.  Added salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder to flour.  Baked @400* for 20 minutes then turned and baked for 15 minutes.  After that I brushed on the liquid & baked for 5, turned, brushed and repeated until all sideds were coated.  Turned out crispy and the flavor was great!  Everyone that sampled thise rated them a do again.  Thanks!!

Since my family does not like fried food, I tried it in the oven like one person suggested at 400 for 45 minutes. Chicken did not get crispy nor did the glaze really stick. Guess I'll have to fry it next time.

I was looking for a simple, easy yet yummy recipe for wings, this one hit right on the spot!, I did added my own touch to the mix, I seasoned my wings the night before with some garlic, pepper, some spices and added some cooking wine to the mix, left them in the fridge in a zip lock bag until the next night, they were smelling awesome. I also tried leaving them on the bag with flour for about half and hour as suggested by someone else here, and it did help to keep the wings crispy while frying.  I like the taste of the honey lime mix... my 4 yr old son, loved them he said he was going to eat them all :-), this one will be for sure in my recipe box and will probably be showing off next time I have friends over.  thanks

I only made 3 servings because just in case they didn't taste good I wouldnt be too upset for wasting the chicken!  But BABY!!!!!! This recipe will definitely be added to my box!  Next time, as a test, I am going to toss them in the sauce as the last step requires and then place them in the oven on 400 for about 10 mins or so and see how they turn out.  For extra added crispness here is a suggestion......flour the chicken and place the pieces in a glass dish covered in the fridge for about an hour or so (do not skimp on the timing).  Take them out, yes they may be a little sticky, and shake the pieces in flour one more time before you fry.  This adds a good texture and crispness to the skin. I've been using this step for a while now.  Got it from the "Restaurant style Buffalo Wings" recipe from this site.  I use this technique as a base for lemon pepper wings, buffalo wings, bbq wings etc.  They don't last long........I am going to make these Honey Lime Wings for a party next week and I will be adding a little fresh diced jalapeno pieces to a batch!!!  Thanks Jana!  This recipe is a keeper!!!

I can't review this exact recipe because I made the sauce and then marinated chunks of chicken which I later pan grilled, as I didn't have chicken wings. It still came out tasting fantastic and is officially one of our favorite recipes!

This was delicious! I made the honey lime dressing an put it on chicken breasts instead of wings. I cooked the chicken in a saute pan and then a few minutes before the chicken was completely cooked, I added the honey lime dressing. It soaked into the chicken and really gave the chicken a wonderful flavor!

tried these yesterday and thought they were amazing!!! i used more honey lime mixture to chicken ratio, there seroiusly wasnt enough for that many wings, and i made a couple of other alterations.  I wanted them healthier so instead of deep frying the wings i covered them in flour as stated and shallow fried them in a pan for one to two minutes on either side to get the crispy exterior, and then i grilled them for 30-40 minutes at 210 degrees brushing them with the honey-lime mixture every 10-15 minutes.  I did a taste test before i put the mixture on and loved it, it was sweet with the honey and had a subtle tangy hint of lime.  Next time though ill put aside some the the mixture and dumped the wings and the mixture in a bag after ive baked them and shake them around so its all covered with the mixture after ive baked/fried them as stated in the recipie so that the honey-lime taste is stronger on the wings.  Its a really good alternative to your hot wings :)

Instead of frying the chicken in oil, I threw the chicken on the grill and used the sauce mixture as a glaze.

It turned out amazing.  Tasted fantastic with guacamole.

I thought this was really good. But next time I will use double the amount of sauce it wasnt enough for me. I also baked it much easier that way. But eveyone like them and also I used advice from other reviews and added 1 tbsp of chilli flakes to give it some spice.

I ran out of lime so I used lemon instead and still it was an instant hit! I cooked this on Saturday when my boyfriend was going to eat at my place. He loved it. He even took the remaining home. Then I made this the next day and my family loved it. The chickens tasted expensive. :)

I was kinda hoping these would be crispier. I baked them like a few people said to make them crispier but it didn't work.  Maybe my wings were too big but in any case my husband and I were a little disappointed.  Because the overall flavoring is good, I'll probably try again.

My husband and I LOVED these wings.  The tang and sweetness of them was just right for a summer wing dish.  And they look pretty too.  We are making them again tonight and have shared them with friends who've asked for the recipe. Our sons still prefer the buffalo variety, but that's only because they like blue cheese dressing all over them.

This chicken recipe is so good and different.  You can definitely taste the lime, but it's not something bad.  I did seasoned the flour with powdered ginger and blk pepper.  I also added 3 cloves of garlic and some red onions which I blended with the sauce and it was excellent.  I wanted the chicken to be carmelized, so after coating the chicken w/ the sauce, I baked it for about 30 mins and it was excellent served with rice and a salad on the side.

The sauce was delicious. I marinated the wings for a couple of hours in the sauce before putting them in the oven. I also had no problem with the caramelization.

excellent stuff... though initially i was quite apprehensive about trying something with honey.. it turned out fantastic... everyone liked it :) i made a few changes in the recipe though... marinated the chicken with a bit of salt, ginger and garlic paste for about 2 hours... lightly washed the marinate off.. coat with flour and fry.I also sprinkled toasted seasame seed on top for presentation and taste! I also stir fried the chicken in the sauce under low fire for the honey to caramelise and coat the chicken better.....yummy.... I'm gonna make them again soon :)~~~~

I thought it was delicious.  I only had a couple of wings, so reduced the ingredients appropriately.  I did think that the amount of honey was too much for the lime juice, so I added bit by bit, until I got the right mix for me.

We thought they were pretty tasty. Corn starch works better than flour for crispiness though. We did
them in the oven util they were good and crispy. Saw the recipe in the magazine. Thanks!

My husband and I were not a fan of this recipe. The mixture was too runny so it didn't stick to the wings. The flavors together were fine for me but my husband did not like them.

Reading a LOT of reviews - the lime honey sauce was SO GOOD - we used boneless skinless chicken breasts. I made a lot of the sauce - had some left over - ATE IT SPOONFUL BY SPOONFUL over a couple of days the first time making it. I hope to figure out a few more uses for the ADDICTIVE sauce - it is SO GOOD. I ran out of limes - next time used bottled lime juice. The zest is wonderful - but even missing using bottled lime juice - the honey lime combination is still - amazing. This is such a hit!

I really wanted to give these a go, because the reviews were so great!  Sorry, did not like them.  We thought they were kind of tasteless.  Made exactly as directions called for.

I also baked these instead of frying them and they were fantastic! (baked first for about 45 minutes then added the sauce and baked additional 20-30 mintues)they were simple and quick(to prepare)and everyone I served them to, loved them! Will make them again

I did not coat with flour and baked them instead, for a healthier alternative. It is really tasty and the balance of honey and lime is just right. If I have had marinated it for longer, or even overnight, I believe it is going to be gorgeous.

I had high expectations based on the reviews, but these wings were not that good. Too much honey and the sauce was missing something! We dipped them in BBQ sauce and that saved them.

Cooked this last night.  Don't usually do fried, but made as recipe instructed.  Absolutely tastey!  Easy to make, and the sauce has a great sweet/sour flavor.  We even liked it as a cold left over.  Might be a great dish to send with divers on the boat for lunch.  Seems that it would travel well.

The sauce is to die for! I used chicken breast slices instead of the wings to make it healthier. Hmmm...considering other ways to use the sauce.

If I could I would give this recipe more stars because it is so good! We tried a orange sauce to it and it wasn't bad. Just put the orange juice and zest instead of the lime. Your family will LOVE this reciepe

My chicken wings came out horrible but that was my fault. I baked them and tried to get them crispy but instead the chicken just ended up coming out like rubber, so be careful if you do bake. However, the sauce was delicious! I added soy sauce to it and a little bit of ground pepper flakes to wake up the sauce. Will use this sauce recipe again =)

Wonderful Wings! I coated with flour and baked at 400 for 30 minutes, made about a batch and a half of the sauce then basted with 1/2 of sauce, rotated and baked for another 10 minutes, basted with remaining sauce, rotated again and baked for another 10 minutes, results were wonderfully flavorful!!

I added about a half of a teaspoon of ginger.  Tasted amazing.  Also, I grilled them rather than baked or fried, so it cooked into them the last few minutes on the fire.  Yummers.

These were amazing; what a unique flavor! The kids just loved them. I used a 4 lb bag of chicken wings and doubled the sauce. I used 1 1/4 cups of flour to coat the wings, and after I shook them up in a bag I put them in a glass bowl and let them sit in the fridge for a couple hours before I deep fried them at 375 for 10-15 minutes. I don't think I put in a whole Tblsp of zest, either. I used two limes and then grated the peels with a cheese grater, which didn't work out so great because all of the zest got stuck in the little holes. I just scraped out what I could and the flavor was perfect!

This is a great recipe! However, I like my wings hot, no matter what. The only thing that I changed, was that I added a tablespoon of hot chili sauce (found in the Asian section). It was the perfect mix of sweet, sour, and hot.

these wings were amazing!  my husband even said they were better than any wings he'd ever had in a restaurant, and I agree!!  only thing I'll do differently next time is add a little more red pepper flakes for more spice.  other than that, this recipe is perfect!

These were great! light flavoring of honey and lots of lime taste. It was something pleasingly different if you don't like the regular Buffalo flavors. Will definitely make it again. Even DH who has his Buffalo sauce asked for more of this next time!

These were good. We usually make these with traditional hot wings for a variety. It's a little sweet with a tangy finish.

Great, son loved it.  Will definitely cook again and again.  However, next time I think I will bake the wings and then toss them in the sauce. Would even be great simply as a dipping sauce.

I was looking for a quick and simple recipe to use up some chicken wings, with ingredients I already had at home.  Found this one, and I was pleased with the results.  Simple to make, and the perfect blend of sweet and tangy.  These were good!

An easy and tasty recipe, however, the amount of sauce was perfect for about 6 - 8 wings so double if you are doing more.  Rather than frying, I baked them for 30-40 mins at 400 degrees and they were perfect.

Only reviewing the actual sauce as we didn't fry these or coat them with the flour mixture, we always just cook the wings on the grill and used the sauce as we grill.  Very tasty, will make these again.  We did a variety platter, some honey-lime, some teriyaki, some buffalo.  All were good!

I believe these have potential to be tasty.  I made them with boneless chicken breast which got a little dry when frying.  Next time whether I make them with wings or chicken breast I will bake them, would keep them juicier and healthier.  The sauce was great.

Delicious. Ended up baking them for 45 minutes at 400 after coating them with flour. Then added the honey/lime mixture to which I added soy sauce. Baked for 10 minutes and added more of the honey/lime mixture. Broiled for another 10 minutes and covered again with the honey/lime mixture after taking them out of the oven. Will definitely make these again.

This was OK, would not make again.  The dressing was a bit too watery, so boiled off the liquid and concentrate was tastier.

We really enjoyed these wings, so different, fresher tasting. I admit I did deep fry them, but having read all the reviews from people who baked them instead, I will try that next time, and there will be a next time for these.

These got rave reviews at the party I made them for, but I didn't really get the lime flavor.  Next time I'll up the zest/juice to balance a bit more with the honey.  Yummy.  Served 'em alongside Buffalo wings for those of us who like spicy!!

I'm from Buffalo so I'm always looking for something different to do with wings. These are awesome. I also bring them to parties-they are just as good cold. (A little secret you didn't here from me-we eat cold left over wings here-sometimes for breakfast with our left over pizza)

Delicious! I scaled the recipe to half, for just the two of us. I took the advice of another reviewer and let the wings sit with the flour on them for 30 min. before frying. It was only slightly too sweet, but still good. The combination of flavors is nice.

This was delicious and very easy to make. I added cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes to make the sauce extra spicy for my boyfriend. He loved it... The only thing I would do different is add less honey next time!

I have to say this was a great recipe.  My kids didn't rate it very high but they just like plain fried chicken with ketchup so they aren't good judges.  My husband absolutely loved them and said we should make them for a gathering we're having next weekend.

I make wings all the time, but had a taste for something different. I always broil mine, turning twice, until golden brown. The only change I made was to add a tablespoon of lemon juice. Once the wings were cooked, I put half of the sauce on them I baked 5mins more. Used the other half for dipping. We absolutely loved them. These will definitely be on the menu for my next gathering!!

Very different, but in a good way.  I didn't use the lime zest and I thought it was just fine without it.  I did bake in oven 425 for 45 minutes.  Then rolled in sauce and baked for another 5 minutes.

Yes, these wings are sweet. Yes, they have some lime flavor. But that's about all they have. As another reviewer stated, there's no "zing" to them. I felt I'd spent too much time on these to have them turn out so uninspiring.

These wings were good, but not great (yet). I took the advice and baked these wings in the oven at 400F instead of frying and that aspect of the wings turned out great. I baked them for 30 minutes, turning them halfway through.  I then brushed on the glaze and baked them for another 5 minutes, then turned and glazed the other side for 5 minutes more.  I found that there was no need to spray my non-stick roasting pan, as the wings have plenty of fat already. I do have to agree with some other reviewers and say that these wings are lacking in flavor and could use the addition of soy sauce and maybe some brown sugar. I will make them again with some additions and update the review.

These were great!!  I doubled the recipe for more sauce, and added some soya sauce for a little extra kick.  I'm severely allergic to cayenne so it's nice to have a wings recipe I can enjoy.  The rest of the family gave them high reviews too!

These aren't my favorite, but are definitely good- my husband LOVED them though.  I squeezed fresh lime juice on in the end for more flavor.

Oh yeah!  This is delicious.  We recently had a wing party with several different varieties and this was one of the favorites.  We had a bunch of wings made up with a coating on them, so I am sure it was a little different but I made the sauce and rolled the cooked wings in it.  I couldn't keep the serving dish full of these. After the party some guests were telling me, "I loved them all, but yours was the best."  I can't wait till our next party to do these again.

*Make sure you have a zest tool to capture that 1 T of zest, otherwise a bit of a pain.

I made the chicken wings according to another recipe I have and deep fried them. Then I made the sauce and used it to dip the wings in rather than coat them. I didn't want to coat all my wings and then not like the sauce! The sauce was very sweet and very tangy. I didn't have any lime zest so I used lemon zest instead. I liked it, however, I probably won't make it very often.

Loved these. Nice change from traditional Buffalo Wings. Very sweet and Limey. YUM..   I used the zest of the whole lime. and 2 cloves garlic. then added Lawreys Seasoning Salt and Seasoning Pepper to the Flour along with some Garlic Powder. After I tossed the wings in Flour I let chill in fridge about 2hrs that way they would crisp right up in the HOT oil.  Very Very Good with a ice cold Corona. Pairs very well.

I followed the advice on baking them and it turned out great. My boyfriend didn't talk when I served him these. He finished around 15 wings before he said how good they were and how intrigued he was with the flavors.

These were good. You can definitely tell that they are honey lime flavored. Im more of a hot wing person. So I don't think I would make these again by themselves.  These would be great if you was making wings and then made a platter of a few different flavors like bbq, hot, and honey lime flavored to give people different options. These were definitely tangy. The sauce was very thin but it coated and soaked into the breading nicely.

Wow, these were absolutely perfect for a summer garden party.  I decided to grill the wings (takes about 30-40 minutes on medium heat on a gas grill) and basted them with plain honey while they were grilling.  I then tossed them with the sauce before serving, and people couldn't get enough of these.  I actually think they may be some of the best wings I've ever made.

This honey-lime dressing for the wings is amazing--I used it over some broccoli slaw as well as a side--yummy!  
When I make these next time, I'll stick the wings in the oven for carmelization like has been suggested before.  I just ran out of time before my guests arrived :)

Great recipe. I had split chicken breasts (bone in) and cut them into thirds, baked then for a bit after frying as they were much meatier than wings would be, and then doubled the sauce directions (used a tupperware container to shake the sauce onto the chicken pieces) and it was wonderful. I have to wonder if the previous review where they couldn't taste the lime, skipped the grated lime zest because it really made the dish.

Make sure to cook on a broiler so the bacon fat drips away.  It is a little bland; I kicked it up a notch by adding some tobasco.  Wonderful!

This is a nice addition when we serve hot wings.  The glaze is wonderful and I've even used it when grilling tuna and on kabobs with chicken and shrimp.

These are good, and would be better with a bit more salt in the sauce for flavoring.

I am only rating the sauce.  I grilled chicken wings and put this sauce on afterwards.  Out of a hot sauce, BBQ sauce and this, I had several people say this was their favorite.  I have all kinds of ideas for the leftovers.

Absolutely delicious recipe with no changes needed.  I make it with bone-in pieces, boneless pieces, any part of the chicken.  My entire family loves it.

I wanted to like this, but the chicken ended up dry and the sauce didn't have enough 'umph' for us.    Not a keeper in our house, sorry to say.

It was great I used lemon instead, I added more lemon juice than called for also in the sauce I added a lil hot sauce. I season the chicken with: parsley, lemon, garlic salt, black pepper, Kitchen Bouquet browning& seasoning sauce. I let it marinate. I seared my chicken then put it to the oven.

I baked at 400 for 50 minutes.  Little oil in the bottom of the 9x13 pan.  I accidentally melted 3 TBSP of butter, so I mixed the butter with the hOnly, juice from 1 lime and fresh lime zest.  My husband and very picky sons LOVED them.  Will definately do this recipe again.

Tried it  with glaze on a couple wings. Then added another Tbs. of lime juice and glazed the rest. Definitely better with more lime juice. Also might add more garlic next time. 
Also put glaze in microwave for 10 seconds and stir and microwaved for another 10 seconds. I think the glaze needs the heat to release the flavors from the zest and garlic.

I choose to bake these instead of frying.  After baking them I coated them in the sauce as directed.  I guess some of the flavor the recipe counts on comes from the frying.  I tasted one and thought they needed a little more flavor so I then added some of an all purpose seasoning to the sauce.   I then put them in a pan and poured the remaining sauce mixture on them and baked another 10 minutes.

Trying less frying so I used Chef John's chicken wing baking method from his Crispy Honey Sriracha wings: 2 tablespoons baking powder 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon smoked paprika. and baked the wings on 425 on each side for 20mn. rolled the wings in the Honey Lime sauce and baked and additional 10 min. It was a big hit!

didnt have the fresh lime just bottled juice and no zest so i subbed with lemon pepper and only about a half clove of garlic not a full one .. i also used about 1/4 cup more honey then suggested and a pinch of chili flakes, chilled  then baked for 45 minutes on 400 instead of fried ... at this point almost an entirely different recipe ... but they turned out FANTASTIC and it began from this recipe so BIG THUMBS UP ...

I baked these wings on parchment paper in the oven at 400 degrees on my quick bake setting (convection setting). After they were crispy, we added the sauce and baked a little longer. They were sticky and delicious, however for us it was missing a spicy kick.  I also prefer a lemon flavor over lime citrus flavor on our wings or using simply using a sweet chili sauce over these wings. I did like the sticky part of this sauce that the honey made that I don't usually get with our other recipes that I have tried.

The blend of honey and lime is really dramatic, it's quite lovely.  We just grabbed a quick recipe because it was wing night, but wow - this immediately became the new top choice for wings!  Hurray!

I tried the baked suggestions and these were really not fabulous. The sauce was good, but needed a salty component, like soy sauce.

So good!  Such a different take on the usual buffalo or honey/garlic wing.  Smelled amazing!  First I doubled the sauce, then boiled the wings in the sauce.  Onto the bbq for a final crisp up, just watch closely so the honey doesn't burn.  Will definitely make again!

absolutely wonderful.  Made this for a group of friends and they gobbled them right up.  Wish I had made more.  The only change I made was baking them because I don't have a deep fryer.

OMG!!!  These wings are fantastic!  My family begs for these now so they have become at least a monthly item on our menu.  I usually add a little salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the flour as well.  Thanks for this recipe!

Sorry, but I won't be making this again ... my boyfriend loves lime, but this was overkill ... he actually said they tasted like they were coated with Pine Sol ... industrial strength, at that!  LOL Anyway, sorry, but these were a no-go in our house.

Absolutely wonderful!!  ok, I am not one to cook a lot, but I had some chicken that I needed to cook, but didnt want just regular wings.  I followed the recipe for the most part, although, I couldnt find lime zest at the grocery store, so I actually grated lime peel myself....once I dumped the wings into the bowl of sauce I placed a lid on it and shook it vigorously and there was plenty of sauce...I will definitely use this recipe again!!!

These were awesome wings! I baked them instead of frying and the whole family loved them. Definitely worth trying.

This was too much trouble for the flavor to make. I'm sorry but I tried to even cook in oven but it wasn't worth it. Thanks for the recipe anyway.

Very tasty and messy too. I liked the flavor but would cut back on the lime. I don't fry a lot of foods so my skillet skill with the chicken needs a little work too. I'll probably try this again sometime.
