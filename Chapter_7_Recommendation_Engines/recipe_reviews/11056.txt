I've used this recipe a few times now.  And I love it.  I just want to leave a note about the vanilla.  It seems that when using real vanilla extract 1 teaspoon is plenty and when using imitation vanilla the tablespoon is more appropriate.   Thanks to everyone else who rated this first or I might not have figured out what was wrong.

This recipe is good yet, I made some adjustments to make it better.  Instead of butter I used cream cheese the icing seemed to hold together better and I used almond flavoring in place of vanilla. After my slight adjustments I can then make this icing thick enough for cinnamon rolls or thin enough to 'paint' my christmas cookies. Thanks for the submission.

This was a wonderfully simple icing recipe. Instead of using the full tablespoon of vanilla I used just 1 tsp of almond flavoring and it turned out great, especially when paired with the cream cheese sugar cookies recipe from this site. Add a few drops of different colors, spoon into a ziploc baggie and I was good to go. After about 2-3 hours the icing hardened enough to stack the cookies.

I usually read the reviews first, and boy do I wish I had this time! I was in a hurry, so used 1 TBSP of Pure Vanilla Extract ... Oh My Gosh! I added Cherry Flavoring to try to hide the vanilla taste, as well as more margarine and powder sugar.

Definitely NOT 1 TBSP of Vanilla! It was alright besides the strong, strong vanilla taste. Seems to set o.k. Pretty glaze w/red food coloring.

This recipe was fast and turned out very creamy.  However, it calls for WAY too much vanilla.  Half the amount is a better guess.

Great recipe! I doubled the batch, only used 2 tsps of Vanilla (total) and subbed half-n-half for the milk (it makes the frosting stiffer). also in a double batch, I only used 2 1/4 cups confectioner's sugar. Frosting dried with in an hour, looks great, tastes even better!

The whole tablespoon of vanilla was too much-and without the foodcoloring, it makes brown icing.  I would lessen the vanilla to a tsp., not a whole tablespoon.

Great glaze for anise cut outs.

Note: Please use clear vanilla extract which is available at Michael's, etc. Clear vanilla prevents the brown icing!!

This is an easy and yummy recipe for frosting.  It is a little too heavy on the vanilla, so I cut it back.

I think something is wrong with the measurements on this recipe.   1 TABLESPOON of Vanilla seems like it's too much.  My sister and I tried it and all you can taste is the vanilla (WAY TOO STRONG).

Really good, and dries nicely.  I only used 1 tsp of vanilla as a tablespoon seemed like too much.

Make sure your butter is really softened, if you stick your finger in the butter it should go straight through.  The first time I made it, it was soft but not soft enough and I had to start over because I got lumps in the frosting.  Other then that this is a great recipe for frosting, I only used 1 tsp of vanilla which I thought was plenty.  Iced sugar cookies for valentines day, yummy

it worked GREAT for my cookies. As everybody said, I cut way back on the vanila and still felt it was a little to much... I will try with even less vanila next time. I did the mix and used liquid food coloring, and it worked fine.

Very good. I used more milk to make it more of a glaze that I could just dip the cookies in. Made it very easy! Loved it

This was a wonderful icing recipe.  I doubled everything except the vanilla.  One tablespoon of vanilla to a doubled icing recipe is plenty!  The icing was a wonderful consistency (I did use extra milk) and the icing hardened after a few hours.  Delicious!

MMMM, topped 'soft sugar cookies IV' from this site, so good and sweet.  I don't have a sweet tooth normally, but my husband was craving sugar cookies, so i went for it, glad I did!  This frosting was so good and easy.  I used almond extract instead of vanilla, just personal preference.  Also ended up adding more milk.  I don't bake, but I may add these cookies and icing to my rotation!

Wonderful icing! I used only 1 tsp vanilla and refrigerated the cookies for 1 hour, hardening the icing to perfection. I gave the cookies half an hr to thaw after taking out of the fridge so they were soft when served.

This is the way I have always made my sugar cookie icing, without the measurements! You add more milk to the icing to get the consistency you desire. It's nice to finally have a recipe to follow.

I would have given this a five star if it weren't for needing to adjust a couple of things.  Primarily, definitely one teaspoon is plenty of vanilla extract. I followed the suggestion to substitute butter for cream cheese and I wouldn't make it any other way.  With the substitutions, I would give it five stars.

At the advice of another reviewer I substituted the butter with cream cheese in one batch...boy was it totally different and not in a good way.

The butter makes the "Butter" Icing creamy and so tasty!  At one point I added 1 tablespoon extra of butter and oh my goodness was it soooo creamy and flavorful.  I really like how the little bit of extra butter cuts the taste of confectioners' sugar.  A taste I don't care much for.  I like the sweetness but it has a strange bite I don't like so the butter wipes it out!

The kids in my son's 2nd grade class just loved it for their Heart shaped cookies on Valentine's day!  They couldn't get enough of the red, pink & purple frosting.

Thanks!

Its fast and simple to make which is great. I made a few changes to improve it, so these are the changes I made: 1 tsp of PURE vanilla extract, 4 tablespoons of butter and 2-3 tablespoons of milk. But I still found it too sweet and tasted too much like wet icing sugar. But it worked as a last min icing recipe!

I am going to try to make this icing for some sugar cookies I am going to make on Sunday.... I have attempted to make icing before but it always comes out watery... I am glad it doesn't use (high) fructose corn syrup because lots of icing recipes do.... I'll see how it works out and rate it then (:

This is the standard icing recipe, however add an 8 oz pkg of cream cheese and 1 tsp of almond abstract.  My family will all show up for this treat.

This was great! I did change the vanilla to just 1 tsp.  The frosting hardened so that I could stack cookies but it also stayed soft inside. Yum!

I am reviewing this As Written- no modifications.  The recipe calls for way to much vanilla extract.  One teaspoon to one and a half would be fine.  A whole tablespoon makes the frosting taste like extract.  The consistency/end appearance were great but beware- don't follow the recipe to a T.

Re-analyze the amount of vanilla that is used. I think this should be 1 teaspoon, not tablespoon. And if you should decide to alter this and substitute some of the vanilla for another extract, do NOT use more than 1/4 tsp of another flavor.

This recipe is easy and taste great! I agree you only need a 1 teaspoon of vanilla. It is very creamy and easy to put on cookies. Thanks for the recipe.        DC,Saegertown, Pa

This is a great recipe. I agree with everyone else, I used a teaspoon- NOT a whole tablespoon of pure vanilla extract. I didn't have a problem with the brown icing with just a teaspoon. This makes a great thick frosting (my husband made it this way) but I thinned it out and it also made a terrific glaze. Thanks!

Eliminate the vanilla if you want white icing. If you want to color the icing black, make a chocolate icing by adding 1-T of baking cocoa with the powdered sugar.  This made for a pretty, glossy icing.

I also used cream cheese in place of the butter after reading the other reviews and playing around with the recipe.  It doesn't taste like cream cheese.  And, has a little nicer consistency. I don't like real sweet frosting.  So, used 1/4 c. of flour in place of 1/4 c. of the powd. sugar. After I made this recipe a few times this Christmas, playing with the ingredients, I ended up being pleased wih the real vanilla (with about 1 3/4 tsp. clear van.), almond and then tried the cherry flavoring. All three were huge hits and set up very nicely and shiny within 2-3 hours.  Of course it is winter and the dry heat probably helps. After changes, this is my new cookie frosting recipe. With them, the frosting tastes as good as the not too sweet sugar cookies I put it on.

This is really good. I used 2 tablespoons of butter and about one tablespoon of cream cheese. I also threw in a teaspoon or so of marshmallow fluff. It was smooth and creamy, yet hardened just enough to coat my sugar cookies well. I used it on the Cream Cheese Sugar Cookies on this site.

Perfect.  Delicious and creamy.  I used Wilton's vanilla extract which doesn't turn the icing off-white.  I also only used 1 teaspoon of extract.  Yummy!

Good, easy recipe. I read the reviews that said 1 Tablespoon of vanilla was too much, so I used a teaspoon, which was recommended. I thought this wasn't enough so ended up using 2 teaspoons of vanilla. I did not use clear vanilla, so yes, it turned brownish but after I putthe food coloring in, it didn't matter.

Just for everyone's info out there - You can buy pastuerized egg whites for icing as well! Doesnt have to be powdered whites... Makes for a very shiny cookie icing when cookies are iced hot.

Finally!  I think I've found the perfect icing for sugar cookies.  I've tried at least 10 different kinds over the years.  Some aren't spreadable, others get too hard, others stay too soft.  So far, on day 2, this icing is still perfect.  Yummy and holds together well without getting too hard.  Thanks so much!

I did cut the vanilla in half after reading the other reviews and it worked great.  I also had to add a little extra milk to get the texture just right.  Excellent icing, really good taste.

I listened to what everyone was saying about there being too much vanilla and I cut it back to 1 teaspoon. It was very good then. You do have to be careful when you use this type of icing because it is soft and creamy. Not the most convenient for tons of sugar cookies because of this. I will make it again.

This is a GREAT icing for cookies!  Like everyone said...need to cut down on the vanilla...otherwise it's perfect!
One complaint I used to get with icing was that it had that "shortening" taste..not this one...it just tastes buttery and YUMMY!!!...and SO EASY!!!

This is a great recipe! Easy for kids to work with. If you use an electric mixer the icing turns out white, keep beating until it does. It is very tasty and hardens well also. Going to use this over an over again.

This was very good and very easy. I just added as much milk as I needed for the consistency desired.  Only added 1 tsp vanilla per reviews and no discoloration and no overwhelming taste.

The recipe was pretty good.  I added another tablespoon of milk and several tablespoons of powdered sugar to balance out the recipe.  I used the frosting to make about four colors to decorate the Christmas Tree cookies, also on this site.  They turned out delicious,  melt in your mouth...

excellent for quick setup on cutouts, works well both spread on and with the Wilton decorator pro.  I used half & half instead of milk to make it a bit stiffer and dry quickly but kept all proportions the same. flavorings can be adjusted to suit the taste with any variety of extracts but the main point is that it works so well with cutouts and dries so quickly, allowing you to stack them in between sheets of waxed paper.  Great recipe.

This recipe was perfect. Couldn't believe how it hardened to the cookies and the taste wasn't too sweet. I did it as per the original instructons for 8 servings. It was enough for me to ice my owl cookies and some other christmas cookies

This was very tasty icing. I doubled the batch and used 2 1/4 c powdered sugar and 2 teaspoons vanilla. Crusted nicely after frosted cookies sat out a day uncovered. The cookies were very delicious and this is a wonderful tasting icing. Will definatly make again

I gave this recipe 3 stars because I had to tweak a few things. I followed other reviewers advice and only put in 1 teaspoon of vanilla, but because of that there wasn't enough moisture for the frosting. When I added 1 tbsp of milk, it just turned into a sugar dough ball. So I added more like 3-4 tbsp of milk, and it turned out great. Taste was delicious, just need some more moisture. I would use this recipe again.

Awesome frosting! I usually try to follow the recipe exactly but as much as I love vanilla I did use about 1/2 the amount called for and just a touch extra milk to get the right consistency. Dried perfectly but still soft for the kids sugar cookies! Great recipe!!!

Excellent recipe  I didn't reduce the vanilla but you definitely could.  Also, the vanilla extract turns the icing a slightly brown color so I dyed it green.

This was super easy and my husband loved it, which made it my new go-to icing recipe. I did only put 1tsp of vanilla for the 8 serving size recipe. I also found it was a bit thin and added more confectioners' sugar. Not much, I just added a little at a time until I got the thickness I wanted. Love it though. I'll definitely be making it again!

Very nice frosting!  Tasty, and firms up well enough to transport the next day.  It does begin to dry out a bit while frosting, but to soften it back up you can microwave it for a few seconds, or if in stainless bowls put on a low-heat burner for a few seconds (just be careful when handling).  Will use again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Wish I would have read the reviews first; although I really should have known that 1 tbls. vanilla would be too much.  I had to add a lot more powdered sugar and some butter and more milk to get it to the edible stage.  I made one batch with almond extract, and 1 tbls. was okay in it.  But with pure vanilla extract? way too much!

Easy to make and great consistency. Definately do not need so much vanilla. I only used a teaspoon and it was still too strong. Will try almond extract next time.

I made this frosting, as well as JBS' "Sugar Cookie Icing" so that I'd have the other recipe's hard, shiny glaze, and this one for piping thick, tooth-decaying, sugary wonderful-ness. SOOO good! I changed the ratio of the ingredients ever so slightly (2 c. confec. sugar, 1/3 c. butter, 1 tsp. vanilla) and the end result was a gooey, delicious icing that I am anxious to use on other baked goods.

It was an ok recipe because i think there is somthing wrong with the measurement 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract. Maby you meant to put 1 teaspoon insted. it was better if you frosted the cookies and wauted till the next day to eat them.

Just tried this.  I liked it--you can adjust the consistancy to the kind of decorating you're doing, it's got good flavor (I wonder if the 1 Tablespoon is a misprint; I used 1 teaspoon), and it gets just the right amount of hardness on top so the cookies don't stick together.  I think if you're doing intricate artwork on a cookie, you might want a harder icing, but for just plain GOOD EATIN', this is the best!

Great icing! I used 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract (after reading other reviews). I also used a few drops of milk at a time until the icing reached the consistancy I wanted. This technique will give you greater control of the texture and thickness.  Note: real vanilla may cost a little bit more, but is worth it compared to cheap imitation vanilla!

This is 5 star but only with 1 TEASPOON of vanilla, as many others have said.  Perfect on a soft sugar cookie cutout

this worked, but to me it tasted like liquid sugar. Maybe next time i'll find one with cream cheese in it.

I followed the suggestion of a reviewer on the cream cheese sugar cookie recipe to use this butter icing recipe but replacing the vanilla extract with 1 tsp. of almond extract and then I thinned it out using an additional 2 to 3 T. of milk to get the consistancy I wanted, soooo good on the sugar cookies.

Super easy and fast!  Although, it is a little sweet...maybe I'll add more butter next time (or maybe I'll ask around...cream cheese?).  The consistency was perfect for icing my sugar cookies, though.  I certainly not complaining!

I loved this recipe.  I read the reviews however, and decided to cut the vanilla back to 1 tbsp.  Great recipe.  One little pointer though for others like me who don't have a lot of frosting experience... don't melt your butter in the microwave.  Just let it get to room temperature.

Good recipe but you have to modify it so I gave it less stars. I use heavy cream instead of milk and Disaronno liquor (mild almond flavor and not so dark in color) instead of the vanilla. The flavor is more delicate and allows you be able to taste the butter because why hide a good flavor? Butter tastes good.

Great recipe! It dries firm but not rock-like. The amount of vanilla was perfect flavor-wise, but it made the icing itself tan. It wasn't so dark that it couldn't be covered with food coloring, though.

Perfect! I have to admit..when I first made this recipe I was concerned that the icing wouldn't harden. This actually ended up helping the kids have time to work with their masterpieces (I've had some icings harden before you can really decorate!). This recipe has a great flavor and is perfect with "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookie" recipe!

I agree--not very buttery, more sugary.  I added 1 T lime juice with some lime zest and just a hint of vanilla for a different twist for icing cookies.

Wow~ this is a great recipe for simple and sweet surgar cookies. It's so fast and easy to do and I knew before I read the reviews that just add a few drops of vanilla. Just put enough in it to your liking. Other than that it's the best recipe for cookie icing iv'e ever used!

Extremely yummy! I made these for decorating a batch of Christmas sugar cookies and my friend and I who were decorating couldnt stop eating the icing straight from the icing press! It dries sort of brittle and the colors arent as vivid as say, royal icing ( sort of matte), but the taste makes up for it!

Perfect icing with "Grandma Minnie's Old Fashioned Sugar Cookies."  I have learned my lesson, and always read the reviews first -- took others advice and only used 1 tsp. vanilla extract. (Any more would have been WAY too much.)  Quick, simple and easy to spread.  THANKS!

Nice recipe.  As others have noted a full tablespoon of vanilla is a lot. I added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of almond extracts and it was delicious. This icing won’t completely harden, which I think is better for eating and enjoying...but if you need it to harden look for different recipe. Happy holidays!

This icing is exactly what you want for Xmas cookies!  It is tasty and spreads well on cookies as well as being ‘brushed’ on cookies for texture.

It tasted great! I used it for sugar cookies and it was perfect, also a great recipe to use if you want a easy one.

This is my go-to for decorated sugar cookies. Hardens nicely but doesn't get rock hard. Plus it tastes great.

Excellent semi-sweet icing. I put the icing on sugar cookies and let them sit overnight in the fridge to get the icing to harden up just a bit. No complaints! Will repeat next year for xmas cookies!

I followed the recipe exactly as written except I used 1 t. vanilla extract. I added a bit more milk for  a thinner consistency.  I like the taste, the way it spread and the food coloring (liquid) worked great!

delicious butter frosting! Tried it on my Christmas cookies instead of royal icing and it was a HUGE hit. This is now my go-to frosting its the perfect thickness for piping or spreading.

Very good recipe for icing! I wanted something with butter instead of shortening. I used almond extract instead of vanilla and It turned out yummy! I originally piped the icing on with ease, but decided I liked It better smeared. More rustic looking. It piped really nicely just FYI. Also I doubled this because It only frosted maybe 18 cookies and I make way more. Thanks for the recipe!

I used cream cheese instead of butter. Still tastes like buttercream. I used pure vanilla extract (made tan icing). I don't really taste vanilla as others claim. Taste mostly the powdered sugar. Came out pretty runny but may be because of the cream cheese.

I was looking for a sugar cookie frosting that wouldn't be so glaze-y, and this was the winner. I use a teaspoon of vanilla like other reviewers said to do. I don't think the color of the vanilla ruined my white very much, but I'm not too picky.
I used soy milk because it's all I had on hand, and it still turned out great. 
I added a little extra milk to make it workable for piping.

Next time, I'll probably double the recipe as this wouldn't have been enough to frost a full batch of cookies.

Super easy with a really nice consistency. I did a couple batches ... used butter with one and cream cheese with the second. I couldn't really tell the difference between the two, but the cream cheese version seemed a little smoother and it had the subtle cream cheese flavor that I love. Obviously, use only 1 tsp vanilla. Makes a pretty small batch, so at least double if you're icing cookies.

One of the best icing I've ever made for cookies. It tasted great. Other recipes for icing use lemon juice and this one doesn't (which is a good thing.) so it doesn't taste sour or zesty.

Everything about this recipe is perfect, except the vanilla is WAY too much. I should have trusted my instincts on this, but I followed the recipe. Now have 60+ cookies with frosting that's overpowering on the vanilla. Oh well. Next time I'll know better. Should've read the reviews first. Can't believe the recipe hasn't been edited yet. :P

This is very tasty and easy to make. I ran out of regular butter so I ended up using salt-free and took the advice of others to lessen the vanilla to a tsp. It has great consistency and the kids were easily able to spread it on our cookies.

I use this icing to ice a no roll sugar cookie recipe I found on this site. My boyfriend absolutely loves the combo. He is always asking me to make the cookies with this icing. I always leave out the red food coloring and the decorating sugar. I only add enough milk to reach the desired consistency.

It was very good and dried perfectly. I should have added less vanilla when I doubled the recipe, for it was quite strong. I might try adding other flavours next time!

Pretty good recipe. Like others I reduced the vanilla to 1 tsp since I was using the good stuff. to make the finished product less runny I also reduced the milk to 1/2 Tbsp which suited my needs perfectly.

This was exactly what I was looking for - a sugar cookie frosting without shortening.  Perfect texture to spread on my cookies and it hardened to  a slight shell so I could stack my cookies but was still creamy. I substituted almond milk (due to allergies) and followed one of the reviews and used 1 tsp vanilla since I used the real thing and not imitation.  Already planning to use this again soon!

Agree with many of the other reviews about the amount of vanilla...too much and too strong. Next time I will use less, and use clear vanilla, so the colors are more vibrant. It is smart to check the reviews ahead of jumping in...lesson learned.

Excellent recipe.  I used it as-is and it was perfect.  (I used regular strength vanilla extract and it was good.) Icing was easy to spread and hardened nicely.  Very pleased!

Pretty good - definitely used 1 teaspoon of vanilla. I assume it was a typo. Added an extra dash of milk. Really smooth and good amount of sweetness without overpowering the cookie. Took a lot more that 3 drops of food coloring to get red; I ended up using about 25 and it still was pinkish.

My little ones and I made this recipe and I have to say...wish I would have read the reviews.  Way, way, way too much Vanilla.  The consistency was way too wet and the vanilla was overpowering.  I bet with half the vanilla it would work.  Maybe I'll try again another time.

With 1tsp of vanilla, this icing was delicious. I added an additional tbsp of milk, which made an icing ideal for finer piping work.

This will not harden! Otherwise, the recipe is great! I used water instead of milk (since I didn't have any) and it was still fine, nice and smooth with an electric mixer :)

My daughters and I were making Halloween cookies, and just when we were about to decorate them, we found that we were out of frosting. I looked online, and found this recepie, and we all agreed that it was better than regular frosting! We made tons of cookies decorated with this delicious frosting, and we know they'll be a big hit when they take them to school tomorrow!

Great recipe! I didn't have enough powdered sugar (I was short by about 1/2 c.), so I added corn starch to thicken it, and it worked great! I'm so happy I found this recipe...the store bought frostings all have trans-fat in them, but this one I made with Smart Balance Butter Blend, which has no trans fats! It's definitely a keeper :)

Used this on heart shaped sugar cookies.  I did use only a teaspoon of the vanilla.  I did not experience any trouble coloring the icing.....made light pink.  I did have to add a couple more tablespoons of milk to get it to the consistency I wanted.  It is very sweet, but isn't it supposed to be????

Most of the other icing recipes I saw called for eggs and light corn syrup. I liked that this one didn't need either. However, I think this recipe may have called for too much sugar. When I made it, the texture just wasn't right, and I couldn't taste anything but the sugar. The other measurements seemed right and I think I'll try with less sugar. Thanks

Delicious!  I used the full amount of high quality vanilla and everyone seemed to like it.  I didn't like the brown color however.  It made it tough to get the colors I wanted with my food coloring.  I may use clear vanilla next time.

I made this frosting with butter and I only used 1 tsp vanilla. It was way to thick so I thinned it out with a little more milk. My kids loved it. This reminded me of the frosting my mom used to make when I was growing up.

1 tsp instead of 1 Tablespoon of vanilla is the answer!  With the switch the recipe is a success.

this recipe was great except we changed the amount of the vanilla.  That's way to much vanilla.  We also changed the recipe to one of the viewers, changed out the butter to cream cheese and vanilla to almond extract.  We used only 1 teaspoon of almond extract and tripled the recipe.  One teaspoon was perfect for all of that.  Thanks.

Good and easy.  I used 1 tsp. of vanilla instead (like others had suggested).  I used just a little milk to make the frosting thicker because I used this for sandwich cookies.

Really good frosting recipe, and it works well with sugar cookies as it doesn't end up becoming too hard, but hardens just enough so that your cookies aren't all stuck together with frosting either. I tripled the recipe due to the amount of cookies I made (as it doesn't make a whole lot as is), and used clear vanilla instead of regular vanilla. I also used gel food colorings to color my icing instead of liquid food coloring, though I suspect you would be able to thin it out very slightly (if you so desired) by using liquid food color. Overall, a really good sugar cookie icing!

This frosting was easy and taste good.  I read the reviews about pure  vanilal and used 1 tsp and 1/2 tsp of lemon extract.  This frosting was more than enough for two dozen cookies.

This is a great recipe for icing. Of course, the poster should have listed that they were using IMITATION vanilla. If you use the real thing, like me, dont use so much. Also, I like to make a batch with a little vanilla and a little lemon. Lemon extract on sugar cookies is the best! Thanks for this recipe - easy, fast, good.

This recipe was great.  It tastes just like my Mom used to make!  I didn't use food coloring, so I used only 1 1/2 tsp. of vanilla to make sure it didn't get too brown.  It was excellent--perfect consistency, not too soft or too hard!  Thank you!

I made this with the Best Rolled Sugar Cookies, and it worked perfectly.  Next time I will make two batches, since I ran out toward the end. I used a little less vanilla, and the flavor was perfect.  It also took coloring really well.  Overall, a great frosting! Thanks!

Great Recipe!! I place them on one of my sugar cookie recipes and the family ate them all up. Defenitly way too much vanilla, I used a teaspoon which i think was the perferred measurement. perhaps a typo...

thanks

Made this as directed except I substituted 2t almond extract for the 1T vanilla and it had great flavor.  Plus, the frosting hardened just enough to stack the cookies safely, but didn't become rock hard.  Great recipe - thanks!

I modified this icing a bit when I read other reviews saying there was too much vanilla. I but a teaspoon in, but that still was way too much. I would try another recipe.

great basic recipe!  I have used it for decorating several different cutout cookies, and it always comes out great.  Sets up nicely, too.  Would probably work for cake decorating.

Wonderful.

If you don't colour it and don't want to make it so dark with the vanilla extract, use clear imitation vanilla extract.

I tried the lemon zest that was suggested by another user and it was really good on vanilla cookies. Just grated a lemon skin, added a little at a time until it tasted right.
