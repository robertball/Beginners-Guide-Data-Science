I'm impressed. Who knew such simple ingredients would make such a delightful treat. This recipe used fat-free ingredients but I used full fat half&half because I had some I needed to use up and fudge-covered grahams, in which I doubled the amount called for in the recipe. I also used vanilla extract this time but I intend to get vanilla bean paste for this the next time. I can only imagine how delicious this must be with real vanilla bean in it. I left my ice cream in the freezer overnight and it did harden up quite a bit but was still creamy to the taste. The graham crackers were a very nice touch. I can see so many possibilities for add-ins with this ice cream. Thanks for the quick and easy recipe!

My family raved over this!  I followed the recipe but added 2 other things.  When I scooped this into the freezer container I layered the crushed graham crackers along with chocolate syrup and marshmellows for a S'mores taste.  It's yummy!  I make again and used fat free half & half and it was just as good!

Gorgeous ice cream, loved both the taste and texture.  I followed the recipe exactly, the only negative for me was that the ice cream just did not firm up in the ice cream maker.  A few hours in the freezer soon solved the problem.  Thank you for sharing...

This was completely amazing. I used 1.5 cups whole milk and .5 cups cream. I also substituted .5 tsp almond extract for the vanilla bean. Will DEFINITELY be making again.

Awesome! I've made other varieties of ice cream, but it usually is either too hard or flaky. Good stuff. I don't have an ice cream maker, I always just pop my homemade ice cream in the freezer and stir every hour or so. Thanks for this!

Made this for my fiance, and he loved it. The ice cream was so simple to make and was very good. The texture is what makes the ice cream so interesting. Would definitely recommend you try this for a fun and different treat.

Good recipe, rather light tasting compared to custard based ice creams. It is easy to whip up. I opted to cook my mixture in a saucepan on the stove to ensure the sugar granuales would melt and blend. I served with graham crackers, Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bars and chocolate syrup on the side.

This was sssooooooo good!!! I LOVED IT. I didnt have half and half so i just used a cup of milk and a cup of heavy creamy, i think it was better than using half and half. I will definetely make this again, and again!

Delicious!  I had left over graham cracker crumbs from a crust I had made, exactly 3 oz.  Using the crumbs worked perfectly.

This is amazing...I had my doubts based on the amount of ingredients, and I wasn't sure finding vanilla beans would be easy.  Well, vanilla beans are in any grocery store and the taste was fabulous.  Will definitely make again!!

I put in too much vanilla extract but otherwise am pretty excited about how this turned out, will plan to experiment with other things besides the graham crackers.  I did not use an ice cream maker, just put it in the freezer and gave it a stir every so often.

Tastes slightly similar to Jeni's Cream Puff ice cream. Subtle and delicious. I also used 1.5 cups whole milk and .5 cups cream.  sprinkle with crushed salt flakes when serving (I like it softer / when fresh) to give it more nuance but was AWESOME as is. Used vanilla paste since I didn't have a bean.
