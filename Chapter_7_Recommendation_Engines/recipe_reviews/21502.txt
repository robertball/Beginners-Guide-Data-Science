This recipe is a great way to get more tofu in your diet! I used silken, or Japanese style, tofu so I froze the tofu, then thawed it and (gently) squeezed out the excess water before I dredged it in the flour. This gives the tofu a chewier, more meat-like texture and keeps it from turning into mush when you cook it. I didn't have any trouble getting the flour to stick.

Really delicious!  Maybe a bit tricky if you're new to tofu - definitely PRESS it first (half hour or more under a weighted plate) and it'll be fine.  I didn't think my sauce was going to be thick eough but it thickened beautifully when I added the honey-mustard; also worried about the tofu breaking up but it held up fine.  Even my toddler ate hers all up in a rice bowl!  I used just one bouillon cube and loved the flavor.

Tasted great!  A few suggestions that I found helpful.  1-use fresh tofu if you can find it (a chinese grocery may have it. It tastes MUCH better).  2-press or freeze the tofu to take out some of the water.

I didn't have much trouble getting the flour to stick..just threw the tofu and flour in a tupperware dish and shook it around a little.

Served it with noodles...yum.  I liked it a lot!

You have no idea how good this is.  My children love it.  It is labor intensive, but the results are excellent.

I have made it with and without the wine.  I used more water when I didn't use the wine, and I couldn't really tell the taste difference.

This was a great recipe. I pressed the tofu for two hours prior to cutting it up. I would have frozen it first if I had time as that makes for a meatier texture. I cut the tofu into small chunks for easier browning. I also used canola oil instead of butter to lower the fat. I took the tofu out after it browned to drain and made the sauce in the same pan. I did thicken the sauce with a cornstarch and water mixture because mine seemed to thin. I added the tofu back in at the end to heat through. I served mine over brown rice with chopped green onions on the top for garnish. Was very tasty. Thank you.

I love honey mustard, but this recipe was AWFUL! I followed the suggestions of other reviews and coated my tofu in egg and made the sauce seperately. Whew, am I glad that I did! I ended up not using the sauce because it was inedible and I made a completely different sauce.

I thought this recipe was fantastic. I followed the advice of other reviews by cooking the sauce separately. To jazz it up a bit I added fresh chopped rosemary and thyme to the flour to give it an herb crust and cut the tofu into large tofu "steaks" rather than cubes. I lightly drizzled the sauce over the entire plate and then laid the tofu over pan seared garlic asparagus (another recipe that I got from this site!). I then drizzled a bit more sauce on top of the tofu. Enjoy!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I prepared the sauce separately, as others suggested.  I pressed the tofu and dipped them in beaten egg to ensure the flour stuck, and used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter spray in place of frying them in butter, as I usually do to cut some calories.  I added the sauce at the end, and the tofu was crisp and brown and delicious, and served it with rice.  Nothing fancy, just a satisfying meal.

This was one of the first tofu recipies I tried.  I loved Honey Mustard Chicken but then became a vegetarian, so I couldn't have it.  I was grateful to find this recipe and share it with a few friends who were willing to try tofu.  I usually adjust the measurements for the sauce so I have extra to go over mashed potatoes.

This is a great tofu main dish.  I recommend sauteeing the tofu alone before adding the sauce to give it a crispy texture. I served with dinner rolls and the grilled asparagus also found on this site.  This one is worth a try.

I took the advice of previous reviews, and made the sauce separate from the tofu.  I also cut the tofu into smaller pieces.  I added a couple of sauteed red peppers, and served it over some green veggies and rice.  The flavors are really wonderful.

Pressed tofu for 2 hours prior to chopping (would recommend freezing, too, as others suggested). Made sauce separate from fried tofu; made for easier prep. Added fresh ground pepper, and dried crushed rosemary and thyme to flour before shaking over tofu (used lidded container). Will use some sea salt in flour mixture next time. Only used half flour called for and still had too much leftover. Used 1/2 amount white wine vinegar for white wine. If you like honey mustard, you'll enjoy this recipe.

This was great! Even my meat+potatoes lovin' husband liked it! I followed the suggestions of others: 1. remove excess water from tofu by placing it under a weighted plate for at least 2 hrs 2. dip tofu slices in Egg Beaters before dredging in flour 3. cook tofu first, remove from pan, and then make sauce 4. throw in sliced red bell pepper while reducing the sauce I served ours over egg noodles!  Yummy!  I will definitely make this again!

Very yummy! I followed the advice of other reviewers and fried the tofu first, removed it and then made the sauce. Added the tofu back in when sauce was done. Also added a bit more flour to thicken, maybe a teaspoon. Saw a picture with finely chopped green onion on top and added that too to garnish. I will definitely make it again.

This is really good and super easy once you get the hang of it. Freeze the tofu for better texture and to keep it from falling apart.

The tofu was very hard to work with and kept breaking up on me.  The sauce tasted good, but after a serving, me and my family were getting nauseous.

I really liked this recipe.  It was very tasty, with a tangy honey mustard kick.  I also had trouble getting the breading to stick, so if anyone has any suggestions please let me know.

I wasn't a fan of the flavor--it wasn't very honey mustardy.  Also, making the sauce with the tofu led to the tofu absorbing a lot of water and took forever to reduce.  Eventually I gave up and used corn starch.

This was delicious!  I chopped up a sweet onion and stirfryed it with the butter first.  Also I just used plain white flour since that's what I had on hand, and I only used about 1 cup of it.  I served it over noodles and it was soooo yummy!  Even my meat loving hubby devoured it.

This was only my second attempt cooking with tofu and I was very pleased -- the advice about draining and freezing really helped.  I served over raw, julienned zucchini seasoned with a little olive oil, salt & pepper.  Good combination

After reading some of the reviews I was a bit leary to try this recipe. I took the advice of taking the tofu out of the pan after frying. I had now white wine so I just put a few splashes of vinegar. I too used a bit of cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I loved it and will cook it again.

This was my first tofu recipe for my new vegeatarian daughters - it was awesome.  Thanks to the extra comments - I did not add the sauce to the tofu, but drizzled it over the crispy tofu and rice.  It's a keeper!

This looked like a great recipe but turned out AWFUL. My husband remarked that of all the hundreds of new dishes I've tried, this is the  first one that was completely inedible. I don't know what went wrong. The tofu cutlets browned up nicely, but as soon as I poured in the liquid mixture the crispy coating came off. The taste and texture were horrendous. I wish I knew what had happened!

Not too bad...I'm not one for honey mustard but had a lot in my fridge for some reason.  I did press the slices to remove some of the moisture.  I also pressed the tofu in the wheat flour to really make it stick. ( I really didn't need the whole 2 c. of flour, maybe 1 1/2 or less)  Almost had a peanut flavor to it.  Nice surprise dish. Thanks!

The flour didn't stick very well to the tofu and without veggies it felt like it was missing something.  In the future I think I'll cook the sauce separately.  For the first batch I followed the instructions but replaced butter with Earth Balance as we avoid dairy.

It's mild, but not in a bad way. I pressed the tofu , dipped it in a lightly whipped egg, and then into flour before cooking. I added a splash more of wine than called for (because Sauvignon Blanc makes the world go round!), and about 1/2 tsp. paprika. I think next time I might fool around with it and see how it tastes with a little grated ginger root and cilantro. The hardest part was trying to convince non-tofu-aficionados to give it a try.

This tofu rocks! I have made it like three times this month, srsly. I usually have to add a teaspoon or so of flour to thicken the sauce, but that's no big deal. Also, for those who have difficulty with tofu that falls apart in the sauce: try rolling the tofu in egg, then the wheat flour, then frying them in about an inch of olive or peanut oil. Healthy? Not particularly. Sure to get you crispy, delicious tofu cubes that will weather being drowned in sauce? Definitely.

I bought firm tofu and just drained the water out.  No extra steps freezing or pressing it.  The outside came out crunchy and the inside was melt in your mouth soft.  Next time I will try to buy a honey mustard and add honey as I ended up using almost a half cup of honey to get the flavor just right.

I didn't really enjoy this. I cooked the sauce seperately and it ended up cooking down to just about nothing. I didn't have enough to cover all of my tofu. I wasn't really sure about the bouillin mixed with the honey mustard either... I tried tofu slices and tofu cubes. They were ok. I did not have any problems with the breading staying on. But they were not crispy at all, maybe too much butter. Next time I fry tofu I will use oil instead of butter. And I will use a different sauce. My husband ate his entire plate, but I think he was just being polite.

The sauce and the tofu needed to be cooked seperately, as suggested before. The sauce a little overwhelmingly sweet and was not suited to my taste, but my husband enjoyed it.

Good, I liked it but I have had better tofu. Maybe honey mustard just isn't my thing. I had to add more wine because it seemed a bit sweet to me. Gets a four because it was not a bad dish for being so easy!

This is so great!  I altered the recipe according to my diet & it came out perfect!  (1) I used 1/4 cup Splenda instead of honey. (2) No flour or butter. I used 2 TSP olive oil & the tofu fried up nicely, but not crisp. (3) I used the only cooking wine I had in the house .. red. -- Everythign came out so awesome!  This is going to be a repeat indeed!

very easy and tasty! you definitely don't need two cups of flour to coat the tofu, just one is enough. I have it with rice and sometimes add peas and carrots.

I liked this recipe -- I used prepared store-bought vegetable broth instead of the white wine, water, and bouillon. Also used 3 tbsp of course grain mustard, 1 tbsp regular yellow mustard. I also used some flour to thicken up the sauce. Sauce is good over quinoa and vegetables as well.  I would make this again.

I was very skeptical about this meal.  I substituted Agava for Honey, used egg instead of flour, used extra firm tofu and drained for 30 min.,  didn't have quite the right size of size frying pan, (and 1 lb of tofu barely fit into what I was using).   The tofu stayed firm and not one slice broke or crumbled.  Surprisingly, it was delicious!!  Will definitely make it again soon!

I've made this a few times, but never with the bullion cubes.  I usually sub out the water for either vegetable or chicken stock.  Also, try adding in some diced zuccini while sauteeing in the sauce, for some added texture.  I like using the on a bed of white rice, for a more complete meal.

Meh. Sauce flavor with given directions wasn't impressive. I added extra honey and about half teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Much better!  Definitely drain the tofu as previous reviewers suggested.   I also coated the tofu in egg white and then shook with flour in a ziploc. Worked wonderfully.

I normally love honey mustard, but this was not good. My friend agreed. The mustard flavor was overwhelming. After tasting it in the pan, we decided to pour the whole thing through a strainer to wash all the sauce off. We were at least able to save the tofu cubes and re-heat them with garlic to have with our rice. We used spicy brown since the recipe doesn't specify the type of mustard; I don't know if that made a difference.

The tofu was great, but the sauce tasted like french's mustard. I will make again but will add tons of veggies and drastically alter the sauce (maybe even just by using a dijon)?

We're just learning to use tofu and this was great! The 2 year old went after the tofu like crazy (I cooked it separate, and he kept climbing on things to steal it off the plate it was on) and he just lit up at the sauce! Thanks so much!

It depends on what kind of mustard you use. Add the honey and mustard to taste depending on how sweet you want it!  This was the first time I had ever cooked with tofu! I happened to have medium-firm tofu in the fridge and it was a little difficult to cook with as the more it moved the more it fell apart, but the end result was delicious! I also only used 1/2 pound of tofu and a breast of chicken to spice it up since I'm not a vegetarian and had some leftover chicken in the fridge. I would like to know though, in the picture there looks to be green onions in it?

This would be great with some modifications. I think the tofu should be browned without dredging, and then taken out of the pan. Make the sauce, and then put the tofu back in. The addition of cauliflower would be more authentic.

I have never been more proud of myself as when I served this last night.My 2 and 6 year old stuffed themselves and they NEVER do that. I did the 1 tbs spoon of corn starch while sauce was simmering and added a bell pepper that really brought out the color. THANKS

I followed the other reviews and made the sauce separate from the tofu. I used 1 cup of vegetable broth instead of water and vegetable bouillon cubes. This may have been the reason why the sauce didn't thicken like it should have. Although the sauce had a great taste, it was still too liquidy in the end. Will definitely make another attempt at this.

Both my husband and I had problems with this recipe. I took the suggestions and cooked the tofu separately from the sauce so it stayed crispy. Although I would use less flour in the future I enjoyed the tofu very much. However, the sauce had such a strange, unusual taste I could not get used to it. However, my husband loved the sauce but did not like the way the tofu was cooked. Either way we will not make this again.

Good easy recipe.  I only got a tiny piece and my husband ate the rest.  I made it exactly as directed.  The tofu stuck to the pan a little while it was browning, but then released faily easily when I added the liquid.

I really liked this. Maybe next time I will add a bit less mustard but I really did like it. Normally with meals that are full of flavour, I tire of them before even finishing what is infront of me but I kept eating this.

I found these tasted great hot. I would rather brown the tofu right before serving. Tastes great crisp. I did not have veg. boullions and so I added 1/2 cup of frozen mixed vegetables and some curry powder :). The sauce turned out good too. Thanks for telling a wonderful way of eating tofu.

We made this last night and the sauce is so light and tasty! I was worried it would be overpowering but I was really surprised. We used a half chicken/half tofu since our 2yo is a picky eater. It turned out great that way and I would recommend this recipe to anyone.

This was good even though the tofu didn't turn out crispy for me.  Next time I'll try the sauce separately or use larger 'steaks' instead of cubes like others recommended.  I let it cool to lukewarm and put it over a simple salad and it was tasty.

My husband thought this was wonderful. I on the other hand, wasn't very impressed. But in all fairness, I am still trying to get used to the tofu taste as a whole. I will make it again for him.
