I've been making a recipe like this for many years, and it always turns out perfect.  But here are a few tips from my experiences...I do not use margarine, I use only real butter--the flavor is much better.  And they must be baked until they are a deep golden brown in order to not be sticky and to have that nice crunch--I've found that's about 20 minutes for my oven.  10 minutes has never been long enough for mine.  The topping needs to be poured as evenly as possible across the crackers (I usually pour thin streams back and forth in all directions)...it will then settle nicely into an even layer when it bakes.  They are delicious, and they are always a hit when I make them.  I have used only graham crackers for mine, so I can't rate the club crackers.

When I make this recipe I sprinkle chocolate chips on them as soon as I take them out of the oven. Excellent!

Very quick and tasty.  Satisfied my late night sweet tooth without too much delay.  I sprayed a cookie sheet with non stick coating instead of using the foil, and it worked quite well.

I didn't try this one yet.  SOUNDS good, but how many graham crackers do I need to use, in how many layers, and how big of a cookie sheet??  I have several really different sizes ranging from 1/4 to 1/2 sheet, so its hard for me to tell what size cookie sheet you are referencing and how many graham crackers are needed relative to the other recipe amounts given.

Quick, easy, tasty.  The very similar Betty Crocker version (identical ingredients and proportions) calls for 24 graham crackers.  Note to self: Bake longer than 10 mins next time as they were still sticky.

Really, Really good!  However a note...used all butter and made two separate batches (did Not cook at the same time), one in a glass pan and one in a metal one.  Per other reviewer suggestions, increased the cooking time to 18 minutes.  The glass pan was fabulous, the metal pan burned to a crisp!  I didn't know glass vs. metal would cook differently, but a good lesson!  Also, substituted walnuts for the pecans (1/2 the price) and nobody knew the difference!  They were the only dessert to disappear.

these are very very sweet, so be careful if thats not what you are looking for.  i had a little trouble getting these to "thin out" like i wanted them to. a lady at our church made them, and the topping was thinner, maybe a different recipe?  they were very good, but wish i knew how to change them as i have noted.  very easy to make!!!

We really liked these.  They are easy and fast.  I used cinnamon grahams.  They really gave it extra flavor.  Will definitely make again when I am looking for something quick.

These are sooooo yummy and addictive.  I stumbled onto them when I was going to a book group potluck with a New Orleans theme, so I was hunting for something 'praline.'  Loved these.  Definitely use only butter.  I've only used Club crackers and wouldn't change to anything else.  The salty/sweet balance is so good.  I'm taking them to a hospital/nurse thank you tomorrow and know they'll get raves.  Thanks for such a yummy recipe.

I've been making these for years and it's the first thing my Dad requests during the holidays. He always takes half of the batch and hides it in a secret place so no one else can get to "his share"!

I've made this using Ginger Snaps instead of Graham Crackers and it really added a unique flavor - I loved them. Also, for added flavor I added Butterscotch ice cream topping after the recipe cooled - tasty. However with the ice cream topping, the cookies need to be refrigerated. Tip: before cooking, place parchment paper on the pan for easy removal.

I gave this 4 out of 5 stars. I think mine had a good flavor (i used butter and no margarine) and as suggested I left them in for 20 minutes and some of them got a bit overdone.  They are very quick and easy to make. Next time I'm going to be sure only leave them in for 10 minutes like the recipe says.

These weren't bad, I used about a sleeve and a half of graham crackes, honey and cinnamon ones, both were good.  However my topping seemed a bit brittle, still tasted good though.  I'll have to experiement.  I did use all butter as I don't normally have margarine on hand.

PUT THESE IN THE FREEZER!  Otherwise, I thought they just tasted like a sugary graham cracker.  For some reason, the toffee flavor is much better if you eat them frozen.

What a great little sweet treat. And just in time for the holidays too! I can best describe these as a cookie/candy. These really addictive though, it's hard to only eat one piece. The pecans were hard to get evenly spread out, as it cools quickly. This took 2 inner packs of grahams to make a large cookie sheet full. I only had 1.5 so I used saltines to finish the last little bit, but don't do that. They weren't near as good and too thin a cracker. I bet using chocolate grahams would be a nice change up too. These needed to bake 20 min though or they won't be crisp and breakable when cool. These were a huge hit with my husband. Thanks for sharing this, they're great.

I love pralines and have always wanted to try making them, but was reluctant because it looked complicated. (I am no good with a candy thermometer.) I tried this recipe because it looked easy, and it sure was! They came out so tasty. I used cinnamon graham crackers, which was nice. I think I found a foolproof praline recipe in this. Thank you!

Excellent and easy. Used 1 c. butter, sprinkled pecans over graham crackers, then poured the butter/sugar mixture over the nuts. Baked about 12 min. Perfect!

This recipe was easy and tasty and enjoyed at the potluck I took it to. I used only butter + added more pecans just because I had them. Would have been delicious even with fewer nuts. Mine, like others, was soft when it came out of the oven, but hardened up to a nice chewiness. Perfect to make when you need a dessert, but don't want to spend a lot of time baking + the ingredients are easy to keep on hand.

I made these with Club crackers and also baked them about 18-20 minutes.  They were a big hit with my family - everyone loved them! I will definately add this recipe to my collection.

I've been trying to find this recipe for years!  The graham cracker "crust" really makes it on this one.  Delicious and easy!

I thought I followed the recipe exactly, but perhaps I did something wrong because mine turned out really limp.  I tried putting them in the fridge to see if they would firm up a bit, but that didn't really help too much.  Sounded good, but didn't materialize well for me.

These were easy and tasted okay.  I'm not sure they were a huge hit at my house so I probably will not make them again.

Maybe I did something wrong, but this was very greasy for me.  I used Club crackers. It didn't taste bad ... just very obviously melted butter with sugar.

Very innovative and very good.  I liked them.  I should have taken them out of the pan right when I took them out of the oven though, as I forgot about them and had to peel them off of the foil.  Next time, I will put them on waxed paper right away.
