This was dangerously easy, and very good.  I added 2 TBSP of cocoa powder to the recipe and microwaved for 3:15.  I was expecting the wobbly goodness of an American pudding- but was surprised with a yummy cake (I forgot about the English to American translation in my haste for a late night chocolate fix)!

I'll be making this again and again!  Thanks for a great recipe!

A simple and quick recipe, but very delicious. A light and spongy texture enjoyed with custard. Highly recommended if you have a spare 15 mins and fancy something sweet and tasty.

Do NOT expect a pudding with this recipe, but more of a dense pound cake (having attended culinary school in England, I know that "pudding" is just a general term for dessert in Britain).  That said, I was still hoping for something in between a pudding and cake or at least extremely moist given the instructions to cook till the top was "jiggly." Not so--this is 100% cake.  Cooking time is way off.  You only need to microwave it for 1.5-2 minutes; if you did 3.5 minutes you would end up with a dry and tough textured cake.  On its own, this is a rather bland and unfulfilling cake.  To redeem it, I topped it with freshly sliced strawberries and some cream, and that was very tasty.  If you need an instant and dense cake (do not expect anything light or fluffy) to serve as a base for some type of dessert sauce/custard/fruit, this will do the job, but otherwise I can't recommend this recipe.

I used this receipe to make small fairy cakes.  I made 8, but microwaved them 4 at a time incase the first batch didn't work out.  I put the cake cases on a pyrex dish and cooked in full power for a minute and a quarter.  The cakes came out really well, although they were rather oddly shaped as they weren't done in a cake tin.  I iced them with glace icing so they were fantastically quick to make for my children.

Pretty good for a really quick dessert. I didn't have self-rising flour, so I made some by adding 3/4 tsp baking powder and 1/4 tsp salt to a 1/2 cup all-purpose flour. I also added a small splash of vanilla and about a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. I dividing the batter among 4 ramekins to make individual servings and microwaved them for 1:45.   I thought the cake turned out light and fluffy, but my husband thought it was a bit dry. Topping it with some homemade strawberry jam and a dollop of whipped cream was nice.

I have made this a number of times and it's always turned out light and fluffy and tastes delicious. I also add a cup of boiled water mixed with 1Tbsp of brown sugar + 2Tbsp of honey or golden syrup and pour over top before microwaving. This makes the perfect self saucing pudding.

Quick and easy to make. The quantities struck me as a bit on the small side - I doubled it for my family of four and it was just right. Maybe we're just greedy...

This is short one star only because I didn't know what to expect.  I never tried Yorkshire Pudding before.  I didn't have self-rising flour, so I substituted with flour and added 3/4 tsp baking powder.  I didn't know how to work the power level on my microwave, so let it cook for 4 minutes instead of 3-1/2.  I think I overdid it because the end result was a sponge cake.  So, not a pudding like I expected but still a GREAT QUICK recipe for sweet comfort dessert.  The recipe could use more vanilla.  I will make it again.  I loved that it wasn't too sweet and could be dolled up nicely with jam, syrup, or berries (baked in or on the side.)

Wow, I saw this and said to myself "there is no way that works." Well, I'm actually totally shocked that it does. My microwave is very strong, so I cooked it at 2:15. Melted a Hershey bar & bam, quickest sweet tooth fix ever! The actual cake w/o the chocolate is pretty dry & unimpressive.

I am looking for microwave recipes so I gave this a try. It was good but a little dry so I only gave it 4 stars. I will try again in the future and lower the cooking time to see if that halps.

This came out dry and crumbly.  It's a good start, but I'm not quite sure what to do to make it moist.   I put corn syrup on the bottom and even a little on the top (after poking a few holes).

Fantastic idea! Found this recipe when wondering what to do with extra butter-sugar glaze that I had made for another recipe I found here, Lemon Fiesta Cake (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/lemon-fiesta-cake/), so this had a tinge of lemon flavour as well -- brilliant! Didn't change anything else in this recipe (other than the spritz of lemon juice added to the butter-sugar mixture for the glaze I made), and it cooked to perfection in 3 1/2 minutes exactly. This recipe is so versatile that I'm definitely going to try this again with perhaps cocoa powder and some more sugar, maybe some roasted walnuts or pecans thrown in as well. Served with a dollop of ice cream to add some moistness, this would make a ridiculously easy yet wonderful dessert. Thank you!

Just tried this! Not too shabby, but I do have a couple of suggestions:
I doubled the recipe, and added honey to the bottom of a pyrex dish before microwaving in my stagnant microwave.

I found that 5 solid minutes just wont do the trick alone, as it was very dry for my tastes on the edges, but still fairly liquid in the center. Im going to guess that 2.5 minutes, turn, 2.5 minutes would help cook more evenly if your microwave doesn't spin (1.5 for standard directions).
Also, using this recipe as a base for strawberry shortcakes or any berry-fruit dessert would be marvelous! Pecans would really bring the flavor out as well!
