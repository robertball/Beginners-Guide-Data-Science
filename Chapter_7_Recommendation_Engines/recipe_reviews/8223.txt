I work at a B & B.  I decided to make this coffee cake because I was craving rhubarb.  Well, am I ever thankful this made two cakes!  I served only 4 guests but they each had two pieces!  Unheard of, at least as far as sweets usually go.  This was DELICIOUS and then some.  Thank you for such a wonderful and easy recipe.  I will definately be making this in the future.  Of course, I may also be tempted to try it with raspberries or strawberries...

We really enjoyed this cake. I used just 2 T oil and 5/8 c applesauce to reduce the fat and calorie count. I also replaced the vanilla with almond extract and added a few extra drops to the topping. I also baked in a sheet cake pan instead of rounds. No adjustment was needed on bake time.

Like others I found this an easy cake to make and irresistible when cooked.
I did change the almonds for walnuts as I love them also added 3 cups of rhubarb and an extra teaspoon of baking soda.  Again like a lot of others I didnt put the nuts into the mix but only ontop and added extra. I also poured the mix into a 11 inch cake tin lined with greaseproof and baked for 45 mins it was perfect.  Will use this time and again.

This is a good basic coffeecake. I made a couple of changes: I used 2 1/2 cups of rhubarb and that seemed a good amt, I substituted unsweetened applesauce for half of the oil (worked great!), I left the almonds out of the batter and felt the almonds in the topping were enough, I used almond extract instead of vanilla (ok-but I'll use vanilla next time.). My biggest piece of advie on this recipes and any other rhubarb recipe is to NOT bake it in a shiney aluminum baking pan. The rhubarb reacts to the metal and while it doesn't affect the cake, it does damage the pan with spots where ever the rhubarb touches the pan. This was a yummy way to use up rhubarb!

This was really good.  I made a batch and a half and used one 9-in pan and one 11-inch deep dish pan.  The bigger one took about an hour in the oven and came out perfect.  The almonds were the best part...they tasted like pralines with all the butter and sugar baked on them.  I added cinnamon to the batter and the topping.  I wasn't sure if it was a typo or deliberate, but rhubarb coffee cake with no cinnamon???  I don't think so. :)

This is a good recipe for using all the rhubarb I have this year.  I thought it just needed some tweaking.  The adjustments I made are: use 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond, replace 1/2 the flour with whole wheat (you hardly notice), didn't put the almonds in the batter, 2 1/2 c rhubarb (my husband and I both agree that it still needed more), replace 1/2 the oil with applesauce (I think it wound up moister that way), and used egg powder & powdered milk (both reconstituted) in place of the egg and milk.  Can you tell I'm trying to use my food storage too? :)  I think it turned out great, but my husband wanted walnuts instead.

Very tasty. Be sure to brown the slivered almonds in the oven before using them. I microwaved the rhubarb to soften it, and then squeezed out the water, before adding it to the recipe.

This is a very beautiful cake! I increased the rhubarb and topping as others have suggested. I took one cake into work and saved the other for home!

We loved this. Cut the recipe in half to make one cake and didn't add almonds to the batter - just extra for the top. I think it was the almonds that made it so great for us.

This is a nice moist cake! I added 3C. of rhubarb (only because thats how much I ended up with after chopping it up), doubled the topping, only adding almonds in it and not the cake part; poured it into a 9x13 pan and baked it an extra 5 mins.

I couldn't resist buying some fresh rhubarb at a market last weekend so I decided to come here and find a recipe for rhubarb coffee cake (my father being a huge fan of both rhubarb and coffee!)  I used whole wheat flour and replaced the oil with applesauce. I also used walnuts instead of almonds because I find they are a more interesting taste in cakes.   The result was delicious! A nice, dense coffee cake that still tastes amazing with the healthy modifications.

This gets an enthusiastic 5 stars!  As other reviewers suggested, I also used half applesauce in place of half the oil.  I only had 1 c. plus 1 T. brown sugar, but it was just the right sweetness for us even with doubling the tart rhubarb to 3 cups. I put almonds on top and in the batter as directed and liked it that way.  I know I'll be making this again.

Wonderfully moist and delicious! Non-rhubarb eaters loved it too! I followed other suggestions and substituted applesauce for most of the oil, increased the amount of rhubarb to close to 4 cups, added 1 cup strawberries, used almond extract in lieu of vanilla, and used Splenda Brown Sugar Blend for baking. What a hit at work! Yummmmmmmy! Will make again and again.

I firmly believed that rhubarb was a terrible waste of good garden space, and that it didn't belong in any recipe at all. However, I discovered this recipe and due to an abundant rhubarb crop this year, I tried it out. WOW...what an awesome recipe. I followed the recipe exactly save for replacing half of the oil with applesauce, using ground almonds instead of sliced, and upping the amount of rhubarb to 2 1/2 cups. I had to bake it about 10 minutes longer than suggested, but it made 2 very attractive and delicious rhubarb coffee cakes. I've been converted.

I like this recipe with 3 cups of rhubarb and yogurt instead of milk. It takes about 45-50 minutes to bake then. I also only use half the sugars and it's still plenty sweet.

I am always looking for new coffee cake recipes as I own and operate and All Natural Bakery and a B&B. This recipe was stupendous!!! Because we are all natural/organic, here are the modifications that I made.
I freshly ground my soft white wheat into pastry flour right before I mixed it up. (Fresh ground flour makes a world of difference in whole wheat baking) I then used organic evaporated cane juice for the sugar. I used 2 cups of fresh rhubarb right from my garden. I also did not put the almonds in the cake part of the recipe only in the toping.I tripled the topping portion of the recipe and added  1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg as well as a 1/2 cup  of the pastry four. I used 2  - 9" spring form pans sprayed with non stick cooking spray and then I dusted them with the organic evaporated cane juice before filling. I had to bake the cakes about 10 minutes longer. They turned out fabulous!!! I will definitely be using this recipe on a regular basis. Nice and moist with great flavor!!  Enjoy!!

Inspiring. I don't understand these people giving one away! We gobble them both up! They go quickly. I also put 3 cups of rhubarb in, and that makes it perfect. Thanks for the recipe! We go crazy for it.

I doubled this to make four cakes (I have a lot of rhubarb). I didn't put the almonds in the cake just on top. Probably used about 4 cups of rhubarb. Very good cake but I would have liked it to rise a bit more but I'm putting that down to the fact that I doubled the recipe. As long as my rhubarb keeps growing I will be making this. Many thanks

I was not impressed with this recipe.  However, I rhubarb was not in season and I had to use raspberries.  It lacked flavor.

Taking the suggestions of earlier reviewers, I used almond extract and increased the amount of chopped rhubarb to 2 heaping cups.  After all, rhubarb is one of the finer things in life!  The baking time had to be increased several minutes due to the extra moisture, but it was well worth the wait!  Thanks so much for a great recipe.

This cake is very moist and so good!  I used 1 cup of apple sauce instead of the oil to lessen the fat content.  I also baked it in a sheet cake pan.  It baked to perfection in 35 minutes.  My first coffee cake!  I will make it again!  A great way to use my mass amounts of rhubarb.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was barely out of the oven for 10 minutes and I had to try it. YUM! I did just half a recipe (1 whole egg, everything else worked out) and then used the whole topping recipe (of course!)...adding maybe 1tsp cinnamon to both the cake and the topping. Wow, this is easy and outstanding! I'm excited to share it with coworkers tomorrow!  (PS: if serving as dessert, would be excellent with a dollop of fresh whipped cream...yum!)

This is my favorite coffee cake.  The whole family loves it! It freezes well, so you can eat one and save one for another time. I've tried a lot of rhubarb recipes from this site, (it's the one thing that will grow in our garden) and this is the best!

Our whole family loved this!  I did substitute almond extract for the vanilla and apple sauce for half of the oil, but otherwise followed the recipe.  It needs about 10 more minutes baking time if you use a 9x13 pan instead of 2 9" round pans (which I didn't have).  Fabulous!

I like this recipe.  Tried making it after reading all the reviews as well as reading some other rhubarb cake recipes on this site.  Some reviewers thought this didn't have enough rhubarb and suggested increasing the amount to 4 c, in addition to substituting almond extract for the vanilla extract; however some had problems with a soggy cake.  I thought I would try a different approach and cut down on the competing flavors and a little sugar and see if maybe I could draw out more of the rhubarb flavor. My substitutions were: 1 1/4 c. brown sugar, 1/3 c. oil, 1/3 c. applesauce, (vanilla extract was perfect for our taste at 1 tsp.), 2 c rhubarb, 4 strawberries, chopped.  All in all I was pleased with the result, which was a moist cake that presented really well and tasted like rhubarb and almonds, flavors my family really enjoys. I guess if you are looking for a recipe that emphasizes just rhubarb, I would suggest you keep looking, but if you want a unique cake that has several complimentary flavors I would highly recommend this recipe.

i made this with apples and cranberries instead and was awesome. also for topping i ground up a bunch of almonds and added a little brown sugar, white sugar, flour and buter in a blender. then i poured that mixture (mostly nut) over th4e top to kind of cut down on some of the butter. i think i ended up using a total of 1 tbs butter

i made this recipe one day when i had some extra rhubarb on hand and it turned out wonderful.  i ended up baking it with walnuts instead of almonds in a bundt pan, which worked well.  of course i put the topping on the bottom of the pan, so when you flip the cake out, the mixture is on top.

Family loved this, I thought it was good but could use a sweet fruit to throw off rhubarb/almonds.  Try topping with strawberries or stir apples into batter.  If you want a layer cake, just avoid the sugar topping on one (sprinkle twice as much on other) and layer them that way.  A caramel icing would go well.  Do use white sugar for topping, not brown...it's odd, but it works!

This coffee cake was delicious!  My grandmother gave me a bunch of fresh picked rhubarb and since I never had it before, I wasn't sure what to do with it.  I chose this recipe because of all the good reviews it got and it sure lived up to it's reputation.  Preparation was extremely easy.  Since I didn't have almonds I substituted walnuts, and I didn't have brown sugar so I used white sugar with a little molasses.  It still came out great!  Thanks for posting this recipe!

I used strawberries instead of rhubarb and pecans for the almonds. My family loved this cake! It's a good thing it makes two, because everyone ate more than one piece.

Alright, I thought this recipe was a 3 or 4 (good but not amazing), but everyone told me it was a 5.  I used 2 cups rhubarb, 1 cup strawberries (one does not exist without the other, no?), and at least 3x the topping (but only 2 tb butter).  Baked it for 40 min in a 9x13 pan and people raved.  Who knew?  They even asked for the recipe...thanks for the post!

This was my first cake, ever. It turned out delicious, and I was definitely impressed with the recipe.
I added a few cranberries in with the rhubarb and it was delish! I think baking and I may begin to develop a special relationship :)

We don't have the same kind of brown sugar in Sweden as you do in the States, so I used white sugar and molasses. It came out good, but maybe a touch too sweet. I will adjust a bit on my next try. Very moist cake.

This is such a good recipe!  I was looking for ways to use some frozen rhubarb, I didn't want to make the usual pie, muffins, or rhubarb crisp.  This recipe is SO good, makes a very flavourful cake that is very moist.  Also freezes well!  I made a couple changes...added 1 tsp of amond extract to the batter along with the vanilla, and also added a simple icing sugar/milk glaze to the top of the cake after baking and cooling.  SO GOOD!  We're looking forward to trying this recipe with different fruits too, but will definately be making this again and again, this recipe now has a home in my permanent recipe file!

This is amazing! I only wish I'd had more rhubarb--I was only able to use 2 c. I adore the topping though, and will likely use this on other cakes and muffins as well. Following the advice of other reviews, I subbed applesauce for half the oil and left the nuts out of the batter. I also added a dash of cinnamon to the topping, to give it a little extra kick. Delicious! I'm tempted to eat it all myself. ;)

Very tasty. I didn't have almonds, so made it without. I'd also cut the recipe in half and baked in a pie plate. I might bake a little longer next time. Was still a little mushy in the middle even after testing with a toothpick for doneness.

A++. Fabulous.  Made it exactly as written.  Might add some cinnamon next time, but even without it's delicious.  My husband who doesn't even like sweets thought it was fantastic.

Very good!  I made half a recipe, with one whole egg, and the full amount of topping as FNCHEF recommended.  It turned out great!  I added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter, and a little cinnamon to the topping as well.  One other thing I did was sprinkle the bottom of the pan with cinnamon and sugar after greasing it before I put the batter in.  We didn't have any almonds on hand but it was really good without them!

After reading the reviews,I must be the only one in the world who feels strawberry does not go with rhubarb. I personally love raspberries with rhubarb so I added them for more flavor. I like this cake and think the topping is good.

A 5* with my alterations.
I added 2.5 cups frozen(thaw) rhubarb olive oil, and almond extract, instead of vanilla and 1 cup of brown sugar. I used brown sugar for the topping and see that I forgot to add melted butter(didn't appear to need it). Put in a medium springform pan for about 50 minutes. Served with real whipping cream with almond extract as well.

Very good.  I used applesauce rather than oil and it was super-moist.  I stacked the two cakes and drizzled with a simple powedered sugar glaze.  made for a nice presentation.  I love rhubarb and almonds together!

I made this without the almonds because I didn't have them on hand and didn't make the topping either. It was still a good flavor and moist.

I harvested my Rhubarb last night and started poking around the internet see what kind of coffee cake I wanted to make with it. This was so easy to make and delicious, I also had everything I needed already in the pantry.  My husband is gluten intolerant so I subbed the wheat flour with Gulten Free Mama's Almond Flour Blend and added a 1/4 tsp of Xanthan Gum and kept the rest of the ingredients the same. I also  made muffins rather than 2 rounds because I didn't have 2 round pans, and baked for 25 minutes. They turned out perfect, literally perfect. So delicious, I will be making these again this summer.

I would personally give this 3 starts, but all of my B&B guests said they liked it (no one took seconds though).  I think it needs twice as much rhubarb, and I would toast the almonds before using.  I followed the recipe exactly as stated except I made it in a 10 cup bundt pan (put the streusel on the bottom of the pan).  It looked lovely and smelled great - it just didn't have that much flavor, which surprised me.  Oh well, will try another.....

This is a wonderful coffee cake.  I followed the recipe exactly.  At the last minute after I already had the topping on, I decided to double the topping.  I made the second batch of topping with brown sugar instead of granulated - so each cake had a little of both on top.  The cake was moist and flavorful and the combination of the 2 sugars was a nice change of pace.  Everyone loved this - great recipe!

Wow!  What a great little recipe!  I made only one change and that was putting pecans instead of almonds into it.  It was something I had on hand and it came out FANTASTIC!  I'm sure if any nuts would be great... almonds, pecans, walnuts...  super easy, moist!  YUMMY!  a great hit and definitely a repeater!!  Thanks for a great recipe!!! :)

Boy I thought I would like this better based on all the great reviews, but it was SO soggy!  I did go ahead and put in 4 cups of rhubarb, as recommended by others.  It was still hard to taste the rhubarb, so I can't imagine using only 1 1/2 cups.  This was also not sweet enough for me, but that's more personal preference than anything.  It was really the sogginess that will keep me from making it again.

Great Recipe!
Here are my changes.  I added about 4 cups of rhubarb, substituted applesauce for about half the oil, and baked it in cupcake tins.  The 4 cups of rhubarb was perfect.  I like the flavor of rhubarb and so I was able to taste it but it was NOT overpowering or too tart.  I didn't change any sugar amount.  I baked in cupcake tins for about 25 min.  Turned out great.  I definately recommend this recipe but just add more rhubarb.  Making this recipe again this morning.
Yummy!

Rhubarb was an anticipated spring/summer harvest my husband and I looked forward to--actually, he LOVED rhubarb.  I'm not a fan of strawberry rhubarb pie (but raspberry rhubarb is good!), and rhubarb crisp can only go so far.  I found this recipe several years ago and it was a real favorite for both of us.  This recipe is easy to put together, travels well, tastes fantastic just as written, and one he liked me to make just so he wasn't just talking about how good it is, but to show it off to others.  I lost him to cancer 4 years ago and its been a long time since I've been able to make some things.  I'm just getting ready to make and take this great coffee cake to a Reveal Party.  Yep, my turn to show off!

Thank you, Neris, for an outstanding recipe!

This was fantastic. I had only one pan so I made one big cake. It took way too long to bake... Over an hour, but it was still delicious. I didn't have sliced almonds but put some whole into a coffee bean grinder for a few seconds and it worked out fine. I also doubled the topping as I always do on coffee cakes! I used almond milk as that was what I had and the flavor went well with the cake. My boyfriend was impressed and we both had seconds!

This is one of my favorite recipes from this site. The first cake is always gone in one sitting.  I usually put in extra rhubarb as many others have suggested as well, as I love the tartness, and usually don't mix the almonds into the batter.

I made this tonight and my husband and I LOVED it! I tried this recipe as I've been receiving Rhubarb through my farm share and I'm sick of making strawberry/rhubarb tarts and pies. In an effort to cut down on the fat/calories I did substitute 1/2 oil with 4 tbsp. of Greek Yogurt (I didn't have any applesauce handy) and used 1% milk (although recipe doesn't specify what type). It was definitely moister and didn't look like the picture (the topping melted into the coffee cake) but we still thought it was wonderful.

This was fabulous! Normally I rate a recipe as it is written but with the reviews leaning in favor of 3 cups Rhubarb I made mine accordingly. Then I used fresh ground soft wheat, 1/2 cup kefir w/ 1/2 cup milk, 1/3 c applesauce w/ 1/3 cup melted butter (I don't use vegetable oils). 1 cup sugar was wonderfully sweet, no need for more here. Added a tsp cinnamon. No almonds in the cake but doubled the topping. Cooked in a stone bundt pan then realized the almonds would be on the bottom LOL, next time I'll use a spring form to keep those pretty almonds on top. Really appreciated the reviews on this one.  I'm sure it's truly delicious as written also. Thanks Neris for sharing this "Mom PLEASE make this again" recipe.

This was awesome!! I made more topping for each cake and added a sprinkle if cinnamon to it. Also added 1/2 tsp of almond extract after reading some of the reviews. Everyone loved this cake. Even my husband who does not care for rhubarb. I will make again soon.

Checked many sites, this one stood out, as previous cooks were able to adjust so many ways to their liking!  I made in the bundt pan and added 3 full cups of rhubarb.  Coked for 55 minutes @350.  Once cooled, I drizzled icing made with amaretto and it is delicious!  I ate two pieces, my husband ate FOUR, yes ladies - 4!  Very nice flavour, moist and would maybe add more topping next time.  When I served a piece to my son, my husband kept swipping the topping off my sons' piece!  Excuse me while I get another piece - ENJOY!

The cake came out perfect. I used walnuts because I didn't have almonds at home. All my friends like it also because it wasn't to sweet. Thank you for sharing.

Loved it because it's not super-sweet-over-the-top like so many desserts now and I have lots of rhubarb to use. I like the crunch the almonds give throughout.  I chopped whole almonds rather than buying sliced & used 1/2 cup organic cane sugar in place of some of the brown sugar bc I ran out.  Next time I will try more rhubarb and applesauce for 1/2 the oil like others did & try a bundt/ring pan.

This was good, thanks for sharing! I kept tasting salty bites though, even though I felt like I mixed well...so will have to be more careful with that next time.

I make lots of rhubarb recipes and keep very few - they just don't 'do it' for me..  This one, though, is a keeper!  I love the addition of almonds on top.  
I did make changes that other people had suggested - almonds only on top, cinnamon in the topping, and using applesauce instead of oil.  I also used 3 c. of rhubarb.  I also made it in a square cake pan to keep and two small loaf pans to give away as gifts.  They all turned out great!  I'll be making this one again and again!

Bravo! Added 3 cups rhubarb, no almonds in batter, almond extract instead of vanilla, and topping x 3. Coffee and donuts at church...people took some with them "for the road" and requested the recipe. Yeah...well done!

This was wonderful. I only made a few changes. I added about 1 tsp of cinnamon, increased the rhubarb to 2 c (because that's what I had), and added a small amount of almond extract to the topping. I also baked it in a 9 x 13 pan for 40 minutes. My whole family loved it. Thanks for a great recipe!

Family liked it. I thought it was ok.  It did not rise much, and was dense though moist.  The amount of sugar and oil in it is the reason I won't be making this again.

This was so good, but I didn't think the topping was enough for both coffee cakes, so I doubled the butter, almonds and did white and brown sugar.  Still could have been more, but was so goodl  Going to do it with apples blueberries next time - yum!

This was delicious.  I substituted olive oil for vegetable oil since I was all out and added a dash of nutmeg and a dash of cinnamon.  The amount of rhubarb was perfect in the recipe, not to much, not to little.  I love nuts of all kind, and I personally would add more almonds on the top when I made this again!  I would definetly make this again!

I followed the recipe exactly. I had to use frozen rhubarb because it was not available fresh at my grocery store. This did not bring the recipe down though. I ended up with two beautiful cakes that I was proud to share. The flavor and texture is even better the next day!

I used half whole wheat flour and chopped, slivered almonds (all I had).  I found the recipe quite bland, I prefer alot more flavor.  I would say it needs at least double the rhubarb.

I made this for my mother to take to work where it was a hit. I veganized it by substituting 1/4 c. soy yogurt for the egg, and soy milk for the regular milk. I also added about 2 cups of rhubarb and didn't add nuts to the batter. My topping was a mixture of walnuts, oatmeal, granola, white sugar, and enough margarine to make it crumbly (about 2 tbsp). I also baked in a 13x9 baking dish. When it was cool I put a powdered sugar glaze on it, because all breakfast things taste better with sugar glazes :)

This was really good, however, I changed a few things.  I added 3/4 c coconut, 1 tbsp cinnamon and 1 cup of blueberries.  I made muffins instead.  I also added coconut to the crumb mixture along with the almonds and cinnamon.  I ate 3 of them....yummy!!

I love Rhubarb so I thought I gotta try this cake on Mothers Day based on the ratings.  I was disappointed as I grew up with Rhubarb desserts and cake and hoped for a great cake.  It put 4 cups of Rhubarb and replaced half the oil with applesauce.  I should have added even more Rhubarb.

This is an awesome recipe.  I did use half applesauce and half oil, I definitely will use more rhubarb next time, and I just about doubled the topping. Other than that, everyone that tried it, for sure liked it...gone in one morning!

I think this is terrific.  I was low on butter so needed a rhubarb cake make w/oil.  Moist and the topping is very crunchy and pretty. Forgot to stir the almonds into the batter but it was still great.

It was very moist and delicious. I used cranberries and subbed almond extract for vanilla and it was perfect! Any tart fruit would be good in it I think. The edges of mine were a bit overdone by the time the middle was cooked

Made  w/ 2c rhubarb, and almond only on top. Good but plain (add spice next time). Made thin icing with powdered sugar, cinnamon, and milk, drizzled over cut pieces – yum. Tasted better second day with moistness from rhubarb having time to meld.

LOVE this delicious cake!! After reading the reviews, the only changes I made were using 2 cups of rhubarb instead of  1 1/2, and I added 1 tsp. almond essence and 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon for a hint of flavour. These were not necessary additions and the cake would have been wonderful without it, just tweaked slightly for my personal taste. This cake is also better the second (or third!) day! It's not too sweet, not too heavy, not too fruity... just right! Thank you for sharing! I will be using this recipe regularly. I may even try making muffins with it!

I followed the recipe and was delighted with the results. I did use a sheet pan and cooked 40 mins (my oven tends to be a bit slow anyway). An easy and delicious way to use up the mountain of rhubarb I have.

Very moist and the rhubarb adds just a little tartness that goes well with a scoop of ice cream.

Very easy to throw together and tastes great! I served this for Easter breakfast and was able to give an entire cake to friends for their Easter as well.

This was a moist, slightly tart cake with a crunchy, nutty topping.  I used a teaspoon of almond instead of vanilla extract.  Since I made it for a potluck, I used a 9 x 13 baking dish,  not the two round cake pans, and it baked up perfectly in the same amount of time.  I would make it again!

I made this for Easter breakfast. Actually, we ate it for dessert, too. (I made some whipped cream with honey to dress it up for dessert.) This moist cake was delicious! The almonds gave it a touch of crunch. I will definitely make this again and again.

We have a nut allergy so I omitted the almonds, but otherwise made the recipe as written.  Delicious!  Next time I might try the applesauce idea.

A very easy and tasty coffee cake. But definitely add extra rhubarb. I used 2 1/2 cups, and wished I had done a bit more.  I also used a combination of vanilla and almond extract, and half oil and applesauce. Texture was perfect. This time I used coconut oil as the oil in the recipe and added coconut instead of almonds in the batter.  then I used all the almonds on the top of the cake.  Also used a good 3 cups of rhubarb.  TASTY!

I was wanting to use some rhubarb from my freezer, realizing  too late that it was stewed rhubarb! I decided to try it anyway and cut the milk in half (probably could have used less oil instead... but I was already committed to it.)  It came out well, very tender if a wee bit bland.  That said my rhubarb was bland, so I expected that and added almond extract and a little nutmeg.  After I baked it, I realized I had some candied ginger, so I chopped up a bit and sprinkled on top.  It gave it the pop it needed.  If I make this again, I will definitely add ginger to the batter.  That would take it to a 5.

This is an easy cake to make. It turned out well and everybody liked it. The only thing I would change is I would add more rhubarb. There wasn't enough!

Instead of the 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar, I used 1/2 cup of maple sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar. In addition, I used melted (not hot) coconut oil. Makes is absolutely amazing. I've made this recipe twice and once with frozen (thawed) rhubarb and once with fresh. Both yielded a wonderful result.

I followed the tips to add more rhubarb and use a bit less sugar. It came out so tasty that two of us finished it off in three days. It was hard to make it last that long.

Ground whole almonds, used 2 cups frozen rhubarb and 2 cups frozen blueberries.  Rinsed the fruit and paper towel dried, though still frozen.  Used Almond extract vs. Vanilla. Doubled the topping.  Made 12 muffins (no cupcake liner) and a very small square metal baking pan.   Left over night on counter on metal cookie rack  with dish towel over the top, so no moisture like with tupperware.

I made this tonight and both my husband and I loved it.  I probably had double the amount of rhubarb.  I used the almonds in the cake, but didn't have any left so used hazelnuts for the topping.  Delicious!  I also used Almond Milk, as well as 1/2 coconut oil and half applesauce.  Moist and delicious.  I put one cake in the freezer; hopefully it will still taste delicious when I use it.

Great recipe, I did tweak it for a more Scandanavian twist since I was preparing it for a "fika" which is a Swedish traditional coffee break with friends.  To the base recipe I added 1/4 tsp cardamom and a dash of nutmeg in with the  dry ingredients plus 1 tsp of orange zest with the wet ingredients.  Wonderful!  I would make it again.

I have a huge rhubarb plant, and have been trying everything to use it up.  This was delicious- brought it to a friend's place, and everyone raved over it.  I had to bake it for much, much longer than the recipe said, though.  Also, I subbed in half the oil with plain yoghurt, and next time I'll add more rhubarb.  However, absolutely delicious!

I made this for work today in a 9x13 pan exactly as is--topping was pretty, everyone loved the almonds in it.  No one would know there was rhubarb in it if I didn't put the recipe near the cake.  Next time, I will decrease the sugar (or add more rhubarb) and try it in a springform pan.

Very moist and sweet!   My husband accidentally bought cane sugar instead of brown sugar, but it tasted just fine.  I also put did 1/2 white flour and 1/2 whole wheat. I also added a touch of cinnamon. All in all it was very delicious.
