This really is a great base recipe for a tasty soup.  I did however, read some of the comments on how bland it could be so I opted to sautee some diced onion (about 1/2 of a small one) and 2 cloves of garlic in olive oil before adding two boxes of vegetable broth and a chicken bouillion cube.  I brought this to a slow boil and added the Italian style diced tomatoes and a couple of pinches each of dried oregano, thyme, parsley and a little red pepper flake for some heat.  One this came back to a boil, I added about 6oz of fresh spinach to the broth (I didn't want to cook away the nutrients into water I'd be throwing out) and a few minutes later added some chicken and proscuitto tortellini.  Just a little kosher salt and some fresh ground pepper, simmered it for about 10 minutes and then served it up with parmesean cheese and some parmesean toast.  Absolutely wonderful!  Thank you!

This was delicious.  Neither my boyfriend, brother or I eat tomatoes, so we pulverized it in a hand blender, then added it to the broth.  I also added a little cornstarch for body, which worked out nicely.  I added the grated parmesan to the soup while cooking, then covered with shredded parmesan while eating.  Cannot wait to make this again!!!!!

This soup is VERY delicious and absolutely beautiful.  I added a handful of chopped baby carrots when boiling the spinach and tortellini.  It was very colorful!  This is probably the most delicious soup I've ever had!!

This is such an easy recipe and keeps great.  Some variations I have done...use chicken broth...use a can of diced tomatoes to stretch it-great for when you just need a serving or two more...use frozen chopped spinach to save time.  Even people who don't like spinach love this one!  A GREAT year round soup.

Excellent! I used low sodium fat-free broth and just added lots of spices: salt, pepper, Mrs. Dash, cayenne pepper, basil, thyme, oregano, onion powder, and 1 clove garlic.

I loved this and so did my boyfriend, but since I didn't follow the original recipe and instead took up some of the ideas in the reviews, I gave it only 4 stars.
I started by heating a large oninon and fresh spinach in a bit of olive oil, then added the garlic and sauted for 2 more minutes. I then added a can of crushed tomatos (my boyfriend also doesn't care for tomato chunks) and the vegetable broth, as well as some dried basil, freshly ground pepper and freshly grated parmesan.  I used a half bag each of frozen meat and cheese tortellini, but cooked them separately, so I could get a better idea of how much pasta I wanted in the soup (I ended up using all of what I had cooked).  Right before serving, I grated additional parmesan into each bowl.  Prepared this way, the dish wasn't bland at all, quick and easy to make, and except for the spinach, I had all ingredients already on hand.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe was only edible for me because I added many different seasonings and spices.  It was still bland.  Will not make this again.

A good start, but needs work in my view.  Also, inexperienced cooks may find the recipe too vague -for example, garlic is mentioned in the ingredients list but doesn't say what to do with it. I used homemade beef broth from meaty bones, tomatoes I had put up from my garden, and a good glug of red wine.  I sauteed two chopped leeks and some minced garlic in olive oil until tender and added it to the soup along with some Tuscan seasoning. Hubs unfortunately does not like cheese tortellini so I used a frozen mini meat ravioli instead. I used far less spinach, maybe 2 ozs. Finally, to make the soup a little heartier, I added a can of cannellini beans.  Now we're talking! With a little embellishment this was a wonderful, fulll-flavored soup.

This is a very good soup.  And so easy to prepare.  Only changes I made were using chicken stock instead of vegetable, and using a 10oz pkg. of frozen chopped spinach.  I also added some carrots and cooked the tortellini separately adding right before serving.  These were all suggestions of previous reviewers so I can't take credit for them however, I would suggest the same changes.  Will definitely be making this again.

This soup was easy to make & very flavorful after I added some spices. (My husband said I could make it every week..he's never said that in 28 years.) However, I added Mrs Dash salt free Minced Onion Medley & even more Mrs Dash salt free Italian Medley. The amounts could be added to your taste. Since I used canned broth there was plenty sodium already.

Very good and very simple to make! I made it easier to make by just mixing everything together and simmering for about 20 minutes. Works just fine!

I made this tonight, and because of everyone's suggestions I sauted a small onion and 2 cloves of garlic in olive oil before adding the broth and tomatoes, and added black pepper and Mrs Dash Italian Blend. Simmered that 15 minutes then added my spinach...cooked the pasta separate and added it. Delicious!!!

giving this a 3 not for taste but because the recipe is wrong. the taste was actually just fine. but this says it makes 4 servings (no way ... MAYBE 6 but probably more like 8) and while it has garlic and parmesan in the ingredients, they are not in the directions. i used low-sodium broth and garlic powder instead of the minced (since i didn't know when to put it in). i served the parmesan on top at the end. it was yummy but the recipe itself needs clarification.

Added a lot more herbs as well as chicken smoked sausage.  Doubled the amount of broth to make the soup go a little further and used 2 cans of tomatoes.

this soup came out a bit bland. I did add a small amount of leftover chicken. as well as some extra vegetables. Ihtink it would have been a little better if ihadused chicken stock or a couple boullion cubes. Overall it wasn't bad, and it was very simple to make, i just felt it needed something.

i really enjoyed this soup tonight with my daughters.  stomach flu has been ravaging my house this weekend so i wanted something simple to eat for dinner as we all appear (knock on wood) to be getting better.  it had great rich flavor, but was simple enough for sensitive stomachs.  i didn't simmer for as long as it said to, but otherwise followed the directions exactly.  i will keep this recipe and definitely make it again.  thanks!

The soup was really good but I just used this as a base. I only had 4 cups broth so it was more stew like. I started by sauteing onions & garlic, then adding chopped carrots, broccoli & a can of white beans. I added the broth and brought it to a boil then added the tortellini, let that cook for about 5 minutes, then added some seasoned salt and the tomatoes. I served it with a wheat baguette toasted with a smidge of butter and parmesan that I broiled. Not bad and good veggies!

I’m so glad I stumbled across this recipe tonight.  I took a lot of advice from other reviewers to come up with my own concoction.  Sauté garlic and onions, add 3 cans veggie broth and 1 can chicken broth, bring to boil, add stewed tomatoes, a little bit of Italian seasoning, and a lot of red pepper flakes (we like it hot ;-).  Add fresh spinach, return to boil and add cheese tortellini…we couldn’t wait long enough to let it simmer. Going back for my second serving now….wish I would have made more.

This is delicious.  I added leftover smoked chicken, used fresh kale instead of spinach, increased the garlic to 2 cloves, sautéed it with a little onion, carrot.  Then added some basil at the end.  OMG!!!!

I added Italian sausage and Italian seasoning. Very flavorful and made for a very hearty meal that fed 4 people, and we had plenty for leftovers for lunch the next few days. Definitely an easy crowd pleaser!!

I loved this...the kids liked it too, probably would have liked it more with less spinach.  I used a 10 oz package of frozen chopped spinach and it did seem to take over.  I added a sauteed onion and 1/2 pound of gound italian sausage.  I did not have vegetable broth so I used chicken.  OH, and no need to cook the tortellini in a seperate pot, just drop them in your soup towards the end!  It was really fabulous.

I'm giving this 5 stars, but I admit, I altered it beyond recognition.  I cooked up some spicy itialian sausage, added minced onion, garlic powder, the italian stewed tomatoes.  I added beef broth, and cooked the tortellini and fresh spinach in the soup.  I also added cayanne pepper and other spices to kick it up.  This way, it was unbelievable!  I usually try recipes as written first, but I couldn't resist on this one.  I will make this regularly as stated above.  Thank you for the base of this recipe though, it inspired me!

This was awesome.  I make a lot of soups and they do all turn out well, but usually they are much more complicated and time consuming to make.  This was so quick and easy - so much so that I really wasn't expecting much from it.  I was so pleasantly surprised.  I used dry ricotta and spinach stuffed tortellini, and I cut it way down to only 4 ounces.  I kept the other ingredient amounts the same.  It was good, but I felt it needed a little something, so I added more garlic and pepper, a chopped onion, and a bit of red wine.  I think the wine helped a lot.  Made this way, it was enough to feed two very hungry people with a little left over for lunch.  It reheated better than I expected, too.

A delicious, healthy and fast dinner. Who could possibly ask for more? I too used chicken broth and frozen spinach. I also added more seasonings and tryed the new "packaged in the dry pasta section" tortellini. If you haven't already tried it; please do, as the pasta, I feel is much better than frozen. Thanks Midge for making one of my quickie night dinners that much quicker!!

Good healthy lunch!  I made several changes based on previous reviews (added onion & garlic, oregano, thyme, red pepper flakes, basil, italian seasoning) and I used frozen kale instead of spinach, as that's what I had on hand.  Great basic recipe that is easy to tinker with.  I'm guessing this is one of those that will taste different every time I make it, but always be good.

I added some chicken and spices just to make it a little heartier and it was very yummy!  It needed a little kick for our taste so we spiced it up a bit with the green tabasco sauce!

Very good recipe.  I followed other suggestions and added minced onion, basil, oregano and parsley.  I used frozen spinach, and also added a frozen cauliflower/zucchini/lima bean mixture.  Served it with The Italian Bread for Bread Machines recipe on this website and it was great!  Thanks for sharing.

I made this soup for the first time last night.  After reading the reviews about possible blandness, I opted for chicken broth instead of vegetable, used two garlic cloves, added onion, and then added crushed red pepper and Italian seasoning.  Before adding the chicken broth and tomatoes to the pot, I sauteed the onion and garlic in olive oil too.  It added a lot of flavor.    One thing I was unsure of was how this soup would reheat (It's just me and my roommate), but it reheats really well, in case anyone was wondering.

Great and simple recipe. I did make a couple changes in the preparation of this soup. First, I sauteed 1/2 of a large onion (diced) and 2 garlic cloves (chopped) in olive oil until tender and then added the broth and the remaining ingredients. I did not cook the spinach and tortellini separately. I cooked the soup over medium/low heat for 20 minutes. The tortellini were cooked perfectly. Great recipe!

Good but not great.  I used fresh baby spinach, frozen tortellini, and 3 cans of vegetable stock.  I added lots of seasoning (because I buy low-sodium stock) and julienned some ham and threw it in (for my meat-loving husband).  Be sure not to overcook the tortellini when boiling with the spinach, because it will split open during the simmering!

Like some of the other reviewers I thought this was a bit bland even after throwing in some onion and doubling the garlic however my husband really liked it so I gave it 4 stars.

Loved it.  I added some garbanzo beans as my son doesn't eat the tortellini, but at least he got protein from the beans.  I also added a can of tomato paste and some italian seasonings. It was an excellent soup, which I will definitely make again.

I feel like this recipe is a good general outline. I used less spinach and less tortellini, which was good I think. I used petite diced tomatoes and although I liked the consistency, mine had oregano and basil in it and the oregano flavor was too strong. So I ended up having to add a couple tsp. of sugar and some garlic salt. I also added black pepper to taste. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth because that's what I had. I added carrots and celery to the tortellini and spinach while they were boiling. When I served the soup, I crumbled some ritz crackers on top and some more parmesan cheese. It did turn out delicious!

Amid rumors of blandness, I cooked the tortellini and spinach in the broth and did not drain. Added 1 tsp garlic, 1/2 tsp basil, 1/8 tsp black pepper. It was pretty good but missing something. Onion. Next time, I'll sautee the spinach and an onion first, then add to the tortellini and broth. If it still needs something, I'll opt for more tomatoes.

This was my first time making tortellini soup and it was a good recipe to start with :) I used cheese tortellini and a can of crushed tomatoes ( that's all I had on hand and then blended it) I did add some thin sliced carrots. My kids (6 and 13 ) weren't the biggest fans of this soup but the hubby and I will eat it again :) thxs for the recipe

This is now one of my favorite recipes and my family loved it. I have made it twice and the second time I used barley instead of tortellini.  I incorporated some of the suggestions based on other reviews and sauted onion, sauted garlic, added the chicken stock, diced tomatoes, diced carrots, cooked italian sausage, fresh spinach and a variety of spices - red pepper flakes, basil, celery seed, pepper, oregano, and thyme.

I really loved this soup. But you need to saute 1/2 onion and 1 clove garlic for 5 minutes. Add broth and tomatoes, bring to a boil. Add fresh tortellini then 1 minute later add only 1/2 pkg of frozen chopped spinach cook 5 minutes and serve with Parmesan cheese. So, So, good.and it becomes 5 star.

I totally agree with those who say you should review a recipe that was made as written...but...I can't stand bland food and didn't want to waste my time, so I guess I'm really reviewing HINESDLCA's revised recipe--which is delicious!!! I used a whole small chopped onion and then like her, sauted it and 2 garlic cloves in olive oil. Added the can of Italian tomatoes, 6 cups vegetable broth (didn't use chicken broth), a little oregano, basil, pinch red pepper flakes, pepper and 2 tsp. salt and about 6 oz. frozen spinach. Since it was New Year's day and we would be eating it and some other soup, etc., throughout the day, I set the torellini in a bowl on the side and let people add theirs as they ate it so it wouldn't get soggy. I had to let the tomato mixture cook down a bit to increase the flavor, but after that, it was very flavorful and rich tasting. So thanks for the base recipe that inspired the reviewer to tweak it to a great soup !

I have been making this for a few years but forgot to leave a review. This could not be simpler, it's a super quick meal after a busy day. I use chicken broth and frozen chopped spinach directly from a bag which allows you to use a handful or two, whatever you need. It is not frozen into a block like the 10 oz packets are. I use whatever canned tomatoes I have on hand, chopped whatever.  If you wish you can add some meat, perhaps sausage or leftover chicken. I add some garlic powder and Italian seasoning too, just bumps the flavor up a notch but many people would be happy just as it is.  
BTW I cook it all in one pot, gently simmer the tortellini in the broth with the tomatoes.  I add the frozen spinach in the last 2 or 3 minutes turn off the heat and let it sit for 5 minutes. Try it!

This soup is excellent ! I only made one change and that was I added thawed Italian seasoned meatballs and a can of black beans as well.
I served it with homemade biscuits and my family loves it. It's a "keeper" !

This was excellent. Everyone in my family loved it. I even used chicken broth because I didn't have vegetable broth and it was still fantastic. Also, I noticed some poor reviews saying this was too bland. The recipe clearly says to use Italian-style diced tomatoes. Though I didn't have Italian-style tomatoes, I added my own Italian seasons and it turned out wonderful. Definitely worth the 5 stars in my opinion and I'll definitely make it again. Thank you!!

I made this with a very well seasoned turkey broth (leftover from making gravy for Thanksgiving), and it was quite good. I suspect it wouldn't have been anywhere near as good if i had just used veggie bullion. I also added zucchini chunks and cooked the spinach directly in the broth to keep all of the nutrients in the soup. Tasty!

Very good, but WAY too much spinach for our taste. I think I might omit it altogether next time.

I make this soup with two cans of chicken broth, meat tortellini, and use a can of diced tomatoes with garlic, basil and oregano----I saute a clove of garlic in olive oil first, then add the broth, cook the tortellini (frozen, not thawed) and then add then add 5 oz of frozen spinach....and the tomatoes...YUM...got from Weight Watchers.

This soup is great as is.  Fast, tasty. The real beauty of the recipe is how versatile it is - use chicken or beef broth and add any veges to your liking. Thanks for the recipe, Midge!

I really enjoyed this although my children and husband prefer to eat their Tortellini the traditional way-with sauce. They aren't terribly fond of soup, though.

This was delicious.  I added chicken, and significantly reduced the amount of spinach.  I didn't have Italian stewed tomatoes, but I used regular stewed tomatoes...just added Italian seasoning and it turned out perfect.

Very good soup. I made a few adjustments... I added a little bit of italian seasonings and oregano. I also used chicken broth as opposed to vegetable. I like spinach, but next time I'd cut out about 1/2 of the amount called for. It's good in there, but I thought it was a little overwhelming.

I made this recipe because I had everything to throw this together and was so very surprised on how delicious this was.  I did use chicken broth and added less spinach.  I also cooked the tortellini and spinach in the broth.  Thanks for the recipe!  I will be making again and again!

Absolutely delicious.  I did change a few things.  I used chicken broth instead, 2 cans of stewed tomatoes (liquid and all) and added fresh parsley and a small can of mushrooms (drained).  To save time and dishes, I boiled the broth and tomatoes then added the rest of the ingredients and cooked the tortellini right in the soup.  It took about 10 minutes only using 1 pot :-)
enjoy!!

This soup is delicious!  It is very quick and easy to make, and very versatile.  You could add other ingredients and it would still be delicious.  I cooked the tortellini and spinach in the broth to save time and it turned out perfectly.  It is even better with some melted parmesan cheese on top!

I thought this was OK, but my husband really liked it so I gave it a 4.  I probably won't make it again unless my husband requests it b/c all I could taste was the spinach.  If there is a next time I would def. try adding spices to get some more taste out of it.  Thanks for giving me something different to try!

I have made this twice now.  The first time, the result was a very bland soup with not enough liquid.  The second time around, I substituted chicken broth instead of the vegetable broth.  I actually used 3 cans of chicken broth.  I added minced onion and fresh basil.  This is a good base for a soup but needs some help.

I loved this!  BUT...I had to make some changes since the people in my house don't like spinach.  (I do, so I wasn't happy about leaving it out.)This is what I did, even though it changed the recipe a bit.  I added a bag of mixed veggies in place of the spinach, (Broccoli, Carrots, Cauliflower) and two cans of stewed tomatoes.  I also added some fresh chopped parsley with the chopped garlic and a couple of chicken bullion cubes.  It was fantastic!  Thanks for the idea.  One day I hope to do it the spinach way... just for me!  But it is easy, healthy, and I will make it again and again this winter season.

A fast, easy and satisfying soup. I tinkered a bit  by using chicken broth, frozen spinach instead of fresh, and one 9 ounce package of three-cheese tortillini plus one 9 ounce package of lemon-chicken tortillini. Using frozen spinach. means the ingredients for this soup can be kept on hand, so it can be quickly prepared for a last minute lunch or supper anytime. My husband loved it.

I felt like this was a good base, but added chicken which I sauteed with a whole diced onion and the garlic to add some body and protein. I also threw a generous dash of Italian seasoning into the pot. The result was fantastico!

This recipe does need some seasonings, salt at minimum, but fresh herbs like basil and oregano made it taste much better. I think the creator wanted a very simple dish without many steps, but simple recipes often have simple flavors. Also, the instructions need to be proof read for omissions before posting.

Great base. I did play with it some.  Chicken broth instead of veg.  Added sauteed onion, carrot, and squash.  Flaxseed and chia seed.  Cannelini beans.  Topped with garlic croutons, parm. cheese, and fresh basil.

This is a delicious base which lends itself to many improvisations. Extra seasoning, chicken, beans or chickpeas, chopped onions and carrots, any could be added to enhance the taste and hardiness.

Very good soup. I had to cook the tortellinis a little longer than 7 minutes (about 10 mins).  I also shredded some carrots and used chicken broth instead of veggie broth (all I had at the time).

I sautéed some onion and garlic in olive oil, then added some homemade chicken stock from my freezer.  Then added the can of diced tomatoes, thyme, Italian seasoning and parsley.  Brought it all to a boil and added the "fresh" cheese tortellini and a couple big handfuls of fresh spinach.    This is definitely something I will make again.

Delish.  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable because I'm not a veg broth lover.  I used frozen spinach because that's what I had.  It was still delicious and I can only imagine that fresh would have been amazing.  I added rough-chopped carrots and celery which only added to the yumness.  Easy and yummy recipe!!

A great, quick recipe!  I did make a few changes based on the suggestions of others and it really improved the flavor.  I sauteed some chopped onion, garlic and green pepper along with turkey sausage and then added the liquids.  Spices are a must as well.....I used italian seasoning and parsley.  I will absolutely make this again!

My family loves this.  sometimes I add some chicken to "beef it up" a bit.  My only suggestion would be to do the tortellini separate from everything else, cook to al dente - if it's the frozen kind, it doesn't need to be boiled - just simmered for about 2 or 3 minutes - and add right before serving.   Otherwise it tends to get really mushy.

Easy soup to make.  A little bland, so I added a pinch of cayanne, italian seasoning and used chicken broth.  Substituted Kale for Spinach and cooked til almost tender before adding tortellini. Then, WOW it was the bomb!

I'm giving this 4 stars only because I made a few changes: I sauteed a small onion and garlic in 2 tsp. of olive oil then added chicken broth (instead of vegetable) and the tomatoes and brought it to a simmer. Added frozen spinach (thawed and well-drained) and then frozen chicken and mushroom tortellini. It was amazing - so simple and quick and even the kids liked it!! I LOVE this recipe!

This is awesome soup. I make it at least once a month. The only change that I make is I add 3/4 vegetable broth, 1/4 water - to cut out some sodium, I find that the tomatoes give it enough flavor. Great Recipe!

This was so easy and delicious. First I sauteed the garlic in a bit of EVOO.  Then I used beef stock, which I heated to simmer and added a bag of baby spinach and the tomatoes. I cooked the tortellini according to package and threw those in at the end. Served with a big salad and whole wheat rolls...such a quick, easy, and healthy dinner.

Great recipe and so simple. We are trying to have a "soup night" once a week, and I was delighted to find one so easy and tasty. My kids don't like tomato chunks, so I ran them through the blender first. Didn't change anything else and got a "not bad" rating from my non-soup eating 13 year old, which makes it a 5 star in my book for the combination of taste and simplicity. Thank you !

I was really pleased with this. It was so easy and quick! I used crushed tomatoes and chopped fresh spinach (I sauteed the spinach with a half a diced onion as well). I still hit it with a stick bender before adding the tortellini as my kids would eat it better with less chunks in it. Topped with plenty of parmesan cheese this was delicious!

I made this using homemade vegetable broth  ("World's Greatest Vegetable Broth" also from this site).  The homemade broth not only cuts way down on the sodium, but elevates a good weekday soup into a sublime experience.  I also used refrigerated tortellini and fresh baby spinish to keep the light taste and texture.  Great and easy recipe!

This is a delicious, quick, and healthy soup!  I really liked the recipe and would definately make it again.  I did improvise a little by adding cabbage and bell pepper.  Give it a try... you won't be disapointed.
