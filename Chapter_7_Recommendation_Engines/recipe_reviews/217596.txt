I found these hard to review.  The mix of flavors and spices intrigued me, however, when preparation was done the pork chops were tough, which didn’t allow the flavors to fully come through.  I’m not sure if something in the recipe caused this or if I was just cooking an old sow.   I’m going to give this the benefit of the doubt and rate it a four because the small tenderloin part of the chop was quite tasty and tender.  I think this would be better as a marinade for grilled pork tenderloin versus a chop.  I eagerly await other chefs’ comments on this recipe.

This was a very easy recipe and I enjoyed the flavor combination. Great fresh taste for summer grilling! It was a crowd pleaser... And my crowd includes two picky boys! Thanks for sharing!

Pretty Good. I thought there was a little to much tarragon, but altogether it was good.
