Quite simple to put together. I added some oregano to this recipe because we thought it needed something. I also added some Greek peperoncini (the pickled kind) and that made things tasty. As written in the notes, I used some cooked sorghum I had in the freezer to speed things up. If you soak the sorghum for almost an hour, it will cook in a pressure cooker in about 8 minutes. I used about one cup of cooked sorghum per serving.  Thank you for the recipe.
