Iâ€™m not sure if opening a can of beans and a jar of salsa can be considered cooking but I do know that the few ingredients combined in this recipe taste great.  I topped mine with grilled onions and peppers instead of lettuce.  Very easy and delicious.  Paired with some yellow rice and salad and I had an easy weeknight meal.

Call it cooking or not it was a recipe I hadn't thought of.It was "clean out my cabinets week".I don't use refried beans but my daughter had left some.I entered refried beans in the search area and this came up.I had everything else on hand.Easy tasty and a cheap meal.

Easy peasy.  Added just a little more salsa and a teaspoon of cumin.
