A little to "wine-y" for my taste, I'll cut back next time.  I was looking for something a little thicker for dipping, so, I added more flour and I added more honey mustard to the mix and it actually wasn't bad, it kinda grew on ya.  So, that's what I'd change, a little less wine and more honey mustard.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I can't even believe I am going to say this but as written this was too wine-y for me too. Easy fix though. I just kept adding more mustard until I got the taste where I wanted it. Keep extra mustard on hand in case you too need to adjust it.
