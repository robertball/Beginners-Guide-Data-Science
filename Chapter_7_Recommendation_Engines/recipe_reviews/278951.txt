This was delicious! I’m not a seasoned baker. Just a guy locked up at home during a pandemic. This was easy to make and REALLY good. Made me look like a baking genius. Thank you!

This is perfect for a lazy Saturday morning breakfast. As I didn’t have (nor do we care for either) the wheat germ or flax seeds, I left them out. Also made it with SR flour as I was out of plain, so I eliminated the baking powder/soda & salt. This coffee cake is everything I hoped it would be; chocked full of blueberries, subtle flavor of bananas, with a hint of cinnamon. Who could ask for more? It did take a little longer to bake (actually I had to bake it for 45 mins) because it IS so moist. Be sure to check it with a toothpick if additional time is needed. When it came out, I mixed up the glaze (took about 5 teaspoons of milk for me) and drizzled it on the warm cake. While the glaze was fresh, I also added additional chopped pecans - yum! Although this is NOT something you’d want to fix during the weekday because of the time factor involved, it IS DELICIOUS and well worth the wait!
