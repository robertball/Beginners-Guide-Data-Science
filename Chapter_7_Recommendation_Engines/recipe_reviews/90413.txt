These were pretty darn good. I used Italian bread crumbs and omitted the egg and added about 1/4 of really cold, cold water.  Just don't like my burgers tasting like meatloaf and the water makes for a juicier hamburger.  The peppers gave a great jolt.  Thanks for the post.

Delicious! I used pepper jack cheese instead of the peppers and monterey jack called for, and I was out of bread crumbs so I sub'd crushed corn flakes. Oh, and I threw in about a half a package of chili seasoning to the meat mixture. Served it with homemade buns (fron the site) and my hubby loved it =) Thanks for a great recipe! I'll defiantely make this again!

It was a bad idea to put jalapeno/chile peppers and cheese in the middle of the burger. The cheese has all melted out and it was not pleasant to bite into the hot stuff only in the middle. I would just  add/mix jalapeno/chile peppers with ground beef so you can taste it with every bite (adjust the amount by your taste).

Very Good.  I made them exactly as stated, but cooked them on the stove top instead of the oven.  They tasted like meatloaf.  I made them for christmas dinner, and I got away with it.  I called them Christmas burgers, because they had a red, white, and green present on the inside.  Thanks!

I have to give this only *** because as others said, it tasted more like meatloaf.  So taking that into consideration I served it as meatloaf. I used habanero sauce for the hot sauce and I increased the amount of cheese to a cup! Then took the meat and divided it in half, flattened it out, put the topping on and covered that with the other meat portion.  Made certain it was sealed all around so the cheese would not leak out. It was very good as supper and the next day we had it cold for sandwiches. If I rated it as a meatloaf I'd give it a 5*s !

Ok, well I didn't want to go to the store today, so I made a few substitutions - homemade hot sauce for Tabasco; diced chipotle peppers from a can; regular extra-sharp Cheddar - and although they were WAY too spicy for me, Husband really loved them. Thanks so much!

I changed the recipe a little to suit my taste - I didn't add the bread crumbs or egg and I threw in a couple tablespoons of worchestershire sauce and a dash of beer.  Instead of using jalapenos, I used diced green chilis. They were awesome and I really appreciated the creativity of adding spice and cheese to the center of the burger.  I made them for a big cookout and they were a huge hit! Thanks for the recipe!

These are awesome!  Both me and my husband love them.  I used some green chilies also in the pepper mixture.

Very good burgers, only made one change by using shredded cheddar cheese instead of monteray jack.  Came out slightly more well done than I generally like, will cook for a shorter time next time, but otherwise very good.

Pretty good - as other reviewers said, I thought it tasted more like meatloaf than a burger but my husband thought it was great.  I used a slice of pepper jack (folded in half) instead of separate cheese and sliced peppers.  Worked fine on the grill, be careful to get a good seal all the way around or you end up with a huge mess.

I didn't actually use this recipe, I just used the idea to put cheese and chopped jalepenos into the center as suggested here.  It was pretty tasty, but my cheese went away.  It wasn't in the burger, or the pan.  Where'd my cheese go?!

After reading other reviews I decided not to add the egg and breadcrumbs so that it would not taste like meatloaf.  I seasoned the meat and added the onions.  Added Ortega chilies instead of jalapenos because dh cannot handle, but I put jalaps on my burger.  Not bad.  Will probably make again.  Thanks for posting the recipe

I didn't follow the recipe exactly because my family doesn't like spicy foods. I added chopped baccon to the cheese for the center and then I seasoned it the way I would if I were making a regular hamburger. But I did cook it the same way and they turned out great...my 2yr old actually ate the hamburger just to see what was inside!

These weren't bad burgers, but they weren't what we were looking for.  Although the temp wasn't too hot, it was spicier than I would prefer my burgers.

These were really good....but I should have read the reviews first and eliminated the breadcrumbs and egg....they were definitely meatloafy...but over all, pretty good.

Outstanding. I cut some of the chili peppers out as my DH can't eat spicy, also cut the pepper sauce down to 1 teasp. substituted 2 oz (for doubled recipe) cold, cold water as suggested instead of egg, also used more cheese. and since i did not have the one in the recipe, i used Cheddar. This is great. was a huge hit. the only thing is mine needed about 30 minutes in the oven. probably difference in ovens. Thank you for a great recipe!

i made a few changes and these were AWESOME and so so simple- as long as your baking sheet has a lip to catch the drips! i used ground turkey instead of beef, low sodium soy sauce instead of tabasco, and minced garlic-the baking time/temp was perfect!

Very flavorful.  This will definitely be one of our hamburger recipes we use.  We are looking forward to sharing it with our family and friends at a summer cook-out.  We did make a change.  In lieu of the pickled jalapeno and fresh red chile pepper (couldn't find one), we used 1 finely chopped fresh green serrano pepper.

I made this last night and used some of the other reviewers' suggestions. I made mine with cold water instead of egg, cheddar instead of pepperjack and kept them in the oven longer. They were very good, but I have to give it a 4-star rating because, in my opinion, the beef needed more seasoning itself. Once I got to the cheesy, peppery center it was great, but the first and last bites without the cheese/pepper were lacking/disappointing comparatively. Next time I will add more seasoning to the beef.

Very moist burger with just a hint of kick to it. I will serve these again to all  my friends.
