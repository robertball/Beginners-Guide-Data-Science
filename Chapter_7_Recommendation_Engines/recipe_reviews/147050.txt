I tried this cold and hot, and I like it much better hot! If you do try it as a salad, I'd recommend adding a little more vinegar since there's not much dresing for 2 lb. of beans. Also, hot or cold, I think 8-10 minutes is too long to cook the beans. 3-5 minutes is plenty if you like your beans cooked but not mushy.

Double Wow! I made this refreshingly cool, colorful dish a day ahead for a Labor Day get together of some major 'foodies' - got rave reviews and was named "MVC" - Most Valuabe Cook - of the day! I had tiny pearl to grape size red and yellow tomatoes so I just crushed them slightly when I added them to the marinade ingredients. The dainty tomatoes really enhanced the presentation! Our small town did not have fresh oregano to offer, so I took a chance with dried oregano - the taste was still great.  Also had to use regular olives this time - but this dish is a classic - it can be tweaked many ways with successful results.  Will make again soon with the fresh herbs - and then again and again and . . .

This was a terrific combination of flavors.  I made some substitutions, though: instead of fresh seeded tomatoes, I used oil-packed sundried tomatoes as the flavor is more intense, and I omitted the olives (only because I was also serving a pasta salad with fresh tomatoes and kalamata olives and didn't want the salads too similar).  And the cooking time for the beans is way too long: 3-4 minutes is sufficient.  Be sure the pepper is freshly ground and fairly coarse too.  I love balsamic vinegar and wanted to use it rather than the red wine vinegar, but I think the lighter flavor of the red wine vinegar was a good choice.  All in all, a refreshingly different salad.

VERY GOOD!!  This is light and refreshing!  I cooked my beans for 5 1/2 min. before shocking them in ice water and they were perfectly crisp-tender.  I combined everything except the feta, which I just sprinkled on top - I think it's prettier that way.  And next time I'll prep the salad and dressing, but keep them separate, and toss together just before serving.  The beans lost some of their bright, beautiful green color when they were coated with dressing that far ahead.

this dish is amazing, and so simple.  i used grape tomatoes and cut them in half and cooked the olive/tomato/oregano mixture in the garlic for an additional 30 seconds to blend the flavors even more.  definitely tastes better the next day, however when i make it again tonight, i will hold off on putting the feta on the salad until serving.  i wish green beans were in season all year round, because this dish is my new favorite!

I changed the recipe slightly, I halved the amount of green beans and still had leftovers. Hubby loved it and took some for lunch the next day.

Great pot luck dish.  I too used grape tomatoes, halved.  You do have to watch the cooking time on the green beans and be sure to chill at least 3 hours, preferably overnight.

Easy and delicious.  I'm not a big fan of feta, but the olives really complement the flavor of that cheese. I have a lot of green beans and cherry tomatoes from the garden and I can fix this in the morning and take for lunch.

This is an excellent side dish - but you definitely have to use fresh oregano.    I prefer to cut back on the olives, but that is a matter of taste. Thanks for submitting.

So great, I made this twice in one week, it  gone so quickly both times. The only thing I changed was to leave out the kalamatas because I hate olives. Don't try to leave out the feta, because it makes the salad!

Great for a party.  A lot of flavor.  Love it!  Only negative, it does not make good leftovers.

This was an amazingly refreshing side dish.  I served it with a grilled steak and it was perfect for a hot summer night.  I also made the leftovers into a new lunch the next day.  I took the leftovers and added a can of tuna, some red onion and a bit more vinegar and it was a hit!  I will definitely be making this again!

This was very good overall although next time I will remember to not accidently dump the whole container of cheese in when I halved the recipe (note to self, do not talk on the phone and follow a recipe at the same time!)I don't think I used enough olive oil because it was a little "gummy" everything kinda all stuck together, which could have been because the cheese to "wet" ingredient ratio was way off. I will add more olive oil an re-mix for tomorrows lunch.  I didn't use the oregeno becauase my olives were mediteranian blend and already had spices in them.  I will make again but will follow the recipe better.

Everyone loved it - I would suggest making only enough to be eaten the same day it's made as the oil becomes hard when refrigerated.  This was really tasty!!!

Every time I have a BBQ this salad is a must! I cook the beans so they are still crunchy, and add them warm to the marinade. For added flavor I add crumbled bacon, not much but it gives it an flavor boost!

Microwaved the green beans for just 1-1/2 minutes to get the perfect doneness.  For the best presentation, mix in the tomatoes and top with the feta right before serving.  Wouldn't change a thing, liked everything about this.

Very good. Used fresh tomatoes and green beans, but didn't have fresh oregano. I also skipped the olives (watching sodium). The salad was great even with my changes. I bet it would be better the next day, if we had any leftovers.

This recipe was so good.  I took it to a barbecue last night and it was a big hit.  I didn't cook the beans as long either and I immediately put them in ice cold water after about 5 minutes.  I forgot the fresh oregano and substituted dried.  Next time I won't forget.  I bet the fresh would make this salad even better.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was really good, even without the red wine vingegar. Which I forgot to add. Love the combination of all the ingredients. I don't recommend boiling the green beans for 8-10 minutes. 4 minutes and mine were perfect crisp tender, but then they were fresh this morning from the farm stand.

I took this recipe to a Christmas party even though it's termed a "summer dish." People loved it, the red tomatoes with the green beans gave it a festive look. It was nice to be able to enjoy such a healthy option that was delicious!  I used Campari tomatoes (golf ball sized/Costco) and agree with others that the fresh oregano is a must. I maybe used 5-6 oz of the cheese, which was plenty. I already know I will make this again and again.  Finally, thanks to allrecipes, I was able to take this to a party untried because of all the good reviews, I knew it would be good!

I made this recipe for a party.  I followed the directions as stated, except I cooked the beans for about 4 minutes before putting in an ice bath, as suggested by other reviewers.  I am very glad I did.  They would have been much too soft otherwise.  

I am not a huge fan of oregano, but the flavor of this dish is mild enough that I still enjoyed it ( I used the amount stated in the recipe).  Others seemed to like it...  I doubled the recipe, but we didn't have many leftovers.  The leftovers also held up well for the next day although the beans were a little softer, probably from sitting in the marinade.  

I would definitely recommend adding the feta as you serve/refill because as it sits,  it takes the color of the olives and does not look as appealing.  

I would make it again.

Didn't have enough green beans, so last 3 min into blanching process I added some broccoli...worked great!  Also, changed out my herbs for tablespoon fresh, finely chopped basil, skipped the garlic and just added 1/4 chopped red onion to salad, added 1/4 red wine vinegar.  Family loved it.

I just made this, so the flavors haven't had much time to mesh yet. I used sun dried tomatoes since I had no fresh ones. Can't tell yet if it will be bland or not. Perhaps I will cut the olives smaller next time. I will know in the morning if it needs more tomatoes. I'm not typically a huge bean salad fan, but even now it's good. I'm eager to see how it is tomorrow.

Recipe was very Good, and got some rave reviews.  I served it cold, but would like to try hot.  I only had time to let it sit for 3.5 hours, and think it would have been better sitting overnight.  I used grape tomatoes and did not seed them.  Even my husband like them, which is unusual as he does not like cold bean salad.

I've made it twice. The first, as written and it was very good. Then of course I had to tweak it a little to make it five stars. I added a can of artichokes, a red onion, doubled the marinade and since it needed a little more seasoning with the added ingredients, I added 1 tsp greek seasoning. Now, IMO it's perfect.

This was absolutely delicious. I blanched the beans, so the dish was wonderfully crunchy. I used black olives because I didn't have kalamata, and I added extra oregano. Also, I didn't have time to marinate it, and it was still excellent--but even better the next day!

Nice change if you love green beans. Turned out great and left overs were as good as the first serving! Will make again, made no changes.

I liked this as a cold salad but like another reviewer said, I thought it could use more vinegar dressing, given the size of the dish.

This was a HUGE hit! The hubs who normally isn’t a huge fan of feta cheese loved this salad. My 5 yr old had seconds then ate an entire large plate for 3rds! Will def keep this in the rotation.

This dish was amazing!  For better flavor chill overnight at a minimum.  I had fresh herbs from the garden that really gave it the extra boost of flavor.
The second day I poured them over a salad and it was delicious!  No addition dressing was needed!

I make this for parties and for personal. I don't change a thing. It gets GONE. At pot lucks there are alway so many carb choices (pasta, potato, etc.). This is a bright and delicious veggie side dish. Still has carbs but low and most come from fiber. Yay!

I was  looking for a healthier side dish to serve with feta & dill turkey burgers that didn't require turning on the oven when I came across this recipe.  It went perfect with the burgers.  Very fresh and bright.  We found only using half the olive oil,  olives (I used Kalamatas), and cheese (I used feta) offered plenty of flavor with less calories.

Nice side dish to grilled meats for the summer.   Hubby doesn't care for cold veggies, so I popped it in the oven to warm a bit and he liked it!!
Used green olive tapenade, as didn't have black olives on hand, very similar results I'm sure.
Enjoy!

The only change I made was using cherry tomatoes cut in half rather than regular tomatoes.  Took it to a Thanksgiving potluck yesterday and it was the star of the show.  Will now add this to my pot luck list and this will also be on my dinner table quite a lot.

This was so yummy and a really pretty dish. Made it exactly as the recipe says, but with dry oregano (1 tsp), a few more olives (olives rinsed so blackness doesn't transfer and dish stays bright), and halved cherry tomatoes instead of regular tomatoes. I think the sweetness of the cherry tomatoes was important. Served it in a long shallow oval bowl. Really important to NOT overcook the beans. Also really important to let it marinate in the fridge for a few hours.

I cooked the beans about 4 minutes in the microwave, stirring a few times .  And I doubled the marinade as it didn't seem like enough for all the beans.  I also added thinly sliced onions as someone suggested, and I added some red pepper which made it extra tasty.    I used Mediterranean Feta.  It was very good!

This recipe looked delicious. We were given a big bucket of green beans from our neighbors' garden. I was looking for a fresh salad idea and this really looked to be the ticket as we love kalamata olives. However I prefer to cook with ingredients we already have in house. I didn't have fresh oregano but have fresh basil growing in a pot on my deck. I substituted basil for oregano. My husband doesn't like feta cheese so I used fresh grated Parmesan cheese instead. It is a delicious summer salad and looks beautiful with the bright green beans and red tomatoes.

2 lbs of beans is too much.  I made it as written, let it marinate, tasted it, then I removed about 1/2 lb  of the beans & added a half of a red onion sliced thinly, a splash more red wine vinegar and 1/2 tsp more salt. Much better! All in all, this is a really nice dish.

Quick, easy. Perfect for a potluck. I used crumbled goat cheese instead of feta. Not as salty as feta. Big hit at Memorial day picnic.

I used 40 green, pimiento-stuffed olives, 4 roma tomatoes, and I doubled the vinegar.  it was very flavorful and made 12 good-sized servings.

Loved this. I used lemon juice and sundried tomatoes. This will go to the Thanksgiving dinner at church.

I loved this but my husband did not.  He said the beans were too tough.  I love them crispy and he loves all his veggies wilted (too bad).  Very fresh tasting.  I halved the recipe and made as is.  Very yummy!

Absolutely fantastic! The flavors are wonderful.  I have made this twice and it does not stay around for more that two days before its eaten up.  This is a keeper for sure!
