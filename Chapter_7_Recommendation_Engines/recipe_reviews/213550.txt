We made these as Easter treats for family and friends!  People wow over them.  You can use plain crispy cereal and turn them any color you want (pink, blue, purple, etc.) by adding a few drops of food coloring to the marshmallow mixture before mixing in the cereal - use white chocolate or skip the chocolate all together.  You can also make your own frosting using confectioner's (just use the recipe on the box) and add a couple drops of food coloring to tint it any color you like!  You can also tint store-bought white icing.  Try decorating the bunny with a pink body and a white tummy - super cute!  If you don't have an icing piper, here's a tip: spoon icing into a ziplock bag, snip the corner off one edge of the bag (the bigger the cut, the larger the line of icing you will make) and squeeze the frosting in the desired design.  Also, if you don't have round cookie cutters, the mouth of a cup works just as well - just turn the cup over and press it down to cut out a circle.  I used a few drops of green food coloring and tossed it with flaked coconut to make grass, which I sprinkled around the bunnies along with assorted gummy candies and jelly beans for extra character.  Any small pink or red candies make sweet little noses on the bunnies.  Be creative, have fun!  This is a great project to do with kids!  Happy Easter and God bless!

These were very cute, very easy, and tasty enough to satisfy the kids, but my bunnies had droopy ears.  The mixture wasn't stiff enough to support their weight, even after giving the bunny heads time to dry.

I used a bunny cookie cutter and sandwiched two pieces together with Hard Chocolate Glaze (ganache), from this site.  The ganache gave these an extra chocolate boost which was very good.  I also added cotton tails by adding a dollop of ganache and then dipping into white nonpareils.  Very easy and quick to make.  I always toss in extra marshmallows for a softer treat.

I really like the recipe... Though my chocolate started to seize before the marshmallows were totally melted, even with the heat on low... Next time I'll either use mini marshmallows or add the chocolate in after the marshmallows are melted.
