I love these scones. The first time I followed the recipe exactly but omitted the currents (didn't have any). They were great, but I did wish the spices were a little stronger. I just made them a second time, but I DOUBLED the spices and used raisins that I chopped up into bits. I also used light vanilla soymilk because I did not have any milk (I don't think this made any difference).  Turned out amazing!  These are cake-like scones that are (as scones should be) not too sweet.  I will make these scones again and again with the spices doubled!

Really wonderful!  They couldn't be quicker or easier, and the smell is incredible.  I used raisins instead of currants; they were fine.

Great scones! I used a second cup of all-purpose flour instead of whole wheat, and left out the currants. The only problem I had was that they took 25 minutes to cook instead of 15. I especially liked the way the glaze on the top came out.

These are fantastic! They were really tasty the first time I made them, exactly according to the recipe except I used all whole wheat pastry flour and raisins. The second time I made them, I used an extra 1/2tsp of cinnamon and craisins instead of raisins. That really put them over the top. Highly recommended.

Very good scones!... actually the first I've ever made ;). these were very good, and left the kitchen smelling like a cinnamon spicy heaven! surprisingly easy to make, a little bit breaddy for scones, but overall very good. I did not use milk, and they turned out fine with a dollop of yogurt and water.

These are really good as is. I only did half the servings. And I used only regular flour and they turned out just fine. The only thing I would add is more sugar. I think the recipe could double the sugar. Didn't have nutmeg on hand, so I used cloves, and allspice instead. yum yum yum! At little hot tea and you're in heaven folks!

The scones were great!  I like my scones sweet so I doubled the amount of white sugar.  They were delicious!

When you want scones that are a little more nutritional than the ordinary, these are the ones for you.  They taste great. And my kids liked them. I used raisins instead of currants. Next time I will definitely use a full cup.  I only had 1% milk so I used that and it didn't seem to make any difference. You could probably substitute almost anything for the currants and it would be great.  I'm going to try sauteed apples next time with a bit more cinnamon.

My whole family loved these. I didn't have nutmeg so I used ginger and I sprinkled some crushed hazelnuts on top.  It was fantastic!

Tasty, but some of them fell apart.  I'll probably try these again.  I really liked the wheat flavor.

I made these for a Mother/Daughter tea party. They went over fairly well. Perhaps I'm just not much of a scone person, but they tasted a little bland or dry. Overall they were okay, but not my favorite.

These were moist and had nice flavor. I did not have currants so I used a mix of raisins, craisins, and chopped dates. Easy recipe to follow. The dough was a little sticky so I ended up adding a tad more flour until the consistency was right to shape.

They turned out just a little dry, next time I would add more butter. Also, thought doubling the spices would be good, maybe even a little more than double. I would definitely make these again. I substituted golden raisins for the currants.

Awesome scones!! I used all whole wheat flour and used golden raisins and baked it for 20 minutes. They are lovely :)
