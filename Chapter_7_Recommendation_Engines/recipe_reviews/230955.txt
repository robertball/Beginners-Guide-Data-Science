This is delicious just as is. I did sautee everything first for added flavor.  When finished I adjusted the seasoning to taste with just with a little salt and pepper.  I love that it's not like every other stew.  For one thing, there are no potatoes!  Hubby loved it and I'll make this again and again.

I made this last week as part of a lower-carb, gluten-free whole foods diet for myself, my boyfriend and his teenage son. HUGE hit!! Reminded us so much of pot pie filling that I have it going in the slow cooker now and have made an awesome pie crust from whole oat and millet flours. Can't wait. I'm drooling just thinking about it. :-)

Great ideas!  Looking for a way to use up 2 chicken thighs I had. Didn't have the cream cheese. Reduced the recipe for the amount of chicken and used cream of chicken soup in place of the cream cheese. Came out great. The base recipe is a bit bland, but that just leaves room to flavor it as you choose. I choose plain old salt and pepper. May think about putting in potatoes next time.

Good but a bit bland.  This is a definite repeat with a few more changes.  Made this Sunday for the family using the high setting so it was ready in 4 hours.   I omitted the mushrooms and peas at the request of the boys and doubled the carrots.  Next time I will use crinkle carrots because the chicken cooked down so much that it was almost shredded and the larger baby carrots didn't look right.   I also used frozen chopped onions instead of fresh.   I was surprised at the thickening quality of the cream cheese spread, but it didn't add enough flavor compared to how the cheese tasted alone.  Next time, I am going to add Johnny's garlic seasoning blend to up the taste and maybe Alouette Cheese spread.

I found this to be a little watery rather than as creamy as I thought it would turn out to be.  It tasted okay, and was simple to make, but I would have preferred it to be creamier.  Maybe by using a chicken cream of soup instead of chicken broth.  The cream of cheese didn't mix very well either.  I checked my amount of ingredients, and I did everything as listed.  I don't think I'll make it again.

This is a winner.  I made this for 4 adults and the entire meal was gone by the end of the evening.  Serving the stew over rice worked very well.  Tip: You may need to add some water to ensure that everything is mostly covered in the slow cooker.  Enjoy!

This was so yummy - everyone LOVED it. My revisions: I chopped up the boneless chicken thighs and tossed them in the flour, and then sauteed them in a little bit of butter and garlic before putting them in the crock pot.  My family loves a hearty stew, so I added chopped mini gold potatoes along with the vegetables in the recipe.  I mixed a can of cream of celery (I would have used cream of chicken but didn't have any in my pantry) with the chicken broth and plenty of seasonings. I poured that over the chicken and vegetables and cooked it on high for about 3-1/2 hours, then switched to low for 2 hours or so, and mixed in a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken it up when I added the frozen peas.  I omitted the cream cheese it was so flavorful without it, but I may add it next time to see the difference.  Will definitely make again!

Because I had them in my fridge, I swapped out the onion for scallions and I added some chopped zucchini.  This is a delicious crock pot stew -- fed 4 of us with leftovers and was very delicious!

I used sweet potatoes instead of the carrots.  We really enjoyed it.  Will definitely make again.  Four stars because I used sweet potatoes instead

This was super easy and delicious! My whole family loved it...... but it's NOT a stew! More like a chicken pot pie soup. The title on this is very misleading but I will definitely make this again in the near future.

To me, this stew has a sweetness to it because of the peas and carrots...a welcome change from salty\peppery stews.

This was very easy to make and really it's pretty low calorie and healthy. It is a little bland and takes a lot of salt and pepper and get the flavor. But with the limited fat that is in it I was very happy. I added a few potatoes and corn into it as well. I will definitely make this again.

Very good. I made some pasta shells with it and served it over the pasta. I also added in some zucchini instead of peas and it was very good. Top with some crispy fried onions and it's quite tasty!!

Made this tonight and switched the cooking creme flavours.  A bit watery but I thickened it a bit with flour.  Overall tastes great!

Pretty good, I loved the chicken but not so much the sauce. I think next time ill add chicken broth.
