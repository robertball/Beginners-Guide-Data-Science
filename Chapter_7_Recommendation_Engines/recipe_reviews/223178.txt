Really great recipe. Used 3/4 tbsp. garlic and found it just right (you know that kind already minced in the jar). Deep and rich flavour. Served it over toasted baguette slices (thin) Don't really think you need to change anything. But I am curious how a little wine or balsalmic would play into it. Also wondering how it would taste with a little pine nuts. Some things to try later. But, seriously, really great recipe as is.

10 STARS - Killer Recipe! I could eat this on bread, on pasta or just by the spoonful. Thanks! It's delicious! UPDATE: I did use jarred packed in oil type sun dried tomatoes.

This was delish! I spread it on some grilled baguette slices. Next time I make it, and there will be a next time, I'll use less salt. Hubby said he'd like it over some pasta so I'll give it a try! Thanks so much for this recipe!

Awesome! I made this exactly as directed, using store bought dry packed sundried tomatoes and fresh basil from my garden.  The recipe is super simple and balanced very well.  It's not overpowering on the garlic as some pesto can be.  I highly recommend this as a great topping for pasta or an alternate to sauce on pizza.

Great recipe. Doesn't require any change. Flavour is intense.Matches really well with French baguettes. I had done it for spinach & feta pita bake (from this site).The only thing like other reviewer had said I would want to know if it flavours well with pine nuts &  wine/balsamic vinegar, because it is added in this type of pesto.Without it also its fine.

Love the variety in this recipe and the colors are beautiful too!  Made a batch of this - was able to freeze in ice cube trays and have some left over for tonight's grilled pizza! Delicious!

Made again Sept 2015 - made with 3 cups of basil plus everything else.  Smells and looks amazing!  Freezing for winter use!

Oh Yum!  I was out of sun dried tomatoes, so I simply roasted some diced tomatoes and garlic and then proceeded with rest of recipe.  Bursting with freshness - simply delicious over toasted homemade baguette slices.  Oh - I did throw in a dash of balsamic vinegar.  Thank you so much for recipe.

YUM! Words of wisdom.....I questioned the whole "soak in water"....don't! You needed to do that step to full soften the tomatoes or they are too sticky. If you bought them in liquid then you can skip the soaking step. I followed the recipe, except the soak in water step, I almost killed my precious blender, because of my knowitallness but it turned out amazing and I cant stop dreaming up ways to use it.....body scrub?

This is absolutely delish!  It will be a welcome change from pizza sauce!  Only changes I made were, adding about a 1/2 TB more fresh garlic, because I so, love garlic, and about  1 and a half TB of pine nuts.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!
