Very good basic recipe. I cut the sugar in half as suggested by some other users and it was perfect. I found I had to increase the filling by half, as the amount called for was not enough to fill my pie plate sufficiently (I did not use a ready made crust, but made my own in a regular round pie plate). It was so soft, I worried it would not set up right, but after a night in the fridge, it served perfectly. I topped it with fresh halved strawberries which made it pretty and gave it a little extra something.
Oh, and P.S., there is a misprint in the recipe- most people will figure out that you need an 8 oz package of cream cheese (in my case, I needed 12 oz) NOT a 3 oz. package, as the recipe says- but just in case anyone was wondering, thought I'd mention it.

the best pie in the world!  I have made this several times now for my husband and in-laws, and they always rave about it and request it for special events.  It takes hardly any time to make, other than letting it chill overnight, which is necessary (I found out after we impatiently tried it five hours after having made it).  It is a perfect pie.  I would recommend the Oreo cookie pre-baked pie crust for this one.  Beautiful contrast in colors and flavors, and for the white chocolate drizzle on the top, I heat the last of the white chocolate squares with a lot of heavy cream to make it nice and runny, then I drizzle it over the top.  A wonderful recipe that is as appealing to the eye as it is to the palate.  Thanks so much for this gem!

I love this pie. I make it for parties all the time and it always gets eaten. I don't find it too sweet, as the cream cheese counters the sugar, but if you aren't into very sweet things you might want to cut down the sugar a bit- it'll still taste great. Another idea if you find the pie too sweet is to dilute the white chocolate mixture with a bit more cream than is called for.
The one thing you have to be careful of is the melted chocolate mixture being too warm and melting the whipped cream. If it does this don't worry, just pour it into the pie shell and leave to set. You will get a different texture this way but it will taste the same. However if this occurs you may end up overfilling your pie shell if you use all the mixture. Oh well, more mixture to eat (mwahahaha). The first time I tried this pie it made me go "wow". The flavours really work well together.

Very disappointed.  This pie was too too sweet.   Will try it again using only 1/3 cup confectioners sugar instead of 2/3 cups.  I think this recipe would work if there was less sugar.

I followed the recipe exactly as written, with one exception: I used an 8-ounce package of cream cheese, per some of the other reviews.  I used a store-bought Oreo crust, and I had some extra whipped cream, so I spread it over the top of the pies (I made two), and they came out wonderfully. One of them was all gone in about 20 minutes and the other barely lasted till lunchtime.

I wouldn't go as far as the whole "heaven and earth" thing, but this is a really good pie. It's excellent with berries and with a shot of coconut-flavored rum added.

It's a good recipe. The problem with the sweetness and odd texture is most likely due to the type of white chocolate being used. The cheaper kinds are really sweet and fake tasting. You've got to use REALLY good white chocolate when you make this, it does make a difference. Cutting down the sugar just a bit could help too.

AWESOME!! Thats the only word that can describe this! I changed it up a bit. I used white chocolate morsals and a chocolate pre made pie crust. I drizzled it all with melted morsels. However, next time around, I think I will drizzle milk chocolate on top to create a , "heavenly" contrast.  =0) Definitly try this recipe!!! You will be amazed!

I made this for Thanksgiving and something wasn't right.  The taste was very sweet, like other users said.  The pie didn't set quite right.  I think I will find another recipe.

This was amazing.  I put it in an oreo crust as others suggested and then i whipped up some extra sweetened whipped cream and spread it on the top.  It was fabulous.

This recipe was a huge hit at christmas, I used the recipe provided and only added half of the white chocolate. It made enough for two graham cracker pie crust, I used a chocolate and a regular and melted milk chocolate and put over the top. It will be my new addition to holiday dinners. It was so light and fluffy and the sweetness didn't get you until after you ate it

This wasn't good.  I love white chocolate and thought this was going to be great.  I read all the reviews thinking this was the one.  I was very disappointed.  However, I know you can't please everyone all of the time.  I usually score with allrecipes!  Thanks anyway!

Although my b/f (who does not like cream cheese) and roomate (who likes things dressed up with nuts, etc), I really thought this was a good pie.  I used slightly less than 1/3 cup of sugar though and in order to make the white chocolate actually be able to drizzle I had to add a little cream.  I found the pie very pleasing and full of white chocolate goodness all the way!  I'll definately make this one again.

My boyfriend is a while chocolate fanatic so I thought this would be perfect for him. I was right! I followed other user's suggestions and used only half the sugar. I also ended up making more than what the recipe called for in order to fill my 9 inch pie crust (I used a pre made shortbread crust and it complimented the filling perfectly). We both absolutely love this pie and I will definitely be making it again! Oh and also I couldn't get the white chocolate to melt nicely enough to drizzle over the pie, so I ended up rough chopping some white chocolate and sprinkling it over top.

This pie was absolutely delicious, and SO easy.  I ended up using half white chocolate, half 65% cacao semi-dark chocolate, and it was divine.  I'm an amateur cook, and perhaps this is just a rookie statement, but the pie was much more successful once I let it set up over night.  Still delicious before, but it was much more pie-like the next day.  GREAT recipe, very highly recommended!

This pie was very easy to make, but looked and tasted elegant and professional.  Very rich and a nice twist on basic cream pies.

Delicious! I made 3 pies for Christmas, but only used 2. So I put the one pie in the freezer and we had it last night (Feb.10th). So creamy! My daughter has celiac disease and I was able to get the chocolate crust gluten free!

Rave reviews from my guests! I speeded up setting of the filling by putting it in the freezer for 2 hours. Then I spread a layer of thickened fresh raspberry purée on top & garnished with whole raspberries. Also used 4 oz of cream cheese, but the 2/3 cup powdered sugar called for. Next time I'll cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup. The recipe calls for "1 cup whipped cream", which I interpreted as 1 cup whipping cream, whipped ( about 2.5 cups after it's whipped).
For a crust, I used Belgian almond thin cookies that I had in the cupboard, ground fine in the blender. Fabulous!

This was weird for me.. it did not taste like white choc at all and that could be from me listening to the others and using the full 8oz of cream cheese. I was looking for it to REALLY taste like white choc and this only had a hint of it. That was disappointing and I wasn't going to eat anymore but I found myself going back for another bite, then another. The filling was very light and fluffy but for me, what made the pie was the fact that I used the ready made chocolate pie crust and I melted some dark chocolate chips and drizzled that on the top of the pie... coming out of the fridge the drizzle was crunchy and it was a nice contrast with the chocolate crust to go along with the white chocolate filling. I'm going to make this again but I think next time I'm going to try it with the 3 oz cream cheese and see if I get more of the white chocolate taste. So it wasn't what I wanted but it was definitely good and worth making.
