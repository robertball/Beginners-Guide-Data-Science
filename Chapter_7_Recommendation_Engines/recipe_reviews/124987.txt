I read the reviews before trying this, and was amazed by some of the comments.  I found this recipe was amazing!  The parmesan salts the potatoes, as well as the salt in the butter.  This is an excellent recipe for a simple basic baked potato.  What I loved as well, is how easy it is to add to this recipe.  I have since added minced garlic to the butter, sometimes fresh rosemary and thyme, and have used EVOO or Walnut oil in place of the butter.  My only caveat to this recipe is twofold: real salted butter and real freshly grated parmesan (not the stuff in the green cans) are a necessity!  These both add the needed saltiness to make the cheesy buttery flavour pop!  If using margarine or unsalted butter or the parmesan from the green can, it WILL fall flat.  The only other thing I would add is that this recipe is meant as a side, and hence is at its peak with a strongly flavoured protein (marinated chicken or dry rubbed and grilled steaks) and a fresh vegetable (I used steam cauliflower once and green beans regularly).  Since the flavour is relatively simple, it compliments rather than stars on a plate.  I would not recommend this is the star of the plate, for example, for a vegetarian meal.  Cheers!

I made these to go with the pork roast I made for New Years dinner. I usually just put potatoes into the roast, but since finding this website have gotten a lot more creative. I still wanted to do a baked potato and thought this sounded great and easy too. I followed the measurements of butter and Parmesan cheese but took some of the other review advice and made a few changes of my own. I decided to add some spices. I have a pizza & pasta seasoning grinder that I use on just about everything so I sprinkled this over the entire butter mixture in the pan before adding the potatoes. I didn't have red potatoes on hand so I used Russetts instead. I sliced them in rounds about 1" thick instead of just in 1/2. I thought the exposed side up may dry out, so I baked the first 20 minutes with foil over the baking dish. When I removed the foil I turned the potatoes over so the butter would cover both sides. I also decided to add some shredded cheddar cheese in the last 5 minutes of baking. These were fantastic! Flavorful and crunchy. Even my husband who complains when I try anything different went for seconds.

cheese was good but potatoes were bland. I liked the cheese so much I changed the recipe by slicing the potatoes and layering them with the parmanesan, butter and a little rosemary. Wow it was great with the changes

Excellent side dish! I used olive oil vs. butter (about half the amount) and added a bit of rosemary to the mix for a little herb flavor. I did bake this at 425 and tossed them once during cooking. They came out crispy and delicious - perfect with grilled steak!

Awesome... served for a dinner party and they turned out PERFECTLY.  Put butter and more parmesan across the top of the potatoes about 10 minutes before they were ready to be served.

These were really tasty and my friends raved about them. I did cut them into smaller peices though. They were excellent. I also used regular potatoes instead of red potatoes

This is a wonderful and very easy recipe!! I like to add salt, fresh ground pepper, italian seasoning, garlic powder and onion poweder to the butter and cheese...it gives it more flavor and the recipe goes very nicely with numerous dishes!! My Grandpa passed it along to me, and I've passed it along to many people since!

Made them just as directed, but baked on a slightly lower temperature (350) for longer (about an hour).  They were utterly delicious.

My recipe rating is based on following the EXACT recipe. The potatoes were too  bland and it could be due to the larger size cut. Next time I will cut the potatoes into smaller pieces to absorb more of the butter & cheese. I could see the potential of it being yummier.

I expected a salty bite of fluffy potato with this recipe. I was surprised that the saltiness did not permeat the potato,  at all. So, the result was a very nice fluffy potato with a crispy *slightly* salty (yes only slightly...surprisingly)crust. The reviewer who accidently cut into smaller pieces, actually did what I would do, to improve this recipe. It really was too plain with the parm & butter only on the outside. But... I really appreciate the recipe. My creativity is sparked with all that could be done, easily,  to take these up a notch.

I did as the recipe suggested. Yes, i used the green can of parmesan cheese, and it was STILL delicious! I did add some minced garlic to the butter first, then laid it them cut side down for my little potatos. Although, once they were finished cooking, I turned them over, topped with more cheese and put in the oven for about 10 more minutes to make a crust, that definitely made them over the top. yummy!

My son's favorite!  So easy with just 3 ingredients but it's big on flavor.  I keep it kid-friendly by using the small red potatoes but any size works with a slight adjustment to cooking time.

These were delicious. I used the cheese in the green can and I think they were very tasty. I used 3 russets, cut into rounds, and kept the butter and cheese the same amount. I will definitely make these again.

This is a basic recipe that can be added upon. After cubing the potatoes, i rub them with olive oil and add them to the following:  Flour, parmesan, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, white or black pepper, and salt.  I place the incredients in a ziplock bag and shake, then bake.  My family loves it.

I was leaning toward rating this recipe as a 3, but my mom fought for the 4 rating. 

The potatoes were good, super easy to to prepare, and a nice change from baked or mashed. I did think that they were a little dry though.

I did not use red potatoes...I used Russets, so maybe that was the difference. I cut them in 1 inch thick slices, covered the pan with foil, and flipped them mid way though, uncovering them.

These were marvelous - the family suggested I give them 10 stars! Based on some other reviews, I added garlic and onion powder to the butter and cheese mix. I then baked at 350 for 60 minutes since I was also baking oven-fried chicken. We will definitely have these again. Thanks for the recipe.

I used unsalted butter, so I added a dash of salt, as well as some garlic powder because we love garlic in our house.  Everyone loved it, and it was really easy to put together.

Ok, I held back a star because if I hadn't read the reviews and made a few changes, I think the original recipe would have been bland.  I cut back a little on the butter and used a little extra Parmesan and sprinkled in garlic and onion powders.  I used baby Yukon Gold potatoes (which were so creamy and good after being baked!) sliced in half lengthwise.  Then I lightly sprayed the potatoes with Pam and sprinkled coarse Kosher salt and fresh black pepper on them.  Baked as directed and they were WONDERFUL!  Everyone was going back for seconds on these things!

Five Stars! These potatoes couldn't be easier. I have to use the red potatoes in this recipe no substitutes. They are so soft and yummy, the Parmesan cheese has that salty bite and who doesn't love butter? This recipe is simple with just three ingredients and oh so good.

This recipe has potential. If you make it exactly by the instructions it comes out bland. You have to customize it to make it really pop. Like the other reviewer mentioned, smaller pieces are better to absorb more flavor.

Very easy, very tasty. We added extra Parmesan, a bit of garlic, and a bit or dried rosemary. Next time I will probably add a bit more of each of those. I also recommend cutting the potatoes smaller so that you get more flavor packed into each bite!

I have made a similar roasted potato for years, but my recipe calls for olive oil rather than butter, so I thought I’d give this one a try.  I made 1/2 the recipe but cut the butter back to 2 T.  I changed the process just a bit by tossing the melted butter and parmesan with the potatoes and then I put them cut side down in a cast iron skillet.  I turned them after 20 minutes and baked for an additional 15 minutes. I noticed that even though I cut the butter, there was still a lot floating around in the pan – I’d cut it even further next time. These were very good, but I still prefer them made with olive oil.

Very good! Everyone loved them. I did use russets and sliced them about 1/2" thick, added italian seasoning on top of the parmesan and turned them halfway through cooking. Threw on a little cheddar cheese a few minutes before done. This is a keeper.

These were really good! The only thing I did differently was to dip the cut side in butter then put them cut side UP, rather than cut side down.  Then I sprinkled the potatoes with the parmesan cheese.  I don't understand putting the cheese on the baking dish rather than the potatoes.

I'm not sure if this is an honest 5...I normally make recipes as the recipe states to give an accurate review but this time I made some changes.  I sliced the potatoes about 1/4 in. thick, melted the butter in my 9x13, added the parmesan cheese & per other reviews, added some garlic powder & a little garlic salt.  I tossed my potatoes in & stirred them up really good to coat them and tossed them about every 10 minutes or so to ensure they were all getting covered with the butter concoction and didn't dry out (my family doesn't care for them crispy).  I was running short on time so I covered them for the last 15 minutes.  I will be trying the "original" recipe when it is just my husband & I....these just seemed to work better for my kids.  Great recipe!  Thanks so much!

I made these for our guests for dinner today and everyone loved them! It was very easy to make for company and something different than the usual potato dish. I followed the recipe as it is without the changes others suggested. I did use a basting brush to rub olive oil on the potatoes to keep them from getting dry and used russets because that's what I had. Next time I'll add more Parmesan cheese though. I made a pan and a 1/2 and there were no leftovers. We'll definitely have these again!! Thank you Ruth!

We didnt think these had any flavor except on the very bottom of the potato. Had they have been cut into smaller pieces this may have been alot better. I may make this again but instead of cutting them in half I will probably 1/4 them or cut them even smaller. When I remake them I will edit my review.

Very easy and very tasty.  I also added minced garlic to the butter, along with minced onion.  I added seasoning salt and pepper.  Next time I will add some spices, like chives or parsley for added flavor.  Will make again.

I thought these were good.  Only change I made was to add 3 cloves of minced garlic to infuse with the melted butter.  I used the small baby red potatoes and doubled the parmesan......yum.

Very Easy!  they were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I shortened the cooking time by microwaving my potatoes first but not all the way (about 1/2 way done) and then put them in the oven with pork chops that were already cooking at 375 degrees for about 30 min. or until tender.

As written my family and I didn't care for this recipe.  I used a good quality paremsan cheese but still the potatoes were rather tasteless.  I think as some of the other reviewers have suggested, it could improved upon with some additional seasoning and rubbing some olive oil on the potato skins

I really hate to disagree with almost everyone on this recipe,however heres what happened when I followed the recipe exactly.  The parmesan was mostly stuck to the pan, not the potatoes and the flavor was just not that geat.

These potatoes are great! I have made them a number of times and each and every time they have turned out picture perfect. My husband even said that they looked so professional that he could picture them on a fancy plate at a nice resturant. I have also sprinkled with a few bacon bits and a dollop of sour cream, and they were fantastic!!

These potatoes are fabulous, easy, and something that you would expect in a fine resturant. I made exacly are suggested except I did not have red potatoes so I used small russets. I took one reviewer's advice and lightly sprinkled crushed rosemary on the melted butter. I sevred this with steak at a dinner party and had rave reviews even from the picky eaters.

I had chopped my red potatoes up like I always do in little bites when I realized I had not done it the way the recipe called for. So I melted the butter in a bowl and mixed in the fresh grated cheese and chopped potatoes, did add a wee bit of garlic powder and some fresh chopped oregano from the garden, since it was going with an Italian dish. Spread in an even layer on a stoneware sheet baking pan on grill (Just don't ever put cold stuff on baking stone, must be room temp) and they turned out wonderful. Everyone raved about them. This is a keeper.

I prepared this the same way another reviewer did by stirring the potatoes occasionally so the cheese didn't 'crisp-ify' excessively.  I also added extra cheese to the recipe.  Quite tasty, and very popular for the 10 people present, including kids.

These were okay.  Everyone seemed to really enjoy them except for me.  I thought they were a little bland, and the cheese didn't quite burn on the bottom, but it came very close to it.  I'll try these one more time and move them up a rack in the oven.

This is a great recipe I have made many times now.  Even better with some changes/additions.  I like it better with Romano cheese or even half romano/half parmesan. I also use much more than 3 tablespoons - just eyeing it.  Romano gives the potatoes the salt they need, and is a very flavorful cheese.  I also just use russet potatoes, but cut them into smaller pieces so they absorb more of the butter cheese flavors.  Add some fresh rosemary on top of the cheese and butter and again on top of the potatoes...sooo good!

These were good and easy to make.  I made a few changes and sliced the potatoes and put them in layers with olive oil and romano cheese (that's what I had).  Baked at 375 for 40 minutes and 400 for the remaining 15 minutes.  They were crispy on the cut sides and soft in the middle.

This was pretty good.  It was good way to serve potatoes when you are looking for a different way to serve them.  I think it needs pepper or something else to give it more flavor though.

Amazing!  Easy!  My kids loved it and my husband loved it!  I made one revision after trying it with 6 tablespoons of butter.  I reduced the butter to 3 tbsp and liked the results better because it created a crispier coating.

***** Didn't have anything but russet potatoes, so sliced them medium, put them on a base of garlic  butter with parmesan cheese and brushed some of the mixture on top of the potatoes. A little crisp and wonderful!

Very good. Don't forget to grease the pan. My potatoes got stuck. I also cut my potatoes into smaller slices. I added a little bit of garlic powder, too. I wouldn't leave them in so long next time.

Delicious and so simple. I put the butter, parmeson cheese and some minced garlic in the bottom of the dish. Halfway through baking, I sprinkled a little more garlic after I'd flipped the potatoes. Because I was baking something else at the same time (Best Chicken Ever from this site), I had to alter the cooking temperature and time. I cooked these at 350 degrees for 55 minutes and they came out perfect -- better, in fact, than the first time I made them following the exact cooking temp/time.

Excellent!  The key is to use real butter and high-quality Parmesan cheese (not the cheap canned kind, which is less flavorful.) If you do this it will not be bland.  Made a few times; the second time I added garlic, which was wonderful tasting. Made with slow cooker pot roast and also as a side to oven fried chicken. Received many compliments.

Super-easy, fast and delicious! Follow the directions exactly and you will have a mighty fine potato side dish with zero effort. One note...I have tried this in the past with potatoes, other than baby red potatoes, and was very dissapointed...IMO - stick with the reds!

Wow!  These were soooo good and so very easy.  I used russets and they came out great.  Don't use cheap parmesan - the good stuff makes the dish (not "blah" at all).  Works great as an appetizer too.  People just scarf them up.  Thanks, Ruth!

These were really good--but "blah" if you use the recipe without adaptation.  Even my husband, who "hates" baked potatoes" loved them.  I rubbed the skins with olive oil and sea salt first, used only a small amount of butter for taste and olive oil to replace the rest, and along with the parmesan cheese, used minced onion, garlic, rosemary and cracked black pepper for seasoning.  If more seasonings were in the original recipe, I would be rating this a 5 star.

These are really easy and incredibly delicious!  The only addition I made was to brush the tops (skins) with melted butter and sprinkle on a little garlic salt.

bland and the family didn't like it. My husband joked & said I ruined a good potato. We just like a little POW to our meals. I am going to try it again but add red pepper, parsley flakes, garlic & onion powder and paparika. So for us it was a good starter recipe. Thanks

These were awesome!  Only thing I did differently was add sprigs of rosemary and sage while the potatoes baked.  These were also wonderful leftover, sliced into wedges and reheated in a bit of olive oil on the stove.

I really loved the idea of this recipe. My tweaks consisted of cutting the butter back to 3 tablespoons and making up the rest of the amount with extra light olive oil, using more than 3 tbls of pecorino romano, using 1/2 inch rounds of regular russet potatoes (washed but not peeled), and sprinkling the top with salt, pepper, dried thyme, and slices of onion before I baked it. This is definitely going in my file for recipes that can be varied endlessly. Thanks.

Delicious!  The only thing I might do differently would be to chop the potatoes into cubes, then drizzle the butter and cheese and other spices over them so you get more of the crispy cheese crust.  The leftovers also make terrific home fries for breakfast!

These potatoes are fantastic just as written. I originally found this recipe in a TOH cookbook, and have been making it for a couple years now. I love them just as written, and have also put some garlic powder in with the butter and parm, and that's delicious too!

This were good, how can one not like butter and cheese? My son loved them, which is saying a lot, he's the picky eater of the family. I think it needed something more. I think next time I'll add minced garlic into the butter. Will make again!

This one was actually pretty difficult for me to make. It was simple following the directions, but the results were far from what everyone else received. Still tasted great, and I will definitely try it again. I recommend everyone else take a shot at it as well. (NOTE- I used 'white creamer' potatoes, which may be why I had strange results, but people said it tasted fine)

Nothing special about these we found. No compliments but no complaints either. Okay for a fairly quick or simple potato side dish. Need more seasoning/cheese in our opinion.

This was a good recipe, the first time I made it, I used to a little to much parmesan and not enough butter.  I made it closer to the recipe tonight (still a little more parmesan) and it turned out very good.  Not quite a 5, but still a nice change of pace for a side dish.

Having suddenly realized that I was out of parmesan cheese, I used romano cheese, and it turned out wonderfully! I also added salt and fresh cracked pepper.  Also, I flipped the potatoes over, added a bit more cheese and continued cooking them for about 10 additional minutes. My husband raved about these potatoes!

These are delicious and SO simple!!  I was worried that no seasonings would make for bland potatoes, but these were fantastic.  My husband couldn't stop raving about them.  I did add much more cheese (didn't measure, just shook it in) than the recipe called for though.  These potatoes are now in out top favorite recipes.

I cannot give this recipe rave reviews. It was just okay for me.  I could not really taste the cheese.  I added more fresh parm to the top of the potatoes after baking.  I did use olive oil instead of butter.  I never use butter much so am used to the taste of olive oil.  I do not know if using olive oil changed the taste or if I did cooked them to long but I probably will not make this again.  Sorry and thanks anyway.

Such an easy recipe! Very tasty, and it looks pretty, too. I admit I used more parmesan than the recipe called for. I laid the cut side of the potato in the melted butter and then laid it in the cheese, using what was needed to cover the face of the potato.

I thought this was just ok, but my husband thought they were good.  I thought they were a little dry, which is funny with all the butter in it.

I made these this past weekend and they were a huge hit with both my husband and son who are very picky eaters.  I read the reviews and cut the potatoes into slices, added some fresh garlic, and rosemary.  They were wonderful and so easy to make!

These are very good! The only changes I make are to use a whole stick of butter, add some garlic powder and seasoned salt to the butter/parm mixture and scoring the potatoes so all the flavors soak in-YUMMY! Also, depending on the size of the potatoes, I can't always fit them all in the pan, so I just put in whatever fits. Thanks for sharing. :)

I grew up eating something very similar to this, adding some garlic powder, fresh black pepper, and cayenne to taste.  We just mixed it all together in the baking dish.  Fabulous!

Very easy.  My changes:  melted the butter in the casserole dish (to cut down on number of dishes to wash), added salt+pepper, actually tossed uncut mini potatoes (to cut down on chopping) in the mixture, and topped with more sprinkled parmesan.

This recipe turned out great, though after reading through the comments, I agree that it sounds bland.  Instead of adding just Parmesan cheese, I used a Garlic Romano mix (Romano, Garlic Powder, Parsley, Parmesan)  that I get from Soulard Spice Shop and some Rosemary.  Fantastic!

I made these and they were delicious! My husband loved them and asked for another batch. However I only gave them four stars as they are SMOTHERED in butter and cannot be even remotely healthy for you. I will definitely make these again but it will be a time in which I am not watching our calorie intake. Thanks for the recipe!

These potatoes are a hit every time I make them. I use white potatoes instead of red and I sprinkle a little garlic salt on them before putting in the oven. Yum!

These potatoes were really good, but I added some more spices to it, which is the reason for only 4 stars.  I used 8 tbsp of butter, and russet potates instead of red. I also added some onion salt, garlic powder and italian seasoning. They turned out tender and flavorful.

For some reason when I make this dish it's hit or miss.  Sometimes they turn out so tasty with a toasted Parmesan crust on the bottom of the potatoes.  Other times the cheese doesn't stick, and the potatoes are bland.  Don't know why...but when it does turn out well they are WONDERFUL!

I tried this tonight. I didn't have red potatoes so I used a single large russet baker halved and cubed. I wasn't to excited about it because it was quite dry, but will try it again with red potatoes to see if it is moister than with the russet. Next time I may put some foil over the dish and then crisp it up under the broiler to finish it.

Definitely give 5 stars- used small regular potatoes- but... there were no spices!! So after reading reviews I decided to do my own thing- I sprinkled potatoes with "Tony Chacheres" cajun seasoning- Yummmm....  Would have been good with just garlic, salt, and pepper too...

Wow, these were good!  My changes: I spread some butter (well, margarine) on the baking dish rather than wait for it to melt; I also added additional seasonings such as salt, pepper, garlic powder, and rosemary.  I left the potatoes in the oven while I was waiting for my main course to finish and I technically cooked them a little too long; they came out crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside.  My husband and I thought they were great this way, though.  Simple, easy, and delicious.

I used Idaho potatoes sliced very thickly. Insead of putting the cheese/butter mixture in the bottom of the pan, I will toss the potatoes in the mixture and put in the pan. Also, more potatoes are needed to distibute the sauce so they aren't so greasy. With these changes, I think it will be a 5 star dish!

This is a good basic recipe. Quick and easy!! I used 2 large Idaho bakers. I cut them into about 2" pieces. Instead of butter I drizzled the potatoes in Olive oil. I didn't have parmesan but I did have some really good Romano Cheese. I used much more cheese than called for as I like the flavor. I also spiced it up a little with garlic powder, minced onion, salt and fresh cracked pepper. I baked them at 400 for about 45 minutes. I stirred them once during baking. They were really tasty.

Delicious! Didn't change a thing, except I cut the potatoes smaller (4-6 pieces per potato). Everyone loved them. Best part...sooooo easy.

WOW! DELICIOUS! The only change I made was to add a little rosemary, thyme and "pizza grinder" to the butter and cheese. I've made this several times using whatever kind of potatoes I had on hand and each time they were great. By request, I've shared your recipe with several friends. Thanks for sharing your recipe with all of us.

This is a GREAT recipe! I had no idea what to do with potatoes for dinner tonight and was running out of time.  I got on this site to find something tasty and quick when I found this.  I had all the ingredients on hand and threw this together quick.  The taste was GREAT.  I used regular ol' parmesan cheese in the green can and added garlic.  It was SO good.  My kids ended up eating them with their hands and dipping them in ketchup like skins.  I will definately stick this into my regular rotation.  YUM!

I put some sort of condiment on everything! And this is no overexageration! But with this recipie  was absolutly perfect and I ate them with out anything on them! Did sprinkle with johny's seasoning salt before puting them in the oven. Then fliped them over half way through the cooking time. This is my new fave!

This was a very good recipe.  To make it a little healthier, I reduced the butter and added Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  This recipe would be very easy to embellish with garlic and herbs.  I will definitely make this again!

What a pleasant surprise, something so easy to make comes out so tasty.  Taking advice from others I spiced things up a bit with some onion powder, garlic, parsley and pepper and salt.  An easy side dish to go with most anything.

I like the simplicity of this recipe, but, it definitely needed some extra seasoning. I added salt and some Mrs. Dash on top of the grated parmesan before I added the potatoes. It was pretty yummy, and easier than pie!

Ok as is.  DH wouldn't eat them the first time around because he said they were bland.  I modified it to save the potatoes and add flavor.  I used about 3/4 to 1 c freshly grated parm cheese.  I also added grill seasoning, salt, pepper, thyme, garlic powder, and onion powder. So flavorful and saved the dish.

They were easy to make.  The family thought these were great.  We are all cheese lovers so also added more cheese.  Also found that we needed to lengthen the cooking time.

I've made these a few times and they are great! I always add some seasoning to the the butter and parmesean mixture like some cajun seasoning and garlic pepper. I always throw something extra in! Great recipe! Always a hit!

Yummy recipe - super simple. I live in Brazil so can't find these potatoes.  I used regular and it worked just fine.

These have become an instant classic in our family. It doesn't really matter what kind of potatoes I use; they come out great every time. I did make thick slices as opposed to just cutting them in half, and I turn the slices partway through baking. Then I treat that side with the same goodies as the first side. Makes it extra yummy, I think. Heck, we even like these things cold. I do think they get better the second day (if you can manage to have any left over, that is).

Thses are very, very yummy. I bake them in the toaster oven and use small red and blue potato slices. I sprinkle extra cheese on top before cooking too.

Delicious!  I added way more butter and cheese than called for, and also brushed the skins with olive oil and salt as another reviewer suggested.  The results were soooo good!  For medium sized red potatoes 40 minutes was perfect.

Really nice addition my side dish repertoire. Very easy to make and nice flavor. I had about 2T of parmesan cheese remaining after I put it in the baking dish, so I sprinkled the remainder on top of the potatoes. Very yummy!

Thank you for giving me a base recipe.  I put melted butter, parmesan cheese and garlic powder.  Pre-cooked the potatoes in the microwave then sliced and tossed with butter mix, baked at 375 for 30 min.  Hubby said they were excellent.

This recipe was excellent.  A big hit with company.  A few pototoes were a little thicker so i sliced those again so in turn I coated those with a little olive oil.  I also used a little pepper.  I did not think this recipe was bland like others have said.
I definately will make this again!

sooooo good. everyone loved this recipe. i think next time i will use small red potatos (halved) instead of the medium size, that way i can have more of the parm/butter crust in every bite. Great recipe!!!

Simple easy and quick.  But not much flavor.  Probably won't make again.  If I did I might add some garlic and parsley.  Thanks anyway.  Always nice to try new potato recipes.

Sliced and layered the potatoes but needed to be cooked longer, 45-50 minutes and stirred halfway through. I also added the rosemary which is a wonderful touch. Everyone enjoyed these. Maybe try broiling the last couple of minutes to crisp the top layer.

I think I put too much butter.  They were good, but I wished they were crispier.

A simple way to jazz up baked potatoes. I made them for company and everyone loved them. Great with sour cream.

These were really, really easy to make and tasted great!  I used others suggestions and flavored the butter/parmesan mix with some salt and pepper, as well as some dried parsley flakes.  The potatoes had good flavor and the parmesan gave them a bit of a crunch on the one side.  I even made them for my parents first dinner at my husband and I's new place and they were a hit.  Thanks!

The cut face got rather hard and "shiny" - it became kind of a shell with potato inside.  I also thought these would be more flavorful.  I would have seasoned the butter had I known.  I dipped mine in ranch dressing.  Family ate them and said they were a nice treat, though, so they get a 3 instead of a 1 or 2.
