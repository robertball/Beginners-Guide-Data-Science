I must say this was different and interesting. I happened to love  cantalope and gin and the 2 went well with eachother. It had an interesting twist to it. Thanks and i will make it again.

I like cantaloupe and I like gin, but this drink didn't do it for me.  A bit too plain I think.

I reduced the sugar, but added half a can of 7Up to the mixture.  It diluted the strength of the gin, and blended the flavors much better than originally written.

Good for a summer bar-be-que!

Try adding some frozen lemonade or limeade concentrate...you'll love the slight tartness that it adds.

We used vodka, because I hate gin (or at least I hear I do).  Add Orange juice and a little pinch of cinnamon!  I serve it now at work, bartending.

Not terribly good. It wasn't sweet enough so I threw in some Splenda. I ended up topping it off with mandarin-flavored sparkling water; this was quite nice, but not something I would want again. Thanks anyway.

Gin lovers BEWARE!  This was absolutely awful.  I used the sweetest cantaloupe I've ever had and it still was bitter.  "If only I had listened to other reviewers!"  Live and learn I guess.
