To make the recipe a little easier I used a small bag of broccoli coleslaw and a regular sized bag of standard coleslaw. I also halved the sauce so that my salad would not be drenched in it.

Spent a long time cutting up veggies only to have everyone give it the thumbs down.  Sorry, too strong with the spicing...couldn't taste the veggies which is a shame when you cut them all up.  May try it again and cut down on the spices so that some veggie flavour comes through.

The seasonings were a bit much...next time I will only use 1/4 teaspoon of each seasoning and eliminate the rosemary seasoning all together.  I used bagged oriental slaw and mixed vegetables to save time and add convenience.  I will make this again, just with the changes previously mentioned.

Too heavy on the olive oil, it overwhelmed the taste. Next time I'll use half as much. Could also use a touch of sugar.
