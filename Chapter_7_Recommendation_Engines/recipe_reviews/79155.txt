Came out great, I followed recipe exactly except for the butter (I used "can't believe it's not butter" instead). It was getting picked off the tray before I could even put the chocolate on it!

These cookies are AMAZING!!! Seriously. If you are looking for the ultimate Christmas cookie these are SO perfect. This recipe has become a Xmas cookie favorite in our home; I just made it for the third time. The flavors of orange and chocolate and 'nuttiness' are comforting and classy.
Some things I've adjusted: 
-I sometimes roll them into 'fingers' and then dip them, kinda fun for presentation. 
- I always have issues with using the chocolate chips and reccomend quliaty semi-sweet or dark baking chocolate instead.
- Toast the pecans first for a richer flavour
- Squish the dough balls down, they're better if they're a wee bit thinner
- A add a bit of orange zest right into the melted chocolate, and a splash of orange liquor into the dough
Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

Yum Yum Yum.  I used Grand Marnier instead of the orange juice, but they still came out amazing.  
Mine didn't spread at all, so you might need to "flatten" them a bit if you don't want a ball-shaped cookie.  
Whatever the shape, though, these cookies are awesome!

I find these cookies to be a big hit with grown ups, not so much with the kids. They are great with coffee or tea, not overly sweet, and look nice on a christmas cookie tray. I like them for breakfast, but don't tell!

I always like to try new cookie recipes for Christmas.  This one was excellent.  Orange chocolate is a favorite in my hometown of Buffalo, NY, so I knew I would love these.  The flavors blend so well and the pecans add another dimension.  I will make these again and have been asked by a co-worker for the recipe.

Very good! Followed the recipe exactly except for the orange zest, so they could even have a stronger orange flavor than mine did, which I think would only be better. The contrast of the pecan crumble cookie and the chocolate coating (I only coated half the cookie) turned out very well!

I was't crazy about these... Too much work for an OK result.

These are very nice cookies for Christmas.  I made them into a crescent shape and dipped half in the chocolate.  I used orange liqueur as well and added a bit to the chocolate.  This was a mistake as it turned the chocolate hard.  I added some oil and that thinned it out again and I was able to use.

This recipes is basically a Russian Tea Cake with an orange twist.  I will not make again.  My Russian Tea cakes are so much better than this recipe. Very little orange flavor.  It needed a whole cup of butter and a lot more orange....in the garbage they go and out comes my old recipe!

The texture of these was like play dough. Maybe something is wrong with the directions. Seems like not enough sugar and/or lacking a leavening agent.

I even chilled my dough and it was extremely sticky -impossible to roll balls.  I also tasted the dough and it was barely sweet.  I added 1/2 - 3/4 cup more powdered sugar, but they still came out flat and dough was sticky.  I was careful measuring everything.  Taste is better with the additional powdered sugar and I added more zest, but  may as well make drop cookies, not balls, because they will flatten and spread regardless.  Can't taste the pecans, chocolate is overpowering - kind of a waste of expensive pecans.  I was hoping for a better looking cookie for the holidays.  All-in-all, meh.

This recipe is super easy and everyone that had one of these cookies raved about it. They look really nice and even with the chocolate they are not overly sweet. I'll definitely be making these again before the holiday is over!

These are very tasty. I used dark chocolate instead of semi-sweet, which I think went very well with the orange flavor.
