Made twice the sauce to use as a marinade and to brush on as grilling.
EXCELLENT flavor - was worried might be too much horseradish, but did use the full amount and it was the perfect blend of flavors!

Phenominal! This marinade is amazingly yummy and went well with a southwestern rice pilaf I threw together. We added a bit of worcester sauce and extra garlic to the marinade as well, and this really rounded out the flavor. I HIGHLY recommend this recipe.

Waaaaaay easy and super delicious.  All I heard from DH was mmm...mmm....mmm the whole time he was eating it.  I don't eat red meat so I am never sure what to put on it...this was completely awesome and so easy.  Thank you for sharing.  When I was mixing this up...DH was in the living room and could smell it...and was already commenting on how good it smelled. :)

we love this so much. we never ate steak on a regular basis before and now we're actually having it once a week. This is a great recipe. The only thing we changed is that we got HP bold steak sauce instead of A1....

The smells coming off the grill were amazing when I made this simple recipe. However, I did not make enough sauce for the 4 12oz ribeyes I had, so the flavors of the sauce were barely noticable on the steaks. Next time I will make more sauce and give the steaks a thicker coat. I will definately try this one again!

Made a good steak.  I think I will reduce the cumin next time.  I would like to taste more of the A1.

This has worked well for us.  I've used more horseradish, and varied between garlic powder and minced garlic.  There are alot of ways to go with this as a base, and it kept the meat more moist and tender.
