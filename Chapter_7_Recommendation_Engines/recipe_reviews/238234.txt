The lime really brings a nice tartness to the dressing.  I would have preferred a thicker dressing, so it would have coated the salad and noodles better.  It was very watery, and just fell to the bottom of the plate. I didn’t have any rice noodles, and accidentally cooked fettucine instead of linguini, so the noodles were a little fatter than they should have been.  That could have accounted for the fact that I thought there was an awful lot of noodles in relation to the salad.  I mixed up the dressing, tasted, and added more Sriracha, since we wanted it a little spicier.  I did all the prep work in the morning.  I marinated the shrimp, grilled it, and then into the fridge.  Mixed up the dressing, chopped and sliced all of the veggies, and into the fridge.  Right before dinner, I assembled the salad for an easy evening dinner with an easy clean-up.  I wouldn’t add the dressing until you’re ready to eat, or you’ll have a soggy salad.   This was good, but there are a lot of ingredients and a lot of chopping and slicing.  Wouldn’t say it’s my favorite Asian noodle salad recipe on this site, but we enjoyed it.

This salad is delicious!  (Our five yr old even liked it!)  We skipped the bean sprouts and basil because I didn't have any on hand, and added a bit more cabbage to make up for it.  I used leftover boiled shrimp.  This is a a very versatile dish!

This dressing is amazing.  I made extra and added it to my serving at the table. This salad is very versatile and i have used the same dressing on my own variations of this salad. Tuna instead of shrimp, red cabbage instead of nappa, shredded brocolli stems, etc.

Very good. I used olive oil in place of water in the dressing; bagged coleslaw mix in place of Napa cabbage, cooked pork tenderloin in place of shrimp, regular cucumber in place of English cucumber, and cashews in place of peanuts in the salad. I initially rated four stars...but given that I didn't have any of the fresh herbs...and subbed the veggies...I'm sure that this salad would easily be five stars with fresh herbs and the specified veggies. Notes...#1 Follow the directions on the box for cooking the noodles. #2 As I'm cooking for one and knew I wud have leftovers, I sprinkled the noodles, and the pork, with the dressing before assembling my salad at dinnertime and putting the leftover of both into the fridge for the next night, so I did make more dressing the next night. #3 I mixed the full amount of carrots and cabbage for my leftovers, but added the green onions and cucumbers at serving #4 I'll prolly increase the green onion next time...and might put a layer of salad greens or just plain iceberg under. Thank you for sharing your wonderful recipe! PS: Also didn't use bean sprouts...haven't been available around here, at least not on a regular basis, since the contamination scare a few years ago.

This salad has great fresh flavors that work so well together.  I marinated shrimp for a few minutes in lime juice and sambal oelek before barbecuing.  This one is a keeper.

This was excellent! Great combination of ingredients and flavors. I used close to a Tablespoon of ginger but only because I love it and  used 4 Tablespoons of cilantro and basil each but left out the mint. This is a great salad and is ideal to make with leftover grilled proteins. Can't wait to try this next with leftover grilled Salmon and leftover grilled chicken. Thanks Ann for sharing your recipe, it's wonderful!

My husband gave this salad five stars ... And he is not an easy grader!  The rice noodles could have been cooked a little more.  I left out the bean sprouts and used a regular cucumber.  Full of flavor.  I sautéed medium sized thawed frozen shrimp instead of grilling.  I had someone ask for the recipe which is always a good sign.

This "Saigon Noodle Salad" turned out great! I subbed a tiny amount of palm sugar for the specified brown sugar, and added some VIRGIN COLD-PRESSED (flavorful) peanut oil to the dressing (probably not authentic Thai: I get that from the Chinese store). I wish I had of thought to make the dressing in advance as I had four bowls soaking taking up a lot of space: the fresh herbs from the Farmer's Market  to clean and "freshen" them (3 bowls); and beans sprouts in water and vinegar to get the "earthy flavor" off them (1 bowl). Thank you AnnInLondon for sharing your recipe. UPDATE: The dressing on the noodles becomes more delicious with time. I might be inclined to make the "noodle and dressing" part of the salad in advance next time.

Pretty good! I used chili flakes instead of sriracha. I will probably use rice vinegar next time, instead of lime juice, and likely will cut back the sugar. I used some leftover grilled chicken that had been marinated in yogurt and cumin, worked fine. I wasn't a big fan of the mint and will likely leave that out next time.

Made nearly as written (didn't have fish sauce or sriracha), subbed Worcestershire and soy sauce and used habanero sauce and red pepper flakes instead.  We really liked the lightness of the salad, a good one for a hot summer day.  Also, eating clean and light helps avoid that terrible feeling of overeating after a meal.  Now, where's that pie?

Excellent recipe except for the added sugar! It is not necessary. If you want, you can use 1 teaspoon of honey instead.

I followed the recipe as written. I really liked the herbs mixed in with the cabbage and carrots. The dressing did have flavor,  but could have maybe stuck to the greens and noodles better, or maybe a little stronger flavor or something. It kind of lacked in that department.  I'll definitely try this recipe again, but with some tweaks.

A lot of fuss which I don't normally mind but found that the meal ended up being rather ordinary.
