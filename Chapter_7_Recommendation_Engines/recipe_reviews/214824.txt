Ok, my review is on one change.  Instead of fresh basil, I sprinkled on dried basil.  This was real simple, but I thought this was just ok, nothing special.  A bit salty for me I think due to the combo of the prosciutto and adobo seasoning.  If I make this again I would probably lower the amount of the adobo seasoning.

used grouper instead of halibut... it was very good. used chili powder instead of adobe seasoning. fish was a little bland but probably just needed a little more seasoning. will make again though.

I thought the fish was bland. I would make again but season the fish and cook it entirely on the stove top in oil and garlic.

This was quick, easy and tasted pretty good. I can't say that it was an amazing dish, though, and I'm not sure if I'd make it again over a different halibut recipe. I didn't measure my adobo seasoning, but I have to assume I used less than called for. I just sprinkled both sides lightly. The fish was well-cooked using the suggested times. My presentation was a little sloppy because I put the skin side up instead of down -- make sure you put the pretty side down  on top of the basil leaves before you wrap the prosciutto around the fish.

I followed the recipe & made my own adobo seasoning. I was impressed with how easy this was to make & wrap. I love prosciutto & fresh basil, so this was a win for me.
