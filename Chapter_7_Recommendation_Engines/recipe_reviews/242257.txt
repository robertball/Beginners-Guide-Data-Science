I tried it both with and without the cream and prefer it without the cream; it has more flavor without the cream. I rimmed the glass with a lime and dipped the glass in sugar which offset the sour of the drink nicely. I cut the vanilla vodka in half and added lime vodka to make up the difference since I did not have sweetened lime juice.
