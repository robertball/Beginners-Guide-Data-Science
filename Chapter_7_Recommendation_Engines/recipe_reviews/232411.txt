This is Cheerios first published recipe here. He later made at least 4 other versions of his lunch box cookies which greatly improved. Check out his favorites! As written this needs some vanilla and possibly cinnamon or nutmeg if you like a little more flavour. I used a porridge oat blend for the oats and cereal called for. These are dense, biscuit like cookie which is partly to do with all the baking powder. I think you can eliminate all the baking powder in this cookie unless you like that biscuit taste. My kids loved them and have been eating them in their lunchbox all week! Thanks for sharing all your cookies with us over the years here Cheerios!

This recipe produces a lofty, cake-like cookie that has a nice nutty flavour. They go great with a cup of tea or glass of milk. All in all, a very satisfying cookie. Cheerios is the best.
