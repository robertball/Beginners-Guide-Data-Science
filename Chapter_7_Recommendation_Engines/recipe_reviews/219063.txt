This was my breakfast this morning. I loved it. SO good. Instead of stevia powder, I drizzled honey over the top. YUM.

This message to Ursula and anyone concerned about health risks of artificial sweeteners...stevia is does NOT contain aspartame. It is an all natural plant extract and is actually a food supliment. This recipe looks simple and yummy. Think I may try it using cream cheese for an apple dip.

We had this for breakfast today with apple slices and a mini cinnamon-raisin bagel with pumpkin butter.  Used Truvia instead of stevia, and we ate it as an apple dip.  Very nice.

I made this for breakfast this morning, I put all the ingredients together without the apple and tried it. At first my thought was “it’s okay”, then I added the apple and it made a world of difference. It’s so delicious! Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely be making this again : )

I loved this protein packed, easy-to-fix breakfast! I used non-fat Greek yogurt.

So fast to make, so yummy.  Tasted like a creamy apple pie.  I mixed everything inside the yogurt cup (I used activia yogurt).  Who needs high calorie apple pie when you can have this instead.
