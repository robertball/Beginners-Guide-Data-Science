This turned out great--my husband loved it for his lunch. I cut the recipe in half but still used a whole can of beans. I added some cumin and cayenne pepper to make it more chili like. I didn't have the veggies called for, so I used a bag of frozen Mexican style veggies that included corn, broccoli, cauliflower and red pepper. Quick and tasty--thanks for the recipe!

Group of 8 LOVED this recipe. I did not make any changes to the recipe except that I doubled the ingredients.
