I played with this recipe a little and it was just perfect! I also used a can of ready cut tomatoes and a can of ortega diced green chilis instead of jalapenos it was mild with perfect flavor.  Also, the next time I make it I will use minute rice instead of regular rice as it took forever for the rice to cook.  I then added about a 3/4 cup of enchilada sauce to give it a little extra kick and mixed in a blend of shredded cheeses and topped it off with more cheese on top.  It really was incredibly easy, fast and fantastic my family really loved it even the picky eaters.  This will be a regular on the menu at our home.  Thanks for the wonderful, fast and easy recipe!

This is called "Easy" for a reason, and I'm sure the original, easy recipe tastes fine. The Rotel gives a great twist on an old stand-by dish. As reviewers suggested, I chose to add 1/2 c. sour cream, Italian seasoning, (heavy) garlic, dried onion, and 1/2 c. rice. For my own taste, also celery salt, seasoning salt, 3 stalks celery, mushrooms, 1/4 c. chicken broth, and a bunch of broccoli (to make a full meal from the dish). The Rotel was a great idea, and will be in all of my chicken/rice dishes from now on! Thanks!

I really enjoyed this! I added an extra 1/2 cup of instant rice, 1/4 chicken broth, and by accident i added a small can of green chilis! I dont think it is too spicy, but then again, I do like spicy food! :O) I cooked for an hour and it didnt come out mushy at all. After I took it out of the oven, I sprinkled some cheddar and monterrey jack cheese on top and recovered it with the foil so the cheese could melt. I also had a fresh jalepeno from the garden I added, gave it an extra kick! This is a definite favorite on my list. Will make again! Good job!  :O)

Very easy and quite tasty. I used 98% fat-free soup and brown rice, which added 7-8 minutes to the cooking time.

Great EASY recipe!  I did add 1/2 cup of fat-free sour cream and topped with shredded monteray jack cheese for the last five minutes of baking.  I used Basmati rice and it was done to perfection after one hour of baking.  I will definitely make this again.

This is a great recipe, but I found if you add 1/2 c of sour cream with the soup and 1 c of grated monterey jack cheese or montery jack pepper cheese on top you get alot more flavor.

I really didn't think this was going to be a 5 ***** recipe, but alas my husband and I were both surprised.  I didn't even have tomatos with chilis, just plain tomatos.  I added a can of green beans and a small can of mushrooms. An extra 1/2 cup of rice and one cup water, and a little onion soup mix (about 1/3 of a pack).  It was soo good and easy.  Great recipe!!  Thanks!

so simple and easy and very delicious! I didn't have a regular can of tomatoes so instead I used a can of Rotel tomatoes with Jalapenos and half a can of Rotel with cilantro to equal the size of a regular 14.5 oz can. Amazing! I had to cook mine a bit longer (1 hour) but very worth it! Family loved it! What an easy dish to prepare after work! Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was delicious!  The tomatoes and chilis added just the right amount of punch to what can be a pretty bland dish.  Best of all, it passed my husbands taste test with flying colors!  I did brown the chicken breasts before placing in the baking dish, and I used basmati rice, which has a flavor all of it's own.  I also had to bake it about an hour before the rice was cooked, otherwise, I followed the recipe as written, with great results.

This was an extremely quick recipe to make.  I did brown my chicken prior to cooking it though.  I also added about 1/2 cup of water to the soup, rice mixture.
The taste was good too!

I don't understand how someone can change the recipe then give it a bad rating ... I made it as is and it was great!  I was sick and was looking for something quick and easy that would satisfy the family and this is definitely it!  It's definitely going on the list of things for regular family dinners!  I'll be looking to see what else this person has to offer!

This recipe is about as easy as it comes!  I followed the recipe almost to the T but I used brown rice instead so I cooked it a little longer and for some reason the rice did not cook!  Am I doing something wrong when it comes to rice?

I read the reviews, and used instant rice (added 1/2 extra cup), added 1/2 cup sour cream, a small can of chilis. and 1/2 cup of chicken broth. Melt a little cheese on top, and you have a winner! It was absolutely wonderful!!

I made this last night and both my boyfriend and I really liked it.  I took the suggestions of a few reviewers, and added a little bit of chicken broth as well as a can of drained black beans.  I used the diced tomatoes with jalepenos and added some taco seasoning, instead of salt and pepper.  It was plenty spicy.  About 25 minutes into cooking, I stirred it up a little, just to make sure all of the rice was getting enough liquid and added a dash more of chicken broth.  The chicken was very tender, and the rice was a little mushy, but that's how I like it.  I will make this again.

Followed this recipe mostly by the book and was pretty happy with the results.  My only complaint was that it was kind of bland - even with the chili's.  Some Cajun seasoning or Cayanne pepper may help spice it up in the future.

Very simple to make & very tasty!  Didn't have tomatoes with chilies so just used diced tomatoes & a small can of green chilies.  Took others' advice & added 1/2 cup of sour cream to the mix.  YUM!

I used this recipe basically as a guideline - definitely add some water in before baking. The first time I made it, I put in very little water and ended up having to add water after 45 minutes and then baking for an additional 20 minutes until the rice was done. Probably using minute rice would solve this problem. I don't make it with the tomatoes and green chiles. Instead, I put the water, rice, and soup into a big bowl and mix in some defrosted vegetables, as well as cut up carrots and potatoes. Really you could put whatever you wanted into it. I add whatever spices I feel like - garlic powder, curry powder, cayenne, etc... and then cover it with foil and throw it in the oven. It's a great simple way to make a one pan dish. Definitely something I'll continue to do!

Loved this... but I also revised it a bit. I used minute rice as suggested and seasoned the chicken with some fajita seasoning and taco bell hot sauce (I love spice!). Added sour cream and the tortilla chips and cheese towards the end- I couldn't imagine the recipe without the chips and cheese. Makes a world of difference especially since the rice portion is kind of creamy.

I thought this dish was great!  Some users said to use instant rice, but I disagree; instant is too starchy and if you cook it in the oven for 45-50 minutes it comes out fine.  I did add 1/4c. chicken broth and some frozen broccoli, and it made a whole meal.  Very good!

This was very easy and had a delicious spicy kick! I used 1 10z can of Rotel diced tomatoes with lime and cilantro, and that was plenty for the dish. I added 1/4cup more rice and a splash of milk instead of water.  Next time I will add a thin layer of refried beans on top of the chicken.  Cheese on top would be nice, but we were trying to cut fat. I served it with a scoop of lowfat sour cream and it was delicious!  I also seasoned chicken with salt and pepper before adding the rice mixture.
Very spicy and flavorful!  Best of all...super easy!!!  Thank you!

Hmm...I guess this was decent compared to the amount of work required.  Used instant rice and it was the perfect consistency.  This definitely needs a personal touch, maybe salt & pepper the chicken first, add black olives & scallions, sour cream, lots of cheddar.  As is, it's pretty tasteless other than the bite from the Rotel.  Will try again with revisions.

This was okay, but I wouldn't make it again without some serious adjustments. As written, it tasted like canned tomatoes and soup, and wasn't very interesting. Also have to be careful not to spoon rice over the chicken, as it will not cook and soften. However, this is a good basis for something that could be pretty tasty with some changes.

Well, I made the mistake of using the extra hot tomatoes and chilis, so it was almost too hot to eat.  Still, this had a great flavor and was super easy.  It took a little over an hour to get the rice done, but it was good.  Hot, but good.  :o)  By the way, I added some cheese, too.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family loved this!!! It had a kick to it for sure! I seasoned the meat with adobo first then browned it. I also added a 1/2 cup of sour cream as suggested by others. I think next time i may add another can of cream of chicken. If i don't its still great and i will def make again! Thanks for sharing!

5 stars for something so easy, fast, and when you're in a pinch and don't have much on hand. I read other reviews and so many people added cheese and sour cream THEN said how good it was. I didn't have any of those. I sautéd some onions and garlic, browned the chcken skin, then made as directed. Oh, I seasoned the chicken with Old Bay first. It took EXACTLY 45 min to cook and didn't need extra water like some had said. Very good for those nights you don't have much on hand. Bf said it was very good. He had no idea I literally "threw" it together cuz I had nothing else. Try it...it's great. And I agree, cheese would make it better :)

I took the suggestion of topping with some shredded mexican cheese.  In my effort to get more legumes in our diet, added black beans in with the tomatoes/rice/soup/seasoning and it was a huge hit for such an easy quick dish.  Will make this again!

I also tweaked this quite a bit. First, I didn't have any creamed soups in the house, so I used my own chicken broth and thickened it a bit with corn starch. And since I was using the Rotel tomatoes & chiles, I thought corn and cheese would be nice additions, so that's what I did.  Next time I'd just add more cheese and this will be perfect!

This was easy and delicious. I browned the chicken and cut up in pieces.  Used lite sour cream as suggested and low fat soups and brown rice.  I sprinkled a little grated cheddar cheese over top.  Would probably add some tortille chips on top next time as it could stand some crunch.

This reminded me of a recipe for chicken casserole using Velveeta cheese, which I always thought needed something else--adding rice was perfect!  I started with Easy Spicy Chicken and Rice recipe and stirred in 12 oz. Velveeta (melted).  Then I topped the whole casserole with crushed tortilla chips.  Really yummy!!

This was wonderful!  I added a sliced onion as well as some reduced fat feta cheese once casserole was done baking!  Highly recommend this one!  (I used everything low fat or reduced fat and I also used Basmati rice)  This could be the easist thing to make!!

A surprisingly good base recipe; I had a slightly smaller can of ROtel (10 oz.  I browned my chicken breast pieces first in PAM cooking spray, then mixed together the soup, ROtel, 1 cup long grain rice (NOT instant), plus 1 large cube of Knorr chicken boullion, 1-1/2 cups water, then spiced it up a little with cumin, minced onion, season pepper and garlic salt.  Pour all this on top of the chicken, bring to boil, then cover and simmer about 25-30 minutes.

This was extremely easy.  I followed the recipe for ths most part and I thought it was quite good.  I did add hot pepper flakes to give it a bit more kick. After I made it I realized I liked it better without the chicken so next time I'll probably make it just as a rice dish!  Either way - very good!

Give this a 5 star for 2 reasons, it was very tasty, and very easy. I did add cheese to the top the last 5 minutes of baking. I made according to the recipe. I will also try this with Italian tomatoes. Can put all together and have already to bake.

This was pretty good. Next time I will add garlic powder, cumin, and chili powder to help increase the flavor. I added a cup of shredded cheddar cheese in the last 5 minutes of cooking.

This was truly an easy meal! I add a few things to the original recipe after reading others reviews. I used 1/2 cup of rice, can chili ready tomatoes, dried onions, fresh garlic and celery and for my family I added cheese (mexican cheese). I allowed dish to bake for 1 hour.

Good idea, but the flavor was pretty blah...even with the rotel.  The chicken was visually unappealing as well, so if I make it again, I will definately brown the chicken so it doesn't look so pale when I serve it.  It needs a little something more...adding some veggies might do the trick.

Received 5 stars from my family.  I do think I'd cut the rice down to 1/2 cup though.  I like it more spicy so I used pickled jalapenos.  I added a side dish of sauteed red peppers, bacon, onion and cauliflower.  Rave reviews.

I put Pillsbury croissant dough on top for the last 15-20 minutes of cooking. It was cooked and crispy on top but kinda mushy on the bottom but it was reaaalllly good! I also added onions, mushrooms, shredded cheddar cheese, and a dollop of sour cream to the medium bowl mix step. SO good!!!!!!!!!!!!  I didn't have any crunchy rice problems, but I did use instant rice.

This was great! Everyone loved it. I tried to stay with the recipe, but used 1 1/2 cups rice because I wanted to make more.  Then used TWO cans cream of chicken and the diced whole jalapeno pepper. It was perfect, just a bit spicy (I don't see how it would be spicy without the jalapeno).  I actually stirred the rice during cooking, not disturbing the chicken tenders.  Had to add more water (total about 1 can). Then I added shredded cheddar about 5 minutes before serving.  Just a great Mexican-creamy casserole!  Thanks for this very easy recipe -- the magic ingredients: diced tomatoes with chilies and cream of chicken soup. Lots of possibilities for other additives: corn tortillas, sour cream; who knows?

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe!  Very easy to make.  Only made a couple of additions, added another 1/2 cup of rice and a soup can of 1/2 milk and 1/2 water and some garlic powder, seasoned the chicken tenders and uncovered after 45 minutes and added a mexican blend shredded cheddar cheese on top and left in another 15 minutes - delicious!

This recipe is great and my husband and children love it. When ever we want to spice it up we just add some hot rotel or pace picante sauce, sometimes we even sprinkle cheese on top.

Oh how brilliant is this? I actually barely followed the recipe at all, but I'm giving it all the credit for telling me to mix tomatoes with chilies and chicken soup and to pour it over chicken. I added lots of stuff, the best of which was a can of corn. I also added garlic, oragano, low fat sour cream and low fat cottage cheese. I just cooked the chicken in a frying pan, mixed all the saucy stuff in a bowl and poured it in the pan over the cooked chicken. It was so totally awesome. I served it over rice, but I'm going to do it with roasted potatoes next.

Flavorful and easy, this is a great weeknight dinner. I took the advice of others and added 1/2 c. sour cream. It did take an hour to cook the rice. Thanks for a good weeknight dish.

Excellent recipe and so easy to throw together.  I added some minced garlic and some onion powder for a little extra flavor and threw it in the oven.  Great for a night when you just want something in the oven and relax!

I thought this was excellent!  Very simple and tasted great.  I did add some italian seasonings as well as some garlic to the chicken, and topped the hot dish off by sprinkling some dry onion soup mix over the rice mixture.  Will make again, thanks for the recipe Christie!

Very simple and easy to make. I also browned the chicken first. Used one can rotel tomatoes w/ chillies.  We must be whimpy in this house. Had a great flavor but was very spicy. Would make again but with regular tomatoes and add a "few" chiilies.

I really enjoyed this recipe! It's winter in Australia and I've been craving a taste of home. Of course I read through a few other reviews and tweaked the recipe a bit.  I added a diced onion, used the ro-tel with habanaros (we like it spicy), added the 1/2 cup of sour cream, threw in a little cilantro/corriander, and the 1/2 cup of water as others had suggested.  There are only two of us and it made enough for us to have a second meal.  The leftovers were just as tasty as the night I made it.  I did cook it an hour rather than the 45 minutes.  Anyway I would definitely try this out, I don't think you'll be disappointed!

this was great!  added 1/2 cup sour cream, 4 cloves of garlic minced, and a generous amount of cajun seasoning.  Cooked for 1 hour 15 minutes then topped with mexican 5 blend shredded cheese and back in oven to melt.  Delicious!

It was pretty bland, but easy to make. Will make again, but will be adding some seasonings to the chicken to make it more tasteful.

I followed some of the reviews for this recipe and mine turned out great! I added some sour cream to the mixture and since I didn't have any rotel or diced chiles I just used some mild jarred salsa (my husband doesn't like things too spicy anyway) and it was great! Nothing too fancy, but a good recipe to fall back on when time is tight.

This is a delicious quick dish to throw together after work, let it bake while you relax for a bit. Like some other users I used Rotel tomatoes and added some extras to taste - sour cream, onion powder and fresh garlic. At the end of the bake time, I topped it with French's Fried Onions and put it back in uncovered for 5 minutes. Added a nice little crunch! This is definitely going into the dinner menu rotation.

This was a great meal!  My husband and I liked the spice, but the kids didn't like the rice.  Loved the chicken, though.  Very easy..just follow directions.

This was just so so.  I was really excited about this recipe. I am a huge fan of chicken and rice and a huge fan of Ro-Tel tomatoes.  I figured "what could be better than combining the two?".  I was wrong.  I guess I was hoping it would taste a little more like a King Ranch Casserole.

We thought this was just OK.  I had to cook it almost an hour and a half to get the rice tender.  It wasn't really all that spicy.  We thought it was just sort of blah.  Probably won't be making again.

My family really loved this dish - everyone had seconds!  It was very easy but I did modify it a little. I used Goya Arroz Amarillo (yellow rice with seasoning), Rotel, and chicken tenders marinated in Italian dressing. It cooked perfectly in exactly 45 minutes. I topped the whole thing with a mixture of crushed "Red Hot Blues" tortilla chips and grated pepper jack cheese. Then  browned it under the broiler for another 6-8 minutes......BIG HIT!  The chicken was very tender, the rice was delicious and it was just spicey enough - this will be a frequent flyer at my house

I also took the suggestion of adding 1/2 sour cream to the mixture and sprinkled a little taco seasonging on the chicken. Was very easy & delish. A nice one pot meal - you don't need to do the mixture in a bowl just simply stir it all in a casserole dish and then place chicken on top. One thing I would do next time is add the chicken after the rice mixture has been cooking about 10 mins to avoid dryness. Will make again!

This recipe has a good taste-but it takes a lot longer to cook than indicated-especially if you double the recipe. I used fat free soups and I also added a cup of shredded Monterey Jack cheese to the mix. If you plan on doubling the recipe like I did, make sure you add one cup of water so the chicken/rice don't dry out. Also, when you double it-it will take about and hour and 45 minutes to cook the rice.

After an hour of cooking the rice still wasn't done at all. I had to take it out of the oven as everyone was waiting on dinner and the other sides were ready.  I think the flavor was awesome and the dish would've been great had the rice actually cooked thoroughly.  I probably won't make it again since everyone hated it because of the hard rice though.

Great and easy.  I made some of the adjustments suggested by other reviewers, nothing drastic just some spices, doubled the rice, tomatoes and green chilies and a can of cream of mushroom along with the cream of chicken.  Melted Monterey Jack on top.  Great will definitely make this again.  Thanks!!

7.9.19 .... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/8877/easy-spicy-chicken-and-rice/ ... Some magic happened here.  'Really surprised me!  Followed ingredients, but not directions so much.  I sprinkled the precooked chicken, 4c, with fajita seasoning.  Mixed in the soup & a quarter cup chicken broth along with the storebrand of original Rotel, not drained, some dried cilantro & parsley.  'Put 3 slices American cheese on 3c hot white rice in a round 2.5L dish; layered chicken mixture, rice, cheese, chicken mixture, cheese.  Covered for half an hour.  Here's dinner.  ;D  Next time:   Cooled rice on bottom, chicken mixture & cheese, loosely covered.  E, 22, had two big servings.  Nice!  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this a few times  - very easy weeknight dinner.  We use brown rice and fat free cream of chicken soup for a slightly healthier version.  Add hot sauce for more kick - delish.  Thanks!

I followed this recipe to the letter and it was okay, nothing really wrong with it but nothing outstanding either.  It wasn't very flavorful.  I was hoping the rice would be more saucy, if I make it again I may add 1 more can of soup. It was very easy however, and I liked that.

Biggest problem is that the rice is not ready at all, ugh.  Definately should use minute rice.  Otherwise good, easy.

It's still cooking, so I have yet to taste it. Smells good, but 45 minutes is definitely not enough cooking time.  Chicken was still completely raw. Maybe it would be good to brown the chicken first, like some reviewers recommended.  Really easy to make, though!

I've made this meal 4 times now for my family and it is always hit :). I usually double it and cut the chicken into smaller pieces. I've also used cream of mushroom instead when I did not have any cream of chicken and it tasted good like that too.  Thanks for posting this.

This was not one of my favorite recipes. I added onion
And I used cream of mushroom garlic soup and I  had to cook longer than directed. Just still seem to be lacking flavor and appeal. My husband was not a fan.

Very good, I diced and browned the chicken and used instant (boil in bag) rice. I also added a little onion and 1/2 cup sour cream and a cup of chedder before baking. With about five minutes left top it with some crushed tortilla chips, black olives, and enough cheese to just cover the top.  Excellent!

My husband actually made this for us for dinner.  To look at, it's nothing too exciting. We added crushed tortilla chips and cheese to the top and put it under the broiler for a few minutes like someone else suggested.  I added some sour cream and black olives to the top of mine and liked it a lot, but I don't think I would have eaten the chicken and rice by itself...A little bland for me.  I'm giving it 4 stars, but only because we added some things to make it better.

Yum! This was very tasty.  I didn't have chile peppers so I added 2 tbs of pique de limon and sazon goya seasoning.  I also had to bake for maybe 1/2 hour longer than the recipe said because of the rice but it came out wonderful!! family loved it:)

My fiancee picked this dish out one night for dinner. We loved it, it took an hour to bake and it was kinda spicy but i will know to use different tomatoes for us next time. I did add some things to make it a little more to our liking  I used all the ingredients called for but I cut our chicken up, added some frozen veggies (about handful of each corn,peas,carrots and greenbeans) I also added onion and garlic powder and a can of water.I was going to add sour cream but my fiancee has to watch his dairy intake so i skipped on that i did sprinkle some shreaded cheese on mine! mmm very yummy thanks for this simple good recipe!

This was really good and really easy.  However, I found it to be a little too wet for my liking, so next time I'll probably drain the tomatoes or maybe add more rice.  Also, I like spicy, so I added about a tablespoon of cayenne pepper and about a cup of corn.

Of course, I put my own little spin on it.  I was craving a stew of sorts...so I prepared this on the stovetop and used a can of diced tomatoes w/ jalepenos (b/c that's what I had in the cabinet).  It was quick, easy, and DELICIOUS!!!  Thank you!

This was an easy meal and deserves at least 4 stars just for that! The taste was also pretty good. I used one can of diced tomatoes and one 4 ounce can of diced chilis. To that I added some garlic and onion powders along with some cumin. This was not a spicy dish and I feel like it needed a little extra kick for our family's taste. I ended up adding water - about a soup can full. To disagree with other reviewers, the rice actually was done in an hour.

Made this on the spur of the moment and was pleasantly pleased with the outcome. I admit that I changed it up a little, but only out of cause :) 
I used what I had on hand which was 11 drum sticks. I seasoned my meat, cooked the rice for about 10 min, added white wine to the tomatoes, and chiles for flavor, and cooked for 50 minutes. 

Loved it

This recipe was okay. I cut up the meat so that if my baby had some, I wouldn't have to worry about cutting the meat up just for her. I think if I made the recipe again I would cut the meat up again. However, this recipe wasn't one that made me go "WOW" so I probably won't make it again.
I did add the sour cream and cheese during the last 15 minutes (I had too cook it for a total of 1 hour) and I can't imagine eating this without these two ingredients.

This was delicious! I made a few changes, because I didn't have the diced tomatoes. Instead, I used Pace Picante salsa, and it really added a lot of spice and flavoring. In fact, my brother in law was over and he said that this was the best chicken/rice dish he's ever had. Coming from him (he's very picky), it was a compliment. I will definitley make this again.

Very nice.  My kids liked it even.  I added another can of tomatoes and soup and put another cup of rice in.  I also added about a cup of water.  Melted cheese on it and it was great.

I loved this recipe!  I did make a few small changes.  I threw in some hot enchillada sauce, Italian seasoning, and a can of diced green chiles as suggested by other reviewers.  I also used minute rice to make sure it would be tender when the chicken was ready, which it was!  Very yummy, super easy!

I had to cook this a lot longer than recommended to soak up the liquid.  Turned out really good with melted cheddar cheese on top.  However when I first pulled it out of the oven it smelled horrible; if you can get over that it is pretty good

This was fantastic! I also added the sour cream and cheese towards the end of baking (5 min before its done). This was very quick and easy to make :o)

We did not like this recipe at all. I should have known that I wouldn't like the combination of cream of chicken soup and tomatoes. Also, I used brown rice like one of the other reviewers did and it took much longer to cook than the recipe said.

Very good!  I used the "Milder" can of tomatoes with chilis, and it was perfect in terms of spiciness.  Next time I may add a little cheese!

This was easy and yummy for a cold night! I did add cheese on top as other reviewers had suggested. I used the tomatoes with the chilis and didn't find it too hot, but would probably be a little too hot for kids.
