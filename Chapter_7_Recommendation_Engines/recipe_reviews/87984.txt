WOW. Long ago a friend's mom made this for us as an after-school snack, and I've been searching for this recipe! So very delicious! DO NOT BE AFRAID to try this recipe. So simple, versatile, healthy & tasty! Be sure to stir the dressing ingredients until the sugar dissolves completely. Eat this on its own, or toss w/ some salad greens & top w/crumbled blue cheese & toasted pecans (serve w/ some extra dressing). Instead of dicing the apples, simply slice them and toss w/ dressing in a ziploc bag - makes a great snack for kids. Different & special. REALLY DELICIOUS!! Try it, you'll love it.

This is SO GOOD!  I would have never thought to do this, but it is terrific!  When summer comes around I'll try strawberries, yummy.  *Update*  I have since put these apples on a bed of mixed greens with shaved parmesan cheese on top for a knockout of a salad!  Try it, you'll like it!

What a delish combo!  I used braeburn apples, and added black pepper due to others recommendations!  It was fabulous...I even added some cayenne for added kick but will reduce the balsamic next time b/c it was a little too much for me.  I'm a crazy balsamic fan but this sort of stung the nostrils! I served it over baby spinach, added some chopped cashews and feta cheese...no dressing needed!

This was pretty good, but not as good as I'd expected.  Next time I'll try it with a little less balsamic vinegar.  I love balsamic, but a little goes a long way. I think that it might also be important to use very coarsely ground pepper.

I normally don't like fresh apples OR vinegar, but this recipe was shockingly FANTASTIC and super easy/quick!!  In addition to experimenting with different fruits, you can also try variations on the vinegar.  For example, I tried raspberry balsamic vinegar and it was delightful. :)

I'm so glad that I read the ratings on this recipe.  The rater that said "DO NOT BE AFRAID" to try this won me over. I LOVED THIS tart and tangy way to eat fruit.  I will eat apples more often now.  I had red delicious on hand so used them.  Used red wine vinegar and doubled the brown sugar for my taste.  Thanks for the recipe.

So glad I found this recipe again. I first used it with strawberries and it is the greatest! Like the other rater said, don't be afraid to try this. I know vinegar, sugar and pepper with fruits sounds awful but it really brings out the flavor.

I'm so glad I tried this recipe. I thought it sounded odd, but it was SO good. I didn't change a thing. 

P.S. Thanks to the reviewer who told us not to be afraid of trying it - you won me over.

I did not do this recipe right because it was NOT what I expected. I used Pink lady apples so that might make a difference. I just wanted a little snack, so I kind of just eyeballed the measurments so that might have made a change. I cut the apple in to chip-like slices and dipped it in to the mixture. Anybody know other things I did wrong? This recipe looks great, all the reviewers loved it. I was thinking about doing this as a snack for my bday but I am glad I tried it beforehand because this was NOT what I wanted it to be. I highly reccomend this if you will do it right! :D

Made this as written.  Waayy too sour, even though I usually love tangy, sour flavors.  Ended up doubling the sugar and still felt all I could taste was vinegar. Also, too much pepper. Nice idea, but will not make again.

Very mouth watering, excellent for appetizer.  I didn't adjust the taste after mixing all the ingredients and it turned out just right.

NEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THIS COMBO WOULD BE SOOOOOO GOOD!! I AM A HUGE BASALMIC VINEGAR FAN AND PUT THIS ON EVERYTHING FROM FRUIT,SALADS, AND EVEN COOKED MEAT. MY HUBBY THOUGHT THE VINEGAR WAS VERY STRONG. I USED SPLENDA BROWN SUGAR AND IT WAS WONDERFUL!!!!!

This is surprisingly good. I think it's more of a chick snack. My boyfriend wasn't too crazy about it.

Saw this intriguing recipe in the recent reviews & I was hungry for a snack so I gave it a whirl. I cut it down to one serving & used a braeburn apple. I think the tartness of a granny smith w/ the tartness of the vinegar would have been too much for me...I think the sweet/tart aspect of the braeburn was perfect. I added more brown sugar to mine because it was still a little tart for my tastes. I loved the slight bite of the pepper...it was a really good component to the fruit.

Thank you so much for this recipe, it was exactly what I was looking for. I like apples, but I'm not crazy about them, so I wanted a recipe that would make them taste a little better for my taste buds since apples are so good for you. This was simple and fast; perfect for a healthy snack. I didn't have balsamic vinegar so I used red wine vinegar and it tasted just fine. I will try balsamic next time. After I mixed it all in a bowl, I topped it off with just a pinch of cinnamon and sugar...yum.
