This is an amazing potato dish if it is altered slightly! I add green onions and fresh garlic. I get so many compliments on this dish. Just change those to things and I also add a 1/4 cup of milk so it isnt so thick. Try it this way you will love it!

Gave this recipe 5 stars for such a good base to start from. Read lots of the reviews and came up with the changes listed: 

2 1/2 pounds potatoes, diced ,

1 onion thinly sliced,

2 teaspoons onion powder,

2 teaspoons minced garlic,

1 TBS rosemary,

2 cups sour cream,

2 1/2 cups condensed cream of chicken soup,

2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese,

2/3 cup shredded extra sharp cheddar cheese(for the top),

The extra sharp cheddar cheese on top gave it a very nice look and a lot more flavor than mozzarella would. This is so good that if you needed a quick main dish all you need to do is at the meat/chicken of your choice to the dish and you'll have a happy family!

I have always loved these cheesey potato dishes. My family, however hasn't unless it acompanies a steak. But I tried this and we LOVED it for a great easy special Friday night dinner with the Challah bread. My husband, who is esp. grossed out by 'slimey' potatoes raved about this and asked for it again on Sabbath! So I will be making this often, even though it is summer.

Good potatoes! I used a little more garlic and even then added a dash of garlic powder (as well as the other spices). Next time, I will use a little more potatoes as this was a little too creamy but the taste was very good! Went well with our pork chop dinner!

TRY THIS ONE, YOU WILL LOVE IT.  TASTES VERY MUCH LIKE A TWICE BAKED POTATO.

This was a great recipe but, like other reviewers, I did find it a little bland so I added onion as others had then I also added about a tbls. of rosemary and some parsley to it. Like others I also used fresh garlic. Once this was done it was great and I got tons of compliments at Easter dinner. I had plenty of leftovers so I cooked 1/2 a pound of bacon cut into pieces, removed it from the grease and cooked 1/2 pound of boneless skinless chicken breast cut into pieces in the bacon grease. I mixed the chicken in with the potatoes, added a can of mushrooms and topped it all with bacon and a sprinkle of shredded cheddar. I baked it uncovered until it was bubbly all the way through. Fantastic!

Not exactly a low-cal dish but this is absolutely wonderful!!  I really had more sauce than I needed but maybe I didn't use enough potatoes as I just guessed at the amount.  Flavor was wonderful and husband ate 3 servings!  Will definitely make again.

I made this for our annual White Elephant party we go to every year and wanted to wow everyone. I had found this recipe by luck. I got many compliments on this dish and everyone asking for the recipe. I did as the recipe states but also added more potatoes and salt and pepper as the recipe does not state this. Otherwise this was a hit,thanks so much for posting this one!!

Very nice potato dish.  I didn't have any mozarella cheese but I did sprinkle bacon bits on the top and that was yummy.  Also didn't have any cream of mushroom so I used cream of celery instead.  My family enjoyed it.

This was okay... kind of bland for my tastes, and waaay too much sauce.  If I make it again, I'll use more potato, more spices, and more cheese.  Also, it took longer than 45 minutes for me... about 1 hour, and I had to put it under the grill.

My whole family LOVES this dish. We subbed cream of onion for the mushroom soup and liked it even better. These are better than any scalloped or Au Gratin potato you'll find anywhere.

Not a bad comfort dish. If you like spicy foods then this is not for you, but could be a great side dish with something more spicy, to help keep the heat down! I try not to alter recipes too much but I didn't feel like the stodge of mozzarella on top of cream and cheddar  and as mozzarella is so very bland, I felt I would not lose anything from the dish other than texture so added a couple or so slices of burger cheese instead for contrast. Next time I may add a few frozen peas and sliced onions to the dish, but I wont make it too often as it's almost a heart attack on a plate!

This was surprisingly tasty and was well received at a potluck dinner. This will be a good standby recipe to use when you don't want to take an expensive dish to a potluck if you need to feed a lot of people.

The sauce tends to be runny.  Next time I'll cut it back to 1/2 to 3/4 of what the recipe calls for.  If you don't cut the sauce back I would definitely let it sit for a good 15/20 minutes to firm up.

A real wnner.  Served at my family's Thanksgiving yesterday and was a big hit.  Plan to take to the inlaws this afternoon and a church potluck next week.  I did double the recipe, but cut back a little on the onion powder.  We aren't big onion lovers. Thanks for sharing!

I had a bunch of left over baked potatoes and used them up with this recipe.  Everyone loved it. We have enought leftover for our next dinner so I added leftover ground turkey and it was excellent on the re-heat.  Thanks for a great recipe.

It was good but it seemed to be missing something. It was too mushy for me. Maybe it cooking the potatoes differently would do the trick.

I used Yucon Gold potatoes. 2 lbs. of potatoes get lost in the amount of sauce this makes.  If I make this again I will dice up the entire 5 lb. bag of potatoes for this dish.

This was really yummy.  I used the fat free mushroom soup and lessened the cheese, it still turned out delicious.

Will make again, with my crumbled potato chips over the top of casserole the last few minutes of baking.  Had left-over Prime Rib w/horseradish flavor chips, spread them over the dish and tasted darn good after baking.

Made this TWICE... Once as written,  and i agree with others, it is bland. The second time, I added 1/4 onion minced, 2 fresh garlic cloves chopped and a tablespoon of fresh parsley, and used 1/2 mozzarella and 1/2 shredded parmesan, dash of pepper pepper and topped it with some freshly made bacon bits in the last 15 minutes of baking.  Try it and let us know what changes you make.  Thanks Sal for a great starter recipe!

OMG!! I made this as a side for dinner tonight and it was to die for. I made half the recipe, and used cream of chicken soup(instead of mushroom), diced onions, and 1/2 tsp onion powder, 1 1/2 tsp garlic, 1/2 tsp pepper, and 1/2 tsp parsley. Thanks sal for a wonderful recipe.

I used cream of celery because that is what I had on hand. I added a little milk and an onion. I needed to use up items in my fridge and this was a great recipe to do that.

Made this today for a potluck and following other reviews, used almost 5 lbs of potatoes, non-fat greek yogurt instead of sour cream, thinly sliced onions, sharp cheddar instead of the mozzarella, fresh rosemary and garlic. Also added some salt. Topped it with bacon bits too. Yummy.

Yum!  But, add more potatoes!  It has more "stuff" than potatoes, and I think you could easily double the potatoes in this recipe.  Very yummy though!

While the taste was good,  it was ridiculously runny... almost the consistency of broth with potato lumps.  The only thing I changed from the recipe was to add diced onions and that shouldn't have changed the consistency that much.   I might try it again in the future but was very glad I wasn't planning on taking it anywhere.   Maybe someone has an idea of what went wrong or maybe I was just expecting something heartier.

Everyone loved it! A lot of my friends and family have asked for this recipe. The only thing I did different was to lightly fry 1 cup of onions instead of using onion powder.

Make this all the time. I have started adding things and using it as a meal. I have added ham, peas, asparagus, chicken, ground beef, and lots of other things to make it a main dish. Everyone loves it at my house and for get togethers I host.

This was excellent! The only changes I made was to sub 1 can of the cream of mushroom soup for 1 can of cream of onion soup. It makes plenty of sauce, so next time I will use 5 lbs of potatoes. This is my new recipe for family gatherings and potlucks.

If you look at the recipe there isn't any ingredient that is a stand out but when you put them together Wow these are amazingly delicious. Followed the recipe as written and this will go into my regular rotation. Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

Tried this recipe for a potluck/Chili cook-off, and every guest who tried it asked for the recipe.  Needless to say it was a huge hit!  The leftovers were even more delicious the next day, it seems the longer this dish sits the better it's flavor becomes.  Loved this one!  Just a small tip for those who live at high altitude it takes longer to bake than the recipe calls for, plan for extra time.  About half an hour to fourty five minutes, or you can raise the temp of the oven.  YUM!
