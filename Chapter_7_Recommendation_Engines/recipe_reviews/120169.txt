I make a VERY similar recipe that everyone asks for when I serve it.  I roll the asparagus in the oil and MINCED GARLIC and then roast as directed. Near the end of roasting sprinkle on the balsamic vinegar and grated parmasean cheese and put under broiler for a few minutes.  It is outrageous and pretty!

This is my favorite way to cook asparagus!  But I do add minced garlic and a bit of lemon juice.  One thing that I do to keep the ends from getting too toasty is to bake these on a large cookie sheet with two rows, tips facing towards the middle.  This seems to help the asparagus stalk to roast more evenly.  Great recipe!

A great basic roasted asparagus recipe.  I added about 2 tbsp of grated parmesan cheese towards the last 5 minutes of roasting.  As well, I drizzled the asparagus with a balsamic reduction.  An easy recipe: bring 2 cups of balsamic vinegar to a boil and continue to boil until it reduces down to about a half cup (should be syrupy in consistency).  It really helps to concentrate the balsamic flavor and looks pretty on the plate (just use a drizzle though or else you could overwhelm the flavor of the asparagus).

I sauteed some fresh minced garlic and a little fresh minced onion in the olive oil before drizzling it over the asparagus. This was absolutely delicious. What the family didn't eat, I finished. Very, very good.

Wow! Delicious way to cook asparagus and like others I added some minced garlic and topped it with some Parmesan cheese.  Even the pickiest eater will enjoy this one!

These turned out great.  I added some shredded parmesan after they came out of the oven.  This is how I'm going to cook my asparagus from now on. I just made these again, and didn't even add the Balsamic.  It has a much milder flavor this way.  Much more fresh tasting.  The method of roasting is a wonderful suggestion.  Thanks for the recipe. *Update* now I tried putting the shredded parmesan on before they go into the oven, and I add a teeny pat of butter.  I'm seasoning with garlic salt, and lemon pepper, and they are absolutely outstanding.  Between the butter, garlic, and the parmesan which crisps up a bit, I end up spooning some of "what's left behind" in the baking dish, over the asparagus in the serving dish.  I think I've had asparagus for the last 3 dinners since I tried this.  Love it!

I think I would give this 5 stars had I not already tried the other AR recipe "Roasted Asparagus with Balsamic Butter". The butter really does add something special. With that said, for lower calories and saturated fat, this is a great choice. You can also roast asparagus on a cookie-drying rack with just a few spritzes of cooking spray (IE Pam spray) also to omit a few more calories. Thanks for the recipe, despite the buttery recipe being tastier, I WILL use this one again for the lower calories :)

I love asparagus and, so, this was a real treat.  Generally, in this house, asparagus gets steamed to death and since it is one of my favorite veggies I was looking for something to break the cycle.  I did give it a little dusting of parmesan as it came out of the oven.  Just plain great!

Very good and healthy tasting, though I think that I would prefer this without the balsamic vinegar.  Thanks for the recipe; I plan to make this often when asparagus is available.

Made with ham this year for Easter.  Was delicious- the best asparagus recipe!  TIP:  I added the soy sauce and balsamic vinegar mixture to the butter in the hot pan (fire was off), and it splattered EVERYWHERE!  I suggest you mix them in a separate bowl.

This recipe was very good.  I changed it a little bit.  I used extra virgin olive oil and took 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, reduced it in pan until 3 tablespoons remained.  I added some brown sugar and 1/2 tsp of butter to the balsamic reduction and drizzled over asparagus.  Delicious!  Thanks!

Made this for our annual family Easter Egg Hunt.  This was easy to get ready ahead and as soon as I took out the ham, I turned up the temp to 425 & it was ready in just 10 minutes.  Awesome flavor and I doubled the recipe - no problem!!  This recipes a keeper!  Thanks Natalie

I used this for Easter.  I actually took a stalk prior to adding the Balsamic to check to make sure they were cooked, and it was really good.  After adding the Balsamic though, I wasn't quite impressed.  Lesson learned, simple is better for this one.

This was well recieved even by my teen who didn't think he really liked asparagus. He didn't eat seconds but he agreed it was pretty good even for asparagus. Easy and quick to prepare, a nice side dish for our ham.

This is a delicious recipe as is.  I also like adding minced or whole garlic.  Brussel sprouts cooked this way are good.  My favorite is asparagus brussel sprout combo.

Added a bit of lemon juice as suggested by previous reviews. I made a mistake and combined all the ingredients together. I didn't want to waste it so I threw it on the asparagus and crossed my fingers. Turned out just fine. I also did the same to zucchini and it gave a great flavor.

I had extememly thin asparagus, but it still took longer to bake to be tender-crisp.  I ended up adding a couple tablespoons of water to the pan because it was starting to look brown and stick.

I loved it with the parmesan cheese that one reviewer mentioned.  In addition, I finally learned to put the balsamic vinegar on closer to the end...no more soggy asparagus!!

Great!  I put followed the directions, but then topped it with some Parmesan cheese and threw it under the broiler for a few moments.  The balsamic gives it such a wonderful flavor.

Yum!  I don't usually write reviews, but I loved this so much more than boiling - I had to write.  I also added some graded Parmesan cheese a few minutes before taking it of the oven.  10 minutes was enough time.  Added a little garlic powder as well.  5 Stars!

I had always steamed asparagus, but never again.  This is such a great way to prepare it.  Even if you just use EVOO and sea salt, roasted asparagus is delicious!

This was absolutely wonderful just as the recipe was written.  I have horrible childhood memories of slimy asparagus but my fiance cooked this for a family dinner and I think I shocked everyone by tasting it and actually liking it.  This recipe will definitely be used over and over.

Good asparagus, and I'm not overly fond of asparagus.  But I would be willing to make this and eat it again!  I sprinkled with sliced almonds, but this recipe is quite suitable to many different variations.  Thanks for the post!

Perfectly simple and delicious! I added garlic and used coarse salt crystals and also added the vinegar before putting in the oven.(A mistake that worked out well!) Transferred to a serving platter and then poured the pan juices over. Great!

Try it this way before altering anything!  Since coming across this recipe a little over a year ago, it's the only way we make asparagus!  Delicious, easy, perfectly seasoned.  Don't mess with this one!

Added minced garlic w the olive oil, plus thyme, garlic powder, onion powder (lots), & lemon juice.  Rolled asparagus around in that, put in oven.  Added real balsamic vinegar (the good stuff) at the end, then sprinkled w parmesean cheese & rolled it around again.  DEEEEEElicious!

Great base recipe.  I did make a few changes.  I tossed the asparagus in a mix of olive and canola oil and chopped garlic to coat.  Then I cooked it on a griddle over med-high heat (my oven was occupied).  I seasoned the asparagus while "grilling" and then in the last minute of cooking, I added a splash of balsamic.  After plating, I sprinkled with a little parmesan.  Turned out great with a bit of sweetness from the venegar.  Next time I might try adding a bit of lemon juice or zest as well.

It was my first time to bake asparagus and they were really good. Minced garlic was the only thing I added. Thanks for the recipe!

This is "the perfect" asparagus recipe.  Easy, quick, nutritious, delicious and you can add your own touch without messing anything up.  I have added a Tbsp of slivered almonds on top, or a Tbsp of shredded fontinella cheese, but it is great as written, we make this dish weekly.

This was totally yummy. I love balsamic vinegar, but actually left it off this time. The asparagus was great without it:)

This was a good recipe, but I made a smaller batch of asparagus and I think I used too much balsamic vinegar.  It has a very strong flavor and too much can be overpowering.  Also, I would pair this dish with something relatively bland, like mashed potatoes and maybe just a good steak.  I made this with the chicken and basil cream recipe (from this website) and some pasta, and that did not go together well!  Good recipe though.  I'll try it again.  Thank you for sharing this!

Great way to make asparagus!  A nice departure from the old stand by of steaming with lemon or with holindaise for that matter.  I tried this last night and HAD to have it again tonight.  I'm lucky enough to have wild asparagus in my yard and usually run out of ways to eat it all before the season is over.  I won't have that problem anymore!

This was a yummy recipe and easy which was great since it was only my 2nd time making asparagus.  I did leave it in the oven a few minutes longer than I meant to but it was still very good.

This was a delicious side dish for our Christmas meal. I added fresh minced garlic before cooking and a little shredded parmesan cheese after it came out of the oven. Will definitely make again.

Excellent!  This is a regular vegetable side dish in our house; we have it at least once a week!  I roll the asparagus in olive oil and fresh minced garlic.  Season and roast according to recipe.  I take it out a few minutes before.  Sprinkle with a bit of freshly grated parmesan cheese and broil for a minute or so.  Wonderful!!!

Even with large asparagus stalks this turned out excellent.  My husband raved about it - the best he'd ever had.

I followed this recipe exactly except for using garlic salt instead of plain salt. I cooked it for 12 minutes which we thought was perfect and I added the balsamic when there was two minutes left so it would cook into the asparagus. I really enjoyed this and it was so easy, but next time I will add minced garlic before cooking for a little more flavor. thank you!

This was so easy and makes a nice presentation with the Balsamic drizzled over it. I put the Balsamic in a food squirt bottle and it made it easy to "squirt" the balsamic on the asparagus and plate in a nice design. Will make these again soon, thank you!
