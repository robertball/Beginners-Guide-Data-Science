This is a very luscious coconut ice cream.  The only thing I will do different next time is put the flaked coconut in the blender/processor with the milk and cream of coconut.  The flakes made the ice cream a bit chewy in texture.  Otherwise, this recipe is very easy and extra creamy.  For those reviewers that are saying theirs turned out icy or not sweet, there is a huge difference between cream of coconut and coconut milk.  It is like the difference between evaporated milk and sweetened condensed milk.  Two brands to look for in cream of coconut are "Coco Lopez" and "Coco Colada".

I've prepared this recipe two ways and both ways were excellent.  The first time I didn't have any cream of coconut.  *NOTE* Cream of Coconut IS NOT the same as coconut milk.  Substituting coconut milk for coconut cream would be like substituting evaporated milk instead of sweetened condensed milk.  That being said, since I didn't have coconut cream, I substituted with a (14oz) can of sweetened condensed milk instead and added 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of coconut extract.  It turned out excellent!  The second time I made it as directed.  Both times were delicious.

Coconut cream can be found in the mixer aisle of most supermarkets. It's used commonly in pina coladas. It is thick, syrupy, sticky, and extremely sweet. The coconut cream you often find next to coconut milk in Asian groceries is not what you want to use. Check the ingredients list for sugar.

Rich, creamy explosion of coconut flavor! This is also one of the easiest ice creams I've made as it calls for so few ingredients and no extra steps like cooking the custard or mixing and chopping. This is a lovely, pure white ice cream, easily adaptable to endless toppings or additions if you choose, though it is perfect just as is. For this occasion I just drizzled some chocolate syrup on the plate and added a few fresh raspberries and chopped chocolate covered almonds. I followed the recipe exactly as written, but chopped the coconut finely in my food processor. I added the coconut to the cream mixture and then let it steep its flavor into the mixture while chilling in the fridge for several hours. This is one of those few recipes that exceed your expectations.

Awesome ice cream.  It's also good, as one reviewer noted, with crushed pineapple added at the end.

Not to beat a dead horse, but if you use coconut cream or coconut milk instead of cream of coconut, you will surely be disappointed.  I used Coco Lopez cream of coconut.  I also omitted the optional flaked coconut for a smoother texture.

This ice cream was awesome.  Thanks!

I really like this ice cream. It's extremely simple and quick to make. There's no cooking a custard first, it's just mix and freeze. I, too, toasted the coconut first and I also added a pinch of salt. The biggest hint is to use the correct coconut cream, NOT milk. I used the Coco Lopez brand as suggested by ALBERTACF and it was right on! It is found in the mixers (alcohol) isle at your market. The kind you find in the Asian isle is coconut milk, at least at my market. Thanks, SueMB, for sharing this recipe and ALBERTACF for the clarification between the two (cream/milk)!

This recipe is off the hook good! I served it to dinner guests with a wedge of grilled fresh pineapple, and it was a big hit. The great thing is it looks very fancy, but is very easy!

I made this ice cream to have with grilled pineapple and it was fabulous.  I used skim milk because that is what I had and can't believe how rich and creamy this ice cream is.  I did add a tsp of vanilla extract and blended the flaked coconut in with the coconut cream/milk so as to make the pieces a little smaller.

This was great!!!  We just had coconut ice cream while on vacation and this was a perfect imitation...minus the tropical breezes, anyway:)  
I toasted the coconut and crushed it a little before I added it to everything else.  
I've had some problems with it freezing correctly-I think the biggest thing is to not the coconut til the end.  The high fat content makes freezing a little harder.
Thanks for a great recipe.

My family went nuts over this ice cream! It is the best coconut ice cream ever! It is the perfect amount for a Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker and it is so creamy, rich and coconutty! I used 1 cup heavy cream and 1 1/2 cups of half 'n half. I also left the flaked coconut out of the ice cream and toasted it and sprinkled it on top, heaven! It reached soft-serve consistensy in about 20 minutes. Love this recipe!

This was so easy and so good - its a very rich and creamy white ice cream-I followed the  recipe - the only thing I changed> was  I added a teasp of vanilla extract.I did blend the coconut flakes with milk and cococ lopez . I made it in my crusinart ice cram maker with frozen canister(  it was just right amount too and  I was worried since another viewer said it overflowed  and my  did not-it took 30 min  and was still a little soft a few hrs later -but so YUMMY! This is a very sweet -do not add any sugar--I might try it with  half and hald instead of whipping cream -I used 1% milk since that is what I had on hand. I will make again--and thanks for sharing your  recipe!

I made this yesterday, and when I tasted it a few hours ago, I was met, not with the taste of luscious, rich coconut ice cream like I was expecting, but with almost-flavorless and not-nearly-sweet-enough ice cream. There wasn't much coconut flavor (even after adding 1/2 teaspoon coconut extract) or much of any flavor, really (even after adding 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract). The taste wasn't bad, but definitely wasn't good, either. I know what you're thinking: "Oh, she used coconut milk and not cream of coconut like the recipe specifies," but you're wrong. I DID use cream of coconut, I even double-checked before using. Even after making it, I checked to see if I had accidentally used my coconut milk instead of my cream of coconut, and, nope, the coconut milk was still there. I'm not sure what went wrong. Was the cream of coconut rancid or something? Or was the brand of cream that I used just not good?

Mmm, creamy coconutty goodness.  Super easy to make, too!  I did add toasted coconut, because I had some left over from another recipe, and it was delicious.  I have one of those freeze-the-bowl kind of ice cream makers and I've had problems before with my ice cream maker not quite getting the ice cream firm enough.  So this time I froze the coconut cream mixture for about 30 minutes (stirring a couple times) to get it good and chilled before putting it in the ice cream maker, and voila!  Perfectly frozen ice cream after 12 minutes in the ice cream maker.

I just finished making this ice cream and it's sooo good.  I love the minimal ingredients and ease of preparing it.  I made sure to use cream of coconut as opposed to coconut milk.  I could not find it in my local grocery store so I went to wholefoods.  It was not in the asian aisle as I thought but in the hispanic food aisle.  I just thought that might help others find cream of coconut instead of coconut milk.  The only thing I changed is I used 1 cup of coconut flakes instead of 1 1/2.  I will make this many times over and can't wait to share this with my friends.

OMG!!  This is so good!  It is creamy and great coconut flavor.  My batch is still in my ice cream maker and is almost finished, but I just had to taste it.  It is wonderful.  I put all of the ingredients including the flaked coconut in my blender.  It was so easy.  I can't wait for the finished product.  I'll update my review later to let you know how it tastes, but I don't think I'll have any complaints.  Edited 07/14:  This is exactly the flavor I wanted.  I didn't find it overly sweet.  It tastes exactly like the coconut ice cream that was sold at the ice cream shop I worked at in college.  Thank you so much for the terrific recipe!

SO, SO EASY!!! Delicious and creammmmy. I only used 1/2 the coconut, chopped in a mini processor to avoid stringiness. The second time, I added a 20 oz can of crushed pineapple, well drained. Absolutely lovely ! =)

This was my first time making homemade ice cream and I chose this recipe because it looked so simple. I found the cream of coconut at the liquor store next to the other mixers. (It's the same stuff used in the "Coconut Poke Cake" recipe on this site). I did add the flaked coconut, but found it to be too chewy. I would recommend either grinding the coconut into smaller bits or just omitting it altogether. I also found this to be a very soft ice cream. Otherwise, this was a great recipe! I served it with my grandma's hot fudge sauce (recipe can be found in my recipe box) and toasted coconut on top.

Perfect and so creamy!  The cream of coconut will start to solidify when combined with the cold milk and heavy cream, so start with the cream of coconut and add the milk and cream slowly. I used the kitchenaid ice cream attachment and the recipe fit perfectly in it.

This is simply the best ice cream I've ever had. I followed the recipe precisely with no changes. It's rich and creamy and really flavorful. I drizzled each scoop with a simple dark chocolate granache and my guests went wild. As noted, you'll find Cream of Cocnut right next to all the other mixed drink ingredients at the grocery store.

Ack!!  Did anyone else notice that there is NO SUGAR in this recipe?  I didn't until it was too late. Maybe the other reviewers found coconut cream that was pre-sweetened but my can was not. The ice cream came out foul-tasting and extremely icy.

I left the flaked coconut out and oh my....it was really, really good!  Word got out that we had homemade ice cream and I had several boys in my kitchen just minutes ago.  I don't think much will be left!  If you are going to use the coconut, don't mix it in, just sprinkle it on top of each serving.  Drizzle a little chocolate sauce over the top for a very indulgent dessert.  Great tips by the other reviewers concerning cream of coconut versus coconut milk.  Make sure you've got the cream of coconut for this recipe.

I actually thought this ice cream was a little too sweet, but I admit it went down easily! I used only about 2/3 cup finely chopped coconut (processed in a mini-food processor) and found it to be plenty. I, too, think the recommended amount of stringy coconut would demand too much chewing. It's very nice with toasted coconut on top.

I agree with Tirgo, the recipe needs some sugar. I put toasted coconuts, almonds,chocolate shavings it was still lacking.I think it needs sugar,other than that it's decent and very easy. I have to change the rating to poor. I had some of the ice cream the next day, and I had to throw it out. It was the worst thing I have ever tasted!! It must have some sugar added ,I will try it again.

Best ice cream ever!  I've made it 2 times now and everyone loves it.  Second time I toasted the coconut and broke it into smaller pieces.  It's even better that way.  This is our new favorite and will be made over and over again.

I varied the recipe a little - a can of cream of coconut, 3 cups of fat free half and half and a splash of vanilla.  I made it in my KitchenAid ice cream maker.  Absolutely delicious!!!

I thought this was amazing, esp. with dove chocolate sauce on top! Warning, though, if you have the Cuisinart ice cream maker - this recipe overflowed, so next time I'm going to cut it in 1/2.

ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!  I used the Kitchen Aid iced-cream attachment and it came out perfectly.  Smooth, creamy, and delicious.  I did not have any coconut to put in but it did not matter.  It was very very delicious.  Use the Kitchen Aid attachment for 30 minutes until it starts creaming up to the top.  Then I transferred it into a plastic container for an overnight freeze.  VERY VERY nice... worth a repeat.

Excellent as is.  If you don't have/can't find the cream of coconut, sweetened condensed milk + coconut extract works beautifully.  I use this as the guide for all my homemade icecream now.

This was really a great and easy recipe. This ice cream was so creamy and stayed that way even when opened the next day. I though I would have to add an egg or two but i held off and stayed with the recipe. I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk and thought I would need to add sugar but the cocconut cream is so sweet it needed nothing more. I had an extra ounce of coconut cream so i added that. I also added the flaked coconut and I would maybe hold off a bit next time. I also think I will add less cream and more milk because 1) the cream gives you that funny film in your mouth and 2) i like my ice cream more like frozen yogurt texture. For a simple coconut ice cream recipe, this was really REALLY great. A must try!

Lots to like about this one--simple, easy & fast to put together, delish. Love ice cream recipes w/o the need to make an egg custard. I used UNsweetened coconut.  The ice cream is sweet enough w/o adding more 'sugar.' Also, stays scoopable after days in freezer, not hard like a rock. A keeper.

This is a perfect recipe for coconut ice cream. I have made it with and without coconut flakes, both are great.   For dessert at a dinner party serve this in a pretty glass or bowl with toasted coconut sprinkled on top, and stick a bite sized Mounds or Almond Joy candy in the top. Also, pass around a creamer with rum so guests can add their own. Even my friends that don't care for coconut loved this ice cream.

This was very tasty! I toasted the coconut and cooled it before adding the mixture. 1.5 cups of coconut was a little much for my Cuisinart ice cream maker to handle. I saved about 1/4 cup to sprinkle on the gelato later. I also used 2.5 cups of 2% milk. Next time I make this, I plan on using a little whole milk to get a thicker gelato out of the ice cream maker (although this froze to a nice, scoopable consistency right out of the freezer); and decreasing the amount of coconut.

This recipe is beyond delicious!  The end result is an out of this world creaminess and great coconut taste.  My suggestion is to chop the coconut prior to adding to the mixture.  This way you don't end up with long strands of coconut.  I've made this ice cream at least 10 times this summer. This will be a regular in our house.

This ice cream was incredibly good! I didn't add any coconut to it because I didn't have any. It wasn't missed, though, as the Coco Lopez had bits in it. Thanks for a new family favorite!

So good.  We had coconut ice cream at my daughter's wedding in Mexico and fell in love with it.  This is a quick easy way of making ice cream nearly as good.  My son-in-law LOVES it!

This recipe is heavenly! I was hesitant to add the coconut flakes at first but decided to follow what other reviewers recommended and toasted them. I found that it added wonderful texture and taste. I also used light cream instead of heavy cream. Delicious!

Fantastic!!!  I made the creamy coconut ice cream base then added in 1/2c. drained crushed pineapple and a couple of handfuls (1/2c. or so) toasted coconut the last 10 minutes. Did I mention the word "FANTASTIC?"!!!  Thanks!

Wow this ice cream is really delicious and refreshing. The flavor is not overwhelming, even though I added 1/2 teaspoon coconut extract and 1 teaspoon vanilla. I omitted the coconut but toasted some to sprinkle on top. I used 1% milk and half-and-half instead of cream. I would like to try it with pineapple to make pina colada ice cream. Very good!

Incredible.  Very refreshing and has a great sweet coconut taste.  I would assume that anyone claiming this recipe isn't sweet enough probably used coconut milk instead of cream of coconut.  don't make that mistake,follow the directions, and you will end up with  fantastic ice cream.

Great flavor and consistency with no effort!
Be sure to buy 'cream of coconut' which was a little harder for me to find, not 'coconut milk' which everybody seems to have.  I didn't have heavy cream so just used half and half, and it is fine.

This was my first batch of ice cream with my new Cuisinart ICE-21. I actually made two batches following several of the suggestions made by other reviewers. On the first batch, I put the cream of coconut, milk and flaked coconut in the blender to chop the coconut into smaller pieces. On the second batch, I toasted the coconut in the oven before blending the ingredients. I combined the cream with the blended mixtures and let them both steep in the fridge most of the day. I added mini chocolate chips to the toasted coconut batch. I was amazed that these two batches had completely different flavors. The un-toasted batch was more of a pure sweet flavor and the toasted added an extra layer of flavor that was a bit more on the savory side. The toasted batch was by far the favorite. We drizzled a little chocolate syrup over the ice cream and sprinkled some toasted coconut on top that we had reserved. For others that are using this 1.5 quart machine, I only used 3 to 3 1/2 cups of the mixture and my machine was full. This was better than any store bought ice cream that I've had!

I made this with the called ingredients, but I did try to use the blender to break up the coconut before I put it in the ice cream maker.  This didn't work for me so the ice cream had the flakes of coconut throughout. I think this ice cream had a great flavor, but I will try Elzira's advice next time about using coconut extract and sweetend condensed milk only because I would prefer the smooth texture!

Tasty recipe! I added shredded coconut, as well as, chopped macadamia nuts and added a couple swirls of hot fudge at the end. It reminded me of my favorite Lambert's Ice Cream flavor that you can only get on the islands. The cream of coconut is easy to find in the mixers section (usually with soda, where you can get margarita mix, grenadine, etc) of your local supermarket.
Thanks for the recipe!

I have had this before made by a friend, and it was great. Just be careful to STIR not whip, because otherwise you end up with flakey coconut-cream butter. It's kind of gross.

excellent ice cream - I'm making it once a week right now cause hubby and I LOVE it.  After it's been in the ice cream maker but before I harden the ice cream I add dollops of (cold) hot fudge and salted macadamias or toasted slivered almonds and gently swirl them in.  LOVE IT!

We made this as dessert for a Thai dinner.  Like others suggested, we blended the shredded coconut and then added the heavy cream. It was so easy to make! We served the ice cream with almond toffee brittle, and it was wonderfully, refreshing, light and flavorful.

I have been looking since 04 for coconut ice cream, and I have finaly found it.We had it in Mexico topped with a drizzle of kahlua. We added the  pineapple also and this is just great. Everyone who has had it here has liked it. Alone or with a topping. Thank you so much for sharing!

No better ice cream can be produced. Use the flaked coconut. This freezes up hard but creamy. If you like coconut, you will be astounded! (Oh, I added 1/2 teaspoon very good vanilla extract.)

This ice cream is luscious. I used a product called COCO REAL from Kroger. I found it in the mixers for drinks section of my store. It was a little difficult to get out of the container but I added the milk to the squeeze bottle it came in and shook it hard to get the last little bit out. It was 21 oz. instead of the 14oz. the recipe calls for but the ice cream still came out wonderful. I did not add coconut since I am going to serve this tomorrow with my son's Birthday cake. I am making a cake called hummingbird cake with loads of nuts and pineapple in it. It should be delicious. I made the ice cream today since from the reviews I read it gets better over time. I will freeze it hard in my ice cream freezer container. I used a Cuisinart frozen yogurt-ice cream-sorbet maker and the ingredients JUST fit. I highly recommend this recipe and am grateful for all of the wonderful suggestions offered by other reviewers. Yummmy

I left out the flaked coconut so the whole batch would fit in my ice cream machine, but this was still perfect without it.  The texture is smooth and creamy and it is very flavorful.  Excellent with toasted coconut on top.

This is a great recipe.  To make it even better I take a Dove Dark Chocolate candy bar (or 5 small pieces) and shave it with a knife and add that to the final five minutes of freezing time - don't use chocolate chips -they are too waxy when frozen - dove remains smooth.  This is truly like a mounds bar.

I really liked this recipe, but adding that much coconut was a little too much.  It settled to the bottom, so some people really got a large mouth full of coconut.  (Not that that's a bad thing--I love coconut!)  Next time I make this ice cream, I'll either reduce the amount of coconut or remove it completely and add it as sprinkles to enhance the great flavor.  

GREAT RECIPE!  Thank you!

Love this recipe. I don't know how previous reviewers can say that this isn't sweet enough. I made pina colada ice cream by adding a can of well-drained, crushed pineapple towards the end of the freezing process. YUM!!!

Everyone LOVED this ice cream. Like someone else said, you have to make sure you use cream of coconut and not coconut milk. If you don't like it quite so sweet, add Hersheys Special Dark chocolate, chopped. It cut down the sweetness and made it taste like a Mounds candy bar.

The flavor is decent, but it never got frothy in the ice cream mixer. It set in the freezer solid, as though someone left the ice cream out to melt and threw it back in the freezer. It makes it very difficult to scoop.

This ice cream is Awesome!  I've never had homemade ice cream turn out so smooth and creamy.  As one reviewer did, I blended the sweetened flaked coconut in the blender.  Next time I may add a little vanilla, just for added richness!  But it's perfect!

This ice cream turned out great IF you are sure that the freezer bowl is frozen solid and your ingredients are VERY cold,even partially frozen (1 hour in the freezer will do fine!)I only used about 1/2 cup of coconut that I ran through my mini chopper and I added a tad bit of vanilla extract at the very end. Without a doubt I will be making this again!

Thick, rich and very sweet ice cream.  Found Goya makes cream of coconut too but it wasn't quite as delicious as Coco Lopez?  Tried it with shredded organic coconut the first time and it was too chewy, as the other reviewers said.  Then added in halved macadamia nuts for the second batch and let it soften before serving it at a dinner party.  People were in heaven!  They actually thought about getting an ice cream maker after tasting it and a David Lebovitz Aztec "hot" (spcy) chocolate ice cream that accompanied it.  Tastes super with homemade white chocolate sauce and whipped cream on top.

This was good, but the shredded coconut was a little over the top with the cream of coconut. And I LOVE coconut! I tried to find coconut extract, but wasn't successful. I think I'd use that next time.

I have made this recipe twice already. It is absolutely delicious! I cannot find cream of coconut in any of the local supermarkets in my area so I have use coconut milk instead. I also substituted the milk for half and half and added 1/2 can of sweetened condensed milk.  The only problem I  found with this recipe is that  the ice cream is not very soft so I need to leave it at room temperature for a while before serving it... But it is way worth the flavor! If anybody has been successful at making this ice cream creamy please let me know.... Thanks and enjoy this great recipe!!!

This turned out really well.  I was hoping it would take like the cocont ice cream I had while honeymooning in Mexico; it was close.  I mistakenly used light coconut milk instead of cream of coconut. I'm assuming cream of coconut has sugar in it. B/c I used coconut milk I had to add sugar. I added about a cup, could have used a bit more, but it is still delish!

Are you kidding me?!  This is the easiest ice cream I have ever made - no raw eggs or cooked eggs in it.  I was not sure how good the texture would be without them but it's the bomb-diggidy if you like coconut!  By far the easiest ice cream recipe on the planet - thanks a bunch!!!

This was the very first recipe bf wanted to try in our new ice cream maker but I didn't have cream of coconut.  We went to the store last night and picked up a couple of cans.  Voila!  Coconut ice cream!  :o)  I also picked up sweetened flaked coconut bc I had the unsweetened only.  I got a bit distracted while making this and put in the unsweetened coconut instead.  Bf was a bit put out until he tasted it and told me that it didn't need sweetened coconut; it's sweet enough.  I processed the coconut in the food processor with the rest of the ingredients but should have done that first, emptied out the food processor, and processed everything else bc it was still pretty big.  However, all in all, bf was thrilled with this ice cream.  I liked it too--nice and creamy and so simple.  Thanks for the recipe!

The coconut flavor of this ice cream is great!  The only problem I had was there still being little "chunks" of the coconut cream in the ice cream after finished.  I did use the wisk with my mixer to mix all the ingredients first, but there were still little pieces of the coconut cream.  Next time I would really mix the coconut cream seperately first to make sure it was very smooth.  Other than that it is great!

Absolutely wonderful although I really think that toasting the coconut is must.  I gets rid of the chewiness and really brings out the flavor.

This is seriously the best thing I have ever tasted.  I have no control over myself when it comes to eating this ice cream!  I refer to myself as a coconut fanatic and this comes in #1.  I toasted the coconut, because it seemed like a good suggestion and haven't tried it any other way, because I like the texture it gives.  Try it!  You'll like it!

GREAT recipe!!  I modified slightly from the recipe based on other comments.  I mixed it all in the blender (including the coconut).  When the churn stopped, I added some crushed pineapple and started the churn back up to incorporate it.  I also added some blue food coloring to make it a "Blue Hawaiian"!

This is excellent! Top it with a little hot fudge sauce and it tastes like a mounds bar. I didn't use the toasted coconut because we prefer our ice cream smooth but i did add half a tsp. of coconut extract.

oh yeah, this is yummy.  Creamy, coconutty deliciousness.  We leave the shredded coconut out of the ice cream and serve it on top! ( We like the ice cream smooth).  Excellent with the coconut raspberry dream bars from this site.

Mmmmmm.... This ice cream is so good! Creamy and especially wonderful with a couple of additions. I added 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1/4 tsp. of coconut extract. I toasted the flaked coconut and will serve as a topping instead of mixing in. This will be gone in no time around here! Thanks for the recipe!

Very, very good. I topped it with some rich fudge dessert sauce and some chopped toasted almonds- it tasted just like an Almond Joy candy bar!! Like another reviewer stated, next time I am going finely chop the coconut before adding to the mixture.  Simple to prepare, and unbelievably creamy, this is the perfect dessert ice cream!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

We love this!  It is so nice and creamy.  It's a little extra sweet, though.  The last few times we've made it, we omitted the extra sugar and it was even better.

Heaven! I'm in Heaven! This recipe is wonderful. I have been drooling over a dessert at one of my favorite thai restaurants of sticky rice with coconut ice cream. I was able to recreate it at home with this great recipe. Thanks SUEMB!

Super easy recipe and tastes really good! I bought cream of coconut from Trader Joe's and added 3/4 cup sugar. I think it could actually get away with a little bit less sugar than that. The recipe was too much for my Cuisinart ice cream maker so next time I need to reduce it a little bit. I noticed with egg-less recipes the consistency isn't as thick/firm. I am able to scoop it but it melts in your mouth very quickly.

This is exactly what I was looking for.... and I can't believe how easy this recipe is to make.  I was originally looking for a coconut pineapple ice cream recipe, but thought I would first look for just a coconut ice cream recipe.  When I saw a couple of the reviews that mentioned adding in crushed pineapple, I decided to try it too.  I made the recipe exactly as written, but right before pouring into my Cuisinart ice cream machine, I added a 20 ounce can of crushed pineapple (I bought the kind in juice, not syrup) .  But first I used my wire mesh strainer to drain the pineapple juice off the pineapple, and I pressed the pineapple gently to make sure it wasn't too wet before I added it to the creamy coconut mixture.  I didn't want the extra liquid to ruin the recipe results.  I turned on the machine and poured in all but a cup of the mixture.  The pineapple adds volume so I was afraid it may overflow if I poured all of it in.  After about 20 minutes it was thickened nicely.  I put it into a quart ice cream carton (I bought a bunch of these online - they are perfect for storing your ice cream - you know the white cardboard round ones with the lids).  Into the freezer it went.  Of course, there was a bit left over that my husband and I divided up and ate immediately - it was every bit as delicious as the coconut pineapple ice cream we had at a fancy ice creamery in Florida!!  Absolutely amazing flavor - this one does not disappoint with weak flavors.

I was not satisfied with the texture and flavour of this recipe the first time I made it. I had dissolved the creamed coconut in hot water (I didnt use the canned variety, but instead the boxed) and this made the ice cream more icy and flavourless. I adjusted the recipe to 1.5 cups milk; 1.5 cups half and half; 1 x 170 g box Grace Pure Creamed Coconut; .5 cup toasted coconut; dash of almond extract; dash of white vanilla extract. This made an improvement in the recipe.

I still need to play with this recipe to give it more flavour and use the heavy cream to see if it will make the ice cream more creamy in texture.

This is a very good recipe. I am planning to pair it with homemade piña colada ice cream topping! Remember that there is a difference between coconut cream and cream of coconut. Cream of coconut is very sweet and used in piña coladas. Coconut cream has NO sugar just like coconut milk. I recommend tasting it first if you are not sure which you have. If it isn't sweet, then you have the wrong kind for this recipe.

Both my fiancée and I agree this was one of the best Iced Creams we have ever had. And it was so incredibly simple. Better than any store bought by far. The only thing I did different was that I toasted the sweetened coconut a little bit. It was awesome. This time I am going to add some fresh pineapple chunks. Yumm!!!!! Btw, maybe try some chocolate chips and almond slivers for a frozen/creamy Mounds candy bar. Ohhh, maybe I will try that instead of the pineapple.

This recipe is bomb dignity It was so simple to make and I couldn't wait for the churning process to end to taste because I didn't add any sugar.  It was sweet and creamy full of coconut flavor.  I don't understand why some of the reviewers said not sweet and no coconut flavor so sorry to say they are absolutely wrong.  I added the mounds coconut in the food processor like one of the reviewers noted and it did made it creamy and I stirred in heavy whipping cream.  Now waiting for the final process to chill will give you an update when it finishes.

Oh my heavens this ice cream is delightful! (Or *was*, considering it's gone already & I only just made it last night!) I tweaked the recipe a tad due to not having the exact ingredients on hand (& due to impatience), and I will make it the exact same way next time:
1 1/4 cup fat-free milk
1 1/4 cup regular whipping cream (not whipped)
14 fl oz cream of coconut (squeeze bottle found in drink mixers section)

Blended *everything* together in blender (misread original recipe directions). Let mixture chill *maybe* 10-15 minutes in fridge, probably less. Let it churn in ice cream maker for about 30-40 minutes max. Ate some incredibly delicious but super soft ice cream, & threw rest in freezer over night. PERFECT. (Even the hottie at work thought so!)

This is the bomb. And best of all, is to add 1  to 1 1/2cups of puree strawberries to it. I can't stop making it .I have it in my freezer all the time. Pineapple is good but, but strawberry cocoanut cream ice cream, is heavenly.

This is probably one of the best coconut ice creams that I have tried so far. I tried the recipe without the coconut flakes as I enjoy a creamy, not crunchy ice cream. It is sweet enough with a delicious, subtle coconut flavor to it. It is incredibly creamy, yet very refreshing. I would love to use it to top an upside down pineapple cake or add cake pieces to it. My hubby and daughter attacked it right away. GREAT RECIPE, MUST TRY IT!!!

Awesome!  "Goya" brand makes a great cream of coconut.  Also, if there is Trader Joe's in your area, some of the stores plan to carry cream of coconut soon.  TJ's also carries heavy cream (not just heavy whipping cream) which can be a challenge to find as well.  Very easy and delicious.

This was my first adventure into homemade ice cream and I am impressed!  Although I do not have an ice cream maker, I really wanted to try this recipe.  I perused the internet and found a helpful article on making ice cream without a maker.  Other than not using an ice cream maker, I followed the recipe precisely.  The ice cream has a solid coconut flavor, yet, is not overpowering.  The consistency of my ice cream was more thick than "regular" ice cream, perhaps this was due to hand mixing rather than using an ice cream maker.

I made it almost exactly as the recipe said; my only changes:  I added the flaked coconut in the food processor to chop it up more finely, and I added just a little bit of coconut extract.  The ice cream has a nice coconut flavor -- yummy!

I added dark chocolate-covered almonds and slightly less flaked coconut.  Also, someone else said it but I'll say it again: if you are having trouble finding cream of coconut, try looking in the alcoholic drink mixers section - that's where it was in my supermarket!  This was a bit less creamy than cooked ice creams I've made - but a LOT easier, too!  I thought this was very very good, and it got lots of compliments at a party.  I will definitely make it again!

My husband loved it!  I mistakenly misread the recipe for the amount of coconut required--added more (14 oz).  I placed everything in the processor as suggested by a few reviewers and substituted milk with half & half and whipping cream.  Definitely coconut ice cream, better than I've had in the past but next time, less coconut for sure!

Perfect! The texture, sweetness, everything about this recipe is perfect. And easy! I ran my flaked coconut through my food processor to get it a little finer. We topped this with toasted almonds and chopped dark chocolate tonight, but it's also perfect on it's own. Thanks for the recipe!

Simple and Great!  I did not add the flaked coconut and for that reason I think it came out smooth and creamy with a mild - almost subtle, and refreshing coconut flavor.

This was outstanding!  A big hit with all of my guests!  The can of cream of coconut I used was 15 ounces which made it too sweet, but the flavor was delicious, and now I know how to tweak it in the future.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe. I used it to make my Almond Joy Brownie Sundays. The only thing I changed was I added chopped chocolate covered almonds at the end when ice cream was almost done. I will continue to make this great ice cream.

WOW! This is the easiest and best ice cream ever! 
I wanted something unique for an ice cream churn off we had on the 4th of July.  This recipe won for best tasting and I still get compliment from folks around town. We served it with optional crushed pineapple or mini M&M topping.

This recipe was delicious.  My only alteration was to use half and half instead of heavy whipping cream and just a small handful of the shredded coconut.  I made it in one of the two quart counter ice cream makers where you just freeze the bucket.  The consistency was perfect and not too rich.  Next time I will try it with pineapple for a pina colada taste.  Will definitely make this again.

My husband and I tasted coconut ice cream while on our honeymoon in St. Vincent and the Grenadines.  This recipe is as close as I can imagine one being to what we had...just creamier.  =)  I have to reduce the amounts of cream and coconut a little to keep the mix from overflowing my ice cream maker.

This ice cream was delicious - if anything, I would reduce the amount of shredded coconut by 1/2 cup just so that it's not so dense in every bite.  i served this with a key lime bundt cake and my guests raved!!!

Wow. This is literally the best homemade ice cream I've ever had. Granted, I love coconut but even my fiance raved about it and he's not a coconut freak like me. The only change I made was toasting the coconut first. It is awesome! Thanks for sharing it.

One word....YUMMY!  Wow,was this good.  I did put a splash of vanilla and used everything full fat!  It is as good or better than the Hagan Daas Coconut Gelato that I loved and they stopped making.  WIll be serving it with chocolate cake.  This is soooooo good.  Especially for coconut lovers.

I doubled the recipe, because I love coconut ice cream.  I used Coco Lopez brand cream of coconut which I found in the alcoholic beverage section of the grocery store.  I didn't see 14 oz cans,  so I used 15 oz cans and the end result was not overly sweet.  It was perfect.  I omitted the coconut flakes because my son doesn't like chewing on coconut.  I think it's the dry texture of the coconut that he doesn't like.  Because of this he says he doesn't like coconut, but I am determined to give him a positive coconut flavor experience!   I love the combination of pineapple with my coconut flavor, so I also did the following:  In a small sauce pan, over medium heat, I dumped two 8oz cans of crushed pineapple with their juice.  I used two, because I doubled the recipe. I added 2 tablespoons of sugar  (one per can, if not doubling recipe) and 1 teaspoon of cornstarch (half a tsp if not doubling).  I reduced it a bit, stirring frequently, till a (chunky) syrup consistency.  Then I put this pineapple mixture in a plastic dish, in the refrigerator, uncovered until cool to the touch. I added this to the ice cream maker about half way through the churning process, just to incorporate.  (If you use a can of crushed pineapple and drain it and add that to the ice cream, you may get icy bits or crystallization of the pineapple juices, and it can be an unpleasant texture in your otherwise creamy coconut ice cream.  The cornstarch adds a type of jelly-ness that will freeze much nicer and will

I love this recipe - no cooking and super easy!  First, chill all the liquid ingredients - it helps the ice cream set up.  Next, put the coconut flakes (I used 1 cup of unsweetened) in the blender and blend until the coconut is the texture of corn meal - do this so your ice cream isn't chewy.  Add the liquid ingredients.  Chilled cream of coconut will separate and solidify so don't be surprised.  Also, I used 2 cups of heavy cream rather than just 1.5 cups.  This made the ice cream smoother.  Blend it all together, transfer to your ice cream maker, and voila!  Perfect coconut ice cream.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Making this even as I write!    Wanted to use up some cream that was getting old, so I used all heavy cream with the creme of coco and the coconut.   Spectacular!  BTW...You'll know you have the right coconut product when you open it.   If it isn't very syrupy and sweet...stop!   The creme of coco is just sweetened condensed milk that happens to be made with coconut.    If you have any doubts you can do what someone else did.   Use an equal amount of regular sweetened condensed milk with some coconut extract.

I had a can of Coco Lopez lite hanging around so used it for this. Left out the coconut. Served Almond Joy-ish. Scooped ice cream and drizzled with ganache then sprinkled with toasted chopped almonds and toasted coconut. Delish! EDIT: Made again with full fat Coco Lopez and just half and half. Worked great.

I just made this tonight.  It was absolutely delicious!  It was creamy and smooth texture.  Next time I want to add either pineapple at the end or swirl some dark chocolate sauce into it, yum!  The flavor is full and super coconutty.  I opted to leave out the shredded coconut as I don't like the chewy texture.

I think the people that made it used either coconut milk or coconut cream instead of CREAM OF COCONUT.  They are NOT the same thing.  Cream of Coconut is found with the mixers in the wine/beer section of grocery stores, and is a pre-sweetened coconut mixture used as the base of pina coladas and the like.  If you used coconut milk or coconut cream instead, there is no sugar in this and it will not only not be sweet, but it will have minimal flavor and will turn very icey with tons of crystals after sticking the container into the freezer to harden because of the excess water content.

This coconut ice-cream is good if you are looking for an ice-cream that tastes like whipping cream, with a little coconut kick.  I slightly toasted the coconut and blended it in a food processor with the other ingredients so the coconut was pretty fine. I prefer the flavor of the Best Vanilla Ice Cream on this site made with half and half.

I have been craving ice cream lately, but I'm vegan, and the closest source of vegan ice cream to me is 135 miles away, and I can't buy vegan ice cream and get it home.  SO... I made this recipe but subbed So Delicious vanilla coconut milk (the kind for drinking/cereal) for the cream and milk.  I used the cream of coconut and the full amount of flaked coconut, which I left whole.  This stuff is SOOOO good.  I couldn't stop stealing bites out of the top of my Cuisinart as it froze.

I love coconut ice cream and this is by far the BEST recipe i have used, for a lighter ice cream i use light cream instead of heavy and it's still good. I recommend this recipe to friends all the time!

Very yummy.  Easy to make.  I left out the coconut and just mixed everything else in a bowl and put it in my ice cream maker.  While it was churning I toasted the coconut and we used it as a topping with some crushed pineapple.

This was really rich,  almost too rich.  It never did freeze in the ice cream maker.  After 2 hours we put it in the freezer, and the  next morning we had breakfast ice cream.  Fun!

This is so easy to make; no cooking required!  I added some mini chocolate chips and now my boyfriend wants it for dessert every night!  I'm debating whether to make it without the flaked coconut...it takes a little effort on the chewing end.  The cream of coconut was a little hard to find; I finally found it in the "exotic foods" section of our local chain supermarket.

Really really yumm! This is a great simple recipe and took me 5 minutes to prepare. I toasted the shredded coconut on my stove top and cut it in half and it was STILL a lot for me, but otherwise great! This is a keeper!

Wow! Smooth, creamy, dreamy! Everything a homemade treat should be! Definitely not low fat or low calorie, but a small serving of this delectable treat goes a long way. I was able to find the cream of coconut in a lighter version at my local Wal-Mart in the mixers section. Didn't even know they made a lighter version! Noticed no difference in the flavor or consistency. This is my husbands all-time favorite dessert!

I made this and it was so GREEEAATTT.  I think that the next time I try it I will toast the coconut or mix half toasted and half not.  Just because some don't like the chewyness of the coconut, but as for me I loved it.

I wish I could give 4.5 stars becuase it was almost perfect.  This was very very good.  I didn't use the flaked coconut at all because I don't like the chewy texture of it in ice cream, but I did everything else the same. My grocery store was out of heavy cream so I had to use whipping cream.  After frozen this was just ever so slightly icy.  Next time I will skip the milk and use all heavy cream and I think it will be PERFECT.  I used Goya brand Cream of coconut. Delicious.

Delicious Recipe. Very Easy to make and it tastes just fantastic!  It was not too sweet.  I toasted the walnuts and the coconut shavings and it really tasted great.  Next time, i'll try it just plain.

Very, very good.  The family loved it.  If only I could find Coco Lopez for cheap!  One star knocked off because the coconut ice cream served at the Thai restaurant in my neighborhood still has the edge, if only slightly!

This ice cream was so good!  I was amazed at how easy it was too.  I added the flaked coconut to the food processor as well and it was a good consistency.  It wasn't "icy" at all.  I added chocolate chips to it, and then ate most of it within two days.  I will be making this all the time!!

This recipe is amazing! It was the best ice cream I've ever had. I added 1 cup of mini chocolate chips and it was fantastic! Everyone in my family loved it. Plus, it took about 5 minutes to make... So Easy & NO BAKE!!! Next time I will use a little less coconut flakes. I think one cup would be plenty especially once I added the chocolate chips.

I have been making my own ice cream for about 6 months now and this is the best recipe I have found. We LOVE it. It is better a few days later, seems to get sweeter and even more creamy. I followed the recipe exactly. I toasted Macadamia nuts and coconut and sprinkled on top for garnish. Try it you love it!

Fantastic! I omitted the flakes (didnt care to have the distraction while enjoying creamy icecream). I was worried about sweetness level, so I added 1/2 cup of cane sugar. And it came out great. Still not sweet enough for hubby but he was still impressed. The texture is awesome.

I will definitely make this again.

I made this two nights ago and my only complaint is that it didn't harden enough in the ice cream maker.  Put the leftovers in the freezer and last night is was wonderful!  Next time I may add a little more cream and milk cause the coconut was a bit strong for us, but that is more of a personal preference than anything.  Thanks for the easy, great tasting recipe!

This ice cream is wonderful! I substituted a package of frozen coconut and put it into blender with the milk and cream of coconut. I serve it with toasted chopped pecans on top. It is so rich and creamy - it's our new favorite ice cream!!

Love this ice cream, as does anyone who tries it!  Didn't add the coconut flakes because I don't like the texture of it.  Next time, I will try part milk/part cream instead of all cream as it was a little heavy...but oh so good.

This recipe is simple but incredibly good.  I left out the flaked coconut and sprinkled on toasted coconut after the ice cream was frozen.  I served it atop banana pancakes and it was a huge hit.

yum. used lactose-free milk and soy creamer, so my ice cream isn't as creamy as yours, but this was still delicious. added the coconut and some mini chocolate chips to the serving dishes. will definitely make it again!

I Lu-lu-LOVE  this recipe!  ever was much of a coconut girl but this ice cream changed me for good!  I recommend cutting large pieces of a mounds bar and putting it in the bottom of your dish for an extra zing for chocolate lovers.  I do that rather than use the flaked coconut (not a fan of the texture)

OMG!!! I have now made this three different times. The first time I got too excited about it and failed to make sure my ice cream bowl was fully frozen. I ended up having to do the freezer way by pulling it out and stirring it every 15 minutes. The flavor was amazing! I then made this the right way for a friend's dinner party and blended the coconut flakes. It was raved about! The last time my boyfriend said he wanted it without the flakes and I added a little vanilla to it. It turned out soooo well we ate it in two days! A friend of mine has requested this for her b-day "cake" Can't wait to have some more!

Since we only had coconut cream in the pantry we melted 1/2 cup sugar in the milk then combined all and followed the directions.  Next time would be to use very finely chopped coconut...ours was very chunky.  Delish!  Would make this again and again

This ice cream is awesome!  I had some left over cream from another recipe and wanted to use it up.  Looking around for an ice cream recipe, came across this one.  I had all the ingredients on hand so I decided to give it a try.  Super easy and super delicious.  My husband was eating out of the canister as I was packing into a container, talk about licking the bowl.  This is a keeper!

My family loved it.  I toasted about 1 cup of sweetened, flaked coconut before adding it.  It is very sweet - perfect after a Thai dinner.

Great recipe!  Only thing I did differently was add a tsp of coconut extract to make sure the coconut flavor was strong enough.  Got rave review from the whole family.  Everyone said it was better than anything you could buy in the grocery store, and I agree!

This was so easy and so good!  Used this recipe the first time I used my small ice cream maker (the kind with the frozen canister)and it turned out sweet and creamy with just the right amount of coconut flavor for my family.  I'll be making this all the time!  So much easier and quicker than my big ice cream freezer (that uses rock salt & ice), and the recipe is better than any I've used before -- no beating, no cooking-- Just mix, pour, and push the "on" button.  Also very good with shaved chocolate added or a mashed bananna.

This recipe is SO EASY and fabulous. My boyfriend really does not like coconut and is an ice cream expert and he says that this is one of the BEST ice creams he has ever tasted.  We added mini marshmallow and chocolate chips and he thinks it made it even yummier! Thanks for a great recipe.

If you follow the recipe you will make a deliciously creamy ice cream.  I made this recipe in my breville ice cream maker and it was outstanding.  I took the advice of another reviewer and actually blended my coconut pieces in with all the ingredients and it came out great.  The ice cream is great on its own, or you can make tasty ice cream sandwiches with it. I used an oatmeal raisin cookie with mine, but the combinations could be endless depending on your creativity and taste.

This was the hit of the summer. I do not put coconut shavings in the ice cream though. We prefer toasted coconut on top.

This is the easiest ice cream recipe I've tried so far, so simple and it comes out great.  I threw everything all at once into the blender and gave it a whirl.   This is not creamy because of the shredded coconut  but just  top it with a hot fudge sauce and it's just like a frozen mounds bar.  Delish!

This is by far the best coconut ice cream I’ve had Ben & Jerry’s coconut almond chip, RIP, and when I was a little girl, Baskin Robbins coconut chip (nobody I know remembers that they had one, I don’t get it. If you love coconut like I ALWAYS have, one would remember that delicious ice cream, yet people think I’m bonkers). The only thing I did was add chocolate chunks. Unbelievable!! Made it soooooo many times, as I LOVE coconut. Thick, rich, and creamy. Better than anything you could buy, and I know, I’ve tried them all. But also, nothing takes the place of homemade ice cream.

I love the subtle flavor of coconut in this ice cream.  The flavor is delicate and not like the sickly sweet mess you purchase from a manufacturer.

Note:  I consider the shredded coconut a necessity and not an "option".  I made this recipe with the shredded coconut and  cannot imagine this ice cream without it.

I couldn’t find a sweetened coconut cream so I bought the unsweetened so I had some sugar maybe not enough but it was still good! The flakes of coconut are a must to make your ice cream more authentic!

Love this ice cream!! This is my second time, this time I left out the coconut because we like it smooth. Super ice cream to make when you don’t have time to cook & cool a traditional custard ice cream. We added a teaspoon of coconut extract to up the coconut flavor. We sprinkle it with coconut when we serve. Yummy!!

It just tasted like heavy cream to me and I added tons of toasted coconut flakes to the top. It was a disappointment.

Absolutely delicious.  I really didn't expect it to be good since there are no eggs or sugar.  Believe me it is perfectly creamy and sweet.  I did put the coconut in blender first as others mentioned.

I made a second time without the heavy cream since my Granddaughter can not have dairy.  I just used another can of coconut cream.  It was wonderful.

The way it is described here, just blend and stir everything together didn’t work with our ice cream maker, I tried two times but both times the liquid got stuck to the walls of ice cream maker & the blade and didn’t let it to turn ... unsuccessful

I made the recipe as stated. It. Was bland. Next time I will cut down the coconut to 1cup and add 1/4-1/2 cup of sugar. A little rum extract (so freezing isn't an issue) would be awesome for a little more flavor. I will try again!

This is a nice simple recipe that tastes great. It's creamy and sweet. I absolutely love coconut,  but the full cup and a half of shredded coconut gives it too much texture.  Next time I'll probably only add half of that.  Flavor is perfect though.

My husband loves this ice cream, it's better than what you can buy at the grocery store.  The only change I made was to reduce the amount of coconut to 1 cup.

I couldn't find the cream of coconut so I followed another user's suggestion and used 14 oz sweetened condensed milk and 1 1/2 t. coconut extract. It was the best coconut ice cream I have ever had. I will try it next time with the coconut flakes. I didn't use them this time because a person in our group doesn't like the flakes only the flavor.

Tastes great but I would highly recommend letting the mixture chill overnight to get to proper temp before attempting to put in your ice cream maker. Churned for 25 mins and still didn't want to even come close to soft serve. Had to stop since I didn't want butter with all the heavy cream. Hope it sets up harder in the freezer ! It really tastes great tho !!

It was too sweet for me so I added more milk and aside from the cream of coconut I also added coconut milk , coconut meat strings, chocolate sprinkles, and sliced almonds while on the ice cream maker machine. Turned out so delicious!  I'll be making it again with the changes in the recipe.

Didn't have heavy cream so used half & half and added 1 whole vanilla bean, scraping the seeds into the mixture for more flavor. It was very good but I felt a bit on the sweet side, perhaps because I didn't use heavy cream? I'll definitely make this again but will use unsweetened coconut to cut back on the too sweet flavor and will use half & half again to cut back on the fat content & calories. As another reviewer suggested I added the shredded coconut to the blender to chop it up into smaller pieces. One additional change I plan to make next time is to reduce the amount of shredded coconut by at least half as I thought 1-1/2 cups was too much and took away some from the creamy texture.

That just hit the spot. I'm pregnant and was absolutely craving coconut ice cream. I didn't even have cream or flakes, but I didn't care. I was desperate. I used whole milk and a little evaporated milk. As for the coconut part - I had a can of unsweetened coconut cream from Trader Joe's. If you're not sure which you have, just look the ingredients list. I was glad mine was unsweetened because I could control the sweetness and type of sweetener. I added 1/4 cup plus about 1 T. honey, and for me it was the perfect sweetness. I felt I could indulge more since I wasn't using refined sugar, and it wasn't overly sweet. Next time I'll try it with the cream, and I'm sure it will be richer and even more delicious. I imagine I'll make it over and over again for the next 6 months, and my baby might be a coconut fan like me. :)

Made this ice cream.  I could not get Cream of Coconut so used coconut milk instead and sweetened with 1/2 cup of icing sugar and a teas of vanilla ( I use pure valnile from Mexico only) .  Lets just say I licked the beaters of the ice cream maker clean.  Will definitely make this often.  It's nice knowing what goes into the food you eat.

This ice cream was so delicious! I ground up some semi sweet chocolate chunks and added it at the end which made it taste like mounds bar ice cream. Next time I will add some almonds and call it Almond Joy ice cream! Will definitely make again.

Really good stuff.  The first time I made this had a big mistake - used Trader Joe's Coconut Cream, which is thick and creamy but not sweet, so after tasting while mixing, did a rush fix by adding agave syrup which wasn't cold.  That seemed to throw off my Kitchen Aid enough that it didn't set up well until after @2-3 hours of freezer time.  I also added store-bought toasted coconut flakes about 15 minutes into the stirring process.  The ice cream was great tasting (We liked the toasted coconut in the texture) despite the near miss of using Coconut Cream rather than Cream of Coconut, such as Coco Lopez.  Have followed directions with the right stuff since then and it is a fun flavor change from vanilla.

Read the reviews so made a few modifications. Added touch vanilla extract, pinch salt and ground up coconut in food processor. All these suggestions are right on target. I also used a stick blender to incorporate ingredients as well as whip in some air to the mix. I used Coco Lopez and thought it was a bit too sweet. Good but sweet for my taste.

This is our all time favorite ice cream that we've made for several years.  We've made it with different add-ins and our favorite has become the one we where we use frozen coconut and 1/2 cup chopped macadamia nuts added to the mix after blending the liquids.  We get rave reviews anytime this one is served!!

Although I omitted the flaked coconut, this ice cream turned out amazing. For convenience while having a cookout, I prepared the ingredients about three hours early. I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to combine, poured into my ice cream maker bowl and refrigerated until we were almost ready for dessert. 30 minutes later, we had homemade coconut ice cream. I served with homemade blueberry pie and my family loved it!

I used coconut milk instead of cow milk and half and half instead of heavy cream. Watching calories. Worked out great! I, too, recommend tossing the shredded coconut into the food processor for a smoother ice cream.

This was the first ice cream I made in the new kitchenaid attachment and we enjoyed it. We didn't add coconut into the batter but I liked it with a drizzle of chocolate syrup and plenty of toasted coconut on top. With mine the batter needs to chill (in the freezer for a half hour to an hour) before you put it in the ice cream maker.

UPDATE: I made this recipe for the second time and it was flavorless. Really disappointing. I realize that it matters what kind of Coconut Cream you use. DO NOT use the Trader Joe's version -- this is bland as all heck. Taste the cream and make sure it is sweet before you make this recipe. I think last time I just went to a store that mostly sold south american products and it came out great!  

OLD REVIEW:
This recipe is amazing! Anyone who is complaining about it, probably didn't follow the directions and used coconut milk or water instead of cream. Use coconut cream! And definitely put in the flaked coconut (found in any supermarket next to the chocolate chips!). I was truly surprised  at how creamy this ice cream came out without cooking it like a custard. I was also surprised at how sweet and delicious it came out without adding any sugar.  Plus, it is so easy. I'm going to make it again and again.

I used Coco Real brand cream of coconut in a white squeeze bottle, got it in the liquor section, with the mixers. It's thick and sweet...if it's not, you have the wrong coconut product. However, mine came in a 21 ounce bottle, so I had to guess how much to use. I added about 1 1/3 cups and the ice cream was just a little bit on the sweet side,  that combined with the addition of Baker's sweetened angel flake coconut. (I put about 1 cup coconut in Ninja/food processor and buzzed it to about half size to lessen final chewiness). Next time I'll go with 1 cup cream of coconut and a teaspoon of coconut extract and see how it turns out. I also stirred 1/2 cup each of chopped pecans, walnuts and sliced almonds at the end, they gave a nice crunch and helped offset the sweetness, which was not overpowering, just a tad too sweet. It tasted like Baskin Robbins Nutty Coconut. A flavor explosion in your mouth, my husband said. For those who said it didn't turn out, you did used the wrong ingredients, please don't slam a good recipe by giving it one star because you changed ingredients. The recipe does not use sugar because the cream of coconut is sweet enough. Excellent recipe.

It was a bit sweeter than I like my ice creams. I think less cream of coconut or more heavy cream might make this better.

Just tried this recipe and my family loved it! I did tweak it a little because I didn't have what the recipe called for exactly. I used 2 1/2 cups half and half, cream of coconut, and scant 1/4 cup sugar, 1 cup of sweetened coconut flakes. It was smooth and creamy and tasted great with store-bought pound cake. Will keep this one handy as it's easy to put together in the morning to be ready for after dinner desert.

So simple, So versatile! My first run at this recipe was also the first time I used my new electric ice cream machine. I have had trouble with a few recipes since, that were more complicated, THIS one was a (tropical) breeze. I opted to leave the flake coconut out, and blended it afterwards with coconut rum and fresh pineapple juice. Mum has a new favourite "adult milk shake"!

This was easy and delicious!  I did change it a bit to used whole almond milk instead of regular milk and unsweetened coconut. I found that the cream of coconut made it sweet enough and the unsweetened organic coconut flakes are not as long

This is one of my favorite ice cream recipes.  The flavor is perfect, the texture is the smoothest I've ever had, and it is so unique that it catches people by surprise!  I top with crushed coconut and it is far better than a certain name-brand version of Pineapple Coconut ice cream!

This is the perfect coconut ice cream recipe. We loved it! I added toasted, flaked coconut and an 8oz bar of bittersweet chocolate, chopped, during the last 2 minutes of freezing. Fantastic!

This recipe was really a hit with my family....I changed a few things. I added coconut extract (tiny bit) and about 3/4 cup of granulated sugar.  Next time I plan on doubling the recipe.

Simple, quick, delicious, and the leftovers kept very well in the freezer. I used one cup of (unsweetened) coconut milk in place of a portion of both the milk and the cream, just to increase the coconutty-ness of it. 

We served it with some ganache I had leftover from a previous dessert and it reminded me of a Mounds Bar! Yummmmm! My guests thought I was very "gourmet", but it really couldn't have been simpler!

And even though I really didn't have enough ice for the ice cream maker and just had to make do with the small amount that I had (plus, I stopped it too soon), it turned out only slightly more "milkshake-y" than I had hoped. But it was still just as thick as many other homemade ice creams I've had, and definitely very rich and creamy.

In short, good stuff.

I truly love coconut ice cream. This is my favorite recipe. I rated it a 4 because the first I made it, I followed the recipe exactly, and while that was good, the second time I made the following changes. Instead of dairy milk I used silk coconut milk. I do not like coconut in my ice cream so I toasted it and put it on top. Delightful!!!!!!!!!

This was just OK for me - not very sweet.  Also, there was about a cup too much liquid for my particular (Cuisinart) ice cream maker so it overflowed which was annoying.  Not sure if i'd make this again...

I substituted coconut milk for the regular milk called for in the recipe,  It definitely amplified the coconut flavor, and it made it the most creamy ice cream I have ever eaten.  It was pretty much decadent coconut infused whipped cream!  Awesome over Thai sweet sticky rice.  My husband prefers the regular milk version because he likes more crystals in his ice cream....but even with regular milk, this is pure-d creamy!!!!  Since finding this recipe, my husband wanted a constant supply in the freezer.

I was skeptical that something so simple and easy would be so good. I'm so glad I tried it because it is fabulous! It reminded me of coconut ice cream I had while in Mexico. We topped it with magic shell and slivered almonds but it doesn't need anything!

Very good, but it's not the best I've ever had. Therefore I gave it a 4 star rating. I toasted the coconut first, and would love to try chocolate in it next time.
*Update*
This time, I doubled the recipe, toasted the coconut, and added 2tsp of coconut extract. Also, I used whole milk. It turned out perfectly! Everyone gave it 10 stars.

I just finished making this ice cream.  My one son said it's not sweet enough.  My other son said it tastes just like coconut milk.  Well, that means I'll have to finish up the ice cream by myself.  I've to admit, the ice cream does not taste anything like ice cream.  I'm made vanilla ice cream from a recipe from Food Network a couple of times and they turned out pretty good.  Will not make this ice cream again.  I love coconut and was looking forward to making this but it didn't live up to expectations.

Tried this as is and added mac nuts.  Both are the best ice creams and im not a big fan of coconut.  Here is the mac nuts recipe: 1 C. sweetened flaked coconut and 3/4 C of chopped mac nuts.

YUM! Super easy! Toasting the coconut is KEY...the flaked coconut adds to the sweetness, so the recipe is definitely sweet enough if you add the coconut.

Absolutely delicious!  Even the picky eaters who didn't think they would like it said it was great.

This was so smooth, creamy and full of coconut flavor!  Served it at a dinner party and everyone loved it.  I served it topped with some caramelized cashews and a drizzle of chocolate sauce, delicious!

We just had coconut ice cream on vacation. This recipe for it tastes just the same!  We love it and are glad we can make it again and again, even if we aren't in Mexico anymore!

I made it without the coconut shavings and it was a big hit. I don't like too much coconut in anything, and this had just enough to give it a nice flavor without being overpowering.

Very good. Though I think it really could use some pineapple and it would be that much better! Easy recipe. I like that it has no eggs and no cooking. Cream of Coconut is very very thick. If what you have is thin, it is not the right stuff. You will ruin your recipe if you use the wrong stuff...

This was very creamy.  Definately not for someone watching their weight.
