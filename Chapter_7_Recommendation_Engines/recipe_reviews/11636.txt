I should have reviewed these a long time ago! I always make at least a double batch because they are so good! My family requests them for the holidays which is what prompted me to write this review! There's just something about the slightly sweet sesame flavor that makes them irresistable! Give these a try you won't be sorry! Thanks for the recipe Janet!

These are very good! Even if they look undone take them out because I left them in the oven too long and they were impossible to get them off the cookie sheets. Next time I'll follow the directions!

the recipe is great after a few changes.i added whole wheat flour and make larger cookies..about 15 from this dough.i kept the half the mixture in the fridge for 15 minutes(while the first batch was baking)and the result of the second batch was way better than the non-refrigerated ones...

These cookies had a nice flavor but stuck to the pan even with greasing and flattened out too much around the edges and were soft in the middle which made it even harder to get the stuck cookies off.

i don't know what i did wrong. this cookie didn't turn out crispy at all. did preheat. i already doubled the cooking time still no crispiness. at best it was chewy in the middle with the edges brown. followed directions including preheating. in the end i upped the temperature to 200 for about 3 minutes only then did it become light brown. it was a little bland too were the sesame seeds supposed to be toasted before including in this recipe? will probably not repeat this again.

A no-repeat for me. Too sweet stuck to pan even with greasing flattened out too much and were chewy rather than crispy. I went back over the recipe and was sure I did everything properly.

Wish I knew what these were supposed to look like. minutes is too short. I cooked mine for 18 minutes so they were golden and crispy. Also think I will toast seeds next time but they taste yummy!
