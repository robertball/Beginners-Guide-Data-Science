Ok, I think I have perfected this recipe...at least for us!  I used 1/2 lb ground beef and 1/2 lb ground turkey.  When almost browned, add one envelope of dry onion soup mix and 1/4 cup water.  Once fully browned add 1 1/2 cups of shredded cheese.  Stir to melt.  This does help the mixture hold together as another reviewer stated.  Then spoon mixture into 24 crescent rolls without cutting them up.  Use three cans of rolls, 24 pickles, ect.  Fold in three corners, overlapping them.  Bake at 350 for 12 - 14 minutes.  My guys LOVED these!  The soup mix adds so much flavor and it was so much easier to assemble this way by adding the shredded cheese.  Hope this works for you, too!!!

I tried these because I am giving a baby shower, and they are adorable!  Not only do they look cute but also taste great.  I will make them again in a different shape for the teens in my life, because they really do taste like the sliders they all love so much.  I made them, froze them, and baked them frozen.  Delicious!  There is just one thing...the name.  "May I offer you a dirty diaper?"  I don't think so; we'll be calling them "nappies" at the shower! :-)

Great recipe.  Had some friends over to watch a Patriots game and made these.  Gone in minutes!

Some changes I would make:
1) Don't cut the triangles in half. Use a whole roll. Keep them whole and use 3 cans of rolls.  I found that the original wau of cutting the trianlges in half made them too small to fold.

2) I added the shredded chedder cheese into the ground beef as I browned it and before I put it into the rolls.  Made it easier to keep them in place.

I have been instructed to bring these to a New Year's party we are going to because everybody requested them.

These were good, not great.  In all fairness, I followed other's suggestions and added a packet of onion soup mix to the ground beef and it made the beef really onion-y and too salty. I htink next time I will just use regular seeasoning.  I also added shredded cheddar to the beef and that did help keep it together. I also used pickle slices and found it helpful to cut the sides off of them to make it easier to fold the sides up.  I will definitely make again but keep tweaking it to get the flavor I'm looking for. Very easy to transport and still yummy cold. Thanks for the recipe!

These are perfect for a baby shower.  I made them for the one I hosted a few years ago.  Everyone thought they were hilarious and delicious!  I also made some "Wet Diapers" (just cheese without any meat).  Huge hit all around.

Very fun! Used american cheese for a more authentic cheesebuger flavor and served with catchup and mustard - everyone enjoyed them. Takes a few to get the shape right - don't overfill them! we kept trying to put in to much meat. A sliver of american under the meat and a sliver over the meat and under the pickle was great - also used some pickled jalapenoes on some and they we all a hit. Great recipe - thanks for sharing.

I made these with biscuits before but using the crescent roll dough is a huge improvement.

Made these for my son's birthday party and everyone really seemed to enjoy them! Only thing I did diff was add some monterey jack with my cheddar. I also didn't have slice pickles, so I used dill pickle relish on some. Served w/ ketchup and mustard. I can see where you can change up the cheeses and also add other ingredients to suit your own taste. I also seasoned my hamb meat-

I like well seasoned meat, so I pre-seasoned the ground beef with Worcestershire sauce, a little ketchup, salt, pepper, and I too added the cheese to the mix. The kids LOVED these, and they are great for their lunch at school too.

These are really good. I needed something for dinner that was super quick so I made them larger and didn't cut the crescent rolls in half. My family loved them.

What a fun recipe for a baby shower.  The food theme was Mexican, so I added taco seasoning to the meat to go along with the theme.  These were enjoyed by all.  I love how versatile this recipe can be by adding or changing the ingredients.  My photo reflects un-baked and baked appetizers.  Thanks Melanie K. for sharing your creative recipe.  I have another baby shower next month and I will be making them again.

When I ask my son what he would like for lunch he often replies with something crude (poop!), so it was nice to settle the score and tell him he's having Dirty Diapers for lunch. Thanks for posting!

Had these for Memorial Day weekend dinner (no grill). Tasted like burgers - YUM! I used 1lb ground beef and two cans of crescent dough and didn't cut them in half. I seasoned the meat well with onion/garlic powder and salt & pepper. Also added some shredded cheddar and beef broth to help hold the meat together, and used american cheese slices on the crescents. Dipped in ketchup and mustard. There were only two of us so I froze half to eat later. Husband loved them!

Very cute!  I have a few picky eaters and perhaps I added to that by telling them we were having "dirty diapers" for lunch. (haha)  But really to my surprise they gobbled them up!  I did change it a little.  I cut out the salt, added 2 bullion cubes to the meat with a little water. Seasoned the meat nicely.  Very nice. Good job!

These were a huge hit at my sister's baby shower!  I would suggest adding some seasoning (seasoned salt, hamburger seasoning, etc etc) to the meat when you cook it.  And cutting the crescents in half makes a great appetizer size snack.  We made mini meatball size burgers and put them in whole croissants for dinner and the kids loved them!

This is a fun meal for kids.  I did have to jazz it up though with seasoning....pepper, seasoned salt, garlic powder, ground coriander.  I also added about 2 tablespoons of A1 sauce for a little zing.  Kids loved it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great when warm. I didn't add the pickles and once they got room temp they were a little dry so i'll give these a try next time with the pickles to see if that makes a difference

Don't be fooled by the appearance of these little goodies...They are DEEELISH!  Following the advice of other reviewers, I too used 3 cans of crescent dough and made them a bigger size (I just didn't feel like making a bunch of teeny tiny ones).  I tossed in some beefy onion soup mix (maybe half a packet) and caramelized the onions before adding them to the beef.  I also used one 8 oz bag of shredded cheddar cheese, and mixed it in with the ground beef mixture while it was still hot (which held it all together very nicely).  Because I made these bigger, I found that I had to add almost 10 minutes to the cooking time.  I've been told that these taste like little Big Mac's! MmMmMmmmm  :~)

Yummy! Added onion soup mix & water (per other reviewers) then mixed cheese with meat. I did cut the triangles in two per the recipe. Tasted like little burgers. Great for game day and I WILL be making them again. Thanks!

OH MY GOODNESS! These are good. I actually just finished making them and freezing them for my baby shower on Saturday..Had a few that didnt fold as I wanted so I baked them for my lunch LOL   I browned 2lbs of hamburger with the onion, drained and added taco seasoning as someone else suggested. I added 1lb velvetta cubed instead of the shredded cheese it actually held together much better. I left the cresents whole instead of cutting in half but I did pull off the bottom tip as I was going along as it made it much easier to fold to look like a diaper. I would recommend making ahead of time and freezing as the filling and folding is time consuming! We will be serving them with homemade salsa and sour cream on Saturday. Ill post pictures then.. Thanks for the recipe!!

I did not realize I hadn't rated these! I'm making them for a potluck tomorrow, and came back to look at my notes - and there weren't any! . .. I admit to tweaking the heck out of this . . . I used a 20 oz package of ground turkey. I added 4 tbsp minced onion (what I had on hand) and 2 tbsp of Montreal Steak Seasoning. After the meat was browned, I added 7 Tbsp dill pickle relish, 2 c grated Colby/Jack cheese, and a 3 oz package of bacon bits. [So they were Bacon Cheeseburger Sliders (=] I used 3 cans of refrigerator crescent rolls, cut in half . . . Loved this! Serve with ketchup and mustard for dipping (= I also made a doubled Mexican version of this for a baby shower. There weren't any left! (I will have to write that one up as a personal recipe!)****edit**** Today I added ~1 tbsp each mustard and ketchup to the meat - then after I tasted it, I added maybe another tbsp of mustard and 2 tbsp of ketchup. Did not make it soupy - worked fine (=

Not impressed.  I made the burger meat using my usual recipe (listed recipe plus all seasoning) which normally gets rave reviews, but this had rather poor flavor.  I added the shredded cheddar cheese as previous reviews mentioned and the meat mixture tasted great.  I used regular pillsbury crescent dough and the end result just didn't meld well.  The dough was too buttery/sweet for the meat and dill pickle.  I'll stick with my cheeseburger spring rolls.

These were pretty good. I made them for my sister's baby shower. It was definitely a lot of work and I had trouble getting any meat to actually fit in the crescent roll. But I do have to say that I doubled the recipe and there were only 3 left after everyone ate, so everyone must have liked them. I definitely wouldn't make them just for at home, but maybe for another shower, since it was a cute idea.

A little messy (but very simple) to make, but worth it.  I made these for my daughter's birthday party and everyone liked them -kids and adults.

Um wow.... my boyfriend and his three friends devoured these while wathcing football! So yummy, better than a cheeseburger! I added half a packet of onion soup mix to the beef and about half a cup of bbq sauce before taking it off the heat. I found it hard to roll the trianges if i made them to small so kept them pretty big. I used cheese slices and they turned out perfect.

I tried this recipe for a baby shower and everyone LOVED it and thought it was cute. I did modify and made 3 different types of dirty diapers. I browned the ground beef and then separated the beef into 3 different frying pans. 1 I made mexican diapers and used taco seasoning and green peppers and tex mex cheese. 2 I made italian diapers and added pizza sauce and a tiny piece of pepperoni and mozza. And the 3rd i left american cheese burger. It was really quite easy to make the diapers and was very nice as most people brought store bought appetizers and were happy to have something in theme and homemade. Will make again for sure!!!!

My book club enjoyed these!  I took the advice of others and added a packet of onion soup mix and 1/4 cup of water to the beef.  I also stirred in 1 1/2 cups of cheese with the meat and it held together fine.  Used 3 packages of rolls and did not cut them in 1/2.  Simple and yummy!

So cute and delicious!  I added shredded cheese to my beef instead of using slices as per the suggestion of another reviewer.  I also did not cut my triangles in half.  They turned out great.

Excellent, I slightly changed to make it Mexican taco mix & sprinkled cheese on top before folding diaper - they were a huge hit at the baby shower today.

These were great.  We made them for a "mocktail" party we were having.  I used minced onion and garlic to season the meat.  Didnt bother with the pickles.  We served them on the side.  Very good base recipe for you put your own spin on.

Made these for my baby shower, Huge Hit! I prepped the meat, onions & pickle the night before, assembled and baked in the morning. The 1st appetizer to be completely gone! Did some with onions, some without, left mustard out, served it onside. Fabulous! The kids loved them!

These were really tasty...a nice alternative to having to make hamburgers and easy for my little ones to handle.  I followed the recipe exactly except had shredded cheddar instead of the slices and didn't have any pickles...it worked out fine and tasted great.  I didn't cut them in half and only made one rolls worth...served with some soup and poof! a yummy dinner.  And my little girls thought it was hilarious that they were called Dirty Diapers.  I think this is a keeper and I might experiment next time with adding in some typical hamburger seasonings, A-1 and ketchup.

Test run before a big baby shower next month, I made these to suit the 4 kids next door--no pickles or onions.  I melted the cheese into the browned ground beef and went from there.  Very easy to do.  I trimmed the long tail off the crescent roll dough and reformed the leftover dough.  I think I'd prefer them smaller for the shower so I'm planning to cut each roll in half and reshape myself to make an appropriate diaper...more bite-size.  Can't wait to try them with seasonings.  I think taco seasoning would be good too.    But so far so good.  Great presentation.  Oh, and, the kids loved them.  UPDATE:  Made them smaller and with pickle and onions for today's shower.  They are much tastier than the first go-round.  They're a hit so I'm upgrading my rating to 5 stars!

Made these for a couples baby shower the first time.  Followed the suggestions in the top review.  They were especially popular among the men.  Several people asked for the recipe.  Have made them since for football parties and informal potlucks.  This makes a lot of filling, so we used extra cans of crescent roll dough.  Good easy appetizer.

These were really good.  I omitted onions since my kids don't like them and we used shredded cheese and added it to the cooked hamburger and let it melt a bit.  We also didn't cut the triangles in half.  I used 2 cans of cresent rolls & about 1.5 lbs. of ground beef.  The kids got to help make these and they had a great time "folding" the diapers.  They tasted great - we'll definitely make it again.

I liked these, then I thought...Mexican Dirty Diapers. Added a packet taco seasoning , 1/2 cup water to the browned beef and onion, and cooked it down. Subbed Jack for the Cheddar, and a slice of pickled jalapeno for the pickle. Tasty. Everyone like them.

these are perfect for a shower or any get together. The only thing I did different was to add chopped bell pepper to them. We love bell pepper and onion together. Also great dipped in Chipotle mayo!

These were SO good! I substituted about a tablespoon of dry onion soup mix for the chopped onion. Also used grated co-jack cause that what I had on hand. My 16 year old said these were restaurant quality!

My kids are so incredibly picky, but they loved it!  I added about 4 TBSP of Barbeque Sauce and I also mixed in about 3/4 Cup of Shredded Colby Monterey Jack Cheese before scooping it onto the crescent rolls.  It added just enough flavor to satisfy my husband but not too much for the kiddos.  Thanks for the awesome idea!

Made these on Christmas Eve...they were a hit! I  didn't cut the triangles in half, think they would have been way too small if I did!  I used a a little velveeta and shredded chedder in the mean to use as a binder, helped the meat stay on the crescent! Then used American cheese on the triangle!  They were yummy little cheeseburgers.  The freezing tip worked great!  Made them the deay before, froze them, then just popped them in the oven!  I will make these again!  Thinking about making a batch and keeping them in my freezer.  They make a great quick dinner for the kiddos!

I won a prize for best tasting appetizer at a party that had a theme that I wont get into.  I called them dirty underwear.  I added a little bit of shredded cheese to bind the filling together to make it easier to fill.  Very tasty!  I also left the crescents whole.

Very cute idea.  I'm making these for a baby shower and made a batch exactly as the recipe states except I left pickles off of a lot of them because some people don't like pickles.  They did taste like sliders, but I think the meat needs more seasoning when cooking.  Next time I will add some garlic and some spices to jazz them up a bit.

Very good.  I "cooked" the onions in about 3/4 cup of beef broth, then added the ground beef to the broth and soft onions.  Then i threw just a handful of cheddar cheese into the mix to get it to stick together a touch better.  Did not cut the trianglesof dough in 1/2.  I took american cheese slices, and broke them into fours. Put a traingle of american cheese on the dough, then the beef mixture, then the pickles, then another little triangle of cheese just to help keep it together.  Baked them and they were awesome!  they also freeze well after baking/cooling, and reheat nicely!

This are really good.  They do taste like the sliders....I did follow a reviewers suggestion to use dry onion soup mix instead and it worked great.  They didn't look like the picture, but I think with some practice I could get the hang of it....hubby loved them.  Thanks for the post.

My husband helped with a "Diapers for Daddy" party while I helped with the baby shower.  I found this reciepe and suggested that he make these.  Since the baby is a boy and this was a "guy" party, we added a mini hotdog to the "poop".  Everyone got a kick out of it.

I made these for my coworkers baby shower.  I used ground turkey instead of beef because that's what I prefer.  Everyone raved about these...I thought that they were ok, needed some playing with.  I followed the directions for rolls and wrapping but still ended up with a ton of leftover meat.  Took the leftovers to my family's Sunday dinner and made them again.  Once again everyone liked them much more than I did.  Will make them again as everyone likes them.  Served them with BBQ sauce and ketchup/mayo.

I did not cut the roll and used ground beef, mushrooms, onions and placed shredded cheese in frying pan to bind the filling. Super good. I made them as pockets so filing would not leak. You can use any filling you like.

This was okay. I chopped the picke and added to the ground beef mixture, added a tiny bit of ketchup to the ground beef, spread some mustard on the crescent rolls, and used shredded cheese. Quick, easy, might make it again.

They were a hit.  I sautéed the onions first in olive oil and added green onions and chopped mushrooms. I also put galic, salt and pepper and garlic powder to the beef. I used shredded cheese and put in the beef before spooning it out. I used 3 cans of crescent rolls.

my 2 boys (5 & 7) really liked these,and so do their parents. I tweaked the recipe a little to make it easier and tastier. To the cooked ground meat along with the diced onions I add, about 2 ea. TBSP of catsup, mustard and relish. When averthing is combined and heated I put about 3 slices of american cheese on top and let it melt then stir it in. This way you dont have to worry about layering pickle and cheese before wrapping

I loved this recipe!  I seasoned the hamburger with Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning.  Then I sauted onion, jalapeno and garlic and mixed the cheese and the veggies in the meat.  I sprinkled shredded cheese on top of the stuffed diapers and then baked.  Yummy!

This was such a cute appetizer for my son's first birthday party!  And it was simple and tasty also.  I used a pound of ground beef with about 4 ounces of shredded cheddar and a packet of onion soup mix (no pickle).  I had enough filling for 2 cans of crescent roll dough, though.  Everyone loved it and they were scarfed down quickly.  Thanks for the post!

I made this for a baby shower and it was difficult to make a big batch due to having to cut it in half. The second time I made it, I didn't cut it into smaller triangles. I added some cajun seasoning and garlic powder. And instead of putting a pickle spear, I put a pickled jalapeno slice inside each triangle. It was perfect! Good recipe.

These were really great and cute at the baby shower that I threw.  Instead of sliders I made a taco meat using taco seasoning packet and threw in some cheese which both helped the meet stay together.  We served them with salsa.  Very good.

These were a big fat flop for me.  LOVE the concept and wanted them to work/look like the photo, but something did not work for me.  They tasted ok, but looked terrible.  I'm not sure how much better I could make them look, working w/browned beef....it's crumbly....it doesn't want to stay put.  I think I may try the same concept in mini muffin trays.  I'd welcome any feedback as to how I could do it better?

These were good and easy to make...they were a little plain but good for picky eaters - kids would probably like these a lot.  I agree that cutting the triangles in half made the pieces hard to fold - I also had about half the meat left over when using only one can of rolls.
