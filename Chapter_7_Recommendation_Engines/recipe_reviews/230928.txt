I was on the hunt for a BLT sandwich type recipe (for my breakfast) when I ran across this. I loved the idea of it. I don't have cream cheese so I just spread the sour cream, then added homemade salsa to 1 whole wheat tortilla. I cooked some turkey bacon in the microwave. This was a super easy breakfast. I liked the suggestion of another reviewer to add an avocado. I loved walking out to my garden and picking the tomato and lettuce. I didn't do all the pre-chopping, I just placed everything down on the tortilla, rolled it up and cut the slices.

Surprisingly my two kids hated these and we weren't big on them either. Slicing them up make for a messy fall apart meal so they are better left whole and a dressing like cesear or ranch would be more flavorful so you may as well make a regular wrap or pita! We won't be making this again.

Giving 4 stars only because I altered the recipe so it is hard to rate what is here..... in looking at other BLT recipes I noticed a lot of recipes that added avocado to their BLT sandwiches so I mashed two avocado and layered that underneath before I layered the cream cheese mixture.  Also, I always put garlic powder on my BLT sandwiches so I added some garlic to to the cream cheese mix, about 1/2 tsp. I didn't bother to shred the lettuce, I just layered pieces of lettuce on the cream cheese mix before I rolled.  These were very good.  I'm sure they would have been very good without the alterations as well.

Instead of shredded up romaine lettuce, I substituted it for greens since I like them better. I love avocado and so I added it to the recipe too. These were awesome! For those of you that thought it came out messy, the trick is, after you roll them up you then roll them in tin foil and then cut them in slices. They hold together quite nicely that way.

I made these for my family to hold them over while waiting for our Thanksgiving day dinner .  They were good but hard to cut up and a little messy but they are worth it.  Second time making them should be easier now that I know how they turn out.  Just a little side note; Make sure you use a very sharp knife or you will squeeze all the goodness out.  Very tasty!

This was really a messy rollup. Did not stay together and very messy. Does not hold up overnight very well either, wraps get too soggy. It tasted ok but won't bother with these again.

Loved these!  I didn't shred the romaine, I just put the whole leaf in the middle then rolled! I chilled for about an hour to make slicing easier. A big hit at our party!!
