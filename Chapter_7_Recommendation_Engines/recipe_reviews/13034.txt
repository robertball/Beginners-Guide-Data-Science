Don't understand all the whining about this recipe.  It is quite good. BUT I did make some adjustments that probably ensured its success.  Tomatoes and wine are acidic and will halt the cooking of legumes.  Cook the beans for an hour or two; then let them rest in the refrigerator before turning them into the crockpot with the acids.  Also because of the long cooking time, don't chop the vegetables--chunk them.  Make the pieces big enough to fit on a spoon.  Dicing or chopping means they will disintegrate during long cooking time.  Finally, I wasn't happy with the consistency at finish.  I wanted a thicker soup.  So before adding the sausage, I pureed about three cups of beans, then returned the mixture to the soup for the hearty bean soup I was hoping for.

Instead of using packaged beans, I used canned beans.Much faster and didn't have to worry about uncooked beans.  It was delicious.  My husband loves it too. I make it a lot.

I adapted this recipe for the stovetop, and it couldn't be easier or faster or more delicious! I used canned beans and tomatoes, frozen vegetables for the rest (except onion). And it took only about 1/2 hour to cook on the stovetop!

It was Great.  I only made the following changes: the bean pkge I purchased was 1#; had no white wine at home (so left out) and used only 1# of cajun seasoned sausage, since that is all I had.  SDamare (Slidell, LA)

Overall, a pretty tasty soup. Easy to make, too. The only time-consuming part was preparing the vegetables.

If I could give this more than 5 stars I would!  I didn't add the wine (don't care for it) and I cooked it 2-3 hours longer than it called for.  It is the perfect make a day ahead and heat back up soup.  My husband and father-in-law are already asking when I am going to make it again.

Soup could be improved by cooking "Beans" completely before adding the tomatoes!  Adding tomatoes too soon hardens the shells and makes soup too crunchy!  I tried this recipe several times following the directions and the result was the same.  Hard Beans!

This soup was great.  We had it on one of the first cool nights of the fall and it was perfect.  I substituted the wine with chicken broth and it still tasted good.  I also used hot italian pork sausage and removed it from the casings so the soup has sausagey meatballs.  Next time I would cut the recipe by a third though because it didn't all fit into my crock pot (I have the larger one) and I had to finish it in a pot on the stove.  But I would definitely make this again.

Everyone loved this one.  I personally thought it was a bit salty, would cut down on the salt next time.  But it was an overall hit at our house.  Kids like it too.

This recipe must definitely be cooked longer. I gave mine a headstart by boiling on the stove for about 1 1/2 hrs first then putting in crockpot. I plan on adding rice and kielbasa sausage the next time I cook this one.

I won Honorable Mention in the Chili/Soup Cookoff at my office with this recipe. It was a big hit.

This is a great recipe!  The taste can vary depending on your choice of beans, so keep that in mind.  We used a 9-bean blend that was delicious.  

I was a little paranoid about ending up with crunchy beans after reading the other reviews, so I soaked the beans overnight in the crockpot on "warm" (not low).  It was bubbling the next morning, but the beans were soft.  I then drained the water and replaced with chicken broth, garlic powder, onions, onion powder, basil, and celery, salt and pepper.   It was cooked to perfection by noon.

Serve over a hearty long-grain rice and it is a complete meal.  Very tasty!

We generally do not eat beans as a main dish, but I could easily eat this once or twice a week.  It is very filling.

This soup was great!!  My husband raved about it.  I followed the recipe with a few exceptions-used canned beans rather than dried (easier that way) and did not put in peas as we do not like them.  I will definitely make this again!!

This was really good soup.  I made some changes too.  I cooked the sausage and added to the soup first to add flavor.  Also I added approx 1 T chili powder, and 1 can of tomatoe sauce and I didn't have the white wine. I left out the frozen peas too because there seemed to be a lot of peas in the bag of mixed beans.  Next time I will cook the beans longer on the stove as others have done because they weren't quite done at dinner time.
All in all, the soup was a hit!  Thanks!

I followed the instructions, but most of the beans in my bean mix were still pretty hard at serving time.  I haven't seen that comment before, so maybe I had old beans, or maybe my crockpot doesn't cook hot enough, or maybe it's high altitude (I live at 6500'), but this is definitely NOT a keeper for us.

Make sure you cook the soup long enough!  Beans may take longer than you think.  Otherwise, great flavor!

This soup was a big hit at my house. It has a wonderful flavor and is very satisfying. I recommend cooking the beans a little longer before putting them in the slow cooker.

This soup is great!  If you use dried beans, you can really control the sodium content (I did use canned because I was short on time, but next time will use dried).  I also used lower sodium chicken broth.  This recipe is full of vegetables, has no added processed "junk" and the flavor is clean, allowing the ingredients work together naturally.  My family loved it!

Great recipe.  I don't have a slow cooker, so I just modified for stove top.  Skipped the red bell pepper.

Did not like.  We eat a lot of bean soups, and this one just sat in the fridge until I finally tossed it.  Will not make again.

I had a lot of bratwurst at the restaurant, so I made this soup.  Good, but the second I added the wine I regretted it.  It ruined the aroma and taste.  I added baked beans to the mix to give it back some sweetness.  Overall, very appealing soup.  I especially like the contrast of red and green veggies and the different kinds of beans

This is a good recipe but I found it to be a little bland - I suggest that if you make it you taste it ahead of time and plan to add seasonings to your taste.  I marked it low on quickness because you have to soak the beans overnight, and then it goes in the slow cooker - so you have to start a day or so ahead of time with this one!  And there are vegetables to chop, so I marked down on easiness because of that.  But it really wasn't difficult to make and smelled great while it was cooking!

This was delicious! The white wine gives the soup lots of flavor without being overwhelming. I did add a few pressed cloves of garlic. It tasted even better the next day. I added some chopped up quesadilla to the left overs and ended up with an enchilada type soup. Yummy!

I thought this was pretty good but I had to make some modifications because my slow cooker wasn't big enough for everything to fit.  I used 2 cans of mixed beans so I wouldn't have to worry about them being cooked.  I used about 2 tsp each basil and oregano and added a bay leaf.  I think I only added about 1/3 cup of wine and I left out the peas all together.  We put a litte grated parmesan chesse and cracked black pepper on at serving time and it was very good.  It hit the spot on a cold winter day.

This reipe really depends on how fast your slow cooker cooks! I had soaked the beans overnight, cooked them for almost 18 hours, and they still tasted tough and flavorless. Would not make again.

The beans were tough and the flavor was boring. I even tried cooking the beans longer before adding the wine and tomatoes and it still didn't work.

Bean texture and bland taste were big issues.  Followed the directions on the Goya bag by boiling for 2 minutes and then standing covered for an hour.  Also changed the water several times and soaked for about 24 hours at room temperature. Beans still a little crunchy in slow cooker despite 8 hours on warm, about 4 on high and 5 on low.  Final texture after all this cooking was more like stew.  Added 2 cloves garlic, 2 tsp basil, 16 peppercorns, 1 bay leaf and 3 chicken bouillon cubes and am still not happy with the taste.  Definitely will not try again and actually will steer clear of dry bean recipes based on this experience.

This was really good. Even my 2 yr. old asked for more. Instead of turkey sausage, I used Chorizo sausage. This was still missing that something that we can't pinpoint exactly. MAybe some garlic?

I hated this soup, but my husband loved it.  I didn't like the taste of the Italian turkey sausage and the beans were crunchy, even though I soaked them overnight and cooked the soup for 9 hours.  I didn't like the overall taste or smell.  But my husband wants the leftovers, so go figure!

I tried this today, and I have to say it was good, and I found it rather easy.  One way to avoid the thin soup issue is to add a few diced potatoes.  They will help thicken the soup, and add a bit of silkiness.  I also cooked the beans from dry, and made sure they were soft before I started the rest of the recipe.  It's basic, and a good way to start.  You can use this as a jumping off point for customizations.  For example, I added a dried ancho chili and some red pepper flakes, for a spicy version, and my father in law loved it!

Thought this was great and simple.  I really didn't change much in this recipe.  I'm not a huge fan of soaking beans so I bought canned beans.  I threw everything into my slow cooker and cooked on medium for 6 hours because I started making this a little later than anticipated.  The only thing I did different is I used a chub pack of Italian sausage NOT in a casing.  I live near a college that processes and sells fresh meat they make in their meats lab and that's what I had on hand.  Besides that, I omitted the celery.  I'm not a big fan of celery so I left it out.  I thought it was just yummy!  Can't wait to eat the leftovers :)

I thought this was very good!!!  I used canned beans instead, and yellow squash instead of peas and added about 1 TBSP of brown sugar.  This was a nice yummy soup!!!!
