Fabulous Recipe!!!  This is a fool proof recipe, which for me was a good thing!!  By mistake, I added 1/2 lb.of melted butter instead of 1/2 a cup, and over a cup of O.J., I only had to bake them longer and they still turned out great...verry moist.  I also added 1 cup or dried cranberries, and didn't add the nuts.  This is a very versatile and forgiving recipe that you can make many variations with and it will still turn out great!!  Thank you!!

The muffins were excellent if you like your muffins less sweet.  I added about a cup of fresh chopped cranberries which went very nicely with the orange.  Be warned that they are not nearly as sweet as traditional muffins so kids may not like them as much.

This is an excellent orange muffin recipe.  I've been looking for this recipe for a while. The flavor is awesome and they are so moist. These are also good with raisins added.

DELICIOUS!  This is a quick, easy recipe that produces light, tasty, fabulous muffins.  I added 1 c. chopped dried cranberries as others suggested and loved the orange-cranberry combo.  I think I may leave off the topping the next time because it seems unnecessary.

This is a nice textured muffin with very pleasant results. I too, like a previous reviewer didn't think the orange flavour was strong enough, but my family like them lots as they devoured the whole batch within 30 minutes. Something must be right. Thanks for sharing.

The muffins were a big hit with old and young alike at Thanksgiving.  No one didn't like them.  I don't even like orange muffins and I liked them.  However, the recipes didn't quite work the first time, I had to add more liquid.  The topping also wasn't spreadable it was so thick; so I made some with and some without.  The end result was fine though.

The recipe tagline, "An old Mennonite recipe" should have tipped the other reviewers that this was going to be a 'dry' muffin. If you've had cornmeal or Jiffy muffin mixes, this tastes like a slight orange tasting version, which was very good in texture. I put in 1/4 c. brown sugar and 1/4 c. white sugar, a touch of canola oil and skipped the walnuts as that would, in my opinion, make it too too dry :) I left off the buttery topping and just sprinkled cinnamon and brown sugar on top. They were very tasty when halved and buttered. A good recipe to save and use to experiment. Thank you for sharing.

No way you can "sprinkle" the topping. Mine was like a dark brown paste. I wasn't real sure what to do with it since you can't spread it on unbaked muffins, so I just dropped small globs of it on top of the unbaked muffins. Also, next time I will cut back on the salt...way too salty for my taste.

Easy to make and very moist final product.  I increased zest to that of 4 oranges and added diced orange sections from 2 oranges to increase the orange flavor.  This will be a new christmas morning favorite.

These were pretty good. I made these early one Sunday morning so to cut back on time I omitted the orange zest. Since I was worried about it not having enough orange flavor I used 1/2 c. orange juice concentrate and then filled the measuring cup up to 2/3 c. with water. They turned out perfect that way. I might do half orange juice concentrate and half water next time, just to see the difference. I also put some dried cranberries in half the muffins and that was very tasty. Overall this is a pretty good recipe.

This is a fabulous recipes that everyone should try! The only thing that I changed (because of the other comments) is  that I added a little bit more surgar, and a tiny bit of milk was added; and if you like really orangey-ish taste, put more juice in. I didn't put any topping on the top because I forgot! But it turned out okay without. You may want to go a snidg-bit easy on  the baking soda, b/c it tasted a little to much, but not over whelming. Wonderful! I am SO making it again! Everyone LOVED IT! Be sure not to over mix, though!

Really good!!  Sweet and light-tasting.  You don't even really need the cinnamon toppping if you use walnuts in it.

BRAVO!!  Fantastic, light, and full of flavor!!  I usually hate reviews that name multiple revisions or modifications, because that means you don't actually have a review of the original recipe.  However, I will break my rule slightly this time:   I am allergic to tree nuts, so I added 1/2 cup of dried cranberries.  I also skipped the topping, even though it sound delicious, because I was serving them with Irish Soft Butter.  They came out perfect. 
A tip for:  don't use cupcake papers.  Spray muffin tins with a baking release spray instead.  This way your muffins will have a delectable brown crust that you cannot get if you use paper liners!!

I've made these twice now and they were a massive hit with everyone who ate them! Some reviewers commented that they weren't sweet enough as the recipe relied a lot on the oranges for sweetness, but I found them perfect. The topping crumbled perfectly and gave the muffins a very interesting texture. For the first time in a while, I didn't change anything about this recipe (except lengthening the cooking time a little bit, but I find I'm having to do that a lot and suspect it's just because of my oven) and would definitely make these muffins again. Perfect to eat just after they've come out the oven, and I found that they work well for breakfast if you quickly zap them in the microwave then drizzle maple syrup over the top.

I have fiddled around with this recipe and changed a few things.  Instead of the OJ, I add 1/2 c. of OJ concentrate.  I also add 1/2 c of buttermilk for liquid and I add 1/2 cup of oil instead of butter.  I just sprinkle them with sugar before baking.  They turn out perfect every time.

Not too sweet, which is a nice change for most muffins.  I made them as mini muffins and got 34 of them.  I grated an entire orange, which was more than a tbs, so it had a great orange flavor.  I also didn't put the crumb topping on.  Too messy for kids who walk around while they eat.

LOVED these delicious morsels! Based on other reviews, the orange flavor didn't seem to be strong enough, so I added extra orange zest, as well as about a tablespoon of vanilla extract, and the flavor was lovely! Not to overpowering but enough to stand out! So good!

These muffins were great!  I used only 1/4 cup marg and replaced the other 1/4 with applesauce.  Next time I might try adding some orange extract for a little more orangy flavor.

It's not bad but I don't go to the trouble of zesting an orange that I don't have, so maybe that's why there was no orange flavor in it what so ever, but next time I plan on using orange extract.

YUMMY!  I skipped the topping and these were still amazing.  I served them up hot out of the oven with a pat of butter and oh so yummy.

These muffins are bland and tasteless. I had to put jam on them just to be able to eat them. They're a bit less horrible once when they cool down, but still pretty awful.

A definite 5-star recipe. As I'm vegan, I substituted one medium pureed banana for the eggs. One time I made the recipe I added dried cranberries and another time I didn't. Both times they turned out splendidly. Personally I like them with the cranberries, which are such a good compliment to the orange flavor in these muffins, but it's just a matter of personal taste. Stellar recipe, thank you so much.

Amazing! I substituted 1/4 cup and 2 tablespoons oil for the 1/2 cup butter, because I didn't have enough and dipped the muffins in the melted butter/sugar/cinnamon mixture after baking. Thanks!

I was looking for a good citrus muffin recipe and this one is definately that. I left the streusel out(personal preference) and used tangerine-orange juice and tangerine zest and it was a great variation. The texture is just right too and I will definately be using this recipe again- thanks for posting!

ok...call me crazy but I found these dry and a bit flavorless...perhaps altitude baking altered moistness, but I wasn't blown away.

Very Very Good! it was a very thick batter so I added more juice to thin out. I used fresh squeezed orange juice. Substituted brown sugar instead of the white. I also thru in 2 small oranges diced up and 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. Gave it a real autumn harvesty flavour. I did not put any toping on them. I usually love butter on my muffins when I eat them, but it is almost too much, they are so perfect all by themselves!! Def going into my book for special recipes!

I love these muffins! To make them even fluffier and moist, I add an additional 1/3 cup of juice from a can of mandarin oranges. I dice the mandarin oranges, add 1 1/2 cups each  of shredded coconut and dried cranberries and skip the streusel topping. Amazing.

Great muffins! I didn't have any orange juice, but tons of clementines so I used the juice of 5 or so clementines and added 2 extra tablespoons of sugar. Still sooo good. I also ran out of butter so couldn't do the crumb topping, instead i just added a spoonful of sugar and some cinnamon to the tops and they came out wonderful! like a candy topping. Will definitely be making these again.

This truly was fabulous and easy (and that is coming from someone who sometimes struggles with even the supposedly quick and easy recipes). I subbed raisins as someone suggested and also put in small amounts of fresh squeezed orange and pineapple juice as well as bits of orange and fresh pineapple. I didn't have OJ so I subbed grapefruit juice and I imagine this recipe would work well to make some sort of apple muffin with apple bits (dried) and applesauce or apple juice! Thanks a lot!

Thank You Terry!!  I was looking for a recipe(from scratch) so that I could use up  a bunch of oranges before they went bad. This was truly home-made goodness for us since I collected the walnuts from our tree  last year. The combined taste of orange/walnuts was terrific and I nearly made a glutton out of myself.

These muffins were just "ok" for me. I followed the recipe exactly and they just came out rather bland. Not alot of orange flavor to them. The topping was very yummy but the rest of the muffin was just... there. I thought the walnuts would add enough texture but they just didnt for me, and I added extra! I will try these again and most likely add some cranberries soaked in orange juice... I think they would really bump this recipe.

These are very good muffins and I like them particularly because they're not too sweet! If a muffin is too sweet you might as well just eat a piece of cake! I don't like nuts so left them out and didn't bother with the topping either. Delicious and a good snack for morning coffee break. Thankyou!

This recipe is a keeper!  I took a few of the suggestions from others.  I added an extra 3Tbsp of butter, 1/4 sugar, and 1 full cup of fresh squeezed orange juice with the pulp.  I also added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon to the batter, I will probably up that to 1/2 tsp next time.  The topping is definitely a plus! I baked them in mini muffin pans.  It made 72 muffins.  They are perfect for the kids to snack on and they love them!
I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of all the alternative ingredients I added.  A really good basic recipe.

This is a very good recipe to work with. I made my version gluten-free by sifting together rice, corn and soy flours to make up the two cups of flour. To compensate for this and to make them more moist, I added an extra 1/4 cup of butter and a full cup of OJ. Cinnamon, nutmeg and fresh lemon peel spiced them up nicely, and a good handful of fresh cranberries gave them some kick. I was suprised to see them rise as much as they did, even for being gluten-free! I definitely will make these again.

FANTASTIC!!!! I made these muffin for my family for breakfast and the loved them. The only thing I would change is more orange but other than that they were perfect. They were also low in sugar but the kids still loved them. This one is definitely a keeper!!

The taste was just okay.  Could use a bit more sugar and more juice maybe.  Even with the milk I added, they were very dry.  I probably won't make these again.

These were good. Not spectacular, amazing, out0of-this world good, but good. They are a nice change of pace from banana muffins, and I will probably make them again. I didn't use all the orange zest it called for, because, frankly, I didn't have the patience to zest that much orange peel. I did add the extra oj, though. And my toddler son loves them! He is snatching them from my plate now!

like others who made this recipe I found the batter too dry so added another 1/4 cup of OJ . I used whole wheat flour ,3 times the grated orange peel as the recipe called for ,omitted the walnuts in favor of craisins and used a bit more brown sugar in the topping :)I also used Ener g egg replacer instead of 2 eggs and raw sugar instead of regular granulated . My husband loved these and I will add them in to my regularly prepared  muffin recipes .Next time I think I 'll add some vegan dark chocolate chips or perhaps the walnuts ....YUM :) thanks for  the recipe !

This is a great muffin!  Although I made changes to make it more healthy.  I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of all purpose. I didn't put in any sugar but added some honey, dates and plain yogurt.  I squeezed oranges instead of juice only because I had a whole basket of them that needed to be used.  I didn't put any of the topping on my muffins.  Turned out great.  It was the first time that I actually got my muffins to rise and look like a muffin. =)

Delicious, very good. I did some changes to this recipe and it still turn out very good. Instead of 160ml orange juice,  I substitute with some milk and add some orange & lemon essense. As I have some left over lemon curd thus I just put it in and they are just nice and delicious. My girl like them very much as it is not too sweet.

Thank you for this awesome recipe which the whole family loved!  I substituted raisins for nuts (because it's what I had) and canola oil for butter (because my daughter is lactose intolerant).  I also added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. cloves for a spiced muffin flavor, and glazed these with honey.  I will definitely make these again!  Wonderful!!!!!

These were pretty tasty although I wish there was a bit more orange flavor.  I didn't care for the topping so next time I will make some sort of orangey glaze to go over the top of the warm muffins.

Excellent, not too sweet. Pretty buttery though.

These were good. Adding more spices, and maybe some mandarin oranges, to the mix would've made it better. My kids really liked the topping, but not the muffin itself. Will make again, but with additional mixins.

I found that the batter was a little too thick, so I ended up needing to add more orange juice (it ended up being a little over 1 cup), other than that, the recipe was great, and tasted great.  The second time I made it I added pieces of orange to the muffins, and it turned out fantastic. These muffins can't stay in my kitchen for more than a day before they're all eaten.

The reason for the 3 stars is because I felt that these "orange muffins" were more like "orange cornbread". I liked the flavor and the topping. Overall the flavor was good, but I just thought it was too dry to be a muffin. So my suggestion, either add more moisture or call it a cornbread.

Easy recipe! I substituted half the flour for whole wheat flour, added 1 tsp vanilla and added some cinnamon to the dry flour mixture in the beginning.  As someone else commented, I too only used a cinnamon-white sugar topping-  it worked out fine!  The batter was more dough-like and dry.  Kind of sticky and hard to drop into the muffin cups- however, the finished product was moist and dense.  They have a mild flavor.  And I might leave out the zest next time- it weirds me out to see orange peel.

This is a good recipe! However, instead of melted butter, I creamed the butter so that it would be a more cake-like muffin. Other than that, I did put most of the 2/3 orange juice and to make it more moist and fluffy, I added some buttermilk to the recipe (or milk + a bit of vinegar/lemon juice). I also added 1/4 chopped raisins and 1/4 chopped almonds and sprinkled some flour over them before mixing into the batter so they won't sink to the bottom. I made it as a gift and my aunt simply loved them! :) Thanks for the recipe!

They were good. I was hoping for a little stronger orange taste. They were a big hit with my 3-year-old son who helped me make them.

I used 2 Tbl of orange zest and milk instead of orange juice since I had none. I did use nuts and the topping. Really good muffins. Nice New Year's breakfast.

Nice recipe but not very orange tasting. I added some real orange squeezed juice to the batter and still...sigh. Anyhow, it made a good tasting yellow muffin. I don't know if I'd make them again, but it was a change from chocolate.

This is similar to a recipe my friend gave me in New Zealand. I lost it so I will try this. The differences are that she used small bits of crystalized candied ginger and a few bits of the meat of the orance too.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I used frozen (melted) orange juice concentrate instead of the orange juice for extra orange-flavour (well, and I added chocolate chips, but I add those to everything). Very good! I think I over-cooked mine a little, because they were a bit dry, but that was probably chef-error (muffins are not my specialty).

I did a search for muffins with things I had in the house today, and these fit the bill.  They were moist and tender, with a good strong orange flavor and not too terribly sweet.  My nuts were chopped instead of ground, but that worked fine (I also added some to the topping because I like nuts), and I am allergic to cinnamon so substituted allspice, nutmeg and cloves in the topping, but other than that, I didn't change them.  My oranges were organic juicing oranges, so maybe that's why they had such a wonderful orange flavor!  Mine had plenty of butter--there was melted butter left in the cups after I took out the muffins, and I had used muffin paper liners, too.  We didn't need to add butter to them when eating them--great with a cup of coffee.  This is a keeper!

Well, I couldn't find my cinnamon so substituted 1/4 t cloves in the topping, and my walnuts were just slightly rancid so I substitued finely chopped hazelnuts.  And the muffins are WONDERFUL.

Very tasty. It went down a treat with my family. I didn't use the topping, but I added chocolate chips to give them some extra decadence. I found it a bit dry, so next time, I'll take the advice of others and add some extra juice.

I was not particularly impressed with this recipe.  I followed the recommendation of several reviewers and added extra oj.  The muffins were moist and the flavor was okay.  My husband thought the flavor was too strong.  Although the nuts were optional, I did not feel they made the muffins any better.  In fact, if I were to try this recipe again, I would omit the nuts.  The muffins are definitely better hot then cold.

Yeah! I was able to make this recipe... For years I considered myself muffin-challenged and avoided making any. I just finished baking these and - yum! Albeit, I made some modifications: (I made half the recipe) and used 1/8c butter and 3 tblsp of vanilla yogurt. I didn't have any zest (which would have made for better muffins) so I ommitted that. I also substituted macadamia nuts for the walnuts. I too had to add a bit of oj due to dryness.

Very good recipe.  Many compliments.  I didn't feel the need to add any toppings.
I found that the mixture was a little dry, so I added a touch more orange juice to lighten it up.

I varied this recipe by adding a cup of dark choc chips.

These rose beautifully. I took others advice and did not make the topping. They were a bit bland for my taste. But the orange really did pop. I made lemon cream cheese icing and turned these muffins into cupcakes. They were delicious. :D I will definitely make these muffins/cupcakes again.

I'm rating it as written, it was bland, dry, not much orange flavor.

I made another batch, but half the recipe.  Increased the orange juice to 1/2 cup, omitted the nuts, added 1/2 cup raisins, decreased salt to 1/2 tsp, a splash of vanilla. The texture of the muffins was moist but still lacked orange flavor.  Next time will try a little orange oil for an orange flavor.

These are good. I used 1 cup white flour and 1 cup of whole wheat flour to make them a tad healthier. I didn't do the top glaze and just sprinkled sugar and cinnamon atop. The only thing is that I think it could do with just 1/2 tsp. of salt rather than a whole teaspoon, which I thought while doing it but went against my gut. Will keep in mind if I do them again. But overall they are good.

I followed the recipe exactly (not the topping), as I always do with every recipe before modifying them.  Not orangey enough and a bit on the dry side; therefore the 4-star rating.  

The 2nd time I added the zest and juice of two fairly large oranges along with about a 1/3 cup of chopped dried cranberries.  Turned out wonderfully tasty.  The entire family loved them.

I made these as written but did not bother with the topping.  For those who said that the muffins were not sweet.  Muffins are now made very sweet,  this is not how a muffin was made when I learned to make them 50 years ago.  Muffins were more a bread then a cake.  Now they are more a cake then a bread. These muffins are still a bit sweet for a traditional muffin.  Made12 medium size muffins in 23 minutes. Will make again.  Very nice!

I gave a 3 & hubby a 4 star. I thought they seemed a little blah. I didn't have an orange to zest so used orange peel from the spice section which isn't as strong & is dry. Next time I'll make sure I have an orange on hand to zest because I think that would bring out the orange flavor. We didn't use the topping because we thought it would make the muffins to sweet. I doubt if we'd ever make the topping. Adding the cranraisins was a good touch that others suggested. I'm really looking forward to making again with the real orange zest.

As others have mentioned this is a dry muffin. I added a whole cup of OJ and a touch of ground ginger. The topping looks very ugly but it does taste quite good. Not my favorite recipe but not bad either.

Great recipe.  Really delicious and super easy.  When I make it again, I will add more orange zest and maybe some orange extract (suggested by a previous poster), because I like more orange flavor.  The only change I made is I added an orange glaze on top.  Made them nice and moist.  Family loved them.

This is an amazing recipe!! I have made this twice now, and I have added a little more sugar the second time, and a small amount of orange juice to make it the same consistency. In addition, I added cranberries and chocolate chips to some of the muffins. Also, I substituted orange juice for orange-mango juice, and it worked well. Would definitely recommend!

Excellent recipe! These were very moist, and fairly orangey. I used the zest from one large orange, and it was approximately 2 tablespoons. I also was overzealous with the orange juice and used about a cup. To make sure they tasted orange enough for me, I added 1/2 tsp orange extract. The topping was a paste, so I dropped by little globs on top of the muffins, then took a sharp knife and swirled it around on the top of the muffins. They made these very pretty when they came out of the oven. The next time I make these (and there will be a next time!), I plan to use more zest, and probably 1 teaspoon of orange zest. I really love these, and like the fact they are less sweet. Thank you for the recipe!

Love this recipe!  It's light and moist but a kind of bisquity. It is lightly orange flavoured. An orange glaze would put it over the top.  I served mine with a home made strawberry syrup.   Delightful!

This was super easy! My 4 year old and I made these together. We, like many other reviewers, added half a cup of cranberries because what are orange muffins without cranberries?! Otherwise we followed the recipe just as written and it turned out great! We made these on Saturday morning and ate them again before church on Sunday morning and they were just as good the second day. My daughter just kept saying "mmm" at each bite...and she was right, mmm! :)

The taste is great and it's fragrant when you take it out of the box. I didn't use the topping too. However it was a tad dry. I made some modifications, wonder if these can be the reasons?

Modifications:
Used cake flour instead of AP flour
Reduced sugar to 1/3 cup
Used 1/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup Greek yoghurt instead of 1/2 cup butter
Increased orange juice to 3/4 cup
Added raisins
Finally, baked in air fryer at 165 deg C for 15min.

Hope some of you can help me with my dry muffins problem...

There was a lack of orange flavor. Not sure quite why, I mean, 2/3 cup if oj and some zest should have been enough to add flavor but these muffins were seriously lacking in it. Tasted like a plain boring muffin. They were very fluffy and moist, but I had to spread marmalade on them to get the orange flavor I needed.

My family all loved this muffin and it was so easy to make! Personally I would prefer more flavour, but it's quite nice to just have that subtle edge to it. My muffins also came out as a orangey yellow colour (like sunset, not as intense) it looks gorgeous!

The muffins were okay but took a while to cook.  The brown sugar on top of the muffins made it a little too sweet but it was really good.

These muffins were good, but they weren't as orange-y as I had hoped, and I even added extra zest. Next time, I might throw some orange extract into the mix.

The texture was really noist and fluffy and nice, though.

These were delicious! The orange is very subtle. I liked it but my husband wanted a stronger orange flavor, so next time I'll probably try doubling the orange zest.  I was a little generous with the orange juice since we used fresh oranges and they turned out wonderfully moist. I skipped the topping and put the cinnamon right into the batter.  Next time I'll try both.  I'll definitely be making these again!

Yummy! I replaced the baking soda and baking powder with 1 tsp cream of tartar + 1 tsp baking soda because we avoid aluminum. Added an extra splash of OJ and used orange extract for extra flavor and moistness.

Not bad, but not great either. They needed an orange glaze on top or something to add some moisture and more flavor. My kids said they tasted bitter.

I'm sorry but this was way too greasy and oily. There was way too much butter which drowned out the orange taste.  The cooking time was either too long or temperature too high because the muffins got a bit burnt. Maybe this has something to do with my oven though, since no one else here has mentioned it.

Great recipe but to give them more of a strong orange flavor, use orange juice concentrate (thawed). 2/3 a cup or a bit more.  Then use about 3 T of the concentrate and warm it with 1 T of butter and  3 T of water in a sauce pan. Add powdered sugar to this mixture, whipping it to make a nice icing drizzle to go over the warm muffins.

Pretty tasty! I substituted brown sugar for the white, used the zest of an entire orange, and pureed 2 oranges instead of using orange juice from a jug. I didn't put the topping on, instead sprinkled some cinnamon before baking. Next time I'm going to add fresh cranberries. I love it when they burst in your mouth!

Good muffins, great texture, but somewhat bland.  I didn't taste the orange at all.  More like a bran muffin.  Tasty in that regard, and especially good with cranberry marmelade.  I omitted the topping and instead sprinkled cinnamon-sugar mix on top; this was easier for me and still added a nice sweetness.

I think this recipe is amazing! I expected the more dense, old school muffin that usually end up with from older recipes, but was surprised with the light and airy texture-perfect! Wouldn't change a thing, and will make this many times, I'm sure! To those of you complaining of lack of flavor-make your own orange zest instead of using store-bought, and add a 1/4 tsp or so of orange extract.

Very good recipe. Not to sweet but just enough with the topping. Great for breakfast. Could have been a little moister. Next time I will probably add a little more OJ or maybe some applesauce. Will def make them again. Nice change from the norm.

What fantastic muffins! I only changed how much salt to put in, calls for 1 teaspoon, I added 1/4 teaspoon. These freeze very well. Its a keeper.

These are just dandy.  I made them in mimi muffin trays.  If you do this only fill them half full.  The topping was great next time I might make a little more since I had mini's there could have been a little more topping.  I used regular orage juice but I am wondering if I should have just squeezed the oraange I zested.... hhmmmm next time.  Great recipe.

I thought this muffin turned out perfectly, nice and moist.  I used the bigger muffin tins and made 6 jumbo muffins.  Excellent!

These were great! Easy to make and came out wonderfully! I omitted the nuts and topping and added 1 cup cranberries instead. Brought them to work and everyone loved them. :)

Great texture and taste.  Preferred dipping in butter and crystalized brown sugar after they were baked.

These muffins were wonderful!  I did not have any problems with them being too dry, even though I only used 2/3 cup of liquid as the recipe suggests.  I made only 2 modifications:  for the liquid, I squeezed the juice of 2 oranges and then added apple juice to that until I had the required 2/3 cup.  Secondly, I did not add the walnuts for the sake of the kids.  Even my husband, who claims that he does not like citrus muffins, enjoyed these!

Exquisite flavor in these orange muffins.  I used fresh squeezed OJ and tossed in a bit of shredded coconut.  Delightful.

Very tasty, though I had to play around with the topping.  Perhaps less butter would make the mixture more crumbly.
