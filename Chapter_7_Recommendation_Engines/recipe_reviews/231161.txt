I used this recipe as the backbone for making my collard greens.  I made a few adjustments based on my preferences; these included adding ~3/4 cup of vinegar and supplementing the onion power with 1/4 a fresh onion finely diced that was sautéed for 5 minutes on high with some margarine and brownsugar. My family dislikes the taste of onion, therefore,  to mask the flavor a bit I thought it best to use fresh onion that had been cooked and sweeter a tad. Also instead of adding the cayenne pepper I added generous amounts of both Caribbean Jerk and Old Bay seasoning. Thanks for sharing the recipe it was so simple to make. My changes were only based on my individual taste!

5.8.16  A neighbor gave me some collard greens from his garden, so they really were fresh!  !  These collards had good Southern flavor, but there’s one thing that I would do differently...I would crisp the bacon before adding the other ingredients.  I simply didn’t like the appearance of that boiled white bacon (just looked like fat) or the texture of it.  Admittedly, this could be just a personal preference issue with me.  But they did taste good!

I omitted the sugar and added a 1/2 cup of apple cider vinegar at the end. I also added an onion. They were so deliciously fresh and tasty.  My 8 year old was raving about these collard greens.

I added red pepper flakes, but it made it too spicy for my kids and almost too spicy for myself. I will make this again, no red pepper flakes and use Chicken Stock instead of water. It was super easy.

love it I did tweak it some though. I used ham hock instead of bacon. I boiled the ham hock to get all the flavoring in water then added onions chopped and rest of seasonings. added a little chicken stock as well.

This recipe was my first attempt at cooking collard green. They were delicious and easy to make. The hardest part was cutting the stem off the leaves and that was just time-consuming. The best part was that even my picky-eater mother liked them!

I used pink Himalayan salt, and with the bacon, 1 T was too much, so I will reduce to 1/2 T next time.  Otherwise, excellent!!!

This is a terrific recipe!

I added a few other spices that would complement our meal,  (Touscan Seasoning, paprika, basil), but I'm sure it would have been great without my changes.  I also pre-cooked the bacon, reduced the salt a little and ended up cooking the dish for about 45 mins instead of the two hours.  Was wonderful!

This is great as leftovers too!

I cooked the collard greens with bacon.  It had a little bitter flavor, but I liked it.
