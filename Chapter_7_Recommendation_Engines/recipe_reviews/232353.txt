This is one of my favorite summer salads. To vary it up, sometimes I will substitute pepperoni in place of the chicken and use half prepared ranch dressing for half of the italian dressing. This is even better the next day--if you have any leftover, that is.

I loved this salad!  It was very flavorful and I loved the combination of veggies. My family is not crazy about italian dressing so I only used only about a 1/2 cup instead of the whole bottle and used olive oil for the rest. It was still very tasty. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I halved the recipe, still made a ton. I used grape tomatoes, spring onions, added celery, and fetti noodles. left out the Italian seasoning and used much less Italian seasoning dressing, also subbed out cut-up jumbo shrimp for the fowl. ramen noodles or any type of crunchy noodle would be great here. this marinaded @4 hours. a great 1-course meal for a hot and humid day.

Not tried yet but looks mighty good.  I might use other pasta instead of spaghetti, perhaps corkscrew type or farfale, or even in a pinch ziti or elbows.  Somehow in my mind it might be easier for little people to handle.
