Although I enjoyed this recipe, my family had mixed reviews.  My husband said it was good but not something he would want on a regular basis.  My kids, 4 and 7, had a problem with the fact that it was pink.  My 7 year old said that it actually tasted pretty good anyway.  I added italian seasoning and garlic to the tomatoes while they were simmering for more flavor.

This is a very good dish to take to a friend in need. A salad and bread give them a full meal.

This didn't work out well for me at all. There wasn't enough sauce for 1 lb. of spaghetti, even though I added tomato juice before pouring it in. (NB: I also added oregano and basil to the tomato sauce and nutmeg to the white sauce, so they smelled and tasted good.) The spaghetti, though slightly undercooked, still got mushy in a 335 degree oven for 25 mins. (lower and less than the recipe called for). I like the layered idea and may try it again, but I'll use a thicker pasta (e.g. mostaccioli or penne) and make more of both sauces.

I found that the following was needed to make it excellent.
Bulb of garlick sliced, 1.5 cups of cheddar cheese to the sauce, 8 slices of bacon, fresh mushrooms in lieu of tined ones. Then it would get 5 stars.

I tried to cut the recipe in half. On the whole we liked it. The family vote was next time more tomatoes, less olives, and add some chicken. So we will try it again.

Just the simple recipe I was looking for.  I was running low on groceries & had to feed my family of 5.  Didn't have mushrooms or olives, but I added garlic and Italian spices.  I even threw in a mozzarella cheese stick I pulled apart.  Everyone loved it, even my picky eater!

This was not very tasty. Bland and weird looking. Too much spaghetti, not enough sauce. Too much butter. Would be better with ricotta instead of milk. It was not appetizing.

I made this recipe for our August Canadian Allrecipes Allstar assignment. I used this recipe as a jumping off point as I really liked the idea of the dish but wanted to use fresh vegetables since that was the main point of our assignment and my next door neighbour brought me a box of goodies from his garden. I sauteed onion, carrot, celery, green pepper and zucchini in 1 tbsp of olive oil. I only had a 15 oz can of fire roasted tomatoes so I added some tomato sauce until it was wet enough. For seasoning I used 1 tsp each of brown sugar, basil, oregano, black pepper, onion powder and garlic powder, I omitted the salt. For the roux I used 1/4 cup each butter and flour, then added 1 cup each of skim milk and 5% cream, then the Parmesan cheese. I used whole wheat spaghetti, I added Swiss Chard halfway through the cooking time. To reduce pots and pans I first cooked the pasta and Swiss Chard, then drained in the collander, then I sauteed the vegetables and made the sauce in the same pot, I added the pasta and Swiss Chard back in and mix together then transferred to my baking pan, then I rinsed it out and made the Bechamel sauce for the topping. We really enjoyed it and I would definitely make again. #FreshFaces #AllrecipesAllstarCanada
