Kumla has been a family tradition all my life. MY KUMLA SECRETS:  Secret #1: Yukon Gold potatoes are generally the best. Reds and Russets can be used but frequently contain more water than the Yukons. Secret #2: I special ordered a coarse head for the Kitchenaid grinder which I prefer over the standard grinder head. Grind the potatoes into a collander sitting inside a larger bowl to catch the potato water run-off. The better you drain the potatoes the better the Kumla but move fast. Secret #3: Substitue Onion Salt for salt. The addition of onion flavor to a potato dish is so obvious most people overlook it. If salt is your enemy, use granulated onion. You can also grind fresh onion or shallots into the potatoes but its difficult to get uniform distribution. Secret #4: Mix the baking powder into the flour in a mixing bowl while both are still dry to get uniform distribution. Secret #5: Add melted butter in a quantity you are comfortable with while mixing the batch. I use half a stick. Distribute it evenly. Secret #6: Use nitrile or other good quality sanitary gloves while mixing the dough with your hands. Sprinkle with the onion salt during this process. Secret #7: Use a wide enough pan for cooking to avoid having to "stack" the Kumla balls. Turn them with a slotted spoon during cooking for uniformity. Secret #8: Choose a cooking temperature that allows you to cover the Kumla for the first half hour without boiling over. It makes for a much better finished product. Trust me.

This was a treat when I was a kid.  The only difference is that I use a ham hock that has been smoked and no need to add any salt with the broth.  I like to dip my hands in cold water before I make the potatoe ball.  The piece of bacon in the center adds great flavor.  The left overs are the best sliced and fried in a little bit of butter.  Real comfort food.  Always have loved it.

I recommend serving them with lingonberry jam on the side, and a dollop of butter. Thats how we eat them in Sweden, where they are called kroppkaka..

We make Kumla twice a year as a family. My Mom has always used a meat grinder to grind the potatoes. We peel, and quarter the potato, then put it through the meat grinder. It extrudes excess water from the potato. Much easier than using a grater. I could eat Kumla once a month at least. And, you must have BUTTER....not margarine. I'm seriously thinking I have to make some real soon. YUM !

Been looking for a good Kumla recipe.  Used to love having these when I was younger.  Only thing I changed was no bacon, we always used the ham in the kumla so being that is what I'm used to I stuck to that.  Also added ham bouillon to water while boiling ham and no other seasonings for more ham flavor.  I did like the potatoes being shredded better than the mashed I had grown up with.   Overall great recipe.

Kumla is a very adaptable recipe, depending on what area you are from.  The broth should have more flavor (seasonings), and the dumplings, we always used salted pork in the center.  Instead of ham, which is good also, we use garlic sausage,  Italian sausage, and/or whatever sausage you like.  a couple onions, some carrots is also added.  Of course serve with butter and loganberry/cranberry.  Leftovers next day cut up and fried in butter is to die for.

Wonderful!  Even though I changed the recipe to make it more like what my mom made.  Instead of the whole wheat flower I used quick cook rolled oats and I cooked them in a lamb broth.  I served the dumplings with boiled rutabagas, carrots and locally made sausage.

We have kumla parties at our family reunions. I did not make changes. My grandmother from Iowa made this and then my mom made it.  The recipe is almost exactly the same. It was delicious. Tomorrow we'll slice and fry the leftover dumplings and eat with butter for our breakfast.

I used a food processor to grind the potatoes and extra thick bacon in the broth and a bit inside each dumpling.  I also only used regular flour. They turned out delicious.
