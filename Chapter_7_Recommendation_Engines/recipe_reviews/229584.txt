Searched for a recipe to use up some zucchini and |I found this. Was going to use it as a side dish to some pork chops...when I went to the freezer I saw a package of tortellini and got inspired. Made recipe as written with tomatoes, onions and zucchini fresh from the garden.  Used some extra tomatoes since I was adding pasta. Added cooked tortellini at the very end and simmered for a few minutes...also added a touch of balsamic vinaigrette as fresh tomatoes just screamed for it. Was amazing...will definitely use again as written as a side...thanks for the inspiration.

Good and easy to prepare. We had this as a side dish for Tilapia Scaloppine (recipe also from AR)for a wonderful meal that we'll enjoy often in our household. Thanks for sharing patrice.

I have not made this yet - but I'm giving it 5 stars because it looks and sounds delicious!   I just have one question before trying it - The recipe says to cook it until the cheese melts - but the photo clearly shows balls of mozzarella cheese.  In fact, it looks like a classic cold caprese salad - with zucchini and pasta added.   Did you cook and stir yours until the cheese melted and serve it as a hot sauce on pasta?   Or did you serve it cold on cold pasta salad?   Frankly, that last option sounds real good to me!

Excellent and so easy! I used grated Romano cheese instead of the mozzarella (didn't have any) and added some red pepper flakes.

I followed the recipe just as it was written and changed nothing! Great dish, in fact, I made it two days in a row and will add it to my regular side dish menu. I normally don't review recipes and don't believe in changing them as they were written, becomes a new recipe when changed!

I made this as a side dish so we didn't add the pasta. It was delicious. We had enough left over to add some smoked sausage to it the next night and have that as a main dish. It was wonderful too.

Made it. Tasted great. Husband requested seconds. Used whole wheat spaghetti and some Sriracha sauce for a little spice.

The recipe doesn't match the picture at all.   Pasta and buffalo mozzarella not even mentioned.  My husband told me not to make it again.   It really didn't have much flavor.

Just made the dish. I added it to my pasta. Is great! The only thing I did differently is added some shredded Mexican 4 cheese to it. Not much but a little. It gave the dish a nice color.

This is a great recipe. I added a dash of red pepper and some pasta like in the picture and added the mozzarella after everything was cooked instead of melting it into the ingredients. My husband loved it. A little heavy on the garlic. Might want to cut back just a bit.

Yummy and so easy.  I used dried Basil because it was all I had.  But can not wait to try it with fresh.  Great recipe.
