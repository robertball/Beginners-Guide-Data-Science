This is a great recipe.  It has an excellent summertime taste to it.  I omitted the zucchini because I'm not a big fan of it and I used a spicy barbecue sauce which gave it a great sweet and spicy feel.  This recipe gets 5 stars for its simplicity and awesome taste.

These are quite good.  Very easy.  Definately use fresh pineapple, it makes a big difference.

Very ggod, made a nice simple dinner.  Next time I would follow PrincessJ's advice and marinade the meat in Italian Dressing, as we found it a little bland in flavor.  But all in all a very good kabob.

Fantastic and very easy.  Next time, I will use the largest shrimp I can find, as the recipe states.  I just used "large" this time and peeling/deveining them became quite a chore.  I used the frozen Dole pineapple chunks (thawed) because I don't particularly care for the weird aftertaste of canned pineapple.

A little on the dry side, but very tasty.  I may marinade the meat next time.

This recipes is a bit plain. I marinated the chicken for a few hours in italian dressing first to give it more flavor.

This is a family favorite.  We have been making them for a couple of years now.  I never thought to baste them with BBQ sauce.  I make shrimp ones for my husband and I.
