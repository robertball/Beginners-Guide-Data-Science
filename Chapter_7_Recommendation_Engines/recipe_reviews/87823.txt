I made this bread today and it was fantastic, I wouldn't change anything.  I can't believe that someone would give this a 1 star just because of the title that is STUPID!!!

The kids love it, but too sweet for me. Next time I'll add less honey, and a bit less water as it sank. Other than that, great!

For all who want to make this recipe and do not have a bread machine, make it anyway.   You don't need special instructions or anything converted to make it by hand.  

This is a healthy bread, but I will make it more healthier by substituting the 1 pckge of commercial yeast to 1 cup of sourdough starter.

This bread was delicious!  I am so happy to find a bread recipe that uses all whole wheat flour AND wheat bran, as well as seeds.  I usually eat a store-bought seeded bread, but this tastes way better and is so much healthier.  My only problem was that my loaf only rose halfway.  I use yeast from a jar, and I read that the equivalency to a package is 2 1/4 tsp, but maybe I need to add a bit more.  Either way, it is one of the best breads I've made and will be great in the fall with some beef stew!

The bread came out very well.  I've made it with all wheat flour and also with a mix of whole wheat and white bread flour.  Both batches were very good, and the crunch of the seeds makes it extra special.

For those complaining about the bread being too dense, I have two suggestions:  1.  Use a mix of flours, and 2. Note that the recipe calls for INSTANT YEAST.  If you are using regular active dry, you need to use just short of 3.5 teaspoons, and I suggest proofing it first.  Instant to active dry is NOT a 1:1 conversion.

My bread sank. And it tasted like it was lacking salt.

I modified this recipe and it turned out wonderfully.  I used all purpose bleached flour (instead of whole wheat flour), spring cream honey (instead of regular honey) and used the Basic Bread Cycle.  The bread turned out moist and beautiful.  Will definitely make it with these modifications again in the future.

This bread was not a hit in our house. It turned out quite dry and dense and it didn't seem to have much flavour to it.

Great recipe.  This bread is slightly dense (as expected for wheat bread) and slightly sweet.  My bread machine didn't add the seeds, so I added them on the top, which makes for a lovely presentation.  This makes a fairly small loaf, so keep that in mind.  Out of personal preference, I used the bread machine to make the dough and then cooked it in a loaf pan in my oven for about 40 minutes at 350 degrees.  I didn't use sunflower seeds - just store-bought pumpkin seeds.  I would recommend this recipe to others.

I took the advice of others - added 1/4 more teaspoon of salt, 1/2 more teaspoon of yeast,  ground flax seed (instead of whole), and baked at 350 for 30 minutes. Came out great.

Great recipe!  I used my stand mixer and not a bread machine.  I let it rise for 4 -6 hours once in the loaf pan and it was perfect.
