We'll have this again for sure!  My hubby and I are salad freaks and really enjoyed this one.  I used a different blue cheese dressing recipe; that was the only change I made.  Fantastic!

I loved the combination of flavors in this salad. I made it as described but my onions were too sharp so we picked them out. This dressing is light and I ended up dipping pita in the leftovers. Voted 5 * by all three of my "tasters".

I really liked the combo of the apple and blue cheese dressing (though I used a bottled version).  I was forced to omit the avocado because mine wasn't ripe enough. Very good!

I altered the recipe based on ingredients on hand. I changed the dressing to white vinegar,brown sugar, spicy mustard, and tahini.  I omitted the pecans, but it was still very yummy!! I love the apple, avocado, and red onion combo, delicious!

Those of you using store bought dressing are missing out.  This salad and dressing is PERFECT as is.  My new favorite!

The combination of flavors in this salad is JUST RIGHT.  As a big fan of red onion, I knew this salad would have some bite, but a good salad has some bite.  That's what makes it good.  The apples compliment the avocado, compliment the red onion, compliment the nuts...and it's all pulled together by a wonderful yogurt/blue cheese dressing.  I'll fix this one again and again and AMAZE MY FRIENDS!

Wasn't impressed with the dressing (made it exact). I took out the onions (I think mine were too strong) So I used a basic honey/mustard vinegrette and it was much better and just added the bleu cheese.
I got compliments on it this way.

I did not have onions so I used shredded carrots and walnuts in place of the Pecans. Dressing was good, added a dash of honey and that made it great!

Yummy!  I used a store-bought mix of mild lettuces including butter lettuce with a bit of red cabbage mixed in.  I was in a hurry and accidentally forgot the orange juice and red onion but the bitterness of the cabbage made up for it.  I also had to use sour cream instead of yogurt and also added a bit of olive oil into the dressing.  And I have to admit I did the dressing by feel and not following measurements.  It was delish!
