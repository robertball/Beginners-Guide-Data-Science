Only change I made was to the amount of each ingredient I used and we still have leftovers! It was a huge hit at my house for dinner tonight.

It had good flavor, but saying to cook the noodles for 12 minutes and than baking it, just made the dish too mushy.  So next time I will definitely cook the noodles less time.

This is a good simple, basic recipe. I added some Italian seasonings, diced onion and garlic to the sauce. Still felt like I needed a little something to really make the flavor pop.

I would definitely make again. My family of four ate it happily and we have leftovers. That’s with having cut the recipe in half. I added 1lb ground cooked beef. When the instructions called for mixing the cream cheese with sauce, I also mixed the meat it. Everything else was perfect. I like how an easy week night dinner can be made or even prepared ahead!

I had some leftover spaghetti with sauce, but there wasn't enough sauce so it was quite dry. I warmed up another jar of sauce with slightly less than 8 oz of cream cheese (my son opened an 8 oz bar and used about 1/2 an ounce for his toast). While the spaghetti was in the oven, I realized we didn't have any mozzarella, so I just sprinkled Parmesan on top like we usually do when we eat spaghetti. I turned out great and I got rid of some leftovers. I might try adding some chicken or ground beef next time, and of course more garlic. Maybe some Italian seasoning. Next time I have leftovers I'll make this again.

I loved this recipe.  It is not difficult and tastes fabulous.  And I love the fact that you can take leftovers and split it up and freeze it for a later time.

I didn't make it yet. I was looking at all the reviews and not one mentioned what size baking dish and I didn't see it in the recipe. It would give me a better idea of how much it will serve.
Six servings would that be 1/4 cup, 1/2 cup/ 1 cup each?

This is a delicious recipe as written. Or you can tweak it to your taste. I use the Greek/cream cheese and add beef. Ragu traditional and Italian blend cheese.

I love this recipe, the only change I made was to use gluten free noodles. It was creamy, gooey and delicious. I will definitely be making this for the next big family gathering.

I made this and I really liked it. I added a pound of lean ground beef and Onions. I also added Parmesan cheese with the mozzarella cheese.  I halved the recipe since I was only feeding my husband and myself and we had lots of leftovers.

I made this and my entire family loved it!  It was a big hit. I did add 2.5 lbs of 93/7 hamburger meat and we added sugar. We also used 4 cups of mozzarella on top instead of 2 cups. But it was so so good.

I felt like I didn't have enough sauce.  The noodles on the top became hard.

I make this on a regular basis for the Veterans at our local VFW and it is a huge hit!  Easy to make and it feeds a lot!

Followed recipe exactly.  Wow what a nice creamy spaghetti dish.  It is like gourmet spaghetti.  Everyone loved it and can't wait to have it for lunch tomorrow.  Easy and quick to make.  Will definitely make it again.  Family favorite!

I prefer Prego, but only found a 45 oz. jar. I guess I needed the last 3 oz. It tasted good, but a little dry.

Made it exactly as the recipe stated.  Lots of leftovers, but I have no problem with that---they will be eaten.  Giving it 5 stars because it was good, and super-easy to make.  Can easily be tweaked to suit personal preferences, too.  I might add some extra ingredients that I like next time, but very happy with how it turned out tonight.

Very good as is! It is very easy to add things to your liking. I added garlic salt and onion powder. Next time I will add sautéed onions and garlic. I halved the recipe (2 meals for 2 people) and it fit nicely into my 8x8 dish.
