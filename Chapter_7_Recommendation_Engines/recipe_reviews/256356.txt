I'm sorry I made a mistake with the salt and pepper.  I also apologize for you wasting a meal on this.  Please don't use this recipe as I have messed up the seasoning of it.  In the meantime, I am going to figure out from my notes what SHOULD be on here and also see about getting this recipe changed.

Thanks for your understanding.

Chopped Steak Haiku: "We couldn't eat this. CRAZY too much salt, pepper. And I halved them too." Two tablespoons of salt and one tablespoon of pepper - possibly intended to be teaspoons? I followed the recipe exactly as written, except I halved the salt and pepper and it was still inedible. What a shame. Also found the rosemary/dill combo a little off-putting too.
