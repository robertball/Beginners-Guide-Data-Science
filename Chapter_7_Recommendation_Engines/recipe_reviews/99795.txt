Hi,I wanted to share mine.I am a Japanese and,I thought that I could help others to make more authentic one.
my mom used to use corn kennel,shredded cabbage,shredded carrots,Chikuwa(you can find at Asian store but this is optional),ham, and bit cooked meat ;beef or pork (not ground,not chicken).Other people suggested to buy Okonomiyaki Flour but you do not need it.You can use just All Purpose flour. To make batter,put all vegies and meat and pour flour and add water and make batter and consistency is about not too watery not too thick like pancake batter..I usually eyeball it but you can start from 3table spoon of flour and 2 table spoon water etc.. but you need batter to the amount it can cover veggie and meat.Then,I use vegitable oil and just like you make pancake,you cook it flipping after one side done.Then, splash worcestersauce and cook some seconds and off to your plate.Mix ketchup and worcestersauce;ratio I think 4:6(I eyeball it,but to your taste is fine) and brush this over okonomiyaki and eat.Some people back home in japan drizzle mayo after you take okonomiyaki out to plate and drizzle worcester sauce and sprinkle crushed seaweed on it.You do not need okonomiyaki sauce or tonkatsu sauce.It still tastes good.Until you figure out water and flour ration to make batter is kind of practice but you will learn as you cook. I am sorry I could not provide measurement of batter but next time I make, I try to see how much I am pouring water and flour.

Not a very authentic okonomiyaki... the reason so many people find the batter bland is because you need to use okonomiyaki flour (a specially seasoned flour) for this... which can be found at most Asian grocers

I love this, and I usually put strips of bacon on the pan and pur the batter over that so the bacon gets crispy. My favorite sauce is mayo (Japanese kind are the best!) and tonkatsu sauce.

This is an excellent dish but as stated before, it is better with Okonomiyaki Flour, which is seasoned. If you cannot find the flour, you can add a little seasoning salt to the flour to make it better. Though that is not exactly the same it will help the flavor of the batter significantly. Also, a traditional topping for Okonomiyaki is flaked dried bonito and a sauce that is very much like tonkatsu sauce. Many also like to add cupi (Japanese Mayonase)... Replacing the chicken with cooked shrimp or cooked, thinly sliced beef will make a few other good variations on the meal. Good Stuff!

I had to make a lot of substitutions because of the veg I did/didn't have. So the flavor of this exact recipe I can't really comment on. Our version used chicken, napa, carrots, a regular onion, garlic scapes, and grated radish. The egg mix was as written. We pre-cooked the stronger flavored items to make sure they'd 'cook down', and my griddle was about 350 degrees for cooking. I would say this method is five stars, because we're going to be able to take the method and use it for anything, which is a complete godsend, since we are members of two CSAs--one for veg, one for meat. So we get tons of eggs and have no particular choice about what veg we get each week. This method will work for about anything, we think, and adding different spices will allow us to change this dish around completely--even to different 'ethnicities' if we want to. We made our own sauces--one mayo-based with wasabi and teriyaki, and the other a thai peanut sauce. Both sauces did well with this recipe. With our substitutions I would say this pancake is sort of a 'base' for the sauce you choose. With stronger flavored veg and the traditional okonomiyaki flour maybe sauces would be more optional. I deeply appreciate this method, it will work fantastically with even the weirdest veg we get from the CSA. Thank you!

I loved this recipe because it was full of healthy veggies.  I thought it needed some salt so I may add more soy sauce or add about half a teaspoon next time.  It was great with Tonkatsu sauce, yum!

I see so much potential in this dish. I love that there's so many vegetables. But the batter was too doughy and there wasn't enough flavor. I have seen other okonomiyaki recipes using dashi and yakisoba. That sounds more flavorful and I will try those recipes next time.

I made this for my family last night and everyone loved it.  I am not a great cook, but it was very easy.  My kids asked for seconds and my husband actually said he could eat this for dinner every night.  Thanks so much for this recipe.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this with plain white flour, and used chopped cabbage, chopped zucchini, bell pepper, and seafood sticks.  It was very easy to do and came out really flavorful and my husband liked it too.  We would definitely make this again.

I was taught how to make this by a Japanese friend...DELICIOUS!  We used shredded cabbage, green onion, flour(all purpose is fine), egg, and a little water, then pressed shrimp and bacon into the top of it while cooking, instead of mixing it in.  We topped it with Japanese mayo, and another sauce that I cannot remember the name of!  These are so easy and so good!

Sometimes it doesn't matter that it is not 100% authentic.  This recipe was very tasty and all of my family enjoyed them.  You can change the vegetables to what you have on hand and use a sauce or mayonnaise that you enjoy.  This is great for lunch and kids love them.

Good, but you definitely need the special flour so it won't taste bland.

I used ham and bacon   instead of chicken and red bell instead of green (not a big fan of green). Edit..I lightly brushed each pancake with sesame oil instead of the pan, used nonstick.  I  had one left so it was lunch today, cut to fit a toasted thin bun brushed with katsu sauce and added slice of cz. Yum.

Such a nice light meal. Fun dish to make with whatever ingredients you have on hand. The tonkatsu sauce was perfect on the side.

I love making okonomiyaki! I use dashi instead of chicken broth, and chopped shrimp sometimes instead of chicken.  I usually leave out the carrots and bell peppers, just as a personal preference. I think the "flavor" some people may be missing in this is MSG- it's usually added to alot of Asian flour mixes.  We eat this with miso-flavored mayo and furikake.

My mom was born and raised in Japan.  She met my dad there and they got married and moved to the US. She made these all the time while my brother and I grew up. We loved them. She thinly slice cabbage, and green onions. My mom had awesome knife skills so that cabbage was thinner that a food processor does. She would mix batter with flour and eggs. Last she would add shrimp then she would fry them up. My brother and I would use soy sauce and ketchup on them. This was a recipe that the entire family grew to love. My mom now suffers from dementia and I have changed her recipe  some after researching it on the Internet. But for me, hers were the best.  She told me never over mix your batter. She would sometimes use thin slices of beef but preference was shrimp.

I used this as a reference for a veggie saute.  Used zucchini, green bean and onion sauteed with the same flavors in this recipe: garlic, soy sauce, sesame oil, chicken stock.  Turned out great!

Disappointing.  They looked nicer than they tasted.  After one pancake, I got sick of it and didn't want more.  I missed some of the reviews where it was stated that this recipe wasn't authentic.  Had I known, I wouldn't have wasted my time on this.  Will not make again.

This recipe is really good, but what I did instead is added pork slices instead of the bacon and added spaghetti, jalapenos, and mushrooms to my okonomiyaki. It tastes to die for ;)

I love okonomiyaki, but this was bland, boring, and fell apart on me. Plus, the overall recipe time is way off. You're cooking one at a time, for 8 minutes each, times 6. That's 48 minutes, not including prep time. It's a small gripe, but the rest of the recipe wasn't worth the extra time. There are much better recipes out there for this.

These were very good. I used shrimp and some left over tilapia instead of chicken, and I didn't have bok choy so I used some slightly tough romain lettuce. It all worked nicely and I will definitely make this recipe again. I like the idea that I can use what I have on hand and it will still be delicious!

I  mad this as a side dish so I left out the meat.  Didn't have zucchini or Napa cabbage.  I used regular cabbage, regular onion, yellow bell pepper, mushrooms and frozen green beans (thawed first.)    I doubled the recipe so I had extra.  I'll be making this often.  It's a great way to keep a quick healthy snack on hand.  I use my George Foreman grill to heat up the leftovers.

This is my go-to recipe for Asian pancakes and we love it!  My husband is a very picky eater and he can eat a ton of these.  I love that it's a recipe that you can tweak with whatever is in the fridge.

I make mine the way my mom used to. Just ground pork, cabbage and shiitake. You can also make a seafood version by substituting the meat with scallops or shrimp. Quick, easy weeknight meal!

I was looking for a way to use up random vegetables, namely nappa cabbage, and stumbled upon this recipe. It served my purposes greatly, though I have no idea how authentic the end result was. I just used regular flour. They turned out pretty good, but in the end, I think I'm just no much of a nappa cabbage fan! If I make it again, I'll leave that ingredient out.

This was a great and easy recipe for last minute and to clean out the fridge.  I used leftover turkey and the veggies that I had on hand (in addition to the cabbage and carrot), which included celery.  Took yassy's suggestion and swirled a little worcestershire sauce around the pan after the flip and topped each one with the catsup/worcestershire sauce mix.  Made a great meal with some Asian slaw salad.  Will definitely make again!!

It was pretty good but not my cup of tea.

Easy to make but kind of messy too!
