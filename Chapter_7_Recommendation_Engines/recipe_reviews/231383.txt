These are a hit in my Christmas collection of sweets I give out to my friends and relatives!  So easy to make!  The easier, the better,  for me! The sweet and salt, mixed with the almonds, is a real treat!  I also mix in about a 1/2 tsp of almond extract to the chocolate for more almond flavor. Have made these 2 years now, and will remain on my list of sweets to make for Christmas!
