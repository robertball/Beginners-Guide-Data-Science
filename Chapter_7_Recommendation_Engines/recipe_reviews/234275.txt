These sweet potatoes are easy, delicious, and a beautiful addition to a plate. The only differences to the recipe I made were to toast the pecan  pieces, adding a smoky note to the dish and to garnish with chopped flat leaf parsley. For people who want to add some spice to this dish, some crushed red pepper would be a great addition to the sweet. salty and smoky tastes. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Outstanding.  My husband thought it could use less maple syrup, but I loved it as is.  Would not change a thing to this recipe.

This is an amazing side dish and a great snack when I have leftovers. I even brought them to a BBQ and it was the first thing gone. One time I ran out of Sea salt but Kosher salt worked just fine. But I do find that a higher quality of syrup tastes better with the potatoes. This is a keeper

These are incredibly delicious! The second time I made them I cut the potato chunks too small, make sure to follow the recipe exactly and you will love the result!

I love this recipe! I don't need to boil my sweet potatoes in order to then cook or bake them in brown sugar. I just need to dice the uncooked, peeled spuds up, put them in a storage bag with some veggie oil, shake , dump them in a pan and pour some maple syrup on them after adding some salt. No pecans needed! Thanks for sharing this quick and yummy recipe. Such a time saver!

I did love this recipe.  I made it exactly as written and it was simple, yet delicious.  The syrup (I did use real maple syrup) made it perfectly sweet and the pecans added another very complimentary flavor.  I will use this recipe again.

This was a pretty good side dish - I wish I would have had maple syrup - used some syrup that no one liked on pancakes because it wasn't sweet enough - it was perfect for the potatoes. Forgot the nuts...

Not a big sweet potato fan, but his came out tasting like roasted pumpkin, reminded me of childhood:) I also toasted the pecans for an additional flavor and had them as a snack after Thanksgiving dinner, since it was sweet.

Fantastic recipe! I used real maple syrup and added the pecans half way through the baking time to toast them a bit.  We are not usually fans of roasted sweet potatoes but this recipe is so good! We will make these often for sure.

I made these sweet potatoes as written omitting the nuts. They were very tasty. Everyone loved the slight maple flavor.

Recipe recommends a bit too much maple syrup as I experienced - wound up with a bit of a syrupy soup at the bottom that liquidated the potatoes more than roasted them. The potatoes that did roast, however, turned out wonderfully!

Wanted something different for thanksgiving dinner and can’t have dinner without sweet potatoes and this turned out to be a big hit. Will most definitely use again for Christmas dinner.

These sweet potatoes were a hit at the family thanksgiving party this year! I used real maple syrup to ensure the flavor was strong enough and added a bit more salt to taste. Great option for those who want less sugar - it had a hint of maple but it wasn’t so strong that it overwhelmed the sweet potatoes. I’ll definitely be making this one again!

Very good! I toasted my pecans and gave this a very light spritz of garlic-infused olive oil before serving. I'm glad that I lined my pan with foil because the potatoes were starting to stick to it. A dish of this was supper on a hot summer night. Yummy! Thanks for the recipe.

This was super easy and had minimal ingredients. After I stirred it halfway through I sprinkled more salt, pepper, a dash of cumin, nutmeg and cinnamon. They were tender and perfectly done, and pretty fast (I always feel like sweet potatoes take forever). They are sweet but not overwhelming the natural flavor, with a little kick behind them. Love this recipe, and have been seeing it in cooking mags for years. Glad I finally tried it!

This was so delish!!  I left the peels on cause we like that and that's where so many of the nutrients are!  I used 3 smallish potatoes for 3 of us (and there were some leftover) so I halved all the other ingredients. I toasted the pecans in a little butter and cinnamon, so tasty! I cooked it for the full 30 minutes and they were perfect!

Delicious and easy method of preparing sweet potatoes.  If you're looking for a dish that isn't drenched in fat, sugar and calories, this is for you. We'll be making this one again!

These got great reviews! I roasted my pecans and added some cayenne to the potatoes.  Delicious.

yummy and easy! I used real maple syrup as well - they are deeelicious! I'm on a strict diet due to some medical things, and this meets all the needs --- paleo, gluten free, vegan!

I used olive oil and skipped the pecans because I didn't have any.  I sliced the potatoes so this took a bit longer than recipe suggested.  The sprinkle of sea salt on your portion of potatoes is what takes this to excellent!  I'm sure the pecans are wonderful but I didn't miss them.

These were absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe as written with the exception of using kosher salt instead of sea salt because that was what I had on hand.  My husband thought they were the best sweet potatoes he had ever had.  Certainly on the top of my list.  We will definitely be having these again.

Followed this recipe exactly and my family so enjoyed them! Simple and easy! Will keep sweet potatoes around regularly to have this as an easy side for any meal. Thank you!
