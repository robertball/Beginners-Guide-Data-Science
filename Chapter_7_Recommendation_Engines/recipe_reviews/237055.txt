Was  very good. 
I used Bell Pepper Jam instead of jelly, however.

I made this on a dare and I liked it. I didn't have a kaiser onion roll so I used a regular crusty roll. It was a little too sweet for me but I think that could be corrected with using a lower sugar jam. Next time, a little spice in the burger would be excellent
