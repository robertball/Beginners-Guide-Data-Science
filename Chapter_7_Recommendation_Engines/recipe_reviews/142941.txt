In most grocery stores, Vanilla Flavored Syrup can be found by the coffee and tea.

Basic recipe, this is good. But however, I had no clue where to find vanilla flavored syrup. And so I improvised. And of course I added lots of fruit, since they were calling out my name in the produce section. I did see these beautiful fruit tarts in NYC visiting that had this wonderful beautiful glossy glaze that caught my attention. And so I duplicated, something that worked for this. 4 tbsp white sugar, 2 tsp lemon juice, 2 tsp cornstarch, 4 tbsp water, 1 small envelope knox unflavored gelatin. Boil all ingredients except the Knox's until sugar is dissolved, remove from heat and stir in the Knox until gelatin is dissolved, cool slightly(it will thicken) with a pastry brush, gently brush over the top of fruit evenly, until all is covered....It worked like a charm on my fruited sponge cake tart...Will make again but add a cream cheese mixture next time instead of whipped topping. And I did have some left over glaze and I mixed it with remaining fruit I had sliced up as well that didn't get to make it on to the tart.

Used this recipe this summer.  Couldn't find sponge cake, so used yellow cake.  Made it in a 9x13 pan and decorated it in a pretty pattern using the variety of fruits.  Was wonderful to eat and pretty to bring to our BBQ as it got lots of compliments!  Would make again, if I had the time to decorate with all of the fruits.

I use vanilla Greek yogurt instead of the whipped cream on the sponge cake.  I also melt raspberry preserves and drizzle it all over the fruit (you could probably use any type of jelly or preserves) to make a nice glaze.

I really like this recipe, especially how versatile it is since you can change up the combination of fruits based on what is in season, on sale, looks good, etc.. I used vanilla pudding rather than whipped topping and I think that made for a better base, I made a simple syrup and added vanilla extract because I couldn't find vanilla flavored syrup in my grocery store.  I'd definitely recommend this recipe, you can do a lot with it and it comes out looking so pretty!
