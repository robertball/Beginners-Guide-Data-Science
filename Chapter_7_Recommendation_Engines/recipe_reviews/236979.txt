i probably should not rate this since i changed it. i didn't mean to, but i doubled the recipe. i used celery and included the tops...added them after the soup had simmered. i used a roto bird from sam's. shredded the meat. slapped the bones and skin in a cast-iron pot. this simmered @ 3 hours after a reducing boil. strained out the bones ans used the stock. i then used butter and olive oil to sauté the garlic, onions, and carrots. i added some reserved chicken stock when needed. this is a great cooler weather chicken noodle soup. i love the zoodles in this. i bet some fresh maters would be great here. great stuff! the zukes are terrific here. try this..your flu needs this!

Mom's:  Attention please:  this is the soup to fight colds! This is the perfect recipe when it's been cold and rainy and the kids come home with runny noses and sore throats.  I made this in my pressure cooker in 7 minutes using leftover grilled chicken breasts and threw in some potatoes to add a starch.  It's delicious, light and hits the spot. It also solves any gluten issues because everyone in the family can eat it meaning I don't have to make two different pots of soup.  The "zoodles" were fun but next time I'll make "zaccheroni" because the "zoodles" cut into long strips were sloppy to eat-the kids giggled the whole time though.  Do add the thyme as it really makes a difference.  Thanks BD Weld and your niece for the recipe; simple and effective and full of flavour.

This is THE PERFECT chicken soup!!! (Trust me, I'm a soup-a-holic!)  I try to eat lower-carb, and this soup allows me to "indulge" in chicken "noodle" soup without the extra carbs and calories. I'm always looking for new ways to use my Veggetti spiral slicer. The broth is so flavorful, like it's been simmering all day. This makes 6 very generous and healthy portions. I love the texture of the raw zucchini, which gives the soup some nice texture. I didn't have any leftover chicken, so I poached 2 breasts for about 10 mins in about 2 cups of seasoned water. I then used the leftover liquid to make up the broth, along with 1 carton of regular chicken broth and some leftover garlic-infused chicken broth I had. The dried herbs were spot on. To make the zoodles easier to eat, I piled them onto a cutting board, and cut them into 2-3" pieces.  Even though it's not soup weather right now, this did the trick warming me up in my chilly air conditioned office.  This will be put into regular rotation for sure!

Made this for lunch today with grilled cheese Sammie's. This was super easy to put together and it tasted great. I love the addition of the thyme. My boys are not the biggest fans of zucchini so I added my zoodles to the simmering soup for a few to make them super soft. Love this one. To make my zoodles I used the julienne peeler from pampered chef.

This soup is de-lish-shush! I mean it's really good! Easy to make chicken soup adding zoodled zucchini is a healthy way to get your veggies and like them too. I would not hesitate using this recipe to make Chicken Noodle Soup or Chicken Rice Soup or Chicken & Dumplings either. The taste is just down right comfort food. We loved it and I've made 3 batches already. Winner, winner...chicken dinner Brian. Thanks for a wonderful chicken soup recipe where we can eliminate the carbs and gluten and still have a fabulous and flavorful dish. Thank you Brian for a great (and I mean great) Chicken Zoodle Soup recipe!

Chicken Noodle has always remained my favorite soup but I realized it is due to the rich broth, carrots, celery, and onion combo and not really about the noodles. LOVED this! It was the zoodles instead of noodles that bumped this one up a notch over chicken noodle. Thanks for sharing bd.weld!

Enjoyed this soup very much! I used vegetable broth instead of the chicken broth because that’s what I had on hand. Added chopped baby kale at the very end for an extra veggie boost. Really liked the texture of the uncooked zucchini noodles but did let it soften for a few minutes after adding the soup on top. Delicious, healthy, low-cal soup. Will definitely make again.

Positively delicious soup! Would have given it five stars but I made one change--used homemade chicken stock instead of the canned. An excellent choice for "weight watcher" folks. Will make again!

Another great way to use my Padermo and zoodles! Love this soup! The seasonings are perfect. I used left-over turkey breast that I added at the end as well as zoodles left from last night's dinner.

Found it to be bland next time will add more garlic, onion
and some italian seasoning.  Liked the noodles which I cooked last 5 minutes.

Not my favorite.  Easy to make, but sequence of ingredients off.  ie: Should not put in minced garlic until last minute of sauce, Should have put in seasonings before adding broth to have tastes bloom.  We like our "zoodles" a little more done, so suggest putting in for last ten minutes of simmering.

So flavorful for a quick soup as written. I did add some chopped spinach I had, threw in a whole jalapeno for an extra kick and simmered the zoodles for a few minutes. Yummy, thanks for sharing!

Love this soup.  I made it per the recipe as far as ingredients.  Even without added salt (low sodium diet) it was very flavorful.  To cut back on fat a bit, I threw the vegetables in the pot without sautéing them and just left them to cook up in the broth.  I prefer my zoodles soft so added them to the pot for a few minutes before serving.  Love this soup.

This soup tasted so wonderful and fresh.  Using the zucchini instead of noodles is a great idea and I will make it this way always! It was great for left overs the next day storing the zucchini and the soup seperately then warming up the soup and pouring it over the zucchini.

I made this awesome soup but in the crockpot. For six hours and used 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts. At 6 hours took the chicken out and added my zoodles cut in smaller pieces and then shredded my chicken and stuck it back in for 15 minutes and everyone in my house lived it!

Made this when I had a head cold and needed hot chicken soup. This recipe did not disappoint.  I used fresh herbs instead of dried, otherwise kept everything the same. I love the way you pour it over the zucchini, which I just grated with the food processor. Worked great and gave this soup just the right flavor and texture.  My cold seemed to clear up faster too.

Good healthy soup that even the kids ate which is always a bonus. I grilled the chicken instead of baked and used chicken bone broth.  I prefer bolder flavors, but this recipe will please the masses including the kids... just keep some hot sauce on the side for those who prefer bolder flavors.  Side note: DONT make that side hot sauce Dave’s insanity sauce.  Put into broth

I made the recipe exactly as written using the breast meat from a rotisserie chicken.  I was skeptical at first, but pouring the hot soup over the zucchini is very effective.  The zoodles have a perfect al dente texture to complement the soup.

With homemade broth it just might rate five stars, but didn't have that on hand.  Did sub 3 tbsp. of  Premium Better Than Bouillon veggie base from a jar, bought at Kroger.  Added that to 9.5 cups of boiling water.  Thought it better than boxed or canned broth.  Did not add salt.  Kroger sells a 10.7 oz. pkg. of zucchini zoodles, which were cut into quarters.  Placed them in the bowls, allowing the broth to heat and cook them a little while.  My only major change would be to not chop the veggies too small; larger chunks would be more like the photo.    Overall, a good winter soup.  Thank you bd.weld.

I added one boullion cube for extra flavor and it tasted great. I was also gonna add some jalapeño for some heat but I didn’t have any.

I made changes too but the bottom line is: zoodles make great chicken zoodle soup!

I liked this as a healthier version with the zoodles. Instead of all breast meat I used half boneless skinless thighs chopped into cubes because they are juicier and more flavorful.

I love this soup, you can add other veggies and customize it as you like, make it even lower fat. I always use the same herbs recipe suggests and love the combo and taste. I did however prefer it with shredded rather than chopped chicken.

Listen, I did that Allrecipes thing where I changed some stuff. But I kept the amounts of spices and broth the same and didn't do anything too crazy, so I'm really rating the base recipe, which is definitely a winner!!!! I used barley instead of zoodles because I prefer it (started cooking it on the stove and transferred it to soup to finish cooking).  Added some cayenne pepper, too, which was good, and added some red potatoes cut into bite-sized pieces. I also doubled the amount of chicken and shredded it. It was honestly some of the best soup I've ever had.

Very good.  I used some butter  and olive  oil to  sautee  my veggies before adding my broth.  Also,  thought the zucchini noodles  needed a couple mintues of cooking time.

Doubled the herbs, added a can of white hominy, and a can of tomatoes.  Couple shots of tabasco, tsp worstershire and it no longer seemed healthy.  Family loved it!

This was a delicious soup!  We think that next time we'll just put small pieces of zucchini in the soup in place of the zoodles to make it easier to get on our spoons.  I made it just as in the recipe except I added the zoodles into the pot for the last minute of cooking instead of  having them raw in the bowl. The flavor is excellent!

This is an excellent soup! I followed recipe other than zoodles. I would've preferred them but didnt have any, so I broke up some angel hair spaghetti for noodles. Such a fresh taste. Thank you!

Made this this past week and it was good!   I also bought a spiralizer and was anxious to use it for the zucchini zoodles!
I personally didn't think the chicken flavored broth was strong enough, so added a dry envelope of Knorr's Cream of Leek soup to the broth and that kicked it up quite a bit.   Hubby loved it, as I did with my slight change.   Also loved the idea of keeping the zoodles separate to add when you eat.  Smart idea!!
Next time I will cook down chicken bones for better flavored broth or rely on the Knorr soup!!   Thanks!

The flavor after it was cooked was great! The only thing I might do next time is cut my zucchini in half before doing them into noodles. (Making them shorter, and easier to get into your mouth in one bite)

Love it, it's great for now the season is very cold, I made it exactly the way she had it on the recipe until I knew what I wanted to add or take away, it was perfect the way it was. But if I did do anything to it. I would add a few more veggies. Or just make it without the chicken for vegetarians, also a friend of mines who did not like zucchini tried some and said he could not tell that the zucchini was  zucchini he loved it. Thank you for sharing made it twice the second time accidently got turkey breast, was still awesome.

Very easy to make! Got 2 thumbs up for our 8 year old. Made this on the fly during a recent rainstorm, and it hit the spot. Used what was left of half a rotisserie chicken, perfect. It takes about 1/2 a zucchini per bowl. Allow about 5 minutes for the hot broth to soften/warm the zoodles before eating.

Really good. I used 1 lg onion (1 1/2 c), 3 garlic cloves, 4 carrots, 5 stalks celery, 1 lb chicken,  1 qt broth and 3 zucchini with all the seasonings but salt. I added the zucchini into the pot for 10 minutes. Calculated the sodium content (with Swanson unsalted broth) to be  under 1200 mg in entire pot. Makes 6 lg or 8 small servings.

This soup sure hits the spot on a cold day or for when you aren't feeling well! I made the recipe almost as is--had homemade chicken stock in the freezer and without garlic or onion because I can't have it right now. I must say I was not missing the garlic or onion, which makes this recipe extremely good and surely that much better if you can use garlic and onion!  Loved using zoodles instead of the usual noodles too. The hot soup takes care of cooking zoodles gently whereas adding them to the soup directly might result in too soft/mushy texture. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

One word Delicious. I made one change, i make my own broth so i used that, and i added a bit of diced rosemary.
I have a Paderno Spiral Slices and used that for the zucchini.
We love soup and this one is going to be made often.
Thank you bd.weld for the recipe, it is a keeper.

This was such good soup! Doubting Thomas hubby again had to eat his words after not believing that Chicken Zoodle soup was as good or better than Chicken Noodle.  Didn't change anything except only made for two of us so only needed one zucchini for dinner. Froze the rest of the soup for another time.

Just bought a spiralizer attachment for my kitchen aid mixer and wanted to make zoodles.  This recipe was great, I would definitely serve it to company.  It'll also be a great lunch to take to work.  I can't wait for my kids to try this, they re picky, but this might get them to eat zucchini.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is very good! The spices were SPOT ON! I added carrots and mushrooms and cream of mushroom soup just because I needed to use them up. We used homemade broth because we didn't have any canned, used what we had for oil since we were out of olive oil.  It's my first time cooking with zoodles, so I wanted to be careful, adding them in at the end. My zoodles were very thin. Next time, I'll leave on the peel and might make the noodles a little wider. As others have said, it's a perfect dish to make for someone with a cold, or someone who has been out in the elements shoveling snow.  This dish is very satisfying for chicken noodle soup lovers, but at the same time it's nice and light.  I would definitely serve this for company, and I will make this again!  This is a winner! Thanks SO MUCH for sharing!

I will definitely put this soup into a "favorite" file . Always a pleasant surprise to try a recipe for the first time and have it be sooo good. I read other reviews and the only change I made from the original recipe was to throw zoodles into the soup pit lady couple minutes of cooking time and to cut zoodles in half to make them easier to eat.

This is the perfect rainy day soup! With a few modifications, it's easy and inexpensive. I used chicken thighs instead of chicken breast and shredded the meat. Add a little lime for extra flavor!

This recipe was incredible and healthy! For one of the cups of chicken broth I added real chicken broth from the chicken I baked, it added real flavor! I preferred to put the zoodles in the soup last minute to soften them just a bit, which made them easier to eat! I also made the exact soup again, but vegan. This second time I used 4 different types of mushrooms versus chicken, and vegetable stock versus chicken... DELICIOUS! Highly recommend this recipe!

Very good flavor and easy. Added fresh mushrooms and omitted carrots. Made zoodles with Pampered Chef julienne peeler. Used Better Than Buillion instead of broth.  Will definitely make this again.

This came out fantastic. My kids even liked it! And one can be really picky. The only thing I didn't add was thyme cos I didn't have any. But it didn't taste like it was missing anything. Saving, and will make again soon.

So yummy!  I made as written, but I had cauliflower and baby spinach I need to use up. So I roasted the cauliflower and added that and the spinach when simmering. Turned out great and helped my cold.  Thank you so much for sharing!

Is delicious, just like traditional chicken soup broth.  But isn't a filling as real noodles, as is to be expected.  Works with Whole 30 diet which is a bonus for me.

I really like this soup a lot, thank you!  An excellent low carb, healthy option.  The only change  I made was to cut the zoodles into smaller pieces for ease of eating.

It is so delicious. I got a Padermo for myself this winter and I do so enjoy all the 'zoodles' recipes. Thanks for this one.

Loved this! The texture of the zucchini "noodles" makes you think you are really eating noodles. My kids even liked it!
