Salty and fishy.. but easy.. the food processor is the way to go for many of these tapenades, terrines, and mousses..
Not really for kids... big kids seem to like it though

I made this recipe as part of a Scandinavian Sm√∂rgasbord for about 8 people. No one seemed to like it very much. There was quite a bit left at the end of the party. It may be too strong for many tastes.

OH MY!  This is way to salty to even eat.  Will never ever make this again.   Sounded good but no way!
