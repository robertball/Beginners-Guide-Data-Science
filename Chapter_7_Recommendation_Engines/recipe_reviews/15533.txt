This recipe can be altered.  It basically is a good recipe but with a few changes.  First use 1/2" wooden dowels to make them on that have been cut to 4" lengths and soaked in oil overnight, then blotted before use.  This is like tempering a cast iron pan.  The cookies should slide off easier.  Next add 1 to 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar to the dough.  Lastly, reduce the amount of Crisco, not the butter, in the filling, and make sure you are not working with it in a hot kitchen, the fat will break down easily.  And make sure to dust the tops of the cookies with powder sugar when finished and put together.  Do not fill the cookies until they are completely cold.  These freeze exceptionally well if there are any left to freeze!  I have been making these for special occasions for decades and are always the hit of the  table.

This is by far the best ladylock recipe I have ever tried.  It is much easier to make than the yeast-based recipe, and the dough rolls out like a dream.  Make sure that you chill the dough sufficiently, and that you flour your work surface generously.  I did add 2 Tbsp. of sugar to the dough.  These came out better than the local bakery!  Thanks for this recipe!

If I can figure out how to I am going to submit the easiest recipe of all for these and tell you all the tricks I learned through the last 30 years. 0;D As far as time consuming, the recipe I am going to submit isn't quick as time consuming but any cookie along this line is, where you make a shell and then filling and then fill them.  the answer to that is pace yourself, they don't have to be finished the same day. Make your shells one day and then ill them the next and you and they won't seem so overwhelmed! So keep your eye out for my Super Easy Clothespin Cookies, Pace yourself no matter what recipe you use and enjoy!

I have used this recipe for two yrs
the dough is a little to soft and sticky even after chilling ,however all i did was
knead a little flour into the dough before I rolled it .they came otu perfect I have used this recipe this way for 2 yrs and never had any trouble
however I use my own cream cheese or chocolate Icing to fill them.

This recipe was time consuming and hard.  The filling was greasy and the pastry was bland.  I will not make this recipe again.

Time consuming, yes...but worth it. I found the filling was a little runny (probably something on my part) so I added about a half a cup of cream cheese (I got it to the consistency I liked...). YUMMY! I also added food coloring to the filling in honor of the holiday season!

time consuming.  Even after following the recipe to a tee, still could not get the pastry to slide off the clothespin.

Vanilla is okay- but McCormick's Vanilla Butter and Nut extract really makes these cookies memorable.  I make 2 batches of these cookies for family.  They look forward to these ever Christmas.

I have made clothes pin cookies for years and my family loves them.  I just wanted to suggest to the people having trouble getting the baked dough off the sticks to use 3/4 dowel sticks cut into 5 inches long and wrap them tightly with foil and they slide right off and can be used year after year
