This is a simple way to make chili. I don't add the can of baked beans instead I use 2 large cans of the "mild" chili beans. Sometimes I make it with turkey and sometimes not. If you want to make it even quicker leave out the meat entirely. It also tastes good if you saute 1/4 cup of onion and green pepper, in a little butter, and add that. It is also good topped with some grated cheese and a little sour cream.

This is an ok recipe but it needs a little more seasoning. Try cooking some onions in with the meat and adding chili powder and cumin plus some smoky flavored paprika, garlic and oregeno for the true chili taste.

This was super easy! Save yourself the dishes and just cook the turkey and tomatoes in the soup pot that you will add the beans to. I used diced tomatoes b/c that is what I prefer. I had a packet of a blend of chili seasonings that I just put in because the recipe did not call for any seasonings. I liked how fast and easy everything came together.

We added ALOT of extra spices but the ease of just dumping in cans of beans was wonderful!  So easy to make and very very good!

I like this recipe a lot! I HAD to tweak it, because I didn't have all the ingredients.  I used two cans of Kidney beans, 1 can of refried beans(instead of the pintos),a chili season packet, and chili flavored stewed tomatoes. It was soo fast! Thanks!

I was real happy with this dish. I read the reviews before I made it and agreed that the spice needed a bit of kicking up so I added a few chili powder,salt,pepper,cumin,cardamom,and cayenne powder.The baked beans are a great flavor addition.
 This was so easy to make and adjust to your taste. it is a keeper in my book.

This is a yummy, very easy chili recipe.  The thing that caught my eye was that this recipe can be changed to match anyone's tastes depending on how much spice and seasoning you want to add to it.  Personally, I am not a fan of spicy so I made the chili per the directions, and added a bit of seasoning just to enhance the flavor.  I took about half of the chili out of the pan and then added some jalepenos and other spices for my husband, who loves spicy chili.

I think it has all the right ingredients and is a very simple recipe except there is no mention of any type of seasoning.  I enhanced the recipe with salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, cayene pepper for heat, corn, and zucchinni.  The recipe was improved and much more tastier. I did not care for  the tomato paste.  Also, I did not use the cheddar and sour cream at all.  I will definitely prepare this recipe again and  maybe use blean beans vs.  baked beans.

Not a fan of the baked beans -- I'll swap with another bean next time. Cook the turkey in the soup pot, drain, add everything else -- then add (or to taste) 2 tbsp chili powder, 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp garlic powder, 2 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp cayenne or MORE, black pepper to taste. I'll probably add some corn next time, or put it over some macaroni.  The speed is a big plus, and you can still make it fast with some seasoning. The cheese and sour cream save it, but you don't generally have that sitting around.

It's definitely easy and quick. I think it benefits from some added seasoning, cumin, chilli powder, smoked paprika come to mind.  I like the variety of beans, and would consider subbing in or adding black beans. Without the meat, this is an excellent "pantry meal" for emergencies because everything is shelf stable, especially if served with some ready rice. However, I shudder to think of how off the chart high the sodium content must be using all of those canned goods. I suggest using lower sodium versions of everything in a can!  I am also concerned about BPA from the cans. I would save this for rare occasions but will stock it for those times when a quick & easy shelf-stable meal is needed. I imagine it would make a very comforting dinner for those occasions.
