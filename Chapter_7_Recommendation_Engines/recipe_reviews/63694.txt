This was pretty good...not excellent but pretty dang good. I took the suggestion of marinading the chicken in white wine (chardonnay) for a few hours; I also sprinkled it w/ marjoram, garlic salt & pepper w/ the marinade. I made sure, when sauteing the chicken, that my heat was up high enough so that I could get a nice caramelized coat on the chicken. Leave it alone & don't turn it over until it has caramelized... this adds lots of flavor to the drippings & to the chicken. I too used a can of stewed tomatoes (w/ italian seasoning) instead of fresh tomatoes & I added a bit more wine to the skillet when I added the tomatoes. I didn't think this was an unattractive dish at all. In fact when I was plating it on a platter, my husband commented that it looked pretty. I served this w/ mushroom flavored basmati rice (I added some sliced red grapes to it) & steamed broccoli w/ butter. Will make again.

Easy and very tasty. Made the house smell great! I sauteed spinach in garlic and olive oil and served it over that. Makes it a much more visually appealing meal and look darn elegant!

This was good and easy. I didn't measure the salt and pepper, just sprinkled it on both sides and added a little seasoned salt,too, since this had been reviewed by a few as bland. It wasn't bland, and I agree with a previous reviewer who mentioned it reminded someone of chicken cacciatore. The tomatoes did add that taste. I'm not a fan of foods with a strong wine taste, so I did half chicken broth, half white wine. We also added a jar of artichoke hearts, and we ate it with rice and green beans. I will definitely use this recipe again, and will experiment with add-ins.

My entire family enjoyed this!  SBD has been challenging at times, with four small children, so this was a nice meal.  I used the boneless skinless thighs for the kids, and breasts for my DH and I.  I also marinated the chicken overnight in the white wine (use real wine, not the stuff labeled cooking wine!! - cheap wine is better than that stuff), garlic and pepper.  I grilled it, then added the marinade back in, and I really liked the flavor, as did my DH.  I served this with wild rice, and it was really good.

Good, but I know what to improve on for next time.  I did the boullion (someone suggested--to make the sauce thicker) and i used garlic pepper to flavor the  chicken.  It came out very salty (and i love salt, so this was bad)  so next time i'll probably just skip the boullion.  I had to use canned stewed tomatoes, which was fine, but I think fresh would be better.  I marinated the chicken for about an hour in the wine and it came out nice and tender.  I used cooking wine (the only white wine i had) and it came out fine.  
All in all - total winner, but next time I'll minimize the salt factor.

This one is a keeper!!  I have been looking for a recipe that a "step up" from the ordinary.  Healthy too!!  As with mosts cooks, I changed it up a bit according to what I had on hand.  I used a pkg of boneless, skinless, thighs (7 total).  (I think they make a moister chicken.)  I also added a layer of provolone cheese to the chicken after placing it in the platter.  I added diced onion, and chopped mushrooms to the tomatoes (i used roma tomatoes).  The sauce was yummy!  I used just a plain white wine for the sauce.  I think hubby may actually eat healthy if I continue to find great, easy recipes like this one.  May try it on the in-laws this weekend when they come into town!!  Thanks a bunch!!

I had my doubts about this recipe, but it turned out to be extremely flavorful. The broth was delicious. You can easily add shrimp to this dish and serve it over pasta

This was fantastic.  I did a little adding...My husband is allergic to fresh garlic so I used minced onions instead w/ some garlic powder.  I added about 1 cup of wine(about half way up the chicken.)  At this point I sprinkled some Basil and Rosemary on the Chicken.  When I simmered the Tomatoes I sprinkled them with Basil too.  To thicken up the sauce, I added about a half a packet of Chicken Gravy mix and served it over Whole Wheat Pasta.  I served this with Asparagus, and it was sooooooo good!!!!  Definite Keeper!

This was really only good b/c it was so easy and quick. It tasted mediocre and didn't absorb any of the flavor of the wine.  Maybe next time I'll parboil the chicken in the wine instead of adding it after the chicken is already cooked.  Mushrooms wouldn't be a bad idea either.

This recipe was the best!!! My husband gets upset when I make chicken b/c it's not his favorite and he loved this! Even my 5 and 2 yr olds ate this up and they eat nothing.. I added mushrooms in with tomatoes and it was delicious. the only wine I had on hand was a muscadine which is very sweet and I was worried it'd be too sweet for this, but it turned out excellent. And as a bonus, made the house smell great even from outside!! I served with asparagus and tomato parmesan pasta. Excellent meal!! I will make this again and again especially for company.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I used organic canned diced tomatoes and sliced mushrooms in the wine sauce.  I also served this over sauteed spinach with garlic and some mashed cauliflower.  This is one to keep in the rotation.  YUMMY!!

I used a can of stewed tomatoes, instead of fresh (I was out) but it came out delicious! The wine makes the chicken really tender, and layering the tomatoes on top of the chicken also looks really pretty, a good presentation dish for company.

Whole family loved this one.  I left the chicken breasts whole, added a little chicken bouillon to the wine sauce, added a tad more garlic and some canned mushrooms.  At the end I threw in chopped fresh basil.

I loved this recipe. I was worried at first because (no offense) the picture isn't really sellin' it for me. I did some slight tweaking, after cooking the chicken in the wine, i then added a can of italian stewed tomatoes to the skillet, sprinkled some fresh italian parsley over it, covered and let it simmer just long enough for me to make some spinach angel hair pasta. i then laid the chicken/tomato/wine sauce mixture over a small bed of the pasta. IT WAS AMAZING. My kids (11 mths, 2, and 4 ) ate TWO helpings, and my husband (not big on thin sauces) actually asked me to make it again. I love this site!! lol.

A nice, simple, light dish. When I make this again though, I may try adding more flavor to it by adding more salt, pepper, slices of onions, and maybe even some mushrooms.

The pan sauce/drippings was really good, especially on the tomatoes (I used canned stewed tomatoes, and drained the liquid out of it beforehand before adding it to the pan). I also added canned mushrooms, and ate the food over sushi rice. 

However, I found that the chicken, itself, was very bland. I think I just didn't use enough salt and pepper on it. I'll make this recipe again with more salt and pepper on the chicken to see if it's any better.

I accidentally used champagne, which made it even better :)  If add more wine and let it boil longer, it gets a little thicker (if you like a thicker sauce).  Plus, you can add a little chicken bouillon and that also thickens it up.

I added a few spices because I just don't know how to cook without my hand reaching into the spice cabinet.  Otherwise, I made it as is.  Fresh tomatoes, in my opinion, make the dish.  Next time, I think I will marinade the chicken as several suggested.  And use fresh Italian parsley for a garnish.  Overall, very tasty.
