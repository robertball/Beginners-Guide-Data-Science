Instead of regular milk, I used fat free evaporated milk for a creamier texture. I did not add the full amount of salt, I just added enough to taste. I also used dried parsley because that was all I had. This turned out really good, though my kids said they thought it needed more swiss. I'd like to try this with half cauliflower next time to cut back on the carbs, I think that would be really good. There's a bit leftover, I'll edit my review tomorrow and comment on wether this rewarmed well.

This was pretty good.  I used good swiss cheese and otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It has good flavor, but with all of the dairy in it, it was a very heavy dish and a bit on the greasy side.  I will probably make this again, but I might put something extra in like broccoli or spinach to add some greens to it.

Delicious inexpensive dish for a potluck.  I got asked for the recipe.  I used 4 tsp of dried parsley for the fresh and swiss instead of gruyere.  I mixed the parmesan in with the dish.  I think I will try some fresh chives next time.

I bookmarked this recipe a while back to try, but for some reason never got around to it until now.  I feel so ashamed.  I made two minor changes - I used half gruyere and half monterey jack because OMG is gruyere expensive.  Also I added half of the cheese to the bechemel sauce before pouring it over the casserole to get the cheese flavor through the whole thing.  I think in the future, I might use scallions instead of white onions to give it a bit more "green" flavor and more bite.  Otherwise, an excellent recipe!

Soooooo Good! I made this recipe exactly as the recipes says and it was perfect. I went with the shedded swiss cheese at the end and my family at it all. Thank you.

Very hearty & filling recipe with wonderful flavor.  It also reheats well in the microwave.  Thanks for sharing.

Extremely tasty and a great way to use up the leftover ham from Easter!  I used regular Idaho russets instead of red potatoes and cheddar cheese instead of swiss, and it turned out great.  I also didn't have any fresh parsley on hand, so I chopped up some celery greens instead--it worked really well!  My husband loved it.

I absolutely love this dish!  It was similar to a very thick ham and potato cheese soup.  The original recipe makes quite a bit.  I made it for 3 people and we still had a little over half left!  I substituted half the parley required with chives and used swiss instead of gruyere.

Very nice additions to a ham and potato cream based casserole.
