I love rabbit more than chicken, so I was excited to find a new and different recipe.  My husband is a traditional rabbit cooker (you know, hunter style or cream style), which is fine, but I was ready to get out of the box.  My kids and I loved this recipe!  I did tone down the sweetness by correcting it with more chicken stock and boiling it back down (for my husband).  I also cooked everything in a big dutch oven and just pulled out the rabbit to saute the veggies and drain the oil.  I did remove the bones from the rabbit while the veggies cooked; that allowed me to eat my dinner rather than cut up my children's!  AND no child felt badly about cutting up Bugs Bunny :). I think it helped!  5 stars from me and the kids and 4 from the traditional American hunter (whatever!  I'll be making this again!)  YUM!  Oh...I couldn't help but add a touch of saffron.  Just couldn't help myself!  It was beautiful and delicious! I would have taken a picture, but I was too excited to eat!  Even the next day, I had to say to a friend who was over, "Here, you have to try this!!"  I know I'm blabbing, but it really rocked!

My husband said this was the best rabbit that he has ever had.  A family friend had no idea that it was rabbit when served.  The chili pepper added just the right amount of spice.  I did not know what a bird's eye chile was so I used a serrano.  It turned out great!!! Thanks!

Crockpot version: cut everything to desired bite size; put everything in pot (not need to saute); cook for 8 hours on low. Meats comes out tender and broth fan-freak'n-tastic! Can reduce broth on stove top if want more of a sauce before serving.

Fantastic!  This was my first time cooking rabbit- I don't think I'll be trying any other recipes.  This had a very sophisticated taste, but was so easy to cook!  Just lots of simmering!  Thanks for sharing this one!

We're in love with this dish! Just made it tonight (we raise meat rabbits) and it was the best rabbit dish we've made so far. This recipe is a keeper. I added two serrano peppers and it really had a nice kick. The coconut milk made a delicious sauce that we ate over brown rice. I pressure cooked it for 30 minutes and the meat was falling-off-the bones tender.

I was a bit sceptical as I'd never made rabbit before, but having just eaten the meal, I had to run back to the computer and give it a full five-star rating here. THANK YOU for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Overall this was a great tasting dish. Although I did a few changes and would do more next time. First of all, I browned the meat and then put that and all the rest of the ingredients (except I put a small, fresh cayenne pepper instead of the chili pepper) into my pressure cooker and cooked for 30 mins like one of the other people tried. (I just love the taste and tenderness that the pressure cooker gives!)  
After the 30 mins. I took out the meat and deboned it...it was falling off the bone and VERY tender and tasty! I thickened the liquids with cornstarch and water and put the meat back in. The stew had too much heat (spice from the cayenne pepper) so I added about 1/4 c. of extra coconut milk. That helped alot! Next time I will add carrots, celery, and that extra milk. That should be just about perfect! :) Hubby loved it! We look forward to using this one again...thanks!

This did not work well for me. The rabbit ended up being overcooked, and falling apart. It was very bony, and hard to eat. The taste was average - not a lot of wow factor.

Rabbit was very tender, Cream of coconut was a very nice touch, well balanced sweetness, perfect with rice. Hubby loved it.

This was ok.  The meat turned out nice and soft as all the reviews state.  I found that there was very little flavour.  I actually took some sambal sauce and mixed it with a little left-over coconut milk, and poured that over my plate.  Otherwise it was just boiled rabbit with peppers.

I hate to spoil the perfect rating, but we just didn't like this.  I don't know if it's the recipe itself or that some of my the ingredients weren't of the utmost quality.  My cream of coconut had been sitting on the shelf for quite some time and had separated, although I'm told that is normal.  Also, my hot chile pepper didn't seem very hot so there was nothing to offset the sweetness.  I am going to give this one a try again in the future because I'm always looking for unique and intersting dishes to serve at wild game feasts.

Loved it!  Didn't have bird's eye chiles, but used jalapenos instead.  It came out with a nice kick.  I also made it in a dutch oven and was able to shave down the simmering time by 30 min.  The rabbit falls off the bone, and the seasoning is spot on.  Goes great over white rice.  Thanks for posting this!

I didn't have any bell peppers or bird's eye chile but it was FANTASTIC! I loved it. Hubby thought it was okay but he is Greek and is used to eating rabbit another way. I didn't want to waste the left over sauce so I cooked rizo in it -it was delicious. Thank you!

This was great! My kids ate it up and asked for seconds. The meat was fall off the bone delicious, and all I left out was the chile (or kids would have run for the hills!). Can't wait to make this for guests!!

I raise rabbits. This is one of my main go-to recipes. For me it always ends up tender, not dry, with a balanced savory and slight sweet flavor. Perfect with rice.

I've made this 3 times now and it is always a hit.  Even people who proclaim that they don't like coconut love this dish!  I believe this is because coconut flakes are NOT used; instead cream of coconut is used and the flavors meld, blend, and flirt with the other flavors in this recipe and don't call attention to the coconut flavor per se.

This is definitely a keeper!  Since 2 of my children don't like spicy  I only used half of a Serrano pepper (next time I'll use entire pepper).  I also added 2 carrots.  I cooked in a pressure cooker for 35 min after browning instead of simmering on stovetop as I was running short on time.  Meat fell off the bone.  And it smelled oh so good!  Only regret is that I didn't take a picture...next time.  Thank you so much for sharing

The recipe has the potential to be good, but seriously lacks acid to counter the gaminess of the rabbit. That plus the lack of consistency in ingredient labeling is why I gave this recipe two stars.  

The coconut is very nice and we really enjoyed both the flavor and texture that the coconut provided. Though when we made it, we used condensed milk and coconut extract as a substitute, because our local stores did not carry cream of coconut.

Decent way to prepare rabbit. We usually make it more like southern stew with dark gravy, but this was different but very good. I did add saute all the veggies and braise rabbit and add all to the crockpot to cook down. Came out flavorful and nice and tender.

I made this a couple of weeks ago for my husband and I.  We both loved it!  I am making it again tomorrow for more of the family.  Very rich and yummy.  The coconut cream gives it a sweet taste.  I didn't serve it with rice; we just ate it with a biscuit.  One tip I use for cooking rabbit (we raised our own):  I put the frozen rabbit in a crockpot for the day and remove the skin from the bones.  Then I use the cooked rabbit in recipes which actually cooks it twice.  I find the rabbit is much more tender and falls apart instead of being touch and rubbery.

Great Recipe! Rabbit is boney so you must take care to remove bones prior to serving. You will still get a few so be careful with little ones.I also like to sear the rabbit on a smokey grill rather than in a pan  but both ways work well. After Step 2 carefully remove the bones, then do step 3. This is a delicious recipe and quite easy to make.I recommend doubling the recipe.Its great left over, but I doubt you will get a chance to find that out! Eliminate the hot pepper and reduce the black pepper to taste if little ones are eating. Otherwise leave it as written. It is peppery but very good.I like slightly more coconut cream as I usually cook more rabbit than it calls for.

Oh my god. This recipe is unbelievable. Of course, I don't add the chile because I'm a MAJOR wimp when it comes to spicy. But if there is a dish that I could eat regularly and not get sick of... it's this. It's seriously delicious.

Tried the dish last night. The fresh veggies and other ingredients complemented the rabbit perfectly. Delicious.

The coconut cream gives this dish a Southeast Asian flair. I left out the chili so the kids could try it but sadly they didn´t care for it. I´ll keep this recipe around for when I have company.
