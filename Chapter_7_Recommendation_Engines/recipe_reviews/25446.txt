Very good. I marintaed salmon overnite with this and it was very tasty.  Mine was a tad on the salty side (but I didnt purchase a low sodium terryaki sauce either.)

This turned out pretty good.  Much better than using just the bottle of teriyaki sauce alone.  I marinated chicken for a few hours and grilled it.  Then served with white rice and broccoli.

Teriyaki Marinade IV Haiku: "Surprise! This was good. And so easy to make. Made my chicken 'YUM!'" No changes necessary - an easy to prepare marinade, much more flavorful than a bottle of teriyaki sauce from the store, although I am partial (on lazy grilling days) to Trader Joe's Island Soyaki.
