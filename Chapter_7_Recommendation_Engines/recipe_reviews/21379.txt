My husband and I loved this recipe.  I did make a few changes because I did not have the correct ingredients on hand.  I used Ritz crackers and cheddar cheese soup.  In addition I used fresh steamed asparagus and then added milk to the soup mixture.  The results were great, thanks!

This was the first recipe I've ever taken from this website (new user) and it was a huge success!!  I made it for a holiday party but it didn't get eaten because there weren't many asparagus-eaters, so I brought it to another gathering the next day and we ran out, and had people asking for more, and for the recipe!  It was great....and that was as leftovers.  I modified the recipe to include fresh asparagus instead of canned, Cheese-its instead of saltines (as one other reviewer suggested), and cream of asparagus instead of mushroom.  I think it provides a lot of flexibility for improvising, based on what's in the cabinets.  Thanks for the recipe!

I would recommend not putting the juice from the canned asparagus into the liquid mixture, the flavor of that stuff is horrible.  I like asparagus, but this didn't taste good at all.

Delicious! I used fresh asparagus (didn't steam first, just threw it in), cut the butter down a little, and cut down the amount of crumbs a little. I can see where canned asparagus wouldn't be good - I'll only make this recipe with fresh. Oh, and I used more asparagus than what was called for.

Everyone at home LOVED this recipe! I used frozen asparagus, which made the casserole more about the veggie and the soup and crust more of an accessory. I forgot the almonds because I was putting it together fast. That, by the way, is possibly my favorite part of this dish. It's so fast! It takes about two minutes to put the layers altogether, and it only takes 20-30 minutes to cook! Delicious! I'm going to be making this again and again!

My dad is a big fan of this casserole.  It's a snap to make, too.  I use butter flavored crackers (e.g. Ritz) in place of the saltines, and a second can of asparagus.  (Just the spears, not the juice.) I find this gives the casserole a better ratio of veggies to starch.

This was excellent! I used fresh asparagus and steamed it first using chicken broth. Then I realized the only crackers I had on hand were Triscuts, which turned out to be a good substitute. Eliminated the almonds and followed the recipe otherwise and it was fantastic, thanks!

I got plenty of raves about this recipe.  Everyone loved it!  If you decide to use fresh asparagus, I recommend steaming it and cutting it into bite size pieces.  I used fresh asparagus that I had blanched and frozen--it was too stringy.  Today I am going to chop it first.

Took to a potluck and it all disappeared.  I used 2 pkgs. very thin frozen asparagus (thawed) cut into 3" pieces, 2 cans mushroom soup and added a couple of layers of sliced hardboiled eggs.  Bake just 'til heated through.  Think I overcooked a bit.

5 stars as written, 10 with the changes I made.  No almonds, 2 cans of asparagus, 1 can of mushroom soup, and mixed the cracker/cheese mixture in with the asparagus instead of layering it.  Buttered the dish real good and it didn't stick - perfect way to eat canned asparagus!  Thanks for the idea!!!

Nice casserole, even the kids enjoyed it.  I would definitely make this again, after all, there are only so many things you can do with asparagus.

I used fresh asparagus as many others have. The recipe was good, but a bit salty. Seemed like a waste of good asparagus when grilling it with evoo and salt and pepper is so nice.

This recipe was pretty good.  The asparagus from a can was pretty icky, so I'll probably use fresh or frozen and just cook it ahead of time next time I try this one.

Pretty good... but needs some "pizaz".  My boyfriend enjoyed the asparagus part, but we both tended to eat around the greesy saltine crackers.  Oh, I also substituted the cream of mushroom for cream of celery... not to fond of the fungi.  =)  With the right main dish, I may serve this again for family and close friends.

I made this recipe and we liked it only I would put a thin layer of crushed crackers on the bottom of my dish and then add the cheese. Same for the second layer. 2 cups of crackers was way too much and made this recipe too salty. I will make it again, as we did like it, and maybe add a little soy sauce to the soup and mushrooms.

I thought this was an easy dish to prepare.  Based on other reviews, I used freshly steamed asparagus.  I also used 1/2 4 ounces milk in place of the canned juice.  I took this to a potluck and everyone loved it.  I would agree that it doesn't keep very well (gets a little mushy) but does not affect the taste.  I thought this recipe could easily be modified use other favorite vegetables.  My husband loved this so I will be making it again and again!

This dish rocked!  A total hit!  I didn't have the almonds on hand, but it still was yummy.  I did add broccoli to the recipe which worked nicely.. and I  used the extra cheese I had to top the casserole.  Yummy!!!

Made it for easter.  Yummy.  I used Ritz crackers though and it make it a tasty crust.  If you like asparagus, you will like this.

My boy friend, who is not a big fan of cooked vegetable definitely liked this dish. It is vegetarian  but still just good enough to make you feel happily full, but not to heavy.

Made this for a potluck dinner and all enjoyed it!  Some changes I made:  use 2 cans of asparagus (only use the juice from 1 can) and use a full can of cream of mushroom soup.  Really Good!

I found the casserole to be a bit on the salty side.  I wasn't too impressed, and my husband said it would be better with fresh asparagus to give it some crunch.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  The asparagus was mushy and two cups of crackers was too much, it created clumps of breading in bottom of casserole.  This recipe flew out of my recipe box.

I took the review advice and made it with fresh asparagus, and it was great!  The kids didn't like it, but kids don't really tend to enjoy asparagus any way.  My mom liked it, though--it was good.

This is a huge hit with my seven year old, although she was not crazy about the almonds.  Easy to improvise, used cream of celery soup once and fresh asparagus instead of canned, with a little milk and some of the water used to steam the asparagus.  Will try with cheese nips next time as another reviewer suggested, that sounds good.

It was too salty, and I had to use more cheese and saltine crackers to comfortably layer the casseroles. I expected it to taste much better. On the bright side, however, the directions were really easy to follow and easy to put together.

I made this for my family, and it was a HUGE hit. They all thought I was crazy for wanting asparagus. No one had ever had it before. But, WOW! It was so good! I used a 3 qt casserole dish though. It fit perfectly. Thanks for a new family favorite kdb!

It was yummy, I substituted Cheese Nips for saltines because my husband is a cheese addict.  It was a little soupy.  Next time I plan to only use half a can of soup and maybe 2 cans of asparagus.  I'm wondering if I should try fresh asparagus.  I think that may make the dish even fresher tasting.

Canned asparagus? NOT in my lifetime! Fresh is Best especially in this Yummy dish! Ksbeeson, so sorry its taken SO LONG for your Wonderful recipe to get a face! I made this as written and my kids n I ate it UP! I steamed the fresh spears 2 minutes in the nuker and added a handful of sliced green onion. Back I the nuker for 8 minutes and it was on the table:)Thank You Ksbeeson

YAY FOR ASPARAGUS!  I was so excited to see this recipe because I love asparagus and I love casseroles!  I used cheese soup and oyster crackers as replacements because that's what I had in my cupboard and it was sooooooooo good!!!  Even the next day!

I used fresh asparagus, and cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom.  A hit at the potluck!

Not sure why this recipe was loved by so many.  I'm glad many others enjoy it, but my family and I just didn't like it at all.
