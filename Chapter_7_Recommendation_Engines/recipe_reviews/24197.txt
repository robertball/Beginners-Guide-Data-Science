I just made this pie and it came out great I do suggest using 2 tablespoons of flour to thicken the filing.  It really tastes yummy!

This pie is WONDERFUL! The crust, in particular, was a dream come true! I have 
tried so many recipes for crust and my Irish mother would always tell me, "Butter, flour, salt and
water is all you need," but I wouldn't listen. Mom knows best! The filling is great, too as
it doesn't have too much spice to it (some apple pie recipes are drowned in cinnamon
and nutmeg and you can't taste the apples). Since I go to the orchard to pick mine,
I want to be able to taste them (that's the only thing I do differently with this recipe--
I don't use Granny Smith). Thanks so much for submitting this!

A good pie, but a little flat tasting, I thought.  Got compliments, but I would have liked it better with some ice cream, I think.  The crust was easy to make, but not as flaky as your typical shortening-based crust.  A nice basic apple pie though.

I did not make the crust recipe because I had a recipe for a crust that tasted like a sugar cookie but I did use the recipe for the filling and it turned out kind of runny.  I would use a little more flour (like another tablespoon). But other than that it was a great pie

The crust on this recipe was not very good, it was very hard, husband and kids wouldn't eat that part of the pie,just the filling which was great, not too sweet and just right.  I'd much rather just go buy a ready-made crust and then do just the filling part of this recipe.  Not a winner here!

Thank you so much for posting this!  I was flitting through the net trying to find something like my mother's recipe and this is exactly it.  Even though "mom" always made the best because it is what we grew up with, it really is the perfect pure apple pie recipe.

I followed the recipe, except I didn't have any cinnamon, and it tasted so good! I also couldn't wait for the four hours for the crust and used it right away. The pie was much better the next day. The crust was a little crispy the night I made it, but the next day it was perfect (soft). Thank you for making my first homemade apple pie a success!

I followed the recipe, but when i pulled it out of the oven the pie was full of  water. So i drained it out and cooked the pie longer and then poured a little of the water back in to keep the moisture. All in all it was very tasty, but next time i will cut bigger slits and let it cook for longer.

My first at baking a pie and I followed this recipe and it came out very well. Just watched a couple of videos to learn making the pie crust besides this recipe. Thanks!
