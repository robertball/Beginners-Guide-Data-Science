I made this last night to go with a rotisserie chicken and mesquite chicken wings from Costco.  The grits were amazing!  The smokey flavor of the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce adds a nice "kick" to it.  You can adjust the spice level of the dish by increasing or decreasing the amount of peppers. You should be able to find the peppers (canned) in the Mexican aisle of your supermarket.  These grits were wonderful, easy to make, and I'm having them with my lunch again today.  This is a keeper!
**UPDATE** I made this again only I was pressed for time and didn't have any chiles on hand this time, and I also only needed 4 servings instead of 12 so this is what I did:  I adjusted the servings to 4, used Quaker quick grits and instead of the amounts of broth and milk in the recipe, I used the chart on the grits container for 4 servings in the stovetop directions. I used half broth, half milk.  I sautéed the onion first, then added the chipotle with adobo to the onion and continued to sauté.  I didn't have any green chiles on hand but I would have added them at the same time as the chipotle. Then I added the broth and milk and brought it to a boil and then turned it down to low and whisked in the grits and cumin, salt and pepper.  Covered and cooked for 5 minutes while I shredded the cheddar cheese.  I added all the cheese to the sauce pan and stirred it around until it was melted and the grits were creamy and done just like that.  I didn't put it in the oven to bake, didn't have ti

Delicious! The only grits I've ever had before were from a breakfast place and they tasted like flavorless goo. :) Needless to say, I've never been to thrilled with them.   I finally decided to find a recipe, and see what kind of flavor grits can have. I'm so glad to have found this recipe!   I followed the reviewer recommendations of cutting back on the salt (I used 1 tsp instead of 2) and I used 1 tsp of cumin instead of 1tbsp. I also used 2 chipotle peppers instead of 4 and 'mild' green chilies. So good, so creamy, so cheesy! I think you could easily omit the baking step. They were just as tasty right out of the pot.   A perfect blend of flavors. I served these with smoked pulled pork and corn from my garden. A keeper!

Good grits. The cumin was a bit overpowering though. I will make these again but use less cumin and maybe add a little salsa or chopped tomatos.

I enjoyed this recipe very much. It may have been a touch spicy and a bit too salty so next time I make this I will decrease the chipotles to 3 and the salt to 1 tsp. I will definately make this again.

It's so tasty!  I like this new take on grits.  Really liked the heat.  I did take down on the chipotle, cheddar, and took out the chilies altogether.  And I didn't bake the grits.  It is truly delicious!

Really tasty grits, just cut back on the salt and cumin (I cut both down to about 1/2 the stated amount) and adjust the amount of chipotle to your liking; I love spice so I used the entire amount called for. Not sure its necessary to have the green chilies when there's already so much going on, next time I'll leave them for another dish. Thanks for sharing, this is a great way to enjoy grits!

This is a really good recipe.  I did cut it down to 4 servings and I turned the broiler on for the last 3 minutes.  I served this with barbecue chicken thighs and collard greens.  Delicious!
