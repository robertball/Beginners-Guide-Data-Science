This was incredibly easy to make.  The only time delay is waiting for the marinade to do it's stuff.

This would be an excellent munchie during football season!

We made a few changes because we wanted peel and eat shrimp. I followed the recipe for the marinade (step 1) but instead of putting the shrimp on skewers, I put the liquid from the bowl in a wok and boiled it and then added the shrimp and cooked them until they turned pink. Then I tossed them in a sauce made of butter and cajun seasoning. They were great!

I thought these were good but they just didn't marinate as well as i thought they would.  But maybe that's just shrimp period...anyways it was good.

This was a really great marinade for shrimp.  The only thing I changed was to add a lot more hot sauce because my husband likes really spicy food!  Other than that, it's a great recipe!

We love this!  Others were right when they said it needed more hot sauce.  I use 2 T of Red Hot.  It's perfect!  I also use the shrimp that is already cooked and frozen, but thaw before marinating.  Works great on the grill for the same amount of time.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

The flavor was good, the shrimp were a little rubbery which may have been my error , maybe too much beer. I might try this again with some modifications.

Thought this was great! Just a few changes-added a lot more hot sauce (Siracha) and grilled instead of broiled. Goes great with a salad and some soup for a light dinner! Yum!

Excellent! Any beer works for this but its especially good with Abita Amber, and you cant put too much garlic in the marinade.
