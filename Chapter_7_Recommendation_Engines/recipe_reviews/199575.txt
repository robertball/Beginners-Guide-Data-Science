Great seasonings in this recipe. I rated 4 stars because I made some changes - we boiled the potato wedges for 7 minutes before seasoning them and putting them in the oven for about 15 minutes. This makes for a great texture. It's mashed potatoey goodness inside, with a crispy outside. You cannot ask for anything more...great texture and less bake time with the par-boil technique.

Pretty tasty. I used sea salt. I did cook them for a little longer, only because we like them a little crispier. I served these with my Zesty Ranch Dip. No leftovers. Next time, I'll double the recipe.

absolutely delish! i must have cut some pretty thick wedges because they took about 50 minutes to be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, but the proportion of spices and cheese is perfect! strange how such simple ingredients create something so flavorful, but we really enjoyed this! thank you

I've been making a similar version of these for years. Quick, easy, delicious. A couple of quick extra steps makes them even better. After cutting into wedges, blot excess moisture off with paper towels. This helps to more evenly coat potato wedges with oil and seasoning. Also, stand wedges on the skin side in the pan. You won't have to turn them,and they will cook more evenly. Unless you forget they're in the oven, this recipe is almost impossible to ruin!

Loved the technique and the texture of the potatoes, so 3 stars. However, the garlic powder and onion powder ruins the taste for us. Those two ingredients appear in so many commercial products, which is why I believe people don't mind them, or actually develop a taste for them. I was raised a second-generation Italian, and we never even had ersatz ingredients like those in the house. When we wanted garlic or onion flavor, we used garlic or onions. As a consequence, I can't stomach the flavor of artificial stuff. Instead, rubbing the cut potatoes with a cut clove of garlic and a cut onion will give a far superior flavor. That said, it's brilliant to combine the oil, Parmesan, salt, pepper and any other spices you like in a bag and shaking the potatoes is a very neat, no-fuss way to dress them before roasting. We eliminated the garlic and onion powders, replacing them with finely chopped rosemary and basil from the garden. Boo-ya!!! Great flavor that will complement any roasted meat or poultry.

I just mixed it all up on the cookie sheet - no need to use a plastic bag.  Ohhh, make sure to spray the cookie sheet with Pam or something so they don't stick!  Great recipe, very good very easy!

WOW!! These were by far the BEST potato wedges I've made!! I've tried several different recipes and never been thrilled, but this one was fantastic! I used about 8-10 petite red potatoes and cut them up into small thin pieces. I baked them on a foil lined baking sheet for 10 minutes, stirred them around and baked them for another 12. DELICIOUS!!!

These are really good.   I took them out at 20 min,because they were going to get done before my chicken.  I put them back in the oven and finished them off the last 15min with my chicken after I flipped them. Just a little longer than called for, but I wanted some crisp.  Great wedges!

These are awesome. I always make a ton of these at a time. I cheat a little and after scrubbing and cutting them - I put the wedges in the microwave for 3-4 mins. When they come out I sprinkle them with cold water so the goodness will stick to wedges. I throw them in a huge pampered chef mixing bowl with a lid and just shake away. Then I put them on my pizza stone until they are crisp and golden brown. That way I never have to turn them. I'm lazy like that! Delish!

We loved these. My husband wanted pan-fried so we did both. To hubbies surprise everyone liked these more. Simple & good. Don't overload the pan & I did flip halfway.

Easy as can be and really good! I have to thank the reviewer that said to stand the wedges skin side down and sticking won't be an issue. OH MY! That is the best trick ever. They didn't stick at all, no flipping midway and they cooked evenly. Great recipe!

Nicely seasoned & crispy! It took a little more than 30 minutes for my fries to crisp up. I used all the spices and added a little red pepper. Nom Nom Nom!

These were a huge hit at the Sunday family dinner! I took claire03's advice and parboiled the potatoes and then baked in the oven till crisp. I didn't have any onion powder left, so I substituted dried oregano instead. I served this along with pork medallions topped with gorgonzola sauce and green beans. This was a crowd pleaser. Will definitely make again.

My suggestions are  to place the raw cut up potatoes in cold water for a few minutes to help remove excess starch. dry them off in an old t-towel. then do the rest like the recipe says. The other thing I do, is I use parchment paper on my cookie sheet, nothing sticks, and clean up is a breeze, you just toss the paper in the garbage!

The ingredients were pretty standard, so I knew I'd like the flavor.  It was the method that was different than other recipes, and I thought I'd give this a try simply because the point would be to eliminate having to wash a dish.  Once the olive oil was added to the cheese, however, it was nothing more than a paste that made it difficult to evenly coat the potatoes.  A little extra olive oil helped;  still,  a fair amount of the mixture clung to the bag and, given the price of good extra virgin olive oil and Parmigiano Reggiano,  you don't want to waste a bit of this.  It would have been far easier to lightly coat the potatoes with the olive oil, then toss with the combined remaining ingredients.  The result was ok, but nothing extraordinary, given the number of other similar recipes on this site for Parmesan Roasted Potatoes.  The method of preparation, which is what prompted me to make this particular recipe, unfortunately was a fail.

I love the seasoning in this recipe! Instead of baking in the oven that takes over an hour, I just pan-fried those wedges after I microwaved them for 3 min. They turned out perfect and crispy,and only took 10 min total!!! I make them very often~~~.

Fantastic! I cheated by microwaving the wedges first for 10 mins, made everything alot faster. Used four red potatoes. 

Add some shredded pepper jack cheese!

Very good!  I made sure to cut my 3 russets thin enough so they wouldn't take too long because I knew I'd be cooking something else at the same time and would have the oven at a lower temp.  Tossed potatoes in a bowl to coat with oil first, then the rest of the ingredients.  Lined a baking sheet with foil, quick spray with Pam, then scattered the wedges in a single layer.  Oven at 375, turned them over about 20 mins into the bake time, let them go another 15 minutes and then kicked the temp up to 450 for the last 5 mins.  Came out perfectly, nicely browned.  We were worried that the flavor would be too strong based on how they smelled as they were baking, but these were actually really tasty.  Much better than I expected, BF agreed.  My son isn't a roasted potato fan, and even he liked them.

I love this recipe! I made a few changes; I used a tad bit more Parmesan than was called for, and vegetable oil instead of olive. I used a 9x13 inch baking sheet at 350 degrees for 30 minutes, and then upped the temperature to 425 degrees for 15 minutes. They turned out crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Delicious!

We all really enjoyed these, including Jack who hates parmesan.  I used small russets cut in quarters and tossed everything in a pan (w/sides)to avoid the bag thing (lined with parchment for easy clean up). Added dried dill & other herbs I like as well.  Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this recipe and so did the fam!  My twist on this was that I didn't realize til I started to put everything in the bag that I didn't have grated parm, just shredded parm...oh my soul, it was soooo good with the shredded parm because it created this crunchy crust on them that was so yummy!!  I'll make these again but will omit the salt.

I was surprised by these. They had much more flavor then what would be considered a baked french fry. I had 2 really large potatoes. I cut them in 12ths instead of 8ths because they were so large. After I cut them it looked like quite a lot, so I doubled the rest of the ingredients, except for the pepper which I just added a couple of sprinkles. The bag method was so easy and so was the cutting as they did not need to be peeled for the recipe. I baked them on a sheet lined with parchment and with the size of my potatoes they filled the sheet. It took 35 minutes for my potato wedges to be done, just in time for the rest of the meal that was finished.

This recipe not only works with potatoes but with other vegies as well. Have also tried this with broccoli and asparagus. Yum! I did add more evoo than stated, skipped the salt as the parm had enough on it's own and with the potatoes I sprinkled in a bit of paprika. So good and thanks Heather!

Super delicious! For the two of us, I used one large russet potato. I soaked the wedges in ice water for thirty minutes as suggested by another cook. I kept all of the seasonings and oil at the same amounts and baked for forty mins. Perfect!

We make our own fries whenever you grill hamburgers. My old stand-by is onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper, and parmesan cheese on our baking potato version of fries.

These are very tasty potatoes!  My family likes them crispy, so I bake them for 40 minutes. Remember to spray the pan beforehand because they really like to stick.

Used 2 Russet potaotes, one peeled and cut and one with skin on. Put them in the mic for a few min then tossed with everything- no bag- and placed on a olive oiled cookie sheet. Roasted for 25 min. Was ok.

Tried this and was very happy with the results. The only changes I made were to put the oil on the potatoes  before shaking them in the seasoning - I also cooked them a little longer to make them a bit more crispy. I was worried that the garlic, onion and cheese would  be too strong, but there was no problem what so ever. My husband, who has always made our oven fried potatoes, now says I am in charge of cooking them. Wish I'd taken a photo - they were beautifully golden and crispy.

These oven fries are delicious and so easy to make!  The seasonings are perfectly portioned! My best advice would be to cut the potatoes as evenly as possible to prevent uneven cooking and be sure to experiment with your favorite spices/herbs/seasoning blends! Enjoy!

We liked these better than deep fried.  These would be good with either melted cheese drizzled on, or gravy.

I will admit - I did not measure the seasonings.  I just gave each several good shakes in the bag.  These came out great and were super easy.  Will definitely make again.

I have had this recipe saved for awhile and finally got around to making them and now wish I hadn't waited so long!  I tripled the recipe for 5 of us.  Didn't use a bag, just mixed everything in a large bowl.  Everyone loved them...Very flavorful and crispy without frying!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Very good for oven baked fries. I didn't realize that I was using chili powder instead of onion powder until the second time I made these! Mine were done after 30 minutes, but weren't crispy yet. They don't taste exactly like fries, but a nice alternative!

These oven fries made a great side dish for our panini sandwiches. They only took a few minutes to prepare and they baked while I got the sandwiches ready. My husband and kids loved them. I will definitely make them again.

These were pretty good but think they could use a tad more salt or something. Maybe seasoning salt. Will make again though.

I was disappointed with these. The seasonings burned by the time the potatoes finished cooking. Might have turned out better if the potatoes were deep fried for a few minutes then transferrred to a baking sheet and topped with seasonings and baked for a bit. I will try making these again.

I have made these a few times now with potatoes from my garden. Each time I've gotten rave reviews and there are never any leftovers. Yum! Yum! I should also mention that I cooked the potatoes for 40 minutes instead of 25, they just didn't seem quite ready at 25. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.

These were 5 star approved by my whole family!  Great seasonings and easy to make.  We had them with roasted chicken but they would go good with pretty much anything.  Make them in place of baked potatoes, etc.  These are now one of our new favorites!

My family loved these!  First, I did boil the wedges for about 7 minutes.  I lined my cookie sheet with foil and brushed it with olive oil.  I had no problems with the wedges sticking.  I sprinkled some Tastefully Simple all season salt over them and put them in the oven.  I flipped them over half way through the baking time.  Will be making these again!!

First time making wedges.  This was pretty good, not as good as what I've had in some restaurants, but good and easy enough to make again.  Make sure you spray the foil well so it does not stick.

These were SO good. I used gold potatoes (because that is what I had on hand). In order to get them crispy, boiled them for about 5-6 minutes, then tossed them in olive oil before seasoning them. I baked them about 10 minutes, tossed them around in the pan and then continued to bake until they looked nice and crispy. They turned out delicious - definitely a must try recipe!

I made these tonight to pair w/grilled burgers and they were a HIT!  The only tweak I made was to use white potatoes (what I had) and, of course, eliminated the black pepper (gross!).  I wasn't expected to be blown away by these, as I'm not a fan of potato wedges in general, but they ROCKED!  These will be a staple side in the LTH house (esp since they're ready in around 30 minutes!)! THANK YOU, Heather Sweet!

These were pretty good, used the suggestion of another reviewer, and boiled the potatoes for 7 minutes and cooked for 15 and it worked well.  Also, used both Parmesan and Romano cheeses.  Will make  again.

Fantastic!  Two small changes: (1) I only used 1 T. parmesan cheese as that was all I had, and (2) I baked these for 30 minutes.  Potato wedge perfection.

The best fries I've ever had.  The Parmesan really makes this dish.  I par-boiled the wedges as another reviewer suggested, then baked for 15 mins.  Perfect.  I did have to put oil on my wedges to make the seasoning stick better.  The amount of potatoes and seasoning was perfect....I rubbed the potatoes pretty thick in the seasoning and had run out at the last wedge.  I served this with Buffalo Chicken Fingers on allrecipes.

loved this recipe the amount of olive oil is perfect. it took way longer to cook though i think they were in there at an hour and i did microwave them 3 minutes before hand. the only good thing about them being in the oven that long was that they were crunchy as well was pretty awesome  a good dip to go with it is 1/4 cup mayo mixed with maybe a teaspoon of soy sauce i usually eyeball it add more soy or less to your liking.

The temp was too high on these - mine burnt and stuck to the bottom of the tray despite being coated in oil. I'd say 400 or even 375 is a better cooking temp. Delicious though.

The cook time was way off, and these were not crispy like I expected, even though I cooked them for over 45min. Seasoning was great, but the texture was not.

Outstanding! The best oven baked potato wedge recipe I've tried. I followed the directions exactly and we loved them. I did make sure to spray the foil with Pam. Otherwise, there would have been major sticking going on. 25 min was perfect, as well!

My daughter, a very beginner cook, took over making these when illness and work prevented the two regular family chefs from doing their jobs.  She misunderstood a direction to cover the pan with foil as cover the potatoes with foil while they were baking.  Mistake was discovered the last five minutes or so - but they still came out very good, possibly better for having been slightly steamed before they were crisped.

I made a big batch of these fries, half exactly as the recipe is printed and the other half I added cumin, paprika and seasoning salt. I liked them the way the recipes calls for but I felt they were a little bland. I really liked them with the extra seasoning.

These are easy to make, but the flavour is nothing spectacular. The Parmesan did not come through at all. I'd rather use my own seasoning blend. I must admit that the temperature and length of cooking time achieves an excellent balance between the crisp outside and soft inside. Probably won't make this recipe again, but will keep the cooking method in mind for my own seasoned fries.

This turned out great for me and I was very impressed. The only thing I did differently was to spray the cookie sheet with non-stick spray. I served them with a creamy bacon dipping sauce and they were better than any potato wedge appetizer I've ever had in any restaurant. This one is a keeper!

Great seasonings, but the cooking technique needs a tiny bit of tweaking: either par-boil the potato wedges for 7 mins as another reviewer suggested, or cook for a good bit longer - like 45 minutes - really, until brown and toasty bits appear.  Second, definitely use Pam or other spray on the baking sheet first.   But great recipe!  Thanks.

These were incredible!  Didn't have onion powder so I used Montreal Steak Seasoning.  I did read follow others advice and turned them over half way through and they turned out perfect! My whole family loved them including my 1 and 4 year old.  We will definitely be making these again and again.

Love these potatoes.  I followed the recipe, except I used a little more olive oil and I sprinkled the wedges with parmesan instead of adding it to the bag. I added Vidalia onion wedges and whole cloves of garlic.  I just threw them in the baggie after the potatoes. The onions were almost as good as the potatoes.

I made this, delicious! I improved my cooking experience by also shaking (4) chicken thighs in the coating and baking them along side the potatoes on parchment paper on a cooky sheet. Put the thighs in first as they need and extra 10-15 minutes,  while you are prepping the potatoes. (Why waste the oven heat, eh?).  A couple of ears of corn, steamed in husk in the microwave, (3-4 minutes) shucked as soon as they were touchable.  MMMM mmm, what a great meal with little clean up.

I love these, so much better than frozen and so easy to prepare.  It is really worth the effort to make these yourself, instead of buying a frozen bag of fries, that taste like cardboard.

Made this several times. They're awesome! After I slice my wedges I soak them in hot water for 10 minutes then drain & pat dry before seasoning. They cook up crisp on the outside & fluffy inside.

Easy to make and a nice side dish for fried chicken or fish.  I didn't mix the olive oil into the dry rub because it would have been lumpy and wouldn't have coated the wedges..  Instead I dipped each potato wedge into the oil in a separate bowl, then shook the oiled wedges a few at a time in the dry rub.  Bake at 450° F for 20 minutes.  To cook at the same time as your protein, bake at 325° for about an hour.

These were awesome! I used 3 medium potatoes so I added a little more salt. The wedges were about 1/2" thick and baked perfectly. I did turn them once halfway through. Should've made more:D

I make this recipe exactly as written. Delicious and easy. When I take it to BBQ's and potlucks, everyone asks me for the recipe and they are surprised by how simple it is. I love it because I usually have all the ingredients on hand, it makes my house smell amazing, and even young children love it! My very picky nephew requests I make this for him every time we get together. He calls them "heavenly potatoes". Great recipe! One of my favorites on this website!

No russets on hand so used yellow.  Doubled the parmesan, added 3 minced garlic cloves and some red pepper flakes.  Used a silpat liner so easy clean up.  We ate them all!  Will definitely try with the russet potatoes.

This was AWESOME.  Followed the recipe exactly with only few changes;  used non-stick foil & baked it for 50 min. since we like our fries crispy.  Next time I will raise the oven temp. to 450 and bake it for 40 min.  No more frozen steak fries in our household!

Really delicious.  I cut potatoes into fry size slices then followed ingredients exactly as written, tossed in bag.  Spread in single layer on a cookie sheet that was covered with foil and sprayed with cooking spray.  Baked at 425 for 20 minutes, then flipped with a spatula and baked 15 minutes more. Crunchy on the outside, really nice on the inside.

Delicious! I baked them a bit longer than recommended and even put the broiler on for a couple of minutes because my husband likes them extra crispy.

Very good but 25 minutes was not enough time for crispiness.  Will use this recipe again but cook longer.

Wow...loved it!!!! I boiled the potatoes for 7 minutes as the reader suggested.  I also baked them at 375 for 30 minutes because I was cooking another dish.  Everything came out wonderful.  First of many times making these potatoes.  Will try sweet potatoes next. Thanks all!!!

AMAZINGGG....I also added some italian seasoning and cayenne pepper. The first time I made it, it took so long for the potatoes to cook through that the fires browned too much. So, the second time, I parboiled them in the microwave for a few minutes. That way, they cooked in the over and were the perfect golden brown.

So good! I did make a few changes for our tastes, but I'm sure that if I were to make this as written, it would have been good too. First, I parboiled the cut potatoes for 6 minutes and then added some turmeric and cayenne to the spice mix. I baked them for 28 minutes, but they weren't quite crispy enough. Next time, I will try 35 minutes and see how they are.

I made these to go with roast beef and Cheddar sandwiches for dinner tonight.  The seasoning was very tasty, but the bag-shaking method didn't work out too well for me.  I ended up coating the wedges with more oil and pressed the seasoning mix on each edge.  I took others' advice and par-boiled the potatoes for about 6 minutes.  I let them cool a bit before proceeding.  Flipping halfway through, they took about 14 minutes to get nice and golden.  All in all, a very tasty side.

I enjoyed this recipe very much.  I did do mine different.  I boiled the cut wedges for 7 minutes, drained on paper towel and put in fridge for about 30 minutes before mixing them into oil and herbs.  I sprayed my cookie sheet with pan and dusted the wedges with salt.  I cooked them at 400 for 30 minutes and turned them after 15.  This allowed both sides to be crispy.  Thank you again for this great recipe.

These were awesome! After they were baked I turned them into bacon cheese fries by adding a shredded mexican blend of cheese and real bacon crumbles.....they were so flavorful. They were great and flavorful just as the recipe indicated also. These were the best tasting, most successful steak fries/ potato wedges that I have ever made....and I have tried a LOT of recipes like this!

Very flavorful and delicious! They cooked up good.  I gave it 4 stars because of how the olive oil was added in the beguining. Next time I make them, I am going to toss the potatoes in olive oil first before shaking them up in the seasonings. When I added the oil to the seasonings, it made it clumpy and didn't stick to the potato wedges. I had to use my hands to stick the seasonings to the outside by pressing it on. Other than that they are real good and seasoned perfectly. Thanks for sharing.

LOVE this recipe, but I have a few additional steps. First, soak the wedges in cold water for about 30mins right after you slice them. I also add about 1/3cup of balsamic vinegar to the seasoning mix. Finally, I bake them for 35mins, rather than 25mins. Try my additions and I promise you'll love them too.

Good seasoning, but took a lot longer to cook. I cut small, French fry size strips and some were still crunchy at 35 minutes.

I'm rating these after making them 3 times. The whole family loves them! And guests have been "wow'ed" too! I do cover my cookie sheet w/ foil and oil it (when I've used cooking spray, the potatoes stick anyway). I cook a little longer than the specified time. My son dislikes any fries outside a restaurant, but he LOVES these!

Was looking for a quick dish to have as a side to hot dogs for an easy, fast dinner when I came accross this recipe I had saved.  These were so fast coming together and really tasted good!  Made them exactly as the recipe called - wouldn't change a thing and these will become a staple in my house!

Awsome!! I cut my wedges smaller, probably 12 per potato.  Covered cookie sheet with foil and sprayed it with pam.  Cooked about 30 min and turned halfway.  They were really crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and had tons of flavour.  My whole family loved them.  Quick and easy!!

These potato wedges were pretty good. I had never made them before with Parmesan cheese or onion powder, and was pleasantly surprised. The Parmesan gave it a little bit of a crunch (and I just now realized that I was supposed to use grated instead of shredded...oops!) and a great flavor that we really liked. Very easy and cheap to make for a side dish or a snack. I think next time I will double the spices and oil just to make sure all of the wedges get coated because parts of them didn't have a lot of flavor. Thanks for the great recipe, Heather!

Delicious Potato Wedges. My wife made me bake a second batch, after already having done a double batch. 
Didn't use the salt, just because we limit our salt intake.

Just delicious!  Used soy Parmesan cheese, fresh garlic.  I doubled the salt and used kosher. I also added some fresh parsley for color. I placed the potatoes on my silpat and they browned to perfection.  I have made this twice now and used reds as well as russets.  Both were delicious.  You can forget ever making french fries out of a bag again with this recipe!  This is quick and delicious!

Made this and didn't even use the 1/4 tsp of salt. It was too salty for us. I don't use salt for health reasons to do with my husband, but he couldn't eat it. I imagine the amount of cheese was the cause of the extra salty flavor. Next time, if I make it again, I would use half of the cheese and still no salt. I did use red potatoes and scallions, because that's what I had. They took almost 1 hour, so the timing may have been different with russet potatoes.

Loved these!  I used garlic salt instead of powder, so reduced it to 1/2 tsp. and omitted the regular salt so it wouldn't be too salty.  I used red potatoes because that's what I usually buy.  Maybe if the russets are large, 2 potatoes will make 4 servings, but I used 4 medium-sized red potatoes for 3 of us.  Will definitely make these again!

bought 2 large russet potatoes since its only for two people. scrubbed potatoes under water and cut into wedges. seasoning perfect and baking time was approximate. Flip wedges halfway during the baking process. I served this with ranch dressing from this site. delish!

I am giving these a five star rating even though there was a user malfuction in preperation. I tried to parboil them and lost track of time. Because of that, my potatoes were mush. This was my fault not the recipes. The seasoning was delicious. I will definately make these again following the directions instead of improvising when in a rush.

These are terrific!  So quick and easy to prepare.  They smell wonderful while cooking and then they don't dissapoint you when they are done!  Just yummy.  I sliced potatoes thin for crispy flavourful results and less carbs on each plate.
Will definitely make again.  The parmesean cheese is the key!

These are really yummy and make a nice crispy coating on the outside of the potatoes. I used red potatoes because they are my favorite. I just quartered them and then followed the rest of the directions. They were very yummy and my family ate them up fast!

Very nice, easy recipe for baked instead of fried fries.  Obviously, I made fries instead of wedges, and they turned out great!  Cooked for 30 minutes.  Coat baking pan with spray so that you can easily flip the fries in the process.

These were awesome!!!!!
Turned out perfectly on the first try and they were so delicious! I used 4 potatoes but kept the seasoning amounts the same. The only problem I noticed is that the wedges stick to the cookie sheet something fierce!...and that I couldn't stop eating them all! Definitely try this recipe. It's super easy too!

I really liked these as a healthier alternative. I had to cook them a lot longer than the recipe said to in order to attain to the desired "crunchiness" but the flavor was awesome!

Delicious! Next time I will peel the russets - just our preference. The flavor was perfect! I had a bit of olive oil on the foil-lined tray. Next time, I'll generously oil it as the spuds stuck just a bit. We enjoyed the parm on these.  Thanks for this new family favorite!

This recipe was everything I was looking for: a fast easy side to take to work for our office lunch, something to go with BBQ, perfect!! The fact that it was delicious and I brought home an empty dish was a plus, considering it was my first time making it. I didn't have any onion powder so I used minced dried onion, it was great. My husband tried to convince me not to take them to work, (wonder why), so tomorrow I will make him a batch, poor fellow! Everyone at the office wanted a copy of this recipe, so I directed them to All Recipes.com, share the love!

These potatoes were very good.  Something different - easy, crunchy and very tasty.  After reading the reviews, I cut my wedges a little thinner and they were done in 30 minutes.  Yum.

These were great! I had to adjust a few things due to the altitude but they turned out wonderful. I also found it easier to just dice the potato and make little O's which makes them cook faster and (in my opinion) easier to cut! Love the recipe and all the ingerdients.

Everyone loved them! I used foil to cover the pan, but definitely need to still use olive oil spray to keep the fries from sticking to the foil. The potatoes I had were really large, so I cut them in eighths lengthwise and then also in half again. They were done in 20-25 minutes.

These were very good! I added a little bit of seasoning salt to them, and put them in the oven for 15 minutes, flipped them, and cooked for 15 minutes longer! My husband is a very picky eater and he loves these! Even re-warmed up!

Terrific blend of seasonings...lots of flavor!  I tripled the recipe except for the salt which I doubled.  This needed to cook about 40 minutes for me at high altitude.

I was looking for a different kind of potato to have with our chicken fingers other than the regular french fries or tater tots. I ran across this recipe and decided to try it.  It turn out great and went well with the chicken fingers, cole slaw and garlic bread that we had.  Thanks for sharing this recipe...it was wonderful!

Loved this so much, I made it again the next day! 1st time for wedges, 2nd for smaller roasted potatoes to serve with a roast. I added some basil and a little red pepper to the seasoning mix and it was delicious! Goes great with Apple Butter Pork Loin from this site.

These are great!  I love roasted potatoes, and the addition of parmesan cheese makes me love them even more.  I didn't change much with this recipe.  I assumed the 2 potatoes are supposed to be large ones, so I used 4 small potatoes instead.  I kept the skin on and added a little more salt.  I would suggest spraying the pan with cooking spray so they don't stick and to stir them at least once during baking.  They were perfectly cooked and browned after 25 minutes.  Thanks for this recipe!

Oh my gosh. These were so good. The only thing is I completely forgot to add the olive oil so they would have been a little softer but it still was great - I also used plain old Idaho potatoes cut into bite-size pieces... done in 25 minutes, no problem! Thanks!

I didn't really follow the recipe, except for the cook time and some of the spices. I used onion powder, garlic powder, white pepper, red pepper, seasoned salt and Cajun seasoning, and left out the cheese. They were perfect. I made some last night, and I'm making more right now.

We liked these - I doubled the recipe and used 7 potatoes (they were on the small side) and added red pepper flakes. They baked for almost an hour, and had a great consistency. Thanks!

This was really good, but I made modifications. I par-boiled the potato wedges for 7 minutes. Drained in a colander then mixed with the spices. I added 1/2 tsp of salt instead of 1/4 tsp. I put the potatoes on parchment paper on the cookie sheet. I had to bake the potatoes for 35 minutes but they got crispy on the outside and were tender on the inside.  Really good and will definitely make again.

Not very flavorful - almost burnt topping by the time the potatoes were done.

These were so good! I made just like the recipe said. My potatoes weren't very big and I cut them in 8 wedges so the wedges were on the small side. After 25 minutes I turned them over and baked about another 5 minutes. They were crispy on the outside and very tasty. Will make again.

These were good. I didn't have Parmesan cheese so I omitted cheese. I cut my a little thinner and they still took 50 mins before they got crisp.

These were pretty good, the only thing I didn't like was the cheese ended up crunchy but that's just a personal preference.  Next time I'll make more of the spice mixture because to me it just didn't seem like enough.

These were terrific! I used regular canola oil instead of olive oil because I needed a more neutral tasting side dish. Also, because I like simplicity, I just threw all of the ingredients onto the sheet pan and tossed them together with my hands. Worked out just beautifully. The recipe is only missing the reminder to flip the potatoes halfway through cooking time so that both sides can get browned.

This was great. I added just a touch of "Magic Dust" spice.  This is a spice you make from several different spices. You get the recipe on line. There was enough for left overs and they were just as good the second time around.

These are awesome. I scaled the recipe for 9 servings but used more potatoes than it called for(4.5 called for but I used 10). Still tasted good, in other words didn't need to add add'l seasoning. They were gobbled up - none left. Thanks!

These are so great!! Make make just a couple changes, though. I added a 1/4 tsp of paprika for just a slight kick. Aside from that, I switched the oven to broil for the last 8 (about) minutes until they were a little more crispy and brown. Simply wonder and super easy! I will be making this over and over again!

I doubled the recipe, because POTATO WEDGES.  Here's what I did different, though.  I buttered 4 potatoes, then cooked them for 10 minutes.  I let them cool, then buttered them again.  The only reason I did this was because I really like crispy skins to begin with, but then I kind of ruin that by mixing the dry ingredients with 1 cup of flour, dipping the sliced potatoes in an egg mixture (2 eggs, 1/4 cup water), then dredging them in the dry mix.  Followed the recipe after that, and I'll be doing it like that until I die of potato poisoning, if there is such a thing.

I followed the directions, with the ex exception of boiling the potato wedges before seasoning like someone mentioned before. I only boiled them for 5 min instead of 7, and baked for 15 min. BEST WEDGES EVER

I doubled the recipe. I used steak seasoning instead of salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder since it contains similar seasonings and is already mixed. Bake for 30 minutes.
These were easy, quick, and delicious. I will definitely make them again.

Very good.  I baked them on a parchment lined baking sheet, and the few that slipped onto the bare sheet definitely stuck to the sheet.  Use parchment for easy clean up.  Delicious, easy oven-fried potatoes.

This was pretty tasty, and I would make it again.  The recipe doesn't get 5 stars, though, because of a couple little things.  First, it was such a thick paste that I had trouble getting it to stick to the potatoes until I added quite a bit more olive oil.  Also, large potatoes may not cook in 25 minutes if they're cut into eighths.  I cut mine into fries that were pretty similar in size, and the cook time was just right.  I did turn them halfway through so they would have 2 crispy sides.  I do plan to make this again!

I like the potatoes. I cut the potatoes into 1/8ths so it was more like wedge cut fries so they were crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside. I had a little problem getting the coating  evenly on the wedges in the bag.   Next time I plan toss the wedges in olive oil and mix dry ingredients in a shaker container.  This way the seasoning can be evenly distributed on the potatoes.

I made small potatoes instead of wedges. I like salty, so I think they need more salt but that could always be added individually! I think they are delicious! We will see what the family says tonight!

This is the most successful potato wedge recipe I’ve tried. Definitely roast on parchment paper! I think next time I’ll try it with season salt and see how that turns out.

This recipe did go well with hamburger and hot dogs. The prep was fast and easy.  The oven time is correct. The potato pieces that were thinner developed a crunchy crush. The thicker ones were just as tasty, but soft. Everyone loved the flavor, but not the texture of the soft ones. Some said they preferred more and hotter spices on fries. So I gave it a 4.  When I make this again, I'll cut all potatoes thinner. I will increase the amount of coating for more crunch

Slightly bland, but great texture. I would add some paprika next time for a slight kick. I took the advice of other reviewers and cut my wedges thinly, they still took an extra 10 minutes to cook. Still a good recipe, cheap to make....I'm now a big fan of the bag method, and the kids found it fun to help as well!

I made these in Wolfgang Puck pizza cooker and noticed they got brown at point-contact on the perforated pan.

Did differently: I used my olive oil mister to coat fries on both sides while on cutting board, omitting oil from bag, and then shook fries inside bag. Every bit of dusting mix was used up, and I placed everything on the perforated pan at 425°F, cooked 30', and then turned and cooked 30' more.h

This wasn't the flavor mix I have been searching for, and I think it could be much better. I ended up with fully-cooked oven fries a bit on the dry side, not crispy (nor should they be). Lacking was a bit on the tangy and starchy side. The starch or sugars in the fries maybe need a better edible reagent. Ive read elsewhere about soaking potato strips in sugar water prior to heat application, maybe something like this.

I was skeptical. Too simple. But it came out great. I made it exactly as the recipe called for. No changes. I made two batches and kept half in a little longer to see how that would be, and I like it better, so next time I’d bake maybe 10-15 minutes more. Get a bit more crisp. I’d add more cheese too. But overall it’s super easy to make - took 5 minutes. And everyone enjoyed them. And much less greasy than frying of course.

This recipe is absolutely awesome. I have made it several times. The seasoning is outstanding and the end result is a plate of crispy, low fat "fries" that compliment almost any meal. This is fast becoming our go-to potato side dish when we want something besides baked or mashed potatoes. 

For an added twist, I use my homemade flavored oil instead of plain olive oil. I have used basil. oregano, thyme or sage oils and all four have worked out very well!

Love these! We often do these as a side with wings or burgers. Simple and yummy. Mix and shake in a ziploc bag makes for even less cleanup! Add some Italian seasoning and get a fry like Smashburger:)

This is an excellent recipe that my whole family loves.  I've made this many times, both as written and with adding various herbs.  I find that adding herbs of provence gives a good flavor addition, and have also added chopped rosemary if serving the potato wedges as a side to chicken.
Also I've found this works with other types of potatoes and especially like using small potatoes that have been quartered.

I haven't made these yet, but Cheesecakemama is probably on to something.  She took the potatoes out of the oven after 20 minutes, (they rested for a while). Then she put them back in for 15 minutes to finish.  That might be a good suggestion!

Very tasty! I was looking for a recipe that would make crispy wedges even when baked. I used two tips from  other reviewers: microwave for 3 minutes, stand up the wedges skin side down.  These were very delicious and super easy.

These are DELICIOUS! Super easy to make. I cooked for a bit longer just because I like my fries a bit crispy. Next time I may also add a pinch more seasoning for personal preference.

my family loved it! I had an issue with trying to save some for my mother who wasn't home from her workout yet! they devoured them ! I will definitely be making those again! I used six gold potatoes instead of two russet potatoes. I also sprinkled a little bit of dried rubbed sage on top. not much, but a pinch on each plate.

My family loves these and have been making something similar for years. I mixed as stated but left the Parmesan cheese out of the mixture until in the pan and then sprinkled over potatoes before baking. This can be a great addition to any meal and everyone enjoys them.

This is my go to wedge recipe, with a few changes. I don't use a plastic bag. I don't mix the oil with the seasonings.
I place the wedges in a large bowl, and put in the oil. Toss wedges to coat. Mix cheese and seasoning in a bowl, sprinkle half on wedges, toss, sprinkle the rest, toss again. 
This slight technique change and this turned into the easiest, never fail recipe!
You can definitely change up seasoning, as well. Paprika is a nice addition for color. A little red pepper if you like spice. Italian seasoning, etc

Excellent. I didn't have onion powder, I used 3 russets, I didn't measure any of the ingredients, and I cooked at 350 degrees for an hour. As another reviewer suggested, I blotted the excess moisture off the wedges before adding them to the marinade.

I made it exactly as stated but used foil to bake them on. I baked them a little longer because we too like them a bit more crispy. The flavor was SPOT on and flavorful! I served them with sour cream and fresh chives on the side. Perfection with my delicious Crock Pot Ribs and Broccoli. 
thank you so much Heather...great recipe!

Great recipe! I wanted to try a new (and easy) side dish, and this was perfect! I used more potatoes, so I increased the amounts of seasoning used. I also substituted lemon pepper and seasoned salt for the regular salt and pepper, and added a couple of dashes of chili powder for a little kick. My fiance loved it, and so did I! I will definitely be making this again!

With a few tweaks, this is a 5 star recipe. Got rave reviews. I used Yukon gold potatoes. I microwaved them for 3-4 min as someone else suggested so they were soft on the inside and crispy on out. Then I seasoned them as recipe said. I let them sit in the bag for a little bit as I was cooking other things for the dinner party. I did as others said and cut them into quarters and did skins down. They didn't stick! So smart and so perfect.

Yummy taters! Followed directions exactly except I didn't have russet potatoes so I used 4 smaller taters. They turned out great- crispy on outside and soft on inside. The husband thought they were a little bland, but my kids (ages 4 and 2) liked them as I did too. Will make them again.

Great taste!  I added parsley flakes and some dill, and some chili flakes for a little more spice. Make sure you use a rimmed baking sheet because if you have a little too much oil it'll drip off the side.

This was so delicious! I made the mistake of making them early in the day, when no one was home and ended up eating 1/4 of them! I just couldn't stop! The only thing I changed was the amount of potatoes to three instead of two and cut them into sixteenths instead of eights. The only reason I did that was because it made it seem like there were more potatoes. Anyways, my family and I absolutely loved this recipe and if you are in hurry to make a side dish, this should be your go to, as it is mine now!

Made this as listed. I did stand the wedges on end to help with sticking. Great tip. I baked these in a toaster oven on a round baking stone. Same great results.

Easy-peasy. Despite what the food snobs say, the onion and garlic powder was not detrimental to the taste. However I will try to use a real onion and garlic just for comparison. Of course, doing that will remove the peasy part of easy.

I used the seasonings suggested, and found the garlic aroma overwhelming for our comfort, but it is definitely worth trying again modifying the recipes.  As I did not turn the wedges half way through the cooking period, one side was over-well done. Also, I do highly recommend wrinkled aluminum foil lining the sheet to avoid sticking and to aid in clean up. And it 100% beats the reconstituted packaged frozen potatoes I have been using.

Perfect potato side.  I changed some of the herbs and spices and used white potatoes.  Large stoneware does great job without burning.

WOW! I was amazed at how delicious and easy this recipe is. I was already baking fish sticks (don't laugh) and the oven was already at 425 and both baked for the same amount of time. This is a simple & good for your tummy recipe that I will be repeating. Easy on the wallet too!

Fantastic recipe. I gave away my deep fryer after finding this! I soak my cut potatoes in ice water for an hour before cooking and they turned out nice and crispy. Best part of this recipe is I've changed up the seasoning all 6 times I've made them with perfect results every time. Everybody gobbles them up. My personal favorite is a nice Cajun seasoning.

next time i will put foil down so the potatoes don't stick to the baking sheet. i will also microwave the potatoes beforehand as someone suggested, just to cut back on the  baking time. i basically coated the potatoes with the seasonings and oil. these tasted good.

These are definitely quick and pretty tasty.  I didn't use onion powder or salt, instead I added a dash of paprika and left them in the oven for a few minutes after the time had expired.

I used white potatoes instead of russet because that is all i had.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter.  It turned out better than my ActiveFry.  Would definitely do again.  Thanks!

Even better with 2 cloves of fresh garlic. I par-boilee the cubed potatoes in water for about 5 minutes before seasoning them and popping in the oven. Yummy!

I actually made this recipe twice.  We enjoyed this recipe, and I will make these again. 
For my family, I needed to add more salt.  I changed the salt measurement to 1 teaspoon.

The wedges came out great and were a big hit. I had to watch them carefully with the high temp and using a convection oven. I used convection roast and decreased the temp to 350 the first 15 min.

Blended some fresh seasonings (onion, garlic, scallions) in addition and placed all ingredients in a bowl. Stirring got all the wedges well-coated. They were delicious! I cut the wedges so they could stand on the skin and saved me having to flip them halfway through.

Tastes was awesome!! I did leave out the Parmesan cheese, but the garlic and onion powder and black pepper made them taste great. My only complaint is that they took MUCH longer then 25 minutes to cook. I baked them for 50 minutes, and they still could have used more time to get nice a crisp on the outside. They may have been a bit overcrowded (though still single layered) which likely made them cook slower.

Great way to make potatoes. First, cut my potatoes into 12ths. (cut in 4ths, then cut each 4th into 3rds) They cooked well and were soft on the inside, but crispy on the outside. I used the non-stick aluminum foil on my cookie sheet.  Clean up was a breeze. I also increase the salt to 1 teaspoon. It might be too much for you, so play with it. I used a bag to oil my fries. I mixed the other ingredients in a bowl and then dumped in the seasonings, etc and shook the bag to cover the fries. Again less to clean up. Finally I cooked the fries about 5 minutes longer than then recipe says.

this is a really good recipe, but I would cut the potatoes thinner and flip them halfway over so the Parmesan doesn't burn. We will be making these again!

These turned out delicious! I did not use the exact Recipe I changed it up a bit as I usually do with all the Recipes I use. The only thing I did differently was instead of adding Salt Pepper and Garlic powder was I used Old Bay Seasoning. Which I think turned out a little better since it gave it just a little bit of spice to the fries.

Embarrassed to admit how often we have made these!  They are easy and seasoning is perfect as written.

Based on personal taste - I cut these in thin rounds (this also cut down on cooking time) and use a combo of yellow potatoes and sweet.  Delicious!  These reheat well and were a snap to make for a weeknight meal.

super tasty, the seasoning really makes it. I didn't have parmesian so I didn't put any on, but it was still delicious.

Really good as is however I forgot to spray the pan with non-stick cooking spray.Thought the olive oil would be enough but the cheese needs to be factored in so they did stick...my fault.

So simple and effective! I mixed in a bit of shredded Parm along with the grated and also added some Tony's (cuz, it's Tony's) and this turned out so great! This is always my go-to for a simple side potato dish that the whole family likes.

I love this recipe.  I use this as a base recipe then add cheddar and bacon bits. But I only use about 5-6 potatoes.  Doubling the spices helps plus a pinch more of garlic never hurts, right?  But I never measure either cheese (just until it looks right). 

Key is to use the boiler not just the oven... I mean if you want the crisp crunchy yummy outer texture of your wedge/french fries.

Used four small red potatoes, rinsed the cut wedges and patted them dry before seasoning. Placed them on the baking sheet skin down and they cooked perfectly.

I make this about every other week as a side to my roast or tenderloin! The only thing I do differently is use garlic salt, but that's more because my husband likes it better!

It's excellent although I did it a bit differently.  I par-cooked the potatoes in the microwave first and let them cool before I cut them into wedges.  I also used sea salt and spanish paprika along with the onion/garlic powder and pepper.  Par cooking cuts the cooking time down a bit and the wedges are easier to cut.

Really good! Judge your own baking time based on how crispy your family enjoys them. My kids enjoyed them just as much as they do fried potatoes and that says alot.

I also boiled them for about 10 minutes before baking them which definitely reduced the cooking time. I added some cayenne pepper for a bit of a kick as well. Fantastic recipe!

These are yummy and great.  I covered my baking sheet with foil and put the oil only on the pan and rolled my wedges in the oil.   I then put all the seasonings in a bag ( a little extra parmesan) and shook the wedges in the bag and placed back on the same baking sheet (with the leftover oil) . This method makes them crispier and each fry is evenly coated with seasoning.  Same ingredients different preparation.

These were very easy to make and were quite a hit with dinner.  Wish I had had onion powder on hand, because I bet that would have made them even better.  Definitely plan on reusing this idea in the future!  Like some other commenters mentioned, I did not use a plastic bag, but instead mixed everything up in a large bowl.

Pretty good.  Used 1/4 pepper and 1/4 seasoned salt.  Also 1/4 garlic powder.  Could have use 1/2 tsp seasoned salt or more.  Didn't use parm cheese.

This recipe is by far the best of all the ones I had tried!  The Parmesan cheese makes all the difference in the world. I have used russet potatoes and new (red) potatoes. We actually prefer the new potatoes because of their thinner skin. They were also softer on the inside than the russets.  I would suggest spraying the cookie sheet with a no-stick cooking spray first. This recipe is definitely worth 5 stars!

I followed others advice and skipped the bag step and just mixed it directly over the cookie sheet before baking. The potatoes where really yummy. I think the next time I might try flipping half way through the cooking time as one side was crispy well the other wasn't and the crispy side was much better. I also will add just a hint more salt after baking as my hunny felt it was still missing. I made as stated otherwise and used all the measurements above.

I added all the ingredients together unfortunately, and the oil mixed with the dry ingredients and turned into a big blob. I then did it again, but this time brushed the potatoes with the oil THEN dropped them one by one into the bag and placed them on the pan skin down. Turned out much better.  I like the idea of microwaving them first and will likely try that next time.  After the dry ingredients were empty I tried adding parmesan cheese, chilli powder, garlic and onion powder to the bag and finished the rest of the potatoes... they're all in the oven now so we'll see!  :)

REally surprised how good they were.  I left out the Parm, because we are cheesed out, but otherwise followed to a "t".  Easy, healthy, and really good.

Other than cutting down on the salt, I didn't change a thing.  I cooked on my stoneware pan and they were perfect.

I like everything about the recipe! HOWEVER, the olive oil is not enough to coat the cookie sheet so spreading them on parchment paper is a MUST. The first batch just stuck to the cookie sheet and I had a time getting them unstuck.  I am currently trying to "redeem" them by baking them just a wee bit longer on parchment paper.

Simple and nicely seasoned, they crisped up nicely.  I love efficent recipes like this.  Normally I use my hands to toss to coat oven fries but used a plastic bag this time and it worked great!

These potatoes tasted great.  The seasonings were perfect.  We had them with Italian sausage sandwiches that were cooked in marinara sauce in the crockpot.  My husband loved the potatoes dipped in the marinara sauce.  The other side dish was oven roasted broccoli and sweet peppers.  What a delicious and healthy dinner!

Tried this recipe recently. I probably didn't cook them long enough to get the crispy outside. Will try again. Good flavor, anyway.

Loved these! Even my kids who aren't potato lovers (weird, I know) gobbled them up!  Made them exactly like the recipe is written and baked them on stoneware.

I had never made potato wedges until now.  Normally, I would make, what my family calls, home fries (which are delicious).  Now, I have an alternative to those to serve to my children.  These potato wedges are incredible.  I loved them.  You don't get an overwhelming taste of the cheese, it's just right.  I like these better than store bought.  It has a restaurant quality about them.  I did leave them in the oven a little longer, total of 35 minutes.  My children ate them, and wanted to make more.  Lol.  They are great!!!!

The seasonings are terrific, although I'd go a little more on the salt. I tried this recipe minus the cheese, for fries rather than potato wedges, which took a shorter amount of time. It came out great and my brothers couldn't stop reaching for more.

Didn't have the ingredients for my regular oven-roasted potatoes (garlic and fresh rosemary), so I tried this one. It seemed like an awful lot of seasoning for only 2 russets. I doubled the potatoes, olive oil, and salt. Everything else I left the same. I also sprayed my pan with non-stick cooking spray (learned from past experience). My potatoes took a little longer to cook. I stirred them up after 20 minutes, then I just went by appearance. I'm guessing they took about another 10 minutes. Can't wait to try this on sweet potato wedges next!

This recipe is great!  I used to buy frozen 'tators' to serve as a side item with a relaxed meal.  I really appreciate using the fresh ingredients instead.  I know exactly what is in there and do not have to guess.  The taste is awesome and now they are our 'go to' for many lazy Friday night meals.  You have to try them for yourself!

Yummy! I boiled them for 7 mins first like claire03 suggested, and they came out just right! I forgot to set a timer, but I think I baked them for about 15-17 mins. Next time I'll cook a little longer, I love crispy fries/wedges!

The flavor was good, but I had a hard time getting the seasoning to stick to the potatoes. Next time, I'd instead coat each individual potato plank with olive oil and then sprinkle the seasoning on top.

I made this tonight.  It was good!  My husbnad became a pig.  Yes, before cooking, I read reviews, so I know there would be a cooking time issue.   I microwaved whole thing in a untied  plastic bag(from super market at meat or produce section's) for 3 min. after I cut and put everything in the bag.  Then I placed skin side down on the cookie sheet with the perchment paper.  Baked 20min. done! Thank you for the recipe and helpful reviews.

There are few new recipes I try in which my husband is amazed, but we both were so happy with how delicious this recipe came out. I did the recipe as is but added another 1/4 tsp salt because I like salty. It was perfect.

Could these be easier? NO!  Any my family LOVES them.  I did not use onion powder (only because don't have any) and they were still great.  I only mention that so you are not afraid to alter recipe when needed.

My favorite potato wedge seasoning recipe. Better than buying it as a mix in the store (find it tastes the same, if not better!).

These were perfect for what I was making (Chicken). The potatoes I used were large so I allowed longer cooking time. So easy to make too. Had to use tongs to get them out of the ziploc bag though. No big problem otherwise. I would even add some cayenne or chili powder to spice them up a bit. Good recipe!

10 stars! so easy, so tasty! I followed the recipe exact - I really thought that wouldn't be enough oil but it was just right - I'm sure I'll make these regularly!

love it!  Very good "Base Recipe"  We change the seasonings as needed.  My husband loves McCormick Cajun Seasoning for Cajun wedges :)

I made these exactly like the recipe the first time and they were great! 
The second time i doubled the recipe and cut the potatoes into small cubes and put them in a casserole dish. they needed to cook for quite a bit longer, about 50 mins and needed turning a couple times. I added shredded marble cheese at the end just unitl it melted and they were awesome!

These were a big hit!  I cut my potatoes more like fries than wedges (with a crinkle cutter) and parboiled them before seasoning.  When they cooled down, I put them into a bowl to toss them with olive oil (I just couldn't picture putting the oil in the bag with the dry seasonings) before seasoning. 

The baking time was perfect...turned them halfway through.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Good. I didn't have onion powder and used garlic salt instead of garlic powder and salt. Boiled for 7 min prior to baking and asked for 50 min and still wasn't crispy.

Works well if you flip the potatoes 2/3 of the way through cooking, then add an extra 5 min. to the cooking time.

These are amazing! I really didn't think they'd have as much flavour as they do. I had a little trouble making the mixture stick when I shook them up so I just kind of smushed the seasoning into them when I poured them on the pan. Will certainly be making them again and again!

This recipe was great! The perfect amount of everything. I didn't have olive oil so i used vegetable oil, and I only had red potatoes so i used more than 2. But they were superb!!!!!!

Tried boiling these for 7 minutes as on user recommended - I would advise againtst this.  The potato is mushy and does not hold wedge shape.

We all loved these potatoes.  I didn't use the oil, but instead sprayed the potatoes with Pam and then sprinkled the cheese and seasonings over.  I cut them a little thinner because we like our potatoes crisp.  My 2 daughters were actually fighting over who got the last few left in the pan.  Perfect compliment to our grilled chicken.

Wow! Very good.  Made as directed - excellent.  Unfortunately I didn't have enough parmesan but still turned out great.  Cooking time is bang on, but you can always improvise. I was cooking sausages so I had to do about 400 for 40 mins and that worked well too.  Tastes wonderful - thanks!

Wow, these potato wedges will change the way you feel about jo-jos! So much more healthier fried french fries. I did soften (cook) them in the microwave for 6 minutes lightly seasoned with the oil, salt & pepper. Then sprinkled the seasonings over the potatoes, tossed them, cooked in oven, done in 15 minutes. No more deep fry french fries and my grandsons (kinda picky) gobble them up. Those boys even heat them up themselves for a snack the nest day! Great with burgers, hot dogs and just had them with ribs today! YUMMY!

These are awesome! I didn't use onion powder though. They are definitely going to be a regular in my house. I flipped the potatoes after the first 15 minutes and cooked the last ten so both sides had a crispy texture. Mmmmm so good!

This was very easy to make, and really good too! I'm giving it 4 stars because it was a little too salty for my taste. I'm definitely going to make this again, but cutting down on the salt b/c adding that onto everything else was a bit too much.

This recipe was quick, easy, and yummy. The potatoes cooked up exactly as described. It doesn't seem like the seasonings in the bag approach will work so the coating will adhere to the potatoes, but it did surprisingly well. My family enjoyed the crisp tastiness. I will definitely add this to my repertoire of potato dishes.

Wow, I REALLY can make restaurant-style potatoe wedges at home in my own oven!  These were great!  I made the recipe as is, and next time, will simply add a bit more salt.  I recommend cutting the potatoes into sixteenths for smaller, crunchier wedges (depending the potato's size).  Yum!  Very easy, will make these again and again!

Yum!  Exactly what I was looking for!  Crispy and delicious.  (I cooked them for a bit longer because I like them extra crispy).  Love the flavour the parmesan give them.

These were really good!  Served with sloppy joes, 3 potatoes were more than enough to feed 5.  Will increase the seasoning next time, especially salt and garlic powder.  I was amazed at how well they browned and crisped in the oven.

I was a little confused by the method used in coating the potatoes, so I did mine a little differently.  I tossed the wedges in olive oil and sprinkled them with parmesan and seasonings.  I still had trouble getting my seasoning to stick to the potatoes, but I can't imagine what would have happened if I'd tossed everything in a plastic bag.  As I arranged the wedges in the baking dish I tried to press the rest of the parmesan mixture on with a spatula.  I managed to get most of it on there, but I'm wondering if there would be a better way to get it to stick.  Maybe I should have used the bag method after all?  I used russet potatoes, but both hubby and I agreed that we'd probably have preferred red skins.  All in all this had nice flavor and they browned up nicely.  A sprinkling of fresh parsley when plating helps brighten this up.

Oh My Goodness! These potatoes were soooooo good! The parmesean really added great flavor. I didn't have russets at the time so I used the Yukon Golds that I had on hand.  I also used garlic flavored olive oil because that's what I had. I still used the garlic powder because I love garlic. D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S! I covered the jelly roll pans (I doubled the recipe) with foil and sprayed them with canola oil spray. I used 2 different foils to see if there would be a difference. I found that using non-stick foil really helped. The potatoes on the regular foil stuck a little. I too found that they needed to stay in a few mins. longer than stated in the recipe. Thanks for the great recipe Heather.

These were delicious.  My whole family ate them right up!  We were almost out of garlic powder, so I used a 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder and a 1/2 teaspoon of dry italian dressing mix, and they turned out delicious!  I left them in a little longer until I pulled the meat off the grill, and they were crispy and delicious!  Thanks for sharing this recipe with us!

Yummy, and very easy to make.  My fussy family loved them.  I agree, make sure you spray the cookie sheet with some Pam.......and make sure you flip them about half way through the cook time.  Enjoy!!

These are simple, fast, and delicious!! I loved them! I didn't have any onion powder, but they still were great. I was hungry, so I also took them out about 6 minutes early, and they were plenty done and crispy by then. I paired these with sloppy Joe's, and it was perfect! The flavor was a little strong by themselves for me, but dipped in ketchup, I could eat these for days!

Not bad, I didn't have onion powder so I used Lowery's Seasoning instead. Came out pretty good. I still have to get the cook time right but all in all good for something different.

My whole family can not get enough of these. I cut the potatoes like fries instead of wedges. Also two potatoes is not enough. I use about 8 for 2 adults and 3 children!

I followed the recipe exactly, and flipped them over halfway.  They are wonderful!  Next time, I will tweak the spices to my liking.  Thanks for sharing this!

Very tasty. I noted other reviewers noted additional cooking time needed, so I cut the wedges smaller -- probably 12 per potato.

This is another recipe that is so simple, yet so delicious.  There is the perfect balance of flavors.  This is now my go to recipe for homemade fries, without all the added fat of frying. Thanks Heather!

These potatoes were very good.  When they were done, I put them in a hot skillet with a bit of oil and some butter to crisp them up more, just my personal preference.  These were very good and very easy.  Thank you.

Very good, my husband usually doesn't like potato wedges or steak fries, he loved these, and so did I. I cooked about five minutes too long though to get them extra crispy. You definately want to take them out close to the 25 minutes or one side will burn a little.

These were great! I used sliced red potatoes. The only other thing I changed was I used onion salt instead of powder because that's all I had. This made it a little on the salty side, but they were still fabulous. Will definitely make again. Thanks!

YUMMY!!  ditto to flipping the wedges half way through and leaving them in alittle longer to crisp up more to my liking.  They were very tasty!  My suggestion tweak the measurements for the spices to ur tastes.. I added alittle more of everything and it tasted so GOOD!! This ones a keeper!!

This was a wonderful blend of spices!  My family enjoyed them. I ended up making too many, so I put the remainder in the refrigerator and put them back in the oven for the next days dinner.  Once again was a hit!

These were very tasty, and my BF loved them. He asked me to cut the potatoes into smaller chunks next time, cuz he liked the outside flavors so much. I served them with a ketchup/mayo combo, but we ate more of them without it.

Delicious.  My husband went back for seconds.  Being a ketchup freak, I put a line of the red stuff on each wedge and they were out-and-out awesome!

I just made these for my lunch, the apartment smelled so good while they were cooking!  Being English, I grew up eating "chip butties" which are basically homemade french fries on bread and butter with malt vinegar on top.  These made THE best chip butties ever!

I used red potatoes cut into chunks. Cooked more like 35 min. OMG!  These are wonderful! They stuck to the pan but that was actually a good thing.  The part that stuck was crunchy (not burnt) and the parmesan cheese (fresh, grated) browned--the bottom of the chunks were the tastiest.  I won't spray the pan next time either.  And there will be plenty of "next times."  Thanks!

My family loves potatoes and I've been looking for a great simple recipe to make in a snap.  I doubled the recipe and added a little more of the seasongings along with more salt.  These are very tasty and crispy.  Thanks a bunch!!
