I made this soup this morning and we just had it for lunch. I followed the recipe exactly except for the peas (didn't have any on hand) but next time will be sure to add those. This soup is so great!! Everyone loves it and several people had seconds - the flavors are excellent and we really like how the stuffing adds another dimension to the soup. Definitely a keeper - next time I'll probably cut back on the rice by about 1/2 cup - the proportion of rice to other ingredients was a little heavy. Thanks for an awesome recipe!!

The flavor is OK but the consistency is that of a rice casserole.  I thought two cups of rice was a lot.  Maybe I did something wrong. (I don't think so.) I followed the recipe except that I didn't have any sage (but my dressing had a lot), and I forgot to add the peas.  I didn't follow the methods as I didn't want to cook my fresh veggies for an hour and a half, which can render them essentially flavorless, not to mention mushy.  I cooked the turkey bones and broth; removed the bones, strained the broth, then addeded the stuffing, veggies, and rice. Anyway, the idea of using stuffing and rice is a novel use of leftover stuffing and does taste good.  If I try this recipe again, I would not use (canned) chicken broth due to the high sodium content, and because simmering the turkey bones is basically making stock anyway.

This soup was great; kids ages 7 & 9 loved it, so did husband. This made about 12 servings, so I'll have some to freeze. I took another reviewer's suggestion and roasted the turkey bones at 400F, turning every 15 mins until they browned. The cornbread dressing added a nice texture. I had brined my turkey and then roasted it the following inside: 1 sliced red apple, 1/2 of an onion (sliced), 2 tsp poultry seasoning, 2 tsp sage, 1 tbsp rosemary, and a cinnamon stick. The spices gave the broth a wonderful flavor. I also added 1/2 package wide egg noodles during the last 15 mins of cooking. I will keep this recipe with my Thanksgiving collection and make it again at Christmas. Thanks for posting!

This is so delicious and very similar to a recipe that my step-MIL makes. I used a box of mixed frozen veggies (carrots, peas, corn and grean beans), I also added some leftover gravey, extra poultry seasoning, sage and thyme. I decreased the rice to 1/2c. When I was cooking down the carcass, I covered that with just water in a huge pot and simmered that for a good 4 hours until all the meat fell off the bones and the everything kinda fell apart. I added 4 chicken boullion packets to this. After this was done, I strained all of my turkey broth in to another big pot, added a carton (4c.) of low sodium/fat free chicken broth, all of the meat that I shredded and picked over, the veggies, seasonings, stuffing, etc.....This made a HUGE pot of soup....way to chock full of meat and veggies to eat as is....So I am packing and freezing this as is and when reheating, I will add more chicken broth to "thin" out this wonderful soup. I love the stuffing in this.....tastes like thanksgiving in a bowl. Thank you!  PS...this is my first time ever boiling down a carcass and making soup and one thing that I think is really important is to serioulsy pick over and feel that there is no little bones, membranes, grissel and or fat or skin in this soup. Take the time...it is worth it.   :)

I used mostly water instead of chicken stock but added some of the leftover gravy to thicken it up.  Fantastic. My family is still talking about it from last year and are looking forward to me making it again tonight.

I just made this soup but didn't have any stuffing. I'm sure it would have been better with the stuffing but it was still great with lots of taste!  It's a keeper!

Between the poultry seasoning and the stuffing, there was way too much depth of flavor going on here for our tastes. I'll be looking for another recipe next year. Thank you anyway.

I made this recipe tonight and it turned out fabulous!! I added a potato cut up into small pieces, and I did not add the peas (only because i do not like them). I did not have chicken broth so I used bouillon cubes 1/2 chicken and 1/2 beef. Those were the only modifications I made. I will definitely make it again. Thanks for the recipe.

I did not follow this recipe exactly, but I liked the general idea.  This is what I did:  browned my turkey carcass in the oven, then made stock with it, adding water, carrots, celery, onion, peppercorns, bay leaves, whole sage leaves and rosemary sprigs.  I strained that and used some of it to make the soup, adding leftover chopped turkey, sauteed chopped onion and celery, carrots and about a cup of leftover stuffing, and I seasoned it with salt, pepper and a little fresh thyme.  I don't like rice in soups, so I used ditalini pasta and I used chopped spinach for the peas, adding that in just the last few minutes.  REALLY good soup!  The stuffing added a lot of flavor, and thickened it up ever so slightly.  I thought about adding some cannelini beans, but this soup was plenty hearty as is.

This soup is absolutely fantastic!  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  My guess is that those who said the soup had too much rice in it did not add enough water to the pot.  After adding 10 cups of chicken stock (2 1/2 quarts), I probably had to add at least that same amount of water, if not more, in order to cover the turkey carcass.  This recipe will be my new day-after-Thanksgiving recipe every year!

This was so easy and tasty. I had two turkey carcassas & no stuffing, so I used 2 boxes of boxed turkey flavored stuffing mix, followed everything else except for adding leftover gravy, didn't have that on hand. It came out soooo good! Already decided on Turkey for Christmas just to have the excuse to make this soup again!Thanks for submitting!

Much too messy to add the veggies before removing the turkey bones, etc. Simmer the picked over carcass with the leftover stuffing then strain and degrease the broth. This gives a bold flavor to which the rest of the ingredients are added.  There is no need for garlic!

I loved this soup with my changes. I used egg noodles instead of stuffing, I left out the rice, and used seasonings that suited my taste. I simply used the bone broth from boiling my turkey, didn't see any need to add the chicken broth. This was great, and a wonderful way to use up that left over turkey carcass. Waste not, want not.

I made this yesterday using okra instead of peas. it was sooooooo good. Not only was it satisfying but the aroma while cooking made it seem festive.  We finished feeling like we had just had thanksgiving diner again.  I will freeze the next turkey carcus so I can make it on a cold winter day when we need a little comfort.

This was such an easy soup to make and with a bit of seasoning (salt & pepper to taste), it was really good! I used a bag of baby carrots, no peas, and 3/4 bag of egg noodles instead of rice---because that's what I had.  Also, the stuffing I make has corn in it so that added an extra veggie. As suggested, I added gravy to the pot and, after covering the 13 lb. carcass with a broth/water combo, I'd say the yield was close to 5 quarts.

This soup IS very good.  I left out the peas because I didn't have any, but otherwise made exactly has written.  The stuffing adds a nice touch and is a great way to use up leftovers.  Try it, you'll like it!

This is a great base recipe. I added a lot more variety with my vegetables and used a wild/longrain rice combo. I did have some trouble getting all the bones, but I suppose that comes with the territory.

First attempt at making turkey soup. Easy and delicious. Only thing I changed was I left out the celery as I did not have any. Also threw in some spinach as I needed to use it up

Only change is that I did not add the stuffing to the soup. I baked to stuffing to crisp it, then added it to the top of the soup before serving it like a crouton. Really great recipe!

Just got done eating a bowl of this. It is alright. I did not have rice so I just threw in the bag of no yolk noodles I had and skipped the peas. I'm not sure about putting stuffing it in, I had to scoop out so bread clumps. With the right amount of salt and pepper it is decent. The boyfriend loved it!

** update- seven years later and I'm still making this!!  has more flavor the next day-- so yummy!! Over the years I learned to boil the carcass with the broth (I use better than bouillon because that's just how I roll) and spices for "awhile"- at least hour but usually around 2 hours. Then I add the veggies (always extra carrots). I still use the no yolk noodles- I just think it is too mushy with rice. I add in frozen corn since some family members do not like peas. Oh, and I don't add in the stuffing- I just throw in more seasoning- you know, for balance.  :-)

Was searching for ways to use up the Thanksgiving leftovers and ran across this.  It sounded interesting and would use up more than just the leftover turkey.  My hubby is not a huge soup fan but he absolutely loved it!  I agree with others that there was too much rice for my taste.  Not very "soupy" - more like a rice dish.  Would only use about 3/4 C next time.  Flavors were wonderful I didn't add as much as called for as my dressing and leftover turkey were already very flavorful.  Don't be afraid of the odd addition of the dressing - give it a try!  Can't wait to have it for lunch today.

Made this today with Thanksgiving leftovers. The whole family LOVED it! Reminds me of soup my grandma used to make. One bit of advice; this would probably be good with a stuffing like stove top, but if you make your own stuffing, the larger chunks of bread turn to a gloppy mess. I ended up fishing out as much of it as possible. The little bits that were in there were tasty though. I only added a few shakes of poultry seasoning and about a cup of left over gravy. Delicious!

I used a combination of broth from cooking the turkey and low sodium chicken broth.  I also cut down on the rice. I find that rice makes soup too stickey so I add cooked rice as it is served.  I put parsnips in mine.  Have made turkey soup like this for years.  Waste not, want not.

I have made this soup for years. A friend suggested to me to put carcas  and tidbits back in the uncleaned roaster it was cooked in ( I make the gravy in roaster on stove top). add 1 chopped onion, 2 bay leaves, salt and cover with water. Pop it back in the oven 400F for 2 hours. Strain returning bits of turkey back to the broth. You can freeze this in containers adding to it whatever you like when you want some fresh turkey soup. Dual purpose, roaster is easy to clean after.

I used a box of orzo instead of rice. Also needed at least 2 more cups of stock and at least 8 more cups of water to cover the carcass of my 22 pound turkey. Works out just fine, since there is so much more soup to go around!

This soup does have the consistency of porrige, the rice amount is good.  In Hawaii we call it Chook and in Hong Kong something very like it is breakfast fare every day.  I was pleased to find it in my daily email --I made it according to recipe using plenty of kalua turkey as I did not have a single bone but plenty turkey.  Shocked over the sodium amt.  so I did not add salt and must say not needed.  Thank you very much.  Mahalo

Not happy with the way it turned out.  It was pretty mushy and not too much flavor.  I won't make again. Others may like it, it just isn't for me.  Glad I tried it though...now I know.

Just made this Thanksgiving afternoon and was easy and fun to make.  We did take a previous reviewers advice and cut back on the amount of rice by 1/2 cup and glad we did as the rice continues to soak up liquid.  We also used only half the amount of chicken broth and added more water to let the carcass provide stock for us without the added salt in prepared chicken broth.  Savory worked quite well in place of sage.  5 year old and wife alike loved it as much as I did!  A keeper ~ Thanks for posting!

In my house, "leftover" stuffing (and bacon...and wine) is much like Santa Claus, in that it doesn't exist!  So, I used a box of sage-flavored stuffing mix.  Other than that, and decreasing the rice to 1 and 1/2 cups (which we thought was plenty), I followed the recipe as written.  I debated on what to rate this.  My daughter and I thought it was okay, while my boyfriend said it was "really good".  Ultimately, I guess I just prefer to make a stock out of the carcass first, rather than make a soup with it.  As the cook, I found it a bit off-putting to fish bones and skin out of my pot of beautiful ingredients, and I think it is simpler overall to just make and strain a broth.  This was a nice enough meal for a chilly winter's night, and I am glad I tried it.  Just not so sure I would make it again.   Thanks for sharing the recipe :)

I made this on Black Friday.  I did not put in the peas (didn't want to) and added egg noodles instead of rice.  It was so good!  My family liked it too (even my pick eater daughter).  It even tasted better the next day.  I definitely will make this again.  Thanks for sharing.

I've made this a couple of times, omitted the stuffing and used medium size egg noodles instead of the rice - and it always comes out absolutely delicious.  The flavor is to die for. My 2 young children LOVE it as well.

This was the best turkey soup I've ever made.  The difference:  the addition of the leftover stuffing, which I would never have considered.  I was a little leery of what it might do to the texture, but it was totally fine, no mushiness or soggy bread texture.  The only changes I made were to leave out the poultry seasoning and sage, as I felt the stuffing would provide the needed flavors, and it did.  It was really delicious, and I will definitely make it whenever I have the opportunity.

Awesome recipe for using up your leftovers after a holiday! Instead of adding chicken broth, I just boiled my turkey carcass for 4-6 hours and ended up with very flavorful broth without the added salt (and expense) of canned chicken broth. The huge amount of flavor in my broth could be because my turkey was injected with cajun seasoning and fried though! I boiled the carcass the day before I planned to make the soup so I could refrigerate it and skim off some of the fat. I was lucky enough to have a few cups of turkey meat left over that I added to this soup also. I used only about a cup of rice instead of two cups since this has extra carbs from the stuffing and used my leftover green bean casserole and a large can of veg-all instead of the frozen peas for more nutritional value. This recipe is great! Who would have thought to use stuffing in a soup? And since it has stuffing, of course you have to add any leftover gravy that you might have also ;o) This soup smelled heavenly while it cooked. Thank you!

good recipe.  left out the peas, since after tasting thought it was complete, and doubled both the carrots and celery.  Also substituted half the broth for water, and added a little salt.  Added a clove of chopped garlic and, like others, was really skeeved out mixing the stuffing in with the turkey before it was cleaned.  The recipe isn't specific, but once the turkey is done boiling, you need to go through it really well to pull out bones and fat.  Added stuffing after turkey was cleaned, and used much less rice.

Followed this recipe exactly except for cutting back to 1 1/2 cups rice based on others' comments. At first I thought I should have kept it at 2 cups because it was very brothy but as it sat to cool down it thickened up quite a bit.

I love this soup! Have made after the day after Thanksgiving three years in a row and I look forward to it as much as Thanksgiving dinner.  The dressing absolutely makes the soup.  I add twice as much stuffing as the recipe calls for adding half at the start and the remainder at the end. I also used brown rice instead of white rice.  I also strain the soup after removing the carcass because I don't like all those little bits of carcass that are sometimes left behind.

This soup is great!  I have now made it twice (last year and this one) right after Thankgiving.  I do add more broth/water, but otherwise we love it as is.  Use whatever frozen veggies you have on hand and freeze to serve later!  Since I cook my stuffing right in the turkey cavity, this is the best recipe to "use up" the turkey.  I didn't have to add any additonal stuffing to the soup this year.

Really liked this.  Would do the carcass in broth by itself first, then strain it to prevent  any bones being left in,  but other than that this is a great way to repurpose leftovers.  Really nice on a cool day

I used the recipe for the first time today and the soup was great. I read a lot of the reviews and used the recipe as a base. I cooked my carcass in mostly water with about a cup of broth, s&p, and garlic for four hours. I strained the meat and chopped it to go back in the pot. While cooling and separating the meat, I threw all of my veggies (in my case carrots, celery, onion, green peppers and corn) in the pot with another couple of cups of broth. I used the bay leaves and poultry seasoning but did not have sage on hand. I did not use stuffing because I couldn't get anyone to agree to sacrifice it, but I did add some gravy to thicken it a bit. I cooked the veggies about an hour and added 3/4 of a package of wide egg noodles in the last 15 minutes. This recipe yielded almost 6 quarts so I'm going to be freezing a lot of it. I will continue to play with it each time I make it. Thanks for the recipe!

I just loved this soup! Easy to prepare. I made instant stuffing, because I didn't have any leftover. Yum! The rice on hand that I had was wild. Served next day at aTailgate party.I re-warmed in a crock pot. Added some additional chicken broth to make a nice consistency . Nets

I can't wait for the next turkey dinner so I can snag the carcass for another soup.  This recipe is wonderful.  Followed the instruction pretty much to the letter.  I didn't use peas because I didn't have the.  I added the zest of one lemon to the broth just because I like a hint of lemon.  I added cooked rice to the bowl and poured hot soup over rice. Got rave reviews. Even my six year old granddaughter who didn't even want to try it loved it.  It's a keeper!

I have made turkey soup this way for years with a few changes; I use whole wheat egg noodles instead of rice and if there are any mashed potatoes left over, add them to the mix. They thicken the soup a bit to a creamier consistency. (If there are no mashed potatoes left over, throw in a 1/2 cup or so of instant mashed potatoes!) I also add a can of cream soup, mushroom or celery are best. This is our favorite "after Thanksgiving" meal!

I thought this was intriguing with the addition of stuffing to it. It does give the broth a much heartier consistency. I followed the recipe for the most part. I only added a teaspoon of poultry seasoning an I wish I had headed someone's advice to add only one cup of rice. I used 1 1/2 cups and it was just a bit much. I added more chicken stock. But, all and all, I woul make this again next year. I have (6) 2 pound deli containers for the freezer and enough for dinner.

Absolutely delicious!  I didn't have the carcass, but added cut up turkey.  Used chicken boullion cubes, didn't have bay leaves, peas or poultry seasoning.  I did add some leftover gravy.  It is wonderful!

This is the perfect way to use up the turkey dinner leftovers and make a delicious stew. I did not have any rice so I used pasta instead. Another reviewer said to add the leftover gravy so I tried that as well. It was so delicious and satisfying that even my picky eater son ate some. My husband and I both plan on taking some to work today for lunch. The bonus is that this pot of stew cost next to nothing to make since it mainly consists of leftovers. Yay!!

This was wonderful!  I think many times turkey soup can be somewhat boring, but not this one.  After reading the other reviewer comments, I put about 1-1/3 cups of rice in.  It was more than plenty.  As the soup sits the rice just keeps absorbing the liquid.  I may cut back to 1 cup next time.  The flavors were terrific and I liked the "stew" consistency.  I will definitely make this again.  Perfect for cold winter days!

Loved this! It made the best turkey soup ever! The only changes I made were I used pasta instead of rice(my husband does not like rice) and I used the celery and onion that was roasted in the cavity of the turkey instead of fresh. MMMMMM delicious!

Pretty tasty I must say.  I added a little seasoning salt to give it more flavor.  Also, my wife makes cream cheese corn with the T-day meal.  I took what was left and threw it in.  Came out great.

This has become my "go to" way to make homemade chicken noodle soup. You can use a rotisserie chicken instead of turkey. I don't add the peas or stuffing (preference) and instead after the soup simmers for an hour I will pick the meat off the bones, let it simmer for another 30 with the chicken pieces in it. I make egg noodles on the side and add them to the individual bowls instead of the pot so they don't get soggy. I have made with rice as written- tastes good but by the next day the rice has absorbed all the liquid and its almost a casserole instead of a soup.

Do not use uncooked rice in this recipe. If you do, you will most likely end up with little to no broth left. It will essentially be turkey flavored rice. If you must use uncooked rice, just use a small amount. Solution: add cooked rice or cooked pasta when everything else is done.

This was really good and a great use of that carcass!  Only changes I made were to use two chicken carcasses because that's what I had and to use brown rice instead of white.  I too found that there wasn't enough liquid so next time would decrease the rice to 1 to 1 1/2 cups I think.  I also think I would add more chicken or turkey than just what was left on the bones.  Guess I pick the bones too clean because there really wasn't much meat in the soup.  All in all will certainly make again!

I've made this twice...the 1st time I went by the receipe almost exactly. It was okay, but I was slightly grossed out by having to fish the turkey bones and body parts out of the stock. The 2nd time, I used half of the carcass of a 16lb turkey, and tied it into cheesecloth.  This method flavored the stock without the bony-mess. I added what was left of my french meat stuffing (has a bit of ground beef and ground pork in it), leftover homemade gravy, and medium egg noodles - which I cooked separately and added once the soup was done...and WOW = DElish !!! I did not add sage or poultry seasoning since I add Bell's Poultry Seasoning to my stuffing and spices are in that already. With a few modifications, this soup is the bomb-dot-com. Thanks to the OP for a great starter receipe.

The flavor of this is wonderful. I took it down a star because if you leave the carcass in the soup it is quite miserable to get the bones out later. I've solved this two ways. Once I tied the carcass in cheesecloth. I could then pull the carcass out easily to get the meat. The next time I made it in my pasta pot. Everything but the carcass went in the main pot while the carcass went in the colander pot. This was the easiest way to clean the carcass later and the way I've made it since.

I have been making this for past three years, whenever I cook a turkey.  I share this recipe all the time; it’s one of the best soups I make!  I also use this recipe with rotisserie chicken. I’ve also used kale, squash, zucchini, spinach, or whatever fresh veggies I have on hand; delicious each and every time.  Thanks for sharing this staple recipe!

Very good!! I reduced the rice to 1 C. (and still felt overwhelmed by the amount of rice...). I put all of this in my slow cooker and left it on low for about 4 hours. I added a spoonful of leftover pan gravy, and in the end, everyone thought the soup was delicious! Would definitely make this again next year!

After two attempts of turkey soup, I figured I try this one.  The only thing I did not add was the poultry seasoning because of the review I read.  My husband commented how good it was twice while watching TV.  To me that is success. He said keep this recipe.

Excellent recipe!  Also added some leftover flour free gravy I made from turkey's original pan drippings and root vegetables, all pureed with immersion blender.  Thickened the soup up a bit and gave it great flavor.

Didn't have time to make this soup the day after Thanksgiving so I froze my turkey carcass until yesterday (1 week after Thanksgiving). I did roast the carcass for about 40 mins. @350 first because brown food tastes best!  I made this soup and I used brown rice instead of white rice since that's just like styrofoam so I cooked the soup with the rice for about 1 hour.  I did use 3 qts. of home made chicken stock.  This was great!  Thanks.

This soup was very good. My son in law, not only had a big bowl for dinner, but also took it for his luch the next day. We  just added the left over gravy to give it more body.

Wow what a great day after the party dish. It is sooo good, we just loved it. I made it just exactly like the recipe, which is the only way to do a real review. It is like thanksgiving in a bowl. If you don't like this you don't like thanks giving dinner at all. My new favorite soup. Thanks Honeybear24 I will think of you every time I make this again

Great use of the leftover turkey. I followed pretty closely to the recipe except substituted corn for the peas. I also reduced the amount of rice to 1 1/2 cups and am glad I did, otherwise it would have been too thick. Oh, I also added about 3/4 cup of stuffing because I was afraid it would add a weird consistency to the soup. I'm not sure the stuffing is even needed but not bad to add it anyway. Thanks for the great recipe!

DELICIOUS!!!  I used more water than chicken broth, so I added a couple of heaping tablespoons of chicken boullion granules.  I also used orzo pasta instead of rice, which made it more stew-like in it's consistency.  Serve with warm sour dough bread, it's wonderful on a cold, winter day.  I will make this again.

I LOVE this recipe, and the fact the I can use my leftover dressing in it, too!!  I freeze my turkey carcass until I'm ready to make the soup because I usually don't get around to making it for about a week after Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner.  Thanks for this great recipe!!

The soup was delicious! I didn't use the stuffing, peas, or rice.  I used orzo instead.  Easy to make.  And then for New Year's used a Costco chicken carcass and the breast meat.

I used water instead of broth, which with the turkey carcass made its own turkey broth. I used  farm grown pure savoury in place of sage. Didn’t use peas or rice.  The soup turned out great. Will make it again.

I will definitely use this the next time I cook a turkey. I boiled carcass before finding a soup recipe , refrigerated soup, skimmed off fat, went through bones to take off meat . After that I added everything except rice, put back in fridge till I got home from work, then added rice and boiled for an hour. Delish!

Very tasty and easy to make. The addition of the stuffing  is a great twist. Slightly thickens  the soup and adds great flavor. Definitely will make again.

I didn’t have white rice, so I used orzo. I also didn’t have frozen peas, so I used corn.  The entire family loved it! I will definitely make this soup again.

I didn’t have any poultry seasoning so made a batch myself and it was great. I also didn’t have celery but I did have some cabbage. So that got thrown in the pot.

I thought this was a great recipe, it was my first time making homemade turkey soup.  A couple of mods: -I followed the advice of one reviewer and baked the carcass for about 10-15 minutes at 400 degrees before putting it in the pot. -When I make this again, I might not do 2 cups of rice it gets pretty thick. -I did not add extra stuffing only what was left in the carcass. - I did 2 qts of chicken broth and 1 qt of water. -I added a little bit of sea salt for flavor. -I did not use any peas. My husband is a great cook and he was impressed!

I made this but didn’t like how it turned out so dry, I suggest not adding the rice it soaked up all the liquid, I feel like it ruined it and it’s not soup, I’m not happy.

It was very good! Added a sausage sage stuffing (leftover), some leftover gravy,  extra carrots because husband doesn't like green veggies, noodles instead of rice and just a little low sodium chicken broth (used mostly water). Oh, and  some lemon pepper seasoning to give it little tang. 
This will be my "day after" go-to from now on.

This is a great recipe, and works just as well with chicken. One word of caution: do NOT use the 2 cups of rice suggested unless you want a porridge instead of soup. Made that mistake the first time, cut it in half the second time - and even a single cup was too much. Otherwise, a delicious soup for the winter months.

Easy to make and good flavour, but the rice took over the soup! I would cut the rice in half so there is more broth; this may also enhance the flavours (less starch).

The rice soaks up most of the broth and the peas overpower the flavor. Perhaps cut both by 1/2.

Very flavourful.... followed recipe exactly except added new veggies after removing the carcass. 2 cups of rice does seem like a lot... would reduce by 1/2C next time.

We found this soup very bland. Filling but bland. I would look for ideas on flavor enhancers, possibly a bit less rice and I would use canned vs. frozen peas if made again.

The whole house smelled like Thanksgiving dinner again while the soup was cooking. The only thing I would do differently would be not to add the carrots and celery until later in the cooking process. Mine came out over cooked and mushy. Overall the flavor was fabulous. All those great Thanksgiving flavors!

My family who isn't crazy about turkey liked this recipe.  Sauteed onions in olive oil and garlic.  Used leftover fresh sage leaves and added lemon pepper.   Next year will make without  adding the stuffing, but otherwise a keeper.

Very Good! We used frozen green beans instead of peas other than that we made as written.  Fresh tasting.

Will make again.  If you bring water to a boil prior to putting in the meat you do not have to skim the top.  I used Jasmin rice simmered on low for 40 minutes at the end.

Good recipe but did make a few changes. Cooked the carcass with chicken broth, onion, celery, carrot and some spices to make the broth first then strained and focused on the soup. Didn’t have any stuffing but added some gravy for more flavor and to thicken a bit.  Also used noodles instead of rice. Turned out great!

Awesome recipe! Super easy and a great way to use the turkey carcass, instead of throwing it away and wasting it. I decided to make this last minute, so didn't have any rice. Instead, I added a few chopped up potatoes and it was great! Even the kids loved it. Served over egg noodles is really good, too!

Two cups of raw rice makes risotto, not soup. I should have known better. Next time will make with 1/2 cup or less.

Really good. Makes a lot! I used noodles rather than rice. Used precut mirepoix to save time. I used a combination of turkey broth and water.  My family loved it, and I will make again next time I have a turkey carcass lying around the house!

I'm wondering why the picture shows Turkey and NOODLES and not a noodle is in the recipe. But the thought of adding leftover stuffing is intriguing and will be trying it!

This is a wonderful Turkey soup!  We look forward to it all year.  I add all of my leftover bits of Thanksgiving dinner (savory items only--not the sweet).  TWO IMPORTANT NOTES, though: 1) Roast your carcass in the oven before boiling it.  Gives it much, much better flavor depth.  Just get it kind of crispy and really golden brown (don't burn it.)  And 2) Dont add your other ingredients to the broth until AFTER you've boiled the carcass.  There's going to be little tiny bones that you'll want to strain out and having other bits of things makes it difficult to get a nice clear stock.  Added tip:  After boiling, I put the pot in the fridge for several hours or overnight so the fat congeals at the top.  Makes for a healthier and less-greasy base.  I also use noodles but add at the end once the carrots, celery, etc. are tender, so the noodles don't get mushy.  Do it right and you have the best Turkey soup ever!

The soup has a wonderful flavor. I grew with others that there is too much rice!  Next time I will cut the amount of rice in half.

I made some changes as I always read the reviews before making a dish. I boiled the carcass in water for 2.5 hours then strained it and removed bones and skin. I then added one carton of chicken stock, 2 tsp of sage, 1 tbsp of garlic salt, 2 tbsp of chicken seasoning. I brought it back to a simmer and added 2 cans of carrots (I prefer the canned soft carrots), added a package of egg noodles and cooked for 10 minutes then added 2 cups of frozen peas and cooked for 5 minutes... it was delicious!!!

This i a nice satisfying soup to have on a cold winter day.  I   didn't add the rice or noodles.  It was already thick enough and I thought the stuffing was enough starch for the soup.  That said it would be good with some biscuits.

This soup recipe is fantastic! I've made it several times and didn't change a thing except I don't put rice in mine. I simply add a noodle that I have on hand. A broad Pasta noodle, or no yolks egg noodles seem to work great!

Few changes: I cooked carcass for two hours at a simmer, no foam to skim which was a plus, I added farfalle, and poultry seasoning. I added left over burnt stuffing, it turned out great.

I made this after my holiday work potluck with the leftover turkey carcasses. Did not have made stuffing so I added  cup dry crouton seasoned with poultry seasoning. Broth was already made and the turkey's picked clean. So essembled the soup rather than starting from scratch. Added 1 cup  each cooked white and wild rice. Great recipe, thanks!!

I used cream of chicken with water rather than chicken broth. Added noodles, took out the peas and added some cabbage. It was SO GOOD!! I didn't have all the ingredients to make it according to recipe so I altered those couple of things. Knowing that mine turned out great just means the original is fantastic!

Really good soup.  I used this excellent recipe as a blueprint and adjusted to our personal tastes.  I used all water, no chicken broth and after everything simmered for about 2 hours, I strained out all the solids and skimmed most of the fat.  After sautéing the onion, carrots and celery, I added it to the stock along with leftover turkey and leftover mashed potatoes.  Finished it with some peas and half bag of egg noodles.  Simply delicious!  Thank you for sharing.

Tasty and easy to make, glad to use up some of the left-overs from Thanksgiving.  Everyone like it, made enough for 6-7 adults. I used Egg Noodles instead of rice which I cook separately as I don't like them in the soup as they can get mushy if kept overnight.

I used a mixture of white and wild rice instead of noodles.  What a great soup!  My husband and I will make this regularly!

I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I used one teaspoon of wet minced garlic instead of garlic salt since I used bouillon which is always salty to me.  I used a teaspoon of pepper.  Both the minced garlic and pepper were added at the same time as the other seasonings.  I did use the full 2 cups of uncooked rice and don't think it was casserole-like at all, but definitely a thick & hearty soup.  Admittedly, I used an extra quart of water as needed to cover the carcass.  I didn't have frozen peas so I substituted canned peas.  We all loved it!

I followed the recipe with the exception of the leftover stuffing (no such thing with my family!).  Came out wonderful, but I too would decrease the amount of rice (or add two cups of cooked rice).

I make turkey soup every year based on this recipe.  I always simmer my carcass  covered in water for about 5 hours,  add some chicken broth, bay leave, onions.  After the 5 hours I strain it to get the bones, etc. out and then I cool it down to skim off all the fat.   The broth when cool will be very jello like which is perfect.  Then I put it into the large stock pot and add whatever vegetable I have on hand, a cup of leftover stuffing  and since I make stuffing with pork sausage meat/onions/seasoning and bread crumbs  rather than bread cubes I don't end up with chunks of bread.   I skip the rice.   Add sage/poultry seasoning/onions/bay leaves/pepper and left over turkey meat and gravy and let simmer for another hour.  Delicious!

Delicious way to finish up the leftovers from Thanksgiving.  I doubled the stuffing and carrots which was great.  This is going to be a new staple for our holiday season.

Followed the recipe pretty closely but added mushrooms and I just threw my noodles in the mix to cook and ended up adding more broth to keep it soupy.  Hubby was impressed and this was awesome the next day reheated, too.

This is delicious.  I added noodles instead of rice,  omitted the peas and  it tasted great.  Great way to use the leftover turkey.  Definitely will make this again. It also freezes well for future last minute lunch

I am rating the recipe as-is. Too much salt for my taste. A little too much rice, also. All in all, it was just okay.

I improvised with a few things I already had a the house. I only had 1 regular sized can of chicken broth, so I used that and added 10 chicken bouillon cubes. I used fresh garlic instead of powdered, and used a bag of egg noodles instead of rice. I thought it turned out great! Very tasty, and such a nice way to use all the leftovers from the turkey. So little went to waste. I'll definitely do it again next year. :)

Overall I felt this was a waste of precious thanksgiving leftovers. It's too bland. Too much rice. Prevailing flavors are rice and peas. Next time I'd double the stuffing and spices. I'd sub rice for a pasta or an alternative. I'd maybe use green beans instead of peas.

We love this soup!  Along with some homemade sourdough bread, this was a hearty meal!  I made the following changes:  first was to make turkey stock from the turkey legs.  I used 8 cups of water, diced onion, 2 bay leaves, 1 tsp poultry seasoning, 1 tsp ground sage, 2 sprigs of fresh rosemary, cracked peppercorns and about 2 tsp sea salt. Then brought to a boil and covered and simmered for at least 2 hours.  I removed the turkey legs and strained the solids from the stock.  Next I chopped celery and diced onion and sauteed in 2 T of butter until onions were translucent.  Then I added 3 carrots, peeled and chopped, and cooked for a couple minutes using medium-low heat.  I added this to the stock along with leftover turkey shredded from breast meat as well as the dark meat pulled from the legs.  Then the spices to taste - half tsp cayenne pepper, garlic powder, 1 tsp parsley flakes, and salt and pepper.  Instead of rice or stuffing, I added 8 oz of wide noodles from Amish Kitchens.  Return to a boil then simmered 10 min until noodles were done.  Perfect!

It's good , but that 25 minute cook time on the rice was WRONG! Mine took 45 minutes. Next time, I'll make the rice first and just add it at the end of the recipe.

I added leftover  gravy (although there wasn't much leftover), leftover cream corn, butter beans and mushrooms. I used 8 cups of chicken broth and about 6 cups of water. Everything else was by the recipe.  It was awesome. Our company loved it and so did we!

I was a bit confused because the picture showed egg-noodles and the recipe had rice. I used the noodles and its quite good, I was a little apprehensive about the stuffing but it's quit good.

I made it today and substituted Orzo instead of rice.   Since my wife is not a fan of peas, I left them out.  Simple and tasty.

I made it with broad egg noodles rather than rice and I didnt use stuffing. But the soup was fantastic. I'll definitely do it after every turkey each year. New tradition!

followed the recipe but no peas and used 1/2 a bag of egg noodles instead of rice. When I saw that dressing was to be added I questioned it but it was Delicious!!! Made this again this year and it is always a great way to clean up the left overs :)

Soo delicious!!! I will be making this with my leftover turkey every year!! Instead of noodles or rice I added tortellini to bulk it up a bit. Also, instead of chopping up some carrots I just tossed in a bunch of frozen peas and carrots. Hubs and both of our boys (4 & 7) love it!!

This recipe was good.  I added a couple of potatoes and green beans.  I substituted pasta shells for the rice.  There was too much seasoning for my family's taste and I had to skim it off the top with some fat when the soup cooled after I removed the carcass.  Also, it was salty enough with the chicken broth so I substituted garlic powder for the garlic salt. I really like that this recipe takes much less time than other turkey soup recipes that use the carcass.

I used rice, celery and carrots along with some fresh sage and left out most of the seasoning, to let each person salt to taste. First time, I had three bowls. This is a great way to finish off a turkey.

Had to scale for a 21lb turkey carcass and got a little heavy handed with the rice.  A bit more like casserole than soup, but very delicious and my freezer is packed.

Used the legs of the turkey rather than the carcass, and elbow pasta rather than rice. Turned out very good, added a bit of extra water as I found it slightly salty. My 2 yr old loved it, am looking forward to taking it to work for lunches.

This was a great base recipe. I agree that it turned out more like a rice casserole than a soup, but it was still a great way to use up leftover turkey. I think I may use noodles the next time I make this

Still waiting on it to finish but just taste-tested and AWESOME! I also love the idea of no wasted Thanksgiving leftovers. I also added 1 cup dried tomatoes and a few frozen chopped up banana peppers. Thanks for this great idea!

My first time making turkey bone soup, and it's delicious! I skipped the peas because I didn't have any and adjusted the seasonings a bit because I did have to add water. But very happy with the results, will definitely make again.

I loved this recipe. I am a first time turkey soup maker and it guided me a lot. I did make a few changes....I changed the rice for pasta and added 3 cups of extra water as I found it too salty. That may be because I don't really measure my salt when I should...but either way turned out great. I added little bit of turkey gravy I had left, like 1/4 of a cup (the easy turkey recipe off this site, also very great) but I won`t look any further for a recipe cause this one does the trick!

My husband actually made this instead of me, and it was amazing!!!! Usually we don't even attempt to make turkey soup as his grandmother makes an amazing one. But when he made this one, I can't believe how close it tasted to hers...gues we'll be making our own from now on instead of asking her to make it! Thanks very much!

OMG! Really loved that fact that nothing is wasted after Thanksgiving. I didn't have the carcass so I used the leftover chicken stock I had, also added 4 cups of water to stretch it out. Other than that I followed the recipe and it turned out great! My hubby was very happy :)

I never would have thought to add stuffing...it was like having dumplings. My family loved this. Next to turkey a al king, this is a new Thanksgiving staple.

I made this yesterday & even doubled the recipe so I could serve a large group.  Not sure what happened. 3 hours after adding the rice, the rice was still uncooked. Will be finding a new recipe.

Great and easy recipe! I normally make a Turkey Soup after the big day and put the stuffing on the bottom of the serving bowl before adding the soup. I did that with this recipe as I was worried my homemade stuffing would turn out goopy if cooked in the soup. Super Yummy!! Thanks!

This is very similar to Better Homes & Gardens Turkey Frame Soup.  Here's the thing with soup...it doesn't have to be exact.  Use what you have and what you like!  I usually have a >20lb turkey so I break up the carcass to fit it into the pot more easily.  Otherwise this is a great way to finish up the leftover turkey.

Good idea, putting left over dressing into the soup.  I used a blend of long grain brown and wild rice and also added frozen corn.  Very good!!

Absolutely yummy, but with following changes: Decrease rice by 1/2 cup, add veggies and stuffing AFTER you remove the carcass and bones, and I increase the celery & carrots since we like alot.  Yes you will likely add water to cook the carcass, so recipe makes alot. Stuffing is great addition, thanks for sharing. This is my go-to soup each time I have a turkey carcass.

As some of the other reviewers mentioned, the soup ends up being much more like a casserole with 2 cups of rice. I personally enjoy the consistency, but was definitely surprised as the soup got thicker and thicker.  I am relatively new to the kitchen, so having a simple to follow recipe was appreciated. And it turned out great! I look forward to making this again next year.

This is pretty good.  I didn't have stuffing on hand, so I just used a little extra rice.  Speaking of rice, this recipe calls for a lot of it.  This makes a very filling, budget-friendly recipe but because I'm just cooking for two I definitely would cut the recipe in half next time.  Thanks!
