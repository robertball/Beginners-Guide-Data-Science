Absolutely delicious! I baked them a few days prior to when I needed them and so I put them in the freezer. They're delicious even when frozen too! I love the colors, they're easy to make and I will definitely use this dough without the reese's pieces if I just want a chocolate cookie recipe. Yum, yum, yum!

These were sooo good! I made them for a Halloween party and they were gone in less than an hour. My one friend ate five cookies!

These were ok. The cookie flavor was just ok. Don't think I will be making again. They looked very appealing once made

I changed the chocolate and instead used caramel on one side and chocolate on the other.

These are definitely a keeper! I made them for Valentine's Day and used pink/red colored M&M's. I also put some of the batter in my mini muffin tin, and served them without the added topping.

I bought my husband a huge bag of Reece's pieces for Valentine's Day, and he didn't really eat them much even though they are his favorite. I saw this and figure I'd try it.    Best. Decision. Ever. Delicious, and soft!
