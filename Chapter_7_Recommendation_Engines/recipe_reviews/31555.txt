Very nice and tasty! Sure seems like alot of squash, but it cooks down nicely. I would definately recommend using a 9x13 pan as what I considered a "medium" baking dish wouldn't hold it. And I chopped my (2 kinds) of squash pretty small as someone recommended. My family all loved it and we aren't big squash eaters especially. Had wonderful flavor and texture, nice comfort food. Pretty easy to make too! I've saved it to my recipe box - it'll be one of my regulars, especially for a crowd!

Let me say....AWESOME RECIPE...My boyfriend's mother had extra squash that people at church gave her and she gave me some. I just cut up 3-4 and used exact measurments, was not oily at all. I have made this 4 times already this summer, and close to one of the best recipes on this site!!!!!!!!

I would recommend insteads of just chopping the squash to FINELY chop the squash and also use herb stuffing mix.  The recipe itself is great with a wonderful flavor but the squash needs to be finely chopped.  This is from a person who does not like squash and my 4 yr old loved it.

My SIL made this recipe for our Thanksgiving meal. She altered the recipe to include Ritz crackers instead of saltine crackers. It gave it a richer taste and was absolutely to die for. A must have recipe for holiday meals.

ONe of the reviews stated this was dry and blah.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  This is a delicious moist and yummy casserole.

ONe tip is to put a lid on  your pan when you are cooking the squash and onions together.  This keeps the moisture in the pan.  Just be careful not to leave too much juice as your casserole can be runny.  I would cook the first half with a lid on and then remove the lid so some of the liquid evaporates into the air.  Then add your cheese, etc.  If for some reason it may seem to runny after you have added cheese and other ingredients a few extra crackers will help. ( I used ritz crackers)

Also baking with or without a cover makes a difference in the crunchiness of your topping and the dryness of your casserole.  I actually added a little bit of water to my stuffing along with the butter to make it a tiny bit moist.  Don't add too much though, just a tablespoon or so.

Anyhow, I encourage you to make it, and pay attention to these things, then the 2nd time you make it will be perfect.  The flavor is always great!

Outstanding, and the rave reviews are a testament to that. A couple minor alterations: 16 reduced fat Ritz crackers replacing 12 saltine crackers and used herb seasoned stuffing. Nicely filled a 9” x 13” (3 qt.) baking dish (lightly sprayed w/ olive oil). Lightly sprayed saucepan w/ olive oil rather than using butter when cooking the squash and onions. In further reducing the overall 10 tablespoons of butter in this casserole, only used 3 tablespoons to make the stuffing crust . . . don’t think a noticeable taste difference resulted. Used a pinch of salt to cut down on high sodium level for a relatively small sized serving (i.e., roughly 3” x 4” size). For special occasions, I would make this recipe the same way again. If part of an everyday meal, the aim would be to make a healthier version . . . experiment w/ using 2/3 cup light ranch dressing & 1/3 cup mayo rather than 1 cup mayo. This is one of the most delicious vegetable casseroles we’ve found on this site. Thanks, NANCD35.

This is a great squash recipe. I just had to double the amount of cheese. I couldnt help myself.  Great texture and flavor. This one is a real winner.

Even my hubby (who says he doesn't like yellow squash) liked this one! I used "butter buds" instead of butter in the squash so I could add bacon with the other ingredients. I did use the butter in the topping though...a girl is only willing to sacrifice so much!

The ranch and chedder add too much whang, doesn't leave much for the buttery flavor of squash.  Too much bread for topping. From an avid squash over-planter.

This stuff is delicious! I made it exactly by the recipe and my boyfriend and I ate more of it late at night and even the next morning. We could not get enough! Yum...I'm thinking I may want some more tonight!

Boy, did this take me back! Many years ago, in desparation during a squash "explosion" in my garden I created a similar dish. Think I may have used Italian dressing mix for the base instead of ranch. Try it for a twist!

Great flavor!! I made a huge pan of this for Thanksgiving and I think every member of the family complimented me on the dish. My husband and I could not stop eating it and he requested more less than a week later. I have a pan in the oven right now but I made it with slightly boiled potatoes this time. I'm positive it will taste as good as it smells.

This was OK. If I try it again, I would probably add more cheese and use butter crackers on the top instead of stuffing.

I have made this many times and we love it. I have used some zuchinni if my garden is short on yellow squash which  also works.  At times I freeze some to use later.

This recipe is amazing!  Wish I could give it 1,000 stars.  I used both yellow and green squash as that is what I had, 1 entire sleeve of Keebler Town House butter crackers instead of saltines and added 6 slices of chopped, crisp cooked bacon I had in the fridge.  Also used herb seasoned stuffing as that is what I had on hand.  I used the food processor to thinly slice the squash...took no time at all and the sliced squash cooked up perfect.  I baked it all in a 9" x 13" casserole.  Next time I'm thinking of adding 1 cup more stuffing as that is what took it over the top in my opinion.  And there will be many more next times!

Wonderful recipe!  I made this for Easter dinner and everyone loved it.... even those who said they didn't like squash!  I made 2 small changes... I only used 2 eggs, and I used Ritz crackers instead of saltines.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

This is a great 'comfort food' recipe, as others have said. This isn't a dish I would call healthy, though.  Sad to have that much beautiful, healthy squash drowned out by so much fat and calorie laden goodness. Just a normal portion made me feel worse after the meal than a typical veggie dish. Use with caution. It is definitely tasty, just not healthy...

Very similar to a recipe my mom used to make......but dare I say it - even better!  Fall comfort in a dish! Thanks to our over zealous garden I used zucchini and yellow squash.  Mixed white sharp cheddar, parmesan and cheddar for the cheese; used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo; added chopped chicken and omitted the salt (thank goodness! or it would have been far too salty).  I used herb stuffing for top; next time I think I would a third less of the ranch mix.

I started making this recipe and at the last minute I decided to omit the egg (I didn't think it needed any) and the ranch/mayo.  I added a can of diced tomatoes with the juice.  It was a little more italian style but everyone loved it.  Thank you.

I thought this squash was very very good.  The only reason I did not give it a 5 start is because it didn't convince my non squash eaters that squash is good but the ones who like squash said it was the best they had ever had.  The only thing I changed was I used ritz crackers instead of saltines.

This was a huge hit at the potluck I went to last night.  Everyone loved it, to include my husband who claims he doesn't like squash!  He went back for seconds!  Didn't change anything in the recipe.  Great just as written.  I am however going to try it with broccoli next.

Great recipe! I have made this several times and every time I do I always get lots of approval. I did not have any Ranch dressing mix but it was still great without it. This will be a keeper!

Wonderful comfort food!  I did not have any yellow squash, but I did have a ginormous green zucchini from a friend's garden.  Worked perfectly.

This was dry and blah.  I expected a lot more, given that a lot of my favorite things (squash, ranch dressing, cheese, and stuffing) are in it.  If you want to make this recipe, moisten the stuffing slightly with water prior to baking, add at least 1/4 cup of milk to the squash itself, and cover to keep stuffing from drying out while squash is getting tender.

Love this recipe.  I did make a few changes and substituted here and there. Instead of mayo I used vegenaise and instead of ranch I used a dried buttermilk ranch mix.  I only used 1 egg, instead of the 3 listed.  I also mixed all the ingredients after cooking the squash and onions and then topped the whole mixture with the melted butter and finally the mix.  I am getting ready to make this again, love this recipe.  Thank you.

Fantastic! I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand so I used what I had and it STILL turned out awesome. My 5 year old had 2 servings and my wife said it was one of the best side dishes I had made in a long time - and I do all the cooking in our house. I used Miracle Whip in place of the Mayo, and subbed a packet of dry Onion Soup mix in place of the ranch mix. This is now in the recipe box and has become a new family favorite!

I think that 3 eggs was a bit much for this recipe.  The flavor was good but seemed more like a breakfast food then a dinner side dish.  I will make again but cut it back to 2 eggs.

Really good recipe!  I made it for Christmas and everyone liked it!  I used dry minced onion (about 1/4 C.) instead of chopping the two onions, and used some of the stuffing mix instead of the saltines.  My store didn't have a great selection of squash, so I used half squash and half zucchini...very good!

Wow! Everyone loved it.  I halved the recipe, to six servings, used a buttered 8x8, 2 eggs (it was great - souffle-like).  I did change one thing - I had a premixed stuffing/seasoning packet, so I just prepared that according to the directions on the package, fluffed it and sprinkled the fully prepared stuffing on top of the casserole.  It was incredible, we loved the way the flavors blended.  My dad requested it be added to our holiday table.  Thank you.

Cooking for vegetarian so skipped the stuffing and use ground crackers and palenko bread crumbs, also substituted zucchini for the yellow squash.  Very tasty

I've done a variation of this recipe.  No mayo.  I used crushed up corn tortilla chips instead of crackers. Used dried herbs, probably the Italian blend I bought at the Amish store.  I didn't use stuffing mix.  Probably used about double the cheddar cheese.  It's especially good with the sharpest cheddar you can find OR baby swiss :)

This is great. I lightened it a bit by using a little olive oil to cook the veggies, light mayonnaise, 2 eggs and only 4 tablespoons of butter in the stuffing mix. It was still rich with nice texture and I definitely recommend these changes.

Shredded the squash and onion in cuisinart. Drain excess water. Cook veg in microwave. No butter, just salt and pepper. Low fat ritz instead of saltines. Only half cup mayo and 2 eggs. Savory herb stuffing mixed w/cheese, no butter. Light, fluffy, delicious.  Whole family loved.

I was not a big fan.  Tha flavor was good, but it was so heavy. After several bites, all I could taste was the mayo.   I even used low fat cheese and mayo and it was still too heavy.  Pass.

I have made this recipe many times and always get raves and recipe requests.  I sliced and roasted the squash and onions in the oven instead of using the stovetop.  Use butter or olive oil and season with seasoned salt if desired.  It is much easier and you don't have to keep stirring it.  Everything else is the same.

I made this for dinner last night. There isn't any left! I changed just a few things because I didn't have time to run to the store. Instead of the crackers, I used the leftover stuffing (cornbread), instead of dry ranch mix, I used dressing and my husband and boys all love cheese so I added 2 cups instead of one. What a fantastic dish! I have a request from our 6 yr old to make it again tomorrow!

This was always something that was around at get togethers in North Carolina. Now that I'm living in Washington State, I wanted something that told a story about me for a church picnic we had this summer. I brought this dish and a dump cake. I did end up having some leftovers but squash isn't for everyone. ;-)

I have been looking for a different squash casserole than the one I have been making for years & this fit the bill. Changes made (not many) used egg beaters instead (to equal 2 eggs), used crushed pretzels instead of saltines and used jalapeno ranch mix instead of regular. Also added more spices to season (pepper, garlic). Will be making this one again. Thanks.

Very good Squash dish!  Comes out almost like a souffle - would be wonderful for Thanksgiving or a Brunch - as the kids thought it tasted a bit like a Breakfast Casserole.  Will make this again, esp. for a crowd.  (Didn't have Ranch Dressing Mix on hand - so followed the recipe for "Dry Ranch Style Seasoning for Dip or Dressing" on this site and added Dill Weed to it.  Fabulous!)

I had a lot of squash that I was given and wanted to do something new with it.  This is a great recipe with a different taste from traditional squash casseroles.  I recommend cutting the squash into small pieces, otherwise it will take a very long cooking time for it to get soft.  Not a low-cal dish, but a very good one regardless.

This recipe is not very good. It looks tasty, so I tried it. Followed the recipe to the letter.  Maybe I should have peeled the squash? I really don't think that would have helped but I'm trying to give it the benefit of the doubt.

As of today I've made this twice! It is an easy way to use a lot of my squash from the garden! It was absolutely delicious too! The stuffing topping is so yummy and makes the kitchen smell so good! I too used a 9X13 pan as others have mentioned. It does make a lot but reheats nicely! Will use again and recommend to others!

Unfortunately I thought this was pretty bland.  Maybe I should have doubled the ranch dressing mix?  I'll try that next time.  I will say that it was better reheated than it was right out of the oven - maybe it needed time to meld the flavors?

Tried this tonight....it was amazing.  I just made a couple additions:  I used a mix of green & yellow squash. And I browned up a pound of ground pork.  Next time I will grind up and brown some hot sausage.  When I put it in the oven I put it in a casserole dish and cooked it for about  30 minutes.

It was very delicious.

My new favorite squash recipe! I followed the recipe for the most part, but I added a handful of bacon bits to the squash mix, doubled the cheese and added extra pepper. I didn't have any stuffing on hand, so I topped it with a layer of crushed Ritz crackers and butter coated Panko bread crumbs for some crunch. OH MY.. is this good ~ even my picky teenagers went in for a second helping. Definitely a keeper!

Excellent! I shredded the squash and used 2 cups of extra sharp cheddar. Next time, I'll shred some boiled or grilled chicken or ground turkey. It's hard to characterize, creamy, but I can see serving this at Thanksgiving dinner. I tenderized the onions and squash for 30 mins.  I had exactly 3 pounds of summer squash in my garden. Perfect.

I made this as the veggie for my Father's birthday dinner & it was a huge hit. Fits perfectly in a 9 x 13 baking dish. The only complaint I had was it was too "scrambled eggy" for dinner. The second time I tried only 2 eggs and adding an extra 1/2 cup of cheese. This worked perfectly & was devoured by our nephews (12 & 17), the whole batch was gone after one meal with the 4 of us. I plan to also try it as a brunch dish using the original recipe & adding diced ham.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it!

Great dish!  Not exactly low-cal, but definitely good!  I used crushed Ritz crackers instead of saltines.  I also didn't have any stuffing mix, so I used crushed Corn Flakes.  I will definitely make again and try the stuffing mix!  Thanks!

This is a fantastic casserole! I wanted to make this a meal and cooked hamburger and the onions together then added the squash.  Used 1/2 C bread crumbs instead of crackers and Herbed stuffing.  Lots of flavor!  I will omit the tsp of salt next time, it was not needed with the Herb stuffing.  Kids loved it.

Delicious.  I used a 9X13 pan and it was perfect.  Not much left over since we all kept going back for "a little more".  The only thing I did differently was to use bread crumbs instead of crushed crackers, because I didn't have the crackers on hand.

Made this a few weeks ago.  I ended up using a box of conrbread stuffing mix that was in the pantry.  Not my favorite flavor to mix in.  However, the dish was dee-lish.  My husband ate most of it in two days.  Since I over planted the squash this summer, we will definitely make this one again.

Very good.  I used zucchini and summer squash.  A good use of a lot of squash.  I froze most of it for lunches later.

This casserole was awesome!!  Even my husband who's not a fan of squash ate at least 1/2 of a 9x13 dish.  I added more cheese and used Clubhouse crackers instead of saltines.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I cut the recipe in half and used zucchini instead of yellow squash.  Eliminated salt because ranch seasoning has enough salt in it already.  Used herb stuffing mix.  It was was really good, will definitely make again.  Would have gave the recipe 5 stars, but since I changed it up, I couldn’t review

Excellent recipe. I have been making this for a few years. I mix zucchini with the summer squash, and add fire roasted tomatoes. I also use the herb stuffing mix and buttery club crackers.

I loved this recipe!  I thought it was really great but I don't mind some squash.  My husband doesn't like squash at all but said it didn't have too much "squashy" taste.  He said it tasted more like Thanksgiving stuffing!  I will keep this and make it again. ( Although I'll probably make it smaller for just me!!)

Made it as written other than using half yellow, half zucchini. My two kids really liked it, even more so by my non-vegetable fan. I generally like to keep my veggies simple, but I bought a ton of squash on sale at a great price and was looking for something to do with a large quantity, and this worked great. I think this is a perfect dish for a potluck or holiday meal. The flavor and consistency were both appealing, and I guess it looked good too especially with two colors of squash. I can't see subbing the saltines out in favor of fatty crackers, it doesn't need that at all.

This taste good but I wish it didn't have the scrambled egg texture. I halved the recipe since my yellow squash weighed about 1 1/2 pounds vs the 3 pounds in the recipe; only used 2 eggs. 1/2 recipe made 6 servings. I will make it again.

Wow, this is good!  The only change I made was sour cream because I was out of mayo.

This is a hit, and my garden is producing a lot of squash.

This was a great way to use up a squash. Very flavourful. Next time I'll be looking to reduce the sodium, but otherwise a great recipe.

A very tasty recipe for squash.  The only thing I would do different the next time, is chop the squash smaller than I did so it cooked a little faster.  I didn't have 3 lbs  of yellow squash so I cut the recipe in half.  It made enough for 6 large side dish helpings.

I have made this 4 times this summer and it is a big hit!  The only changes were that I used whatever squash I had from the garden at the time ( yellow, zucchini, Piddy Paddle, etc) and that I used Panko bread crumbs instead of the stuffing mix. Panklo makes it super crispy and delicious.

Omg this is so good!!  I don't measure too often but I did  with this recipe. After I was half way into the recipe I realized that I did not have a ranch seasoning packet or stuffing.  I mixed 1/3 cup of light ranch dressing in with the other ingredients.

We were given a LOT of squash by a friend so I started looking for a recipe that required a LOT of squash and this one fit the bill. I made a few alterations (added a few slices of bacon, cut back on the butter, herb stuffing mix, etc.) and it turned out great! I'll definitely make this recipe again if I end up with a bunch of squash again in the future.

I made this for my husband who doesn't like squash. I'm sure the eggs and cheese and mayo and ranch dressing probably negated any nutritional aspect of the squash but it was soooooo yummy!!

Outstanding recipe.  I have made it for company several times and is always a hit.  Some slight changes.  I substituted prepared ranch dressing for the mayo and ranch dressing mix.  Also I substituted garlic salt for the plain salt.  I let the squash/onion cooked mix cool slightly before adding the egg mixture so that it wouldn't solidify before putting in the oven.  This results in a more homogeneous final product.

I made this for Thanksgiving with extra squash I had leftover. VERY different flavor and will make again. I used an acorn and butternut squash cut into 1/2" pieces. For next time I'll probably use half the amount of cheese, it was a little much.

Used the servings icon to split the recipe in half.  Used a 8x8 glass baking dish and the same cooking time & temp.  It came out perfect!  Served it with Country Style Ribs - made a great meal for 2.

Everyone loves this recipe, I would give it 10 stars, if I could. I did make a minor change. I omitted the crackers and mixed the dressing into the squash mixture, instead of baking it on top.  So, that it does not have a crunchy top, for the people that don't like crunchy food. Other than that, I made exactly per the recipe and will make again, and again.  I did increase the baking time a little, until the top was turning a golden brown. Great recipe.

I prepared this dish with mini meat loaves and will make it again.  I forgot to add the 12 saltines but found I did not really need them.  Good consistency, flavor, he doesn't usually like squash but had 2 helpings!  Leftovers in the microwave for breakfast.  Thank you.

Definitely a keeper. I didn't use 2 onions I thought that was too much. And I used a whole box of stuffing. Cause in my eyes there is never enough. Super easy and quick enough.

Super Yummy and flavorful, but little on the salty side.  1/2 or remove all the salt next time.  My husband who doesn't like mayo didn't know it was in there!!  I will definitely do this recipe again!

I made this for Christmas and everyone loved it. I only changed the serving size and adjusted the amounts to fit this modification. Will make again for sure. So much better than having to add the sour cream and soups. Much lighter. Thank you for the recipe.

This was a rockin' meal ! I did a few little changes, I just used all zucchini, a red onion...I used ritz crackers in the place of plain crackers and a light buffalo ranch dressing in place of mayo. I still used the dry ranch. You can go wrong with fixing this meal.

This is soooo good! I made it exactly as described and it was fantastic! I also have made it by subbing some green tomatoes for the squash about half yellow squash and half green tomatoes both thinly sliced.... like fried green tomatoes and squash only baked! I have made this over and over again we all love it in my home.

One of my favorite squash or zucchini recipes. First time I used Stove Top, the second time I used regular bread mix. Stove Top is the best, the herb flavor one. And reduce the ranch mix slightly. My brother requests this to all the time.

As a child I really didn't like squash until my friend's mom made a dish that was just like this and it was so good!  I was so happy when I came across this recipe.  Eating it was just like being in Barb's kitchen all over again.  I used all yellow squash for it, no zucchini.

I have lots of squash from the garden.  Tried this and love it, it will be a favorite.  Used ritz vs saltines because that's what I had.

I must absolutely give this 5 stars. Before we put it in the oven, we tasted it and thought, "Yeah, this is okay." After the oven? Oh, my goodness! We can't stop eating it! I used a combo of yellow and green squash and the ONLY other things I did differently was to use a seasoned stuffing mix (store brand Stove Top - chicken flavor) and I only added one onion (but it was a BIG onion). Served this tonight with a roasted chicken, but I think the casserole was the star!

I really liked this.  It does make a lot, but it is great as left overs.  Dice the squash into a fine dice, increase Ritz crackers to 16+ (to counter the liquid from the squash), use herb stuffing, and I added a cup of frozen corn for texture, next time will also add some celery.   I used the dry Ranch Dressing mix from this site instead of commercial package.

The best squash casserole I've ever tasted - better than Boston Market's.  The 'sharp' cheddar is what gave it that little zip.  I tweaked it with Hi Ho Crackers instead of saltine and I didn't use any salt.  And since I didn't have any stuffing mix on hand, I used toasted hot dog buns, cubed.  My hubby loved it!

I have ate many a squash casserole in my day but never made one.  This one was simple to make and turned out great! I only used 1/2 cup mayo (its all I had) and it still turned out great.  My 2 & 4 year olds were fighting for bites off my plate.  I will be making this again!

I thought it was excellent.  I didn't have gluten free stuffing mix, so I toasted 5 gluten free pieces of bread and mixed them with a little bit of sage, rosemary and thyme.  Very good!

Absolutely the most wonderful squash casserole I have had.  Used townhouse crackers with the butter for the topping and also added green, yellow and red peppers to the squash.

Excellent dinner!   We added garlic, chopped and extra pepper.  It turned our beautifully in our 9/12 pan.   Thought I'd skip the breadcrumbs on top but so glad I didn't.  They really made it delicious.  The eggs added the needed "fluffiness"  and we LOVE cheese so this was right up our alley!  Will be trying it again soon as the garden is producing pounds of the squash!

We host several families per week on a regular basis and this recipe is always a huge hit.  I have had to make photocopies of this recipe because everyone is leaving with a copy of it!  

Here are my adaptations:
I use 2 TBSP of coconut oil instead of the butter to fry the squash & onion and does it ever add a nice flavour!  Instead of saltine crackers, I use 1 cup of coarsely crushed gluten-free corn flakes.  I use 1/4 cup of ranch dressing vs the ranch seasoning package.  I also mix the butter/stuffing mixture right in for a much better blending of flavours and textures.  A family favourite!

Amazing recipe!  I cooked this for my boyfriend and he loved it so much, I left the whole pan at his house.  All day, he couldn't wait until he got home to eat some more of it.  However, once he got home, he realized his 19 year old son had come home and finished off the entire pan!  He was devastated.  I promised him I would make it for him again this weekend.  I doubled the cheese and added garlic just because I add garlic to everything!

this is our new favorite squash casserole...  made just a few changes ... used crushed Ritz crackers instead of saltines and instead of the dry bread stuffing mix.  Unbelievably good!

YUMMY! This was a great way to use up all that extra garden squash. Even if you don't like veggies, you will like this. I would chop the squash smaller and make the stuffing mix up to spread on the top, super dish!

I have to admit my family is not a "squash" eating family, but after trying this recipe they're hooked!  Not only is it easy to prepare but it tastes delicious and leftovers aren't a concern because they dishes were licked clean!

WOW! Awesome recipe! 

I made this for a large Thanksgiving potluck party my friends had, and it was a HUGE hit. I am a cheese freak, so I added a little more cheese, but that was the only change. The ranch seasoning tastes great. I love this recipe, and I will definitely use it again!

I just served this to a group of 10.  this was the second time I made this recipe.  The first time I halved it - which worked great - this time I made it for 12.  Excellent.  2 friends that don't like squash loved it.  Big hit!
