This was my first time using bison, which I've decided to start using because bison do not carry BSE or similar diseases. I must admit that I didn't have all the ingredients available for this recipe, so I used 1 lb. ground bison and 1/2 lb. veggie sausage. I also didn't have onion soup mix, but I did have meatloaf seasoning, and used that. Finally, I made my own quick bleu cheese dressing. The results were very good -- very moist and tender, with lots of flavor from the added ingredients. I'm looking forward to trying this recipe again with the onion soup and ground turkey, though I would stick to the 2:1 bison-to-turkey ratio for added body and compatibility with bleu cheese.

This is absolutely divine! Thank you, thank you, thank you, JD! I didn't like the soup mix all that much, so I substituted with a plain ol' Vidalia onion, minced. And it was scrumptious, and the buffalo adds a bit of exotica to it. My mom was surprised when I told her that she'd just eaten one of those enormous animals that, up until then, she'd only seen on the back of a nickle!   t.

i made this w/1-lb buffalo, 1/2-lb turkey, and left out the dill dip. i used 1-1/2cups breadcrumbs. even my dad and uncle, both rather fussy, gave it rave reviews! (just be sure to really mix the meats together well.)

I picked this recipe because it's one of only a few bison recipes on this site. And don't get me wrong, it wasn't BAD, but the flavor was very much like sausage. If you like sausage, then this is probably awesome! But neither my husband or myself care for that flavor too much.

This was pretty good.  I thought the ingredients were weird but it was fine.  I think my own meatloaf ingredients would have been better with it.

Very yummy. To cut the calories, I found a lite Greek yogurt blue cheese dressing and made my own dill dressing with Greek non fat yogurt - used fresh parm so I didnt need as much.. It was tasty. Different from the usual ketchup type loaf
