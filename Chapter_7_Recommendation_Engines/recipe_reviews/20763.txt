This was really good.  I added an extra tbsp of olive oil and used a little less black pepper and added some red pepper flakes.  I also marinated the steak for about 30 min before grilling.  It was very tender.

This steak definitely has to marinate for several hours before it would be tender.  I also used some canadian steak seasoning and paprika for flavor.  This is also good for chuck steak.  When I grill these types of steaks I cook them only to medium rare, otherwise they tend to be tough.  This is a great low carb and lower price steak that will taste like the high priced steak if it's treated right.  We had no problem with it and the flavor was delicious.

This is a great recipe, I put the olive oil, garlic and pepper (I add some salt to that mixture) on a couple of hours before grilling.  I serve the steaks with an herbed butter poured over them (melted butter, fresh basil, fresh thyme)

I'm sorry, but this had no flavor. This would probably be good combined with a marinade, but alone it's pretty bland.

Way to much pepper but other than that the flavor was amazing! I added a 1/2 cup soy sauce, 2 more cloves of garlic, 1 tsp of garlic power, 1 tsp of onion powder, and 2 sliced onions. I marinated the steak for 6 hours. This recipe is very very delicious. Next time I will only add a 1/2 tsp of pepper. Thanks!

A fast easy recipe to use in the hot weather if you live anyplace but the deep south. Here we Bar b que/grill all year round. This for us is a good alternative to using a stove and heating up the house. 

It is fast, and I added  vegetable medly of bell pepper, onion, carrots, and fresh green beans, grilled at the same time, on the grill.

For the medley prepare fresh veggies, place on foil or on a skewer, Either brush a mixture of olive oil, garlic and onion powder, salt and pepper to taste, or drizzle over if using a foil dish, and grill till done to taste.

If you're expecting an explosion of flavor other than beef, you'll probably be left wanting. This is a very good basic recipe, but for those of us left wanting more flavor to our steaks, marinate the steaks using this recipe, plus two more cloves of crushed garlic, 1 teaspoon garlic powder and 1/2c soy sauce. I use Top Loin (New Yorks) or Sirloins.This is very yummy.

I thought this was very bland. I was expecting a lot more flavor. Next time I will try a marinade. Thankfully it did no harm to the steaks but I was really looking forward to a garlicky flavor. I used sirloin tip steak for this recipe.

This was good.  I did marinate the meat for about 4 hours before grilling.  Didn't think it would be tender if I didn't.  Thanks for the post.

Very bland. Put them on the grill & the smell was wonderful, but the taste was lacking.

This was good, but a little too peppery for my children.  All I had to do was rinse some of the pepper off for them.  Next time I make it, and there will be a next time, I will simply cut the pepper in half

Thought this was lacking in flavor though I added seasoning salt and thyme. My husband thought it was great, however, so I guess that is what matters. Used on ribeyes.

So easy, and so delicious - perfect for when you don't have time to marinate! I used an extra Tbsp. of olive oil and cut the amount of black pepper in half (personal preference) and added a bit of kosher salt to the mix. I used this on NY strips and let them sit for 30 minutes before grilling. The steaks came out moist and tender!

After reading other reviews I decided to marinate first to liven this up. I made two batches of this rub, but to one of them I added some additional olive oil and 2 Tbsp of red wine vinegar and a heaping tsp of whole black peppercorns. I used 3 thinly sliced ribeye steaks and let them marinate at room temp for about four hours. Then right before grilling I used the remaining rub as directed. My steaks turned out tender and flavorful. I will use this recipe again.
