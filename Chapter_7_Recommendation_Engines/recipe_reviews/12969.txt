Awesome! My family loves hearty soups, so I made a few changes and additions. I didn't have onion, so I added some dry onion soup mix to the meatballs. I also added some worcestershire sauce to the meatballs and a few dashes to the soup. I used about 3 cups of water and one Tbsp. of beef bouillon (equal to about 3 cubes, I think) to make the soup. I also added a can of diced tomatoes and a half cup of rice. I waited until the very end to add the low-sodium cream of mushroom soup. Everyone in my family raved, even my picky 4 year old! My two year old even ate a whole bowl and my 6 year old had three helpings! This one is a real keeper!

This is an excellent soup!  It’s very hearty, tasty and low in fat.  I did tweak it a bit to add a little more flavor and reduce the fat even more…  First, I used about ½ cup minced onion and about 2 tbs. fresh minced garlic in the meatballs.  Second, there is no need to cook the meatballs in oil if you have a good non-stick pan.  And finally I used non-fat chicken stock and non-fat cream of mushroom soup.  This is excellent and I will definitely be making it again!

This soup was very good.  I added onion soup mix in addition to two bouillon cubes, and added a teaspoon of worcestshire sauce to give it a little added kick.  I also used less carrots and celery than the recipe called for, with no sacrifice in flavor.  This is a keeper recipe.

What a yummy soup! Instead of making meatballs I omitted the egg and just crumbled the meat. I also used chicken stock instead of beef and the mushroom soup that I used was "Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic". It was very salty but had great flavor. I served it with homemade garlic dinner rolls and waldorf salad. It was a perfect meal for a very rainy day. Update 2008: I added an extra can of beef broth and half a box of rotini noodles and made it like a stew. Still tastes great and is a nice variation.

Very good and hearty soup.  I improvised a bit by adding worcheshire sauce and parsley flakes to the meatballs, and more wocheshire sauce, an extra bouilon cube, and a dash of sherry to the soup.  I also simmered the soup covered to hold in some of the liquid and make it "soupier".  It turned out fantastic.  We can not wait to finish it up tomorrow night.

Didn't taste bad, but not one of my favorites.  Unappealing to look at.  The mushroom soup gives it a gray color.  If it weren't for the vegetables, you'd think it was pet food.  I had to double the soup and water because it wasn't enough broth.  Won't make this again.

This was delicious with some changes and additions. I added bread crumbs and garlic to the meatballs and cut back on the onions overall. Added an extra cup of broth, half the carrots, and a few handfuls of pasta. Tasted great!

Very good! Like a few others.. I cheated. I used frozen meatballs, beef broth, I doubled most ingredients and played around with the spices.. we ate sandwiches with ours which was ALOT, but on a cold night like tonight (22 degrees) I wanted to fill everyones tummy. Would recommend/ make again :)

I was dissappointed with this recipe.  First I had a hard time keeping my meatballs from falling apart in the skillet.  I think I would opt to bake them in the oven on a parchment lined baking sheet.  Second, I didn't think there was enough liquid to cook the veggies and finish the meatballs.  My soup had thickened too much and the bottom started to burn before the meatballs were cooked all the way through and the veggies were still crunchy even with the heat on the lowest setting.  I decided to add more chicken broth to thin out the soup and simmer the meatballs and veggies until done.  I did make one substitution since I did not have any corn.  I used a little frozen chopped spinach which made the soup more like an Italian wedding style soup.  I would recommend this addition/ substitution for anyone who plans on making this again (which I do not).

This was delicious. I made it the first time according to directions. Second time made adjustments which added good clean POP to recipe. I used 4 beef boullions and 4 cups water to the broth while it simmered. I also used 2 ears of fresh corn kernels instead of the canned. Great!!

To ease the cooking process, I baked the meatballs at 375F for 20 minutes.  I found it was a little bland... I might try adding the Worcestershire sauce next time as suggested by other reviewers.   That being said it is a great soup for picky eaters.

The flavor wasn't horrible but it wasn't up my alley either. I can't exactly put my finger on it but something was off. Another person mentioned the "look" not being appealing and I agree. The meatballs themselves though were delicious! I loved the flavor they possessed. I used ground turkey and ground pork!! I will definitely make the meatballs again!

Very good recipe!!  Delicious soup - I ended up cooking it in the crockpot all day and using beef broth instead of water & boullion, and it worked great.  I would have preferred it a little thicker (more stew like which I was surprised it didn't become in the crockpot), so next time I'd thicken it up.  But otherwise - we ate well tonight!

This was so great!  My boyfriend absolutely loved this and he can't wait to eat it again tonight b/c he thinks it'll be even better after the flavors have a chance to marry!  I definitely recommend prepping all the veges before you start cooking!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This was really quite good.  I did add a packet of Lipton onion soup mix to meatball mixture, but the rest was done according to the recipe.  My family thinks it is a keeper.

Great recipe!  I used lipton beefy onion soup mix instead of the bouillion, and then omitted the onion, and it tured out wonderful!.  Also, instead of serving it as a soup, I served it over rice. (My husband hates soup, so I disguised it as a "stew"... and it worked!)  Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper.

I had a pound of ground turkey and was looking for a soup to make. I incorporated many of the previous suggestions. For the meatballs,I sauteed 1/2 cup of sweet onion with two large cloves of minced garlic in one teaspoon of olive oil in a non-stick pan until soft and let cool a couple of minutes. To the ground turkey I mixed in the egg a 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4+ teaspoon of ground black pepper, and the cooled onion and garlic. I used the same pan and browned the meatballs.The meatballs are very soft so I used a small scoop to drop them into the pan. I made the original recipe and added a few extras. I don't like the saltiness of bouillon so I used two 32 oz beef broth containers and two cans of cream of mushroom soup. I chopped six carrots and four celery stalks including the heart. I used one whole sweet onion and briefly sauteed them all before I added the beef broth.  To the pan that I fried the meatballs in I added 1/4 cup sherry and about half a cup of the beef broth and deglazed the pan and added it to the sauteed veggies. I then added the meatballs, the beef broth, and a couple of good dashes of Worcestershire sauce and let it simmer for a about an hour. I added the mushroom soup and 2 cups of frozen corn and let that simmer for another 30 minutes. I served the soup with cornbread croutons and a little chopped fresh scallion. I think that I will serve it over a little cooked rice next time. I like to cook the rice separately so it doesn't fall apart in the soup.

When my hubby tells me something is CHOW, thats my way of knowing this meal is extra special and that I better make it again.. The only thing I did different was to add a can of campbells beef consomme in addition to the boullion cubes. I also made it in the crock pot! It was so good that HE printed it out for me...Definately a keeper!! Thanks!

This was excellent.  I modified recipe, instead of boullion & water, added 2 cans sodium free beef broth.  Added 6 crushed saltines to meat mixture, and added fresh corn instead of canned,  and ate this for 3 days, Wow!

Pretty good, even when reheated the next day.  I did double the amount of creamed soup and did use canned chicken broth instead of the beef boullion.  Also, cooked the meatballs right in the soup and added uncooked rice to the soup as it was cooking.

I would consider this recipe about four and a half stars after making a few changes.  I added some panko bread crumbs to the meatball mixture to get it to bind a little better (was a little too sticky to work with at first).  I also just added separately sea salt and garlic powder.  Instead of using canned cream soup, which is loaded with chemicals and preservatives and not very healthy, I used half and half in it's place.  I first sauteed all the veggies (with some sea salt and fresh cracked black pepper) along with some baby bella mushrooms and then added about a cup and a quarter of natural beef stock (instead of beef bullion), about 2/3 C. of half and half, and about another quarter cup of water with about 2 heaping Tbsp. of whole wheat flour to thicken it up.  I then stirred in the meatballs and allowed to simmer for about 25 minutes.  At the end I added some cooked brown rice and allowed it to simmer a bit longer.  It came out very thick and delicious and also very comforting without being too unhealthy.  I do agree with a few others that it doesn't look very appealing, kinda grayish, but it does taste very good once a little tweaking is done.  I imagine this could also simmer in a crock pot all day and get thickened up at the end.

Easy to make, healthy and yummy! This is a great soup if you're calorie conscious. I didn't have celery, but I added some chopped up kale for extra vitamin goodness. I also used a can of beef broth, and worchestshire sauce in the meatballs and the soup. I'm cooking for one (love the leftovers!) so I don't think I really needed a full pound of turkey. Maybe 1/2 to 3/4 of a pound. But I definitely recommend this recipe!!

My teenage boys ask for this soup again and again.  I mix up the meatballs and bake them at 400 degrees (around 15 minutes to golden brown) while I assemble the soup ingredients and then just add the meatballs.  Freezes great too!

This was decent. The turkey meatballs turned out GREAT; very yummy. I didn't care so much for the corn in the recipe, next time I will leave it out. The sauce was excellent - creamy and thick. It's not so much a soup as it is a stew.

This recipe saved the day when I had unexpected company for lunch after a cold and wet trail ride.  I used frozen beef meatballs and cooked the raw veggies in the microwave to speed up my cooking time.  It was a definite hit and all of my guests asked to take the recipe home with them.

You can substitute the ground turkey with ground beef and use a chicken bouillon cube instead.  It tastes just as good!!!

Maybe I did somthing wrong, bit I really didn't enjoy this at all. I did cook it in the slowcooker and used ground chicken instead of ground turkey (since that's what I had in my freezer). But those were the only changes I made, and there was just something off about the flavor. I'm surprised, too, because I usually agree with most of the reviews on this site (and this recipe recieved a lot of rave reviews). I won't be trying it again.

I added 3/4 cup of rice and an extra cup of water and cooked covered.  I also omitted the celery (didn't have any) and corn (don't care for it) and used half of the onion in the recipe.  It turned out like meatballs in a thick sauce.  Wonderful, but not a soup.  Next time, I'll use the celery and maybe add frozen peas and more water.

This recipe was easy to make and tasted even better.  My entire family enjoyed this soup.  Next time, however, I'll make it with more broth because we had it with cornbread and needed more broth.

I thought this soup was ok and I liked it the best out of my family.  I realized after eating this that we're just not that into meatball soup.  But it's not a bad recipe, just didn't excite us.

This recipe is fantastic!  I had never made meatballs before but other than being quite sticky, they turned out great.  I added an extra cup of beef stock as the liquid seemed too thick and substituted mushrooms for celery.  Definitely try this; it's very, very good and very easy too!

I made some changes to the volume of ingredients; tripled the water, doubled the CofM soup, added 1 cup chicken broth instead of beef and a splash of milk. 
A sprig of Rosemary simmered with the vegetables and broth and I added some cubed potatoes and quickly sauteed some leftover portebello mushrooms in the turkey drippings. Lastly a handful of small pasta noodle varietal for more heartiness. Frozen 'grilled' corn kernels added to the earthiness. 
Added 1.5 tblspns of cornstarch to slightly thicken the broth.

I didn't have any beef bullion cubes so used a can of beef broth instead.  It was good, but to me missing a little something.  will be making again and will likely add a little Worcestershire  to the broth.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

My husband said it's pretty good! I added diced potatoes, a 14 oz. can of tomatoes, 8 oz. of green chile.  Added worcestershire sauce to meatballs & cooked them in a small skillet before adding them to soup.  We enjoyed it. Didn't have any celery, and didn't put any mushroom soup in it.
 Thanks.

Meatballs were yummy, and go well with the soup.  I added lots of extra veggies for nutrition.  I read how some reviewers found that the recipe not soup-ey enough.  So I worked around this by making the dish in a slow cooker.  First, I sauteed the onions and veggies.  I added oil, but I think if you have a good non-stick, it's not necessary.  I threw all the veggies in the slow cooker along with the water and bullion mixture and the cream of mushroom and set it on low for 4-5hrs (depending on how done the veggies were...However,  you definitely want enough cooking time for the flavors to meld).  I then baked the meatballs at 375F for 15-20min.  I could've cut the cooking time down, b/c this fully cooked the meatballs.  I'd rather had finished it in the last 15min of cooking the soup and maybe added more flavor to the soup.  However, it's still pretty tasty just adding the meatballs in long enough to heat through.

This was soooo good.  I made it for a basketball game night when my brother and his family came over.  They ate it all.  I wanted some for leftovers the next day.  I added 8 cups of water to make enough for all of us. I added thinly sliced potatoes to the boiling broth before I added anything else.

I also added rice and green beans to the mixture.  I had to add some extra broth as it wasn't nearly enough liquid by using just what's required in recipe.  Overall, the taste was very good and was hearty enough on a cold night served with warm homemade bread!

This was a good recipe, although it may have been better had I not made the following adjustments.  I didn't have any bullion or stock, so I added a can of undiluted chicken noodle soup in addition to the cream of mushroom soup to enhance the flavor.  I also added corn, peas, onions and tomatoes.  I added extra water to avoid it being too stew-like, per other reviews.  And per another review, I baked the meatballs instead of frying them in the oil to avoid extra calories, which I think is a great suggestion.  The basic recipe is great to go by, you can make your own adjustments as needed.  Thanks!

The jury is still out on whether or not I'd make this again.  I tweaked the meatballs by adding more garlic, red pepper flakes, seasoned salt and chopped cilantro.  They didn't seem "solid" enough, so I also addred bread crumbs.  I used low-salt cream of mushroom, but the consistency was weird.  There didn't seem to be nearly enough liquid, so I added a 14 oz can of beef broth.  Next time I'll use fewer carrots because the sweetness almost overwhelmed the broth.  My husband ate two bowls, but I think he was just hungry.  Again, it wasn't horrible, just OK.  It's a good base on which a really GOOD soup can be made.
