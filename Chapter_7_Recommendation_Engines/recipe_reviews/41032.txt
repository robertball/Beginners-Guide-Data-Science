This is a delicious recipe.  I added 6 ounces of sliced crimini mushrooms to the pepper mixture along with 1 1/2 tablespoons Lawry's Fajita seasoning.  I made the quesadillas on Sundried Tomato tortillas from Trader Joes.  It was a really delicious when served with the 'Black Bean Salsa Soup' recipe from this website.  Thanks!

This is a great food for a small party.  I have served it twice now for gatherings of 10 or 12 people, as one of many finger foods.  Everyone wanted the recipe, and I have been told that some of them have served it since then for their own parties.  It works great when you want to include a low-calorie and vegetarian selection.

These were very good and a nice alternative to cheese quesadillas.  Instead of baking in the oven, I cooked mine on a large electric griddle.  I served them with sour cream and salsa.
