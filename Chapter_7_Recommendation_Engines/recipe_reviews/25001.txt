Being from Germany, I know what the "normal" German cheesecake should taste like.  I found the taste to be close, but it cannot be compared with a cheescake made with Quark instead of cottage cheese.  I also found that the hardest part of making this cake was the "pushing cottage cheese through a sieve."  In the end I found it easier to just throw it into the blender and blend it until smooth.

This is a fine American German Cheesecake. German Cheesecake is not made with grahm crackers but a dough made of flour, butter, egg, sugar, lemon, and vanilla-sugar.  Quark is available or it can be similarly made using cottage cheese with sour cream added and put in a blender to smooth.

I cant say on taste for I don't eat them I just bake them for people. But on baking this for the first time I found it rather a long process since I'm used to the regular cheesecake. I had alot of the batter let over even using a 12" pan, and it cooked like a soufle, unless I did something wrong. I wish it had a picture I could go by.
And unless you know something about cooking this recipe will be hard for you. This recipe took alot longer than 30 min. to prepare.

nice recipe though, German cheesecake does not use graham cracker crumbs- that is NY
German cheesecake has a crust of egg, sugar, flour, and butter.
