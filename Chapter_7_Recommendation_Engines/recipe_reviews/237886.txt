This is a wonderful twist on chicken salad! I did add a touch of mayo to cut the 'blah' of the Greek yogurt, and I had to omit the cheese b/c I had none on hand. I served this on pita w/ some extra cilantro and an extra squirt of lime~YUM! It's a keeper...Thanks for sharing. :)

This was SUPER yummy.  The only thing that could have made it better  would be a clove of garlic. Everyone in my family gobbled it  down, even my  kids who were a little leary at first. We served it over a green salad instead of in pita.

When I cooked the chicken breast I added Weber’s Kick’n Chicken Seasoning. I also doubled the jalapeños and put a double pinch of cumin. We are not coco

Awesome light, refreshing salad.  I also took the advice of other reviewers and added 2 tblsp light mayo. Served over lettuce as well. Delicious!

This is delicious! We couldn't find the cotija cheese where we live in Maine, but we substituted Parmesan cheese, and it worked fine.  Thank you, OK Gal, for a recipe we will make again and again.
