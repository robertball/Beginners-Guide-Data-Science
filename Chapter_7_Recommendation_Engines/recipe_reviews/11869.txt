This salad is the best! I added 1 tablespoon of sugar and an additional can 
of tuna. This is good no matter what time of year. Quick to prepare and looks 
very colorful. Tastes amazing!!!!

This was very satisfying and nice to have on a hot summer night.  I used about 8oz of macaroni, which cooked up to far more than 2 cups.  Next time I'll probably only use 4oz uncooked.  It really made a ton!  I do have to say that if you use less pasta, there will be quite a large amount of dressing.  I did not double the dressing and it covered everything just perfect.  I could not really taste the dill or pepper, so I may add more of each of those.  Also, I added another can of tuna - there was no way 1 can was enough with all that pasta!

I tried the recipe for a luncheon.  It was good, but I doubled the amount of tuna and I would probably recommend using a bow tie noodles to give it a little more pizazz when serving to a crowd.  It does serve a lot of people and everyone enjoyed it.

This recipe is great!  I did modify, but I really like the idea of dill in the dressing.  I used a whole box of pasta.  Added the juice of 1 lime, a few shakes of white wine vinegar, extra pepper, a teaspoon of sugar, peas, onions and 3 cans of tuna. I omitted the broccoli and cauliflower? only because I didnt have it on hand.  The best Tuna Mac salad I have ever had!

My mother used to make a salad similar to this and I've been making it my entire adult life.  Instead of the broccoli and carrots I add seeded chopped tomatoes.  Also, I think it's important to seed the cucumbers.  If you don't do this, leftovers could get really runny.  Also, in reading the other reviews, I'm pretty sure the recipe was supposed to say 2 cups of uncooked pasta.  It looks like one reviewer thought that was how much cooked pasta should be used.

This is very yummy, but I did make some changes.  I halved the recipe, but used the same amount of tuna and pepper.  It seemed bland without the additional pepper.  I also used zucchini instead of cucumbers because that was what I had on hand.  I really enjoyed this for lunch!

This is a great summer pasta salad.  I didn't have any cucumbers so I left those out and I added just a touch of sweet relish.  Very good.  I will make this again.

This recipes works out perfectly. I might next time drop the dill to 1/2 tsp.  I used the new mini farfalle pasta and it work great.

Great recipe!  Only thing I did different was shred the carrot.  There was plenty crunch with the broccoli and celery.  Next time I might add another can of tuna.   It was very subtle.

This would be a good salad to bring to a potluck dinner because it has a  good variety of ingredients.   However, we felt that there was some flavorings or ingredients that could be added to enhance the taste of this dish.

I modified the recipe by using what I had around. I diced some leftover penne noodles and used broccoli and red onion. The tuna and mayo needed some help so in adition to extra dill I added garlic powder, mustard powder, pepper, and a pinch of salt, all to taste. These spices added quite a bit of flavor and I used this in a wrap for lunch on the go. I like that you can personalize this so thanks for a great recipe!

I skipped the broccoli and used the food processor to finely chop the carrots and celery, plus I used 2 cans of tuna. It was yummy but slightly bland. Might add onion next time.

I left out the dillweed but added a dash of white pepper in it's place. I thought this tasted kinda of bland after mixing so I added 1 tablespoon of fat-free italian salad dressing.  Love the addition of the additional veggies most tuna salads don't have.

Wonderful recipe, great for those days when you want something light and fresh. I add Spike and other herbs (including garlic & onion powder) to this, and it tastes wonderful.  Prep time isn't the shortest because of the time required to wash and chop the veggies, but it's worth it.

A great way to use fresh vegetables. I like how the tuna, pasta, and vegetables add lots of dimension to the salad. This would be a great dish to take to a potluck, it will appeal to lots of different tastes.

this is excellent recipe, thanks for sharing. I made it as called for and next time I think I will add more Dill weed.  This is a keeper.
