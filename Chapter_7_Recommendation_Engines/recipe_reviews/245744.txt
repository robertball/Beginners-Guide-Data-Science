I was looking for something that had all of the things that I like in a cake rich moist and with a delightful cherry flavour?. Are used Betty Crocker devilâ€™s food mix so ended up using a little more oil and three eggs but otherwise essentially followed the recipe. Baking time for me was almost 50 minutes but I think that was because I used a little smaller casserole dish. I think this recipe is worth trying for someone who is willing to experiment a little with their dessert desires.???

Made this in a Bundt pan as pictured, and poured icing as a glaze. Did not beat in mixer! Wanted to keep cherries whole. Beat eggs well, then mix in the rest by hand.
