I used thick cut loin chops.  The 40 minutes in a 400 oven concerned me so I browned them in a skillet and then finished them at 350 for about 20 min.  The internal temp was 160 when they came out.  Absolutely wonderful.

My husband and I loved this dinner.  We had accidentally bought pork loin pork chops so they were already thinly sliced so we were able to just fold them over and did not have to take the time to slice into pork chops.  It was easy to make and delicious.  We didn't have the final ingredient, the spicy powder, and it was still great.

Truthfully, I was disappointed with this recipe.  I stuffed with spinach, mushrooms and cheese, which was great, but we couldn't taste the horseradish at all.  The chops got very watery in the pan, and they were swimming by the time they were done.  Great idea, but I think it needs tweaking.

just a note to a couple of the posts -  if you add mushrooms, especially fresh - they will make the chops watery.... and the best horseradish mustard we've tried is Wild Willie's :)... just a suggestion

pretty easy meal, and great presentation.  Easy to dry out ... next time I'll use more mustard, perhaps a little seasoning inside the pocket.

Made as directed and was easy, pretty and good. The horseradish mustard does not lend much flavor(I should have realized from the small amount called for) so I would mix some with the spinach before stuffing or serve some on the side next time because that was part of what drew me to this recipe. We liked the smoked gouda and unlike some experienced, it melted enough that a little started to ooze out near the end of baking.

My husband made this for Mother's Day.  It's a darned good thing he made extra, because we all LOVED it!  He thinks that many kinds of cheeses could work, but I really think the gouda was the way to go.

Lots of work, but worth it.  I used a packaged oven pork coating mix instead of the bread crumbs.

These Pork Chops were fantastic.  I made them for dinner last night and hubby ate two of them.  I loved the flavor.  I used Italian Panko B/Cs and I did not have horseradish mustard so I used 2T. horseradish and 2T. Dijon mustard and mixed together.  Delish!!!

I was just looking for a "spinach and pork chop" recipe because that's what I had in the house, and this came up. I didn't have or use any cheese, but lined the pan with lots of spinach, then coated the pork chops with horseradish mustard and italian bread crumbs and baked. It was delicious and very easy!

This recipe was so yummy.  I made a few changes due to some of the reviews.  I added mushrooms in the stuffing and added the creole seasoning to the inside and I also mixed it in with my breadcrumbs.  So very flavorful.  Will definitely do again! Didn't come out dry or undercooked.  Thank thank you so much for sharing!

I have made this recipe several times.  I use frozen spinach and eliminate the bread crumbs (to make it with less carbs).  Love it. Tonight I am going to try blue cheese instead of gouda.

Did with chicken. Pounded out chicken, spread horseradish sauce on chicken, put cheese and spinach then rolled up. Dipped in whisked egg and rolled in planko. Mixed cajun seasoning in planko and dashed on top. Baked at 400 for 20ish mins. Yummy!!! And did what other suggested and got cheese from deli...2 slices for 91 cents

This is an excellent and easy recipe for stuffed pork chops. I used Italian seasoned panko and Emeril's essence for the creole seasoning. I cooked for 40 minutes and let sit for 5 minutes and it was perfectly cooked. The flavor of the gouda with the seasoned panko was delicious. Thanks for sharing !!

Awesome!  Hubby loved the flavors.  Suggestion:  when cutting the pocket, cut the smallest opening and then run the knife inside to make a deep pocket.  The smallest opening will keep more of the cheese from melting out.

Amazing!!!!! This was the best pork I have ever eaten! I loved the kick that the horseradish mustard gave to it! It wasn't too spicy at all but it did give it a tongue-pleasing boost of flavor. The gouda melted and spilled out quite a bit when it was in the oven, so next time I am going to place the pork chops stuffed-end-up so that most of the cheese will stay inside the chop. But all in all, this is an amazing and simple recipe that everyone should try!

I enjoyed this recipe.  I did not have gouda on hand, so I substituted in parmesan cheese, which I felt would go well with spinach and pork.  I added a fair amount of cajun seasoning and recommend adding salt and pepper as well.  45 minutes was the perfect amount of time for a crispy crust and juicy interior.

This was delicious! I ommitted the horseradish/mustard because my husband doesn't like it and instead used an egg wash before coating with panko crumbs. I baked on a cooling rack atop a cookie sheet and turned half way through baking so the panko was crispy on both sides. Thank you!

This is a solid recipe.  I was hoping for more flavor from the horseradish mustard, but alas, it was kind of plain!  Next time, I believe I will try this with seasoned crumb stuffing mix for the outside coating.  Also, I used wooden toothpicks to keep the opening of the chops together while they cooked.  I used 1 1/4" pork loin chops and the cooking time was right for me.

This recipe was awesome!!! I added bacon to the filling and additional creole seasoning to the panko breadcrumbs. Also made a mushroom and spinach sauce to go over the pork but it would still be great without. Don't skip on the gouda, the saltiness of the cheese lends great flavor.

This came out great!  I loved the flavors together.  My chops were thin, so I pounded them out a bit and folded them over the stuffing.  I also squirted a dollop of horseradish mustard onto each chop's top once they were in the baking dish, spread it with a brush, and pressed the breadcrumbs onto the tops only.  The chops were too difficult to handle once they were stuffed.  It was easy and delicious!  Served it with roasted red potatoes and baked apples.

This was a very tasty recipe.  I changed the mustard to Dijon and stand alone horseradish, and then added more than the stated recipe based on our tastes.  I also put a little of the mustard/horseradish inside the chops as well.

This was a huge hit with my 3 teens and their dad. The first time, I made it with roasted red potatoes (tossed in olive oil and garlic) and roasted asparagus and red peppers. Our traditional "Stuffed Chops" recipe called for stuffing and gravy, and now, the kids vote for this instead!

I wouldn't say you gotta use too thick of pork chops...that was a little overbearing.  I'd go for regular so the meat isn't so overpowering...  And I'm a meat LOVA'

I love this! I use extra horseradish mustard inside and around the outside. I also put minced raw garlic inside because everything needs garlic! :)
If I have too thin pork chops on hand, I pound them out and make roll ups instead - just as delicious! It's also good for stuffing into chicken breasts - just adjust the time.
To get your panko extra crispy, spray the tops with cooking spray before putting them in.

A great-tasting dish. I added finely-minced garlic to the horseradish mustard and I did coat the inside pocket with it, as well as the outside coating. I serve it on a bed of fresh spinach, VERY littler dressed with a mild vinaigrette. This is so simple and impressive, it makes a yummy dinner party entrée. For extra indulgence, I will put a 1/2 slice of gouda on top the last 5 to 10minutes of baking. Great idea to buy slices of smoked gouda at the deli--way cheaper!

This was incredibly tasty and was simple to make. The gouda melted out all over the dish, so we had to scoop it out to drizzle back over the top, or we would've lost the gouda flavor.

I really liked these but I think next time I should use spinach leaves instead of frozen spinach. I don't really like the taste of cooked spinach so it altered the taste somewhat. But the gouda seeped out and that part got all browned and yummy. All in all it is a great recipe.

Loved this.....after reading some of the reviews, I smeared the mustard on the inside of the pork chop then put cheese and spinach in.  The chops were moist enough to grab the crumbs, but I think you could probably put it on the outside also.  It was excellent.

Yum Yum Yum!  So easy and delicious!!  You really don't taste the horseradish but that's okay because my family would not have eaten it if it was strong.  Some of the filling came out in the cooking process but I did overly stuff them I think ;)  Great recipe...thanks!

I'm in love.  We used provolone, because we had a hard time finding gouda in our small town grocery store, but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  I was weary because I'm not a horseradish fan, but I devoured mine.  Absolutely delicious!

This was very good as it was, but I think the next time I make it, (mainly because I didn't like how hard it was to bread the chops with the horseradish) I'm going to try wasabi, then breading. The flavor was so similar to the wasabi is why I'm going to try it that way. Very tasty!

Honestly, I didn't care much for this.  The gouda didn't melt like I thought it would and was a bit chunky and weird.  I probably will make again and keep the spinach but maybe find something besides gouda to add-maybe mushrooms? I couldn't taste the horseradish mustard very well so don't make a special trip to the store for it.

Thanks moonshine7015 my husband and I loved this recipe! Quick, easy, and a great presentation!  I used pork tenderloin. Easier to cut to you likeness, and less costly than loin.  I used Emeril's "Kicked Up Horseradish" and then the panko which we loved.  The smoked Gouda adds a wonderful presentation and flavor. -TX Sal

After reading some of the reviews, I was skeptical of trying this.  I must say, we were TOTALLY impressed with this restaurant quality dish!  I did not have the horseradish mustard, so instead I made my own combination of Dijon mustard and horseradish to spread on the pork chop.  The cheese melted perfectly and the spinach was cooked to perfect.  I'll DEFINITELY be making this again soon!

OMG I am addicted to this recipe and have passed it on to many others!  It is crunchy, creamy, tasty, and for someone who have never liked dijon mustard, I've now become a convert.  This recipe is good with chicken breasts too!  Thank you for a quick and absolutely yummy recipe!

Changed ingredients (because it was what was in fridge) to include Spinach, gorgonzola, & button mushrooms... I baked on LOWEST rack to allow for moisture to escape for full 45 minutes. I took extra step and floured my chops after stuffing, milk/egg bathed, then panko & breadcrumb mixture. Resulted in exquisite crunch & wonderful mix of flavors.  It isn't often the hubs asks me about ingredients but tonight he did!  Definitely a palate pleaser.... will make again.

I made this for my roommate and I last night and it was absolutely delicious. Panko breadcrumbs make it more cunchy, mixed with the flavor of the horseradish mustard and cheese, it was unbelieveable and very easy to make.

I did not have fresh spinach the first time I made it.  It does improve with fresh.  Even with the horseradish and creole seasoning, I thouht it needed something.  Have not been able to figure it out.  Will I make this again? Yes indeed!

Great idea! I'm a poor grad student, so I substituted what I had in the house (chipotle mayo for the horesradish mustard, garlic powder for the creole seasoning) and it came out pretty well. I only cooked two of these at a time (also had two red potatoes in the pan), and even 35 minutes in a 400 degree oven was FAR too much time. Going to try 20 minutes on 350 next time. I'd probably try browning in the pan first like the top viewer suggested, because the panko didn't brown almost at all for me (possibly due to the difference in seasoning).

This was a good find, though. My boyfriend really enjoyed it, and it certainly felt like a real meal.

This recipe was fantastic!!!  I used boneless loin chops instead of bone-in chops.  I also used twice as much horseradish mustard.  If you can find it, get a single piece of smoked Gouda from the deli section of your supermarket, it's definately cheaper that way.  I shredded the cheese and mixed it with the torn spinach for the stuffing.  Other than these minor changes, everything else is the same.  Huge hit in our family.

Great recipe.  Really looks fancy for guests and tastes great too.  I didn't have any "horseradish mustard", so I've played around with dijon mustard/ horseradish mix and another time with a remoulade and both times turned out great.  I only needed to bake mine for 35 minutes though.

Made horseradish mustard by using equal parts of Dijon mustard and horseradish. Stuffed the chops with the cheese and spinach and some of the mustard mixture, salt and pepper. Didn't use the creole seasoning.  Used half Italian seasoned bread crumbs and half Panko with some Paprika. Browned in a frying pan and finished in the oven at 375 for 15 minutes. Perfect!

Not bad. I didn't have gouda cheese, so I used pepperjack. The flavor was good, but a bit salty. Will have to try again with Gouda cheese. I will say the chops were very tender.

I used pepper jack cheese instead 
an egg in place of the mustard 
and added mushrooms also I used bread crumbs (ran out of panko)
I made three two encrusted and one just with spices  I heated my roasted pan up with oil as I got everything together 
That way it's nice seared crust on the outer 
with the pan droppings I added some white wine and made gravy 
My husband really enjoyed the stuff chops

This recipe was delicious. I used goat cheese instead of Gouda and thin loin chops, they turned out juicy and flavorful in about 14 minutes at 350 degrees. I put the Gouda with green chiles and whole wheat pasta for a nice side.

BUT had to do much tweaking. Sautee the spinach in garlic, olive oil salt and black pepper first. Take out of the pan and put in mixing bowl, then add shredded 18 month aged gouda, mix together then stuff. We also browned them before baking. Dipped in our own blend of bread crumbs and spices then baked. Still took about 30min in the oven. Made lots of juice. We just took them out and let them rest a bit. Served with Sautéed sugar snap peas and seasoned Basmati rice. Fantastic dinner for our little get together.

I followed the recipe exactly like it was written. The flavor was okay, most of the cheese melted out . It never got that "crunchy" texture. For the amount of effort it took to make this dish it wasn't worth the effort

Dinner was a Success! Used thin-cit pork chops and layered them instead of stuffing or folding them & baked them over a bed of rice with chicken broth instead of water - only thing that would have made it better, would've been adding more cheese on top and all over the rice too :)

Great recipe, I blended the creole seasoning (which I made with items in the cabinet) with the planko for more even seasoning.   I also didn't have horseradish mustard, so I added horseradish to spicy brown mustard.  It was fantastic!

Very good recipe, easy to make.  I substituted Feta cheese for the Gouda.  Also used pre-packaged Italian bread crumbs instead of plain.  Forgot the Thyme, Creole seasoning and salt/pepper but still turned out pretty darn good!

I made it for dinner guests and they raved!  I used asparagus tips instead of spinach as one of our guests doesn't like spinach, but it was DELICIOUS!  I will definitely make again.

I used what I had on hand i.e. babybel original cheese, asparagus,  sazon seasoning, thin cut pork chops.

Cleaned and Opened up the chops and placed small pieces of asparagus and babybel in each one. I smothered each chop in Annies organic horseraddish mustard. Then coated each chop in Panko Italian Style Bread Crumbs. Generously sprinkled Sazon seasoning on the chops. Baked for about 50 mins. 
It turned out so juicy and perfect. I didn't have an issue with water. I did use thinner chops though.

I am not a big pork eater and had never cooked huge chops before. So I made the spinach and smoked Gouda recipe. Had no Gouda so used Provolone.  Mixed creamy horseradish sauce (Boarshead) with Dijon. Also sprinkled a bit of garlic powder. These were delicious. I loved them. I highly recommend.

I may try this one again but will need to change a few things. first I think more horseradish mustard and more cheese but this was good tasting a lot like regular pork chops with bread crumbs or shake and bake.

Fabulous recipe - serves beautifully!  The 40 minutes is LONG ENOUGH!  Made twice in 3 days - so 2nd time was perfect.  

I used  fresh horseradish mixed with county style dijon - YUM!
I rubbed inside of chop with a little horseradish mixture - kept
spinach and cheese moist.

Thank you - this is a keeper and simple to do,also.

I mixed the stuffing with a little scallion cream cheese I had leftover in the frig. Then I spread it inside the chops. I used horseradish sauce and spread it on the chops then used regular crumbs. I also sprinkled with salt and pepper. Came out great! Quick preparation and easy. I roasted potato and carrots on the top rack while the chops cooked. Note: use tin foil for easy clean up and flip chops at half point for even browning.

It was surprisingly delicious. I did substitute the gouda for a combination of aged white cheddar and Mozzarella. I also cut the spinach into shreds, a lot easier to stuff with. Most definitely making this again.

My wife described this as the best Pork Chops she has ever had.  Like other in reviews, I seared the meat in a skillet and put it on a roasting pan so it was less greasy.  Also, I bought the pork chops before I found the recipe, and they were thin cut.   To work around this, I lined up the bones in pairs, breaded on one side of each piece and sandwiched the spinach and cheese between them.  I kind of liked this, as it allowed me to put a lot more spinach in, which was a great for sneaking vegetables in on kids.

Excellent dish! I made a mixture in the food processor of grated cheese and fresh spinach with a bit of olive oil to make it sort of spreadable. I pounded boneless pork sirloin chops until they were evenly thin, spread the mixture on each chop, then rolled each one up and secured the edges with toothpicks. You can still coat these with the horseradish and crumbs before baking. 45 minutes is way too long. I suggest baking them at 350 and start checking them after about 20 minutes or so. I used a 350 convection for 20 minutes and they were completely done inside and crispy outside from the convection air movement. I don't know how a regular oven works for this dish.

Usually the first time I tried a recipe I'd made it as written. This time, however, I made a few minor changes since I did not have all the ingredients on hand for the thick pork chops. I brushed the pocket with a stone ground mustard, then stuffed it  with spinach and the Gouda cheese. I did not have any bread crumbs so I just simply sprinkled the chops with a generous amount of the creole seasoning.  They were then put on a grill, and they came out unbelievably moist and tasty. This recipe is definitely a keeper, next time, I'll try it as written. Thanks for sharing the recipe. I'll try it again with chicken breasts. Otherwise, an excellent recipe and much easier than I thought.

This tasted great! I used goat cheese instead of gouda (drool), crushed multi-seed crackers for the crust to make it gluten free (this worked great and added a tasty crunch), and cajun spice instead of creole (because I can’t read haha). I’m definitely ma

The gouda and spinach stuffing was great. Something about the combination of panko and spices/mustard I just didn't love, but my husband liked it a lot. I will likely make it again with some tweaks in the seasoning.

This was really tasty. I followed the ingredients (chose Panko, bone-in 1-inch pork chops) but after reading the reviews, decided to coat the inside of the pork pocket with the mustard before putting in the spinach and gouda.  The inside was nice and moist.  I used much more mustard than the recipe called for but it was worth it. The flavor mellows and it's not spicy. I also made sure to use the cajun seasoning on the outside and it was just the right bite. I did end up increasing the temperature to 425 to speed up cooking (which was about 50 minutes). I will definitely make again but wanted to warn those of you if you're going to make this for guests, make sure to allow time.

I wonder if this would be good with fruit also, like dried cranberries, apples? Might add that sweet to the savory...

We have made this twice.  I did not have horseradish mustard, used a Wasabi mustard instead.  Excellent!  Made again for a friend who has cancer, used kale, onions and seasonings and mozzarella and Asiago cheese and homemade croutons, crushed up.  Will check back to see how she likes it, but boy did they look good!

I subbed cornflake crumbs for the breadcrumbs to make this gluten free. And mixed equal parts Dijon mustard and horseradish to make horseradish mustard, though I didn't check to see if this is a valid thing to do. I could not fit a half pound of spinach in 4 chops so I used a lot less, probably only 2 or 3 ounces. Nice, different way to flavor pork chops!

I like this and would make it again, but my husband didn't care for it. This recipe was so elegant looking and simple to put together that it would be perfect for a group dinner.  I didn't have Gouda or fresh spinach but I used shredded Mozzarella and frozen spinach thawed and drained. Since I can't eat horseradish I just used tooth picks to mark which one was mine.   This recipe makes a beautiful presentation dish but could really use some spice inside.

Very good recipe. I used honey dijon mustard because that's what I had. I reduced the baking time to 30 minutes. They were perfect! I sliced the gouda cheese and put it in the pocket before putting the spinach in which helped prevent it from running out as it melted.

We will absolutely prepare these porkies again!  Made as written, and we followed a suggestion to bake them standing on end, with the slit at the top, to prevent the stuffing from oozing out.  This also kept the panko on both sides crisp.  Next time, we'll try coating the inside of the chops with basil pesto for a different flavor.  We may end up just coating them in egg, skipping the horseradish/mustard, then pressing them into seasoned panko.  Lots of ways to make these your own -- but do use the smoked gouda.
We used one-inch pork chops, which ended up being a lot of meat per person -- could use a 3/4" chop instead.  Roasted them for about 40 minutes.

I liked everything about this, but did change a few things. I used a boneless pork chop, about an inch thick. I used canned spinach and mozzarella cheese. I first stuffed the spinach and then the cheese. Next time I will mix the spinach and cheese and then stuff the pork chop.

Maybe I had bad mustard but i mixed it with spinach and brushed on outside of chops. I like mustard and horseradish so next time i will double. I also put on top of grill rack so doesnt get soggy. As well did a quick broil for 5 minutes on Lo broil to crisp up. Stick up opening to hold cheese

My guests and I liked this recipe. I served it with garlic smashed red potatoes and green beans. I cut my own chops from a whole pork loin and made them 1 1/2" thick.  I cut the pocket so that the "fat side" was on the bottom. This worked well because I could stand up the chops for stuffing and baking. At 400 they cooked in 25 minutes. I lightly sauteed the spinach in olive oil to add more moisture and didn't use as much cheese. I also couldn't get the panko to brown as much as I like. Next time I may lightly coat the it with cooking spray before I put them in the oven.

I loved these chops!  I suggest only using a light shake of the creole seasoning.  I made my opening no more than an inch and a half, and still a small amount of the cheese and spinach seeped out. I cut up my cheeses into small cubes and added a little crushed garlic and after mixing it with the spinach

Added some extra horseradish mustard inside as suggested by others, as well as some salt and pepper on the chops before breading. Mixed about half tsp of creole seasoning in the mustard and sprinkled liberally on top as well.  I think my slices of Gouda were too thick, as they did not melt evenly, and my son thought the Gouda was too overpowering. Might make again if he's not around, as 3/4 of family liked it.

I made this last night and it was a hit, hubster said it's a keeper recipe. I used a Tuscan rub on the pork chops and Dijon mustard in place of the horseradish as I didn't have any. I do think that next time I will forgo the breadcrumbs, just a personal preference. Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

I lined my pan with foil first. You make a pocket in a thick pork chop while it is lying down flat. The instructions in the recipe were good. I was going to try and make a pocket while the chop was standing on end! My husband showed me the technique and then they don't fall over of course. I made my own creole spice using an on line recipe and left out the cayenne pepper cause I don't care for it. I sprinkled the chops inside and out with the creole spice then stuffed with spinach and cheese mixture. Then slathered on the 1/2 mustard 1/2 horsey sauce and turned in corn flakes crumbled in food processor.  YUM!! Not one bite left!!! Thank you!

I used a cookie  to bake mine on, came out crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The smoked gouda flavor with the horseradish is delicious! I also used a lot more mustard than recipe called for, made sure they were  coated well.

Wonderful! I am putting this on our rotation as soon as I'm done writing the review. I used regular Gouda, because that's what I had. Based on other reviews I did mix some of the spice with the spinach prior to stuffing the chops and, I probably put the horseradish mustard on just a bit thicker than the recipe called for, but that was it. Even our picky tween liked it. I did toothpick the chops to hold the cheese in better & am going to try and stand the chops up next time. So yummy!

We actually received this exact recipe in our wine of the month shipment. We loved it. I am always hesitant about cooking pork all the way through for safety  and this recipe did it! No pink. We only made 2 chops since it was the 2 of us and we served with a side of rice. My boyfriend specifically mentioned he loved how it was crispy and stuffed with deliciousness. I have never stuffed meat before. I definitely need more practice. I couldn't get it all in there. Also once it melted it fell into the pan, but I just scooped it up with a spoon and re stuffed after cooking. Yum!

Made these for my hubby and he thought they were great. I really enjoyed them as well. The smoked gouda added a nice flavor. Will make again.

These were absolutely delicious.  I purchased Inglehoffer deli mustard with horeseradish roots as it was the only horseradish mustard that wasn't in a gallon container.  It was a winner!  I've never tasted such a delicious mustard taste.  I put a generous tablespoon on top of each chop and then patted the crumbs on as the other reviewer suggested.  I used 4 oz of spinach and it filled the chops plenty.  I used a good brand of smoked gouda.  I bought the bone in chops as I think these are always tastier.  Cutting the pouch was the hardest part (sometimes you can find them already cut).  The recipe is easy and would be a great weeknight dinner.  Even bone in, they take less than 45 minutes to bake.  I served them with pearl couscous and apple sauce.  This will be one of my favorite meals in the future.  I inserted a small metal kitchen pick in the opening to keep the stuffing in.  The little bit that came out got browned and crispy and was wonderful.  I recommend using the panko crumbs because they turned out so good.  We definitely could taste the mustard throughout the breading.  I was generous with it and the brand was awesome.   If you want to try a recipe, follow the instructions and don't add watery mushrooms to dilute the other flavors.  I don't understand why people rate something that they have changed dramatically.

These chops are good enough to serve to company - really tasty & simple!  I brined my chops in the am for about 4-5 hours - this makes a huge difference with keeping the chops moist (you can even overcook a little and they should still keep their moisture).  Any pork brine will do - there's tons of recipes.  Grated my gouda and stuffed to the max.  Had thick Costco chops and only needed to bake 30 minutes - don't overbake!  Good stuff!

Pretty easy to make.  And you can make it ahead, which is great, because this would be very impressive to serve to guests.  My husband said it tasted like a restaurant meal!
I accidentally put the horseradish mustard inside instead of outside - delicious!!  The panko crumbs didn't brown, and I don't know if it was because of the omission of the mustard.  I did spray them very lightly cooking spray.  Also, I didn't have Creole seasoning, so I left it off.

Recipe was great! I had a thinner lean cut of pork chops, but still was able to stuff them. I put some of the horseradish mustard inside the chop before stuffing and actually baked them on a cookie sheet like suggested. Sprayed the tops with cooking spray and they came out crisp and ready to eat in 45 minutes. The only thing I would do different is use plain gouda cheese instead of the smoked next time. Not a fan of the smoked flavor.

My family loved this. I didn't have the right mustard so I used Dijon mustard and added a heaping tsp of horseradish. They were a little over cooked at 1 hour so next time I will take them out at 45 minutes and let them rest   But the flavor was great!

I now receive the A.R. Magazine (it is the best!) and this recipe was in it.  I made it tonight and It was a hit. Easy steps, very simple and great flavor. My dad doesn't like mustard or horseradish, ate 2 pork chops and was scrapping the gouda off the plate. . A+

Made this the other night for supper and it was delicious!  The only thing I did differently is that I used Arizona heat mustard instead of the horseradish mustard.  So good, it'll definitely be added to my recipe book.

This was awesome! I did add mushrooms and sun ripened tomatoes though. My boyfriend couldn't get enough. I never finish my plate but when I made this I did! Lolz

Have made it several times - sometimes with sharp cheddar in place of Gouda.  All very good!  Mushrooms sound like good addition, I'll try that this week. Everyone loves it!

Great! I got chops that were a little bigger and the amount of spinach and cheese called for was way too much to try and stuff into the 4 chops which was weird. I kept reading the ingredient list over and over to make sure I wasn't reading it wrong.

This was a good idea but I am not a fan of the smoked gouda. The smoked flavor was too overpowering so I may try this with regular gouda next time.

Love this! I use the thick cut chops. I have tried this with goat cheese as well. Delicious combination.
