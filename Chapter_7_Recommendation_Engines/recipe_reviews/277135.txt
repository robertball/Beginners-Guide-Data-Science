4.28.20 This turned out pretty well.  The only thing that I might change in the future is adding more lemon juice and some thinly-sliced green onion, but I particularly loved the sweetness of the saut√©ed red bell peppers.   Comes together very easily and quickly for a tasty meal with lovely presentation.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, we enjoyed it.

Delicious!  I made the recipe almost exactly as it said with one mild change. While shrimp was cooking, I mixed the parmesan cheese, lemon zest, 1 tsp dried parsley (didn't have fresh) and some salt and pepper with the cooked warm pasta.  Then added the pasta mixture in with cooked shrimp mixture.  The flavor was scrumptious - will definitely make this again.
