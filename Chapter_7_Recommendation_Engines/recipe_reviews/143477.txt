Another great recipe from Chef Austin! This is certainly a very versatile dish that I believe you can cook any which way and it will always turn out well. Because grilling was not going to be an option yesterday and wasn't quite sure what time the four kids would be meandering in, I decided to make this in my slow cooker. One of my buddies from OurTableTalk.com suggested I add baby carrots into the sauce as the pork was cooking and I'm so glad I did. The sauce alone in this dish is so delicious and the carrots soaked up all of that flavor. The pork came out melt in your mouth tender and even tho I had a GINORMOUS piece of meat there was only enough left over to make the boys a sandwich for today. I froze the rest of the sauce which I will use when I make a chicken stir fry this week. Thanks again Austin!!

This was a real hit with my brood!  I simpified the directions by only adding the brown sugar and salt to the brine.  I honestly think that adding all those ingredients twice is overkill and too time comsuming.  The meat was moist and the flavors were great.  I recommend this one with two thumbs up!

We really enjoyed this! I did not have OJ so I added some apple juice to the glaze & halved the amount based on the feedback from others...I only used about 2 tbsp total b/c it is rather sweet/powerful, but complements the pork very well! I brined for about 3-4 hours and it definitely made a difference, so juicy & tender!!!! It was my first experience with brining anything other than a Thanksgiving turkey, now I want to brine everything! LOL
I served it w/ some basmati rice & roasted carrots (tossed w/ olive oil, s/p & sugar before roasting). 
Yum! Will definitely make again.

I halved the recipe for both the brine and the glaze -- and there was PLENTY of both for a 1 1/2 pound pork tenderloin.  Eight hours of brining makes for a somewhat salty end product.

Made this for dinner tonight....our dinner guests couldn't stop raving!! I didn't have orange juice, so I used orange marmalade. I'm telling you...the glaze made this dish! I had glaze left over, which I heated and served along side the meat, allowing guests to add to the meat if they wished.  I will be making this dish again! Thanks for sharing!! ***The next day, I cut up the meat, sauted bell pepper & onion in olive oil. Added the meat, and left over sauce to the veggies. Served with fried rice & egg rolls. My clan loved it!

This recipe is so delicious. Now that we can cook pork less like a piece of charcoal without the same worries from years ago, I've learned to appreciate this melt in your mouth texture of pork. I'm a convert to brining now!

best pork tenderloin I ever tasted and I try many tenderloin recipes and styles of cooking. I brined for 8 hours.

This is a fantastic dish.  I brined the Pork tenderloin as instructed and the meat was so tender and juicy.  When I try out a recipe on Allrecipes, I make it with no changes what so ever to give it a true rating the very first time.  After that, I tweak it here and there the second time to adjust it to my tastes.  This recipe needs no tweaks and is fantastic just the way it is.  GREAT RECIPE!

I made this tonight and it was awesome. I brined the meat the night before and popped it into the slow cooker.  It was moist and delish.

I did have a lot of the sauce left over so I popped it into the fridge and plan on using it on chicken tomorrow night. Thanks so much for the post.

i have tried this recipe twice now once for just my close family then for my extended family and each time i made it they loved it some even wanted to make it into a sandwich. now i will say that i let it sit in the brine over night and instead of a regular grill i used a george forman grill so i cut it up first then cooked it but it came out great and yeah you do get a little too much sauce to put over it left. you can also enjoy it with out that sauce too. i will say one thing the sauce gives it a sweet taste so prepare for that

This was great. I didn't have hoisen sauce but I used a spicy schezuan sauce and it still tasted great. I put some of the sauce on before grilling and kept adding sauce as it was cooking.  Didn't need any extra sauce on top

I brined the tenderloin for 12 hours and it still did not absorb much of the flavour. The glaze was also not something we enjoyed. It tasted far too much like the hoisin sauce. It seemed to overpower all the other sauces and flavourings in it. Too bad because I had such high hopes for it seeing as it was a 5 star recipe.

Delicous, and properly named as this pork absolutely melts in your mouth. I made it useing the serving converter and ended up with much more brine than I actually needed. I put it in the brine and left in the icebox overnight. It came out great and won first place in a family cook-off. Pay special attention to the cooking time as there is a very small window between undercooked and perfect then overcooked.

Incredible!  The meat had so much flavor, and was so tender, it was amazing.  Served this with the carrot rice and sesame green beans (also from this site).  You could easily cut the glaze in half as there was a lot left over.

I'm only rating the sauce; I didn't have time for the brine.  The flavors of the sauce are wonderful and when grilled make a delicious crust!  We will absolutely make again and I'd like to try the brine next time.

I used the brine recipe and incorporated it into a sweet garlic pork recipe.  I've made the dish a hundred times but never with the brine and OMG!  What a huge difference it makes! The tenderloin was so tender and delicious!  I do the brine process from now on, for sure!

This recipes is absolutely wonderful! We had it at a family gathering and everyone loved it. I did make a few changes to the recipe. I kept the meat in the brine for 24 hours them put it in the oven for 2 hours at 350 basting the meat every 15 minutes with the sauce. (Keep in mind I cooked almost 5 lbs. of meat since we had 12 people over.) I let the internal temperature of the meat get to around 140 degrees. Next we put the meat on the grill outside for around 20 minutes and let it get fully cooked. After slicing the meat I poured the rest of the sauce over the meat. The outside of the meat was crispy and the inside was sooo tender! I will be making this many many more times. Thanks for a great recipe.

Amazing! We will never make a tenderloin any other way after trying this recipe.  Brining is the way to go! The glaze was a little sweet for my taste but my husband loved it!

This was amazing.  The brining is totally worth it; your pork will NOT be dry.  The leftovers taste great too.

The pork was moist and delicious, but the amount of glaze left over was enormous!  A real waste of ingredients, particularly since the brining liquid also required many of the same ones.  The sauce was much more liquid than jellied.  I ended up with 1 3/4 cups afterwards.

Pork is very tender - sauce was very good also.  All the kids loved the pork and all but one loved the sauce with it.  We had this with white rice and the sauce was an excellent addition.  Will be making again.

I'd give it about 3.5 stars, as I thought it was a bit salty. I marinated it for about 4 hours, maybe less would be better. I also think you could half the brine and be fine. I was shy on a couple of the ingredients for the glaze, so I can't really comment on that part.

Absolutely perfect! Easy, delicious, and tender! There WAS a lot of glaze leftover, though - next time I think I'll cut the recipe in half.

I admit, I only used the brine from this recipe, however it did wonders for my cut of pork. The flavors made their way all the way to the center, and it was very juicy. If it wasn't so cold up here I would have done the recipe justice and used the sauce and thrown it on the grill, however grilling in -20 is suicide.

Very tasty recipe!  Followed recipe exactly with excellent results.  Pork was very tender and smelled great grilling. Served on brown rice.

This was a huge hit with the whole family. The glaze was especially well received.

This is excellent.  I did not have the time to let the meat brine, and it was still excellent!  I can only imagine what it tastes like after brining!  I made double the recipe and it was gone within the same day.  I basically broiled the tenderloins and near the end glazed them with the sauce as well as served them with it.  We also had a chicken fried rice recipe from this website the same night.  Excellent!  Thanks for the post!

This turned out really well...followed the recipe exactly except for the fact that I didn't use an entire gallon of water....just seemed too much.  There were no leftovers, so that has to be a great thing.  Thanks for the post Austin.

I made this along with broccoli with garlic butter and cashews (on this site), and rice.  DELICIOUS!  Brined for 6 hours, then put in crock pot on low for another 6 hours. My family LOVED this.

Austin,

I loved your recipe!  I've never cooked pork tenderloin before and it turned out wonderfully!  My usually picky kids couldn't get enough - "make again", they cried. Thank you!

This is the first time i 've brined anything, and I think it turned out great!  I only did it for 2 hours but because tenderloin is so delicate I wouldn't leave it any longer.  Don't be afraid  to make changes to the glaze. As it turned out I was out of both hoisin and sweet and sour. Substituted with a little honey, vinegar, and tamarind sauce and it was delicious. Instead of grilling I browned it in a pan, and baked it for 15 mins at 375F. Perfect!

This was phenomenal! So tender with a really nice flavorful sauce. The only thing was that it made way too much sauce. Half would of been plenty.
