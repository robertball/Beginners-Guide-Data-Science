I have been cooking this recipe for the past 7 years, instead of using diced tomatoes my family adds 1/2 to 1 jar of salsa and also 1 can of ranch style beans undrained, its is soooo good. We like to use Doritos just the regular bag, and we layer them at the bottom, I dont put too many because they tend to get soft, and I like them crunchy. Sometimes instead of using a fork we use the doritos and eat it like its a dip. So its a great meal or snack.

FOUR STARS with slight modifications!
I added taco seasoning to the beef before miking with soup and tomatoes. I then layered the crushed chips, 1/2 of beef mixture, black beans, 1/2 shredded cheese, beef mixture, crushed chips and remainder of cheese. Sort of like a nacho lasagna. After baking, I topped with shredded lettuce and sliced olives. It was a BIG HIT!

As I was making this again tonight I realized that I failed to mention in the review I left a few days ago that I also added chopped yellow onion, onion powder and garlic powder to the ground beef as it was browning.  Not sure if this made a difference but it was definitely good this way!  Spraying the casserole dish with cooking spray made for easy clean up, too.

this is a very good recipe, but i would get rid off the processed cheese slices and put shredded mexican blend cheese, also if you don't want it very bland, add some chili powder

I rated this 4 stars because I made some changes to make it worth 5 stars. First, I crunched the chips some b/4 putting in pan. Second, I used cream of celery soup instead of cream of mushroom.  Third, I added approx 3/4 cup of homemade salsa (mild) to beef mixture.  Fourth, I used shreaded cheddar cheese instead of cheese slices.  Very good and oh so easy to prepare.  My husband thought it was grand!!  Will make again.

With a couple of minor changes and additions, this turned out to be really great. First of all, while I was browning my ground turkey, I placed the tortilla chips in the oven to brown and crisp them up. To my meat mixture I added onion and garlic powders, chile powder and some cumin. I don't do processed anything, so I used grated Vermont Cheddar instead. It was almost like having nachos but a lot easier. We all loved this Kathy and my mexican food lovers thank you!

My boyfriend and I LOVED this recipe. I also added a few changes: Instead of the diced tomatoes I used chunky salsa and instead of the processed cheese food I used Mexican blend shredded cheese. I added chili powder for a little kick as well! I also layered the pan like a lasagna: doritos-meat mix-cheese-meat mix-chips-cheese. It turned out great!! We'll definitely have this for dinner again!

We loved this recipe. I did make a minor change by using taco seasoning in place of the diced tomatoes ~ (hubbie isn't a big fan of them). the kids gobbled this up and I was told that this was a "Keeper"

This was just okay. I don't think the cream of mushroom soup really 'fit' with the other ingredients, maybe condensed nacho cheese soup would be better? I added taco seasoning to the meat and used shredded cheese instead. Mine was kinda runny, probably should have drained the tomatoes for a while before adding them in. Not bad at all, but probably won't make again. Thanks :)

This was decent, but not awesome. I used one can of diced tomatoes without chilis, as I was making for a toddler with a sensitive mouth. I added a little onion powder, a  couple dashes of chili powder and cumin and baked the chips in the oven while I was preparing the meat. I used Velveeta cheese. Still, it was just okay, and the leftovers DID NOT reheat well.  We ate it the first night and then hubby came home and said, "That really did not reheat well." I think if I am desperate to make something, I will make this again, but in a smaller pan so that there are no leftovers.

Saved my life:
If you bring a casserole dish and a can opener to any 7-11 store you can make a close approximation of this at the nacho bar. They even have cans of mushroom soup in the food isle.

You might get a few weird looks but it's worth it if you're on your way to a potluck and you didn't have time to prepare. Tasty!

Instead of using diced tomatoes, taco seasoning, used Rotel tomatoes, it has ALL the mexican seasoning you could want, mild or HOT! Definitely use shredded Mexican blend cheese, and forget the mushroom soup!

Substituted 1 cup salsa for the diced tomatoes / green chile peppers. Added taco seasoning & onions while browning the ground beef. Used 3/4 lb of Tex-Mex cheese instead of processed cheese. Turned out fantastic - no left overs! Definetly a keeper!

Very yummy and versatile!  I did change a couple of things per other reviews.  I added onion when I browned the meat.  I used 1 1/2 lbs instead of 1.  I also used Fiesta cheese soup instead of the mushroom soup and I added 16 oz of salsa to the rotel tomatoes and added half to the meat mix and then topped the cheese with the rest.  I also only put chips on the top and sides and I used tortilla chips instead of nacho cheese chips.  I served this with sour cream on top and a nice crisp side salad....Really YUMMY!!

I use 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup and add reduced fat shredded cheese in the mixture and sprinkle additional on top I leave the chips out and serve the chips on the side.  I love this on a bed of green lettuce served with the chips I call it a Nacho Cheese salad

With some seasoning in the meat mixture, this came out pretty good.  I added cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, and paprika.  The mushroom soup doesn't really add much flavor, but it acts more of a binder so the meat stays together in a sauce.  I'll bet sour cream would do the trick also.  I used shredded cheese blend of cheddar and pepperjack.  It went over well with the kids.  Reheated, it still tasted good, but the chips were soggy.

We made the following modifications: No cream of mushroom soup. Browned meat with cumin, chili powder, salt, pepper, chopped onion, and garlic powder. Then added 1 can undrained ranch style beans. Layered bottom of 13x9 pan with tortilla chips (regular), then layered meat mixture on top of the chips. On top of the meat we put shredded colby jack cheese, then a layer of CRUSHED tortilla chips and more cheese. The chips on the bottom were soggy by the time it was done, next time we will crush them for the bottom layer as well. Topped with fresh tomatoes, sliced black olives, sour cream and lettuce. It TASTED wonderful! I would say you can add just about anything you like as a topping, too.

Family thought it was okay.  Don't think it is something they will ask for.  It was okay to me, think I put too many chips and not enough cheese.

I found there was too much ground beef. There wasn't much flavour. *If* I were to make it again, I'd be making so many changes it would be an entirely different recipe.

Thanks to other reviewers, I added more spices (chili powder, garlic powder, dried cilantro), 1/2 cup Salsa Victoria, drained pinto beans, no canned tomatoes, chopped onions cooked in the meat, and some gumbo file to thicken before pouring it into the  casserole dish. Used a 9x9 glass dish, which is deeper than my 9x13; it fit with some space left. Topped with sliced black olives and some shredded mixed cheeses. Crushed Tostitos Bite Size to line the bottom and on top. Added more cheese on top of the chips and baked at 350 for about 25 minutes. Was a little soupier than I expected, but delicious. My husband said, after a few mouthfuls, to please make this again. He ate several servings, and I kept spooning more onto my own plate! This is a good basic recipe that, with ideas from the reviewers, can be varied every time you make it. Try it!

I made this using the suggestion of adding taco seasoning to the meat while cooking (1/2 packet), and equal parts of shredded cheddar and mozzarella (needed to get rid of the mozzarella because it was getting old) and I thought it was really good and quick.  I also added a little chile powder (about 1/2 tsp), medium hot (Chimasa Brand, pure new mexico chile powder).  I think that made it a little spicy, but added a lot of flavor.  My youngest son, who is the least picky, liked it, but my middle son who is extremely picky asked for something else.  If it was just for me, I'd make this recipe regularly because it was simple, delicious, and quick, but since we don't all agree on it (which is very common, unfortunately :( I will probably only make when my youngest son and I are the only ones eating.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

The only problem was we couldn't stop eating it! I didn't have nacho chips, so I used garlic and cumin and a bit of chili powder to season the meat mixture. I also used Velveeta instead of sliced cheese. It was wonderful. Thanks.

This was ok, but not really enough for a main course.  I think it makes a nice snack with the chips.

I would give this a five because I loved how easy it was to put together, but gave it a four since it did not have that much flavor. If i had had time to go through the reviews I saw one mention adding taco seasoning. that probably would have made an immense difference to the flavor.

Very good & kid friendly recipe. I replaced the tomatoes with medium salsa for extra flavor, and also added garlic powder & chopped onion when browning the beef.  In place of the processed cheese, I use shredded cheddar.  I've also used different flavors of Doritos and it's good with any of them.

I'd give this 3 1/2 stars if I could. It wasn't the BEST recipe but it was decent and very easy to make when you're running out of ingrediants in the house. My kids didn't complain.

Thought this recipe was fantastic!  I added onions when frying and I added salsa and the tomatoes and chilies to it.  I also used regular tortilla chips and it came out great! This will be my new potluck dish.

This was my first attempt ever at preparing a meal for my family and I am pleased to say it was second helpings all around. Everyone loved it. I will definitely do it again. It's easy to follow and has lots of room for experimentation. I used five fresh green chili peppers that I cut up and a whole large yellow onion diced and cooked with the beef. It was served up with a large scoop of sour cream which really topped it off nicely.

This is a dish that can please everyone in your family. The Doritos are a must. This was a huge hit with my 17 year old & his friends. They'll even bring me the ingredients from the store so I will make it for them.

The first time I made this recipe, it was a little dry kind of bland.  So the next time I made this casserole, I put 1/2 package of Taco seasoning in the meat after I drained it.  The other thing I did was use double the cans of soup.  It was a big hit at my house...

After reading some reviews, I too, decided to make this, but with some alterations.  I added chili powder, garlic salt, cilantro, green onions, can of cream of mushroom soup, about 10oz of salsa and some enchilada sauce mix to the ground beef as it cooked.  Then I layered crushed chips, the meat mixture, one can of drained black beans, shredded Mexican blend cheese, chips, meat mixture with can of refried black beans mixed in, and topped with more cheese.  I served it with optional sour cream, hot sauce, and chopped fresh tomatoes as toppings.  Everyone loved it.  Will surely make again. :)

This was pretty good, if you don't feel like putting out the whole Mexican meal thing.  Everything into a casserole dish and it tasted like a complete meal, with additions. I added 1/2 cup salsa to the mix, a layer of canned, drained red beans, then lots of cheese.  On the side, I had shredded lettuce and sour cream for a Taco topping.  Everything heaped on a plate and with some chips on the side.  It was a tasty change  for a quick week day meal.

This dish is wonderful, and I make it weekly for game night - when we have a group of 10+ over. When I make it for a large group, I double it and add two cans of refried beans. It makes it more filling and everyone loves it!

Tried this recipe tonight. I did modify a few things: used ground turkey instead of beef, added half a jar of salsa instead of tomatoes and chilies, used condensed tomatoes soup, added chopped olives, and used blue corn chips. So, I followed the recipe but used what I had on hand. It was yummy!

A great change to a typical casserole.  We only changed one thing, we used shredded cheese on top.  Next time we will probably use Taco seasoning on the meat though.

this was ok. I made it exactly as listed. I agree with some of the other reviews that changes would make this better.

This recipe has potential. Per another review, I heated the bottom layer of chips in the oven while it preheated, but they still ended up uncrunchy in the final dish. Next time, I would only put chips on the top. Also, I could have easily used a smaller dish than 9x13. I used shredded cheese, but forgot to add taco seasoning to the meat. Next time I will definitely do this. All in all, it is a good recipe to start with the begin tweaking for your family. For my one son who doesn't like things "mixed up" in his food, I'm going to try to sell this as walking tacos without the bag.

Fairly yummy, went over well with the teens. Quick and easy! Also I did use real cheddar cheese as the only change to the recipe. Recommended for a lazy or worn out after work evening meal.

Quick and easy to assemble and tasty!  I added an onion to the beef while browning along with some garlic powder and Italian seasoning blend.  I used shredded Tex Mex Cheese with jalapeno peppers.  To serve I added a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkling of green onions...I also served with some of the nacho chips for scooping.

It is fast to make, my family loved it, instead of using store bought salsa, I made my own. I plan on making this one again.

This is ok. The meat needs taco seasoning to add some flavor. Also, I add a can of enchilada sauce to the soup mixture to try to add flavor. It's ok for a quick meal, and is actually Weight Watchers friendly when using appropriate ingredients.

Thanks for the recipe, Kathy. My boyfriend and I both thought it was good.  I always go through the reviews before I make a dish-which is what I love about this site.  Just did a couple of changes. After browning the meat, I added mild taco seasoning to it. I used almost a whole jar of salsa in place of the tomates and green chilies. I also used 4 cheese mexican, shredded. Crumbled the chips and layered. To me it tasted more like frito pie.  Very good and filling.

This was a half & half recipe at our house.  My fiance and 10 year old son didn't like it AT ALL.  But my 3 year old daughter and I loved it!  I'll make it again for just her and myself, but will half the recipe.  I also used shredded cheddar cheese instead of sliced cheese.  And, I used a few home canned tomatoes and a portion of a small can of plain green chilis, as I didn't have what the recipe actually called for.

This recipe was so tasty. I added a pinch of cumin and about 1/2 tsp of onion powder to the ground beef while it was cooking. I served it with shredded lettuce, sour cream, and chopped green onions.  Instead of nacho chips, I used Doritos Brand Salsa flavor chips. They are spicier than the nacho variety. Very tasty!

Variations of this recipe have been floating around my extended family for ages, so I've been eager to try it. When I finally decided to make it I was short on a few ingredients, so instead of Cream of Mushroom I used cream of Chicken and Mushroom, and I ran out of Nacho Chips so I used Ranch flavored ones as well -about half and half. I also added a bit of onion, and some leftover shredded chicken that needed to be used. It was great! Very creamy and flavorful. It is filling and savory. I'm sure I'll make this again.
