I made 2 pies for our annual church dinner/bazaar (we serve over 2000 people) - I'm giving this 5 stars based on the fact I had people track me down in the kitchen asking for the recipe - the recipe caught my interest due to the added orange - I enter food competitions at the Iowa State Fair, and an old 4-H leader of mine always judged the pumpkin bars in the cookie division - her hint to competitors was that pumpkin always needed a little citrus to set it off - I guess she was right!!

Outstanding taste! The tangy sour cream and orange flavors really cut the richness of the pumpkin filling! This is the best "package label" type pumpkin pie recipe I've tried. I tweaked the recipe by using a premade graham crust and by lining it with shaved almonds before pouring in the pumpkin filling. The only glitch in the recipe is that the steps are out of order (!).

The filling is not too sweet and nice and creamy, not dried out. The sour cream topping adds a nice tang that complements the pumpkin really well!

I love pumpkin and I fixed this for Christmas 2006.  My family loved it. I was afraid my orange peel wasn't 'zesty' enough so I added 3 tsp of orange juice concentrate to both the filling and to the sour cream topping.  The orange is a really nice touch. I refrigerated it overnight, but let it come to room temp before serving it.   I will definitely make this again and not wait for the holidays.

I made my pumpkin pie as my usual way for me.  But added this recipes sour cream topping was excellent.
