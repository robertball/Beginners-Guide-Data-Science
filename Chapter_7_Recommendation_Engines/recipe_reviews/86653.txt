This is so good - I couldn't find muscovado sugar easily, so I subbed dark brown sugar with a big spoonful of molasses. I chilled the evaporated milk before using and it whipped up quite nicely and baked up well. So very tasty and sweet! 
I also used a crumb crust 'cause I had a bag of cookies to use up. Tasted good together.

Fantastic!  This was an English school lunch dessert in the 1970's.  A winner every time and a very true representation of a wonderful childhood memory.  Don't worry that it seems very 'wobbly' at the end of the cooking time - it will set.  However, it is at its very best if it oozes a little when cut!

This gypsy (gipsy) tart was in schools even before the 70's. I remember it from the 60's!! I have used ordinary brown sugar before, but lost the recipe as I am not an elephant. (I can never remember anything - unlike elephants who never forget - does anyone know where that saying came from by the way?).

I will try this version. Thanks. Clare

Exceptionally good. You can go back even further than the 60's I remember it in the 50's. I try not to make it often nowadays though as I have to watch my figure lol. An absolute delight.   Val

The taste is okay, but I think it needs to cook much more than 10 minutes. It is not even a pie, but liquid covered with a slightly firm crust.

Loved it' took me back to being a kid.
It very hard to find a descent evaporated milk for this recipie though.
Low fat rubbish will make this come out awful.
