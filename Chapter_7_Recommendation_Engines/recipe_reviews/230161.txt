I used this recipe on a combo of white trout & speckled trout that we caught off of our dock. It was delicious! Our son who does not like fish said that since we will eat fish again he would like it to be made like this recipe and that he prefers this recipe over fried fish. My husband loved the sauce and kept heaping it on. Our other son ate fish until the pan was empty. It was a huge hit at our house. I had some very spicy homemade BBQ sauce on hand that I used and I put a little extra BBQ in the sauce for extra flavor. I do not like my food to be mouth burning so I substituted smoked paprika for the cayenne. The fish turned out wonderfully moist and flavorful.

I used fresh red snapper and made the recipe exactly the way it is written. My husband and I loved it! I will definitely make this again.

This was pretty good, I would have liked stronger flavors, perhaps garlic?

Delicious and super easy.  I followed another reviewers idea and added paprika instead of cayenne, but I also sprinkled some red pepper flakes on top.

This was both easy and excellent. I used Jack Daniels hickory bbq sauce and mayonnaise made with olive oil, and served with a nice of orange bell pepper and couscous. The sauce is creamy, citrusy, tangy, and kinda sweet, and it complements the sweet red snapper. I broiled the fish for about 9 minutes on high.

The only change I made was to eliminate the cayenne pepper. Instead I dusted the fish lightly with a Penzy Barbeque powder.  Will definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe as is and thought it was great. It seemed as though it was a strange mixture  but I was looking to try something different  and was pleasantly surprised by how delicious it was. Being under the broiler it did create some smoke,enough to set off the smoke detector in my apartment. I didn't enjoy that part much but I will be making this again.

I must admit, this recipe didn't sound too appealing.  But I do admire Chef John and had never cooked red snapper before, so thought I'd try this simple recipe.  OMG!!  It was surprisingly delicious and even had a beautiful presentation.  I did add a tad of garlic and onion powders to the mixture.  I also discovered that I like red snapper.  Watch closely though, so it isn't over cooked!

This is delicious and easy.  You end up with a lot of sauce in the pan, which is delicious on rice.

This is the best recipe for something different on fish. I never tried red snapper before so I trusted chef John and I'm glad I did! My husband and I love it. Super easy and fast and healthy. Thank you!

This is the first time trying this recipe, I had bought some red snapper wanted another way to cook it The recipe was quick and easy to make. My family enjoyed it, I think I was heavy handed on cayenne though, but still tasty

Used a little black pepper instead of cayenne, otherwise made it as directed.  Wonderful and simple.

Basically mixed the mayo with salsa and it was a good toping with broccoli on the side. However the recipe said to cook 7  min, I cooked 9 and it really needed 11-12 min. 
The fish was undercooked

We've been trying to eat fish more often and also trying to get out of the rut of eating so much Atlantic salmon.  So the last month or two I've been buying whatever fish is fresh/on-sale and then I come home and hope Chef John has a recipe.  This one did not disappoint.  Super easy and quick.  The spicy, bbq-inspired flavors are definitely a different taste for a fish recipe so I wouldn't make this too often but it was a great change of pace.

I made this with cod, not having red snapper on hand. It 's an easy recipe that can be used in a pinch - it took less than 5 minutes to put together. I used the thinner part of the cod fillet, and it worked out well. The fish was moist, and although cod is a rather tasteless fish, it was good. Next time, I'd cut down on the mayo a bit, I found the combination of mayo and fish a bit jarring so just enough to balance out the bbq sauce. Thank you, Chef John, for sharing.

I had to use Basa fillets because red snapper wasn't available.  YUCk!  The sauce was lovely but the fish was not good. So three stars for now until I try again when I can get actual red snapper.  It's been a long time since I've seen snapper at the store so it might be awhile before I can try this recipe again.

Thanks Chef John for another great recipe. I used this on Whiting because that is what I had on hand, and it is fabulous. I paired this with Lemon Couscous and a Salad for a great meal!
