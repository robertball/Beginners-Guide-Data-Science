I loved the taste of this apple butter!  Really nice.  (I did it without the apple brandy and used apple cider instead.)  I also used a handheld mixer to make the texture creamier.

The original serving size, 96 serv., will make 15 half-pint containers.

This apple butter is amazing!  I multiplied the recipe by 7, making 21 jars to give as Christmas gifts-I was peeling, chopping and cooking ALL day!  The aroma in my house was incredible-my husband said he was hit by a 'wave of apple heaven' when he walked in from work.  The only complaint we have is the cost of the apple brandy.  To make 21 jars we spent $40 on brandy- it's great apple butter, but maybe I'll use 1/2 and 1/2 cider and brandy next time to cut our cost.  I also changed the spice amounts- I reduced the ginger to 3/4 tsp., upped the amount of cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp., kept the cloves the same, and added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg and two pinches of cardamom per recipe.  Lastly, I chopped my apples coarsely, and think next time I'll chop them finer-or when the recipe says 'cooked until easily mashed' I'll mash them-the recipe wasn't specific about that.  Thankfully, I had my boat motor (hand blender), and I just pureed it when it was all done cooking.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

Very tasty recipe, but one can NOT stress the importance of watching it carefully throughout the cooking process.  I followed the recipe religiously and badly scorched my first batch.   Also, I would suggest straining the apple mixture through either a fine/medium China Cap sieve, foley food mill or even a potato ricer to give it that perfect consistancy.

This recipe is wonderful. I subsituted apple brandy for apple cider because I couldnt find the brandy and it tastes heavenly. It is very popular in my house. Definitely something to put on the table for Thanksgiving dinner rolls!

Used a slow cooker-- on low for about 6 hours-- and it turned out great.  Couldn't find apple brandy in our area so substituted regular brandy.  Was a waste of booze, the regular brandy didn't change/add to the flavor (would have been ahead to drink it!).

I was raised in the south where apple butter is big.  This is by far the best I have ever eaten.  It is delicious apple butter with a little kick from the brandy and the spices.  Everyone in my family loved it, and I plan on making more to give as Christmas gifts.  I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe unless it would be to double or triple it, because it won't last long.  It's great on biscuits, toast or anything for that matter.  Thank you so much for the recipe.  It's a keeper, and I plan on making it for years to come.

Very flavorful apple butter.  I used core recipe.  Left apple skins on, used brandy, tweaked the spices. Used raw apple juice from farmers market.  Put in crock pot and when I got home from work it was ready for jars. Hubby says it's one of the best apple butters he has tasted.  I agree.

I give the taste a 5 and the texture a 2.5 - 3.  The texture was more like a very thick applesauce than a true apple butter.  The taste was wonderful after I tweaked the spices - just a dash of ginger, 1/2 t allspice and 1 1/2 t cinnamon.

This makes a great apple butter.  I got about 7 jars per batch and used the apples I had which were really small, not crabapples but about that size.  They had a flavor similar to Granny Smith.

This apple butter recipe was a BIG hit at our Thanksgiving!!  No reason to change the ingredients at all.  The apple brandy is a must.  After simmering for the initial hour I ran it through a blender.  Then returned it to the stock pot and simmered it for 7 hours.  The texture was perfectly creamy and thick like it should be.  The recipe calls for just 2 hours of simmering but I found that it needed 7 hours to get the right consistency.  I'll be making this recipe every year.  No reason to search for another or modify it.

I did the whole operation in crock pot over 2 day time period. Day 1 cooked apples down for several hours then shut off crock pot overnight. Next day put everything through blender, added sugar and spices and cooked with lid off, stirring often to help it thicken up. Yield was 4 1/2 cups of the best apple butter I have ever made.

YUM! This is excellent apple butter.  I used the crock pot and let it go overnight and beyond.  I skipped the ginger and added an extra tsp. of cinnamon.  I also substituted apple cider for the brandy.  When it was dark brown and the consistency that I was looking for I then used an immersion blender and made it smooth, canned it, and used a boiling water bath for 25 minutes.  My kids loved it.  The ultimate compliment was when my son said, "it tastes just like Silver Dollar City apple butter".  That is our favorite!  Thanks for the yummy recipe.

I expected out-of-the-ordinary taste and texture, given the ingredients list.  But mine just tasted like the usual apple butter.  To be honest, I had to substitute "Apple Jack" for the brandy.  The only apple brandy I could find was Calvados, and at $50 a bottle, it just wasn't going to happen!

WOW! This apple butter is amazing.  I have never had apple butter before, and I wanted to make is to go in the Apple Butter Pork recipe that is also on this site.  5+ stars for sure. What I did was half the recipe (I didn't want to make too much), and I used more apple cider instead of the apple brandy, but only half of what the recipe states.  I also used more cinnamon, and a little less ginger, and added a bit of nutmeg. After the first step I used a hand mixer to break up the apples, and after it was completely cooked I put it in a food processor to get the right consistency. Delicious!

Made this exactly to the recipe, and it turned out perfectly. I did pull it off the stove about 15 minutes early, because there just wasn't any more liquid to pull out. I recommend to everyone to just invest in the apple brandy, it adds wonderful flavor. I planned on trying the other five star recipe from this site as well, but now I really don't think that's necessary. Absolutely the best apple butter I've ever had, hands down. Thank you for sharing this recipe, it is a permanent addition to my recipe box.

Recipe was wonderful.  My kids are hooked on Applebutter now.  Did simmer much longer that suggested - until I received the thickness I was looking for.  I also skipped the applebrandy.

This recipe is SO amazing. I had to use a little less cloves, and I used regular brandy, because it was all I had. I made one batch and I really wish I had doubled or tripled it. My husband and I canned them in 15 half pint jars, using the hot water method. Making this was relatively easy,the only part that took a lot of time was actually peeling the apples. I am going to make this again and again, and my family and friends will definitely be receiving some for Christmas. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

There are no words for how good this is. I didn't have apple brandy, so I subbed apple cider. I also didn't have frozen apple concentrate, used 1/2 cup or so of apple juice instead. Didn't measure the spices, just shook them in the crock pot, used more cloves and other spices than called for. I cooked it with the lid on the crock pot over night (about 12 hours total), then another 12 hours with lid off. It could have cooked longer with lid off, but I got impatient and wanted to jar it. I have never had anything I love better made out of apples than this. Store bought apple sauce doesn't even come close to comparing. This stuff ROCKS!

Absolutly delicious.  The only thing i changed was adding about 2 tablespoons more of brown sugar.  I did cheat to mash the apples using a Braun sitck mixer.  I ended up having to make another batch the next day becuase it disappeared so quickly.

Very good taste.  I put it in a slow cooker on low for a total of 16 hours (all day for 8 and overnight for 8) and it looked burnt at the end but was done perfectly.

I followed the recipe with the exception of cutting the brandy in half (as some of the reviews suggested)and doubled it.  My family and friends have raved about the apple butter.  My youngest went after it with a spoon.  Thanks for the recipe this is a keeper!

This is a phenomenal recipe!  My whole family loves apple butter and this is the best we have ever had.  After the apples had stewed for an hour I put them through a food mill twice.  I also got a good quality of brandy and added a 1 TB of ground ginger and 1 TB of lemon.  I would probably drop the sugar just a little bit, and I left it in the pot for 2.5 hours after food milling it which thickened and caramelized it beautifully.  Fantastic!

This apple butter is absolutely Fabulous - the best I've ever had!  I followed the ingredients exactly.  I cored the apples but did not peel them to take advantage of the pectin in the peel.  When the apples were very soft I processed them through a food mill to remove the peels, then proceeded with the recipe.  I needed a quick dessert one evening.  I toasted thick slices of pound cake then topped with a generous dollop of apple butter and whipped cream.  My guests were very impressed and raved about the apple butter.  Tomorrow I'm making a triple batch to give as favors at Thanksgiving dinner. Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe!

Excellent, I doubled the amount of Cinnamon, and Cloves.  Added 2 tesp each of Allspice and Nutmeg. Wonderful.  You can easily adjust the spices to your taste.  I used a crock pot to prevent sticking and scorching, it worked wonderful and the house smelled terrific!
Will keep this recipe.

Added ground allspice. Switched frozen AJ with fresh AJ. Apple Brandy is key!

I could not find apple brandy. What I did was increase the apple cider amount by a half cup and used a half cup of Fireball Whisky. I took Barb's advice and cooked this in the slow cooker for about six hours. Turned out absolutely perfect. One of the best apple butter recipes I've made. Smells AMAZING when it's cooking.

Wonderful recipe!  Like others, I had problems finding apple brandy but I wanted to have some sort of liquor in there so I opted for an apple liquor (not schnapps!).  Very very tasty - thanks for sharing!

This is the best apple butter recipe I have ever run across.  I have been making apple butter for years and everyone thought it was great but this meets a new high.  I made a few changes in that I first make fresh applesauce and I cook it over night in my slow cooker with the lid vented so it will cook down and the next morning is is ready to can.

OMG is this good. But I am a lazy cook so Only suggestion is to skip....peel, slice and core....just quarter the apple, take off the stem and any ugly parts and cook on medium low with a little water in the bottom of the pan to keep it from scorching. Don't walk away...(takes about 30  mins)then when it is all mushy put the cooked apples through a foley food mill. the texture will be creamy. then continue cooking and add sugar and spice, till it is nice. I use golf ball size crab apples  and it has an amazing flavor

After you have cooked it for the full time, use your blender to achieve the consistency of real apple butter.  A little more tart than real apple butter, but very good flavor otherwise.

Great recipe.  Of course I never really follow a recipe just use it more as a guideline.  I had about 16 apples cored them (I left the skins on) and put them in the crockpot with 2 packets of  apple cider mix and 1 cup of water.  Turned it on low for 10 hours while I was gone for the day.  Upon return they were all cooked down and smelled wonderful.  I put them in our magic bullet and blended them all up until smooth.  I then put them in a sauce pan on the stove and mixed in half the thawed cider , cinnamon, ginger, brown sugar and 1 packet fruit pectin.  Stirred and heated until warmed and put into sterile jars.  Turned out beautifully.  Thanks for the recipe. PS I omitted the apple brandy.  I have since started using a immersion blended that I received as a gift.  Works wonderful to blend this recipe and soups as well.

This is amazing. I deviate from the directions only in the way that I had everything at one time and put in the crock pot all day or all night on low temperature. When the fluid is cooked off to the right consistenty, I put it in the food processor to make sure the lumps are all gone and then I can it.

I didn't have apple brandy, and it was Sunday in NC.  SO no way to go and get any.  So I just used more cider- and I added cardamon to the spices.  This is wonderful!  So rich and delicious.

Just finished making my 1st batch! my house smells wonderful & this recipe could not have been easier! i adjusted the spices to my family's liking, subbing allspice in place of cloves & reducing the ginger to 1/4 tsp. & i also could not find Macintosh apples in my area, so i used Honeycrisp apples instead... will definitely use this recipe for many years to come!

Outstanding, this will be my go to recipe for Apple butter.  I have three apple trees in my yard so I used a mix of ripened apples.  The only issue I have is controlling the hot splatter while reducing.  Burned myself the first go round, the second time I rested lid on a wooden spoon to keep the mess down yet let the steam escape. Seemed to take a bit longer to get the consistency I was looking for but has a great flavor.

I made exactly as written other than I used a food processor instead of mashing. Turned out great but the one downfall of this recipe is that I only got one quart which isn’t a problem unless you are planning to can for the future.  If so you might need to do as others have suggested and multiply accordingly. Will certainly enjoy what I have with some warm biscuits.

Oh my goodness!  This is the best apple butter I've ever tasted!
I followed the directions exactly and used my immersible blender at the end.

I've been looking for a really good apple butter recipe to make. I've tried various amount of recipes and usually tweaked it but I can't wait to try this one! For those who talk about having to watch their pot for it not to burn may I suggest a slow cooker crock. I have a digital one that I can set high low for so many hours and it's much better than doing it on the stove where you're always worried about it burning. I said it high for an hour with the lid on and cooks it really well. Then I set it on low with the top slightly off or turned sideways so that it can evaporate with stirring it just every once in awhile. I've even put it on at night on low and got up in the morning and found this beautiful ready pot of apple butter to jar. Those that are concerned about burning my try this instead this is so easy compared to on the stovetop it's a lifesaver.  I can tell by just seeing gradients it's going to be great stuff so I'm going to put a 4-star rating on it ahead of time.

I didn't use apple brandy, but that wasn't a missing ingredient...This was amazing! I just added more apple cider. I used honey crisp and gala apples instead of granny. I think it turned out better. I've been making this as a part of X-mas gifts & this is the 3rd yr. it's been requested.

Although I was unable to find the brandy this turned out great.  I used one unknown Apple variety a honey crisp and the other half fugi.  After cooking on the stove top I slow cooked it in a crock pot till I liked the consistency.  I've yet to try it with Macintosh apples but I do think the choice of Apple is key as it did not turn out as good using red delicious.

This was so tasty ( I might go get some right now) The flavor was right on it was super easy to make. I didn't have brandy so I used cider instead. I used McIntosh apples and kept everything as stated. When it stated to cook until easily mashed it confused me as to whether or not to mash then or later, so I partly mashed the apples and continued to simmer the last 2 hours before pureeing to my liking at the end with my hand blender thing. (can't think of its name!) Will definitely be making this again! I served it with Cinnamon Bread I from here also.......pure wonderful!

Used regular brandy instead of apple brandy, and it tastes great! Best apple butter I've ever had!

I've never tasted apple butter before but with a 40 lb box of fresh Okanagan McIntosh apples, I thought I'd give it a try.  I had to tweak the recipe a bit - plain brandy instead of apple brandy and apple juice instead of cider, with a crock pot time of nearly 18 hrs, but was the finished product ever amazing!!!  Friends who tried it are hungry for more, so I'm preparing a second, and possibly even third batch with the remaining apples.

Let me add to the growing number of 5-star reviews.

Like a few other reviewers, I couldn't resist tweaking it a bit.  

While the chopped apples (I used Pink Lady apples) soaked in lemon juice, I simmered the peels in the concentrate and cider for an hour.  This liquid was strained and the peels pressed, and THAT amber-red liquid was added (plus a little more cider to make up for loss) when the apple chop was cooked.  Oh, I also added scrapings from one vanilla bean in my 3x quantity.

With the firm apples I used, I still had some chunks after the 3 hours of simmering.  So I blended at the end.  Next time, I will chop the apples more finely. Lovely golden-red color!

I love, love, love this recipe! Since the Macintosh apples are out of season, I used Pink Lady apples and it turned out great! It wasn't very creamy, but, OH MY GOSH, is this apple butter delicious! I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe. But, since I want to create my own apple butter recipe, I will use this one to build on. I can't wait for the Macintosh apples to come back in season. This is the recipe to end all apple butter recipes. This is a golden one. Great job!

I've never made apple butter, but have made my fair share of applesauce.  With that being said, I was very skeptical it was going to turn out to a more runny, applesauce consistency.....boy, was I wrong!  It's thick and VERY tasty!  The only thing I changed was that I used regular Brandy in place of the apple Brandy, as its what I had on hand. It landed a fantastic taste to it, too!  I'm excited to can a bunch of it this next fall!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have been making this every year for at least ten years.  I don't use apple brandy but substitute with additional apple cider.  The taste and texture are indeed supreme. And it smells so good cooking!

I love this recipe! I ended up with 4 pints.
I will be making more.
I did add more spices to it, but that's who I am.
