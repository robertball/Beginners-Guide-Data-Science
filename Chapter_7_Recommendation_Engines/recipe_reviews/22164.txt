I ran across this recipe while searching for a cheeseless side dish to serve to my in-laws who were coming to dinner for the first time....my mother-in-law could not get enough of this.  The stuffing mix on top really makes this one!  Even my son who hates stuffing devoured it.  Simple flavors, easy to make.

This was very good. I used fresh broccoli and sauteed it with the onions. I subbed out the sour cream for 1/2 lb of Velveeta cheese and used crushed butter crackers for the top. Thank you Kristine. I will make this again!

This was very tasty. I did not have any stuffing mix so I used some seasoned crutons.

Delicious! My husband and I gobbled this up in not time. The only thing I will do next time is add a little more salt. I also added some black pepper and garlic powder. I will be making this one again.

I made this for dinner last night.  Not a morsel left in the pan.  I will definitely make this again!  Great variation for broccoli.

I have been watching my weight and needed a recipe that did not have cheese- I cheated a bit and added a sprinkle of parmesean on top and used crushed fat free croutons. Used Land o Lakes canola butter for the butter. I loved it and so did my husband. He said "save this one!" Going to try whole wheat flour next time, just to see if it can be done.

I was disappointed with this.  It was too oniony for me, and the flavor other than that was pretty bland.  I wouldn't make it again.

I found this recipe when looking for inspiration as to how to use the last few remaining foods in the house. This was a great combination of broccoli, soup, and stuffing! I used an onion soup mix with added cream, so I can't vouch for the specific recipe flavours but the idea is very good!

I was awesome, we changed a couple things, we used cream of chicken soup, and crushed croutons for topping with cheese.
