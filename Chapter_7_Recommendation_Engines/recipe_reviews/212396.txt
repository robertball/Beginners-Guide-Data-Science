this was very good, I used it for goose jerky.  I left out the liquid smoke, and used the smoker. Racks were full 4 hrs at 160 degrees. I can't wait to try it on deer.

This was one of the best jerky I have ever tasted. Hubby thought it was a little too sweet for him. He doesn't really care for sweet jerky much but I thought it was just amazing. I did use the same marinade which I put in the fridge a second time the following day to make more deer jerky and hubby really liked it. He said the flavors weren't as "intense". Thank you so much for this recipe.

This was very good - I have to admit though, that I'm always looking to find ways to use less salt so I used granulated garlic and Bragg Soy substitute. I also used more hot pepper sauce (tabasco) as we like it spicy.  It's also much easier to slice the roast if it's partially frozen making the slices more even.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

SO yummy! I marinated it for two days and then hung it in the oven to dry out. I used sriracha hot sauce and they were a tiny bit too spicy and I'm a huge fan of spice so that's saying something. Already planning on making another batch this weekend!

My husband hunts and I was looking for a way to prepare all the meat since I don't like venison AT ALL. I made this and it was gone in ten minutes! All my husband buddies from the hunt camp now give me their lean venison so I can make this jerky! You won't even know its venison! I added 1 tsp cayenne and it's perfect!  I've also used moose and bison with this recipe,

Delicious jerky! We like everything extra spicy, so I added 3 tbsp of sriracha sauce and a good sprinkling of hot pepper flakes. Decided to reduce the teriyaki sauce and sugar by two.

My dehydrator manual instructs "For food safety, to help insure any bacteria present is destroyed, post treatment of meat after dehydrating is required. Heat oven to 275 F. Line a large baking sheet with foil. Place jerky in a single layer, leaving a small space around each peace. Bake for 10 -12 minutes. Cool completely on wire rack. Pat jerky dry with paper towels to remove any surface fats before storing."

I have never followed the step before today, because  I worried that it would over dry the meat. I decided to take the extra precaution because I am pregnant. The jerky was wonderful. I will alway use this extra step now, just to be extra safe.

This is just as the Title says, Sweet And Spicy. My first batch was too dry, being lazy and not getting out the Dehydrator & used the oven. This batch I used the Dehydrator and it is 100% better. A very good mix of Marinade that should carry a title Tangy Sweet & Spicy! Very Very Good! Two Thumbs Up for this one!

I loved this recipe. I used it on 4 pounds of venison and let it sit over the weekend before dehydrating it. I also added an eighth of a teaspoon of ghost pepper flakes and it gave it a subtle back of the throat burn that really gave it that extra oomph. I loved it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good jerky recipe.

First time making venison jerky. This was awesome. Kids can't stop eating. Only thing I added was a cracked pepper rub sprinkled over before throwing into smoker. 
I was expecting 4 hours but ours was done at 2 hours.

I have made this recipe at least 10 times, and it's amazing. Each time I make jerky I do this one and try two more, and this one is always the winner. I use thick teriyaki sauce which makes it a little more sticky - delicious.

I tripled the recipe as I was making 5 pounds of deer meat into jerky. The jerky turned out delicious! I can't stop eating it! I will definitely use this marinade recipe again!

This jerky recipe is AMAZING!!!! My husband had very good luck hunting this year and we had more than enough venison and I needed to think of new ways to prepare it. We used our little Ronco simple dehydrator and left it in for more like 8-10 hours (maybe we cut it too think). It was gone the first day! It has a very nice sweet taste at first and a little spicy kick at the end. We will be using this recipe A LOT!

This was my first time making deer jerky and I'm glad I picked this recipe. It taste exactly how it sounds. I did make a couple adjustments, I used Louisiana Hot Sauce for the hot pepper sauce, ran out of paprika so I used 1/2tsp of paprika and 1/2tsp chili powder, and didn't use the teriyaki sauce. I also added honey and Tony Chachere's. I used venison hamburger meat since it was my first time and did not want to waste my steak or backstrap and the only problem with that stuff is getting it to stick together while coming out of the jerky gun. I only marinated it for about 12 hours before putting it in the dehydrator. I couldn't tell but my girlfriend doesn't eat venison very much and said she could taste the "deer" so you might want to add some milk to it if you dont eat venison very much. Highly recommend this one.

Excellent recipe!! Honestly the best jerky I have ever had. I did change one ingredient (due to not having it..).  Instead of 1tsp of hot pepper sauce I used 2 tblsp's of Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce.  I really liked the extra oriental flavor it gave.  Overall this is a wonderful recipe.  No more pre-made seasonings for this family!

I made this but did a lot of tweaking to the recipe and it turned out perfect. As others mentioned I cut the liquid smoke in half, doubled the pepper and added red hot pepper flakes. I did not have teriyaki sauce so I substituted that with soy sauce and a teaspoon of ginger powder. I also was unsure what hot pepper sauce was so I used 2 tablespoons of Sriracha sauce. It is so tasty!  Already marinating a second batch. I did not have a dehydrator but I used the dehydrator function on my Instant Pot Omni Plus and it didn’t get too dry at all!

I added some honey to the recipe. And the end product is sweet and good. Spice not there much so next time i make it i will double the spice part or add some crushed red pepper flakes.

Wow. This is a great recipe! A nice way to clear out some of the venison roasts have have been crowding the freezer. Like many of the other reviewers, I added a lot more hot sauce than the recipe called for, and also added a little more brown sugar. Delicious!

I used this recipe and shared the finished product with various people. So far everyone has loved it. The highest compliment came from a meat processor who makes jerky, he asked if I sold it and why I didn’t. He claimed it was the best he has ever had including his. 

I highly recommend this recipe to anyone who has a smoker for their jerky.

Not sweet enough and DEFINITELY not hot enough, and I doubled the hot sauce called for!  Next time I'll double the brown sugar, and quadruple the hot sauce, with possible a hotter sauce (I used good ol' Tabasco).  Lots more deer in the freezer from this season to try again!

Best jerky marinade I've ever used. II soaked the venison in saltwater overnight before marinating it. To cook/dry it I put in the grill for four hours  with a smoker tray/hickory chips.

I added a jar of Tabasco jelly to this recipe and added only 1/4 cup of brown sugar. Balanced out the sweet/spicy. My wife and I loved it!

I was excited because of all the rave reviews. It was way too sweet for my tastes. And it needed more oomph.

Made again. 2T sugar and 1 - 2 T Franks. No teriyaki so doubled the soy.

We love this recipe, the first time we made it we didn't add the lemon juice and it was still good we're making it again tonight and tomorrow with the lemon juice added and we'll see how that turns out.
