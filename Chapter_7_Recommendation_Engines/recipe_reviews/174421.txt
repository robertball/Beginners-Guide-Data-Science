This was quite an elegant, sophisticated recipe with an fabulous blend of flavors and textures.  It came together quickly while my tenderloin rested.  I followed the recipe exactly and probably won't change much next time.  I'm thinking of adding pinenuts just for fun!

Very good. We ended up adding a touch of brown sugar because we felt like it needed something only we couldn't put our finger on what it was, but that's just personal preference. It seemed to go over well at Thanksgiving dinner, and I would make it again.

This is such a lovely dish... delicious and elegant too. Dried cherries, which I'd never tried before, add a special flavor. I can see using dried cranberries however, so I'll try them next time around. We had it over couscous with grilled chicken/apple/maple sausages on the side.. the dinner got a big "Yum" from my 19 year-old and husband. Oh, one reviewer suggested adding pine nuts... great suggestion. Thanks for a keeper!

I wasn't sure about adding dried cheries on this dish, but I'm glad I took the risk because it turned out fabulous. The goat cheese gives a wonderful flavor.

Made the recipe as is, but omitted the mushrooms because I'm not too much of a fan of them. It was very good, but the cherries were a little too overpowering. I think I might use half as much the next time I make this.  I ate them with some whole wheat noodles and it was delicious.

We love this deligthfully different salad/side dish.
My only caution is to not get the spinach too wilted if you serve it as a salad. I have made this several times and one of my favorite sdditions is walnut pieces.

We enjoyed this.  The kids even liked it.  I think the cherries are a great addition here.  I found a new way to get my kids to eat something green!  (They requested that the next time I leave out the mushrooms though, because they don't like them).  Thanks for the recipe.

I was disappointed but I did not try any of the custom versions.  I'm sure whoever likes this that tried it did some tweaking.  Good luck.

What a wonderful surprise of a dish!  Made recipe as written - both my husband and I loved it.  A wonderful combination of savory, sweet and tangy.  A winner for us.

I loved this recipe! Like another reviewer, I too was hesitant about the cherries but they really do make the recipe.  I served this over some whole wheat pasta for a quick dinner. I also omitted the onions and mushrooms and used a lot of garlic; also added italian seasoning and olive oil to the pasta to make it really Mediterranean-flavored.

Wanting to have more than just steak and roasted veggies, I decided at last minute to give this a shot! Aside from skipping mushrooms (didn't have) and using gorgonzola cheese in place of goat cheese (again, didn't have), I followed this recipe and LOVED it! I was surprised how much the cherries added to this...tempted to skip it, but SO glad I didn't! I loved the sweetness and flavor it added to the other ingredients. What a wonderfully quick recipe that's adaptable to what you have on hand!

This was very good! I didn't have cherries so I used dried cranberries, and omitted the mushrooms. Also had no goat cheese so used feta. My husband didn't like the "hot salad" so much but I loved it!

I really was excited for this recipe and I am thinking that since it has such high reviews...maybe I did something wrong, because my hubs and I just did not care for this at all...and usually goat cheese and spinach are a couple of my favorite ingrediants. Thanks, anyway!

I've made this recipe many times now and love it just as it is. Its also great with dried cranberries instead of cherries, and with a touch of rice vinegar at the end. And if you need something *really* quick, it works without the mushrooms and onions. Its become a staple around here.

So good!  I used cranberries (didn't have cherries), added bacon bits and sugared pecans.  Did not require any additional dressing.  Definitely a keeper - thanks!

This was a nice recipe, definitely good for when you want something a little different. The one thing I did not like about it was the fact that the spinach came out very greasy. I think next time I will wilt the spinach with hot water, drain well then add to the rest of the ingredients. I will also leave out the cherries, but that's just my taste I guess.

Delicious! I didn't have cherries so I used cranberries, but I don't think it made much difference to the end result. This is definitely a keeper! I've thought of a few variations I'd like to try too - maybe some crumbled bacon or some balsamic vinegar for a more savory version.

I loved it! Even hubby and 3-year-old ate it. (left out the mushrooms and substituted dried cranberries for cherries). Hubby said it tasted like something from a restaurant. 3-year-old didn't like the goat cheese, but ate the rest. served with a curried chicken and rice.

I loved this, my family did not.  My kids didn't try it and my husband, who was excited to try it thinking it was something he would enjoy, wouldn't eat it.  I would make it again for myself and the only thing I might add would be toasted walnuts.

Excellent recipe and really easy to change up the amounts without ruining it, making this something your family would enjoy. Pairs well with the Mediterranean Chicken with Eggplant recipe on this site.

I didn't use goat cheese.  I used Feta.  I would use more than one container next time because the spinach can reduce down to very little if you're not careful!

It was good but not great, so something of a waste of the cherries I felt. I would double the goat cheese. Everyone at the table felt the goat cheese was the best contrast in the dish.

Delicious!!! Where has this been my whole life? A fantastic combination of flavors. The spinach cooks down quite a bit though, so if you're big veggie eaters, plan on it making half as many servings as it states. Also, I tried refrigerating an extra serving that already had the goat cheese on it and it reheated very well. Everyone in the lunchroom was jealous today when I brought my leftovers in. :)

It is very simple but very tasty. I kept thinking it was going to need sauce or dressing but it didn't at all. I will make this the next time I have guests for dinner because it's colorful, looks and tastes good. I used craisins instead of cherries.
