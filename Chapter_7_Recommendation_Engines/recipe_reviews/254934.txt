I have never left a review on something I made from Allrecipes.com which is almost daily.  This recipe was a keeper!  Hands down the best blueberry muffin recipe I have ever made, and threw away the other 10 recipes I had in my binder.  I ended up making 2 batches because the first one disappeared so quickly.  I don't know if it is the same thing but this recipe called for table creamer which I did not have but I did have heavy whipping cream and used that instead.  Also, in the second batch I added a tablespoon of lemon juice and well, it was just as amazing as the first batch.  This needs to be tried by everyone!

8.16.16   Followed the recipe exactly as written, and I wouldn't change a thing.  These muffins were just loaded with blueberries and bursting with sweet, fresh fruit flavor.  They were some of the best muffins I've had in a long time.  They did take a little longer to bake, 20 minutes.   That whipped cream cheese is an ingredient I've not before seen in blueberry muffins, and maybe that's what makes them special??   Don't know, just know they were a total hit in this house.   Giulyfafuly, thanks for sharing your recipe.

This was doubling the recipe:                                     Doubled everything in recipe except below follow instead:   Used 8oz cream cheese plus 1/3 c sour cream instead of whipped cream cheese. Used heavy cream instead of table cream. Used melted 1/2 c butter plus 2 tbsp canola oil instead of all vegetable oil. Had to bake 22min. Used nonstick muffin tins. Buttered tins just slightly. Not Pam spray.

Really good! They are moist, but light . . . and not too sweet. I did need to bake these a little longer - closer to 20 minutes. I never know how full to fill the muffin cups. I filled mine about 3/4 full, and got 15 muffins - but I wish I would have put a little less batter in each cup  (like 2/3 full). These were tasty, and I will make them again. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good!  No need to add or change anything.  I however, put too many blueberries in, and the muffins were a bit too moist.  Tasted great though. Next time I will put less blueberries in, and I am sure they will be perfect. Great recipe! Quick and easy.  Did require the 20 minute bake time, as mentioned in other reviews.

These disappeared when I brought them to work.  A few people came back to take a second one and said these are the best blueberry muffins they ever had!  Really good, and easy to make.   For the "table cream," I used half-and-half.  Someone suggested filling the muffin cups about 2/3 full before baking, which was perfect.  They took longer to bake than the recipe says (close to 20 minutes).  Thanks for the great recipe!

What's not to love about these muffins!?!  Love the texture and flavor....my hubby devoured 4 before I could stop him!!!!  Wasn't too fond though of the measurements of the recipe:  3/4 teaspoon, 2/3 cream cheese, etc.????  But I did my best in following exactly as written and they turned out in spite of me and the recipe!  Also mine did take longer to bake than the 10-15 minutes.  More like 20.  All in all a real keeper!  I know my grandchildren coming will gobble them up in no time.  Oh....and just for the record mine made 1 1/2 dozen full size muffins.  I could have gotten 2 dozen smaller ones.

Followed the recipe exactly as written. A great muffin recipe as I was looking for something to use up cream cheese. The cream cheese gave these muffins a tangy almost cake texture which was delicious. The blueberries all sank to the bottom of the muffin tin? Going to try dusting them with flour next time prior to adding them to the mixture.

Light and fluffy muffins that somehow remind me of twinkies!  I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla.

This recipe was fun and easy to make. We gave it 3 stars because when the blueberries were baked it tasted bland and sour.

Just made this recipe.    It's excellent!.  Full of blueberries and very light.  If you want a heavy muffin don't make these.   I made the recipe as written and they turned out great.  Want to try using sour cream instead of the table cream next time.

Made these muffins and they turned out great. I followed the  directions to a T but found that I had to increase the time in the oven by ten minutes.

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe, came up a bit short with cream cheese and added sour cream to make up the difference.  will be doing that every time I make them now!  The blueberries don't sink to the bottom either

I rated it a 5 out of 5 stars. I thought that it was an amazing recipe and I wouldn't change the recipe at all. I feel like the number of blueberries was just right for the recipe.

With blueberries out of season I ended up using frozen ones. After thawing I dried them on paper towels as much as possible and added them at the very end and they worked relatively well, can't wait to use fresh ones though. Everyone loved them, thanks for the recipe.

I'm writing these immediately after tasting. Best muffin I've ever had. I whipped the cream cheese like crazy and sifted the flour twice to get a light texture. I also used soy milk instead of cream and it came out wonderful.

Delicious.  Obviously not low fat, but delicious.
I may try to see if the wonderful texture and flavor can be maintained if I use lower fat content, but this recipe will be worth making once in a while even if  it needs to remain with all the lovely cream.

Wow! Best muffin recipe ever, moist, easy to make. I doubled the recipe and used half to make a coffee cake.  Even plain these muffins are awesome. You cannot eat just one.

Wow! I’m so glad I made these, they’re perfect! Super moist and delicious without being too sweet. Made these with my kids and they love them too. We used heavy cream instead of table cream and a cup of frozen blueberries and baking took a little longer than 15 minutes, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. This will be our muffin recipe!

Made them twice. Used a little bit less of blueberries for the second time as it was way too soggy at first. Also took 20-25 mins in the oven to get them done.

The results were awesome! I wish there were more in depth instructions for the recipe itself but I love the way these turned out. Very moist and not too sweet. This was my first time making blueberry muffins from scratch.

These muffins were the bomb! I used half and half as my cream since it was all I had, and they were delicious. Like other reviewers said, I needed to cook them for a full 20 minutes in my oven. Great way to use up the cream cheese in my fridge, and very very tasty. Made 14 muffins for me (filled 3/4th of the way up).

By far the best Blueberry recipe I have ever made!  So moist and flavourfull!!!  They last 2-4 days in a container... unless your family devours them!  Will never use another Blueberry muffin recipe again!

Made these this afternoon with my three year old daughter using some leftover blueberries from last week's farmers market. We're delicious warm with a glass of milk. Only issue was a lot of the blueberries sank to the bottom of each muffin. Easy recipe that we'll definitely do again.
