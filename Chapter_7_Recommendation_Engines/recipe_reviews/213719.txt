Tasty enough ~ made this exactly as written except that I only used 1/2 the quantity of serrano, because it's hotter than jalapeno (usually). Surprisingly, though, the guac was mild! It would've been better if I'd cut mango into tiny pieces. I refuse to waste the onion-flavored lime juice - use it in another guac, in a Bloody Mary, in a salad dressing, or in an Indian mint/cilantro chutney!

Delicious.  I've had mango salsa before and wasn't a big fan. This, however, is SO much better, in my opinion.  The mango flavor and texture blends very well with the rest of the ingredients.  The ONLY thing I did differently was that I wanted to use my own peppers,  so I added some of my own, dried, to the onion and lime and let it rehydrate them.  I didn't have any fresh peppers other than jalapeno, and I didn't want to use those. :)  Other than that, I followed the recipe, and won't change anything when I make it, again! Thank you.

This is a wow recipe. I made the mistake in not seeding the peppers before putting them in the food processor. WOW wholly Hot Chia-wa-wa!! But the sweetness of the mangos made a nice addition to flavor with the cilantro. I'd make this again but cut down on the pepper seeds. My 13 year old child loved it.

This is a refreshing change from the usual guacamole. The amount of lime juice makes it fairly tart. I would probably reduce that a bit next time. I love, love, love the mango addition. Great recipe!

Wow, delicious!  But easy, too.  My 7 year old daughter loved helping scoop the avocado into the food processor.  The mango was a yummy twist.    If you like more of a kick, add another pepper.  YUM!!!

The mango is what makes this guacamole so special, I think. They add a touch of sweetness and color, and that unexpected flavor that makes everyone just rave about it. I think soaking the onion in lime juice must really take the raw bite out of it, it was a brilliant thought. This recipe is a big hit in my circle of friends!

I'm not usually a fan of guacamole but this one changed my mind! I loved the smooth texture of the avocado and the chunks of mango throughout. Soaking the onions in lime juice took out the bite, and the serrano chiles added just the right amount of heat. I can't wait to make it again!

I gave this recipe a 4 because i followed the recipe exactly as it says and I found that the tastes of the mango and guacamole were a bit strange. Interesting recipe though. I would still reccomend

I made this for a St. Patrick's Day party (I thought the green would be nice) and it was a huge hit!  The recipe says it serves 8 but the party I took it took was attended by approximately 20 people and I brought 1/2 home.  Of course there were other snacks and I didn't mind bringing it home at all.  None of it went to waste.  I will definitely make this again and again.

This is a very interesting guacamole. We loved the taste and the texture. Some people mentioned that their guacamole turned out sweet or tart, mine were just perfect. But the taste is a little unusual, you can`t serve this on anything. I guess tortilla chips would be a great thing to serve with, if not the one.

I wish I could give this a higher rating!  I wasn't sure about adding mango to a guacamole, but this is terrific.  The flavors balance beautifully.

I really enjoyed both preparing and eating this tasty Mango Guacamole recipe.  I grow my own key limes, mangoes, and peppers, so it was exactly what I was looking for.  It was easy to follow the recipe and have a great result.

I used the food processor as described, however, it didn't to a very good job of chopping up my serrano.  Instead, I took the pepper out and diced it very finely before throwing it back in and adding the avocados.  I adjusted the salt to taste.

The result was a creamy guacamole that tasted good on its own (before adding the onion, mango, and cilantro).  But once I finalized the recipe by folding in the final three ingredients, it went from good to great.

I really liked the balance in this recipe.  Cooling avocado, tangy lime, sweet mango, and just the right amount of heat.  Perfect with chips, and in my case it was awesome with chicken/black bean empanadas!

Super! Perhaps a little too much lime juice, but that's just my preference. Delicious as a snack with tortilla chips or as a sandwich/burger/taco topping!

This is so good! Fresh peppers are not available here so I used ground chipotle chilis instead. I made it very mild for my 3 year old. Everyone that came for supper loved it! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

LOVED IT! I had never made my own guacamole before and I'm glad I chose this to be my first (Thanks, Kelly)! This was very simple to prepare and I just loved the sweetness of the mango in it. I did omit the cilantro, I just can't stand it, lol, but kept everything else the same. I will definately be making this VERY often! Thanks for sharing. :)

Delightful pairing of the sweetness of the mango and the the serrano.  Would temper down the limes-I used my own Mexican limes from my tree-perhaps a little strong and would cut the ingredient measurements to half-served it for a crowd of 10 at a recent board meeting 
and still came back with over half left. But what a great way to use up my Hayden mangoes-mahalo!

Made it, love it. People are strange I fail to see how because YOUR mangos weren't ripe enough you feel the need to put less starts on the review. Maybe get riper mangos and then review it. Dont knock down the stars on a good recipe.

Delicious, and I enjoyed the mango difference, but it was a lot of work. Next time, I will just chop the peppers and mash the avocados instead of putting them in the food processor. I think it will turn out just as well, with a lot less mess.

Amazingly refreshing!  Didn't have serrano chile but did have jalapeño.  Will use serrano next time.  Added two small cloves garlic, and lessened lime juice.
