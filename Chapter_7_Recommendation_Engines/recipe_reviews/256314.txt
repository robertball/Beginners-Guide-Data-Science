1.11.17   Seriously, don’t know if this is a joke or for real, but it was published, and I did make it.  One suggestion if you decide to make this labor-intensive recipe:  use white sugar instead of confectioners sugar.  I’m laughing as I do this review, but who knows, it just might be something the kids like.  It’s winter, why not just use snow?????
