This was delicious! I suggest adding more lemon and garlic.

I liked the change in flavor of adding arugula- not overpowering, just a different flavor.   I had to add some water because it was too thick for my processor to mix well, and I increased the lemon but the rest I did according to recipe.  I thought the garlic level was fine, but I had used good sized cloves.  Pretty tasty!

Loved the peppery addition of the arugula and I agree, more garlic for sure. Will make this again!

Tasty and pretty hummus. 
I had to make changes to use up more arugula and only had dried garbanzo beans. Nice flavor and very bright color. It would be nice as an appetizer with a few whole garbanzo  beans, chopped arugula, and a drizzle of olive oil on top. 
It was tasty with pretzel sticks but pita bread would be better.
