This is a great recipe as a starter recipe but it is recipe for empanadas and she is using egg roll wrappers which depending where you live may be easier to find. Sub out the velveeta for real cheddar cheese and it is very good. Get rid of cooking ground beef with oil and only use 1/2 pkge of taco mix or make your own.

This was an awesome recipe.  My husband loved them.  There was extra so the next day I warmed them up with just a pan, no oil and they got crispy again.

Only 4 stars simple because I used skirt steak strips, Mexican cheese & chopped roasted poblano peppers. I also just wet my fingers with water and these were Fast n Easy! I heated up a bit of lard, these were done in no time at all. Love these!
