I had some really flavorful cantaloupe which needed to be used up, grilled chicken was on the menu today, so I thought this would be the perfect topper for it.  The sweetness of the cantaloupe contrasts perfectly with the heat of the jalape√±os and the pungent lemon and lime juices.  This would be great on tortilla chips, but it was awesome on grilled chicken breasts today.

Really good. I did tweak it only because I only had a little bit of cantaloupe and I wanted to finish it up. Used a regular onion. Substituted parsley from my garden for the cilantro which I did not have, 1 small green pepper from my garden. Again because I did not have yellow pepper on hand. Also substituted hot cherry peppers from my garden as I did not have jalapeno peppers. I also substituted fresh cherry tomatoes for the canned diced tomatoes and cut them in half Did not use garlic as we were going out and did not want "garlic breath". Otherwise, I probably would have used a small clove. I also cut back to 1 Tbsp. of the lemon, and lime juice because I did not have that much cantaloupe. I used this salsa over baked codfish and it really was delicious.

This is so good.  I had to leave the garlic out because I live with a vampire but it is still delicious.  We are having it with shrimp tacos for dinner, but it is good enough to eat by itself with a spoon.
