I followed the recipe to the letter.  It will not roll.  The batter is very light and it wasn't done in 10 minutes so I baked it an extra 5 minutes and it still wouldn't roll.  It tastes great though but not worth the time.

I give this 4 stars for flavor.  I maked this as a roll but it did not turn out at all.  The texture of the cake is of a chiffon, so when I re-made this recipe I used cake pans.  The cake turned out wonderful and the residence at the retirement community I work at just loved it.  In fact many of them didn't believe that the cake was sugar free.
