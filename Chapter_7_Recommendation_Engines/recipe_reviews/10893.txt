This a great cookie for cookie exchanges. I've baked them now for the last 3 years and everyone enjoys them. A basic recipe - easy to adjust if you're adventurous. I like to dip one side in red or green sugar just before baking. Excellent for Christmas!

Great cookie simple and easy to make ahead. I did use baking powder at 1.5 tsp instead and pecans-because I had them. Seems like you could change this up many ways.

I thought these were great! I followed the recipe to a T and put them in the freezer. When I needed cookies I sliced them just like I had brought them from the store. I baked mine about 20 minutes until they were done. Great flavor and nice to have in my freezer. Thanks!
