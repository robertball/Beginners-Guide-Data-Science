I have made this per recipe directions, but I now make it a little different (if you see how many calories for one serving, you'll know why I changed it a little. 525 calories for 1/12th of a cake? Who cuts it into that small of pieces....LOL)
I use fat free sour cream,  sugar free pudding and use 1c of no-sugar added applesauce instead of oil & egg beaters in place of eggs . It still tastes GREAT and you reduce the calories to about 290 calories a serving and the fat by OVER 1/2 per serving! (my husbands male co-workers ask for me to send this in about once a week and they have no idea it is 1/3 less calories, 1/2 the fat and less sugar then original recipe I sent in before) The orginal version is 6300 calories for the whole cake and 432 grams of fat. The reduced version is 3570 calories and 180 grams of fat for the whole cake.

Two stars as written, simply because having made variations of this recipe many times I was familiar with it enough to know that a full cup of oil is not only unnecessary, but excessive. Using 1/2 cup of oil ups this to 4 stars. I used this as the base for "Ho Ho Cake," also from this site. In addition to the reduction in oil, I used a devil's food cake mix and, for oomph in chocolate flavor and to disguise that "cake mix taste," I used 1/2 cup of brewed coffee for the water and added 1 tsp. of chocolate extract. Moist and tender crumb, richer and more flavorful than just using the standard cake mix directions.  This was just perfect for what I was looking for.

I give this recipe an excellent review BUT I learned something on the second try.  When I used the recommended mini-chocolate chips they disappeared into the cake when baked.  Next time I used chocolate chunks and they were obvious in the prepared cake which is what I was trying for.  Extremely moist and delicious!

This just is really good. Make sure you use a devil's food cake mix. I also used dark chocolate chips and hot coffee for the water. It really intensified the chocolate taste. I also put a chocolate glaze on it but it really can do well with just a pretty dusting of powdered sugar. Why anyone would want to make this light I do not know. Live a little! Eat less, move more, and eat a variety of what you like in moderation people! Cutting corners by using light stuff or sugar free junk just isn't going to cut it. You won't be satisified and you'll eat more anyway. A little piece of this cake goes a long way.

I lightened this cake up considerably, and it was still very, very tasty!  I used devil's food cake mix, sugar-free, fat-free pudding, egg-substitute and light sour cream. Instead of using 1 whole cup of oil, I used 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/4 cup canola oil.  Even with all these changes, it was still moist and delicious!  I made it in a 9 x 13 pan and baked for only 25-30 minutes.  For a tasty frosting, I used the 'Luscious Buttercream Frosting" from this site, adding 1/2 cup melted semi-sweet chocolate chips to the mix before spreading it on the cake. Yum!

Wow!!!  This is fantastic!  It's flavorful, moist and dense, yet somehow light and just basically wonderful!  AND i even made the recipe MUCH lighter in calories, so i'll share what i did for those of you who don't want the calorie-overload that the original provides.  I used fat-free, sugar free chocolate fudge pudding mix with triple chocolate fudge cake mix (already has some chocolate chips in the mix!). I used fat-free sour cream and only 1/2 cup applesauce instead of the oil.  Also, i only added 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips to the batter (because the mix already had some).  with these "lightening" adjustments, i only had to bake it for about 38 minutes, but after cooling in the pan for about 15 minutes, it came out easily and perfectly done!  i glazed it with a combo of 1/2 cup chocolate chips, 2 T. butter and 1 T. corn syrup, but honestly, that was the only "iffy" part of this glorious cake.  believe what they say ... it really DOESN'T need icing, cuz the cake part is that good!!  so i'd suggest just tossing that extra 1/2 cup chips into the batter as well.  anyway, i wanted to post this review for all of you wanting to make this cake but wary of it's super high-calorie content.  with these adjustments, it makes 12 (BIG) pieces at only 360 calories ... not too bad for the awesome texture and taste!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was the hit of the dessert table. Everyone raved over it, with two people telling me it was the best chocolate cake they ever had! It was also the first dessert to disappear, so I know everyone loved it. I followed the recipe exactly, but after the cake cooled I melted a can of ready made chocolate fudge frosting and drizzled the top of the cake with it, then sprinkled mini chocolate chips on the glaze. It looked as good as it tasted! I think this is going to be my new standard recipe when I want to make a chocolate dessert.

I love this recipe!! The frist time I made it was for a cake action for 4-H and my cake sold for $175. Later I made it for a potluck and before I could get any it was gone. I suggest to drizle white chcolate on top to fancy it up.

This cake got RAVE reviews! I am definitely saving this recipe.  It's so easy to just throw everything into a bowl and mix it like that!  I used a devil's food cake mix and when the cake was finished, I poked holes all over the cake and then poured melted frosting all over it.  Then dusted with powdered sugar.  Good stuff!

I made this cake today and had a piece tonight.  I followed the recipe as is but didn't have any mini chocolate chips - only the regular size.  You could actually taste (and see) the chips in the cake.  I baked at 350 for exactly 1 hour and let it cool in the Bundt pan for another hour. Then I inverted it onto a cake plate with a cover and let it cool completely before covering it.  This cake was so MOIST.  Right before serving I dusted it with a little powdered sugar.  If you follow the directions as stated, you will have one of the most decadent chocolate cakes.  Thanks for the recipe Lisa, this will definitely become my standard "chocolate cake".

HEALTHY VERSION WINS TASTE TEST!  I made 2 cakes and brought them to work for a blind taste-test (they were marked only as 'A' and 'B').   I made the first as printed with the only change being 1/2C oil, coffee instead of water, and chunks of semi-sweet chocolate for the chips.   The other (healthified) with with equal swaps of sugar free chocolate pudding, no sugar applesauce for oil, egg white for whole eggs, greek yogurt instead of sour cream, no chocolate chunks and coffee instead of water.  Not only did 50% of tasters guess incorrectly on which was healthy, but 100%said the healthy version tasted better!  It was awesome to do a true blind taste test for something like chocolate cake!  Score one for the fat-cutters! :)

Delicious & easy!  I also used Devil's Food cake mix, reduced oil to 1/2 cup, and 1/2 cup hot coffee instead of water. Used regular sized choc chips since that is what I had. Topped it with melted milk chocolate frosting. We ate it warm with Peanut Butter Fudge Swirl ice cream and it tasted just like Chili's Restaurant Molten Chocolate cake! Fantastic!

My guests and I enjoyed this cake - it's definitely just a "jazzed up" box mix, but since I like boxed cakes, I was okay with that. If you have an aversion to boxed mixes, you might not be totally wowed. I used devil's foox mix, only 1/2 cup oil per other reviews, and regular-sized chocolate chips (recommended if you want to see "fudge" bits in the cake). Baking for 60 minutes in my oven was a bit too long - would go for 50 next time. Drizzled with satiny chocolate glaze from this site - a nice touch that makes the cake look elegant!

If you haven't made this cake yet and love chocolate you have to try it at least once. I make exactly as the directions state. Perfect! My family and friends always look when I come to see if I brought this chocolate chip cake. I bake in square, round, and rectangle pans all the time to use as birthday cakes. Everyone loves it! Thank you for the recipe!!!

I have made this about six times now. My family DEVOURS it. At Christmas I made it with mint chips and that was delicious too. I don't add any frosting or glaze to it. This is the moistest, fudgiest cake. My family calls it the molten lava cake. Five thumbs up!

SO delicious!  Next time I will cook it for about 5 minutes less, but other than that the recipe is fabulous (using devil's food cake mix as suggested).  Although the cake tasted good out of the oven, it tasted simply amazing the next day.  Next time I make this I will do it a day ahead of time, cover with reynolds wrap and then serve it at its perfect moistness the next day.

This cake is so good and moist. I made it for my daughter's birthday and used a 13x9 inch cake pan and cooked it for 48 minutes at 300 degrees (I have a really old gas oven that gets too hot), cut into the shape of a guitar and used cream cheese icing to decorate it. We couldn't stop eating the scrap cake pieces when I was cutting it! I used regular sized chocolate chips because that's all my dinky little grocery store had. Still so yummy! We'll see how the party guests like it tomorrow. I'm sure they'll love it, best cake I made yet! Thinking about making cupcakes out of this recipe too. Thanks Lisa!

Have been making this cake for over 30 years. As another reader noted, 1 cup oil is excessive. 1/2 cup is more then enough.

I made this exactly as listed. I used Pillsbury moist chocolate cake mix. It turned out perfectly! Everyone who tried it loved it. It was very rich, so I chose not to dust it with powdered sugar. Leftovers store very well in the refrigerator, and the cake retains it's awesome moistness. Cupcakes can also be made from this recipe. Just adjust the baking time to ~ 20 min. One recipe makes about 3 dozen cupcakes. This is perfect for portion and calorie control...if you can eat just one.

Really good, really moist, rises perfectly. Needs a tad bit more chocolate chips (I used normal size). It also needs a frosting. Maybe something more chocolaty to begin with than Devil's food cake would be good.

I have had many versions of this before and have to say, it is my husband's favorite.  I am very big into "homemade".  Unfortunately, you just can't beat this cake!!!

This was easy to make and delicious. To continue the decadence, I covered it with chocolate frosting. Yum!

I made this cake recently for a family gathering.  Among the other 3 dessert options I prepared, this one was the hands-down favorite!  This baked perfectly in my Angel Food cake pan.  Very moist and delicious.  After reading the reviews, I substituted the hot water for coffee.  I also used Devil's Food cake mix, following the box for the amount of vegetable oil to avoid a soggy cake.  I used chocolate chunks instead of chips.  I had some sour cream but also mixed in some Greek yogurt I had on hand as well.  Lastly, I melted a container of chocolate icing in the microwave and drizzled on even more chocolately goodness!  Yum!  Everyone loved it because, as well all know, chocolate lovers are everywhere!

This cake is beautiful! Super moist and tasty! My entire family went mad over it, and my dad who doesnt have much of a sweet tooth said, verbatim, "S**t, this is  good cake!" and cut himself another huge slice! Will definitely make it over and over

This is one of the first recipes I made since visiting this website in 2006.  It is easy to make and delicious.  My family along with coworkers just love it! I, as with other readers, sprinkle sifted 10X sugar to dress it up. I can always count on allrecipes.com when I am looking for ideas; whether it is a new recipe or one of the many I come back to all the time - like this one!

Very moist.  Very good.  It doesn't take as long to bake as noted.  Check after about 40 minutes to make sure not to overbake.  I used a 9x13 pan.

Excellent- my reluctant coworker who was trying to avoid a piece said, "This chocolate cake is to die for! And i don't care if my pants cut off all the circulation in my body! I'm glad I ate it!"

I loved this cake, I made it for my birthday, and my whole family enjoyed it. I was a little wary of the sour cream, but it added a really rich texture. I would suggest this cake for all occasions.

I followed this recipe exactly. It was very easy. The outcome was a simple, almost brownie like cake. I had hoped that it would be a bit more moist. It had a nice taste to it, just a bit plain.

I was looking for a good cake with no frosting since the boyfriend doesn't like it, and this was excellent.  I used butter cake mix, vanilla pudding, and an entire package of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  The only changes I made were that I used a sheet cake pan and coated the chips in flour before mixing them in so that they wouldn't sink to the bottom. This tasted like a giant moist chocolate chip cookie! Thank you so much this was incredibly easy and everyone loved it!

This gets four stars for ease.  I followed the recipe to a T and I just felt it tasted 'store cake mix'y.  I would make again in a pinch if I was pressed for time.  It was not yucky....just.....normal.

Great cake. Made it with vegetable oil and another one with canola oil. The canola oil one was much more moist.  Kids and adults love it and say it tastes like oreos!

I used this recipe twice, once for 3 tier birthday cake, I shaped as pig with strawberry buttercream, and one for cupcakes that i topped with peanut butter frosting.  It is so versatile.  I tend to use Duncan hines, both the devil food and dark chocolate varieties work great.  I highly recommend this recipe if you are crunched for time and have something that takes a while to decorate, this way the focus is less on the cake preparation. (but the flavor, moisture, texture is superb.)

This cake was super moist and beautiful without any alteration to the recipe.  However, to make it extra special, I made a chocolate glaze icing to pour over it. I made it with one bag of Hersheys
Special Dark Chocolate lightly sweetened chocolate chips, melted with half a stick of butter and about half a cup of clear Caro corn syrup.  Melt it all together over medium heat until all the chips are melted.  Pour this overtop this already wonderfully moist and delicious cake and you will have a chocolate explosion!  A holiday favorite at our house and suitable for any time of year.

I made this two nights ago for my boyfriends birthday. I did not change a thing as far as the ingredients are concerned and it turned out wonderfully.  Everyone loved it.  It was very moist. I used it in two 9" round pans and made a 4 layer cake with my own frosting.  I will definitely make this a keeper! Thanks!

This is a wonderful chocolate cake recipe; the only thing I do different is use a 1/2 of hot coffee instead of water.  Everyone loves this recipe.  When I use it for a birthday cake I make 3 layers and use raspberry frosting.  Thank you Lisa, for sharing this really yummy recipe!

I use the normal sized Ghirardelli chocolate chips and replace half of the oil with applesauce.  It's my go-to chocolate cake recipe and the only one I even make anymore.  Delicious!!

Just prefect!!!  This cake is so moist. I know everyone, even myself likes to change or modify recipes but I wouldn't change a thing.  I did make it twice. And founnd that 60 min in my oven was to long-  50 min was prefect.  i guess it just depends on the oven.  other than that- don't mess with this one. LOVE IT!

So easy to make!  I used 1/2 cup veg. oil + 1/2 cup applesauce instead of 1 cup veg. oil.  And I also used 1/2 cup hot coffee instead of hot water.  It came out great for our Thanksgiving dinner table...Thanks for the great recipe and good tips from the other reviewers!

I have just baked this cake for the second time (Valentines Day present for my husband) and I've got to say, all the rave reviews are completly TRUE! I think I can safely say that I will never make a chocolate cake from a mix the rest of my days. I took one of the reviewers suggestion and used coffee in place of water the second cake and it definitely made it taste AND smell more chocolatley ... go figure! There was not one hang up. It baked exactley what the recipe said. It's firm and comes out of the pans perfectly and I used another reviewer's suggestion of cream in the icing instead of milk and it was "over the moon" good as a fully put together cake. Now ... if I can just find a perfect duplicate for a white cake and I'll be in baking heaven!!

I use PLAIN yogurt instead of sour cream. Make sure it is plain,unsweetened yogurt though! It tastes delicious. I bake mine for 45-50 minutes though. Just until the center springs back when gentle pressure is applied using your finger. Any longer than that and you risk drying out the edges.

This might be the best chocolate cake I ever made.  Very easy.  I did also try it using a yellow cake mix and vanilla pudding and it was just as good.  Both times I cut the sour cream to half a cup and cut the oil to half a cup and added half a cup of applesauce.  Thanks so much for a great recipe Lisa!

Very good, very rich.  Doesn't need frosting!  Of course, as most All Recipe users, I didn't follow the exact recipe!  I subbed Ricotta cheese (cause we're having a blizzard and I didn't want to go out for sour cream!) for the sour cream.  Chunky applesauce for half the oil.  And used full sized chocolate chips.  Excellent, moist, deep dark chocolate flavor.

This was an absolute hit at my Christmas party. I made a few small changes. I used full size milk chocolate chips and substituted 1/2 cup of apple sauce for a half cup of the oil. Before serving I heated some chocolate icing and poured it over the top. Fantastic recipe. Do not be afraid to try it!

Very rich and very chocolately. I made it for my son's 7th birthday party as he loves chocolate cake.  All the adults loved it, but the kids only took a couple small bites as it was too rich for them.

Beautiful wonderful my favorite cake!  I always buy cake mix with pudding in the mix IN ADDITION to the other pudding.  It makes it extra special moist and I love love love this cake. 
Thank you so much for the recipe.
(I wonder how much of a difference it would make if I used another flavor pudding) - like butterscotch or pistachio?

Very good doctored cake mix. I added regular sized chips and used hot coffee in place of hot water as many suggested. It got lots of compliments. Light and fluffy like a cake mix, but with a richer flavor. I still like scratch cakes better.

My Mom & Dad actually stopped by and tried some of this, and were amazed.  Understanding that my Father has not liked anything made for him since my grandmother passed away 20 years ago.   The leftovers were a huge success @ work the next day as well.

This cake needs to sit for a few hours before eating it!!!!!  When this cake came out of the oven, I was not impressed. Per some of the previous reviewers, I used applesauce and egg beaters and coffee with dark chocolate chips. It had a hard crust around it, and I thought that it had a funny aftertaste.  So we had leftovers, and stuck them in an airtight container. I had a bite a few hours later.  WOW!!!!!! Now this was one amazing cake!!!! All of the flavours had blended, and the crust had turned soft. It was one of the softest, moistest, most delicious cakes I have ever had.   I will make this recipe again. And try slightly different flavours, and make it again. Then again.  WONDERFUL!!!!!! But ONLY if it sits in an airtight container first.

I made this cake for my son's 13th birthday because he specifically requested a chocolate cake with chocolate chips in it. Needless to say, it was a big hit! I prepared it exactly as the recipe is written adding only about 2 tablespoons of cocoa for some extra chocolate umph! Delicious!!!

Made this for my son's 8th birthday and it was a hit! I cut the oil down to 3/4 cup and it was still moist and delicious. After it cooled, I sprinkled with powdered sugar and served with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce. Very easy and love the it's made with inexpensive ingredients.

Added a chocolate glaze and it was amazing!  A keeper for gifts, desserts, or ...  Very easy to make and very moist.  In a bundt pan, it will take 1 hour to cook.

This cake went over quite well at Christmas.  Very moist - next time I will probably cut down on the oil by at least a quarter cup.  I'm still not able to get his to quite taste like the chocolate chip cake my aunt makes, but will keep this recipe.

I made this cake following the recipe to a T-well I can't say to a T because I used a whole bag of milk chocolate chips. And I also made the cake using the suggestion of using only a 1/2 of oil. The cake using 1 cup of oil was more moist then only using 1/2 c of oil. The cake with only a 1/2 c of oil was a little more dense. This is a keeper-following the recipe to a T.

I took the advice of another user and made sugar free and fat free substitutions.  I was going to a party where the majority of attendees are on WW.  It was EXCELLENT!!!!!   Very moist.  Could not tell it was Reduced fat.  Everyone asked for the recipe.  Had to cook longer than the 38 minutes that the other user got though.   More like 50 minutes.

Talk about chocolate!!!   YUM, it was great exactly as written.  When it comes to chocolate cake, who counts the calories????  I made the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe from this site and it was perfect.  The ONLY reason I gave it a 4, is because although I loved it, no one else really raved about it, well, except my teenage grand daughter. Will keep this one in my file to make again

This cake was moist and yummy. The only change I made was to add a glaze that I made out of: 1/4 c melted choco chips, 2 T butter and 2 T corn syrup which made the cake extra delicious. I've also made this cake with yellow cake mix and vanilla pudding mix and even added coffee for the water.  Great recipe. thankyou Lisa

This cake was good but for the price of all the extra ingredients(sour cream, pudding, etc.) it still tastes like a box cake.  Not as much texture or moisture as homemade.  It has that airy taste, not enough chocolate, just tastes boxed.

I'd give 5 more stars if I could. Sinfully moist and so very rich and chocolatey. This is my new favorite way to make chocolate cake! I made this for my chocoholic boyfriend's birthday. Bunt style with a choclate glaze drizzled over it, the hole filled with ripe strawberries and the whole thing lightly dusted with powdered sugar. Perfect. Thanks!!

I'm sure this recipe will be great as is, but I decided to play around a bit! Instead of chocolate pudding, I used the new creamy orange Jello pudding. I also subbed Grand Marnier for 1/2 of the oil! YUM!!! I had about 1 1/2 cups of mini chips, so I just dumped them all in. 50 minutes at between 325 & 350 degrees was perfect. The flour Pam worked great - I let it cool for 15 minutes on a rack & then turned out. Put the cake cover on while cooling- then sprinkled on powdered sugar. (had to wipe out excess moisture from the cake cover) Everyone loved it at the Father's Day get-together!

My husband's grandmother makes this cake and I wanted to have this recipe for my own cookbook.  I used this recipe and it was perfect.  I like yellow cake better than chocolate so I used yellow cake mix with Vanilla pudding mix.  It was so moist and yummy. Thanks for such a great recipe I can pass down to future generations via my cookbook.

I made this today and yes it does taste great but the 1 cup of oil is too much. Just touching the cake leaves your hands greasy. It's so moist that I think it would be fine to cut that in half and it still be a wonderful cake. Will definitely try it again that way.

I used 1/2c oil and 1/2c applesauce and light sour cream but otherwise followed the ingredient list. To bake, I made dozens of mini-cupcakes and 1 dozen regular cupcakes (all with paper liners). They were a huge hit - and made it easier to eat smaller portions.

This is essentially a dump cake.  Throw it together, pour into Bundt pan and bake.  It's surprisingly plain and made better by the addition of rum raisin (or other flavor) ice cream.  My company, kids included, liked it better than I did.

Great cake, very easy to make.   I needed to make 2 cake for a bake sale and this is the recipe I choose.   I know some people don't like the substitutions but I love them.   I used  no sugar added applesauce instead of oil, fat free sour cream instead of regular and it tasted great.   I didn't sub the eggs because I didn't have egg beaters but next time I will.   My 13 year old son made the first batch into chocolate cupcakes and they were great.   No icing needed.    What I like about this recipe is it's not too sweet.  The two cakes came out great.  Will add this to my recipe box and make again.

Very moist - very quick.  While I usually avoid recipes that involve just doctoring up a cake mix this one had a little something more to it.  It evoked more of a home made flavor and I used to to prepare an emergency dessert for a family outing.  It was gobbled up!!  Since I am famous for my scratch desserts no one suspected there was a cake mix involved - it was THAT good!  I will keep it (secretly!) in my recipe box to use again!

Quick and easy! I used a milk chocolate cake mix and a double fudge pudding mix. Cake came out super moist! I also used 1/2 C of oil as others had suggested. This cake recipe is a keeper!

This cake is fabulous!  Following some of the suggestions, I used 1/2 C of oil and I used 1 C strong hot coffee.  Oh, and I lost my head and added a whole bag of chocolate chips.  This recipe is a keeper!

The most wonderful chocolate cake I think I have ever baked.  Everyone who ate this cake, said it was simply perfect.  I served the cake plain with just a sprinkling of powdered sugar ~ I used a Meijer moist select deep chocolate cake mix and did reduce the oil to just 1/2 cup.  I also used full size chocolate chips.  I loved the fudgy taste and the crisp outside but moist inside.  Pretty sure I will make this cake again, although next time I will play around to try and make it a little more healthy!  Even though its good, not sure its worth 447 calories a slice!

The first time I made this cake, my husband and I could not belive how moist and fluffy this cake cake out.  The second time, I made it for a family dinner part.  It was gone down to the last crumb.  Made the recipe as is both times.

Ilove this cake, but I used butter/yellow cake mix with vanilla pudding. I save some chocolate chips to melt and drizzle over the top, then sprinkled with powdered sugar. This recipe is a delicious, moist cake! Used Often.

I made this for a party last night. Used dark chocolate store-brand mix, coffee instead of the water, 1/2 c applesause for 1/2 c oil, and regular-sized chocolate chips. It was a hit! No icing needed; I just dusted it with powdered sugar.

By far and away the easiest cake I've made!  I usually don't change a thing although I've been making this for a couple of years, but I'll try the applesauce substitution, maybe the coffee.  I've made this for 2 of my daughters' birthday parties each year and they like me to dip strawberries in chocolate and arrange them around the cake and also in the middle (they call this the "bundt hole.")  I use a couple of different glazes, regular chocolate and white chocolate.  I live at a high altitude and it's come out perfect every time without any changes to it.  You just can't mess up this recipe!

I have made cakes like this before, so I am familiar with the formula. I agree with naples34102 that a whole cup of vegetable oil was unnecessary. I did use a melted stick of butter and double-brewed coffee in place of the water called for. I didn't have mini-chips, but I did have regular semi-sweet. This cake was not easy to just pour into the bundt pan, I had to scoop it with my spatula and then even/smooth it out. This took darn near an hour and a half to bake, covered a little over halfway through to keep the top and sides from burning. This is a gift for my husband's family-I'm sure they'll love it. NOTE: HUGE HIT. This was so moist and just chocolatey. This is a keeper.

This recipe was a hit with all of my family and friends. My 17 year old son loved it and ask for more which is rare. I followed the recipe to the tee except adding all of the chocolate chips and I baked it in a 9x13 pan.  I sprinkled with powdered sugar and added a dab of cool whip when serving. It was great several people ask me for the recipe.  This is a keeper.

You do not need 1 cup oil, you only need 1/2 cup. I've been making this recipe for several years from a Baker's chocolate recipe book before I saw it on this site and I've always only used 1/2 cup. I have used regular size semisweet chocolate chips  at times, but most of the time have used 1 pkg.(8 1oz. squares) of semisweet baking chocolate chopped. Either way this cake is absolutely wonderful, and does not taste like it started out as a box mix. Everyone that I have ever made this recipe for loves it. You don't need a topping at all, but powdered sugar looks pretty if you dust it on after the cake cools. If you like chocolate, you'll love this cake.

This was a very good choclate bundt cake. I made with regular size chocolate chips because it's what I had on hand. I will make again with the mini chips next time. I also frosted with some buttercream chocolate frosting topped with red sprinkles because I served it at a Christmas party. Several family members have requested I make this cake again. Thank you for the recipe!

Outrageous cake!
I fixed this as a single layer sheet cake for my husband's birthday, topped with cool whip and accompanied by a raspberry reduction sauce.  I used Duncan Heinz Devils Cake mix.  It was so good that my husband is still talking about it weeks later.  We still have some in the fridge and he returns to it raving about how it has kept moist and is the best birthday cake anyone has ever made him in 30 years, "and many people have tried" he says.  Well, I think it's gross to eat any cake after that long so I'll have to be making it again soon!

Thanks Lisa!  I'm not much of a baker and this cake turned out excellent!  I also used the chocolate satin glaze (doubled the recipe) and drizzled over the top.  Many compliments!  I baked it 55 minutes, cooled 20 minutes then added the glaze.

I made this cake with yellow cake mix and vanilla pudding instead, but it has gotten raves from my co-workers! Last night, I could not stay away from the scraps of the cake; I kept eating them because it was so flavorful and moist!

YUM! Made exactly as directed with a devils food cake mix and raspberry/dark chocolate chips in a bundt pan. Took it to a party and it was a HIT - everyone raved over it! I am a dark chocolate lover so the less sweet more rich chocolate flavor was perfect for me. Will probably try using applesauce instead of oil next time. 

I didn't ice it, but I did dust it with powdered sugar right after I got it out of the oven (because I was running late) and the sugar carmelized a bit and made this awesome crunchy coating that contrasted well with the rich, moist cake.

I love this recipe.  I always use Duncan Hines for the box mix, Devil's Food, I think it gives the best flavor.  I usually make cupcakes with this recipe.  The first time I made it was last year and now at every function, I have to bring them.  I frost with a peanut butter frosting, "Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting" found on this site.  They are absolutely wonderful.  The only down side is that sometimes my cupcakes fall.

Very moist cake! Extremely good, especially warm right out of the oven. I sprinkled powdered sugar on top then drizzled hot chocolate syrup over the powdered sugar.

I've had this cake before, and it was SOOOO good.  I tried it tonight, but learned (again) to FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS!  She's not lying when she says 60 minute cooking time...I didn't think it was done and left it in the oven too long.  As a result, it wasn't as gooey/decadent as the first time I had it (still GREAT though!).  Serve it warm with ice cream and fudge sauce and you've got a restraunt dessert!

This is very similar to a recipe found in a book called "the cake mix Doctor" I highly recommend getting the book if you loved this recipe. Basically this cake is just "stupid good" as a friend of mine put it. you can;t beat it. wonderful for many occasions or just beacsue! and dirties only one bowl!!!
One note: make sure th cake mix you use doesn;t already have "pudding in the mix", I also used no fat sour cream because thats what I had in the fridge, and it was still very rich and moist.

Very good way to dress up a box cake!  My kids made it for me for my birthday and it went over very well, even with the men in our family who claim they don't care for chocolate cake.  The one piece left over was even more moist the next day.  We drizzled it with a homemade caramel/brown sugar type frosting which really complemented the cake.  The kids forgot to put in the choc chips which was fine as it was still good.  We used a Pampered Chef bundt pan and it was the perfect size.  Thanks for the recipe Lisa.

THIS CAKE IS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!!!!  I just finished making this about 1 hour ago. I did not have a chocolate cake mix, so I used the dry ingredients from the recipe for Chocolate Cake on the back of the  Hershey's Cocoa box.  The cake was very moist and my family loves it.

Did not taste like the average box cake at all!!  Will definitly make again and again!  Frosted with Hershey's Perfectly chocolate frosting.

Excellent recipe!  I used a total of 1 cup of a mix of sour cream and non-fat yogurt, both fat-free, because it is what I had on hand.  It was still exceedingly moist and really good.  I also added 1/4 c of hersheys cocoa (unsweetened) because I really like a dark chocolate taste, and it was incredibly decadent.

I usually make a really good chocolate cake from scratch, but ever since I've made this, people request it over my own!  I have never received so many compliments on a cake in my life.  I use more chocolate chips in the batter (almost double), and  I frost it with chocolate buttercream frosting.  An intensely wonderful chocolate experience.  The next time I make it, I'm going to try substituting strong coffee for the water.  Mocha lovers, watch out!!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a very good chocolate cake. I used a pudding in the mix cake mix,so I didn't add the instant pudding.  I used 1/2 cup applesauce and only 1/2 cup oil, as well as 3/4 cup regular chocolate chips. YUMMY!

Quick and easy but tasted similar to cake from a mix.  The next day, the added moistness was more noticeable and appreciated.  The mini chips were difficult to detect once baked, so if you like small chunks of chocolate, use regular sized chips.  I frosted with white buttercream and sprinkled mini chips on top (attractive and delicious).

This recipe is wonderful!  It makes a moist and delicious cake and is quick and easy to put together.  I frosted it with Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting, also from this site.  A match made in heaven!  I followed the recipe exactly and found no changes were necessary, even the bake time at 1 hour was spot on for my oven.

This was a great recipe!!! Very moist, delicious and easy as ever! I actually made a chocolate ganache which put it "over-the-top"...pun intended. I plan to make it often.
As good as the chocolate is, I plan to try it with a yellow cake mix, vanilla pudding and milk chocolate chips...should be really good! Thanks, Lisa S.

SIMPLE, QUICK, EASY & TASTY! I gave it 5 stars for the simplicity and easiness to make in addition to the great taste. Definitely use 1/2 cup of strong coffee instead of hot water. I've baked this several times and once I lessened the oil to 2/3c because some reviewers mentioned that it was too much oil. It DEFINITELY tastes better with the full amount. Dont cut corners. If you wanna cut calories, do like i do and cut yourself a couple slices and take the rest to work!

I've made this many, many times... it's delicious every time. It never lasts long! It's delicious plain, but I like to serve it with whipped cream and raspberries. I don't recommend dusting it with powdered sugar, though, because the cake is too moist. It makes it look like it has a damp gray coating.

Soooo good. I made this cake for Easter and the family loved it.  Best chocolate cake ever. I took others advice and used coffee instead of water. The search is over, this is it!  Thanks Lisa.

OMG!!! I just made this cake yesterday, for my Grandson's birthday. I've had this recipe for years. 1 cup of oil is excessive though, I only use 1/2 cup. I use Devil's Food cake mix and replace the chocolate chips with 30 miniature peanut butter cups, cut in quarters, which I fold in after mixing. Bake it in 2 (9" round) layer cake pans, frost with my buttercream recipe (to which I add 1/2 cup of peanut butter) and garnish the top with additional peanut butter cups. YUMMO!!!

I made this for a co-worker's birthday--it was devoured.  I work with a bunch of men, and they all love chocolate.  I cut the oil to 1/2 cup and used regular milk chocolate chips.  Nice, quick recipe that I will use again.  I think I'd like to try the butter cake mix with vanilla pudding as several others have mentioned.  I didn't give 5 stars because only 1/2 c oil is needed and 2-3 eggs is enough. *Update- I tried the butter cake mix and vanilla pudding and didn't like it nearly as much as the chocolate.

This cake was good. Good enough. It came together easily, cooked up fine and with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site made a nice presentation for a friend's birthday. However it wasn't earth shattering. The glaze was the best part. It worked out well but I would not be in a major rush to make it again. Thank you though.

This recipe was delicious.  I didn’t have chocolate pudding, so I used vanilla.  I also used 1/2 cup of applesauce instead of oil.  It was so moist and while it was still warm we dished it out (not frosted) and ate with several scoops of ice cream.  WONDERFUL!

I've made this twice,once for someone's birthday and once for a baby shower, and everyone LOVED it! It was so moist and very chocolaty. Both times I made it in a big sheet pan, and it is a great recipe for decorative cakes because it is so dense and heavy. I used regular chocolate chips the first time and mini ones the second, and I think the regular ones make give it a better texture. This cake is awesome and I will definitely use it again.

This is one of the best tasting chocolate cakes I have ever made..definitely the fastest. I usually don't like the taste of box mixes but with all the additions it you cant tell its a box at all. Next time I will sub the oil for applesauce and light sour cream to make it a little healthier. If you like light moist cakes this is the one for you!

I made this cake for the 3rd or fourth time today and I think I finally got it right!  After viewing other comments here are the changes I made:  Yellow cake mix and vanilla pudding mix, 1/2 cup vegetable oil, 1/2 cup cold coffee instead of the water, and 1/2 cup sour cream.  The cake looked great and tasted even better!  It had just a little bit of a tasty brown crust, and was soooo moist.  The dusting of powdered sugar was just the right touch. Thank you Lisa!!

It was OK, I'm still searching for a more chocolate tasting cake. I subbed apple sauce for the oil.  My family is not going back for seconds, so that tells me they are not impressed either, I am eating it all myself. I probably won't make this one again.

Sweet! Subbed with 1/2 cup veggie oil, 1/2 cup coffee (in place of the hot water), and added 1 tbsp. Mint extract per recipe. I made 75 cupcakes for my daughter's slumber party, and my e-mail's been swamped with requests from parents and teachers ever since! Stay creative, no frosting needed, fork optional!

This was ok, but definitely not the best cake mix "fixing" cake I've made.  I replaced the oil with applesauce, as I didn't realize I was out of vegetable oil until I started to get everything together.  Usually that doesn't make any difference in the outcome, but I wonder if that is why the cake was only so-so.

I made many of the changes that are suggested to lighten the calorie and fat load, because over 500 calories per slice is insane!  I used light sour cream, used 1/4 cup of oil and 1/4 cup applesauce and a fat free sugar free pudding.  These changes make the cake slightly more dry, but if you bake it a day ahead and keep it covered it will be just as moist and delicious as the original recipe!

Excellent!  A great recipe you can count on turning out right--looks great and tastes terrific!  Rich enough to serve without any frosting, but powdered sugar or a tiny bit of glaze are nice too.  Thanks for sharing!

This cake was good but nothing real extraordinary.  I felt it could've used 2 cups of chocolate chips instead of one.  I cut back on the oil by 1/4 C, even the box says to add 1/2 C and I didn't think the few extra ingredients would warrant adding a whole nother (is that a word?) 1/2 C. of oil.

I made this for a neighborhood picnic - I used the full version - I don't believe in cutting calories on my chocolate desserts!!!  I put the Satiny Chocolate Glaze (from this site) on top.  It not only smelled amazing - it was gone before I could get a slice.

This is probably the easiest dessert I have made in a long time and it got rave reviews!!!

Divine.  Only had regular chocolate chips but they worked just fine.  Topped with a simple butter & powdered sugar glaze.  Reminds me of the crockpot triple chocolate mess.

This is perfect when you're in the mood for chocolate cake. And, super easy to make. I baked this just as written and found it to be easy and yummy. I used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recommended by other reviewers. Perfect. I made this for my husband's birthday cake. He was pleased. I think you will be too.

This was the first recipe I've ever done from this website. I couldn't believe how easy & cheap it was to make. The only changes I made was 1/4cp Kahlua and 1/4cp Coffee to replace the 1/2 cp hot water. And I added 2 tsps Cinnamon. Pam baking spray with Flour coated the bundt pan nicely. It came out in one beautiful piece. We couldn't wait for it to cool, so we served it warm with cool whip on top.  My son and I looooooved it! I definitely enjoyed the coffee/kahlua hints with the chocolate. YUMMY :)

Very good.  I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet.  I also drizzled a chocolate sauce over it.  Delicious.  Very rich.  Yum

Read several of the reviews and didn't see any problems that I had.  I used a devil's food cake and didn't have semi-sweet chips.  Ask hubby if he wanted bittersweet chocolate chips or white chocolate chips.  He chose the latter.  My batter seem to get very thick while mixing (almost like the pudding was setting up in the bowl)!

THIS CAKE IS WONDERFUL! I AM AN NOT EVEN A CHOCOLATE LOVER AND I LOVE THIS CAKE! WITH THE ADDED CHOCOLATE CHIPS YOU WOULD THINK THIS CAKE WOULD BE TOO SWEET (IT IS NOT AT ALL) I GUESS THE SOUR CREAM HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT. ITS ALSO THE MOST MOIST CAKE IVE EVER HAD AS WELL.

I made this for my dad's birthday and since he hates chocolate I took this recipe and made it using lemon in place of the chocolate and it was pretty good.  I used FF sour cream and not as much oil as it called for. This was also last minute and if I had my way I would have made him something from scratch... I like to stay away from boxed foods as much as possible. This does make a moist, supre easy, and good dessert. Thanks for the recipe contribution this just won't be making into my rotation.

This cake was very good. I added pecans and instead of semi-sweet chocolate morsels, I use the caramel and milk chocolate morsels. Also, I bake for 50 minutes instead of 60 minutes, I didn't want it to dry out.

This was fantastic, rich and moist with great flavour.  I made it twice in one week for two different family birthdays and it got rave reviews. Will definitely make again and again.  I drizzled it with a chocolate glaze and served it with a raspberry sauce the first time, but not necessary.  Great on its own!

Delicious cake!! I used applesauce instead of oil- still super moist, fudgey chocolate flavor....even without frosting it's a huge hit. Still moist and delicious even 2 or 3 days later. LOVE.

I am never making any other kind of chocolate cake again. This is the recipe to last in my cookbook. I lightened it up a bit by using ff sour cream, applesauce in place of the oil, and eggbeaters for the eggs. I also used dark chocolate chunks chopped small and only used 1/2 cup. I also used sugar free chocolate pudding mix. You would never know this wasn't a full fat guilty cake. It's rich, spongy and moist. Doesn't need any topping at all, except maybe a scoop of ice cream. Hey, the cake's low fat, go for it! GREAT recipe!

Made the health-conscious version and it was excellent!  Instead of icing or glaze, I made quick chocolate mousse (whipping cream plus Hershey's syrup, whip in blender) and served a spoonful with each piece of cake.  The texture contrasts and tastes complemented each other well.  We will serve this often!

I made this cake both as a traditional 2 layer cake (adjust cooking time accordingly) frosted with Rick's Buttercream Frosting (for birthdays), and I also have made it as a bundt cake, with confectioner's sugar spinkled on the top with bright red strawberries in the center.  Every time I make it, it's a hit!  It's my favorite cake for pretty much any occasion.

Excellent!! I made this for myself for my birthday, so I made it exactly has written. When cooled my son poured some melted frosting over the top and then I dusted with powdered sugar.  Very very good.  My husband said that it is the best chocolate cake he ever had.  This probably will be a birthday staple from now on.  The one thing I will do differently next time is put some more mini chocolate chips on the frosting before it cools.  Very very good cake.  Thanks for the reciep.

This was probably the best chocolate cake I ever made.  Made it for my in-laws and everyone ate seconds!  Made it a day ahead and it was still super moist.  I was curious how it would be without frosting, but it doesn't need it at all.  Served it with some ice cream.  YUM YUM!  This will be a favorite.

Reduce the oven to 325.  I made muffins - they taste like Otis Rudenmeyer(sp)like the other said.  I reduced 1/2 oil for milk like the other person suggested. I used melted Betty Croker fudge icing as suggested.   Next time I'll try substituting the carbonated beverage and reduce fat even further like other suggested. Used mini chips.  Made thin two layer cake with remaining batter. Icing is must for cake - not so with muffins.  Muffins went really fast - cake not so - I ended up eating most of it (bummer) and threw away the remaining.  

I agree - this is good and I'll make the muffins again - i guess expectations were too high based on reviews - guess it depends on what you are used to....

Just had to say that this recipe makes the best cupcakes we have ever had.  No need for frosting even, just dust with some powdered sugar.  However, some chocolate frosting does put it over the top for those special days!

Everyone I've made this cake for has absolutely loved it!  It's really delicious and moist!  I just want to add that if you don't have mini chocolate chips (as I do not, here in Eastern Europe) you may use regular size chocolate chips.  I also cook it about 10 minutes longer than an hour (that might just be my oven here however!)

I do not eat carbs but I made this for my brother-in-law and it was a hit! All the kids went back for seconds!  I did change the recipe though - I used white cake mix and vanilla pudding and then used white icing.  Would make again for sure!

I have a really similar recipe that uses only a 1/2 cup of oil and no sour cream and it so much better than this. This is pretty heavy.

Excellent recipe!  I've made it three times now and it's been a hit everytime!  I pour milk chocolate frosting (from a can and heated up) over it when it's flipped onto the platter.  It makes it that much chocolatey and gives it a glossy and smooth surface that is beautiful!  I also only cook it 50 minutes, but my oven runs a little hot.

This is sooooo good!  I didn't have sour cream, so I used 1 cup heavy whipping cream and 1 tablespoon vinegar, and it turned out great!  I actually hate chocolate cake but this was wonderful.  it left streaks on my plate because it was so moist.  The cooking time listed is the perfect amount of time to get the cake done.  5 stars!

Absolutely Delicious!  Made for my husband's birthday and he loved it. I heavily drizzled it with Chocolate Frosting I by Trianne.  Will make this cake often and pass it along to family members.  Thank you.

I made this cake for a large group of people, doubling the recipe and using an 11X15 pan. Everyone loved the moistness of the cake and that the cake itself was not overwhelming sweet. I left out the chocolate chips afraid of the texture being odd. I used sour cream chocolate icing and got a lot of complimnets.

People were telling me they've never had such a rich/chocolatey cake before! It turned out very good! I covered it with chocolate frosting then crushed oreos and sprinkled them all around too... it was moist cake with crunchy cookies! Goes fantastic with a scoop of vanilla ice cream too!

We made this cake for my husband’s birthday and send it with to work. He told me that everyone raved about it and I was very pleased. But a month later when I attended a business function (not thinking that anyone would remember a cake), everyone came to me and thanked me for the most wonderful cake they ever had! They ranted and raved about it for ages! We’ll definitely recommend this cake… it is moist and stunningly delicious!

I made this last night for a co-worker's birthday.  WOW! This cake was sooooo good.  I used the triple chocolate fudgey cake mix with the chocolate chips in it like a previous poster used and put in the cup of chocolate chips.  Talk about chocoholic heaven!  My only dissapointment was the chocolate glaze I used.  Ended up being more like frosting then glaze, I may add a little milk next time to make it thinner.  It was yummy nonetheless and all my co-workers loved it.  My supervisor said its the best  cake she has ever had.

Wow!! I loved this recipe! I made a few little changes just 'cuz I could :) I used jumbo eggs and one had 2 yolks (was already in the bowl) I made cupcakes and checked them after 16 min to be sure they didn't dry out. I also added milk chocolate chips mmmmm!  If that's not rich enough for you I added store bought coconut pecan frosting!  So good, thank you for the easy recipe it was fun and deliscious.

I love this cake.  I have made it a few times, including as cupcakes!  Yummy!  I used some hot strong coffee instead of the plain water, and topped the cupcakes with the Special Buttercream Frosting from Allrecipes.  I am still on a hunt for 'the' perfect chocolate cake, and this brought me a little bit closer!

this cake is fantastic. yes, it's moist - it has a cup of oil! I used regular sized chips and it was fine. I will make this again and again. does not need frosting, just a dusting of powdered sugar.

This was the most rich, moist, cake I have ever made! I can't believe how easy it was to put together!  I couldn't let anyone at work know how simple (cake mix, pudding mix, etc.) or my reputation would have been in jeopardy.  I have always baked everything from scratch, what I relief I have something easy to fall back on every once in a while! UPDATE: I make this cake at least once a month for potlucks and have found that it is even richer and more delicious if you substitute coffee for the water or even (gasp) liquor, I used creme de cocoa chocolate liquor.  It works with Vanilla pudding if that is all you have on hand (leave our vanilla extract in this case) and I get the best reviews when I top with Satiny Chocolate Glaze also from this site.

I made this cake for a party at work and it was gone in about five minutes.  Everyone raved about how moist and delicious it was.  I used a dark chocolate cake mix with pudding already in it, plus added the extra pudding.  The satiny chocolate glaze recipe is the perfect topping.  This is a "keeper!"

Excellent! I omitted the chocolate chips since the textrue wasn't right with a similar chocolate cake I previously tried. I dusted it with powdered sugar, but a few of the ultra chocolate lovers in the family would love to have chocolate frosting on top.

An absolute favorite in my house commonly known as "Troy Cake". I've made this a number of ways - yellow cake mix, white chocolate pudding, mint chocolate chips, etc. etc. All are yummy! The two changes that I routinely make though are to only use 1/2 cup oil, and no hot water. Still works and is still moist!

I made this cake for my son's birthday.  It was the best choc cake I have ever made.  I added Mrs. Richarsons hot fudge topping for the frosting.  It reminded me of a cake from a bed and breakfast we stayed at. absolutely the best.

The recipe calls for 18.25oz cake mix.  All the major brands I checked were 15.25oz.  I guess they are making them smaller these days.

My family loves this recipe. I omit the oil and add a cup of apple sauce instead. I also sugar the pan with powdered sugar instead of flouring it.   So yummy!

I take it to parties and it's always a hit.  Sometimes I put peanut butter chips in instead of chocolate and I put a simple peanut butter drizzle glaze on it.

Yummy!  I substituted with some things with what I had on hand:  choco fudge cake mix, sugar free pudding mix, 1/2 c. oil and 1/2 c. applesauce, 1/2 c. coffee instead of water, used 1 c. vanilla fat free greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and choco chunks instead of chips.   Used the satiny choco glaze that is on this site.  Served it somewhat warm still with whip cream and cinnamon sprinkled on top. It was fabulous!  Thank you Lisa!

Sorry - I don't get all the fabulous reviews for this cake - I made as written (except to use coffee instead of water), used good chocolate (Ghiradelli), and it was still just "meh" - thank goodness I used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze and Toasted Pecans on Top, or I would really have been embarassed to serve this cake.

This cake was very moist.  The chocolate chips in it are nice and melty.  They pretty much make the cake!  I can't help but saw M M M  while  eating this.  It's perfect just the way it is Except!  I substituted the water for brewed coffee.  DELICIOUS!  I will definitely make this again.

This worked out well but be aware the food industry has reduced the size of their cake mixes to 15.25oz. After advice from the Buzz, I added 1/3 cup flour plus 1 tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and topped with Satiny Chocolate Glaze. I took it to a celebration, by the time I was free to have a piece, it was gone. While I didn't get to try it, I would say that was a good testament to how good it was and will make it again for another occasion. Thanks you!!

OMG, this is a simple yet fantastic and decadent recipe!  Followed the recipe exactly as written and wow, so delicious, chocolatey-rich, moist.  I'm now using this as my Christmas dessert recipe, and for a chocolate lover and Christmas fiend, that's saying something!    Can sub mini chocolate chips for regular chocolate chips, does just fine.

I couldn't justify the calorie count, so made some adaptations based on other's comments. The experiment turned out well.  I used a small (2.1 oz.) pkg. of sugar/fat free chocolate pudding mix, 1/2 cup of oil, 1 cup light sour cream, 1/2 tsp. instant coffee and 1 cup bittersweet chocolate chips. The result was not quite as moist as the one pictured, but had dense, deep chocolate flavor. A little drizzle of thin vanilla frosting made it great!

LOVE this cake, everyone does, they say how moist it is. I do add 1 cup more choc chips and make sure you do the hot water it does make a difference. And very easy and quick to make.

Really good cake.  We did as suggested and used applesauce instead of oil, low fat sour cream and sugar free pudding and it still was wonderful.  There were no left overs.

Man I hate to bash a recipe, but 1 cup of oil and 4 eggs is just way too much for this.  After mixing all the ingredients you could see how visibly slick and oily it was.  Like others said, cut to 1/2 cup oil and I even think you can get away with 3 eggs since youre adding a 1 cup of sour cream.  I honestly dont even want to eat it.

I make this for the Superbowl every year and serve it warm with vanilla ice cream. I add the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe on top, and I also underbake it a little bit so it's gooey!

This is an awesome, easy chocolate cake recipe!  I used a Devil's food cake mix (personal preference) and hot coffe instead of water for an extra rich chocolate flavor.  I would not change up this recipe making it "less fattening"--it's a Chocolate cake for goodness sake--"Live, Love, Eat!!" (as Wolfgang Puck says)

I fed this to my family (who are not cake eaters) and it was nearly gone. I followed the recipe exactly except for using light sour cream. It can be considered "Death by Chocolate" so if you don't like it rich, this may not be for you. I made a chocolate glaze that I dribbled on the top (1 c. chocolate chips, 4 Tbsp butter-flav shortening, 1 Tbsp light corn syrup mixed together over dbl boiler) - it was very yummy. Added strawberries to the middle of the bunt cake and it looked as good as it tasted. Thanks!

I've had this cake in my recipe box for a looooong time and it's really good and easy.  But you want to cut the oil down to 1/2 cup, replace the water with brewed coffee or even dark rum, and use chocolate chunks, or at least standard-size chocolate chips. After that it's a chocolate lover's heaven on earth.  Tastes GREAT with Breyer's mint chip ice cream!!!

This is the same as the Cake Doctor recipe except double the oil! It really doesn't need that much oil. Try it you'll see. Next time I think I will try it with peanut butter chips.

this has always been my savior dessert when last minute visitors come over. I did it with the regular cake mix (not chocolate) and it was good too. I loved this one too,but its good to change it up once and a while.

Although this had good flavor, I just couldn't get past the weird eggy texture.  It could be related to all the lower fat adjustments (Reduced sugar Devil's Food mix, SF Pudding, Applesauce instead of oil, Light Sour Cream, etc).  After three days, there was still a huge chunk of the cake left.

Everyone that eats this recipe just loves it. It is moist and delicious. I use a full bag of chocolate chips and use applesauce in place of the oil if I have it on hand plus I use fat free sour cream. I also see no need for heating the water, I just use tap water. If company is coming I dust the top with confectionary sugar for eye appeal. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

Very easy yummy cake! I made it for my husbands work BBQ and it scored big points with his boss! I added a vanilla glaze (found on allrecipes.com) on top and then sprinkled powdered sugar on top. I also added milk and white chocolate covered strawberries in the middle of the hole of the cake for decoration. Very yummy and beautiful! Happy baking!

This was an excellent cake! It was very moist and dense. I used a dark chocolate cake mix and semi-sweet chocolate chips, so it had a nice dark chocolate flavor. I just dusted it with powdered sugar, and it looked very pretty. I took this to work and got rave reviews.

This is the cake that my son requests every year for his birthday.  Delicious!  He is a huge peanut butter fan, so now we substitute peanut butter chips for the chocolate chips.  It is perfect as is though.  Yummy!

Amazingly rich and chocolately. But way too much calories. :( Tasted light and rich at the same time. Somewhat like a good brownie but not. :) I make it in 2 9X9 pans. I'll try the lighter version as per other reviewers next.

I made this cake with the suggestions of other reviewers to reduce the calories and fat.  But then we added back in all the calories in fat but adding ice cream.  I'm not sure I like the "lightened" cake alone, without ice cream.  I think Lisa's original recipe was great as is and doesn't even need ice cream.

Although very easy to make, wasn't that impressed. I thought it needed a frosting of some sort. I am interested in making it the "lower calorie" version a few have posted.

I made this cake for a Women's Luncheon.  I didn't use a Bundt pan instead I use a 9x13 pan and baked for about 40 min.  It came out delicious. All I had to do was sprinkle powdered sugar on it.  It was a hit at the luncheon.

This cake is absolutely delicious.  I make it as a two layer cake and use chocolate icing.  It is one of my favorite chocolate cakes so far and it is often requested by family and friends.

This is the one of the only cakes I now make. I've made it several times and it is delicious! I never have used a full cup of oil though because it isn't really necessary. I've used anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 cup and its always just fine with less. I've even made this differently by using yellow cake mix and making a white chocolate icing and its just as great!

I have made this cake 5 times and passed the recipe out to 10 people! 
I drizzle the cake with chocolate and white chocolate glaze, garnish with maraschino cherries. *I am currently printing 8 more copies of this recipe to pass out at school! YUM!

WONDERFUL!!  ive made this recipe over and over and over again. for awhile i followed it to a T, but then decided to opt for the healthier route to cut down its calories. and honest to goodness the flavor never lacked a thing! and no one ever tells. 

i will say that sometimes i do add 1/3 stick butter to the batter, as i LOVE more moistness. and it always turns out DELICIOUS.

ive brought this to work parties, and family functions and people months later still rave about them. most often asking for the recipe! :)

This cake is AWESOME!!!!!  I added fresh strawberries (sliced)around the outside edge of the platter and filled the center hole of the bunt cake (after it was baked) with the strawberries.  It came out very pretty.  EVERYONE has loved this cake.  It's fun to use those new silicone cake pans because you can find neat shapes to bake your cake. Thank you for the great recipe!

I loved this and always make it for birthdays. For a healthier version I substitute applesace for the oil and low fat vanilla yougurt for the sour cream and don't add the vanilla extract. Today is my son's 10th birthday and I added chocolate mint chips

This was an easy recipe and sold quickly at a bake sale.  It looked so good that my kids wanted me to buy it back for them!  Luckily, the buyer (a friend) shared a slice with us.  Delicious!  It was chocolatey, moist, and dense without being heavy.  A definite hit!

I made this cake for a family gathering (along with a strawberry cake from this website).  Although I made a few changes to lighten up the recipe (replacing the oil with sugar free applesauce and using fat-free sour cream), the taste and texture of the final product were outstanding.  All the chocolate lovers raved (and had no clue that I had made the substitutions!)  I'll definitely be making this cake again and again.

I made this for a church potluck.  It one for best dessert.  I made it just as the directions said.  However, I did add a chocolate glaze on top to make it even more rich.  I would definantly make this again.

When I make chocolate cake I want an intense, rich chocolate flavor.  You really don't get much of that yummy rich chocolate flavor from this cake.  However, easy to make and have a great presentation value.

Very rich and yummy!  I like my chocolate a little sweeter.  I may try milk chocolate chips next time.  But moist and dense, just as I expected it to be!  Thanks!

I made this cake with a yellow cake mix and french vanilla pudding and then made cupcakes out of the batter.  It was such a hit I had to ban my 6-year-old from the kitchen because all of my cupcakes kept disappearing!  Fabulous recipe!

Box cake that is outstanding--who knew? We are true chocolate fiends so I add chocolate glaze as well.  What I really like is to make a glaze with those chocolate/caramel chips; adds a nice caramel (duh) flavor to further accent the chocolate.  :)

I've been looking for this recipe, saw it years ago in a newspaper column as "Better than Sex Chocolate Cake".  This is the same as far as I can remember. It's a great, moist cake that needs no frosting, so I love to take it to dinners or to work (no potential mess).

I made this cake for my son's birthday and it was the moistest cake that I have ever had. I followed the recipe to the letter and it was enjoyed by all.  Thanks for the recipe Lisa! Also thank you, Dena, for the suggestion of filling the hole in the bundt cake...I filled it with chocolate dipped strawberries.  Yum!

Easy and moist. I got this recipe ages ago from an adopted "grandma". Personally I find the chocolate chips not all that pleasing in the texture of the cake, but without them it seems a little gummy.

Yummy!  I used Kahlua instead of vanilla, and low fat sour cream and pudding, and it was still great. Just like the other folks said, it was even better after a few days.

Yummy!  I made a train birthday cake out of this and WOW!  The kids haven't eaten this yet, but I know they will definitely LOVE it!  It's very moist and chocolaty, and when I put chocolate frosting on a piece of it warm, it was to die for!

I can't thank you enough, Lisa!  My husband ate almost the entire cake in one weekend!  And, I used applesauce instead of oil and egg beaters for the eggs.  He couldn't believe it was lower fat.  This is now one of our favorites.  Thanks again!

Great cake. I made this for my son's bday party. Nobody could believe I made this myself. It was wonderful. I would definately make this again. I did reduce the oil to 2/3 cups, and I used the cool whipped frosting from this website which was excellent on this cake.

I make this cake at least 3-6 times a year and everyone loves it. I melt chocolate icing and drizzle it over the top to give it a fancier look and also bake it in a non traditional bunt pan. 
I promise you this is the easiest recipe and everyone will think you are the best baker ever!

Lisa, this is an outstanding recipe! I served this last night to company and they went crazy.  So moist and full of chocolate flavor.  No trace of a "box cake mix" flavor.  I noticed that the top was starting to brown too fast so I did tent it with foil.  I needed to cook it for 65 minutes.  Perhaps my pan is too small for this wondeful, big cake.  I'll buy a new, bigger Bundt pan.  This recipe deserves it's own pan!  Thank you for sharing this Lisa.  It's a  keeper!

I made this yesterday but wanted to wait to see how it tasted a day later before posting. This was super easy and tastes delicious. It is good without frosting but adding your own frosting or confectioners sugar puts it over the top! By the way, I used regular sized chips and sugar free instant pudding and it was great!

This cake was very moist and heavy. I cut down the water to 1/4 cup and added 1/2 cup of bourbon to the batter to give it a kick (and add a slightly more complex flavor). I also threw in 1/2 cup chopped walnuts to the bottom of the pan before adding the batter. man oh man was this a good cake!

I made this as a Birthday Cake for a good friend of mine that is a huge "chocolate lover"!  I received numerous compliments on it from everyone that had a piece and the birthday girl herself was in shock that I made it myself....she loved it and had a huge piece!  I followed the recipe......but I added a chocolate icing to the top of the cake (I bought one of those that you can microwave and pour on top of the cake) and then sprinkled the left over chocolate chips all over the icing!  It looked, smelled and tasted great!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  =)

This was really good. I used melted semi sweet chocolate chips as  a glaze. It was a major hit.

This cake recipe tastes great.  One thing, I used a 10 inch bundt pan and it overflowed in the oven.  I didn't even use all of the batter.  Make sure to use a deeper cake pan or just don't fill it as high as I did.

I tried this cake because it had so many 5 star ratings.  I was so disappointed.  Even my mother-in-law, who loves chocolate cake almost as much as her only son, didn't like this.  It WAS moist and light, but the flavor was lacking something.  I'm not sure what.

Very easy - a moist chocolate cake.  I used cocoa instead of flour to prepare the pan and put nuts on the bottom for presentation. Not five stars, but an excellent cake.

Very good chocolate cake, I used two cups of mini chocolate chips instead of one cup and also topped it off with the "satiny chocolate glaze" (found on this website) and a few chopped pecans for a nice presentation. Awesome !!

I made this cake for a brunch party a month ago. I served the cake on the table, went to grab a serving utensil and I kid you not, half the cake was gone.  About 5 minutes later, the whole thing was gone. I didn't get to try the cake, but everyone was raving about how good it was.  So, I had to make another, and another, and another... I have since memorized the recipe- spruced it up using vanilla butter cake mix and lemon pudding instead... minus the choc. chips... but seriously Lisa, thank you! This was absolutely the best recipe I've ever made... I mean it! Oh- and one little hint... you can use cocoa to dust the bundt pan instead of flour- works amazingly well!!!! THANK YOU!

This cake was easy to make and tasted like an extra-special dessert.  It's very chocolaty and my whole family really liked it.  I dusted it with powdered sugar but icing would be good too.

Nice and simple cake.  I used coffee instead of water and had to use the regular chocolate chips since that's all I had.  Turned out beautifully.  Thanks Lisa.

My mother makes this cake for all of our birthdays. It's tradition to have mom's 'Chocolate Lover's Chocolate Cake'! And of course it would not be the same without chocolate frosting too.  If you LOVE chocolate, you will LOVE this cake! YUM YUM!!

Normally I bake from scratch, but I needed a dessert in a hurry on a frantic day, so I gave this a go. Following the suggestions of other reviewers, I subbed unsweetened applesauce for the oil & added only half a cup, and cut calories with sugar-free pudding mix and Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream. Baked in two loaf pans at 350 for between 40-45 minutes. (One Pan was fuller than the other and needed longer.) The results were fantastic! This was a big hit both at my neighbor’s potluck and at the office the next day. Interestingly, the cake was even more moist on day 2! Will keep this recipe around for when I need chocolate deliciousness on short notice.

This is an excellent recipe!!!  I am an advanced cook, and I must've made this recipe over 100+ times, in every flavored version that I could think of!  Sub flavored puddings for different flavored cakes--for example Lemon Cake Mix w/ Lemon Pudding w/Zest and microwaved Lemon Juice for Lemon Cake.  My favorite pudding to use in terms of flavor and texture is Jello Cream Cheese Pudding, or French Vanilla Pudding.  Sub fruit juices microwaved for the water; my favorite sub is Pina Colada Mixer.  Sub flavored yogurts for the Sour Cream.  Finally, sub flavorings to match your chosen fruit/other flavorings--Orange, Butter Rum, Cherry, Lemon, Banana, Rum, Orange etc. as desired.  I  like to sub 1/2 cup of creamed butter in place of the 1 cup of oil; adds flavor. Also can add small bits of fruit up to 1/2 cup.  I live at 500 feet+ in elevation, and I add 1/8 cup of AP Flour for better texture.  I have used this over and over again to make Cakes for Wedding Refreshments in different-shaped Bundt Cake Pans, layer cakes, etc.  Look up "simple syrup" flavors to create a soaked cake, like Orange Soaked Cake w/Orange Simple Syrup (w/grated rind) and an orange glaze or chocolate glaze.  Freeze and hold beautifully if wrapped very well for at least one week.

We love this cake and I have made it many times. I like to "flour" the cake pan with unsweetened coca powder to make it prettier, and richer. No need to dust with powdered sugar to cover the floured pan. Also I like to use coffee in place of water, but it is good either way.

I serve it with whipped cream and fresh raspberries, to cut/complement the richness...a wonderful cake....addictive! Travels and freezes well too. I am going to try in my mini bundt pan next time.

I always like to make a recipe according the directions without making changes to rate it! I did have to substitute regular semi-chocolate chips instead of mini because I didn't have any. But this cake is fabulous and I used a chocolate glaze on it. I'll post the link below for the glaze.

I made it and I love it.  I cannot count how many times I've made this.  I make sure to boil the 1/2 cup of water in the tea kettle. 

I also switch out the cake mix and pudding mixes.  Today, I swapped out the chocolate cake mix for a white cake mix and the chocolate pudding for white chocolate pudding. 

I mix in the chips with the dry ingredients before I add the wet ingredients.  Also, make sure to not over-mix the batter!!!  :D

I made this recipe last night for a co-workers birthday and everyone loved it. The only things i did different was that I used a devils food cake mix and instead of using only 1 cup of chocolate chips I used the whole bag so that was about 2 cups of chocolate chips instead of just 1 cup. It was great. Very good Chocolate flavor and very moist!

Made this a few times now and it's so easy, fudgy and delicious. I took the advice to use coffee instead of hot water and it really adds a dimension of flavor to the cake.

"This is the best cake you ever made me for my birthday!"  Since it was the 29th birthday cake I've made for him so far, I took this as a fantastic compliment!  I used 1/2 the oil, as suggested by other reviewers and added extra mini chocolate chips.  This cake was moist and chocolaty, and perfect as a layer cake.  I frosted it with homemade decorator icing.  I will make this again.

Excellent!  I only used 1/2 oil and instead of the water, used hot, brewed coffee.  My cake was done in 45 minutes, so start checking it before it's been in the oven one hour! It's easy, moist and delicious.

I have made this cake many times now and still get requests for this cake for parties. I follow recipe generally as directed, however, I use the Butter Fudge recipe cake mix instead of regular chocolate cake mix. I also use milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet. I'm not sure if this makes much of a difference, but it comes out sooooo moist, that I'm afraid to use regular cake mix.

This cake was delicious!  I brought it to a small gathering at my in-laws' house and everyone loved it!  One girl even asked for a second piece and my husband has requested it for his birthday cake!  I topped it with "Satiny Chocolate Glaze."  I used just straight up "Chocolate" cake mix, but next time I might use a Devil's Food or Dark Chocolate cake mix.  Not that it needed any improvement!

This cake is soooo yummy!  The pudding and sour cream make it super moist.  It is excellent with a little bit of rocky road or vanilla ice cream.  My husband and I can't get enough of it!

The cake is fantastic and so easy.  Everybody loves it.  The last time I made it I substituted light sour cream and it was just as good -- maybe better, not as heavy.  I use the Satiny Chocolate Glaze on it.  Yum.....

This recipe is amazing!!!  It is the only cake recipe I use anymore, I have found that I can switch out the cake mix and pudding mix and chocolate chips and make any kind of cake that I want and it always turns out great.  I even made a red velvet cake taste good, and I hate red velvet cake!!!

Every single time I make this people tell me it's the best cake they're ever had.  I bake it in 2 9" pans for about 45 minutes and frost with homemade chocolate frosting.  Very rich.

I used half applesauce/half oil instead of a full cup of oil. It didn't affect taste or make any difference, but sure saved a lot of calories & fat grams. I also used mini chocolate chips in this recipe. Delicious when drizzled with a chocolate glaze!!

I have made this cake twice already and both times it has gotten rave reviews! I made the cake exactly as the instructions state and it came out perfect! I was inspired by other reviewers and topped it with chocolate covered strawberries and a little bit of powdered sugar. It looked so good that everyone thought this was a store bought cake. Thanks for the great recipe :-)

I really don't like to use baking mixes, but this is one huge exception.  I LOVE this cake - so moist and chocolatey, and you really can't tell that it's from a mix.  I've taken it to work several times and it's always gone in record time.

This cake is fantastic! I don't really care for chocolate cake, (even though I love chocolate), but this cake is amazing! Even my husband loved it-and he is not a dessert person! I made two cakes from this batter and added a layer of creamy chocolate ganache in between along with chocolate ganache poured over top! Soooooo good! Thank you so much for this fabulous recipe! I have made it three times now and gotten rave reviews each time!

This cake was great. I made it as a birthday cake and did it as a layer cake with cherries in the middle. Just perfect. However considering how sweet the cake is on its own, be careful not to choose a very sweet frosting like I did. Put it just a little to much on the sweet side. Otherwise Great!

Excellent cake. I tried without any frosting (just served with ice cream)and it was pretty good but my husband and I agreed it would be better with a sweet frosting.

I didn't really like this recipe...the texture was somewhat spongey and too dense. I followed the recipe exactly, so I'm not sure what went wrong there.

I can't say enough for this recipe. I followed the directions to the "t" and everyone I have made it for has  raved about it!!! Word has gotten out and I am getting requests for it. I used the Creamy Chocolate Frosting (another keeper) with this.

This cake was very moist and delicious. I just about choked on it though when I read how many calories and fat was in it. If I make this again I will definitely lighten it up like the other reviewer suggested.

Very Very good, my family loved this. I made it for Christmas. I used a devils food cake mix, I use real milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet chips in the cake batter. I also used a chocolate glaze, a mixture of cream,semi sweet chips and butter. Then as if that was not enough chocolate I top with more real milk chocolate chips. This was chocolate heaven. When I got home from my moms house I popped a piece in the mirco for 20 (seconds). That was an end to a very good Christmas, and a very good B-day for Jesus.

I love this recipe!  It's so easy and, with a devil's food cake mix, just perfect.  I use any flavored chips I have on hand: chocolate, peanut butter, butterscotch.  Our household is united against frosting, so we love it as is with a cup of milk on the side.  Thanks!

The cake is supermoist and easy to make. It had a bit of an artifical chocolate taste the first day but was alot better the 2nd day. I don't think I will make it again, it just didn't wow me. If I try it again, I will use a devil's food cake mix, hopefully it will have more of the chocolate flavor I was looking for. I used Betty Crocker Chocolate cake mix, not my favorite but thats all I could find.

Terrific! Incredibly moist and very chocolatey.  Yet, it is still fluffy. Amazing.

Absolutely wonderful, perfect first time around.  Between my husband and three small sons, did not even need to keep in a cake-saver, gone before I knew it.  This is a keeper of a recipe!

I'm not a chocolate lover, but made this for one.  We both thought it was wonderful and very rich.  However I was looking for a little more rise and 'fluff' if you know what I mean, this was more dense.  I didn't use the full amount of chocolate chips.  Overall, great rich cake for chocolate lovers!

Yummy cake Lisa! I only used one third cup oil and upped the sour cream. Melted canned frosting in the microwave and drizzled over the top and sides. Very moist and delicious. Thanks!

I made this for my friend's birthday party.  I made my own peanut butter frosting and it tasted like a Reese's.  It was very rich, but some how everyone managed to finish their generous portions.  And even my baking friends could not tell it was from a box mix!

Easy, but not spectacular.  The better the box cake mix, the better the resulting cake.  I added another 1/2 cup of sour cream to make it more moist.  Glazing it with a chocolate glaze made it more decadant and little more special.  You really can't beat how easy it is.

WOW!  I made this last night for a friend's birthday and everyone loved it. They couldn't stop raving about it. I followed the directions exactly and dusted it with icing sugar and it looked very attractive.
My friends were so impressed and thought it took alot of work but in fact was very quick and simple. Thank you Lisa.  This will be made many times in the future. Absolutely delicious and soooooooo moist.

I love chocolate! I have always preferred cake to have icing.  However, this recipe has changed my mind.  This cake is moist, velvety, and o'so full of chocolate.  Easy to make, no need to change a thing. Thanks for the great recipe.

This cake is so delicious and so easy.  The only change I made to the recipe is that I baked it for only 50 minutes, not one hour.  It is so moist and chocolatey that it doesn't need any frosting.

YUM!!! I used this recipe to make delicious double chocolate muffins and I couldn't have picked a better recipe! They were moist, dense, and super chocolately (just like I wanted them). I doubled the recipe (it made about 100 muffins) and baked them in regular size muffin cups with liners for 15-20 minutes and I filled the cups almost completely full. My 2 yr old son loves them and my husband is taking the rest to his team at work! Thanks for sharing your great recipe Lisa!! We will definatly use it again and again.

Definately can add 2 cups of chocolate chips; I used the regular sized ones, not the minis and it was really good. I made it with the satiny glaze as others recommended which was very tasty (heated in the microwave easily). I served the cake with mint chocolate chip ice cream, which everyone loved!

Very very very good!! I followed the recipe exactly and it was super moist.  I melted some store bought icing (I just happened to find white chocolate) and then garnished with some leftover mini chips. Next time I am going to try it with the Andes mints baking pieces, and add some mint extract to the batter. This recipe is a keeper!

This turned out deliciously moist-- and unbelievably easy to make!  I followed the recipe exactly, dusting it with powdered sugar instead of making icing.  This was really good, but I think I will try the chocolate glaze that others have recommended next time.

Made this cake for my good male friend's birthday.  Quick way to a high school football player's heart.  He's been begging for another ever since.

I first came across the recipe in Cake Mix Doctor.  It's unbelievable.  You'll love it if you love chocolate.

This cake was SO good!
I made it the day before the party, and it was so moist the next day.  
My sister asked for a CHOCOLATE-CHOCOLATE cake, and this hit the spot.
EVERYONE loved it, and I will definetly be making it again.
I also mixed chocolate/butter and a little milk melted together and drizzled it on top.
It was a beautiful cake.

This cake is what it promises!  My family and friends have gone WILD over this recipe! It's super moist and luscious.  I'm gonna add a chocolate icing!
