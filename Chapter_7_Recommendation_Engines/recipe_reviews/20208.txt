This was absolutely delicious. I didn't use the carbonated water (a lemon-lime soda would have worked just as well), and I used about 3/4 cup of orange juice. It still tasted (and looked) great. I would definitely make this again.

Very Tasty.  Thought it was going to be too sweet, but it wasn't.  Made 8 servings in a glass pitcher ahead of time and then when it came time to serve, I left the pitcher out for everyone to help themselves.  I kept it cold using ice cubes frozen with OJ & cherries so that it wouldn't dilute.  I also floated thinly sliced orange slices on top.  Pretty and tasty and a good make ahead drink.

This just tastes amazing. I made a pitcher of these for our superbowl party and they made the loss a little more bearable! ;)

Very good!  I was afraid it would be a bit too sweet with all that grenadine, but it's not too bad.  I've had sweeter drinks.  I liked the layers prior to stirring it.  Nice taste of orange and peach together.  Thanks!

This drink is great!!!  I added a shot of flavored vodka, reduced the orange juice to a quarter cup, and added some lime soda.

I served these at our monthly Bunco game.  Huge hit!
