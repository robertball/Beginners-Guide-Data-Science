Really good! However, I did modify a little. I diced and cooked 3 bacon strips with the garlic, onion, and carrots until bacon was lightly browned, then put into soup. I used chicken broth (32 oz.) as the base, and doubled the amount of collards.
I served soup with freashly sliced bread that I buttered and sprinkled with freashly chopped rosemary, then toasted in oven.
Really awesome! Wife and son loved it too!!

What a great recipe....really flavorful and filling. My husband loved it.  I did make it with a little more collard greens than it calls for and a bit extra garlic.

Delicious, easy and healthy.  I doubled the recipe, started with 4 slices of chopped bacon , added a bay leaf, parsley and red pepper flakes for more flavor and skipped the quinoa.  Happy New Year!

Ended up delicious and pretty, but made a few accidental and intentional modifications. Had no carrots so diced a red pepper, and we liked the color it provided. I used a can of collards instead of fresh because I’m lazy, and the texture of the more finely chopped leaves  was nice in the soup. Also used bacon as others suggested.

BUT - I accidentally added a 32 oz box of vegetable broth rather than a smaller can - and I don’t know how this could qualify as a soup without this amount of liquid. 32 oz seemed perfect to us. Will use chicken broth for more flavor next time.

This was a rather easy recipe to put together for a quick weeknight dinner. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and started with 4oz of bacon instead of oil. I also added celery and used chicken broth instead of veggie.

We really enjoyed this. I added a lot more broth just for personal preference but otherwise made it as written. Will make again!

I enjoyed this recipe. I was looking for something different for New Years back-eyed peas. Usually I do the Texas caviar thing. Mine didn’t turn out like soup more like a side dish (broth was soaked up with the quinoa) but it was tasty

This is our new favorite soup recipe!  We took the advice of others and used a few slices of bacon and chicken broth.  I was a skeptic about the flavors but it's a really delicious soup.  We've made it twice since New Year's Day!

Added tofurky kielbasa, bay leaf, and red pepper flakes.  Used frozen instead of canned black eyed peas.  Used kale instead of collards since I couldn't find collards, so omitted the cider vinegar.  Excellent and healthy soup!

This was a great soup. I added 6 strips of center cut bacon and doubled the carrots and collard greens. My husband and I loved it.

This was awesome!  I doubled up on everything (tripled on the garlic for flavor) because I feed a family of 7 everyday (Myself, the Boyf, our four children and my mom who always makes it over in time for dinner HA!).  I added more leaves of greens, an additional 2 cups of veggie broth after doubling all the ingredients and added one package of turkey kielbasa for flavor (I cut them just like the carrots, and added it when I added the beans).  IT WAS DELICIOUS!!! I was surprised how FILLING it was! I had one bowl and was more than full!  As a side, I made bruschetta and basic salad.  My entire family...Even my picky 3 year old asked for seconds!  This is a GREAT meal to freeze if you meal prep!

Easy to make, delicious, and filling. I used half a can of collard greens instead of the fresh leaves and added with the other cans of food. Even my - I don't eat a meal without meat fiance enjoyed this soup. I will add 1/2 - 1 can more broth next year though.
