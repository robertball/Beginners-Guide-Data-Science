My husband being a big game hunter would normally fill the freezer every year and my family really enjoys the game meat but the ribs would usually be the last to go. My kids are a little picky when it comes to gaminess. This recipie was a big hit and now is a regular staple. Great idea, the meat is so tender and flavorful you have got to try it. I used a roast last time and you could cut it with a fork.

This was excellent.  I used venison steaks instead of ribs and cooked them in a dutch oven for 3 hours at 300 degrees.  They came out fork tender and shreddable.  We ate the leftovers as bbq sandwiches on buns...mmm!    This is a keeper in our venison eating home.

Used this for venison that was given to us.  Wonderful!  Everyone loved it, and 
we used it like a pot roast, then the next night in tortillas like burritos.  Superb!

I followed the recipe to a T, cooking times and all and I was not pleased.  Sorry but I won't be using this one again.

I used this recipe to do a roast as suggested. I cooked it a good bit longer than the suggested two hours – cooking it until the meat fell apart. I smothered the meat with the sauce and baked at 350 for an hour (only because I was short on time at that point and my venison was so tender already.) Very tasty – I will be making this again!

Very Delicious! The only thing I did differently, was I cooked the entire dish stove top and it turned out super moist. The perfect dish to top onto mashed potatoes! Yum!

I used this as the base of my dinner for a competition and adjusted/added a few things to my tastes...I won first place with this dish. My meat was very lean so I added butter to the water and I added more pepper and chili than the recipe. I also added a 1/4 teaspoon of pure maple syrup to the sauce, 1/3 teaspoon garlic powder extra molasses and mustard. Had three big restaurants in the area at the judges boothes that tried probably 40 or 50 wildgame dishes so I feel like this was a keeper....next time I plan to smoke the meat and smoke the BBQ sauce with the meat in cherry chips...mmmm

My husband went crazy over this stuff!  I used a big roast and just poured the sauce over it in a slow cooker, and cooked it on low for about 6 hours.  I then shredded the meat and let it soak in the juices for another hour or so.  My husband just spooned the meat into tortillas and gobbled them up.  He even had a couple of the meat rolls for breakfast the next morning.  This one is definately a keeper!  Thank You!

I used venison roast and actually roasted on grill indirect heat, for the last 2 hours covered by foil, because oven was being used at higher temperature.

This turned out really good. The only changes I made was the cut of meat; I used a venison roast. Because our meat is tender all I did was put the cut in a pan, covered with foil and cooked at 350 F. for about 1 1/2 hrs. No liquid added. 

In the meantime, I prepared the sauce. Took the roast out, shredded, poured the sauce over and returned to the oven covered again except for one corner pulled back for another 1/2 hr. 

Served BBQ sandwiches with coleslaw and it was pretty good. The next day though, oh my, this was absolutely delicious. We had friends over for Superbowl and they loved it!
