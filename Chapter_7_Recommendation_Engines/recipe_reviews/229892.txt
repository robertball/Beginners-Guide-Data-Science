I would suggest follow the recipe exact
but use different apples. I used granny smith, fuji,  johnna gold,and sometimes I throw in a pear.
The flavor is soo good.try it once I am sure you will like it.

The flavor is excellent, but my apple butter kept burning in my crockpot. I am not looking forward to cleaning it. I don't know if my crockpot heat on high is hotter than some, but I made sure to scrape out the burnt spots. Again, you end up with a great flavor, but overnight up to 24 hours seems way too long at that heat.

I made about 20 small jars of this apple butter and 10 fresh loaves of bread cut lengthwise to give me 2 loaves out of each. These were then given as Christmas gifts to all my family. They loved it so much some wanted the recipe. I had a slice of homemade bread spread some peanut butter on it and then this apple butter and it took me back to my childhood days. Thank you for this recipe, so yummy

I got 6 half pints out of this recipe, soooo easy making apple butter in the crock pot because I don't have to worry about scorching it.  I have had to throw away whole batches due to scorching.  There is nothing better on biscuits from the oven.  I thought this recipe was too light on the spices, but after cooking it, spices are spot on and the apple flavor shines!  Truly amazing..
