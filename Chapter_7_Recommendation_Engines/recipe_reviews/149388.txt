Great recipe!  I would give it 5 stars, but I made some alterations, so I don't know if the original is worth it.  I added cubed chicken, used dry spices, added some cayenne pepper and a couple chicken bouillon cubes. It was great! Next time I will double the number of roasted red peppers, just because I like the flavor.

Easy and delicious!  Loved it with chips, salsa, and black bean quesadilla for a satisfying dinner.

This recipe as written has no flavor.  Loved the concept but was flavorless.  Had to add hot sauce, chicken boullion, 2 bay leaves, 2 whole stalks of celery and a whole clove of roasted garlic.  Great concept but needs alot more flavor.

I used dry spices and added salt.  I blended the roasted red peppers in with the tomatillos.  Nice Valentines dinner with a good bread and green salad.

This was very good, but I did make a few changes.   I roasted the corn and tomatillos under the broiler for about 12 minutes before boiling.  I used a diced jalapeño in.place of the red peppers, and I used a tablespoon of cumin in place of the other spices.  I omitted the milk and stirred in 1/3 cup plain greek yogurt right before serving.
