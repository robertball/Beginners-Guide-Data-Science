This is good, alright, but to take it up a notch, use lemon flavored vodka, lime beer, and raspberry lemonade frozen concetrate.  Bam! The raspberry lemonade gives it a sweeter taste & is not as acidic.  Gone in 60 seconds at a couples shower.  Didn't have enough & had to give the recipe to everyone.

The first time I made this whas when my friends came out to visit me and my fiace and I now make it wether people are visiting or not... One thing that I like about this drink is if you keep it in the freezer, it becomes the purfect slush drink, no blender required. 

Remember, friends dont let friends blend drunk!

I only made one batch of this for my summer barbeque and I think I drank almost all of it myself! The few people that did manage to get a sip in thought it was great too! Don't be afraid to mix beer and vodka - it's wonderful!

A co-worker of mine shared this recipe with me last summer...she called it a "Skip 'N Go Naked."  It sounds like an odd combination....but it is sooooo good!!  They do go down a little too easy tho'!

~hiccup~ Ummmm, I'd give it 10 stars! Instead of water, we used crushed ice in our smoothie machine...Watch out...it does have a kick that sneaks up on you!

This is the drink of more seasons than summer.  We were introduced to it as "STRIP AND GO NAKED"  but my friend renamed it as a "DivaTini".  You Have to add 24ozs of water or it is way to sour. GREAT DRINK!!!

I was skeptical about mixing the beer and vodka, but read the reviews and decided I had to try  this.  Made a double batch for our memorial day picnic and it was gone in the first hour!  Will definitely keep this on hand for a quick summer time drink!

I made this for the 4th of July and it was delicious!  I thought vodka and beer mixed together would be weird but it wasn't at all.  The beer just made it fizzy.

My husband and I made a batch last night to try for our daughter's 1st birthday (cupcakes & cocktails). This would be her signature drink for her adult family & friends.  Well, this drink has now become my signature drink!  Dangerously delish and so pretty in pink!  It was a little too sweet for my husband so for the party - this will be great.  No one should have more than one drink at 1 year old party.  It would definitely change the atmosphere. ;)

I really wish someone would have given info of some sort about what kind of beer to use considering not all are equal. I ended up using an actual Sam Adams Summer Beer. I added a bit of sugar as the overall flavor was not as sweet as I would have hoped for. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this! As others have stated, this is indeed the perfect summer gathering beverage!

This was really good, but next time I use use less vodka.  It has quite the "kick" to it.  This Summer Beer will turn into an all season in my family!

This drink is also known as "Sneaky Petes"  Be careful!  You sit, you drink a few and before you know it you are gone.  Designate a driver after this one.  But if you're home...Enjoy!!

I really didn't love this - it was too sweet and the pink lemonade was just weird for me. I do like the idea, I think I will try it again, but use limeaid. Thanks for the recipe.

Pretty good!! Also known in my neck of the woods as "Pirate's Punch".  Replaced water with diet 7-up and added an extra can to make it not quite so strong.  Served it to my Bunco friends who raved.  Thanks for the post!

Huge hit at one of our summer barbecues! Most people were skeptical about it since it has beer in it, but they all loved it! I used cherry vodka instead of plain vodka, gave it a nice twist. Thanks for the recipe!

This is good, although I think beer margaritas are much better.  I used raspberry lemonade concentrate, used water and added sprite to dilute the alcohol since the taste was very strong.  I also added fresh raspberries and mint.  I highly recommend making it ahead of time and sticking it in the freezer and making a slushy out of it.

This is a very good, refreshing summer drink. I used rasberry lemonade instead of regular lemonade and it really masks the alcohol. They are quite strong, but isn't that the purpose? lol:) I will be making another batch this weekend.

One of my best girlfriends told me about this drink last summer, except she doesn't add the water. We make this for all our get togethers now. We've tried several frozen concentrates and no matter what it's always a hit!

Really good!  I'm not sure why it calls for a gallon sized pitcher, though.  It fits perfectly in a 2 quart pitcher.

Delicious!  A Huge hit for my summer BBQ party.  I ended up doubling the recipe, but it was such a hit we had to make another batch before the night was over!     I tripled the amount water. (Basically I made the pink lemonade according to the can directions) It was WAY too tart for us with only 12 oz. of water.  It was still plenty strong. : )

We took this to a cookout this past weekend and everybody LOVED it!  It's so good on a hot day, but one word of advice, if you're making it for a crowd, I'd double, or even triple the recipe!  You won't be sorry.

I thought this was very good, but seemed a little too strong so I first added an extra 12 oz of water, still a little too sour or something so then I added a can of sprite and it was perfect!  We all loved it!!!  We prefer the title "Skip and Go Naked" though, much more fun, although the way I modified it makes it not quite so wicked, so no one was naked, but I already have requests to bring it for 4th of July and camping!  Thanks for sharing!!!

We made it with raspberry lemonade and it was a huge hit.  I bought enoough ingredients to make a triple recipe.  At the last minute, I decided to double it instead...I should never have second guessed myself.  Our guests loved it.  Of course I am sure that the fact that it was 90 degrees on Memorial Day didn't hurt either!

So easy and you can keep everything on hand. I took this to a 70’s themed party and presented it as the Skip and-go Naked.  It was a Hit!  The pitcher was gone before you knew it and everyone wanted to know what I put in it. I chose to go with the Lime Beer and Lemon Vodka.  Next time I might try to infuse a little fresh fruit with a corresponding flavor of vodka. Blueberry sounds like a good start..

Reminds me of those good ole college parties. I typically don't like sweet drinks, but this one hit the spot. I doubled the recipe and added an extra beer. Definitely great for a hot day!

Slurped down a couple pitchers of this over the weekend by the pool... so good!! I'm going to make this one all summer long!
Don't cut the vodka down, it makes the lemonade too tart. Stick with the exact recipe and you will love it.

I have been making this for years, but we call it 'Strip & go nekked!' Don't be afraid to use other flavors of frozen lemonade: i.e. limeade, rasberry, etc.

I've made this a few times, but a bit differently.  I use no water, 1 cup of vodka, and 3 cans of any light beer along with the pink lemonade, and it is delicious!  No beer taste, not too sweet.  Garnish with fresh raspberries if desired, or fresh cranberries if serving at Christmas- it's not JUST a summer drink!!

We used to make this back in our young days, minus the water.  "Strip-n-Go-Naked", "Sip-n-Go-Naked"....love this...I still, to this day, will add lemonade to my beer...yummo! Try using the already made..Roberts Lemonade.. in the half gallon jug..works best! Then you don't have to add water, and it don't come out tart.

This is a great recipe!  You definitely have to like lemonade to enjoy it, though.  Good news for me is I like lemonade... and I like alcohol... and so did everyone else that tried it.

My husband really likes this, I think it's so-so, hence the 4 stars.  The first time I made it according to the recipe and it was a little tart for my tastes (but quite a kick).  The next time I tried to sweeten it with about 1/4 cup of sugar and I thought that was too sweet.  Maybe third time's the charm.  It could also be the beer I used (newcastle).  A lighter beer might give it a better taste.

This recipe was very easy and tasty, you won't even know there's alcohol! The only problem is that they go down quite easy so after one pitcher we were feeling the mixture :)

My roomates and I used to make these but called them porch crawlers. We would freeze the batch and then serve it slushy, yuummmm. Try adding fruit and then freezing.

This sounded and looked strange but I had the ingredients so tried it.  Very Good!  I don't like beer but this tasted more like it had grapefruit juice in it.

Made this for a get together-and everyone really loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly..perfect.  One of my guest said he would drink anything but beer--he was shocked to find out beer is what he was drinking!  Thanks Patty!

This is very excellent to sip alone or to share.  It goes down nicely and kicks in slowly.  It is now part of my stock and I get frequent request for the "pink" one.  The ingredients are readily available, that's the best part.

This is a very refreshing drink with just a bit of tartness from the lemonade. It's one of those mixed drinks where you don't taste the alcohol, so don't worry about mixing vodka & beer. We served this to dinner guests and they loved it too- highly recommended!

I have made this recipe a few times, but this time, instead of pink lemonade (didn't have it on hand) I doubled the recipe and used one 12oz can of lemonade and one 12oz can of limeade, then a total of three beers instead of two, along with the water and vodka. It was so good, nice and tart - not too sweet. Best "summer beer" drink I've had so far. Thanks for a great, flexible recipe!

I loved it.  Made it for a BBQ at the park yesterday.  I used pink lemonade.  I lessened the vodka to about 8 ounces of vodka instead (because I didn't want to get everyone drunk), and it still came out really good.  A few people thought it was a tad sweet, most people thought it was a perfect balance, with almost no alcohol taste.  So east to make too.  I just use the lemonade container as my measuring cup.  I will try with 12 ounces of vodka next time.  So refreshing!

This. Is. Brilliant!!! By far the most refreshing cocktail for anytime of the year. I made a first batch at a party I hosted and it disappeared. THEN I made a batch for Steeple Chase (Horse races in the South) and it vanished without me getting a glass. I wouldn't change anything about it. Whoever invented it should win a Nobel prize.

Made this the other evening for poker night.  Between three of us it was a hit and two pitchers later we didn't care who won the game.  Didn't have the frozen pink lemonade concetrate but did have frozen pineapple concetrate.  Was great with the pineapple next will try the pink lemonade.

Interesting, but too sweet for me.  Would add more beer next time to dilute the sweetness (maybe too sweet because I used raspberry vodka).  Followed others and put it in the freezer then scooped and added sprite...now that is delicious and I will make again.

WoooWeee...this recipe is kinda strong! I improvised by using concentrated Limeade. 1 can of Vodka, & 8 cans of cheap beer. Mixed all ing. together in a large container with a spigot. Served over ice. Yummm...not so powerful, but will catch up to you, so be careful!!

I have made this twice now, once with regular lemonade (because that's all I had in the house), and once as written.  It was a hit both times, and it means I have to have lots of lemonade stocked in the house all summer!  We went through three cans in no time flat.  A really good, refreshing summertime drink!

This is so simple that I didnt think it would be this good. This is really good with no alcohol taste. Would be great for a pool party.

When I first saw this recipe I thought it could not possibly be good. Boy was I wrong and I am glad I decided to try it. I used Raspberry Lemonade instead of Pink and Raspberry flavored Vodka. For the beer I just used a plain old Bud Light. YUMMY! Can't wait to have another BBQ so we can make more!

It's a mighty tasty drink, but boy can it sneak up on you quick!  I found it a better to mix 24-30oz of water instead of 12oz and Strawberry Guava juice is a nice substitute for the pink lemonade.

This was a delicious drink!!! a little sneaky though this drink put all of us this weekend on our behinds! a little tip to make it better is to use rasberry lemonade sprite in substitute of water and lime vodka and garnish it with a fresh cut lime on top.

Very simple and very good. We used Heineken and doubled it for a party with 10 guests. (We also served Lava Lamps.) Definitely serve on ice. And it is more widely known as Strip and Go Naked.

Yum!  Like it with the pink lemonade.  Will try limeade next time - margarita style!  When sipping on it, you definitely can't taste the high EtOH content.

I made this for our super bowl party and only me and another person drank it.  It was pretty good but you have to be really careful because the alcohol can really sneak up on ya, you can't taste the beer or the large amount of vodka in this.  The color of this drink isn't very appealing and that is what most people said when they saw it but it tasted ok.  I used a strawberry ale for my beer choice because I figured it was light in color and taste.  I am not sure yet if I would ever make these again.

I made this over the summer and forgot to review it until now, if that tells you anything. This is one of those drinks where it doesn't taste good until you've had like 3 glasses of it. We all drank it, but nobody really liked the taste of it. Thanks, but I won't be making this again.

Really really good but way too strong. I had to add 1/3 cup of sugar, twice the amount of water suggested, and a can of frozen lemonade. The end result was delicious.

I too remember these as "Skip and Go Naked's" and had them back in the early 80's as a college student at Chico State.  We made them as blended drinks though, substituting 12 oz. of ice for the water. This brings back some memories!

One of the reviewers knew this recipe as "Skip-and-go-naked" -- well, I was first introduced to these drinks (although we used plain lemonade instead of pink) way back in 1980 when camping at Cape Hatteras in NC.  I was told they were called "Strip-and-go-Naked!"....and although my memory is a bit foggy, I think we did!

I love summer drinks, but this one was WAY TOO POTENT.  Tasty, but simply too much Vodka.  I'll try to figure out how to maintain the flavor but cut back on the alcohol next time.

The beer matters: 1) Go with Amstel Light to keep the lemonade-dominant flavor. 2) Go with Abita "Andy Gator" Lager to tone down the tart lemon and add an extra kick.  ... Substitute club soda for water and play with your favorite vodka flavors knowing you will sacrifice proof for those flavors (recommend additive other than flavored vodka!).  Don't drive after consumption!

I get requests for this at every summer barbecue.  People love it.  I definitely suggest trying different flavored vodkas.  I've experimented and found making it with raspberry vodka is the best.  I then garnish with fresh mixed berries.

I did it a little differently. I used the same frozen lemonade, but filled it once with vodka.  Then I put 4 of the regular size cans of bud light.  No water.  Was so much better.

not very good, too much alcool and I had to put twice the amount of lemonade to cover the beer taste. Use a very light beer and not strong one like I did because it will only taste like beer.

Fantastic! But just a warning, if you tell people ahead of time what is in it, most of them will make a funny face and be a bit leery about trying it. If you have them try it and then try and guess the ingredients, they won't believe you when you tell them the contents. This recipe sounds bizarre, even gross, but it goes down like lemonade and is a simple and inexpensive party drink!

Super delicious. I accidently got regular lemonade instead of pink lemonade but it was still good. Definitely will try with different vodkas, beers and flavored lemonade.

I make summer beer but instead of the water I use 2 bottles of beer and I use regular lemonade instead of pink.  I think the pink lemonade will make it too sweet.

Grrreat summer drink recipe!   Everyone loves it.  When I first  got the recipe years ago, it called for whiskey instead of vodka.  I don't like beer or whiskey but this drink was kick-butt!!!  So I would suggest trying it either way.  
SERVE WELL CHILLED!  (I like the slushie idea.  Will be trying that!)

I took credit for this, as though I came up with the idea myself, that's how YUMMY this is!  I used Sprite instead of water to give the drink some fizz.  We also added a pint of raspberries and sliced a lime for garnish.  I have made this 4 times and have run out too early each time.  AMAZING!!

Yummy!  We serve these at our last barbeque.  I have to make 3 batches!  You can play with the vodka flavor too.  I use raspberry flavored vodka and lime flavored beer.
