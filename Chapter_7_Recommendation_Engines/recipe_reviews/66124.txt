An oldie but a goodie. Made these with pre-schoolers for a fun activity. We heated the butter and marshmallows in the microwave. Wore food prep plastic gloves that were sprayed with butter flavored Pam. Decorated with red cinnamon buttons and little cake decorator red stars and various other candies. I shaped the wreaths, the kids did the candy part :=)

I have always used Corn Flakes.  Does not add as much additional Sugar as review below that suggest Frosted Flakes.  Our Memaw always used red hots for decor; but not everyone liked them and they fall off.  For mailing to my sons who must have them each christmas.  I just dot with red icing.  I see I could uses several colors.  Merry Christmas everyone.

Great, just got through finishing them.  I made mine smaller and got 33, which was a lot better than 12. I followed the recipe, except for using the 1/4 cup measurement as I wanted smaller wreaths. I am going to try freezing some of them to see how that turns out. I didn't have a problem but buttered my hands frequently and work fast. Toward the end, it got a little gooey.
