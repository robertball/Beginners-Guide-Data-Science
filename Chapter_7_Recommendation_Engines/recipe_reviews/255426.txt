This turned out so good for us! I did tweak it though. I marinated the meat like the recipe stated and made the filling as directed. When I filled the steak and rolled them, I had so much filling leftover that I decided to use that in the gravy too. So I deglazed my pan with some red wine and added my canned gravy to the filling mixture. It made a great sauce for the finished product. Also, to my potatoes, I added some dried minced onions, some parsley flakes and some grated parmesan to give it some additional flavor. This was a great dinner and I love how quick and easy these potatoes are to make!

We really enjoyed these!  They couldn't have been easier to make and the flavor was great.  I actually realized when it was too late to go to the store that I was out of bell pepper and I ended up doubling the mushroom instead and it was still delicious.  I had never used canned gravy before- ever- but it was tasty and a timesaver for sure and it really worked nicely to pull together the steak and potatoes.  I really loved how nicely the potatoes turned out, both the flavor and texture were great.  Thanks to those short cuts I was able to pull this together for my family on a busy weeknight and make everyone's taste buds happy!

Oh em yum! This is hands down an amazing recipe! I'm not too much a fan of canned gravy, but understand it can be a timesaver. If you have time, make the gravy at home and it will still be a five star recipe.

This was very tasty. I used brachiole steaks.  They come paper thin so it was perfect for this dish. The steak is a little fatty so it’s great for roasting. Keeps the moisture in. I had 8 steaks which was the perfect amount with one onion, two small red bell peppers and 2 cups mozzarella for the filling.  I didn’t add 5he mushrooms. I served this with butter flavor Idahoan potatoes for the fam and smashed cauliflower for me.  Yummy. Along with beef gravy in a jar. This was good enough to make again. .

I didn't make any changes.   The taste was okay, but it was definitely on the tough side even though I was careful not to overcook.  I think if I did this one again I would marinate the meat a lot longer or tenderize it some first.  I would also add a little garlic and red wine to the sauce.

These were delicious. I did a few rolls minus the mushrooms for the mushroom haters, I very much preferred them with the mushrooms. I forgot the gravy while I was at the store so we didn't have gravy with it but this dish was still great without it. 
I rarely use instant potatoes, to be honest I usually mess them up so I avoid them. But the Idahoan Signature™ Russets Mashed Potatoes came together easily and they were pretty good. Good texture and flavor.

This recipe was true to my heart, as a fan of Philly Cheesesteaks!  I loved this steak roll-up served with a side of Idahoan Mashed Potatoes, it truly is comfort food at it's best!  The flavors melded together perfectly!

Very good and easy. Perfect for a work night.  I loved that the flavors were just like a Cheesesteak.   The potatoes were even better than I expected.  I don't usually use jarred gravy but I was pleasantly surprised by that too. I will make this one again.
