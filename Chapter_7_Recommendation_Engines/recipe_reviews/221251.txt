Quite easy to throw together and adjust if you don't have something.  I used a yellow bell pepper (what I had) and a different kind of mushroom, but it was still very good.  It may need more salt or other seasonings depending on your preference.  It filled me up!

Excellent! I made some small changed: added cubed beef and replaced the chicken stock by beef stock. Also added some fresh sage and thyme. Great turnout.

This is a good base but is very bland if made as is. I added tomatoes just because I like them and lots of celery salt, garlic salt, pepper, cumin, because it needed flavor! Itâ€™s a quick recipe And out great after doctoring a bit.

Was skeptical at first by the lack of spices but this soup was soooooo good. I had 3 bowls!!! I added crumbled sausage just because it sounded good. It would have been fine with out it. Thanks for the great recipe.
