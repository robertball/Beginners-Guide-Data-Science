Hello Chef,
Searching the net some years ago I came across a "new" recipe for grilling Steak.  
Yep....just like what you're doing.  Other names were Eisenhour Steak, Dirty Steak, Caveman Steak and so on.   (The "Tomahawk Steak "  is an impressive beast but you'll need to know the butcher. See the video on line). 
Their recipes called for either Rib Eyes or Strips.  And they really do cook up quite nicely .    Just a few thoughts:  

Remind the readers NOT to use any oil, my idiot brother, a retired meat salesman, thought it was a necessity and he not only ruined his steaks, he  near had the local Fire Dept over for dinner!  

Use a chimney starter, no fluids!!!
Be sure the meat is patted dry and it cooks best when at room temp.  
They said to season with salt just before grilling but no pepper or other dry herbs/spices as some say it burns.  
I do believe a 2" cut is the most impressive and the  recipes call for a quick 4 to 6 minute sear on each side and then tented in a 250 degree oven for a 15 minute or so rest.  If in doubt use a thermometer.  

As you always say.......Enjoy!

Didn't have a mortar/pestle, so I used a garlic press instead. Also, I didn't put it directly on top of the coals, but it still turned out great--everyone loved it, and the intense flavor the sauce gave it was perfect!

I didnâ€™t have access to charcoal so I built a regular campfire with jack Pine. I let it burn down to the coals and followed the recipe and it turned out amazing.

10 minutes on each side was a bit too much. Made pulling at 120 problematic. Tougher cut like top round could benefit from overnight marinade. 

Cut it london broil-style. Dinner guests loved it!
