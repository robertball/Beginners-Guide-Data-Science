Made some changes that brought this up to a five star rating!  One, don't melt the butter, soften it.  Then mix the other ingredients {I omitted the rosemary  and left out the garlic salt in favor of additional garlic powder} in the with softened butter and spread on the bread.  When you have only five minutes of baking time left, add a liberal amount of mozzarella cheese to the top.  After five minutes it will be just melted and nice and gooey when you take it out of the oven!  Perfect!!!

The flavor of the butter is absolutely delicious on the French bread. I will, however, omit the garlic salt next time as it is too salty. This recipe makes more than is needed for one loaf of bread (probably just the right amount for one and one-half to two loaves).

I cut this recipe in half, used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and I used sandwich bread that needed to be used up. (Ghetto? Sure. But it works just as any other bread would.) Family thought this was very tasty. I did not have any, I just looked at it with longing.

My family loved this, didn't have a french loaf, just some "wonder" slice bread, slightly toasted the bread and then put spread on both sides and cook about 5 minutes longer then the recipe called for, let sit a couple of minutes it turned out great. Oh yeah the most important thing use unsalted butter, that way when you use the garlic salt it will not turn out too salty.

This is the BEST garlic bread I've ever tasted!!!!  The only changes that i made were to just soften the butter instead of melting it....it spread much easier, and i also added more parmesan on top before i baked it.  I will definately used this recipe again and again!

I thought this was good, except it was too salty.  Next time I would cut the garlic salt in half and add more garlic powder.

Great garlic bread.  I recommend using more garlic powder (3/4 tsp.) and less garlic salt (1/2 tsp.).  Otherwise good as stated.  This way it will be more garlicky than it is salty which is how we like it.  It was gobbled up at a recent bbq.  Thanks!

I made this recipe last weekend for a dinner party.  It was AWESOME!  The one reviewer who said it didn't have the right combination of spices must have done something wrong, because this is the best and easiest garlic bread i've ever made!  Also the recipe calls for 1/2 cup of butter which is one stick, not two as one reviewer said.  The rosemary gives it it's unique flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly, and added just a scant bit of freshly grated parmesan cheese on top.  This is my new 'bread'!  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent garlic bread! I followed other advice and used no garlic salt all garlic powder and did not melt the butter - made it into a spread.  However maybe my oven is different it's brand new - I heated it to 425 for 10 - 12 minutes for a great crispy garlic bread!

I used homemade butter I had in the freezer and didn't bother to melt it.  Just stirred in the garlic salt, Parmesan and a Tuscan seasoning blend similar to the indivual herbs called for.  I used good, crusty rolls, which I simply placed on a cookie sheet and threw under the broiler for a few minutes.  Easy, quick, VERY flavorful, crispy, and pretty!

Fantastic creation Sarah! I did reduce the garlic salt to 1/4 tsp, which was perfect. We thought this was easy and very unqiue tasting garlic bread. Makes for an excellent addition to any meal. Thanks!

Excellent!  I replaced the garlic salt with fresh minced garlic (about 2 or 3 cloves) and I still used garlic powder -- it is garlic bread after all.  I also doubled the parmesan cheese.  I'll never buy garlic bread again.  This was easy and so worth the effort!  Thank you!

Since I live alone I used this on a split hogy roll.  It was great but I had lots of left over butter mixture so I used it on mashed potato the next day. YUM! You have to try it.

This was really good!  It wasn't overpowering, yet the flavor of the herbs came through wonderfully.  I will be using this from now on!  (I used this mixture over potatoes that I cut in half lengthwise, scored the tops in a criss-cross pattern, and baked at 400 degrees until done.  Was great!)

When making garlic bread for my grandchildren I use hot dog buns. I finish spliting them and the kids love them. They are easier for little hands to hold.

Really good, quick and easy. I never use garlic salt. Just use garlic powder and add salt to taste (you may not even need any salt if using salted butter). I used the parmesan cheese from the green can because that's all I had, and it was delicious.

This is my new go-to recipe for garlic bread! Made it twice this week!!! I change the serving size to 2 (just me and my husband) and it makes the perfect amound for 4 pieces of whatever type of nice bread we have in the kitchen.

Absolutely fabulous!  I used French bread instead and also increased the amount of rosemary.  I found with the French bread, it was necessary to cook the bread longer, so plan accordingly.  Everyone loved this recipe!!!

awesome!  looking for an alternative to the nasty preservative filled frozen options, I stumbled upon this recipe. I only use 1/2 stick of butter, lots of parmesan, much less garlic salt, then some garlic powder, basil, oregano & italian seasoning.  baked at 350 along with baked spaghetti and it was perfect after 10 mins.  gave 4 stars because the garlic salt as written was way too salty at my first attempt.

As long as you dont melt the butter but soften it, this is a great recipe. I used it on pita bread, with some extra parmesan cheese.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I did not use the garlic salt rather just regular garlic powder and table salt. The cooking temp was a bit too low and I ended up broiling at the end. Very Good.

Altho the directions are conflicting(use "melted butter" but you're supposed to "spread" that on the bread??) & the baking temp turned the top of my bread hard well before the buttered side had a chance to even heat up, I'm going to rate this a 4. My boys thought this was the best garlic bread they've ever eaten!! I'm not a fan of rosemary but thought it was very good also. After the 10 min in the oven at 300, I pulled the bread out & cranked it up to 450 to "toast" the buttered side.

Well, as pretty as the bread was, it didn't live up to it. I made this to a T, and first little swat at the tongue to make sure it was fine, I got a mouth full of pure saltiness. It was very over whelming. I think there is a mistake in the garlic salt and the garlic powder in this recipe. I thought MAN! I need to  fix this. So a 2nd batch was made and changed the garlic salt to 1/8 tsp and garlic powder to 1 tsp and added a 2nd tbsp of Parmesan, it worked out totally better. Becareful with this recipe on the salt content, it will over power your bread.

Excellent! I took everyone's advice and only used about 1/8 tsp of garlic salt and more garlic powder. I also used fresh chopped basil because I had a bunch on hand. The bread turned out wonderful. I will definitely make this again.

Over the course of the last year plus, I have tried several of the garlic bread recipes from this website--all of which were great.  Nevertheless, by a fairly good margin, this one was the best.  It's simple and elegant--just the right combination of spices.  My family commented on the flavor through the entire meal.  I can't imagine how this recipe could be improved upon.  In a word--excellent!

This was a great recipe - a nice savory flavor - not too much garlic.  I like to mix up the butter spread and then let it sit in the fridge for about 30 minutes.  I don't have a pastry brush, so it's easier to spread the butter onto the bread with a knife after it has firmed up a bit.

This is a good basic recipe for garlic bread.  The overall flavour was very enjoyable although the garlic was not as pronounced as we would have preferred.

Two stars as written, four by the time I was done with it.  I mixed the spices/parmesan cheese with room temperature butter (to make a spread).  I took a taste after mixing it and and thought it tasted a whole lot like regular butter.  Not nearly enough seasoning for me!  I added a tablespoon of italian seasoning, a teaspoon of crushed dried rosemary, and a 1/4 cup of parmesan.  Now we were on to something.  I spread the mixture on fresh french bread, and baked it at 350 until it reached the desired crispness.  It turned out more than great.

I pretty much eye balled the dried herbs instead of measuring. I added extra parmesan until the butter became pastey. The thicker consistancy worked very well. Will use this recipe again =)

Really good bread, served it with this site's Ground Beef Zucchini Skillet.  As did other reviewers, I chose to soften the margarine rather than melt it, and then mixed in the seasonings as listed.  I used a popular grocery store's Artisan garlic peppercorn bread, spread the seasoned margarine on each half, and then wrapped it in aluminum foil and baked at 400 degrees for 15 minutes.  Yummy!  I'm always looking for new variations on garlic bread.

I would take away the combo of garlic salt, and the use of garlic powder. If anything keep it just one or the other. And I would say to use garlic powder over the salt.

Excellent flavor. My husband really liked the rosemary in it. I only had 1 1/2 sticks of butter and the recipe calls for 2 sticks. With just the 1 1/2 sticks, it was too much butter. I think you only need around 1 stick. I also used freshly grated parmesan cheese and added about 2-3 Tablespoons to the mix. Great variation to Garlic Bread.

Not enough or the right combination of spices.  I liked using the French bread instead of Italian, though.  I won't be using this recipe again.

Used powder instead of salt because I season my pasta sauce and didn't want it too salty. I suggest using Italian seasoning because you add all to taste and its already mixed so well! Other than that the recipe was great!!

I was so pleasantly surprised by this recipe. I thought it was going to be your standard "herbed butter", but it was so much better! The addition of parmesan cheese (I used freshly grated) really punches up the flavor. I did tweak it slightly, based on what I had on hand. I didn't have any rosemary or garlic salt, so I substituted oregano and just used a total of 1 1/2 Tbls. garlic powder. Oh, and I didn't melt the butter, I just softened it and mixed everything in with a fork. This is now my new "go to" toasted garlic bread recipe!!

A nice, quick bread for those evenings when you're in a rush to get dinner on the table. I would omit the garlic salt and use all garlic powder, and I wouldn't bother melting the butter either, as other reviewers have mentioned.  I do love the addition of herbs to this garlic bread; I thought the thyme was especially good in this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

Loved this bread!  I used unsalted butter and knocked the garlic salt down to 1/4 teaspoon.  I then upped the garlic powder to 1/2 teaspoon.  This was perfect.  I cut the bread into slices and then spread the mixture over each piece.  Baked for about 8 minutes and then popped them under the broiler for a couple minutes to toast them up.  Excellent!

It turned out amazing and had raved reviews :) I made the following changes though: No garlic salt or garlic powder - I used minced garlic instead. I used Parsley instead of basil and thyme. I also added a tablespoon of olive oil. I didn't melt the butter all the way - just 5 or 10 second in the microwave for the butter to have a paste texture.   And lastly, instead of baking it at 350 degrees, I broiled it for 5 minutes.

I omitted the garlic salt and doubled all the other seasonings, I also grilled the bread on the grill, first grill the flat side of a length wise sliced loaf.  Flip it over and add the butter\seasoning and finish grilling.  Great taste.

I omitted the garlic powder and garlic salt and when it 5 cloves of fresh roasted garlic. I also sprinkled it with finely shredded mozzarela cheese. Terrific though next time I would cut back on the butter and spread it thinner.

The absolute best garlic bread recipe... I too would cut the salt slightly and increase the garlic powder...although I like salty stuff....I think softening instead of melting makes it easier,too otherwise the parmesan sits in the bottom of the dish making it hard to spread evenly

I really loved this.  I did not use rosemary because I do not like it.  I used parsley instead.

My family loved this!  I took everyone's advise about not using the garlic salt........which I'm glad I did because it had just enough salt.  I used minced garlic and it was yummy!!!  And, I used softened butter...not melted...it was nice spread.  Oh, and my boys love cheese so I also topped it with mozzerela cheese!!!

OMG! I didn't heed the others advice about the garlic salt, because I like foods that are well seasoned.  Mistake!  My husband asked my if I spilled the salt on the bread.  Cut the garlic salt to 1/2 tsp., it will be enough because parmesan is a salty cheese.  I still recommend that you try this bread because the herb combo is great.

I really liked the flavor of this bread.  I think I will cut back on the garlic salt as well.  I am a bonafide salt-a-holic and it was still too much for me.  If you are at all sensitive to salt levels, you really should cut the garlic salt back.  It was still really really good

Nice mild flavored garlic bread. I would have preferred more garlic flavor though. I used 2 T of grated parmesan. This was nice, but I prefer the tang of the mayo based ones. I didn't melt the butter, just softened it so it was spreadable.

I omitted the garlic salt, and otherwise followed the recipe.  The flavor was great, but the bread was very dry (or crispy).  I prefer my french bread soft in the middle and moist, so I think I will try this recipe again but put the halves back together and wrap the loaf in foil to bake.

This was really good garlic bread Sarah. I adjusted the seasonings to suit our tastes and spread this on a sliced baguette rather than french bread.  I also added a spoonful of mayo and some onion powder.  My son claims this as one of his favorites. Thanks for sharing.

My sister-in-law made this with fresh garlic, and fresh thyme with the other ingredients. It was so tasty without being too oily.  I loved it so much I went ahead and added it to my recipe box for future reference.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with us!

Must of done something wrong as it was verrrrrrry salty.  I did add about 1/2 t of paprika, but I don't think that would of made it salty.  I will definitely try again, because I think without as much salt it will be as close as I've ever come to duplicating our favorite frozen garlic bread!!!!

Great cheesy bread to serve with your favorite pasta! I was out of Rosemary so substituted an Italian seasoning for the Rosemary, thyme, and basil. Still turned out great!

This is my go to garlic bread.  I use all garlic powder instead of garlic salt, and I usually just stick the bread under the broiler for a couple minutes instead of baking it.  I often make it with sliced Italian bread instead of French bread.

My husband quadrupled this recipe to make for a catered party, to be served with taco soup and a salad.  It was so easy and yummy.  We had lots of compliments on it. It sure beats buying an expensive bottle of the spice mixture, as you know what is in this one!  He made the recipe as written. We didn't think it was too salty.

I made this with English Muffins, omitted the rosemary as I didn't have it. Topped with mozz. cheese. It was AMAZING! (Actually, I didn't have any garlic powder or garlic salt, so I used frozen garlic in the melted butter mixture)

5-Stars with tweaks (yeah, yeah, I know people hate that...).  I used real garlic (2 cloves through a press) and omitted the rosemary.  With the Parmesan, it doesn't need salt, garlic or otherwise.  I agree that the butter does NOT need to be melted, just a little softened.

Fixed 'as is' is totally awesome. All the ingredients, except French bread, are usually in everyone's pantry. A very good recipe to use on the spur of the moment when garlic bread is a must. I used just a pinch of garlic salt but that is just a personal preference. Made with French bread or with sandwich bread of your choice, this is a recipe to keep on hand and give to company when they rave about it. And they will. Thanks for sharing.

Oh how I wish I had read the reviews before I made this!!  It would have been a 5 star recipe except it was so darn salty!  Next time I would either use unsalted butter or swap out at least half the garlic salt for plain garlic powder.  Other than the saltiness though, the flavors of this bread were really good.

Delicious! The only adjustments I made were: I omitted the garlic salt, and added about 1 tsp. of freshly chopped garlic. I also cooked the bread for a few minutes longer than the recipe calls for, and I added some more shredded parmesan on top for the last few minutes of baking. It was wonderful! I will be making this again!!

Tasty!  After reading reviews, I skipped the garlic powder and even with being a salt enthusiast, I found the bread just a smidge too salty.  I had neither rosemary nor basil, so, I improvised with "Pampered Chef: Italian Seasoning Mix" (onion, garlic, oregano, basil, marjoram).  Like others suggested, I softened the butter instead of melting and then mixed-in the spices, providing a nice spreadable mixture.

Just used garlic powder, not the salt, and oregano/basil/parmesan.  Very good!  This makes enough for one long loaf of bread.

Fantastic flavour! Only issue is that it was too dry, as written. After reading reviews, I made the following minor changes & it's my new go to recipe: I use 1½ teaspoons fresh minced garlic (can increase to 2 tablespoons) instead of garlic powder. I do not melt margarine & increase it to 3/4 cup + add 1 tablespoon olive oil. I use part-skim grated Parmesan cheese, to cut fat. Can add shredded part-skim marble cheese the last 5 minutes of baking, if desired but I don't find it's necessary. I make ahead & freeze unbaked by placing in a 9" x 13" pyrex dish, wrapped in plastic then sealed with heavy duty foil. Thanks Sarah!

Yum! This was so great. I didn't have garlic salt, so I used 1/2 teaspoon of regular salt and 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder. Instead of dried rosemary I placed sprigs of fresh rosemary on top before baking. Gave it wonderful flavor. I ignored the cheese. Also, I used Portuguese bread, it really soaked up the butter. I will make this again.

My husband had an important business meeting here at the house last night and I made dinner for them.  They went CRAZY over this bread!  I'm not a fan of all the herbs but they sure were and I would have it again myself.

An easy, decent recipe- perfect for when you don't have much time. Rather than melting the butter, I left it a little more thick so I could spread it simply and added a bit of sauted, minced garlic for a better flavor, thanks!

This was the best garlic bread I've ever had! And I'm quite the garlic fanatic. I did change though, by letting the better soften instead of melt, omitting both the garlic salt and powder and adding double the parm cheese. So delicous. I also prefer Ace bakery bread (Loblaws) french stick and used it instead.

Definitley good but way too much salt.  The garlic was prettty heavy too.  Next time I will cut the salt in half and replace the garlic powder with real garlic.  It was really buttery too, which was yummy, but if you wanted to cut the butter you could and it would still be great.

This was really good! I was looking for a last minute parmesan garlic toast/bread and this recipe fit the bill. I used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt, but still used the garlic powder as another reviewer suggested. I used a generous amount of grated parmesan cheese as well. I topped each slice with shredded parmesan cheese to get even more cheesy goodness.

This makes awesome garlic bread.  The changes that I made were:  1. no rosemary (didn't have any), 2. 1 tsp of garlic powder, and 3. used 1/8 tsp of onion salt and I used unsalted butter.

Good flavor combination and a nice change from our usual mozzarella cheesy bread.  Instead of mixing everything together, I just buttered the bread slices and then sprinkled a little of each spice and the parmesan on each one.  Served with Pasta e Fagioli.  I will definitely make this again.

OK.....but just "OK".  I had two 20 year old college students and a former fireman as judges.  Nice herbage, however it needed ALOT more garlic to be considered "Garlic bread". I would use fresh minced garlic in the future.  There was none left...but I was feeding the masses!

Absolutely, delightfully delicious! We loved this bread. I planned on just softening the butter, but left it in the microwave too long. I used a basting brush to put the mixture on the bread, which worked perfectly. I added shredded mozzarella cheese the last few minutes of baking, then broiled it for another minute or so. YUM!

There is no reason to ever buy frozen or pre-made garlic bread with this recipe, EVER.  An entire pound of french loaf disappeared at my table of 4 people.  The freshness of the bread is directly related to how supremely excellent this tastes.  The semll that eminates from the oven before you can eat it is like a cruel game your nose plays on your tongue... I love it.

Delicious garlic bread. I could see how some people would find it salty, just make sure you use butter without salt added...or just eliminate the garlic salt and put more garlic powder. I add a little extra of all the herbs because I love herbs!

My family loved this parmesan herb butter!  I didn't have french bread so I used ciabatta bread in its place.  The only change I made was to use fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt.  My son said it smelled great just mixing it up.  I will make this again!

Just finished "sampling" this, as I've prepared it for a sliced ciabatta loaf that I'm serving to company with tonight's dinner.  It is AWESOME--I think it would make my running shoes taste great. :-) I did add some additional parmesan--probably about 3 tablespoons total.  THANKS for a great recipe.

This was a little too salty. I would cut the garlic salt in half. 

***I added a mexican cheese blend on top while baking and it came out really good***

Followed recipe exactly. Not sure if I would like it, so use to just garlic and parmesan but it was really good.  The spices are very mild and add just a hint of flavour.
Thanks,

Very good and easy.  The herbs were a pleasant surprise.  I softened the butter rather than melt it and added more parmesan.  Really liked baking for a softer bread, I'm used to putting it under the broiler.  Will make this again!

I have a huge rosemary bush in my yard, so instead of using dried rosemary I cut a stem of it the length of the bread and laid it in the middle of the bread. Then I wrapped it in foil and baked it at 350 for 15 minutes. Then I removed the rosemary before cutting and serving it. It gave it a really nice flavor and everyone enjoyed it. I also used softened butter instead of melted and more parmesean cheese to make a spread rather than a liquid. Hope this helps!!!

This was nice. I used real garlic (2 cloves), eliminated the garlic salt and added fresh chopped parsley. Served with CALAMARI IN RED WINE and TOMATO SAUCE from this site.

I substituted olive oil for the butter because my girl friend cannot have butter. I also added some minced garlic. I made the mixture and refrigerated it.  It coagulated and spread like butter on the bread. The bread was delicious.

I made this tonight like the recipe except that I did 1/4 t instead of where you were supposed to do an 1/8 t and I did 1t of garlic with parsley and a 1/4t of garlic salt.  After that I put a 5 cheese Italian blend and cook the bread at 375 for 10 minuets.  Everyone loved it and it got devoured quickly!  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this exactly as directed and it's great. If you like to make garlic bread with softened butter on hot dog buns, then that's great too, and you should add your recipe instead of rewriting somebody else's in a comment.

This was very good, I doubled the garlic powder and omitted the garlic salt. It makes a lot and I had some leftover so the next night I melted it on top of some little boiled potatoes. Delicious!

The recipe was a little salty but it still was very easy to make and tasty. I would just go light on the garlic salt just a tad. Other than that great recipe. Also i used Texas tots bread instead of French bread so that could’ve been the reason why. So if you use Texas toast bread just go light on the garlic salt

This bread was delicious! I soften unsalted butter as others suggested (room temp or heat it in the microwave for a few seconds). I  also omitted the garlic salt, using only garlic powder. I eyeballed the herbs, used freshly grated parm and added grated pecorino romano to the butter. Spread the mixture on fresh Italian bread, and heated in the oven on 350F until toasted. YUM! I served it along with the "World's Best Lasagne" recipe on this site. Next time I'll try using minced garlic instead of garlic powder.

Delicious! Looking at the ingredient list I was a little concerned about the salt intake with this recipe, so removed the garlic salt and replaced it with minced garlic and extra garlic powder. Topped this with mozzarella and served alongside risotto. It went down a treat.

Not crazy about this one. Used unsalted butter but it was still too salty so I threw in another half stick of butter. Too plain so dumped a lot of parm in. Still too plain so added mozzarella under the broiler. Still not that good. Even though it's more work I'm going back to Roasted Garlic Bread on this site. That one is soooo much better. Nothing beats real garlic.

I rarely use salted butter but I did for this and left the garlic salt out. Added Smoked Paprika and minced 1 clove of garlic and grated real Parmesan Cheese   Into it. Mixed it all up and let chill for a good 3 hours so everything would get happy. Yummie!!

Delicious! Easy and fun way to add some variety to your bread! :) Also easy to customize to your own tastes. I made it according to the recipe this time (and it was great!), but might omit the Rosemary next time or make some other changes. Great, basic recipe!

Thank you Sarah, this is delightful. I love the herbs, takes the Garlic Bread up several notches.  Two things of note, if you use unsalted butter the garlic salt can still be used. Be aware that not all garlic salts are equal - some are saltier than others.  My preference is to use salted butter and no garlic salt at all - just increase the garlic powder to taste.  Like other reviewers I only softened the butter, much easier to spread.  Although I have also melted the butter and added minced fresh garlic to it. This actually worked very well.  Use a pastry brush to get it on the bread.

I gave this 4 stars following the recipe as provided, very good. The second time I made it, I brushed some of the mixture on the bottom and topped the bread with mozzarella cheese. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing.

This is amazing garlic bread! I actually did away with the garlic salt and garlic powder and used actual garlic instead. Plus, I left off the parmesan (by accident) and it tasted fantastic! I don't even bother with the parmesan now because it tastes so good without it, though it could be a nice variation to try in the future.

Much to salty for my taste. Next time, I will cut the garlic salt in half.

This bread is easy and so delicious. I did not melt the butter. I used fresh garlic minced. I prefer to cut bread in one inch slices and butter each side. I turn them over after first side is browned and crispy so the other side is toasted as well. I usually make just 4 slices at a time but I make all the spread. It keeps well in the refrigerator and is available when I want to make more

Too salty, will  convert some of the garlic salt to garlic powder next time, and may use unsalted butter.  Definitely soften butter instead of melting.

Easy to prepare.  I agree with others - omit the garlic salt and maybe just add some more garlic powder to taste.

I thought the recipe was great! Like others said, I softened the butter instead of fully melting it. It spreads better that way. And I will use a bit less garlic salt and a bit more garlic powder as it was a tad too salty. But not TOO salty that it couldn't be eaten ~ every last piece was finished by my crew! :)

This will be my go-to recipe from now on.  Just the right amount of herbs and cheese.  I did use all garlic powder and the "powdered" parmesan from the green can as I had to take it to a pot luck.  It was a good decision, but I would use the fresh grated kind as personal preference.

I looked up this recipe as a last minute thing, so was forced to use what I had on hand. I don't buy garlic salt, so I used garlic powder. My dried rosemary is like dried twigs, I need to see if they sell it in a more ground up form. I tried smooshing it with my fingers, which only broke them in half maybe. I'd like them more finely ground, but I liked the flavor. I happened to have a completely softened stick of butter on the counter, so I used that. At the last minute I realized it was my husband's no salt butter (I use salted butter for everything, he uses his own for buttering toast and such). So I did add salt to this mixture, but I don't think it was enough. Maybe had I used salted butter AND garlic salt, it would have had more flavor. I didn't melt the butter, didn't think it was necessary. I just mixed it all together and buttered slices of whole grain sandwich bread. I put it under the broiler until it was browned. It takes a thick layer of this butter mixture to make it moist and not too dry. I also want to try leaving out the cheese the next time. I don't think it really adds anything special, and have a feeling it just dries it out as well.

I have used this basic recipe but spiced it up with some prosciutto and parsley instead of the rosemary. I also used half the amount of garlic salt and used more garlic powder instead. The butter should be softened, but not melted, it spreads much easier that way. If your family likes "meat and cheese" then this recipe with the addition of the prosciutto will make them very happy!

I absolutely adore this recipe. I happened to make a few alterations because i didn't have garlic salt on hand, i completely omitted it from the recipe. My family loves garlic so i'm pretty sure i used double if not more garlic powder and i also added about 2 tablespoons of freshly minced garlic. The rosemary has such a great flavor. It almost tasted like the spiced oil you would get to dip your bread in at an Italian restaurant. This recipe is definitely worth making over and over agin. Thank you for sharing:]

This was awesome. I softened the butter and used real parmesan cheese. I pre-slice the bread (but not all the way through) and put the mixture inbetween each slice. I then wrapped it in foil and baked it. Everyone loved it!!

I tried this recipe tonight as a spur of the moment side for our spaghetti, in place of my bland bread, butter, and garlic dish I just throw together. This was a hit and it was so simple! My family very much enjoyed this. As always, I followed the recipe exactly.

Delicious! As others have noted, if you're using salted butter you can just cut out the other salt altogether.

This was excellent. My boyfriend (who is a very, very picky eater) said that this is the best garlic bread he's ever had. Very good! I admit, I did play around with it a little: I'm not much for measuring ingredients, so I just eyeballed everything. Also, I forgot to buy basil and thyme before I left the store, so I made due without. For convenience's sake, I also used canned Parmesan. I think this recipe was great how I did it, but I'm sure it would be much, much better if followed exactly. Next time, I will definitely be better prepared and stick to the recipe!

This was tasty! I liked that it wasn't real heavy, but more of a traditional garlic bread. I used softened butter instead of melted, but kept the recipe the same otherwise. I will be using this recipe again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Pretty good & the family ate it!  I didn't have any thyme, but used all other ingredients.  I also took some other reviewers suggestions and added shredded cheese at the last 5 minutes.  It was a great side to the posted Pizza Pasta dinner and a side salad.

I usually buy the garlic cheese bread from the store to save time, but I will not be doing that any more. This bread was delicious! It was better than the frozen bread and was not hard at all. I followed advice of others and just softnened the butter. Thank you.

The softened butter was a good idea. It spread very consistantly across the loaf. Used a special Garlic Plus powder instead of just regular garlic powder and it had a nice kick. Very good garlic bread indeed. Will definitely be making this again. Thanks!

With some modifications, this could be worthy of 5 stars.  The bread came out a tad bit on the dry side, but the flavors were nice.  I used French bread and am wondering if there was too much of it to cover with the butter spread.  I used softened butter, not melted and opted for minced garlic in addition to 1/8 tsp of garlic powder.

Less is more for me. There are too many different seasonings on this bread. Covers the garlic taste. I would rather go with a simpler recipe.

Came out pretty good, I would reduce the amount of butter used next time. But I will definately make it again.

This was just okay to me. I actually thought it was a little bland but that's just my taste.

Thank you.  I used fresh rosemary because its what I had, and I inadvertently added 1/2tsp of garlic powder.  A very nice healthy alternative to jarred spreads and frozen preservative ladden breads.
