I think it would be better with less almond flour.  Next time I'll cut the flour in half.  It gave the meatloaf a strange consistency and flavor.  Couple adjustments and it will be a good dinner.

I didn't care for it. Was on the dry side and not enough flavor; which I was surprised because of the horseradish.  I'll need to experiment with portions to fit my taste.
