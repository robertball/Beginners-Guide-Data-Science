Wow! This is definitely very refreshing and not to mention a wonderful combination of colors and flavors. No matter what assortment of fresh fruit you use it's bound to be good so use your favorites and use the recipe as a guide. I added chopped peaches to mine and used fresh strawberries. Baking the chips keeps this a little healthier and lower in fat. So, for the cinnamon chips I used reduced fat tortillas and cut them with a pizza cutter which made things a lot easier. I sprayed them with butter flavored Pam and sprinkled them with the cinnamon sugar. I baked them at 350 for 8 minutes flipped them and baked them for another 7 minutes. They were crispy and delicious - next time I would double the amount because they went fast. This got a lot of compliments not only for taste, but for creativity. I'll definitely make this again - great recipe!

This is definitely a refreshing treat and a  healthy snack for the kids. We've used graham crackers or the graham cracker sticks for dipping too! If you really want to save time, throw the fruit into your food processor and just chop!

Very good recipie. I love all the different flavours I got rom this mixture! It's going on my favourites!I also added two peaches. It was even better! And if you have leftovers a great way to eat it is to put the salsa in a skillet on the stove, to heat it, and cook with curry. Taastes sooooo good!

I am rating the chips only.  They were easy to make and very good.  I make my own fruit salsa recipe, from red apple, grapes, strawberries, peach and preserves.

I used another reviewers advice and added peaches to the recipe. I made the cinnamon chips but also purchased a box of graham cracker sticks for my son to dip. Yum!

Wonderful! So refreshing on a warm summer day. I made this take to a party and ended up eating a lot of it myself. Oops. Definitely a keeper.

This is always a huge hit at parties!  I add a small amount of sugar to the strawberries while blending and pair this salsa with the cream cheese/ marshmallow fluff dip.  Perfect!

needed something to keep my nieces and nephew happy and they would all eat.  This was GREAT! Made the chips in small batches (I did burn the first one) and found that I needed to clean the pan about every other batch as the sugar became burnt syrup when left on the pan. So very tasty and a creative way to use up some of my Kiwis.

I accidentally bought the wrong size tortillas. I had the fajita size which looked like about 6." So, I used 5 instead of 3. I thought the cinnamon sugar looked like way to much. I did 1/2 cup sugar mixed with 1 Tablespoon of cinnamon, and still had some left using half. This recipe and others do not say what type of cooking spray to use. I believe I bought the wrong one. Mine was more like a butter than a spray and my chips were kind of soggy! I think it means a cooking spray like Pam. I do not like kiwi, so I left that out, but added some chopped strawberries, but think the peach idea would have been better. I also added a couple sprinkles of sugar, as the chips already have sugar.

Even the kids liked it.  Made the salsa with just strawberries and bananas with a little sugar for them.
