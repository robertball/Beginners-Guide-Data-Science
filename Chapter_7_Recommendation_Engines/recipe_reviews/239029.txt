This is a tough one to rate and I waver between 3-4 stars.  I opted to go with 4, because we liked it, for what it was.  It's not going to knock your socks off with flavor, or impress company, but it is a great budget friendly way to stretch a pound (or even half pound) of ground beef with pantry staples (if your pantry has Ramen) and an aging bell pepper.  If you've got some Ramen you're looking to use, this is definitely worth a try.  THANKS for the recipe!

I love how this recipe uses ingredients I already have. I looked for something with ground beef and ramen noodles. 

All I had was turkey pepperoni. Also I had chicken ramen so I used beef bullion instead of the ramen packets. 

I will definitely make this again, but I'll probably add some frozen peas just to add more vegetables (or canned corn.)

I don't love pepperoni, but I liked this. Next time, I might use taco seasoning instead of the pepperoni and Mexican cheese blend instead of the mozzarella. So many options!

This was a great recipe to get me started with a ramen/ground beef combo.

Made this on a camping trip and it was easy a delicious. I cooked the green peeper with the meat and would recommend dicing it instead of  leaving it as strips.

This is really easy to make on a weeknight.  My husband doesn't like cooked tomatoes in anything, but he really liked this. He said it was because they were diced so small  If you get the tiny pepperonis in a bag, that makes it even easier to  throw together.  Easy cleanup also, cooks in one pan.

Twice! It's terrific and just as good leftover!! 
Modify with whatever veggies you like. Whatever flavor of ramens. Or even make it ethnic. 
 Last time I added mushrooms and basil and left out the pepperoni.  
The first time it was just as stayed in the recipe minus green pepper. 
Kids loved it both times.

This recipe was very quick and easy! I cut each of the pepperoni slices in half. We had yellow, not green pepper on hand. I think onions would have added a good flavour. I tried adding 1 tsp Italian spice to it because I felt it didn't have a lot in the way of flavouring. All of us liked it, except my son, who objected to the Italian spice flavour. One reviewer suggested taco seasoning, which I may try next time, or maybe just black pepper.

I used what I had: 2 packs of ramen noodles, 1 can of diced tomatoes, and a can of shredded beef topped with a few herbs and spices; provided a quick lunch for my children who unexpectedly came home early.

I used the premise of the recipe and tailored it to what I had on hand. Of course this isn’t a “heart healthy” recipe, but I will attest it is a very quick and tasty recipe that I will occasionally!

Awesome!!!!! and Easy,  what could be better.
Only made slight changes.... used a beef/pork mixture from local store and picked up a small container of fresh chopped bell pepper mixture ( used about  4 T from it) I cannot use green bell peppers, but the colored peppers work fine.
Dissolved the  the ramen season mixture in the cup of water that I brought to a boil. Thought it would spread the mixture more evenly and it worked! Also used an Italian shredded cheese mixture, mozzarella is a little flat for me.
Hope not toooo many changes to count as a review.

I used ground turkey because I don't buy beef. I liked it a lot. I also used turkey pepperoni.
