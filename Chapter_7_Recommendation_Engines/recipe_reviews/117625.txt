These are the best pancakes I’ve ever had!  I halved the recipe.  I completely omitted the canola oil.  I chopped up the apples very very very small and mixed them with about a half of cup of cinnamon apple sauce and added that into the batter.  I also only used 2 egg whites and about a half of 1 yolk.  They cooked so light and fluffy and I can’t believe how healthy and good tasting they were!  I just topped mine with some warm apple sauce and sliced apples because I am not a fan of syrup.  Thanks for this recipe!

I used two shredded apples and cut back on the milk as I like my batter a bit thicker. Added in some vanilla and more cinnamon than suggested along with two tablespoons of lemon juice. Definitely one of the tastiest pancake recipes I've made. Thanks Kim!

I loved these. I, also, used two grated apples.  I substituted light soy milk for the fat free milk with no trouble.

It is a great recipe. My kids loved it. I added apple sauce instead of apple chunks, cut down the baking powder to half and used 1C whole wheat, 1C all purpose flour instead, 1C milk and 2/3 C yogurt. You can play with this recipe to match your taste.

I really disliked these. They were grainy and the apples turned into this soggy mess. Plus these apples did not mesh well with the pancakes. I will not be making these again.

we had mixed reviews on these pancakes around here, but i enjoyed them so they get 4 stars :)  i added raisins to some, and wouldn't recommend that, they were better as written without.  i think i will use 2 apples if i make them again, as the flavor was very subtle, but i really like the texture of these, which is sometimes an issue for me with homemade pancakes.  thanks!

Thanks for a great recipe! And thanks for the suggestions. I also used 1 c. white flour & 1 cup WW flour, increased the cinnamon to 1 1/2 t., used 1 T. honey & 1 T. br. sugar, added 1 t. vanilla, grated the apple & used half the baking powder called for! Not sure how much milk I used...I just added it until it was the right consistency.  :)

I loved how healthy this recipe looked.  But, it wasn't a hit with my family.  The pancakes didn't cook completely around the apple chunks.  And, I didn't think they were very sweet at all--even WITH syrup!  Sorry!

We really enjoyed this recipe. I used half white and half whole wheat flour. I also left the peel on the apple for the nuturients and diced it.

My family loved these pancakes.  I used my ulu knife to cut the apple into small bits.  I used the cinnamon honey butter recipe on this site to top them off.  The combination was delicious.

Well they are eating them. I always have trouble with wheat flour,so I made it white, and I swiched the honey for Brn Sugar. I also used and apple and a half.. i kept the 1/2 for garnished. I should have cut down on the milk byabout 1/4 cup.. otherwise the reciepe is sound, I just had more apples to cook.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I substituted the oil with 1/2 cup applesauce, and I think next time I'll use more apples.   To avoid them becoming wrinkly (others complained of this), cook the pancake completely on one side before you flip it.  It took a little practice to make them look pretty, but these were great! Definitely making them again.

I cut back on the baking powder by two tsp. and used apple pie spice. My kids don't like all wheat pancakes, so I did half and half. I ended up adding a package of apple cinnamon instant oatmeal
just to thicken up the batter, as it was a little loose. (It looks like I changed a bunch to this recipe, but I really didn't.) We all liked this. Not as much as other recipes on this site, but it got eaten. I served it with my homemade syrup.

I didn't have any whole wheat flour, so I made them with unbleached.  They were very good.  Next time I'll use brown sugar instead of honey, and add more cinnamon and maybe some vanilla.  Very good way to use up some extra apples!

My husband really liked these, but as someone else already stated, mine did not cook around the apples, which bothered me but not him.  I think I will try them without the fresh apples and use cinnamon applesauce instead. That might make them fluffier as well, mine came out rather flat. Sorry

This recipe was excellent! I actually left the apple out of the pancakes and instead topped them with the Apple Cinnamon Syrup from this site. They were fluffy and light, and very tasty!

I made this or my 2 preschoolers.  They loved the pancakes and I love that they are a bit on the healthier side than your average pancake.  They freeze and reheat very well also.

Something was off about them.  Maybe a different type of apple is needed.  I used a crisp, tart variety.

These are delicious, filling and so healthy that I felt great serving them to my husband and kids! I agree with fellow reviewers that they are not a sweet pancake. I served them with warm maple syrup, but I may use warm apple butter next time. I also plan to add a little vanilla extract to the batter next time to give them just a little extra layer of flavor. YUM!

These were just what I was looking for--healthy and easy! One problem I had was with the honey becoming a big mass when added to the cold milk, so I just nuked the wet ingredients for 30 seconds so I could easily stir it before adding it to the dry ingredients. I used 2 smallish apples, one tart and one sweet (Johnathon and Gala), but the tart one was actually better because it didn't lose its flavor like the sweet one, yet didn't taste tart either. I chopped them pretty small with a food chopper. The batter is thin, but it still cooks up nice and tender.  If it were too thick it wouldn't get cooked inside. Just don't pour too much on because it will spread! I did add 1/2 tsp. extra cinnamon because of the extra apple, and it wouldn't have hurt to have even a smidge more. Also added 3/4 tsp. vanilla and that helped too. I also used whole wheat pastry flour which helps it not be so dense. If you're buying whole wheat flour at the store (as opposed to grinding your own) the pastry flour isn't that much more and you will love the lightness it adds to your whole wheat baked goods. Thanks, I love fabulous fall food!

Excellent base recipe for apple cinnamon pancakes! Adjusted slightly to fit our taste...substitued 1/2 c wheat germ for whole wheat, used 3 t of baking powder, added 1 t vanilla, cut back milk to 1 1/2 cups, and substituted brown sugar for honey because honey is so expensive!  I also threw in some raisins for additional sweetness and walnuts for additional protein and heartiness. My whole family (hubby, 1 yo, and 4yo) loved them!

I followed this recipe to the letter and they turned out very rubbery!  The next time I make these, I will separate the egg yolks from the whites, and beat the whites with a mixer, then add to the mix.  This is from another recipe I have for waffles and they always turn out fluffy.   As mentioned before, I would add a teaspoon of vanilla to the mix.  Other than the rubbery texture, they had a great flavor.

Really tasty, healthy, fluffy pancakes. I made these with 1 cup whole wheat and 1 cup white flour and they came out wonderful.  The only problem I had with these pancakes is that they get too dark too quickly.  I made them the same way I've always made pancakes so I'm not sure why they did that, other than maybe its due to the whole wheat flour?  I made them a second time, and had the same issue.  They still tasted great, just more darker colored and not golden brown.

I was not impressed with these pancakes, but my kids loved them. These are rather bland and soggy. I shredded the apples and added a couple T brown sugar. I had to cook them over low heat to cook the insides without burning the outsides.  I might make these again if the kids request it, but would only make a half batch.

Very good and easy to make. Cinnamon gives it a great flavor. I chopped the apple into smaller size pieces, and it cooked through to be nice and tender.

i ended up having to tweek this recipe way too much, batter was very runny had to add more flour to thicken and not very flavorful. added a lot more cinnamon and as suggested by other reviewers added vanilla and 2 grated apples. also added brown sugar instead of honey at first, but batter was still bland, so added honey as well and regular sugar also. kept adding until batter was right consistency and sweet enough. wanted them to be just sweet enough to eat plain. after all the experimenting pancakes turned out good but not good enough to make again.

i made this for my kids, husband, and sister when she was visiting.  everyone really liked it.  my sister said that it tasted like apple pie.  i did change the recipe a little bit.  i used bisquick as the base. i just followed the directions for pancakes on the back of the box.  i also used cinnamon sugar and only 1 TBS of honey.  i used a gala apple instead of a tart one.  i will probably make this again because it was easy and very tasty.

Loved the flavor of these! I only gave it 4 stars because I personally like my pancakes a bit fluffier. I cut the recipe in half, used unbleached flower and whole milk,(all I had on hand) combined about a tablespoon of applesauce with the diced apples, teaspoon of vanilla and tablespoon of brown sugar...delicious! no syrup needed, as I am also not a fan.

I have to say, this was delicious. I did double the cinnamon - unintentionally - but it was truly the best we've had.

Word of caution, the pancakes are very thick. I put them on the skillet, and spread them a bit with a rubber spatula. I also heated up the pan and then used it as it cooled. But it was amazing.
Thanks Kim McConnell

These were healthy but very bland. I used Granny smith apples, some apple pie spice,  and used a cup of apple butter. My sweet tolerance is very high.  :)

Used a cup of cinnamon applesauce in place of the apple, honey, and oil; soymilk in place of milk; and added vanilla extract.  The pancakes were a bit dry and I think there was a little too much baking powder.  But it was the perfect amount of sweetness.

I don't really understand what went wrong with this recipe, but it sure did. Me and my sister followed the recipe exactly, and it flopped. Our pancakes couldn't hold up to the spatula, and turned into these grainy, wrinkly messes. I wouldn't recommend this recipe.

These were excellent pancakes.   I used 1 cup whole wheat and 1 cup all purpose, brown sugar instead of honey.  I also used 2 apples and shredded them instead of chopping.  I will definitely make these again.

Good pancakes. Excellent texture and very tasty.  I wanted to use some canned apples and looked for a pancake recipe. I also used 1 cup whole wheat and 1 cup all-purpose flour. I think I might add a bit more cinnamon next time.

This was a nice alternative to the conventional buttery pancakes.  It tastes a little different than I'm used to, but it is, like so many other reviewers have said, light and fluffy.  I doubled the amount of apples and omitted the honey, and things still tasted pretty darn good.  Next time, in fact, I might add even more apples.  The final result wasn't particularly sweet, but I still ate all the pancakes plain.

Worth a try if you crave pancakes but don't want something that is packed with fat and/or cholesterol.

Happy Eating!

A good recipe.  I wish the pancakes alone had been a bit sweeter so I wouldn't have to put anything on them.  Next time I would add maybe a quarter cup of real maple syrup to the recipe.

Unfortunately, I do not have any apples @ home and so, I substituted it with a pear. It turned out well. I love the fruit and whole wheat combination... It just taste great...

The batter was too thick and we could taste the baking powder. We did not even save the leftovers but this recipe could probably be salvaged with some changes.

This recipe was a family hit!!!  I varied it a bit because of what we had on hand and to our tastes:  1C unsweetened applesauce, 1-3/4C Vanilla soy milk, no honey and 2t of cinnamon, everything else was the same.  Couldn't believe how yummy and fluffy a whole wheat recipe could be.

This tasted pretty good but was so thick I had to add more milk to thin it out some.  also they were very filling!  But tasted just like apple cinnamon muffins.  Just needed a bit of sugar so I ate mine with sugar sprinkled on!  Just perfect!
