This recipe was great.  I did add a lot of meat to this to suit my family's taste, but stuck with the rest of the recipe closely.  Very good and a new family favorite.

I am a pretty above average cook and I thought that this was horrible.  My entire family turned their noses up at it and the horrible smell still lingers in my house.  I'm SO disappointed!

I made half the recipe, and the servings are HUGE. There is good flavor here, but DH and I both thought the vinegar (which I carefully measured) was overpowering. It was the one flavor that came through in every bite and seemed to really soak into the pasta.  I wish I had gone with my gut and replaced the vinegar with white wine.

For us - substitute dry red wine for white vinegar.....prefer it this way.
