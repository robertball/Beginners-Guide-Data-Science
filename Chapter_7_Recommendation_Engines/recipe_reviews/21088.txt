I could eat this all day, but definitely use fresh, steamed green beans and red wine vinegar.

My husband really liked these, but I made them into a "cold" dish.  I used fresh green beans, "garlic red wine vinegar" and also added minced garlic.  I also used already cooked bacon to eliminate some fat and then steamed everything together in my microwave, let it cool & served.  Nice easy side, thanks Casey.

Overall the taste on this recipe was great.  I made one change and would recommend making one other.  Instead of canned beans I used raw fresh beans out of the garden.  Very good and crispy.  I would recommend not to saute the onions in bacon grease.  My husband of course, being a man, loved it, but I thought it was just a bit too heavy and greasy.  I'll definately make it again though, minus the bacon grease!!

Tasty & healthy- if you make it my way! Saute' onions in a little olive oil. ( I only used half the amount.) Add vinegar, then green beans. Next add 6 T. bacon bits. Heat through- not greasy at all this way. It's tart with the vinegar- we liked it!

I made mine with fresh green beans, red wine vinegar, bacon with just a little grease (just enough to barely cover the bottom of the skillet), onion and fresh minced garlic.  I needed to add a little water about half way thru to finish cooking the beans, but OH BABY was it good when it was done!  I only gave it 4 stars because it was amazing with changes... as written, it's 4 stars, how I made it it's 5 stars!

The best green bean recipe ever! I use Louis Rich Turkey Bacon cooked in the microwave and saute my onions in olive oil to cut down on the fat content. Even my 1 year old granddaughter loves them!

I made this with home grown green beans, right off the plant.  They were fantastic!  All around winner.  I've made them a few times.  Only thing I don't like is every time they've come out a little greasy.  But not enough to deter people to try it.

I was looking for something a little different and this recipe fit the bill. Excellent way to use up some green and yellow beans from my garden. I steamed them first then proceeded with the rest of the recipe. I added a little minced garic with the onions and also used red wine vinegar. Sprinkled sliced almonds on top before serving. Husband and I both loved this dish and will make again soon. Thanks!

These were pretty good. Next time I will cut down on the vinegar, I thought it was too much.

Wonderful!!!  Used frozen green beans, real bacon bits and cider vinegar.  Sauted onion (about 1/2 cup) in 1 T heart-healthy margarine.  Added cooked green beans, vinegar and bacon bits ans sauted about 10 minutes.  Fabulous!!!

not favored at our house, better described as "sour" green beans than snappy ... may have been better with 6 slices of bacon - I only used 2 (w/ my usual method, more than enough bacon flavor).

Will not be making again. I used red wine vinegar and that was a mistake, causes the onions to turn pink. Flavor is not good either.

I was not too smitten with this.  My husband actually disliked it because of the onion (even though I only used half).  I cooked the bacon in the microwave, like one of the reviews suggested, but I think now that that was a mistake and the dish needs the flavor from the bacon grease.  I also used red wine vinegar and I added some minced garlic as suggested, and I think that is definitely the way to go.

This is a simple recipe for excellant beans. I used beans from my garden and cut up the bacon into small pieces before frying it. It was a hit with my company that I had for dinner. Will definately make again! Thanks for sharing.

My mom made these regularly when we were growing up and they were one of the few ways I would eat veggies as a kid. I still love them today.  My  suggestions for tweaks would be to use tarragon vinegar instead of distilled white and frozen french cut green beans instead of canned.  Then it would be perfect like hers :)  I'm planning to make a healthier version of this tonight using turkey bacon & EVOO to saute the onions, and my suggestions for tarragon vinegar and frozen french cut beans. Overall though, this is one of my favorite veggie side dishes.

We LOVED these!  My husband does not eat vegetables, but he ate half a plate of just these!  Other reviews complain about it turning out too greasy.  The recipe is unclear whether you use all of the bacon grease or just some to cook the green beans in.  I ended up using just enough to coat the bottom of the pan.  If you don't like vinegar, I would suggest cutting the vinegar a little bit, but we loved it as is!

Green beans were good but there was too much bacon grease for my taste. Cut it down to two slices. Added two cans instead of one. Vinegar did add a new twist though. Threw in some toasted sesame seeds for added flavor.

too vinegary for me.  I only used 1/2 the bacon and used turkey bacon.  All I tasted was the vinegar.  Perhaps more beans would have helped

I made this as part of a "steakhouse at home" dinner. It went over really well, tasted great! Served with a nice steak and the honey-topped sweet potato on this site, it was just like something I'd get at a restaurant.

Thanks for a great recipe!  It's so simple and good.  I also used just a little of the bacon grease and red wine vinegar.  Small changes to a wonderful dish.

These are pretty good.  I cooked the bacon in my George Forman grill and just added a small amount of the grease to saute the onion.  I think I will add a little extra vinegar next time.  It could have used a little more KICK!!  Overall ~ very good!

My husband liked this better than me -- that's why the 4* rating. I think it would be closer to a 3. I used maple flavored thick bacon. The flavor was OK just not outstanding. My daughter prefers green beans almondine to this. I couldn't believe how much grease was in the pan. Probably won't be making again.

Our family loved this recipe--used one lb. package of Trader Joe's frozen haricot verts, steamed. Cut up six slices of pre-cooked bacon and sauteed with one chopped onion in a little olive oil then added red wine vinegar, kosher salt, freshly ground pepper and the beans.  Very little effort for a new and delicious taste.

2.27.17   It doesn't take a whole lot to turn ordinary beans into extraordinary beans by adding bacon, onion & vinegar, and I've been making green beans like this for many, many years.  I agree with others that you need another type of vinegar with more "snap" (hey, it's in the recipe's name).  Would recommend you use cider vinegar or red wine vinegar as opposed to milder white.  I did steam my fresh beans in the microwave for about 1 minute 45 seconds to reach that crisp texture that we like rather than using canned beans.  Enjoyed, as always!

Used 3 slices thick cut.  Agree fresh green beans would taste better.  Option: add a small amount of sugar; would make this an old German dish my gran always made for us.

Way too vinegary! I served this to 5 adults for Thanksgivng, none of them liked it. Everyone complained about the vinegar. It overpowered the whole dish. I ended up throwing this out. Would not make it again.

This was pretty tasty and very easy to make.
I do like bacon and am not averse to fat, but I do think that this dish wound up a bit too greasy.

I used fresh green beans which took longer to cook.  The onions were limp and lost their punch.  They were alright, but nothing special.  Thanks.

Excellent!  The only thing I did differently was to add some slivered almonds to the mix.  I also used fresh beans out of our garden.  I'm making it again tonight and skipping the bacon.  Although it was good I don't think the beans needed them.  I'm going to saute the onions in a little margarine and use seasoned salt for flavoring.  I'll still add in the almonds because the extra crunch is great.  Such a nice alternative to boring boiled beans.

My husband grew up eating a recipe called "Sour Beans," but no one seems to know how to make it anymore.  I have searched and searched for a way to replicate it and I found it here! I usually use fresh or frozen green beans and have great luck.  I made it for Easter and now MY family wants the recipe.  It is definitely a keeper!

I thought this was just average.  Not great.  Maybe I did it wrong. It wasn't bad but maybe I should have used fresh green beans (although it asks for canned) and I used the white vinegar but someone suggested red wine vinegar instead.  It was also a tad greasy.

Yum!  I agree with other reviewers - halve the bacon and it's good, otherwise too greasy.  I also used red wine vinegar - nice taste.
