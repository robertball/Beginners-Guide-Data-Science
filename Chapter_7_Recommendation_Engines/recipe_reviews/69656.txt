I didn't have self-rising flour, so I substituted with 1 cup of all-purpose flour and 1.5 teaspoons of baking powder. I didn't change anything else, and this dessert turned out very well. It is not too sweet or too decadent, but it satisfies a chocolate craving. I let it cool until it was just warm and the sauce was thickening, and then served it in bowls with scoops of vanilla ice cream. I will definitely make this again.

This tasted delicious and was quick to prepare. My husband said "Oh boy, is this good!" The sauce thickens as it cools.  If you don't have self-rising flour, use 1 cup flour with 1 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt.

I've never heard of chocolate cobbler but I was in a last minute pinch for a dessert that was quick, easy and cheap. I skeptically threw this together with the following changes: made self rise flour with 1c. ap. flour, 1 1/2 tsp bkg pwdr, 1 tsp. salt.  Used only 4 TBSP butter and about 1 1/4 C boiling water.  Used heaping measurements for the Cocoa Powder.  I also baked it in my 9x9 stoneware piece.  This dessert completely exceeded my expectations. The cake-like part set up perfectly and the "sauce" was exactly like hot fudge - built right in there!  I couldn't have been happier with the results and am thrilled to add this to my collection of sweet, simple - TOTALLY satisfying recipes. Anyone who's tried it with a result that didn't knock their socks off should try it again with some changes!

I came online looking for a version of the chocolate cobbler called "Chocolate Stuff" served at Barbara Jean's restaurant on St. Simon's Island.  Another review listed here said this was a very good version and I have to agree! It was a huge hit with everyone I served it to, both kids and adults.  I served it with vanilla ice cream this time, I might try just fresh whipped cream next time around.  I'm sure I'll make it again soon.  I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9x13 pan with no problems.

The measurements on this recipe are definitely off.  Make sure you read the reviews before proceeding.  I made as directed and while my kids enjoyed the flavor, the end result was a little on the greasy side and very runny.  Next time I will cut the butter down to 4 Tbsp and increase the flour, sugar, cocoa powder,milk mixture (maybe even double it?).  I think if you tweaked the measurements you could end up with something similar to a molten chocolate cake.  It has potential but as written it's not right.

I am known to change every recipe.  This one I made it exactly how it was written.  I thought it was FANTASTIC!  Some people commented that is was too sweet....what??!!  It's chocolate cobbler people.  What do you expect?  I thought it was perfect and I am not a huge chcolate fan.

This is one of the best chocolate desserts I have ever made.  I really didn't let it cool enough before I tasted it, but I just couldn't wait!  This recipe deserves a lot more than 5 stars because the taste is wonderful and it is so, so easy.  This cobbler is rich and the right amount of rich.  The sauce is a perfect smooth chocolate and is complemented by the cakey topping, which by itself is a treat.  Chocolate cobbler is perfect for a chocolate fix.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe I will make again and again!  (Since I didn't have self-rising flour, I used 1 cup flour and added 1 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp salt).

I made this tonight for dessert.  It looked like a big mess when I put it in the oven.  It came out perfect. I used all purpuse flour, 1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.  That was the only modification to the recipe.  It turned out wonderful.  I topped it off with sliced strawberries instead of Ice Cream.

This cobbler was really good, a big hit at our house!   After reading the reviews about it being too sweet, I reduced the sugar amounts to 2/3 cup each (50/50 sugar and Splenda).   The result was a lovely chocolatey pudding cake;  I would have needed the extra sugar to get the "crunchy" cobbler effect.   Regardless, we tucked into it and finished it off in two nights.   For next time, I think I'll increase the topping sugar (to 3/4 cup) and add some instant coffee granules to the cake mixture to enhance the chocolate flavor.   My partner said he thought it would be nice with dried currants or dried cherries, so I'll work that variation in, too.   Thanks for the recipe!

Very good recipe.  I have been making something similar for years.  May I suggest that if you want the sauce to taste even fudgier that you use brown sugar instead of the white.

If a brownie and a cake and hot fudge sauce met and had a crazy night, this would be their love child.  Thank you! p.s. make sure to let it cool so the sauce thickens, or if you're extremely impatient like me, just put a couple ice packs wrapped in towels under it!

AHA! I believe I have figured out the mixed reviews on this recipe! I am an experienced baker and have a reputation of "Whatever she brings, you'll love it!" So, surprise! Surprise! I made this recipe and it was a FLOP! I knew there has to be a reason. So here's my opinion of why... you HAVE TO TO USE AN OBLONG CASSEROLE DISH, do not use a tall, round casserole dish (like I used, which resulted in a runny mess). I would like to know if the other reviews that were less than favorable were the result of using a tall, round casserole dish instead of an oblong one.  ??  If using an oblong dish, you create more "air" exposure which would probably thicken the surface areas and liquid below.  I'll try the recipe again using an oblong dish and let you know!

Whether you are craving chocolate or want a quick & easy last-minute dessert, this is a must-try recipe.  I followed the recipe's ingredients, although I substituted 1 cup all-purpose with 1.5 tsp. baking powder & 1/2 tsp salt for the self-rising flour. I used Giradelli chocolate & a 9 x 9 stoneware baking dish. I poured the boiling water carefully over the batter in a steady stream.  I baked mine slightly longer than the recipe indicated (5 min). The top was crusty & underneath the cake was a lake of chocolate sauce that thickened upon cooling. I served this warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, real whipped cream and Giradelli chocolate shavings. It was VERY rich, VERY sweet, with a rich chocolate flavor. The next time I make this I will add 1 tsp of instant espresso powder to enhance the flavor even more.  A word of caution: I noticed many reviewers substituted for the self-rising flour.  Be sure your baking powder is FRESH for best results.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Chocolate cobblers that I've had in the past have been like barely cooked brownie batter (and totally delicious).  This recipe is good.  Bake it in a low flat dish (not a deep one), otherwise it will never cook in the middle.  Bake this like you would brownies.  The cobbler will "firm" as it cools and will not be runny when warm. Don't reduce the butter, chocolate or sugar.  The sugar is responsible for texture in this dish.  No substitutes.

Just a little bit sweet for me- i would have liked this recipe much better had the chocolate been more intensely chocolate and less sweet- i might remake the recipe and put in a bit less sugar and maybe up the chocolate- or maybe use a darker chocolate. I used Hersheys. Overall, good- but not great!

For a last-minute dessert, this recipe is wonderful!  It is so easy to make but tastes like it took some effort.  And it is great for folks who can't have eggs.  If you don't have self-rising flour, just google for a substitute of flour+baking powder+salt.  

I was concerned about how runny and not set the dessert looked when I pulled it out of the oven, but it thickened nicely after standing for about 10 minutes.  I served it with vanilla ice cream and a Kahlua drizzle.

Definitely will make again.

oh yum.  I didn't change a thing, and wouldn't change a thing.  mmmmmmm.
When I spooned out the first serving, a lovely chocolate lava came slowly gooshing out from underneath. oh my god thank you.  

(I ordered chocoate souffle at a restaurant once and this was almost identical to that dessert.)

This has a great chocolate flavor and is very simple to make. I whipped it up really quickly one night just before my parents arrived to stay with us for a couple of days.

What I actually made deserved far less than 4 stars, but it's my fault.  I feel so stupid for not paying attention to the "self rising" part of the flour (doh!).  For anyone who doesn't realize how important this is, you will have a greasy runny chocolate mess instead of a chocolate cobbler!  That said, the taste was good and I'd like to make it again sometime, correctly.

I would like to rate this recipe less than a 1 if possible. I can't understand why so many people are saying that it came out great for them. I made it according to the directions and it came out awful. It looked like gobs of chocolate balls floating in a chocolate sea. I thought it was supposed to be a cobbler and the consistency was anything but that. The gobs were overly sweet. Maybe if it didn't call for so much water, it would have turned out better. 1 1/2 cups boiling water with nothing to cling to is just that....water! I won't make this dish again. I will use a crust recipe from an apple or peach cobber and and make my own chocolate filling.

I loved this recipe.  It was easy and really delicious.  I took it to a party and had many people ask for the recipe!  The only thing I changed was to only use enough boiling water to cover the top of the dish.

I didn't care for this.  The sauce comes out pretty thin, and the butter and water in the sauce don't mix so there is this greasy watery thin chocolate stuff floating in the bowl.  The "cake" part was just mediocre - a doughy, thin tasting mixture that did not taste rich or flavorful.  Don't waste your time making this - there are much better recipes out there.

I wasn't quite sure what to expect of a "chocolate cobbler".  I followed the recipe exactly, except for the self-rising flour, of which I didn't have, and I used only 1 cup of boiling water.  MIne had a pudding type consistency on the bottom and a fudgy cake type topping.
It was YUMMY!  My 8-year old and I had some, hot out of the oven with vanilla ice cream. My husband had some around 3 in the morning, and loved it.  It has set more, today, but when I microwave it to warm it up, it gets nice and gooey again.  This is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

This is the first recipe that I've felt compelled to review. I made it for a bible study dinner last night and everyone loved it, even my husband who doesn't really care for chocolate. One friend even said it was the best part of his day :) After reading the reviews about the runniness of the sauce I decided to double the recipe and use 2 1/2 cups of boiling water. I let it cool for about 45 minutes and it was perfect...rich brownie-like crust on top of a thick fudgy chocolate sauce. Perfect for vanilla ice cream. I'll definitely make this one again!!

Loved it. Fixed the "too liquidy" problem by making a batch and a half in a 9x12 pan, but only used the original amount called for of water and butter. Cooked it 10 minutes longer. It was cakey on top, fudgey on the bottom, crusty around the edges (my favorite part) and EVERYONE went back for seconds AND thirds! Great with Vanilla ice cream!

Yum! I followed the recipe and although it does look quite weird while you're making it, it turns out delicious!  The water becomes a chocolate sauce on the bottom. I would compare this to hot fudge cake complete with delicious vanilla ice cream! Hubby and I both loved it. MMMM!

Good and easy to make! I wasn't sure how this would turn out but glad I gave it a try. The only thing I will do differently next time is to cut down on the butter.

Really really good and really really easy!!  Great craving dessert since you have everything on hand already.  A little rich, but I'm not complaining!!  We'll be making this again!  

Edit:  By the way, for those who are complaining that this isn't a molten chocolate cake perhaps that's because it ISN"T a molten chocolate cake.  It's supposed to be gooey and mushy.  It's a cobbler.  The top crisps and the rest stays pretty soft.  Look up Molten Chocolate Cake if thats actually what you want.

This was a fast delicious dessert. My hubby can't get enough of this very rich chocolatey concoction. I have made this twice and every one loves it. I used margarine the first time and while it came out good, it tasted much better the second time using butter. Thanks for a great easy recipe!

Lava pie is what they should call this. It is very similar to those lava cakes you get at nicer restaurants. I baked this in a 9" pie plate and baked it for 40 minutes. It looks like an absolute watery mess, but it is delicious. It looked too watery still at the 30 minute mark.

Total disaster. This was inedible. The bottom layer was a gummy mess, and the whole thing wasn't sweet at all, despite the vast amounts of sugar. Hugely disappointing.

The recipe was quick and easy I think thats about the best thing I can say. Since there were a lot of reviews and did not feel like reading them all I just went with the orginal. The cobbler part is delicious but the bottom turned more like pudding I guess thats what it supposed to do? But woah was this VERY sweet. I was thinking more cobbler like but it was almost hard to eat. I mean I could feel myself getting fat as I ate it. I will DEFINATLEY not try this again maybe people that LOVE the taste of sugary chocolate will like it but I certainly do not.

I really liked the sound of this recipe and really wanted to like it.  But unfortunately it turned out a chocolate mess for me.  Too think on bottom and very runny on top.

I cooked this twice tonight w/o changing anything from the recipe in my attempt to get this "right." I've come to the conclusion that it's the recipe. There was way too much butter to begin with. And since water and butter don't mix, the "syrup" was a gross mixture of oil and water. The cobbler part was strange as well. It was a gooey, gummy mess that I threw out. It was a waste of ingredients and a disappointment. Try the hot fudge cake III w/coffee if you want a good recipe.

Man, this is a good recipe! I found it by doing an ingredient search because we were craving chocolate and didn't have much on hand. I followed the recipe to the letter and it came out great. I did have to use a spoon to spread the batter out in the pan since it was very thick, but the butter in the pan helped. Good enough for company. We served ours piled in berry bowls. Would be great with whipped cream or ice cream.

I made this for my grown children and my dad, this is the best chocolate cobbler I have ever had. My sons gf asks me to make it all the time. I seen a review that stated the measurments were off, I am sorry but they are spot on!  Maybe she misread the directions or doubled the recipe but the directions are not to scale so you need to keep that in mind when doubling this recipe. I always have to double this one. The onlything I did differently was to add some salt about a 1/4 teaspoon.

This has recently been my favorite site for new recipes and usually I love them and don't bother reviewing, since there are usually so many reviews already, but I felt this one needed one.  I was searching for something quick and easy to satisfy my chocolate craving.  This did match the "quick and easy" description, but it was not all that great.  It's kind of like a lava cake, and I loved the lava part, but the cake part was kind of bland.  I thought it tasted kind of watery and spongey instead of rich and cakey.

This cobbler is insane! This is the answer to any chocolate craving you may have. This is great right out of the oven. I made this for a pot luck for work and I wanted to try it before I took it in. after trying it, I wanted to keep it at home and not take it in to share. I was that good, everybody loved it. Even my kids couldn't help licking the sauce out of the pan.

Holy cow, this was a good recipe! I felt really guilty about the amt of butter and sugar used in this, but THEN I TASTED IT!  ;-)  I used boiling hazelnut and french roast coffee instead of boiling water. I also doubled it and used at 9x13 in dish. This is a keeper, folks!

This is very much like a chocolate lava cake and we enjoyed it very much.  However, if you make it as directed be prepared for a VERY sweet dessert.  After reading the reviews I cut the sugar back by 1/4 cup, used part Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa Powder and substituted brewed coffee for the water.  The end result was still a bit too sweet.  I'll probably cut the sugar back another 1/4 cup the next time and there will be a next time.  Dylansmom is right - it's great with ice cream!

So, so good! Very similar to a molten lava cake. Would be great for company. I only gave it 4 stars because I think some of the butter and sugar could be cut out. Regardless, I made it exactly as the instructions said and it was delicious.

YUM! It looks weird before you bake it, but it comes out perfect... light spongy cake with hot chocolate sauce underneath. I add a teaspoon of instant coffee granules to the hot water when I pour it on top... like many people, we ate it with vanilla ice cream!

So simple, but delicious!!  Only change, but it was a biggie for us, I subbed boiling leftover coffee for the water.  My sauce was fairly liquid, but that was okay as we spooned more over the scoop of vanilla ice cream we put on top.  Next time I am going to try doubling this, as it was barely enough for four of us.  I baked mine in a round 3 qt. casserole which seemed to be just right.  We will have this a lot!!  Thank you dylansmom!!!

I had big doubts about this recipe... "Pour boiling water over the top"... what?  But OK, I followed the directions exactly.  The initial "batter" is VERY thick and I had to spread it around the baking dish.  The magic is in the boiling water.  When you pull the cobbler from the oven and scoop out a serving of chocolate cake, you discover the lake of smooth chocolate sauce beneath the cake.  Truely magic.

Followed the recipe exactly except for using ap flour plus 1 t baking powder and 1/2 t salt and dark cocoa powder instead of regular.  I used a 1 qt Pyrex casserole dish and the mixture filled it to the top and spilled into the oven.  My fault.  After letting it sit one hour out of the oven I tried it.  It is way sweet and the bottom is still very liquidy.  I'd have to make some changes to make this again.

Love this! It's quick, simple & tasty. One note... if you decide to double it, a 13x9 is a bit small. Ask me how I know. haha

This is an excellent recipe for chocolate cobbler. Easy, quick, and best of all yummy! Planning to make it for company this coming Sunday, and to serve with a basic vanilla ice cream.

OMG. This one is dangerous! Very easy and way too good! I used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa for extra chocolate yumminess, and we enjoyed it slightly warm with vanilla ice cream. For dinner. :)

I love this recipe. I replaced regular sugar with Xylitol with no problems. I also used 1/2 AP  flour 1/2 whole wheat white flour and 1 1/2 tsp of baking powder. The rest of the recipe I followed as written. We left in the oven 5 extra minutes. So easy & well worth the little effort it takes to make it. How nice it it was in silicone cupcake liners.

really good! Great rich chocolate flavor :) First time having chocolate cobbler and it was sooo good that I didn't want to share haha. It is rich so you gotta like natural chocolate flavor (which I do!)

TO-DIE-FOR GOOD! Wow. I doubled all ingredients (except the butter - used 6 TBS), and baked in a 9 x 13" pan. Baked for 35 minutes. Turned out perfectly. YUM. Will make again!!!

Yummy and easy! I used AP flour with 1 tsp baking powder and a pinch of salt and used less sugar (reduced it by 1/4 cup in the batter and 1/4 cup in the topping too).

My new favorite chocolate fix! This stuff is so delicious! It's fast, easy, and I've used way less than 6 tbsp of butter and it still tastes incredible. I usually use 1/4 cup of cocoa in the batter, just because I want it really chocolatey. I use a little less sugar too. It's so good I crave it and I know nothing will substitute. It's got that cake-like topping with hot fudge underneath... makes my mouth water just thinking about it!

I followed the recipe exact and it came out wonderful!  When you pour the water over the mixture - don't be scared if it looks like a watery mess.  I was very leery of it, but somehow it works....and it turns out to be a cakey top with a pudding layer underneath that is delicious!

I've read several reviews that state this comes out as a runny mess.  I really do not understand that.  My mother used to make this (or something similar) and I was so excited to find this recipe for it.
I've made it several times and it comes out fine every time.  I do not keep self-rising flour, so I add 1 c. all-purpose flour, 1-1/2 t. baking powder and 1/2 t. salt to the batter.  That is the only change I make.
The cobbler comes out with a chocolate cake-like top layer and a chocolate pudding bottom layer.
Be careful though.  This really needs to cool down to just above room temperature in order for the pudding layer to 'set up'.  I cool it completely, then reheat slightly in the microwave.

I made this for my hubbie for Valentine's Day, and it came out great.  A bit too rich for my taste, but my hubbie loved it and so did our guests the next night.  As others suggested, I subbed 1 cup flour with 1 tsp. baking powder and 1/2 tsp. salt for self-rising flour and used only 1 1/4 cups water.  Baked in a 9x9-inch pan; came out great!

This is the perfect easy chocolate fix. Seriously - this is so easy, you don't even have to stir it! I didn't have any self-rising flour, so I used regular flour, 1.5 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt. Simply divine. Tastes like a runny chocolate pie with a crunchy brownie crust. Slurp it up, lick it up - just enjoy it! Really sinful with vanilla ice cream.

This recipe was a disappointment - it smelled and tasted good, but the chocolate cobbler part was gooey and tough - I made it as an additional recipe for our Thanksgiving dinner and everyone ate it, but then made the comment that it really wasn't that good.  I wouldn't recommend it and I did make it as directed as I usually do for first time recipes before I make any changes.

Sweet, and gooey, with just enough crispy parts on top.  This fulfills the key requirements for a chocolate dessert!  I did think the cake part was a bit dense, and lacked the rich chocolate flavor of the gooey sauce.  I used all-purpose flour, and added baking powder and salt.  Next time I will use yogurt in the batter instead of milk, to help it rise even better, and possibly some melted chocolate, or chocolate chips to make it really decadent!

This was ok - it wasn't as rich as I thought it would be.  The flavors were all just kind of mediocre, there wasn't much depth or complexity.  It served it's purpose of fixing my sweet tooth, but I probably wouldn't make it again.

I double this recipe.... but did not change a thing as far as fixing-wise. It is YUMMMMMMY! Goes very well served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, drizzle some of the filling over the ice cream. Reminds me alot like the chocolate cobbler that is served at Cracker Barrel. It reheats nicely in a low oven or in the microwave too. My family loves when this is fixed.

My only change to this recipe was that I made it with "special dark" Hershey cocoa, and it was fantastic. Next time, though, I will reduce the butter and bake it in a 9x9 rather than 8x8 pan because it cooked over in the oven.

This ROCKS!  I made exactly as written and it turned out great.  Fantastic chocolate "cobbler" with rich chocolate sauce to dip over it.  I served with cool-whip and all we could do was say.."MMM" with every bite.

Great- EASY recipe. You have to try this. I was impressed with how good it turned out. It reminds me of 'volcano' cake It makes a nice cake on top- and a hot fusge sauce on bottom. I am changing the name in my cookbook to Hot fudge cake! Mske sure you have ice cream for all that hot fudge when you bake it up. I did use less butter than it calls for- I think as long the butter covers the bottom of the pan, you're ok! ENJOY!!

This is wonderful!!! I made it tonight and it was super easy, I had all of the ingredients on hand in the pantry. I did not alter this recipe at all. This would be a great last minute dessert to serve anytime. Definitely serve with the vanilla ice cream, I used Breyers. I will make this again & again & again! Thanks!

Good! Easy too.  My six year old daughter helped make it, I was a little worried that the instructions did not say to mix it all together after pouring the boiling water on top, so I didn't and it turned out great.  Served warm with vanilla ice cream YUM!

I've had this recipe for awhile; and finally used it.  It is wonderful!  Everyone loved it - and asked for the recipe.  Even have been asked by a co-worker to make it again.  If you like a little less sauce I would recommend using a cup of water (maybe).  I followed the directions and thought there was a little too much sauce for me.

OH MY GOSH!!!!!!! This was one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth, and I am a pretty strict judge! Made it for a birthday at work and there was not one single bite left after 5 people. I will definitely have to double next time. Followed others' suggestion and only used 1 cup of water. I cannot believe that something so incredible easy was so incredibly good. Run, don't walk, to your kitchen and make it now! :)

This had good flavor, I added about a half cup of chocolate chips to give it a richer taste.  I felt that the water was way too much and left the "sauce" too runny, even runnier than pudding.  I would cut back on the water to about 3/4 to 1c.  Good taste though, would try with less water next time.

I switched the milk for heavy cream added till batter becames smooth.  I also add a tsp of espresso powder to the batter and another tsp mixed in the topping.  There are never any leftovers when I make this.

Absolutely delicious! We only ever have all purpose flour, I went off of previous reviews that said to add 1.5 teaspoons of baking powder to the flour to substitute for the self rising flour.

This recipe is like mine that I have been doing for 40+ years, however, mine states to have the hot water mixed with the sugar and cocoa and then dumped on top of the cake.  I prefer mine but that's my opinion.  They're both very good.  The second round of sugar to be used in the sauce part for my recipe asks for brown sugar.  Again, that is my preference.  A good cake that I make at the last minute when I know someone is dropping in.  I add walnuts or whatever nuts you have if you wish.

It was runny with all the butter in the middle. I didn't have self-rising flour and maybe that is why it turned out as it did. May try again with using baking powder along with the flour as one reviewer said.

It was absolutely delicious! I didn't have self-rising flour so I used all purpose, 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp of salt (turned out perfect for the rise). Also I didn't have enough cocoa powder, so I substituted with blocks of unsweetened chocolate, which I melted and mixed with the sugar and boiling water before placing it at the top of the entire batter. It was rich, moist, and delicious! Make sure you place a tray at the bottom of the dish, though. It boiled over and created a little bit of a sticky mess at the bottom of my oven. >.

I totally disagree that the proportions aren't correct.  I have made this many times.  It may be my family's favorite dessert after cheesecake.  It is supposed to be very liquidy/runny.  That is what is the sauce.  In fact, I keep wondering if I could make a little more sauce for it.  The only difference my recipe has is to mix the cocoa, sugar and boiling water together before pouring over the cake batter.  I don't think that would affect the result in any way.

This recipe is extremely simple and dangerously delicious.  
Like others, I made my own self-rising flour.  I also reduced the butter to 4 T and the sugar in the sauce to 3/4 c.  As rodbev pointed out, this looks like a complete mess when it goes into the oven, but it comes out beautifully.  

I will definitely be making again.

I found this recipe about a month ago and have made it 4x since then!! It is like a chocolate lava cake... crunchy in some parts, cake-y in some parts, and then a warm chocolate syrup mmmm. I didn't like it too much by itself, but pair it with some vanilla ice cream and OMG!! My husband and I go through a pan of it in 24 hours!! lol.  PS- I made it just as the recipe states, and it turned out great! :) Not too sweet, but just enough to be delicious!

Very simple yet very yummy!  I've made this 3 days in a row at our restaurant in a 9 x 12 pan & sold out!  I topped it with vanilla bean ice cream & my own home made chocolate drizzle!  It's a HIT!

Very good quick and easy dessert. Reminds me of the hot fudge cake at Old Country Buffet. Goes great with vanilla ice cream. Reheats well too, thanks for the recipe:)

I found this to be delicious and forgiving! I used half wheat flour and for the topping had run out of white sugar, so substituted powdered. I let it sit for a while (during dinner) before we ate it. Texture, flavor, everything was great!

Awesome made it for my wife on her birthday and she loved it as well as everyone else.  Used condensed mike rather than mike.  Followed the recipe other than that.  Maybe a little rum in the water????

Wow - this was a huge hit at my church potluck last night. So many compliments and requests for the recipe. Definitely going to be one of my go-to recipes from now on. The only change i made was to use less water (about 1/3 less) and once it was baked I sprinkled it with icing sugar for decoration, which also left a slightly crispy crust on top. Delicious!!!!!!

Love me some chocolate cobbler! I am picky with chocolate though so I thought it could use more chocolate flavor...added some milk chocolate chips. Making again tonight and my husband suggests pecans so we'll see.

Super easy to make! Very chocolatey, but the chocolate syrup tastes a little watery... That isn't really an issue if you have ice cream to go with it though :)

I loved this.  It was just as good to me cold the next day with ice cream...I am not picky.  I didn't have the self rising flour so I used 1 C. All Purpose with 1 1/2 tsp. Baking Powder and 1/2 tsp. Salt.  I also only had 1/2 tsp. of vanilla left, so I used Almond extract for the other 1/2 tsp.  That gave it a nice taste.

Delicious! I have no idea how the chemistry of this works but wow. I cut down on the sugar - 1/4 c in the batter and about 1/4 c in the topping. I found it just sweet enough w/o it.

Try using 1 c milk instead of only 1/2c.  I prefer the texture, using a bit more milk.  YUM!

OMG.... I wasn't a registered user of this site until I HAD to leave a review for this recipe. I'm a lousy cook and I don't have many fancy ingrediants. I did this one as is  (except for the 1 cup flower and 1.5 ts baking powder). It looked like mud going in the oven. But within 10 minutes, the house smelled like wonderfull  chocolate.  The result was SO delicious. I served it with vanilla icecream and  2 ounces of Baily's on top.  Yummy.   This was easy, inexpensive and required no talent at all :) Just do AS IS.

Made this today..like others, I thought it was a little sweet so I will not use so much sugar next time. I took the advise of others and used more cocoa. It was a little runny while hot but after cooling, it was perfect. I WILL make it again.

This was so delicious. I made it for my husband and grown kids and everyone loved it. It is like a cross between a cake and brownie on top and has a delicious fudgy pudding sauce on the bottom. I think next time i will add nuts. Will definitely make again.

Thought this was an excellent recipe.  I have tried other chocolate cobblers--to my disappointment.  This one is actually like a cobbler should be.  I doubled the recipe for a large group, but thankfully realized I should not double the water.  I probably used about 2 cups water.  It was perfect.  I also shared it with a friend who loved it too.

I made this tonight and it was great.  I used the 8x8 size pan called for and  followed the recipe almost to the T, but I used regular flour with 1 1/2 t BP and 1/2 t salt, also I added 1 c pecans.  Reminds me of the Chocolate Cobbler at Cracker Barrel.

Good recipe for when you need that chocolate fix. I used some coffee in place of the boiling water to bring out the chocolate flavor more. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. This is a keeper. Thank you Dylansmom!

This is the best chocolate dessert I have eaten in a very long time!  I've not had any kind of cobbler before so I had no expectations.  It was very much like hot fudge cake with a brownie base.  I used 4 T. butter, all purpose flour with 1/2 tsp. baking powder and 1/2 tsp. salt, and cut the water down by a 1/4 cup and poured it sloooowly like suggested.  I do not see how this would not turn out great for anyone! Both my boyfriend and I said *insert expletive* upon tasting it because it was so delicious and we normally don't say bad words! It's the best chocolate anything I have ever made! I served it with frozen whipped cream and it was heaven.  I would give it more stars if I could.

It's been a while since I made this, but I had to come back and review it.  It was awesome!  I had been looking for something different to spice up our normal dessert routine and this was it.  I don't think I changed anything (although with me you never know... :)

We teased about renaming this recipe "Chocolate Slobber" when I missed the part about the SELF-RISING flour, but the second time, I made it for a birthday celebration with the correct ingredients and it was FABULOUS.  Looks like slop when it goes in the oven and comes out tasting like a little bit of heaven:-)

SO GOOD! I suggest we ALL make this! I dont usually make dessert, but THIS I could make everyday! (and I almost do!) It is so chocolatey, it really balances well with the sweetness of it, and it also gets a little crunchy crust on the outside. I make it with a little less sugar, as I love the chocolateyness of it, but other than that I followed the recipe as written. I suggest you try it first as written then follow others suggestions, as our tastes are all different. We ate it with chocolate ice cream. Also very good the next day after sitting in the fridge, you can just about pick it up and eat it...with yummy dripping chocolatey fudgey sauce...

I made this for my family last night and the end result was pretty good.  The recipe definitely gets points for being quick and easy...but we found it VERY sweet, even though I reduced the amount of sugar in the batter.  If we're craving something super sweet, I will make this again.

the taste was good but there was too much liquid in the pan...the sauce was too buttery (even after decreasing to 4T) and too watery (even after decreasing that a bit too) and not chocolatey enough.

If your a Chocolate Lover like I am, make this! I too didn't have self-rising flour. I put 1 c. flour, 1 tsp. baking powder and 1/2 tsp. salt.  I served it over ice cream. Will make it again and again. It's a nice change to a regular fruit cobbler.

This one is a keeper. I added a 1Tbs of instant espresso powder to give the sauce an extra little kick. Also easy and wonderful when divided and baked in  ramekins(6)especially for guests. Everyone wanted the recipe. :) Thank you for sharing it!

If you had problems with the consistency, pour the hot water on the top VERY slowly, I mean, pretend you are a sloth or a turtle with arthritis if you have to.  If its driving you nuts to pour that slowly.. then ya may have it right.

This is one of the best recipes I have made in a long time! I didn't have any vanilla extract so I used 1/2 tsp. of rum..and mine had to bake about 35 minutes...perfect! My friend and I ate it plain...it looks like a turd in a bowl but tastes like heaven. I said how easy it was to make and he said, "well it doesn't taste like it was easy". Thank you so much for a delicious recipe!!

Very good.  It's not quite as chocolately as written, but if you use a good cocoa powder it would be perfect.  The sauce that forms is thick and tastes just like hot homemade chocolate pudding or pie filling you'd make on the stove top.  Only substitution I made was using 1 part Vanilla Carmel Coffeemate liquid creamer to 3 parts water because we were out of milk.  Definitely recommend this recipe!

HOLY COW! FANTASTIC! (I did use 1 1/2 tbspn baking powder with 1 cup all-purpose flour instead of the self-rising flour as previously suggested.) I'm a chocoholic, and this recipe was wonderful!!! It's now a regular on my menu!

This cobbler is the BEST!  I'm not sure why this recipe didn't turn out well for some, but I've made it twice & it was perfect both times.  I've had ladies hunting me down at gatherings, to ask for the recipe!  Delicious!

With a little modification, this recipe was GREAT! I reduced the water to 1 c., added lots of extra cocoa powder and added about 1/4 c. of brown sugar to give it a richer flavor. With vanilla ice cream, everyone loved it.

This was the first recipe I made off this website! I never realized I hadn't rated it! Anyways, it looks VERY weird when you're going to put it in the oven, muddy even, be warned! But it is VERY delicious, kind of makes its own pudding or frosting if you will. The most important thing to this recipe is using some VERY good quality chocolate, because it will really determine the outcome of this recipe. It is a chocolate lover's dream!

I halved the recipe but added a lot more cocoa powder - 2.25 tsps seemed way too little. The cobbler had a nice chocolatey taste, but there was hardly any sauce - it was more a rich sticky sponge. I would make this again for a quick sweet treat. Thanks!

I had no idea what to expect, so that may be why my rating is so low.  There was little flavor to the "cake" portion and the "sauce" portion tasted more like anemic hot cocoa and was closer to water consistency.  I baked it for 40 minutes and still didn't feel it was done.  My husband said it didn't seem worth the effort and he'd rather have brownies from a box (this coming from a man who has a strong aversion to mixes of any kind).

I made a double batch of this the day before a family potluck and then warmed it up in the oven a bit before serving. People were raving about it and ate it all. My uncles and aunts loved it and said it was like what they used to call pudding cake when they were kids. My husband has asked me to make this for his birthday instead of a cake!

I have made variations of this dessert before in the past,and this is by FAR the best recipe I have ever tried!! I added about 2 heaping Tablespoons cocoa(instead of 1.5 TBS) and that gave it a little extra chocolate flavor.. I wouldnt change anything else about this recipe though. It is definately a keeper and I will be throwing out all the other knock offs of this recipe!

This was great!  My husband is not a chocolate lover but he thoroughly enjoyed one serving of it and says he would like it every now and then.  If you love homemade chocolate pudding you will love this!  This is much better served warm.  It will reheat nicely in the microwave.  It's not a very pretty dessert, since the good looking part is on the bottom.  The ice cream would probably make it look better.  The first time I made this, I accidentally added the sugar and cocoa to the boiling water, mixed it,  and poured it all on,   (Instead of mixing the cocoa and sugar and sprinkling it on first, then adding the water)   The next time I did this part "right", and you can't tell the difference.  I say, if it's easier, go ahead and mix it in with the water.  The last time I made this I only used 4 T. margarine instead of 6 and it was just as good as with 6.  I will continue to use 4.

Not bad..but not perfect either. I wanted more of a chocolate taste and I used sweetened hershey's cocoa powder, because that was all I had. I also had ran out of vanilla ealier in the day so that flavor was missing. Made a yummy evening desert, but I would tweak before giving to guests.

This was really runny when I first took it out of the oven.  It does "set up" more once you let it cool some.  It was VERY rich.  Serve with vanilla ice cream or yogurt.

Oh my goodness!  This is so icredible!  My mother made something like this when I was growing up.  I have been searching for this recipe for so long.  I can't eat sweets very much, so I put this in the refrigerator after I made it.  Every day I take it out and eat a spoonful.  It is still great even though I made it several days ago.  It is best when HOT out of the oven!

This is AMAZING!!! Soo easy to whip up & I can't even begin to tell you how incredible it is! Wowwww! I would give it 10 stars if I could! Don't be scared of how it looks when you put it in the oven. Yes, it will look like soup, but trust me, it's the bomb Diggity!!!! Make sure to let it COMPLETELY cool off  before serving, But make sure to warm each serving before eating, that way you will get the chocolate lava effect!! Top with some vanilla ice cream or whipped cream!

Wow! I just had to make this after reading the weird instructions Bc I was curious how it would turn out. Followed the instructions = *perfect*! I made it in an oval casserole dish & knew I’d need to increase the baking time by 5 min bc Corningware is thicker than a metal pan. Baked it till it wasn’t wiggling when I took it out of the oven. Maybe the reviewers w problems took it out too early or poured the boiling water too fast and broke up the crust? Don’t reduce the sugar - that’s what makes the crust!

I wanted something gooey and chocolate. This was perfect! I doubled the recipe since it was for a potluck. I baked it in a 13x9 pan for 50 minutes. I was really skeptical because it still jiggled when I took it out. But I had to leave so I went with it. The cake was cooked and hot fudge was baked right in. It seems like some magic must happen for this recipe because it doesn't feel like all those ingredients should add up to such deliciousness. My husband loved it. He thinks it tastes a lot like biscuits with chocolate gravy if you have ever had those.

Everyone loved it. Since I didn't have self-rising flour, I used 1 cup of all-purpose flour and 1.5 tsp of baking powder. However, the end result was a little on the greasy side and very runny. Next time I will cut the butter down to 4 Tbsp and increase the flour, sugar, cocoa powder. I didn't think it was that sweet. I topped it with homemade whip cream.

I made this tonight for mixed group of friends. Some are vegan yet told us they cheat once in awhile. She came back for a third serving and asked for the recipe! We all loved it and I used an 8X8 pan. I baked it for 2 additional minutes and followed other suggestions to use brown sugar for inside ingredients and white for topping. Also followed the non self rising flour suggestions. Did not add vanilla ice cream yet think it would have complimented it immensely. Rich, decadent and delicious! Will make again and probably  to Thanksgiving menu!

I needed a quick and easy 3 am chocolate fix so I made this chocolate cobbler. The batter had a very thick brownie like consistency so I had to add enough extra milk to make it a pourable batter. I substituted a 1/4 c. of Kahlúa and added it to the remaining 1 1/4 c. of boiling water. Also, I didn’t stop with 6 T. of butter. I added the whole stick. Yes, I did! I will be making this again. It turned out so rich and chocolatey.

I've made this dish twice in one week.  The first time in 8x8 pan and, because that wasn't enough, the second time in a 9 x 12 pan.  It is absolutely delish! beyond compare.  This from a life-long chocaholic.  I will definitely be making this again!

Was delicious, kinda thought it was weird when I put it in the over but then it turned out amazing! 100% will be making this again! I would recommend using whipped cream instead of ice cream cause it will be very sweet. Love this recipe

Great for chocolate lovers!  This resembles a Jamaican chocolate pudding cake in its execution.  It looks like you misread the directions when it's ready for the oven, but the result is a wonderfully moist chocolate delight.  I added 1/2-3/3 cups of whole almonds for the heck of it.  Pecans or walnuts could work as well

It's very good and extremely rich.  We found it to be overly sweet, however, and reduced the sugar in the flour/sugar/cocoa mix down to 1/2 cup and in the pudding (sugar/cocoa mix) down to another 1/2 cup, bringing the total to 1 cup of sugar in the entire recipe.  The chocolate was more pronounced and wasn't overshadowed by excessive sweetness.

Tried this for the first time tonight as we were craving chocolate. I asked my husband if he liked it and he looked at me like I had two heads and said he** yes!!  The only thing I had to accommodate for was the self rising flour which I didn’t have. I added 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt to the 1 cup flour and it came out perfectly. This will be a new favorite and will probably replace brownies! It is rich, has the crispy texture of cobbler with a chocolaty sauce underneath and is excellent with vanilla ice cream. Let it cool and the sauce thickens to a perfect consistency. It is the simplest and quickest dessert. Enjoy!

My boyfriend got it into his head that plums chocolate taste good together, so asked me to make dessert with those two in it. When i found this cobbler recipe i thought it was perfect. Simple ingredients and easy steps. His sister and i loved it! The only thing changed was adding some plum slices tossed in brown sugar before topping with the cocoa as sugar mix. And i didn't measure boiling water out just ladled it on until my pan couldn't hold anymore, which was couple ladle fulls. The flavors were rich and chocolatey paired with tartness of the plums.  It came out great paired with some vanilla ice cream! My only change would be that won't so much water next time i think the fruit released lot of own liquid when baking and, in turn, made it a bit too runny. But i highly recommend this recipe and I will definitely be adding this recipe my dessert staples!

Super easy recipe! My family loved it and my husband demanded the pyrex after everybody ate, so he can lick it.  I followed someone's advise to add baking powder and salt to the recipe to prevent from buying self rising flour. The only thing I would change is instead of 1 cup of sugar  and 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder for the topping, to perhaps  1/2 sugar and 1/4 cocoa - It was extremely sweet for me. Other than that it was delish and easy.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! I added raspberries to make it extra delicious. I have made this a couple of times, and have been satisfied every time! I would totally recommend to put raspberries in it! The only reason I gave it four stars was because I changed the recipe a bit.

I actually made it by doubling it for a guy gathering but didn't think it was finished baking. As it turned out, it was fabulous but it does require more baking time when you double the size. I'll be making it again this week!

Oh my. Delish! I doubled the recipe using 9x13. Used only 8 tbsps butter, heaping tbsps of cocoa, 2 1/2 cups boiling h2o, decreased white sugar in base by 1/2 cup & added 1/2 cup brown sugar, decreased sugar in topping BY about 1/4-1/2 cup & baked exactly 25 minutes.

Very easy, and so yummy!  It's ended up being my go-to last minute dessert since I always have the ingredients.  I do use less water, makes for a more fudgy sauce instead of runny.

I made this in Vietnam for my brother's restaurant.  We did not have self-rising flour, nor do they have cocoa or baking powder here.  We improvised by using dark chocolate hot cocoa mix which had sugar and vanilla in it.  They do not have plain vanilla either.  We had to use vanilla beans instead of the liquid vanilla.  Also we could not find an 8x8 or 9x13 pan, so we used bread pans.  The oven was a toaster oven.  Boy, did we need to make changes!  It actually didn't turn out too bad even though I didn't have any measuring devices and the butter was a big block of butter!

This is amazing! Like other reviewers said, the longer it sits, the thicker the sauce gets. I didn't have enough white sugar so I used brown sugar in place of all of the white sugar.  I served this warm over vanilla ice cream and it was restaurant quality desert!

Quick and easy recipe.  Do not use all purpose flour (I did by accident once).  If that's all you have, follow the Allrecipes recipe for converting all purpose flour to self rising flour.

This is our family's favorite chocolate dessert.  We make it according to the notes at the bottom, adding instant coffee granules and pecans, and always serve it with vanilla ice cream.  I keep self-rising flour on hand, so this was no problem for me.

Who knew something that looks so wrong going in would taste so amazing coming out? Followed the recipe almost exactly ( cut out a quarter cup of sugar from the sauce) and loved it, and was unprepared for how nuts the hubby and inlaws went over it. The hubby said it tasted just like the Hot Fudge Brownie dessert at the old Hot Shoppes, the predecessor to Marriott. It's very reminiscent as others have mentioned to a molten lava cake, it's like a soft hot brownie with chocolate sauce. It super very sweet as is ( especially served with ice cream), and will use 1/2 cup in the batter and 1/4 cup on top. Used Ghirardelli cocoa and might try a dark chocolate cocoa next time. I don't normally have self rising flour, so I made it using 1 cup of all-purpose flour plus 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon iodized salt. I only use 4 tablespoons butter.

Loved this!! Growing up my Granny used to make chocolate gravy and biscuits and this reminds me of that.  So, now I can have it as dessert!!   The only change I made was to cut the butter to 4T rather than the 6T,   I think I could reduce the sugar a bit and be fine, but it's quite delicious as it is.  Wouldn't hurt to pair with ice cream, strawberries, cool whip, etc.

This is just like a recipe my mom used to make when I was young, we added walnuts too.  It was good, maybe should have cooked a little longer to make more pudding like as it was a little runny.

I love this stuff.  It's so cheap and easy to make.  It starts off a lot like hot fudge cake.  I like to put saran wrap over the baking dish for leftovers and reheat on the lowest oven setting whenever I want some.  After a few reheats, the consistency becomes more akin to frosted brownies.

This is so good and simple for a quick chocolate fix!  I can mix this up with ingredients I have on-hand most of the time, too.  For self-rising flour, I just added 1/2 tsp. salt and 1-1/2 tsp. baking powder.

The first recipe I'd tried for this, didn't have cocoa in the batter and I think it was better than this one. This was good but awfully rich and like I said not as good as the one without the chocolate battee.

Excellent recipe! This cobbler is perfect for anyone with a sweet tooth. The only thing I changed was the self-rising flour, which I replaced with all-purpose and baking powder. I would suggest if you want a thicker sauce to reduce the amount of water as it can end up like syrup rather than a thick sauce. I will certainly make this again!!!

I made this just as written excepted doubled it in a 13x9 inch pan for a dinner. topped with whipped cream it was a dream. if you are taking it to a dinner make several hours ahead so the chocolate sauce can thicken some. next time might sprinkle a few chopped pecans or walnuts on top. will make again! Addendum...I did make this again just as written in a 9x9 inch pan. It turned out beautifully. The sauce was thicker in the single recipe. So quick and easy!

Delicious!!!! I made a few adjustments. I cooked mine in a crockpot. I used coffee extract, 1/2 cup of sugar, and sprinkled 1/4 cup of chocolate chunks over batter for a richer flavor. I cooked it on high temp for 2 hours and it was Delicious!!!!

My pregnant daughter was craving chocolate, so we made this.  Served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream - delicious!  Took care of the craving, too!  A little goes a long way - it is decadent!  We didn't have self rising flour so added 1-1/2 tsp. baking powder and 1/2 tsp. salt to the mix.

My friends and I LOVED this.  I was a bit worried after the 30 mins in the oven...the middle was still very wiggley and looked raw...but I let it sit for a few hours and it firmed up!  I personally loved the chocolate goo on the bottom.  
My kids also loved it and want it as their birthday cakes!  
Thanks for the recipe!

It certainly didn't look attractive when it was done. But it tasted pretty good. I think I ate it too soon. The chocolate lava/pudding part was extremely liquidy. I may try using less water the next time to see if that helps. My husband thought it was too sweet. I'm on the fence about that and may reduce the sugar amounts. I just wish the phase of "spooning" that flour/sugar/cocoa/milk/vanilla was pourable. Sort of reminds me of when I make lasagna, where you have to strategically spoon the ricotta mix. I like to make things spread evenly. I sifted the sugar/cocoa over the batter. It was uneven. I used a flat, plastic spreader to level it evenly. I agree with another reviewer that you should put the baking dish on a cookie sheet.I don't know. I think I need to play with the recipe more before it works to my satisfaction.

This recipe was absolutely amazing! It was a huge hit at our Christmas get together! The sauce-like pudding stuff added so much and it was loved by everyone there! It looked kind of weird when it came out of the oven so I was a bit worried since I did not use self-rising flour I used the substitute - all-purpose flour plus 1.5 tsp baking powder and .5 tsp salt. It turned out magnificent though! We served it with vanilla ice cream and it was just fantastic! Will surely make this again!

My husband really liked this, which is why I'm giving it four stars.  For me, it was kind of strange-the texture, that is.  I would have liked a deeper chocolate flavor, too.

Was craving chocolate but not a fan of cake so this sounded good. I was impatient so I calculated for 2 servings and cooked it in a 4x4 ceramic dish in the microwave for 3 1/2 minutes. It was awesome. The only change I made was to reduce the sugar and add a pinch of salt. It made a delicious fudgy sauce over a spongy, pudding or brownie like base. Just wish I had some ice cream to put on top.

I've never had a cobbler before, but if this is what a cobbler is, it is officially one of my favorite desserts. I was very skeptical about the gooey mess i was putting in the oven, but it came out as a beautiful crunchy chocolatey pan of deliciousness! The only change i made was baking for 34 min instead of 30. I also substituted self-rising flour for AP flour+1.5 tsp baking powder+1/4 tsp salt. Yum! Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

Okay, I just made this and it looks like a hot lumpy mess! I followed the directions and made adjustments according to the reviews and all I got was "Chocolate Soup". I don't think I'll be making this again anytime in the future..

i'm not sure where some of the reviewers think the proportions on this recipe are off.  We have made this several times and it is always really good.  It turns into a cake with it's own hot fudge.  Make sure you have ice cream when you make this because it is the best!

Very yummy!  I loved the chocolate sauce at the bottom, but for me, it as a bit too sweet.  It was a great combination with the vanilla ice cream-definitely gonna make it again!

This has great flavor but is VERY sweet. I will make it again but next time I will use 1/2 cup sugar in the batter and 1/2 to 3/4 cups for sprinkling on the top.

This was pretty good and very convenient to make with "stock" pantry items.  I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 pan.  Very rich and best served with vanilla ice cream.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, dylansmom!

Wow is this good or what?!?! I searched for something with cocoa and flour but no egg or oil and found this amazing desert. I never knew there was such a thing as chocolate cobbler.  I am so happy I made this instead of brownies. I love the sauce that this makes but you can tell its made with water. I am going to make this again with half water half milk. I will also reduce the sugar in the second step for personal preference (maybe 1/2 cup less). I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13.  I didn't change a thing and I really don't understand the negative reviews on this, other than the rubbery texture which was likely caused by over mixing. Seriously, make this desert :)

This was literally gone within 5 minutes of serving it up.  So easy and so delicious!  I didn't change anything and it turned out perfect.

This would be a 5 star recipe if it WAS NOT so sweet! I am a huge fan of chocolate and sweets, i rarely say anything is too sweet but this recipe definitely needs to cut out AT LEAST  1/2 cup of sugar!!! ESPECIALLY IF YOU PLAN TO EAT IT WITH COOL WHIP OR ICE CREAM!!! Other then that...the taste was divine!

Awesome!  I made this for the first time and followed the advice of some to decrease the butter to 4 tbsp. and adjust the water to 1 1/4 cups.  I also used AP flour with 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp salt.  Once it cooled slightly it made a wonderful fudgy sauce over the cake and was even great the next day cold as the chocolate had turned into pudding.  I will definitely make this again!

I make this for my church 'concession stand' by multiplying everything by 3 (using dark cocoa), and then baking in a large aluminum steam pan.  It has been a HUGE hit & folks line up for it before it comes out of the oven!

Family loved it. A bit too sweet for me but I ate my share.  Next time I'll try cutting the sugar back a bit.  Loved the fact that it made a generous amount of pudding-like topping.

This was a delicious dessert!  I didn't have self rising flour either, but followed another reader's review and used regular flour and added 1/2 cup of baking powder.  I also added pecans and it was amazingly good!  The whole family loved it!

This was fantabulous! It was my first ever chocolate cobbler. I used vanilla soy milk, halved the vanilla and added half a teaspoon of peppermint extract. I also cooked it 10 minutes longer, but that was probably just the oven. It was amazing! I'm going to make it again!

Was very good and something different. It was more like hot chocolate pudding with a crust. I was expecting it to be major rich but was not over poweringly rich.

I'd never tried anything like this. My husband, on first taste said, "That's a unique thing," and then went for seconds. I say it's the perfect blend of crust and gooey. Although it does taste a little like chocolate flour and water mixed together. I wonder how it would turn out with milk instead of the boiling water. Bottom line, easy to prepare, and good texture. Something I will likely make again.

This is amazing. I double the recipe for a 9x13 pan and add about a cup of chocolate chips to the batter. If you Love chocolate you should do this. Then to serve I top it with homemade whip cream.  Very Yummy!!!

Took AnnesGazFam's advice and reduced butter to 2 T. and used a little more cocoa. It turns into a brownie-like cake with its own hot fudge sauce. It was very good with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. There was a grain or two of undissolved sugar in the sauce, but otherwise, it was excellent. My son actually made it with minimal supervision, except for pouring the boiling water and the actual baking. Easy, quick, old-fashioned yumminess!

I really liked this dessert, and even my hubby did and he's not near as much as a chocoholic as I am!  I followed the recipe as it was written and served with Vanilla Ice Cream.  I will make it again, but maybe try to find the Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa instead of the regular.

Oh. My. Goodness... this is maybe the best dessert I've ever eaten, let alone made! Awesome! The only thing I changed was I couldn't bring myself to add a whole other cup of sugar on to the top, so I used maybe 3/4 a cup for the topping, which was just fine! This is DELICIOUS with ice cream on top. Not too rich, but plenty chocolately! You must make this. Now. Get to work!

This looked really weird going in the oven.  I thought for sure there was too much butter and water -- it looked more like soup than anything.  But it turned out great.  I did have to bake it longer than 30 minutes, probably closer to 45.  At 30 it didn't look set and I didn't really want a goopy pudding-like dessert.  I served it with ice cream to my and my husband's buddies and between the 5 of us, we ate the whole thing.  I will probably double the recipe if I make it for them again since some of them wanted seconds but we didn't have any!  Great recipe, very easy.

This recipe was delicious! After reading many of the reviews, I decided to cut back the butter to 4 tablespoons. I also added 1/2 cup toasted hazelnuts and 1/4 cup espresso ground coffee to give it more depth of flavor. Topped it with homemade whipped cream and shaved chocolate. Everyone was just as impressed with this recipe as I was! Will definitely be making this again!

This is just perfect for a chocolate fix. It is very easy to prepare and tastes out of this world. I followed the directions exactly and was very happy with the result. I loved that when I cut into it there was a river of chocolate that flowed up and was so delicious. Others put ice cream on theirs but I just used whipped topping. A little does go a long way though. I highly recommend this recipe.

I read some of the reviews, they stated to sweet or measurements off.  I had no problem with this recipe.  Yes it was sweet, but it's called chocolate cobbler.  I get nothing but compliments everytime i make it.

I so needed a chocolate fix....and this was really good.  The sauce was a little thin...next time, I might decrease the water a bit.  But just the chocolate I needed and I really don't mind thin chocolate either.

i just made this today. and while my boyfriend enjoyed it, there was something about it i didn't like. i didn't know what to expect flavor wise, and i guess i was expecting a tad more cake-like then what it was. maybe it was because i used all purpose flour instead of self risening, i'm not sure. guess i'll have to make it again to find out.

I tried this recipe for the first time today, making no modifications to the original recipe. It was BRILLIANT! My fiance and I both plan on indulging in this regularly. We're both chocoholics and this is perfect for that "gotta have chocolate" craving.

I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 dish and it was very good.  For my personal taste I will add at least 1 more teaspoon of vanilla.  I served it with vanilla ice cream on top and everyone seemed to like it.  Nice to find a desert that doesn't use eggs since I have a grandson allergic to egg whites.

The only thing I changed was to double the vanilla, which I always do with chocolate recipes. It was delicious, I wouldn't change a thing! And the cooking time of 30 minutes was exactly right in my calibrated oven, using the confection setting (for even baking.) One of the reviewers said to pour on the boiling water very very slowly, so I did this and maybe that's the key to it coming out with the proper consistency. The top was dense-cake-like and underneath was a chocolate sauce.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was wonderful.  Granted, it's not as chocolatey as some other recipes, but it is exactly what it says it is.  Delicious!

I ran across this recipe a couple of years ago while looking for something chocolate to bake that didn't require eggs. I'm glad I found it. I love this recipe and make it a lot! Very good just as is, though I use a tad less water to make the sauce a bit thicker. Very nice flavor, easy to make, and turns out well every time.

Pretty tasty -- easy to make!  Not to sweet, actually pretty mild in flavor and I used Giradelli's cocoa.  I added a scoop of vanilla ice cream, blackberries & toasted coconut. Honestly, I think that these ingredients REALLY added to the flavor.  I also think that any berry would be a good addition.

I made this twice.  The first time I made the mistake of not using self rising flour.  It tasted fin but looked terrible.  The second time I added salt and baking powder to the flour and it turned out perfect!  I was curious if the cobbler could be made ahead of time and then heated through again, if it would still be good.  It was wonderful made ahead as well.

Yummy... the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five was that it was a little too sweet (not that it stopped us from eating every last crumb).  I will cut back on the sugar next time.

I was just certain that I was doing something wrong during the prep.  The process was a little strange to me, but the finished product could not have been more delicious!  My girls loved it as much as a restaurant dessert!!  MUST have vanilla ice cream along side.

YUM!!  I followed the directions and did not change the ingredients as some reviewers suggested.  I'm glad.  It was perfect as is.  I did have to cook it about 6-10 minutes longer, but otherwise the recipe was perfect.  This is a cobbler.  There is a cake like part and a more sauce like chocolate part to the finished product.  The cake is semi-sweet and the sauce tastes like molten chocolate pie!  My hubby said he liked this better than chocolate pie.  I wouldn't go that far, but it hits the spot!  The ice cream is a must.  ENJOY!!!

I made this recipe using dark chocolate hershey's cocoa powder.  the result turned out decently.  i think there's far too much butter in the recipe as when i tasted a bite, the butter in the sauce layer was separated and sitting on top!  although, this could be because i tasted the cobbler directly from the oven :)  there's a good possibility that as it cools the sauce will thicken and the butter will be less floaty.  I used a bit more cocoa because we're chocolate fiends and cut the sugar by a 1/4 cup.  i really didn't find the dessert too sweet, although all the dark chocolate made it very rich.  not overwhelming, but decadent.  i will definitely make this recipe again.  it was so easy, quick, and different.  next time, though, i'll make it a bit more cakey, if possible. thanks so much for the tasty treat - my family will adore it :)   update: after allowing the cobbler to cool like any normal person would, i found that the sauce thickened and the butter incorporated.  in the future, i'll decrease the sauce and increase the cake, but the dessert really is fabulously delicious!

Absolutely delicious.  I am making this for the second time in a week.  I was thinking of something more like Cracker Barrell's Chocolate Cobbler when I chose this recipe, but this is MUCH BETTER! My husband's new favorite dessert.

Also known as pudding cake. I made it for a women's group meeting I attend, and everyone loved it. Very easy, even though it looks nasty before baking. ;-)
I thought it was a tad too sweet, but that's easily remedied. Thanks!

I have tried this recipe last night & we agreed that it was far too sweet eventhough i used 2/3cup / 1/2cup of the suggested sugar measurement but still it came out too sweet for us. Somehow the taste was great, maybe next round i will only use 1/2cup / 1/3cup with 4 tbsp butter. Thank you so much for sharing the recipe... It tasted really GOOD.

I followed this exactly as written and it turned out great!  It looked a little odd going into the oven, but after exactly 30 minutes it was done.  I let it cool for a short while and then served  with vanilla ice cream.  My husband and I both made yummy noises as we ate it.  I was nervous the dough wouldn't be done underneath (I hate gooey, undercooked dough), but it was and there was lots of chocolate syrup.  I'll definitely be making this again.  Very easy and very rich!

DH & I really enjoyed this chocolatey sensation! I followed recipe exactly except that I didn't use the full amount of sugar on the second addition... I only did a scant amount of what it called for. It turned out about how I expected it to... a chocolate cobbler.  It had a chocolate-type of sauce in the bottom & formed a cobbler-type of dough on top.  I timed it the exact amount the recipe called for & everything cooked up nice...was totally done. I did have to use a round glass 2.5 qt. bowl instead of 4x4 (didn't have one). I don't think it mattered... turned out great... don't be scared because of all the bad reviews... I wouldn't decrease the water... the liquid made a "nice" sauce.  YUM!

A must for chocoholics. Quick and easy.  Followed recipe exactly.  Just baked  a little longer using a glass pan. Perfect size for smaller families, and easily doubled.    
Also tried it using Hersey's Special Dark Chocolate Cocoa for the sugar/cocoa mix on top creating a dark chocolate sauce.
Don't forget the vanilla icecream.

This chocolate dessert is outstanding, and so easy to prepare.I did wonder about the boiling water, but it worked, the sauce was just right. My husband could hardly stop with one serving.My daughter said it reminded her of coming home from a bad day at school your mom has this wonderful treat to make your day better. This will definately be be one of my favorite desserts to make.Ella Wade

We really enjoyed this dessert.  It was super fast for a week night dinner.  We served it with sliced strawberries and whipped cream.  Next time we will try with mandarin orange slices and whip cream.

This was good but the consistancy was not quite right (a little runny and gummy). I'm not a pro baker so I'm not sure what exactly to do to improve it. Needs something though. As long as you serve with Blue Bell Vanilla Ice Cream it's good. I will update "IF" I try it again.

I just ran across this recipe and couldn't believe I hadn't reviewed it.  I haven't made it in a long time because it is SOOOO good and SOOOOO rich.  I will definitely make it again.  Soon.

Sweet and rich so control your portions.  My two teens loved it but my husband and I should have had smaller pieces.  Easy to make albeit weird looking when you make it.  Enjoy!

This isn't really what I expected.  I was looking for more of a molten choc cake, this was very runny on the bottom.  It was a little better the next day when most of the "water" ran out in the missing portion.  I think it was missing that fudgyness I was expecting.  I don't think I'll try this again, I'd rather just make brownies.

This is a good recipe to make because it is not too sweet and not too rich.  The crust that formed on the edges was the best.  I made this for my bf and one of hid friends and they both really liked it.  I served it warm with vanilla ice cream.

Very good!  Served with icecream on top and spooned some of the chocolate from the bottom of the pan on top.  I don't think I got it cooked all the way but it turned out perfect!

I'm giving this the highest rating because my husband, who is a chocoholic, loved it. I took other reviewers advice, used regular flour and added 1.5 tsp of baking powder. Used one cup boiling water. Really odd looking before you bake, but don't worry - came out great. Brownie like on top, then gooey chocolate sauce on the bottom - was great over ice cream. Will make again!

I honestly would have given this recipe three and a half stars, but since that's not possible, I've given it the benefit of four. I've had similar desserts in restaurants, and this one doesn't quite make the mark. Although it is good for a chocolate fix, this is not the decadent dessert I was looking for. It would make a somewhat striking appearance next to standard desserts at a potluck dinner, but I think the ingredients need to be tweaked to be closer to a restaurant dish.

Very good - minimal ingredients, not too sweet, can throw together in under 10 mins, and comes out looking great.  Serve with dollop of whipped cream, fresh raspberries and a sprig of mint - and your guests will be very impressed.  The only changes I made are - 1) increased the cocoa to 3 Tablespoons and added about 2 Tablespoons to the 1/4 cup 2)cut down the boiling water to little under 1 cup - just enough till it covered all the topping so I suspect the amount of boiling water will depend on the dish you're baking the chocolate cobbler in.

Really good, especially considering how easy it was.  I did need a sheet of foil in the over under the pan to catch the few drips from bubbling over.  I think I'll try using part or all milk instead of water to try and get a creamier, richer flavor next time, but I will definitely be making it again.

Amazing! Tons of chocolate, but not "too" sweet. It is like warm pudding with a bit of a crunch. I had this with some homemade whipeed cream and it was fantastic!

OK...This had a really good flavor, however it was more like a spongy brownie than a crisp cobbler, I like my cobbler crispy and chewy, just not as thick.  Was a lot better the next day!

Oh my goodness, this is fantastic!  There is some debate in the reviews about whether there is too much water in the recipe, but I found the amount of gooey stuff to be just right.  It's a perfect chocolate fix when the pickings in the pantry are slim.  We didn't have ice cream to serve with it, but who cares?  It's wonderful as is.

This was sooooo good.  I think it would be even better with some nuts added. My only suggestion - don't put tin foil over it and let it sit for 1 hour like I did.  It was still yummy, but the crust got too soft.

All I can say is YUM!  This is not a dessert for someone who is not a true chocolate lover!  I like having the extra sauce, as you can drizzle the sauce all over your ice cream.  Also, if you are out of ice cream, this may be a hard dessert to finish, as it is so rich (but delicious!). Thank you for sharing this recipe!!!

I think this is a good base, but i think that the chocolate flavor is really weak in the cake portion. I noticed that when I tested the batter, but I am a firm believer in always doing a recipe the way its written the first time, so I proceeded without adding more chocolate. I will definately double or triple the chocolate the next time. I found that there was a lot of extra sauce as the other reviewers noted, so I will cut the water down a bit the next time as well. Regardless, it was gone at the church potluck- people liked the way it looked and had at it! Thanks for the great idea!

I, too, decreased the sugar and boiling water by about 1/2 cup.  Next time I'll follow the recipe exactly (maybe) because it is really a great recipe.  As written, it would just be much more pudding-like.  I did not have ice cream and it is still great.  Thanks KRice1123 for submitting this recipe.

This is so simple to make and it is delicious. If you ever had the chocolate cobble at Crackle Barrel, then you will love this. Everybody that ate it loved it.

This tasted very much like fudge pudding cake, although the recipe I use for that calls for less butter, brown sugar instead of white, and more water. While I did only use 1 cup of water for this recipe, you can definitely use the full 1 1/3 as I use 1 1/2 for fudge pudding cake and they have the same amount of flour in each. The only thing I really didn't like about this recipe was the hardened grease that showed up on top of the fudge once I stuck this in the fridge. I like this recipe a lot and think it's great both hot and cold, but I think I'll stick with my pudding cake recipe as it's just as good and has fewer calories.

This was fantastic. I added only one cup of water and this was ooey, gooey, and oh so pleasing. Everyone who ate this really loved it and I will be making this again and again. Thank you for the recipe.

I thought it was basically pretty good but too rich! I especially thought that it called for too much sugar. It's still great to eat though, just in smaller amounts.

I thought this was a fun & easy recipe.  Great for a casual environment where you can just scoop it out and serve a la mode.  Great thick sauce.

This wasn't nearly as good at I thought it was going to be.  It was very runny.  Maybe I'll try it again and use less water like everyone else suggested.  I made it for a potluck at work and had to make something else last minute cuz this wasn't something i was going to serve to other people besides my boyfriend and myself.

This was simply "Fabulous"; I made it Sunday afternoon when we had family over and everyone loved it.  I did add more chocolate to the batter....appx. 3 heaping Tablespoons instead of what the recipe called for...We are chocolate lovers and it was PERFECT.  Also served it hot with vanilla ice cream.  Everyone  was very pleased...especially good for the "chocoholic".

I used to make an easy recipe when I was a kid, and the last step was to pour hot water over everything, and the end result was a cakey treat with thick fudge on the bottom.  I thought this was that recipe, but it's not.  This recipe makes something with a lot of runny chocolate sauce on the bottom with a little cake floating on top.  Tasted okay, maybe a little rich -- perhaps too much butter -- don't know precisely but I'll keep lookin' for that recipe from my childhood.

I like this chocolate cobbler  very much it was easy ,and very tasty. My family like it also along with some company i had the night I made it.We had vanilla ice cream with it. I would love to know if  you could do a  coconut or lemon cobbler some how? Any suggestions?
