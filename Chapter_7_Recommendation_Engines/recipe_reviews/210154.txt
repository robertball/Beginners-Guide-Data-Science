We are huge piccata fans and this was an easy, fast take on an easy classic.  I actually used the Bertolli Alfredo with mushrooms and it was delicious.  I also used a package of Perdue chicken tenders which means I didn't have to pound them and they still cooked quickly.  YUM!  Definitely a keeper . . . PS . . . go with the shallots! I served with Barilla Asparagus and Ricotta tortellini.  Perfect!

Made with my cooking class and they enjoyed making and eating it! Very tasty chicken with a marvellous sauce. It was not dry (as chicken can be) and the sauce was a nice touch.

Love this recipe! Very easy to make. The only thing I did different was dip the chicken in flour, then in the egg, and then into japanese bread crumbs. I then place into skillet.  I always make this recipe when company comes for dinner. I always get compliments.

This has to be the BEST dish I have ever cooked/eaten (and I cook and eat a lot)!!!!! Unbelievably amazing. Of course, I did adjust it slightly... but that's my little secret. :)  Following the recipe as is will still produce an INCREDIBLE meal. Great for beginners. Next day leftovers are just as yummy, but it is doubtful that there will be leftovers - this is just that good!

This was an okay dish.  Chicken was delicious but, I always prepare my chicken this way when making a dish with a sauce.  My husband enjoyed it.  I don't know if I will make this again but, was easy to make and quick.  I didn't have shallots and used onion maybe the shallots and lemon peel would make the difference??

My husband and I really enjoyed this. (He said I could make it again, even with company) I tried it because I wanted to start with something I knew we liked (Bertoli alfredo sauce) and branch out into new territory.  I will be making more such ventures after the success of this one.  The first time making it, however, did take much longer than the listed time--more like an hour, although it wasn't difficult.

This was really good!  The coating on the chicken browns up really nicely and the sauce had a good flavor.  I didn't have thyme so I chopped up a couple of basil leaves and threw them in the sauce, and it went well with the shallots and lemon.  There is a lot of sauce so I served this over linguine.  Will make again!

Mmmmm....  I've never beat chicken before cooking it,made the chicken very tender! Mixed up the flour then egg part, did it backwards.  Didn't have thyme or Bertolli sauce, added minced garlic to the last step....Wow! Didn't know lemon zest tasted so delicous!   Now, my husband wants to go to the store to get more chicken so I can make it again tonight!  Marvelous, thank you!

I found this to be quite tasty!  Definitely a new dish and worth trying again!  I did find it a bit too lemon-y. (i balanced it out by adding sugar)  Next time I will add the lemon juice and zest by taste...

This was good. Not WOW but better than average. I used the "quick and easy alfredo sauce" recipe from this site because I didn't have any jarred alfredo. The sauce by itself was really really good (5 stars) but once you get it on the chicken, the breaded chicken flavor kind of drowns out the alfredo flavor. Not bad though. I will make this again. Hubby likes the breaded chicken :)

Awesome!  My picky husband loves this meal!  It's super easy to make after work too.
