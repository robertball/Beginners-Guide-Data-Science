This is soooooo good. I made the mistake of thinking I could peel and devein my own shrimp....I recommend just buying the stuff already done. This isn't really good reheated so you may want to make sure this is your main dish if you have a smaller family.

Ok, I used this recipe more as a guide. I pretty much just eyeballed the ingredients, adding more of whatever until it tasted how I wanted. I omitted the sugar, and used some of the pineapple juice instead, and I also added a good splash of Fish Sauce for more of an authentic Thai flavor. Finally, I didn't bother cooking my noodles separately - I just added them to the soup, and let them soften in the broth. This was absolutely delicious, and something I will definitely make again. Thanks so much, Kathleen!

This recipe is a wonderful base for what I have been looking for!!  I like mine served over white rice, so I left out the noodles altogether.  I used shitake mushrooms, more tomatoes, left out the sugar and used the pineapple juice instead.  The most important ingredient, however, is FISH SAUCE.  I just poured it to taste....lots of it =)   I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this soup!!  It's fabulous!!!

This soup was fair. In my opinion it was a little on the bland side. I would make it again, but with less water and more broth to add flavor. Add more noodles too, throw in the whole 8 oz bag.

I was really craving soup and this recipe really hit the spot! Since pineappple can have a strong flavor I made sure to cut it into small pieces. Instead of the pepper flakes I added red pepper paste to give it a more uniform heat. I am looking forward to the leftovers for lunch.

Followed recipe except for following changes:  Doubled noodles (used rice noodles - authentic), doubled mushrooms (we love mushrooms) and doubled garlic...

It turned out better than expected.  Easy to make, quick and delicious!

Makes a great "cold day" warm-me-up lunch ...

This soup was actually quite good!  However, I would definitely add and improve to this, as the flavor on its own is a little bland for my taste.  I had to substitute some items, however.  Instead of white button mushrooms, I used portobella caps and I think it made the soup a lot heartier than it would have been.  I also omitted the tomato and celery, added a generous helping of rice vinegar (about 1/2 cup), and used a LOT MORE soy sauce than what it called for (about 1/4 cup or so).  (I like my soup salty and sour!)  This was really good and filling.  For those on Weight Watchers:  as made, 1 serving equals 4 PlusPoints.    Delicious.  Thanks, Kathleen!

Sorta somewhat bland, but nothing salt, pepper and some hot sauce can't fix. I liked it, will make again.

First off this is not hot and sour soup, it's Thai in origin. My guys thought it was ok but it lacked a bitterness that they were looking for maybe some vinegar would have helped and they didn't like the noodles in the soup. I took the advice of others and substituted pineapple juice for sugar and added fish sauce but it was still not up to par. The soup has an ok base and with alot of tweaking could make a decent Thai soup but I think I will look for another recipe.

I really liked this recipe.  I was skeptical at first because there was no fish sauce, but it has a great taste.  Very easy to make.    I will definitely make this again!

This was pretty good...a little too sour for my taste...so next time I will reduce the lime juice by half. I also added a tsp of oyster sauce to give it more of an Asian flavor. Will make again.

Maybe use fish sauce instead of soy sauce, but that's just my preference.

Super. Different. Spicy and Colourful.  I had to use a larger noodle and I should have broken them so they fit on the spoon better.  I used canned mushrooms, because I didn't have fresh.  I left out the bean sprouts because I didn't have any.  As recommended in earlier recipes, I added Fish Sauce and I used some pineapple juice replacing the sugar.  I cooked the noodles in the liquid, not before-hand.  The purist might say I changed the recipe too much - I don't care, I credit this recipe with 90% of the end product and that's good enough for me.  5 stars.  This is good.  I served a garlic bread with melted mozzarella cheese and a glass of white wine on the side.  My 14 year old son enjoyed it too.
