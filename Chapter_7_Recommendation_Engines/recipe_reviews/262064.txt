Very easy and will make this again. Made exactly as written but with a bit more sour cream, a few more slices of fresh mushrooms and a couple of dashes of Worcestershire sauce. The white wine used should be a dry wine such as Sauvignon Blanc.

A bit more complicated than the 60’s version... but worth the extras.

I give 3 stars for ease.  It went together in minutes.  I thought the end result was a bit bland.  I wanted to add a vegetable, maybe tomatoes (although that would negate the stroganoff).  Not enough complexity for me.

Great basic recipe - after reading other reviews - I didn't add the mustard, used 1 cup sherry, 1 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup half and half, the soup, lots of garlic salt and some parsley.....came out perfect!  Use wagon wheel pasta and sprinkled a tiny bit of shredded mozzarella before baking.  Very yummy!

it's ok, but even with a few changes I wouldn't make it again. I thought it was way too mustardy, so I added 1/2 c milk and 2 Tbsp sour cream, plus a sprinkling of salt and pepper over the whole casserole. I love cheese, so I added 4 cheese Italian sheds over all, then piano crumbs for crunch, broiling a couple mins at the end. It was still overpowered by the mustard, so maybe cut it to 1/2 tsp? I still prefer my recipe tho.

No changes. Bland even with extra seasoning and wine. I didn't use it but red wine adds the real taste of stroganoff.

Was bland. Even husband, who likes bland , said it had no taste. The only flavor coming through was a hint of vanilla, my fault as had no sour cream. Substituted greek yogurt vanilla, will not do that again. rating gives the benefit of the doubt as might have been a tad better with sour cream. will definitely add some thing next time to enhance flavor.

I only had a half pound of ground beef on hand so I added a little more sour cream and a small can of extra mushrooms.  Was delicious.

I used this recipe but improvised at the last minute. I skipped the white wine and used garlic powder and minced onion in place of fresh ingredients. Very good!

I cook for 22 people.... I quadrupled the recipe.  It was a hit and I am adding this to my rotation.
