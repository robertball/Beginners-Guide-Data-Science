Chicken Rotel Spaghetti Haiku: "Wavered on 4 stars. Would rather non-'strand' noodle. But the taste surprised!" I tend to only use processed Velveeta in "The Stuff", y'know, the elusive cheese dip that everybody makes that goes by many a name that sometimes has browned meat, sausage, Rotel, or peppers in it? So making this recipe was out of the norm for me, but ultimately a major dinner win! I halved the recipe, and the only changes that I made were fresh mushrooms (sweated w/ the onions and bell peppers), used a large can of Kirkland chicken, and didn't bother to stir the Velveeta to melt b4 putting in the oven, as I put this together in the morning, and popped it in the oven at dinnertime. 45 min. at 350 deg. was fine for mine, as it was coming out of the fridge, but I think the cheese and pasta would scorch a bit (unless covered) if baked as directed for that long. My only complaint was the difficult of twirling a spaghetti noodle, but also being able to stabby-stab all the good veggies and flavors also in it, so I'd make it again w/ elbows or rotini.

Fantastic! What's not to love about this easy to prepare classic my mom has made for decades.  Yes: You will fill up 2 pans easily---but they'll go just as fast, so set aside your lunch-at-work portion first. I could forego the black olives and used a fair measure of milk or heavy cream; and I almost used up the large block of Velveeta.  This is good ol' Fall weather comfort food.

We really enjoyed the addition of all the veggies in this dish.  I used fresh mushrooms, but would use less peas if I made again.

Loved it!  Very yummy & easy.  I did some tweaking:  * I used a rotisserie chicken instead of chicken breast - * I used a small container of pesto & 2 cups of cheddar cheese instead of velveeta cheese - 
* I also added a can of artichoke hearts.
