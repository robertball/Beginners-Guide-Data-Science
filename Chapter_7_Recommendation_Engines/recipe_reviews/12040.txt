I made this pretty close to the recipe only I used fresh garlic and onions and after tasting it, I quadrupled the oregano and basil. I did not add the whole amount of salt called for, just a pinch. The capers added an interesting flavor, something I was skeptical about, honestly. I can't say that we liked it or didn't. IMO, it just made it saltier. This is a decent sauce but it really does need more spices. I think this is a sauce that tastes better the longer it sits so next time, I'll make it a day ahead of time.

Instead of using crushed tomatoes, I always subtitute an extra can of diced and a can of stewed.   Omit the capers and add a chopped onion.  I also use 1 tablespoon of fresh basil instead of dried, when possible.  Dump the ingredients in the slow cooker in the morning, and by the afternoon/evening, my kitchen smells so good.  Before serving, I put the tomato chunks in a food processor or blender to smooth it out and even out the taste and acidity.  The leftover sauce freezes/reheats quite well.  My 1 year old gobbles this stuff up!

I was disappointed with this recipe. It was too watery for my liking. Lacked flavor. I will not make this again. I am still searching for a good spaghetti sauce. One that is thicker in texture. Any suggestions?

Had a family reunion & needed a tasty sauce to keep my Italian sausage in during serving.  Followed the recipe pretty much.  No capers. Sauteed an onion & added 3 bay leaves.  Guests asked for the name of the caterer that catered the party. That burst my buttons!!  Half of the food was catered & I prepared the rest.  This ones's a keeper.  Thanks Angchick   P.S. Forgot to mention that I also put some pork neck bones in the oven  350 degrees for one hour & then added them to the sauce while it simmered.  This does make a big difference.   I do this with all my tomato sauces.

I've had better sauces on this site - not enough garlic, oregano, basil, or sugar.  I upped the spices signifigantly and added a can of tomatoe paste to thicken it a bit.  I love the addition of the capers, but it wasn't enough to but this recipe over the top as written.

I made this last night for my family (along with a meatball recipe I found on this site).  Excellent recipe!  This is so fast and so easy to make.  I'm going to play with it a little next time and add some mushrooms and olives.  Thank you for sharing!

This is absolutely without a doubt the best marinara I have ever had except at a restaurant here in Memphis.  The red pepper gives it a nice kick (the Italians have a name for marinara like this and it has the word devil in it lol) I don't like chunks, so I use a food processor etc to liquify the tomatoes.  Try it, you will love it and it is super low low fat and yummy!

This was very good.  I simmered mine in the crock pot for 4 hours on low.  The only thing I didn't add was the capers.  My family really enjoyed this.

This was a very, very tasty marinara sauce, which rivaled even store bought brands.  We didn't have a can of crushed tomatoes and substituted a can of diced tomatoes with chili peppers (rinsed that can).  We didn't have capers but it was still very good!

This was my very first foray into making my own spaghetti sauce and it was super easy.  I followed the recipe, w/the exception of leaving out the capers and upping the spices just a touch.  This is a great base sauce you can doctor many ways to get to your liking.  I like it as is; we ate it w/home made meatballs on meatball sandwiches and we were happy campers.  Literally.  ;)  TY for a great recipe!

Delicious sauce! I grated a carrot and 1/2 zucchini into the sauce, and added a little olive oil. It makes a lot of sauce--we're using the leftovers for pizza.

Very tasty! I didn't have any crushed tomatoes or tomato sauce. I cheated a bit. I ended up using 2 cans of diced tomatoes and a jar of mushroom and onion pasta sauce you can get at the store. To this I added all the ingredients from this recipe as well as 4 anchovies in oil. I really liked the taste. I plan to make the recipe again the way it was originally intended. I'm sure it will be just as good!

Good...It definitely needed more sugar...I would up to 4TBSP and maybe a bit more garlic.  Otherwise it was really good.

This recipe was excellent.  Everybody in my family loved it.  Plus, I didn't realize making my own spaghetti sauch would be so easy.  I won't be using it out of the jar anymore.  It's definitely a regular addition to our menu now.

I thought this was a very good sauce.  I added the "mixture for meatballs, meatloaf..." and it was perfect.  My husband though liked his with Parmesan on top.  YUM!

I loved this. I did increase the sugar since I like a sweeter sauce, and I increased the oregano and basil a lot.  I make this in huge batches and keep it in the refrigerator for spaghetti, pizza, and  on heavily toasted, thick slices of homemade whole wheat bread, with Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top--that's our favorite.

Angela, I've been enjoying your red clam and white clam sauce recipes for a long time so when I came looking for a marinara sauce, I was happy to see your name on one of the recipes.  Once again, you haven't let me down.  Perfect blend of spices, and the texture I like for marinara.
Thanks again!

So tasty and it definitely is not overbearing in italian seasoning like some sauces i've had. The marinara was great, but not overly sweet. Will totally make again!

Used recipe to can 3 1/2 lbs of tomatoes. I added 2 cans of tomato sauce to make 3 quarts. Also, I pureed the capers before including in the sauce. Its a unique taste especially with the capers.

I love this recipe!  So easy to prepare and I make extra so I can freeze it for another day.  I added extra garlic, some finely chopped white onion and simmered the sauce for 2-3hrs.

This was a hit with the family. Did make a few changes: chopped onions sauteed til clear, fresh garlic, no capers and added raw extra lean ground beef to the simmering sauce to make it thicker and meaty;be sure to simmer sauce so the meat will cook through.

I made this for a dinner party last night and it was a hit!  Very easy and really, really good.  I ran out of basil, but added extra garlic and it was still perfect.  I used angel hair pasta and made homemade meatballs, which simmered in the marinara sauce for almost an hour.

What a great recipe! So easy yet the sauce is full of body and flavor. I made a few minor changes replacing the Pomi brand tomato products instead of canned products...just to reduce on the sodium content. This recipe will become a regular in my household. Thanks Angela!

This is a very good sauce.  I made a few modifications like anchovies which I allowed to first simmer in olive oil and garlic until they melted.  I also added chopped black olives to the tomato mixture.  Topped with parmigiano reggiano cheese and dinner was served!  Delicious and so fresh tasting.

Great sauce.  I blended 28oz of diced tomatoes because I didn't have crushed.  This turned out fine in addition to the can of diced.  The capers were a nice touch.  I added some onion powder, hot sauce, LOTS of crushed red pepper, extra black pepper, red wine, marjoram, and some diced pepperoni.  I served this with meatballs.  Great stuff!

Simply Amazing !! i did this for dinner last night and completely changed my way of making spaghetti sauce, i changed things up a bit by adding a small cube of onion powder, more garlic powder and added a bit more of the seasoning ingredients for a strong but subtle tangy after flavor. It was a hit with my family and it stays in the book !! :) Thank You

Instead of adding the garlic powder, I add fresh, chopped onion (since there is already minced garlic in it).  I also add a can of spaghetti sauce instead of a can of tomato sauce since that's what I had on hand.  I did add a bit more sugar and a little white pepper as well.

Wow.  Minor changes were subbing sweetener (sweet n low drops equal to 4 packets) for white sugar, 1 tblsp of brown sugar, 2 more cans of tomato sauce and omitted pepper/capers.  Perfect!  The sweetener offsets the tangy tomato imo.  Try this, you'll like it!

This was one of the better marinara sauces I have tried. Left out the capers because I didn't have.  I think it would have been better though if had 2 cans cruched instead of 1 crushed and 1 diced.. It was thick enough for me and too chunky.

This was a really good sauce. My diced tomatoes were Italian seasoned and I used 2 7 oz. boxes of Del Fuerte brand mexican tomato sauce. No capers. I gave this a generous pinch of crushed red pepper. I used this sauce to make beef stuffed manicotti and the dish turned out fabulous thanks to this great sauce. I will definitely make this one again. I simmered mine for over 3 hours.

I love this recipe!  I've only made it twice.  The first time, I tripled the recipe and simmered it for a few hours.  I also added a pound of cooked crumbled beef.  Yummy.  The second time, I didn't have crushed tomatoes so I added another can of diced tomatoes and a can of tomato soup, and it was delicious.

Very good and flavorful.  I cooked mine in the crock pot.  The only change I made was to reduce the sugar to just a dash; I could still taste the sugar even with just a little bit in, so I can't imagine how sugary it would be if it were two whole teaspoons.

At first, I was thinking this recipe would be too tomato-y, but it came out delicious, much better than sauce in a jar/can and didn't take too long to put together.  I didn't have crushed tomatoes, so I put a can of chopped tomatoes in our "Ultimate Chopper" for 3 seconds and it came out fine.  We had with frozen turkey meatballs.  Next time I will try with fresh herbs.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was great, although I tweaked it a bit.   I sauteed an onion and a package of sliced mushrooms and then tossed in the garlic.  Then I added a cup of red wine and cooked that down, then followed the recipe as is.  It was a little watery after an hour, so I probably simmered it an additional 30-40 min.

I added two cans of tomato sauce and didn't use any crushed/diced tomatoes, since I have picky eaters who don't like chunks. I also added an extra teaspoon of sugar to the mix, to take away the extra "tang." Not bad, for a first try.

I will never buy jarred sauce again!  This marinara was so easy to make and tasted so fresh.  I made some substitutions to the original recipe to make the flavors pop even more:  4 fresh chopped garlic cloves, 2 T. chopped fresh basil and roma tomatoes in place of the diced canned tomatoes.  My husband said it was every bit as good as good Italian restaurant sauce.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I wasn't too sure about this sauce at first, but after letting it sit for a day or too I thought it was wonderful. The flavor was just perfect, and I liked the capers, which I've never had before. I also added the red pepper flakes and thought they gave the sauce a nice kick. The only changes I made were I cut the recipe in half and used just one can of diced tomatoes and one can of tomato sauce.

This was good, but it was not very Italian tasting.  Next time I will add more spices (oregano & basil).  It smelled very good while it was cooking.  I will make this again, but I will have to add more seasoning.

This was good and quick.  Simple ingredients.  Adding the capers is a really nice touch.  To thicken it up drain any canned tomatoes you use.   If using fresh tomatoes (the best) chop and drain - puree if you like a little thicker sauce.  Tomatoes are juicy and the sauce will thicken up when simmered longer.
Thanks for posting!

Made this last night and enjoyed it.  I pretty much stuck to the original recipe except didn't add the capers (didn't have any).  I did, however, add diced onion, green pepper and browned italian sausage as we prefer meat in our sauce.  I will definitely make again but it may be awhile!! There are only two of us and this made quite a bit so I put two bowls in the freezer for the future.

Made it today.  Pretty tasty and just the right
consistency.  Next time, will add chopped
celery, green peppers and some onion.
A large recipe, so froze some for future use.
In 2 freezer bags, mixed some spaghetti
with the sauce.  Other 2 bags, just plain
sauce.  Guess that's what is called planning
ahead for a day you don't feel like cooking.
Oh, yes, cooked it on low in my slo cooker
for about 4 hours.

I increase the spices as I enjoy flavor. I especially wish to address the person who said it was too watery. Take the lid off and continue to cook /simmer and it cooks down nicely. Flavorful, tasty, and a breeze to put together.

I only use fresh herbs.and fresh tomatoes diced up..  I did use organic tomato sauce in cans though.  I used fresh garlic and finely diced yellow onions sautéed in extra virgin olive oil. I put in fresh Italian Parsley.  I put in about 5 whole Basil leaves as well, but take these out after the cooking time.   After a couple of hours simmering after a good boil, I put the burner on low to warm for more time

For a thicker sauce, try adding one can of tomato paste, and up the simmering time to a little over an hour.  Also, you might want to try sauteing some fresh-diced garlic (maybe 3 cloves)  and 1/2 cup of onion in a tablespoon of olive oil before adding all of the ingredients.  Don't be afraid to go crazy with the FRESH basil...it adds an amazing flavor.  After it's simmered, throw some grated Romano or Parmesan in there for a little extra flavor.  Experiment, and see what works for you...that's what makes a great sauce!

Yummmmmy! I'm so happy I found this oh so easy delish recipe! I started with a half onion sautéed with the fresh garlic (but no capers) and added the rest of the ingredients.  My extremely picky 13 yr old even daughter loves it! We had tortellini and "pizza" subs with salami and provolone smothered in this sauce. Oh My Goddess, if this recipe were in a cookbook, the page would be yellowed, dog eared, and covered in tomatoes! It's a Keeper!

I made a few minor changes...sautéed half a yellow onion (in place of capers) before putting in all other ingredients......nothing really to say but this sauce turns out tasting exactly like every single lean cuisine pasta sauce. It's very generic & a tad sweet. I probably won't make this again but if I did I wouldn't use the sugar.

I made this recipe with garden tomatoes instead of canned  used double the amount of spices and one can of plain tomato sauce and one can of tomato paste all organic....cooked for 4 hr. total. I like smooth sauce so I used a hand blender pulser......came out great ! p.s. the capers added complimenting flavor nice addition....Thank you!

This was a great marinara sauce and takes less than 10 minutes to assemble!  I added a small can of tomato paste to thicken it a little, used fresh garlic-about 3 cloves,  used a can of stewed tomatoes instead of diced (picky kids), added meatballs, and omitted the capers because I didn't have any.  The only suggestion I would make is that if you are feeding boys, this only serves about 4 and that is with the meatballs.  I will double it next time.

I needed to use up some fresh tomatoes so I used them in place of the canned crushed and diced.  Needed to add a little paste to thicken it up at the end.  Delicious!

I truly believe that if you have the time--stick to a homemade marinara sauce.  It is healthier for you than canned and when making it, your home smells delicious. This recipe is a classic guideline for a marinara sauce which you can easily fit to your taste. I followed almost exactly except followed advice from other reviewers regarding the following: omitted capers and added 1 chopped onion, blended crushed and diced tomatoes then added to the pot, added 2 bay leaves just because I wanted to and finally...threw it all in the crockpot for 4 hours on high.  Easy as cake and came out great!

Super good! The only thing I might've enjoyed better is if the tomatoes were actually fresh and not out of a can, and lots more spices!! Other than that :) Loved it. And should've taken your memo on the sugar ;) It was a little tart. Still good though!

Good sauce, I did add a little more basil, garlic and oregano, also added a can of tomato paste to make it a little thicker.  Red pepper makes it a little spicy.

I was so worried about this sauce because it started out watery, however I let it simmer for 45 min with regular stirrings and it was rockstar by the end! Was also a little worried about the capers but again was so glad I went with my instincts. My boyfriend and I agree it's 10X better then any jarred sauce. I did add onion and extra garlic and just eyeballed the seasonings as I added them, I also realized I didn't have any diced tomatoes so I just went on without them but it was great!! I am so glad I found this recipe because I always feel like when I get done with my spaghetti there is water instead of sauce left on my plate and this sauce definitely solved this problem. I will say you have to let it simmer for at least 45 min but it is great! Will use it again for sure!

I thought this was good but would not use it in my regular rotation.  I did like that it had a bit of kick to it from the red pepper flakes.  I used 2 cans of crushed tomatoes instead of the diced as we don't like chunks of tomato.  I whizzed it up in the food processor after it had simmered too to make it less chunky.  Didn't use the capers as I didn't have any.

Excellent!  My kids 3 and 5 loved it with the capers but I only add the red peppers to my personal serving.  I love the chunks but I make a double batch and puree some for pizza sauce, yum!!  I haven't made a sauce so quick where you don't have to first sautee onions and garlic, I love how you just open cans and crush some garlic.

I use any combination of tomatoes I have, whole roma, crushed, etc then chop up a bit if using the whole tomato later.

Very good in a bowl eaten with a hearty crusty bread and parm cheese sprinkled on it- you don't even need the noodles to enjoy it!  Thanks for the excellent recipe!

Very good sauce, and easy to make.  It's just a little bit spicy and the capers make it feel like you're at a fancy restaurant.  Great recipe!

This was pretty good.  I'm still on my search for amazing sauce though.  Here's what I did differently: I put the diced tomatoes in a blender because I didn't want a chunky sauce.  I used a good amount of fresh basil instead of the dried.  Also, I added about 1/4 tsp. onion powder along with the other spices.  I omitted the capers and crushed red pepper for the kids sake but added extra ground black pepper.  I also cooked up about 1/2 lb. mild italian sausage and added that to the sauce.  I tasted it and it seemed a bit acidic so I added about 1 Tbsp. of olive oil.  I will probably make again and keep trying to tweak with different tomato products, etc. to see if I can get what I'm looking for.

I'm searching for a sauce similiar in taste/textue to Prego Mushroom with Extra Spice.  This was almost as good!  The capers were an interesting addition.  I made a double batch and got 4 meals for my small family!

This sauce was AWESOME!!!!  I started out the evening wih not a CLUE what to make for dinner, but thanks to this recipe we had a WONDERFUL dinner!  My husband RAVED about the sauce!  I doubled the recipe and froze the remainder.  Our 9 year old liked it, but the 6 year old didn't...*It's too spicy*.  Granted, it does have kick, but then I added just a tiny bit more of the herbs and spicies than the recipe called for.  We will DEFINATELY make again!

Very good sauce.  I didn't have diced tomatoes so I put 1 can of spicy Rotel in the Oscar so it wouldn't be chunky, also added some wine, and extra garlic.  I thought the capers in it were very good, never used them in "gravy" before, I will from now on.

This recipe was just okay for my taste.  I probably won't make it again, unless I did a lot of tweaking.  Then again, I can be pretty picky when it comes to spaghetti sauce.

Very good marinara sauce! I did leave out the capers because I didn't have any and I also made it in the slow cooker. I will make this one again! Thank you Angela!
