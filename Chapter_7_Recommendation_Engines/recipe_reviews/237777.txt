Stop buying your wings at the pizza joints or wing places. This recipe is so easy  resulting in the perfect lemon pepper wings. If you want to bake the wings to that crispness like frying, let the wings dry out uncovered overnight in the refrigerator prior to baking.

I follows the recipe exact, but I did add honey to mines as well. My family enjoyed it, great finger food for various events.

It was a hit. I think I may experiment with my lemon pepper seasoning (Suggestions appreciated), but overall the recipe is solid good. N
