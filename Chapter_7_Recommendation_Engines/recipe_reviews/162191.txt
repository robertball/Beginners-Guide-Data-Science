Tasty, delicious and healthy!  I didn't want this to be spicy because my two toddlers were eating it too so I only used a combination of 1 jalapeno seeded and red and yellow bell pepers, only used half tablespoon of caraway seeds but next time I'll use the full amount (interesting but lovely adittion to the dish) and instead of fresh tomatoes I used one can of diced tomatoes (didn't have fresh). We ate this  with a side of potatoes that I sliced thinly and fried with a little olive oil and a sprinkling of salt and pepper and some toast. One more to the recipe box! Thanks Asma and mother in law for sharing your recipe! Elvira Silva.

I really enjoyed this—it was a quick, easy dinner. I used a combination of peppers I got from the farmers’ market; next time I’ll pick a few spicier varieties. Five stars for the fact that it’s an interesting flavor combination I never would’ve thought of, it’s easy, and the leftover peppers made a great sandwich spread!

I wanted a recipe that would help me to use up all the peppers and tomatoes that I had and this was perfect.  It was really really good!  I liked it so much that I am going to make it again tomorrow!  And I will keep making it in the future!  Thanks! :)

This was very simple and filling. I had thought to alter the recipe and add fried diced potatoes but used the submitters suggestion of serving with a crusty bread instead. Very good, but I think I would like to try it with potatoes as well. Thanks!

YUM! I only used 1 t. caraway because I wasn't sure about that. But it was delicious. I used 1 poblano and 2 jalapenos and that was just about the perfect amount of "hot peppers." It wasn't too hot at all.

Omg was this one good.  Caraway seeds were perfect which I would have never though to pair with fried eggs.  I made this for a quick light lunch.  YUM YUM!
