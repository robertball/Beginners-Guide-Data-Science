I used the half can of golden mushroom soup in the meatloaf but nobody wanted the mushroom soup gravy.  The ratio of meat to bread crumbs, moisture from the egg and half can of soup was right on the money.  It sure could use some more seasonings though.

This was good. I did add 1 tbsp of ketchup and 1 tbsp of mustard. Added a nice flavour. Would make it again. Nice to have meatloaf without a tomato base.

Not traditional meatloaf, but it's tasty!
