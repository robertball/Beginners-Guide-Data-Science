Good but basic. I like my recipe for strawberry napoleons better because it mixes the fresh strawberries with strawberry preserves and the cream mixture is whipped heavy cream, vanilla and cream cheese. Top with a sprig of mint and a strawberry on top.

My suggestion is to "dock" the bottom sheets with a fork,
this will help the bottom sheets rise more evenly and help keep the whole pastry stable.
we did this very thing in the bake shop when we had to make a couple of hundred of them.....good recipe otherwise

I first saw this recipe on the Puff Pastry box. I made these for Easter dessert, and they were a big hit.  Very elegant looking, but EASY to do.  You can prepare everything early in the day, then assemble the pieces when you're ready to serve.  Could use other fruit, like sliced peaches or mixed berries.  Great taste, great presentation!

This was a total delish treat, hands down...but I may have not understood the last step I ended up splitting each 12 portions in half any way and stacking the way I thought it should be...Only problem was after I'd stack the pastry on top of each pudding and strawberry layer, it still start to fall over. So I really had to improvise to keep them stacked...But for my kids, I just did the one layer(puff pastry, creme mix, strawberries, a dab of creme mix, puff pastry, powdered sugar, with a touch of whip cream and half a strawberry) If you could see all of my kids' faces while they were eating you would totally understand how HUGE of a hysterical funny mess they made, while trying to eat them...however, my kids came back for seconds, because they enjoyed this light and airy treat. I will sooo make this again. TOTALLY. I have no clue why I've never made anything like this before until now.

I've had this recipes for years.  I also use real whipped cream and add 1/4 tsp. almond extract to the pudding/cream mixture.  Makes a great presentation!

Super easy and very delicious napoleons.  I served these at a party and everyone raved and raved.  But even after using real whipped cream, we still felt the taste of the filling was too artificial.  Next time I will make a custard filling from scratch!

This recipe is really easy and really tasty - it doesn't get much better than that.  I was asked to bring dessert last minute, so I needed something really quick to put together, and this was minimal fuss.  I used puff pastry shells and broke each one into 3 pieces - 2 layers of strawberries and 2 layers of pudding mix - really impressive looking.  The pudding mix is just the right amount for 6 pastry shells.  Great when strawberries are in season!

Honestly, this has become our absolutely favorite dessert . . . the entire family went completely nuts over this.  It's perfectly wonderful as is, but we have also experimented a bit, preferring using true whipped cream (from heavy whipping cream), as opposed to the cool whip.  We occasionally added a tablespoon of Tang orange drink powder to the pudding mixture, or we grated some orange zest into the pudding mixture for added interest.  The beauty of this recipe is that it appeals to kids and grownups, alike, and you can use whatever berries you have on hand.  For July 4th, blueberries and strawberries make a beautiful combination with the pudding and puff pastry.  Amazing recipe!  It has truly bumped out my favorite trifle recipe as our family's most treasured dessert!

These dissapeared quickly at a BBQ and were easy to put together.  Made a lot of filling (way too much).  I added about a 1/4 cup of Khalua to the filling for an extra kick. Only would have wished for the crust to be a bit thicker - I'll try doubling the layers of puff pastry next time.

Have made this for a couple of years, don't remember if I thought it up myself or saw the recipe somewhere but I do it a bit differently. I use instant cheesecake sugar-free pudding mix layered with the fresh strawberries and Cool Whip. It looks and tastes like I slaved all day.

Agree, that this makes an attractive dessert, but I'm not a custard/pudding fan.  The instant vanilla pudding is quite overpowering.  Would be much more delicious with just the whipped topping or fresh whipped cream.

what a great dessert idea!  I'm going to suggest we serve a simplified version of this at our  tennis club this summer for our Ontario version of Wimbleton's Strawberries and cream festival.  I might even go really decadent and use Devon cream.

Maximum elegance for minimum fuss. This was super - easy to assemble, looked stunning, and tasted delicious. I made it one day ahead, keeping the cream in the fridge and the pastry squares in an air-tight container our of the fridge. It went over so well with my company I plan on making it again for the guest expected next week.

4.5 stars is more appropriate.  These were quite good and very easy to make!  I wish I would have added a bit of sugar to my berries, as I feel the dish could have been a tad sweeter for our tastes.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, PESTANO!

Nice, easy recipe and very tasty. Have plenty of pudding on hand but omitted it simply because I forgot. I give it five stars without pudding so it must be really super with it.

the flavor was good but the consistency of the pudding mixture was too loose.  They didn't look so good plated (almost like they were melting) and they were very messy to eat

Let me say - YUM!  This was a super easy and delicious little treat.  Just finished making them and ate one right away.  And so did my grandfather.  We both loved them.  Oh, did I mention I had to make these one handed.  I had hand surgery a few weeks ago and I have been going crazy not being able to cook or bake anything.  So, thanks for posting this recipe.

Very good, very simple, a show stopper. I used real whipping cream and added a  layer of fresh blueberries, for a Memorial Day BBQ. My family loves this recipe. For chocolate lovers make a chocolate pudding filling.  There are so many variations of fresh fruit you can use. Pick your favorites and enjoy and easy dessert.

An excellent, easy recipe that looks very impressive and tastes great. I used whipped cream instead of the nondairy stuff, as I try to avoid as many "artificial" foods as I can, and it turned out great. I'm thinking about making miniature ones for Christmas for a dessert tray, maybe cutting out the puff pastry with a star cutter. Thanks for the super idea!

This is a great summer recipe and was a hit at a recent BBQ! The kids loved it. I've used it a few times since and dress the plate up for "sit down meals" with a little drizzle of chocolate sauce at the bottom. Buy strawberries at the peak of the season for the best taste.

I made these the other night and my guests really enjoyed them.  I personally thought they were just "okay" but maybe I am just too critical of my own cooking!  I also found them a little time consuming to assemble.

THis recipe was very good but I think I got the wrong puff pastry shells and vanilla pudding. I couldn't find any other type of shells except the octagon shaped which didn't do well splitting apart and the pudding was too sweet no matter how much more milk I added. It was good either way but I think I will try to find the right ingredients next time =) thanks for the recipe

I thought this was very good.  It was not too sweet, light and yummy!  My guests enjoyed it as well.  Hubbie, however, would rather have this on a cake.  I think next time I will try on a yellow cake or pound cake.

I used pistachio pudding which added some extra flavor without making it too strong or sweet.  It also added some pretty color. Used frozen strawberries because that was all I had and it came out great but am looking forward to fresh next time. Since there were only 2 of us, I just put together enough for that night, stored strawberries and pudding in fridge and baked pastry in airtight container.  The next night I put them together again and they were still delicious.  When I make for company, will prep everything the day before and bake pastry the day of.  Then put together before serving.

Easy and elegant. Followed suggestion and used cheesecake flavored jello which was great and probably solves the “fake” vanilla flavor problem. Mixed my jello with Trader Joe’s shelf stable whipping cream. Will make again!

I changed the cream. Instead using pudim mix, I made a cream adding 1 can of condensed milk, 1 can of milk, 2 egg yolks, 1 teaspoon of natural vanilla extract  and two tablespoon of starch. Cooked in low heat, stirring until thickened. Refrigerate

Easy Oh my yes, delicious, Oh my yes. I used frozen strawberries and so it was dripping with juice. It may not have passed for someone who wanted neat. I was so pleased with this recipe.  I thought afterward I would have add blueberries and perhaps some other fruit and let the pastry a little larger to have a dessert.  
What can I say I loved the ease of making this.

I sweetened the berries with a tablespoon of sugar and used homemade whipped cream. Super easy, beautiful , yummy dessert. Next time I'll cut the puff pastry sections in halves instead of fourths.

Great for emergency desert-- don't really like instant vanilla pudding.. Much better and worth effort to make pastry cream and fold in some tight whipped cream.. Sugared strawberries or fold in a couple table spoons of grand manier..

I've made this recipe and drew raves. The only change I made was substituting a half-cup of almond milk and a half-cup of fatfee half & half for the 2% milk, which made the custard creamier and extremely tastier. This will be a regular treat at our home.
