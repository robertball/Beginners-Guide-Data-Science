Really yummy! I replaced the gin with ginger ale and it was excellent. I served it at a girls only party and everyone loved it and wanted more.

These were way too strong to taste good. I told myself the next batch would have less alcohol but I got too trashed to make a second batch that night! I plan to keep experimenting with this recipe until it satisfies my taste buds.

"I must admit, this recipe was slammin'. I had some pink panties at a party before, both made-up by two different people. I didnt get a chance to ask how they were made. So I went on-line to allrecipes.com and found Kesha's. From now on I will be making my own pink panies, thanx to Kesha. "you go girl."

With the plentiful supply of fresh strawberries I used them instead of frozen. A good quality gin and vanilla ice cream is a must for this recipe. Can't wait to make this beverage again next summer.

of course they are delicious! it's a such a flirty fun drink -- only one problem really: they get too sweet. i discovered that RASPBERRY pink lemonade makes them absolutely divine.

What a fun drink! My roommate and I made these a couple weeks back to celebrate their softball league victory. I normally don't like any sort of "cream" in my drink but since this was a blended/slushy like drink - it went down good. NOTE: I did use 1/2c less gin...and it was a good thing I did! More and it would have been too strong!

I made this without the alcohol because I was making it for me and my kiddos.  We all thought it was a delicious and refreshing drink on a scorcher of a day.  I used strawberry cheesecake ice cream and added a little bit of sugar for the kids.  Plan on making again and again.

Instead of gin, try whiskey. Or vanilla vodka.

I used fresh strawberries instead of frozen and used more than 1/2 cup.  They were a hit.  Next time though, I might use 8 ounces instead of 12.  They were a bit strong.

It was an AWESOME drink, very good and smooth!It was strong but could not really tell. PERFECT for a "girlie" drink! Ididnt give it four stars only because I could only have about 2 before the sugar upset my stomach.

I left out the gin because I share my smoothies with kids, of course. I also added a couple scoops of ice cream to sweeten it up. It was really good my only complaint was I had a lot of trouble getting the ingredients blended together. A little to much frozen stuff to put together.

I didn't like this. It really is way too sweet, and the flavors are pretty ghastly together. It might work better with vodka. Thanks anyway.

This is fabulous.  I teach high school foods classes.  For our fruit lab, we made smoothies.  Obviously we used ginger ale instead of gin.  I have 5 kitchens in each class and 6 classes.  This was without doubt the best of all 30.  I will make this again for every function I have.  Can't wait to try it with the gin!  At home of course, NOT at school.

Waaaay too sweet! Okay if you only want a sip, but I like to have a glass full of my cold fruity drinks. I tried adding more ice cream to calm it down but didn't help much.

Too sweet for me - I could only drink one.  But then again, it was strong enough one was all I needed.  I also tried this using rasperberries and raspberry limeade.

This is a fun and very tasty drink, not feeling the strawberries so I made mine without them.
