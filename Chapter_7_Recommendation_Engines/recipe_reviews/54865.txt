These were somewhat bland the first time I made them.  The second time I added cooked sausage, scrambled eggs, O'brien potatoes and a mix of cheddar and pepperjack to stuff the enchiladas.  What a very pleasant surprise....  Quite tasty, in fact.  Just to experiment, I froze two of the enchiladas and am so very glad I did.  Had no idea what to expect as I have never had a reason to freeze scrambled eggs.  Popped them into the oven and when done, tasted as if they were freshly made.  Perfect to keep on hand for surprise overnight guests!

YES Five Stars!  I made a few changes.  Instead of ham I used bacon and medium spicy sausage.  I also used scrambles eggs and put inside.  After I rolled them I took the sauce and mixed with sour cream then topped with cheese.  When serving I had sour cream and freshly made Pica de Galla.  Every one told me it was the best breakfast they ever had.  I thought so too.

This recipe was really good.  I actually added eggs in the burritos also.  Great tasting.  I think I will try pouring eggs over the whole thing too to try and make a casserole.  Yummy!

I needed a recipe for ham, and had most of the ingredients on hand, my 6 yr & 3 yr old actually enjoyed it. I did not have green enchilada sauce so made the Ten Minute Enchilada Sauce found on the website. We've now tried it both ways and prefer the taste of the Ten Minute Enchilada Sauce. I also used 4 grated potatoe's instead of the frozen hasbrowns.

I made this like a casserole...in layers and used corn tortillas. I topped it with a couple of dallops of sour cream and it came out pretty tasty. Next time I will try it with beans and chorizo with flour tortillas and maybe a red enchilada sauce for something different.

I made half the amount home fries just for this recipe (instead of using packaged frozen hashbrowns) and threw in a few scrambled eggs in place of some of the home fries. I also used corn tortillas--for me, the corn tortillas seem to stand up better when used in enchilada recipes. These weren't bad. The recipe was easy and filled up three hungry men for not much money at all.

I was not impressed with these at all.  They seemed to be missing something.  I think I was expecting a more traditional enchilada flavor to them.  The flour tortillas got really saugy and sticky.  If I decide to try this again I will use corn tortillas lightly fried in oil instead.  Maybe I will add some egg as well.

Oddly enough I'm the odd review out. However that is because if you're like me and possibly sensitive to spicy tastes this might upset you as well. I didn't use green chile enchilada sauce, I used regular enchilada sauce that was mild. The can diced green chile peppers was enough to make it too spicy for me.   28 ounce can of enchilada sauce proved to be way too much. I think it will take experimenting to make this taste wonderful, possibly some cooked eggs in it as well as mushrooms and get rid of the chile peppers. I think that it will be something I definitely will modify until I find something to suit my tastes.  That being said - my husband didn't mind it, but said it could use some changes as well.

I made this 2 times, first by the instructions it had NO flavor, the next time I added egg & crumbled bacon to the inside. Then topped each tortilla with enchilada sauce and it still was nothing to write home about. The kids wouldn't even eat it and they will eat any breakfast food.

This is really yummy!  I used jalapenos instead of chiles as that is  what we had on hand and pepper jack cheese in place of cheddar cheese...oh and bacon instead of ham (as i also did not have any ham on hand).  Anyhow, a great addition to our breakfast menu.

We made this for our men's breakfast at our church.  It was good, but we felt it needed some egg mixture, it was a little dry.

I really liked this recipe.  I could have used fresh New Mexico chiles but I was making the recipe for a cooking challenge and had to make it with ingredients that are widely available.  I only had enough potato/ham mixture for four enchiladas - maybe I filled them too much?  My husband really liked this and I will definitely be making it again.

I made this for company. I decided to use sausage instead of ham. I also used 2 cans of chopped chiles and 2 cans of sauce and more cheese and chopped onion. I cut the shells like noodles and layered it. This recipe gave me a good start. My family loved it. Sorry I always add my own touch to things.

Had this for dinner, added eggs and used red sauce which I added some to the egg/potato mixture.  Served with refried beans and salsa.

I made these last night and added some eggs but it came out mushy. It was very good regardless, but does anybody have ideas on how I could make the hashbrowns crispy without using a million dishes??

I think if you are going to have a breakfast enchilada is has to have eggs. That is the oly reason I did not give this a 5 star.  I think I will try it again with eggs.

we couldn't find green enchilada sauce so we made it with a medium red enchilada sauce and it was great, just top it with a little sour cream.

DH does not like eggs, so this was a great recipe for breakfast enchiladas that didn't include eggs. They were great.  I did not need as much enchilada sauce as the recipe called for.

This recipe is really good with the addition of scrambled eggs to the enchiladas.  The kids liked it too.  I will substitue the 10 minute enchilada sauce (really, really good) for the canned sauce next time.

Great idea, and very easy to change to suit other tastes or what you have on hand.  I used sausage instead of ham (had it on hand), scrambled 9 eggs and threw them into the mix, used red enchilada sauce (again, on hand), and they rocked!  Next time I will go shopping and make it as stated.  Love this recipe for it's versatility.

I love this recipe.  The only thing I change is to double the chopped chiles.  When I make it for a crowd there is never any left.  I am always asked for the recipe

I forgot to buy ham, so I didn't put ham in. However, I did add some eggs to the hash browns while cooking them. Delicious! Also added salsa verde and green enchilada sauce

In order to prevent the tortillas from getting soggy, I "toasted" them on a pan. Then, ran them trhough the enchilada sauce. I used corn tortillas, as well. I did two at a time and sprayed a bit of pam before each. I also made this as more of a casserole, than rolled up tortillas by laying them flat like lasagna. I also added egg, like many other suggested. Gave this a 4 because I ended up making my own enchilada sauce and the diced chilis were not necessary b/c my sauce was packed with lots of flavor. The concenpt was great!!

Disclaimer: I have a problem with people that totally change everything about a recipe and then give it bad reviews. 
That being said, I had to tweak this as I didn't have everything on hand. I used frozen hash brown patties, thawed in the microwave, bulk pork breakfast sausage, no green chili, corn tortillas and red enchilada sauce. I'm quite sure the recipe as-is is wonderful. With the changes I had to make, it was fabulous. My husband had it 2 days in a row!

I made this recipe for the office. It was a BIG HIT. I have been asked for the recipe over and over agen and have been told that others who make it are asked for the recipe. This one is GOOD.

I will make this again.  Had some problems browning the hash browns....I never made hash browns from a bag so it was probably my lack of experience.  Next time I'll try browning them in the oven as an alternative noted on the bag. I did use Trader Joe Chile and Onion tortillas--we don't care for the standard tortillas, but I'm sure it will be delicious with the standard tortilla if that is what you enjoy.  In the future I may try other meats, cheese, and additional veggies, but I think this will likely be my favorite breakfast enchilada.

Pretty yummy. Really good flavor.  Just did without dredging the tortillas in the sauce first since they have sauce on bottom and later on top

We liked these but they seriously needed eggs. Plus the dipping tortillas step made a huge mess, and I wound up abandoning that after about the second one in favor of putting a small amount of sauce inside each enchilada and then dumping the rest over the top. Good starting point, but as written this needs some tweaking.

I made this dish and it turned out wonderful! After I had browned the ham and hash browns I did add 3 eggs which I scrambled and that really brought it all together. I would definitely recommend this to all.

I made a few changes to meet our household preferences.  for starters, I subbed breakfast sausage for the ham, as I don't eat ham.  we also added some green onions in place of the chille peppers.  we put green onions both in the enchiladas and outside, for more flavor.  also inside the enchiladas, we added black olives, diced tomatoes, red bell pepper, steamed spinach, and more cheese - because why not.  on top.  the flavors all worked very well together and we loved them so much.  we are so glad we made enough for another few days' worth of breakfast!

I used this as a baseline, I halved it and used chorizo and jalapeños instead if ham and chillis because that's what we had available. Ithad amazing flavor and my fiancé even had seconds which is rare for breakfast :) So I will definitely be making this again!! Just remember if you put foil on for the 1st 20 minutes remember to bubble or tent it or you'll lose half of your cheese ??

I loved the idea! I ran with it. I added eggs (with sour cream and cheese), ground, spicy, Italian sausage and bacon. I made the hash browns from scratch, too. And I used my own red enchilada sauce. I mixed Monterey Jack with the Cheddar, as well. So ya, it was nothing like the recipe above but it certainly got me on the road to a great breaky!! Brilliant idea!!

I replaced the ham with carnitas and used 505 mild green chili sauce for the enchilada sauce.  I made 9x13 trays and they were all gone for a brunch I hosted.  (other people brought food too)

I made it.
First off I had to add eggs(4).
I also made my own hash browns.
I used my glass pie pan for the dipping of the flour tortillas 
The times worked out swell
Wife was thrilled.
Yes will make this again. Very tasty.

Awesome Christmas make-ahead breakfast!  I modified the recipe slightly.  My daughter and I are vegetarian, so I made two versions - one with no meat and I substituted green chilis and diced tomatoes for the ham.  The other "meat" version I used sage breakfast sausage instead of ham, and the carnivors in my house loved it!!  I also used red enchilada sauce for the meat version, and green chili enchilada sauce for the vegetarian version.    Super yummy with the browned hash browns inside the enchiladas!  I will definitely make this again, and probably for dinner next time!

Made this for a morning brunch.  I had enough egg dishes and wanted something different than hash browns to serve along side.  I used mild sauce per our preferences.  I also did not dip the tortillas as my experience with other recipes suggested that they would absorb the sauce just fine by coating the bottom and pouring over the top.  I added diced andoullie sausage to most of them, and left a few meatless for our vegetarian guests.  They were a big hit.

This is a good recipe to use as a base and go from there. Instead of ham I prefer to use a good quality chorizo made from ground pork shoulder instead of the traditional chorizo made from pork snouts, salivary glands and lymph nodes. I spice it up a bit more for us with serrano peppers. One enchilada per serving is a bit skimpy so I find that this really makes 4 servings, not 8 and it keeps well so that we either have the leftovers as a rerun for dinner or reheated the next morning for breakfast. If it's Mexican it's easy to tweak to your own taste preference.

I added onions and scrambled eggs. It was pretty good, but I accidentally used hot chili peppers and enchilada sauce so it was a little too spicy for my taste. Next time I’ll be more careful and will also add more ham and eggs and less hash browns.

really a nice recipe , as some have mentioned it lacks that one thing to make it special. I tried jalapenos, salsa guacamole and pepper sauce. The guac worked best for me and I also added mushrooms but I don't recommend you make too many changes to work of the author.

Have not made it yet I was concerned about diced ham and no eggs...   I am going to try it but we need to put green chili into the tortilla...  for canned I would probably use Hatch Green Chili but fortunately for me I have a stash of Hand Smoked Hatch Green Chili (I don't roast my peppers I take it the extra mile and smoke them)...  and I am thinking cheese inside of the tortilla as well with Chorizo ....  but I am definitely trying this out ...  forget ham...  use bacon and not the store brand bacon go to your local butcher shop or carniceria and get a custom cured bacon...  life is about experience and eating is an experience ...  make it outrageous!

I made this for my small group class and it was a big hit. I didn't have ham but browned a pound of ground country sausage and crumbled about 4 slices of bacon in the mixture. I put my shells in hot oil and cooked just a minute and it helped to keep them from being soggy. I will cook it again. I had enough mixture left and put in 3 separate flower shells rolled like a burrito deep fried them. My grandchildren were in heaven.

I was looking for something other than regular eggs and toast or waffles for my hungry bunch. i swapped out for corn tortillas, and added scrambled eggs.I also had leftover green bell pepper so i added that in. then when done i topped with green table onion and sour cream. the kids loved it. I dont think i would do any more different next time, maybe experiment with different meats to see if they prefer one over the other. definite hit!

Very good, but I used the recipe as a starting point.. my filling was a can of black beans, 10 scrambled eggs, 1 cup shredded cheese, green chilis, regular Italian sausage. In addition to the green enchilada sauce, I added a second can of pork green chili.

I used Simply Potatoes southwest style hash browns from the refrigerator section of the grocery.  Also used Jenni-O turkey ham for health reasons. Had a corn cob so shucked that and put it in the saute.  Turned out very spicy but good.  i'll make again but will likely add egg to tone it all down a bit.

Very tasty and filling meal for our Sunday brunch today. I used 2 pouches of Montreal smoked meat because that is what I had on hand and it worked awesome. Also made my own salsa verde. We ate it with a fried egg on the side, but you could scramble it and fill the tortilla . Don't be afraid to doctor a recipe to your taste if you found the original recipe bland.   Try it!

Can't stop making this, though I did use corn tortillas and removed ham because I'm vegetarian.

This is good! It's not bland at all and it doesn't seem to be missing anything. I used hot green chiles and medium enchilada sauce so maybe that's why it wasn't bland for us! I did not make any changes to the recipe! :)

Yummy! I added diced jalapeno to give it some spice.
