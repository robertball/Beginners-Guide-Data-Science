I love theese! I have made them now several times. Somtimes I add shrimp or chicken instead of pork. I add bean sprouts at times as well. I LOVE that they are baked, not fried, and still come out crispy!

 My only suggestion for others, is to make sure you get SPRING ROLL Wrappers, not the stuff that most grocerystores carry. The real oriental stores carry wrappers that are about 1/8 thinner than those you can get at the grocery. The thinner wrappers makes theese cook up just like a real spring roll. The thicker store bought wrappers, make for a less crisp, chewy srpingroll, although still GREAT!

 You can also bake theese, and then freeze them and have them for a quick snack. I always make about 100 when I make them!

 Oh and I had to add, instead of fussing with turning after 10 minuets. I set my oven to BROIL for hte last 10 min and lower the rack. This cooks them nicely on BOTH sides w/o the worry of turning!

This was very good and easy to make.  I used cole slaw mix which made it extremely fast.

These are a great appetizer.  Instead of using spring rolls (which my local market didn't have) I tried using pasta wrappers (like used for egg rolls).  They turned out great!  Also, I added quite a bit of thai garlic chili sauce which made it a little easier to work with, and nice and spicy!

These turned out delicious. I especially liked this recipe because it was quick and easy, and you don't have the huge hassle and cleanup of deep frying.  Instead of pork, I used 1/2 a package of rice vermicelli (125g)like our local Thai and Vietnamese restaurants do.  I also added some soy sauce and salt as I found the mix not seasoned enough.  They turned out great.  I doubled the recipe trying to get 24, but I only got 16, perhaps I put too much filling in, but something to consider.  I dipped them in a sweet and sour sauce....YUM! Make sure to turn them 1/2 way through for even browning.  GREAT RECIPE!

This is nothing short of excellent.  If I may, for all you vegetarians, I also tried omitting the pork and instead used an assortment of chopped mushrooms (wild and cultivated) along with shredded, chopped mung bean noodles (the stuff that looks like white wire). Before baking I sprayed it with cooking spray rather than brushing for even fewer calories.  Yummo!

I used egg roll wrappers. I baked some of them and fried some. The baked were pretty good but I still prefer the heart-attack-on-a-plate fried method. I'd definitely bake them if I were to make them very often. The filling was very good. I used a bit of dried ginger instead of the fresh because I thought so much fresh ginger might overpower the other ingredients. I'll make these again!

I thought this was a great recipe...especially for my first time making spring rolls. I added some diced water chestnuts for an extra crunch. For a dipping sauce I mixed some orange marmalade I had on hand with some dijon mustard...it made a nice sweet and tangy sauce to go with it. Awesome!!

Wow! No one would believe they werent fried! And what a nice way to save some calories! Thanks, Ranyna, for a great addition to my recipe box. This is definitely a keeper. I also liked the suggestion of using the ready made coleslaw - that is certainly a time saver. Thanks!

These were fantastic!  Even my picky 2-year-old ate them!  And my mom asked what I put in the meat mixture, which is very complimentary coming from her.  The rolls were crispy and I didn't even mind that they were not deep-fried.  Delicious and highly recommended.

This is my first time reviewing any of the many wonderful recipes on the site, and I can't stop raving about it! I doubled the oyster sauce and accidentally used 1/2 tablespoon of sesame oil instead of 1/2 teaspoon - it still came out great! Actually I recommend doing this based on the other comments about it being dry because they actually were very moist without being greasy. No dipping sauce required, flavorful and delicious...my family can't stop talking about how good they are. The best part was when my husband (who is Chinese) said it reminded him of going to his grandmother's house as a kid. A+++++!

This recipe is delicious!!! It was a big hit with the family at Thanksgiving (as an appetizer.) Don't bother with the cilantro. Too strong of a flavor that overpowers the dish. I used a Hot Chile Sesame Oil instead of Sesame Oil AND Chile Sauce. It gave a little bit of heat and a great sesame flavor. I also added close to double the ammount of veggies & spices. the veg to pork ratio in the recipe isnt that great, and I definitely wanted more flavor. Without the extras, they were a little bland. Make sure to add soy sauce & salt too.  They really help bring out the flavors of the other spices. I couldn't find Spring Roll Wrappers at the grocery store so I went to my local Chinese take out restaurant and they sold me a package of 24 for $2.50! Buy extra wrappers so you can play around with the whole tuck & roll thing. It took a few rolls before I got the hang of it. Make sure you make a couple at a time to test out the flavors before making the whole batch. I kept adding things until the taste was perfect. Once I got it right, they were great. My boyfriend who claims to hate spring rolls, couldn't stay away from them! I made a sweet & sour sauce to go with. Yum. Enjoy!

Oh my goodness, this was soooo good!  After reading the reviews I needed to try this recipe, but didn't have everything on hand, so I substituted a few things.  I used crab instead of pork, no cilantro, a pinch of powdered ginger, chili-garlic sauce and hoisin sauce instead of the oyster sauce. Oh, and I added a bit of soya sauce as well, just to make it more moist. Like other reviewers I used a bagged coleslaw mix to save a bit of time and I sprayed the rolls with cooking spray rather than brushing with oil.  They turned out so great, the flavour was awesome and they were really crispy.  I highly recommend this recipe!

In all honesty, I didn't even look at the filling recipe.  I simply never thought to BAKE the spring rolls.

It cuts out so much of the fat and calories.  A spring roll wrapper alone is only 50 or less calories. 

Hint:
rather than add cornstarch to thicken the liquid, I let my filling sit in a colander for a about five minutes to drain excess liquid before putting in the wrappers.

here's my version of the filling:
use similar amounts of cabbage, carrots, green onion and cooked chicken breast.  Chop finely.  Stir fry in 1/2 tbs olive oil, add 3 tbs low sodium kikkoman soy sauce, grated fresh ginger, black pepper and minced garlic to taste.  Stir fry until cabbage has softened.  Drain mixture in a mesh strainer to reduce excess liquids. PLace in wrapper and bake according to this recipe.

These were very good.  The recipe is easy to follow, and my family really liked them.  If (like me) you've never made spring rolls before it can be a little confusing to work with the spring roll wrappers.  After a quick check on the internet, though, I learned I needed to soak each wrapper in hot water before working with it.  
Excellent recipe!

These rolls are so delicious!  Like other reviewers, I didn't really "measure" the ingredients, I tossed them together until they looked balanced but they still turned out terrific.  Do treat your baking sheet with non-stick spray and turn the rolls after 10 minutes.  This is a keeper!

Great recipe! I only made one change, I used ground chicken instead of pork. The flavoring in the mixture was sweet with a faint hint of heat. The amount of filling is perfect for 12 spring rolls. My only issue is that I found 20 minutes not quite long enough to make it as crispy as it could be. Next time I will broil for a few minutes at the end.

These are delicious!  The texture isn't quite as crunchy as fried but the flavor is so good we didn't even miss it!  My husband and I will definately make these again. The below mustard dipping sauce is excellent with them:  1/2 cup Dijion mustard 1/4 cup hot water 1/4 cup rice vinegar 1 TSP seasame oil 1 TBS Sugar  Mix all ingredients together until sugar dissovles.

I just made these and am tickled pink to know I have some in the freezer for whenever I want! I used spring roll wrappers (otherwise known as rice paper). If you cant find spring roll wrappers, look in the freezer section of your grocery store for lumpia wrappers. I think these have the same texture when fried so might do ok baked. I did adjust my seasoning a litte (the filling is cooked so give it a taste before you make one to make sure you like it). I doubled the recipe and ended up with 17 medium sized rolls. My only tip for rolling is, fold the sides in first and then the bottom and keep rolling till you get to the top! Thanks for the recipe! :)

My first attempt at making spring rolls and everything worked perfectly!  Very pleased!  I thought they were extremely easy - didn't waste a single wrapper!  Omitted the pork, because I was serving to a non-meat eating guest, so I added extra carrot, minced green pepper and cucumber.  Not a cilantro fan, so I halved the cilantro.  Used prepackaged coleslaw mix and eyeballed the quantity - probably had a bit more that what was called for.  Because of that and the reviews that said their rolls were dry, I added more of the other liquid ingredients.  I think if the cabbage mixture looks moist, you should be fine.  Assembly was a breeze - except I had to thin the cornstarch mixture - next time will use 1 tsp cornstarch to 1 tbsp water.  Ended up with about 1 1/2 tbsp of mixture for 12 spring rolls.  Was spicier than I expected (probably due to my changes), so next time I will serve with a lighter, sweeter sauce instead of the peanut sauce we had.  I served this with Easy Chicken Satay and Asian Coconut Rice and will probably make the exact same meal next time, except include the pork in this dish.

The supposed use of spring roll wrappers (rice paper) is very deceiving. I used authentic rice paper, which is the traditional spring roll wrapper. f you do this, it becomes a complete mess after baking. The wrappers are all gooey and only the corners crisp up. I had to empty all of my spring rolls (after I attempted to bake them in the rice paper) and start over again- with egg roll wrappers. These worked perfect. The filling is very good, but the ingredient list should be altered.

Man, I wanted this to be good, but those wrappers were nothing like the picture in this recipe. Mine turned transparent when wet, and while I was able to roll them up, OK, they remained gummy and soggy even after baking more than 20 minutes at 425*. One tiny corner of one roll got crispy, and the rest was a soggy mess. Taste was fine, but no one was going to be able to eat these as finger food. Forks and knives were the only way.

YUM.  I doubled the carrot and the wet ingredients, substituting fish sauce for the oyster sauce.  Everyone loved them!!  I served with Sweet and Sour Sauce.

Yum!   We just dipped them in soy sauce.  If you end up with leftover filling, then mix it up with some rice and grab a fork.

Boyfriend always requests this.  The rolling gets easier once you have done it once or twice.  Baking these is simpler but, of course, frying makes them a bit more indulgent.  I use coleslaw mix for the cabbage part.

These are excellent! I like to serve it with duck sauce or a chile sauce and as a side with egg drop soup. I don't consider myself a slow mover but I think 25 minutes is an underestimate of the prep time. After cooking the pork, chopping the veggies, mixing ingredients, stuffing rolls, etc. it took at least 35-40 min, but it's worth it!

I love these and I love how they are baked instead of fried.  The mix alone is great (I ate half of it while rolling them).  I used ground turkey and put it in my food processor to mince.  Otherwise I followed the receipe exact.  The first time I added way too much filling and they all busted open while in the oven.

This is a great spring roll that is full of flavor.  I used an egg wash instead of the oil.  Just make sure to line your pans with parchment or tinfoil so there isn't so much of a mess with the egg wash.

These were marvelous.  I did make a few changes though. I like lots of vegetables so I used a package of asian slaw and increased the seasonings accordingly to taste.  I do have to admit that I like them fried better than baked.  The family was divided 50/50 on this.

These spring rolls were super yummy.  I made them exactly ad directed.  Probably use more veg next time, but they were really good as is.  Very easy to make...I was a little nervous as this was my first attempt at spring rolls.  These tasted like they were deep fried.....so crispy on the outside.  Really good.  I made extra, put the non cooked ones in a freezer bag and froze.  We had them for days after, just take some out, throw on a cookie sheet and 20 minutes later your loving life.  Will be making again for sure......I actually want some right now

These were really good, I would make them again.  I had to use egg roll wrappers, as my grocery store didn't have spring roll wrappers.  I used coleslaw mix and added a TBS of soy sauce, as suggested by others.  I used "A Taste of Thai" sweet chili sauce.

Great recipe alternative to a fried spring roll.  Recipe worked great.  You have to be careful not to buy the "fresh" spring roll wrappers (which come in sheets of hard, clear rice paper that needs to be soaked).  These wrappers are not meant to be cooked and will not bake well.  I accidentally used these my first attempt at this recipe and while the result tasted good, it was soggy and just didn't bake crispy, regardless of how long in the oven.

Simply fantastic.  I used extremely thin spring roll wrappers and they turned out super crispy - people had a hard time believing they weren't fried!  Very good and I would really recommend them (but they do take a while - it's very important that everything gets chopped up very small).

Great!  Never made spring rolls before and I had to go to an oriental market to find spring roll wrappers.  I am so glad I read a bunch of reviews first, because I wouldn't have had a clue how to handle the wrappers.  The first group I soaked too long because they tore a lot.  But they were 99 cents for a zillion of them, so I threw those out & started over. For the filling, I used storebought coleslaw mix as others mentioned.  I also used leftover pork tenderloin chopped up finely instead of the ground pork.  I used more of all the spices and added some hot chili oil because we like stuff spicy.  Didn't have any fresh cilantro so I used some dried.  I don't think I would bother with cilantro next time.  I can't wait to try this with shrimp or chicken.  It is a really fun recipe to play with.  I made the sweet & sour sauce from this site to go with it and everyone loved it too.  Thanks for a yummy recipe!

These were easy and delicious and my whole family loved them.  I added soy sauce to taste to the mixture and served with sweet and sour sauce.  I tested a few and found that they were the crispiest when cooked under the broiler 5 minutes for each side.  Thank you for sharing.

I tried this with pork, & another time with shrimp -- both very good.  I rolled them 90min before baking, which made them easy for my party.  Resist the urge to overfill your springrolls (no more than 2 tblsp filling).  This will help them stay presentable if you slice diagnolly before serving.  Because these tend to stick to my non-stick cookie sheets, I use parchment paper.  But at such a high oven temperature, the paper burns toward he end of baking time (not sure how to get around this).  My "tasters" gobbled them down, & appreciate that they were oven baked rather than fried.  Rayna, thanks for this recipe!

These were very good!! I made a few changes. I doubled the amount of carrot and cabbage as I prefer more veggies and less meat in egg rolls. I also added about a tsp of soy sauce and about a tbs of brown sugar. I will defintely make these again perhaps using rice instead of the meat. Thanks for the recipe!!

Good this way but ours were very greasy (maybe because we SOAKED the rice paper first but couldn't figure out how to do them otherwise) ... next time will try just spraying the tops of them.  Yummy with shrimp!

Yum. Very good recipe. I added more veggies to this as well as water chestnuts to make these more of a main dish egg roll than an appetizer. I served this with the also yummy oriental dipping sauce from this site. I'll make this again soon. Would be good using shredded chicken as well.

This is a fabulous recipe! I did  fry the rolls though. My teens love these and ask for them often. Easy to prepare and they are a make ahead item that can go in the refrigerator until you are ready to cook. I also put the pork in a small food processor and gave it a whirl so that the pork would distribute better in the roll. Please note: I will always use cilantro at a minimum because I find that it does tend to overpower a dish.

Honestly, I wasn't crazy about these--I didn't really like the sauce/spice mix used to flavor the filling. I made these for a party the night before, and fresh out of the oven, they are tasty and crispy. The next day, however, they were weirdly soggy and not crispy at all. They still got totally snapped up at the party, though, so clearly some people liked them.

My husband really liked these!  They are fairly easy to make, although a bit time consuming.  I thought they were ok, though a bit bland.  I will make them again however.  Would rate them 3.5 if I could ^_^

These were not simple to make, but that could be because I was having my 4 year old help me. I did use the shortcut of using the coleslaw mix and it was wonderfully easy. My littlest kids seemed to really like these but us older ones didn't care too much for them. Probably won't do again.

These are good.  I made them w/ ground hamburger, drained.  But the underside does not get crispy.  Be sure to turn them over.

These are really good. I had round spring roll wrappers, but they were fine. I doubled the oyster sauce,etc (as recommended by some) and also added some sambal (Thai chili paste) for heat. OH! The most important- I added Chinese 5 spice powder when browning the pork! I skipped the cilantro only because I didn't have any, otherwise I would put it in. Used cole slaw mix but added extra carrot. Truly wonderful!

Amazing! crispy but not greasy. I used veggie "beef" instead of pork, and a bit of soy sauce and szechuan sauce for the oyster sauce. I want to make these again tomorrow they were soooo good! One note, I found the cornstarch mix didn't glue the wrappers but a flour/water paste did the trick.

I would give it 5 stars, but I didn't have a good time with these.  The smell was wonderful, but I had never used spring rolls before and there was no direction on the package.  I tried my first one and the roll cracked, so I knew something was wrong.  I called a Chinese restaurant and asked what I should do and the girl said to put them in water for a little bit - well, I think it should have been more than a little bit.  I had no idea what the rolls were supposed to look like to use, but now I know.  I probably will try them again sometime - when I get brave.  It's too bad my guests were the guinea pigs.

I do prefer the deepfried. The flavor was good, but the texture so crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. I had trouble biting through the roll without it shattering. I followed the advice of others who sprayed and turned them in 10 minutes. Maybe my oven is cooking too hot.

Great! I made these for a party and they were a big hit!  I added sesame seeds, a little soy sauce, diced waterchestnuts, and a little extra chile sauce so they wouldn't be dry.  I served them with a sweet and sour sauce.  I will definitely make again!  My only suggestion...I wanted them to stay hot until the party so I wrapped them in foil.  Bad idea!  They were nice and crispy, but in the foil they steamed themselves and ended up a bit soggy.  They were still great, but I would not suggest wrapping in foil!

The flavor was only a three star, and it WAS a bit dry, but because it was baked, it gets some slacks.  A healthy alternative to fried spring rolls, and they look pretty too.

These are great. Added small white onion, teaspoon garlic, 1/8 cup soy sauce to season the meat while it was cooking. I used the slaw mix for the cabbage carrot.Changed the chile sauce to garlic chile paste. Due to sea food allergy , I used a spicy peanut sauce for the oyster sauce .
The last change I made was using egg roll wrappers. I have used ground turkey or a combination of ground pork with turkey. 
They always turn out great.

These were great! I made them for the first time for a cooking lesson with a novice cook. The recipe was very easy to follow and they taste wonderful - not heavy and greasy like restaurant ones. Maybe a teriyaki dipping sauce would taste good with them. Thanks, Rayna!

Only my 1-year old liked this.  The rest of us thought it was too dry and bland.  It was my 1st attempt at making spring rolls, so that was discouraging.  I guess I'll try to deepfry them next time, and maybe use a different recipe altogether.

Baked Pork Spring Rolls Haiku: "'Guts' of these were GREAT, I'd make those and eat alone, and just skip the 'rolls." So I followed the recipe exactly and did end up w/ more filling than I could use for rolling (which incidentally, I had to do w/ Natsoya's egg roll wrappers, as that's all that I could find at my 4 nearby grocery stores, but I should've taken my Dad's suggestion and just asked at one of the way more than 4 nearby Chinese restaurants if I could buy spring roll wrappers from them!) Anyways, the filling was SO good and I actually liked the extras of it better spooned over rice, rather than the trouble of rolling and baking. (And absolutely, fried would've been much tastier, but the recipe is for "baked" and that's what I did.) I'm so glad that I tried this though b/c I've never prepared spring or egg rolls b4!

So good! I used a pound of pork since that's what I had and extra sesame oil.  I also used coleslaw mix like other reviewers said and they turned out fantastic!  I don't know if anybody else had this issue, but the first test batch I did stuck super bad to the pan.  I sprayed it with non-stick spray and they were perfect.  Thanks!

My whole family disliked the strong ginger taste that these had. I made them vegetarian, but would either cut the ginger out or down significantly next time. Everything else worked out ok. I'd try it again, but with modifications for sure.

Absolutely great recipe!! I waited to try this as I'm not a baker, but on a rainy day, thought I'd give it a try. My greatest challenge was figuring out with the tools I had how to determine chopped, diced, finely sliced and minced....typical man!! Thank you for the Internet!! Because I knew nothing about the spring roll wrappers, I screwed my 2 test rolls up before I looked up the directions on how to handle the rice wrappers. After that no problem. Didn't have chili sauce, so made my own using chili powder and water. If I can con someone in the family into bringing ingredients next time, I'll bust some out for football season and look like a hero!!!

Very loosely followed the recipe... didn't have the carrot, green onion, oyster sauce, or chili sauce... so I made something more like a cousin to this recipe. And it was REALLY good. I made my own spring roll wrappers (tedious but very cheap as they only require flour, water, and salt). I used equal parts melted red pepper jelly, soy sauce, and rice wine vinegar to dress the veggies in the mix, added jalepenos and red onion, and cooked the meat in hoisin and honey. 

Cooking it in the oven was a fantastic tip. They were lovely and crunchy and served as an excellent surprise for the other hungry bear in my life :)

Great easy recipe, I used bean sprouts left out cilantro and accidentally tipped more oyster sauce in but it turned out fine and tasty anyway :)  They are fiddly to make but they dont have to look perfect, because they wont last long n the plate!
I liked a 50/50 ratio of meat and veges maybe even 60/40 in favour of veges.
I found the baking and turning once worked really well - nice and crispy, even without brushing with oil.  I also cooked with the seam side down first and they kept their shape.

I have to say that I was a bit disappointed in this...The filling was delicious (I did add a bit of soy sauce also), but I think the wrappers called for are wrong. I used spring roll wrappers and they came out chewy, gummy and hard on the ends, which none of us liked. I would def try these again using egg roll wrappers, b/c I'm thinking that that is what's supposed to be used. Also, I doubled the filling and barely got 12, so maybe plan on doing that if you are wanting 12 of these.

Almost perfect...I felt it needed cooked rice vermicelli.
Freezing: I doubled the batch and only cooked them for 1/2 the time. Defrosted on low in microwave then threw on a non-stick skillet with no oil until golden to recrisp. Double wrapping the rolls will help keep from tears if you like to pack them full.
Overall, this recipe has so much flavor, they don't even need a dipping sauce.  Very, very good and freezes great = 5 stars!

These are awesome!  I made them for a party once, now I'm required to bring them every where I go!  I make a double batch of filling, and use 1 package of egg roll wrappers (couldn't find the spring roll wrappers the first time).  Works out perfectly!  Still cook the same way, and I always turn the rolls half way thru cooking, or the bottom gets too brown. Thanks for sharing!

We make them every week.
I use 1 TBS Oyster sauce and 1tsp soy. I use Sriracha for the Chili sauce. To increase protein I add bean thread noodle and two eggs, with a shot  of Sriracha, cooked as a thin omelet and cut into strips.
We eat 3, with some rice and salad, so we get two meals.  If we made more to freeze, I doubt if I would eat anything else:)
My wife uses a commercial spring roll sauce and I make a sauce of i part cranberry sauce,1 1/2 parts white vinagar a splash of soy and Sriracha to taste. Heat sauce to blend.

These are A-mazing! The only substitution I made was that I used ground turkey instead of pork to cut down on the fat and calories. These spring rolls were crispy and delicious and got a 5 star rating from my family. I will DEFINITELY be making these again. And again! Thanks for posting this!

I changed this up more than a little.. Bacon cabbage carrot garlic and red onions sauteed with crushed red chilis and ginger powder. Rolled them up and sealed it with oyster sauce (cuz I forgot it in the cabbage mix) and then into the oven until brown. Great starting point!

WOW!  This was so totally awesome!  I made these for a few friends that came over this evening and they just loved them!  I doubled the recipe and got 26 spring rolls.  5 adults scarfed down every single one!  I couldn't stop eating the filling before rolling the spring rolls!  My guests were shocked at how tasty and crunchy these were right out of the oven.  I used an oil mister to spritz some peanut oil on them right before baking.  I baked mine for 15 min, turned and baked another 10.  They came out a beautiful golden color and just as crunchy as could be.  Here's a hint on the wrappers.  True spring roll wrappers are super thin and tear easily if they become dry.  I keep a spray bottle with water and before peeling off a wrapper I mist it lightly with the water and then roll.  I also misted the stack of wrappers after peeling the top one off, just to make it more pliable by the time I came back to the stack.  As I finished rolling each one, I would mist the finished rolls and cover them with a towel until I was ready to bake them.  And for the record, it took me an hour to prep this-and that's using a food processor for the veggies.  It was worth every minute!  I will be making these over and over again, AND I won't feel guilty because they aren't deep fried!  Thanks Rayna for sharing this recipe!

This was so-so.  The porportion wrapper to filling was not enough; result was a bland taste.  Also the wrapper was very chewy almost tough.

I was blown away with surprise with how good these were!  The filling I used was leftover from some pot stickers I made (which consisted of pork, cabbage, green onion, garlic, ginger, sesame oil, soy sauce, and a beaten egg).  I just put a decent amount on my spring roll wrappers, wrapped them up, slathered them with a combination of sesame oil and vegetable oil, and baked them.  I wish I had turned them half way so they would be crispy on both sides.  I was so happy with how they turned out and it was nice to have something to complement the pot stickers I made.

The stuffing was good, but I must have had the wrong kind of wrappers ("Spring Roll Shells") because they totally did not work. The shells were super stiff, so I wet them to get them to fold but then they wouldn't crisp in the oven (unless they burned). I may try again sometime with different wrappers - or use lettuce as I think they'd be good lettuce wraps. I also used a recipe on this site as a substitute for chile sauce and I used soy sauce with a little sugar for oyster sauce.

Loved these! I tried them once as written then, a little lazier the second time, I didn't cook the pork first. I shredded the cabage, carrots and pork in the food prossesor with everything else then just spooned it into the wraps - so easy!

These were great.  I've always fried my spring rolls in the past, but these taste just as good and are so much easier.

doubled the recipe, thinking I'd have a few leftover for lunches the next day, when we had a dinner party of 7. Guess NOT! They were a huge hit, especially with a the kick of freshly grated ginger, the perfect warmth.

These are the best spring rolls I've ever eaten! I made them for one party (the given serving size) and they were gone in like 15 minutes. I made them a second time for Christmas (with "Sweet and Sour Sauve II"--add cayenne, garlic chile sauce, and 2 Tbsp soy sauce). I made 30 that time and they were also a HUGE hit and disappeared quickly. By far, try these!!! You won't regret it! The only thing I changed is that I eliminated the cilantro because I'm not a fan. It wasn't missed.

My kids loved these.  I doubled the recipe and was able to use up most of the wrappers in my package.  I ended up with 19.  They are definitely not as savory as a fried spring roll but a great healthier alternative.  Way less messy than dealing with all the oil too.  If you want them "lightly browned" as the recipe states, I recommend turning the oven temp. down to 400 and turning them often.  Some people who are used to the traditional might be disappointed in the taste but all in all they are pretty good.

I made these last night and they were a complete success. I doubled the sauces and cabbage and  as many reviewers suggested. And I used hot pork sausage to add some additionaly spices. I baked as per the recipe but had my husband fry 1 in 1 tablespoon of olive oil and also fried one in olive oil Pam-style spray. My husband, 19 year old daughter and myself all thought the ones we baked turned out the best by far. (And it's rare when we all agreed on any food/recipe!!) Just make sure you cook the whole 20 minutes and turn after 10 so they get nice and crispy on both sides! The crispier the better. We dipped in a sweet chili sauce we found at Trader Joes and they were to DIE FOR!!!!!!! Served with "Restaurant Style Egg Drop Soup" also from this site. Excellant meal! Thank you so much for a great recipe. We will defintely make these again.

These are ok. I used regular egg rolls paper not spring rolls. Were told they only were used for cold rolls so took that advice. Only thing to do with these rolls are to keep tasting to get to the seasoning you like. The chile sauce I love in this recipe. So just note it was a time rolling them but I froze the rest for a later date but I enjoyed them :)

These are great!  Couldn't find any spring roll wrappers so used filo dough (found in freezer section next to frozen pie crusts).  Split filo dough in 1/2 and worked great!  Used ground chicken instead of pork and used cole slaw mix with extra carrots, also added bell peppers.  Ate with spicy mustard and duck sauce.  Delicious!

These were amazing.  One of those recipes you can clean out your fridge with.  - used cooked shrimp, lettuce, peppers, etc.  I have made this a number of times always changing the vegetables - never have used pork - and they always taste great.  I have three picky eaters and they love these.  This is one recipe I always make sure I have close by.  I followed some other reviews - using soya sauce and hoison sauce, didn't use oyster.  I don't think anyone could blow this one.  Great way for kids to eat veggies.

I think my expectations for these were too high, considering it was my first attempt at spring rolls. But the filling smelled soooo good while I was making the rolls! These were pretty tasty. Definitely better than most of the Chinese restaurants around here (unfortunately). I made 24 (because the string roll wrappers came in packs of 24) and froze most of them. The reheat nicely! (45 seconds in the microwave and then 15 minutes in the oven to crisp up. Yummy.

I love using rice paper and I was very happy with this recipe. The only change I made was to double the amount of liquid ingredients (oyster sauce, etc.) for more spice and flavor.  I served them with a sauce of soy sauce, sesame oil, peanut butter, brown sugar, rice vinegar and chile paste (mixed a bit at a time until it suited my taste).

This was tasty. I need to find better wrappers but the filling is great. I used coleslaw mix instead of cabbage and carrots to cut down on the prep time. I didn't use any cilantro - don't really care for that flavor. I just used plain water to seal the wrappers. I did flip the spring rolls half way through baking and put it on broil for a short time at the end. Warmed the leftovers up in our toaster oven. Yum!

This recipe was very easy.  I went to the our local Asian store to get the Spring Roll Wraps and I really enjoyed working with them.  I made this recipe early in the day and rolled them.  I placed them in a rigid Ziplock container as I was needing to transport them for several hours.  I didn't want them to stick together (during transport) so I sprayed them all with Pam and layered with parchment.  They took the trip very well.  They were a "bit" soft in the center portion but it was no big deal.  Flavor was great and I love the variations that people been submitting.  I will definitely be keeping Spring Roll Wraps in the freezer to have on hand.  My daughter who is an Asian food junkie loved these so I know they will be made lots.  I think I will even make up a batch of the filling to have in the freezer to have on hand for those munchie nights. Might even try freezing some to see how they hold up.

I made these for a party, and EVERYONE LOVED THEM. They are quite simply the best party food ever. I made two batches also, one with pork, and one with sauteed/spiced tofu. Both were equally delicious and you really can't tell that they aren't from a restaraunt. I've made these plenty of times since that party. 
P.S. These are PERFECT drunk food.

Great recipe.  Because I like a very spicy and stronger flavor, I almost doubled the seasonings and used ground turkey  seasoned with approx. 1 tblsp. soy sauce instead. Didn't have any cilantro on hand, so left it out. Still came out very tasty, golden & crispy - without the extra calories since it's baked and not deep fried!

I love these.  They are pretty simple to make along with a ramen stir fry.  They are more like low-fat eggrolls, instead of spring rolls, which I think of as cold food items.

I did not have a few items on hand (oyster sauce, cilantro, chili sauce) and they still turned out great.  

I will make these again, definitely.

Good, but not as authentic tasting as I had hoped.  I added more veggies, and 1 tbl. soy sauce to the mixture.  The rolls stuck to the bottom of the pan, so I would recommend using cooking spray on it first.  Definitely turn halfway through baking.  Serve with sweet and sour sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were really, really awesome!  My husband and I loved them.  I of course added extra garlic and chili garlic sauce (always do), added a few shakes of soy sauce and didn't really measure any of the ingredients other than the pork and the cabbage (with a little extra thrown in for good measure).  I also used eggroll wrappers since that's what they had where I was shopping that day.  My only complaint was that when I tried to turn them after 10 minutes a few of them stuck and part of the wrapper pulled away, but it was no big deal.  The taste was still fabulous.  We were amazed at how crispy they were without having to fry them.  I managed to get 14 really nice, full eggrolls out of the recipe.  These were really good and easy and are definitely going to become a staple at our house.  I'm thinking of flash freezing a bunch before the baking stage so I can have them ready to thaw and bake at a later date.  I just hate having to wait for them to thaw.  Anyone have any ideas on that one?

The outcome was fantastic, but the presentation was difficult. When they say to brush the vegetable oil they didn’t indicate both sides, so the bottom stuck to the pan. Nonetheless it tasted fantastic

Made the recipe as is except substituted chicken for the port.  The flavor was wonderful, although  I had an issue with the wrappers sticking to the pan which I think I can fix using a baking stone instead of a cookie sheet.

Round wrappers worked just fine for this as well.

Perfect! I used fish sauce just because I had no oyster sauce at the moment. Still great.

I love this recipe and so does everyone that tastes it. I like it a bit spicier so I add more chile sauce. The only issue I have had is that I cannot get it to look like the picture - crispy and brown. Mine remain translucent. Any suggestions for getting them to look more like the picture?

I have made these twice.  The first time I used egg roll wrappers because that is what most of the pictures are using.  Spring roll wrappers are very thin and brittle, they have to be softened in warm water for about 20 seconds.  The ones I bought are about 10 inches and round.  Egg roll are usually rectangular and wonton wrappers are small circlers.  They are both more doughy/soft than spring roll paper so they are more pliable.   Both the wrappers work for the recipe, so use whatever you like or can find.   I like this recipe.  You can substitute ground turkey for pork and soy sauce for oyster sauce.  I skip the cilantro.

This is excellent. I actually had some ground turkey that I wanted to use up so I used that instead and it was still so good. I used coleslaw mix too! I also didn't have green onion and I omitted the cilantro (the husband doesn't like it). I think that I would have enjoyed the cilantro but I can see how it would overpower this if you don't LOVE it. I brushed them with oil after flipping. The only thing that I noticed happening was where I had moistened it with the cornstarch became thin when baking and some of the filling came through. But I probably over-filled them :)

They were great!  The only critical part in making these is soaking the wrapper for the exact time before putting in the filling.  Not enough time and the wrappers are tough, and too long and they rip.  Just a matter of practice.

Soooo disappointed.  I was wanting to L O V E these, but it didn't happen.  I'm not reflecting the wrapper problem (Nasoya brand) in the review, only the filling. That opinion is mostly from the wrapper side of things.  They came out overly crispy at 425 (wrapper pkg said 400 btw) & somehow stale - eventhough crispy.  Filling: Ho-hum with ginger.  I followed the recipe except used a little less garlic since I had garlic chile sauce.  Pkg said to cook filling first.  I cooked the pork, just didn't cook longer after adding additional ingredients.  One T filling isn't enough.  :/  I don't know why I didn't like these more.  I love the idea.  I wanted to.  :(

Well I obviously did something wrong when it came to the baking, because mine did not look like the pictures! None of them really baked up very well and they got stuck to the pan so I could flip them halfway through. I greased the pan, too. Maybe need to go for something a little more die hard and greasing with EVOO.

The key to these is in the wrapper. Too thick and they don't taste right. Get a thin wrapper and you won't be sorry. These were OK but I still prefer mine deep fried.

I like the flavour of the filling although I think it should be egg roll wrappers instead? There are so many kinds of spring roll wrappers. i used the Vietnamese rice wrappers and then baked it. Stuck fiercely to the baking pan! Should have known... Next time, I will use a different wrapper for sure.

Fun to make.  I suggest doubling the recipe as it is still a lot of work. You could even make a party of it, like they do in China with dumplings.  You can pretty much put anything you like in the filling.  I like to use chopped shrimp for some and shitake mushrooms.  I love cilantro, so I don't find the amount overwhelming, but if you do, you can vary it. I like the idea of adding more wet ingredients, as they can be a bit dry. I think they might freeze well also.

My husband gave these a five. I loved the filling and they did turn out crispy. I found that the texture of wrap was slightly papery. I did take suggestion of using cole slaw mix which makes this doable in a shorter amount of time. I think I will make this again for a party. Tasty and healthier than frying!

These turned out great! I love Spring Rolls, but hate frying stuff. The beauty of this recipe is that they actually do taste like they were fried. Crispy but not heavy. I doubled the recipe. Used ground Ginger, because I didn't have fresh. Used the suggested cole slaw mix and came up with 24 egg rolls. I froze most of them so we can have for later. Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe. This is a keeper for sure!

Here's a no-bake vegetarian option:
My kids love these but I make them quite differently and they take about a third of the time.
Use broccoli slaw or some other julienned vegetable mix from the grocery store. 
Use rice paper wrappers that you wet and then roll, do not need cornstarch, and do not need to be baked at all.
If you used a packaged vegetable slaw and frozen cilantro (same amount), you will want to double the sesame oil, oyster sauce and minced garlic. If using powdered ginger use only 1/2 teaspoon in place of 2 tsp fresh. Serve these with peanut dipping sauce or soy sauce. They are so good and keep well in the fridge for a couple of days.
Don't try to bake the rice paper wrappers, they will fall apart.

These were delicious! My only mistake was I think I cooked a full pound of ground pork and they were very meaty.  Today I am going to make them again trying to use the right amount of pork this time.  One of my friends said they were better than the ones served at the sushi place in our city!!  I did add some crushed garlic, soya sauce, ginger and sesame oil to the meat while frying it.  And left out the chile, but I will be adding it today to try it.  Overall, these were so delicious! OH! I also used RICE PAPER WRAPS instead of spring rolls wrappers (the won ton kind) and they were soooooooo yummy!!

These were just okay.  I did some as suggested by baking and one batch I fried.  We both preferred the fried version.  The baked ones were actually surprisingly crisper but not in a good way.  The texture was off, it was like a paper thinness and just crunch, no flavour.

These baked pork spring rolls were excellent and very easy to make. I made them for a neighborhood progressive party - I was in charge of appetizers. The spring rolls were very popular and disappeared quickly. I love the fact that they are baked and not fried.

I did not care for this recipe.  The filling tasted like that of a spring roll, but was very bland. The baking time was too long as mine came out burnt on the edges making for a crunchy shell with little "chew" to it. I like the combination of crunchy and chewey when it comes to eggrolls. Unfortunately I think baking them has missed the mark and might have to go with the unhealthy way of frying them so that they keep their flavor. Not at all impressed by this!

A big hit with the whole family! My 20 month old devoured 2 of them.

I was disappointed in these. The flavor was not bad, but the baking time was too long. They ended up over brown/crisp and the filling was dried out and skimpy. If I had to do over again, I would double the veggies and bake them for a shorter time.

These were good - definitely didn't miss the frying.  They did get dark very quickly though so keep an eye on them.  I'll use this method going forward with different fillings as well.

great recipe. We LOVED that these are much more "guilt free" because they are baked! we just don't do fried food in our house.  I made them vegetarian, but I'm sure they would be good with ground pork or even ground turkey too.   I doubled (and next time would even triple) the cabbage mixture since I was not including the meat.  I also used the egg roll wrappers...next time I'll be sure to find SPRING roll wrappers to help with the crisping in the oven.  We'll definitely make these treats again!

This recipe is nothing short of amazing. What I love about it is its versatility, namely that you can change up the filling (as other reviewers attest) and it still turns out great. I also love that no frying is involved, and they come out really crispy. No changes, seriously. The only thing I do different for my personal preference is brush the spring rolls with sesame oil instead of vegetable oil because it adds flavor and is healthier. A keeper! Try it.

My newly married brother was looking for some side dish ideas and I found this one looking for him. I tried them just now, but with chicken (store was out of ground pork...need to shop earlier in the day), slaw mix (make it easy and fast so I could let him know how they were), and egg roll wrappers because my local store doesn't carry spring roll wrappers. I have to say, these were great!! I have a whole bunch frozen because I purposely doubled the recipe. Also I love spicy food, so I added extra chili sauce. Thanks so much for this recipe. It didn't take me long at all and it tastes great. Not to mention I have something easy to take to work with me now for something different (work fast food right now...hello potato oven)

YUM! I love the fact that these spring rolls still had that nice crunch even without being deep-fryed. My filling was a combination of chicken, pork, and shrimp and rather than using lettuce and carrots, I used a bag of coleslaw. To save time, I used a food processor to gring up everything. This was my first experience making spring rolls and I struggled with the wrappers a little bit because they kept breaking even though I followed the instructions. I found it much easier when I filled a pie pan with lukewarm water and added a bit of cornstarch. After dipping the wrapper on both sides for a couple seconds it was much easier to fold.

I have been making these rolls for several years now. I love them and so does everyone else that I have ever made them for. I do make some changes though. I add more oyster sauce. I also add softened Saifun noodles, chopped up. I do deep fry mine. When I am ready to serve them I make a sauce made with 1/2c lemon juice, 1/3c soy sauce, 1t chili sauce, one chopped green onion and 1t chopped cilantro. Dip you spring roll in that and OH MY GOSH are they good!!! This is no doubt one of my most favorite recipes from Allrecipes.com.

Delicious!  We don't eat pork so I used ground turkey.  The combination of flavors is wonderful.  I quadruple the recipe and freeze the extras. The teenagers are willing to help if it means they get to eat them!

Pretty darn good :) As another reviewer suggested I replaced half the chicken with rice vermicelli and added 1 tbsp soya sauce. Cooked it all briefly on a low fire.I ended up eating leftover filling by itself, which I must say would make an excellent starter or salad to a Asian meal.

Never made spring rolls or egg rolls before, but this was an easy recipe. I didn't really follow it exactly. I did mince onions and cooked it with the pork, along with the ginger and the garlic. While cooking the pork, I after draining the oil, I added some sesame oil and soy sauce for a few minutes.I may go easy on the ginger next time....a little less would have been better. I also added some green onions instead of cilantro, since I didn't have any. For those of you who live in Vancouver,B.C., T&T superstore has spring roll paper in the freezer. I followed others in broiling the last 10 mins. Turned out great....! Now if only I can find a good dipping sauce....

The recipe is good... however... it doesn't say to warm the spring roll wrappers in warm water before wrapping!!! This is key information. I had to read another review to figure it out.

This recipe was great! I made the following changes: Instead of using pork I used cooked chicken and shrimp to make two different kinds of spring rolls.
I also used soya sauce instead of oyster sauce. I doubled the amount of sesame oil and soya sauce.  I had fillo dough in my freezer so I defrosted it and used it instead of spring roll wrappers. Cut the dough into 5"x5" sqaures.  Take one square, brush with melted butter. Place another square on top, brush with butter. Add 1 tablespoon of filling then fold sides toward the middle and ends toward the middle. Use constarch paste to seal seams and brush spring roll with butter before placing on greased baking pan.  Turned out excellent, would make this again!!

Wow, these spring rolls turned out better than expected!  To speed up the process I used prepackaged cole slaw mix and for a kick I added extra chili sauce.  I also added a few pinches of sugar to give the rolls a sweet and spicy taste.  Spring roll wrappers were not available at my local grocery store but they did have egg roll wrappers in the produce section which I used instead.  During baking I turned the rolls after about 10 minutes and then reset the timer for another 10 minutes but after about 6-7 minutes they were ready.  I served the rolls with store bought duck sauce.  I can't wait to make these again.

I looked in two different markets for the spring roll wrappers, but couldn't find them so I had to use the egg roll wrappers which ended up being chewy and tough. The filling is fantastic though and I will make these again ONLY if I have the spring roll wrappers.

These were excellent!  Even my husband liked them and he's not much of a veggie person.  I would definatly go with the spring roll wrappers instead of the normal egg roll wrappers- it does make a difference!  I also had to use ground ginger as I didn't have any fresh ginger on hand, but they still turned out great!

The stuffing for these is GREAT! Tastes very authentic thai. I used the spring roll wrappers that are round and must be soaked, and I wonder if that caused a bit of a problem I experienced. They didn't really crisp up as much as I had liked, and they also stuck to the pan really bad - some broke apart when I pulled them off. But the taste was magnificent, and my boyfriend devoured these. I served with bottled Peanut Chile sauce and also Sweet Chile sauce. You could make your own from this site, or buy it bottled at the store. I'll try these with egg-roll wrappers since they seem to be easier to find.

I made this for my son's b-day 2 days ago.      I triple the recipe.  Everyone liked it.  My sister asked where I bought it from.  She was surprised that I made it since she is the one who cooks the best between the two of us. But eat them while hot, when they get cold, it's a bit chewy.  thanks for the great recipe!

I really liked these, but I think they will be even better as I use the recipe more. I couldn't find Spring Roll wrappers, so I used Wonton Wrappers. I also wasn't sure how full to fill them. Since I finally found Spring Roll wrappers, I will use those next time. The flavor was exceptional though and I found that they froze well.

Excellent.  Full of flavor.  Doubled the recipe and made 13 bigger rolls, used shrimp instead of pork and coarsely chopped before mixing with other filling ingredients.  I used round spring roll skins and soaked them before wrapping around filling.  I think I will try to find the square ones that don't need soaked next time so the spring rolls will get crispy.

This recipe was excellent and I was pleasantly surprised that baking them still made them taste delicious.  I didn't really measure anything - just cooked about 1 lb of pork, added the coleslaw mix and gr onions then the rest (I too substituted hoisin for oyster sauce).  Don't make these too moist or your wrapper will get wet.  These even bake up nice the second time around.  Definitely a keeper!

These are easy and very good! You can always add more chili sauce and ginger root. I usually roll these, bake and and then refrigerate overnight...then the next day I just warm them up in the oven. I serve with soy sauce plus chili sauce, hot mustard, and pickled ginger. They are gone in seconds!

PLEASE try this one - the meat mixture is so delicious! Only necessary change was to deep-fry instead of bake.  I know it's better not to fry, but come - on, they're spring rolls!!!  It really does make the difference.

The wrappers become chewy and crunchy no matter what you do.  Only way to eat them was warm before they hardened and then you were eating an atomic fireball.  Just don't bake them

They were a little dry and needed a bit more spice, but other than that they tasted really good. We served it with homemade sweet and sour sauce- once you got enough sauce on, you can't really tell it's dry.

These were very good.  My husband said they reminded him of the ones his mom used to make.  I suggest you add more of the liquid ingredients (oyster sauce, etc) because they can be a little dry.

These were very dry and bland. I did as other reviewers, and sprayed with cooking spray. Perhaps because I used eggroll wraps instead of springroll wraps??

Wow!--made these for the Super Bowl. Added red pepper flakes to about half of the rolls. For some, cooked shredded chicken (instead of pork) in the sesame oil, then added to the usual mixture. Used the angel hair cole slaw mix. I have also, in the past, used a pack of ramen noodles (cooked as directed) and added to the usual cabbage mixture as well--sprinkled the seasoning pack over the mixture when I was out of oyster sauce and chile sauce--not as fantastic, but it works. 
This is truly a great recipe as written--but it is versatile to any taste.

These were really good! I used shredded turkey (like an imitation ham), and added extra carrots and cabbage. I made 18 rolls, using about 3 tablespoons per roll. Served them at the New Years Eve party and they were a huge hit! I've made these many times since, playing with different amounts of spices and veggies... and we're always looking for an excuse to make them again. Thanks alot Rayna!

I made these for a holiday party I attended last night. One hint to anyone who makes this recipe - make sure to grab a couple before you set them out on the appetizer table. They disappear very quickly. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used packaged cole slaw mix. That saved a lot of time. I also added more oyster sauce than the recipe called for. I will definitely be making these again very soon!

These were the hit of my party.  I now have to make them for a New Year's party.  To save some time, I bought prepackaged shredded cabbage and carrots, aka cole slaw mix.  They were absolutely delicious.

These are great.  Deep fried them but used too high of a temperature (close to 500) so the centers were still cool.  Prepared them the night before which saved time during the party.  Will do again but will lower oil temp. to around 375.

This is one of the best spring roll recipes I have ever found.  Really great because you bake them.  I do turn them after 10 minutes so they are brown on both sides.  Made them last weekend for the holiday and again tomorrow for a graduation party.  Always a big hit.

I served them with a spicy Thai dipping sauce. I love the fact that these were crispy without having to deep fry!

I made two batches, one where I accidently doubled the garlic and chile sauce and the other just as is...turns out my family preferred the spicer one...the original recipe is a bit bland...but kudos on how easy it is to whip up and modify.  I'm making them for my office this year.  Thx!

Great recipe. I added one teaspoon of soy sauce and for Chile sauce I added sriracha. The one thing I would play around with next time is temperature of the oven. I think a lower temperature setting might be better because i took it a few minutes early or it would get more burnt.

The baking method worked out wonderfully.  We love the crisp exterior of the egg rolls.  I  filled each egg roll with 1/4 of the flavorful mixture, a tablespoon of the mixture just seemed too small.

Love this and its my go to mix. I wrap it in rice paper wrappers to make it gluten free. I dont cook the wrappers though because they fall apart. We mix sweet chili sauce into the mix for a little extra kick.

Made shrimp and made pork, both equally delicious!!  I did use the wrong kind of wrapper which was bad.  These were easy to make and even my husband who doesn't like Spring Rolls loved them.

Pretty good for something different--very fun to make!  I used egg roll wrappers instead of spring roll wrappers--I don't know if there is a difference or not.  They came out a little tough but had a good flavor.  I used Panda Orange Sauce for dipping.  Try them!

About the most misguiding recipe I have tried. From reading all the other realistic reviews, yes, egg roll wrappers would have been the right ones to use. The spring roll wrappers stuck to the foil and wouldn't come off. Using parchment paper did no better. And the result looking nothing like the picture at all. Wrong wrappers. the lack of instructions of how to use spring roll paper should have tipped me off to that.

Flavor was good, but the executional instructions and one wrong ingredient is where this recipe goes to die. I am a professional cook. I followed this to the letter, and it failed. Absolutely do not recommend.

These were easy to make and very delicious.  My only change: omitting the cilantro because I can't stand the taste.  Oh, and I did make these with various other proteins - smoked tofu, ground chicken - and it worked equally well.  Just be sure to dice the tofu very finely.

The idea is great to bake instead of deep fry. It gives same crispness but save all the disadvantages of deep fry. Added to that, I now usually prepare 2-4 dozens a time because the wrap I buy is 2-dz a pack. Keep them in freezer. Then just bake the amount I want to eat at a time, even only 2-3 for afternoon snack. Much much more convenient & healthy.
I use a variety of filling. For savoury, I use yam/raddish/cabbage/potato, various mushroom, chicken/pork/shrimp, carrot......
I even made with my leftover chicken pie filling.
I also made sweet rolls with banana, chocolate chips, chopped nuts & season with cinnamon & coconut sugar.
I am thinking of using sweet potato/pumpkin with nuts & cheese, fry glutinous rice......It's fun.....haha!!
Thanks a lot for the sharing

Will try for sure.  I usually never make changes the first time I try, and I can tell by the ingredients they will be awesome.
It is very good with red pepper jelly.

Honestly, I was so exited for these. When I attempted to pull them of the tray they stuck and were served as "deconstructed" spring rolls. I served these with general  tso's chicken and the flavors were great.

Bland, I used taco shells instead of spring roll wrappers but the suggested 1 Tbsp filling was laughable for those approximately 6" round shells.  I put about 3 Tbsp and could've jammed 1-2 more in.  

Besides that, the flavoring was really poor, it was very bland, no flavor,  I ended up dousing my 'egg rolls' with soy sauce.  I tripled the ingredients and have about 1/2 left after making 10 rolls.  I doubled the oyster sauce and it is still really bland.  I'm experimenting with adding more oyster sauce, soy, and clam juice to give it flavor.

Basting the shells in oil none of them stuck to my pan after about 20-30 minutes at suggested heat.

Recipe is a good basic start but before I made them the mixture was really clearly too 'dry'.  I taste tested the mixture prior to cooking and it was bland but I gave it a go.  My concern was proven after cooking and seeing they came out so plain and flavorless.

These spring rolls are excellent! I was surprised at how crispy they became in the oven instead of deep fat frying them. I didn't have all the vegetables listed on hand, so I used the ground pork with chopped ginger, mushrooms, onions, and green peppers. They even taste good cold.

Made these following the recipe and didn't care for them baked. The wrapper had an unusual texture and it wasn't as good as having them fried. The filling was tasty but next time I will definitely fry them. Dissapointed

Couldn't find spring roll wrappers in my store. Only egg roll wrappers, gyoza and won ton wrappers so I used the egg roll wrappers. I filled them full because they are bigger than spring roll wrappers. 
Crispy and very tasty! A bit too much ginger and I'll cut back on the chili sauce too but this has become my go to 'Roll' recipe. It's pretty easy and you can use different meats too.  Thank you Rayna for a great recipe!

Great recipe! A question for the community, mine come out translucent and not as crispy as expected, quite different than the photo in th recipe. Any suggestions?

I really liked these,hubby not so much . I think I might have used to much cornstarch mixture to seal the edges. Next time I will  use just the water to seal the edges.

Didn't make any changes.  Hubby and I loved them.  Didn't turn out as pretty as the picture, but tasted great.  Will make them again.

I didn't make any changes.  I did serve it with a sweet chili and sesame oil dipping oil.  They are better fried than baked, but you gotta keep those fat calories down where you can.

Incredible - such a good and easy recipe.  I can't cook and I was able to make this wonderfully.  I used ground lean turkey and I used a whole 1 lb. of meat instead of the 1/2 lb. it calls for. I used about 1.5 C of cabbage and 1 C of carrots.  I just about doubled everything, including sauce.  I added an entire handful to each roll and then rolled them.  I skipped the cilantro and didn't use it. They were good sized and filled up my family. I double-layered my wraps (helped them be super duper crunchy) and I dipped them in sweet chili sauce.  They were spectacular and I will definitely be making these again! I'm thrilled with this recipe.  Easy - cheap - healthy - and good!

Absolutely delicious! I only made a few minor changes to make it a tad healthier. Instead of ground pork I used ground turkey and I swapped the cabbage for spinach. Oh and I didn't have oyster sauce so I just used soy sauce and can't believe how good these are! Paired so nicely with my homemade wonton soup :)

I have made these as written and they were great.  Possible tips:
Let them sit for at least 15 minutes before baking, I have found sealing the rice papers with the starch was unnecessary, I used a meatball scoop to fill the paper, I had my husband chop everything first (that makes a real timesaver for me).

Awesome recipe. To make it easier I doubled everything and  used a 14 oz bag of coleslaw mix with cabbage and carrots. Use two tablespoon for filling in 10 inch lumping rolls (30ct). Also cooked about an extra 5 to 10 minutes as they tended to get a bit soggy after they cooled without the extra time.

Great flavor and crunch.  So much healthier to have a baked roll instead of fried.  The spring roll wrappers from our nearby Asian market were a little hard to work with for beginners.  The rolls stuck to our teeth; I'd use egg roll wrappers next time.  We eliminated the oyster sauce (due to shellfish allergy) and cilantro and they came out fine.

I really liked the baking instructions.  I used shrimp instead of pork, bok choy, some bean noodles, parsely instead of cilantro and no oyster sauce.  I served them with Hot Sweet and Sour sauce.  You can sub with what you like.  My friends,husband, and self all loved them.

You can replace the port with some salad shrimp (cooked, 80-120 count or 100-200 count).

I used egg roll wrappers and they came out excellent.

Made twice now. Once with pork and once with chicken. I used left over grilled pork chop and left over grilled chicken breast. I used my Vitamix to shred up the meat and all the vegies. Worked like a charm. Followed rest of ingredients. I did use Egg Roll Wrappers and deep fried. My friends and family all loved these and my husband says the best he's ever had. We used a store bought sweet and sour sauce for dipping. You won't be sorry!!!

These were really easy and so good.  I used Hoisin sauce instead of Oyster sauce and they were fantastic.  My husband thought they were better than the traditional fried in a pan kind.  This is a keeper.  Thank you!

Love this recipe.. First tried it with pork and have to admit that i did fry and not bake but they were soo good... everyone ate them up.. 

Made them today for hubby's bday using ground beef.. I think it was more flavorful with the pork but i tend to add a lil extra spices here and there and that could have been the problem too.. couldnt remember what i put in the first time.. haha.. but still a big hit!!!

Very good, I used ground turkey instead of pork. For the cabbage I used a bag of Asian salad I got at Costco. When all ingredients were mixed in the bowl, the mixture did not seem wet enough, so I added some of the sesame dressing that came with the salad. They came out great, I may have used too much meat, next time I will use less meat and add more cabbage. Didn't miss the fried part at all, Thank for the recipe!

I adapted this recipe to be vegetarian by leaving out the pork and added a bit more other ingredients. I also added some mushrooms and super thin rice noodles (cellophane noodles) to the recipe. I found the filling had a nice flavor. However I didn't really enjoy these baked at all. Also the person gave no instructions on wrapping so I fumbled around until I realized I needed to start by putting the spring roll wrappers in a diamond shape.  The paste I was told to make caused a white powdery-ness on the wrappers where I sealed them, I didn't enjoy that.   Additionally despite adding the oil.... these were really dry and too hard and chewy. They lacked the pert crispness of fried spring rolls. I have another batch to make and I may brush them more generously with the oil to see if I can make it work for me.   One last thing... the recipe never mentions that its absolutely required to keep spring roll wrappers damp. Once they dry out the texture changes and cooking them one change that at all. I kept mine covered with a damp towel while I was rolling the next one up.  Also, even though I love cilantro... I didn't think it belonged in the recipe. I did add it anyway but next time I'd omit it for sure if I tried this recipe again.

They were easier to make than I expected. The spring roll pastry I used was really easy to work with (Spring Home TYJ SPring Roll Pastry). I found it at our local asian market. They were spicier than I am used to from Chinese restaurants so I may not add the chili sauce next time. I used bean sprouts instead of cabbage to make it easier but I'm sure the cabbage would have been better though I don't feel they suffered because of it. I made the sauce suggested by another reviewer (1/2 C. lemon juice, 1/3 c. soy sauce, 1 t. chili sauce. one chopped green onion and 1 t. chopped cilantro). Yummy but spicy. Duck sauce was Ok with it. Will make again.

The filling was really great - but I would suggest using spring roll wrappers instead of egg roll wrappers - my grocery store only had egg roll and the wrappers were bland. Also it is quite meaty so if you like a lighter roll then I would suggest halfing the pork.

I thought these were good, but not great. The wrapper just didn't taste right, not like it does when I fry them.

These are the best ever, much more like empress rolls. No need to fry, bakes crisp and easy. Freezes well too! Use water and cornstarch mixed and dip your fingers in it then wet the edges just before you roll each wrapper.

To make 15 egg rolls (which is the number of wraps in one package) I used one whole bag of Dole Cole Slaw mix, plus about a cup of matchstick carrots and 1.25 lbs of ground pork.   Then I use a kind of full 1/4 cup measure in each egg roll.  The oyster sauce is a must!  And extra fresh ginger and fresh garlic.  I used the Egg Roll Wraps from the grocery store.  Sprayed just the one side with Crisco butter spray lightly  before putting in the oven at 425 degrees and turned after 10 minutes like it says.   Did not re-spray.

I thought this recipe was good if a bit bland.  I like to add some lime juice and hoisin to round out the flavours a bit.  I accidentally bought egg roll wrappers instead of spring roll~If you make this mistake do not try to bake them, they will not turn out.  I tested a couple and they weren't good.  I fried the rest and they were delicious.  I also cook down my cabbage with the pork mixture to make them easier to wrap.  They stayed together very well, my husband even complimented me on how good they looked.  Served with Thai Sweet Chili sauce-Yum,

I am Chinese, so I've had my share of spring rolls.  But I never tried making them until I found this recipe.  These are so good.  The best part is that you don't have to follow the recipe exactly and can put whatever and however much you want.  You should try this with fish sauce--makes it even better.

I used ground turkey instead of pork. The end result would have been great, except I took the advice of one of the reviews and put the oven on "broil" for the last 2 minutes to make them crispy. Unfortunately I should have kept on eye on them, smoke started coming out of the oven and half of them were black like burnt marshmallows. If you do use the broiler, definitely keep a close watch! I would make this again when I have time, the prep is consuming.

This is excellent!..I have already made it twiece and it has been great each time. I followed the suggestions of one the members here and I used cole slaw to save time. The result was fantactic. I also ommitted the chilli as my husband doesnt like it. And I added more sesame oil to make the mix more moisture. It was great. Will definately make it over and over again!

It doesn't make sense how good these are. During the filling/wrapping process I thought this was too time-consuming BUT after the first one I was hooked. Will cut back on the chili next time. Used shrimp instead of pork. Great recipe..thanks.

The spring rolls were crisp and crunchy - just the way I like it, but the insides lacked flavor and were too dense.  I modified the recipe somewhat so I can't say if my disappointment was a result of my changes or the recipe.  I will make these again and use chicken instead of shrimp, and less cabbage.

I made this So easy!  I didn't change a thing.  I brought it to a Memorial Day get-together, and everyone wanted the recipe.  I went to an asian grocery store to get the spring roll wrappers.  They had 2 sizes of wrappers, so I tried them both.  It was much easier to wrap using the larger wrappers.  One can either serve the larger, or cut in half for more of a appetizer size.

Filling has excellent flavor, but by baking these egg rolls, the skins are a bit chewy.  But because I am pretty health conscience,  I will make these over the fried version any day.

These are excellent and I will add them to my favorites.  I chopped shrimp vs using the pork as my wife is vegetarian.  I probably will play with the filling next time too, and add bean sprouts and maybe mushrooms.  Definitely many combinations out there, so try them out.  Of course, I will also do a 1/2 batch using pork for myself!!

I used thinly sliced pork chops browned in sesame oil and cole slaw mix.  I also added red onion and diced zucchini.  You could really use almost any vegetable and this would turn out great.

These were really good!  I used ground turkey instead of pork and omitted the ginger root.  I also could not find spring roll wrappers so I used egg roll wrappers instead.  I didn't brush them with vegetable oil either.  I just lightly sprayed cooking spray on top.  So much lighter and tastier than the typical fried egg roll.

These were so good!  

I would highly recommend Little Chef Frozen Spring Roll Pastry wrappers (for all purpose) from Cub Foods.  These wrappers were very easy to work with and turned out very crispy.  As everyone has been saying, this is a great recipe for using up vegetables in your fridge.  And make sure to taste as you mix to get the best level of spice/flavor!  I've even thought about using radical ingredients like sausage and olives.

My boyfriend & I both LOVED these.  I added a little more oyster sauce & chile sauce since we are such big fans of the 2.  I also always double the recipe so that I don't have leftover wrappers sitting in my fridge w/ no use.  Great w/ jasmine rice to complete the meal.  Would definitely recommend!

These get 5 stars in the appearance category.  I thought it was a great idea to bake instead of fry.  My husband thought they were okay.  But to me, the baked pastry wrapper tasted more like some kind of cracker than the skin on the deep fried variety. Next time I'll fry instead.  Other than that the recipe is fine.  Thanks for the inspiration.

Very good! I increased to 50 servings, reduced the amount of pork to 1/4th of the called for amount, added in 1 box of tofu instead, and omitted the cilantro because I didn't have any on hand. I took the suggestion of 1 reviewer, and added some 5-spice powder to the pork, doubled the oyster sauce, added a dash of salt & soy sauce. I didn't have a problem with dryness because i added the tofu. Only thing is that I ended up making only about 40 rolls because I ran out of filling. I'll add some extra veggies next time. Really yum!

Great recipe and I also, used premade coleslaw mix. I made these 'cause I'm on a tight budget and was trying to create something that would freeze well, taste good, and be easy to heat up. This was perfect. Thanks!

I only followed the baking method to use with yakimandu. I love asian food, but a lot of it is so fattening that I don't get to enjoy it as often. Thank you so much for the chance to 'have my cake and eat it too' awesome recipe.

This was very good but needed a little more spice in my opinion.  The only thing I changed was to add some mushrooms. Next time i will play around with the amount of spices.

These were awesome! I used 1/4 pound of finely sliced pork left over from New Year's dinner and 1/4 pound of diced mushrooms. I left out the cilantro because I didn't have any but left everything the same. I got 20 rolls from this recipe, and they were delicious. I accidentally baked these for 20 minutes at 350, and they still came out fine.

Like other reviewers, I used pre-bagged cole slaw mix in place of the carrots and cabbage, which worked very well. I also put in extra chili sauce and some soy sauce. I had never used spring roll wrappers before, but they were easy to work with so don't be intimidated. I served them with the "Oriental dipping sauce" found on Allrecipes. Would be great for entertaining! PS - this recipe made only 5 rolls - they were probably a bit bigger than they should have been, but I definitely don't think the recipe could yield 12 spring rolls. I would definitely make again.

These were the best!  I quadrupled the recipe so I could freeze these for a Christmas get together coming up.  The smell was amazing and they tasted even better than they smelled.  I like the bite from the chile paste.  I too, used a 1 lb. package of fine cut coleslaw mix and it worked perfectly. I ate 4 or 5 of them before they cooled and its a good thing I did freeze them otherwise I'd be making more tomorrow.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Wow! This is the first time I've tried spring rolls.  I bought 4" wrappers by mistake so they dried out a bit quickly, but I found the were easy to use--a gentle touch is all that's required.  My husband and I demolished the cookie sheet full in about 20 minutes! I froze a bunch as well.  Thank you for the recipe!

WOW WOW WOW! My husband and I loved these....so much better than at a restaurant, and so much cheaper!  They were a bit more work than I expected, so if you are not used to this type of cooking, leave a little extra time.  But so worth the effort!  Will definitely make again.  I cut back on the cilantro,,just not a big fan of it, and added a little more chile sauce.  So good!!!  Thank you Rayna.

This was very tasty, and definitely easy to make.  The rolls were wonderfully crispy, like the traditional fried rolls, but without the fuss of frying.  The only thing that kept this from receiving a 5 star rating was the filling; it was very good, but not quite excellent.  Still, until I find just the right filling, I will definitely be making these again.  And, this is absolutely the best way to cook the Spring Rolls; easy, lower fat, and terrific texture!

Made these for a birthday party and everyone enjoyed them. I served as an appetiser (cut them in half) with duck sauce. Very easy to make and tasted delicious.  Would add more ginger next time. Will make these again!
