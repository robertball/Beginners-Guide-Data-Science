Original review April '11: Great quick dessert. Mine took a little longer because I made my own caramel sauce but other than that, I followed the recipe exact. I like to use Granny Smith's in my crisps, I had nine smallish ones that were just enough for this crisp. I did add a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the topping at the last minute. I have a Kitchen Aid that I used for the topping, I just threw the dry ingredients in the mixer bowl, then my cubed cold butter and let my wisk attachment "cut" my butter into the dry ingredients. Absolutely divine, used on hand ingredients, was cheap to make and VERY soul-soothing to make/eat. I highly recommend you try making your own caramel sauce.......it really takes your dessert over the top. Edited 10/11: I've gotten several e-mails on how to make homemade caramel sauce. This is how I do mine. Mix a quarter cup of butter, one cup of brown sugar, half cup heavy cream OR evaporated milk (depending on what you have on hand), and a pinch of salt in a saucepan over medium low heat. Cook until thick, about seven minutes. You can usually tell, it looks caramel-y. Add a tablespoon of vanilla and cook another minute longer to thicken just a touch more. Pour into a bowl and let it cool a bit before using.

So easy it should be criminal! Like another reviewer, I made my own caramel sauce, which was also super easy (see below). I bumped the cinnamon to 1t, added a touch of allspice and nutmeg, and 1t vanilla to the apple & caramel mixture. I didn't have quick cooking oats so I just used old-fashioned rolled oats, and they gave a nice texture to the topping. This will be my go-to apple crisp recipe. Thanks so much for sharing!
For the caramel sauce:
Melt 1/2C butter (1 stick) over medium heat, whisk in 1C brown sugar, then whisk in 1/4C milk. When smooth, bring to boil then remove from heat. Yeah, that's all there is to it! :)

Delicious! This is perfect for when you have a dessert craving and need something that's easy to put together with ingredients you have on hand. I used Granny Smith apples and added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts to the "topping" along with a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg for good measure. This smelled wonderful while baking and tasted even better! And, it was fabulous with vanilla ice cream topped with a bit of whipped cream- YUM!

Prepared for the Recipe Group this week. This is very good and my family enjoyed it but it is very sweet! Followed the recipe except increased the servings to 9 to feed my crowd and left the caramel topping at 1/2 cup (it was still a little too sweet for me.) Great contrast of flavors (caramel/apple is one of our favorites) and textures with the crispy topping. I'm sure it will be requested again. Thanks for sharing, Kinza!

This is so easy to make.  I used tart green apples so it was not super sweet.  It was perfect served hot and topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

I only took a microscopic taste of this myself but I could tell from looking over the recipe it was going to be good - and it was, so says Hubs, who was in 7th Heaven eating it.  Other than adding the cinnamon to the topping ingredients rather than  stirring it into the caramel sauce,  I prepared the recipe as written and was quite happy with it just as it stands.  I did, however,  scale this down to two servings (two beautiful Granny Smith apples from hotel lobby) and baked it in a couple of smallish ramekin type baking dishes (350 degrees, about 35 minutes).  This stuff is awesome good - just the right sweetness, crunch and delicate cinnamon flavor.  After all, this is CARAMEL apple crisp, so the caramel taste should prevail.  I can find absolutely nothing to criticize about this recipe, nor recommend any  changes.  Neither can Hubs.

Made for Recipe Group. Let me start by saying I made my own caramel sauce. Added too much milk, wrote the amounts down wrong from the other review. Although it was tasty! And I didn't realize only 1/2 cup of it went into the crisp LOL! Needless to say I had a lot of juice. The topping went into the food processor, then I hand squished it and spread on top. Delightful taste, and next time, I might get the amounts right! Thanks for the recipe.

this was very tasty as I love caramel and apples together, served it with ice cream. It was a little runny the day I made it, but set up better the following day after it had time to cool. Next time I will add a little more oats and sprinkle the bottom of the pan with the oatmeal to soak up some of the juices. It all depends on the type of apple used in this recipe, since I had many apples from our trees, I used those and they are juicy when baked.

This was extremely sweet & watery. Possibly my apples were too juicy? IDK. I'm so sorry, we just didn't care for this particular combo as much as regular apple crisp. It WAS very easy tho :)

The first time I made this I used granny smith apples and followed the recipe exactly and it was very good. The second time I made this I used half bartlett pears (4) and half macintosh apples (4) only because it was what I had on hand, following the rest of the recipe exactly but baked in a 11x7 glass dish and it was absolutely delicious!!

Made this for the *RECIPE GROUP*. I thought it was really good, but I would've liked for caramel flavor- I couldn't taste it at all. All in all very very delicious! Thanks!

I thought this tasted pretty good. I admit I made a lightened up version of this recipe. It had good flavor, but it is "really sweet!" I did think the taste was closer to an apple pie with a sweet and crunchy topping. This would be good with some vanilla ice cream or a little whipped cream as suggested. I thought it was best, just made, before the apples soaked up too much of the caramel syrup.

I followed the recipe as it was given and it turned out perfect.  I wasn't sure about it after reading some of the reviews but if this recipe turns out watery you have done something wrong and I didn't think it was too sweet.  If you like cinnamon I would follow the suggestion to up it to 1 teaspoon.  Thanks for sharing Kinza.  I have been an apple crisp lover but never had a recipe.

was pretty good. would say it was more of a apple crumble than apple crisp. might melt the butter instead of cutting in next time...try that. good flavor. worth making again- but just not excellent.

I made this for Recipe Group using Granny Smith apples and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  I scaled this down to just two servings, but I thought the amount of topping sounded excessive, so I cut it in half, which worked out well for me.  I, too, forgot to mix the cinnamon in with the caramel, so I sprinkled some over the apples and put the rest in the oat topping.  Next time I might try adding some chopped pecans to the topping.

I'm going to first start by saying I didn't follow the directions very well. I forgot to mix the cinnamon with the caramel so I just sprinkled it on top of the apples.  Also, I dumped the oats in with the flour, brown sugar and butter instead of mixing it in after. But it still came out really tasty!  I used Granny Smith apples like other.  Thanks you to DisplacedTexan, another reviewer, for your caramel sauce recipe!  I probably ate half an apple dipped in it.  Luckily I still had enough for the crisp.  This made the kitchen smell wonderful and you can't beat the fact that you only dirty one bowl!

I love how quick and simple this recipe is to make.  My family really enjoyed this dessert warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  I enjoyed the caramel sauce and the crunchy topping, I don't care for cooked apples, which is why I only tried the caramel and topping.  Thanks, Kinza for sharing your recipe.  My family thought this was a perfect fall dessert on a crisp-air kind of night.

After reading some of the reviews, I modified the recipe as follows:
1. I used tart granny smith apples;
2. I used a glass pan and sprayed it with Pam before baking;
3. I dusted flour over the apples and dots of butter as well as the caramel sauce (flour and butter to thicken the juices while it baked);
4. When making the streusel topping I mixed with my hands until crumbly - two knifes don't yield the same results.

The results were to die for - not too sweet, thickened and juicy, tart and delicious. Perfect!

I made my own caramel sauce and, since there was extra, I drizzled it on top after baking. My husband's not usually big on dessert, but went back for seconds on this! Absolutely delicious!

Served this last evening using Dessertlover's Classic Carmel Sauce. Made a double batch and between 5 no left overs. We all really overate, but it was sooo good. I did serve with vanilla icecream and put additional sauce over it all. Used granny smith apples, and had no problem with any excess moisture, in fact with out the icecream it would have been on the dry side. Thanks for sharing this, will be on our table again we liked it so much, and we seldom have desserts.

The first time I made this I was impressed with how easy it was but disappointed because it was so watery.  The second time around a mixed in two tablespoons of flour with the apple muxture and it came out great.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Very good - I cut down on the brown sugar and used a sweeter apple variety...so yummy.  I also used the T. Marzetti apple dip for the caramel topping.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! Doubled recipe and made in a 9x13....my company loved it! I decreased the butter slightly, made no difference. Used gala and cortland apples from the farm.....so good and not watery at all! Served warm with vanilla bean ice cream!

Recipe Group selection of 9/24/11.  This is very sweet made as written.  I used Granny Smith apples so I can't imagine how it would be with a sweet apple or topped with ice cream.  I do like the idea, but just less sweet.  I may try just baking the apples tossed in the caramel sauce with a sprinkle of oatmeal and eliminate any added sugar.  Thanks for something new to try.

I’ve been making the same apple crisp recipe that I love for eons but tried this recipe because it was a Recipe Group selection.  This is a delicious and sweet apple dessert that doesn’t disappoint.  I made the topping in the food processor for ease and speed, just adding the oats in at the very end and pulsing a few times.  The dessert has a wonderful caramel flavor and smells fantastic.  I would recommend using Granny Smith apples with this recipe because it is  very sweet.   Although I still prefer my old standby apple crisp recipe, this was very good and a nice change.

I cut the recipe down to 1 apple for testing purposes and baked it in two mini ramekins. When grabbing the caramel from the frig, I spied some honey apple butter. I added that in a proportion that would be 1/4 cup for the full recipe.
This came out delicious! I'll be making the full recipe in 12 ramekins for Thanksgiving.

I usually never leave a review or comment on something, however, this deserves a lot of praise. Absolutely amazing and delicious, I made the home-made caramel that Sarah Jo posted along with the exact instructions on this recipe. I didn't think it would turn out this great, but it did. I will be making this again in the near future. I added Whipped Cream and Nutmeg on top of it before it was served and that made it taste even better (if that's even possible!)

Received rave reviews and several recipe requests.  I have one of those nifty gadgets that you crank the handle to core, pare and slice the apples effortlessly so prep for this dish was fast and easy and the results were delicious!

Yum! My husband is a diabetic so I messed with the recipe a bit. Used sugar free caramel sauce, just a bit of brown sugar mixed with artificial sugar. Less butter & I used old fashioned oats. He loved it. He put chopped walnuts in his & ate it on top of his steel cut oatmeal. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious. Used very tart Granny Smith apples which balanced out the sweetness of the other ingredients. A crowd pleaser. Made one with walnuts added to the topping. Very good addition. Also added a touch of nutmeg. I increased the recipe and made a 9 x 13. I let them cook for over an hour to sufficiently soften up the apples.

I love the addition of the caramel syrup especially if your apples are a bit on the tart side.  Also liked using the apple bowl to mix the topping which picked up any residual caramel and cinnamon.   The apples are almost creamy which is what we like.   I made a big crisp and then three smaller ones for the freezer.  Great recipe!  Thanks.

This is a great and simple recipe! My husband loved it and on my first try he said I should make this for thanksgiving! Definitely a winner, thanks for a great recipe. I used Granny Smith apples and sliced them thin in order to bake faster. I also used salted butter because I felt that I didn't want it to be too sweet. I also doubled up on the crisp topping.

I really felt that it had far too much flour and would have preferred a more crispy top.  It also needed a lot more cinnamon.

This is my new go-to recipe for any occasion for which I need a dish to share. It is gobbled-up in no time and gets an incredible number of compliments.

I've switched the recipe to use rice flour and gluten-free oats to make it friendly for those who don't eat gluten. I made it gluten-free without telling my husband and some friends until after they ate it, and they still loved it. I actually prefer using the rice flour now - it gives the dish a little different texture than wheat flour. It's crispier with rice flour, I think. 

Either way, this recipe is sure to please!

A little more caramel doesn't hurt at all!

OMG! We LOVED it! I made it using Sarah Jo's homemade caramel sude recipe (which was so easy and delicious), switched to Granny Smith apples, and accidentally doubled the brown sugar (full cup instead of half cup), and even though it was a bit on the extra-sweet side, it was awesome! Can't add anything other than if you're looking for something easy for dessert for Thanksgiving, or just because, this is an great dish. If you're doubting it, don't! Just go ahead and make it. What could you possibly loose? But there is a lot of taste bud pleasing yum to gain. :)

This was a wonderful apple crisp recipe. I did not find it too sweet. I used Kings Cupboard Caramel Sauce (less sweet maybe?) and Granny Smith and Fuji apples, though all granny smiths might have been best. The topping was crunchy around the edges and with dairy whipped cream or warm with vanilla ice cream, it is the best I have found. Thank you! Definitely a keeper for me.

Very good and easy to prepare.  We really enjoyed it.  I used Golden Delicious apples because that is what I had as well as old fashioned oat (not quick cooking) and it came out just fine.  Other reviewers thought it was too sweet, but we did not think so. Thank you for posting this recipe!

I thought this would be perfect and flavorful for fall,but I found it bland. I followed the directions as written but think I will stick with the apple crisp that I make that includes the main ingredients of walnuts, raisins, oats, cinnamon, apples and pears. Overall the caramel flavor just did not come through as I had hoped.

Oh my gosh - this is SO good. I used a mixture of half caramel syrup and half thick caramel cream (the kind sold as a spread). I also added a dash of nutmeg, and used an additional two apples. The result was a sublime dessert.

Great recipe! Made for my family with fresh picked apples from the orchard and it was gone in less than 24hrs. All my family now placing request for Thanksgiving. I did adjust the recipe by adding a pinch of nutmeg to mines. Will definitely make this on a regular
