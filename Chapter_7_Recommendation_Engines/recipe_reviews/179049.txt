I loved this! So easy and yummy on a cold night when everyone is fighting colds. The only thing I would recommend is cutting back the rice to maybe a 1/4 cup...is wasnt soupy enough...seemed more like a runny stovetop chicken and rice. Also, I didnt have canned mixed veggies so I used frozen...was fine but was definitely missing celery. So next time I will probably add cut celery or maybe a can of cream of celery soup to thicken it up just a tad.

This recipe is great for when you want a quick easy chicken soup!  We skipped the mixed veggies, and used just chopped carrots, celery and onions.  We will definitely save this recipe and use it again.
