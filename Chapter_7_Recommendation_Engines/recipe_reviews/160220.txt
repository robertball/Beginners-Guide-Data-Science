Yummy!  I just used oil instead of melted shortening, but followed the process perfectly.  I added seasoned salt in the flour and no cayene (preference).  LOVE the crispy-sticky honey on the cooked fried chicken.  Cook the chicken until barely cooked so it doesn't over cook when you add honey and finish cooking.

First lt me tell you I am not a Southern cook - I don't fry chicken.  That said, this is a solid recipe - if you don't like sweet sauce, don't make it.  My hubby loved this.  It reminded him of his mother's cooking.  It was too sweet for me - but that is just my taste.  The honey & vinegar glaze would be great on chicken wings or boneless wings (Is there really such a thing as boneless wings?) Why did I mark it down one star?  It is messy, took longer than the stated time and the recipe really needs to have you dip the chicken into either buttermilk or egg wash prior to the flour dredge in order for the coating to stick.  NOTE:  Once you place the chicken in the oil - let it sit and cook until good and crispy before attempting to turn it.  Otherwise the coating will fall off.  Will I make this again - probably not.  I am I glad I made it?  You bet!

Love this recipe.  I always double the sauce to use over rice.  I also cut up the chicken breast instead of using whole pieces.

We LOVED this.  I did opt out for the cayenne and used a little chili powder instead.  I also added the s&p to my flour.  My flour and coating stuck just fine.  I did let the floured chicken sit for a few before adding it to the skillet.  I didnt really following the frying steps.  I just fried it like I normally would fry chicken, which is pretty much turn it once.  Someone mentioned messy.  I didnt find it extra messy to fix.  You mix up the honey mixture and then pour it over the chicken.  Easy peasy.  DH said it is a keeper and I agree.  Thanks for sharing!

Frying was an issue because you really have to wait until one side is really done before you flip it, otherwise you risk the coating breaking and falling off. The sauce was good, but the way the recipe goes it's messy. If there is a 'cleaner' way to do this while adding more 'zip' I'm down for trying this again.
