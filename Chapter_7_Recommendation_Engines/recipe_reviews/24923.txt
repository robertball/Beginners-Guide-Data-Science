THIS WAS VERY TASTY. I DID USE LITE VELVEETA INSTEAD OF SHREDDED CHEESE AND TURKEY CHILI TO MAKE IT A BIT LOWER IN FAT. BUT I HAVE TO SAY, BEEFY CHEESE DIP ON THIS WEBSITE IS A BIT BETTER.

This didn't look very good, but it tasted ok. I left the black olives out and only used a half a can of the chili without beans and 1/4 jar of salsa. It got really runny in the microwave and the cheese didn't really melt into the dip. Might make again if I need to use up these ingredients.

This was very good and will make it again.  Try another version, using the fat can of refired beans, 4oz package of cream cheese, 2or3 medium diced tomatoes, a few dashes of garlic salt or powder, (optional: 1 small can of diced ortega chilies).  Heat on top of the stove until all ingredients are well blended. Open a bag of tortilla chips and or the large dipping Fritos then dig in.--SANDYEGGO, SANTEE, CALIFORNIA
