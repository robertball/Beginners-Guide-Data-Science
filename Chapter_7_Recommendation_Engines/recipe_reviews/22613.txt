This is a great recipe.  Here are a few suggested tweaks to make it EXCELLENT:

Use a Dutch cocoa like Van Houten or Droste...it makes a significant difference in the depth of the chocolate taste.  Hershey's just can't compare.

Use hot brewed coffee for a portion of the hot water poured over the top (1/2 cup).  It will cut down on the sweetness from the massive amount of sugar in the recipe.

Throw in 1/2 cup of chopped pecans if you like nuts.

I have also reduced the final sugar step to just 1/2 cup of brown sugar (omitting the white sugar in that step), and the cake turns out fine.  Still has the same hot fudge consistency of the bottom layer.

Enjoy!

Like many of you, I sift through many of the reviews to get input on a new recipe.  I did that with this one, and am surprised that there were so many people who liked this recipe.  I was very disappointed in this recipe.  It was easy.  Looked great when it came out of the oven with a great sauce.  But, it tasted terrible!!  I remember some of the past reviews saying something about it tasting funny.  That is also how I felt.  I tried to determine just what it was that tasted "funny".  I think the water diluted a rich flavor of the cake and gave it a watered taste.  It was like something was missing.  Something GOOD!!  Sorry this is such a bad review.  I pitched it.  Good luck though if you want to try it!!

A nine inch pan wasn't enough for the amount I needed to serve, so I increased this recipe by one-half and put it in a 9x13 pan.  It worked out great.  Served barely warm with a big dollop of whipped cream -- Wow!  It was super easy too.

This turned out wonderful.  I was a little leary about the water, but it really makes a nice sauce.  Fairly quick to put together so your not slaving in the kitchen all day.  Thanks Hershey.

I found that this made a very bland cocoa-y cake. It was an interesting way to make pudding cake, but I didn't like the texture. I had to add chocolate sauce and added cool whip free as a topping. The cake part was bland and floury and the fudge sauce was bland and gelatinous. I expected a richer, milk chocolate taste.

WOW! This recipe is a keeper for all you chocoholics out there! A very rich, chocolatey experience. Easy recipe, takes about 40 to 50 mins total to mix together and bake. The outcome is amazing. The cake is very moist and not as fluffy as a devil's food, but not as dense as a brownie. I would say... somewhere inbetween those two. And the fudge on the bottom is delicious... exactly hot fudge. Scoop some vanilla bean ice cream on this, and you have a decadent winner! I would suggest a glass of milk to wash this down, too!

Always a favorite!  EVERYONE I've made this for loves it.  

I saw a review about it not tasting quite right.  I've never had that problem, nor has anyone I've served it to.  This pudding cake is RICH and not at all lacking in flavor, and I'm known as something of a "food snob".  So I can only think that there might be a problem with the ingredients used.

Using the best possible ingredients is ALWAYS important, and in this recipe, there might be a couple of things that people didn't take care to note.  A few things I'd suggest:

1. Use all of the ingredients listed.  Don't skip the small amount of salt -- it brings out the flavor of the chocolate.

2.  Use BUTTER.  From a FRESH stick.  Not margarine, and not something that's been sitting in your refrigerator for a year.

3.  Make sure your flour is fresh.  If it's been sitting around too long, or if you live in a humid environment, the flour can get a stale taste to it and it will impart that staleness to whatever you're baking.

4.  Water quality varies by location.  Use COLD water, and heat it up in the microwave.  Don't use hot water from the tap; it's been sitting in the water heater for who-knows-how-long.  If your water is chlorinated and you can SMELL it (as I can lately down here in Fort Lauderdale), buy a gallon of bottled spring water.  Heat the water in the microwave.

5.  USE PURE VANILLA EXTRACT!  Do NOT use that phony "vanillin", artificial flavoring.  It doesn't retain its flavor well when cooked.

This dessert was an afterthought upon realizing that my son's birthday cake was going to be too small to feed the amount of guests I had coming.  I prepared a double batch of the recipe (everything except the water) in the morning, put it in a 13x9 glass baking dish, covered it and put it aside.  When we sat down for dinner I poured the hot water on and put it in the oven.  The smell alone made your mouth water!  I couldn't spoon this out fast enough for my guests and it was gone in a flash.  Needless to say, this was a hit!  Unfortunately, I only got to lick what was left on the spoon!

P.S.  I still have some of the birthday cake left over!

I came back looking for this recipe because I made it last year to take on vacation and I want to do it again.  We rent a condo for a week, so creative cooking is a challenge.  I pre mixed the dry ingredients before I left home, and then added the other stuff and baked.  My extended family was VERY impressed that we had such a GREAT dessert in a temporary kitchen.  I don't know if it "keeps" for the next day because I barely got a bite!!

Loved it! I used 1/4 cup of Patron XO Caffe (a coffee flavored tequila that blows all other coffee liqeuers out of the water) in place of half of the milk & I used leftover coffee instead of water. WOW! This tasted rich & decadent w/out being too much. But don't plan on getting 8 servings out of this...maybe we're pigs but we only got five.  Srved it w/ fresh whipped cream & garnished w/ a couple of roasted coffee beans.

I had hoped for more with this recipe after reading the reviews, because I love pudding cake.  Not sure why it was mostly cake and not very much pudding.  I have a recipe I like better so probably won't try it again.

This turned out perfectly for me.  I wish I could say I tasted it!  I made it for New Years Eve and a horde of teenage boys swooped down on it, scraping the bowl clean before we could get any.  I served it with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream.  The cake looks like it is alive when you take it out of the oven.  It is breathing!  It appears mostly set up but it has a "molten" chocolate cake quality to it.  They not only scraped the pan clean, they scraped their plates clean.

JUST don't make it ahead of time and then try to reheat-just not how it works.  This recipe reminded me of the cake mixes on buffets at KFC and Ponderosa.  It is best served right out of the oven as the sauce my be absorbed by the cake if you try to reheat.  Very good, just my fault for trying to make ahead.  Enjoy!

Simple, very quick and very good warm with a scoop of very good vanilla ice-cream.  Personally I was wishing the cake would be a bit richer.  The recipe has no eggs and maybe that would make a richer moister cake?  But still very good and I'll make it again.

Quick, easy and comforting when you need a family dessert. Great with vanilla ice cream. One of those recipes you think is too weird to work but amazingly turns out great! I just wonder if the person who reviewed this as gross and runny did not realize it is supposed to have a wet, pudding-like layer on the bottom? That's the best part! Don't try and cook it till it tests done like a regular cake, it is supposed to be just "set" in the middle.

I thought this was pretty good, but my husband didn't like it. He never goes for anything chocolate made from cocoa powder because it's more of a bitter taste and he likes more of a milk chocolate taste. It wasn't as good the next day, even after I heated it up in the microwave to make the chocolate sauce gooey again. You have to eat it when it's still warm and gooey!

Really easy and so great with vanilla ice cream. Replacing part of the hot water with coffee and reducing the 1/2 cup of white sugar to 1/4 that is sprinkled on before baking makes it great mocha pudding cake. I've made this four times in a month!

Would love to have a reduced sugar version of this recipe!  I thought it tasted delicious, especially hot out of the oven, but I could only eat a very small amount of it before feeling a huge sugar crash coming on.  Instead of being overwhelmed by chocolate taste (which is what I was aiming for), I was overwhelmed by the taste of sugar.  If I could reduce the sugar, and perhaps add semi sweet chocolate chips and/or nuts, I'd definitely serve it.

this is one of my all time favorites.  I serve with ice cream, and I use half water/half coffee for the liquid - i think it deepens the flavor... This is from a hershey cookbook from 1989 - I've been making it since then - it never fails to impress....

Terrific!   It reminds me of a recipe in my childhood Girls'and Boys' Cookbook by Betty Crocker.  I do agree with Lizziepoo, though, and will either add more cocoa, lessen the sugar, or experiment with chocolate or fudge as an ingredient to bring out the chocolate/fudge flavor. It IS there, but the first and overall taste is pure sugar.  That's not what I look for in a recipe like this, but we all taste things differently.  Tnanks to Hershey's kitchens for putting this one out(again?)!

I made this as a last minute dessert, exactly as stated in the recipe. It was great!! My guests loved it. Commented that it was very rich and chocolatey but not too sweet. I served it with vanilla ice cream, fresh strawberries, and a sprinkling of powdered sugar. It looked like some terribly decadent dessert that you would get in a restaurant, and SO easy!

This is soooo easy...and tastes sooo good. My boyfriends favorite desert is a brownie sundae... which this absolutely beats (since this is less expensive and always fresh).  I added walnuts for my half of it and left his side without... The fudge sauce is great (better than adding chocolate syrup)... Only thing is that unlike some reviews, I never got a 'pudding' consistency. It was definitely more like a fudge and brownie like. GREAT STUFF

My grandma used to make a chocolate pudding cake, and it was always one of the favourites for me and my brothers growing up.  This one is exactly the same - a huge hit when I made it for some friends.

When I was a child, my mother used to buy a boxed pudding cake mix which I loved and have not been able to find anywhere since.  This really does take the cake.  I think it's quicker to make than a boxed mix!  And it tastes heavenly.  My husband says I'll never need to make a box mix again!

This was a great dessert. It was very easy to put together and tasted so good.  I liked how it really formed a pudding like sauce on the bottom.  I served it with whipped cream and it was delicious.  I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe! This turns out just like pudding cake should. We like it best when still warm out of the oven and topped with vanilla ice cream. The reviewers who gave this a poor rating must have either prepared it wrong or not understood that a sauce/pudding layer is supposed to develop on the bottom of the cake layer.

When I first made this, I thought when I added the water : "this is not going too work out". Well, it does ! It's a very tasty dessert, easy to make and surprising. I didn't use Hershey's cocoa powder because it's not available where I leave, and it still turned out great. Rich, creamy and gooey. I'll try to make it with coffee as advised in one of the comments. It might correct the only small issue I find, that it's a bit too sweet to my taste.

This is the best Chocolate pudding I've ever made.  I thought it was a bit sweet but my partner loves it and always asks me to make it for him - he has even made it himself once and he is no cook so that goes to show how quck and easy it is

Wow, this was good! It's not a very fancy dessert, but sort of "down-home."  Great for when you need a chocolate fix.  It's sweet but not too sweet; rich, but not too rich.  I followed the recipe exactly and it took about 40 minutes to cook.  I let it cool for half an hour and then served with fresh raspberries.  I didn't have any ice cream around, but that would've been fantastic with it.  The pudding layer is so yummy...it doesn't taste like cake batter.  It's like a rich fudge sauce for the cake.  I tried it the next day cold and I think I prefer it warm.  The cake layer tends to dry out a little when it's cold.  Still, I will definitely will make again.

This is the first thing that ever made my chocaholic husband say "too much chocolate!" Try it on your chocaholic and see for your self! Definatly a comfort food.  Because it uses mostly dry ingredients it is easy to transport the ingredients and bake in other places. I'm still trying different ways to make this out camping - I can't quite figure out how to bake it over a wood fire.

The chocolate flavor comes from the taste of cocoa - and the brand does make a difference - which is different from the chocolate taste in chips or bars. 

In reading other reviews, I think that some people were expecting a "cake" - Instead of thinking of this as a cake recipe - think of it as a dessert recipe. It has a cake-like top layer and a pudding-like bottom layer.

EXCELLENT!!  I tried the prepackaged box version of this once and knew there had to be a better recipe.  This is it!  It is the ultimate dessert in our household!  The last time I made it I did not have enough cocoa, so I used unsweetened bakers chocolate and cut down on the butter and it turned out great!  A great way to add more (yes more) fudginess is to add about a half cup of premium chocolate chips to the cake batter.  Oh so decadent!

WOW!  My 13 year old son made this cake for us today.  It should be called Magic Cake, he couldn't believe how the hot fudge sauce formed under the cake as it baked!  We didn't even wait for it to cool, served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream...to die for!  Yum!

This recipe was really great. My 5 year old daughter and I made it together.  We got more of a brownie with hot fudge than pudding consistency.  It was really inexpensive and uses ingredients I usually have on hand, so we will definately be making this again.

This has become one of my and my boyfriend's favorite desserts.  Just before you bake it, it looks like a huge watery mess that couldn't possibly form a cake. But when it's finished baking, the result is amazing. If you decide that you want a little extra sauce on the bottom, try tossing in a small handful of chocolate chips just before putting this in the oven.

I made this twice in one week! My family loved it. I didn't change anything in the recipe and it turned out great. The first time I made this, I prepared it ready for the oven (leaving out the water until baking time)and took it over to our friends house and baked it there. By the time we were done with dinner, dessert was served warm, with vanilla ice cream! It is pretty sweet, so it's definitely best with vanilla ice cream I think. Great easy recipe!

This is the easiest cake to make. I used boiling hot water to pour over though as that is the original recipe. Best part is it doesn't have to cool completely before eating! Easy to fix, very rich and chocolately. Great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! One of my all time favorites.

This was the first dessert I made as a new wife almost 40 years ago. Even tho I didn't know how to cook, it turned out perfectly. It has stood the test of time thru 6 children and a herd of grandkids. It's one of those recipes that you can whip up in a flash and always turns out delicious. We keep a carton of vanilla icecream in the freezer just to eat on top of this cake.

I made a few modifications based on what I had on hand, and this was an easy, excellent Valentine's Day dessert. I used margarine, and added two ounces of melted baking chocolate. I made a pot of coffee to serve with the dessert and used it instead of water. I put the batter into two heart molds (2-cup) that I baked for 35 mins. I turned them over to serve (after cooling) and it was perfect! The sauce was thicker than I expected, as I was really scared when I put these in the oven.

I had the in-laws stopping by this afternoon, and wanted to make something sweet for a nice, rainy afternoon.  Saw this recipe and found it to be quick and easy.  Followed the directions exactly and it turned out fine.  Topped it with some vanilla ice cream and it was a big hit!

Loved it-with a few changes: added a bit more milk until the pudding was not as thick and was more spreadable-sort of pancake mixture consistency; added 1/4 cup chocolate chips; put a tsp of coffee per cup of water for the sauce and used 1 1/2 cups of water instead of 1 1/4. I don't like my puddings too sweet so omitted the final granulated sugar and just used brown sugar.  Will definitely make again.

Outstanding as always. I've been eating this wonderful dessert for over 30 years and it's still fantastic! Best with fresh sweetened whipped cream on top. Everyone wants to take the rest home.

This was fun for the kids -- they loved it.  I liked it, although I thought the cake texture was a little unusual.  Will keep this in my arsenal anyway.

Oh yum! This was a real hit at dinner with friends on a snowy Sunday night.  We topped it with vanilla whipped cream.  Definitely a keeper and I love that it's something you can whip up on the fly out of the pantry.

I love trying new things in the kitchen...especially things based around chocolate/fugde...but this was a disaster. There was no consistency or texture and it tasted horrible. Will not be making this one again.

Thanks

THIS RECIPE HAS BEEN A HIT AT OUR HOUSEHOLD FOR MANY YEARS NOW.  AND I GET REPEAT REQUESTS FOR IT FROM GUESTS. I'M SURPRISED AT SOME OF THE LOW REVIEWS. I WONDER IF THEY ARE STICKING TO THE 'REAL' INGREDIENTS. DO NOT SUBSTITUTE ANY OTHER OFF-BRAND COCOA AND MAKE SURE YOU USE UNSALTED REAL BUTTER, NOT MARGARINE.

This was so delicious and easy to make. It was like chocolate cake, chocolate pudding, and hot fudge all together in one warm ooey gooey dessert, so how could you go wrong. This is perfect to make when you are craving chocolate. We topped off this decadent dessert with freshly made whipped cream....perfect. Thanks for the great recipe!

Well...  at least it was easy.  It is very sweet, and doesn't have a very distinct brownie-type taste and texture like I thought it would.  Because it is so sweet, I really think it would be pretty good with some vanilla ice cream (Blue Bunny comes to mind).  Probably won't make this one again though.

I didn't really like the taste of this and the sauce was sort of gelatinous which just wasn't that appealing.  Also, I think calling it a cake is sort of misleading.  It was more like a brownie really.

I have made this many times because my husband LOVES it.  It is delicious and easy to make.  It is best when still warm but I never have any trouble with any leftover cake.  My kids aren't as crazy about it as we are but they are really picky.  I highly recommend this recipe.

Very easy and quick to put together.  I was surpirsed at how the sauce was so thick and creamy.  Excellent dessert when you need to have a chocolate fix!  I had some toffee bits that I needed to use up, and I poured some of them on top of the batter before I added the topping and hot water.  It added to the over-all gooiness of the cake.  A great, quick weeknight dessert.

Great chocolate flavor - it tastes like un-set fudge!  a llttle messy to serve,  it's hard to get all the fudge out of the pan.  Loved the texture, and a few family members said they liked it better the second day after the leftovers had been chilled in the refrigerator

I thought this recipe has a strange taste and I finally figured out that the flour had an extremely strong taste and wasn't good at all. Also I had to cook this for almost an hour just to get the cake to be firm. I'll try it again but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

Loved this cake.....made this one night last minute and we had a yummy dessert. Cake was moist with a fudgy-pudding sauce throughtout. Served with the new french vanilla cool whip....yummy! Quick and easy to make....worth the calories. I was shocked to add all the water on top and find a fabulous result....will make again really soon!

I wanted to love this, but something about the flavor was a little off. Too floury perhaps.. I did really like the texture and the fudgy sauce underneath, and with vanilla ice cream it was even better. Oddly enough, we reheated leftovers the next day and liked it even more. I'll be trying other similar recipes for a better version.

I have been looking all over for this recipe!! It was on the Hershey's label at one time; the clerk was probably wondering why I was reading every can on the shelf :) Of course, found it here on AllRecipes!!! This is the BEST!  The hot fudge sauce it makes is simply delicious over Vanilla Bean Ice Cream!!!

If you like Betty Crocker Microwaveables you will enjoy this; the dessert certainly wasn't bad, just not what I expected.  The main issue I had is that there was just way too much sauce, if I ever make this again I would definitly add less water at the end.

This cake is a regular favourite.  I just tried a variation where I used lemon zest and a bit of lemon juice instead of cocoa in the cake part (and a bit of extra cocoa in the sauce part).  It came out great; a slightly more "adult" flavour than the double chocolate.

The double chocolate version is great frozen, eaten straight out of the freezer.
