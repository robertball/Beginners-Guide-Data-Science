It tastes fabulous BUT..... it the layers seemed too thin.  There doesn't seem enough of everything for a 9x13 pan.  Next time I will double it and still put it in the same pan.

This is another of those comfort dessert recipes that have pleased many, many people for many, many years.  I wonder how many times this recipe, or the dessert itself, has been passed around or shared for probably the last three decades? There's plenty of opportunity with this recipe for your own spin...a graham cracker crust maybe, or different flavors of pudding? A layer of strawberries or bananas with vanilla pudding. Topped with coconut, or all chocolate pudding, topped with Heath bars. Every time I've made this, no matter what the variation, everyone has loved this dessert.

Excellent recipe.  Great for families and casual dinner parties or potlucks.  The secret to this recipe is to be patient and ensure every level has set before moving on to the next.

Everyone seems to LOVE this dessert!! I like to use Pecan Sandies (shortbead/pecan cookies) for the bottom layer.  I also do a layer of walnuts. This dessert is a huge hit everytime I make it.

I don't like pudding very much but I love this recipe and so does my husband. I have made it several times and here are the changes I made, 1. I make it in a 9x9 pan and lightly press the crust into the pan otherwise it is hard to cut into bars, 2. for the first layer I mix the cream cheese and one cup of whip cream together and then skip the second whip cream layer, this gives the cream cheese a lighter texture. I have also used cool whip instead of whip cream (whip cream tastes better but cool whip is faster and cheaper), 3. I skip the vanilla pudding layer. Next time I think I will try the recipe with marscopone cheese instead of cream cheese.

Awesome recipe, I always make this dessert, for Christmas.  Instead of chocolate pudding I use pistascho pudding.  It is always a hit.

This is really called "the next best thing to Robert Redford cake". My grammies came up with this recipe when I was a very little girl the only difference is that we use a walnut crust because we had walnut trees!

I have made this dish many times over the years.
I don't use sugar in the crust. It doesn't need it. But I do use a full cup of chopped pecans.
Also I use 1 each of the large instant chocolate and vanilla puddings and mix them together, using 4 cups of milk. I whip my own cream (a pint, whipped and sweetened with sugar and vanilla, is plenty) to use in the cream cheese layer and the rest goes on top. You can shave a chocolate bar on top for garnish.   And yes, it is addicting!

I a dietary manager in a nursing home. I chose thie dessert to serve for a family appreciation meal. It was a huge hit with staff, residents and there families. I made 3 large steamtable pans and 5 small steamtable pans. The process seemed to take forever but I know it was only because I had scaled this to 150 servings. I am making this for my family Easter tonight. I know it will go alot quicker as I am only making one 9 x 13 pan. Recommend to all. Only change I made was the title. I didn't think it appropriate to tell our residents and there family that we were serving "Sex in a Pan". We renamed it "heaven in a pan" for this event only. Thanks

This is one of my favorite recipes. I put 1/3 cup of peanut butter in the cream cheese mix. I also mix the chocolate and vanilla pudding together to make one layer.

We make something extremely similar to this in my family. But, for the bottom we use oreo cookies or a grahm cracker crumbs with a little melted butter and pressed into the bottom of the pan. The rest is very similar. We also usually make a layer with just one flavor pudding.  Something I but milky way pieces on top. We call it "Fat Man's Delight" in our family. My dad called it that one time, and the name just stuck.

I have been making this for over 20 years!

Two things I do though
1. I mix the powdered sugar with 8 ounce cream cheese and one small cool whip I spread that on the cooled crust.
I make the cholate pudding and put that over the cream cheese mixture and top that off with cool whip and put sprinkles on top or what's left over from the nuts.
We too call it Sex in a pan!
My Uncle named that after the first time he had had it!
It is very good with coffee and we also find it better the next day!!

Served at our Boxing Day dinner and we all went back for seconds.  It was amazing!  So simple yet so darn good.
As most of us cooks do, we add or make a little change. I did add two thin sliced  bananas onto vanilla layer, great addition!  Only change I may do is to increase the pecan layer by 1/2 and add 12 ounces of cream cheese instead of 8 ounces.

I love, love, love, this recipe.  One of my very favorites.  I've been making it for about 20 years.  One thing I did find out, don't know if anyone else has had this experience.  I use soy milk all the time, and if you use soy milk for this recipe, it doesn't set up firm like cow's milk.  So I had to put in the freezer, and then pull it out just before serving.  Just a good thing to know for the future.

This was very good! My husband loved it as well and he is not a pudding person and me I love anything creamy. I made just a few adjustments. I doubled the cream cheese mixture and layered it with pastacio pudding, vanilla then chocolate pudding. Very yummy! It was my friends b-day I gave her half the pan they loved it as well.  Thanks for this old recipe.

I doubled the recipe for the Crust.  For the pudding layers, the recipe calls for 1.5 cups of milk but I used two cups to provide a slighthly thicker layer.  (pudding mix called for 3 cups so it was still plenty thick enought to hold when I sliced it).  Turned out Perfect.....
I also made a Strawberry and Banana Version.  Instead of the layer of chocolate, I chopped up bananas and strawberries.   It turned out great.  Both were a big hit

Used 1/2 c. almond flour  + 1/2 c. white flour for the crust. Also, used only 1/2c of confectioners sugar and added a touch of vanilla flavor to the whipped cream. This recipe works best in a 9x9 glass pan.

My husband had a pot luck at work.  He rarely cooks and never makes dessert but I told him he had to make his own dish.  This is a simple, crowd pleasing dessert and his colleagues were devouring it.   We used a 9 x 9 pan and did three pudding layers of Vanilla, Pistachio and Chocolate.   Added some cool whip to the cream cheese layer like others suggested.   Topped it off with Skor pieces.   A great dessert for group functions.

A few suggestions for 'tweaks' in preparation -- 
1) Use a smaller pan than recommended. Even with all of the layers, the finished product is really thin and it's difficult to cover each layer with the next.
2) Allow enough time to let each layer set before adding the next.
3) I used a glass baking dish and assumed that the butter in the crust would prevent sticking....not so much. I was literally scraping the finished product out of the dish to serve it, so it ended up kind of like a cobbler (lol). May not have had this issue with a nonstick metal pan, but I think chilled desserts do better in glass or Pyrex and will use some cooking spray next time.

A very good, easy to follow recipe that I made very few adjustments to. First off, the prep time posted doesn't take into account all the time you need to cool each layer. The crust took at least twenty minutes to cool, and every layer after that needs time to set. I followed the advice of some previous reviewers and used an 8 x 11 pan rather than 9 x 13. It worked great--the top layer of whipped cream just reached the top of the pan.

I never use instant pudding and I had a bit of a problem with those layers--it started to set in the bowl before I could pour it into the pan! I added a little extra milk to make the pudding easier to pour, and everything worked out swimmingly.

I used extra pecans, melted chocolate and sliced strawberries to garnish. I really like this as a base recipe--you could add layers of banana or other fruits, different flavors of pudding, or infuse the whipped cream with chocolate, coffee, etc. A good recipe I'm sure I will be making again!

This was a good recipe.  I think the title Sex in a Pan had me prepared for something a bit more decadent and rich than what I actually got, so I was a little disappointed.  My family, however was not.  They loved this dessert, especially the crust.  I will make this one again.  I might even try some different pudding flavors for some variety.

I doubled everything in the recipee because I like it higher and not thin. I also added Grand Marnier to the whip cream layers. I finished the top off with a dusting of cocoa powder. Was a big hit

I found the layers to be a bit thin as well. Instead of doing a layer of vanilla and chocolate pudding I used two bozes of chocolate for a thicker layer and because I don't like vanilla pudding.  I thought it tasted great though and so did my guests!  Will make it again.

made for a party. everyone said it was good. I definately agree with others and double the crust AND use a smaller pan. It seemed the layers were a bit thin.  I also added some chocolate shavings and sliced strawberries to top.

Seriously amazingly good dessert!!  I haven't tried myself, but I think you could substitute any flavor pudding or perhaps even add a pie filling.  Really good!  Double up on the whip cream though.

I love Sex in a Pan. This is the first time I have made my whipped cream (I usually cheat with cool whip) and I didnt do just heavy whipping cream but added powdered sugar and vanilla and made it richer. I also grated some chocolate for garnish so no one would notice where I had a few "spreading errors."  Besides dirtying up a lot of bowls a simple great desert!!!

This is my absolutely favorite desert!! I also find the layers are too thin if you follow the recipe, so I double the recipe every time  and I use a slightly larger pan, but not much bigger 10x16. Other than that, I don't change a thing!! It's the best!! Enjoy :)

Delish! Just like mom used to make it. I followed other reviewers advice and made it in a smaller pan. I also added chopped pecans on top.

I modified this recipe because I can't stand instant pudding. I eliminated the vanilla pudding and doubled the chocolate.  I used the large box of chocolate pudding that you cook. I started with the crust, layered on the cream cheese mixture, layered on the cooled chocolate pudding and finished with the top layer of whipped cream.  De-lish!

I do agree that the layers  for a 9 by 13 are too thin, but it was still delicious!!! I substituted instant banana cream pudding for the vanilla pudding and it was much tastier!!! I will make it again but will increase the bottom crust, and the whipped cream and the milk in the pudding.... Also I found the cooked pudding made it much creamier!!!

This is a great recipe and with a few minor changes, my husbands favorite. I use Pistachio pudding, and I blend about a cup of the whipping cream/whipped topping into the cream cheese layer. Grease your pan well and don't over bake the crust or its a bear to get out of the pan. I also sprinkle some chopped toasted pecans on top. We call it Pistachio Delite. A very versatile recipe.

This recipe is delicious- I made it for my husband to take to work for a holiday luncheon and he said it was gone before first break was over! I didn't have regular chocolate pudding on hand so I used chocolate fudge pudding which made it even richer and tastier.  There was room in the pan that you could easily add another layer to the dish.
