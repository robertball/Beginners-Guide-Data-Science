Loved making this recipe and it looks so fancy for even a potluck. I would personally like more heat next time. I would add extra seasoning or the cayenne which I left out. I might have added a little sugar for sweetness in the cornbread, but that's just how my Grandma made it. I used vinegar added to milk instead of the buttermilk. I would make this again. So simple for a crowd too!
