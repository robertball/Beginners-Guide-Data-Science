I used reduced fat mayonnaise and fat free evaporate milk. Though the kids didn't like it, I sure did. What they didn't eat, I finished. The mayonnaise and the evaporated milk made these eggs wonderfully fluffy and the mayonnaise gave it the slightest bit of tang. The dill weed was a nice touch--I would have never thought to add it to eggs but it works.

This was pretty good and a something a little different for breakfast.  I cut this down to one serving and it wasn't as "smoky" as I would have liked but overall, pretty good.  I never used mayo in eggs before but it did make the eggs fluffy. I cut back on the garlic powder and added some cracked black pepper.  I put this inside a tortilla along with some bacon and cheddar cheese for a nice breakfast wrap.

Oh, YUM!!!!! These eggs were DELICIOUS! I scaled the recipe back to just feed myself, but I have to admit, I didn't really measure all of the ingredients, more eye-balled them to taste. I did use the dried dill, but I wanna try them with my garden fresh dill next time. I think between the bacon drippings and the dill they did give the eggs a very slight smoky flavor, and the mayo and 1/2 & 1/2 gave a wonderful texture. All of the ingredients really paired well together. This really hit the spot for me this morning! I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Followed the recipe exactly. All I tasted was the garlic. My husband wouldn't even finish this. Texture was kind of grainy as well.  I won't make this again.

This was just okay.  We didn't think it was worth all the work that went into it.

As carnivore pointed out, dill sure adds a smoky punch...definitely not the bacon drippings. I think next time I’m in the mood for burger, I won’t waste my time on dumb, boring, unsmoky bacon as a topping. A couple of heaping tablespoons of dried dill sprinkled on top should give me all the smoke flavor I need. Throw a couple of smoky dill pickles on the side....anyone smell smoke!?!

I'm always looking for different flavors in my eggs, and while I didn't  follow it precisely, it did have a nice smokey flavor.

Great recipe as you would usually have everything. I have a Grey Poupon fetish and will use any excuse to use it. So with 1 Tbs of Poupon and 1 heaping Tbs of Crimbled Feta spread on top when served we found it a luxurious breakfast.
