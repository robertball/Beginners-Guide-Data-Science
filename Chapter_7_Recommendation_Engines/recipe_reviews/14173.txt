I am so sorry that I can't give this recipe six stars! I only had one person that thought it had too much mayo. Okay, here is the very few changes I made. I only added half the worchestershire called for. I didn't have any celery so I added an extra 1/2C of grapes. Next time I will cut the grapes in half. I also added more bacon than what was called for(about eight slices). When I was baking my chicken for this I put my bacon in the oven too. Different pan though. I made my sauce first so it could sit for an hour or so as someone else suggested. Good idea! I served this with Peppy's Pita Bread (on this site). Big hit. Try both recipes.

After making this once, I will never pay for pre-made salad in a store!  This was awesome as it is.  Modifications will be a matter of personal choice, but I would second letting the salad sit for a while for the flavor to really build up.  I tasted it when made immediately and then after an hour.  Wow!  The flavor just gets better.  I will probable scale back the mayo a little but not much.  I think subbing dried currants instead of the grapes would be a nice option.

I make this ALL the time. It's wonderful.  The only thing I change is that I add sliced almonds and avocado chunks. Superb!

A different twist to the standard chicken salad.  Everyone loved the curry flavor.  I used a pre-roasted chicken from the grocery store and picked off big chunks - big time saver.

I have been making this for years now!  We LOVE this.  I have never used the bacon though.  I usually buy a rotisserie chicken and use that as well.  I always use 2 tsp curry powder too!  This is big favorite around our house!  Thanks so much for posting.

Really yummy & easy to make. I added extra curry & lemon juice to enhance the flavor. I also found out letting the dresssing sit for aobut an ohur before putting it on the salad really brings out the curry flavour!

I liked the curry flavor of this recipe, but I would omit the Worcestshire sauce and decrease the amount of mayo.

I substituted raisins for the grapes and used twice as much curry and this recipe was fantastic.  Very tasty not like the normal bland chicken salad recipes.  I loved it.

A definate repeat.
I substituted watermelon pickles for grapes and used sweet curry (all I had on hand)instead of curry, but all turned out well. My husband and I both loved it.

This is so close to a salad I enjoyed in Maryland.  There is was stuffed in a pita and served with slices of fresh fruit.  It is so easy, so yummy.  Hint:  When grilling or baking, place a few chicken breasts (or thighs) in too.  Wrap tightly and refrigerate or freeze.  Then the longest part of the prep process for this recipe is complete!

I loved the way this recipe came out, but had to modify to get the curry flavor that I wanted.  Even after the flavors settled for a night, the original recipe tasted too much like mayo, so I doubled the amount of curry powder and lemon juice.  It came out great after that!

this makes the perfect Curried Chicken Salad. I use rotesserie chickens and only Dukes mayonnaise.  I use scallions instead of onions until Vidalias are available.  A fabulous make ahead company dish. The recipe is locked in my head so I can take it with me when I visit relatives who think I'm a wonderful cook.  Thanks Maggie!

This is a great recipe!! I made only a few adjustments which included:increasing the amount of curry powder to about 1 tspn and cutting back on the mayo (mine was creamy enough at about 1/2 cup). I made chicken salad pita sandwiches all week (GREAT with avocado)! YUMMY!

I make this very regularly now--yum! I never add all the mayo, just enough to make everything stick together a bit. More worcestershire and curry powder. Do yourself a favor and add some sliced almonds, this brings the dish to a whole new level

Delicious! I left out the bacon, used light mayo and it was great! There's a local store that makes a curry chicken salad but it is very expensive. I decided to try this and it's just as good and saves me $$!

No celery, grapes, or onions here.  I used onion powder instead.  I like to try out different ways to make a good chicken salad(we're on Atkins)  I really liked this change in a chicken salad.  Repeat recipe.

I made this for a baby shower and stuffed mini cream puff shells to make it fancy.  This is a great recipe!  I omitted the bacon, added chopped pecans and increased the curry a little.  I received lots of compliments and had many requests for the recipe

I haven't tried many Chicken Salads but I thought it was very tasty.  I made it for a birthday party and it was a hit.  I rolled it up in flour tortillas like a jellyroll and sliced it up for some yummy finger food.  I also used an already roasted chicken I bought at the store and then diced it up.  It was a great time saver!

Excellent and easy recipe!  I made this for an office full of manly men & I basically quadrupled the recipe.  They loved it!  I prepared it the night before and I did make just a few changes: I decreased the mayo and subbed sour cream, I left out the onions and I increased the curry powder after making it as written.  After tasting it, both my husband and myself felt the curry needed to be more prominent.  I served it with pita pockets and pita chips.

I changed it a bit because of ingredients on hand - halved sweet cherry tomatoes instead of grapes, and chopped rotisserie chicken instead of straight chicken breasts. Served it with slice of rye bread toasted on one side in a frying pan with a bit of bacon fat. My wife loved it and so did I. I'll do this again.

Love this recipe!  Its a hit no matter where I take it.  I put chicken breasts in the crock pot and then shred the meat when it comes out.  Very good.....tender and so easy!

This was a really great start. I don't follow recipes for the most part; I usually go by taste so recipes are guides.  I did make some changes. I don't like celery and used red pepper instead. No Worcestershire sauce so decided to lessen the mayo and add Dijon mustard instead. I let the onion sit out because that takes out a bit of the bite. Tastes awesome and will make some modifications to it later.

I just made this recipe for the 2nd time.  The first time, I didn't feel like it had enough curry in it.
So, I doubled the Curry from 1/2 tsp to 1 tsp.
This is a delicious recipe otherwise!!!
MMMMMM...I'll be making this in the years to come!!!
BTW...I'm also debuting a new mayonnaise, with olive oil.  This is much closer to the real stuff than the low fat stuff, but also has 1/2 the fat. I'll be buying this all the time now!!!

This was really good!  I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce, so I substituted it with some soy sauce and balsamic vinegar.  I also used more curry powder just because .  Ate it in some pita bread.

This was soooo good!!  I doubled the curry powder, added a little honey and dijon mustard instead of worcestershire, added cashews and water chestnuts and bits of pineapple (omitted celery and subbed raisins for grapes).  It was gone in minutes!  Thank you for the recipe

Absolutely delicious! I made just a few tweaks to the original recipe here and there. Dressing: I like a little less lemon juice and a lot more flavor. I doubled the Worcestershire sauce, changed the amount of curry powder to 1 1/2 tsp(s) (we love the flavor of curry). Salad: I doubled the red onion, grapes and celery (for texture).  Add on: We discussed it and decided the only thing missing were cashews for further texture differences. Will make it a go-to for potlucks and

Very yummy. I use a large 12.5 oz can of chicken for my salad. I used a half cup of real bacon bits instead of making bacon. I used 1/2 cup of craisins instead of grapes because grapes are not tasty right now. Additionally, I upped the curry to 1 1/2 teaspoon, the lemon juice to 2 teaspoons, the worcestershire sauce to 1 teaspoon. I added 1/4 teaspoon garlic granules and 1/2 teaspoon onion powder. I also added a handful of toasted walnuts the first time I made it and just now I added a handful pine nuts because I was out of walnuts/pecans/almonds. I think any nut you like makes a nice accent to the salad. 

It tastes best after sitting over night (minimum). The flavors really sink in after a day or two.

This is great! I doctored it up and it tasted fabulous. I cut the mayo in half and added a full heaping tablespoon of cream cheese. I doubled the curry (1/2 is definitely not enough!) added a couple shakes of cumin and a few shakes of chili powder. Yum! Perfect!

Great salad - just what I was looking for.  I added a little more lemon juice, doubled the curry and used pecans instead of bacon.  Also - I didn't have celery on hand so I subsituted water chestnuts for additional crunch.

A keeper in our house! Several changes: used rotisserie chicken, in dressing doubled lemon juice and worchestershire and used 1/2 tsp reg curry plus 1/4 tsp hot curry, added crisp cooked bacon (4 strips) just before serving to keep it crisp rather than at beginning.

I loved this recipe - I modified it a little:  I didn't have bacon on hand so I skipped the bacon.  I wanted to put this on crackers so I substitued 1 apple chopped quite fine for the grapes.  I made sure to chop the chicken, celery and onion very fine as well.  My guests and my family raved about this chicken salad and wanted the recipe.  It's a keeper!  Next time I'll include the bacon!

Me and my family love it!  I'm vegetarian so I altered it by using some substitutes like Morning Star chicken strips, Vegenaise and I added sliced almonds without the skin.  I also made it one time with fake bacon and it was pretty good but I think we prefer it without the bacon.

I made it, only I did not use the bacon, onions, celery, or grapes.  My hubby doesn’t like crunchy textures like onion or celery so I used a little onion powder and celery seeds, I also swapped the grapes for crasins which gave just a hint of sweet in every bite.  It was truly tasty.

Very Good!  I followed the recipe except for a few minor changes:  I omitted the bacon because I didn't have any and
Used red seedless grapes.
I will make this again and make sure have bacon on hand that time.

The first time I made this, I almost left the curry out. I am glad I didn't. I was very happy with the results written as is and my rating is based on the original recipe.  Since then,  I have made this a few more times and have altered it based on what I have in the house. Apples are a wonderful substitute for the grapes. I usually add a dash more Worcestershire, and use more onion. This recipe is the standard for my chicken salad sandwiches. My husband, not a big curry fan, makes requests for this dish. Thank you for sharing..

Make this, as written all the time, and it never fails to please. Best use for my leftover roast chicken. Ive made it more chopped (smoother) and serve it with fabulous crackers or baguette as appetizer.

I made a half-batch. I omitted the bacon because I didn't have time to cook it, and didn't miss it at all! This is exactly the chicken salad recipe I'd been searching for: the perfect mix of sweet, savory and smooth. I look forward to making this again and again.

What a find!  As suggested, I made the dressing first, cut the mayo in half and doubled the curry, and let it sit while I finished preparing the rest.  Added cashews and substituted dehydrated/powder for raw onions and WOW.

This was awesome! I altered the quantities a little bit: I didn't use bacon, though I might try turkey bacon next time. I used 4 cups of chicken. I didn't have celery, so I used pecans for crunch! I cut the 1 cup of grapes in half, I used 3/4 cup of mayo, I used green onion instead of red, and I used about 1 1/2 tsp. of curry powder. K. . .so that's a lot of revisions, but I loved it!

Fantastic! I used cashews instead of bacon as one reviewer suggested, used the lemon but left out the Worchestershire sauce. I also used golden raisins instead of white grapes. I've found my new favorite lunch recipe!

This was very tasty.  If you want cashew chicken salad, just replace the bacon with cashews and omit the worshishire sauce and lemon juice.  I like to add a little of my favorite mustard to it.  I made both versions and they were both great.

I USED THE MILD CURRY.  IT WAS A BIT BLAND, SO NEXT TIME I WILL USE THE HOT CURRY.  IT DEFINITELY TASTES BETTER THE NEXT DAY.

Love it, love it, love it!  I've made this several times!  It's great made up as a wrap, and never lasts more than a day...and that only with two of us eating it!
