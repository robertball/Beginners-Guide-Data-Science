I really liked this recipe. My family enjoyed it, including my picky two year old. The only thing I will do differently next time is make my rue with a little less milk and a little more sauerkraut juice to give it a little more pop. I also might add about a half of a cup more sauerkraut, just because there wasn't enough of the flavor throughout. Overall great recipe though!

I actually have a recipe very much like this that I found in one of my mom's cookbooks. (From the 80's) with one major exception - no panko. Love your version! I'm a vegetarian, so I leave out the meat. My friends love it, and one of them dislikes sauerkraut.

I made this dish last night and I love it! It's def. a fun twist on the traditional upside down reuben sandwiches I would make in the oven. I love it. Having the noodles in this dish makes it a meal in one! Thanks for sharing!

I doubled the amount of corned beef and cut back on the egg noodles just a touch to compensate. I also added more butter to the crumb topping because when I added the three tablespoons of butter, it seemed like it wasn't enough. This was actually quite good, the whole family liked it which surprized me. We all agreed that this recipe is a repeater.

I served this with Thousand Island dressing to drizzle on top. Really good.

Let me start by saying, I don't like  sauerkraut.  This, however, was fantastic!  It wasn't overpowering at all, the pasta was perfect and doesn't get to mushy when reheated, and this has a flavor like nothing I've made in a while.

2 things I had issues with: the sauce didn't thicken like it should have.  I did put back on the heat for just a bit to help thicken but it still came out a bit runny.  The second issue I had wasn't so much of an issue, but a change I'd make.  The recipe doesn't call for it, but I would recommend cutting up the slices of corned beef.  It seemed like it wasn't well spread out through the dish and when you did get a piece, it was a huge slice instead of balanced bites.

This was really great. I served it with a ham, so omitted the corned beef. I am sure to make it again and the next time the corned beef will be in there. Thank you for a tasty clever meal idea!

I did not have the rye read for this so I omitted this. I used rotini and smoked sausage because that is what I had. Mixed everything together, did not layer and put it in the oven. We all enjoyed this. Will make this in the future. Very easy for potluck/ carry-ins.

This dish was rich and a bit heavy.  It was certainly cheesy.  Next time, I might cut back on the sauerkraut and mustard since those ingredients gave the dish a good zing, and increase the corned beef and rye since I felt those signature Reuben flavors were a bit lost.  Oh, and we left out the salt and didn't miss it.

Came together nicely but next time I would use a rectangular baking dish and not a 2 QT bowl. The cheese mixture sank to bottom 1/2 of bowl so that 1/2 was better than the top 1/2. Taste was good and crunchy top was good. I like a thicker rue so maybe that change next time and I think more corned beef.
