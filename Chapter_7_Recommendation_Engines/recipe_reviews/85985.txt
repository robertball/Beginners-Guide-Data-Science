I found it!!  I have this old tattered family recipe on a postcard and I wanted to see if I could find it online!  The secret is boiling the raisins so they are nice and plump - and I boil them for half an hour until only 1/2 cup of water is left.  Then I add the water to the recipe.  I also add 1 tsp of ground cloves with the cinnamon.  My family gobbles this cake up.

What a nightmare that turned out semi-okay in the end. If I had used all the raisin juice/water, the batter would have been way too thin. When warm, the cake was very bland, but after spreading the glaze over the entire surface and allowing it to cool, it was okay. Good thing I made a backup batch of another type of bar for my family gathering.
