I have never soaked my oysters in water and won't again because the flavor was not as prominent as I prefer.  I will continue to use the oyster juice to help the dry ingredients adhere to the oysters.  I will make these again and add Â½ cup of flour to the cornmeal mixture.

Golden and crispy.  These look and taste great.  I did add a cup of flour to the mix and left out the garlic.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a good recipe but way too much salt.  Cut the salt by more than half.

The spices in this recipe take away from the oyster flavor.  All you can taste is the hot seasoning....I was looking for a simple fried oyster recipe that let me taste the oysters. This is not the one.  
Very disappointed.

Very good recipe.  I used half the amount of the cajun seasoning due to personal preference and used flour instead of the cornmeal for the same reason.   The results were a beautifully fried oyster.  I will be using this recipe again in the future :-)
