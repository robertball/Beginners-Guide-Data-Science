I wasn't sure I was going to even like this, but I thought it was pretty good! To speed up the cooking process I used the 90 second pre-cooked wild rice. I grind my own meat, so I sent all the ingredients for the meatballs through my meat grinder to ensure a texture that didn't have chunks of onion. For even faster preparation I chose to cook the meatballs in my instant pot. This was a quick meal to make, and I'm impressed by how good it was.

We loved this! I did add an extra can of mushroom soup to the mix b/c the family likes a lot of gravy/sauce to go over the mashed potatoes, lol. I really liked the texture of the wild rice in the meatballs and the slightly nutty flavor that it added. Great flavor all around! These were perfect served over the Idahoan Signature Mashed Potatoes. I will def be making this one again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was excellent and husband approved!  Per other suggestions we doubled the sauce, that's the only change I made! Tip about the onion though.  The measurement for 1 small onion is subjective so I used about 1/2 cup finely chopped. Thought that was about perfect, the meatballs weren't overpowered by an oniony taste. Another tip, I was tempted to use an egg to help bind the meatballs but it's not needed, the rice did the trick perfectly!  Lastly, be sure to cook the sauce at least 30 min per the instructions.  I kept tasting it along the way to check for any seasoning adjustments and it took about that long for the alcohol to finally dissipate. Overall, a fantastic dish with no changes needed.  I'll be adding to the rotation.  Thanks for a great recipe!

The whole family loved this! We used wild rice we harvested ourselves from our tribal lands. I used less salt and doubled the sauce like others suggested. I'll definitely be cooking this often.

I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because 2/3 cup a wine was too much. I thought the  wine would reduce and evaporate, but that's all I could smell once they were done. And you could really taste it. Other than that, they were dynamite!

Save even MORE time, using pre-cooked meatballs and box packaged Wild and White Rice mix.!!  Focus on DOUBLING UP the yummy sauce; this really is the key ingredient.  Use vineyard white wine ( the bottled "cooking" wines have way way too much sodium content ); toning DOWN from 1/2 teaspoon of salt helps, too.  Serves up good with mashed potatoes, your fave pasta OR can stand alone  on it's own, alongside well made veggie sides; that's your call.

Delicious! Didn't make too many changes-I used shallots and dried parsley in the meatballs and a little parsley added to the sauce. Everyone loved it! I served it with Hungarian noodles. Thanks for sharing this recipe! I will make this again for sure!

This was quick and easy on a weeknight and it was pretty tasty.  Instead of sage in the gravy, I used an herb blend that I tend to like on veggies (Penzey's Mural of Flavor).  Also used the 90-sec quick brown/wild rice pouch from the supermarket to save time.  Served with mixed veggies. Everything took about 30 min start to finish.

Very good sauce but my husband and I both didn’t like the hard texture of the rice in the meatballs. Next time I will make them without the rice because rot really doesn’t need it. Also I made real mashed potatoes to go with it.

I LOVED this and my family did too. Only change was to double the mushroom gravy and used extra butter when sautéing the mushrooms. I will make again. I think it would be something different than a standard hot dish that you would bring to a family in need of meals.

This was pretty amazing.  I doubled the sauce and made my own potatoes. Really excellent flavor.   I added the extra milk to the gravy and used dry vermouth. A+. It was my first time using wild rice.  It takes about an hour to cook. .  Plan ahead.

This was so good! I loved it as an alternative recipe for meatballs!
Made the meatballs exactly as directed (subbed milk and cream for the evaporated milk: 2T cream, rest, milk) baked for extra time in oven, probably about 25 minutes.
Made cream of mushroom soup from Pioneer Woman's recipe, and it was so good I didn't even add the rest of the ingredients for the sauce! I will next time though :)  
Served with extra wild rice and cauliflower.

I followed the recipe exactly, just made the meatballs bigger. My husband loved them! Even my son, who won't eat mushrooms, picked the meatballs out of the sauce, triee them and gave a big thumbs up!

Didn't have wild rice, so used leftover white and Jasmine.  Didn't have mushroom soup but had Cream of Chicken.  Worked well and was delicious!  Will definitely make again!

Eh, not great and not bad. I think it was too much work for such a bland taste. I think 2/3 cup of wine is too much and deflects the taste.

This was pretty good. I made it as written, except I didn't have any sage. Meatballs were very moist and sauce was delightful. Might double the sauce next time, just to have more for potatoes..

I followed the recipe, but my meatballs didn't hold up very well after they were transferred into the sauce. It had the appearance of beef stroganoff. The flavors in the meatballs and sauce are good, so I will definitely make this again...just with some tweaks.

These meatballs were something special.  They really had that extra flavor that is typically missing with meatballs.  Didn't have wild rice, so used jasmine rice.  Husband can't have dairy, so used 1/4 cup Blue Diamond unsweetened almond milk in place of evaporated milk in the meatballs (the type of almond milk is important, as other types give too much almond flavor or sweetness in your cooking); and rather than the cream of mushroom soup (which has dairy), used the butter (we use Earth's Balance spread, which is dairy-free, and tastes wonderful) with a couple tbsp. flour (no gluten for my husband either, so used white rice flour), and slowly poured in 1/2 cup almond milk to make a roux prior to adding mushrooms.  I know some don't like others rating recipes when they don't follow them exactly, but those of us that deal with food allergies have to.  Delicious!!!

Super delicious BUT... as another reviewer mentioned, these took forever to cook in the sauce. Much longer than the 30 minutes in the recipe. I wish I had pre-baked the meatballs a little longer and cooked fewer in the sauce--it was overcrowded in the pan. Maybe 2 batches instead? I ended up cooking it for about 20 minutes longer at low-medium heat, covered, after breaking apart the meatballs.

I don't normally bother with recipes that call for canned soups but I'm so glad I tried this one. This is really, really good- even the husband liked it. I followed the recipe exactly. Since there are only the two of us, I had half of the meatballs left over, which I froze. Like other reviewers advised, I did have to make another batch of gravy when I thawed to use. We had these first on (real, not boxed!) mashed potatoes and next on wide noodles- we both preferred the potatoes.

These meatballs were great. I ended up using quinoa instead of rice bc that's what I had cooked, and it was so tasty! saving this one in the archives.

This was simply amazing. I did not make mashed potatoes because I thought double carbs was a bit of an over kill so I made extra wild rice. Next time I will swap out the cream of mushroom soup for heavy cream because I think it will make a more decadent and rich sauce.

I did not make any changes, very good flavor, liked the sauce. I will make it again but will sauté the onions before mixing with the ingredients. I made this ahead and reheated covered in the oven 30 minutes @ 350.

I was quite happy with this recipe. I was a little strapped for time and made the following changes: simmered the meatballs for 15 minutes instead of 30 since they were already cooked through from browning in the oven and used canned mushrooms (this was mostly to appease the family but it still cut down on cook time). Next time I'd double the amount of canned soup so there'd be more sauce. If you're using regular sodium soup, like I did, don't add extra salt or it'll be too salty. The  Idahoan Signature™ Russets Mashed Potatoes were a delightful upgrade from the standard store-brand boxed mashed potatoes and I liked that the packet was resealable since we're a small family and didn't need a lot of potatoes (although next time I'll probably make the whole packet anyways!)

This was very good.  I only use 1 pound of ground beef and it still made a lot of meatballs.  I froze 1/2 of them to use another time.  Just make the sauce and I have a quick, tasty meal.  Next time may serve the meatballs and sauce over noodles, but the mashed potatoes were very good.  Followed the recipe except that I too used Uncle Ben's microwave wild and brown rice.

Made it exactly as directed. Very good! I think I'll use less water or wine next time just to make the sauce a little thicker.

Great recipe and very easy to prepare. I doubled the gravy just because we are gravy lovers!!! I think next time I will cut the salt a little, the gravy was a little salty for my taste.I added a little bit extra of the can of soup.  The wild rice makes the texture of the meatballs perfect. Mixing the gravy with Idahoan Signature™ Russets Mashed Potatoes is heavenly.

I normally don't use canned soup mix but this is a good quick dinner if one is running late from work.
I changed the recipe by using one egg in the meat mixture,  oats instead of bread crumbs, 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and adding 1 teaspoon of beef bullion concentrate to the sauce. 
It turned out nicely. Not the healthiest meal but good for a treat once in a while.

This was very similar to my Mom's recipe for Salisbury steak which I have always loved but the rice was a different touch.  I had a micro. container of wild and white rice which I used and it was fine.  I think if anything it maybe could use more sauce if putting over anything, maybe double the sauce ingredients or just add more low fat milk and white wine to stretch it .  thanks for this great addition to my recipe box.

Didn't have wild rice, used brown rice instead. This is a very easy recipe to make. It is savory and very tasty. I will make this again.

I really liked these a LOT! Next time I may double the gravy /sauce because it was SO good & I'd like more of it. I'll definitely make these again!
