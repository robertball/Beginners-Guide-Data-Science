I grew up making Divinity with my grandmother for ever holiday that came along plus.  It was definitely a labor of love.  As someone helped themselves to my KitchenAid Mixer and double boiler when I was moving, I thought this might be an easier way to bring a bit of old home into the holiday.

It took 8 1/2 minutes in the microwave, checking temp and stirring every three minutes, not just 3 as stated.  

While it doesn't compare to the tried and true full recipe, it is good.  

A nice variation is to take maraschino cherries. dry them so no excess moisture remains. Chop them up and add in after the vanilla,it is all mixed.  It turns the divinity a pale pink and makes for a nice change.

times (both cooking & beating with mixer were way under actual time needed --7 min cooking & 14 min beating still left it a bit sticky) flavor was good  & recipe is still much easier than traditional so I will probably make it again modifying the time accordingly.

I nuked the sugar mix for 7 minutes and beat together for 8 minutes.  It wasn't drop ready, more like peanut brittle where it has to set up in the fridge.  I poured it out onto wax paper in a cookie sheet and popped it in the refer.  Very tasty, and reminded me of my Grandma's!

it turned out perfect. Just use your thermometer to reach hardball stage and beat with mixer on high until it looses it's gloss. I even added walnuts. It's beautiful and I'm not all exhausted
