Stop here, do not pass go, do NOT collect another recipe for double chocolate cookies!  These are the best... I rounded the recipe totals up a fourth of a cup and used ghirardelli semi-sweet and white chocolate chips as well as walnuts.  The great thing about this recipe is that unlike others these cookies remain moist days after you bake them, so they are always gooey.  I cooked mine 8 minutes.  Don't worry if they seem too soft, they are perfect!  I baked them yesterday and my husband and friends ate them all already!  This recipe is a must try!

These were "ok". I definately think you need to use Dutch cocoa powder b/c regular Hershey's just makes the cookie taste like cocoa powder and chocolate chips. After all the great reviews I was really disappointed that all I could taste was cocoa and nestle choc. chips. I may make them again w/ Dutch cocoa powder and decrease the choclate chips a bit.

I made these for my mom who is a total chocolate lover and she really liked them.  I baked them for a little under 7 minutes so they were a little softer. These cookies are perfect for people who really like chocolate.

These tasted wonderful.  I used dark chocolate cocoa and they came out great.  Rather than dropping them from a teaspoon I found it worked better if I rolled them into balls and then flattened them.  This gave them a much better shape and appearance.

These are all right.  Not the best chocolate chocolate chip cookies, but not bad either.  I thought it wasn't sweet enough.

Oh my goodness!!These are great cookies. Even better if you enjoy them with a glass of milk. I used Reeses Peanut Butter baking pieces instead of chocolate chips and left out the nuts. Baked them for 7 minutes and turned out perfect. Leftovers are still soft and chewy. Yummy yummy!!

I really enjoy this recipe. I took a bag of these to work to put into a food basket we were all donating to and they almost didn't make it into the basket. Everyone loved them and wanted the recipe. I have made this recipe more than once and always line the baking sheets with tin foil and always add 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips since I don't put the nuts in. This makes all the difference in the world.

Awesome, quick and easy recipe - I used a half cup more chocolate chips in place of the walnuts.  These cookies are so soft and cocoa-y and not too sweet.  They remind of cookies you'd buy at Mrs. Fields or The Cookie Factory.  I love the way they stay thick as they bake too.

I modified this recipe to make Chocolate roll out cookies. I leave out the chocolate chips and nuts.
I double the recipe and add an extra cup of flour. Bake for 7-10 min. 
Makes about 8 dozen. Tastes great--like a tiny brownie!

Big, soft and chewy - just the way I like my cookies! I omitted the nuts (only because I didn't have any). They stayed nice and soft and were not at all dry (a problem I usually have with chocolate cookies). I will def. be making these again!!

Very good! Although, I ended up doing more cookie bars because after my first cookie sheet cooked too long (wasn't paying attention) and stuck to the sheet, I just poured the rest of the batter into a 7x11 dish and cooked for around 25 minutes. Very tasty! I left out the walnuts and it was still fine.

These cookies are nice when cooked for just 7 minutes, crunchy on the outside and moist inside. I added peanuts for a different taste/texture.

Being snowed in I was in the mood to make cookies and chose these. I had to use white choc. chips and no nuts, which is what I had. Very tasty and will make again with correct ingredients.

These are incredibly moist, rich, and brownie-like. What's not to like?! 
I used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa and experimented by adding holiday M&M's, mini peanut butter cups, etc. They are good with just about any add-ins you can think of. These will definitely be a reapeat.

If you want death by chocolate, this is the way to go! This is a great recipe.  The only thing I did different is I used ghirardelli double chocolate chips and nestle toll house cocoa and that is because those are the brands I generally use. They turned out great!

Very good cookie, did not find them to rich at all. Only put in about half to 3 quarters of the chips that was called for. Had no problem with the cookie sticking or not raising, in fact they turned out great. The nice thing about this cookie it stays fresh and soft for quite a while, so its great to have on hand in case company comes over. Will be making this cookie many times. Thanks for sharing, Elaine

These cookies are whopping chocolaty---definitely deep and dark!  The cookies turned out soft, crumbly, and brownie-like.  Nuts are a good addition and complement the flavour and texture.  Very tasty.

very good.  I did substitute Hersheys mint kisses that I grated in my processor for the semi-sweet chocolate chips.  My family liked them this way a lot, but I think they will be great with the semi-sweet choc chips too.

For a novice baker like me, the recipe was easy and fool-proof.  Best of all, the cookies were delicious.  Instead of chopped walnuts, I added dried cherries and that really brought out the sweetness and the richness of the double chocolate.

These are great!  I read reviews that they tasted like cocoa powder, so I only used 1/4 cup of cocoa, and I used chocolate chunks instead of chocolate chips.  these were a big hit with my family, and I will be making these again!

This is a chocolate lovers dream come true.  
I doubled the recipe, used a cookie scoop, it made 70 - two inch cookies.  This is a must if you like the taste of cocoa.

I had never made chocolate chocolate chip cookies before.  I was concerned because the batter seemed "thin".  Well, there was no reason for concern, these cookies are fantastic!  I had to bake mine longer than 7 minutes.  I watched for the tops to lose their glossiness, and they were perfect! My husband is especially pleased!

did some flattened like peanut butters and some mounds.  the flattened ones need the milk or coffee. these are great chocolate cookies. I used pecans and since I didn't have choc. chips,  I cut up Hersheys candy bar into the dough.  VERY  good cookies

Very rich, very awesome chocolate chocolate chip cookies. Great for chocaholics!!!! A fun addition is a teaspoon of peppermint extract. It makes them even better IMHO.

This was exactly the chewy inside, crunchy outside chocolate cookie I have been looking for.  I did not have any cocoa powder, so I used a 1/2c. Nestle Quik powder.  It did not have a dark, rich chocolate taste, but still was super yummy.  When there was about a minute left to bake, I put a Ghiradelli peppermint/chocolate limited edition square in them and put back in the oven to melt into the cookie a bit.  Cool them well so the chocolate sets up again.  A recipe that stays in my recipe box for good!

Really yummy brownie like cookies! They didn't last long. But if you are making these cookies for a crowd either double the recipe or make smaller cookies, defenitely don't use heaping teaspoons, I did and it only made 2 dozen.

These cookies did not come out well for me.  I followed the recipe, but the batter was so gooey I could hardly make the cookies.  The taste was good, but since the batter was so thin, the cookies literally were paper-thin when I removed them from the oven.

pretty good, but not that great.  I don't know if i did something wrong, but my cookies came out dry and cakey.  maybe a little more butter next time?  My boyfriend loved them though.  He ate 20 or so in one sitting.  
I also think they would be better with more walnuts.

I followed the recipe exactly. An hour out of the oven, it was perfect. Soft and chewy. After 8 hours, the cookies are harder to chew. Maybe it was not meant to be stored in an air tight container? I don't know. I still have some batter left in the freezer. Next time I bake it, I'll make sure to finish it off fast. 4 star because the the rich chocolate taste.

YUUUMMMMMYYY!  Used a medium cookie scoop (2T).  Made batter and baked exactly as directed.  Perfection!  I love chocolate -- dark chocolate.  I've often been reduced to eating just chocolate chips to satisfy my craving.  This recipe is one better -- chocolate and a fabulous chewy texture.    I've made them without the added chocolate chips, still awsome!

Incredible! I used pecans instead of walnuts, and added about 2t instant coffee after the eggs, which upped the decadence even more. They took a little longer to bake for me, about 10-11 min., but most of that's probably just my baking stone warming up. I will be making these again and again and again...

Wow! These are so good it's just wrong! I don't know how anyone got flat cookies from this recipe. I was worried they were gonna be too puffy, but when they were cooling, they flattened out just right. I have never made chocolate-chocolate-chip cookies before, but I don't think I will ever need to try another recipe.

This recipe is listed in the "Hershey's Chocolate Lover's Cookbook" that I purchased in the mid-nineties.  It was one of the first recipies I tried and is still one of my favorites.  I have taken these cookies to countless work/social functions and they always disappear in a flash.  I can't count the number of times I have been asked for this recipe.

Two words - chocolate nirvana!  Update: I made these again today with peppermint baking chips and white chocolate chips and they are awesome that way!  So many great ways to enjoy this cookie!

These cookies were very delicious.  I hardly ever bake.  They were easy to make and everyone loved them.

I personally thought the cookies were a bit cocoa-y myself (and used Droste cocoa - Dutch processed and my favorite). However, my three male roomates and a man I'm dating absolutely LOVED them. Instead of chips, I cut up semi sweet chocolate squares, cause I like my chocolate bits chunky.
