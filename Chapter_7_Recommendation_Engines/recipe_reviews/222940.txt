Wow - this is delicious! We are low-carb, so I used Stevia instead of sugar and left out the stuffing - and it was PERFECT! Huge hit - thank you!

Couldn't find spinach at the last minute, so I substituted mixed spinach and lettuce.  Didn't seem to make any difference, people LOVED it.  It was excellent and I followed the original recipe for the dressing.  I really don't like yellow mustard, but decided to go ahead with it because of the tang.  So glad I did, it wasn't too mustardy at all.  The only thing I changed was cooking the onions in with the bacon.  I will definitely make this again!

Excellent Salad.  I did not have any stuffing so I added some slivered almonds and tomatoes.  Also did cut the sugar in half.  This is a keeper.

I wanted something different from what I usually make and this was perfect.  I  left out the stuffing because I wanted something lighter and it was really good.  I will be making it again as hubs had seconds.  Thanks for the recipe.

Made as written with one exception and that is that I only used 1/4 cup of sugar instead of 1/3 cup. I only made the change due to personal preference. From past experience I've learned that we like equal ratio of sugar and vinegar. This was excellent! If you are like us and there is only two of you, keep your dressing separate an add it to your individual servings to keep the spinach from wilting.  This one is a keeper!

Tasty, tangy salad dressing and a delicious combo of toppings make this salad delightful!  My husband and I loved it.  I wouldn't change a thing.

This salad was amazing! It can be great as a dinner on its own or as a side dish. I will absolutely make this again!
