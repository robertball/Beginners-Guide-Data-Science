This review is for the cupcake only, as I chose to use another frosting, "Smooth Buttercream Frosting," also from this site. I thought I might like this cake mix eggnog cake recipe better than the one I tried yesterday, as this one included butter and the other did not.  I did not find this greatly improved - even with a 1/4 cup of butter and four eggs the cake was dense, but wimpy and spongy. Further, I found 1 tsp. of nutmeg in addition to what is probably in the eggnog, to be overkill. Half that much would have done nicely.  The cupcake, unfortunately, was probably saved by the excellent buttercream frosting I chose to use.  As this recipe's first reviewer, I wish I could have rated it higher.

While I haven't made the frosting yet, I wanted ot review the cupcake. Some eggnog cupcake recipes result in a dense cupcake. In anticipation of this, I mixed the batter for 2 minutes at medium speed. The cupcakes came out light and fluffy with a nice eggnog flavor. Also, I used only 1/2 tsp nutmeg.

I don't know what happened tbh. the cakes turned out great! the frosting however looks like it's separating. could have been a number of factors, didn't cool the flour/eggnog mix long enough/ properly, (i threw it in the freezer for a couple minutes near the end,) didn't use an electric beater, melted the butter, added food coloring... either way, it's only an image thing. the frosting tastes just fine. add some chocolate sprinkles to the top and it almost looks intentional lol.

not a fan of out of box cake mixes. might try this again with a yellow cake recipe!!

I made these for Christmas party. I was surprised when they were done cooling they had fallen. Prior their were fluffy and high. However, after breaking them open I found they were not dense and looked fine. I tasted them and texture was fine. I filled in the divot with the recommended frosting. They were a hit. I will make them again.

I didn't have a yellow cake mix so used the white one that I had. They were very good. I would make these again. I took 1 doz. to my sister's work and they were a hit. For the frosting I made Wilton's buttercream recipe using eggnog instead of milk and 3/4 teaspoon each of vanilla and rum flavor.

The cake was a bit heavy, but still tasty.  Disapointed with the frosting which after a few hours drooped off.  Next time I will try the butter cream frosting suggested by another reviewer
