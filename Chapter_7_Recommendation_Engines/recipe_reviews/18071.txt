My family loves this salad for dinner, especially during the summer when it is hot. I make my own ranch dressing and make several additions: chopped tomatoes, cucumber and green onion, sliced black olives, and avocado.

My review for this recipe disappeared! This is one of our favorite meals in this house. Any kind of ground meat will work (I usually use ground turkey or chicken), I make my own taco seasoning/ranch dressing and I like to use organic black beans in place of the kidney beans. Sometimes, I'll mix a half cup of homemade salsa  into the ranch dressing. Any kind of chips will do--we alternate between Doritoes, Fritos and chili-lime tortilla chips. Because I eat low carb, I skip the chips on mine and double up on the lettuce. This is also a great way to use up leftover taco meat from the night before for a quick lunch. You can layer them so everything is ready to go in the container--just make sure that you seperate your dressing or make it so the dressing is on the bottom and not touching your lettuce otherwise it will wilt quickly.

I love this recipe. We always make it for any gathering. The only thing we do different is the dressing. We use Creamy Italian, preferrably Seven Seas or Kens. We have also used Catalina dressing. But I prefer the Creamy Italian.

This is so simple and so good! I usually brown a chopped onion with my ground beef. Also, I add in a drained can of petite diced tomatoes. I have used different dressings and pretty much use either Ranch or Catalina. I have also subbed Fritos for the Doritos. I added shredded lettuce once, but would not recommend unless you know that it will all be eaten immediately. I usually have a carton of sour cream and also some chopped green onions for garnish.

We really like this taco salad, my son said he would eat it, if I made it without the beans!  It makes a very large salad.  I used the ranch dressing with sour cream in it, it was very good.  My husband had lots of compliments.

Simple and delicious! Plus it didn't take long to put together. I used "Taco Seasoning II" to brown the ground beef.  I also added some avocado and sliced black olives along with the cheese, lettuce, tomato, and sliced green onion.  I opted for plain tortilla chips vs. nacho flavored and used "Smoked Paprika Vinaigrette" from this site as the dressing. All that was left to do was add a well placed dollup of sour cream - fabulous for a tasty weeknight meal!

When this came out as a cooknik recipe for November, I tried it and my family loved it. I used doritos natural white cheddar nacho chips because they have no hydrogenated oil. Instead of mixing all together in 1 bowl, I let my family assemble theirs individually. I also had pico de gallo, avocado, jalapenos and sour cream available. Ranch seems wierd on a taco salad, so we used 1000 island mixed with the pico de gallo. Everyone had fun making and eating them.

This salad was great!  I made a few changes.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef, corn tortilla chips instead of nacho ones, and catalina dressing instead of ranch.  Also served it with sour cream.  Great dish for a potluck!

I thought this recipe was very good.  I used Fat Free Italian dressing instead of the Ranch. My Husband really liked it and said it's a keeper.

I love this recipe because it is so easy- and uses only ingredients I always have on hand. THANK YOU!!

Not bad..(made it exactly as printed here) but I have another recipe that I like much better.  My recipe has the ground beef simmered with the drained beans for 10 min and uses catalina french dressing.  Will go back to mu Old recipe...

I am really pleased with this recipe! I think it's really helpful to remember to cool the meat slightly (I added the kidney beans to the meat and cooled the entire pan) and then added the lettuce (I used a 16 oz. Salad Express bag, which worked great!) and then added the cheese.  I didn't want my cheese to be melted because I was looking for more of a "salad".  I used a finely shredded cheddar (Sargento's) and it was perfect.  The ONE thing that really helped this recipe stand out - I used the Ranch Dressing II from this site; it was fantastic!  Oh, and if you don't like a bunch of salt, really watch the type and number of tortilla chips used in this recipe - I used 3 of the one oz. nacho cheese "lunch" sized Dorito bags and found they added more salt than I care for - next time I will use chips with less salt.

This is a great quick summer recipe, and can be modified many ways.  You can use ground beef, turkey, or any sausage for the meat.  You can also used leftover shredded pork or beef.  You can even buy pre-made chicken or beef fajita.  I have used black beans or ranch beans in place of kidney beans.
If you don't have any taco seasoning, throw in some chili powder, cumin, onion and some water when browning the meat.  You don't need nacho flavored tortilla chips.  You can use any chips you like.  For the cheese, I prefer either Monterrey Jack or a mild Longhorn cheddar. For the dressing, I add ether a salsa or tobasco sauce to the ranch dressing to give it a kick.  If you need to get veggies down the children, roast some corn and add it to the mixture.
It would be rated 5 stars due to convenience but I like a little more spice in mine.

I probably shouldn't try to rate this because I made a three major changes.  I give it the full five stars because I'm sure the original is just as delicious.  First, I am a vegetarian and used Morningstar Farms Mealstarter hamburger.  Then, instead of commercial taco seasoning, I used my own homemade mixture.  I do not like either the chemicals or the amount of salt in the commercial preparations.  I used a homemade tomato salsa mixed into yogurt  for the dressing to painlessly cut down on fat and calories.    This version was a huge hit with family and friends.  Highly recommended.

Used refried beans instead of kidney beans, mixed it in with the beef after it was cooked.  Also used Italian dressing instead of ranch and some sour cream. Use the nacho doritos for more flavor. Super easy just mixed it all together, om nom nom!

Love this recipe and so does my kids, relatives and friends! I'm always being asked to make this for ppl and it's the easiest dish in the world to make. I do make a few changes though. First  of all, i use WISHBONE RUSSIAN DRESSING and I highly recommend trying this. it is sooo good, and I use a can of pinto beans and add chopped tomatoes. I also add a few drops of tobasco sauce to taste to the hamburger/dressing mixture. YUMMY!!!

Have  made this for my family for the past 15 yrs, and have given it to friends for just as many.  The only thing I do different is use Creamy Caesar salad dressing instead of ranch, it makes a delicious difference.

Been making this for years but with a few differences others may enjoy.  I use very lean beef (93/7) and add chopped onion while browning. I will also add corn if i have a left over cob from another meal. Instead of Ranch, i use a combo of salsa, ketchup and lite sour cream for kind of a latin 100 island. I also use padrinos reduced fat chips and 2% sharp cheddar. If i don't have kidney beans (which are my preference) black or pinto beans do in a pinch.

I thought this salad was great and very easy to make on a hot summer night.. Not low fat but you could modify it as I will for my vegetarian husband. Either tempeh or Yves ground round for ground beef. I would also subsitute turkey and use whole grain nacho chips.

I have made this recipe for years.  I use 1000 Island salad dressing instead of the ranch and add about 1/2 cup salsa to the dressing.  I also brown some onion with the ground beef.  I have avocado and sour cream for added toppings.  I find it better to assemble individually, because leftovers get soggy if you mix it all together.........and it's fun for people to do their own thing .

I thought this was DELICIOUS!  I was definitely worried about the outcome because I don't love ranch, but I tried it and I'm glad I did!  I did make some changes though--I used ground turkey, an entire can of kidney beans, much less cheese (probably less than a cup) and no chips--we just made the mixture minus the chips and served it in totillas.  I would definitely suggest adding all the ingredients minus the lettuce and putting it in the microwave for a minute or so because the cheese melts and becomes more of a creamy mixture.  I also added some other taco toppings such as chiles and black olives.  But a great recipe and the ranch isn't overpowering at all!!

I don't think its the best as far as taco salads go. Combining all ingredients in one bowl makes the chips go soft. Whats the point to the chips if not for some crunch? Will layer on each plate next time instead of combining into one.

This is just how I have made mine, but I mix ranch dressing with catalina dressing for the salad dressing.  About 1/3 cup of catalina dressing to 1 cup of ranch.  Very tastey.

Taco Salad is one of my all time favorite childhood dishes! We do ours a little bit different, instead of kidney beans I use a can of original Refried beans(heated of course). Also I use Taco sauce or Salsa instead of dressing. To top it off I add sliced black olives, mexican or cheddar cheese, and Sour cream!

This is also my mother in law's recipe for taco salad and we have been making it for years. When we take it to potlucks or 4th of July gatherings everyone loves it! I use red onion instead of green and add olives and a little fresh minced cilantro. We used to use the taco flavored Doritos but they are hard to find so the nacho cheese are good too. I know alot of people have mixed the ranch with the salsa but I have always just mixed the salad with the ranch and let everyone top their individual servings with the salsa. This recipe makes a ton so if I make this for dinner, I make everything and divide all the ingredients in half and store them in separate containers in the fridge and mix only half the ingredients together and do the same thing the next night so the salad if fresh and not soggy. Sometimes I find this salad a little salty/overpowering and wonder if I would prefer the Catalina but everyone (especially my husband) loves it and tells me I'm crazy and not to change a thing! Lol! Also, I think this salad definitely has to have the kidney beans in it, they lend a slight sweetness that is delicious! I think I will surprise my hubby and make this for dinner soon! Thanks for reminding me!

Sue's Taco Salad Haiku: "I wouldn't use Ranch. Otherwise, a great salad. (Can't keep leftovers.)" I'm glad that I made it a build-your-taco-salad-station night b/c otherwise, leftovers for this wouldn't keep and the dressing and chips would soggify. I let my husband guinea-pig it w/ Ranch, and we didn't like that at all (although I'm intrigued by some of the reviewers saying that they mixed a little taco seasoning, or chili powder, into their Ranch), so I went w/ Catalina. I was smitten w/ this recipe, b/c my mother-in-law, whose name is also Sue, introduced me to making taco salad this same exact way. The only changes that I made (other than using Catalina) was to eschew taco seasoning mix for AR's brilliant "Taco Seasoning I", swapping Doritos out for reg. tortilla chips, and adding some red onion slivers. I'm happy that I separated the salad fixins' so I can take some to work tomorrow b/c this was very tasty.

Received this from Cooknik and it is outstanding.  I made each salad individually in a bowl.  Used plain tortilla chips, mixed greens (My husband requested spinach leaves for a fuller texture the next time we make this), and added chopped avocado.  Hubby used the ranch dressing and loved it.  I used Catalina dressing and that is a wonderful combination for those of us who don't care for ranch dressing.

Absolutely delicious!! I made a couple substitutions (ground turkey for beef, corn chips for flavored ones) but everything came out wonderfully. The ranch dressing + taco mix combo is outstanding. The flavor resembles "cool ranch" chips or the "baja" sauce at a certain taco chain. Will definitely make this again!

We gave this one a 9 out of 10.  My husband absolutely loved it and the only change I made was to add olives and an avocado (they had to be used up).  Great dish - thanks for sharing.

As is, this is a GREAT meal. Instead of mixing it all together, we just layered it on a plate and allowed everyone to add their dressing on themselves. This allows you to do Catalina, Ranch, Italian, whatever you are feeling up to. Also, keeps the lettuce from wilting and makes leftovers an easy keep.
To make this lite - ditch the chips, use lean turkey or beef, fat free cheddar cheese, and low-cal ranch. I also added black beans to the recipe and think some spicy salsa would be nice though not needed.

A great salad dressing for taco salad is a mixture of 1/2 fat free French dressing and 1/2 salsa.

Love this recipe, it has been a summer staple for years in our house. I use corn, black beans, and tomatoes with a Catalina dressing with the taco meat. Doritos crushed over the top makes it delicious!

Very good.  This is how my Grandma used to make it.  I made 1/2 without the beans since my husband doesn't like beans.  He loved it.  I had the beans, ranch dressing and sour cream mixed in mine.  We had left overs so next time I will wait to add the doritos (chips) until we are ready for the left overs since they got soggy.

Every one loves this. Whit a few changes I add avocado and sliced olives. Also brown the meat with chopped onions,and use equal amounts of taco sauce and ranch dressing (sour cream works if out of ranch dressing) for the kick that makes every one ask what's the secret to your dressing.

Delicious and so simple! I don't eat beef so I replaced the ground meat with Mexican flavoured veggie ground round and it worked great. I also replaced the beans with black beans and heated them up with the ground round. A perfect summer recipe!

Great salad and easy to make! A few tricks/tips...instead of using the packet of taco seasoning which is heavy in sodium, opt for cumin/chili powder/red pepper to season for your liking! Serve the crushed chips and dressing on the side, in case you have leftovers. I didn't have the nacho cheese chips, but the regular tortilla chips did fine. I also added a cup of frozen corn (thawed).

I use taco flavored chips, no beans and catalina dressing. Gets rave reviews every time. Can't put the chips in until just before serving or they get soggy.

This was Delicious, but I used Catalina Dressing instead of Ranch and it brought out the Taco flavoring a little bit more.

Wow!  This is a blast from the past!  Went to college in the 70's, and this salad was a staple with me and the roommates.  Haven't had it in years, but plan to make it tonight!!  We used red onions instead of green, plain tortilla chips, and added olives & avocado.  Can't wait for dinner!  Thanks, Sue, I'd forgotten about this one!

this is really good i but even better when you add a lil salsa to your ground meat while it's cooking and then the kidney beans heated thoroughly... i used the taco seasoning to season my meat lil bit of onion powder and garlic powder. then added some taco seasoning to the ranch dressing to give it a kick and yum.

Sue...this is FREAKING FABULOUS!  I followed this recipe basically to the letter except I added sliced black olives and I followed a previous reviewers advice to mix the ranch dressing with salsa.  AMAZING!!!  So amazing that I actually forgot all about the cheese AND tomatoes until I was half way through my bowl.  I decided to add in the tomatoes (which raised my review even higher) but didn't even bother with the cheese at all since this was absolutely fabulous without it!!!  I hate Catalina and French based taco salads and this totally fit the bill.  Absolutely perfect!!  Will make this again and again.  For my children's version of this recipe (age 2 and 4) I didn't think they'd like a lettuce-based salad only so I made some rotini and mixed the taco salad in with some rotini in their bowls.  They both LOVED it!   Thank you so much for a wonderful new recipe that will now be a regular in our house.

I thought the ranch dressing would be an interesting twist, but I was disappointed.  Also, I would recommend regular corn tortilla chips (such as Tostitos) over nacho flavored.

So easy and economical.  Personal preference: used romaine lettuce, black beans and regular tortilla chips.  Make ahead leaving chips to add before serving.

This receipe is great! I have served this for many years and all love it. I do like that all have added some great ideas for avacado, beans ect. I also use catalina dressing, however, ranch & thousand Island sound great as well! Thanks all! The Kraft Garlic was awesome too but they took it off the shelf years ago. Wish I had a great receipe for a garlic dressing! Any suggestiions!

I've made this same salad for 30 years- but I add refried beans to my  meat  mixture and cool  it before crumbling into  the salad.. we like  catalina dressing.. I also add avacado and  black olives..when I  mix up salad, I then serve it on plates with a dollop of sour cream and salsa---I also serve a fresh fruit platter and  blueberry muffins to round a summer meal..delicious!

This recipe is good but it definitly needs some chopped avocado added at the end and a 4 oz can of sliced black olives.  Also - Green Goddess dressing really has a nice tang and our family likes it better than ranch

My family loves it when I make this.  We make several different variations.  We use Doritos, advocado, canned corn, black olives, & red beans for a variety of toppings to include the tomatoes & cheese.  For the dressing, we always use CATALINA FRENCH Dressing and Mild/Medium Taco Sauce.  TRY IT - sweet and spicy - yum yum!!

This is a great recipe--I've made it for years.  A variation I like is to use Catalina dressing instead of Ranch.  I also like to add chunks of avocado!  Yummy!

LOVED this!! Whole family loved it. I did use a can of chili instead of the kidney beans as that is what I had on hand. I also used fritos for the chips. I added the chips, tomato, lettuce to each bowl, then added the meat mixture so we could have leftovers without the chips getting soggy. (although we didn't, we at it all) LOL. Thank you for a recipe that my kids will actually eat!! :)

There are probably millions of taco salad recipes available, but I don't even bother looking at them because this one is a winner! It's one of the few recipes I've ever used where I don't change a thing. Can't wait to make it again!

Great tasting- I like it even after the chips have softened a bit!  I added ranch to the ground beef along with the kidney beans, and then made the salad individually.  Great!

This was delicious! We didn't use tomatoes (hubby doesn't like them) and used ground turkey, but I would go with ground beef next time for fuller flavor. We also added some fresh avocado, and that went great with it. This is incredibly, easy, budget friendly, and incredibly tasty! The ranch dressing is a great addition to the taco seasoning!

This taco salad was great! To make it low-carb, we had to leave out the chips and the kidney beans, but it was excellent nonetheless.  I used Green Goddess dressing, and will definitely make it again and again! Thanks!

In making this, cut back on cheddar cheese to 1 cup, used a whole can of kidney beans, and 1 tablespoon Taco Seasoning I by B. Echols from this site rather than store bought. We liked this but prefer San Antonio Taco Salad on this site (AR made this recipe private some time ago but still available if it was in a member’s recipe box). The main difference between these two recipes is that beans and salsa are added into the cooked ground beef in the San Antonio version which gives it a more in-depth flavor and it uses 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese. Sue’s version is so simple and extremely fast to prepare that we will likely use it again when short on time.

I followed the directions and this was really good. I just felt it was missing something. I might add olives and use sour cream instead of ranch. Overall, it is still a great recipe.

Simple, tasty recipe. You can't go wrong with a Taco Salad. Of course, they're are so easy to substitute with whatever you have. I have been mixing equal parts Ranch dressing with Taco Sauce for the dressing on all my Taco Salads.

Wonderful summer meal!!  My family and co-workers absolutely loved it!!  Since I'm on a diet, I modified it slightly by using low fat shredded cheddar cheese and I replaced the tortilla chips with french fried onions to keep the crunch. I added thin sliced red onions and used creamy Italian salad dressing. This was SO delicious!

I usually make taco salad when I have left over taco meat and add all the ingredients used in this recipe except I use ranch style bean or chili beans (no meat).  I make my dressing with ranch dressing, sour cream and salsa.

I have made something similar to this. You might consider trying this recipe with 1000 island dressing, its quite good! 
Very tasty. 
We would not pre-mix the meat, beans with the salad. Leftovers keep better if you keep the heated items seperate from the salad mix.

My family has been loving taco salad for years. We prefer plain tortilla chips or fry our own corn tortillas until crisp. The ranch dressing takes away from the mexican flavor so we use pcio de gallo or picante sauce. Avocados make a good addition and we do not put beans or use pinto to make it stretch.

I've made this basic recipe for over 30 years!  I use flour tortillas so it can be rolled up and eaten with your hands!  Also, use ranch beans instead of kidney beans and 1000 Island dressing but I'm going to try the ranch next time I make it.  I do chop onion, tomato, black olives and avocado to be added if desired as well as sour cream and chives.  It's yummy!!!

So simple, yet AMAZING! I withheld beans, but I added sweet corn and served with a dollop of sour cream, and mixed it with Catalina dressing... absolutely delicious!!! Definitely will be making this again soon!

An excellent, classic taco salad that's so quick and easy! I made it vegetarian by replacing the meat with black beans.

So easy! Taco anything is a great meal! I upped the amount of french dressing to 1/2 cup, and next time will add even more. I added black beans to the meat mixture and let it all simmer together for about an hour.

I was looking for something quick, easy, and tasty to make after work.  This was absolutely amazing!!!  I pretty much followed the recipe to the T with the exception of adding some sliced olives.  Also, I only added a few kidney beans to my portion as my husband does not care for them.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

This recipe is a keeper!  I made this for company using what I had on hand...ground turkey, Mexican style chili beans and ranch flavored Doritos. I cooked the onions with the turkey so that was done ahead. I served salsa on the side and everyone loved it.  We even cleaned up the leftovers the next day and just added a little more chopped lettuce and a few more chips.  Delicious!  Thanks, Sue

I used Doritos nacho flavor chips, and lime and salsa flavored chips. I used light marble cheddar cheese. This meal went over very well. I added too much Ranch to mine, but my husband loved his dinner, and had seconds.

Good recipe--just right for a light summertime meal. I had to leave off the beans for my finicky husband and I used more than 1/2 cup salad dressing (Creamy Buttermilk Dressing from this site). Subbed Fritos for the nacho-flavored chips. Thanks for sharing!

Very good salad. Filled us all up! I mixed some sour cream with salsa and topped our salad with it along with the ranch dressing. (I had mine with Catalina dressing, hubby and son had ranch) I used the entire can of ranch beans instead of just half. There were no leftovers with this keeper. Thanks for sharing Sue!

Made this salad and loved it. Easy to make . If making ahead just leave out the dressing & chips and add later.  Munched leftovers later the same day and still tasted ok. Haven't tried keeping it overnight yet.

Make sure you are cooking for a small crowd with this salad.  The only thing I don't like about it is that it gets soggy overnight.  There's no really good way to eat it left over.

mmmm absolutely delicious! I didn't have green onion, so I used a little bit of a yellow onion. I also cut some corn off the cob and added it in as well as some bell pepper. I wish I wasn't full so I could eat some more!

I keep the meat, salad, dressing and chips seperate until meal time.  I also add a can of sliced black olives.  Some prefer to top the salad with salsa and just crush the chips on top.

2 years ago I made this for a side dish at Christmas and everyone gorged themselves on it. The only thing I didn't put in was onions (not an onion fan), and I did change the dressing to a creamy italian. Have made it since and always enjoyed it VERY much. Thanks for the recipe Sue. It's in my file now.

I've made this for years and have a couple of suggestions to make any left-overs as good as the original.  First, fry the ground meat with some chopped onions.  When done add the kidney beans, any seasonings, and the cheese of your choice (I often use processed pepper jack cheese as it adds some flavor, replaces the need for Taco seasoning mix, and melts so nicely).  In a separate bowl, add dressing (I like Catalina) to chopped lettuce, using only enough for the number of people you will feed.  Place the lettuce mixture on the individual plates, top with the ground meat mixture, and garnish this with freshly diced tomatoes, diced green pepper, chopped green onions, and maybe some sliced black olives.  Serve tortilla chips in a large bowl for scooping up the salad.  No soggy left-over lettuce mixture or soggy tortilla chips.  Refrigerate left-over ground beef mixture for another day...  Perfect!

Followed the recipe with no changes. I was skeptical of ranch dressing and natcho doritos but the flavors together were better than using catalina dressing as I have in the past. This time Im  adding crumbled bacon  :)

I love this recipe for warm summer nights!  It's nice and refreshing and you don't have to stand over the stove for very long AND you can get rid of veggies easily without altering the taste too much.

However there are a couple changes I usually make when making this recipe...I use spices I have on hand (Chili powder, garlic powder, salt, cayenne and cumin to taste) instead of taco seasoning.  I toss in some finely chopped green peppers (since that's what I usually buy and never end up using!).  I switch between black and kidney beans, and sometimes use both.  I use Spanish onions as opposed to green because we really like onion flavor in this family and we use creamy Italian dressing, which we both prefer over the French.  

I also tend to mix everything but the lettuce, chips and dressing since we both like the lettuce crisp and the chips crunchy and have different ideas of what a substantial amount of dressing is...

Although this recipe is great, don't be afraid to play around with different veggies, dressings and chip flavors!

Good and quick Taco Salad.  I also added some avocado for some extra flavour and nutrition.

loved this!  I used multi-grain tortilla chips, jack & cheddar cheese, black beans instead of Kidney, and added avocados and fresh corn.  I bought three different salad dressings to try (creamy italian, peppercorn ranch and chipotle ranch) and Chipotle Ranch by Naturally Delicious was by far the best one for this salad!  Also, I think the scallions are a nice to have but not necessary.  I got SO MANY compliments on this dish when I brought it to a potluck.  Will definitely make again!!!

My mom made this when I was growing up and now I make it for my family.  I also add some salsa to it and mix together ranch dressing and thousand island dressing.  Also, we like red onion better than green onion.  It is a consitancy thing.

This was a simple but great recipe. The only thing I did differently was to allow others to add their own chips, that way the chips did not become soggy. Also, some people don't want chips in their salad and this is great without the chips. Thanks, Sue!

This can be as simple as you want it to be or you can get really creative. I made a homemade ranch dressing with fresh minced cilantro in it. I chopped a large variety of ingredients and let my kids pick what they wanted. Everyone was moaning with delight at the dinner table! My 4 year old said it was the bestest dinner ever! For the "meat" I used veggie beef strips that made it instantly vegetarian. Mmmmm, we are gonna eat this all summer!

this is a great recipe and my entire family loves it but  i do make a few changes like adding sliced black olives and using a sweet/red dressing instead of Ranch, for instance: Catalina or Western.  Enjoy!

Not a review because I haven't made this; had to comment because seeing it reminded me of the exact same salad I used to make, but with Catalina French dressing instead of ranch. Mmmm, I'd forgotten all about it! I think ranch sounds yummy, too. Fourth of July picnic, I'm thinkin'!

I LOVE this salad.. I've tried it several different ways.  I've used coleslaw dressing as well as sour cream & salsa rather than a dressing..always a big hit.

I wasn't sure about the whole ranch thing in the tacos, but I tried it tonight and this was very good!  It made it more salad instead of tacos.  This is going to be a summer dinner in my house! Thanks!  I heated a half can of refried beans with the meat instead of kidney beans though.

We really enjoyed this dish.  It's really nice for dinner on a hot night.  The only thing we found, was that it didn't taste too good the next day.  My advice would be to eat it all the same night, if possible.

Good taco salad base.  I changed things of coarse for my families taste buds, but a great idea all the same.  I used plain tortilla chips, a lot of lettuce, and no ranch.

Took this to a potluck and brought home an empty bowl.  It's a hit!  Threw some black olives on top.  Definitely use corn chips in the salad.  More authentic.  Eat Doritos later buy themselves.  This brought back fond memories of one of my fav'rit potluck staples a lady in our church was famous for.  Yeah!  Now I have my own!

How can you go wrong with taco salad?  I substituted heated refried beans for the kidney beans and we loved it.

Really good, but when I started to make it realized I didn't have taco seasoning so I wound up using enchilada seasoning and hot chili beans.  After surveying the pantry ended up using tortilla chips and chopped red onions.  Hubby loved it.  Makes a lot for two so shared with the neighbors.  Will definitely make again.

I too have had this type of recipe using Catalina dressing. I haven't made it for such a long time and couldn't find my original recipe so thought I'd use this. I was not making as big of recipe and yet it made a whole lot. I used only one head of iceberg lettuce and only a couple outside leave of green lettuce. For the dressing, I used my own concoction for ranch dressing using 1/4 cup each of light mayo, Fage plain Greek yogurt, and homemade Kefir milk. I used 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder and dill weed. The taste was nice and always a hit with kids. I also added black olives and used regular tortilla chips as many in my family do not like the flavored types.

I wish they had not said to pour in the chips!  I was planning on having this for lunch tomorrow too.   The chips will probably be all soggy, won't they?  I knew enough to not put the lettuce in but I didn't think about the chips until the very moment I started stirring them around.  DOH!

Great mix of ingredients for a taco salad. It was awesome. This recipe makes a large amount. I actually used a recipe for "Emily's Dressing for Taco Salad" instead of the ranch dressing and it really added the finishing touch.

Nice way to get my daily intake of vegetables.  This is one of those recipes where you need to assemble just before serving as it doesn't hold up well for extended periods of time.  Very tasty and easy to spice up if you want a little extra kick.

I love this salad, husband like it as far as taco salad goes, daughter won't eat it, and son loves the sauce but thinks it should have more "stuff" in it. He means black olives, etc. Fast and easy dinner.

This is an awesome recipe! Whenever I make tacos with ground beef, I always put the browned meat in the food processor with about 1/2 cup of salsa for 10 seconds. For some reason when the meat is really fine it tends to taste better, don't ask me why, lol. Really easy to make, I used sour cream and salsa as opposed to ranch dressing. Yummy!

I followed the directions for the ground beef pretty much to a T, except that I added in a drained can of Rotel. I also left all the parts of the salad separate to keep it from getting soggy. We used spinach mix for the greens, then topped with meat mixture, cheese and chips. I mixed a very small amount of ranch dressing with some salsa for mine and my boyfriend did the same but with sour cream. I think the way we had it made this a pretty healthy meal. I will definitely make again.

This is so good!! I loved the ranch in it. I wasn't sure how it would be! I only made one serving and changed a couple things for what I had on hand. I used leftover browned taco seasoned meat, I choose to use refried beans in place of the kidney beans, and threw in some leftover santa fe style rice with black beans and corn. I used some salsa because I didn't have any tomatoes on hand, and white onion in place of the green onion. Seems like a lot of changes but nothing major that really changed the flavor of the taco salad. Will use this recipe again!!! I also added some chopped pickeled jalapenos!!

My family loves this recipe. The only changes I make are to include a few things others have mentioned, like olives, avocado, and bell pepper. Ranch is great, but this recipe works well with Italian or even Thousand Island. I like to serve with a lime wedge.

I used ground turkey instead of ground beef.  Turned out fine.  I also used a cruciferous blend of kale and other crunchy veggies instead of just iceberg.  I made it for a party and it went over very well.  Will definitely make again.

Easy quick and tastes good.
I have added muted avocado to the ranch dressing.
One note about the corn chips.  Separate them from the rest of the ingredients so that it can be added next day without  having soggy chips.  I just sprinkle on top as we have on individual plate.

I quite liked this. I did as others recommended and only added the chips to the plate as serving and only mixed enough salad/dressing for serving so that the leftovers don't go mushy. The only reason this is rated down a star is because I found it quite salty so didn't finish my serving, and upon eating each part separately I discovered it was the ranch dressing I had used that was the issue. When I have the leftovers I will try another dressing - maybe a Caesar as I love that with anything. I recommend using a dressing you love and then you should love this dish as well.

I scaled this down and made it as a one-dish supper for myself, and it was great! I used the Smoked Paprika Vinaigrette dressing from this site, and it worked well (slightly sweet and similar to a Catalina dressing that others mentioned). I don't think I'd care for Ranch dressing here. I used Taco Seasoning I from this site with the hamburg. I also added avocado, black olives, black beans in place of the kidney, shredded Mexican cheese and very few (4) tortilla chips. What a great supper!

Easy, Quick, basic recipe.  I did this buffet style so everyone could customize:  had chopped greens mixture, black olives, shredded mex cheese, salsa,  guacamole (am going to do this with avocados slices too),  plain greek yogurt(instead of sour cream),  black beans and ground beef browned with taco seasoning and tortilla chips.  It was delicious!!

This is my "go to" recipe!! I add about 1/2 cup of medium salsa.  I add more salsa when I don't add tomatoes to the salad. I sometimes add re fried beans or drained canned black beans to the meat/taco seasoning in the pan for extra fiber. Cool Ranch Doritos are my family's favorite on this salad, but regular Doritos are good, too!

This is my favorite taco salad. The only changes I make - a tablespoon or two of mild salsa and a diced avocado. Perfect for a warm summer night!

Been making this for years, a family favorite!  
add sliced black olives and chopped avocado; 
use Taco-Flavored Doritos (now that they are available again); and definitely use WishBone Deluxe French Dressing.

this is my go-to taco salad recipe.  I have made it for co-workers, friends & family.  I even did this recipe for my twin brother a couple days before he was to get hitched for him and his (now) spouse's family.   easy to do in any kitchen.  Recommend this for everyone and all levels of cooking experience.

REALLY good recipe. I fixed it EXACTLY as written, my typical process. I would not change anything, NOT typical of me !!! This had a really nice balance of flavors, colors, and texture. OK .... I added just a sprinkle of crushed red pepper to the ranch dressing for a bit more kick. THANKS SUE!!

I have been making this salad for years, and it is a favorite of mine and my family.  I leave out the beans, and use plain tortilla chips, but everything else is the same.  It makes a lot, but a big plate goes down quickly.

Tripled this, we have a family of 7... Didn't use the beans or green onion, and it was absolutely amazing! Highly recommend this recipe, if your looking for taco salad. Also, really good, heated up later...

Awesome salad! I did make 2 changes as I am trying to add more turkey to the diet.  I added ground turkey instead of beef and calorie wise catelina dressing instead of ranch.

My family loved this salad! We had a late supper so this was light enough to have. Thx!! Gonna try cilantro, spanish rice and avocado with it next time.
