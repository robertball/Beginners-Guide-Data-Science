good marinade-however anyone that cooks meat knows you don't pierce meat prior to cooking as it makes the meat give off the juices while cooking. And let the meat rest after cooking to allow meat to redistribute the juices contained inside the meat.

I seldom marinate a quality steak but when I do, I do pierce the steak with a fork to allow the marinade to do it's work and I have never had a steak lose it's juices or dry out when poked PRIOR to cooking. And I have grilled many, many great steaks in my life. One hint: For perfect medium-rare steaks, grill for 10 minutes per inch -- 2 minutes on the first side and the remaining time on the other side.

I didn't use high-quality root beer, just whatever I could find. Also used a heaping spoonful of minced garlic in place of the garlic salt and fresh herbs instead of dried.

It was amazing! Made the meat super tender and juicy. Flavor wasn't overpowering but added just enough to make the entire table say, "mmmmmmmm!" at the first bite. 

Great marinade!

This marinate was amazing! Our steaks tasted so good, I savored every bite. The only difference I did not have root beer,so I subbed with Coke.It was still delicious and I would do it this way again! Absolutely perfect!

We used an eye of round steak which is a cheaper cut of meat.  This had such a good flavor and the cheaper cut of meat was quite tender.  I marinated overnight. I can't wait to try this on a better cut of meat.  I omitted the garlic salt and used minced garlic in the jar and onion powder for the onion salt, otherwise everything was as directed.

Mmmmm....Such a gooooood steak! 
I made a few changes, because I lacked supplies. I subbed onion salt for half a chopped onion, subbed the rootbeer for coke, and subbed the teryaki for soya sauce. And it still turned out delicous. Oh, and I also sprinkled a bit of steak spice, just cause we prefer a bit more peppery taste. It was so juicy and tender! Will definately use again!

Our steaks were juicy and tender.  This marinade certainly enhanced the flavor of the meat.  We loved that none of the ingredients overpowered the steak.

This is a pretty good marinade for grilling. I used A1 for the steak sauce and garlic powder instead of garlic salt (only because I love a lot of garlic and not a lot of salt). Also, I used T-Bone steaks because they were on sale at my local supermarket. Plus the root beer gave it a sweet taste in my opinion. Yummy. I will definately be using this recipe again.

NEVER, EVER pierce a tender steak like a rib eye at any time before, during, or after the cooking process! There won't be a bit of natural juices left.  This recipe is great for a flank steak or London broil because those steaks need help with juiciness and tenderness. I gave it three stars instead of five stars because of the advice to pierce the rib eyes.

To Twin Grandma: When you are tenderizing or marinating meat you always pierce the meat. Anyone that is a good cook knows this.

I have to make a comment on a review...   piercing meat prior to cooking is perfectly okay.  The cooking process will seal in the juices.  Do not pierce or cut meat during cooking and let meat rest for several minutes after it is cooked before cutting.  Great recipe!  I used fresh garlic and onion.

for the record, piercing before cooking is ok, just don't pierce during cooking or before resting the meat!

I have been trying several beef marinades this summer, looking for one that we liked. I can finally stop looking, this is it! I did make a few minor changes. I don't keep onion or garlic salt on hand so I used onion powder and minced garlic. I also used fresh herbs for the dried. Hubby said, "if you keep cooking like this, we'll never go out to eat again." Thank you!

I also used the rootbeer we had on hand. It was a nice change from what I usely use on the steaks. I also had T-bones not rib-eyes I don't know it that matters. We all like the taste of the steaks.

I did try this recipe but with a lesser cut of beef and it did enhance the structure but did little to justify the work.

i used soy sauce instead of teriyaki because that is what i had. i also used coke because i had no root beer. the garlic and onion salt i switched for powder. on the herbs i used oregano, red pepper flakes, cayenne. i also chopped up a jalapeno pepper, garlic cloves and red onions because i was making tacos. i had thin cut eye of round steaks and we know how tough those can be. i marinated for 2 days and oh my! i cooked them in a cast iron skillet until done all the way thru and they were so tender i couldn't believe it! made awesome steak tacos! i will try the original recipe when i get all my supplies stocked. this is a awesome marinade that i will go to again and again for those tougher cuts of meat. i also like that you can change up your herbs and spices to suit your taste or the cuisine you are having. thanks denis!

We are pretty firm when it comes to doing steaks, this marinade is GREAT! My wife found some "special" root beer at Walgreen's that made this recipe. We marinated three large boneless ribeyes from the "discount bin" for three days! They were one of the best steaks we've ever had!
  TRY IT! You'll like it!

Loved this! I'll definitely be using this recipe again and again. I did use coke instead of root beer because it's what I had on hand but I doubt that would make much difference. I've recommended this recipe to anyone and everyone I loved it so much!

A very delicious marinade.  The root beer added a fun element but make sure to not add extra as the sugars will burn. Overall it's a nice refreshing taste but doesn't have that wow factor.

Oh MY! This was great! I did make a few substitutes because I didn't have all the ingredients called for. This is a keeper! 
I didn't have root beer, so I used Pepsi. I didn't have teriyaki sauce, so I used a regular BB Ques sauce. I didn't have Garlic salt, so I used garlic powder and we left our steaks marinate overnight ( abt. 16 hrs.)

I might use this on sirloin or "London Broil" but never on a rib-eye.  For "good steaks" like rib-eye, NewYork strip or t-bone/Porterhouse I would simply use salt, pepper and garlic.  I'm just sayin'.  On a lesser cut--this is a terrific marinade.  You might even try it on tri-tip--although with tri-tip I like using chimichurri as a marinade.

Loved this recipe!  I used it on Sirloin, Ribeye, and New York Strip steaks.  I let all the steaks marinade for about 8 hrs. I had about 10-12 people that either got to try one or ate a whole one, and everyone loved it.  I had never thought of using those ingredients together, especially the Root Beer.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.

I thought it was amazing.  Used A1 not 57, but don't think that made a difference.  My wife thought the rosemary was too strong, but she's insane and hates rosemary so I don't listen to her.  The smell the steaks made when they hit the grill was awesome.  I used extra root beer so I'm not sure how much that impacted the end result.

I found the claim that the marinade would "enhance and not overpower the flavor" to be untrue.  Sorry...But my whole family disliked it!

OMG This marinade is the bomb! I didn't have teriyaki sauce so I mixed a little brown sugar in with soy sauce. Also I didn't add the root beer. We decided that we would make extra sauce for dipping next time!

Used this marinade with flat iron steaks. Very flavourfull and tender, but way too salty.  Will use garlic powder or onion powder next time.

Mediocore cut of sirloin that ended up good. Family could taste the root beer & teriyaki that they loved! I have been asked to hang on to this to try for better cuts of meat.

This is a GREAT recipe!  I have never been a big steak eater but that will change now.  I've made it a few times and it's the only way to eat steak.  As a tip, if you forget the root beer (we never have soda in the house) I have used water instead and then added a tablespoon or two of brown sugar (depending on the amount of steaks).  Enjoy!

This turned out juicy and delicious. I didn't have root beer so I used Coke ( as another reviewer suggested). The steak turned out tender and very flavorful. Everyone loved it.

Never marinate a high quality cut of beef. Salt and pepper is all you need. Now, if it is a skirt or tri-tip, then do so.

Really good marinade. We used this marinade on a giant leftover pork rib. I made the recipe for 2 servings. I marinated it  overnight to really soak up the flavor and then baked in the oven for an hour and a half. With more tender meat I probably would  have cooked it on the stove. Great marinade that I will definitely use again.

I marinated the rib-eyes all day while I was at work.  When we got home my husband threw the steaks on the grill and cooked them to medium.  They were mouth watering.  We baked potatoes and I made a salad to go with it.  It was as if we were at a steak house.

I normally don't care for marinated steak, but my husband loves them.  So when I saw this recipe, I decided to give it a try.  He won't stop raving about it and pronounced he wants all his steaks that way in the future.  I also enjoyed it very much.  I did make a few changes to the recipe...we don't have nor like steak sauce so I didn't add that and I didn't add pepper.  Otherwise made the recipe the same for petite sirloins.  Was outstanding!!!

Piercing the steak beforehand and using a sugary marinade are both big no-nos.  The sugar from the rootbeer will make the meat burn on a grill.  And not in a good char kind of way.

My teenage son is helping out with cooking this summer.  He got the steaks marinating a few hours before I got home.  They cooked up GREAT!  Wonderful flavor--super tender.  Looking forward to making this again.

I made this exactly to the recipe AND LOVED IT!!!  My family went nuts.  We used rib-eye steak, and marinated them for about 8 hours.   For cooking we did 7minutes on the 1st side and 4 minutes on the other side in a very hot grill.  The steaks were nearly 2 inches thick, and they were SO flavourful and juicy!  YUMMY!!

This was one of the best marinades for steak  we have tried.  We did not have the teriyaki sauce so substituted Amino's and were happy with the results.  As a bonus we found that even using it with country style boneless spare ribs the end result was tender and very flavorful.

These are tasty and, best of all, you can whip up the marinade the night before, place the steaks in it and leave them until ready to cook.  It does not overpower the taste of the meat and makes them very tender.

I did like the flavor that this marinate gave to our boneless ribeye steaks. Time did not allow me to marinate steaks for as long as I would have liked (close to an hour) and it was still tasty.  I will be trying again.

This is an amazing marinade, I will be using this many times over. I didn't have any Root Beer at home so used an open bottle of Coke I had on hand. I used the same old marinade for years, but times are changing this is a keeper thank you.

This marinade was okay. I agree not to use on a quality meat. Too many ingredients to sweeten the meat. It is unnecessary when having a steak. Let the quality of the meat speak. I would use this on a sirloin for kabobs or another type of meat like chicken, but a good steak?  No!

REALLY GREAT. This marinade made the juiciest steak. Very flavorful. I did not pierce steak ahead of time, and only had 2 hours to marinade. I used coke. This will be used many times.

Great marinade. I made this also with regular pepsi due to not being a big fan of root beer, and it was fantastic. Marinated the steaks overnight. A little on the sweeter side but we really loved it. Reminded me of our monday steak nights at a local favorite deckhouse here in Houston. I was always wondering what they used to marinate their rib eyes. Now I know. Will definitely do again. This time I will try this marinade on some thick pork chops. Should work just as well.

This type of marinade is great for London broil or cheaper cuts of meat.  The pop helps tenderize the meat.  Most important, let your meat warm up about 30 minutes before grilling to keep from getting tough.   I wouldn't use this on a prime cut of meat.
I decided to try this on country style beef ribs, no pop, no oil.  Let marinade 2 days only because it rained after day 1.  They were absolutely amazing!!!  Added barbeque sauce  at the end.

not bad ,I used it in a crockpot (last min decision ) so I probably should've used less or no oil and a little more root beer but I am a root beer fiend so just me, other wise whole house smelled great. thanks

Great, with changes.  Celery salt and garlic salt add way too much sodium to the end product; I added fresh minced garlic and all fresh herbs instead, and used a low sodium teriyaki sauce.  If you pierce the steak in a few places and let the marinade soak in for a few hours or overnight, the meat should still grill up nicely.  It is VERY important to let the meat come to room temperature before grilling (at least 30 mins to an hour outside the fridge) before cooking, and let it rest for at least 5 mins when finished grilling before cutting/serving the steaks so the juices can redistribute rather than just running out all over the plate.

I tried it with Canola oil. Terrible. Made it the next time with good Olive oil. Amazing! Just used this recipe with some great elk steaks, using olive oil, and they came out so good.

This is a good recipe but couldn't get the Canola or Root beer so used my old favourite - Olive Oil, with a well known Irish Black Stout!! Improves the flame quality

Try putting it in a ziplock bag. Squeeze all the air out. That way you don't have to pierce the meat. If you have a vacuum sealer even better. Leave marinate over night.

NO SALT for me thanks--I used 8 cloves of garlic, low salt soy, ginger, bourbon, citrus (I like orange), black pepper.
