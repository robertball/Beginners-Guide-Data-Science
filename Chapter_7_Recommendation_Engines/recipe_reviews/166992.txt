Added two extra eggs to stretch the meal.  Not enough spinach, added more (mine was fresh steamed), plus 1/4 cup fresh parsley and full cup of chopped onion.  Had some feta so I threw in a crumbled handful.  Added lots of spice - generous paprika and chili powder, plus 1/4 tsp garlic powder, basil, black pepper, and a little salt.  Left the butter out.  I will use this recipe again with the changes noted!

This is a great recipe.  I substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese and colby jack and mozzarella for 1/2 the cheddar.  My entire family enjoyed it - a keeper!

Nice basic recipe,but I would saute the onions first-I changed my casserole up a little using what I had on hand-red bell peppers and Italian mix cheeses as half the cheese,garlic,regular curd cottage cheese,fresh spinach and NO BUTTER-I sauteed all the veggies together first. After putting it in the glass casserole dish I sprinkled the salt and pepper on like it was an egg-that way I knew how much seasoning I wanted.My husband said it was the best he had ever had!

Following the advice of others, I skipped the butter, and boy am I glad I did.  I think with all of the cheese in this, the butter would have made it way too greasy.  I did also add some garlic powder to this and it was super delish.  I might add more spinach and onions to it in the future.

I doubled the eggs, doubled the flour, added no butter, added green and red peppers and it turned out great. It was super great and thicker in width. I added sausage on half of the casserole for my meat loving boyfriend. I would definitely make this again with a little changes of my own.

This is a very easy and good breakfast casserole.  As other readers recommended, I added two more eggs and left out the butter.  I also used half cheddar and half gouda cheese mix, because that is what I had on hand.  It was fantastic!  I think you could use any cheese combination to your liking.

Excellent. I sauteed the onion and spinach (and added a bit of garlic) in a bit of olive oil and left out the butter completely. We loved it and will be making it again.

This was really good! The only change I made was, instead of putting the cheddar cheese in the casserole... I let it cook for about 30 minutes, then I just put a layer of cheese ontop and cooked it the rest of the time. I liked it alot. And everyone agreed that it was also very good the next day for breakfast. Great recipe!

This is a GREAT casserole that I have been making for my husband and I to reheat for breakfast throughout the week. It's a really easy way to get a nutritious, hot breakfast without taking the time to make eggs each morning.   I did not use butter or salt, but added garlic powder and red pepper flakes for flavor. I also crumbled in a block of extra firm tofu. A great, healthy recipe that's easy to modify for variety!

I made this for a work breakfast for the first time, and was kinda nervous. But everyone LOVED it! Even a guy who has never eaten spinach, ate it and loved it! I thought this recipe was perfect as is. Will definitely make it again!

As many users suggested I used 8 eggs instead of 6 (still 1/4 c flour).  I caramelized the onion with garlic before adding to the egg mixture.  Also added steamed spinach (1/2 of a fresh 10 oz bag), artichoke hearts cut into small pieces, and sun dried tomatoes.

No need for the butter, the recipe is plenty rich without it.  I also cut back on the cheese and used about 10 oz of chedder and 2 oz of feta.  I was a little worried about the oil from the sundried tomatos making the dish oily, but it turned out just fine.

Great recipe.  I'll definitely make this again.  Maybe next time with some mushrooms and brie...

Very delicious.  Too much butter.   I made it a second time without any butter and it was still great.  A handy make ahead breakfast.

I sauteed the onions first, added two extra eggs, and substituted with some ricotta since I didn't have enough cottage cheese. I also added some garlic powder and left out the butter. This recipe is good enough to stand on its own, but easy to modify, too. I took it to a breakfast event and it was very quickly eaten. Thank you!

I scaled down the recipe to serve 6.  I sauteed diced onion, a clove of garlic, red-yellow-and orange bell peppers (about 1/4 of each kind of pepper) and added a couple shakes of hot sauce to the original recipe.  I only had about 4 oz. of cottage cheese.  I left out the butter.  I baked it in a round glass cake pan.  It was very tasty!  I don't think you can go wrong with whatever you do to change up this recipe.

Made this recipe as described, only substituting all-purpose flour with oat flour due to wheat allergies, for Easter brunch with family...no leftovers. That is saying something!

My new go-to recipe for brunch. Took others' advice and used 8 eggs and left out the butter. I added 1/4 tsp. salt but will prob do 1/2 tsp. next time. Used a combo of cheddar, Swiss and grueyere. Creamy, easy and delicious. My guests loved it.

Delicious!  After reading all reviews, I made following changes:  4 eggs as I only made 1/2 recipe; used cheddar and pepper jack cheeses; and added about 1/2 tspn of seasonings.  Made into 8x8 inch pan for about 35 minutes.  Very easy and tasty.  Kitchen smelled great while it was cooking.  Very versitile recipe and can use many combinations as other reviewers suggested!!!  Will definitely make again. A+

This is great and pretty simple!  I'm glad I read the reviews - the butter definitely is not needed;  I made some other slight  changes  - used 12 oz cottage cheese and 8 oz cheddar.  Also used fresh spinach which I sautéed with the onion and some red bell pepper.  Easy to modify for personal taste or ingredients on hand.  I really liked the texture too - a keeper!

Great base recipe... I used egg substitute & added 2 extra eggs. added 2 sections of shallots in addition to the onion/ shallot & sautéed with 1/2 chopped each zucchini and yellow squash and 1/2 c. crumbled bacon which I sautéed with the fresh spinach and a bit of EVOO.  I substituted sharp Irish cheddar.

This has become my go-to dish to bring to a brunch.  I double the eggs, don't add butter, and keep all other amounts the same.  I sometimes substitute Greek Yogurt for cottage cheese, and it comes out great.  I've added other vegis (mushrooms were my most recent) - again, very good.  If you're not a fan of cheddar, any cheese will do.

This was fantastic. I've made it twice now - both in a muffin pan for individual servings. I used 1/: the butter the second time and Monterey/cheddar mix cheese. The first time I used Swiss Guyere mix (which was SO good with the spinach). I think mix of cheese is up to preference. I also added a teaspoon of dried Thyme and no need for any extra salt. A fantastic recipe!!!

Fantastic recipe.  Boyfriend LOVED it, as did I.  He stated "Great for any meal". Agreed. I omitted butter - glad I did.  Added mushrooms. Placed tomato pieces atop before baking. Did not put cheese into the casserole.  Instead, I put cheese atop after baking 30 minutes - 15 minutes before done. FANTASTIC.

I enjoyed this very much, and look forward to making it again sometime soon!  Trying to stay "on plan" for New Year's resolution, I modified ingredients to better reflect goals: Reduced and low-fat cheeses, egg whites only.  Took it to a brunch potluck, and had several requests for the recipe!  One change I will make next time is to lessen butter by at least half, or possibly leave it out altogether, as others have mentioned.  I literally was ladling butter off the top of the casserole at thee end.  I also had put my dish on a cookie sheet to prevent any spillover, and I think it affected my cooking time, as I needed to add an extra 15 minutes.

This was excellent as is and can be easily modified. I sauteed the onions and substituted feta for some of the cottage cheese. It's like quiche without the crust. Tastes even better the second day.

This is wonderful. I've made it dozens of times and everybody loves it. It is so suitable for substitutions, too! I have a friend who is gluten-free, so I either leave out the flour, or toss in a little uncooked one-minute oatmeal instead. One time I didn't have cottage cheese so I used Greek yogurt. Like many others people, I don't include any butter - it's delicious without.  It's good for potlucks, and my favorite variation is with sliced tomatoes on top. It doesn't turn as pretty, but it sure is yummy.

I triple the amount of spinach, add two additional eggs & do not add the butter/oil.  I also use half cheddar cheese (or Pepperjack) and half hard cheese (Parmesan Cheese, etc)

I really like this recipe. I like how it tastes and how it can be so versatile. You don't always have to have the exact ingredients and it still works. You're short on cottage cheese or reg. cheese just go with it.  Need to stretch it? Add more eggs. Want it spicy throw in some jalapeños or some drained salsa. I've even put cream cheese in it when I was short on the cheddar cheese. I also use fresh spinach--just rough chop fresh spinach leaves and stir them into the mixture. Anything goes! Whatever I've done it has come out great. I've also baked it in cupcake tins and frozen the result to eat later. Also,  I do think it is better thicker so usually bake it in a smaller pan. .

I love this recipe! I changed it slightly to make it less calories, so that is why the 4 stars. Sautéed onions in 1T butter, used 6 jumbo eggs, half the cheddar cheese, 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, and no extra butter. Delicious! What a great taste to start out the day! Thank you for the recipe.

This is a great recipe. I sautéed the onions with some garlic, and then wilted 16oz of fresh spinach in there. Let it cool and chopped the spinach. I also added 1lb of crumbled bacon and a few extra eggs and skipped the butter. This was a huge hit at my brunch. I even made it the day before and then just reheated.

Family approved.  All of my guys loved it.  I substituted pepper jack, olive oil and onion salt.  I added some cubed ham.  They loved it.

I made this recipe with slight variations and gave it a "Cajun" twist. Everyone liked it! I did not have cottage cheese; so I used sour cream (10 ounces) instead. I also used a mixture of cheddar and Monterey Jack, about 8 ounces each. I omitted the onion and the butter, used 8 eggs instead of 6, used 1/3 cup flour, 16 ounces of spinach, and 1/2 tsp. dry mustard. Finally, I used K Paul's Poultry Magic (bottled seasoning) to taste. Note that this recipe (and other baked egg recipes that result in "flat" casseroles) make great leftovers. I keep the leftovers several days in the refrigerator, even a week, and use them in my panini maker for breakfast sandwiches. Yummmmm!

I made a few additions, but really loved this recipe. It was creamy and very flavorful. I sauteed my onion until soft in 1 Tbsp. butter then added some minced garlic, a small sprinkle of garlic powder and salt, and spinach until warmed. As I was beating my eggs with the flour, I added a few pinches of nutmeg. Besides that, I followed the rest of the recipe as written.

Excellent.  I'm going to make it again this week.  I love that it is healthy.  I used eggbeaters and lactose free cheese.  I obmited the butter and i was out of flour so i used corn starch!  Everyone loves this.  I also added some ground sasuage that I cooked seperate and drained. I used fresh spinach that i cooked and chopped. Just the best! This also freezes well for a quick breakfast.  Reheats in the microwave excellent!

I am a beginniner in the kitchen, but made this when we had guests for brunch and it turned out great.  I modified it by adding two more eggs, reducing the shredded cheese to 3/4 lb., increased the onions to 1 cup, and a little feta and parmesan cheese because I had it on hand. I'm also gluten intolerant so I used white rice flour which worked great. We thought the 10 oz. package of spinach was perfect for an 8-egg recipe.

My vegetarians and non-vegetarians all loved this casserole.  I added French's fried onions on the top for the last 5 minutes of baking.  I've also made it without the onions added, and it was great both ways.  Left overs are delicious, also!!

I've made this twice, and the first time it was well liked but the second time it was LOVED! Short on time and ingredients I pulled what I had from the fridge and did the following: 16 eggs, 1/2 cup flour, 1 cup chopped green onions, a ton of cheddar, about 1 cup feta, half a container of veggie cream cheese (in lumps), half a bag of fresh spinach, nutmeg, salt, pepper and baked as above. AWESOME!

I make this every year for Christmas morning. I have tried with raw and sautéed onions and in my opinion it is better with the onions going in raw. I do 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper.

I made this with 8 eggs instead of 6 because I used a  16 oz. bag of spinach & 1 cup of onion. The rest of the ingredients were the same the cheese: I grated an 8 oz. block of swiss cheese to equal 16 oz. shredded. I think swiss tastes better with spinach  than cheddar. My husband gave it a 10 out of 10!

I didn't use the onion or flour. I sautéed fresh spinach and mushrooms. My family loved it and my husband's aunt asked for the recipe.

Was very tasty! Husband loved it and he's not a big fan of spinach. I only changed the spinach for fresh  spinach . Used my food processor to chop it up along with onion. Will make again !

I love, love, LOVE this recipe. I have made it several times. After a friend's recommendation I use vegan shredded cheese instead. (Usually one bag mozzarella and one bag fiesta blend). I have found the vegan cheese melts nicer and is less greasy. I also do not use any butter. All of my coworkers love this recipe and have started making it for their families as well. Even my husband who hates cottage cheese and usually refuses to eat anything with cottage cheese in it likes this a lot.

I've made this several times for office potlucks. Everyone raves over it and it is a top request each time. Now, my co-workers are making it, too. The only change I've made is I increased the spinach to one pound. Delicious!!!

This is my go to recipe for large group breakfasts. i use it at church all the time. i usually add one egg white,  and maybe a seventh egg. I also season with Cholula in addition to salt and pepper,  but the recipe works great with no changes.

I eat my version of this almost every single day.  I make it a lot different but I use this as the base for cooking time especially!  I use grams since I track my food on another website, mfp if you know what that is. I don't think I can refer to other websites on here. My version has 8 big servings for 195 calories per serving, 6 g fat, 9 g carb, 2 g fiber,  3 g sugar, 26 g protein!!!  I heat up about 1 tbsp Olive oil and saute: 120.00 g, diced onion (1 med onion), 30.00 g, minced fresh Garlic (8 fresh cloves-love it), 256.00 g, frozen chopped spinach (1/2 of a large bag), and 
230.00 g fresh sliced mushrooms (about 8 oz container).  Season with 1 tsp salt to help get the moisture out now so the casserole isn't all soggy. I let that cook on high until almost all of the moisture is evaporated.  In a separate bowl, I combine:  336 g 1% Low Fat Cottage Cheese (12 oz-ish), 920 gram, Egg Whites 100% (the 32-oz carton).  Once the veggies are done, I put them in a parchment lined 9"x13" pan (I don't like cleaning up at all). Pour the eggs and cottage cheese over the top.  Evenly sprinkle the 60 G, Real Bacon Recipe Pieces, Oscar Mayer (much lower fat than regular bacon - about 4 tbsp) and 70.00 g shredded swiss cheese (roughly half of a 6 oz bag) over the top and bake at 350*F for 45 mins.  AMAZING... every single day :)

I have been making this for potlucks and has been the most requested for over a year! I use 1 pound of spinach and a little extra onion. I also put a panko crumb mixture with butter on top and bake it about 10 mins. longer.
Everyone raves over it!

Cleaning out the fridge so used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and added a package of mushrooms. Yum
Omitted the butter, sautéed the mushrooms and onions first, and used 8 eggs

Doubled eggs, increases onion to 1 c., and used a larger container of cottage cheese and spinach.  Omitted the butter.  Served this at a brunch and received great compliments.  I thought it was delicious.  I'm going to use feta cheese the next time.

It was OK. Way too much butter in my opinion. I'd cut the butter in half next time. It was very greasy with a 1/2 cup butter in it. The consistency was a bit softer than I expected too. Maybe less butter would help that. I'll try and report back.

As is I think the recipe is a 3. It is easy and flexible.

You can change it up and get creative with the spices. I use 8 eggs, no butter, less cheese (about a cup) and often substitute soy flour. The cheese usually has plenty of salt, no not much more is needed. I use jack and cheddar with a little parmesean, feta is a good add.

You can mix it up with mustard greens, kale or turnip greens instead. You can add spices, I add turmeric, paprika and stuff to punch up the flavor.

All in all is a good foundation, but needs some creativity to make it really good.

I used queso fresco (La Morenita) instead of cottage cheese, fresh spinach, half the amount of cheddar. My husband said this was one for my top 10! I really liked it too. Oh and I added three veggie hot dogs (Smart Dog), diced.

Wonderful for low carb diet. Never would've thought to add cottage cheese to a casserole. Very tasty. Added 2 cups fresh spinach and switched flour for almond flour. Great recipe!

Recipe was a hit! Next time I think I'll add the 2 extra eggs, more onion, and cheese on top as well. With 6 eggs I'd probably check it after 35-40mins. Mushrooms and tomatoes added would be really good! It'd also be good served with taco sauce or sauce baked on top. These were my changes: 3/4c diced red onion sauteed in 1T butter, no other butter. ~3/4c fluffed ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. ~2 1/4c shredded cheddar cheese. White pepper instead. ~2 1/2c de-stemmed fresh spinach leaves, torn up when added to mix. -Beat eggs, mix in flour until not lumpy, mix in sauteed red onion, blend in ricotta until smooth, mix in shredded cheddar, mix in salt and white pepper, blend in spinach leaves tearing up as added.

I also added two extra eggs as other reviewers suggested along with 2 small cans of green chillies.  Left out the butter but otherwise kept the recipe exactly as written. We really liked this for our meatless Monday meal. Served with country biscuits only and it made a really nice light meal.  Will be repeating this so thanks for posting!

Had a bag of fresh spinach no longer quite salad ready to use up, 6 wedges Laughing Cow cheese coming up to their expiration date, a hunk of cheddar to shred, and the leftover heel of a ham.  Diced it all up, mixed it in with the eggs, onion, flour, and 1/4 cup butter, and viola.  What a tasty way to clean out the fridge.

I added more spinach and followed the advice of other reviews and added two more eggs. I also cut the cheese in half and used ricotta instead of cottage. It still turned out good. I'll definitely try it again.

This recipes has become an easy, go to for all occasions, dish. Our congregation has been using it for a fund raising brunch for years. I also change up the spinach for other vegetables and the cheddar for either goat or feta cheese. I saute the onions and veggies before mixing together and baking for extra taste. Easy, no fail recipe that everyone loves.

I will definitely make this again. It's a great template as you can add whatever you have on hand. 

As per other reviewers, next time I will omit the butter to save on calories (even though it turned out fine with it). 

I did a half batch and cooked it in a muffin pan making 6 single serving size 'muffins'. I used sautéed green pepper, green onion, and onion for 4 of the 'muffins' and then added spinach to the remaining 2.

LOVED it!  

We like spicy, so I added a small can of chopped green chilies,
and served it with pico de gallo on top.  Now my neighbors are asking for your recipe!!  Thanks!
