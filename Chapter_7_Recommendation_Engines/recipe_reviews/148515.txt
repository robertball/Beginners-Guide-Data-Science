Almost identical to my mother's recipe. The only differences are using Kosher dill pickles and adding a small amount of mustard. Also, and this is very important, don't peel and chop your potatoes until AFTER they have been cooked and cooled. They will be much more firm and not be mushy.

Almost the exact recipe my Grandma taught my Mom over 50 years ago and then she passed it on to me. The only changes are use approx. 1/2 jar sweet pickles and a small amount of the pickle juice (to taste), add a little chopped celery and salt and pepper to taste. This is the only way my family really likes potato salad and this recipe will be passed on to my kids. Thanks for sharing!

Almost like mine, except I use slaw dressing with my mayo, and I add chopped celery, to suit my hubby. I have to make my potato salad at every get together. Yummy good.

I hate potato salad but it is one of my husband's favorite summer foods.  I was making this recipe as it is gluten free and dairy free (my kids are allergic) and got rave reviews.  I ended up trying it and think it is the best potato salad I have ever had, it was so good I had seconds and I HATE potato salad!!!  My husband's only suggestion is that maybe sometime I put some olives or pimentos in it for a variation.

Generally, I am a colossal failure at potato salad.  I just can't seem to get the flavors right.  This recipe, however was a winner!!  Easy and it tastes great....and I'm not even a big fan of sweet pickles.  Not sure if it made a difference or not, but I boiled potatoes and eggs yesterday and refrigerated them until I was ready to make the salad today.  I also used mayo, not Hellman's.  Now that I have a great base, I feel more confident to try other flavors, like dill pickles, etc.  Very happy, thank you!

Very rich, very creamy. I omitted the onions as we all like the sweetness of this salad. This is so easy to make, so simple. Real comfort food.

I wanted to surprise my wife by making potato salad for our 4th of July barbecue. This recipe was a huge hit, so much so that my wife was a little jealous as everyone raved about it. It actually became the on going laugh at the party as my wife kept saying how awful it was as she consumed several bowls full. So we get home from the barbecue at my sisters place and what's the first thing my wife wants to eat, you guessed it, my potato salad. I think I just created a monster.

I am an experimenter, and this recipe is a great starting spot for my more "garden"potato salad.  I added a large sweet potato and 5 sliced carrots to the boiling potatoes about half way through (mine took longer than 12 minutes, because I like some of them to mash up when mixed in).  I also added celery to the onion, and used 16oz chopped bread n butter sandwich slices and about a cup of chopped english cucumber instead of the 24oz sweet pickles, and added 2 T each lemon juice and dill relish, and 1/2 a lemon's worth of zest to the dressing, which I made of 1/2 mayo and 1/2 miracle whip, B-cause I serve people who like both, and this way I can tell everyone I used their personal favorite.  Oh, I also added a T each of dried dill weed and Litehouse Freeze-Dried Salad Herb Blend, as well as a t of Organic Turmeric for its health benefit.  Thanks for the great start!

This is a good basic recipe. I agree with margiekale, potato salad must have some celery and a bit of mustard.  Also, my nephew, who is a professional chef, gave me another suggestion: add a bit of dill weed. It does wonders for your potato salad!

This potato salad got rave reviews at  a recent BBQ we had.  The only changes I made were that I used sweet pickle relish instead of chopping sweet pickles and I also added celery.  Delicious!!!

I just finished making this and of course before putting it in the fridge had to taste, I never would have thought so few ingredients would make such an awesome potato salad! I did add a bit of mustard and dill pickles instead of sweet since that is what I had, but using miracle whip instead of mayo added the tanginess needed. love it, thanks so much for sharing. I have been looking a long time for a potato salad recipe like this. I don't have to always make German potato salad now or buy from the deli.

WoW!! What an easy recipe that is so easily adaptable to personal tastes.  Since I was only cooking for a couple of people, I just estimated with 4 large potato's and 5 eggs. Approx. 3/4 cup mayo, and a dash of mustard.  (I could also see adding a shot of a Louisiana hot sauce, which I love.)  I used bread and butter pickles cut up,  the flavor of those sweet rounds and added a little juice.  
I have since made this several times, and what I find works best for me is some pickle juice and white vinegar which gives it the bite I love.  Also adding fresh chives..........I want to thank Holly (who reviewed this recipe) when she wrote ' to cook the potato's whole in their skin, and then peel and chop after they were cooled.'  That was PERFECT (because I know I can overcook potato's and they will turn mushy. In fact, I will also now make my mashed potato's this way.)  This was my first time making potato salad and I will not buy store bought again, this was just too good and easy.  Thanks for posting.

Very good...My mother has also made a version of this since I was a child, and I carry it on now...my teen-aged children will not eat any potato salad other than mine.  We add a squirt of yellow mustard and either a splash of vinegar or pickle juice, chopped ham, and about a teaspoon of sugar.   Oh yes, sometimes I sub green onions for the yellow and sometimes omit entirely...depending on who's joining for dinner...then I just add onion powder.  Thanks, I didn't think anyone else made a similar version.

I have tried many recipes for potato salad but this one is the best.  Very easy to follow.  The potatoes are not mushy.  I left out the onions for my family but added red bell pepper and celery.  We enjoyed this over both Thanksgiving and Christmas Dinner.  Very tasty.  I will be making this again.

I don't add onion to my potato salad , some times I add  yellow mustard  , and black pepper to it.
and sometimes  for a change  I like to add   frozen mixed vegetables after boiling them (corn, carrots,green beans  ).
if I'm going to use only potato I sprinkl the salad with dill.

This is such a great recipe! I made it without pickles and onions..because we don't like anything crunchy in our potato salad. It was awesome!! All the store brands have celery, onions, pickles..so we end up picking all that out, making it difficult to eat (it takes forever..lol)! Thanks for this simple recipe!!

I would consider this a basic starter that you would customize.  I made it as is, but felt the need to add more juice from the pickles, quite a bit of yellow mustard, pepper to taste, and definitely celery.  Once I got done adding everything, then it tasted perfect.

This is a great recipe for a potato salad. I did however omit the pickle relish and onion. My kids raved about it! Thank you, I will definitely make this again in the future.

This is my recipe with a few additions. I use sweet mixed pickles, a few sweet onions and a touch of yellow mustard. Sometimes if I have any celery I'll use it.

My family loved this, it was my first time making potato salad and they raved about it. I added some mustard, celery, and some bacon bites to give it a personal flare.

Great.My recipe too. Only I use fat free mayo and only about 4 eggs.Used kosher dills for better flavour and added mustard and paprika for flavour and color. 10 eggs...way too much!!!! Need to cut the fat and calorie content.

After reading a few reviews that it needed some thing more.  I added ranch dressing, mustard, and sugar.  And it tastes AMAZING!!  Just a few squirts of mustard, and about a half cup of Ranch (subtract it from the mayo amount) and about a quarter cup of sugar (seems like a lot but I like things a little sweeter).  Definately a great recipe to go off from and tweek!

This recipe was very simple, so I was excited to try it out. I'm a fan of good potato salad, but I've never took the time to really make it myself. I'm rating this 4 of 5 because like I said it was simple and easy to make, as far as the overall taste it gets the job done, but there wasn't any extra umph to it.

This is a pretty basic recipe, but I feel that it needs some finely diced red or green bell pepper and some celery   I'd cut down just a bit on the sweet pickles.  It's nice to see that you're not ruining the terrific flavor with mustard!  I also always add just a few drops of white vinegar.

Instead of chopping sweet pickles, I just add sweet relish.  And I mix my mayo with milk, just enough to keep it creamy, add the relish, mustard, sugar, and just a tad of cider vinegar.  Eggs and chopped onion are also a must.  Same with macaroni salad, except I always add canned tiny shrimp to that.

I agree it's probably what your used to. Potato salad must have some celery it in. Also I add a tablespoon of mustard to give it some zip.

This is EXACTLY the way I make potato salad which I got from my mom over 50 years ago.  Isn't that amazing? I also boil enough eggs to slice some and lay all around the top of the salad and then sprinkle paprika over all which makes it look as delicious as it tastes!

Easy to make recipe. We modified it for Thanksgiving dinner, so instead of 8 serving we made it for ten. 

The measurements were spot on, and directions easy to follow.

We substituted the sweet pickles or dill relish, and saved a bit of time. Also we added about 5 tablespoons of Old Bay to make the recipe really pop.

If you mix the sauce with the potatoes while they are warm, the potatoes take on much more flavor and the pickles/juice/mayo combo will blend anyway. I've been making this for years.

This is a great starting recipe.  I have made one pretty close to it for many years.  I use dill pickles instead of sweet, and miracle whip instead of mayonnaise.  I also add a dash of apple cidar vinegar/ dill pickle juice and yellow mustard.  I put an extra sliced hard boiled egg on top and sprinkle with paprika and black pepper for a nice presentation.  It is the best!!

Very good dish. Glad I chose it for my first time making potato salad. Although I used onion powder instead of a raw onion, my family really enjoyed it. 4 out of 5 of us went back for seconds.

I add celery, sometimes radishes (sliced) and 2 teaspoons white sugar is a must!! It gives it just a little tinge of sweetness.. do beat the blah bland taste of most potato salads.  I get compliments every time!

My foster Mother's potato salad was similar but she added yellow mustard,chopped green onions, dill pickle and paprika. She was arthritic and rarely cooked leaving the job to my older Sister but when she did she could make our holiday meals memorable filling the house with the smells of whatever she was cooking.

This is very close to my grandmother's potato salad. The only changes I made were to add a little mustard to taste as well as some chopped celery.

small jar of relish instead of pickles.

My Grandmother and Mom made this potato salad, except they put a little dry mustard in it.  I do the same except since we don't care for pickles, I leave them out.   No pickels also removes some of the salt.   My Mother's brother mentioned he really missed the family Potato Salad, so I made a batch for a family reunion we were taking him to.

I made this as directed (I don't think it's fair to rank a recipe unless I make it as directed).  It was extremely bland & too dry.  It tasted like plain potatoes & onions.  The good thing is that you can add things after it is made.  I ended up adding:  celery seed, dill weed, white wine vinegar, Miracle Whip,  spicy brown mustard, & lots of salt.  It tasted fine after the additions.  I would make this again & use Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise to add flavor, & add the ingredients as listed above.  Also, if you don't  really like onions, definitely decrease the amount.

Loved this...made a very large bowl of salad but have leftovers!
Time consuming peeling potatoes after being cooked but turned out great
Cut up some bread and butter pickle slices I had in fridge.
Will make this again

Pretty much like my mother's recipe and we get raves from most everybody.  We use salad dressing & add a little celery & yellow mustard.  Sometimes I use sweet pickles; sometimes I use baby dills, depends on my mood.  And I like it with mayo just as well, but husband prefers salad dressing.

This is close to my family recipe.  We make it so much we don't even measure anymore.  The ingredients are the same.  My family has made this at least 75 years.  I wanted to make a suggestion for people looking for a bit of a  tang.  We are a Helman's family.  However, we add cheap salad dressing to our potato salad.  Half Helman's half cheap salad dressing.  Also add a bit of the sweet pickle juice.

I would omit the sweet pickles and halve the number of eggs.  Just add a couple squirts  of yellow mustard. I also would use a little less onion and add some chopped celery and chopped parsley.

So close to what I had on Sunday picnics as a child.Save some chopping and use sweet pickle relish. And Miracle Whip instead of mayo gives it that extra kick......
Thanks for submitting. It brings back fond memories.
