Very tasty!! Only used 2 teaspoons of butter though, as I think I would have felt sick just knowing I was consuming 1 cup of butter!! Still tasted great without all that butter.

So the chicken doesn't dry out, don't get it completely done (just white) before you add the soup and pasta...it makes the chicken much more tender and juicy. I also used 2 cloves of garlic instead of the garlic salt and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of cream of chicken, but I think I'll use 3 cans all together next time...I had to keep adding water so it wouldn't dry out by the time the macaroni cooked.

My 3 boys, ages 10,6, & 3, love this!  The butter really does make a big difference.  I have always made this with 2 cans of cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom.  And I cut up the chicken into bite size pieces.  Thanks for the recipe, I have passed this on to friends and family and they are just as satisfied!

This is a great recipe! Very easy, tasty, hearty and a true one-pot meal. Easy to customize too - switch up the type of condensed soup, or change out the vegetables, or even try it with pork! Definitely a keeper. Thanks!

I suppose I made this dish more difficult for myself, but once I read the recipe, I wanted to bread & pan fry the chicken. I breaded it with egg and Ritz crackers, then cooked it in a little olive oil.. cut the breasts in half.. mixed up the soup, macaroni, mushrooms, some chicken broth, two chopped cloves of garlic, and a can of peas.. placed the chicken on top with a little shredded cheese and baked it for about 30 minutes on 300. I guess I was looking at recipes for inspiration :) Very tasty combination though. Next time, I'll try the original recipe.

Very simple and no matter how low I am on groceries I almost always have what I need to make this.  The only thing I do different is cut the butter in half.

Didn't have high hopes for this when I started making it but it turned out to be REALLY good!  I added a tablespoon of wine and a whole container of fresh mushrooms and it was SO good!  My husband was like "Hmmm, chicken stuff, huh?"  That was the last I heard from him because he ate the entire bowl!  Yummy and easy!

Ok, this recipe tasted pretty good, but I'm giving it four stars only because I didn't feel very well after I ate it. Think it was the one cup of butter I consumed.

It is hard finding new recipes for a husband that is a picky eater. He loved this recipe. I have it for 2. Used 5 chicken breast tenderloins, half cup butter, one can soup and half a can water. This worked just fine for a meal for two.

Easy to make and deicious. Its VERY buttery but honestly I like that in a comfort food (no one is thinking this is health food right?). I think this is an easy inexpensive and delicious way to feed a few hungry people. The only thing that gets tedious is the stirring because the pasta is thrown in uncooked and has to totally soften and cook while you nearly break your wrist stirring but when you taste this it is so worth it!

Delicious base recipe.  I made the following changes:  No garlic salt, instead I used a minced garlic clove.  There is enough salt in the soups that additional salt is not needed.  Used 1/2 the butter called for.  I didn't have fresh mushrooms, so added canned mushrooms with liquid.  I also added about 1 T. of lemon juice and some shredded parmesean and asiago cheeses to the sauce.  I didn't have elbow macaroni, so I added farfalle (bowtie) pasta instead.  Hubby and 3 kids (10, 8 and 4) all loved it, and I will add it to my quick go to recipes, as it was quick and easy.

Yummy, big hit with my 5, my picky 3 year old, and 9 month old.  I gave it a 4 because of the amount of butter.  I used half and next time I will use even less because I really don't think the extra calories are necessary for flavor.  Will definitely make it again!

Very good! I've made it several times. I also like to use boneless skinless chicken thighs. For the mushrooms, I like to chop up fresh portabellas.

There's very little I cahnged about this recipe.  I used chicken soup instead of mushroom because of personnal preference which is why I also omitted the mushrooms.  I also added 1/2 tablesppon of white wine per chicken breast for added flavour.  Next time I'll try cutting the chicken into bite size pieces and removing them once fried, adding them again when the macaroni is nearly cooked as I found the chicken a little dry.  Will defintely make again.

I loved this recipe. The taste was great and very filling and extremly easy and fast to make. My kids really enjoy this too! You can play around with this if you like depending on what ingredients you have on hand or its wonderful just the way it is. I usualyy make it with Cream of Chicken soup, but want to try with Cream of Celery next, or maybe cream of broccoli hmmmmm.

2 of my friends and I had a lot of fun making this recipe. However, we ended up having to scoop some of the butter out of the pan while the chicken while it was cooking. It was unbearable to imagine eating all of that butter. All and all, a great meal, especially if you like the extra mushroom taste.

This dish was very tasty.  However, I made some changes.   I used 1/2 cup butter with some fresh chopped garlic.  Instead of lemon pepper, I added a little sprinkle of lemon before adding the soup.   While it simmered I sprinkled the top with thin strips of carrot and a few broccoli florets.   It also required a sprinkle of salt and pepper to taste.

I used the full amount of butter but next time I'll cut it in half. Really wasn't necessary. I used Cream of chicken and mushroom soup and cream of mushroom with roasted garlic. I used 1 can of milk instead of water, and used a small bag of frozen peas instead of mushrooms because that's what I had on hand. Came out pretty good. I'll make it again because I generally have all those things on hand even when payday is a day or two away

This was good, both my very picky boys (9 and 11)liked it. Vey easy to make. I only used half the butter but I still found it too much. I'll make it again but with only 1/4 cup of butter.

I was looking for a creamy chicken recipe, and this totally fit the bill!  I used Golden Cream of mushroom, and instead of the suggested spices, I used my Boagle spice (you can find it online).  Will be making this again, and adding vegies like broccoli or something.  I also made the pasta seperate, and added at the end.

This was INCREDIBLE! I loved it so much. Even my 7 and 9 year old ate it without mentioning the mushrooms! lol! Here are my tweaks:
*I doubled the recipe, but only used half the butter.
*I substituted one can of cheddar cheese soup and used chicken broth instead of water. 
*I sauteed the mushrooms in a separate pan in 2 Tb of butter before I added them (I figured I could afford it after cutting back the butter by half!) 
*I also used a little lemon juice and freshly ground pepper instead of lemon pepper. 

I was actually surprised at how delicious it was for how easy it was. I definitely recommend it and will make it again! :D

This recipe is so simple yet so delicious!! I didn't use lemon pepper because I'm not a fan of the flavor. I seasoned the chicken thighs with salt, pepper and rosemary--the rosemary added a really good flavor. I used a tablespoon of butter and seasoned my cast iron skillet with a few sprays of olive oil. Fresh mushrooms are key...I will be making this recipe again!!

Had a couple of quite large boneless skinless chicken breasts defrosted, and some fresh mushrooms to use up.  This recipe popped up when I entered these two things in the search box at the top of the page.  What a great help!  After reading several of the recipe reviews, I also thought 1 cup of butter was excessive.  Used 1/2 cup and it was still PLENTY!  Cut the chicken in 1 inch wide strips and gently fried them till lite golden and white...but still cooked.  Used the garlic salt. lemon pepper, some fresh ground pepper and a little sprinkle of garlic powder....all to what I thought looked to be the correct amounts to give the chicken good flavor.  Only had 1 each of mushroom and cream of chicken soups.  What the heck....why not?  Used a few more mushrooms than called for.  Made sure the water amount was correct to be able to cook the pasta, but not dilute the flavors.  A sprinkle of fresh parsley at the end....and it was a great dish!!!  Will make again.  Always looking for fast and easy dishes to make when you get home at 5pm!    ps.  Also added some cooked frozen petite peas near the end.  :)

I used one can cream of broccoli and one of cream of chicken. I also didn't measure the lemon pepper or the garlic powder (instead of garlic salt since I didn't want to add any more salt to the canned soups) but sprinkled it on both sides of the cooking chicken.  I considered adding steamed broccoli to the mix, but it wasn't ready in time, so I put it over the broccoli. Yummy!

it came out good! I used minced garlic and I added Parmesan (as I do to everything) and onion powder. the only thing is it doesn't specify how much chicken to really use.. I used 4 big chicken breasts and it made an insane amount. I ended up using a whole box of noodles to even it out. I also used the amount of butter stated.. but once the chicken was cooked I dumped a lot of the buyer out, then went on to add the soup and noodles. overall, good (filling) meal! I ended up making enough to last a few days

Oddly enough, I think this would taste better without the chicken.  As others suggested, I reduced the butter (possibly a bit too much).  A little extra salt & pepper after cooking went a long way in upping the flavor.  Tasted really good warmed up the next day.  My husband loved it.

Made it as written, served it with crusty rolls and a salad. We all loved it!  We will make this again.

Wasn't bad. Probably won't make again. For as unhealthy as it is, I'd need way better taste.

I enjoyed this recipe- it was pretty simple for a novice cook, like me, to make! I actually didn't use any butter at all- just 2 or so tablespoons of olive oil to coat the pan. I used different types of colored pasta to make it look more fun! It turned out great and I'm looking forward to eating the leftovers!

Great recipe. Even my non-chicken eating husband liked this one. I substitute a different pasta for macaroni, each time.
