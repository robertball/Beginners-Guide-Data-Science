I made this and it came out pretty good, but I'll be honest. I changed the recipe quite a bit. First I simmered an onion and some fresh garlic until nice and tender in a medium sized sauce pot. Then I added one can of cream of mushroom soup and one can of water. Once that was nice bubbly I added a tablespoon of smart balance but butter would work just as well. Next I added some salt, pepper and Italian seasonings mix. (Season to liking of course.) Next I stirred everything together for about 5 minutes before adding my cheese. I used a vegan Parmesan and some Havarti. Finally I added 1 head of riced cauliflower. I let that cook for about 3-5 minutes, stirring consistently before adding the asparagus. After adding the asparagus I cooked my risotto for about 3 more minutes before I sprinkled some fresh bacon bits over the top and my dish was done! This dish turned out so delicious I had people asking me what restaurant I ordered it from! Not only that it people hardly even noticed it was not actually risotto! I will definitely be making this again! Thanks for sharing.

I added dried parsley, garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, a pinch of cayenne pepper, salt and pepper to zest it up a bit (since it is just veggiesâ€¦)
