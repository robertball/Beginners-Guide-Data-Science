Awesome recipe. Seriously, it inspired awe in those who tasted it.

I just wanted to repost a mascarpone substitute I found in another Tiramisu recipe. It worked wonderfully in this one!

HEIDI8803 posted this in Raspberry Tiramisu, not sure which recipe she got it from:
mascarpone substitute-
2pkgs cream cheese blended with 1/2 c heavy cream and 5 T sour cream

And, to reiterate other advice given by previous reviewers, I too made two of the three cake layers with the instant coffee (I'd've made it three, but the changing colors are beautiful) and I doubled the coffee liquer everywhere it was called for. I think next time I'm going to add chocolate covered coffee beans around the base of the cake.

***Edit*** I've made this a few times now, and learned (the hard way) one big thing on the frosting: It is better to under whip than over. More than five minutes and you risk hitting an icky butter zone. That might be what happened to Nicky. Right at 5 min. works for me. Oh, and believe all the reviews about letting the cake sit overnight. The frosting will set better in that time.

AMAZING!  Make this and you will look like a pro!
My suggestions:
1) use 4x as much instant coffee powder in cake batter, and make 2 layers of coffee flavored cake
2)  i followed another reviewer's suggestion for substituting mascarpone with a mix of cream cheese, sour cream, and heavy cream, and it tastes great and is cheaper
3)  you must turn the cake upside down when layering, otherwise coffee liqueur will not soak into it
4)  i used kahlua for liqueur
5)  I used Duncan Hines supreme white cake mix-it is moist and uses egg whites
6)  i used a very strong espresso instead of the coffee to give it more flavor...also, instead of making coffee/espresso, just add water to some of the instant coffee powder, it tastes just fine in the cake

Used 1 cup of coffee and 3T of  liqueur. Made it twice this way and it turns out so wonderfly moist and flavorful. Oddly the coffee flavor is still very subtle. The cake layers are so moist with the extra liquid it is best to freeze them before you layer them.This way they will not fall apart when stacking.

Thanks for the excellent recipe!  I made this for my father's birthday...he was a professional baker and cake decorator in Europe so the pressure was on.  Everyone agreed it was great.  The frosting was not overly sweet like some can be.  I would, however add more coffee/liquor mixture to the layers next time.  I was afraid the cake would taste too "boozy", as there are members of my family that dont drink, but the taste was very subtle.  (good for those that dont like the coffee taste)  I also made the cake layers days ahead of time and simply froze them, took them out of the freezer and assembled the cake the day before the party. When I sprinkled the cocoa powder on the cake I  first carefully placed a paper "lace" doily on the cake top and when removed the cake had the lace pattern on top.

Excellent. To make things easier, I used only 2 pans.  I poured half of the cake batter onto 1 deep pan and used a cake slicer to evenly divide it.  I followed the instructions to detail afterward.  Follow these tips for outstanding results: 1. Instead of mixing the instant coffee into the batter, mix 1/4 cup of water with about 1 tbsp of instant cofee powder and mix into the batter.  It tastes like an awesome mocha cake. 2. Also, be generous with the coffee mixture as you're pouring it over your cakes, that way the cake is MOIST.  Don't overdo it though! 3. Buy your MASCARPONE CHEESE at Trader Joes or Sams Club (even cheaper)...it's significantly cheaper there than any other grocery store that I went to. Excellent recipe!! thank you.

I thought that the cake and the filling recipes were wonderful. But when it was time to make the fristing, it turned out horrible. It was extremely watery and tasted sour. I decided to make a simple cream cheese combination frosting instead; and fortunately my cake was saved and everyone loved it. Can anyone tell me what I might have done wrong with the frosting?

I thought this cake was great! Following the advice of previous reviews, I make two of the layers with the coffee granulars and one without, doubled the Kahlua everywhere it was called for, and doubled the brewed coffee. I was amazed how fast this came together. Because the layers are so thin they cook and cool very fast. I think I had the whole thing done in under 45 minutes. As a variation, I made this recipe for my husband's birthday and left out all the coffee, kahlua, and coffee granulars and added Chambord to two of the layers, layered sliced strawberries over her marscapone cheese between the cake layers and pressed more slices into the side of the whipped cream frosting. It was very good, like a strawberry shortcake cake.

Absolutely delicious!  So easy to make with a beautiful finished outcome.  My whole family adored it and I've made it twice so far.  One note - if you want luscious chocolate curls don't use a square of baking chocolate.  Melt chocolate chips and shortening, refrigerate in a sm. rectangular pan, and shave away.  Great recipe!

This cake was excellent and easy to make.  I baked the cake layers in 9" springform pans and took roughly 12-13 minutes to bake.  Followed some reviewers suggestions and made 2 coffee layers.  I didn't want to modify the recipe too much the first time.  But next time I will double the coffee/liquor mixture for the layers and add more liquor.  I also used heavy whipping cream and it was yummy and so light.  Cannot wait to make this cake again!

Did you REALLY make this?  This is awesome! Tastes like a fancy bakery.  These are the comments I heard after making this for my mom's birthday.  She loves Tiramisu and all other recipes on this site looked too involved.  This turned out wonderful, and the taste was great.  I used a Kahlua and Vanilla Coffee, a little packet of instant flavored Vanilla Coffee and a Kahlua type liquor.  Tasted wonderful!  I don't even like coffee!  The layered effect is really nice and although it takes a little time to put together it is well worth the comments I received from my family.  You have to try it!  Looks very fancy with shaved Ghiradelli Dark Chocolate on top and a dusting of cocoa!

This is THE cake to make if done properly.
Followed the advice from other. Three cups of whipping cream for the icing. Two coffee layers, doubled the coffee added to cake batter, doubled coffee liqour. Duncan Hines white cake is the best. You MUST use marscapone cheese. I made this cake twice. Once with marscapone and one with the substitute mentioned earlier. The marscapone substitute was horrible. Sorry, but you can't replace the real thing. This is not a cake to make if you are worried about price, calories, cholesterol or anything else. I has to be made properly in order to truly enjoy it. I'm sticking with the real deal from now on.
It's worth every penny and bite.
I'm checking the calendar now to see what the next event is coming up that I can make this again. ;0)

Excellent cake for those who like tiramisu!  I don't like boxed cake mixes so I used "Heavenly White Cake" from this site for that part and did 3 (8 inch) layers.  I love how light the whipped cream frosting is for this cake. For that portion of the recipe I made sure my bowl and beater were chilled before starting.  I did this cake the night before to let it set up and I'm glad I did because the coffee flavor really came through.  I did add a bit more liquor but it was still nice and light and not overpowering.

OMGoodness!  This cake was so yummy, so pretty, so sophisticated, moist, light & impressive. I used the mascarpone sub. recipe (1 block cream cheese, 1/4 C cream, 2.5 tbsp sour cream is just right)Per reviews, I used 2 coffee layers & upped the coffee intensity everywhere. You could just catch a hint of the coffee.  I don't usually like Tiramisu because of the boozey taste, so I followed the recipe with the Kahlua. BUT I doubled the instant coffee granules in the batter & used 2 tsp. granules to 3/4 C. water to pour over the layers. The light & fluffy frosting was so fun & easy to spread!  I think others have underbeat their frostings & that's why they were soupy. Just after a stiff peak forms, beat about 20 seconds longer. Stick your bowl & beaters in the freezer right before you start the recipe!!  The cake tasted best the next morning, cold from the fridge, and held up beautifully.  This is my new special occasion cake! **UPDATE** I've made this 3 more times now, and completely blow everyone away, every time. I made it for a grooms cake at the wedding rehersal =BIG Hit! I tried the mascarpone cheese and I like it better, it's a little lighter and less "cheesey" tasting.  You MUST frost the cake very soon after making the frosting, or it will start to separate, get soupy and not hold up as you frost.  For some reason, if it's ON the cake, the frosting holds up great, (maybe the cake absorbs the extra moisture) but it will not hold in a bowl, in the fridge.  Don't let this s

I made this cake for a dinner party last night and what a hit! Everyone loved it. It was a little time consuming especially the frosting. A good tip is to place 4 strips of wax paper around the egde of the cake plate that way when you done frosting you can carefully pull them out and your cake plate is clean! Next time I'm going to do 2 layers coffee (more powder) and only one layer white. Also I think I will add more booze! :)
***UPDATE: Here are my tips after making this cake several times: Make two cakes, one white, one coffee and split them into two layers each after they are baked and cooled. (You'll have two coffee layers and two white layers). Before adding the instant coffee to the cake batter, dissolve it in some water. In addition, don't add liquor to the whipped cream; add a pinch or two of instant coffee instead. The people who had icing that soured or wouldn't thicken had too much extra liquid (not enough fat to liquid) and over beat their cream. Whipping cream does turn into butter and buttermilk when over beaten. Adding a little bit more confectioners sugar will also keep the icing "set". I use one 8 oz package cream cheese, 2 tbsp sour cream and 1 tbsp cream for the mascapone. I hope these tricks help!

This is an amazing cake! People offer me money to make it! I did however double the recipe, using two cake mixes instead of one. I made one white cake mix and split the batte between two 9 inch cake pans, the other cake mix i used the coffee in and put that in my 9in Springform cheesecake pan. I cut the coffee colored cake with a large bread knife for a total of 5 layers (3 brown and 2 white) I did double the coffee anywhere it called for coffee (anything liquor, instant or brewed) and dissolved the coffee first as suggested by others. One other tip that really helped me was I bought a plastic condiment bottle with the tiny spout (like for mustard) And that is what I drizzled the coffee on the cake with, it made it so easy that way. The frosting will not slip off at all if you beat it long enough. Beat your whipped cream until a scraper stands up in the middle of the bowl without falling over. I make my cakes the day before and refrigerate them. and then assemble it the next day or the night before I want to use it. It looks beautiful and everyone was so impressed! Thank you to all the cooks for the hints, it really helped to double the coffee I think I will triple it next time. (It was hard enough because I doubled the recipie, and then had to double the coffee on top of that) So my math is improving! Ha! This is my all time favorite cake.

baked in 2 round cake pans - one with coffee, one white. poked cakes after they had cooled about 15 mins in pan & then poured coffee/kahlua mix (following other reviewers to double the amounts) over each layer in the pan.  Covered them with pl. wrap & foil & froze in pans overnite.  Made the cream cheese substitute also contributed by other reviewers and whipped up my cream with kahlua.  Then I layered the whole thing in a trifle bowl -crumbled  cake, cream cheese, whipped cream & sprinkled with cocoa/sugar mixture then layered again all the way to the top and sprinkled with more cocoa/sugar.  it not only looked beautiful in the bowl, it served up perfectly.  No worries about the cake layers sliding, no having to cut pieces - everyone just dug in.  And the left overs the next day were awesome!!!  So easy to do - if you are looking for something a whole lot simpler, try this!!

This was so good I followed others instructions and doubled just about everything and made 2 layers of coffee flavored cake rather than the one.  I diluted the coffee in some hot water before adding so it colored nicely.  I used about 3/4 cup of coffee to brush accross the layers and turned them upside down so they soaked in really well.  I didnt have mascarpone so used the other suggestion for the cream cheese.  The only real difference I made other than others suggestion was to add 2 TBSP of instant vanilla pudding to the whipped cream when I was whipping it for the frosting made it stand up really well.  After 5 days it still looked good believe it or not.

Thank you for a WONDERFUL recipe.  I made this for my italian boss' birthday and she stated it was better than any tiramisu she has tasted!  I made a few changes to make the recipe easier for me after reading all the other reviews: Used 2 9 inch cake pans pouring 1/3 mix into one and 2/3 in the other (used a food scale to measure the weight of the filled pans so I would know when they had the right amounts of filling - thanks Alton Brown for that tip!) Put 3 TBSP of instant coffee in the 2/3 pan. Put the baked cakes in the fridge overnight to cool.  Next day leveled each cake and divided the coffee cake in half.  Doubled filing recipe and placed in fridge to cool.  Made the cake pour over mixture (4 TBSP coffee liquer & 1 cup espresso) and sat it on the counter.  Doubled Frosting recipe and added a splash of espresso at the end for more of a coffee flavor (you could use a splash of instant coffee, just make sure your frosting is whipped to the right consistency, I found that on my kitchen aid stand mixer with the splash guard on I mixed the frosting for 5 minutes at level 6 for the first 3 minutes then level 8 for the last two and it was perfect.  Placed the frosting in the fridge and pulled out the filling.  Placed a coffee layer of cake on my cake stand, poked wholes in it poured 1/3 of the coffee/liquer mixture on the cake followed with 1/2 of the filling mixture, next layer was the plain white cake repeated above and followed with 2nd coffee cake layer poked holes and pou

Delicious just the way it's written! Why do people change it and then put photos of their concoctions under this recipe? I want to see it the way it's written. Put your own recipe in if you don't want to follow directions.

I really took my time when deciding to prepare this one but boy am I glad I did..it was OUTSTANDING!!!!!  Here are my modifications...  1.  made it in 2 layers instead of 3 2.  doubled the coffee and kahula everywhere 3.  froze the cake for 2 hours before adding the liquid 4.  made the cake and assembled it the day beofre I served it. 5.  put the frosting and the filling in the fridge for an hour before frosting the cake..this helped the frosting "set" 6.  Used the cream cheese, icing sugar and ssour cream indeat of mascarpone cheese   the ony other thing I might do differently (I will make this one again!!) is to cut the filling in half as it was alot for only 2 layers.  This was as beautiful to serve as delicious it was to eat!!!!

I've made this several times and have some suggestions for the ease of the baker....I leave my cakes in pans after baking. Let cool on wire rack  for 15 minutes, poke holes with toothpick. Pour coffee/liqueur mixture over cakes and then set in freezer for 20 minutes. Doing this enables the cake to "swim" in the the coffee mixture and also  insures the cake won't split when setting it up.

Once the first piece was cut, this cake lasted all of five minutes at the last family get together.  Any recommendations?  Sure.  As others have said, yes, double the amounts of coffee and hootch.  And personally, I liked to use a 50/50 blend of Kahlua and Bailey's.  Next, I used 8" pans for higher layers.  I then baked the cake in 2 pans, not three (1 plain and 1 with the coffee mixture), so that when I split each layer in half, I wound up with 4 alternating layers.  Lastly, I doubled the amount of filling.  Yup.  Doubled it.  That really brings out the tiramisu-ish taste.  And please, please, don't substitute cream cheese for the mascarpone.  Yes, it costs more, but the flavor is SO worth it!

This cake was a big hit!  I made it for a friend's birthday.  I only made two layers, since I only have two 9-inch round cake pans. Based on the many reviews I read about the coffee flavor being too subtle, I used 3 shots of espresso instead of 1/4 cup of coffee for the drizzle over the top of each layer. I doubled the amount of coffee liquor (I used Kahlua) everywhere it was called for, and I also doubled the amount of instant coffee in the coffee layer. I also made the cakes yesterday and put them in the fridge overnight, which made them much easier to deal with today, and kept the filling and frosting from melting at all.

I added Pirouline cookies around the outside as some others have done; it makes the cake look great, but it does make it a lot more expensive.  Still, it ramps up the fanciness factor!

First of all, this cake is a terrific 5-star recipe as written! I've made it four times and constantly hear "This is the best tiramisu I've had!" and "Can I have the recipe?"  If you like the coffee flavor, I do recommend making 2 layers with coffee grounds (instead of one) as others have said using a total of 4 tsp. instant coffee in the batter once you've poured the first pan of plain batter. And again because I like coffee so much, I use 1 cup coffee and 3 tbsp. coffee liqueur to soak the layers. I've tried using a brush and using a squeeze bottle to soak but I like the brush much better as you have more control.  Be sure to soak bottom of cakes as it soaks in much better. Do not use marscapone substitute, use the real thing.  I found myself wanting a little bit more filling in the layers last time I made it, so this time I added two heaping spoonfuls of whipped cream cheese, a tad more powdered sugar, and 1 extra tbsp. coffee liqueur, and it was the perfect amount and kept the marscapone taste. Leave the frosting recipe as is.  If you add more alcohol, it will be too thin.  I put it in my Kitchenaid blender, throw the splashguard on and put the kitchen timer on for 5 minutes.  Sometimes I use the shaved chocolate to garnish and sometimes I use strawberries.  Again, this recipe is delicious and deserves 5 stars the way it is but above are the tweaks I've made to give it more of a coffee flavor and helpful tips I've learned along the way.

Excellent recipe but lacking the coffee flavor.  I did double The coffee as others suggested and that solved the problem.  I didn't have coffee liquor and didn't want to spend the money on it, so I improvised.  I mixed 3T of water with 2T of coffee granules and 1/2 tsp of almond extract.  The almond extract really upped the true tiramisu flavor.  And just to add, I've seen several comments that this didn't turn out like tiramisu, this isn't a recipe for tiramisu, this is a cake intended to have a similar flavor profile.  Also I didn't have 3, 9 inch pans so I put 1/3 of mix in one pan, and the other 2/3 (with double the coffee granules) in the other pan then tortes the larger cake.  Just watch them carefully as they will have different cooking times.  Also make sure the cake cools all the way down before stacking, and please don't poor the coffee mixture on each layer until it's stacked.  Pouring it separately will just cause the pieces to crumble.

The coffee layer was best, so other people's advice on making 2 of them is good.  Used a small baster to put the coffee on each (upside down) layer to control amount of liquid better.  Only had Bailey's I.Cream.  I took advice and doubled the mascarpone filling.  Good move.  Was worried about "assembly" so had everything chilled overnight before putting together except did NOT make whipped cream until eady to assemble.  Like the advice on whip cream being ready when a spatula stands up straight in it.  I was pleasantly surprised that the cream stood up to time so well - expected it to break down within hours.  Next time will put more cocoa on each layer.  Dessert was much better day 2 and even better day 3. Forget day 4; there wasn't any left!

I followed all of the reviewers suggestions and I am wondering how it would have tasted without all that liqueur?  I was hoping that it would blend in to the cake and I left it out of the frosting, but I still didn't care for the taste.  I increased my coffee up to 1 cup and did 2/3 coffee layers.  I think that was a good taste. I used coffee-flavored mascarpone and that was good as well.  The only thing I would change is I wouldn't use the liqueur at all.  I decorated the top of the cake with Pirouettes and they were a hit!  Not a bad recipe overall.

One word, GORGEOUS!  If you really want to turn up the flavor, use Starbuck's Coffee Liquor instead of Kahlua - it's much richer.  Also, the first time I made this, I used a nonstick pan and the cake had nothing to cling to during the baking process.  I suggest if you're using nonstick to spray w/Flour infused Pam (or generic equivalent) to help the cake rise.  It's good either way, just presents better and lighter if it's higher.  A little salt in the whipping cream makes it whip up higher and faster too.  Just a pinch (1/8th teaspoon), no more or you'll taste it.

This is a little more time-consuming than the typical recipe with premade ladyfingers, but it is visually stunning and completely worth the extra time/effort. I have made this several times and I change up a few things. When preparing the cake, I replace the water with chilled brewed coffee for extra coffee flavor. I bake in a 9x9 baking dish and use the old floss trick to split into layers. In a pinch, replace the coffee liqueur with coffee or espresso everywhere it's called for. I'd be interested to try this out with a Devil's food or butter chocolate cake mix.

An absolutely fabulous cake. As recommended, I did two coffee layers and one white. I also doubled the kahlua everywhere it was called for; it definitely was not too much liqueur. I made the cake for my dad for father's day, my family is Italian so it went over very well! The icing is divine, my stepmother was scraping the leftover out of the bowl to put in her coffee. I did use heavy whipping cream though, not heavy cream; the icing was light, airy and delicious! I will definitely be making this again, even my grandmother (the classic Italian cook) asked for the recipe! =)

Delicious and very impressive.  As others, I did increase the coffee flavor...made two coffee layers and one white, used an extra T. Kahlua in the filling and in the frosting, and doubled the coffee/Kahlua drizzle.  I didn't end up using all of the extra drizzle mixture, though, and I still thought it was moist.  I'm imagining that those who increased this to a full cup ended up with a very wet cake, much like real tiramisu.  Because I wanted mine to still have an actual cake texture, I found that less than 1/2 c. was sufficient.

Delicious!  I used Kahlua and doubled the coffee and liquer, made in three loaf pans with two layers of coffee and one layer of white.  Chilled overnight - wonderful!  I also made a batch into mini cupcakes - cut off the top, drizzed about a teaspoon of coffee/Kahlua over the cake, filled the inside with the filling, replaced the top and frosted.  I dusted these with cocoa powder and garnished with shaved dark chocolate and an espresso bean.  Brought these to a staff luncheon and they disappeared quickly!  People asked me where I bought them, then begged for the recipe!  Thanks for the recipe and making my co-workers very happy!

Excellent recipe that's not hard and you get a super fancy looking and tasty product!  Did as many others did and made 2 coffee layers with double the coffee (1 Tbsp per layer), and put an extra Tbsp of Kahlua in the coffee to brush on the cake layers.  Made it twice and rave reviews each time.  To help stabilize the whipped cream frosting, I added gelatin:  1 tsp dry gelatin to 2 Tbsp cold water in a small container.  Let it sit for 5 minutes, then nuke for 20 seconds or until dissolved.  Let it cool to room temperature.  Add it to the cream just as it starts to form peaks, and continue as normal.  No weird texture or taste. It will still get softer and may start to slide off the cake if you leave it out for more than 2 hours, but in the fridge it lasts indefinitely (doesn't seperate at all).

I made this recipe for a bake-off at work and won!  It was delicious and overall relatively easy to make.  I ended up changing a few things.  (1)As other reviewers suggested, I made twice the coffee/coffee liqueur mixture and I used almost all of it.  (2) I misread the recipe and left the whipped cream out of the filling. I think it tasted better because of this, but I ended up having to double the amount of mascarpone, confectioners sugar, and coffee liqueur to make enough for 2 layers of filling. (3)I added the coffee/coffee liqueur mixture in such a way that I avoided the nightmare of the moistened cake layers falling apart when you try to move them. I placed the bottom cake layer on the serving plate, poked holes, and added the coffee/coffee liqueur mix with a tablespoon.  I spread the mascarpone mixture on top and then put the next cake layer on.  I poked holes in that cake layer and added the coffee/coffee liqueur mixture. Then I spread the filling, placed the next cake layer on, poked holes, and added the coffee/coffee liqueur mixture.  After all of this, I put the cake in the fridge for about 45 min-1 hour to let everything set. Since I didn't already have the whipped cream made, I whipped this during the cake's time in the fridge. I pre-chilled the metal mixing bowl in the freezer for about 15 minutes before whipping the heavy cream and after the whipped cream was made, I kept the bowl on ice while I was icing the cake.

This was a wonderful cake.  I made it for a Tupperware party and it was really well liked.  I used cream cheese (8 oz of cream cheese, 3 tbsp sour cream and 2 tbsp heavy cream) instead of the mascarpone. I followed the advice of some other reviewers and doubled the coffee in the cake batter.  I did two layers of the coffee cake and one vanilla.  The coffee needs to disolve so either disolve it in a tiny bit of hot water, or mix it in and let it sit until dissolved.  I also doubled the coffee and Kaluha that I drizzled into the cake.  I was stressed that the cake would be soggy.  It wasn't at all.  I doubled the kahluha everywhere it was called for (filling and frosting).  The flavour of coffee was very light and nice.  I do not drink coffee and I really enjoyed the flavour of the cake.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I will try mascarpone next time to see if there is a big difference in flavour.

Wow!!!!This is the best cake I have eaten or made. My husband and I have both worked at some of the best eateries in downtown Chicago and this cake takes the blue ribbon. I read the other reviews and made the following changes. I made two layers coffee, I doubled the coffee liquor in the filling and frosting , I double the instant coffee diulting it in about a tablespoon of hot water and finally I used 3/4 cup of coffee and 1/4 of coffee liquor to pour over the layers. Make sure that when you bake the layers of box cake the bake time is the the shortest time recomended on the box.(like 20-25 min. bake 20 min. no more) I still can't believe that I made the cake it was that good!

I was amazed how delicious this was for as easy as it was! The only change I really made was I used wayyyy more Kahlua than what the recipe called for! 
I had to go several places to find the mascarpone cheese, but that was before I realized that you won't find it with the regular cream cheese, most grocery stores do carry it- in the gourmet cheese cooler, that's usually near the deli or bakery (Where they have all the pre-made cheeseballs, dips, and party trays) 
Another tip: If you want good chocolate curls, soften the surface of your chocolate squares just for a second with a hair dryer on low! The surface needs to be a little bit soft to curl best!

It is so helpful to read the reviews before making this cake! I made it with some of the modifications and it came out absolutely fantastic!!
1- Definitely do 2 coffee layers and 1 regular cake layer. I used the aluminum disposable cake pans in the baking aisle. Super easy- and come in a pack of three!
2- When assembling the cake I put a wax paper border on the edges of the plate so drippings and extra frosting would fall on the wax paper and that can be pulled out from under the cake and tossed- leaving a clean plate! 
3- Assemble the cake and drench with coffee as you go!! If people had crumbling cake I wonder if they soaked in the cake pans before stacking? Don't do that! Cake, poke, pour, fill, next layer. 
3- I used 1/4 cup coffee and 1 tablespoon of Kahlua PER layer. 
4- DEFINITELY double the filling. It's so tasty. If you have read other reviews they tell you to double the Kahlua everywhere. I totally agree with this. Some people have complained that their filling it too runny. The key is that if you add more liquid (aka Kahlua) you'll also need to add a little extra powdered sugar to thicken it up. 
5-Same goes with the frosting. If you double the Kahlua here, you'll need a couple extra tablespoons of powdered sugar. The frosting is NOT too sweet, it's actually perfect. 

I know that others have substituted cream cheese for the mascarpone... but if you are going to go to the trouble to make a tiramisu cake, go for the mascarpone. It's worth it. 

Make this!

Most Excellent.  Made today for an event and many asked me where my bakery was....What would I do different? Perhaps nothing... I made 3 layers (2 coffee).. so, since I doubled the coffee layer I used 4 tsp of instant coffee (Starbucks Via) in the mix.  I baked the cakes, and let sit on wire racks until cool.. I then froze in pans for 2 hours.  I used 1/2 cup of brewed espresso and 2 tbsp of Kahlua for the liquid.  After being in the freezer for 2 hours I poked a ton of holes into the cakes and drizzled the liquid evenly between the 3 layers.. I then returned to the freezer overnight (or at least a few hours) 
I used the Marscarpone filling, which was amazing. 
ok.. so day 2: remove the frozen cakes and frost with the filling. it will look really funny---but will settle into itself as the layers thaw- I was worried that the layers would at this point slide off of each other so I placed a springform pan outer sleeve around them.  I returned the cake to the fridge to set for a few hours...AWESOME.. I then frosted... amazing.  In the future I may do the baking, the freezing, the liquid infusion, the refreezing for a few hours, the filling and then the springform for the setting "overnight" and frost before serving... seriously good..and although I think I messed it up many times... this was absolutely delicious!!  I got a few requests to make this for "special orders".. sorry..but I am good for a while.  Hope this helps.

This recipe is a keeper! It is a very good tiramisu flavor.   I followed the majority of the comments:  Used mascarpone cheese substitute -> 8 0z cream cheese + 2.5 T sour cream + 1/4 cup cream.  Made 2 cakes with 4x espresso coffee powder mixed into the remaining cake mix plus 2x coffee liquer (Kahlua) and 2 teaspoons of unsweetened cocoa powder.  I also used espresso coffee shots for brewed coffee.  I served only 7 people and they ate the whole cake after a very big lunch!  Try this - it is really good.

This was very well received last night.  I did things a little differently since I was pressed for time but the results I'm sure were just as tasty.  Rather than layering, I made this in a 9x13 inch pan.  I poked holes all in the cake and brushed it with some left over hot coffee. I used cream cheese instead of mascarpone and spread the filling layer over the cake and then the frosting.  It turned out delicious and saved me lots of time and clean-up.  Tiramisu is one of my favorite desserts and this was a nice alternative.  Thanks bunches!

Not being a lover of cake in general, cakes made with box cake mixes in particular do not tend to tickle my taste buds.  I made this for a dessert buffet at Thanksgiving, however, and have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I used strong espresso coffee and a little extra Kahlua, and found the flavor to be just perfect.  It keeps very well in the fridge so it is a home run for entertaining, being both easy and able to be made ahead.

Did not taste like Tiramisu to us, but the WAS delicious! I did not have coffee flavored liqueur so I used brewed coffee and instant coffee mixed together whenever the recipe called for the coffee liqueur with some sugar mixed in to make a light coffee syrup. Also did not have Marscapone cheese, so I did what another user suggested and used a substitute of 2 packages of cream cheese, 1/2 cup of heavy cream, and 3 heaping teaspoons of sour cream. Everyone loved the cream cheese part the most! Even though it did not have that distinct Tiramisu taste, it was still a wonderful cake that I will be making again and again. Thank you!

EDIT: I just wanted to add, after this sat in the fridge overnight it was 100 times better and had more "tiramisu" flavor. Love it!

An amazing cake. I wanted to make a Tiramisu for the first time but the cooking egg yolks didn't interest me so I made this instead. As written this is a fantastic cake with a hint of Tiramisu flavor, and for my tastes I want it to be a substitute for the dessert so I will increase the coffee in the cake by at least double and will triple or maybe even quadruple the coffee glaze next time, as soaked as I can go without collapsing the cake. I did think the icing and filling were PERFECT as is. No problems with this impressive treat, thanks so much for sharing!

I used 3 tsp instant espresso powder mixed with a tsp of water to put into the cake - and I put it into two of the layers. I used a whole cup of coffee. I used 4 tbsp Kahlua every time it called for coffee liquer. Nobody could taste the kahlua even then. It took me 11-12 minutes to whip the heavy whipping cream into whipped cream, and I did use another reviewer's suggestion of adding 2 tsp of vanilla pudding instant mix. I lined the bottom of the pans with wax paper so the cakes would come out okay, and I used the suggestion to put the cake in-pan on a rack for 15 minutes, then poke holes and pour coffee, then freeze for 20 minutes. I dusted each layer's filling with cocoa powder as another suggested as well. After assembling I needed to refrigerate about an hour before I could frost - it was starting to slip but was fine after that. I tried making curls by softening the chocolate and hardening the chocolate until it was the right consistency but still only got curves instead of curls. Everyone liked it, but I thought it was kinda average. Personally, I'd rather modify the Amaretto Divine cake to be tiramisu flavor than go through this one again... so much more work.

This was so good!  It tasted just like a tiramisu made with lady fingers, I thought.  There was plenty of filling and frosting.  I would have liked a little more of the coffee/liqueur mixture.  Next time I think I might double it.  I have never been successful making chocolate curls.  After another unsuccessful attempt, I watched some youtube videos and I finally think I am ready for my next try!

I made this yesterday, and the finished product was so beautiful that it looked professionally made.  It tasted wonderful, too!  I made 2 of the 3 layers with coffee powder and placed the white layer in between.  I also doubled the amount of coffee flavored liqueur everywhere it was in the recipe.  I used instant espresso instead of coffee.  It was delicious.  Great recipe!

OMG- this is the BEST cake I have ever made.We had to bring an Italian dessert to a dinner party for 10 so I decided to try this recipe based on all the rave reviews that I read. It was AWESOME! I followed the advice that most reviewers said to make two of the layers with the coffee flavor and one with the plain using three 8" pans. I doubled the filling layer, (it almost seemed like that was too much but do it anyway- you won't be sorry) and also doubled the Kahlua everywhere else it was called for. I was afraid the finished cake wouldn't be high enough to be "impressive" but once you add the filling and put the frosting on, it was perfect. So light and fluffy. My husband said this is now his favorite cake. I can't wait to make it again.

This is an wonderful dessert.  My only change was that I couldn't find mascarpone cheese.  I did find a recipe for a substitute online that called for 8 oz. cream cheese, 3 T. sour cream and 2 T. heavy whipping cream.  That worked well in place of the mascarpone cheese.  Other than that, it was fabulous!!!

This cake tasted good, but I think you have to modify the recipe A LOT, as suggested in other reviews. My husband and I agree that we would prefer all THREE layers of cake to have coffee powder added to it. I only put it in two layers, as suggested, but I think the coffee drizzled on top of the layers doesn't give it as much of a coffee punch as real Tiramisu made with espresso. The icing is delicious! 

Here's a few tips to help with this recipe:
--Use 4 teaspoons coffee powder in AT LEAST two layers of the cake.
--Use heavy WHIPPING cream. Place a metal bowl in the freezer for a few minutes first and it will whip up great.
--I made a mascarpone-like cheese for the filling. I have used mascarpone before, but this substitute worked just as well with ingredients I already had on hand: mix 1 (8-oz) container cream cheese, 3 Tablespoons sour cream, and 2 Tablespoons heavy whipping cream (steal a little from what you'll be using for the frosting) together,  then add the confectioners' sugar and liqueur. Hope this helps!

Based on the ratings and relatively simple preparation, I decided to make this for the first time to donate to a dessert auction.  I followed the directions explicitly and every step went as expected.  The cake brought a tidy sum but more importantly, the buyer actually cut it on site and served it to his table . . . and then came looking for the baker.  I've already received a request for another cake.  Definitely a hit -- and I haven't even tasted it yet.

This cake was awesome!  I really used it as a starting point, having never made tiramisu cake before.  After looking at several recipes, this one seemed the best.  While reading the cake package directions, it suggested using 4 egg whites instead of 3 whole eggs - to make it have lower cholesterol.  However, I discovered that using just the whites, as well as adding a tablespoon of meringue powder (which was my experiment for the day), made the cake so light and fluffy, it was so MUCH better than the regular method!  I made only two layers, though, having only two pans; but torted each layer so that I ended up with two layers of each kind.  This meant needing more filling, and not having another container of mascarpone I used softened cream cheese.  I also added a cup of sour cream to the filling, based on a different recipe; but that extended the filling so that I had enough for all three layers.  At any rate - my cake appeared to be a hit at a BBQ I took it to tonight, and it certainly tasted divine.  I definitely will be thinking of this cake every time I have leftover coffee - I made my own coffee syrup, which I used instead of liqueur so that I could just use what I had on hand.  Personally, I think this cake would make a great wedding cake with the adjustments I made based on what I had on hand.  Also, I made the Wilton buttercream icing recipe using my coffee syrup in place of the water, since I didn't want to buy anything.  That worked wonders for the cake!

Very easy to prepare.  Surpisingly light and absolutely delicious!  The only things I did differently was to substitute cream cheese for the mascarpone and added 1 Tbs. of unsweetened cocoa powder to the coffee-flavored batter.  Kahlua was my liqueur.  Will definitely be making this cake again, and again, and again...

I feel the need to write some extra praise for this recipe because it is that great. I am actually getting ready to make this cake again for Christmas meal for some friends. First, i have to say that I have never tried to make it without the mascarpone. I have no idea how it would taste without it, but even though I have to pay $10 for a container of fancy cheese, I absolutely love the end product. I have always made this cake with brewed coffee and and poured 2 TB of Kahlua in the cake batter, rather than coffee. I will try with instant coffee on the batter this time, but I still prefer brewed coffee for when I pour over the cake layers. I have never made the chocolate swirls before either and i'll give them a try tomorrow. it is my absolute favorite recipe. I followed first time exactly, except I used double Kahlua where recipe asked for it, and 1 cup brewed strong coffee. And I do mean strong. I always only bake 2 layers (8"), but it's enough tall. I use Duncan Hines yellow moist cake and it never disappoints. It's the best cake on this website, in my opinion.

This is a wonderful recipe, I just loved it. I made it exactally how its listed - for those having trouble with the frosting, you just got to have a little more patience and mix it longer - it will thicken up! I made if for my boyfriends birthday and he loved it! I will make this cake again with no doubt!

If I could give this cake 10 stars..I would!  Easy to make and not as sweet as traditional cake.  I agree with the others who said double the coffee and coffee liquor.  Give this one a try, you'll be glad you did!

This cake is AMAZING! I made it for my little brother's birthday because he is a fan of coffee. I was very impressed with it and it was pretty easy compared to other three layer cakes I have made. The hardest thing was cleanup, I used at least four bowls for the whole thing and that includes washing some during the process. I used a recipe on this site called "Simple White Cake" because I'm not a fan of boxed cakes, but they would save time. I followed other suggestions and made two layers using the instant coffee powder and doubled what was called for. I also doubled the amount of liqueur and used a mascarpone cheese substitute I found on google (8 oz cream cheese, 3 Tbsp. sour cream, 2 Tbsp. heavy cream) just because I couldn't find any and it tasted great and was probably cheaper.  I received nothing but praise and my grandmother even claimed that it was "the best cake she has had in years!" I will definitely make in the future and pass on!

This was a fantastic recipe.  I made it for my grandmother's 80th birthday party and was still getting rave reviews by phone 4 weeks later when the last of it was pulled from her freezer.  Now my family insists that I make it for all functions, or even just visits.  I didn't use much of the coffee liquer since my grandmother can't handle the burn of alcohol very well, and I replaced the marscapone with a subsitute I found on this site (next time I'll be doubling the cheese portion as well since it wasn't thick enough for my tastes.)  This is beyond a keeper and may become a new signature cake.

If this seems like too much work, try making this cake in a 13 x 9 pan.  After you mix cake batter, pour 2/3 of it into pan.  Then drop spoonfulls of the coffee flavored batter & swirl (like a marble cake).  When it is done cut in half horizontally and put filling in between layers & put back into baking pan.  Frost the top only.  I have also made this in individual serving dishes.  To save money substituting cream cheese for the mascarpone works well.

This cake is OUTSTANDING!  Lots of raves and one of my favorites.  I could not find the mascarpone cheese, so I used regular cream cheese.  I also used a cup of Pampered Chef's flavored coffee (1/3 C. per layer) and for the dusting, I combined Ghiradelli's Mocha Hot Chocolate, Cocoa and International's brand instant coffee-Swisse Mocha flavor in order to take the edge off of pure Cocoa as well as combine the coffee/chocolate flavors of the cake.  Molto Bene!

This looked so fancy, and tasted fancy too! I used a classic white cake recipe so that I was able to claim that I actually made the whole thing myself from SCRATCH (though it took a little longer). This was my first time making a cake and from this one, I feel like an expert. It was a bit hard to frost the cake since the whip cream frosting was so light, but I got the hang of it after awhile, and the taste of the frosting with the cake was worth the work! Next time, and BOY will there be next times, I will make more than just a 1/4 cup of the coffee mixture to pour onto the cake layers because I would really like that flavor to stand out a bit more as well as add some extra moistness to the cake. And I'll make more of the frosting too, since that was so good that I'd like a thicker layer of it on the cake (I started running out while frosting...too many licks). But other than that, this is a real winner. Thanks so much, Bettina, for sharing this fabulous recipe with us!!

I've made this cake several times now and it's a hit every time! I've followed all the different suggestions and I make 2 coffee layers and two plain. This makes for a really pretty layered cake look when you cut into it. One adjustment I've made is to add about 1/4 cup of heavy cream to the mascarpone/comfectioners' sugar mix and then whip it. This way you don't have to carefully fold the whip cream in and it comes out thicker and easier to spread. I love this recipe!

This recipe is PERFECT the way it is written.  I would strongly recommend making it exactly according to the directions using the correct ingredients (especially the mascarpone cheese), at least for the first time and then modify it.  I have made this 3 times and it turns out perfectly every time (except one time I think I whipped the heavy cream just a little too long.. beware of that!) I get asked for the recipe every time I make it.

Came out great.  Was a little worried after reading reviews, but turned out not to be that difficult and all so yummy.  Used 2 boxes of D.H. French Vanilla cake mix.  llike other reviews made two coffee layers, used ground espresso.  Doubled the kahlua in everything.  Froze the cakes in pan overnight, poured on the coffee/kahlua mixture in morning and then returned to freezer.  Beating heavy cream was no problem for me and made a wonderful light icing.  Coffee and kahlua flavor was not strong, but dont think it should be.  Very light dessert, will be making again!!

OMG! Super yummy!! Made this for Dad's dinner party--hit of the night!! Super light, suprisingly...
Only changes: needs a bit of a stronger taste-next time more coffee for sure, and just did chocolate shavings on top--veggie peeler didn't work. However, still TO DIE FOR!!! Takes a while to make and quite a bit of work, but so worth it!!! Everyone loves it!

I'm not an experienced baker, so I found this slightly tough to make. I made two coffee layers and froze them overnight, as some people suggested. I also doubled the Kahlua is just about everything. It turned out WONDERFULLY. I served it at my son's first birthday as an adult alternative to vanilla cake with vanilla frosting. Everyone loved it!

I cook a lot but don't do a lot of baking. Made this to take to a dinner party last night. WOW! Tiramisu is generally Really Good, or very average. This was out of the Park! Thanks! Be sure your whipped cream gets whipped REALLY firm.

Wow!  Made this as directed using Kahlua as the coffee liqueur.  Refrigerated overnight.  A wonderful, light and airy cake.  A definite show stopper.

Amazing tiramisu recipe! Although I didn't follow the recipe, I used it as a guide. I did not use white cake mix and instead I made lady finger cake. I didn't have mascapone cheese so I used cottage cheese and mexican sour cream in a blender. I also used vodka instead of some coffee liqueur. I added pecans in the filling and topping for texture. I soaked my sponge cake with coffee such as I would for tres leches cake only not as much. And, I also added mexican vanilla to filling topping and cake.

This cake was delicious!  I made two "coffee" cakes and one white cake and added 1-1 1/2 extra Tbls of coffee liquor to the coffee liquid to be poured on the cakes.  Other than that, I made the recipe as is.  Sooo good the longer it sets.  Thank you for sharing!

Another 10+ recipe ...tastes like a bakery cake. Simply delicious!  I made 2 layers instead of 3. I also used instant espresso coffee powder. Also doubled the coffee and Kahlua in all areas. I left one layer white cake and the second added a tblspn of the espresso powder.  My ISSUE began with the filling! My 2 layers cooked up beautifully ....but my filling was turning to disaster!  I used real marscapone cheese instead of the mock cream cheese version. And the filling after mixed with the Kahlua and powdered sugar was super thin and all I could envision was a mudslide. I asked my Allrecipe friends on Facebook...and they came through and saved me! Thanks to Cindy Lepp, VA Mom, and Princess Jenna who helped me save my cake.! I ended up adding an additional 1/4c of powdered sugar and about 3oz of cream cheese and re-whipped the filling. It was of perfect consistency.  All in all a huge success thanks to some very helpful friends....and I served this cake at my parents house on Christmtday with rave reviews! The flavors here ate incredible and it is so worth the work and efforts.  Thanks!

I've made this cake 3 times now for various birthday's and it's always the hit of the party. Not too sweet but still rich and delicious. I always add a little extra Kahlua and coffee to give it more moisture and I get my marscapone from Wal-Mart. It's much cheaper there. Great recipe!

Great cake.  Wonderful flavor, but labor-intensive and a little difficult to put together.  I made this for Father's Day.  My biggest problem was that the layers were too thin a nd they started to crumble and break apart during assembly even though I took one reviewer's advice to freeze them before assembly.  I froze them in plastic wrap for 4 hours and the middle layer still cracked and my cake came out like the Leaning Tower of Tiramisu.  I surrounded them with piroueetes and tied them with a ribbon, pulling the ribbon tight to try to get the cake to stop leaning, but it didn't work.  I used one reviwer's maescopone substitute and it was WAY WAY too much filling, so halve that substitute recipe.  I put about 3x as much Kahlua as called for and doubled the amount of instant coffee.  I also doubled the amount of brewed coffee, and subbed espresso besides.  I took one reviewer's advice about melting a bag of semisweet choco chips with shortening and refrigerating them in a rectangulaur container and then using a veggie peeler for curls.  16 oz. chips was way too much.  8 oz. plus 1 T. shortening would suffice for curls on top.  Do make this a day ahead of time and put all the ingredients in the fridge to harden them up before assembly or you may have a runny mess.

SUPERB! Super easy to make and knocked everyones socks off! I wont make regular Tiramisu again because this recipe is so memorable. Light, full of flavor. Had fun with garnishing, tried lady fingers, pirouette cookies, cocoa, chocolate curls - anything is great. Definitely double the liqueur everywhere it calls for it. YUMMO!

This is an AMAZING dessert on all accounts! I made this for a good friend's birthday. Her favorite dessert happens to be Tiramisu and this was absolutely perfect!  None of us are into alcohol so I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a bottle for the small amount needed. Instead, I substituted Davinci Kahlua gourmet syrup (like what you'd put in coffee drinks). It worked fabulously!  I also used instant Espresso powder instead of instant coffee. And I made two of the three layers coffee flavored, leaving the center layer as is.  I made perfect chocolate curls. The fresh whipped cream frosting is amazing!  Wonderful recipe and definitely competes with the most impressive I have ever made!

this cake is the best one I have ever made! Even my mom thought it was better than the classic recipe she usually uses when she makes tiramisu. One thing I did different from the recipe was that I used amaretto (disaronno) instead of kahlua.  Amaretto is an almond liqueur which gives a sweet flavor to the cake. I recommend it as amaretto is used in the classic tiramisu! The cake was very moist and I will make it again and again and again!

Absolutely amazing recipe - easy to make, with great results. I've made this many times, with the following changes : 
1) for the coffee layer, I use instant espresso granules  or double the amount of instant coffee
2) I use 1 cup of coffee for the coffee syrup (sometimes a little more). This gives the cake a more noticiable coffee flavor and keeps it nice and moist. 
3) I substitute cream cheese for the mascarpone cheese
4)  I substitute an equal amount of brewed espresso for the coffee liquer 

Additional tip - 
1) Freeze the cake layers, and refrigerate the frosting and filling before assembling. It makes it a lot easier to assemble.
2) This cake tastes much better when made a day ahead

Be sure to turn the layers upside down when stacking on plate and this way you can "spoon" the coffee mixture onto the layers. No need for brushing or poking holes in cake, if the layers are upside down, it seems to absorb very well. I doubled the filling but it was way too much. I also doubled the frosting and it was also too much. Made 2 coffee layers and 1 plain white as others suggested and tripled the amount of coffee/liquor mixture in order for the cake layers to be sufficiently soaked with mixture. Delicious!

I got rave reviews on this.  I did as others said, and made one white layer and 2 coffee layers.  I made this for a New Year's Eve party, and everyone said it was really, really good.  My brother in law who never eats cake had 2 pieces.  The only thing negative were that 2 of my sisters in law said you could really taste the Kahula.  I followed the recipe for the liquor amount exactly.  I will make this again, only next time, cut back by about 1 or 1&1/2 T. of Kahula.  I made this two days ahead of time like others said to do.  I was worried that the Whip Cream frosting would dry up, but no worries.  It was great.  The only other difference I made was using an instant mocha mix instead of instant coffee.  We don't drink instant, and I couldn't justify to myself spending $3-$4 for something just to throw it out.  At Stater Bros I found a 1 serving pkg. of an Instant Mocha Latte for only .59 cents.  I used it all in the two layers.  Thanks so much for the great reciped Bettina!

As most reviewers have stated this cake is delicous.  Very quick and easy to put together and it looks almost too beautiful to cut into.  I was a little worried because neither me or my family drinks alcohol and I didn't want the cake to taste too much like liquer, but it didn't at all.  I did double the kahlua every where it was called for and I was pleasently surprised.  I made 2 coffee layers and added 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder with the coffee granules.  I poured almost 3/4 cup of coffee/kahlua over the layers and it was not too wet at all, just perfectly moist.  I used hazelnut coffee because that was all I had on hand.  I used heavy whipping cream for the icing and it was the best icing I have ever had, let alone made.  I couldn't find marscapone cheese so I grabbed a tub of ready to use cheesecake filling and stirred the kahlua into that.  It was cheap and it made a lot so I had double the filling.  I used the side of my box grater to shave a dark chocolate bar and it made beautiful curls.  This was the best cake I have ever made and I will absolutely make it again.

This almost turned into a disaster for me.  I made the cakes the night before a facy neighborhood dinner party.  I left them on the counter to cool overnight.  When I got up in the morning the dog had eaten part of two of the cakes.  I started baking again. Not a problem, but then I couldn't find marscarpone cheese so I substituted ricotta....way too runny.  The cakes kept sliding off each other when I tried to put them together with the filling.  And the chocolate curls - well they just were not in the mood to curl. In the end I wound up turnng the mess I had on my hands into a trifle.  People raved over it and wanted the recipe.  Hmmmm.  How does this sound?  "First bake three layers and let the dog eat two!"

Outstanding!  I've taken this to a few dinner parties, and people nearly collapse when they see it, and then they rave about it when they actually taste it!  Even people who don't like coffee have gone bananas over it!  I made a few slight alterations to it, by using instant coffee (dissolved in a tiny bit of water)instead of liqueur in the frosting, rum instead of the liqueur in the filling, and I used at least two cups of coffee (in total) to pour over the layers, instead of just 1/4 cup.  (It seems that the more coffee I poured over it, the better folks liked it.)  This one is a keeper!

I made this last night, so cool and smooth and luscious on a hot summers evening. I have made many traditional Tiramisu's this is nice for a change. I used a scratch cake recipe Simple White Cake; from this site I doubled the recipe. I did have to change the addition of the coffee liquor (some people can't have any alcohol. So I made a simple syrup and, instant coffee for the cake, same instant coffee for the filling. I did come up with an idea for the whipped cream; I added the Kahlua to 1 cup of whipping cream and brought to the boil simmered for a few minutes to burn off the alcohol it cooks down a little so just add enough to bring it back to the right measurement. I chilled with the other cup of whipping cream when it was time to beat it worked like a charm. For some people that had trouble with the "Frosting" being to soft I put my bowl and beater in the freezer helps with the beating especially when the kitchen is warm  and I added a packet of whipped cream stabilizer, kept my cream on the cake and looking fabulous. I beat a little more whipping cream and placed dollops around the edge of the cake after topping the cake with chocolate shavings then placed an espresso bean on each dollop. Lots of ooo's and ah's. My son who's 16th Birthday is in September has asked for this cake. I will make it in two 9x13 pans and layer it. I wish I had taken a picture of my cake but by the time I thought of it there wasn't much left I will try to remember to take one of my next cake.

I made this cake for our Valentine Party last night (2-17) and it was a huge hit.  I used a cup of coffee and 4 tablespoons of Kaluha to pour over the cake - it was wonderful - the flavor was not too strong at all.  I made and put together the cake and filling the day before and then frosted the cake about 5 hours before the party.  I did not notice that I was to put a half cup of the frosting in the filling - but it was fine without doing that.  I noticed some people in their review said their filling was runny - if you use mascarpone cheese - don't soften it!  It should be used right out of the container.  I did use the mascarpone cheese although it is pricey, it think it is worth the cost.  I used European Cocoa on the top and then the chocolate curls over that.  There's only one small piece left -I'm hoping my husband says, "You eat it, honey."  :)

I really struggled with this recipe.  For one thing, there were no 18.25 oz cake mixes in any of the three stores I went to.  Maybe they're making them smaller than when this recipe was originally posted.  The largest I could find was 16.5 oz and my layers came out looking like pancakes.  I threw the first batch out, went back to the store and bought two more mixes.  I baked the first with the coffee, splitting the batter between two pans and, by the way, I added the instant coffee to the cup of water called for with the mix.  Then I made the second mix with just white.  I put one layer in the freezer, so had one white and two coffee.   I made the filling, did the poking, brushed on a half cup of coffee and liquor, using instant, put the layers together and went to bed.  So that took several hours.  The next morning, I woke up and watched the video again and realized I needed to put some of the filling in the frosting.  It doesn't mention that in the ingredients; only in the instructions.  I had to disassemble my layers, scrape off some filling full of crumbs and put it back together.  I made three cups of whipped cream and had far more than I could put on my now giant cake.  But I served the extra alongside, so people could add more.  Everyone loved it, so I guess that's the bottom line.  But it takes far longer than two hours, when you factor in the time to let the layers and filling cool and the flavors to meld.

I have made this cake twice now for teacher luncheons and have gotten rave reviews. The presentation is beautiful and it tastes amazing. I stuck pretty much to the recipe except for a couple of changes. I didn't like the texture of the coffee granules in the cake the first time and like others I also wanted two coffee layers. I only had two 9 in round pans so I put 1/3 of white batter in one pan. I then mixed the coffee granules in 1 tablespoon hot water and added it to the other 2/3 batter and put it in the other 9 inch pan. The pan with more batter will need to bake a little longer. When it was done and cooled I cut it in half using a large piece of dental floss. Wrap it completely around the cake positioned in the middle, cross the strands and pull in opposite directions until sliced in half. Assemble with white layer in the middle. Awesome cake and works great made a day ahead!

Delicious! I gave 5 stars even though I changed it a little bit (don't hate me!). I made two coffee layers and one white layer. Due to personal preference I did not use the coffee liqueur but just stronger coffee. The mascarpone cheese was just too expensive so I substituted one brick of cream cheese with a small amount of cream, and powdered sugar. Did not poke holes and soak cake but merely brushed the layers with coffee before assembly. I whipped the cream with a little powdered sugar (no coffee or anything else in the frosting), and frosted the cake. Made the day before Easter and let it set up in the fridge. RAVE REVIEWS from everyone!! The comments were "nice and light", and "I love the subtle coffee flavor." I'm so pleased with this recipe!! Will make again sometime.

I have baked and tried a lot of different kinds of cakes. I can officially announce that from now on this is my favorite cake ever. I followed the recipe, except for a few changes: 1) used 1/2 chocolate cake mix for one of the three layers; 2) infused all of my layers with more liqueur than what is directed in the recipe; 2) added instant coffee granules into the filling recipe and also into the frosting recipe 3) made my own mascarpone cheese out of 8 oz cream cheese, 3 tbsp sour cream and 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream 
The cake turned out light and at the same time very flavorful. It just melted in my mouth.....

Awesome!  I doubled the coffee powder, coffee, and liqueur and mixed it into the entire batter.  Everything else I kept the same.  Since I had only 2 rounds, that made both rounds coffee flavored.  Everything else was kept the same as instructions.  My mom said it was so good she was bringing it the big family Christmas party!

I tried this recipe because I couldn't find lady fingers or marcapone cheese in any stores in my area.  Next time I will puchase a tiramisu cake from a local restaurant.  I worked on this cake for 2 days.  Very disappointing.  Not alot of flavor.  No one in my family had ever tried tiramisu before.  I doubt any one of them will ever want to try it again.

this is really good. I have made it as a cake and also made it as a trifle. I cut up all the cake in cubes and layered the ingredients. It's good either way, but making it as a trifle is WAY easier!

This was a fabulous cake!  I couldn't stay out of it.  I agree with other reviews that you basically need to double the coffee liqueur for the extra flavor.

OH my GOOD.  This cake was a huge hit with even my picky eaters.  Like suggested, I used the substitute for marscapone and it tasted great as the filling.  I would make this in advance, the extra day allows the coffee flavor to set into the cake and the filling taste to soften - each day after making it was a little bit better!

I added more coffee but did not double the liqueur as others suggested. I have made this several times, as family members have requested it for special occasions after the first time I made it. My favorite variation so far is with a good yellow butter cake instead of the white cake.

5 stars...if i could give this more I would! I made a few changes...of course. I used cappucino mix instead of instant cofee (just b/c I had it in the pantry)..it worked out very well. I did add more sugar to the whipped cream icing/frosting just b/c we love sweet, sweet things at our house...This recipe is WAY better than tradtional tiramisu and also easier in my opinion! Try it!

Great recipe.  My 13 year old son made it -- so it's not only delicious but it's easy.   Every single person who ate it came back for seconds.   I would make the following suggestions:  I agree with many other reviewers that you can and should kick up the level of coffee & coffee liqueur.   As written the recipe has a very mild flavor, which is fine for those who don't like a strong tiramisu, but I can already tell that next time we're going to add more coffee powder and more Kahlua.   Also, if your budget permits I would suggest doubling the amount of filling, especially if you are making all three layers.   We made only two (ran out of pans) and could have easily put in more filling.  We froze the night before and removed it from the freezer two hours before serving; it was fine. Enjoy!  This is great.

Very good recipe! Used a german chocolate cake mix! I added Coffee Tequila and doubled it everywhere it called for it. I also replaced 1/3 of the water for the cake mix with strong brewed coffee. This was spectacular!!

One of the best cakes I have ever made!!!  I did make some of the changes suggested though.
1.  I doubled the Kahlua (coffee liqueor) everywhere it was called for.  
2.  I used chocolate coffee beans instead of regular coffee beans and I ground them to a fine powder.  This helped make the cake look more mocha instead of spotty like poppy seeds.
3.  I used 1 and 1/2 boxes of cake mix as this was for a cake contest so I needed it to look BIG!  I had to make 2 cakes for it so I ended up using 3 boxes.
4.  I also wanted the filling to be a bit thicker in between layers as the filling and frosting are what truly makes this cake so I used 1 and 1/2 of everything.
5.  Make sure and use the HEAVY whipping cream as I used regular whipping cream on  one of my 'practice' cakes and the frosting and filling were not as thick and slid off.
6.  I made 3 layers per cake, 2 were with  coffee grounds and the middle layer was plain.  I did not drizzle the coffee in as I didnt want it to get too soggy.  I made the cakes the night prior and put them in the fridge (covered) so that they were nice and cold when I assembled them.

Our cake contest is not complete yet.. we judge 2 cakes per week over several weeks... but several people have told me that I won already!!!  I will keep you updated. 

Thanks for the GREAT recipe!

I have made this cake three times in less than a month - it is that good.  I love the light texture and taste - a nice change from desserts that are super rich and dense.  I made one change - I didn't have the mascarpone cheese, so I made my filling using 3 oz of cream cheese, and a package of vanilla pudding.  I mixed with enough milk (1 1/2 cups?) to make a creamy consistency, and flavoured with coffee. It was really nice and creamy and added great flavor, so it's a good substitution.

I brought this to a dinner party and must admit I didn't get rave reviews. My friend who LOVES tiramisu was not that impressed, she said too much Kahlua. I actually agree BUT I am giving it 5 stars because I thought it was absolutely delicious. I made it again yesterday simply because I wanted to perfect it...... 1st time I used "Heavy Whipping Cream" and the frosting was great.... I did 2 coffee layers and it was delish, a little too much Kahlua for my tastes. 2nd time I used just Heavy Cream and it didn't whip good at all. I whipped it for twice as long as the previous time and it wouldn't form. Don't know why. 2nd time I did as the recipe called, 1 coffee layer, I like it better this way.... although I did pour more coffee onto the layers. Depending on your tastes, I would cut back the Kahlua. Also, it's so easy to pour the coffee on the cakes if you flip them over. That's what I did and it came out great. This cake is extremely easy to make (in my opinion) and very pretty.

Want a lighter version and just as tasty?..use an angel food cake sliced into 4 layers.   Poke holes in the cake and soak with the coffee syrup.  Frost with whip cream and chocolate shavings.
Yummy

This is seriously superb! I would call myself a beginner (this is my first cake recipe) and it was surprisingly easy. Hey if I can make it and have it taste this good then anyone can. SOME CHANGES I MADE WERE:
1. Instead of 1 1/4 cup of water for the cake batter, I put 1/4 coffeee and 1 cup of water.
2. I would also recommend to double the coffee and liqueur mixture (1/2 cup of coffee and 2 tbsp of liqueur) I think this gives it more of a "tiramisu" consistency by soaking it up a bit more.
3. Kahlua worked wonderfully
4. Make sure to cool it longer so the filling and frosting really take form. (maybe even stick it in the freezer for 15 min or so)

Otherwise this is fantastic!

This cake is TOO good!  I made it for my son's 19th birthday and it was gone in two days.  If you want to up the coffee flavor, I would suggest preparing more of the coffee mixture that you pour (I used a pastry brush; easier and more even coverage) over the cake layers and leaving the rest of the recipe as is.  It is a lot of whipped cream, but is so light-tasting you'll be glad you made so much!  Truly a wonderful cake.

I just made this cake today for a birthday.  It is fantastic!  Our local grocery store didn't have mascarpone cheese so I used cream cheese instead. The cake turned out beautiful.  Thanks for submitting the recipe.

This cake is awesome! I've made it twice. My husband loves tiramisu and he thought this was better than the one from the little Italian bakery around the corner. Here is a FIX TO THE RUNNY MASCARPONE: 16 oz mascarpone, 1/4 cup sugar and 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream. Mix mascarpone and sugar until creamy then add heavy cream until thickens. You can chill for up to 3 days. I even added 3 TBSP of coffee liqueur and it came out nice and thick. Try it, you will love it and so will your guests!

I've made this twice now and have been asked by my daughter to make this for her birthday.  She's pretty picky so I will give this 5 stars on that request alone!  Really though... Yummy moist cake.  Highly recommend!!

I made this cake for a culinary competition at my school. I won first place! I did alter the recipe though. Instead of using white cake, I made a sponge cake, (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/glorious-sponge-cake/detail.aspx). The cake absorbed the coffee much better and didn't get the unappealing mealy texture of wet cake. I also did 4 layers instead of 3, and doubled the amount of filling. I didn't mix any coffee into any of the cake layers, just gave them a good basting of brewed coffee. I didn't use coffee liqueur either, and you couldn't even tell. A real winner!

Made this twice.
First advice, if you want to use the cream cheese filling forget the sour cream. it gives it a weird tart/sour taste that does  NOT replicate that of mascarpone. for a 9 in cake, you'll only need 1 pack of 8oz cream cheese, 1/2 cup confectioner sugar, and 1/2 c heavy cream. beat the confectioner sugar and cream cheese till smooth and add the cream. proceed to beat on high for 30 seconds and chill.

As for as the frosting is concerned, i used 1.5 c heavy cream, 1/3c confectioner sugar, and 3 tablespoons of liqueur. if you have nonfat dry milk powder, add in a tablespoon with the sugar, it'll help with consistency.

1/4C coffee is nowhere enough for the cake. it left the cake dry with a light taste of coffee. second time around, i used 1/2C water. 4 teaspoon instant coffee powder, and 3 Tablespoons of liqueur/rum.

ladyfingers may be added to the outside of the cake, and you may finish up with a pretty ribbon and dust the cake with cocoa powder. It'll be a hit!

I used 'Heavenly White Cake' instead of a boxed mix, used Starbucks coffee liquer because it has a much stronger coffee taste than Kahlua, and had half marscapone, half whipped cream in the outer layer. I used a tbsp of coffee in the bottom layer and doubled the liquer everywhere. I thought the cake was still seriously lacking in coffee flavour so I whipped up a coffee sauce (coffee, sugar and heavy cream). I served each slice on top of the sauce. It was a huge hit! I'll serve it the same way next time, with the sauce. The recipe as written was only 3 stars but with my changes it's 5 stars and I think I preferred this to regular tiramisu. Thanks for the idea!

The cake overall is pretty delicious I love the coffee flavor of tiramisu, so I made the two layers the coffe ones and the white cake the middle layer! Although, I felt the need of a stronger coffee flavor-so I am going to put in more instant coffee next time!

This cake was absolutely amazing in taste, texture, and appearance. With the mascarpone cheese, the cake was truly a tiramisu flavored cake.  The flavors of the cake intensified after sitting in the fridge overnight, so I highly recommend making it a day before eating. I used Kahlua for the liqueur and increased the instant coffee powder to 4 tsp and the coffee to 1 cup. The cake still had a subtle coffee taste, but with the frosting and filling, it came together beautifully!  Bravo for this recipe!!!

This was so easy to make though I did a few things a little differently.  I made the first cake for my dad, and he doesn't really like to consume alcohol so I replaced the coffee liqueur with espresso for the most part.  I left the liqueur only in the mascarpone mixture.  Also, when I folded (twice now) the whipped cream mixture into the mascarpone mixture it got a little clumpy.  If I were to eat a clump, I would be totally grossed out, so after I folded it in thoroughly, I mixed it on medium high just enough so the lumps went away.  I also listened to another poster who said to put the instant coffee in two of the layer cakes rather than one which I highly recommended on flavor alone, though it is also more attractive - so I added 3 tablespoons of the instant coffee instead of just the one.  This is an amazing and amazingly easy recipe though.  Thank you for sharing!

This cake was wonderful!  I received many compliments.  I followed the recipe exactly.  When making the whipped frosting, it helped to put the bowl and beater in the freezer beforehand so they were nice and cold when I took them out and whipped the cream.

I absolutely love this recipe! I have made it several times already and it is always a huge hit! I will definitely continue to make this for a long time! Its very easy to make. I have also substituted ricotta cheese vs the marscapone, only because I couldn't find any at my local market, and that works well.

YUM!!!  I've made this cake twice now.  The first time was for my sister's birthday and everyone that tried it loved it.  I couldn't find marscapone cheese anywhere in my town so just used cream cheese and it was great.  The second time I made it was with my sister who wanted to make it for someone else's birthday.  I found a way to make marscapone cheese with cream cheese and powdered sugar so I tried that.  This cake takes a while to make with all the layers and cooling the cake but it's not that hard and it tastes so great.  I will definitely be making this again.  :)

This is the best tiramisu layer cake recipe I've ever had. I first made it a few years ago, and took it to work to share with my co-workers. It was such a beauty, they even took pictures of it before it was cut. The raved about the cake, and it's sooo delicious! You won't go wrong if you make this cake, even though it's American style tiramisu. I used two layers coffee flavored, and one layer white. Make this one for the upcoming holidays! You'll be in heaven.

A stellar success!  This is not an intimidating recipe (at all). Dressed in chocolate shavings, it makes a booming impression on the dessert table. Absolutely delectable, you can be sure nothing will be left over.  Great with Coffee and Baileys. YUM!

LOVE this recipe.  Also doubled liqueur (kahlua) wherever it was called for and added an extra layer of vanilla (added 3 TBS kahlua to the mix).  There were three layers:  one white; one coffee; one kahlua - incredibly tall - beautiful cake and DELICIOUS.  Made it for my husband's birthday and all guests said it was the best cake ever.  I agreed!  Thank you for posting such a WINNING recipe!

Ok- This was my first time making this cake for my husbands bday (its his favorite) Blown away! The only difference I made was to use Butter Shots instead of coffee liqueur (didn't have any on hand) and I ordered 2 expresso shots from Dunkin Donuts instead of using coffee powder. DELISH!

It was good, but kind of bland. Needed some more sweetness or flavorings. I was not impressed, expected more for the ratings received.

This cake was awesome... It was a total hit at the bridal shower I threw for a friend.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, except I doubled the coffee liquor.  Instead of brewed coffee, I added just a little over a 1/4 cup of espresso.  I garnished with the chocolate curl garnish and dark chocolate covered espresso beans.  Lovely and delicious!

I honestly expect more from this. This costs a lot to make between the marscapone cheese and the coffee liquor so I expect something amazing! It tasted more like a normal white cake with a hint of coffee aftertaste. I even doubled the liquor & coffee like reviews suggested. It also didn't turn out too pretty either! I placed my cakes in the freezer after I poured the coffee on them. Even after 4 hours they were still too moist and crumbled to bits! I think if I ever attempt a cake like this, since the cake mix requires water I will be using the coffee instead of the water and probably about 3/4 of a cup of it.

This recipe is definitely a keeper. I made it for my husband and some of our friends who all love tiramisu. Would recommend increasing the amount of coffee liqueur (I used kahlua). I used 3 tbsp of kahlua in the whipped topping and it came out well. I also found mascarpone cheese with coffee added to it add the grocery store, and this added a nice touch. I just added some kahlua to it and whipped it up. 

This cake should definitely be made a day or two ahead and refrigerated. I made it a day ahead and assembled it with just the mascarpone filling and coffee, and refrigerated it for a little under 24 hours. Took it out about an hour before my guests arrived and frosted it. I could not make the the chocolate curls, but it still tasted great with a dusting of cocoa powder on the top and a drizzle of melted milk chocolate on the side.

Not that this recipes needs any more RAVE reviews, this cake was sooo good I ate most of it by myself =D Yes, I did and with absolutely no shame! If you love tiramisu, you'll love this and the ease of putting this cake together is just another plus! If you don't like tiramisu, this just might convert you! Tips: Try to make it a day ahead of serving this cake; it seems to taste better after resting in the fridge for a day. If you don't have coffee flavored liqueur (or you thought you did like I did), just mix a teaspoon or so of instant coffee granules with some rum and you'll be good to go! So easy and so impressive!

EXCELLENT!! Don't let the instructions scare you off. It really isn't hard to make, just read and re-read the directions and also, watch the video. Just follow the directions. To make chocolate curls, you can also melt some chocolate on a cookie sheet, spreading as thin as possible. Let sit for several minutes to slightly harden. Then I use a metal cookie spatula, with a flat edge and run it under the chocolate. You can make them as wide  as you want. It will curl right up. Using a toothpick, pick up the curls and set on the cake. They turn out so pretty.  Mine was absolutely gorgeous and was so good! Another family favorite. Thank you bettina!

Excellent recipe!  I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the instant coffee in each cake layer (I also did two layers coffee, one without).  I also doubled the khalua and espresso in the filling and frosting.  After doing so I was a little concerned the coffee flavor would be overwhelming as I was adding it to every part of this recipe, but it was very subtle.  My first attempt at the mascarpone filling was a bit nerve-wracking.  I set the kitchen-aid to mix and turned my back for a little too long and in no time my filling had begun to separate/emulsify and resembled curdled milk -- eeek!  I was able to bring it back together by microwaving it for 15 seconds and adding a little milk to balance out the fat in the cheese and stabilize it.  I'll keep a better eye on it next time though!  Overall, this recipe turned out a rich yet light cake that proved very popular with all who tasted.  Thanks so much for sharing Bettina :)

I went through many of the reviews before deciding to make this cake, and I don't know what happened.  I followed the advice of others and made two coffee layers, doubled the coffee on those layers, and let them set in the pans refrigerated overnight.  When I went to remove them from the pans, it was an awful mess!  The cake was so soggy and mushy that they fell apart.  I couldn't even use the top third layer because it literally squished to pieces.  I ended up making it just the two layers, but my top piece ended up sliding off the mushy bottom.  Thank goodness my family didn't really care about the presentation!  As far as taste, I really didn't care for it even though some of my family liked it.  I don't think adding so much coffee to the cake really made a difference as it was still a slight flavor.  I think that if I followed the recipe as stated, I still wouldn't have liked it as much as other recipes on this site.  I doubt I make this again.

Turned out alright. Followed the direction, but wish I would've used more coffee. Not moist enough for our liking. Will try again, but will change it up just a bit.

The ease and the outcome of this cake = 5 stars!!! soooooo delish.  I would also almost triple the coffee liquid that is drizzled onto the cake.  Yummy!

I made this for a pregnant friend who couldn't have the kaluha, and I substituted double servings of a Starbucks Doubleshot (espresso and cream) for each serving of coffee flavored liquor.  It used about one whole 6.5 oz can.

I found a picture of a Tiramisu Wedding Cake when I googled it.  It's a 3 tier cake rimmed with chocolate drizzled ladyfingers wrapped in a beautiful ribbon.  I made this for my daughters Christening, because I was doing an Italian theme.  Flavors were perfect.  I bought instant espresso to put in cakes.  Used two layers coffee and one vanilla on each stack.  Used long dowels to hold all three tiers together.  Made the day before so flavors would meld together.  Would recommend this cake as a alternative to plain cake that is served at every party.  Everyone will want the recipe.  Good luck!

Wonderful, delicious, moist, tasty cake. I've made more traditional tiramisu before, but I actually like this cake batter recipe better, and it doesn't hurt that it's very easy to make. I did like other reviews said and used double the coffee liquer each time it was called for, and I also used a little extra coffee on the layers to make it a little more moist and coffee-tasting. The only other change I made was, as others recommended, made two of the layers with instant coffee mix and used them as the top and bottom layers. This recipe may become a tradition in my family!

Yum! I followed the recipe exactly for the filling and icing, but I'd been looking at this recipe for ages and never made it because it called for three cake pans of the same type. I didn't want to go and buy another two cake pans and I didn't want to use up an entire day just baking 1/3 of the cake. After reading through a different cake book, I had an epiphany! I would turn it into a marble cake! I used regular white cake mix and did half the batter plain and half the batter mixed with 4 tsps of coffee dissolved in 4 teaspoons warm water. I lined the base of my tin and used a big spoon to drop alternate spoonfuls into the tin. White, then coffee until all finished. Then I used a sharp knife, but a skewer would be better, to drag the batter back and forth to create a marbled effect. When the cake cooled, I split in half and filled and iced! So, if you're short on pans, this idea works well. Really great cake.

This was really good.  It takes a little while to make even with the boxed cake recipe, but it was fun.  I had trouble with the topping, it never seemed to get fluffy enough and ran off at the cake a little.  I didn't want to beat it too long, but probably needed to go longer. It seemed funny that my teenage son didn't like the coffee in it, because he is the only person in my family that drinks coffee. The recipe to make mascarpone I found in the reviews helped, because you can't buy it in the small town I live in.  I will be making this again, often.

OMG. this recipe had everyone in my family freaking out. in a good way. definetly had to make a few changes but i am giving it 5 stars becasue the adjustments are minor and are only made because i LOVE coffee and will do anything to get more of it. Basically it should be two layers of coffee and one white. you have to do the duncan hines white because it is so soft and spongey. Oh and you should dissolve the instant coffee in like a 1/4 cup of water first. I doubled the coffee crystals for the cake batter. I also use three 9 in pans. oh and a piece of parchment paper on the bottom of each pan is a huge help because the cakes are so light and fluffy, they are more prone to falling apart if you work them too hard. Also, i did not like the idea of drenching the cakes in kahlua and coffee, so i brushed it on with a pastry brush instead and that was plenty. I also did have to add a little more powdered sugar to the whipped cream to get it to a consistency that was spreadable. I also found ladyfingers at the Top Foods nearby and could only find the hard kinds so i dunked them once in brewed coffee and decorated the sides of the cake with that. It looked beautiful. I also dusted the top with cocoa powder and then did semisweet choc shavings on top. What i do is use leftover choc chips, melt them in a double boiler, and then mold it in a smaller square container so they are like a choc bar that i can make shavings with a vegetable peeler. If you want perfect curls, you have to make s

Love this cake!! Have baked it twice this week.  I tried Pillsbury and Duncan Hines moist white cake and prefer Duncan Hines, Pillsbury crumbled when picked up with fork, DH kept its form.  I did increase coffee and Kahlua and whipped 3 cups of cream, which I am glad I did because 2c was not enough.  The mascarpone cheese was pricy but was worth every penny, I don't think I will substitute, this cake deserves the best of ingredients.  I will be making this forever.

yes, this recipe is worth every star!!  it is the easiest tiramisu recipe i've made, and probably the best too.  i  usually dont change the recipe the first time i make it, but with all the reviewers saying double the liquor and coffe everywhere in the recipe, that is what i did.  and i am glad i did because the taste turned out perfect - and i am definitely not a coffee drinker.  i was worried about the frosting since it wasnt a traditional frosting, but it was perfect for the cake. yum!  yum!  yum!  the only strange thing for me was where it said to add coffee powder to the batter.  i did that and my coffee was granules, not powder (dont know if there is such a thing as coffee powder since i'm not a drinker) so it was kinda like having poppy seeds (a TINY bit of a texture) in the batter.  but it was still good, just kinda odd.  will be making this again...but not anytime soon because it's addictive! thanks so much for the recipe!

Make this cake for that cookout, baby shower, whatever!  I doubled everywhere that called for coffee and coffee flavored liqueur and made the center layer the plain one and the bottom and top coffee flavored and the coffee flavor was still subtle and light tasting!!  Absolutely excellent recipe!!!

If you like baking with coffee, or just like coffee period, I strongly suggest purchasing a toddy. I bought one about two months ago and I cannot believe how wonderful the coffee is from it. They have a website, or you can find one on amazon. 

Also, there are several substitutes for mascarpone- take a look at: http://www.pastrywiz.com/season/tira2.htm

I loved loved loved the frosting. The reason for 4 instead of 5 stars was the fact that I did not like the texture of the cake. I think next time I will try sponge cake or pound cake and soak it in the coffee mixture. Also I thought by splitting it among 3 layers made it too thick, I think I would like it divided into two layers better with the filling between. Overall a good recipe

This was a big hit at our small group!  I made two 9" rounds, one with a little extra, and cut the bigger one in two.  I also used the cream cheese substitute for the mascarpone.  Also doubled the coffee/liquor and used it all.  It came out very moist and delicious.

The taste was amazing!!! I had a hard time w/this cake though, most likely because I'm still a beginner and learning but I didnt like the outside of the cake, it was too runny for me! Also I used coffee granules but they stayed whole granules. I will DEFINITELY make this again, but follow others suggestions and try something different.

O.M.G.!!!  Ya Baby!  I foolishly made the Simple White Cake on this site to use for this Tiramisu cake.  (I am a little surprised I can't find a homemade white cake recipe that's as good as a cake mix, but to be fair, I haven't looked THAT hard.)  I ran downtown this morning and bought white cake mix.  I'm ready for next time, and there will be MANY next times.  I did double the liqueur for the filling and thought it was just a touch too strong.  I used 2 Tbsp of liqueur for the frosting, but thought it wasn't quite strong enough.  Will try 3 Tbsp in both the filling and frosting next time.  My waistline is screaming, "NO, NO, NO," but my mouth full of Tiramisu Layer Cake is thanking you so very much Bettina.  My family thanks you too.  :)

Doubled the Kahlua everytime it was called for :-) Made a difference in flavor, and very good! To make the cake look professional, freeze the cake layers, then trim the sides and tops to be flat and cylindrical with a long-bladed knife with fine teeth before you stack them. I wanted the mascarpone cheese to stack tall so I froze the cake inbetween stacking each layer. I found I did not need to increase the filling called for. I had trouble keeping the whipped cream from running or separating, so I added WhipIt to it, worked fine and the cream stayed put. I also kept this cake very cold during assembly and before I served it. I shaved chocolate to adorn the top with curls, and placed whole coffee beans in a line around the base. I wanted to take a picture but the cake was gone before I could even get the camera! Delicious!

You will definitely want to add MUCH more cofee flavor to this cake.  My suggestion is to triple every step that calls for coffee (instant or regular coffee) I would also double the coffee liquor.  

My next suggestion would be to double the filling. The thin line of filling just didn't add enough taste.  

With some tweaking, this could be great.

This cake is absolutely the prettiest, tastiest cake.  It well deserves its 5 stars because it is easy, tasty and cuts into the most perfect slices.  It was better than the cakes we have been buying from the Italian bakery.  I want this to become my new "Classic" and will bring it everywhere I need to bring dessert.

Hm.. I've made this twice, so far.  The first time, it tasted excellent!  The "frosting" took f o r e v e r to set up, but that's probably just my own impatience.  I also used 4oz cream cheese and 4oz sour cream in exchange for the mascarpone.  The second time, we had just moved and I could not find coffee flavored liqueur anywhere (I know, it's weird) so I substituted it for Starbucks frappuccino and I highly recommend doing this.  It turned out as probably the best tasting tiramisu I've had!  My mom's a cake decorator and we even considered having her use this recipe for our wedding cake!

I made my own mascarpone cheese (8 0z. cream cheese, 2 T. butter and 1/4 c. heavy cream) and it came out great!  The only problem that I had was after I frosted the cake it began to fall apart and crack.  So I just picked up chunks of it and transfered it to a bowl. Looked sort of like a trifle and it was very easy to serve.  Everyone loved it and thought that it was supposed to be that way!

This cake is absolutely delicious! I've made it over 5 times and everyone always says it's the best cake they've EVER eaten. As stated, it does takes a couple of hours from start to finish (including cooling time and clean up) but it is worth it! I always use a cup of espresso coffee and sprinkle coffee grinds on top instead of cocoa. I've made it with both cream cheese and mascarpone and there is little difference. I don't usually find cream labelled "heavy" cream so I opt for Whipping Cream. I prefer using Kahlua liquor- it adds a really nice flavour. Make sure to make it the day before so the cake can absorb all these delicious flavours. I will be making this cake for many years!

Great recipe and wonderful taste. Next I make this (and I imagine I'll make this cake many more times) I will drizzle the layers with a little more coffee to obtain the soaked layers effect classic tiramisu has. The marscapone filling was a little grainy instead of smooth. Not sure why, but tasted greated.

Nice, moist cake and the frosting turned out great! I would have liked a bit more coffee flavor. I think I will increase the flavor crystals or add them to all layers. In addition, I would recommend using espresso instead of drip coffee.

This is really extremely good (5 stars) as written.  To make even better, I found that the following changes help:  Make two cake mixes.  Use espresso powder for a stronger taste and add 1 tablespoon to one of the cake mixes.  Cook the cakes as directed so that you end up with 4 thick layers.  Double the filling.  I also doubled the coffee liquor (so I ended up with 8 T total). Also - if you are in a hurry or don't have heavy cream, whip topping doubles as a quick frosting layer.

After making this twice this is what I learned also combined with others' suggestions: 
1. cake: easier to split batter in two, freeze about 2 hours, use bread knife to cut in half, there will be 4 layers instead of 3 and much easier to make; mixing instant coffee with 1/4 cup of water then add to batter helps to increase the coffee flavor
2. coffee/liquor: double or even triple to have enough to cover cake layers
3. filling: mascarpone makes a difference, use it, tip: 1/2 cup of frosting is needed in the filling - don't wait till the end to make the frosting.

Assembly - use a large bowl, you don't have to worry about frosting sides and tastes just as good!

It was a great recipe but it required so many revisions that I only gave it four stars instead of five. First I read all the reviews prior to making the cake and I want to thank everyone who took the time to leave such helpful tips. I made two layers with one coffee flavored and divided both layers into a four layer cake. I used Tia Maria liqueur instead of Kahlua because Tia Maria has a stronger coffee flavor. I also substituted instant espresso powder for the instant coffee (Medaglia D'Oro brand). The biggest problem was overcoming the artificial vanilla in the boxed cake mix. Never again will I use a box mix for this cake. I still doubled the liqueur every time the recipe called for it and I used a small spray bottle to spray the coffee/liqueur mixture onto the cake layers. The icing came out better than I imagined. I had nightmares about the icing from all the negative comments. Next time I will double the mascarpone mixture. Surprisingly this cake turned out fabulous thanks to all the helpful tips.

In all of the recipes over the years from this site, this is my all time favorite!  It does take a little time, but the cake is the absolute best!  It looks fantastic, too, so it's great for company.  We have made this cake over and over again at our place, and now family/friends ask for it on special occasions.

Loved this! I followed the instructions almost to a T but did what a lot of reviewers mentioned and made two coffee layers. I also doubled the coffee in the cake mix but decided not to double the liquor. I was worried I would regret not doubling the liquor, but it didn't seem to lack in flavor at all. I made and assembled it the day before my moms birthday and kept it in the fridge til serving time. It was a huge hit! Even the non-coffee lovers in our family loved it. One other thing I did differently was I actually used two cake mixes because I didn't want to have such thin layers. I used almost all of the batter, filling each pan til it was about half full. I loved having thicker cake layers and the frosting was still enough to cover my whole cake. I think next time I will try making this with a homemade cake recipe instead of box. My mom said I'm in charge of making all the birthday cakes from now on! :)

This cake was awesome...im only a teenager but it was pretty easy to make, with a little help. A couple things to make it even better: use 2 cake pans, and cut the plain cake in half. saves cleaning! also, definitely use a stand mixer to whip the icing...i tried it by hand and after 2 hours, (yes, 2 hours!), it didnt whip!!! but then, i tried using my mom's stand mixer, and it was done in two minutes!! one more thing, use mini chocolate chips for decor...it looks cool and tastes really good:) as for the taste...it tasted awesome! i'm making it for my dad on father's day, because he loves coffee!!!

Wonderful cake. It got rave reviews from my fam and friends.  For those of us who only keep 2 cake pans on hand...divide the batter in half, not thirds. When the cakes have cooled simply slice the cake in half.  Now you have 2 coffee and 2 white layers.  I couldn't decide which filling to use since everyone kept arguing over which is better.  I bought a 8oz $7 tub of marscapone and a brick of the cream cheese.  After mixing up my own with the sour cream and whipping cream my verdict is that the subtle difference between the two is not worth the cost. It tastes almost exactly the same...kinda weird until you add the sugar and booze. I made the coffee really strong and added instant esspresso powder and coffee liquor.  The coffee taste really isn't that strong after baking.  After they cooled I used a silicon pastry brush to baste my cakes.  It worked really well.  It was much easier to control the amount of liquid on the cake vs. pouring it from a cup.  I also beat my whipping cream on med. for 4 min then on high for the last two. badda bing nummy whipped cream at just the right consistancy. I also didn't add the liquor until I started the last two min. and the cream was already thicker.  This cake was much easier to put together than the recipe would lead you to believe.  
Don't be scared. Give this recipe a try. It's very impressive to most people.

This cake is OUTSTANDING!! It not only looks professional, but it even tastes as good or even better. All of the components are good the flavored whipped cream, the mascarpone cheese, the cake, and the chocolate. I was looking for a cake for a birthday and I decided to make this one. It was much more affordable than buying a similar fancy cake to. Not including the liqueur, it cost me $11 dollars to buy all of the ingredients which I basically didn't have. I was very tempted to decorate it my own way. However, after reading all of the great reviews I decided to make and decorated it exactly, which is rare. I am glad I did, because it really gives the cake that tiramisu appearance. The directions were so precise, and easy to follow, and I loved the fancy yet easy chocolate curl technique. Thank you, for posting such a nice cake recipe.

This cake is OUTSTANDING! I took the advice of others and doubled the Kahlua and made sure to refrigerate it so the frosting could set well. Note: I only found it necessary to whip the heavy cream about 2 1/2 minutes, overwhipping is not a good thing. Also the layers only baked about 12 minutes, not 20. Absolutely FABULOUS!!

I made this cake for 8 ladies for a bunco night. I got rave reviews from everyone  This cake was absolutely delicious!  It was easy to make and looked beautiful. It could have easily been on display in a bakery window.  I did increase the instant coffee in cake to two Tbl. as some of the other reviewers suggested. Otherwise kept recipe as written. I will definitely be making this cake again!

THE BEST EVER!!!!

-if youre using mascarpone substitute (8oz cream cheese, 2.5 tbsp sour cream, 1/4c heavy cream) refridgerate the finished cake overnight or more. It gets rid of the fresh sour cream taste- into a real mascarpone cheese taste!! Plus the icing sets in better.

-Use bittersweet chocolate for garnishing and coco powder

-like the other reviewers suggested, pour the coffee on the cake thats upside down because that soaks up better!!!

-Betty Crocker's white cake mix is not so good as before :((

-finally, yes... triple, double, the liquers, and make two coffee cake layers, not one because the coffee taste is very subtle.

I was disappointed by the way this cake turned out. I made it exactly as stated and it was good, but not what I expected. I think I was expecting something a little more moist and with more of a coffee/liquor taste. In hind sight, I should have just made tiramisu if that was what I was after. This may be better with more coffee/liquor added as other reviewers suggested.

I made this for Christmas and it was OUTSTANDING!!!!  I made the cakes the night before.  I followed some of the reviews and made 2 coffee layers and added 4 times the coffee powder.  I used Pillsbury White Cake mix because my store did not have the Duncan Hines.  The next morning I made the frosting and filling.  I also doubled the Kahlua in the frosting and filling.  I turned the cakes upside down when layering them.  Love this recipe.  It was so easy to make.  I will be making this over and over again!

This is a great, easy recipe. I make one pan of the coffee and one pan of the plain cake and just cut them so it was a 4 layer cake. I doubled the cofee/Liquor amount as per the reviews. I also made it a day ahead and let it sit in the fridge to setup. It looked pretty and tasted great.

I made this cake for Christmas, everyone loved it! It was so easy to make, the only thing I added was some finely chopped walnuts to the filling and some for garnish. It was a great combination. The taste was "melt in your mounth fantastic!"

Took all day and major cleanup to make this cake.  Hope it tastes good, but was way too much trouble however it tastes.  
Won't make it again.  Good luck!

I took this cake to a Holiday Potluck with friends, a real hit.  I decided to jazz it up for the party.  I made the cake into 3 pans, 2 a little fuller than the 3rd, and I cut them in half, making 5 cake layers. I drizzled each layer with a liquor, Bailey's, Kahula, Choco liquor.  I also took 1 cup of filling and added chopped cherries and 1 cup with Skor choco bar copped up.  5 layer cake, with different fillings in the middle.

Ummmmm-this is amazing.  My husband and I LOVE coffee so I used WAY more of the coffee liqueur- probably 5x as much and I put this into the frosting mixture.  Also, don't skip over the garnish. . . its more than that and it really elevates the entire cake. Worth the work!  Thanks for posting!

this cake was sooo delicious! i followed the recipe exactly and it was awesome, but i've also changed it up some and loved it! my new favorite is "toasted coconut mocha." the cake layers are the same, but i use coconut extract instead of coffee liqueur, and i put shredded coconut into the filling. i also added a second filling of cocoa powder, half n half, and powdered sugar, just adjusting each of those ingredients until it is the consistency i want and the correct sweetness to taste. WONDERFUL!!! =D

This cake was foolproof, light, creamy, and delicious. A real winner. I, too, doubled the coffee liquor, doubled the coffee powder in the cake mix (I used a Starbucks Via packet), and used espresso for the liquid coffee -- just to give the flavor a little boost.  Each bite was dreamy, yet not cloyingly sweet.

Searched for a Tiramisu recipe that didn't use raw eggs & came upon this gem. This was awesome! I made it for my Mom's surprise birthday party this weekend and it was greeted with rave reviews. I did layer it like a trifle as I was worried that the frosting layer wouldn't hold up when removed from the fridge. It was beautiful regardless! Next time I think I might double the filling as some reviewers have suggested because I would have liked a little more to balance out the frosting layer, but that's just my personal preference. Thanks bettina for posting this recipe!

I made this last October for my husband's birthday.  I actually made two of them one for him and one to share with friends and neighbors.  Everyone raved over this and it came out beautifully.  I use the photo of the one I baked as my profile photo.

I have made this twice now, once for my mother's 80th birthday and again for my 26 year old son.  Age does not make a difference, it is loved by everyone.  For a cake mix, I cannot believe how tender and moist this cake is.  I highly recommend to anyone.  Just remember, it is rather expensive to make.

Made this for a family gathering and it was a hit, even with family members who love tiramisu and enjoy it at nice Italian restaurants.  I chose this receipe because it does not require raw eggs.  Also, ended up using rum but only because it was more affordable than the larger bottle of coffee flavored liqueur. The flavor was  still very nice.  Thank you for the recipe and all the reviews and suggestions.  Will make it again sometime using the substitue marscarpone to see if it is much different.

This cake is moist and delicious and the mascarpone filling is outstanding. I added a little more coffee and coffee liquor than the recipe calls for. I also frosted the cake the night before and left it in the fridge.  It was perfect the following day.

I love making this cake for parties, everyone loves it. As mentioned before, I always add at least twice the amount of coffee. Because the cake is so moist, it helps if you freeze the layers.

Fantastic cake! After trying something new for dinner which was met with a less than enthusiastic response from my husband, this cake restored his faith in my culinary talent! Being coffee lovers, I decided to make 2 of the layers with coffee instead of just one and doubled the amount of instant coffee to 2 teaspoons. It turned out great! I will definitely be making this one again!

After reading all the reviews, I was a little dissapointed with the cake.  However, I think some of the success of the cake might depend on the cake mix you use.  I used Betty Crocker SuperMoist White Cake Mix, and even after pouring the Kahlua/coffee mixture on the cake, it still seemed a little dry.  I took the suggestions of former reviews and doubled the Kahlua to 2 Tbsp and left the coffee at 1/4 cup.  But this was not enough for the whole cake.  In the end, I used about 6 Tbsp and 3/4 cups of coffee (triple what the recipe called for), and while eating the cake I still felt like it could have used more of that mixture--it was still too dry and flavorless for my taste.  The coffee flavor was barely discernable, even after doubling the instant coffee that was called for.  My advice to someone making this cake would be to do two coffee layers, using a Tbsp of the coffee powder, and cater the amount of coffee/Kahlua mixture to the dryness/moistness of your cake.  If you use the Betty Crocker mix like I did, use about 8 Tbsp Kahlua and 1 C coffee, maybe more.  Soak it enough that it's super-moist, but not to the point that it falls apart.  On a positive note, I didn't change the filling or the frosting much at all, and they turned out really good.  If you like the Kahlua flavor, you should definately double that everywhere as it is so subtle in the final cake.  Next time I make Tiramisu, I am going to try to do it from scratch.

I have made this recipe several times now without any changes.It's the best Tiramisu Cake recipe I have found.It's a bit time consuming at first with many steps but once you make it a couple of times it's a piece of cake! No pun intended!! Well maybe a little pun. :) Seriously please give it a try. My family now request it for all the special occasions, birthdays,holidays and my niece even asked me to make it for her wedding cake!

I love this recipe! I did tweak it though... I brewed 4 shots of espresso, and put 2 into the cake batter along with 4T of the coffee powder. I used the other 2 to pour over the cake layers while assembling. This caused for a perfect coffee flavor! I also used 4 oz. mascarpone cheese, 4 oz. cream cheese, and a splash of heavy cream for the filling. This cake was amazing! Super light, moist, and extra delicious if you like tiramisu! Will definitely make again and again!

This is an awesome recipe and super easy! I made it the first time for my daughters 17th birthday and it was a hit. I even had people say they usually don't care for Tiramisu cake but thought this was delicious. I followed the recommendations of doing two of the flavored layers and one plain and doubled the coffee and liqueur everywhere it is called for. The second time I made the cake I was in a bit of a rush so instead of making the frosting I used cool whip and flavored it with the liqueur and it worked out awesome so light on the cake not to mention quick and easy. I am making this cake again for an office birthday next week!

WOW!! This cake is awesome. I use "David's Yellow Cake" from this site instead of cake mix. I also use 4 times the amount of coffee and liqeur in the cake (so 1 cap coffee and 1/4 cup of liqueur). I also use 2 containers of mascarpone. Moist, melts in your mouth. I have made it mutliple times and it always turns out great! People are so impressed when I make this cake.

At first I didn't like this cake. I thought it tasted to strongly of alcohol. After sitting in the refrigerator over night it turned amazing!!! My husband loved it and ate the whole thing in two days. Definitely will make this again. (Pour more coffee on the cakes)

Excellent! I used 9" pans, but I think next time I will use 8" as layers wer really thin.I followed another reviewer's advice and used 1 cup coffee and 3T Kahlua . I used instant coffee crystals that didn't dissolve entirely but it gave the center layer an interesting color and tasted fine.  I followed the recipe to make Marscapone but it made more than twice what I needed . I froze it in  three 1/2 cup mounds.  I hope it will thaw OK  to use next time. I drizzled each slice with additional Kahlua and served with a fresh strawberry garnish.

Very good.  The only thing that I will change next time is to have 2 coffee cake layers instead of just 1.  It lacked a little bit more coffee taste.  I ended up drizzling chocolate and caramel syrup on top.  It was a huge hit at a party we went too and we all decided that it would be delicious frozen as well.

This cake was amazing.  None of the people at our dinner party had ever had tiramasu but all were very impressed.  It was light and delicious. It is very important though to completely read the instructions for assembly before you start.

I have learned my lesson to read directions carefully before starting. This recipe calls for a cake mix to be made in 3 round pans, but I missed that and used just 2 pans. it would have been much better with the cake mix spread among three pans because the layers would have been thinner. With only 2 layers, it was very 'cakey.' Not like tiramisu, more like a cake with tiramisu flavors. Don't get me wrong... it was DELICIOUS!! I loved it. My husband, who loves tiramisu, thought it was too cakey. When I make it again, I will use more of the brewed coffee/kahlua mixture that gets poured into holes in the cake layers. That's because my box cakes always turn out a bit fry and if moistened more, it would taste more like tiramisu. The filling in this is sooooo good. The marscapone with the confectioners sugar gives it a really smooth authentic flavor. This was easy to make and I imagine it would be a real crowd pleaser. Love it!

It got great reviews at my dinner party.  Time consuming but good.  I did take the advice of some reviewers & added more filling and coffee & coffee liqueur.  Delicious!  I need to try the suggestion to leave cakes in pan, freeze a few minutes & pour coffee while in the pan since my cakes cracked a bit & didn't want to come out of the pan nicely.

A little time consuming, but delicious!   I substituted instant espresso for the instant coffee, as I took others advise, also used espresso instead of the brewed coffee.  If you love Tiramisu, you will love this.

Loved the idea... but didn't taste very good.  The instant coffee is most definitely not a good idea!  Did not taste like Tiramisu at all.

I should have known better to read the recent reviews and not just the most helpful. Even with all the advice, this still was a cake wreck. The layers slipped and slided, the cake was so moist it just crumbled under the weight. And the frosting was soupy, runny and turned the already sliding cake in to sludge. I am a very seasoned cake maker, and even tried to support the cake with skewers, but like I said, the cake was already so moist, it didn't even help.  I followed other's advice and double up on the coffee and flavored liquor, so the taste was very good, but I made this for my birthday party, and presentation was very important. This cake simply did not hold up. It turned out to be a waste of expensive Kahlua.

What a wonderful recipe!!!  I did this in two layers instead of three (which I later cut into four separate layers--I think three would've been easier, but when I was putting the batter into the pans, it didn't look like there would be enough for three; I was wrong), and after they were done, I froze them in their pans (covering them with foil).  After they were partially frozen, I poured the coffee Kahlua mixture over them and refroze.  I also used way more Kahlua than the recipe called for , per other reviewers suggestion.  I also didn't have any Mascarpone cheese, so I took the advice from others, using sour cream, cream cheese and heavy cream in it's place; worked beautifully!  I had every reaction from, "Tiramisu is my favorite, and this is the best!" to "I don't even like tiramisu, and I can't get enough of this!"...everyone who tried it, loved it!  I would recommend this recipe to anyone. :)

This cake was amazing!!  Didn't change a thing & it turned out perfect.  I brought it to a party and it got devoured!  I made the cake layers the day before and brushed the khalua and coffee mizture on them, let them sit overnight and then filled/frosted the cake.  It does take a good amount of time but the results are worth it!

WOW, this was great!  I did what a lot of others said:  Mascarpone substitute- 2 8oz pkgs cream cheese blended with 1/2 c heavy cream and 5 T sour cream.  Seems like a lot, but it's the right amount.  Made two of the three cake layers with the instant coffee.  Doubled coffee liqueur (Kahlua) everywhere it was called for.    We made the cake layers the day before and refrigerated them with wax paper in between overnight.  Only because we didn't have time to finish it that day.  Then we let it sit in the fridge all day the next day after we had completed it.  It was wonderful!  I would hate to see how long full blown Tiramisu takes to make because this was time consuming, BUT SO WORTH IT!

This really tastes like regular Tiramisu! I didn't have any coffee liqueur, so I just substituted a little coffee, and this still came out tasting like my husband's favorite dessert without the fussiness or difficulty of tiramisu. I've already been asked to make this again.

May I just say WOW to this wonderful recipe! My husband and I ate half of the cake this weekend by ourselves! I did take others' advice, and make two layers of the cake with the coffee powder, also mixed the 1/4 cup brewed coffee with 2 tablespoons of the liqueur instead of 1..turned out perfectly! I think I will include this in my Thanksgiving menu.

OMG!  This cake was wonderful! I doubled the amount of Kahlua everytime it was called for and I made two of the layers with the instant coffee powder.  I made a mistake because I put the cake together the day before I iced it so I didn't read the frosting instructions until the next day so I never mix in half of frosting into the filling mixture but it still turned out great!  Next time I think I'll make all of the layers with the instant coffee powder....they just tasted better than the plain one!

EXCELLENT!  I think I dirtied every bowl I had, but that isn't necessary, I usually cook and leave baking to my Mom.  Refrigerates/freezes well and I made the day before and was perfect!  Must try!

WONDERFUL - Almost as good as the Amaretto Devine cake I made last time from this site. As EVERYONE said, definitely double the dry instant coffee in ALL instances. What I did this time was make the bottom layer solid white, middle layer white & coffee, & the top layer a swirl mixture of white & coffee. It was as moist as any cake I have ever made. Each layer only took about 10 - 12 minutes to bake @ 350 - but all ovens are different. Also, the heavy cream only took about 3 minutes to whip on high speed. I used Kahlua as the coffee liquer and topped the cake with the dark cocoa, shaved dark chocolate from a store bought bar (Ghirardelli), and a handful of crushed pecans!

I made this for a Bible study this evening.  It was a hit; shall do again. Even though it begins with a cake mix, it is a labor of love that leaves lots of dishes. Praise the King, my kids do our dishes! =)

I'm commenting again because this cake deserves it. It's seriously my favorite cake ever, and everyone who tries it can't get enough. I just made it again the other day, and my boyfriend said "WOW. That settles it... I have to marry you." Other comments include "This cake is amazing," "This cake is love," and "I just finished my last piece, and now I feel like crying." You don't even have to pour the coffee/liqueur over the cake layers (I usually don't 'cause I'm lazy) and it will still taste fantastic. I double up on the frosting AND filling -- good stuff.

Hubby said it's the best tiramisu he's every had, and he has eaten his fair share of tiramisu! I followed other reviewers' suggestions and made 2 coffee cake layers and 1 white cake layer. I also doubled the Kahlua everywhere it was called for. The second time I made it, I also doubled the entire amount of filling (at hubby's request), and am liberal when pouring coffee on the cakes. I am an abysmal cake baker and my cakes always stick to the pans and look like crumbly disasters. The nice thing about this cake is that there is enough frosting and coffee that it doesn't matter, and always looks great. I use "pirouette" hazelnut cookies on the sides and choc-coated espresso beans for garnish.

Super moist and super delicious! I decided to make this cake (2nd time now) for my daughter's baby shower because I remembered how good it was the first time.  I overdid it with the coffee flavoring this time around.  So, I do highly recommend adding more, just be careful.  The first time, I doubled it everywhere it was called for except the whipped cream frosting.  Turned out fab! This time, I added even more, and I really wished I hadn’t.  With me being new to cake decorating, and it being whipped cream frosting that I would be working with, I stabilized with a little unflavored jello, and it did the trick.  Held up nicely, and turned out beautiful for this newbie cake decorator.  Will definitely continue making this yummy cake, and will keep tweaking until I get that perfect balance of coffee flavoring. A must try for any coffee lover out there, really!!

Terrific. Try substituting Irish Cream Liqueur for the coffee liqueur.  Yum... Also dissolve the one tsp coffee powder (I use instant espresso) in 1 tsp hot water before mixing it into the batter.

Awesome cake.  Followed the advice of others and increased coffee and liqueur by 4x where called for.  Didn't have coffee flavoured liqueur so I made my own...tasted amazing.  Try mixing 4 ounces rum, 1 tsp instant coffee and 1 tsp icing sugar.  Everyone loved this cake!

I made some of the adjustments recommended, but this cake did not deliver for all the time and effort involved. It lacked the classic tiramisu flavor and texture. I won't be making this one again.

One word: OUTSTANDING. I made two of these in one night, one for my friend's birthday and the other just to have. Well, needless to say, both of them disappeared within 10 minutes. This is such a good recipe for a tiramisu substitute if you don't want to spend forever making it! It tasted so incredibly amazing! Thanks for sharing!

We love this cake.  I followed the recipe to a "T" and it tasted great.  Dividing the cake into thirds is a little tricky...my layers were not quite even.  But the taste is wonderful.  I will make again, but next time I will add a little more coffee to the cake batter and more liquor as the coffe flavor was subtle.  But, since that is personal preference, it didn't affect my rating.

Awesome! Doubled the coffee/kaluha mix for the cake. Did 1.5X the kahlua on the filling and frosting, and I think anymore would've been too much for my liking. Also, did 3C of whipping cream and added 2 more TBSP of Powdered sugar to the frosting to make sure I had enough.

Awesome!! I made this one for my own birthday... As per other reviews, I used extra coffee, extra espresso powder, extra coffee liqueur and two coffee cake layers instead of one. I did make my own cake batter though using the BH&G White Cake recipe (didn't even consider the pkg mix for a second) and froze the layers before stacking (overnight, in fact). Also, from another review, used a mascarpone substitute: 1 (8oz) pkg cream cheese, 1/4 cup heavy cream, 2 TBSP sour cream. AND for the garnish: I folded up a coffee filter, cut myself a nostalgic snowflake and dusted the cocoa over the stencil... It was for MY birthday, after all! :-)

recipe was a little hard to understand.
and maybe it was me, but the cake was WAY to sweet the first day it was made- so sweet it almost tasted sour (mainly the filling had this issue)

BUT im not giving it a 1 star- because the next night it was alot better.

Pretty darn good. The one thing I didn't like was the boxed cake taste. The mascarpone filling was amazing! Mascarpone is about $3 at TJs... basically the same price as cream cheese. I did only 2 layers-  both coffee flavored. Also needed 3c whipping cream to cover. If you have problems with the whipped cream frosting, just keep going with it and it'll thicken up (go too far and you'll get butter though!). Also, try increasing the speed of your mixer. I cut pirouline cookies in half (at slightly different levels) and one tin was just the right amount to line the outside of the cake and make it look really fancy. NOT a 'quick' 'healthy' or 'cheap' cake to make, but it is incredibly delicious and sure to impress!  **********2ND REVIEW UPDATE- This time I made Heavenly Angel Food Cake from AR in place of a box cake, still added what's called for to the batter, did 2-round pans (both coffee flavored) and it came out beautifully. Trippled the liquor/coffee everywhere (Patron Cafe liquor is sooo much better than kahlua) & subbed Frangelico for 1tb of coffee liquor everywhere. It was like eating a delicious creamy cloud. 5 stars+++ made this way!

Oh wow!!  I haven't tasted the cake yet but it smells delicious and the frosting was incredible.  It was so light and creamy.  To the poster who asked why she ended up with a watery mess:  I think it's because you didn't beat it fast enough or long enough.  Make sure you use the beater shaped attachment.  I did as others suggested and doubled the kahlua and only made a two layer cake.  The recipe really is a lot easier than it looks.  Like someone else said, it really comes together fast!!

This cake was great & beautiful too! It's quite simple to make in spite of the elegance. I took others advice and doubled the coffee and kahlua and I'm glad I did! I had never made anything with whipping cream but the icing turned out fluffy and fabulous!! I refrigerated the glass bowl as someone else had mentioned and I think that helped it come out nice and fluffy!!

Love, love, love this recipe.  The only thing I change is I add about 3 times as much coffee and kahlua to the cake to make it more moist.

This is a wonderful cake recipe. I've made it several times now and, like others, must advise you to double or triple the coffee and liqueur. I even made this several moths ago, along with 4 other cakes, when my husband and I reaffirmed our wedding vows. It is a great cake and very moist and flavorful. The mascarpone substitute works very well here and gives just the right flavor to the overall presentation. I'm making it again tonight for a Labor Day pool party at my brother-in-laws home. Also, for those who are intimidated by anything other than a plain box cake... this is not labor intensive yet gives that appearance to those you serve it too. Enjoy!!

Great cake. Everyone loved it even my husband who is not crazy about tiramisu.  Baked exactly as written only using 3 pans for 18 min.  For the filling I used the mascarpone cheese recipe on this site, can't find it in my neck of the woods. The frosting I used was a whipped topping recipe with white chocolate pudding, whipped topping and the coffee liqueur. I read the reviews to use double coffee and liqueur and did not. The coffee flavor was plently strong enough for us and we love coffee.  Oh yeah , all I had was coffee crystals so i crushed them up a little for the coffee layer and the flecks of coffee looked beautiful and tasted great.

This is such a wonderful cake.  It is so moist.  I did two layers of coffee and one cake layer plain.  I also added a bit more coffee here and there and I think next time I'll even add more since it could use just a bit stronger flavor.  This will be one of my favorites from now on.

This was great! I made it one weekend when   I went to NJ for my brother and my mom. It really didn't last long.
I tripled the coffee and since I didn't have liquor I mixed coffee with vodka and it came out fine.

I made this cake for my aunt and uncle who love coffee and we all loved this cake!  I only made 2 layers and put the instant coffee powder (4 tsp) in both.  I also doubled the amount of coffee and liqueur poured over top.  So moist and delicious!

Really, really good.  I tripled the receipe.  Baked the cakes in Jelly Roll pans, then I used a round cookie cutter to make individual cakes.  I also took a clean spray bottle and put the coffee/Liqueor mixture and sprayed the coffee onto the cakes, that way everything was evenly distributed.  I also always had to substitute the marscapone cheese for cream cheese because my local store was out of marscapone.  It still tasted fab.  With all of the left overs not used, I made a small triffle.  No waste.

Made this for Mother's Day dinner.  Very, very light coffee flavor so even the kids loved it!  I would definitely make this again but add additional coffee liquor and more diluted instant coffee to the batter.  Made my own frosting - much easier and very, very tasty too.  Mix 8 oz container of whipped topping with 1/2 of a tup of 'whipped' cream cheese flavored frosting, then add a couple of TBS of coffee liquor.  Soooo easy and everyone loves it.

I made this cake for dessert last night and my family loved it! I too would have preferred it with 2 layers of coffee and 1 white, but my guests gobbled it up all the same.

The cake was a good bit of work but it was yummy. I cant give 5 stars because I had to freeze it to be able to transport it. I piled on all the frosting and it slid off the sides a bit. It was just difficult to move.

I actually had to make this cake twice.  The first time I made it I used too much water in the coffee and it turned out "rubbery."  I gave it another try and used much less water and PERFECTO! I also had to use a mascarpone substitute (found on this site) since I can't find it locally.  I took other's suggestions and used twice the amount of instant coffee (with a teeny bit of water) and kaluah. People at work raved over this and declared it their favorite thus far! UPDATE: I've made this several times now for friends.  I've made it with mascarpone and other times I've made it with a cream cheese based filling.  Personally, I like the cream cheese filling because the slight tartness of it balances the cake's sweetness.  Mascarpone itself has a very delicate flavor that can easily be overpowered.  I would describe mascarpone flavor to be like heavy whipping cream with the texture of cream cheese (but not the tartness of cream cheese).

Wow!  Not only was this easy, but simply to die for.  I made the frosting and filling the night before and the cakes the next day.  I also doubled the amount of instant coffee in the cakes and made 2 coffee layers and 1 white layer.  I used DH Moist french vanilla instead of white cake.  I brought this to a dinner party and no one believed me that I made it.  I put lady fingers around the sides and chocolate shavings on top.

Fantastic! I used Kahlua liqueur for the coffee flavored liqueur. Like many of the previous reviewers, I doubled the Kahlua everywhere in called for, except in the frosting I used 3T. I made two coffee-flavored layers for the cake, and used about 1/4 cup of the instant coffee for a more intense flavor/color contrast. The chocolate shavings were much easier to make than I thought, and looked so pretty on top of the cake I didn't even have to use the cocoa power for more garnish. I used toothpicks to make the holes when saturating the cake with the coffee/Kahlua mixture-the toothpicks worked out just fine. It took a lot longer to assemble than I anticipated though because the layers took long to cool. Overall a easy (if time consuming) recipe! Two people asked me for the recipe when I served it!

I made this for my boyfriend's family over Christmas, and it got rave reviews.  Instead of using 3 pans (I only had 2), I made one espresso cake and one plain white cake.  I cut those in two to have 4 layers.  In addition to the recipe for the filling in between, I took the advice of some reviewers and added fresh whipped cream, which I strongly suggest.  As for the icing, I used Starbucks coffee cream liqueur and it was absolutely wonderful.  I had some icing left over and have been using it in my coffee.  Thanks for the recipe!

I absolutely LOVE tiramisu, so I couldn't wait to try this recipe, and IT IS DELICIOUS!!!  YUUUUUMMMMMMMMMM!!! Lick-your-lips, melt-in-your-mouth, this-is-SOOOOOOOOO-good-I-can't-speak, OH-MY-GOD GOOD!!!!  Yes, it is THAT good!!!  I only had two cake pans, so I just put 2/3 of the batter in one (cut that up into 2 layers) and made the other 1/3 the "coffee" cake layer.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly (even though many others said they doubled all the coffee ingredients),, but I thought it was just the right amount of coffee flavor, especially since I was also feeding it to my 2 little kids, who LOVED it!!  I will definitely be making this for any/every upcoming occasion.  Thank you SO much for this recipe!!  ;-)

SO GOOD!!!  I made this cake(the 2nd time) for a christmas party and people kept coming back for more and more.  This time I made two layers of coffee cake instead of just one and used 1 and a 1/2 cups of coffee and a 1/2 cup of the coffee liqueur.  Absolutely perfect!  I liked it better when the cake was saturated with the coffee/liqueur mixture... like true tiramisu!  I would highly recommend making this cake; it's simple and impressive!

OH MY GOD.  I have so much to say about this recipe.  IT IS AMAZING.  The first time I made it, I used two white cake mixes and added the instant coffee to the other (adding a very small amount of hot water to the instant coffee is a MUST).  I ended up with 4 layers--2 white and 2 coffee.  I quadrupled the amount of coffee/kahlua mixture and ended up pouring a generous 1/4 cup of it onto each cake layer.  I doubled the amount of mascarpone filling and totally FORGOT to mix in the 1/2 cup whipping cream frosting (I didn't read the recipe thoroughly) and it was still great.  I doubled the amount of whipping cream frosting and had a huge amount leftover.  I brought this first cake to a family reunion and PEOPLE RAVED ABOUT IT.  The next day I had another get together and decided to make the cake again...this time I used one cake mix and did one white layer and two coffee layers.  I again quadrupled the coffee/kahlua mixture (but didn't use all of it).  I also again doubled the mascarpone filling--this time adding only 1/2 cup of whipping cream frosting (which was leftover from yesterday) and adding pure cream.  Kept the normal amount of frosting, and I used ALL OF IT which means that if I had taken out the 1/2 cup required for the filling, I would have totally run out.  THIS SECOND CAKE WAS TRULY AMAZING, EVEN BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE.  Oh--on top of each filling layer I sprinkled cocoa powder.

Amazing dessert! Despite rich ingredients it's fluffy and decadent! Disappeared before you could say Tiramisu! Only changes I made was to double the coffee/liquer/instant coffee anywhere it was called for and instead of baking three cakes I made two (one coffee, one plain) and then just sliced each cake in two layers (TIP: use unwaxed dental floss! EASY!!) for a four layered cake! Thank you so much for this recipe!

SERIOUSLY UNBELIEVABLE!  We doubled all coffee and coffee liquor, and also made 2 coffee layers of cake.  This was without a doubt the best dessert I have ever had.  Another reviewer used the word 'mouthgasm' - I wholeheartedly agree!!!

There is problem. Once you take this cake somewhere once, you have to make one for everywhere you go!  I no longer get to choose the cake I bring …. I am told to bring this cake. If they only knew how easy is actually was for me to make. 

If you can make one that last more than a day, the longer it gets to sit better the taste. I like to make them the night before, so the coffee really gets into the cake.  Don’t worry it will never get the strong coffee flavor. I hate coffee and love this cake!

This cake is wonderful!  I also took everyone else's advice and went with two coffee-flavored layers and one plain - I also added about 2 T. of cocoa to the batter.  However, my baking time for the cakes was about 7 minutes less than the time specified.  I'm gald I checked them or they would have been crispy!
I did end up using about 3/4 cup of coffee/Kahlua mixture to brush over the cakes, and it was wondercfully moist.  I also used the marscapone substitute listed here in another review and it was delicious!  I meant to sprinkle grated dark chocolate between the layers too, but I forgot and was pretty mad about it.  So I had to settle for just on top and it was still great! I'll try to remember next time . . .

This was a hit!  Very moist, perfect flavor...but I did take the others advise and double the coffee/coffee liquor.  Also, by accident I added 1 T. of instant coffee to the middle layer instead of 1 t...but it turned out great that way.  Will be making this again!

I made this for a second time and the one thing that I didn't care for the first time was how hard it was to get the instant coffee granules to "dissolve" in the middle layer. This time I added just a little hot water (maybe a Tablespoon or two) just to dissolve it, then added to batter. WAY better.  Also, I used a different cake mix this time and it wasn't as good....be sure to use the "pudding in the mix" cake mix...and watch the time.  Mine were done about 4-5 minutes before what it says.

YUMMY!  I love tiramisu and this cake had just the right flavor.  I took it to a dinner party and everyone loved it!  I did skip on the coffee liquer b/c I'm pregnant, and doubled or tripled the amount of other coffee ingrediants in its place.  Still great!

This is a lovely cake with beautiful presentation. Garnish with cocoa and chocolate curls on the luscious whipped frosting give for a 5-star "Wow!" factor. This is fairly easy to prepare and assemble. I have used cream cheese as a substitute for mascarpone cheese in a pinch. Everyone loves the delicate flavor of this cake.

Absolutely amazing!  I made this for my boyfriend's surprise birthday party and his family loves tiramisu.  I had sooo many compliments and requests for the recipe!  Along with the chocolate shavings and cocoa powder, I sprinkled some cinnamon on top and lined the outer edge with fresh rasberries. I also doubled the coffe and Kaluha everywhere it called. I served it with some good quality coffee ice cream.  It was delish, but next time I will double the recipe because it went WAY too fast! Thank you thank you thank you!

This was really good, but I think it needs more coffee flavor.  I think next time (and there will be a next time!), I will use strong coffee in place of water in the cake mix and will also brush on more coffee (I brushed - didn't pour).  The cake could definitely take a little more without getting soggy.  I only made two layers (both with coffee granules mixed in) and it turned out great.  I covered the top and sides of the cake with grated dark chocolate and a packet of mocha cappuccino hot chocolate mix. My filling wouldn't set up, so I sprinkled on a bit of instant vanilla pudding powder and that worked well.   Highly recommend.  Everyone loved it!

This cake is just Wonderful, I had made it for my daughters Anissa's  12th birthday, she loves Tiramisu, and it was a hit. I used Kaluha, and added a wee bit more than called for in each step. If you want a more elegant cake for any occasion this is the ONE...

I don't think this cake is a real "time saver" - takes just as much or more time than an original tiramisu recipe.   Ladyfingers are much better to use.

I made this cake for Mother's Day, and everybody raved about it!  They said that it was the best dessert that I've made so far, and I've made quite a few desserts.  I didn't have any coffee liqueur, so I used Bailey's instead, and I used instant cappuccino powder instead of the coffee granules.  It turned out great!

I made this cake for a local holiday party and was awarded a prize for "best presentation." Not only does this cake look impressive (I topped it with raspberries in addition to the chocolate curls) it tastes great too. Not too sweet, with a definite tiramisu flavor. It took longer to make than I had anticipated, but the results were pretty impressive.

Delicious, Delicious, Delicious!!! My mother and my husband loved it. Had to give my mom the recipe. I could probably finish off the entire cake by myself in a day or two.  Did not want to finish my piece...savored every morsel. I will use this again and again and again.

Tastes just like tiramisu. I used my own yellow cake recipe and kahlua for the liqueur. A little sweet but overall a good cake.

I love this recipe and have made it several times. I just subbed Crème Fraîche for the marscapone. It was delicious. I love being creative with variations of chocolate topping; cocoa powder, chocolate shavings or even a ganache. Everyone loves it!

I won first place in my company's bake-off with this cake against some pretty stiff competition -- and it was the first time I'd done anything like this. Never made a layer cake before. But it was surprisingly easy. Some people talked about mascarpone being really expensive, but I found it at my local grocery store for $5.99. Didn't seem too bad (considering the substitute ingredients I read about would probably cost close to that). I followed the advice of others and made two layers with the instant coffee and one layer of plain cake. Worked great! Also, I've made this cake twice, and the second time I made the cake layers in advance, wrapped them in plastic wrap, and kept them in the fridge over night. Then I finished the rest of the cake the next day. Tasted just as great as the first time I made it all in one day. I had never made chocolate curls before, but it was really easy with a simple chocolate bar and vegetable peeler. Also, I used a basic mesh strainer for a fine cocoa powder on the top. Looked just like the photos! The video really helped, too. I'd watch that first (and again while cooking).

The recipe was pretty straightforward and easy. It was the first cake i had ever made partially from scratch (except just plain box mixed cake) and it was easy to make and turned out beautifully and delicious. For those who find the cake not to have a deep coffee flavorig i advice you to use a name brand coffee liqeuer for it really gives it a better taste. Also, a stronger coffee brew helps, if you dont have a very good coffee machine your best investment woud be to get brew from your local starbucks or coffee shop. Other than that you can always strenghthen the flavor by using instant powder to the batter of all the layers of the cake.
I had made it for my mom's birthday and she loved it! it looked like i had bought it! a had set aside a small portion of the icing and wrote happy birthday on it too! and for the 98% of the liqeuer that left over they can bet i will definatley make it again.
*** for all those who gave a single star because their icing and filliing turned too watery..  that is not the recipies fault.. u may have simply over or undermixed it.

I made this for my mother's birthday cake, and she said it was amazing! Everyone loved it and it was a very simple recipe for something that looked and tasted quite sophistocated. I did add more coffee everything to the cake to enhance the flavour, but would be even more bold another time. I found that the cake can handle a lot more of the soaking liquid, I double it and might even go as far as 3/4 cup in the future. Overall, just really impressed with the flavour and ease of this recipe!

This cake received rave reviews from my family on Easter Sunday.  I made primarily for my tiramisu loving Mom and she just went on and on about it.  I made the recipe as written but did add a cake extender recipe because I wanted thicker layers.  This was a surprisingly light cake and the whipped cream frosting held up just great.  I made the cake a day ahead which I thought helped the flavor. It also traveled well as it is a 40 minute trip to my Mom's house.  The cake didn't shift at all.

PERFECTO!!!  I made this cake for my aunts birthday party and EVERYONE loved it, After reading the reviews I did double the espresso powder, coffee, and the liqueur for the cake. Because my family isn't fond of a strong liqueur taste I followed the filling and the frosting directions as written. I was traveling with the cake for about 30 minutes I was afraid that the cake would shift in transit but I was wrong! It was not only the prettiest cake that I made ( I stenciled the cocoa powder on the top using a paper lace doily as another reviewer suggested) but it was the perfect finish to an Italian meal. Nice and light with awesome flavor. Thanks to this cake I have become the requested baker for our future celebrations! Thank you for the recipe and all of the helpful reviews :-)

Like many others, I doubled the kahlua and used two coffee layers and one white layer. I also sprinkled some mini chocolate chips on top of the cream between the layers. I would be curious to see how this turns out using chocolate cake - you would lose the visual effect of the different colored layers, but I bet the mocha flavor would be pretty tasty for us chocoholics. I also like the idea another reviewer had to use strawberries between the layers and chambord instead of kahlua, or maybe I would use Amaretto. Lots of possibilities. Got my mascarpone at BJs -

Really amazing cake!  Made it for my weekly lunch with my mother and her sisters.   Thumbs up all around! Next time, I will do the following:  double the amount of coffee going into the poked holes; make 2 coffee layers and 1 white layer; use a doily to make a more attractive cocoa powder design on top of the cake; make the cake the day before serving to let it "sit" AND if I am really ambitious, will make the Heavenly White Cake as another reviewer did.  I am not a big fan of cakes from a box though nobody could tell I had help from Mr. Duncan Hines!  Oh, it would look fabulous with some juicy red strawberries as decoration!

Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe (and for all your ratings too).  I did not get the cake mix so bought a sponge cake from the shop and cut into three layers.  My first Coffee Liqueur tiramisu was just beautiful(I used 5T of liqueur though!) and impressive. Will make it again and again and again!

We decided to go with an Italian themed Christmas dinner this year, so my husband made homemade lasagna and I went with this cake. It is absolutely wonderful. Easy to prepare and assemble. Everyone commented on how moist it was and that it was just the right amount of sweet without being to sweet.  I also made 2 of the layers with coffee and doubled the Kahlua anywhere coffee liqueur was called for. I will definitely be making this cake again. My mom has already called for an Italian Easter dinner.

The ONLY reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because I did not follow it as written. I did go with a lot of the other use suggestions and boy am I glad that I did! And you will too!!! First of all...make TWO coffee flavored cake layers, not one. And use 2 teaspoons of instant coffee or more in each layer. Use very strong coffee for the liquid you brush on. Use about 1.5 tablespoons of coffee liquor and about 3/4 cup strong coffee. I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of instant coffee powder to the marscapone filling. Next time, I would add chopped up chocolate pieces into the filling. But this recipe was AMAZING!!! I made it for Halloween and people are still talking about how good it was!!! This is definitely a keeper recipe.

This recipe is amazing!  Instead of using the box cake, I used "Clara's White German Chocolate Cake" as a base, still adding the coffee and liqueur.

This cake is soooo delicious! Everyone at my dinner party loved this. I pretty much followed the recipe almost to the T. I used Kahlua Hazelnut liqueur, and brewed some hazelnut coffee to go with it. I did not quite drench my cake layers with the coffee/liqueur mixture. Instead, I lightly brushed the mixture on. It worked out just fine. You can hardly feel the affects of the liqueur. Some of my friends were worried they would get drunk off the cake (since they have very low tolerance to alcohol) but they ate it just fine and didn't get buzzed! If you're looking for more of a buzz with this cake, then I suggest doubling the amounts of liqueur in this recipe, or maybe use rum instead.

I used the Heavenly White Cake recipe from this site and added 2 T espresso powder to the batter. I also dusted the cakes with cocoa before they baked, then followed the recipe for the filling and icing on this site. I added amaretto liquor in the filling. The cake is moist, the filling and icing luscious! My husband, a tiramisu fan, loved it, although he did comment that the cake should have been soaked in coffee (there wasn't any made when I did the cake). Other than that, it was delicious!

I doubled the filling. I also baked 2 cakes. One with double the instant coffee. I also doubled the coffee/kahulua mixture and used espresso instead of coffee. Once the cakes cooled I cut them in half so it was a four layer cake. DELICIOUS!!!

This cake was too dry and the mascarpone flavor did not really come out. I would definitely add more coffee to the cake to moisten it up. Probably at least twice as much. I use 3 times that much on a similar recipe (not coffee, another liquid) and it is very moist. My family said it was a good cake but did not taste like Tiramisu, which I make homemade a lot and we love. I will probably either modify it or find another recipe. Good idea though!

This was awesome!  I think that the suggestions for mascarpone substitutions are right on.  Do be careful in following some of the other suggestions, though, as the first time I made this cake it was so soggy it fell apart.  I doubled the liquer and coffee that I poured over the cake per several reviews and it was too much.  Maybe use 2 TB coffee and 2 TB liquer?  The adults loved the taste of the Kahlua although it was still very subtle so I think you definitely do want to double that.  I also made 2 coffee layers and 1 plain and would do that again.  I bought 3 oz of dark chocolate and shaved 1/3 to top the cake with and then kept the remaining 2/3 and shaved some extra over every slice.  Everyone loved this cake!

YUM! This was so good. I did make some changes. 

First of all, make sure you use coffee powder, not instant coffee. Some reviewer said that their instant coffee did not desolve. That is because the recipe calls for coffee powder. 

As the other reviewers did, I doubled the coffee powder, kahlua, and coffee whereever it called for those ingredients. I made 3 layers of cake. One plain and 2 coffee flavored ones. I also used cream cheese for the filling.  

The frosting is basically homemade whipping cream with an added kick. It helps to have a cold beaters and cold bowl to beat it in.

This recipe was really good and I will make it again. I made it the day before so the flavors would intesify.

The flavors were excellent, but the cake part with the coffee mix in didn't want to come out of the pan without falling apart.  I looked horrible, but the taste excellent.

This was very good, and it was quite impressive in appearance.  The texture was very light, perfect for spring or summer entertaining.  My only changes were to use espresso powder instead of instant coffee, and to add about a tablespoon of espresso powder to the filling mix.  I took this to a potluck and everyone loved it.  Thanks for the idea!

OMG this is the best cake ever! Double where ever it says to add coffee though. even on the kahlua. I used espresso instead of brewed coffee also. And make it the night before so it can set up.

I followed the recipe almost to the T, except I increase the instant espresso powder to 2 tablespoons for 2 dark layers (and one white) and double coffee flavored liquer through out (Hazelnut Bailey). Mascarpone cheese tastes delicate and beautiful while cream cheese has a subtle sour flavor so mascarpone wins in this recipe. The double thick cream whipped up like a dream for frosting and so easy to spread. The amounts of filling and frosting are perfect for a 9-inch cake.

I made this for my husband's Bday and he loved it. I doubled the coffee and liquer as other commenters said to and made 2 of the flavored layers, but I used instant coffee granules, which didn't blend into the batter very well at all, I think using instant coffee powder would have been better, also, I got a little over zealous with pouring the liquid over the cake layers and it lead to a kindof soggy cake, oops! I also made my own chocolate for shaving as someone else had said, by melting chocolate chips with some coconut oil and letting it cool, that was delicious too. So it seems like this recipe needs a lot of alterations, but it made for a pretty awesome cake

I make this cake for a house party and it followed the directions to a tee.  No where in the recipe did it say to chill the beaters before whipping the cream mixture.  Might think about adding that!  It sure would help.

Made this for daughter's birthday.  Used some hints from other reviewers- added instant coffee to strong coffee to make extra strong and used as substitute for water in cake mix.  Used extra Kaluah when drizzling on layers, also drizzled 1 TBS rum on middle layer along with Kaluah mixture.  Delicious cake, family and guests loved it!  Personally I prefer traditional tiramisu, but the cake was beautiful and yummy!

This cake was fabulous. I made it to take to my office and several people thought it was store bought! I had a co-worker tell me that he's had many versions of tiramisu in lots of upscale restaurants and this was by far the best he ever had! I added a little more coffee as other reviewers mentioned, and followed the advice of one that suggested adding a couple tablespoons of vanilla pudding mix to the frosting to help give it some staying power. It turns out it probably wasnt necessary because the cake was gone within a half hour of being served!

So good!  The instructions seemed complicated at first, but weren't really.  I just did 2 layers and increased the amt of Kahlua throughout.  I did have a problem with the marscapone filling.  It oozed out all over.  It was discernible in taste, but not in appearance.

This was really good, my only problem was not getting the icing to set up.  It never did solidify for me so I had to break down and use store bought icing.  The flavors of the cake were very good though.

I spent alot of time preparing this but did not think it was worth the prep...it was very dry and I actually had to make more filling as the first batch was soaked up on the first layer of cake...the best part of the cake was the kahlua whipped cream...if it werent for that this cake would have been a waste of time and money

This cake is very good! The whipped cream frosting has such a fresh taste and I love the mascarpone filling. If you are looking for a stronger coffee taste, you may want to use espresso. I did not find the coffee taste to be very strong at all. This is a great recipe that you can tailor to your taste.

I was hesitant to make this because I would have rather made my cake from scratch (you still can) but I was in a pinch for a quick cake. WOW! This cake was so good I had 3 guests ask me to make it for Birthday parties. A keeper just the way it is. Thank you.

Oh My Gosh...this was a huge hit. People wanted to know what bakery I got the cake from and it was so easy to make. I did go a little more on the coffee and Kahlua, but other than that kept it just as written.

Very good. I did add more liquid coffee and instant coffee than the recipe called for and it was still not very overly strong tasting.

Simply put, this was incredible.

It took me two tries to get it right- the first attempt at making two layers of cake crumbled into a cakey diasater, but it was worth the extra effort!  I made it for a friend's birthday and she was delighted.

I did double the coffee and kahlua, and the flavor was still quite subtle.  Delicious!

Wow ~ I hate tiramisu but I absolutely loved this! I don't care for the strong coffee liquor tastes so I only poured the coffee mixture on the middle layer that already had the instant coffee. The two plain layers of white cake were a fantastic compliment. I highly recommend anyone baking this cake to completely wow his or her guests. :) yum.

This was the first time I made any variation or Tiramisu. Unfortunately this cake was a letdown for me. The recipe seems OK not great as most persons said. The frosting DEFINITELY needed more sugar. I added about a tbsp and a half more and it was still not sweet enough. The directions with regards to the amount of coffee pour onto finished cakes was lacking. I had no idea how much coffee i should have mixed with the coffee liqueur that should be poured over the cakes. So i had to wing it. I put too little and my efforts to salvage the cake proved futile as it was just dry in some parts but wet in some parts and not in a pleasant way. If you decide to do this recipe follow the suggestions that the other users gave. I hope to make it again using all the suggestions previous reviewers gave like stacking the cakes upside-down so that they can soak up the coffee liquid better and using more coffee liqueur in the cake generally.

This is a grea recipes. I tried this 2 years ago for my first real cake- not include cupcakes. It's very easy and very good. My husbands and all my friends love it. I used Starbuck coffee liqueur on mine and it's perfect!! I did both 2 layers and 3 layers and ingredients work just fine.

I've made this twice. Once at sea level where it came together perfectly and easily and looked and served great. Everyone was impressed. The 2nd time I tried it at an altitude of 10000ft. No cake mixes here so I tried a high altitude white cake recipe and that worked fine. Not perfectly flat layers but close enough. THe marscaone mixture tirned to liquird as soon as I mized it though, and it realy didn't work for filling. I had to add cream cheese to bulk it up. Less flavor. Also, the icing, when I added the mascarpone mixture, totally fell flat so I had to start over and add very little of the cheese to the whipped cream. It worked okay, the cake fell apart when served but high altitude complicates things so I don't blame the recipe. I would just warn be careful what mascarpone you buy--not all will stay solid enough to fill a cake.

Turned out really really good!  The frosting was a little hard to get thick enough, but maybe I should've let the egg whites get to room temp first.  Otherwise, my husband loved it!

I've rated this before and raved about it then. I'm back to offer a new twist (if it hasn't been offered already).  This recipe in the form of cupcakes is AWESOME. I made them, jumbo-sized, and took them to work one day...everyone loved them! Instead of dividing the batter into thirds, I divided it in half. I'm not sure how much instant coffee I used, but it was at least 2-3 tablespoons. I filled foil cups, alternating between the two flavors of batter, baked as instructed and then allowed them to cool.  I used a serrated knife to cut a cone shape out of the top of my cupcake, poured in a bit of coffee, added a spoonful of filling, and then re-placed the cone and topped them each with the whipped topping. Oh, and the final touch? Mini chocolate chips!

What a disappointment!  I followed the directions as written & my cake layers were sliding around & the top layer ended up splitting.  I was so upset because I was making this cake for my best friend for her 30th birthday.  It took me so long to make & now it's junk!  I gave it 2 stars because the actual cakes themselves turned out good, but I didn't care for the filling & frosting.  Definitely not stable enough to hold 3 layers together!  My suggestion, keep looking for a better tiramisu cake & make sure the "frosting or filling" is more than just whipped cream if you don't want your cake falling apart.

This cake was a wonderful addition to a Dinner for 6 Group we attended this weekend. We had Italian food, and the cake was a great finish. It was well worth the effort to make. Everyone loved it! I used espresso powder and cocoa as recommended online for a coffee liqueur substitute. Be sure you refrigerate this cake as directed, with all the creamy elements. Happy cooking!

Light, airy, flavorful, creamy delicious - what's not to like about this cake?!?!  It's quick and easy to make (although some ingredients are a bit pricey), and TOTALLY worth the effort.  Made this with my 13-year-old nephew and had a blast!  Best part - we got to eat the finished product!  Super DELISH!

Fantastic! Followed the recipe exactly. I like to do that the first time, then tweak if necessary. Light, yet full of flavor!

Wow!!! I messed this recipe up and didn't put the coffee in the middle and didn't realize it until it was too late and it still turned out awesome!!! Everyone loved it.  I added a little truffle in the center for decoration.  It looked like a professional baker made it and it tasted even better!

if you like tiramisu, then i think you will love this. its extremely easy to make and it tastes just like some ive had in restaurants.  i followed the recipe 100% and really wouldnt change a thing.  its prob not the kind of thing you make alllll the time, but perfect at holiday time or parties too.  whoever said their frosting was sour probably had bad cream im guessing!

Awesome cake... the crowd loved it. I made extra filling. The cake traveled well (used skewers)  and the frosting lasted too. I will make this again in the future.  YUM YUM :)

Next time I make this, I might use 2 boxes of mix to make 3 thick layers as mine turned out really thin.  Or I'd leave the 3 thin layers in the oven for 1/2 the recommended time on the box as they were fairly dry.  I also agree with all of the suggestions about increasing the liquid; I quadrupled it, and still wish I'd had more.  And the "do it yourself" mascarpone?  Wonderful!  Tasted fantastic and was SO inexpensive.  This cake is DEFINITELY staying in my repertoire!

This cake is absolutely fabulous!!  I made it for a birthday and got "this is the best cake I have ever had" statements.  The reviews were helpful; I also left out the coffee flavored liqueur and did 2 layers coffee and the 3rd layer regular.  I also added a little vanilla to the coffee I poured over my layers, as well as the frosting!  Don't be shy with the coffee poured over, the more the better (very similar consistency and moistness of rum cake).

Has become a favorite with my friends and family. I brought it to christmas last year and everyone freaked. I've made it with cream cheese because i couldn't find any marscapone. It wasn't awful but I much prefer marscapone.

excellent cake but it needs to be refridgerated overnight to "set".  made it for my sisters birthday.  my mom hates cake and she scarfed down an entire piece!  everyone loved it!  i bought two box cakes and made @ coffee layers and doubled the kahlua throughout the recipe and used at least 3 times the coffee.

I agree with SSDolecki and Monica reviews:  the filling was WAY too runny (cake layers kept sliding around, etc.).  The 2 stars are for the yummy taste only.  I will definitely not make this again (and I am known as a good baker).  Mascarpone is Very expensive; I would advise using cream cheese instead for anyone trying this recipe.

I wish I had read the reviews to increase the amount of coffee in the recipe or to add the instant coffee to more than one layer. The white cake just seemed out of place and too dry in this recipe. If I make this recipe again, I'll definitely increase the amount of coffee to make the cake more moist and so it has more flavor. We liked the part that had coffee drizzled on it; there just wasn't enough of it.

Yummy!  Used rum instead of kahlua, and mixed some instant coffee into it to make my own coffee liqueur.  Maybe next time use white cake from scratch instead of boxed--good flavor, just a really fluffy texture.

This was my first tiramisu attempt, and I'm sticking with this recipe! SO easy to put together.  Like other reviews, I added much more instant coffee to the batter (I did it to taste), and doubled the coffee/kahlua mix.  MMmM!

I added instant coffe to a little water and added to the entire batter for only 2 layers and followed the rest of the directions in the recipe for a 60th b-day celebration and it was a big hit.  Suprisingly with the cream it held very well - 3 days - in the fridge to enjoy the left overs.

Brought this to an Italian Night dinner party, and it received RAVE reviews. I made it exactly as stated except added a bit more coffee and coffee liquer. It was SO moist without being soggy. Just perfect! Not a slice was left. I was a bit worried initially when baking the cake because when splitting one box of cake mix among 3 pans, each layer seemed so thin and dry. But it turned out perfect! The coffee really made it moist and it turned out perfect!

5 stars plus! This recipe is delicious - not overly rich or sweet. I had 2 guests for a total of 5 for dinner, so I made individual trifles. Bake two 9 inch cakes, 1 with coffee, 1 without, and freeze. Increase the filling by 50% - 12 oz cheese (substitute worked great), ¾ C sugar, 3 T liqueur. 24 hours ahead, thaw the cakes slightly, chop into cubes so they resemble small croutons, spread cake pieces on two cookie sheets and drizzle with coffee mixture. Make a bit more frosting using 2½ cups of heavy cream, 1/3 cup conf. sugar and 3 T of liqueur. Fold ¾ cup of the frosting into the filling. Layer as follows, pressing cake down lightly: white cake pieces, filling, dark cake pieces, filling, white cake pieces, frosting. The frosting should fill them to the top. Smooth flat. Alternate which type of cake you start with.  Sprinkle with cocoa powder and chocolate shavings, refrigerate. I put the 5 for dinner in martini glasses. They looked great. The rest went into plastic 9 oz cocktail cups, for a total of 13. I was able to share with the neighbors, impress my dinner guests and easily send them home with 2nds. Awesome recipe.

Fantastic recipe! Everytime I make this I get rave reviews. People are always asking me to make it. Of course, mine never looks as pretty as the profile picture but it comes out just like me...kind of rough lookin on the outside, yummy on the inside!

This is the best tiramisu cake that I have ever had. I made this for my family and it was gone in a day ! The only change that I made was using cream cheese since my area grocery stores do not carry mascapone cheese, and I used Hazelnut coffee since that is all that I had on hand.      I made this cake several weeks ago, and I plan to make it again this weekend as everyone wants another one, it was that good !!

This recipe as written is good.  After making the recipe once I felt that the Kahlua should be doubled everywhere as the others have stated.  Using cream cheese, albeit delicious, is a disservice to this dessert. The cake is slightly expensive and time consuming to prepare, but it's well worth the effort.  I've also made it as a dessert in individual serving bowls with an almond pound cake as the base and used toasted sliced almonds as garnish.  I've gotten rave reviews each time and I'm asked to bring this dessert to every event.  Chocolate curls make for a beautiful finish and are worth the effort.  I used dark chocolate chips and just melted them over a double boiler and poured into a small rectangular plastic container to harden into a block.  Please note: If you do not like coffee, you WILL NOT like this cake.  Please spare yourself the disappointment and others the loads of poor reviews because you don't like coffee.

Delicious and impressive!!  I would recommend using 8" cake pans to make a higher cake, and I used 2 tsp instant espresso powder.  Everyone loved it!!

I decided to make Teramisu for our Easter dinner - this recipe looked yummy and simple. Seldom do I have goof-ups when it comes to baking - but I blew it this time!! For the filling instead of the mascarpone cheese I decided to cut costs and use the cream cheese - sour cream & "HEAVY WHIPPING CREAM" substitution.  Couldn't figure why my layers of cake kept swimming off the plate and it was so sloppy!!?  It should have been "HEAVY  WHIPPING CREAM" - WHIPPED!! I salvaged the cake layers - trimmed them to fit a 8" triffle bowl - scraped off the filling and made a Tiramisu Triffle. Just one of the little problems of changing a recipe that really doesn't need change!  Thank you God for wisdom (better late than never) & a little creativity!!

MmMmMm, this is one of my fav cakes. Even my hubby, who isn't a fan of cake, likes it. To simplify things, I create only two layers with one batter. When following the cake mix directions, I substitute coffee for water, apple sauce for oil/butter and use egg beaters... then after baking, I use a baster (the paint brush type) to brush the coffee/liqueur mixture over both layers. Splenda (the original powdery kind) replaces confectioners' sugar in the filling and frosting. This is the perfect dessert after an Italian dinner!

OMG!! Heavenly!! Great flavors AND looks pretty! Didn't change a thing; baked cake in the morning; frosted in the afternoon; and ate it about 6:30 in the evening. Will definitely make over and over and over ...

This was ok.  Not spectacular, but good.  The frosting was the best part.  I might try again and tweak it.  Thanks for the recipe Bettina!

Very tasty however it was also very labor intensive and definitely needed the 2x on coffee and liqueur as suggested.  It is worth making again, and hopefully the second time around won't take as long.  I used 2 cake pans as that's all I own and used floss to easily split each cake into two thin layers (also works great for cutting cheesecake).  I didn't have enough of the cheese filling to top each layer and I had more than enough frosting for the cake topping so next time I may fold frosting into the filling rather than the other way around.  I used espresso in place of coffee and it had a nice rich flavor. As suggested by others I used DH extra moist white cake (w/ egg whites) and it came out light and wonderful for this recipe.  It's not 'tiramisu' in the traditional sense but it tastes fantastic.  I wasn't counting on how long it would take to make but I do think letting it set for 5 hours before eating was a good idea.  The flavors blended nicely.  I topped with a ring of raspberries for presentation.  4 stars instead of 5 for time of preparation and need to read the reviews to know to double ingredients.

This is my first time leaving a review because didn't have one that stand out like this one before.  I don't think I can live without this cake.  I'm not a cake person usually, but this one is to die for.  I made a bunch of these and gave to friends for Chrsitmas and what a hit that was.  Labor? what labor? It's all worth the effort.  Thank you so much for sharing such a wonderful cake. Love it, love it!!!

This was delicious!  Based on other reviews, I made 2 of the layers with the espresso powder, and doubled the coffee/kahlua mixture to pour over the cakes.  I accidentally used three 8 inch pans instead of 9 in pans, so the cake was a bit taller.  Next time I think I will just use two 8 inch pans, make one with the espresso powder, then split them so there are 4 layers.  Might need to increase the filling layer but that's OK since it was delicious!  Thanks so much for sharing!

This is the best! Trust yourself and take the plunge and make it! Husband claims its better than normal tiramisu (or I just made it that good) :)  *double the kahlua (everywhere)  *double the coffee   *personally I think it called for too much frosting could maybe even half the cream  *used actual marscapone and it turned out great  Did 3 layers...2 with instant coffee and one plain  LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS CAKE!!!! Already thinking when I should make it again :)

This cake was a huge hit! I took some reviewers' suggestions - 2 flavored layers, 1 plain layer; more coffee/ kahlua to soak into each layer; and substituted 2 packages of cream cheese, 5 Tb sour cream, and 1/2 c. heavy cream for the marscapone, which my grocery store didn't carry. This recipe was time consuming, but it definitely got results! Even my brother, who doesn't like sweets much, was impressed. I'll definitely make it again.

This cake was pretty good...not as good as real tiramisu, but I wasn't going through all that for a work luncheon. To be honest this cake was sort of labor intensive too...especially because a lot of people won't touch anything with coffee flavor, but I did have one request for the recipe and I enjoyed it.

OMG!  This is wonderful.  I did take other reviewers suggestions.   I did add 4 teaspoons of the instant coffee to the cake and made two coffee layers.  My big change to the reicpe is I used Baileys coffee flavored Irish cream instead of the liquor.   I also doubled the Irish Cream in the cake mix 2 TBS.  Filling: I added 3TBS Irish Cream.    Frosting: I added 4TBS Irish Cream. I do agree with the others about putting the cake in the frig over night it does set the cake frosting perfectly.

I lose some points for presentation myself, b/c I only have two 9" pans, making this only a dual layer cake.  If anyone is interested, the batter makes just under 4 cups, which may help you when trying to divide it evenly into the pans.  Followed the ingredients to a tee, I love classic tiramisu, and this is a great variation!

I made this exactly as written and This was super easy to make. The second time I made it I tried an easier route and made this in two layers instead of three.  I simply poured half the batter into one cake pan, then added the coffee powder into the second.  It still worked out great and since it was easier, I will do this next time as well.   Even people who were hesitant to try this because they didnt like coffee recipes said they loved it!  My husband ate like half the cake the first day :D

This is the best cake I've made in my amateur baking career thus far.  I doubled everything, but redoubled the coffee liquer so it was more prominent.  This was an attractive cake, pretty easy to make just lots of steps.  I put half the sugar in the filling so the cheese could come through more.  Also recommend sifting the powdered sugar for the frosting.  Piped some remaining frosting to make it look nicer.  Next time, I will spread with white frosting, then do food coloring or fold in melted chocolate and pipe for more color.

Fantastic cake! I made 2 layers as I only have 2 pans. I used cream cheese instead of marscapone because the store didn't have it. I doubled the coffee in all the parts as we love coffee!
I have also made this as a trifle after I dropped one of the layers, my son actually preferred it that way and asks for it often!

This is a delicious cake and nice alternative to the traditional tiramisu. I made it for my husband for his birthday and brought the rest of it to work. All who tried it loved it and I had requests for the recipe. I will definitely make it again.

I made this a day ahead as suggested by other reviewers...we didn't eat it until 8:oo the next evening and it was a wilted, soggy mess.  The flavor was OK, but so many people were put off by the appearance/coffee flavor, only half was eaten.

This was Delish! OMG! Delish, Can I say that again? Delish! I didn't have a hand mixer but for the frosting so I did it by hand (took about 10 minutes of not stop whipping) so I put a large bowl over a smaller bowl filled with ice water to keep it as cold as possible (for the frosting) and it turned out perfect. I also accidentally added whole eggs to the cake mix (oops) Even with my mistakes this turned out Delish! (LOL)P.S. I made this EXACTLY as written with no extra anything! EDIT: Making this once again! I know everyone will love it, making it for my hubbys company party. Anyhow, the more I make it - the easier it seems to get (just a thought for newbie bakers like me).

Really nice dessert to serve to company or for special occasions. I omitted pouring the coffee into the cake. Not too heavy or sweet.

I made this to celebrate my boyfriends new job and he LOVED it!!!! So did the rest of my family.  It's not the traditional heavy coffee flavor, but it's delicious!! I'm not the best cook in the world, but this is easy enough for me.

Fantastic cake, "like a high-end restaurant" according to my son-in-law!  I read the comments and looked at the photos.   I made it with two coffee layers and one white layer and decorated it with the Pepperridge Farms Pirouette since it was for my daughter's birthday.  I used two cake mixes so it would be taller for three layers and made cupcakes for the small children. Also I used a Martha Stewart trick of inserting plastic straws to support the layers and making it easier to transport.  You can be as creative as you want with the decorations and the taste is spectacular!

Excellent.  My first shot at something this complicated, but was able to do it pretty much with ease.  The only thing that was tough for me as a beginning baker was trying to get the cream to whip correctly (I don't think I whipped it long enough) and then get it on the cake effectively.  I'll definitely try this again; but even with my own blunders it was still delicious!

I made this cake last summer for a family reunion, it was the first dessert gone! Everyone raved about it and it's now expected at every family get together. I did increase the amount of instant coffee and dissolved it in 2tbsp hot water before adding it to the cake mix. I usually make two of the layers coffee and one plain. Once I even used my checkerboard cake pan with it. Always a big hit! LOVE IT!

This was beautiful and delicious!  Made mother's day quite special.  I did use coffee syrup instead of kalua and it turned out perfect.

This was a HUGE hit!!!  I took a reviewer's suggestion to double all the coffee and coffee liquer--DEFINITELY a must!  I also made two coffee layers and one white instead of the reverse.  This will definitely remain a go-to favorite!!!

Yay! Finally tried this and loved it... I ended up with only two layers, Just didn't seem like enough batter for three pans.  The cake itself wasn't as pretty as the one in the picture...but it sure was yummy!  *I doubled the liquor and coffee everywhere. *Froze the mixing bowl and whisk and didn't beat the frosting too long (turned out awesome). *Used the mascarpone substitute. *I will def make again and do three layers.

This was absolutely AWESOME!!!!! I fixed this for "Italian Night" with a bunch of friends and it was definetly a hit. I followed the recipe almost to the letter except I did make two coffee layers and I accidently added coffee powder to the mixture to pour over the cakes- no complaints about that though. I also omitted the cocoa powder and lined the edge with dark chocolate covered expresso beans and chocolate curls in the middle. This recipe is a keeper for sure!

Delicious and beautiful.  I thought it was too short with just one box of cake mix, so I made another, used 2/3 of THAT batter, for a total of 5 layers.  Doubled the Kahlua as others suggested.  Phenomenal.

WOW!  This was excellent!  Not overly strong...just right!  I also flavored two of the cake layers and doubled the liqueur everywhere! I would have taken a picture to post, however I am NOT a cake decorator!  The cake tasted SOOOOO much better than it looked. LOL!!

Very good. Impressive without too much work. The coffee will run off the top of the cake layers because of the smooth finish, so trim to level or turn on top. I also put coffee in two layers and increased coffee strength. My mom loves it and my two picky kids love it.

Made this for a party and everyone raved! I followed a few suggestions others have mentioned:  1. I made 2 coffee flavored cake layers and one white layer. 2. I doubled the amount of coffee added to the batter and the amount of Kalua added to the filling. 3. I made the cake layers the night before, refrigerated them overnight and then assembled the next morning to help keep the cake from falling apart during assembly. 4. My cake didn't look as even as I wanted it to be, so I drizzled ladyfingers with the coffee mixture and lined the cake with the coffee drizzled cookies.  It looked beautiful and tasted great. 5. I added some shaved chocolate in between the cake layers to make the cake a little more "chocolatey" If I were to do it again (and I'm sure I will), I would do it exactly the same - it turned out great!!

I have made this cake several times now and I always get good feedback.  My husband LOVES it!  I have rushed through the recipe and "messed" up, but the results were still delicious.  My advice is to read each step carefully as you go.  Don't wing it from memory.

A great recipe that presents itself very well. i followed others' advice and doubled the coffee and kahlua. My only problem was that my filling was way too runny -- i'm not quite sure what I did incorrectly. It still tasted good, but a lot of the filling oozed out of the layers.

Very good I doubled Kahlua where called for also I wish I would have added more of the coffee/Kahlua mixture to the layers..I was afraid they were going to be soggy so i held back but needed more. Only negative I found was not enough chocolate flavor for my taste would add a chocolate layer in the middle of cake next time. Hint: any left over frosting ( whipped cream  and Kahlua ) tasted fantastic served on top of Kahlua and hot coffee served to guests

Unusual and delicious - a presentation cake.  I'm not a super accomplished baker and I was able to pull it off exactly as written.  Only having two round pans, I made one layer of plain white cake using 1/3 of the batter, which I put in the middle of the baked cake.  To make up the bottom and top layers, I used 2/3 of the batter with the coffee crystals and baked this layer a few minutes longer, then cut it horizontally into two layers after it had cooled.  When finished, my cake was striped with the white layer in the middle.  It looked VERY pretty!  I used Starbucks coffee liqueur and mascarapone cheese which made the filling TO DIE FOR!  I decorated the top with grated semi-sweet chocolate, then made flowers with coffee beans as the center and small mint leaves as the petals.  This cake really needs to rest a day before cutting for the flavors to blend and ripen.  I will make this cake again but next time I will use more brewed coffee and liquour mix to spoon into the holes - I think it needed a little more coffee flavor.  My guests raved and it looked and tasted fabulous - can't get better than that!  Thanks for the recipe!

So it came out lopsided - that was my fault! And I had a mishap with the icing but googled and found that after the first round of whipping, putting it in the fridge for 30 minutes and then blasting it full power for about 4 minutes finally turned it to the right consistency. The only downside (which could be an upside!) is that my uncle had two slices, and we all swear that he was drunk by the end! Maybe doubling the liquor wasn't such a good idea.

This was an awesome recipe!  I made this for my family for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  It's not too sweet and not too rich.  I did what most of the previous reviewers recommended.  I used 2 coffee layers, tripled whatever coffee (instant, liquor) the recipe called for.  I did not add any coffee to the icing and I dissolved the instant coffee in a couple tablespoons of hot water before putting it in the cake mix.  All in all, I will absolutely be making this again!

I doubled as everyone suggested.  Mom wants me to make it for Xmas!  I made the error of using Baily's instead and it still tasted great.  I only had 2 8" pans.  Filled one half and filled the other coffee one full and baked it longer.  Cut it with a serrated knife for the 3-layer look.  We liked having the different colors of coffee and white.  I will next time put chocolate in between layers.  My grocery store sold a mascarpone which was already Tiramisu flavored.  This made such a professional presentation and was easy to make.

Spectacular!! This is a keeper.  I made this for my adult son's birthday which we celebrated on Thanksgiving. It blew away the pumpkin pie by a mile. I did triple the coffee & Kahula everywhere it was called for. I made 2 coffee layers & 1 white. I refrigerated after baking & cooling, then I saturated them by brushing on the coffee mix, then I froze them overnight before assembling. I also doubled the filling and made an extra 1/2 recipe of the frosting. I used it all. I didn't have luck with the chocolate curls so I just grated the chocolate over the top. It was fun mixing and matching everyones ideas on this cake.

This was pretty good! We do like our tiramisu a little bit more moist, so I think the brewed coffee should be alittle bit more, if not doubled. After reading many of the reviews, I did double all the liquor and the instant coffee wherever it was called for. I just love coffee, so I think maybe next time I might even increse that a little. I used starbuck coffee liquor, which is pretty strong. I dint have mascarpone cheese and I can never find it anywhere, so I used a substitute recipe I found on this site. Overall, its a yum cake!

The family loved this cake!However,I was somewhat disappointed.Followed recipe and could taste the packaged cake flavor in the layers without coffee.Also,the frosting turned out like the packaged "Fluffy White",which I do not care for. Will make again though for family and try coffee in two if not all three layers along with a cream cheese frosting.

This cake got rave reviews on taste and presentation from everyone, including my kids. My only modification was to double the liquor (I found Starbucks coffee liquor at the spirit store).  I love the filling.  I used a spray bottle to distribute the coffee mixture evenly on the cakes. I garnished the cake with chocolate covered espresso beans and chocolate curls (I used a Hershey's bar - my baking square wouldn't make curls). Thanks, Bettina, my husband says, "don't lose this recipe!"

Fabulous.  I took it to my medical school's picnic and TWO people scraped the bottom and licked the serving utensil.  My mom thought it LOOKED so tasty she made it and also got rave reviews.  The coffee crystals  didn't dissolve for me in the cake batter.  It's really only an aesthetic problem but if you want to avoid you can just dissolve the crystals in about a teaspoon of water before adding them.  It's not damaging to the cake.  Phenomenal!

i have made this several times and it is a winner! i have doubled  the liquor each time, and also have used the mascarpone cheese substitute. i would recommend letting the layers sit in the fridge/freezer for about 30mins so that they don't fall apart when stacking.  Thanks!

Holy cow!  This was delish!  I made it for my father's birthday and he LOVED it!  Even my kids loved it with the coffee flavor.  There were a lot of steps involved, but overall it was not a difficult cake to make and it turned out beautiful!  YUMMY!  I can't wait for the next birthday!

First of all, got lots of compliments!  Made white box cake, added 3 tsp instant coffee. Lined 2 9 X 13 pans (didn't have round cake pans) with aluminum foil, split batter between them.  Baked, poured coffee mixture (didn't have coffee liquor so used this: boil 1 1/3 C water & 1C sugar for 5 minutes, add 1/3C instant coffee, remove from heat, add 1tsp vanilla extract, cool 1/2 hour) over both.  Popped pans in the freeezer till I was ready to assemble.

What an AWESOME cake! I made a few adjustments like a lot of others. To keep this cake alcohal free, I omitted the coffee liqueur and used an instant cappacino dry mix.  I also didn't use the marscapone cheese and instead used one block cream cheese, 3/4 c. powder sugar, 1/2 c. heavy whipping cream and 4TBSP. of the dry cappacino mix(Hazelnut Belgian Cafe). In the frosting I used 2c.Heavy cream, 3/4c. powder sugar, and 1 heaping TBSP. of the cappacino mix. I also kept the cake in the fridge until serving. Definitly a NEW favorite recipe!!!

Wow! This impressive layer cake even wow'd the Italians in my family! I have made this 4 times and each time it has come out perfectly! I typically go to my local barista and get a short espresso (~2shots) and use this instead of the brewed coffee and coffee crystals: Tastes and SMELLS delicious. I also used Kaluah, which gave it that perfect flavor to go with the rich creams. I usually have left over filling or frosting - try freezing little blobs in muffin paper or ice cube trays. Great to add to morning coffee! Thanks for the recipe!

I couldn't find the mascarpone cheese so I substituted cream cheese.  When I took the cakes out of the oven they were very lopsided, You'll need to level off the tops by cutting the peaks off.  I've never made chocolate curls and couldn't get large ones; I guess I need practice.   Maybe use a cheese slicer vs veg. peeler...   Over all the flavor and texture was moist and very good though!

Very light, not too sweet, super yummy cake!  I had the recipe as directed and found that the layers were a little thin for my liking. I would recommend a 8 in round pan (rather than 9 in). Or if you only have 9 in, yet two boxes of cake mix, use 1.5 for the cake, and use the rest for cupcakes!

Easy - Delicious and Gorgeous.
One thing that I noticed was that while I was assembling the cake it had a tendency to slide. To stop this from happening, I used two bamboo skewers to hold it in place. I froze the cake when I was done and pulled out the skewers. I let it sit about an hour before serving and it was perfect.

I made this for my husband for his birthday as he loves tiramusu.  The cake was very good.  However, I am giving it a four instead of five because the cake needed a lot of alterations.  I always read a lot of reviews before I decide to make a recipe but I didn't for this cake and really wish I had.  Even though the cake was good, I could hardly taste the coffee and as many advised I should have added a lot more coffee flavors.  Also, someone mentioned the cake is better if made a couple of days ahead.  I also had a hard time following the recipe as to when to put coffee and liqeuer in what: filling, cake or frosting.  This recipe is good, but I would think it would be so much better with the alterations the posters have suggested.  Therefore, I am giving this recipe four stars.

Oh my gosh---this is good.  When I was looking for a fast and good dessert to serve at an after the holiday dinner party, I found this recipe.  I wanted something that would be light and not too sweet since I knew that everyone was sick from all the sweets we ate over the holidays.  

When I read all the positive reviews about this recipe, I said---"This is too good to be true!"  Well---it is THAT good.
My dinner party was a success and ended with everyone enjoying the light and refreshing flavor of this cake.  It did taste like tiramisu, but was much easier to make.  It is hard to believe that this is from a box cake mix.

The next time I make it, I will make sure that I add more coffee to get a stronger coffee flavor.  I used Starbucks coffee liquor and it was YUMMY.  In addition, I used Starbucks double expresso in a can for the liquid, and it too was wonderful.  

Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.  I will make this again, and I will make this often.  I cannot wait to make it for my Italian family.  They are going to love it too.

I love tiramisu.  Love it.  I am unable to get ladyfingers any where around here.  So I always order tiramisu when we go out to eat.  Then I found this recipe.  I was so excited to make it! And boy did the lengthy recipe pay off!! I think my hubby ate one or two pieces and I ate the rest!! It was soooo good and very beautiful! The only change I made to the recipe was I used espresso for the coffee layer.   Thanks for the great recipe!

This was great.  I made it for a party and everyone loved it.  I doubled the coffee ingredients as others had suggested.  I didn't have a very strong coffee on hand and it still tasted good.  I recommend getting a stron espresso though

I was skeptical about such high reviews for a box cake mix, but this is amazing.  I doubled both the liquor and coffee whenever added.  I took this to book club and everyone loved it!  Thanks for the amazing dessert.

This recipe is awesome!  I made it for my Fiance's birthday and everyone raved about it.  After adding the coffee mixture to the cake it tastes like you made the whole thing from scratch.

WOW.  I've made this cake twice now, and it's fantastic each time!  I experimented using espresso instead of coffee in the khalua/coffee mixture, and the coffee tasted MUCH better.  The espresso was a bit too strong and competed with the rest of the flavors.

this is the first recipe i have used from all recipes........i will be back! this was wonderful!  great feedback from guests-kids loved it too.  i used the substitue recipe for the cheese provided by others on the site and instead of instant coffee i used a vanilla nut cappucino powder. i used kahlua coffee liquer and vanilla creme flavored coffee.......absolutely delicious.  i also put pirouette cookies around outside of cake. they got soft from being in the fridge and from the icing but still very yummy! thank you:)

This tiramisu cake is great!I served it after there had been a loss in my family and it cheered everyone up!Looks beautiful and tastes fantastic.Not exactly like tiramisu but any tiramisu lover will like it. I doubled the coffee layers and the coffee in each layer and i still thought there could be more coffee flavor. I also doubled the kahlua everywhere it was called for.This recipe wasn't just great to eat,I loved baking it too!

Thank you for an outstanding recipe! I made this for my son's birthday and it was the highlight of the evening. Followed the suggestions of making two coffee cake layers and doubling the coffee mixture. Even those who are not coffee fans raved about it. Keeper!!

The frosting and filling were absolutely delicious, my family loved it and just about everyone had seconds. However, I can't give this a full five stars because I'm a real tiramisu fan and the cake mix layers just didn't work for me. It might have been the kind of mix I used, but the texture and taste just wasn't what I had hoped. It was a little dense and bland for me. I would also recommend doubling the coffee to pour over the cakes, 1/4 c did not add enough flavor to the layers and that may have been why it seemed rather bland.

This cake was time consuming, but very good.  I did not have liquor, so I used starbucks in place of it.  I bought the mascarpone cheese that already had the coffee flavor (it was called tiramisu masacarpone).  I few people who did not like coffee did not care for this much, but I could not stop eating it!  It was very beautiful as well.

I made this cake last saturday and I cant believe how great tasting it is. Im very amateur on making a cake, dont want to mess up and want to make it in a budget. I didnt exactly made it the same way as all of you did but it turned out great. Based from the reviews this is how I made mine. Instead of making my own filling and frosting I bought a ready to use Cream Cheese Frosting (cheaper that way and I know it already taste good). My husband doesnt like liquor/alcohol to drink or in food so I didnt use one. I used 1/2 cup of coffee and mixed it with half of the cream cheese frosting and used it as the filling the rest of the frosting I used for the top of the cake and for the sides. I also did 2 pans with the instant coffee and put 2 tablespoon of instant coffee. Thank you for this recipe and for the suggestions of the other reviewers I was able to make a very amateur friendly great tasting cake. I definitely be making it again.

Excellent - I made it in (2) 9x13 pans for two layers. Easier to fit in my fridge! I doubled the coffee for each layer and still wanted a bit more moisture.

This was surprisingly easy to make and was a big hit at my last party!  Like many others, I doubled the coffee mixture that gets poured between the layers to add flavor.

I only have 2 cake pans so I made only 2 layers instead of 3. Was still a very nice cake. Great if you're looking for something a little different.

I hate giving this a rating like this because many other people have been so successful with this.  I love the Filling, and that cake was ok.  Maybe it's because I'm a very novice cook, but my frosting was WATER!!!!!!.  I used the heavy cream and the powdered sugar and Kaluha like I was told, and it is a watery substance, ABSOLUTELY NO THICKNESS.  I have been waiting for the right time to make this cake and unfortuneately I waited until my B-Day and it's not going to happen.  That was a waste of money.

First of all, I love Tiramisu so I thought the flavors of this cake were very good and it gave me a reason to use the white cake mix I happened to have. I found it easy to make and assemble. However, it wasn't worth the expense involved. Between the whipping cream, mascarpone cheese, Kahlua and semisweet chocolate, it's an expensive undertaking. I did follow the recipe exactly. I made it for an office going away party and while my coffee loving coworkers seemed to enjoy it, there were no rave reviews.  This is a dessert that is tasty and presents nicely but I could have purchased a real Tiramisu at the grocery store for much less. I don't know that I'd make this again.

I made this cake for my office and it was gone before 11:00 a.m.  After reading some other reviews, I also decided on two coffee layers and one plain and i doubled the coffee.  I haven't had much luck with layer cakes in the past, but this one turned out beautifully.  Any imperfections are hidden by the oh so soft and creamy icing.  The presentation is worth the limited amount of effort that goes into it.  The only downside to the cake is the price.  I only had 2 or 3 of the ingredients in my pantry.  On the bright side though, I can make another one anytime I want:)

This cake is great!  Each part of the recipe that called for Kaluha, I used 3 T.  Also to make things easier, I split the batter in half to make two cakes, putting instant coffee in one of them.  Pouring coffee over the cakes does not work!  Must use brush!!!  I made 2 cups of strong coffee, that way I new there would be enough to coat the cakes.  Next time I may make 1 1/2x the amount of frosting.  There was enough to cover, but I like it a little thicker.  Last, I didn't have time to curl chocolate, so I shook a bunch of Baker's pre-made chocolate curls on top.  Great cake!!!

This was soooo good! I made it for a cake party and have been asked several times for the recipe. And it is really easy, too. I made 2 coffee layers as others recommended, and wish that I had made more filling. Those are the only two things I would do differently next time. Oh, and I brushed on the coffee mixture instead of pour. It also looks really nice! ETA- I tried it this time using cool whip for the frosting and adding a bit of coffee liqueur to it. It didn't work that well, wasn't thick enough. I salvaged it, but just as a warning, use the real whipping cream!

This was really good. Everyone raved about it. Made it twice in one week. The first time, it took me a while to make, the 2nd time was much easier and quicker, which is to be expected.

For those looking for a quick Tiramisu, this is your recipe. For those looking for a Tiramisu recipe, this is more like a cake and the cake IS pronounced. Nonetheless, this is a great recipe. 5 Stars!

my first time making Tiramisu
YUM YUM YUM !!!
My husband is just eating it up
just told me to stop skimping on the slices, and to make sure there's one in the fridge every week
took others advise and doubled the coffee mix, used Kahula also
took 2 days to make so the flavors would set in nicely
sustituted whipped cream for heavy cream
will use heavy cream next time
thanks for a great recipe
will be making again and again

Absolutely delicious! I just made this for my husband and he loved it. He likes Tiramisu to taste light and fluffy and this turned out just right. I made 2 coffee layers and 1 white layer in the middle. I'm going to post a picture as well. My best looking cake so far! Thank you for a great recipe!

OMG…this cake looked and tasted exceptional!!!  It is perfect if you are really trying to impress someone!  I made this cake for two of my best friends (they are twins), who love tiramisu, for their birthday and I got rave reviews!  I added a bit more coffee (close to a full cup) and I increased the liqueur (Kahlua) to 4 Tablespoons.  I made the cake in stages over three days; first I made a classic white butter cake recipe from scratch.  The second day I made the coffee mixture to drizzle over the cake and the filling, I let that sit for a day, and lastly I made the whipped frosting and chocolate shavings/curls.  I wish I could give this recipe 10 stars!!!

It tasted awesome! I did what the other reviewers said and added more flavour. I mixed the coffee powder directly into 2 of the batters. Thus I would have 2 brown coloured ones and one white coloured one (for the middle). The flavour was awesome and the cake was fluffy. It tastes especially good after you've put it in the fridge for about 12 hours. The only thing that I didn't like about this cake was that it was too big! The layers were so high. My cake came out about 6 inches high. Crazy. Next time I'll cut the cake batter in half. 
But nonetheless, awesome taste.

This one's a keeper.  My sister cut the first piece, pulled it out and said, "Oh, it's beautiful!"  Really like the alternating layers of cake.  Used "moist" boxed cake mix and watched it closely while it baked.  Since the layers are thiner they bake a little faster.  Forgot to add the frosting to filling (opted for mascarpone) but it turned out fine, just more difficult to spread. (Doubled the filling recipe -- can't have enough of that!)  Splurged and used espresso from Starbucks for the "marinade".  Used 1/2 cup (4 shots) espresso and doubled liquor + 1T to cut the bitterness of it (wasn't necessary in the end). Was worried it would be too bitter, but I made it the day before so the flavors could blend overnight and it was not bitter at all -- still had a *light* coffee flavor.  Would use the espresso in coffee layer too next time.  Garnished with chocolate curls and fresh raspberries.  Even with all that espresso, the cake was still gently coffee flavored and did not achieve even close to the soggy-ness of real tiramisu.  FYI, too much espresso/coffee will soak through the frosting and leave dark blotches on the outside of cake, so less may actually be better in this case.  Bottom line:  this is a *cake* and will look and taste like a flavored *cake* when you're finished -- not real tiramisu.  But it's one stunning cake that truly tastes as good as it looks!!!

Anytime my fiance has a birthday he requests this cake. Instead of using whipping cream I usually make it with Cool-Whip.

Excellent cake....and had I took the time to read most of the reviews I would have seen to add more coffee to the layers, and some mayo to the mix.  But all in all, next time I make it, it should be a 5 star recipe!!  Thanks so much!

I made this cake once for family and once for work and got compliments both times.  I did add more coffee into the layers and into the filling and it was so good.  Awesome recipe.

Unfreakinbelievable!!!  I regularly bake cakes for my friends' birthdays and use Allrecipes for ideas.  This is the first cake recipe that sounded good enough to follow exactly, and it is by far the best one that I have made yet!  I did have to stop and make more of the coffee mixture, so I would suggest preparing double the amount in advance to be sure you don't run into the same problem.  As the other reviewers recommended, I let the cake sit in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours before serving...  its more than worth the wait!

When making the cake, I dissolved the coffee into the wet ingredient so that the granuals would not be visible. This is the best dessert!

This is a very yummy cake, but it didn't have enough coffee flavor in it for my tastes.  I will definately make it again, I'll just add more coffee!!!  It was a beautiful presentation though, and everyone seemed to love it.  Also, the mascarpone cheese seemed very subtle to me, I almost think it would be better using cream cheese for a more rich flavor.  I may try it that way too.  Thanks for  the recipe!

Do make the effort to find marscapone cheese, its so good!  I didn't have any coffee liquor so i just subbed some of the brewed coffee where it was called for.  I used a trick i remember my mom doing, instead of baking 3 layers, i baked one in a deep cake dish and cut the layer in half, it worked out well.  Thnks!

Excellent cake - gorgeous, moist and not terribly difficult for the results. Agree that 2 layers should be coffee. I also added some grains of instant coffee to the liqueur since I bought an off-brand and didn't think it was strong enough. That did help. I set my timer to a shorter baking time than listed because I hate dry baked goods- can always add a minute or two to make it perfect but overcooked is ruined. My layers took closer to 15 minutes than 20. Thank you for my new favorite birthday cake!

The only ingredient I had to change was the cake mix. We have no 18.25 oz package cake mix, so I used a 15.25 oz. package. I followed the remaining recipe. Everyone loved it and I won second place in our baking contest at church. This was my first time making it and was so easy.

Will definitely make again. Followed others recommendations and doubled instant coffee in cake batter. Did 2 coffee layers. Doubled kahlua everywhere but frosting. Added a few tbsp more of powdered sugar to compensate for the extra liquid. 
Made the night before and refrigerated. Nice smooth taste, not too strong coffee or boozie taste.

I made this for my son’s graduation. I made a triple recipe, three layers. Homemade lady fingers. Used triple recipe for mascarpone cheese filling and had enough to use this to apply the lady fingers to the sides. I made a triple recipe of the icing, but only used half, so could probably have done well enough with a single recipe. Used icing to coat the top and add the decorative edging to top and bottom of the sides. Sprinkled some cocoa on top and decorated with some chocolate icing. Was excellent.

Made this for my mother’s 95th birthday. Everyone loved it. Made the cake in 2 9” pans & halved for 4 layers. Read the reviews so trippled the espresso & Kaluah. Also doubled the filling & frosting. Added some mascarpone to the frosting for stability & extra flavor. Made 1 cup of espresso with triple liquor for brushing the layers. It was a show stopper! We’re Italian so everyone loved the authentic tiramisu taste. Not difficult to make but does take time.

I made this excately according to recipe but the filling  turned out so very very thin. I left as it was but I know the filling should have been whipped until thick not just until smooth. I had some filling left over after completing the cake. I whipped that and then it was more like a filling and delicious too. Everyone loved the cake but next time I'll whip the mascarpone until thick and creamy then add the whipped cream. Will make again

I will give a very honest review.  If it was just up to the taste, I would give it 5 stars.  The easiest part of the cake is the boxed cake mix.  It is not a complicated recipe, but does take some time.  The tricky part is the whipped cream frosting.  Make sure your heavy cream is very cold to start with.  Also, be sure not to over whip the cream or it will turn in to butter.  This cake is a favorite with my friends  and family.   But, be prepared for a little work and this cake won't disappoint  you.

Delicious!!!  This was the first time I ever attempted to make tiramisu but it won't be the last.  I took the advice of some of the reviews by doubling the measurements for the coffee (instant and liquids).  I also liked the recommendation to put slices of wax paper underneath the edges of the cake while putting it together.  The wax paper collects the extraneous icing, cocoa and chocolate shavings.  Pull the paper away from the perimeter of cake once you have your finished product.  Since I needed the cake to serve 20 people, I doubled the recipe and baked two cakes in 9x13 pans... one plain and one with the instant coffee granules.  I sliced each one lengthwise.  This gave me four layers.  I had plenty of filling and icing by doubling the recipe.  All of the guests really enjoyed the tiramisu cake and were shocked I had never made it before.  It is not difficult to make.  The instructions are well written.  It is, however, a bit time consuming so plan accordingly and bake the cake the night before assembling.

Any recipe that has received more than twelve hundred reviews deserves a try, and now I can see why it has been rated five-star. I made it for my husband's New Year Eve-birthday, and we--along with our foody guests--agree it is probably the best cake ever. I followed the first reviewer's substitution for mascarpone, other's suggestions to use much more instant coffee when called for in the recipe, and the suggestion to chill the mixing bowl and beaters before whipping the cream. I also suggest that anyone making this for the first time to read the directions thoroughly a few times beforehand and allow PLENTY of time to make this. This cake is awesome!

I made this cake on New Year's Day for friends and family. Needless to say, it was a huge hit! Compliments included "remarkable,""divine," and "absolutely delicious!" The only adjustments I made were as recommended through reviews and the recipe's video (it portions some of the liqueur into the coffee that gets brushed on each layer). I upped the amount of Kaluah in each mixture, and made the mascarpone substitute instead of forking out the money for it (16 oz cream cheese, 1/2 c sour cream, 1/4 c heavy cream and blend until smooth). It was simple and amazing and beautiful! And I've already been obligated to bring it to upcoming get togethers. Thanks for the recipe!!!

I used French vanilla instead of white cake mix and a little extra coffee liqueur here and there. Always a hit! This has to be one of THE best cake recipes out there. Thanks!

Wow! This recipe is amazing. I followed the recipe exactly, but took the advice of other reviewers and let the cake sit in the fridge overnight after pouring the coffee mixture over the cake. Also, I found that I could have used more coffee mixture, a little more filling, and more cake (although the last was a rookie mistake, I did not distribute the thirds evenly which affected presentation but not taste). I made it for a birthday party and immediately received a request to make it again for another party. If you're thinking about trying this cake, do it! Delicious!

AWESOME!!!Made this cake last weekend and it was my first attempt at baking. I hated baking until last weekend. lol I have people in my family that do not like coffee so I modified it slightly. Instead of pouring the liqueur over each layer of the cake I added it to the batter of the 3 cake and then baked it. Cake still turned out great with coffee taste, just not as strong.

Fabulous,  I made this fabulous layered cake as indicated and it's perfect. Light and moist and perfectly flavored in each layer.  This recipe exceeded my expectations. I would not change anything. This cake will impress everyone.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Great recipe. I made it for my tiramisu loving husband who absolutely loved it. I made it exactly as the recipe called for and made no substitutions, nor did I double anything. I may have been a bit heavy handed on the Kahlua, but who isn't? I also used very strong Turkish coffee. Fabulous cake. Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome recipe.  The frosting, the filling, everything is amazing.  Made a white sheet cake from scratch but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  Turned out fantastic.  If you are looking for a tiramisu recipe this is it.

This was the most wonderful tiramisu cake I've ever had and the best part is I made it! Great recipe and I will make it for every special occasion. The response I had from those tasting the cake was "exquisite." The only change I made was doubling all of the Kahlua.

I made this recipe exactly as written.  It is an excellent concept but the finished product resulted in a Dry Cake that was nothing special. I think with some small changes it could be great though.  Here is what I will do next time - For the Cake  Use a 1/3 Cup of very strong coffee or Espresso and 1/4 cup coffee liquor per Cake layer. Mix a teaspoon of the instant coffee into 2 layers of the cake.  For the Filling - Double the filling recipe and double or triple the amount of coffee liquor in the filling recipe.  For the Frosting - Use 1/3 cup of powdered sugar.  Make sure all your equipment and the cream is VERY cold.  Assembling Cake - Poke holes in the cake using a straw.  Use a turkey baster to get coffee/liquor mixture into the holes.

Four stars only because I didn't make it as written - I used the same mods a lot of users did.  I made 2 coffee layers and it wouldn't have been nearly as good with only one.  Also I didn't have any coffee liqueur on hand, so I used strong brewed coffee in its place and it turned out fine. :)  Hubby and I both loved it and enjoyed this no-raw-egg tiramisu substitute. :)

This was a HUGE hit at work.  Tastes exactly like tiramisu.  My only change was not to add the frosting to the filling.  Just used the filling since I was making it the night before to take to work.  The frosting held up very well sitting overnight.  Thank you!  5 stars is not near enough!  Also use espresso instant coffee!

I've made this a few times - 4 layers for my husband's birthday - will make one today also! Followed many reviewers suggestions - ESPECIALLY use a lot of instant coffee. When making it when no driving is involved - I use enough Kahlua - it would not be safe driving!! I've used the inexpensive substitute for mascarpone and used mascarpone . . . both are good - simply different. Not able to say which one is best . . . I like them both equally. Eventually I adapted the frosting with the Whipped Cream Mousse Frosting recipe on this site for a take to a picnic ability frosting . . . really good.

Good but not exceptional as written. Based on the advice of other reviewers, I added more coffee (subbed  coffee for 2/3 water in the cake) for a total of approx. 1 cup coffee in the whole cake. I left the amount of liqueur as written. Coffee taste was still very subtle. Recommend adding more liqueur and coffee to give it a more pronounced flavor and more moisture.

This is a delicious cake, much enjoyed by all my work colleagues! Thank you for sharing the recipe. I used a homemade white cake recipe but with three layers, they ended up being quite thin. This was ok due to the richness of the filling and frosting, but I'd double the batter next time.

In deference to a Muslim colleague who doesn't consume alcohol, I substituted 1 teaspoon of Rum flavoring and 2 teaspoons of coffee essence (we get one in the UK called Camp Coffee). This worked out very well.

Made this (as written) for a birthday party, and everyone raved.  The only thing different I will do next time is use instant espresso powder instead of instant coffee and for the frosting I'm going to sub brown sugar for the powder sugar which is what I have used on other cakes. I will also try others suggestion and make 2 coffee layers. Still is great as is.

I used two cake mixes to make three oversize 9 inch rounds.  Then I followed the recipe as written and let it "age" in the 'fridge for two days before our get-together.  YUMMY!  Even non-cake eaters gave this dessert reave reviews!

NickyBaby61--I don't know if you made this mistake, but I slapped my own forehead when I realized it during my first batch. I accidentally mixed up my carton of heavy cream with my carton of buttermilk. So when I mixed the liqueur with the milk, the milk soured. And, of course, since it was buttermilk and not heavy cream, it never formed into a whipped cream texture. *Le sigh* But, I caught on pretty quickly what I did wrong, so that was resolved. 
As for my own opinion, the recipe is GREAT. I just like the cake to be more moist, so I tripled the coffee mixture (3/4 coffee, 3 tbsp liqueur). I saw another review about freezing the cakes a bit first, though, since the coffee might make the cake crumble a bit. I only read that today after I made the cake again last night. :-P I will remember that for the future. 
It's a fantastic recipe, otherwise, and it makes you look really pro (without having to go to school for it). The filling and frosting are to die for. I could eat them by themselves.

HOLY COW!!! THIS IS IS AWESOME!!! Tastes really light, cream filling and frosting went perfectly with the cake. I was worried about the filling leaking out of the sides of the cake, so after the cake was assembled I used a marinade syringe and squirted the filling into the middle of the cake to fill it up. Fantastic recipe :)

The overall taste of the Tiramisu was five star, but the actual process and the creation of it was VERY difficult! This recipe is meant for an experienced baker. I really really liked the tiramisu frosting. It was best the 2nd-3rd day after refrigerating. I might attempt this one again

I made this recipe without using any liquor. I used coffee extract mixed with cocoa powder instead. I used less than what was called for with the liquor as it is stronger. Alcohol is not an option in our house, the tiny bit in the extract is OK. I used four layers 2 coffee and 2 white. I froze the cakes then assembled them. I used the vanilla instant pudding in the whipped cream (as one review suggested) and it set very well. You can also use a teaspoon of unflavored gelatin in 2 tbsp hot water and cool it down and add to the whipped cream. This will make the whipped cream more firm and keep longer in the fridge. Also make sure your bowl and beaters are very cold when whipping the cream. I put mine in the freezer before whipping heavy cream, work every time. It was a big hit! Very good!

I don't usually like cake mix recipes ... but this had such good reviews I made for christmas.  It was a huge hit and I would make again in a heart beat.  I may try it next time with 2 cake mixes.  Now that the boxes are 15 oz instead of 18, i felt this was a small cake.  i used a 16 oz container of mascarpone so had very full layers but all in all this was a fantastic cake and I am going to try it with chambord and raspberrys next time ....

I made this as a dessert for my christmas dinner.  It's absolutely delicious!  A fluffy light cake, not very sweet and moist inside.  The light cream frosting is very tasty.  Definitely will make this again!  The only thing I changed is the garnish.  I used white chocolate instead of semisweet chocolate, just personal preference.  This cake would be great for after dinner, or special gathering over a cup of liquered coffee or white port.

Really good recipe. I thought that doubling the marscarpone filling made the cake even better.  This has become a family favorite during the holidays.

Excellent!  Served it alongside the Sweet Potato Pecan Pie for Thanksgiving.  Everyone LOVED it!.  Will definitely make again.  I also doubled up on the Coffee Liquor and used cool whip for the Frosting.  I did make one small mistake and forgot to mix a cup of the Frosting into the Filling mixture.  Not sure if it really mattered. I will make sure I do this next time I make this.  It was really Very quick and easy to put together.

This is a staple in my recipe box, and has become a family favorite and a legend in my office. Thank you! I layer mine in a trifle bowl and it presents beautifully. It is also fantastic with a chocolate cake base. Thank you for sharing!!

Did this cake for work and of course changed a few things.  I couldn't get the frosting to come out right so instead I mixed what I had done with a cream cheese frosting that I made and it turned out perfect! Infant I'm about to make this for a second time, with the mascarpone substitute!

My family are LDS and we had "Italian" night and modified the recipe using Roma(coffee sub) and chocolate syrup instead of liqeuer. It was Fabulous! My daughter loved it so much, we had to make it again for her birthday!

My grandma said it was the best birthday cake that she ever had! I listened to previous reviewers and made two coffee layers and one white layer. I added a bit more instant coffee to the batter than the recipe called for. Other than that, I followed the recipe as given and it was great. Deliciously moist. Tastes just like tiramisu!

This cake was amazing!!  So beautiful!  I added 3 tsp. coffee powder to the cake mixture.  For the coffee mixture, I used 1/2 cup espresso + 1 Tbl. Kahlua.  I made the filling as written, then for the frosting, I used 2 pkgs. Dream Whip whipped cream + 1/2 cup milk (and removed 2 Tbl. milk) + 2 Tbl. Kahlua (and no vanilla, as called for in Dream Whip).  Getting the 3 layers even is easy if you measure the batter before pouring into the pans:  1 cup + 1/3 cup + 1/8 cup in each.   I shaved white and dark chocolate on top of sprinkled cocoa.  This is definitely an adult cake, so make sure you serve a separate dessert for the kids.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Made per the recipe & though it was very good, I feel it could be even better. Unlike most other reviwers I felt there was enough coffee flavor. What I didn't like was the fact that the mascarpone cream was lost. Next time I'd make just 2 cake layers so that the filling will be more prominent. I'd also probably skip the ground coffee layer & perhaps double up on the drizzle instead.

This is seriously an epically awesome cake! It's easy to make, and one of those recipes that make people think you put 100x more work into it than you actually did. Quick to put together, and tastes amazing. It's also a very forgiving recipe, as I didn't follow it to a T and was still wonderful. Didn't want to spend 8 dollars for a teaspoon of instant coffee, so I skipped it altogether. Poured about 1/4 cup of coffee into the cake mix, and doubled all of the kahlua measurements. (4 table spoons instead of 2 in ALL parts where kahlua was required). The next time I make it, I might use 3/4 cup of coffee drizzle instead of 1/2, as some of it inevitably falls off he edges. Regardless, this cake barely lasted a day in the house. Light, airy, easy. Definitely would make again!

This was good but I took the reviews and and listened on adding the extra on the coffee and kahula and kinda wish I hadn't. The kahula was a little stronger than it needed to be for Tiramisu.

My cake looked beautiful but did not taste very good at all. Everyone at our family gathering liked the frosting and the cake but none of us liked the filling. I would make the cake again some time sans filling. And instead of using off brand coffee liqueur, I would use Khalua for a better taste.

This was an experiment as I'd never made tiramisu before...and it turned out amazing!  Definitely some things to learn...but the main thing is that I had to beat the frosting for 11 minutes before it was a consistency to spread, so don't stop mixing too soon.  I also folded in about a cup of the filling with the frosting prior to decorating the cake :)...and, as mentioned in a previous review, I didn't use any liqueur in the frosting  but used about a T of instant coffee powder instead.  I had tried, and failed, with the additional liquid of the liqueur and it turned out awful.  I, also, did two layers coffee mixture and only one white cake layer.  This is going to be in high demand from my friends :)

Best cake (I) ever made!  Thank you for the wonderful recipe.  I made it for my husband's birthday and he loved it!  This is a keeper.  I did up the coffee and liquor per suggested by some of the others.

I made this for my daughters' birthday party.  Everyone loved it.  I have made a lot of cakes and this one was by far the favorite.  I would definitely double the Kahlua and I used 1/2-3/4 cup of coffee.  I put coffee in two layers of cake.  My only problem was I used an instant coffee that was like little chips.  It turned out fine, looked like chocolate chips, but I let the cakes sit overnight to soften the coffee pieces and I assembled the cake the next morning.   Everyone raved, even the kids.  Not one piece of cake was leftover.  People were pre-ordering for their birthdays.  Thanks for the great cake.

This was an awesome recipe!  I do think I may have used 8" pans so I had a lot of filling left over, but it was a hit - just enough coffee flavor and not overly sweet.  I would love to make it more often, but mascarpone isn't cheap.  May try subbing neufchatel next go around.  Great recipe, though!

Delish!  Everyone loved it and wanted seconds. Made with inexpensive instant coffee and upped the amount of liquor as suggested. Would like to add more chocolate/cocoa next time.Definitely my new favorite.

Oh, holy cow was this good. I did as other reviewers stated and made 2 coffee layers of cake. Doubled the instant coffee and added an extra tablespoon on liquor wherever it was called for. The cake is light as air, looks super impressive, and tastes phenomenal. I had a little trouble with the filling being a little runny and leaking out of the sides. I may have over mixed it, or the extra coffee liquor may have liquified it too much. I found throwing it in the freezer for 10 min or so did the trick to set it. I frosted it, sprinkled with cocoa, added the chocolate curls, and let it sit overnight in the fridge. The guests were wowed, definitely a keeper!

I made this cake and it turned out moist and delicious, but I followed the reviewers suggestions who said to double the coffee liquer (I used Kaluha) and it was way too strong!  If I make it again, I will follow the original recipe!  Other than that, it was a big hit, but rather expensive to make.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure it was worth the cost compared to other cakes I've tried on this website.

I used this recipe numbers of times and allways comes out perfect. Our friends ask for it whenever we are getting together. I also discovered that it does freeze great when sliced and wrapped tight in freezer wrap. Great for those late night cravings...

This cake is wonderful! A friend of mine had the tiramisu layer cake from Whole Foods at her birthday party and so I searched for a recipie that was close to that one. This recipe is spot on!
I used Starbucks Via instant coffee and doubled the amount used in the recipe. I also omitted the coffee liqueur because I never have any on hand.
I have made this several times using either the mascarpone filling or the cream cheese filling, and honestly the cream cheese filling is easier to work with. Otherwise, A++!

OUTSTANDING!!!  My family and I are extremely picky about tiramisu.  This recipe is definately a winner!  So decadent!  I followed the recommendations to double the coffee and liqueur and it turned out perfect.  Only change I personally would maybe make in the future,  is double the amount of cake itself as I found the layers to be a little on the thin side.  All in all, this one is a keeper!  Thank you for sharing!

OMG!!!!!  This is awesome tasting and beautiful to boot!  I made this for my aunt's 80th birthday and there were RAVE reviews from all. Some guests thought it came from a bakery. Overnight refrigeration is best.  I made the cakes a few days ahead of time and froze them.  Made the assembly super easy.

wow! This was AMAZING! 
I have never made a layer cake before. This turned out so good. 
I took others' advice on doubling the coffee flavored ingredients. I wish I wouldn't have done that because I felt like it was kind of strong but, everyone who ate it said it was perfect.
Also, in my little town I couldn't find the mascarpone cheese so I found a substitute recipe on the internet that just creams together cream cheese and heavy cream.  
I will make this cake many many more times! Thanks for such a yummy recipe!

Having never tried any type of tiramisu prior I'm glad this cake was my first! It was totally delicious and my guests loved it too! I opted to make a 2 layer cake, as some others had suggested. Also, I used the mascarpone substitute since I'm not overly fond of an overly cheesy dessert.  I had absolutely no problems making this cake. Next time I make it I'll definitely cut the filling ingredients in half; I had a lot left over because I made a two layer instead. Like many others have recommended, make the cake the night before you want to serve it. The icing will settle beautifully overnight. What an awesome cake!!

This was a huge success at our Christmas Eve dinner.  It really stole the show :)  Everyone said it was moist and delicious.  I didn't get to try it, but it looked and smelled amazing :)  I even had trouble with one of the cake's sticking to the pan, but with all that whipped cream frosting, no one knew!

Awesome.  I subbed almond extract for the coffee liqueur in the glaze, as I didn't think I'd use the liqueur often enough to warrant buying it.  The replacement worked out great, but my result was not overpoweringly "mocha." I will absolutely make this again!!

Excellent! Sure to be the star of your next dinner party. Make sure you refrigerate the filling layer as stated in the recipe. I didn't refrigerate and my filling turned out a bit thin and didn't layer as thick as I would have liked. Next time, I'll be more liberal with drizzling the coffee mixture on the cake. It adds moisture and flavor. Almost like a tres leches.  I must have used at least a cup of Kahlua in the recipe, and it still tasted mild enough for little kids to enjoy.

VERY delicious and a hit with friends!  However, the frosting wasn't stiff enough with the amount of confectioner's sugar recommended and it could have used more cocoa powder on top.

Used Kahlua for the liquor. This was fantastic. My guests raved about this cake and have been asking for the recipe. It was gone in a day.

I made this cake for a work lunch and got lots of compliments.  After reading through some of the reviews I decided to use a little more Kahlua and instant coffee than called for and make my brewed coffee pretty strong.  I also used cream cheese instead of marscapone and it came out just fine.  I decorated it with dark chocolate curls and chocolate covered espresso beans and it looked quite elegant.  I will definitely be making this again.  I don't even like coffee and I liked this cake.

the cake turned out amazing however i suggest you double the amount of liquid that you put on top of the cake layers because it was a little dry. for a spongier and juicer tiramisu layers, add more of the coffee and liquor mix to enhance moistness and the coffee flavor. the filling and frosting were just right and held up great.

This cake was amazing!  The only comment I will make is to be careful not to over-bake the layers.  One of my layers was a bit too thin (I didn't split the batter well), and I over-baked it.  Seriously tastes like it came from a bakery - outstanding and relatively simple!

Wow, this was a hit! Made it for a party, and it was gone in a flash. The only changes I made were dissolving a tablespoon of instant coffee in 1/4 water in place of 1/4 brewed coffee, and I made two layers instead of three, one plain white and one coffee (using two tsp of instant coffee). It was a little time consuming to make all the individual components, but it was easy and quick to assemble. Will definitely make this again sometime.

Everyone just loved this and it was a nice easy change from regular tiramisu. It definitely needed more mascarpone and coffee flavor.

Excellent -moist but not wet & a wonderful blend of flavors!  I doubled the instant coffee in the cake batter dissolved in 2 tsp hot water, used 1/3 c coffee, used mascarpone substitute of cream cheese, heavy cream & sour cream & used 3 Tbsp kahlua for filling.  My tiramisu loving friends thought it was very good but thought it could use a little more coffee flavor next time.  My only complaint is that once assembled, my layers started sliding.  Next time I'll bump up the coffee flavor & make it more like a layered trifle in a bowl.  I'll definitely make this again!

My husband loves this cake, and when the first one I made was gone, he asked for another!  I make it with three 8" square pans - I thought it looked more "tiramisu-ish" that way!

I made this cake for a Round the World Dinner at my church, I have to say that this cake is #1 in my recipe book, I did follow the review of others and doubled the coffee and liquer, very moist, My Son is making this cake today for High School cooking class. We will be substituting the marcarspone with the cheese and sour cream. Let you know how it turns out. I give this recipe.  5 stars

I made this cake for my mom on Mother's Day, and she (and everyone else in the family) absolutely loved it!  My only suggestion would be to maybe add some water to the instant coffee powder before putting it into the cake mix...the granules were kinda weird in the batter, but it was a very minor thing.  The cake tasted so delicious and moist!  Excellent with strawberries too :)

My husband said this is the BEST cake I have ever made!!!  I did double the instant coffee, as well as the coffee and kahlua where ever called for, as some of the reviews suggested.  I have a home cake business, so I have a special white cake recipe that I use and I used that instead of a mix, I only used two pans, one with coffee, one without, then I torted each layer and filled with cream cheese mixture, ending up with two plain layers, and two coffee layers.  It was incredibly moist, and had tons of flavor, and was not sweet!  Will be making this one again!

This was a great dessert! It was simple to make and very impressive. I brought it to easter dinner and a friend's house, a large italian family. The only remark I got, aside from how good it was, that the coffee flavor should be a bit stronger. Which I agreed with, I may try and kick it up a bit when I make it again...and I will make it again.

OMG! This cake was heavenly! Everyone raved and wanted to know what it was. It looked beautiful with the chocolate shavings and cocoa. It was moist light and fluffy and just so delicious. I did not change the recipe at all. Followed to a t and it was big hit. This is going to be one of my new go to cakes for any special occasion.

I tried this recipe and then made some changes to make it heavenly cake! 1. I used 8 inch pans to make the layers a little thicker and made 2 layers with coffee (mixed 2 tablespoons of instant coffee) 2. I used Amaretto insteaad of the coffee liquer - using anything else just doesn't make sense if you want to call it "Tiramisu". I added a generous amount, making sure that you can taste it but it's not an overwhelming (and very alcoholic) taste. You can use the cheapest Amaretto you can find and you won't notice any difference in taste. 3. I used double the amount of mascarpone - again, a MUST ingredient of Tiramisu. Any reviewer suggesting that cream cheese will taste just as good must not appreciate the unique taste of a true Tiramisu.  Thank you for a great recipe to start off with. It is now a favorite in our family and our group of friends!

Wonderful cake.  I used the 8oz cream cheese, 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream & 2 1/2 Tablespoons sour cream instead of mascarpone since I couldn't find it at the store, anyway it was just as good.  Tripled all coffee and liqueur.  2 coffe layers and one regular layer.  Easier to use instant coffee instead of the brewed coffee.  You don't need to poke holes in the tops of the cakes if you have already cut off the top to make it flat.  I served this with French Vanilla Rolled Wafers.  Great recipe, thanks!

This is a new family favorite.  This cake is just so elegant, so tasty, and so impressive.  I definitely make 2 tiers with the coffee mixture, and use espresso rather than drip coffee.  I always add more coffee liqeur as well - I think Baileys would be great too.  I am excited to try some variations on this cake - maybe individual cupcakes?  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Made this for a dinner party and it was delicious!  Every guest gave it wonderful reviews!  Leftovers were wrapped and placed in the freezer (and still is delicious once thawed).  Will certainly be making this again!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Excellent recipe!  Followed others suggestions here to make two layers with the instant coffee and used a little more coffee/Kahlua between layers.  Not as hard as it looks.  I think once you've made it once it will be much easier/faster the next time.  Cannot wait to make this for the next family gathering!  This one is sure to please!

We had a Valentine's dinner with friends last night and I made this for dessert. While I was pouring coffee, everyone was ooohing and aaahing over this cake. It was a big hit with all and will definitely go on the make again list! I added more coffee and Kahlua than called for - about 2T each. My husband is using the extra topping in his coffee!

I have made this for my parents for Christmas for the past 2 years.  Tiramisu is their favorite desert so I thought I'd give it a try. Made it exactly as the recipe says both times and both times it was AWSOME! Thanks!!!

This is an excellent recipe! I've made this a few times, and each time everyone has loved it. It's one of the easiest desserts to make, but everyone tends to think it's the most complicated thing when you throw 'tiramisu' into the title. So it's a dessert you'll end up getting a lot of credit for:).

This was heavenly!  I am not at all a cake person, but this was soooo good.  I thought it looked like it might be a lot of work, but it was very simple to make.  I only did two layers because I only had two pans (one plain, one with the instant coffee).  Also, the mascapone cheese I found already was tiramisu flavored, so more Kahlua just made it even better.  Yum!

I didn't really like this, but I think it's personal preference to be truthful.  I prefer the tradition Tiramisu that uses Mascapone cheese and ladyfingers.  I found this to be a bit too sweet and heavy.

Delicious!!!  Made this for NYE and everyone raved about it.  I recommend making the filling first and refrigerate it for several hours before making the cake and frosting.  I was not patient enough and tried to assemble the cake right after the cake layers were cool, and the filling was not stiff enough to stay between the cake layers.  It looked a little sad, but tasted wonderful!

I never eat cake, but this was fantastic!  Light yet creamy, not dry with a nice coffee flavor.  I added a little more instant coffee to the middle layer, and a little more coffee liqueur to the liquid you pour over the cake.  Also used brewed coffee for part of the cake liquid.  Enjoy!

I love this cake! I make this for Christmas eve and it was a huge hit. I took some other people's advice and doubled the kahula and coffee flavoring. I froze the cake after I made it the day before, and I took it out a few hours before serving. It was perfect. We had some leftovers so we took them to another gathering the night after. It was still wonderful after being cut into. It did not dry out one bit. I will be making this again and would like to try different flavors. Thank you for such a great recipe! I will be sharing this one for a very long time.

OMG!! So good!! Really, really, really great! I am known for making cakes and baking all sorts of things, and this by far is the best thing I have ever baked! Stuck to recipe, used baileys for the liquer and espresso instead of brewed coffee. This was the last dessert of 2009, and it was the best dessert of 2009!!

A real hit at our holiday dinner party today.  A little time-consuming, but well worth the effort...pretty presentation.  I "made" the marscarpone from the recipes posted by other reviewers, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Used "heavy whipping cream" instead of heavy cream, as that was all I had available.  Watched the beating time, though, and it turned out great.  Will do again. for special occasions.

I didn't know how to add to my previous review....I had to add that you CAN make this the night before.  Don't be afraid.  This makes the cake even more awesome for me, because I have three kids.  To be able to make a cake, in peace, after I put them to bed and it be wonderful the next day is.....a blessing.  Enjoy!

This was a fantastic way to save time and give the Tiramisu a bit more to it with the cake layer.  A nice change to traditional Tiramisu.

Fantastic!  Doubled the coffee powder and liquor for every instance.  Also followed other's suggestions with making two layers (top and bottom) with the coffee powder and leaving 1 (middle) without.  Amazingly good!

Cake was excellent, very light. I divided the cake mix into thirds using my scale, and made 2/3 of the cake with coffee instead of water as called for in the recipe. That dissolved the granules much better! Used M84Michael's review for frosting-- "level 6 for the first 3 minutes then level 8 for 2 minutes in a cold kitchen aid mixer." It was perfect! I don't think the pirouettes were worth the money. The cake is pretty without them if frosted immediately. Plus the cake gets better over time, while the pirouettes just get soggy! If you do use pirouettes, you need two canisters, or to cut the pirouettes in half, which will be a little shorter than the cake.

Fabulous recipe! I made it for a small dinner party and it got rave reviews! Next time I will make at least 2X the amount of coffee/ kahlua.

Wow! What a delicious cake! The flavor is wonderful and I too agree to double the coffee and Kahlua.Four layers made it better than three, and it is a must that you use the mascarpone it's NOT the same with anything else!

I've made a lot of cakes, and this one is by far the best!  I doubled the amount of Kahlua in every aspect of the recipe, and flipped the laters so that there'd be 2 coffee ones and one while in the middle.  Anyone who eats it will be in awe of your baking talents and won't believe you used a cake mix!

Did the reverse layer thing another suggested, using 2 layers of the instant coffee and one of the soaked layers.  Was very light and delicious, and got rave reviews from all who had it!

This is the most AMAZING dessert.  You get the great Tiramisu taste b/c of the delicious filling and you also get your cake fix.  I did make some changes.  I made the cheese filling with 12 egg yolks and about 1 c or so of sugar.  Whip that until thick, then whip in the mascarpone cheese.  I used Kahlua and coffee to drizzle over the cake and I also put some Kahlua in the cheese filling.  I also used yellow cake mix instead of the white.  I generally prefer the yellow to white.  Seriously, you have to make this cake.  Next birthday that we celebrate (mine in August!), we will definitely be having this cake.

This was amazing! I have made it several times and actually have been paid by others to make it for them. The only changes I made was using Baileys instead of Kahlua and I added a little more than it calls for. I also added in a little coffee with the Baileys. I also switched the marscapone cheese for cream cheese. It turned out so good! I didn't have to make any alterations to the cream cheese. This is so good! If you love tiramisu, you will love this!

I add 1 tsp. more of the instant coffee to each layer cake to make it a nice rich coffee flavor throughout.  I love this more than the real Tiramisu!!

This cake was DA BOMB! Made it for my mom's b-day and everyone raved about how good it was. It's the perfect light, creamy dessert. The cake was super moist, with the perfect balance of coffee, liquor, and creaminess. LOVE IT and will definitely be making it again. Thanks for posting it!

I made this for Easter in a trifle dish with homemade lady fingers. I used Kahlua and substituted sour cream + cream cheese + whipping cream for the mascarpone as another suggested.  This turned out beautiful and was incredibly good.

I made this cake for all the teachers at my son's school, and they absolutely love it!!! To get the frosting consistancy, you need to beat it with a mixer on medium to high speed for a while. It will eventually thicken up.

I made this for my husband's birthday and everyone loved it!  I did increase the amount of coffee for pouring over the cakes to about 1 cup - and flipping the cakes over so that you're pouring the coffee over the bottom definitely helps.  I would recommend using espresso powder if you can get it, I used instant coffee and had some difficulty getting it fine enough for dissolving into the cake batter.

So good! Next time I will remember to make the frosting right before I frost it, otherwise it will get a little runny. I will also double the coffee mixture to soak the cake.

Yummy, yummy, yummy! I only gave it four stars though, because it was expensive to buy all the ingredients, and it took a lot of time to make, and I used almost all of my kitchen bowls/measuring cups. The coffee flavor was not quite the same as a traditional Tiramisu, but it was still good. My husband and son LOVED it! They said it was creamy, coffee-y, and really yummy.

WOW...WOW...WOW!!!  This cake is delicious!  I did the same as everyone else and doubled the instant, real, and coffee liquer everywhere in the cake.  I actually made two cakes for Easter since we had so many people over and there wasn't much left.  People were even taking large slices home with them.  Everyone was going on and on about how good it was.  Anyway, I highly recommend this cake recipe to everyone to try!!!

YUM!  I agree with another reviewer - this is an extremely forgiving recipe.  I messed up and added the 1/4 C. of coffee and 1 T. of coffee liquor to the cake batter by accident (oops!).  I feared it would never get done in the center - but it did!... and this cake turned out phenomenal.  I also doubled all the liquor throughout the recipe (AND doubled the instant coffee) (and I didn't remove any other ingredients), and this was so great tasting.  Lots of coffee taste, very moist and fabulous.  Also looked so professional on the plate when sprinkled with cocoa powder and chocolate curls.

Heavenly cake!  My daughter baked this for her father's birthday because he loves tiramisu. It disappeared so fast he only got 2 pieces.  We all agreed it was one of the best cakes we've ever tasted.

I made this cake not knowing what my skills might produce, not that i was second guessing the actual recipe or allrecipes. This was hands-down, the most delicious cake I have ever made! and my family couldn't stop talking about it. There wasn't a piece left-over. I have to say that is was a pretty involved process to make, but well worth the effort. I will definitely be making this again!

I wowed my mom-in-law with this for her birthday last night! I thought it would be a heavy cake, but I was so wrong..It was a very light and not too sweet dessert. Can't wait to make it again for a brunch dessert! It's perfect for spring and fall! Thank you!

Always a favorite here!  Easy and delicious!  I sonetimes use a store bought pound cake instead of making the white cake. It's great as well.

I'd like to thank Josie for her chocolate curl hint. If you missed that she suggests melting chocolate chips with shortening. Place the melted chocolate in a small pan and refrigerate it. As she says, then shave away. This is one great cake. Made it three times. My guests and hosts can't get enought!

This is an amazing cake. I still can't believe I made it! It is so pretty and tastes divine! The only things that I would do differently next time is double the frosting and also the coffee mixture that you pour over the cakes. Other than that, this cake is spectacular! I already doubled the kahlua and instant coffee. Next time, like some reviewers have advised, I will liquify the instant coffee first. Thank you for the recipe! This will be my "go to" dessert to impress!!!

I doubled the coffee liquier in this recipe as well as the coffee and it still could have used a bit more moisture. It was very good but it needed to be a bit more moist.  I made this 2 days before I served it so that all the flavors would blend.  I would triple the coffee amounts and double or triple the liquier amounts too.  I made chocolate covered leaves and put shaved chocolate on top.  Very pretty.

I thought the flavor was good (especially the frosting and filling), but the cake to me seemed more like "cake" than an authetic tiramisu.

This was excellent!  I doubled the filling and frosting to make it that much more delicious.  I made this for my Moms birthday and she raved about it for days.  Would recommend this to anyone looking for a easy and delicious cake.

As far as taste goes, this was so good!  I love tiramisu, & wanted to try this for my birthday.  I wasn't disappointed at all!  I didn't over-do the cake soaking, but I actually like it like that - not too mushy.  The only problem I had was with the frosting - no way did mine look like the picture, & it was pretty runny & hard to manage.  I put a bit more powdered sugar in & that helped a little.  Still, well worth the hunt for mascarpone (finally found it at Target, of all places, in the deli section)!

Tasted good but everything was RUNNY. I followed the recipe exactly. I don't get it. Thank goodness I made it for dessert on soup night so I could just dump it into a big bowl and call it a soupy dessert.

I'm rating this for my husband. Every year we go out to eat for his birthday, and he always gets tiramisu for dessert. This year we couldn't afford to go out, so I made this cake for him instead. He loved it, and said it tasted just like tiramisu from a restaurant. I'd never had tiramisu before, as I don't like coffee or alcohol, so that's why I'm rating it for him instead of for myself. I thought the alcohol taste was very strong, and I did not like it at all. But it was for him, not me, and he liked it so that's all that matters.  FYI, I couldn't find mascarpone anywhere here, so I used a substitute recipe I found.

I had made this cake to take to work and I had so many compliments and several requests for the recipe.  The cake has several steps involved but overall it is easy.  I also made it for a Pampered Chef party that had an italian theme and it was a hit.  Hands down it is a 5 stars.  In the region I live I could not find the marcapone cheese so on this web site there is a substitute marscapone cheese and it worked well in the recipe.

Easy, but I cannot give it a 5 for flavor.  I prepared exactly as directed. Next time I will use more coffee and liqueur.  I think 3/4 to 1 cup of coffee with about 4 tbl of liqueur.

WONDERFUL!!!! If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars, I would. It was amazing! The only things that I did differently, based on some of the other reviews, is (1) I made 2 layers with coffee and one white and (2) I made extra frosting. The frosting is awesome and really makes the cake. I made it for a birthday party and everyone thought it was fabulous. Try it, you won't regret it.

Totally loved this cake.  Was so pretty after I prepared it.  I did double up the coffee and I used homeade coffee liquer instead of Kahluha, and also doubled.  Made for Christmas and my mom said it was worth a blue ribbon.  Really creamy and very good.  I'd give it 20 stars if I could.

It is sooo good! I love how the different textures of the moist cake and creamy filling come together. It is so rich and flavorful. I had it for breakfast, what a good way to start the day! I substituted mascarpone with cream cheese and heavy cream (didn't have sour cream) as others have suggested. I wonder how different it would taste with the real mascarpone though. Next time I will try cutting the the calories and perhaps cut down the sugar in the frosting.

Since there is a lot of work involved with this cake, I always make 2 at a time.  I use 1.5 boxes of cake mix per cake to give it extra height.  Like others, I double the kahlua & coffee everywhere called for, and make 2 coffee layers.  Fabulous recipe!

My mom, who is known as 'the cake lady' was impressed when i brought this for dessert!  So moist.  I was worried about the liquer being strong tasting, but it wasn't at all.  You can always add more if that's what you want.  I did double the other coffee amounts, just not the liquer component.

This cake was delicious.  I used Duncan Hines moist cake mix and I might do two boxes next time as my cakes turned out pretty flat. I made a few days a head and froze them. Took them out while I was making the filling and whip cream frosting.  I did add extra Kahlua and I had instant espresso and used that instead of instant coffee.  Also, as someone recommended added shaved chocolate on each layer.  The cake was really light and very moist.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks for the great recipe

I followed the recipe exactly and the cake turned out yummy HOWEVER the ingredients were incredibly expensive and the cake hardly seemed worth the expense.  I liked the recipe enough that I might try it again.  Next time, however, I would make two layers with the ground coffee and double the coffee mixture (since the cake only had a mild coffee flavoring).  I think with those corrections, the cake would definitely be worth a five star rating.

Now that I have made this recipe a number of times, I can say that it is Excellent. I usually put one nip of Kahlua into the cake batter. Along w/a teaspoon of expresso grounds.
The last time I made this for my co-workers, I did the following:
Cooked 2 small cakes in round pans. Cooled, cut into lady finger sized rectangles.
I then layered the "cake" like I would layer a real tiramisu in a long aluminum cake pan. Amazingly delicious. EVERYONE always raves over this recipe!!

This recipe is absolutely awesome.  It has turned me into a master baker! ;)  I, too, doubled the liquer and made 2 of the three coffee layers, but I make extra filling and frosting and don't skimp on either!  I also brush the coffee mixture onto frozen cake layers instead of pouring over fresh.  This helps the cake stay together.  I've also done the variation ala strawberry shortcake, and it too is awesome!

Didn't have instant coffee so used mexican vanilla in the cake batter.  Grated chocolate in between layers for nice look when sliced.  Doubled liqueur and coffee. It was absolutely delicious!

Excellent recipe! One variation I did that turned out great was on top of the mascarpone filling on both the bottom and middle layers, I spread a thin layer of the whipped cream frosting and chocolate curls. It made the inside extra layered which tastes great, and each slice looks great because you see the chocolate shavings and two toned filling on each of the layers.

Since my cake pans are large I doubled everything and made a 4 layer cake for my husband's retirement party.It was beautiful and tasted so good that everyone couldn't stop talking about it. I'm sorry I didn't get a picture as people would never have guessed it was home made! The cake was moist, filling was perfectly set, and though I had made the cake several hours ahead of time, the frosting didn't lose it's shape or slide down the cake. I made a doily out of paper cut with hearts then sprinkled cocoa over it with chocolate curls in the center and sides of the cake. WOW!I also used more flavoring. The best tasting and most attractive cake I've ever made in my life! Thank you!

A bit time consuming but a wonderful cake. I too love coffee flavor so I took advice of previous reviewers and doubled everything coffee related (instant coffee, kahlua, brewed coffee)and was glad I did. I also made 2 coffee layers and one white. Everyone in my family loved it!!

I dissolved the coffee in 2 Tbsp. hot water before mixing into the batter. The white layers create a beautiful contrast with very dark streaks of coffee on their tops, so I would stick to two white layers and only one coffee layer to keep the deep contrast. I like tiramisu, but I like that this recipe is a unique cake instead, so I stayed with the recipe amounts instead of making the layers overly moist. I followed another cook's idea and used a spay bottle.
This recipe is a fantastic concept, but do use a homemade white cake if you have it in you. Even the strong flavor of coffee did not cover up the artificial taste and "lightness" of the cake mix.

I made this twice. The first time, it fell apart (my fault). The second time it stayed together but wasn't that great tasting. Coffee flavor is too light and I'm not a fan of using cake instead of lady fingers. I don't think I will try this recipe again. Still searching for an amazing tiramisu cake recipe!!

I made this cake for my best friend's birthday. She doesn't like traditional cake, so I picked something a little different. She and my friends all LOVED the cake (my boyfriend was a bit jealous I didn't make it for HIS birthday). My best friend's boyfriend even asked me where I bought the cake!

I followed all the tips above, like making two coffee-flavored layers instead of just one, and doubling the Kahlua, and using the substitute for Mascarpone cheese. 

One note: The recipe above from HEIDI8803 for the Mascarpone cheese substitute should be halved; the recipe it came from, the raspberry cheesecake, calls for 16 oz. of the cheese. 

The only problems I had with the recipe were my own fault; DO NOT let the frosting sit (probably common sense, but this was my first solo cake baking venture). Whip it up right before you are going to frost the cake, otherwise it will separate. Also, freeze the chocolate before you try to make the pretty chocolate curls, otherwise they are more like chocolate chunks. It still looked alright though.

I made this twice and varied the recipes slightly each time. I too had trouble with the icing and getting it thick enough, but aside from that it was an easy recipe to follow. The only major change was adding Italian Strega spirits to the filling.

DELICIOUS!!!

This was delicious!  I used Kahlua for the coffee liqueur, and I added a little bit more than the recipe called for.  This cake could have gotten me drunk if I hadn't already drank half the bottle while I was making it.  I will definitely be making this again.  One piece of advice: cut this cake into fairly small pieces, because it's hard to finish a big piece.

OMG!  This is the yummiest cake ever!  Instead of pouring the coffee over the cake when assembling, I put the coffee in a spray bottle and heavily sprayed the layers.  I had to add more confectioner sugar to the whipping creamy, because it did not thickened up for some reason.  Other than that...THANK YOU FOR THE RECIPE!

Good Cake. Lots of steps but if you like coffee, then it's worth it. I didn't read the directions well, and mixed everything in Step 1 together. But it was still yummy. Only had 2 cake pans, and that was still okay. Didn't have mascarpone in my market, so used Cream Cheese instead, and that was still good. So you can pretty much improvise alot, and still have a great finish. 
VERY VERY MOIST CAKE!!!

This cake was absolutely delicious and was a HUGE hit as my friend's birthday cake. The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that everyone thought it was the best "coffee flavored cake" as opposed to Tiramisu. It was pretty much just a layer cake. I am a huge Tiramisu fan and the texture has to be perfect. I would definitely make this again, however, I would probably double the mascarpone filling and double the amount of coffee that soaks into the cake...and then I will present it as "Coffee flavored cake".

A little bit of a disaster but that's most likely my mistake, and not a problem with the recipe.  My filling was too sour so I wanted to add more confectioner's sugar.  I had already added the 1/2 cup of frosting - and then blended it all on low speed.  It got SUPER watery.  When I tried to assemble the cake the filling just oozed right out.  No filling now.  Oops.  I'm still bringing this to my friend's party tonight because I had already gotten so far - I'll bring the "filling" as a side to be served on each cake plate.  Kinda lame but I hope it at least tastes good!  ~ LATER: Even so, it tasted good and looked impressive.  First time making chocolate curls - fun.  Decorated with choc. covered espresso beans.  Next time I will use less sour cream in the marscapone-substitute mixture.  And I will add much more coffee & kahlua to the cake layers.

The only reason I'm giving this 4 instead of 5 stars is because it didn't really rermind me of tiramisu at all. It was a great layer cake but need to amp up the coffee flavor.

To die for!  I didn't read all of the directions before hand and didn't notice you had to mix the marscapone with the frosting so I had to disassemble my cake (very difficult) and only was able to spread the frosting over the filling on one layer.  It was still awesome.  I followed other reviewers and did two layers of coffee and upped the amount of instant coffee to 4 instead of 1.  I also doubled the amount of liquor and coffee for the drizzle.  This is definitely a show stopper.  Thanks for the recipe.

Wonderful cake!  I doubled the the liquid to moisten the cakes and it came out perfectly.  Also, I forgot to add the cream to the marscapone filling layer and it didn't seem to matter.

I used only the filling recipe. The texture is very different from the bakery tiramisu's but my sister liked it... (and that really matters!) so I guess I'll give a good rating >.

This is a very yummy version of Tiramisu. It has a very delicate and sweet taste. Not a strong coffee flavor like most Tiramisus.

I have to admit that I am not a baker.  My cookies come out like rocks!  My boyfriend and I decided to tackle this recipe.  It came out delicious!  I still don't know how we did it!  My boyfriend doesn't drink, so I substituted the liquor with a slightly less mixture of immitation rum and vanilla extract.  Wonderful recipe, I would reccommend it to anyone.  Even if you can't bake!

Ditto everyone else's reviews.  This cake was absolutely delicious, and beautiful.  I made it for my husband's birthday, and it impressed everyone.  It's the first birthday cake that was completely gone - you know how most people take a few bites, or the health conscious bypass the birthday cake?  Nope, this one was fought over.  I followed the reviewer's advice and increased the coffee/ liquer mixture to 1/2 cup of instant espresso (from the 99 cent store no less :), and 3 TB of kahlua.  I increased the kahlua for the filling to 2 TB, and made two layers of cake out of the instant espresso.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!  I posted a picture of how it turned out too.  (Oh, it's really elegant with a border of ladyfingers around the cake, I had to trim it to fit though).

After making this several times following the recipe (still very good) I wanted to start customizing. Made cake from scratch using Cake Boss vanilla cake recipe. I doubled the filling for thicker layers, made 50% more of the frosting for thicker coverage, I doubled the coffee soak and  I added an extra tbs of coffee liqueur where called for. I find it tastes better if you let the cake soak at least 24 hrs. If time allows, also wait to make and frost the cake until 12 hours or less before serving. The whipped cream frosting will look fresh.

This cake is awesome!!  I have been making it for several years now, and everyone always talks about this cake.  Be warned- once you've made it for friends and family... you will be asked to make again and again.

Very yummy! I tweaked it a little bit though. 1) I didn't have any coffee liquor, so I used espresso instead. 2) I added the instant coffee and espresso into the cake mix, and just did a two layer cake. Really yummy, definetly a keeper! :)! It makes alot of frosting though, and i recommended putting some on top of a chocolate mocha drink! super yummy! Thanks!

Oh my goodness.  This cake was awesome.  My husband won't stop asking me to make it again.  It took a little longer than I like to spend on a cake, but it's worth it.  This cake is amazing.  I only made 2 rounds...a thin coffee round and a thicker white round that I cut into 2 layers.  I used a cheaper brand of coffee liquer (the Starbucks brand is $$$$) and it still turned out delish!  RAVE REVIEWS from my guests!  Thanks for the recipe!

This cake is EXCELLENT and not nearly as hard as you might think.  I took other reviewers' advice and doubled the coffee, and it was perfect.  The filling and frosting were so yummy!  Our dinner guests told us it was the best cake they've ever had.

Very good!  I made the cake from scratch, but did double the liquor on every step as well as extra instant coffee in the center layer.  It was beautiful and well worth the extra time.  Only 4 stars because I did have to make adjustments.

The final product tasted pretty good, but the coffee flavor wasn't pronounced at all even though I tripled the amount everywhere it was called for.  It was a lot of work, so I don't think I'd make this again because no one at my party raved.  BUT the frosting is TO DIE FOR and spreads so easily--I will definitely be making the frosting again.

I made this cake for a birthday dinner and everyone loved it...even non-coffee lovers!  I doubled the liquor for more flavor by putting the extra amount with kaluah and also doubled the filling.  It was pretty easy to make, but looked like I spent all day on it.  Everyone is asking for another one!

EXCELLENT! I made a "practice" cake the Friday before Christmas and my mom loved it. Unfortunately I'm not a big Tiramisu fan so only a few pieces were eaten from that cake. Then I made the actual "master piece" for Christmas dinner and my in-laws, who are huge Tiramisu fans, LOVED it. I used all the suggestions from other reviews like making 2 coffee layers, and doubling the amount of coffee anywhere it asked for it. I used 3/4 cup of instant coffee over the cakes. I will definently make this again!

Wow, this is even better than regular Tiramisu. The flavors in this cake are excellent. I made recipe exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. My Italian family loved it and asked me to make it again for our next gathering. It makes a great adult birthday cake too.

I made this according to the recipe.  It was absolutely delicious.  I would agree that it tastes like it came from a fancy bakery.  It got rave reviews from the friends and family I served it to.  Even my husband, who is not into desserts, loved it.

My family loves anything coffee flavored and this was no exception.  I took other reader's advice and doubled the coffee but it was still a bit subtle.  Next time I will add 3x the amount!  Since it was presented as a holiday dessert, I served the cake with cut strawberries along the base...it was beautiful with the white frosting and chocolate dusting on top.

I don't like coffee, but I made this for an office lunch and everyone loved it. I doubled the amount of coffee as so many of the comments suggested and the reaction was mixed. Some people said it was just right, others said it could have used more. No one, however, said that doubling the coffee flavor was too much. Overall, it was a hit!

Possibly the best dessert I've ever made! I wasn't even sure I liked tiramisu (I was making it for a visiting friend), but it was wonderful. I followed other reviewers' recommendations and doubled the kahlua and coffee amounts. I also made 2 coffee layers and 1 white layer. I doubled the filling and discovered my love for mascarpone. Along with the incredible taste and moistness, this cake also looked gorgeous!

I doubled the coffee as others have done and found that overall it needed more filling (will do 1.5 times the filling next time) and that more frosting was needed as well as the increased moisture into the cakes meant that the tops of them wanted to crumble when I tried to spread the filling and the frosting on them.  Also, I wasn't thrilled with the texture of the frosting so next time will probably whip the cream then add the sugar and liquor.  But, I was told that althought the density is not that of traditional tiramisu that it was about a 7 out of 10 so not bad!  I enjoyed it too - and it reminded me of a cassata cake.

This was great!  Made it the real way first then a second time with the mascarpone alternative from this site using light cream cheese then cool whip lite instead of the heavy cream in the frosting.  Both were great!  Got many requests for the recipe even with the lighter version

I made this cake for my husband's birthday. I had to make this in four 8" pans since I didn't have the 9" pans.  I used just a little more coffee granules mixed with a tiny amount of water because I made 2 white layers and 2 coffee layers.  Since I used 1/2 the batter instead of 1/3 for the coffee layers, it required just a bit more. I also increased the coffee for brushing on the bottom of the cake layers (since I had 4 not 3)  I didn't use additional Kahlua and didn't change anything else in the recipe.  I had enough filling and frosting.  I thought it was great. Everyone else liked it, too.

This was absolutely wonderful!!!!  Made it for a party and it was enjoyed by all. I, too, added more coffee liquor than called for, but did not have trouble stacking the layers.  I did not, however, come close to using 2 Tablespoons of cocoa powder.  More like 2 tea.  Other than that, did everything the same!  Thanks!

The best. The only problem? I'm a little hesitant to say that it uses a box mix! So I have to say it's a secret recipe! Sort of a lot of little steps, but none of the steps are hard to do. Great for a beginner :) Easy!

This cake is wonderful.  I used it as my cake recipe in a Wilton decorating class so I didn't frost it with what I wanted to.  Ignoring the Wilton class icing...this cake is simply delicioso!!!!! I torted both layers, brushed the coffee mixture over all layers, then topped with the coffee mousse layer then sprinkled cocoa on top of the mousse.  I put it together 2 days prior to being tasted tonight after class and it was moist and wonderful.

I made this excellent cake for my friend's birthday and it was delicious, not too sweet and the perfect consistency.  Like other reviewers, I too used way more coffee and liquer for each of the layers, and did two coffee cake layers instead of one.  Thanks for the great recipe, I'll be making this one again.

I've been looking for a good tiramisu cake recipe for a couple years and finally found it.  I had to manipulate a couple of the steps because I only had a bundt pan but all of my guests LOVED it.  I will definitely be making this cake again!

This is an amazing cake. Admittedly, when you make it, it doesn't quite look like the picture. The frosting's a bit yellower and the chocolate curls aren't going to come out as well, but it tastes great. I've taken it to quite a few parties, and each time, it's disappeared instantly!

I made this for my sister Jasmine's birthday and it was a hit!  I coffee'd two of the layers and spread on Nutella to the two layers as well.  I also payed attention to previous comments and doubled up on the Kahlua.

This was one of the best cakes I've made in a while.  My family loves when I make tiramisu, but this was not nearly as labor-intensive with the exact same flavor.  Great recipe, I would not change a thing.

This cake was definitely worth the time and effort. My mom LOVES tiramisu, and was thrilled to have a tiramisu cake for her birthday. The only changes I made were adding a bit more Kahlua, as recommended in other reviews, and making two coffee layers w/ only one white cake layer. To die for!

This recipe is wonderful.  It's the very next best thing to the real thing. I found it easy and delicious. Five stars for sure.
I tried drizzling the coffee/liqeur over the bottoms of the layers.  It absorbed much better than poking the tops and pouring.

I was so pround of the cake I made! I made if for a birthday bbq and received rave reviews. The cake is not too sweet and very light in texture. I actually had some frosting left over and made the yummiest ice cream with it.

Decoration suggestions: chocolate curls and toasted slivered almonds on the sides.

Made this for my cooking club on Italian night and it was a huge hit!  I definitely would double the coffee/liquor mixture the recipe calls for and add more coffee to the layer that calls for it.  The prep time was more than the 5 minutes that it lists; I would say it took me about 2 hours from beginning to end.   It was worth the trouble!

I took this cake to a party, and everyone seemed to like the flavor.  However, I am giving the recipe four stars because I found it very difficult to make - not what I expected using a mix as a base. I won't bore you with all the problems I experienced, but the main one was getting the coffee mixture/filling to work between layers.  Although I brushed on the coffee mixture rather than poured it, it still made quite a mess, and then the layers were so soggy that they crumbled when I tried to spread the filling on top.  The end result was not the prettiest cake I've ever seen, but at least it tasted good.

Very good but add more liquor.  Next time I would add a tablespoon to the brewed coffee and add a bit more to the icing and filling as well.   I also split the batter into two pans instead of three.  I don't have three cake tins.  It works as well.  Everyone liked it.

I've made this twice and it's excellent.  The second time I made it I had to use 8 inch pans and I thought it looked better.  I also didn't add the cream to the filling and found the filling easier to use and the layers didn't slide.  The only other change I made was to decrease the whipped cream frosting by half; I still felt there was plenty.  Thanks for an awesome cake recipe!

this recipe was fantastic and easy!  Didn't even last a whole day.  Made as directed except brushed coffee on layers as other suggested.  The mascarpone filling is quiet enough in this cake, some had said it needed more but once I folded in the stiffly whipped cream it was plenty.

I work for Starbucks so I used this cake for a work meeting.As
suggested earlier,substitute the water(in the cake mix instructions)for a coffee brewed strong(I used Italian roast)For the mixture poured
on top of the cake I used 
Starbucks coffee liquer-I also
used this in the frosting.The
second time I made it I used
a can of Starbucks doubleshot
-both worked well but the liquer had more of a "kick"
to it.I made the cakes the night before to let the coffee
soak into the cake and to avoid the finished product being "wet".I topped with chocolate shavings and chocolate covered espresso beans(which may be overkill)and served with coffee(of course!)

It doesn't get any better than this!  I've made it as a tri-layer cake and as a trifle.  It is great both ways.  Always beautiful and always well-received.  It is totally worth the time and money!  All I do differently is use 3/4 c. coffee mixed with 3 tbsp. of Kahlua for more moistness and flavor in the cake layers.

I couldn't find mascarone cheese so I used lite cream cheese and also used Irish cream instead of Kahula because I had some to use up.  I will use Kahula next time, but this was also very good and everyone loved it!!

I made this last night for and "Italian Dinner" with friends.  It was absolutely wonderful.  I made 2 of the layers with coffee and just one plain white layer.  It was beautiful to look at and just as wonderful to eat.  The only thing I did differently was instead of brewed coffee I just used the International Foods Hazlenut coffee since I could make just what I needed quickly.  This is a definate keeper.

Extremely easy to make, super delicious, highly fattening (who cares?)... I had to double the amount of brewed coffee with kahlua to soak the cakes with but other than that I didn't change anything and My Goodness, Mascarpone kicks butt!! It's not expensive at all, I paid slightly over $3 for 8oz at Wally World.

I made this cake for Easter dessert and it was a huge hit! I was accused of buying a cake and passing it off as my own. :) It is very light and yet moist. Next time I may slightly increase the amount of the coffee/liqueur mix for added moisture. Also, I refrigerated the cake for about 30 hours and I think this gave the flavors time to blend. It was nearly perfect! Beautiful presentation, too. Enjoy!

This cake is amazing!! I have made it one time before and it was as warmly received this time as it was the last!! I opted to add the instant coffee poweder to all of the layers for a little more of a coffee flavor, so I did not get the nice alternating colors, but when it comes down to it, the taste is fantastic!! I would highly recommend making this cake if you're a tiramisu fan! It's very easy and a real crowd pleaser!!

Absolutely the best yet!  Be sure to make it at least a day ahead of time so the flavors have a chance to "meld."  Much nicer texture than the standard Tiramisu (that sometimes tends to get soggy).

I am giving this four stars because of the dryness. I love tiramisu and this would be fabulous if it had more liquid. I didn't have the liqueur and subsituted with rum and drizzled chocolate syrup over each layer. I will definitely make this again - but with more coffee/rum.

This cake was delicious, even though I screwed up!  You can't beat a recipe that succeeds even when the cook fails.  I used Medaglia d'oro instant espresso coffee I found in Whole Foods for the middle cake layer. The problem was that I read "1/4 cup of instant coffee" instead of 1 tsp. (I was looking at the item below it) and as soon as I mixed the 1/4 cup into the cake layer I knew it was wrong.  I tasted the batter and thought for sure I had ruined it, but since I was without a car and without another cake mix, I proceeded to fix the cake completely.  It chilled and I served it to my husband for our anniversary.  I was very skeptical.  But it turned out fantastic.  We both loved it.  This is the way to go if you want more coffee flavor (next time I will probably use less than 1/4 cup of instant coffee, but definitely double the coffee/kahlua drizzle mixture.)     I used the mascarpone cheese, whipped the heavy cream for close to 6 or 7 minutes and got filling and frosting that was not runny at all.  Try this recipe.  You will love it.

made this for my sister's b'day...didn't have instant coffee so used approx. 1 Tbs. of Ghiradelli's Mocha hot chocolate to flavor the middle layer....frosting the cake wasn't so bad...the Kahlua wasnt pronounced, so for my personal preference I might add a bit more next time...all in all yummy!!!!

Wonderful. Rave reviews at a party after following directions to a T. I like my tiramisu on the chocolately side, so the next time I make it I'll sprinkle some sifted cocoa powder over each layer after brushing on the coffee/Kaluha mixture. Also I used something new (for my small town) for the cake mix -- French vanilla flavor. Was very nice.

I had a hard time with the frosting (it kept running off the sides of the cake), but the rest was very easy to make and tasted DELICIOUS!  I made it for my mom's birthday and she loved it.

Umm, this was AMAZING.  Lighter than real tiramisu (not in calories, in taste) which is delicious.  I used more of the coffee mix to saturate the white cake layers like the reviews said to do.  AMAZING recipe!!  I would give it 6 stars if I could!

YUMMY,but i did double the filling and made 3/4 of the coffee with 5 tbsp of kahlua. I did let my cake sit foe 24hrs before cutting into it...it was very moist! I had many of my guests going for seconds if you can believe it (it was one BIG slice)

Rave reviews! Everyone (21+) loves it! I have never had such a reaction from a cake before, well that's because this isn't your average cake. I am deliciosuly musing over the idea of having it be a layer of my wedding cake, yeah it is that good! I did use a little more Kahlua than the recipe stated, i eyeballed it and went my taste. I also made a little extra frosting and folded it into the mascarpone filling layer (about 1/2 cup) Also, I put some kahlua into the layer that has the instant coffee before baking. It made the middle layer much darker! Fantastic! Instead of chocolate curls on top I sprinkled the cake with crumbled health toffee bar. After chilling for a bit, the toffee gets soft and so so yummy! One Tip: This cake should not be eaten immediately, it does need to be chilled, preferably overnight. It tastes best that way.

I'm not a regular baker, but this one was pretty easy to do.  My 12 yr old son and I breezed through this in under 90 minutes complete - plus we made the white cake mix from scratch - not a mix, too. So for people who say it's a bit hard, come on!  Cake was delicious, not too sweet and had a great texture.  Would like to try the mayo trick next time and definitely more coffee mixture (I used Tia Maria and some Starbucks, not Kahlua).  To get the big curls of chocolate, you really need more than those little baker's squares - so get yourself a big honking Hershey's or whatever.  Also, bake time was closer to the 20 minutes than the 25 (although ours was not a packaged mix).  Any longer than 22 minutes and we would have had a very dry cake.  Mayo is probably a great idea.  Used a pastry bag and some of the frosting to put a nice edge on the top and bottom of the cake - was easy and made it look pretty good, too.  Will make again very, very soon.

This would have deserved 5 stars if it weren't such a pain to make.  I made the mistake of making it for my family, now they want it all the time!  It's a pretty good cake though.  I think I would like it better if someone else made it though!

This was delicious! Thank you for the recipe! I definitely will soak more coffee in each layer of the cake, as someone else mentioned.  I was afraid of making it too soggy, but it didn't get that way at all.  It looked beautiful, for such little effort!  It definitely was a hit at my party!

Tasty and a nice alternative to regular boring birthday cakes.  It is difficult to soak the coffee sauce into the cake layers, it tends to "run off", despite the poked holes.  Don't be afraid to just drench the layers.  As it was, I think it would have been tastier with even more coffee flavor, and to start that off, I would mix the instant coffee into all three cake layers.

This looks and tastes great.  I baked the Heavenly White Cake from this site as my base, and used 1 tsp. of instant espresso for the coffee layer.  I doubled the brewed coffee/liqueur mixture as suggested by others.  For the filling I used 12 oz. of mascarpone, 3T. of liqueur, 6 T. of sugar and forgot to mix in the whipped cream.  I assembled the cake 8 hours in advance and frosted with the whipped cream an hour before serving.  If you have access to mascarpone do use it; the texture and delicate flavour can't be duplicated with cream cheese.

This is the best cake I've ever made and it's very easy to make and DELICIOUS!!! Thanks Bettina. Mascarpone cheese can be found in any local supermarket. Look through the cheese section in your local store. I suggest not making any substitution. It's worth finding the right cheese. Again, very yummy!

A delicious cake, even better if you use a  homemade recipe. I doubled the amount of cofee, and only made two layers so it would be easier. Cream cheese is a fine substitute.

This was a great cake! My husband still requests that I make this every chance I get. I used International Coffee's Kahlua blend and regular cream cheese. I also used a bit more coffee flavored liquor than the recipe called for just to give it an even stronger coffee flavor. The filling was just like what you would find in a traditional tiramisu. This is a keeper!

I also substituted the mascarpone with 8 oz. cream cheese and added ¼ cup of heavy whipping cream as the mascarpone replacement (as suggested in an online search for a substitute).  Whipped the filling just until it got firm and worked out wonderfully!  Everyone loved this cake.  I too will double the coffee/liquor next time to give a bit more taste.  People were raving about how light and tasty it was.  Will definitely make again.

I would rate it 5 stars if I didn’t need to change a thing. But I never make this without at least doubling the amount of instant coffee powder (which I mix into two of the three cake layer batters). Other than that this recipe is fantastic. I’ve made it several times for parties and friends frequently request it now.

When I tasted just a bit of the cooked white layer, I was disappointed, because the tell-tale whang of cake mix was detectable, but the next day, it had absorbed the flavors and was exceptionally good.  Could eat it right by myself.

The person I made it for , sincerely said that this tiramisu is the best he ever tried, so as co workers who tried it next day. Everyone came for more!
I followed the recipe completely, except i added double coffee liqueur in each step. Layers come out soft, frosting is so fluffy and light. This cake is a quality made. It won't disappoint you for any occasion

Absolutely delightful, made cake-lovers out of my husband and two sons because it's sooo light and fluffy and not too sweet! Made the cakes, filling and frosting last night and refrigerated as another reviewer suggested.  Doubled coffee,  liqueur and brewed coffee and used squeeze bottle to apply coffee/liqueur mix.  Also piped both my filling and frosting before spreading.   thanks so much for this recipe!

The best tiramisu I’ve ever had!! Extremely moist and rich and not too sweet. The only thing I changed was the amount of the coffee mixture. I doubled it and only poured it on the bottom and top layers. It wasn’t too soggy and tasted amazing!

This recipe was a cinch to make.  It was so delicious!  I made the cake for  a coworker and everyone who tried it loved it.  It has a nice subtle coffee liqueur taste, not too overpowering.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is one of the best cakes I've ever made and it was received with amazing compliments, even from my family members who normally don't eat or like cake! I followed the majority of Allrecipes reviewers and doubled the Kalua wherever it was called for. I also only used two layers and added the instant coffee to both layers and froze them before assembling the cake. I made two batches/cakes and the 2nd one that refrigerated overnight was significantly more delicious having soaked up all the coffee overnight. I'll definitely make again.

This was tasty and an impressive dessert to serve. I made it two times in the last week -- here are my lessons learned. I'm new to making layer cakes so this might be more helpful for a novice like myself instead of a seasoned pro. 

Both times I made the cake, I made the layers ahead of time, added the liquid (coffee+liquor) and froze it. That worked well for me -- it was easier to frost and I didn't worry about the cake crumbling.  Also both times I made the cake, I doubled the coffee and liquor as others have suggested. The flavor was just right for me.  I found marscapone at Walmart for $2.99 (it was in a case by the deli and take and bake pizzas). 

The first time I made the cake, I made it for my gender reveal party. The cake was not the actual reveal (so I did not color any of the layers pink or blue), but I did use some pink and blue sugar sprinkles to decorate the cake, which I did about 6 hours before serving the cake. That was a bad call, as the sprinkles started to bleed on the whipped cream frosting (only around the cake, not on the top for some reason) and it looked awful. I covered it up with pirouette cookies around the side of the cake, and that helped a bit. I had a group of 20 people, so I doubled the entire recipe for the cake (quadrupled the coffee/liquor).  With double the cake batter, the cake was a little unwieldy, and I don't recommend doubling the entire recipe.  I also had doubled the frosting and filling, which was unnecessary and I had enough fros

I made this for my family and they loved it! I made my own substitute for the mascarpone that  Aria recommended. The cake turned out surprisingly light, not heavy at all. I also used Kahlua  because we enjoy that taste instead of coffee liquor.

I accidentally added half of the whipped cream to the filling instead of 1/2 cup! It was still delicious. I just ran out of icing so used the extra filling to ice the top of the cake.

Cake mix is not from a box as I have lactose intolerance, used the Simple White Cake  recipe x 2,  might just x1 next time as this cake is high.  Made the Marscapone cheese with just heavy cream and lemon juice, so simple to do yourself.  Great recipe on another site.
This is so easy to put together and will never have left overs.

Such a great recipe that I’ve made it twice already. I pretty much followed directions, but used smaller round pans because that’s all I had. On the outside I added Pirouline wafers which went on just before serving. The next day they were good, but soft. I also tied a ribbon around the cake which made it look so fancy :) The refrigerated cake still looks and tastes great 4 days later.

Wonderful recipe and everyone loved the cake. I did not have coffee liqueur so I used 1Tbsp Amaretto and 1Tbsp Triple Sec. I also used 1 cup strong expressions and doubled the whipping cream. Thank you for a great recipe.

Original recipe didn’t call for enough coffee or liquor, triple both so 1/4 cup for each layer works great!

This is a fantastic cake, but  it makes a really messy cake though. I always make it as a Trifle and it comes out perfect and has a much cleaner presentation.

This cake is SO good. Brought to a party and it was gone. One guy told me it was the best cake he'd ever had - he ate three slices!
I made as directed, but forgot to put the coffee/liqueur mixture on the first two layers. Don't think it mattered.

I wanted to bake a birthday cake for my Dad that wasn't chocolate.  So when searching this site, I came across this recipe.  It looked delicious and decadent.  Before I attempt recipes I like to read some of the reviews and often times I'll follow them.  So with that said, this recipe was amazing!  It was delicious and decadent and everybody LOVED it.  As for the changes made, like others suggested, I doubled the coffee and added it to 2 layers of the cake and  also doubled the amount of Khalua.  However, I also used 3c. of heavy whipping cream and I found that to be way too much.  I think 2c would have been perfect.  Not all is lost though.  I'm enjoying a cup of coffee with a dallop of delicious whipped cream

Made it as a birthday cake for a tiramisu lover. I don't bake  much and I thought it was pretty easy. It turned out looking nice and tasted great. And, more importantly,  the birthday boy enjoyed it!

Yup.  Delish.  I made it the day before a BBQ and left it in the fridge for probably 24 hours.  I was worried that it would be a big mush pile by the time I served it, but, it was perfect!

Everyone raved about this cake and it tasted like a restaurant version of tiramisu!  In making it, I misread "instant coffee powder" and thought it was coffee grounds.  As I mixed grounds into a tiny bit of water (as some suggested), I realized the coffee was supposed to be finer, so I just poured the liquid through a sifter and it was fine.  I doubled the coffee & liquour as others suggested and used coffee flavored vodka rather than liquour, which was all I had, but turned out to be great, as it actually came through a bit.  I wasn't sure why everyone subbed out the mascarpone cheese, as it was only $2.99 at my grocery store, only a dollar more than cream cheese - I was very glad I went with this as it gave it the spot-on flavor.  I had excess whipping cream frosting (cake only needed about 2/3s of what I made), but I set it out for others to add on to their piece of cake if they desired.  I followed the advice of others and froze my 3 layers before stacking and that made it easy.  Fantastic recipe!

I doubled the amount of filling to make  a more tasty   cake.  Used 3 cups of heavy whipping cream for frosting but will do 4 cups for next cake so thicker  frosting on side.  Everyone wants a bit more coffee in filling and frosting so will increase that as well.     Divine cake worth every penny for the mascapone

Definitely not easy, but simple enough for me. (Not a professional) It was so delicious and I still get lots of compliments on it! I doubled the recipe and made two large, two layer sheet cakes for my mother-in-law's Italian themed birthday party. It was perfect.

I wish I could give this 6 stars! This cake was amazing!! I did take the advice of others and did 2 layers of coffee and one white and I think it made it better. Good advice on those that said to be careful when whipping the cream for the icing - It was perfect for me since I have made this kind of icing before, but yes, if you beat it too long it will be a mess. This cake was a big hit and how can you possibly go wrong with a boozy, coffee flavored, not too sweet delicious cake? I will make this again..and again..GREAT recipe and not too difficult to make! Thank you!

I just baked this cake for the third time since first finding this recipe. The first time and 3rd time it turned out amazing. The second time I made it, the filling was runny as many others have stated. I read the reviews and realized that happens when mixed it for too long.  Today I was careful to only mix until the ingredients were blended and not a second longer and it worked great. I don't think you could find a more moist cake. I would give it 10 stars if I could.

Elegant and delicious!  I have made this cake twice and everyone loved it both times.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I was a bit concerned about how long the frosting would hold up but found that it will last for at least 2 days when refrigerated.

I added more powdered sugar to all layers plus vanilla sugar to the whipped cream.  I used a pre-made star sponge cake.  I used the amount of liquid to brush the cake but easily could've doubled it for more moisture.  I'll make it again but be a bit braver.  it was one of the most delicious cakes I've ever made!

i converted the recipe to gluten free and used baileys liquor.  it was amazing! i found a recipe for lady fingers, converted to gluten free, and poured the batter into a muffin pan which created the perfect shape and size to stack.

I made it for my husband's 65th birthday party.  I doubled the recipe and added cognac.  I baked the cake in 11.75" X 9.375" pans.  Tiramisu is my favorite dessert when we dine out at finer restaurants. The cake I made tasted better than any tiramisu I have ever tasted.   This was a superb recipe to work with.

My sister in law is gluten free so I used boxed gluten free cake mix which I made the day before. The gluten free cake tends to get "stale" faster than regular cake which was a plus when adding the coffee mixture. (I added to all 3 layers) Also, I have been making tiramisu for years and I always  fold the mascarpone and whipped cream mixture together.  I find the mascarpone mixture to be heavy and difficult to spread.  I made for Xmas this year and my family went crazy for it!

Another 5 star review for this great cake!!!  My wife and guests were unanimous in their praise, with two stating it was the "best Tiramisu they had ever tasted"!  As usual, I made a few changes , as suggested by other reviewers.  I ended up using a total of 11 tbsp of Kahlua and espresso instead of the coffee.  After adding instant coffee to the one layer, it wasn't dark enough, so I added about a 1/2 tsp of cocoa.  Pretty much doubled the filling and icing parts and used most of it.  I was worried dripping the coffe mixture on the cake would make it too wet, but it was perfect!   According to my guests, I will have to make it again!  Thanks to all reviewers!

This cake was DELICIOUS. Not too sweet. Definitely not enough espresso poured over the cake. I will double it to 1/2 cup next time and update my review. I will up the instant coffee powder to 3T next time also but  it has to be mixed better into the batter-no clumps of coffee powder. I left the frosting and filling as is (no extra expresso or kahlua) because I didn't want it to be runny. Next time will will pour kahlua over one of the cake layers along with the espresso. Very muc h a crowd pleaser and I loved it because it was not sweet. Will definitely make again.

Instead of coffee liquer, I use hazelnut creamer mixed with a small amount of coffee.  This is the best cake I've ever made.  My step dad begs for me to bring it for every occassion......He would eat the whole cake in one sitting if we'd let him.  ha ha

LOVED this cake! My entire family was raving about it. Had to be careful in assembling it, but the topping and filling were lovely and it came out very well. Will make it again for sure!

We made this for my birthday party, so we made this with a gluten free cake mix, and in a 9x13 pan, so we ended up just doubling the recipe for the filling, and only cutting into two layers instead of three.  I would recommend more espresso + coffee liqueur, because it's delicious, and the recipe seemed a little light on that coffee flavor.  But other than that, it was DELICIOUS!!!  In fact , I'm making it again for my mother's birthday this weekend.  :)  It was gobbled up too quickly to get a photo last time, I'll try to snap one this time, and make a true round layer cake, rather than a sheet pan.

Delicious and Easy. I used whipped topping instead of whipped cream because I was serving a ladies luncheon and needed to be sure it would hold up.  Didn't add sugar to the topping, but did add Kahlua. This was so good and held up well.

Oh, my!  Made this to go with my husband's birthday meal.   Homemade lasagna, homemade rosemary bread, salad, and this year I decided to make this cake.  He said it's one of the best cakes he's ever had.  ~~ I only had 2 glass round cake pans.  Decided I'd go ahead and buy a third.  The store didn't have any glass round cake pans.  So I ended up buying the cheapest metal ones (less than $1 each), and hoped it would be okay.  Turned out just fine.  I'm not much of a cake maker, so it felt a bit tedious, but it was definitely worthwhile.  Shared some with a good friend, because we won't be able to eat the whole thing.  The girls (~13 years old) had different reactions.  One who doesn't like coffee didn't care for it.  One thought the liquer gave it a weird taste, but still ate it.  My daughter enjoyed it.  All the adults REALLY  liked it.  ~~ This won't be a cake I make on a whim just because.  BUT it is a cake I'll make for a special occasion.  Thanks so much for sharing this excellent recipe -- perfect ending for my husband's birthday meal!

OMG.... I LOVED this cake! My family is having a friendly "cake-off" competition this summer and this was my entry. Let's just say, I'm feeling confident! ;-)  

To get my bonus points, I did use a from-scratch white cake recipe (Heavenly White Cake, from this site), rather than boxed. I made a 1 1/2 batch, just to be sure I'd have enough cake and I figured if each layer was a bit thicker, that was fine by me. I used 3 nine-inch cake pans and the thickness was perfect. 

Additionally, like many other reviewers recommended, I added extra coffee liquor whenever called for (except the frosting, I left that as-is w/ 2 Tbsp), doubled the brewed coffee mixture, and doubled the instant coffee added to the cake layers. Yes, I left one layer plain/white and I made two "coffee" by adding instant coffee. I did not need to dilute the instant coffee in water as another reveiwer said. I simply folded the granules in until well incorporated. This worked great for me! 

For the filling, I used the mascarpone cheese. It's very reasonable at Trader Joe's and I felt it was best to stay true to the recipe here. (This filling was fantastic!)

Once my cakes were baked & cooled, plus my filling & frosting were made, assembly was quite easy & fun. The frosting spread so nicely. I finished off the presentation with chocolate covered espressso beans. 

This was a cake I will most definitely make again! The whole family loved it! :)

Yum, yum!  This was an amazing recipe!  I did read many of the reviews and this is what I found.  I used Duncan Hines cake mix.  I used the Mascarpone cheese not the substitute.  I 4X the amount of coffee powder and used espresso powder.  I used a cold brew concentrate coffee for the brewed coffee.  I doubled all of the liqueur except in the frosting because one reviewer said that could have led to problems with the frosting in the fat to liquid ratio.  I did add some coffee powder to the frosting instead of more liqueur.  I made 2 coffee layers and one white.  I followed one reviewer's suggestion to leave the cake in the pans ( I used disposable pans) and cool in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes, then poke holes in the cake, add your coffee mixture and put the cakes in the pans in the freezer for 20 minutes.  This worked really well during assembling.  The cakes came out of the pans easily and stacked well.  Thank you Bettina for an amazing easy recipe!!!!

Great tiramisu without all of the work. I followed the suggestion of others and doubled the coffee whenever called for and doubled the frosting  but had quite a bit left over. Coworkers  loved it.

This is a really good cake, easy to make also. I used 8 inch pans instead of of nine inch, because it made the cake taller and more attractive. I doubled the coffee (liquid instead of granules) added to the one cake layer and increased the amount of brewed coffee and coffee liqueur  mixture. After spreading the filling on each cake layer I dusted it with cocoa powder. I've had several people request this cake, and I plan to make it again.

I really like this cake; my husband loves Tiramisu and this cake filled the bill for him and was well received by guests.  Next time I will try substituting Mascapone as one reviewer suggested.

We really enjoyed this, but next time I make it I will make a few variations.  I will double (or even triple) the quantity of brewed coffee/coffee liqueur that gets poured over the layers - as is, the cake would suit non-coffee lovers just fine, but I'd like a richer coffee flavor next time.  In addition, I'd add 3 tsp, instead of 1, of instant coffee to the one layer, as I think this would also embolden the coffee flavor.

I made this cake for my wedding and it turned out so good. The guests enjoyed it so much, it was a hit. I would, however, say that there was not enough cake batter for 3 layers from just one cake mix, so before you make it, keep in mind that you may have to make three cake mixes in order to have a good amount of cake. Other than that, it was delicious and fun to make.

Really Great Recipe, My 6 year old granddaughter helped me make this for Mommy's Birthday cake. We did make some changes as we read the reviews and suggestions. Added  more  coffee and Kahlua to everything... The icing was a bit runny so I added some cream cheese to thicken, and kept it cool in the fridge before cutting.
 Finished off with ladyfingers dusted with cocoa powder around the edges and a chocolate cover strawberry on the top, So Pretty!  Got Raves!

I have made this cake several times for different occasions.  BIG hit!  Here are some tweaks that I have made each time: substitute for the mascarpone - 16oz spreadable cream cheese, 1/2 c heavy cream, 5 tbsp sour cream.  Super creamy and yummy. I also double the coffee flavored liqueur (each time it is listed).  For the frosting step, I have found that I should not mix ingredients for more than 4 minutes or they begin to separate/change textures.  Last tip - make several hours (or a day) in advance and make sure to keep refrigerated.

As a tiramisu CAKE, this was pretty good. The filling was what made it for sure. The second time around I made actual ladyfingers using a recipe from this site, and used the instant coffee in the filling, but made a strong espresso to soak the ladyfingers in. DELICIOUS!

This is an amazing recipe.  Easy to make and tastes delicious.  My whole family ate every last crumb of this cake.  For the icing:  it does take a little time to get the icing to the right consistency.  Make sure you continue to beat the icing until it becomes firm and makes peaks as you whip it.

This is a great and EASY recipe.  The kids as well as adults loved it.  
I  was asked to make another for a friend, instead of a traditional birthday cake, and at her request  substituted Devil's Food Chocolate for the vanilla cake.   She loved it and it received many compliments.   
My family has now decided that the chocolate "tiramisu" is our favorite.

The mascarpone and heavy cream flavoring was divine.  I thought once all all said and done that the cake itself was quite dry and not very flavorful.  I think this would have been a great recipe if it called for more of the coffee to soak the cake a bit more.  The areas where the coffee soaked into the cake tasted great but for the most part it was just cake and cream.

I doubled the flavorings, but even after standing overnight the cake's taste was mediocre.

This is so good, it'd be a shame to not give this a go. Delicious, mouth-watering and personally, I found this quite easy to make! I didn't opt for the cake mix. Instead, I made my own white cake from scratch, using my all-time favourite 'Simple White Cake' recipe from this site. I used the suggestions of the reviewers and made 2 of the cakes coffee (by adding a teaspoon or 2 of instant coffee into the cake batter) and I left the other one as is. 
I'd recommend being generous with the coffee-kahlua mix when pouring them over the cakes ... it does wonders to the flavour and keeps them moist. 
I made one amendment to the recipe for the whipped cream frosting ... I stabilised the frosting. Here's how - take about 1 tablespoon of gelatin and dissolve it in about 3-4 tablespoons of warm water. Mix well so that the gelatin is dissolved completely. As soft peaks start to form while whipping the cream, add the gelatin mix into it and keep whipping the cream until stiff. Once stabilised, the cream is a dream to work with and do lovely designs with. I left mine simple and dusted it with cocoa powder and coffee beans/cacao nibs! 
Ah yes, lastly, making this about 24 hours before serving is an excellent idea 'coz that gives the cake enough time to set. And ofcourse, be generous with the cream and filling ... 'coz that's where all the magic lies! 
Thank you for this recipe!

This cake was barely edible. I added extra coffee and followed the remainder of the recipe. To call this tiramisu is a stretch of the imagination.  This cake was very sweet and tasted nothing like real tiramisu.

I've made this cake at least 5 times now, and it always turns out great and So yummy! To make things easier, I always bake the cake in 2 pans, and I add the instant coffee to one of them. I put the filling between the 2 layers then cover with the frosting (using 2 layers only means a little less frosting, so 1 cup or 1 1/2 cups heavy cream is plenty). Thank you so much for this great recipe.

I loved the taste of it, especially the frosting.  Absolutely delicious and just like restaurant style and flavor!  I ate myself sick from it. :D The one thing I would not is that the doubling of the kahlua in the filling makes it runny, so that didn't work so well, but it absolutely did work for the icing and it tasted so subtle, it was great.  I am definitely going to try it again for another holiday get together.

Loved it! Added a little extra coffee liqueur,  and used a caramel flavored coffee, and along with the cocoa on top I sprinkled some of the instant coffee too. It was a huge hit with everyone! And it was very light, which I love.

The family didn't care for this.  They felt it tasted processed, something you would buy in the supermarket.  It may be the quality of the cake mix I used.

GREAT Taste, but still pretty putsy.  I have never made the original version with Lady Fingers, but I had a frustrating time with my 3 layers of white cake; the amount that baked up in the pans was approximately less than 2" high and very flimsy.... Lady Fingers are far more dense, so trying to get the cake out from the pans in one piece did NOT happen no matter how much I greased down the pans and floured them, per instructions.  I would skip the round pans, and just do square pans.  I think Tiramisu would be so much better if chefs would just focus on the TASTE not the goofy fancy ordeal it takes to make it.  If I made Tiramisu my way, it would be one cake layer and one cream layer, with chocolate shavings on top. I'm sure it would taste exactly the same, just have a slightly different texture compared to a multi-layered dessert...

I also doubled the liquor, stuck with 3 layers and it was amazing! Everyone loved it just be sure to chill for at least 3-4 hours if your going to travel with it because the whipped topping softens quickly.  Will definitely make again.

This is excellent made exactly as recipe states.  I'm no professional baker but I've made this twice with superb results!  I wouldn't change a thing.  And at least in my area, the mascarpone
cheese is no more expensive than the cost of adding up the ingredients of the so called substitute for it that some reviewers propose.  I don't think it needs anymore coffee flavor than what it has made as stated.  You want the perfect blend of coffee flavor along with the other flavors the cake imparts.  It's perfect as it is but... As the saying goes... Different strokes for different folks.  Enjoy!

It was delicious! As you're making it, and tasting the frostings, it seems like a lot of alcohol.  But by the time it is chilled and served, you can only distinguish the flavor! I made it for my mom's birthday and no one could get enough!

I made this for a friend's aunt for her 70th birthday party.  My friend said that everyone at the party asked who made the cake, they said "it was the most delicious cake they have ever tasted". Yum! I'm going to make it again today for mother's day tomorrow.  I followed another review that said to add more coffee liquor to everything :D

A good cake, but not "over the top" for me.  I thought it was quite time consuming to make.  I used 2 cake mixes as I prefer thick cake layers, not little skinny pancake like layers.  The filling was very runny but I believe that to be due to my error in mixing the filling ingredients.  My family said they loved the cake, but I think I will take the money and time to make actual tiramisu next time.

This recipe was very bland compared to traditional tiramisu. The cake ratio overpowered the rest of the flavors. It was still tasty, but was nothing like I was expecting.

Although I haven't tried it yet as a whole, the batter was very doughy for me, and the filling/frosting turned out to be extremely liquid, no matter how much I whisked it (it never became solid, so it's not overwisking). It's a rather difficult cake to make, overall, in my opinion, but this is my second attempt and I'm glad to say that it can be done with a bit of care. Maybe next time I'll look for another tirimasu recipie, but this one is a good one if you want to have a go at something slightly more challenging. Tastes good enough, but I would recommend doubling the coffee amount for everything – most parts turned out rather bland until I edited it.

I reviewed this before with vegan changes, and on making it again for Mother's day realized an error in my icing recipe: it should be 1/2 C each earth balance and shortening, not 1 C each. Sorry about that! It's an amazing cake.

I'm rating this as 3/5 stars because I have no idea if I did something wrong or if it was the recipe. Basically the filling was sloppy, the alcohol overwhelming, The frosting so so. Now I'm left with an expensive bottle of coffee liqueur and an extra thing of mascarpone cheese and it is all worthless.

Made this for my birthday today. I had hoped it would not be frustrating, but it turned out to be a little more work than I expected. I cut out the coffee liquer (since my toddler will be having a slice, and I didn't want to risk it since the filling and frosting aren't cooked). First, my complaints. I did use cream cheese instead of marscapone, because it wasn't available. It was very hard to 'fold' the frosting into the filling, perhaps I didn't beat the filling enough? Either way, the filling was not very easy to spread, I think next time I make this, I'll just add some of the cream and a little more sugar into the filling and then beat it at a high speed. The frosting, however, was AMAZING, it was so easy to spread, I just hope it sets in the fridge and doesn't dissolve. I did add some cream of tartar to the frosting, just a trick I learned about whipped cream. One the frosting sets, right before serving, I'm going to add the garnish. :3 The frosting and filling were delicious, I licked the bowl.

Five star based on taste. Delicious! Had some issues however. First cake I made fell apart, tried a different brand with 4 egg whites and was fine. Due to time restraints and only having yeti cake pans, I made in two layers only. My filling and frosting were more runny than I liked I think because of adding the extra Kahlua liked suggested so don't know what to do about that

Excellent.  Only Change was doubling up on the coffee in cake and in liquid. I tripled the kahlua and made 2 pans instead of three. One plain and cut in half for two layers. I had 3 slices and I hardly eat sweets but this is near the real thing of tarimisu   Whipped topping came out perfect just stick to the ingredient quantities don't change them or add additional liquid.

Great recipe! I didn't read the recipe correctly and added the liquor and coffee to 1/3 of the batter, and that portion split when I put in on cooling rack. The frosting helped to hide my mistake and the cake was scrumptios!!

I substituted mascarpone cheese for 2 blocks of soften cream cheese, with 1/2 cup heavy cream and 5 Tblsp sour cream.
I had extra ingredients, so i made a second cake, but with angel food cake. I got many compliments.
 I didn't use all the coffee like recipe said. And I would use two boxes of cake mix to make the cake layers thicker, then maybe i would use all the coffee listed in the recipe. 
 I would say this recipe is a easy and simple way to make Tiramisu. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe worked out very well, and it was quite simple to make. It was just dividing up the cake batter that got me confused, but that is about the only thing I can say that is partially negative. Overall, fantastic recipe!

This recipe ROCKS ! I have made it a couple times now and have gotten nothing but compliments. I was even was hired to bake some as Christmas presents. The only changes I made were I did not fold a portion of the whip cream mixture into the filling mixture (I got excited and started layering before I read that part lol) I also added not quite another 1/4 cup of confectioners sugar to the frosting as it was not quite sweet enough for my taste buds. Yet it still was not overpoweringly sweet. Thanks for sharing !

I made this as a birthday cake for my son, who had been trying to get me to make him Tiramisu for years. I never did because I had always heard it was difficult to make. Although this recipe wasn't super easy, it wasn't difficult either. I followed the recipe exactly as written, except that I doubled the liquor, "only" in the coffee, and used half Bailey's and half Kahlua there). I almost doubled the liquor everywhere because I read so many reviews that suggested this. However, I was glad I didn't when I tasted the final results. I thought it had the perfect balance as it was, I didn't want to taste the liquor...just wanted it as flavoring, and that is how it came out. This cake had a moist, delicious, and well-balanced flavor. My son said that it tasted like an "authentic" Tiramisu, he loved it...and so did everyone else! :)

If I could I'd give it 6 stars; this is one of the best desserts I've ever tasted!  It turned our fluffy and moist with the richest coffee flavor.  My guests were amazed.  I used a substitute recipe for mascarpone, since my local store doesn't carry it, and I added extra coffee for more punchy flavor.

I LOVE this cake. I have made it twice and both times it's been a hit. Letting it sit for a while in the fridge before serving is best so it can soak up all the flavors. Only thing I may have done to change it is to make it a little more boozy with a couple more tablespoons of Kahlua but really it's perfect as it is.

Delicious. My variations: (1) I omitted the third layer (didn't have any instant coffee/espresso powder on hand) and just did 2 white layers. (2) Instead of adding coffee liqueur to the frosting, I whipped the cream and sugar and then folded in the reserved filling. It tasted perfect as is and I thought adding more liqueur might have been overpowering. It was a hit with our friends and my very picky husband - everyone had seconds!

fabulous cake in spite of not being able to buy whipping cream in our town for the authentic frosting.  I used the imitation whipped cream frosting available on this web site, which was acceptable but not as good, especially when I added Kahlua to it and it separated slightly.  I will definitely make again when I can get to Morelia to buy the right cream.

This cake turned out delicious. I don't know what I did wrong with the frosting. I followed the recipe and it turned out really watery and just slopped on instead of spread. I tried freezes it to thicken it up and that didn't even work.

This cake received rave reviews.  I made it for Valentine's Day but then took the leftovers to a dinner party and it was just as well received the second time around.  My only real complain is the amount of incredients I had to buy the lengthy process needed to make the cake.  If you're a regular baker, this cake is probably no big deal, but it was my first cake, so it was a bit of a project.  As other reviewers mentioned, I also doubled up on the coffee cake layers and the coffee liquour mixture where called for.

I'm not a fan of Kahlua or overly liquor-ey tasting tiramisu - so I cut back on the coffee flavored liquer.  I shouldn't have!   I was also nervous with the soaked layers (I shouldn't have been), as well as the layer with with the coffee powder in it (again, I shouldn't have been).  Next time I will follow it exactly as written.  One other thing I did wrong - I didn't cover it when I put it in the fridge.  Big mistake!  This is definitely a 5 star recipe if you follow all the directions.

This cake is sinnfully delicious! It takes alot of time and is not the easiest to make but well worth it!.  The only thing I would change is to add a little addiional coffee to the filling as it was not as flavourful as I was hoping, but still a great recipe!

Well I ended up makin this into a Trifle bowl.  My Husband had one job take the cake out and flip it and it ended up crumbling.  But even so it was amazin!  I put a layer of the filling then cake then whipped topping all the way up and then garnished with chocolate covered coffee beans it was wonderful.  I did use more coffee and Kahlua and used the cream cheese recipe for the mana. cheese.  One of the best Tiramisu ever.  Im going to make it for my stepdad when I go home on leave and hes picky bout his Tiramisu! Hopefully next time I can make it into an actual cake! lol So thanks for the recipe!

This turned out Wonderfully although it might be the cake mix I used but the cake tasted slightly soggy... but i only used no name brand cake mix so who knows. The batter was also really hard to divide into three batters evenly. The cake it self in the end turned out almost perfect except that i ran out of lady fingers then three more fell of at the end when i was moving it but people totally thought that i bought the cake so I'm giving this recipe a 4 out of 5

This is a winner!  It's simple to make, very elegant and absolutely delicious.  You can also just dust the top with cocao powder if you the chocolate curl type (they always fall apart on me!)  My family asks for this time and again.

This needs a few more stars added to it!!! I was extremely skeptical about trying this as I am a baking hazard/disaster-just the night before I had burnt myself in a muffin-related-incident. This was for my bf's birthday and I wanted it to be GREAT...it so was.  It was amazingly delicious, light and decadent all at once. It was fun to make and looks all fancy like I'm the Cake Boss. I used Kahlua Cream something...and a little more generously than called for-everything still turned out PERFECT. I'm making it as a staff treat next week. Fabulosity.

this was GREAT.  on my first attempt the cake came out good, but i thought the cake layers were a little dry.  the next time i made it i put 1/4 cup of the coffee mixture in each layer.  it was FANTASTIC!  i brought this to my office each attempt and everyone agreed that w/ the extra coffee it was MUCH better.  i got so many compliments!  i have made it now 3 more times & its a hit!

This is a very nice cake.  I also doubled the coffee and liqueur .  Make sure you add a little more sugar to accomodate the extra liquid.  For the frosting I mixed it with the left over filling and some buttercream frosting I had with just a splash of the some of the coffee and liqueur that I had left over.  Yum!!!!  I toped it off with choc. covered strawberries.

This is an amazing cake it won first place at my company picnic. It is very easy to make. Instead of making 3 layers i divided the cake in half and made just 2. I used more coffee and liquer then the recipe called for and i also put a tsp of cocoa powder into my filling to give it more choclate flavor.

This cake is delicious. It's very easy to make and I love that you can use cake mix.  One thing I did wrong though, was over mixed the frosting. It came out a little thick and not so pretty. Otherwise, it was delicious.

This is my birthday cake request every year now!  Oh and I make the frosting with Cool Whip and a couple tablespoons of sifted coco powder mixed in.  It holds up better than whip cream.

I am not a big Tiramisu fan, so it was difficult for me to tell if this was a wonderful recipe.  However, it was the cake of choice for my sister's birthday.  Everyone raved that it was delicious.  So that was good enough for me.:)

This is a great cake. However, it does take some work.  I made this for a mixed group of people (coffee lovers and non coffee lovers) and I still got rave reviews.  I made a mistake while mixing up the cake and it still turned out well. (I added the coffee flavored liquer before the baking.) The trickiest part to this dessert is just watching while mixing the frosting---you want to be careful to mix it enough, but not too much.  I ended up beating it on med for about 6 mins. (Kitchen Aid mixer).  Overall, well worth the effort.

I loved this cake and so did everyone else.  I have made this cake twice and everyone always raves about it.  It's awesome!  I follow the recipe as is but I do use a little bit more of the coffee and Kaluah! I also make the whip topping the same day I present it.  For the first time, I added chocolate covered strawberries and chocolate chips on the outside.    Yummy!

OMG!!! This cake is awesome! I followed the directions exactly and it was wonderful. My husband says it tasted like a dessert you would get at a fancy restaurant. I would not substitute the cream cheese for the mascarpone cheese, it gives it a great flavor. The only thing I would change next time is to double the instant coffee in the cake. Also I didn't use a strong coffee to pour on the cake, whereas next time I will. But even without changing those two things it was still really really good. Thanks so much for sharing!!

Too bad there is no way to do **********!  Made this for a fundraiser so I could not taste it, but I watched everyone at the table who bought the dessert chow down, even the teeny little ladies!  Only comment is that it does take a lot of the day to make it, but well worth it.  My only change was to sneak in Heath Bar bits in between the layers and then on the top - that way you avoid having to shave the chocolate AND you get some crunch inside.

It was easy and yummy.  I made for refreshment after  my small group meeting.  Everybody enjoyed.  I made twice, one according to the recipe and the other with my own sponge cake from scratch.  Well, I like my sponge cake better.

I just love this cake.  I have made it several times, but the last time I substitued ricotta cheese for the marscapone and I thought it was even better.  You have to, however, use a very good quality ricotta cheese.  I buy the 3lb container from Sams Club called Biazzo and use 16 oz for the cake and save the rest for lasagna.

DELICIOUS!!!!!  Changes I made: I doubled the coffee liqueur, Doubled the Coffee mixture to spread over the three layers and doubled the filling. Next time I will not double the filling. When you add the frosting to the filling, there's plenty. I used Starbucks coffee liqueur. I used two 10" round cake pans, but the batter was barely enough so the layers are thin. Use smaller cake pans or double the batter.  THIS CAKE IS SOOOOO YUMMY! MMMmmmmmm!!

I have made this cake 3 times now and it has been a  big hit every time.. I added the mascarpone cheese to the frosting ingredind ents and used that for the  filling and the frosting.  For one of the layers, I once had to make a white cake from scratch. (Thanks to a very naughty puppy!!) This cake was much more  dense than the store bought brand. This seemed to hold the flavors of the cake together better and added a richer texture that I really liked enjoyed. This recipe is definately a keeper.

I made a full sheet for my daughter's 16th birthday.  This was amazing.  Flavor was very subtle. Had people telling me that if they died, they would be o.k. (first time I've heard that one) Next time I make it for myself (not a crowd), I'll use espresso and make it a little stronger. It was really over the top and so easy to make.

Excellent substitute for Tiramisu.   I went super easy and made entire cake in 9 x13 pan.   Mixed coffee & Kaluha into cake mix before baking and also added the coffee & Kaluha after cooled to soak in.   Followed suggestions and used 2 - 8oz cream cheeses with 1/2 cup whipping cream and 3 TBLS sour cream for the filling.   I still doubled the Kaluha every where else and this was not over powering.   Cake was beautiful with the dusting of cocoa powder and chocolate curls.  My guests loved it.

I didn't want to use separate cake pans for the layers. I figured I'd cut one cake into 3 layers. NOT so. Adding the instant coffee to the cake made it look ugly. Maybe I'd try it again, maybe.

This cake was amazing!  I made it for our Italian- themed supper club and everyone loved it (most people except the skinniest of skinnies had seconds!).  My husband was skeptical because he doesn't particularly like Tiramisu but even he loved it!

Absolutly wonderful and easy! I usually make a from scrath recipe and this was much easier! As previous reviews explain, some adjustements can be made. I prefer cake that isn't soaked in liquid so I did a version without the coffee poured on the cake layers. Here my version (somewhat taste  like the mokamisu cake at rocaberry's restaurant. 1) I use the french vanilla cake mix 2) in 2 of the 3 cake layers, i added 3 tsp of instant espresso powder per cake layer. 3) for the filling, i also substituted the mascarpone for 1 pack (250g) cream cheese, 1/2 cup heavy cream and 3 tbsp sour cream, blended those ingredients then combined the sugar and kaluah. 4)i double the kaluah (coffee liqueur) in the filling and the frosting. 5) when assembling, i put 1 layer coffe cake, half the cheese filling, then a layer of french vanilla, then the rest of cheese filling, one more layer of coffee cake. After frosting the cake, i dusted it with dark cacao powder and then garnished the sides and middle of top with white and dark chocolate curls. To make chocolate curl, just melt the chocolate and then put it in a rectangular pan (ex: bread loaf pan) and refrigerate until solid but not to cold. Take out block of chocolate from it. If it got to cold, microwave 10-15 sec at a time. Curls are done by running down accross it with cheese slicer or carrot peeler. If curls are not forming, it's still too cold.  At this point, the cake sort of tastes like a moka cake, but trust me, you'll enjoy!

This cake is a dream! I didn't think it was labor intensive, although that is relative. If you've ever made a cake from scratch..this is slightly easier (seeing as you don't make the cake itself from scratch). I didn't change a thing and it was perfect, not to sweet, light , and creamy...just like the real thing!

**I'm changing my rating to five stars after using butter cake mix instead of white, much easier to handle. Made two layers with coffee, one without.  So many compliments on this cake!**  A great cake!!!  The only reason it go four stars instead of five is because it does have a learning curve to the assembly process.  Using a white cake, per the recipe, means they are exceptionally tender so I had some breakage getting the cakes out of the pans.  I don't anticipate any problems next time and the cake is magnificent once made. A true crowd-pleaser in the taste department!

I have made this three times and it is as impressive as it is delicous - and I am not known for my cooking or baking skills.  Tastes even better the second day!

I actually was not saved a piece of this cake, so I am writing for others. It was rich but not too rich and fairly easy to make. Not to hard to decorate. Very unique. A+

Absolutely delicious! I made this for a Christmas dinner but will definitely be making it for other events as well. There were a few Italian guests in the mix that night and they said it was the best Tiramisu cake they ever had. Thank you for a great recipe!

I did as others suggested an had 3 layers - two with the coffee mixture poured onto them.  I had some Starbucks Via instant coffee and added one packet to the coffee batter instead of using the old-fashioned, less tasty instant coffee.  Also, I used Starbucks coffee and cream liqueurs - the cream was great in the filling and frosting and coffee was great in the cake.  This cake was an amazing hit!  Definitely impressed!!

WOW this cake was amazing! I made it for my boyfriend as an end to our new years dinner. He was very impressed because it looks so fancy and difficult to make(i fooled him)..... as far as things i would do differently 1) add more Kaluaha 2)add more coffee to the cake 3) learn how to make chocolate curls because they looked more like chocolate flakes:( Also this was the first cake i had ever made and boy was it fun!!! i will for sure make this again

Delicious, light but rich and 'fluffy'.  I too increased the liqueur amount and I added a splash of creme de cacao to both the coffee mixture and filling.  I will say this, I don't know if marscarpone is supposed to have a distinct flavor or if I got a questionable  batch because personally I found it had an after taste in the filling so I added an ounce of cream cheese to the filling and it worked great.  I think I will use the substitute marscarpone cheese recipe next time.  I also made two of the layers with coffee instead of just one.  Dust with cocoa and top with chocolate curls.  So easy. So yummy.  My family raved.

Seriously, this cake is incredible.  Next time I will use two boxes of cake mix (I used vanilla) and increase the other ingredients appropriately.  I like a tall cake, and one box for three layers was cutting it close.  I doubled the coffee liquor pretty much everywhere,and I also did two layers with coffee and only one layer of vanilla.  The filling was incredible.  The flavors are perfect.  Thank you for this recipe!

Awesome recipe!!  I couldn't find marscapone so I substituted 8 oz cream cheese (softened), 1/4 cup heavy cream and 2 Tbsp softened butter.  It turned out wonderful and everyone wanted the recipe!

This rating is based on origional recipe. I guess my expectations were very high after reading all the ratings on this cake. The flavor was too subtle in my opinion, especially being a Tiramisu lover. In my opinion it was labor intensive and would be easier to make a traditional Tiramisu with ladyfingers. I used Kahlua for my coffee liqueur and instant expresso. I only used a pint of heavy cream and it was enough to frost the entire cake. For the price of Marscapone cheese I felt it didn't make an impact from the outer whipped cream frosting. My guests felt the same that it was good but not outstanding. I would have to agree with others and say if you want to try this recipe definately double up on all the coffee and liqueur. I think I will try it again and double up on all the flavors and then it would might be 5 stars.

This is really good!  This was the first dessert to go on Christmas day.  Everyone loved it! I did not have mascarpone cheese, so I used a substitute I found on this site.  It looked good and tasted great!  This is a keeper!

This was a HUGE hit at christmas this year. The folks that enjoy the coffee flavor really really loved it. I didn't use all of the brewed coffee/liquer mixture b/c I was afraid it would make the cake too soggy. So I think there was a more sublte flavor to the whole cake.  I think if more people were fans of coffee, I wouldn't have had any of the cake left over.  Although I probably won't make this again unless it's requested... I do thank you for sharing it! :)

EDIT: So it keeps getting requested by my husband's uncle so I made it again. Not sure what went wrong but the mascarpone filling was EXTREMELY runny. I used some of it, but it literally was running off the cake. I also made 2 of the layers w/ the instant coffee instead of just the one.
So yeah, it still tastes great, but the filling... not sure what went wrong there.

This cake is delicious!!!!  Made it for Christmas and everyone loved it.  I will definitely make this again.  Made the cake the night before and then assembled it in the morning and refrigerated it all day.  It turned out to be the best dessert I have ever made.

I think this could have been great, but I overdid it on both the coffee and the rum. Maybe I should have stuck to the recipe better. Next time I will still put extra coffee in the cake, but I will stick to the normal amount of coffee and alcohol throughout the rest of the recipe.

This recipe is OUTSTANDING!!  I even had non dessert eaters loving it!  I have to say, that while making it I was a bit worried, but the end result was WOW!  I used Kahlua for my coffee flavored liquor and I did reduce the cooking time on my 3 layers to about 15 to 18 minutes.  I had a lot of frosting, so I piled it on the top of the cake and it looked outstanding and tasted even better.

This was a wonderful, although time consuming, cake! I used three layers. I'm surprised I had enough frosting and filling because I couldn't keep my hands out of the bowls! lol.   This cake got rave reviews at our office party. A sure winner, but make sure to make the night before. This cake was twice as stable (for transport) once refrigerated overnight.   I will definitely be making this cake again and again and again. I'll bet there will be requests for it at our next office party, lol!

I made this for a large birthday crowd as a second cake, for the adults, and it was a huge hit. I doubled the recipe and made a double layer 13 x9 cake.  It is very light and at the same time rich without being too sweet. Everyone loved it. I had to take it in a car, so if you travel far with it put it in a cooler with a cool pack.

This turned out so good.  I made it two layers instead of 3, adding the instant coffee to one layer.  I also forgot to pour the liquor/coffee mix on the cake layers.  It tasted great and looked so pretty.  I am impressed and will be making this again (soon I hope)

this was my first time to ever bake anything this fancy.  I do a lot of cooking but just now starting to try baking.  The only problem I had with this cake was that my layers were sliding off one another.  I think next time (which there will for sure be a next time) I will freeze the cake layers before stacking.  My hubby is italian and has been begging me for years to make this.  He LOVED it and so did his Italian grandpa!!! thanks for such an amazing recipe!!

I made this for my husband's birthday, and he loved it.  I made my own white cake, instead of using a boxed mix (we don't do packaged stuff), and had to make my own mascarpone because I couldn't find any in my area.  The results were great, though.  Even over the next few days, as it got soggier and soggier in the refrigerator, it just got better and better!  ;)

I was so proud of this cake when I made it. It looked gorgeous and tasted amazing. All the different layers looked beautiful! I will definitely be making this again. Next time I will try making two coffee layers instead of one and will double the amount of coffee/liquer mix that's poured on the cakes.

I love this recipe.  Not only is it easy (and yummy!!!), but it is very versatile.  I have customized it on numerous occassions depending on the croud I was serving (I've decreased the kahlua, I've decreased the coffee, I have even decreased the amount of icing).  No matter who you are serving, this recipe can work for you!!

I have made this cake twice so far. Te first time I made it following the recipe as is. the second time, I don't know what I did wrong but the frosting seemed to runny but tasted fine so I put it in a triffle dish. not only did it lok pretty but tasted yummy. This is hoe I am making it again mistake or not. it was just easier to put together and my guests loved it!

Fantastic! Made two coffee cake layers and doubled the liquor (I used kahlua).  I think I may have underwhipped the cream-- it was a bit soft-- but once chilled in the fridge it was wonderful. SO GOOD!!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE! I have made it for myself and boyfriend quite a few times and we both love it. I told a friend about it and she kept asking for the recipe. Her birthday was last night and i surpirised her with it. it was the hit of the party. everyone loved it. we also made cup cakes incase someone didnt like tiramisu, no one ate them. i couldnt believe it! I didnt change a thing. next time i think i will  pour more coffe over the cakes though.

Awesome cake.  I made this for my Tiramisu-loving husband for father's day.  He NEVER gives 5 stars, but said this one is 4 3/4 - restaurant quality!!  (The best he has ever given.)  I doubled the Kahlua and coffee as others suggested, and I am glad I did. Next time I might make two layers of the coffee flavored cake, but this cake is really perfect as is!

The cake was moist and delicious!  I followed advice of others and made two layers with the instant coffee.  I increased the amount of coffee about 4x until the batter had the color and flavor I was aiming for.  I also forgot to mix in part of the frosting with the mascarpone mixture, so the frosting between layers wasn't too thick, but was still complimented by others.  I only had semisweet chocolate chips for the garnish, so I shaved them with a cheese grater, which didn't look as pretty as larger curls, but added some nice texture and flavor to the frosting.  Will make again!

This cake was wonderful!  Especially for those who love coffee.  4 stars because the recipe is excellent but I changed a few things, some of which I would do again (doubled instant coffee granules and added to two of the cakes instead of one, made coffee extra strong, doubled coffee liqueur for the cake and for the filling) and some of which I would not do again (doubled coffee liqueur for frosting-will only 1 1/2 it next time as I thought it was too liqueur-flavored).  The recipe is great though and can easily be adjusted to the taste of the maker, which is great!

Superb! rendition of the classic taste; used pound cake recipe instead of a box cake mix.  Definitely make it at least a day ahead for maximum effect and flavor.  Everyone devoured the cake.  I did double the coffee and liqueur for all applications.

Made this for a dinner party with my favorite "foodies"  They all raved that it was the best dessert they have had!  I also made two of the three layers with the espresso, as I love the coffee flavor.  Amazing!

This cake was super easy to make and tasted just like a regular Tiramisu.  I was very thankful that the recipe was broken down into the parts (cake, filling, frosting, etc.).  It made the recipe so easy to follow.  I wish more recipes would do that to take out the guessing game. Thank you for doing that.  The cake was a big hit at our family Easter dinner.

This cake was absolutely beautiful and it tasted as good as it looked! I doubled the coffee/coffee flavored liqueur and made two coffee layers and one white layer. The cake was very moist. It got great reviews from my dinner guests! Definitely a keeper!

Cake tasted good but I guess my expectation was too high after reading all these high-ratings.  I don't think it worth paying extra $$ for mascapone cheese.  I would substitute it w/ regular cream cheese next time though.

Very forgiving recipe, for I really bumbled through it and it turned out great anyway!  Used what I THOUGHT was instant espresso in the cake, but it wasn't.  We ended up having coffee grounds in the first layer, but it was good anyway (nobody knew!).

This recipe is amazing!!! I think my boyfriend and I ate it all in one night and we were both licking our plates afterwards.  I didn't have any liqueur available, so I supposed the amount of liqueur required with coffee mixed with instant coffee and it worked wonders.  I was a little confused about the layering of the marscapone mixture, but it still tasted delicious and looked beautiful.  Thanks to the poster of this recipe.

I thought this cake was very good, but not AWESOME...My filling was a little runny, but that was ok, cause it pretty much 'set up' over night in the fridge.  The frosting was awesome and 'made' the cake.  Truthfully I will probably not make this again, just because for all the time and steps invested I can make "Classic Tiramisu" which IS AWESOME in my opinion, and that's the taste we're wanting after all, right?

This was amazing. It wasn't that easy to make, but the results were worth it. Instead of having two white cakes, I added about a fourth cup of cocoa butter to 1/3 the white cake recipe ( http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Simple-White-Cake/Detail.aspx ) as well as dark chocolate chips.  In the next 1/3 i added 1/4 cup white chocolate chips, although I believe I could have added more. To the final 1/3 I added about a 1/3-1/2 cup of extremely dark coffee. Instead of marscapone cheese I used yogurt, as I don't have cream cheese, as well as a bit of whipped cream, which I had more than enough.  My family loved it and licked their plates. This is definetly a recipe to remember.  BTW, I'm 14, so if I can do it, so can you!

This cake is absolutely perfect!  I marbled the cake layers instead of having the two colours separate, and it looked beautiful.   Thanks for such a great recipe!

I found this recipe and made it right away! And wow! I had been afraid to try any Tiramisu recipe as I am just starting to bake, but this seemed pretty simple. My family devoured it! There was one slice left at 11pm and when I went to get it at 2am, it was gone! Thanks. This is definately a winner!

I made this for my mother in law's birthday and it was the biggest hit out of any of my cakes. This is definitely my new special occasion cake.  It is the perfect combo of cake and tiramisu flavors and I like how it is much lighter than a traditional tiramisu.

this is one of my favorite (as well as my families) recipes!!! The only changes I make are making into a two layer cake using cheesecake pans & using the coffee mixture on both & depending on the crowd is whether I use more or less kahlua...this is so light tasting & delicious it's always a crowd pleaser.

my cake was a little dry.  Would definately make more of the marscapone filling next time.  Followed recommendations to add more coffee to make 2 layers coffee and one without.  It was impressive to my dinner guests.

I made this for my friend's birthday, and it was delicious!!  However maybe I went wrong somewhere- but my filling and frosting just kind of kept going everywhere! It even dripped on the table! So I kept it in the freezer. it was almost like an ice cream cake. If I had known it was going to be like that, I wouldn't have made it in December. This definitely isn't a cake that you can take to church and leave out on a table for an hour. or something. And next time I think I'm just going to use coolwhip instead of making the frosting because that's basically what it tasted like and maybe coolwhip wouldn't melt so much.  Despite all this, the cake is actually very, very very tasty. Next time I'm gonna use more Kahlua and forget the coffee!

This cake was AWESOME!! I made if for a dinner party and everyone said it tasted like it came from a bakery. Even my friend that is famous for her desserts actually asked ME for the receipe! As suggested I made two coffee layers and one white and added a little more Kalua to the filling and frosting. I also made a substitue Mascarpone cheese from a recipe I found on this website. I didn't have 9 inch cake pans so I used 8 inch and the cake must have been a foot high! Very impressive. I will definitly make this again.

OMG.  This cake was a bit of work but totally worth it.  I am generally an awful baker, but this turned out to be bakery-quality!  

I topped the cake with lots of whipped cream, chocolate shavings, and cookie crumbs.

Absolutely fabulous.  I have grown up on this dessert and it was amazing.  Google a mascarpone substitute and you can't go wrong.  I made it for my husband's office party, first time ever, and they devoures it and didn't touch anyone else's desserts.

I'd rather have this cake than regular tiramisu anyway! SO delicious and the presentation is beautiful!
I add more liquid as calls for when you pour into the holes on cake! My husband wanted a stronger coffee flavor! Its always a hit!

Really amazing. The only thing I would change is that the 1/4 a cup of coffee really isn't enough, I'll be changing that to a 1/2 cup next time.

Incredible!  Everyone enjoyed and came back for seconds.  I followed instructions to a "T" except that I doubled all the coffee liquer amounts.

Great recipe - moist and delicious like Tiramisu!  I sometimes tripled or quadrupled the Kahlua in the recipe. I also used the recommendation of cream cheese/sour cream combination in place of the mascarpone (was all out at Trader Joes!!) - I'm glad I did because it was tasty!  I didn't add Kahlua to the icing but added in a little instant coffee and it whipped up perfectly.  I will make this again in a heartbeat!

Definitely a keeper! I've made this twice. I followed the other reviewers and made it with double liqueur everywhere it's called for.  The second time I made it I made it into a trifle and it was FABULOUS! Cut the cake into small pieces, then layered the topping and filling. So so good. My very picky pastor asked me to make it again. YAY!

Awesome! Awesome! I made this a little differently from the original recipe. I used a Starbucks Mocha drink (the kind you buy at the supermarket) and drizzled that along with Godiva Chocolate Liqueur on the cakes. I crushed 3 heath bars and sprinkled the crumbs inbetween the layers for a little crunch. I also used a mascarpone imitation recipe since I can NEVER find mascarpone anywhere. It was 2 pkgs of cream cheese, 5 T sour cream and 1/2 c of heavy whipping cream. It was so so so good!

Tiramisu is my favorite dessert, so I couldn't wait to try this!  I made this cake along with a lot of other desserts for a dessert party 2 weeks ago for a very picky audience--family!  Everyone that tried it loved it.  The only thing I would recommend is to increase the coffee/liquor amount, and also there was way more filling than necessary [coming from someone who usually doubles the filling &/or frosting recipes...].  I can't wait for a good reason to make this again!!

This is fabulous!  I made this for a small group of my friends and it was a hit!  It's a great recipe for Tiramisu because the ingredients aren't as expensive as for other recipes I've tried.  I used the technique describes by Jean Marie and posted October 3, 08.  Making one coffee layer and one white and then slicing them horizontally.  The result was beautiful and I had plenty of filling to do it.  In fact be generous with the filling because I had some left over.

Loved this recipe!!  I made it for my mom's birthday (who loves tiramisu) and everyone loved it.

I did follow some advice from posters.  I tripled the amount of coffee (and I used instant coffee intead of brewed).  I also doubled the amount of Kahlua.  I also used Duncan Hines Moist White Cake Mix and it was very light and moist.  I made 2 coffee layers and only one white one and made it all in three 8" pans b/c I only had 2 9" pans to use.

I could not make chocolate curls at all so it came out more like cocoa on top.  Not sure how you're supposed to make chocolate curls with a vegetable peeler.  I couldn't figure it out but it didn't effect the taste.  Very light and had the same taste and texture as real tiramisu. :)  A definite keeper!

This tasted much better the second day.  I also doubled the amount of coffee liqour in the recipe.  My guests really enjoyed it, I wasn't as impressed.  I couldn't find the cheese needed in our small town so I used the substiution I found.

This cake was really enjoyed by my family and guests. Presentation was Bakery quality and not too difficult to make. I used French Vanilla Kahluha and Peet's Major Dickason's Blend coffee. WOW! What a flavor together! I doubled the main flavors and made chocolate whipped cream (from what remained after frosting the cake of the regular frosting). I used the chocolate whipped cream in a pastry bag with a large star tip and decorated the top of the cake as well as along the bottom. I shaved the best 60% bittersweet chocolate I could find on the top of the cake and chilled it for a full day before serving it. To my surprise it was even better after the third day (family couldn't finish it because it is quite rich and they wanted it for breakfast with MORE coffee:). I will make this again, but double the filling as it is sooo good. Very impressive recipe, and as the flavors had more time to blend I swear the "boxed cake" taste was not detectable. It was a little more expensive to make, but beats the heck out of most cakes you can buy. One final note, some of my guests actually said they enjoyed the cake more than real Tiramisu because they liked having the  traditional flavor without raw eggs in the recipe. This cake is definately worth the time to make!

This was a wonderful cake. I had to substitute the mascarpone cheese with cream cheese this time because I live 20 minutes away from a grocery store. It was a hit. Next time time I will plan ahead and buy some macarpone cheese. This is actually going to be the dessert I take this year to Thanksgiving with my family. Thanks so much

This was sooo good. I made this for my stepdad's birthday and everyone agreed that it was better than the one that our local bakery made for his last birthday. I didn't have round cake pans so I used bread loaf pans and cut the cakes in half horizontally so I had 4 layers instead of 2. Like a lot of other reviewers I tripled the amount of coffee and Kahlua. Turned out great!  I'm planning on making this again for Thanksgiving.

Made this cake for a party last night and friends have already asked me to make for the Christmas party.  As suggested by other reviewers, I added more Kahlua and also did 2 coffee layers.  The filling was "out of this world".  I made the cake layers the day before the party and then assembled it the day of.  This took away the stress of doing everything all at once.  I would say this cake is difficult because of the box cake.  The filling & icing come together quickly too.

I made this cake a couple of years ago for my daughter's 17th birthday and now it has become "The Birthday Cake" for both of my children. I use more expresso and also use coffee syrup flavoring.
Want to update this rating. The last couple of  times I made this it has fallen apart. The reason for this is the layers were not level. Be sure to trim off the top of the cakes if they do not bake flat. With all the fillings you all a lot of moisture to the cake and it  will fall apart if it the cake surface is not flat. Next time I make the cake I will be sure to take care of this. I still highly recommend this recipe. Yummy!

This cake was awesome!  My husband made it with no help from me and it turned out great!  He made all the layers with the coffee and added extra as well.  I would reccomend adding extra coffee and coffee flavored liqueur where it's called for.

Awesome Tiramisu! I always at least tripe the coffee and liquor mixture to soften the layers and it just doesn't seem like the amount in the recipe is enough. This recipe is a staple for every party we attend and worth the amouont of time it takes! Thank you!

We were having an Italian themed potluck at work and I was my assigned dish was Tiramisu. I had absolutely no idea what Tiramisu was. So I ended up on this site, picked this recipe, and it was a huge success! It took me a little bit longer than what was stated. But guess what dish I'm asked to make for every get together now! This GREAT cake!

oh my gosh! This is awesome. I cant believe that I made this (And neither can my husband :)) I followed some of the reviewers suggestions and doubled the coffe and kahlua. I made all 3 layers with some coffee. I saw some people had trouble with the frosting. My suggestion is to keep mixing even after you think its "Stiff" It thickens up! Thanks for this recipe! Im going to make it next weekend for fathers day!

I am  completely novice baker (I'm a university student) but my friends and I decided to have a cooking day and I made dessert.  This took me a VERY long time to make but in the end it was totally worth it.  I made 2 layers instead of 3 (I only had one pan so to make 3 separate cakes was too much) and it still turned out tasty!  The cakes rose in the middle, making it hard to stack them but overall everyone went nuts for this recipe! Absolutely delicious and well worth the effort!

I made this for a teacher's luncheon, and there was not a drop left.  The ladies LOVED it.  They said they felt like they were being treated to gourmet dessert treat.  I could not believe how easy it was to make!  Thanks for the great recipe!

What an exquisite cake!  I would rather have this cake anyday over traditional tiramisu.  I agree with other reviewers to add more kahlua and coffee.  However,  I will always use mascarpone cheese, you just can't replace it.

I made this for a dinner party and it was wonderful.  I only had two round cake pans so I only made two layers but it didn't matter.  There was a good balance between the flavors and not too much of any one flavor.  Very attractive and very tasty!

I was in a hurry when I made this recipe and screwed up. I mixed the instant coffee & liquer in the cake mix and had nothing to pour over cake. Made it any way and it was soooo good the filling and frosting were so good. Sure went in a hurry. Will try this again the right way, but the way it came out "messed up" was good enough.

WOW is all I can say. I made this for the first time last night. And it was AMAZING!! I took a couple suggestions, I used more coffee all over and liqueur, made two coffee cakes and 1 vanilla. It turned out delicious! Brought some into work for the girls to try and they love it.

Lovely,not-to-sweet dessert.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the flavoring.  For anyone having trouble getting their cream to whip and thicken, make sure you are NOT using "ultra pasteurized" heavy cream. It will not thicken when whipped.  I learned the hard way several years ago.

Used french vanilla cake mix. Baked this twice. The first time, I doubled both the liquor and coffee and found the extra Kahlua overwhelming. Used the frosting recipe but couldn't get it stiff. Added more confectioner's sugar but consequently, the frosting was way too sweet.  So for the second tiramisu, I only doubled the coffee and used the delicious filling for the frosting instead. Topped with cocoa powder and chocolate curls.

I made this with the suggestions of adding extra coffie layer and increasing the coffie in each part and to tell the truth my husband and I didn't like it much at all. But we must not know much because I took it to a party and everyone seemed to love it and ate it up.  So I gave it 4 stars even though i wasn't hot on it.  But it does look great!

I would give this a million stars if I could.  It was delicious and people just raved!!!!!  I have already been asked to make it for another party.  The only change I made was I doubled the coffee like others mentioned.

Loved the frosting- did as people suggested and doubled the coffee and liquor. Not sure what I did wrong though as the coffee layer of the cake didn't seem cooked right. It came out clean with a toothpick but when I cut through it to serve it- it did not look done..?? It still tasted okay though and nobody fell ill. Not sure what I did wrong??

This cake was fantastic- the frosting was phenomenal!! I could literally sit and eat that alone- I won't though...maybe.  My husband suggested adding more instant coffee powder to all three layers and pouring more prepared coffee/kaluha mix over each layer to add moisture.  He said it was very very good as is, though.  Thanks for this one!!!!

Delicious!  I used an almond cake, baked in two pans (two thirds almond, one third with the coffee flavour).  Next time, I think I'll add a bit more coffee and liqueur.

I hate Tiramisu Cake but I made this for a friend's birthday and she loved it!  I tried some aswell and determined that it was pretty good.  I don't like the idea of using a cheese in a dessert.  It is a ton of work but I honestly think it's worth it.  I will probably make this cake again.

On taste, this recipe is 5 stars - if you double the liquor and coffee, it tastes professionially made.  The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I have never been able to successfully make the whipped frosting - it always turns out grainy and noy fluffy, even though I follow the directions to the T.  I've tried 3 times now, but each time, have had to resort to buying Cool Whip from my grocer.

Pretty good for a cake mix cake! Everyone liked it. I needed only half of the amount of whipping cream. I would add more coffee and/or liqueur next time.

Wow! Golly gee Batman! I used this recipe for 70 people at my AMVETS dinner this evening, and what a success it was! Everyone simply raved about it, I would give it a 10 if you had that rating available. I also doubled up on the coffee liquer with great results.

Excellent cake. Very moist and just the right amount of coffee flavoring. I made a few minor adjustments to the recipe-I doubled the amount of coffee and coffee liquor for the cake and I doubled the filling recipe-I used one 8 oz regular flavored marscapone and one 8 oz coffee flavored marscapone. I kept the amount of the confectionary sugar to 1/4 cup. I also doubled the instant coffee in the batter. Very balanced flavor-not overwhelming. Would definately make again

This was such a huge hit this christmas! I love this recipe but I listened to the other reviews and listened to their suggestions of making two layers of the cake with instant coffee mixed into it. I also didn't use that much frosting because it got pretty messy and I don't like things to be too sweet and it was still really great. The cake is really moist and the coffee taste is very subtle.

This cake is really good.  I dont think that there is really a way to mess it up and not be a hit, because the first try I did mess up big time.  For the coffee layer, instead of putting a tbs of instant coffee I put in 1/4 cup of instant coffe.  I freaked out after I realized it, long story short I made a new coffe layer for cake #1 for work which was gone in a flash, that night my family was begging for a cake for them as well, so I had my extra baked cake and my mess up coffe layer.  I sliced the coffee layer in 2 and put it in between the other two white cake layers, followed the instructions to a tee and whalla it was a hit again.  Even my little niece and nephews like the coffee taste and they want me to bake another one for the next family gathering.

I added double the instant coffee to middle layer.  Used only about 1/4 the amount of whipped cream.  I used only 2 pans and cut the white layer in half.  DELICIOUS.

This tiramisu was FABULOUS. It tasted just like the stuff from a good Italian restaurant. The only addition I would make next time would be to add more coffee/kahlua on top of each layer.

I tried this recipe because I love Tiramisu.  This cake is fairly easy and tastes like the real thing.  I got complements on the look as well as the taste.
The only thing I did differenly was to use marscapone already infused with coffee.  It was sold right next to the regular tub of marscapone.

This is the best recipe I have ever tried from the internet!!! I couldn't find the right cheese so I just used ricotta in it's place, and it still tasted great. Even people that don't like coffee LOVED this cake.

I tried this recipe for my mom and my boyfriends' birthday twice and i was AMAZING!!!  Everyone loved it and they have 2 or 3 pieces!  The second time i made this cake, I increased the amount of coffee and the liquer for a stronger taste.  I put more coffee in the middle layers of the cake and it was great.  My mom loved this cake because it is so rich in taste yet it's not heavy.

I have been making this cake for years. My family loves it and requests it for all special occasions. I have tried making it with cream cheese and yellow & vanilla cake mixes and it is always a crowd pleaser either way. If I had one critique it would be that the coffee flavor is not strong enough; however, I always receive compliments on this recipe.

The moistness cant be beat but I was dissapointed in other areas. I doubled all the coffee and I still couldnt taste it and I doubled the filling and it was still so thin, and in my opinion that is the main part of Tiramisu is the creamy filling. It would have to be quadroupled to get enough for me, but I also made 4 layers. Will try another recipe next time.

This was a real hit at my office party.  There was none left for me to take home:(
I did change a couple of things.  I made only two layers, added more coffee, no liquer, and did not have marscopone cheese so I used a cheater/cheaper version with cream cheese, cool whip, and powdered sugar.  The only reason I am giving it 4 instead of 5 is because of the icing.  It had very little flavor and adding the coffee turned it a dingy color as opposed to white.  I used heavy whipping cream and finally got it stiff enough.  I think the next time, I will just double the good stuff in the middle and use that for the icing as well.  This was my first recipe from here and I consider it a success.  I plan to make it for our Christmas party, by request, of course.

If I could give this more stars, I would... probably the best thing I've made from this site.  It looked really professional and people couldn't believe that I didn't buy it from somewhere.  I made two coffee-flavored layers... french vanilla white cake base.  I used french vanilla coffee and Kahlua.  I also doubled the filling and doubled coffee amounts anytime it was called for.  Beautiful!

Tastes better a day after though, and the coffee flavor is a little subtle.

This cake is absolutely fantastic - it's hard not to eat another slice!  Like many other reviewers, I doubled the amount of coffee, instant coffee and coffee liqueur wherever it's mentioned (as my husband and I enjoy coffee).  This is definitely a recipe to keep!

I'm not a regular baker, but love this recipe.  Had it at a shower with "real tiramisu" and the layer cake was gone long before that.  I get regular requests now.  If your frosting is watery- you over whipped it.  I did that once, so I know.

I love this dessert!  I'm certainly no chef, but this is always a huge hit at gatherings.  It's an easy to follow recipe but turns out looking and tasting like a masterpiece!  I make the changes recommended by other users (increasing the coffee/Kaluha)and it's always wonderful!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this cake for my friend who just had a baby.  I made her family and Italian meal (shrimp alfredo with linguine) and I wanted an italian dessert.  I searched this site and finally decided on this.  It was a little bit of work but from what I tasted, it was delicious.
My friend called me today to comment on how absolutely delicious this was.  She said it was the best she had ever had.

Thanks for sharing it.

This is the best cake ever!  I made it for a work potluck and everyone thought I bought it.  It is kind of expensive to buy all the ingredients and a little time-consuming but it is well worth it.  I served it with coffee ice cream.  You should definitely try this, especially if you are a tiramisu lover like I am. :D

This was outstanding.  I made it for my husband's birthday (he's Italian).  I tripled the instant coffee and the liqueur.  I also added flaked chocolate in between the layers.  Will definitely make this again.

Awesome recipe. I modified slightly to make the outer two layers of cake coffee flavored and only the middle one plain white cake. For extra special presentation I like to frost the sides first and then airbrush on cocoa powder before frosting the top in pure white. Then I add the chocolate curls. Everyone loves this cake. Thanks for sharing it!

Followed all the reccomendations (upping the coffee & liqueor, brushing it on, freezing the cakes before frosting) and it came out good.  I don't think this was the best cake ever but it was pretty darn good. And I do have to say the filling and the frosting due really taste like Tiramisu.

I know most people are raving about this cake, but it needed something more, it was lacking something.  The frosting was very watery; I live in Florida so maybe the humidity had to do with that.

I've made this twice in two months for different family and their get-togethers.  Both times I recieved rave reviews.  This cake is incredible.  I've been told a lot how they like this cake because it isn't soggy like most Tiramisu's that they have tried.

I served this for dessert on Christmas Eve.  It was a huge hit!  My cake layers were a bit too crumbly...I think I should've baked them for 15-17 minutes...I baked for 20 and they were slightly overcooked.  No one noticed but me.  My Italian relatives loved this.  I will absolutely make this again.

This wasn't bad. It was a nice change from traditional tiramisu, but I think I like that better than this. I used a cake that I made from scratch but I don't think I'd suggest doing that. I used a cool whip topping for the frosting, and I think that was best since the marscapone filling and kahlua were such strong, heavy flavors.

HOLY COW!  Awesome and easy!  I'm not a big fan of coffee desserts, and I was afraid of this having too strong of a coffee flavor for me- but it was really just perfect!  I used a spoon to spoon the coffee mixture over the cakes.  This is going to be one of those recipes that I'm famous for, giving my pumpkin cheese roll and cinnamon rolls a run for their money!

This is a great cake. This was my first time making it but I made some changes. I used espresso instead of brewed coffee. Brewed coffee isnt strong enought and I dont like my cake soggy so I used a espresso for that coffee taste.  Also next time I plan on doubling the mascarpone cheese, 8 oz per layer.  I felt the cake overpowered the cheese.

Thanks for sharing this recipe!  I followed the recipe as written, except used two coffee layers and one white.  I made it a day ahead, always a bonus, and served it at a dinner party.  I had many requests for the recipe, and several went back for seconds.  Will definately make again and again!

Really delicious, but I think next time I will add the coffee crystals to all 3 layers and/or add more kahlua to get a little stronger coffee flavor.  The marscapone is quite expensive so I may look for a substitute.  You won't be disappointed with this cake.

One word: delicious. Of course, mascarpone is a bit expensive and hard to find around where I'm at, so I used a substitute recipe I found on here.. I whipped one up and made my family try it; they loved it!

This recipe was amazing! Like all the other reviews, I thought this looked like a complex cake, but it was finished in no time at all. My whole family loved it! I did use cream cheese instead of mascarpone, since I didn't have the time to buy any and it turned out fine. Great recipe!!

This cake is awesome! Everybody that had a slice loved it, even my son that is very picky ate 2 slices. I did pour coffee granules in every layer to get more of the flavoring. Did not have coffee liquor so left out, still great. Will make again and again. Thanks!

Yum yum and more yum. From the directions, I thought this would be a difficult cake to make. But just take it one step at a time and it's a breeze! It's so light and fluffy. I took it to a BBQ w/my boyfriend's family. It was the first time I made it. New recipe combined w/potential inlaws is usually a recipe for disastor or embarrassment. Don't worry about this one though! Everyone raved about the cake. And those that left before dessert called to see if I had any left b/c they had heard about how good it was! Definately a keeper and mainstay for birthdays, etc. Also looks gorgeous.

This was an AWESOME cake!  It was my very first try at making a layer cake.  It turned out pretty good, actually.  However, I had some trouble with the frosting and ending up buying 2 containers of store bought vanilla and put the liquor in that.  The filling was DELICIOUS!  Definately will be making again on my boyfriends birthday at the end of the month!

I absolutely love anything coffee flavored so I loved this cake!  I'd never had tiramisu before, let alone made it, so I don't know if it turned out how it was supposed to or not.  But it was really good!  Although my chocolate "curls" didn't work, I wound up with chocolate shavings.  But it was still pretty.  Maybe should've used a softer chocolate bar for the curls.  Semi-sweet baking chocolate is too hard.  And the frosting was sooo good!

This cake is better than 99.9% of cakes you buy.  It is light and fluffy and looks like a piece of artwork when you're done with it.  The cake isn't overly sweet like the ready made cakes are.  I served this to my friends from Germany and they said it was the first time they'd had desert in the US that reminded them of home.

As per other reviewers, I made two coffee layers of the cake.  They didn't have mascarpone at the store so I had to use cream cheese.  My husband LOVED the cake (and he is not a cake person).  I thought it was pretty good (and I am a cake person).  I will make it again for him (not for me).

I prepared this cake for Valentine's day. This is the first time Iam baking cakes and it came very well. My husband liked it a lot. 
Only problem was that the frosting was runny. So I heated some unsweetened chocolate and mixed it with the already prepared frosting to give chocolate frosting.

I made this cake for an italian potluck we attended.  I got great reviews for it.  I made it a second time and the filling turned out runny.  Used a different brand of mascarpone cheese and it was not as firm.  Went out and bought the first brand and everything was fine.  Make sure your mascarpone cheese is not too thin.

The description says it all, "fancy taste w/o all the work". The flavor was great but mine came out a little dry.  Could have been the cake mix I used, but next time I'll double the brewed coffee and liqueur mixture to moisten it up - as others have mentioned.  Be sure to beat frosting well enough that it is nice and thick.  Next time instead of sprinkling with cocoa powder I think I'll use chocolate mocha instant hot cocoa mix for a little more chocolatey taste.

Very well liked by all. Easy to make. I used about double the coffee mixture as suggested and could have used more. But it was very good. No trouble with the filling or frosting made just as directed.

This was very good, however the frosting was a bit runny. I used the suggestion of using instant flavored cappuccino drink into the batter instead of fresh brewed coffee. Next time will try using coffee cake mix as suggested and also more Kahlua.

Awesome cake. I made this for my sister b-day. Few things to note. I made it in 9 3/4" pans so I ended up having to make two white cakes (betty crocker) to make it large enough (doubled the recipe). Yep I goofed, but mostly I didn't have 9" pans.  Also got bad advice on what confection sugar  was (thanks grandma) so I used icing sugar.   Required a lot more icing sugar to thicken the forsting up but worked like a charm about 4 times as much.  Used cocoa powder to dust & white chocolate shavings.  Wasn't hard to do, tasted awesome, served about 20 people (generous sized pieces, because I made 2 full white cakes instead of 1) and the cake was 10-12" high when finished. The hight of the cake was later reduced when after being fully baked & iced & decorated it fell off of the table & on to the floor when I went to put in a pan for transport.  Luckily the frosting was so light and fluffy it obsorbed the impact & the cake was untouched undeneath. I refrosted, redecorated & gave it to her. We all ate it, it was a big hit. Either that or they all felt sorry for me. :o)  Seriously though, I would attempt this again, & I'd make it in the 9 3?4" pans, with the icing sugar & the two boxes of white cake. But I may opt not to drop it next time. Like everyone else I used extra Kaluah at every part. Pictures of the cake splattered and finshed will be posted so you may all see & hopefully get a laugh.

There's one word to describe this Tiramisu: DELICIOUS!  The filling was absolutely fabulous.  I must say that it was a bit too cakey for me.. I'd flatten the cake more next time.  Did not have any chocolate to make shavings for the top, so made a zig zag creation with good old Hershey's chocolate syrup :)  Great recipe, thanks!

Tastes great!  I did take suggests from the other ones such as using coolwhip for frosting, however, mine was really runny.  I also did two layers of coffee cake instead of two layers of white and doubled the coffee in powder & liquer.

I wasn't planning on giving this 5 stars because it basically tasted like white cake and whipped cream.  It definitely needs more coffee flavor, and I'm not sure if that comes from brewed espresso, liqueur or what.  I added extra liqueur because others said to, but it still wasn't enough.  Bottom line:  the cake disappeared in a day and a half in a family of 3.

I made this cake for my husbands birthday. We have four July birthdays in all and we were all tired of birthday cake so I found this recipe. It was wonderful, I did like others suggested and doubled up on the coffee. I used cappicuno mix from a gas station instead of using coco. My cheese filling and frosting was really runny but since no one else has complained about that im sure its something I did wrong. He's told everyone at work about it and they want me to fix another one for all of them. We went to Carabas for dinner two nights ago and had a piece there. They all said mine was better. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Yummy recipie! Fairly easy to make too. I made this for a potluck at work and received nothing but compliments! Everyone was impressed. As reccomended in other reviews, I splurged with the coffee/liqueur mixture and used a full cup so I wouldn't run out, it was perfect. Also, thanks for the tip about the mayo in the cake mixture, I just used a heaping spoonful and it made all the difference in the world

Thank you Bettina for the inspiration ... my new Italian Poke Cake! Had little to work with in my kitchen so I promise next time to use the marscapone. This was SO quick and good. Made a 9 inch white Jiffy cake mix as directed on box and added 1 t. coffee crystals, 1 T. Kahlua, and 1/4 c. mayonnaise (keeps it moist). Bake 20 min., poke holes and carefully pour 1/4 c. strong coffee and 1 T. Kahlua over cake. Refrigerate while you mix up 1/2 pkg Vanilla instant pudding with 1 c. milk, 1 T. Kalua, 1/4 c. sour cream and spread over cake. Back into refrigerator. At serving time, slice and decorate each piece with spray whipped cream and cocoa powder (or grated Hershey Bar). This was a 5 star recipe for method, ease,  swapability of ingredients and my guests were licking their plates!

Light and tasty.  More like a cake than an authentic tiramisu.  I also added extra coffee liqueur.  Chocolate shavings on top add a perfect touch.

Even though I personally don't like tiramisu (hate coffee- gasp!) I brought this to a dinner party and got rave reviews.  The other guests gave it an A+ for presentation and an A for taste.  I was told that this does not taste like "traditional" tiramisu but everyone loved it anyway! I didn't change a thing and I thought it was fairly easy to make. Thanks so much for a hit!
