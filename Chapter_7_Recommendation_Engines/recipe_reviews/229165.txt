I used ginger ale instead of lemon lime soda since that's what I had.   Also I baked it at 400F for about 45 min.  It came out moist and delicious!!

I tried this recipe today:  the chicken came out very moist but not enough flavor and very salty,if I was to make it again I will add other spices and less soy sauce.

THIS IS SPECTACULAR!!!!! I have tried this recipe several times, I haven't used it in a while and was so excited to find it again!  Its a simple marinade that is extremely flavorful, and it goes so well with pork tenderloin!  The only thing I do differently is add a tbsp spicy mustard for that extra zing.  My thanks to the chef!

Quite good. Marinaded overnight. Chunked up my chicken for kabobs. Upped garlic powder. When threading kabobs I cut up zucchini, summer squash, onions and mushrooms. Poured some reserved marinade over then basted with it while grilling. Note- I reserved marinade right after mixing it up and put 3/4 of it with chicken and rest in container in fridge for my veggies. Great taste on kabob veggies and meat.

This is my aunt's go-to recipe when grilling chicken at family parties and it's delicious as-is. My star rating is based on the recipe as written (minus one star, just cause it's pretty high in sodium). My daughter requested it last night and I didn't have all the ingredients on hand so I made some substitutions and it worked out well-- we had a lemon essenced sparkling water, so I used that and added the juice of 2 lemons and about 1-2 tbsn brown sugar to imitate the lemon-lime soda. I also used diced garlic instead of powdered and about 1/3 the amount of soy sauce and subbed some liquid aminos, still using less than the amount called for by about half. (Coconut aminos would be an even better option, but I have yet to get my hands on any).  We only had about 25 minutes to marinate it, but it still came out moist and flavorful with that familiar flavor that I'm used to when it's made as written. Just wanted to share this with others in case they avoid soda like our family does.

Ok so I actually put the chicken in the marinade for 3 days (forgot about it in the meat tray) so my results may be a little different since recipe calls for 24 hrs. With that said, It was the best grilled chicken I've ever had and I grill frequently. It was moist, somewhat blackened (I guess form olive oil flare up). I did butterfly the breast (probably could have pounded them too). They were absolutely delicious. I may add some heat (cayenne, crushed red pepper) to suit my taste next time but this recipe is FINE as is, needs nothing,  really great.

We love this easy marinade. We usually will use a Mexican soda (or any other soda that uses sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup). We've used lemon-lime, pineapple, and orange soda at different times and all turn out great. We also use bone-in chicken thighs instead of breasts so the grill time is longer. We always poke our thighs with a fork before marinating to make sure plenty of flavor gets into the chicken. We use fresh garlic and blend everything up (minus the soda) using our immersion blender, add the soda and chicken, and let it marinade overnight. So yummy!

This was great.  I used Sprite Zero, and had to substitute Worcestershire sauce because I found I didn't have any soy sauce.  Cooked it on an indoor electric grill.  This was tender and juicy, and the leftovers the next day were just as good.

Omg I loved this recipe. So amazing and delicious. The trick is to let it sit and grill it on one side for about 75 percent and fishing the other side. It keeps it super juicy

We loved this recipe. Because of my husband's coronary artery disease and our high blood pressure, we cook lower sodium meals. So, I used low lower sodium soy sauce and I minced a jumbo clove of garlic. I also used my George Foreman grill instead of firing up the outside grill. This was delicious! Hubby says the recipe is a keeper and I agree.

YUM! My husband is not a fan of chicken on the grill, but loved this! I used boneless skinless breasts, tossed them in the marinade after breakfast and grilled about 10 minutes for dinner. This is going to be my go to grilled chicken recipe from now on!

I made this as written and also added a tablespoon of Dijon mustard and a half tablespoon of honey. I butterflied the chicken and marinated for about six hours. The flavor was amazing and the chicken was tender and juicy. My fellas do not like spice but you could certainly add your choice of flavors to give it some kick. Frankly it doesn’t need anything except what’s already there. Great recipe!

I marinated the chicken for over a day. The flavor was OK. It's a nice change to just a grilled piece of chicken. However, I will be adding more herbs and spices. There wasn't enough flavor for us.

I did as another reviewer suggested and baked the breasts for 45 mins 400F and they came out perfect.  I used garlic salt to season the outside a bit.  The entire family enjoyed this.  Added to my faves!

I used ginger ale instead of lemon lime soda. It was good, moist. I recommend adding a little sauce near the end but I may have over cooked mine.

Kind of bland. Needs more seasoning. Best part was meat was juicy which is hard to maintain with a boneless skinless chicken Brest. Maybe a little less soy sauce as it was a little salty

The chicken came out dry.  Of course, that may have been an error on my part.  But in general, the flavor wasn't anything special.

We make this all the time in summer great of the grill. The chicken breast are EXTREMELY moist. after only 30mins in the marinade. Even better when you let it sit over night.

This was okay, not spectacular. Not enough flavour.
