I had a bunch of cottage cheese in the fridge and decided to try these. I used regular unbleached flour butter and almond extract. I was a little worried because the batter seemed sort of liquidy But they came out quite good! Cake-like texture nice brown edge and great flavor! Make a double batch as a single only fills one cookie sheet.

This is a nice simple cookie chewy and sweet though I baked them too long and burned the bottom. I decided on this recipe to use up cottage cheese though I wasn't sure if it would make a strange taste but it just made for a light and tasty soft cookie.

I happen to like cottage cheese. Nevertheless I used fat free ricotta for most of the cottage cheese butter in place of the shortening and one teaspoon of almond extract in place of the lemon. They came out not unlike the almond cookies from the infamous Italian bakery nearby. Mine did not come out crispy at the edges - more a cake-like cookie. Still I thought they were lovely and my hubbie ate the whole batch in two days. Maybe add sliced almonds on top the next time? I came back to this review and made it 5 stars because I end up using this recipe so often. It's delicious with almond extract (1 t) in place of the lemon.

Easy to make and very light. I didn't have cake flour so I used all purpose. (The conversion for subbing all purpose flour for cake flour is 1C - 2 tbsp 2 tbsp of corn starch) I would like to try the almond flavor as well next time.

I put all the wet ingredients into the blender (butter not shortening & almond extract not lemon) then mixed with the sifted dry. sprinkled tops with toasted slivered almonds before baking. YUM! I even tried a few with powdered sugar glaze. The texture is the perfect combination of cake and cookie. LOVE IT!
