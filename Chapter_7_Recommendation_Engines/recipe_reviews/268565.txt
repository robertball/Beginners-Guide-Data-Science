This is a great soup, and it makes a lot. If you're someone that likes leftovers, this is for you.  Make sure you use pearl barley because hulled barley will be chewy, and quick barley will be mushy.  There's also not much barley in here, so I'd probably double it next time. I also suggest seasoning the meat with salt and pepper, and again seasoning the soup once it's done, to taste. I found that it needed additional salt to really bring out the flavors.

I have been making this for years. Make exactly as written, just adding some salt and pepper. I cook on stovetop for approx 4 hrs.
Great recipe!

Delicious!  Made some changes based on was on hand, peeled crushed tomatoes instead of diced, potatoes and kidney beans instead of barley.
Added the rinsed kidney beans after the pressure cooking cycle was done.
Also added a couple of cloves of  garlic to the onion and beef

Wow, this is a simple but incredibly effective dish.  I just have a small old crockpot so I fried the onions and beef on the stove first.  I only had space for 1 can of consommé but together with the tomato soup and huge jar of home canned tomatoes the soup turned out fantastic.  Literally, it was so delicious; enjoyed by all :)

This recipe calls for far too much liquid for the amount of other ingredients, in my opinion.  Once it was done cooking, I added 2 cups of cooked pasta (Barilla Pasta Ready) and a can of red kidney beans.  This helped to even out the ratio and the flavors/textures added nicely to the original soup.  I will add these again next time and will only use 1 quart of liquid.

This soup is fantastic.   My husband loves it.  He asked me to make it again.  The only substitution that I made was to use Italian Seasoning since I didn't have the thyme.   I also, add some sour cream and a slice of bread to the bowl of hot soup.  It turns out great.

I love this recipe, but because I needed to make it beef-free, I substituted ground chicken for the beef, chicken and veggie broth for the beef consomme, and cream of chicken soup for the tomato soup.  I know, completely different recipe!  But this is a great recipe for hamburger soup as well as a chicken soup.  One thing I would change for the chicken though, is to add rice rather than barley.

Made exactly as written. Very good. Very easy. Adding a bag of frozen mixed veggies is something I  might try next time but it's not necessary.  As is written elsewhere this soup is very thick when refrigerated but loosens up a great deal when warmed up. MMMMMM!

Skip the tomato soup Nd use seasoned diced tomatoes instead.  So much better! Add a bit of chili powder too.
 Can do on stove top in 30-45 min. Brown beef then add veg, 
I add some elbows if lots broth or cook separately and add.  They will soak up all the broth, however.

Needs some spice, so I add crushed red pepper. I tried it with some pasta, but that takes away from texture and flavor. If you want it thicker, double up the pearl barley!

No, I didn't make any changes except to add two cans of diced tomatoes instead of a 28oz can.  I should add more barley for the extra tomato juice.  Everyone really like it!

This was great! My kiddo loved it too. I didn't have tomato soup, so I just added extra canned tomatoes (2 jars worth). I used beef broth instead of consommé because I'm pretty sure I've never had consommé in my house.

I doubled the barley as another reviewer suggested and and I'm glad I did. It was perfect! A really good and hearty soup for the cooler weather! Adding this to my make again :)

At first I didn't think it would be enough for dinner. I used some biscuits to fix that. It has a real nice flavor just the way it is.

A bit bland, but if you add salt, pepper, and hot sauce it is great. Definitely will make again and possibly add a couple of things.

This turned out delicious. I will definitely make it again but will probably add a little garlic and white pepper.

I made changes because of the ingredients I didn't have on hand.  I used quartered red potatoes, since I didn't have any pearled barley, and a small can of tomato juice in place of tomato soup.  Without the soup and barley, I decided to cut out the 2 cups of water.  Added salt and pepper as others suggested and it's very good! I also cooked the hamburger meat in a separate pot, put it in a colander then rinsed the meat with hot water to cut down on the saturated fat content.  I think you could add just about any vegetables as well as the ones called for (like zuchinni, spinach, green beans, etc.).

I have been making this exact recipe for years in a soup pot and it is the best I have ever tasted. The only thing I do differently is grate the carrots instead of slicing them. Seems to bring out the flavour better.
