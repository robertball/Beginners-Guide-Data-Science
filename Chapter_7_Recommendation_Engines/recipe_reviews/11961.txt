We liked this; similar to a recipe I have which adds cream cheese instead of half-and-half. I prefer the cream cheese, but this was good too. Probably would add another can of tomatoes to have more sauce, or a can of crushed tomatoes.

I thought this recipe was great. I used cream cheese instead of half and half and crushed tomatoes because I didn't have stewed. I will be making this again!

Great, easy recipe!  I added a little salt, pepper, and oregano to the sauce near the end to perk up the flavour.  Will make again!

I loved this recipe. I used 2 links like earlier reviewers and had to substitute sour cream for the Half and Half.
Great flavor and the kids loved it.  Will make again.

Wow, the kids keep asking if we can have it again.  I used the non- link italian pork and it worked wonderfully.  The grown ups enjoyed the meal and lack of complaints from the peanut gallery.

Maybe this would be better if I used sour cream or cream cheese along with a little half-n-half.  I certainly used much more cheddar cheese.  2 tablespoons, that can't be right!

This was good, but definitely had too much onion in the mixture, next time I make it I'm going to use about half the onions.

This was good.  My family really liked it. However I had a pet accident in my kitchen.  I would make this again but my husband got to my dish and he put his own spices in it, and lets just say one of my pets smells like the sause.  Sorry, I can't give it more stars.

This was ok.  I reduced the heat and added the 1/2 and 1/2 and it immediately curdled.  Not very appetizing.  Will not make again.

Add some fresh oregano, a bay leaf and a couple of chopped dried tomatoes - perks the flavor to a T.

Like a previous reviewer, I added another Italian Sausage link.  I also used a small onion and added extra garlic.  The sauce was a bit runny for my tastes, but it was flavorful.  Will definitely be trying again and tweaking a bit more to our tastes.  Thanks for a great recipe tho'!

I LOVED this dish! Wasn't so sure how the different flavors would blend, but they do!  I used stewed tomatoes with basil already added and broke up the tomatoes.  I also used fat free half and half (the good brand) and you would not know the difference!  I've passed this one on to friends and they love it!  Thought that 12 oz. of pasta was a little too much for one recipe of sauce, but I like a lot of sauce!

I made the recipe exactly as written. It was really good.  However I found that I like more garlic so added more the second time.  Other than that, I have varied the sausage with hot and sweet Italian sausage and enjoy both.

My picky husband selected this recipe...DELISH! Picky kids ate it too! I used basil, garlic & oregano diced tomatoes because it was what I had on hand.  Fat free 1/2 and 1/2, turkey sausage for healthier spin. Totally forgot about the cheddar cheese and nobody seemed to notice or care...(also healthier).  Sauteed the onion in seperate pan and added celery and bell pepper to add to only the veggie eaters' plates...BRILLIANT! Can't wait to make again.

I followed the customized version's suggestion of using a combination of cream cheese and sour cream. I also added: 1) 1 tsp. each: oregano, basil and dried red pepper flakes 2) Couple dashes of cayenne pepper 3) Salt and pepper 4) Chopped green pepper  With the extra seasonings and the green pepper this recipe turned out great! This is definitely something I will make again. Delicious, fast and easy.

Tip:  Go ahead and use half and half.  But temper it with some of the sauce before adding it to the main mixture.  This prevents curdling.  Smile!

I followed other's advice and used cream cheese, rather than half-and-half. I also substituted chicken for the sausage and diced tomatoes for the stewed ones. This recipe was easy to make and tasted OK, but not superb.

I loved this dish, the rest of the family wasnt' crazy about it though, so I only gave it 4.  I used cream instead of 1/2 n 1/2, spicy italian sausage, removed from casings so it was groud up.  Used parmesan instead of cheddar.  I thought it was restaurant quality and very easy to prepare!

Great rosé sauce. All it needed was an extra pinch of dried thyme cooked in with the sausage, and an extra pinch of dried basil, simmered with the tomatoes for about five minutes before adding the half-'n'-half. Thanks for posting it. Absolutely wonderful.

This was pretty good.  I'm giving it 4 stars because I want to play with the recipe for our tastes a bit.  I increased the sausage to 2 links because we like Italian Sausage.  I also reduced the onion by half.  The sauce was a little runny, but had good flavor.  Will try again.

I used to 2 boxes of Penne pasta for 6 people - 4 adults and 2 children and I served it with a ceasar salad. Had pasta noodels left over but that was Ok I don't like to have to little. I would rather have left overs. Used 2 cans of diced tomatoes, 1 whole onion, added fresh basil from garden and marinara sauce, I used a pound of sausage. and only added a small amount of 1/2 and 1/2. Spooned it generously over the Pasta and it was really good, whole family liked it. Sprinkeled with parmesean not cheddar.

This is a good idea to start out with.  I used more sausage, a can of tomato sauce ( added a large chopped fresh tomato close to the end of cooking time)  This solved the problem of having a runny sauce.  Heavy cream if added slowly helps to hold the texture of this sauce as well.  I spiced it up with garlic and basil and oregano.  Too many changes to give it five stars, but a good recpipe.

My family didn't care for this. Maybe it was the particular sauseage we used. There are so many recipes - probably won't try this again.
