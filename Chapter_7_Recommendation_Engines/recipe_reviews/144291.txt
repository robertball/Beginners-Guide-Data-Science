This was a very good recipe. I was AMAZED at how quickly this cooked up. I cut the pork into slices and simply baked them with some veggies. I used Pam instead of olive oil and shook salt and black pepper over the tray before popping them in the oven (10 minutes per side). The mixture of seasonings and liquids cooked down nicely into a sweet, yet spicy sauce. I would recommend that if you aren't a fan of spicy foods or are using a mustard that is spicier then Dijon (like I stupidly did) then you should cut the amount of mustard and horseradish in half. Other then that, it was great!

I didn't find it overly spicy but I like foods really spicy. This was really good though. I cut the red wine vinegar to 1 Tbsp. and cooked the onion and garlic in a small saute pan then added the rest of the sauce and let it sit on the burner that was still warm but off. We had it with pork chops and I put about 1/2 tsp. dijon mustard on the chops with about a tsp of sauce then baked them. I then poured the sauce over the cooked chops. We had it with horseradish mashed potatoes(potatoes, sour cream, horseradish, kosher salt, fresh ground pepper). The sauce was delicious mixed with the potatoes also.

This recipe was delicious.  I didn't have any horseradish so that was omitted from the sauce, I also only put in one and a half tbsp of red wine vinegar and added an extra half tbsp of worcestershire.  I had never grilled tenderloin before and it was so juicy...the sauce was a great mix of sweet/spicy!!!

not bad....I was surprised that the sauce was such a small amount.  I also didn't fool with the grill tonight, so I baked this in the oven at 450 for about 20-30 minutes...still very moist and tasty.  I like the sauce....just might take a little getting used to not having the meat swimming in the sauce

Thanks so much for this recipe.  Like the first reviewer suggested, we used this as a marinade and turned out wonderful.  One thing I added was a TBS of Balsamic Vinegar.  Can't wait to serve this the next time we entertain.

We used this as a marinade for the pork tenderloin, and it came out great. I substituted brown mustard for the dijon, and we thought it was great. Not spicy, not vinegary, just perfect.

I was looking for a recipe that I could prepare and cook tonight for Pork Tenderloin.  Most other recipes required marinating overnight.  This recipe is so fast and simple yet so delicious and full of flavor!  I love the horseradish kick!  I will definitely be making this again!

Excellent!  The sauce was tangy, sweet, a bit spicy, and delicious.  Very flavorful.  I was worried even as someone who likes spicy food that this might be too much spice, but it was just right.  This would also be great over chicken or beef.  Super easy recipe...thanks!

everyone LOVED the sauce! i actually had to double the sauce because i knew that so many people would like it.   My changes: I didn't have horseradish or red pepper flakes so i doubled up on the mustard. I also added in spicy brown mustard to give it some spice. I was told to add sriracha next time, so i think i'll do that!  loved it!

This was outstanding!!  Great flavor.  I followed the recipe to the "T" except I rubbed the pork pieces with some SW Rub I have and need to use up.  I had NO problems with the sauce.  It was just perfect.  I served it with Garlic Mashed Potatoes and some Green Beans with Almonds.  Hubby said it reminded him of something we would have at a restaurant!  FANTASTIC! ~ Thank you!!

Delicious!  Didn't have all ingredients so I improvised and it turned out great!  Basalmic Vinegar; Onion Powder; no Horseradish and cooked in a skillet.  Used as a marinade.

Very good! I used 1.5 tbs of red wine vinegar, 1 tbs of Emeril's mustard with horseradish (no horseradish separately), and 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes.  This was sufficiently spicy without being overwhelming. Definitely double the sauce. I did not marinate the pork - just added the sauce after cooking like the recipe says, and it was delicious! Served it with green beans and a non-spicy risotto (which helped balance out the spice).

I'm sorry, I consider myself to be a good cook who doesn't make inedible meals that often, but this was inedible.  My guy and I can really take the heat, but the 1 tsp. red pepper flakes simply overwhelmed the flavor of the sauce!  If reduced, the dish could be salvaged, but I would not make it again....tenderloin is too expensive to waste.

I really didn't like these, and neither did my husband. The sauce tasted way too vinegary. I will not be making these again.

Yummy! This recipes was great! It was a nice way to use the tenderloin in a new way. I really enjoys the sauce it was sweet, sticky, and had just a little heat. I did leave out the horse radish but added the red pepper flake! It is also very quicky to make!

This recipe was absolutely delicious!!  I sliced the pork into 1" slices and let marinate in small amount olive oil and cracked pepper for about 45 min.  My husband grilled for 4 min per side and let rest as directed.  Was cooked through, tender and so juicy.  I usually have problems grilling whole tenderloins to get inside and ends done/undercooked...etc. and this solved that problem.  I would double the sauce, it's delicious drizzled over the grilled meat!!

This is a quick and easy delicious sauce for pork.  I did not add the red pepper or the horseradish because my children were eating and it was still delicious.

Wow!  I love this recipe! I made it exactly as written, but doubled the amount of sauce. I kind of wish that I had tripled it! I found the flavour right up my alley, and not spicy at all... I probably put a little less chili flakes though, as I just eyeballed it. This was great served with rice and the Oven-Roasted Asparagus from this site!

We loved this!  I didn't have the red wine vinegar so sub'd balsamic.  I made 1-1/2 times the sauce and that was a perfect amount.  This is a keeper for sure.

This was amazing! Forget doubling the recipe for the sauce, you should triple it! It would also make a great dipping sauce.

Very tastey; doubled the sauce and marinated the tenderlion for several hours prior to grilling. Everyone loved the sauce even though it packs a spicey punch. Very easy & enjoyed by all.

After reading the reviews of others, I prepared this with only 1/2 tablespoon red wine vinegar, yet still found it far too vinegary.  I usually like anything that is sweet and spicy, so I may try this again and completely omit the vinegar.

We made this for company and kids,  used only 1/2 the amount of red pepper.  It was very good.  Will definitely do this again.

So so delicious. Only thing I didn't use was the horseradish. Oh my, it was so good. Followed the recipe as given. We ate it all up! Thank you very much!

We loved this!  The pork cooked up very quickly since it was sliced, so it worked well for a weeknight dinner.  The sauce is pretty strongly flavored, but we served it on the side, and you could use as much as you wanted so it wasn't an issue.  It doesn't make much sauce, but since you only use a little bit, it was the perfect quantity.  I used apple cider vinegar instead of red wine vinegar, and shallot instead of onion.  Next time, I might cut back a bit on the Dijon mustard as that flavor was a bit too predominant in the sauce.  Served with roasted carrots and horseradish mashed potatoes.  I will definitely make this again.  I think the sauce would also be nice on other meats like chicken.

This is a great way to cook pork tenderloin on the grill!  I cut back the red pepper flakes to 1/2 teaspoon and the sauce was still very spicy but most of us liked it.

We all agreed this was awesome!  I made it a marinade and massaged it in the bag, for a total of 30 minutes.  I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine, and used garlic powder and coarsely chopped onions for the hubby and kids and it was a huge hit!  Very tender and excellent hot sweet flavor! Thanks!

On the advice of others I added balsamic vinegar, used red chile powder, teriaki and honey in my sauce and omitted the dijon.  This recipe is great.  The tenderloin grilled up nicely, was tender and juicy and the sauce was excellent.  I will make this often for sure.

Added a little olive to sauce while heating in pan. I baked in the oven at 450 for about 25 minutes instead of grilling because I served with roasted vegetables. Will definitely make again. I enjoy reading the reviews and it really helps.

Great!  Fixed it on the grill.  I really liked the sauce, but it does not make very much.

LOVED it and so did my hubs.  I decided to try this one in the crock pot and it was delish!  I just put the pork in the crock, and mixed up the remaining ingredients and poured over.  Cooked on low 6-7 hours and it was tender and delicious (served over brown rice with green beans).  

I did double the sauce recipe (except for the sugar because I'm on a low G.I. diet) and I only used 1/2 tsp. of red pepper flakes...it was still plenty spicy without being overpowering.  Will definitely make it again and would highly recommend it in the crock pot!

This was soooooo tasty! The only thing was that i wanted it a tad bit sweeter, so i added just a tablespoon of maple syrup. Once i did that, it was just what i was looking for! :)....Just add some olive oil, and this could be a great marinade for steak & chicken as well! Great cook-out item!

I love this recipe in the oven. It is fast and easy, and it looks like you put a lot more work into it than you did.  Have care with the vinegar though!

I liked this.It was very easy to fix and the sauce was very good. Although it doesn't make very much so I would double the recipe so you have enough. I will fix this again.

This was very "gourmet," but had to be altered quite a bit for our taste. I'm from the South and like spice, but this was way too spicy and vinegary at first. I had to add a bit more brown sugar and some balsamic to balance the flavor. This was something that worked for dinner in the end, but not something I will make again...

I gave it four stars because I changed two things. First I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used balsamic instead. Then I replaced the onion with chipotle peppers. We love very spicy food and this was GREAT, as well as supper easy. We are already planning on making this for a dinner party. Thank you for the idea.
