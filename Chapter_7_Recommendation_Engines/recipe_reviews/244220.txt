This was really good.  So much like rice it was amazing.  I added some asparagus I had on hand but it could use more vegetables. Carrots would be great (added color). Next time I'll definitely use fresh onion and garlic. Yes, more salt. I can see going Asian fried "rice" with soy sauce and egg added.  This will be on our table a lot!

This was tasty. For me it needed some salt and some more veggies. One thing to be aware of, the mushrooms, while they taste great with this.. they do give the dish a bit of a gray color. It didnt bother me, but just be aware

After reading the reviews,  I saluted 1/2 a jumbo yellow onion before adding the riced cauliflower, minced  carrots and some kale. I didn't have any fresh mushrooms, so I added a can of  mushroom soup and about a teaspoon of minced garlic!

I didnâ€™t have the Ranch so I used mayo. I also used a mixture of cheeses but mostly cheddar.
