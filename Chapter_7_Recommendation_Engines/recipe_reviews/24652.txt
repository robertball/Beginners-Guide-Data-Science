I found this recipe easy to follow except that I had a difficult time finding a few ingredients. 
Fresh Cayenne Pepper,
Pequin Chile pepper,
Serrano Pepper,
Other than that this is a great recipe.

Very good chili, however I had to make a few adjustments based upon pepper availability. I used cayenne powder instead of fresh cayenne; deleted pequin chile pepper and added instead part of a poblano pepper and about 6 chiltepin peppers (a very hot little pepper). The chiltepin peppers grow wild in my area of Texas. I also deleted the white onion mentioned and used instead some wild white onions that grow here (they're hotter). I used Stubb's Spicy BBQ Sauce for the sauce mentioned in the recipe and used 2 cans of pinto beans instead of just one. This recipe came out very well and the people eating it even favorably remarked that they didn't have to add any hot sauce to spice it up. I served it with shredded cheddar cheese, extra chopped onion and jalapeno cornbread.

Excellent chili.  I used homemade BBQ sauce made with Old Grandad 114 bourbaon for an extra kick!

My husband tried this recipe for our church chili cookoff.  He won third place.  He tried it again for a work chili cookoff and won third place again.  This has been a great recipe for us.  We have friends that can't wait until we make it again.

I personally loved this chili recipe. I had a chili cook off in my Family and Consumer Science class and won first place for best taste. I plan on cooking it again at home.

This was delicious and hot.  Really meaty, really hot, and really tangy.  I think too much barbeque sauce was called for.  The recipe called for 1 bottle of barbeque sauce when I think 1/2 a bottle would suffice.  Once again, this was delicious.  Well worth the trouble!

This was a great chili recipe.  I buy locally and lucked into the last of pepper season.  I could not match all of the varieties so I made sure that I matched the quantity.

Usually chili really improves the second day but this was terrific immediately.

I soak my beef tips in liquid smoke.  I also have used sausage, ground turkey and ground beef.  Its been great each time.  I also have used very lean groun beef because I dont like to drain after I add all the spices. Its hard to find all the peppers in this part of the country. This is a huge staple on my menue.

very tasty chili, I too used some powdered chilis in place of fresh. I also used my left over roast instead of the beef tip. I used cranberry beans that I had picked fresh from the garden. All in  all we liked it very much.

I have made this several times.  I follow the recipe as close as possible, though some of the peppers are hard to find all the time so that varies a little but I wanted to write this review so  whomever developed this recipe could hear how great I think it is.   If you love chili this is the best recipe I have ever found.
