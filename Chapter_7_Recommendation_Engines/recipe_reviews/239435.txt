Absolutely loved the rub. I used 1/2 smoked paprika and 1/2 sweet paprika. I thought the smoked paprika would go really well and it did. My chops were much smaller so obviously cooked them for a shorter time, and by the time they were almost to the blackened state they were done, so I didn't test the foil/tenting part of the cooking process. Next time I'll try to use larger ones and try that method. Regardless, these are delicious chops. That rub would go well on chicken or fish as well.

I have to say that this one was probably the best pork I have ever eaten. The cooking method made the pork so moist and tender even my hubby ate every bite and he is not a big meat eater. Will def use this method again. BTW I cooked the pork in the pan to about 130 degrees and then put in the foil to bring it up to 145. Brilliant

Absolutely fantastic! Will definitely make it again and again. Super simple recipe for thick chops. Fast cooking...with the result a delicious, juicy, wonderfully spicy piece of meat. Spot on as usual, Chef John! Everybody loved them.

These are really good.  I didn't have ancho, but substituted chipotle chile powder and it worked out well.  I had my doubts about the allspice, but it worked out well.  The pork was flavorful and juicy.  I liked it a lot.

My chops were only 1/2 inch,  so we reduced pan time to 3 minutes, each side, until 130 degrees, and continued according to recipe directions. So delicious!!!

This was awesome! My chops were really thick though and the 10 min was not enough time for resting. Normal thick chops would be perfect. My husband loved these and I kept the ingredients a s fret just to make him wonder out loud- "what am I tasting?" Great recipe- I would not change a thing!!
