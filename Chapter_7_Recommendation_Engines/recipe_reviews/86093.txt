While very visually appealing onthe plate, I will need to tweak this recipe.  I found the paprika to be a bit "abrasive" and believe a marinated chix breast will bring more depth to the recipe - looked great, though!  I tried this recipe on 140 guests last week for possible addition to my catering menu, and no one asked for the recipe, so I know it needs some work.

This cooked up really well the chicken was great.  I was however bothered by the citrus that was cooked with the chicken.  I couldn't stand the thought of eating it, so I tossed it and cut up additional citrus that I served with the chicken in it's raw natural state.  This was more to my taste of course and I found it a great solution.

I really LOVED the way this recipe turned out!!  I actually used a bit of Caribbean Jerk spice on the chicken (because we like it HOT HOT HOT!) and it really blended very well with the fruits.  It was SO easy to make - completely foolproof. I will most definitely make this again, my husband and I felt like we were on our honeymoon back in Jamaica again!  :)

This was really good, will make again.  I used whole chicken breast, topped with lots of fruit and baked at 350 for about an hour and 15 minutes.  The result was really tender juicy breasts with a hint of fruity flavor and of course paprika.  We thought the combination was great.

A++ This recipe is wonderful "as is" but I like to add a little chili powder and cayenne pepper to spice it up.  It gives it a great sweet and spicy kick thats just right!

Great recipe!  My husband and I loved it the way it is written and made it again with our personal variations.  The second time it was prepared with the chicken cut in large cubes tossed in a healthy coating of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and baked with plenty of mushrooms just because I love mushrooms *smile*.  Definitely a keeper recipe that is wonderful the way it is or if you want to be creative and add some different veggies or sauce. We will try the next time with Teriyaki sauce...mmmmmmmm.

This was delicious!  I made if for a few friends.  I added creole seasoning to the chicken and chopped up an onion to add in.  It came out great and my guests really enjoyed it!  I also used yellow rice instead of spanish rice which was very good with the bean soup!

Awesome!  I did make my own Spanish rice.  I added chili powder.  Lots of paprika. And topped it with sour cream and guacamole and fresh tomatoes!  Mmmmmmmmm!  My family loved it!

I halved the recipe and found it delicious!  I loved the flavor of the chicken and the combo of pepper and fruit.  My store didn't have black bean soup so I just topped with warm black beans.  It was still good but I am definitely going look harder for the soup because it needed sauce to keep together!  Even my boyfriend who hates fruit loved it!  Will make again for sure!  Don't know why buy my baking time took almost double than the recipe... just fyi..

I made this for the first time for company.  Very easy to put together and the presentation was superb.  One guest said it looked like restaurant quality food.  The dish was delish but I think I will spice up the chicken more next time.

This is a great recipe that brings all the flavors of a Caribbean vacation right to your kitchen!! The citrus soaks right into this dish and I added some Cinnamon and grated some nutmeg to warm up the pineapple.If you're a citrus lover you can add a little orange and lemon zest. I recommend adding some Cayenne and/or Chili Powder for heat! Loved it with Spanish Rice and just served Black Beans and a dollop of sour cream. This was a hit and will be making it again soon!

I made a few minor adjustments depending on what was in the cupboard, but I've made this a coupld times, and each time it's just as delicious as the first! I was a little hesitant at first, but it's easy and definitely worth it!

Get rid of the bell pepper, and use heart-healthy brown rice as a substitute for the Spanish-style rice.  This is good with black bean soup, although little kids will probably not like it, it's worth a try with them.

This was good, and really easy to make. I didnt add any raw fruit at the end. The only thing I would change would be to throw out the citrus after cooking it, because it was a little annoying to pick out soggy citrus skins while eating.

Delicious. I'm not a good cook and I must say this was really easy and very tasty. Even the kids liked it.

Used tenderloins instead of breasts
Dry Caribbean jerk marinade w/ orange juice, instead of paprika, etc.
