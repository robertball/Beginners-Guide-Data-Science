This was a great recipe. The only change I made was to the liquid. I used 50% chicken broth and 50% water. My guests would not stop eating it. Next time just this soup, bread and a jug of wine will be a hit. We loved it. Prep is everything. We made the soup up to the point prior to adding the cream and spinach. When the guests arrived and the time was right, we added the cream and spinach while re-heating, and served it. Wow...a hit. Thanks

I give this 4 stars only because 5 stars is the ultimate.  I do really like this soup though.  I was unable to resist adding a clove of garlic when sauteing the vegetables and also threw in some sliced mushrooms.  Like the other reviewer, I used chicken stock for 1/2 the liquid.  Replacing the heavy cream with half-and-half didn't hurt the flavor at all.  (Have to cut a few calories where you can.)

I had never cooked with Leeks before and was a bit concerned about having an over-powering oniony flavor.  Thats not a problem with this recipe.  After simmering for 30 minutes, the many flavors combine and mellow nicely.  I'll make this again.

I've made the soup twice and guests liked it very much. It has a lovely fresh flavor. I used water only and that worked fine for me. I'll certainly make it again. (I'd say the recipe serves six at most when you serve it with salad and bread only.)

I don't believe this just has 4 stars.  I've been on a soup kick this year and I've made some really great, great soups from this site and this is one of them - it may be our favorite.  I followed the recipe only making the change of substituting chicken broth for the water and used really fresh veggies.  Mmmmmmm -I can still taste the freshness of this soup.  Thanks submitter - I will be making this often during the summer when I can buy fresh, locally grown vegetables.

Definately add broth instead of water. Added garlic and mushrooms.  Also fresh herbs such as tarragon, a little basil, thyme, etc. -need for flavor.  I used vadilia onion instead of leaks and added a little red bell pepper for color.  My husband and daughter liked it.  Also used the fat free evaporated milk.  Just ate leftovers for lunch -- good healthy & light

I made the recipe and found it to be bland.  My boyfriend agreed.  I used concentrated chicken stock to give it some body which made a huge difference and then it was delicious.  Loblaws in Ontario has an amazing chicken stock called fresh concentrated chicken stock and its great-like homemade. Oh I did use milk as well instead of cream.  I always do that and it always works out.

This soup is amazing! And I'm terrible at cooking soups.  Made a few modifications, like adding garlic to the onions & leeks. Used whole wheat couscous instead of rice as I didn't have any rice. And really wished I would have chopped up my spinach cause the leaves are very large and tend to clump together. But amazing all around!

This was very good.  Like nice restaurant quality.  My husband said it was out of this world.  He's never said that before.  I too used 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 water, 3 cloves of garlic minced, and some sliced mushrooms. oh yeah

Wanted to use some fresh asparagus that was given to me by a friend.  Asparagus is not on my husband's favorite list.  Coming across this recipe in my search, I thought it might work.  It did.  My husband thought it was very good.  Of course I didn't have all of the ingredients.  I didn't have leeks or spinach.  I added fresh chives from the garden with the cream.  I happen to have cream, but next time I think I will try EVAPORATED MILK as another reviewer said.  I think the CREAM OF ASPARAGUS SOUP idea also sounds good, but that might be pushing it with my husband.  If you like your soup thicker, there is a Reduced Fat Potato Soup found on this site that uses a package of orignal COUNTRY STYLE GRAVY MIX.  It thickens potato soup real well that you may even have to add either a little milk or water to desired consistency.  I do like creamed soups.  I may try adding CHEESE also.  There are so many possiblities.  I also had to use instant brown rice.  Ten minutes is long enough to cook the vegetables in this recipe as long as they are diced small, and it isn't going to hurt the rice if it is cooked longer than ten minutes.  I agree that more rice could be used if desired as other reviewers stated.  Very good recipe Luanne.

This was an excellent soup!  It's freezing rain and snow here as I write this, and craving a warm soup loaded with veggies fit the bill!  Just a couple of changes.  I used low-sodium broth in leu of water, I did not add the rice, and pureed about half of the broth/veggie mix in the blender before adding the spinach and cream.  Absolutely delicious!  Thanks for a nice recipe!

Wow!  My Italian husband who was disappointed that I wasn't making a minestrone just said this is one of the best soups I have ever made.  I made a few slight changes:  Added 2 cloves garlic, added fresh thyme, added a vegetable bouillon cube, added a few shakes of pepper, and used half and half in place of heavy cream.  Outstanding recipe!

Decent but overrated!  I followed the recipe precisely, and the soup turned out very bland with mushy potatoes.  The cream seems like an unnecessarily unhealthy ingredient; perhaps a healthier replacement would improve the recipe.  When reheating leftovers, I added vegetable bouillon cubes which resulted in a much tastier soup.  However, I will not be making this recipe again.

A really fine soup woth a wonderful fresh taste: it is really a potage parmentier with some asparagus, carrot, and spinach added.  You can vary the proportions depending on which flavor you want to be dominant.  I find it doesn't need any rice because the potatoes add enough starch, and although the heavy cream tastes nice, most of us are better off with something less fatty and caloric.  Personally I just like to intensify the veggie flavors by adding garlic and parsley.  But it's a great recipe and I've had lots of fun with it this spring.  Thank you Papergoddess.

I also used chicken broth in place of 1/2 the water.  Because of that I added only 1 tsp of salt.  It was very yummy and fresh tasting.  I also added evaporated milk instead of cream (because that is what I had.  Very Yummy Potato soup, with extra veggies.!!

This was an absolutely delicious soup and a breeze to make.  I followed the recipe pretty closely but added some black pepper.  Both my husband and I loved it well enough for a repeat performance.

I made this soup last night for dinner with a salad and rolls.  

I'v made it for years, but I use chicken stock inplace of the water.  I also add garlic and fresh parsley.  I have never used heavy cream, I use a mixture of 1/2 & 1/2 and milk.  
Last night I used kale in place of the spinach, it's all I had on hand.

Delicious!  I made a low-carb version without the rice or potatoes, and just used extra asparagus and carrots instead.  I added some veggie bouillon cubes and garlic.

LOVED this soup! So did everyone else who tried it. I did only use milk instead of cream. I also substituted the butter for some margarine and water. I added garlic, mushrooms and some chicken bouillon cubes. Will be making again. Thanks for the great recipe!

Great soup on this beautiful Spring day.  After reading other reviews, I too, used chicken broth (3 cans plus about 1 cup of concentrated stock I made myself) along with 2 cups of water.  I added  2 teaspoons of jarred minced garlic to the leek and onion sautee. Followed the rest of the recipe as written until the end where  I used half and half rather than heavy cream and added a few sprigs of fresh rosemary and a fresh bayleaf.  I also added some leftover cooked chicken.  Can't say this was lacking flavor at all. Will make this again.

This is a great recipe, and very flexible. I halved the recipe, doubled the onion because I did not have any leeks, added three cloves of roasted garlic, replaced asparagus with green beans(again, what I had on hand), used broth in place of the water(and reduced the salt to compensate), and had to use whole milk in place of cream. Even with all these changes it was delicious and I will be making this soup often. I'm sure as written is great too, and will hopefully try it that way when I make it next. Just wanted to say it's very versatile and thanks for sharing this recipe!

Delicious soup!  I was worried there wouldn't be enough flavor, but it was to die for - the way it's prepared really brought out the flavors of the fresh veggies.  I substituted vegetable broth for the water, and added 2 cloves of minced garlic but otherwise I left the recipe alone.  I will make this again and again!

Delightful soup.  Helped use up good groceries before going out of town for Mothers Day weekend.  Vegatable stock in freezer was the base, used less than 1/2 tsp of salt, but added 2 cloves of garlic when sweating the onions.  Added a drop of Red Hot & a sprinkle of Montreal Chix seasoning just before serving.   Used about 1/4  cup of 1/2 & 1/2--just enough to for a light finish.

This was YUMMY! I made a couple of changes as other users did: 16 oz of water and 16 oz of chicken broth. I added 3 large cloves of garlic and chopped the spinach prior to adding it. I allowed it to simmer to close to 40 minutes then added the cream and spinach. I added a loaf of Rosemary herb bread on the side and it was to die for. This one will be made again and again. We froze the leftovers, hoping they are as good the second time around! BRAVO!

Has a very fresh and light spring taste. I added the potatoes, cooked for ten minutes, then added the carrots, asparagus and rice so as to not over cook the asparagus. I used half and half water and chicken broth and no extra salt. My fiance loved this with fresh baked bread!

Great soup.  The only thing I did different was that I added Better Than Bouillon Chicken Base to the water.  If you do this, you will need to cut back on the salt or even omit it.

this is my favorite soup now! I didn't follow the recipe exactly though, I used chicken broth instead of water and only put enough to cover the vegetables in the pan. LOVE IT!

This turned out to be an excellent soup although I ended up changing it up according to what I had on hand and to my tastes.  Here's what I did: 
I didn't have the asparagus so I chopped up 3 celery heart sticks and added a huge clove of minced elephant garlic. I fried it and the carrots with the leeks and onions. Since we're "mostly vegan" I didn't have butter and cream, but I had some gee(clarified butter) left from some Indian recipe I did and I used a thick coconut cream that doesn't have a coconut flavour. I used brown rice, less salt, added fresh sprigs of thyme and rosemary, and fresh black pepper(I tied the herbs and pulled them out before eating). I used chopped frozen spring spinach and put in a 1/2 cup of corn that I had leftover from dinner the night before. Like with most recipes, I used this one as a jumping off point and made it my own the result was fabulous!

I really enjoyed this recipe, however I made a two changes, first, I didn't have asparagus, so I used Kale instead and in place of the spinach.  Second, instead of heavy cream I used Kefir (original flavor, cultured milk smoothie).  It came out very good and full of flavor.

I had high hopes for this recipe.  I had leeks and asparagus to use up, and instead of the regular cream of asparagus soup, I tried this, since it sounded different and had the potential for being nice and tasty.  Unfortunately, this was extremely bland, with minimal flavor, even though I followed the recipe exactly (unusual for me).  I am still at a loss for how to "fix" this, so will probably not make this again.  It is probably a very good soup, true to its roots, but just not our cup of tea.  Sorry -

YUMMM!  I too subbed low fat chicken broth for water, skipped the rice and added zucchini since I had some.  I also subbed fat free half and half for the cream to reduce the fat content.  VERY VERY GOOD !  Will definitely make again. thank you

This recipe makes a colorful bowl of soup, but it's just not that flavorful.  As suggested by others, I used chicken broth in place of the water and added some garlic.  After tasting it, I added a Fines Herbes blend (thyme, oregano, sage, rosemary, parsley).  The soup did not thicken despite having both potatoes and rice.  I would recommend using just one starch, potatoes, and adding extra potatoes to thicken if possible.  I did not add the full half pound of spinach...I just stopped when it seemed about right.  This makes a large pot of soup, and unfortunately, no one is too excited about the leftovers.

This has become our favorite soup, and my son and daughter HATE spinach and asparagus!  They both say that when the two go together it reminds them of broccoli.  Whatever it is, the soup tastes great!  We fought over who got the last bowl full!

Oh my gosh, so delicious. The only thing I changed was fat free half and half for the heavy cream, and olive oil in place of the butter (to save  few cal's). Thanks Papergoddess for such a simple and tasty recipe.

I made this using watercress instead of spinach, and light chicken broth instead of water.  I also reduced the salt to 1 teaspoon, and added about a cup of diced smoked ham, and a teaspoon of red chili flakes for a touch of spice. The resulting soup was more hearty than the original recipe, and served with hot bread, was substantial enough to be a meal in itself, yet not heavy on the digestion. Delicious!

This is very nice to make when asparagus is in season; however, I am not a big fan of creamy soups, and I just couldn't stomach the idea of the heavy cream.  I substituted a can of Cream of Asparagus soup for the cream and some chicken broth for some of the water.  We thought it had very good flavor when made this way.

This recipe deserves its 5 stars. As several point out, it is better to use broth or stock. It enriches the recipe. In fact I tried it with half water and half broth and it came out fabulous. Please if you think heavy cream is not your deal, the other options suggested such as evaporated milk and half and half will work just as good but with slightly different results in texture. Use whichever you feel you would be more agreeable with rather than giving a bad review to a recipe that is excellent. If you have too many qualms about calories,fat and cream STAY AWAY FROM FRENCH FOOD and don't trash it for that. French food has all those elements in it and that is what makes it French besides techniques. There are plenty of substitutions for the "greasy" ingredients of the French cuisine, try them and suit the recipe to your taste. It is possible to make French food "lighter" there are plenty of books on the matter, but nothing like trying it as is and then changing it. French food is not for anybody who feels guilt for the fact of eating.

I liked this soup and it seems very healthy.  I used more potato and skipped the rice.  I blended the soup before adding the asparagus and spinach.  I also feared it'd be blanded based on the reviews but I went overboard and put too much thyme in.  I think next time I'll stick with salt and pepper because there are lots of different flavors from coming from the numerous veggies.  I froze some will blend it all again once defrosted (as seen from a previous review) and might add some parmesan cheese.

This was simply delicious !  I try not to change recipes too much, but knowing our tastes... I had to substitute the water for homemade chicken broth.  I also added 3 garlic cloves, minced and 1 extra bunch of asparagus (we love it).  Also, julienned a sweet red pepper for a beautiful "pop" of color.   I made a double batch to freeze some for later, as I knew it would be a hit.  topped with fresh grated cheddar & served with warm crusty bread.  Decadent :)

This was delicious! The neighbours and severl friends have asked for the recipe. Living in algeria where aspargus isnt produced I had to improvise and used fresh garden peas and a tiny bit of bottled asparagus. The only thing I will change is the rice....I think having potatoes and rice in the same soup is a bit much....Thank you for such a good recipe!!

This was very good and I will make it again; however, if you look at the ingredients there is no seasoning other than some salt.  It was very very bland (and I had even replaced half the water with chicken broth).  I suggest, at the very least, adding garlic, lots and lots of pepper, and more salt at the end.  I also added the juice of half a lemon.  For me, topping it with some grated parmesan made it.  UPDATE:  Leftovers did not freeze well.  The cream separated, the potatoes took on a weird texture, etc.  Put it in the blender and it came out like a thick creamy soup, almost like split pea soup... and now I think I like it even better than the original!!

I thought this was pretty good! A great way to get your veggies! I also added a can of garbonzo beans for some protien and used brown rice. I used all water, but then a couple cubes of chicken boullion and only needed to add 2t salt. Yummy.

Seemed very bland - I replaced half of the water with chicken stock, added about a half tsp of freshly shredded ginger, 1/2 tsp of tarragon and planed a half clove of garlic into it, also added pepper.

Earlier reviews say this gets more flavorful after it sits, so we'll see if I overdid it.

I just made this soup for the first time and it was amazing. Creamy without feeling heavy, it really hit the spot.

Like other reviewers, I mixed 1/2 water and 1/2 chicken broth for the liquid element. You could easily use all chicken broth or vegetable broth to the same effect. Delicious!

Great combo-- Rather than garlic or mushrooms I added bayleaf(very French) and I had arborio rice on hand and of course the broth for flavor-- thanks for a great soup recipe!

I used margarine at first but it was very bland so I added butter. It was really bland still, I even used chicken broth. I felt like I added a lot of salt, but once I added the spinach and cream, it was terrific:)

Delicious!  I only made a few changes, just added some fresh-minced garlic to the onions and leeks, and once they were translucent, I added a heaping Tbsp of Ultragrain (Eagle Mills Brand) flour.  Instead of water, used 1 qt of organic mushroom broth and 1 qt of organic veggie broth.  Used a 1/2 cup of uncooked long-grain brown rice instead of 1/3 of white.  We ate it with multigrain ciabatta rolls.  Yum!  Really rich if you make with cream.  Next time, may just try soymilk, as the dairy can be a problem for us & our digestive systems.  Loved the spinach in it!  We just ate the last two bowls and it was even better (made it a few days ago) with time.

Fantastic soup.  Like others, I switched out the water for chicken stock.  The blend of flavors was subtle and balanced and so flavorful that I did not add any salt...it didn't need it.  Making it again tonight.

Half my family liked this and the other half didn't. Most didn't like it because of the cream broth. I did like this. The flavor blended well. It was a great way to get the veggies in.

After reading some of the other reviews, I subbed chicken broth for the water, to reduce the fat, I subbed half and half for the cream.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly as written, and it was a winner...really very delicious.  I tasted like a restaurant-quality dish and looked with it as well when garnished with grated cheese and a sprinkle of fresh herbs.  My fiancee and children loved it too.  Definitely a keeper!

YUM!!! This is a great soup recipe! I added a little garlic and black pepper, and I also had to use broccoli instead of asparagus since that is what I had. Fantastic!

This is a great recipe. I have been using it for years. Word for word, from the NY Times cook book. It has been a staple in my house. For it ease and the  beautiful aroma  the soup breings to the house on cool spring day. The only thing I've changed  was to add Veggi Cubes to the plain water, and at times use wild rice.

Yum! A vegetarian's dream. It's a very good use of the spring veggies.I followed the recipe exactly except for substituting half and half. If you are veg, but don't do dairy, rice milk would probably be okay. The potatoes help keep it thick. Enjoy!

I put the soup together in about 30 minutes.  It cooked for about 45 minutes after my prep.  I used canned asparagus and omitted the carrots.  I also doubled the rice.  Served with some parmesan cheese on top and am eating it for lunch right now.

Wow!  We loved this!  I did use only chicken stock and no water.  I also added cut up cooked chicken tenders.  I added grated fresh garlic in with the onions and leeks.  I used half and half instead of cream.  I also added several seasonings-salt, white pepper, Red Robin seasoning, garlic powder, and lemon pepper.  I also added a few dashes of hot sauce. I didn't alter the veggies that I used.  I used exactly what was written.  I only subbed baby carrots as the grocery didn't have any big ones.  I also used more rice than recommended.  It made the soup thicker.  I was awesome though, I must say.  I made Italian bread to go with it.  from this site (Italian Bread Using the Bread Machine).  Everything was yummy and I felt good about eating all of those veggies!  Leeks are one of the healthies things you can eat!  We will be eating this at least once a month!  thanks.

This is a very good, nourishing soup, and worth all the chopping. Even though it lacks a meat, my husband just loves it! I too followed the 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 water combo and added about a tsp. of white pepper. Wonderful! Thank you!

This is my favorite soup of all time. I believe it's the cream that gives the soup its unique flavor. I cannot get enough, and I am thrilled that my birthday is in Spring so I can enjoy this dish as a birthday lunch or dinner (or both).

Both my meat-lover boyfriend and I loved this light but complex veggie soup. The asparagus and spinach make a delicious combination and the potatoes make it hearty. Following the suggestions here I used a combination of chicken and vegetable broth instead of the water. I added the cream at the end, and I think it certainly adds another layer to this soup so I wouldn't skip it. Also sprinkled it generously with cheese. Will get a nice crusty bread for the leftovers for tomorrow. Next time I make this I think I'll up the rice a bit so that it's noticable. With these changes it is an amazing restaurant quality recipe.

I quite liked this. It was quick & easy to make. I didn't add any asparagus and reduced the salt to 1 teaspoon as 4 teaspoons would have been way too much. Next time I will add some extra rice as it kind of got lost in the liquid.

DELICIOUS!  Sooooo good with no more seasoning added.  The perfect word to describe it is fresh.  I was a little sceptical, but its delicious.  I halved the recipe and used fat free evaporated milk rather than cream.  Will definately make many more times!!

Made this soup last night.  Nice flavor but seemed to be missing something, not sure what.  Recipe makes a lot and probably doesn't freeze well with potatoes in it.  I may or may not make it again, haven't decided.

This was great.  I used baby spinach and I think next time I will give it a quick chop so that it is more in proportion to the rest of the soup.  I'll also cut the asparagus a little smaller.  I would love to know if this would work with evaporated skim milk or something of the sort to cut out that evil cream!  If anyone tries it, please post the results!

This is a wonderful soup.  My office raved, especially as the aroma wafted from my microwaved daily ration.  I did substitute half-n-half for the heavy cream (and wonder if fat-free evap milk might work as well...).  I also wonder if other veggies could work (zuchini?  corn?  peas?)  Just don't omit the leeks .... they are, I suspect, the secret to the fabulous smell and taste.  I was also intrigued by the fact that no seasoning, other than salt, appears in this recipe ... it's all veggie taste!  Fabulous!!

I liked the variety of vegetables in this soup which made it sound healthy (if you don't look at the butter and heavy cream!)  When I tasted it after it had cooked it definately needed some more flavoring, so I added chicken stock granules.  Next time I make it I will use some stock cubes at the beginning and cut the salt.

Thank you for sharing this recipe.  Thank you to all the advice on how to improve it.  Between the original recipe and the advice on how to adjust it....I finally have a soup that my mother in law likes.  Finally!!    I use half and half instead of heavy cream.  I use half the butter.  I added garlic and a table spoon of chicken broth.

What a great way to get lots of healthy veggies in one serving!  This soup was fantastic and I will definitely make it again.  The only change that I made this time was to add 3 tbsp of Better Than Bouillon vegetable stock.   Next time, I will throw in some mushrooms.  I think they'd go nicely with this recipe.

I love this soup! I added the potatoes first and simmered for about 8 minutes then added the remaining veggies. The potatoes broke down nicely and thickened the broth. This is just sooooo good.

I made this soup this morning following some of the recommendations.  I added a good dollop of roasted chicken base and a garlic clove.  I wanted a creamier soup, without adding cream.  So I added a little half and half and used the immersion blender for about half of the veggies.

This was delicious, and just right for a cold and rainy spring evening.  After reading all the reviews, I did add fresh garlic with the onions and I used 1/2 chicken stock and 1/2 water.  I used 1/2 the salt and added a pinch or marjoram and thyme.  I will make this again.

Oh, my - this is as yummy as I thought it would be. Per one of the reviews I read, I used some chicken stock as a substitute for part of the water. The directions aren't terribly specific on chopping the vegetables but it doesn't matter really - just chop them to the size you prefer. This would probably also be delicious if blended together with an immersion blender, minus the spinach perhaps. Enjoy!

We love this soup! I made it a lot in the spring and I can't wait to make it again when spring comes. I didn't change anything.

Delish! I used vegetable stock and added kale instead of spinach. I also added garlic when sautéing the leeks and used a mixed wild rice.

Soup was only ok.  The veggies were fine, but the broth tasted like watered down heavy cream (which it is).  I probably won't make this again, but if I do, I'll go with chicken broth instead or water (and less cream).

I'm a soup fiend and I love this soup! I added 7 tsp of better than bouillon chicken stock, garlic, red onion, garlic powder, celery, celery salt, chopped dried chives and dill. I meant to add corn but forgot. I will make this often!

I am making this soup for the third time because it is such a great hit.  I add garlic to the onions and leaks, use chicken broth instead of water, omit the salt and add fresh sliced mushrooms when I add the cream and spinich. Today I have added 1 cup of rice instead of 1/3 cup which makes for a thicker soup.

This is a very nice and filling soup, if a bit bland. I split the amount of potatoes to 1/2 parsnips, and added a little fresh thyme. It was a great way to thin out the leeks in my small garden. A little white wine would also probably perk up the soup.

Delicious! I used 1/2 chicken stock and 1/2 water and added the asparagus with about 10 minutes to go before adding the spinach and cream. This makes a lot, but it's worth it-seconds and thirds will be had and leftovers will be appreciated!

Good recipe - rich and flavorful.  I added a couple cloves of garlic with the onions as others suggested, used veggie stock instead of water, and whole milk instead of the cream.  I was also using leftover, cooked asparagus, so I added it at the end with the spinach and cream.

This was wonderful! I did use chicken broth instead of water, as many suggested, and doubled the onion as I did not have leeks. I used frozen spinach ( all I had) and think the texture would have been much better with fresh, but the taste was still excellent! My son asked for the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.. going to have to make this again soon!

I just love this soup, would have never thought this combination would work, but it is lovely. I did take a couple of previous reviewers suggestions. I used half chicken broth for the liquid (free-range, which I feel is more favorful). I also used half-n-half instead of full cream, it was very creamy. And I added a teaspoon or so of garlic powder. Yummm. I had three bowls the first day and have lunch during the week.

This is a fantastic, flavorful, light soup! Only changes made: used all chicken broth vs water, left out the potatoes (didn't have any on hand), and used half-n-half instead of heavy cream (didn't have any in the fridge). Only used 3 tsps sea salt and about 1 tsp of Herbs de Provence. Thank you for a delicious recipe!

This is a great soup! I seasoned it with seasoning salt, rosemary and majoram, to taste, used half chicken broth (as many other reviews suggested), subbed arborio for the white rice, and used half and half instead of heavy cream. It was a hit, very fresh tasting and flavourful. I can't wait to have the leftovers.

This recipe was SOOO good!  A word of caution- make sure you use a LARGE pot - like the type you use for making large quantities of spaghetti sauce or chicken broth.  I simmered mine for probably an hour vs. the recommended 30 minutes because my company was running late and so the volume reduced enough for the last minute addition of spinach and half and half (which I substituted for cream).  I would definitely make this again.

This was delicious!!!  I did add some chicken boullion to the water when it started to boil.  I didn't have a whole bunch of spinach so I added some kale as well.  Next time I might do without the rice though, it just seemed unneeded.  This makes a bunch so be prepared for left overs!  Thanks so much!

I'm not sure why this soup didn't have more flavor.  I substituted most of the water with chicken broth and added garlic to the onion and leeks.  I didn't add any rice since the potato was starch enough.  It tasted okay just not worth trying again, although plenty healthy.

This was great!  Love it for anytime but it is a GREAT spring soup. It is awesome exactly as the recipe instructs it to be made. I substituted vegetarian chicken broth. Other then the vegitarian substitution the first time I made it I thought I had heavy cream in the house but when it came time to add it I found out I did not, so I substituted Cream Cheese (the 1/3 less fat kind). It was very good that way.  My husband said he liked it even more when he found out it was low in fat. The way with the cream is also delicious.

Great soup. Use creme fraiche instead of cream and vegetable stock rather then chicken stock so that vegetarians can enjoy as well.

We're giving it 5 stars as we added made some VERY healthy changes thus making it completely GUILT FREE!  Okay: omit the cream, omit the butter...not needed. Saute the leeks in extra virgin Olive oil and you're good to go.  Make ALL water chicken stock (we used veggie chicken stock - amazing and a lot less sodium!)  No extra salt needed, but add some black pepper for some zip.    Thank you Papergoddess for a great recipe!  We're full, we're happy and can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow!

I made this recipe exactly as written and give it 5 stars. It's always nice to 'improve' any soup by adding chicken broth and garlic but this is meant to be how it is. The taste of the fresh asparagus is so nicely enhanced by the butter and leeks. This is a subtle dish but heavenly. Absolutely, a perfect Spring Soup!

Top notch, just as it is.  My husband (2nd time around) used to be married to a gourmet cook, so he's used to terrific dishes. I hate cooking, but I can read and follow a recipe. :)  We both loved this soup. A LOT!

This soup was wonderful! Like so many other soups, it was best as leftovers after sitting a few days in the fridge. The only thing that I changed was to use a small can of evaporated milk for the cream, and then add a bit of potato starch for thickener. I will definitely make it again!

I made this soup for supper tonight - and did make some modifications after reading some reviews. I used 1 1/2 quarts of chicken broth (instead of the water), and added lots of pepper, garlic powder (about 1/2 tsp), and Old Bay seasoning (I used 1/2 tsp - but could have added more - you could use any seasoning mixture). I used light  instead of heavy cream, and also added 1 cup of skim milk (since I reduced the amount of liquid to cook the vegetables). It was very good - and I'll be making again.

I made this yesterday four our Sunday soup lunch. As we are only 2 people, I used only about half of the ingredients. Instead of water I used vegetable broth and what I got was fantastic fingerlicking good. My wife also was excited about the taste of it. And it's ready within a short time. I definetely make this again. Thanks to Sanzoe for sharing this great recipe.

This is a fairly good soup but more of a base. It is lacking in flavor.  I made as is to give it a fair chance and after tasting ended up adding garlic and some other seasoning blends I had on hand.  If I make it again I will use chicken broth instead of the plain water I also might admit the cream since it didn't add anything to it in my opinion.

I made this soup yesterday and it turned out pretty well, despite the fact that I overcooked the vegetables and undercooked the rice.  I used brown rice because that's what I had, but I foolishly added it at the same time as the vegetables.  

I think I'd like to try this with coconut milk next time.

This soup was delightful! I used half the spinach called for because my soup kettle was getting a little full, but I don't think it took away from the flavour at all.  I also used 50/50 stock and water and found it quite rich enough.  I would cut back on the salt though, particularly if you are using prepared chicken stock. I'll be passing this recipe along to my friends and family, especially now that spring has arrived.

I give this a 4-  because it has potential and I will try it again changing the order of operations of cooking and reducing the broth/water amount.  I took seriously the other reviews that said it was bland and mushy.  I added celery, garlic, tarragon, oregano, and crushed fennel seed and salt and pepper.  Next time I will start this soup by sauteing all the large-chopped veggies in the butter with the fennel, tarragon, and oregano, with salt, pepper, garlic, until the  potatoes are just fork tender. Then add the broth/water amount I need for one cup of rice ( I want a slightly soupy rice when rice is close to done) then I will add chopped baby spinach, stir in 1/2 cup - 1 cup tempered cream (I used 1/2 n 1/2) along with a light misting of ground white pepper  and let thicken.   The leeks and onions meld around the potatoes in a lovely sweet manner and it really is a subtly warm and sweet soup that goes awesome with a hearty brown bread,  the sauce just needs a better consistency (soupy rice) around the chunky veggies.

This is perfect and delicious as is! Remember to rinse leeks very very thoroughly to avoid sand in the soup.

This soup was very bland until I added some cut up summer sausage to it for flavor.  I think it would benefit to fry up some bacon with the leeks and onions.

I too love this soup but also made some slight changes.  I added a can of chicken broth and garlic as well pus some shredded, cooked chicken to the recipe and omitted the starches (rice/potato) due to dieting.

As suggested, I cut the water in half and put in 4 cups of chicken stock (no salt addd) instead.

I added a bunch of italian seasoning and pepper to add to the flavor. 

I think next time I will add 2 potatoes only, and a box of mushrooms.

I halved the recipe for just two people, but we loved the flavors and figured it would be a good base to add perhaps seafood to make it a full meal.  After reading other comments, I too added a clove of garlic and having no leaks, used garden chives.  I also left out the rice and salt and substituted vegetable broth for water. Seemed to be salty enough for our taste.

I followed the ingredients with the exception of the spinach. I found the soup broth needed some flavor. I added lemon pepper, cumin and curry which helped a lot. Now it is a keeper.

This tastes so good.  I added Better Than  Bullion to the water after I added it to the vegetables.  The flavor is out of the world.  I love the fresh vegetables they add so much flavor.  I also used evaporated milk instead of cream or half and half.  That saves on calories and fat grams.  Easy and fast to throw together for a impromptu dinner party.  I will make again and again.

I made a few changes. Had no heavy cream and substituted coconut milk. Since I was using coconut milk, I substituted coconut oil. I used a curry rub as spice and a vegetarian bullion cube.

I used low sodium chicken broth instead of water and 1 1/4 cups of potato flakes for a thickener with flavor instead of potatoes and didn't use the rice.  My friends raved about it and I've made it several times.  Looking forward to making it next month for my bridge group.  Will serve with cheddar biscuits.

This soup was very tasty. Thanks for the recipe. I sauteed some fresh mushrooms with the leeks as I had some to use up.  Seasoned with salt but not the 4 tsps called for in the recipe, I'm thinking this must have been a typo. I added dill and garlic for extra flavour  and I used kale instead of spinach as we prefer this. Also did 1/2 water and 1/2 chicken stock as other reviewers suggested.

I made this soup because I love veggies and I love soup.  The flavor was really delicious. I do suggest using chicken stock. I needed to season even with the stock.  I also emulsified it at the end for a creamier texture.  I would definitly make it again.

I used half grape seed oil, half clarifying butter (instead of all butter). I also added Zucchini and use all organic chicken stock instead of water. Use nonfat milk, organic spinach, and add some nutritional yeast at the end.

I read all the reviews and no one did what I did and I think it came out great! I pureed 2/3ish of the veggies including all the potato to make the broth nice and flavorful and a beautiful shade of light orange.  Then returned pot to stove and added the spinach, coconut milk (dairy free girl), and the tops of the asparagus.  yummy!!

I expected so much more from a soup with such a high rating. I found it to be bland, overly sweet, and just desperate for some acid. Still a hearty soup chock full of veggies, hence 3 stars and not less. But I had to add some herbs and white wine vinegar to make it enjoyable.

Definitely a great spring soup.  I used veggie stock instead of water and added a few cloves of garlic.  Add a bit of pepper and some Parmesan to taste.

I love the idea of a vegetable-heavy soup but the taste was pretty weak even with changes. I added four cloves of garlic, used low-salt chicken stock instead of water, 2 bay leaves, and chopped fresh thyme. I am hoping that the flavors will intensify after a night in the frig.

This vegetable spring soup is so delicious, wonderfully easy and relatively healthy comfort food.   I chose to do 1 quart water/1 quart chicken broth for extra flavor.   Awesome decision.   I only ended up using 1/2 c. of heavy cream and found that to be the perfect amount where it was still a broth, but not a clear broth soup.   I can see that you vary the vegetable to mix it up.   Great recipe!!!

This soup was so tasty! I cook for a family who have a lot of food allergies and always have to modify recipes.  It needed to be dairy free, so I added about 1/2 cup of  full fat coconut milk at the very end.  Because I love the taste of tarragon, I also added fresh chopped tarragon.  I pureed a few cups to give the broth a silky and thick (and very filling) consistency.

Despite using chicken broth and garlic as others suggested, this was really bland. I added basil, thyme, and more salt which helped a little. Disappointed. Won't make again.

This recipe seemed very simple and for me the end result lacked flavor. I cook vegetarian so used vegetable stock instead of chicken stock. However I felt it needed more salt and some flavor from spices. I added paprika, oregano and thyme. But still a good basic recipe. I recommend tweaking it to up the seasoning!

I took the suggestions of half chicken stock, garlic and pepper.  This is similar to a potato leek soup I make, but with the added goodness of spinach, asparagus and carrots!

It was a lot more watery then I expected. Next time I'm going to do 75% liquid, all chicken stock, and add some garlic powder or garlic salt.

AMAZING. This soup, a loaf of crusty bread, and a bottle of wine is my perfect meal.  I added a few tsp of chicken bullion powder to the water but otherwise made no changes. Perfection.

Loved this soup. I used chicken stock instead of water. All the beggies tasted wonderful together. Never cooked with leeks before, thay added to the soup.  Added asparagus and spinach at the end so they would be less soggy.

I’ve made this every year in the springtime for at least 5 years now, and it’s always delicious. I do add some veggie bouillon, but it my opinion you don’t want to “spice it up” too much because you’ll overpower the lovely flavors of the asparagus, leeks, etc. Initially I made the recipe as directed, but have switched to making it vegan since that first time. Tastes just as great! You honestly don’t need the creme. And then I use vegan butter, and voila! Oh and I also stopped adding any rice because it’s already starchy enough with the potatoes.

I doubled the recipe and made a couple small changes: 1) Added about 5 teaspoons of better-than-bouillon no-chicken base; 2) added pepper along with the salt; and 3) used an immersion blender for a few seconds to partially puree before adding the cream and spinach.  It turned out fairly bland, but it was salvageable!  It may sound odd, but adding drops of sriracha to taste upon serving really pulled it together.  I will make this again because I love to get all these great veggies in a creamy soup.  Next time I will probably omit a potato or two, will salt more liberally, try and use a good quality stock for some of the liquid, and add a pinch of crushed red pepper before simmering to get the hint of heat (without resorting to sriracha at the table!).  I also like other reviewers' idea of adding thyme, so may experiment with that.

It was awesome, even my kids who don't like vegs, loved it. I followed other reviewers advice and used some chicken broth in place of water. Skipped the leeks as I didn't have any. And I added some rotisserie chicken (for the hubby's protein fix). I only added one breast, should have added both. Wish I had added another bundle of asparagus. The soup alone filled up the whole family (of 4).

This was delicious!  I made a few adjustments...  I added 1/2 c. chicken broth to give it a little more richness.  Also added more salt and freshly ground pepper because potatoes need this seasoning to give it fullness.  It was a great recipe.  Very fresh for Spring!

Needs other spices.  I'd also reduce the salt to 3 tsp.  Added a tsp of garlic powder and a tsp of finely ground pepper.

Wife also suggested that I cook half of the potatoes separately and then blend them up to add to the soup and thicken it.

l'd probably make it again with these changes.

Thou shalt make this soup.  It is divine.  Like others, I substituted chicken broth for the water.  I cut back a bit on the salt, and was glad I did.  I also blended half in the blender.  The flavor is  outstanding.  The consistency is silky.  Serve with some crusty bread, and it's a meal.  I've had it three days in a row, and will continue until it's gone.  Then, I will make it again soon.  It's that good.

Very good with some changes, otherwise I think it would have been fairly bland.  used low sodium chicken broth, black pepper, a little paprika. Added two diced chicken breasts. Used milk instead of cream.  Used canellini beans instead of rice.

this is pretty  good. I did make some changes similar to what others have done. I also did 50/50 chicken broth and water. I cut the salt in half. After I added the spinach and cream (I used coconut milk creamer, by the way), I seasoned that  with some minced garlic, lemon pepper, and ground pepper. I wasn't expecting it to turn out as well as it did to be honest.

Absolutely amazing! As the other reviews stated.. I went 50/50 but instead of using chicken broth, I used vegetable. I also used half and half instead and increased the veggie amount just a bit. This will definitely be a soup I will be making every spring to welcome it. ????

This was a great meal. Though I personally changed the water and heavy cream ratio and instead 1/3 cup rice I did 1 cup rice simply because I wanted less liquid.

Loved this soup.  I did half chicken both and  half beef both.  (Low sodium).  No potatoes (less carbs) and only used 1/2 cup of heavy cream.  If I wasn't on a diet I'd use the whole cup.  Still delicious.  Everyone loved it!

We made this and it made a lot.  I was worried that I was going to have too much but we did finish it up in less then a week. There was a good amount of work involved in making in but that only involves chopping veggies. I would say if you are a fan of veggie soups, then this recipe is for you!

Very good flavored, fresh, spring, soup, but way, way too salty. Will make again, but cut the salt in half, if not more.

If  you understand going into it that it will be on the bland side, but realize it is a way to have a lot of vegetables, it's great. It will suit me for lunch all week for sure.

This is one of the best soup recipes I have ever made!!! I doubled the recipe and it made far more than I needed, so I shared it with 3 friends who all love it too (and now have the recipe)!  I did use 3/4 chicken broth and I also added two tsp. of garlic.   Yum!  It was creamy without feeling too heavy.

This might be the best soup I have ever made, and I make a fair amount of soup.  Followed recipe exactly except that I only had about 5 oz. of spinach.  It was wonderful and my husband loved it too.

Very good!  I added 2 cloves of garlic and mushrooms to the butter mix wiith salt and pepper.  I used chicken stock instead of water and added chopped red pepper. I added the asparagus in the  last hour of cooking with the spinach and used minute made basamati rice also added in the last hour with more salt and pepper.

I also added chicken broth in place of water, as well as garlic and fresh mushrooms. Yummy. There are so many things you could add to enhance this soup, but you don't need to.

This recipe is brilliant. I made a few additions, similar to others:  for more flavour I added some crushed garlic, used vegetable stock instead of water and added some dried French herbs before simmering. I also doubled the amount of rice for more texture. I disagree with the others here - using double cream made this soup beautifully luxurious. Keep the potato pieces quite large so they don't get mushy during cooking:  into 8-12 pieces per potato works well.

Make that rating five stars times two.  This was one of the best, most intensely flavored vegetable-based soups I've ever made-and I am a soup aficionado! 
I replaced some water with 1 quart of a home made chicken stock, added a couple of large mushrooms chopped but made no other changes. I froze most of the soup saving  a bowl for the next days lunch.  For the second bowl I added some cooked chicken breast to make it a complete meal. I also added some Parmesan cheese-the real stuff folks not the stuff in the can-and can't tell you how incredibly delicious that was. I might note that I completely forgot to add the cream in both instances but don't think I will in the future because the soup is so intensely flavored I don't want to soften the flavor with cream.
A glass of good Riesling and some crusty bread and you've got yourself a very healthy easy to make dinner.

I tried this recipe because I had asparagus and didn't want to deal with a blender/purée sort of step. This was delicious! Using regular water,l works wonderfully and is a nice budget-friendly option!

very fresh and appealing soup. I added some rosemary, basil and tarragon and used chick stock. I also cut the fat way down by using fat free half and half instead of heavy cream.

Made it with a few small changes - kale instead of spinach, half-n-half instead of cream, extra leeks instead of onions, and rainbow carrots (which gave the broth a purplish color). I also added sprigs of fresh thyme and rosemary because we had them on hand. 

The soup is absolutely beautiful and tastes fancy despite being really simple to make. The hardest part is peeling & cutting veggies. The kids all cleaned their bowls and asked that I save the recipe. 

Given the delicate taste and the easily-obtainable ingredients, I'll definitely make this again.

When I got married in 1969, I got a cookbook as a gift. This recipe was in it. I have made it over and over again for many years always to rave reviews. I am about to make it again just having bought all the ingredients. It is healthful and delicious. It is and has been a go-to recipe for a very long time! I make it with water and find is very satisfying and flavorful!

This soups is fabulous!  The weather always turns cool around Easter and this is the perfect soup for spring time.  I added left over rotisserie chicken and a splash of white wine and served it with crusty wheat bread.  My whole family was raving over it!

I was shocked to read how many cooks substituted onions for leeks. These vegetables are not interchangable in French cooking. Only changes were broth over water, whole milk instead of cream, added mushrooms as suggested because it sounded great and 1/2'd the spinach because I felt there was plenty going on already with flavor.  It isn't a super spicy dish, but actually quite light for a creamy soup.  Served with a grilled steak salad and rustic bread.  Only 4 stars because of all the changes.

Made this for my group of college students, without the asparagus, because there was none in season and I didn't want to use canned. It's just as well that I didn't, though, because this was really thick, despite using extra broth on top of the water.

This was pretty darn tasty.  I usually don't rate a recipe unless I've made it exactly as written, but I think this one was fine as is, but better with some of the recommendations.    I started out adding a clove of minced fresh garlic to the onion and leeks. I also sauteed in 1/2 butter and 1/2 Italian olive oil.  Using vegetable broth instead of plain water, I added all the fresh veggies I had which was everything called for plus green beans, mushrooms, cauliflower and broccoli. I started the carrots, potatoes and rice first for 15 minutes.  I used a short grain rice and put in more than was called for.  After the 15 minutes, I started adding in the other veggies in order of most dense to least dense.    I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream.  After I added the spinach, I turned off the heat and the spinach wilted without further cooking.  After it was done, it seemed to be missing something so I added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to brighten it up and a teaspoon of dry mustard.    This is a hit and it will be one of my "go to" soups this winter.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Tasted great! I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using beef broth (cubes) instead of plain water, adding fat-free half & half instead of heavy cream, and added garlic when cooking the onion/leek. With a little extra salt, it tasted absolutely perfect!

Great soup! I used chicken broth for half the water and felt it needed more salt in the end.  All my guests raved about it!

This is a nice vegetable soup that's fairly easy to make. I made a few minor changes: subbed coconut milk for cream, quinoa for rice, and olive oil for butter, and per other reviews I used broth (veg) instead of water. Next time, I'll add more asparagus; it added a great flavor.

I give this only 3 stars as I made it exactly as described and it was only "edible" at best. The only thing different was that I had no asparagus so I omitted it, but I'm not sure how much that would have changed the outcome for me. This tasted like salty milk with cooked veggies. The kids wouldn't eat it. I plan to try this again, but will DEFINITELY use broth instead of water. I felt the need for it while making it as the veggies were swimming in salt water, but really wanted to be true to the recipe my first time out. I really think that will be the "make it" or "break it" for this recipe.

Took me significantly longer to chop the vegetables. I did not add the garlic that other reviewers suggested but did use half chicken broth. Needs something. I tried adding cheese in the bowls but that's not it. The next day slightly improved as others have noted. Maybe adding slightly less water and a can of cream of asparagus soup would help?

I love veg soups and have been on an asparagus kick, so this one looked interesting. I used 2% milk in place of the heavy cream, which may have made a difference in taste, and used veggie broth instead of plain water. I also used a sweet Vidalia onion instead of leeks, and added a handful of baby bella mushrooms. I saved the asparagus tips for the end of cooking so they wouldn't get mushy. However, I think it needed more seasoning. Maybe garlic, seasoned salt, etc? Worth keeping and experimenting . . .

My family loved this soup. I will definately be making this again. I added some ham for my son (he's very picky and liked the soup without asparagus, spinach, and leeks...he didn't realize there was onions too :) ).  I'll probably reduce the salt next time too.  It tastes even better the next day.

This was really good, but didn't keep very even after a couple of hours in the fridge.  Not a very good dish if you're only cooking for one.

I think this was too creamy. It smelled delicious before I added the cream. (I had used vegetable stock for the broth.) Maybe next time I'll just make it w/o the cream. Also didn't add the spinach because it was already very bulky before I got to that step.

Great recipes! Although, I made some changes like other people.  I added a garlic clove while sauting the onion/leeks. I also replaced 2 cups of water for 2 cups of chicken broth and I used half & half instead of heavy cream. We eated with a sliced of sourdough bread.  Delicious!!! Next time I'll add some chopped grilled chicken at the end, since my husband needs some meat with his meal.

Just okay.  Would be better with a dollop of sour cream and/or parmesan cheese on top.

A hit every time i make it, the prep time is way below how long it's takes me to make it, but well worth it every time.

YUM!
I didn't have any leeks or spinach, so I used collard greens. The flavor of the broth is so good. I'm going to make this again!

The directions gave a good foundation for a soup (for me) but overall it needed spice. I substituted 1/2 of the water for only 1 can of chicken broth (which cut out a quarter of the broth for a heartier soup), added mushrooms, garlic, a little basil, thyme, and a bay leaf. Skipped on the rice because I wanted to use a crock pot and mushy rice isn't good for anyone.  :P

I hate giving 3 stars when I didn't follow the recipe exactly. But the difference was I added mushrooms and left out the asparagus since it wasn't in season. I wasn't thrilled with this recipe at all, needed more seasonings.

This soup was very good with a few minor adjustments. Replace the water with either low sodium vegtable or chicken broth. I also, added one tablespoon chicken broth granules for added flavor. Reduce the salt to one teaspoon and the heavy cream to 3/4 cup.
This soup is a complete meal with a loaf of warm Artisan bread.

I used vege broth and cut down on the salt. I think I shouldn't have put any salt in it. It was so salty, I ended up trying to dilute it. I put four stars, because I think if it hadn't been so salty the veggie blend w/o seasoning was really good.

I made this soup in about 45 minutes. It was a welcome spring treat. The kids even loved it, vegetables and all.
