I'm Filipino & this is my favorite dish!  You have to master the soy/ vinegar balance to your taste (sweet, sour, tangy). There are many brands of vinegar (distilled, apple, red wine)& soy sauces (low sodium, black, light)offered with different levels of tartness & saltiness.  If you are lucky to live near a Filipino grocery store, my Lola always recommended "Native Vinegar (sugarcane) & Soy" to give it an authentic flavor.  You can also cook chicken (dark)& pork(loin)together for this recipe.  You should marinate it in the refrigerator overnight or 1-2 hrs. prior to cooking. You can also add whole chilis (yellow) place in the side of the pot, not moving or opening them so that it doesn't dominate the dish. Simmer slowly for it to blend.  Don't rush, it won't be as delicious.  It's done when the meats tender.  If you like garlic, take out the meat/sauce from the pot. Saute some oil & garlic pieces & cook in medium heat.  Add the meat & a small amount of sauce back to the pot & saute.  You can also make "Adobo Fried Rice".  Transfer the chicken & sauce into a serving dish.  Saute a little oil & garlic.  Add the rice & some of the adobo sauce into the pan & mix thoroughly in high heat.  Vegetarians - you can cook your favorite vegetables like green beans, okra, etc... Chicken Adobo is well loved by all of my foreign friends & it's the most requested dish that I prepare. Enjoy!!!!

I am part Filipino and generations of my family have always browned the chicken pieces first, in a little oil with one small, chopped onion in a separate skillet - then transfer to soup pot or dutch oven. Browning the chicken with onion first makes a huge difference to the flavor. I use 1/4 cup red wine vinegar and 1 cup water. Eliminate the white vinegar and peppercorns.  Add a little salt if needed. You can also substitute fresh garlic with a generous amount of garlic powder or granulated garlic. It's delicious!

i am filipino and this is a different version that i am used to .. but it is very good. the key is the right mix of vinegar to soy,*here is my mom's take on this....after boiling the adobo, pan fry in chicken to 2-3 tbsp. of oil.once it has brown, add the adobo sauce till you get a rich sauce . (once you cook it a few times you will get it.) 
i just can't eat it with plain rice... fry garlic till brown and add "day old rice and a bit of salt" yummy!

I love chicken adobo... I make it from time to time but not following any particular recipe. I thought i would follow this recipe and see how it turns out. I thought the vinegar was way to overpowering. I think its best to use equal parts soy/vinegar. I also prefer to add aprox. 1 cup of water.(which i didnt do with this recipe) It ended up way to strong. I give it a 3 because i wouldn't make it following this exact recipe again.

I m ake chicken adobo got it from a sweet little Phooipine lady years ago.  Very similar to this recipe.  Everthing the same except she told me 1/3 cup vinegar to 2/3 cup soy sauce.  she also use 1 pkc Lipton cream of chicken soup and 1 cup water but I just use the can of soup too now.  I debone my chicken sometimes or cut up whole chicken and cut breast and thighs in half for more portions.  I just made it last night for friends and family my picky 10 year old son was begging for more today.

I made this tonight (foreign cuisine night) and it was awesome! I used quartered chicken pieces, and rice wine vinegar. I almost threw in the onions I'd cooked like another reviewer recommended but after a quick taste of the cooked chicken I discarded that idea as the dish was very flavorful in its own right. I'm positive we will make the again and again. I served with warm Japanese sushi rice (practicing for next week's meal) and it paired very well!

This recipe is pretty spot on.  Being Filipina, you learn about dishes from the kitchen and not from recipes.  However being away from the Philippines sometimes makes you forget, and measurements are really helpful.  

I think what this recipe doesn't discuss which is a very important step in making Chicken Adobo, is that before you turn on the heat, you need to let all of the ingredients sit for an hour.  This lets the vinegar cook on its own.  That way the dish never turns out vinegar-y.  Instead, it has this awesome tangy taste.  

Also, if you add pork, the flavors are amazing.  Chicken is good in itself though, if you don't eat pork.  

Lastly, if you can get a hold of "pandan leaves"  Try stewing a leaf or two with this.  

Your guests will never be able to get enough.

This is the worst recipe that I have had the misfortune of trying. This chicken tasted like vinegar. My step-son gagged and the only reason that my husband and I ate any is because it is what I had made for our dinner.

This tasty recipe is perfect as is! When I made this for my husband, he said it was delicious and very authentic. My husband grew up in the Philippines so he knows authentic Filipino food when he tastes it. For those not used to Filipino food, this dish may have too strong of a vinegar taste. You may want to reduce the vinegar to 1/2 cup. For extra kick, I added onions, more garlic, and a few whole jalepeno peppers. Overall, an excellent recipe! Thanks!

Absolutely delicious! I love Chicken Adobo and I normally add a little water to the vinegar and low-sodium soy sauce. I did add a little pinch of white sugar. I grated fresh ginger instead of slicing it and used a few garlic cloves, not a whole garlic bulb. I added the bay leaves and lots of fresh ground black peppercorn to the sauce. I let the sauce come up to a full boil then added the chicken thighs, covered the pot and let it cook for 30 minutes, occasionally stirring and checking the chicken. I uncovered the pot and let the sauce simmer until some of the liquid reduced a bit, 5 minutes or so. I can't tell you how wonderful the soy sauce, garlic, ginger and vinegar smells in my house..Mmm...MMM!! The chicken is so juicy, tender and seasoned just perfectly! The flavors all balanced out in the sauce, each standing on it own, but not overpowering each other. The ginger is a nice touch to the sauce and flavored the chicken wonderfully. I poured extra sauce over my rice. This is a sauce you will have to adjust according to your tastes because while others like it more "vinegary", I prefer mine a little less which is why I always have to add a pinch of sugar with water. You can also use pork in place of chicken, which also tastes great.  This paired perfectly with, "Roasted Corn with Garlic Rice, " and "Baby Bok Choy with Garlic," from this website.

OMG the chicken is amazing!!!
The only change I made was that I had Skinless Chicken Leg Quarters, multi colored Pepper corns and after straining I cooked frozen Stir fry veggies in the sauce.  

Recipe lends itself to using chicken that isn't quite thawed.  The cooking style ensures they thaw and cook corretly.  

I served it over a bowl of steamed Rice.  Get a rice cooker and some good rice - it makes a meal like this.

My Mom is filipina too and this almost tasted like what she used to make.  I called her before I made this and she told me to add a 1/4cup of water so that the chicken would be more tender.  I had to also add a 1/4 of soy sauce because the vinegar was too strong.  My mom never browned hers like some of the other reviewers suggested.  She also only used thighs and drumsticks and she never used ginger.  Next time I won't use white meat because the breasts didn't come out as tender as I hoped.  The dark meat was good and it was falling off the bones.

im filipino and this dish is definitely a staple during parties and special events.. it is simple, easy to make..and definitely yummy...i just want you guys to try out putting a bit of white sugar..yes what you read is right..white sugar... to the mixture approximately half a cup, to thicken the mixture and give it a nice sweet, salty, sour taste. it's also a great way to balance out the vinegar for those who used too much. believe me it's gonna add more flavor to your dish...enjoy!!!

This adobo is as good as my friends mother's!  It tasted a bit different than I remembered, maybe it's because of the ginger.  Easy to make.

I've been making adobo since my husband got the recipe from his Filipino grandmother. He loved this dish growing up, and I've tried a few variations. His grandmother boiled the ingredients in water to cover, so that there would be plenty of that delicious juice to soak into the bowl of rice, and that's how the family likes it. For this version, I did add some water and used an equal ratio of soy to vinegar. The fresh ginger was something I'd never used before, and it added a subtle, delicious layer to that sauce. Will definitely make this again.

Took the advice of another and used 1/3 c. vinegar and 2/3 cup soy. Also used less chicken and dried pepper and ginger to guess.

This is the best Chicken Adobo I've ever had! It is 100% authentic (I lived in the Philippines for two years) One tip - use Silver Swan soy sauce (you can get it at Filipino stores), it is the most popular soy sauce in the Philippines and is a million times better than kikkoman or any other american soy sauce.

I used chicken thighs and pieces of pork butt cut into chunks. After the liquid was reduced I put the meat back into the sauce to simmer a few minutes before serving.  My Filipino husband thought he had died and gone to Filipino Heaven! Entire family considers it a favorite dish. THANKS!

I have made this chicken adobo several times in the past few months and it has never failed to turn out great.  My only call out would be to make sure that you are trully simmer this dish once covered- addressing that once the lid is on the pot this will make the temperature rise. Not simmering will reduce the liquid too much, make it overwhelmingly salty, and won't leave you with enough sauce to pour over your rice. Also, cut down the amt of vinegar to half. Using only dark meat definitely makes the dish more flavorful.

This was fantastic! I had adobo once when a co worker brought in huge pans full, and I forgot to ask her for the recipe. I used chicken drumsticks but followed everything else to the T. Picky daughter loved this and there were no leftovers. thanks so much.

This is pretty much how I make my adobo, minus the ginger and with equal parts soy sauce/vinegar/water.  My Lolo was a chef for the Navy and he made his with Teriyaki sauce, too.  I like to make different variations from time to time, but I prefer the equal parts of sauces because you won't get too salty or too much vinegar.  Adding water really helps for people that can't handle the taste.  I do like the addition of the ginger, as used in teriyaki chicken.  I can't imagine making chicken adobo without bay leaves, garlic, and pepper.... lots of pepper!!!  And I agree having plain jasmine rice is the best way to eat it.  Tear up your chicken after boiling for an hour, stick it over the rice, add some of the sauce to it....yummy!!!!!!  (I'm Filipino)

Adobo isn't supposed to be sweet by any means. If you're gonna add sugar or honey, please don't call it adobo. That's teriyaki. In this recipe, the vinegar to soy sauce ratio is off. Needs much more soy sauce. My mother is Filipina and this was a household staple. She never used a recipe, just went by taste and that's how I've learned. You can know when it's right because the color of the chicken should be a deep brown from the soy sauce. Adobo is a salty dish on it's own. That's why it's served over plain white rice to cut it. Also, I'm not sure about the whole peppercorns, regular black peper is just fine. I've never heard of using ginger either. The bay leaves are a must, though!!!

The thought of it was good but the end result not so good. Far too much vinegar flavour for us. The only thing me and my boyfriend ate was the rice! Normally we love food like this but this recipe was just not for us!

I used equal parts vinegar and soy sauce and diluted my soy sauce with a little water I also browned chicken 1st with some onion then marinated it all over night.  The next day I put it all in the slow cooker.  I would really recommend marinating the chicken if you have the time.  Also I added some sugar to cut down on the sourness.

This was just ok for us. My husband has been raving about the chicken adobo he had while deployed in Iraq so i searched around to find out how to make it. I tried his but he said what he had was more spicy sooo I just have to tweak or search again.

Very easy and yummy recipe. The only thing I didn't care for was the lack of sauce afterward. All the chicken adobo I've had in the past has a thicker sauce. Maybe I'll had a bit of flower to the leftover sauce next time. Besides that one thing it was great. (Oh, and if you're not okay with vinegar tastes you won't care for chicken adobo, so just don't try it.)

Note: I added 1 cup of water to barely cover the chicken.   Outstanding. Made it for our Phillipine friend at Christmas dinner and she said it tasted like home. Good for everyone as it isn't very spicy but could take spice well if that is your thing.

This recipe was fabulous!! I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs. I browned them along with shallots, sliced garlic, ginger, and 2 seeded jalepenos. I then added 1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce, 1/2 cup of vinegar, 1 cup of water, and two tblsp brown sugar. After bringing mixture to a boil I added zuchinni cut into matchsticks. Thickened the mixture with a little flour. The results were amazing! served over jasmine rice. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Very tasty and definitely a keeper. I make adobo all the time. Ginger adds a nice touch. I browned my chicken first in garlic and not too much oil. Then cooked all for about 4 hours.

This recipe is simply amazing. I could eat this chicken every week and never tire of it. That said, I did feel that it was a little salty for my taste.. even with low sodium soy sauce. So I added about 1/4 cup of water and it is now perfect!!

this recipe is great. this is very similar to how my filipino mother cooks adobo except she puts more soy sauce then vinegar. A tip to reducing the tanginess flavor is by adding a pinch of baking soda until u reach your desired flavor of tanginess. works like a charm :)

Sooo yummy!  I did not use a whole chicken -- used a pack of boneless, skinless breast and a pack of boneless, skinless thighs.  Also, after reading reviews I adjusted the amount of vinegar and added a cup of water.  Everybody loved it.

Wow... I was very impressed with this dish...It was perfect for a low carber.  I did add a little cornstarch flurry to thicken it up (That added 7 carbs to the entire dish)... I also added a teaspoon of splenda to balance out the taste and a little chicken broth.  This is great with some steamed veggies.  Will definitely make this again.

Will definitely make it again when I'm craving chicken adobo. I followed a tip to not stir/disturb the meat otherwise it'll make it more vinegar tasting. There was a little tweaking to adjust for 2 people using 6 drumsticks+skin on (1.5 lb of meat), 1/2 the size of the original recipe basically. However, I used rice vinegar which is milder than American white vinegar. Minced up the ginger instead, used ready made minced garlic from a jar in our fridge instead whole fresh garlic, added equal parts of regular soy sauce to vinegar to water which was close to 1/4 cup of each & 1/4 cup of chicken broth. I basted the chicken with the liquid trying not to disturb the meat every 10 mins during that 30  mins which turned out still moist since my pot wasn't dutch oven type which would be smaller in comparison to the dutch oven. I ended up removing the chicken & adding cornstarch to the liquid to thicken the sauce. Will definitely make it again & consider using peppers for some spice or even the slow cooker to make it even more tender.

Excellent! This tastes is just like my mother's adobo. I added one cup of water as another reviewer suggested and it turned out perfect. I forgot to buy fresh ginger at the market so I used the powdered kind.  It still turned out great. We're having it for dinner again tonight.

Definitely a dish to make again and again. I use chicken breasts on the bone cut in half instead of dark meat. You can't get easier than throwing everything in pot and turning the flame on.

It tasted great and was so easy to make! I used chicken breasts with the bone in and I think the leftover chicken will taste good in an oriental type salad.

One of my faves and so easy to make. As others have mentioned, you have to play with the soy sauce/vinegar ratio to suit your taste (I like it 1:1 and use low-sodium soy sauce).  Also, I marinate my chicken thighs in the sauce/aromatics mixture a few hours before cooking.

Serve with garlic fried rice (another allrecipes recipe).

I'm filipino and this is NOT how it should taste. Its not clear to me how this got such a high rating. Why doesn't allrecipes have the option for me to rate 0 stars??

I love adobo and this is a great recipe. For those non-filipinos who think the soy sauce-vinegar is too heavy here is my solution: put 1 TBS soy sauce and 1 TBS apple cider vinegar in 1/2 cup and fill the rest with water. Use this mixture for 2 boneless skinlless chicken drumsticks (abour 1/2 pound). Enjoy!

I made this for my family, (Parents, Nephews, and Nieces, Kids and Wife). The Wife is Philippino, she told me it tasted like being back home. The rest of us Americans loved it too. Of course I had to change the number of servings. Thank you.

This is a good recipe but I prefer the vinegar/soy ratio more even and I add water, like others have mentioned.  I like to make this in the oven or slow cooker so I can go off and leave it.  By the way, potatoes cut in large chunks are amazing.  No butter needed when you eat them!  Just add a vegetable or salad.  Great meal.

liked it alot.  have never had authentic adobo before so i didn't know what to expect.  served it at a family gathering it was nice and easy to prepare.  i think it's better if cooked longer than the recipe suggests.  i cooked it in my dutch oven on low for four hours.  i tasted it after the suggested cooking time and the vinegar was a bit overpowering but after a couple more hours it mellowed out alot.  needs a little more spice i think. we sprinkled red pepper on it after plating.  also i tossed in fresh whole mushrooms for the last hour they added a nice flavor to the broth and were a really tasty accompaniment. four stars because everyone was eating it for the first time and liked it and ate a lot of it but nobody was raving.

Sooo good! I used a crock pot on low for a few hours and then deboned and skinned the chicken and put the meat back in on warm until dinner time. I also used another reviewers suggestions and did 1 c water, 1/4 c soy and 1/2 c red wine vinegar then all of the seasonings.

This was delicious. I added 2 cups of shredded carrots and used apple cider vinegar instead of regular. I used chicken breasts cut into strips and crock potted it for about 3 hours. Served it over basmati rice and it was just delicious.

This is delicious! It came out tender with just the right spice- plus perfect ingredients for if you are sick like ginger and garlic (great for the immune system). I used crushed black pepper since I didn't have peppercorns. Great over white long grain rice!

This  really is as good as everyone says it is! I tweeked it like many said to. I used red wine vinegar, added  some sugar, chili powder, cumin and added sauted mushrooms, onions, add a few other veggies to the mix after it cooked. I served it over jasmine rice and WOW it was fantastic. My hubby loved it and I just shared this recipe with two co -workers. Thanks

I could see this being good, but next time I will make one change.  For me personally, it was just too much vinegar! The dish tasted too sour. I caught myself making the puckered sour face!  Next time I would probably do only 1/2 a cup of white vinegar.

Great! I would recommend adding a 1/3 cups sugar to make it sweeter (sweet, sour, salty, etc). I did add some cornstarch to thicken the sauce though as the sauce is really watery. Also used less vinegar, 1/2 cup is plenty.

Awesome.  We just adjusted the soy sauce a bit (added some more).  The best soy sauce for this is the Lauriat soy sauce (it has a swan on its red label).  The vinegar is called Datu Puti. Our Phillipino friend, who makes the BEST adobo in the world, only cooks adobo with these two brands.  If you want it spicy, add little pieces of Thai chili pepper to taste, also known as rocket pepper. Habanero peppers work as well.  GREAT recipe, basic but authentic.  Thanks!

I thought this recipe was really good. I especially liked the addition of the garlic. I browned the chicken first because I like the extra flavor it adds. This is perfect served with steamed rice and broccoli. The leftovers are great too.

This chicken is so delicious and easy. I played with the amounts and ended up with 1/2 cup soy sauce and 1/2 cup red wine vinegar, plus 1/2 cup water. This is a great recipe that can be easily changed to suit how intense you want the flavors to be. The chicken was extremely moist and was even good as left overs.

I made this recipe last night and I got RAVE reviews from my husband, but I did make some adjustments...My step mother is from the heart of Manila and I remember going to Manila and spending lots of time there being cooked for by everyone...so my memory of Chicken Adobo was a bit different...
I used 1 cup of chicken stock/broth instead of water.  1/4 cup of White Wine, 1/4 cup of Orange juice, 2 small potatoes.  I also chose to brown the chicken in a pan with a bit of oil, garlic, onion and ginger and then added it to the cup of chicken stock/broth in the sauce pan.  I did the same with the potatoes, letting them simmer for about 8 minutes before adding them to the mixture.  Then I added the rest of the onion (I used one medium sized yellow onion.), garlic and ginger.  As far as the vinegar/soy mix.  I used 1 pound, .50 kilo's of boneless, skinless chicken thighs, chunked, so I adjusted the mix to 3/4 cup of soy sauce and I used 3/4 cup of vinegar (Half white and half wine) Turned out...extraordinary!!!!!!!  I will be making this one again...and again..........and again!!!!!!!

I've made this a bunch of times, always with great results. I like to use 2 6-packs of boneless chicken thighs (or substitute 1 of the packs with a couple of thick boneless pork chops, cubed). I prefer to substitute at least half of the vinegar with cider vinegar, to cut down on the harshness of the vinegar, and to bring out a little tangy sweetness. I also use only about 1 teaspoon of peppercorns (counting them to make removal easier later). Before serving, I only try to remove the bay leaves and peppercorns, but I leave the bits of garlic and ginger in, since they add so much good flavor. My husband and our picky 2-year old love it, and so do I!

A nice change of pace and easy.  I used corn starch to thicken the gravy.  Also, I used chicken breast b/c it was all I had.  I think it would have turned out better if I used dark meat on the bone.

This was quick and easy! I made it with boneless chicken breasts using apple cider vinegar(instead of white) and shallots.  The sauce was thin so I thickened it with flour. I paired it with coconut flavored white rice, which complimented this dish so well. I would definately make this again!

I love this recipe and have made it many times.  If you are a sauerkraut fan, you also might want to try adding shredded cabbage to the recipe (I've used the 16 oz package of shredded cabbage available in the produce section of your grocery store).  Wonderful!

Very tasty, however I expected the more traditional spicy (hot) adobo chicken. But it still makes a very good dinner.

I'm Filipino and this is probably the best adobo I've ever had!  It's very flavorful with the ginger and garlic.  I like to use boneless and skinless drums/legs.

I have tried numerous recipes for adobo chicken but this one tops them all.  (The others just didn't seem to get the right balance of soy sauce and vinegar) I changed it a bit by adding half an onion and 1/2 teaspoon of brown sugar and changing the vinegar portion to 1/2 cup white and 1/4 apple cider.  I also used split chicken breasts on the bone and allowed it all to marinate for about an hour.  The breasts didn't take long to cook and I didn't strain the liquid.  I just served the whole thing in a big bowl for a family style dinner. Yummy!

I tried it once just to be a little different and my family loved it. It has quickly worked its way into the rotation of meals regularly served at our house. I typically add a little less vinegar than called for and it turns out great.

I made this with 9 boneless skinless chicken breasts and left out the ginger and bay leaves. Also, I used ground black pepper instead of peppercorns and didn't think the sauce needed to be strained. I used only 1/2 cup of vinegar instead of 3/4 cup and 3 cloves of garlic rather then 1 bulb. I served it with pancit, lumpia and Jasmine rice. It was a wonderful meal!!!

Me & my husband LOVED this recipe.  I changed it a bit by using cubed thinly sliced chicken breasts on placing all ingredients in a baking dish for 25 minutes on 350.  I added a couple more cloves garlic (believe it or not), lowered the vinegar to a little more than 1/2 cup and a little less soy sauce (I also used low sodium soy sauce).  Further, I changed the peppercorns to one tablespoon cracked lemon dill pepper.  I served it on rice mixed with peas and pearl cocktail onions - and boy - was it DELICIOUS !!!!!  My husband said - this is a keeper !!

I used just chicken thighs instead of the whole chicken.  It was just excellent!  I've made a similar recipe several times before in the slow cooker, but this will definitely replace that dish.  It was quick, easy, and delicious.  Thanks, Liza

Awesome.  Had a craving for adobe chicken at 11 at night...so I got up and made some. For those that thought the vinegar was too much, I would suspect that you did not let enough liquid content evaporate. It takes a good hour if not a slight longer to get the desired taste.  I tasted it before it was ready and the vinegar was very strong.  After a while though, all the flavor blended perfectly.

family favorite. I like to take out the chicken after it is done cooking and fry in heated oil to crisp the skin. Then we like a little thicker sauce for your rice, and add a tablespoon corn sauce to 1/4 cup water and stir in simmering sauce.

I tried to take too many reviewer suggestions.  I did marinate my chicken thighs, but then I tried to brown it, and that did not work.  I may try it next time the alternative way, but the marination without browning still tasted darn good.  If I had cooked the chicken for the full 30 min (since I did not use the whole chicken), it would have been overcooked.  I used the condensed sauce to sautee some long beans to really good results too.  This recipe is definitely a repeat!!!

We love this! My only changes were to cook in a slow cooker for 8 -10 hours, used 1/4 cup vinegar, and added 1/2 cup of water. Also, I was too busy to peel and chopped garlic, so I used 2 heaping teaspoons of jarred minced garlic. Will definitely be making this again!

I was looking for a dish to make for girl scout international Night (we did the Philippines).   And I found this.  WOW this went over fantastically.  I did 10 lbs and came home with less than a cup.

I did follow the recomended changes.  (used  1/4 cup Apple Cider Vinegar added 1 cup water.  Used ground ginger).    This has been added to our main dishes to cook.   WOW   amazing.

I used my own variation and it turned out delicious!
I don't like cooking twice so i just boiled everything on medium heat for about 35 minutes with the lid on.

I used chicken thighs which always seem to pick up the marinade well.  I didn't even have to let it sit in the marinade! 

I used the Braggs amino acids since I was on some diet earlier.  I used about 1/4 cup braggs amino acids, 1 cup water, more if the juices are drying out too much (the juices will dry out even with the lid on), garlic powder, black pepper, and about 1-2 tablespoons of rice vinegar.  I'm not a fan of vinegar, so less is better for me.  I then put them all in the pot, pierced the skinless chicken thighs with a fork, and let it simmer on medium heat.  then ate it with rice, now i'm addicted to it! yum!!!

This is a great recipe, but I did make a few changes to suit my family's tastes.  I used white wine vinegar, instead of the distilled white. I also used only skinless chicken leg quarters, since breast meat can be rather dry if braised too long. And, I browned the chicken in a little canola oil before adding the soy-vinegar mixture. Finally, after the meat was cooked, I skimmed the fat off the top before serving.

I used boneless skinless chicken and left out the ginger since I didn't have any. Browned the chicken. Then I started off with 1 cup low sodium soy sauce & 3/4 cup white vinegar it was to tart to me and keep mixing the soy &vinegar to my liking it was still a little tart so I added 3tsp brown sugar & 1 cup water. Brought it to a boil & let it simmer for about 3 hrs adding a little water to keep chicken covered. I still gave this recipe 5 stars because it is  a great starting point and it was delicious my whole family loved it! As others reviewers have stated I think the key to this recipe is finding the right balance between the soy & vinegar and adjusting it to your tastes=) Next time I will try it with the ginger.

I had ten drumsticks that I saved from a ruined Malaysian curry (bleck!), and had an hour to make something edible with ingredients I had on hand before the boyfriend came home. This is some of the most delicious, easiest meal that I made! The vinegar smelled a little too pungent while it was cooking, but the balance was just perfect in the end product, and all the vinegar tenderized the meat perfectly! YUM. Definitely will be keeping this in my rotation!

Really good and easy! I agree that getting the right flavor balance is a little tricky; mine had a little too much pepper in it. I took the advice of others and browned the chicken in onions first. I also pulled out the breasts after 30 minutes; I may have left them in if they'd been bone-in. I will definitely make this again.

I first had Chicken Adobo when a Philipino co-worker brought it for lunch one day. It smelled SO good and she let me try it. After that I fell in love and she brought it for me all the time. I never did get her recipe and have since moved away. I searched and searched for a recipe that I think was similiar and finally found it with this recipe. It tastes almost identical! I add more garlic and bit more peppercorn. Smells so good while it's cooking. Hubby loves it! I serve it with brown rice.

This recipe is easy, tasty and great and the food tasted very close to ones that my Philippino friends cooked for me. I used a pressure cooker to shorten the cooking time and it worked perfect.  After I cooked chicken in the pressure cooker, I let the sauce simmer for a little bit. Jasmine rice went perfect with the adobo.

This was an easy recipe and with red wine vinegar I found it pretty tasty too.  Next time I wouldn't cook the sauce as long because it carmelized and there wasn't much to put on rice.  I think the balance of soy to vinegar was fine, but the sauce could be better with a little water and sugar added to sweeten and make it less strong.

Made these last night in conjuction with my Traci's Adobo Seasoning and Chicken Adobo II. Boiled the chicken with that recipe and this recipe and subbed the salt with MSG (this is how my grandma cooks Adobo). Once the chicken was mostly tender, I added the potatoes. When the potatoes were done, I strained the chicken while reserving 1/2 the broth. Then I finished off the chicken with Chicken Adobo II. Time consuming but the 3 recipes put together is the closest that I could get to my grandma's recipe.

might have been the soy sauce that wasn't quite the right kind, but this did not taste the same as in the Philippines which is sad because it is so tasty there!

Hmm.. this recipe looks nice, but i'd add 2 tbs of brown sugar. But then again every family makes their adobo a lil bit different.

this was very simple and straightforward. If your not a big fan of soy sauce this isn't for you. I served this with Jasmine rice and some lime..thanks for sharing

I absolutely loved this recipe! It was SOO quick and delicious (not to mention cheap). I used chicken thighs (which were on sale for a dollar a pound). As many other reviewers suggested, I changed the ratio of vinegar to soy sauce. I only used 1/2 a cup of white vinegar, and 1/2 a cup of soy sauce. I sauteed the onions, ginger, garlic, and bay leaves first, then added the remaining ingredients. I added potatoes, one green chile (for some kick) and topped it off with chopped green onions. It was delicious! In fact, I think it tastes better the next day! I will be making this for many years to come, or for as long as chicken thighs are put on sale. =) Thank you!

My whole family loves this.  I make it in the slow cooker using chicken thighs and serve it with Jasmine rice and steamed broccoli.  (For some reason broccoli really goes well with adobo.)

Oh yum!  Really, really good recipe!  I was a little skeptical about the ginger, since the chicken adobo I've always made never called for it, but it brought the dish to a whole new level.  Plus, the whole kitchen smelled SO good all night after making it.  Do add the chopped sweet onion, though!

I picked this recipe because I love Ginger.  I totally over cooked this chicken due to an unexpected visitor outside.  Anyway, my 4 year old is soo picky and she devoured it...TWICE!!  It was very good.  My husband even had seconds.  I had to use some terriaki sauce for part of the soy because I ran out, but it was still delicious!  I also used egg noodles because I didn't have the time for my rice to cook.  Again, still great!  I will make this regularly!  Thank you!

This was good and easy.  Maybe a little salty, but I think that I reduced the sauce too much.

I'm not used to Filipino food, so the vinegar was pretty overpowering.  Still pretty good, but next time i would cut the vinegar to 1/3 cup.

i am filipina and i make chicken & pork adobo all the time for my family - my husband is american and so are my stepkids. they love adobo. ginger is not a traditional ingredient in adobo.  but this recipe wasn't too bad because, but for the ginger, this is exactly how i would do adobo, except that i would marinate the meats overnight before cooking.

We used red wine vinegar and water like one reviewer suggested, and we also browned the chicken with onion before putting it in the dutch oven as was suggested. It was VERY tender and yummy, but maybe a little salty. I'll use low sodium soy sauce next time. The only other thing would be to try and make the sauce thicker. Maybe add cornstartch at the end? Overall, a wonderful dish. I will buy the chicken already cut up next time because that was definitely the hardest part!

first off...real traditional adobo doesn't have ginger. i made this for dinner tonight followed it to a T except i used 6 chicken breasts and chopped the onions instead of just leaving it smashed and put in 1/2 cup of vinegar instead. i let my hubby taste test it b4 turning off the oven and he said it was bland. so i added a little more soy sauce and i turned it way too salty in my opinion. my hubby's opinion was that it was too sour. i'm giving it a 2 cuz somehow we were still able to eat it...yet alot of leftovers n' i'm sure i'm going to end up throwing it out tomorrow. some advice...watch out on the vinegar...do it by taste i guess and adobo normally doesn't have ginger as part of the ingredient.

I changed a couple of things. I used low sodium soy sauce (less salty), used bone in chicken thighs and cooked in the oven with the marinade at 350 for 45 min and then took out of marinade and broiled under broiler until skin was nice and crispy. My kids love this!

It's good, the vinegar flavour was a little strong for me.  Chicken was tender but not incredibly juicy.  I used bone-in chicken thighs, and even though I like skin there was a lot of oil in the dish making it difficult for the water to exaporate off.  

Overall, I'd probably make again.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was great!  My roommates and I loved it and it made the place smell so good.  I'm a starving college student, so I don't have much in my kitchen--omitting the bay leaves and peppercorns didn't matter.  I also substituted 6 thighs for the whole chicken (again, we're poor students here).  I'll definitely be making this again!

I had to use 1/2 C vinegar (distill vinegar) because it was too strong.  I would suggest using Phillippino white vinegar (from asian market) since it is not as strong as the distilled white vinegar.  I also added 2 tbsp of white sugar to balance the flavor.  Trimmed off all the skin/fat of the chicken and keep it in the refrigator overnight after it's cooked.  The next day before reheating it, take off all the solidified fat on the top and it'll have less fat and also the chicken soaked up the marinate much better overnight.  The kids were asking for 3 servings!!!

The ginger made this chicken outstanding - even my kids gobbled it up!  However, for color and some veggie appeal, next time I think I'll include baby carrots.

Great recipe, my family raved over it. It was a nice change and very savory. Easy to make, a simple fast dish. It does need to be garnished with lots of color, nice and moist as a dish done without the skin or just using chicken breasts for the diet minded.

My husband & I both enjoyed this chicken dish very much!  The ginger flavor is very aromatic. I only used about a 1/4 cup of the white vinegar & substituted black pepper instead of peppercorns.  The sauce is wonderful with steamed white rice.  It reminds me of a Chinese chicken dish that my parents make at home!

I loved this recipe.  I cut up a 5 lb chicken and cooked it in the liquid as directed then I deboned the chicken and set aside.  I strained the liquid then added a can of cream of chicken to it. Mixed it well then add the deboned chicken to the gravy mixture.  It was GREAT with hot rice.

I cooked this tonight for my family and it had a good flavor. Next time I make it I will SURELY use LESS VINEGAR. My kids liked it but I wasn't too hip on it. I used the frozed chicked cubes (someone else did also in the reviews) and they do work wonderfully could definitely be a last MINUTE meal! Try it for yourself!~! :) (Don't use all the vinegar!~!)

I was really impressed with this recipe. I made it two weeks ago, and I am already craving it again! I love ginger and garlic so I used more than called for. Next time I will use a tad less vinegar and a bit more soy sauce, but this is now one of my favorite recipes. It is good for so many reasons, it's very easy to make, I usually have all the ingredients on hand, and it's cheap and low fat! Who could ask for more? I was considering adding some sesame seeds and minced green onion to the sauce after straining it for added appeal. Thanks for sharing!

I dont know why i had a little of a hard time with this, the sauce kept foaming up. I was not able to sear the meat. But all in all it was okay.

I love this recipe. I followed the recipe, then made it according to my liking. The vinegar was too overpowering for my taste. I used a ratio of about 1:4 (1 part vinegar to 4 parts soy) or 1:3 and about a cup of water (more or less a cup).  I find the best part to use are chicken legs. It's a little bit more work to chop, but it's very affordable and flavor/texture is great.  I first cook the chicken skin side down in a hot pan (NO oil). I watch the pan and reduce heat if needed. I let it carmelize then use a spoon to scoop out the excess fatty liquid.  Then I add the ginger, onion, extra garlic and stir around bottom of pan to cook and add flavor.  After about a min or two, I continue with the rest of the ingredients and cook per instructions with the addition of sugar to bring out the flavor. I let it simmer until the liquid reduces. If it reduces too much I add back in a little water. The sauce is awesome to eat with rice. Sometimes, I add slices of jalapeño towards the end. After tasting, if it's getting too spicy, I take it out when needed. I'll add it back on top of the chicken platter for presentation.  Before serving, I remove the bay leaves but leave everything else.  It saves me time from cleaning. Thank you for sharing!!  Salamat!!

I liked a lot. All the family liked enough to eat everything, only that, is enough to deserve at least 4 stars because it's rare! My wife thinks that the vinegar taste is too present. I agree a little bit, but I liked as it was. I overcooked the chicken a little bit, I don't cook it that way, usually, and to me, it looked uncooked. Next time, I will listen better to the directions! I realize, looking at others photos, that maybe I should have cut bigger pieces of chicken.

I will do it again, it deserves it!

Excellent recipe. I cooked 9 drumsticks using ground ginger instead of fresh since I didn't have any around and browned the chicken first before simmering it in the adobo mixture. For the mixture, I also used about 5 or 6 bay leaves and found a filipino brand "Datu Puti" vinegar that's consist of cane vinegar and water. The combination of ingredients produced a very appetizing sauce to be eaten with rice. I will definitely try it again with fresh ginger.

This was good but there was a little something missing for me.  Maybe it was just too much soy sauce, or maybe I needed something with a little bit more spice... cumin?

I made this over the weekend, it was delish.  It didn't make me cry with delight, but it definitely tasted good.  I made one minor adjustment, only because it's what good ol' Ma would've done (she's filipino).  I added about two tablespoons of brown sugar to help round out the flavor.  Now, about those PEPPERCORNS... Suddenly chomping down on one of those puppys interrupted my culinary bliss... I won't be using those again!  Just regular ol' pepper.  All in all, though, this dish hit the spot.  I loves me some Adobo!  Most likely I'll be making this again, and YOU should, too!

Too much vinegar in it. The sauce was very thin. I removed the chicken and reduced it. I will experiment with this recipe next time.

Really easy and tasty chicken. Though it takes a long time to cook, the prep is simple. Mine turned out a touch dry, but it could be because I had less chicken so I cut down on the amount of sauce required. I also only had apple cider vinegar, and it turned out really tasty still. Perhaps will use 1:1 soy/vinegar next time.

This is an excellent recipe. I like to cut the ginger up in to bigger chunks. I also add a couple of medium size tomatoes to the recipe. Cut the tomatoes up in to big chunks. I have a Fillipino friend and that is how she taught me to make it...with the addidtion of the tomatoes that is.

Not being familiar with Filipino cuisine, I was looking for something "safe" to try out with my family. This turned out to be a good choice. I only used 6 garlic cloves (1/2 bulb), and added about 4 tbsp honey to cut the saltiness of the soy sauce reduction. I also thickened the sauce near the end with a little cornstarch/water mix, but these were the only changes I made. Got the "thumbs up" from the family, and in the end, that's what counts !

LOVED this recipe. I made a few minor changes. One that was suggested is equal parts vinegar with the soy. I added about a Tbs of honey and after letting it sit in the crockpot for several hours, I put the chicken (minus the sauce) into a baking dish and just browned/crisped the top. Served over a bed of jasmine rice and drizzle with the sauce. YUMMM!!!!

This was very good. The chicken was ridiculously tender and very flavorful. I had worried that the garlic would be overpowering, but that was not the case at all. I just wish there was a little more variety within this dish itself (some hot peppers or vegetables, for example), but you can of course serve veggies on the side.

I mixed all the liquids and seasonings together and dumped it over partially frozen bone-in chicken breasts in the crock-pot.  It cooked while we slept - the smell when I briefly woke around 4:30 was delicious, and the first taste when I got out of bed around 6:00 was pretty good.  The only change I will make next time is to reduce the vinegar.  I used 1/2 red wine vinegar and 1/2 rice wine vinegar, but found the ratio of vinegar to soy sauce not quite to my liking.  I'd more likely use equal parts of both in my next try.  Still tasted great, although the house smelled like vinegar, which is not my husband's favorite smell.

Oh man, this is wonderful! I had a bunch of friends over - one of whom has a gluten allergy - and to be able to whip this up in no time without really leaving the party was awesome. Not only that, but it got rave reviews and there was NONE left over! I cubed the chicken for ease of serving, but man, there's nothing I could do to improve this.

This is so easy to make and equally delicious!  I've been craving it ever since I made it!  I sliced a yellow onion into 1/4" slices and sauteed those a bit before adding the chicken and liquids. It adds a little something extra!  YUM!

This recipe is OK. I used 1/2 cup of vinegar instead of 3/4 cup and added 1/2 cup of water. In the end, the vinegar was still too overpowering for my taste. It didn't taste like any of the Adobo that I ate while spending time in the Philippines.

Very good. I made this in the crock pot - just removed as much of the skin as possible, threw all the ingredients in, and cooked it on low for 6 hours. Fall off the bone scrumptious. At 5 hours, I pulled the chicken into pieces so it could all simmer in the sauce. Easy and smelled heavenly. 2/3 cup vinegar seems excessive. For the liquids, I used 1 c chicken broth, 1/2 c vinegar, and 1/4 c soy sauce. Would do the same again. This is definately a recipe I will make again.

My husband and I love adobo, even tho it has been years since either of us have eaten it. I was so excited about this recipe - but our double batch is going in the garbage. The vinegar is too overpowering, and my husband likes vinegar! He's trying it with sour cream (yuck) because we hate throwing away food. I'll keep looking!

I forgot the ginger.  Then again, a very similar recipe I used to use did not call for ginger.  But it was still very good.  I like this recipe because it is so simple- no chopping and little prep.  Very forgiving on timing.  One of my all time favorite recipes for chicken.

I think this is the best recipe I've seen online so far. Sounds the most authentic to how my mom cooked it for us growing up. Now that I've moved away from home, I still crave for my mom's adobo, but if I can't get it from her, I'll use this recipe to fill my void. Serve with steaming jasmine rice and DO drizzle the sauce over your rice. SO GOOD.

This recipe is great.  Reminds me of my mom's adobo.  I didn't add ginger or bay leaves.  I cooked the chicken first, then halfway through browning the chicken I added some onion. Then added all the other ingredients.  I don't know if it would've tasted better with ginger but this was the best adobo I've ever made.  People who are new to adobo might find the vinegary taste a little bit strong.  The other adobos I've had (my mom's and grandma's) don't use ginger.

GREAT chicken adobo recipe.  A friend of mine that was Filipino used to make chicken adobo, and I have been wanting a good recipe for it.  This recipe is easy and delicious!  My family loves it.

I felt like making this in the crockpot one day and used boneless chicken breasts instead. It was okay but the recipe is definitely better as is, made in a Dutch oven with bone-in chicken. The nice thing about the boneless version was it made a great cold salad for lunch the next day. Just pour the leftover sauce and shredded chicken over leftover rice and chill. Add green onions and chopped artichoke hearts and diced red peppers the next day and voila. Great as is or over lettuce with a ginger dressing.

My whole family really loves this!  I change up the type of chicken to whatever I have in the house, but it always turns out great.  It's perfect with Jasmine rice and is pretty darn simple to make.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks for the recipe!

Just like my mom makes.  I think I'm going to use ginger powder next time and use less peppercorns.  The flavour was just right though.  I would definitely make this again.

Taking a hint, I used 2/3c rice vinegar, 2/3c pineapple juice, and 2/3c soy sauce, which gave the dish a nice sweet and sour flavor. Also, I slow cooked the chicken an hour so it was very tender and tender.

My mom is phillipino and this dish is a regular dish served at parties that her or her friends have.  I love this recipe.  The only things I would change about this recipe is lessen the ginger (it's a little too much),add some corn starch to thicken it up the sauce and use the sauce over the rice- it's delicious!  You could also add some potatoes and make it a little more hardy.  It's so yummy!

This chicken is amazing! I fixed it almost exactly following the recipe. I used low-sodium soy sauce, 3 cloves of garlic, and 3/4 pound of chicken breasts (to serve 3). The sauce doesn't need to be diluted - other reviewers made me nervous about the strength of the vinegar, but the recipe's amount of vinegar is perfect without any added water. Thanks for a great recipe!

I used chicken thighs and just cut the skin off myself to keep it from getting too greasy. I also used rice wine vinegar instead of white, but I think it was a mistake because the dish didn't have the pungency I was craving. Also, more peppercorns were needed.

This is very similar to what my mom use to make when I was little.  All I do is combine all the ingredients in a large dutch oven (used alittle more soy sauce, the low sodium kind, and cut the vinegar to 1/2 cup and added 1 cup of water, this was it won't turn out too vinegar tasting) and put about 3 lbs of drumstick in and bring it to a boil, reduce heat and let simmer for 30 mins.  The one thing that I love to do with this dish is to boil a few eggs in another pot until it's firm, peel them and stick them in the pot and stir it all up, it's not too often we eat hard boil eggs, and it's great this way served on a bed of hot jasmine or basmati rice!

I just made this twice now (in the same evening!) and loved it.  First off, I used rice vinegar and a Philipino soy sauce.  I read all the user reviews and was terrified about the amount of vinegar; DO NOT change the amount of vinegar used...just add 1 cup of water.  Then towards the end of cooking I added cornstarch to thicken.  It had such good flavor.

DELICIOUS! I'm giving this 4 stars because I didn't follow your recipe exactly. I had 5lb of quarter legs and, since I was simply too lazy to alter the recipe to fit 5lb, I just guessed. I used ground pepper instead of peppercorns. I went heavy on both the garlic and the pepper, since I am a huge fan of both. We didn't have bay leaves so I used the leaves on our lime tree in our backyard, which is what my mom usually uses when cooking. Turned out GREAT. I will make sure to have my Filipino friends try it to see what they think!

I gave it a 4 for two reasons.  First, the ginger root should be grated, not sliced.  Second, add onions, lots of onions.  I cut up two large ones and sauted them with the  garlic and pepper.  Other than that the proportions of soy sauce and vinegar were great.  Use Asian white vinegar and a good quality soy sauce!  I made one more change this last time.  I left the ginger root out completely and added  two small red peppers.  It added the the right amount of "hot" to it.  My wife loved it.

Outstanding. Really nice combination  of flavors. I used chicken breasts (brined overnight), browned in shallots and garlic. Will up the liquids next time and braise for an hour, then shred like southern style barbecue. Low maintenance that can be passed off as high.

My family loved this. I thought it was dry, but that was my fault. I left it in the marinade all day and then panicked about cooking it in the juices. I guess I'll feel differently if we end up sick. I used rice vinegar and used 1/2 cup because I know my family isn't crazy about vinegary foods. I also used boneless chicken breasts and cooked them way too long because of my paranoia. Anyways, it's a keeper, I may try it with pieces next time, but my family thought it was great!

I made this last night and it turned out great.... it goes very well with jasmine rice.  
I used the boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of the whole chicken...  
Still yummy.  (always use dark meat, as white meat doesn't seem to hold the same flavor....)

The amount of vinegar is not bad, I simply used way more soy sauce after browning the chicken. The chicken was almost swimming in it. I also browned some onions with the chicken soy sauce and garlic which probably helped counteract the vinegar. Also - after you add the vinegar, don't stir!

Really tasty recipe. I would advise to cut the vinegar called for in half to make this taste like true Adobo. Otherwise, this was a very easy and delicious recipe.

This dish is delicious! The only change I made was I reduced the amount of vinegar added, as other reviewers suggested, to a little less than 1/2 cup. I kept everything else the same. The combination of ingredients gives the chicken such great flavor. Since I had extra sauce, I added some cut-up potatoes to cook in the sauce. YUMmy! It goes so well over rice. It's also easy to make.

tastes great! just like my boyfriend's mom dish (who is filipino). only thing i add to this recipe is some water as it can be a bit salty due to soysauce.. and i chop up some potatoes and mushrooms to add to the pot as well and cook it together. awesome over rice and great as leftover as well.

Extremely easy dish. It smelled wonderful cooking, and the vinegar gave the chicken an interesting twang.

The flavor in the resulting sauce of this recipe is EXCELLENT. Very different from our usual flavors. I was very surprised I used a whole BULB of garlic and it wasn't too strong.  Will make this again and again. I didn't change amounts but I did use LOW SODIUM "Tamari" (soy sauce) and WHITE WINE vinegar.  It was very greasy;so I will use skinless chicken(and baste often so it doesn't get dried out) next time, or take the time to skim it off the top. I noticed some of the other "Adobo Chcken" recipes call for only a CLOVE of garlic and less vinegar. However, there are also many poor reviews with it that way. This was wonderful with amounts stated. Lisa, thank you so much for sharing!

Really good. I used boneless chicken breasts and they turned out very tender. I think I went overboard on the soy sauce because they were a little too salty. Overall, a great meal.

It was really good. One of my favorite Filipino foods. Based on my observations of restaurants and street cantinas in central Luzon i usually go equal parts vinegar and soy. Also i add a chopped onion and saute it with the garlic in a few tbs of oil before adding the chicken and other ingredients.

Rescind my last review haha. This recipe has even my “vegetarian” seven year old eating it. I’ve made the recipe as written and with my own tweaks, based on my preferences. I use thighs as opposed to the whole bird, and I brown them in olive oil first. I like it much better. I also blend all the ingredients together, and add them after I’ve got a good caramel color on my thighs. I don’t find that I care for low sodium over regular, so I’ll switch between the two as I have them in my pantry. This is a very good recipe, enjoyed by all I know

I added a yellow onion which I sautéd in the Dutch oven first, then added the garlic and chicken and browned. Topped with green onions and served on coconut rice. Amazing flavour. I think next time I’ll use cider vinegar and try marinating the chicken in the vinegar and soy, as another reviewer suggested. I much prefer Adobo with ginger so I was happy to find this recipe. Thanks!

I hesitated attempting this for years because I thought it would be complicated but this was soooo easy - just throw all the ingredients in a pan and turn the chicken pieces a couple times while it cooks! Since my grandchildren would be eating this, I did add a couple of tablespoons of honey. Everyone loved it - even the grandkids!

I had a large pack of chicken thighs on hand so used that.  I lightly sautéed a little chopped onion in sesame and olive oils, then added as many thighs as would fit in the pan to brown.  I put that aside and sautéed another pan of onions and chicken.  When almost done, I added some chopped garlic from a jar and finished sautéing. For the sauce, I added a shake of adobo seasoning, coarsely ground pepper, ¼ cup red wine vinegar, ½ cup soy sauce (or less), about a cup of water, 2 bay leaves, and a large spoonful of minced ginger from the jar.  I combined the sauce and browned chicken parts in a large covered Dutch oven and cooked on the lowest simmer flame for about 1 ½ hours.  The family LOVED it!  The flavor was out of this world!

Based upon other reviewers suggestions , here are the adjustments I made. I browned the chicken with onion first, then marinated it for several hours in the vinegar and soy mixture. I used 1 cup of light soy sauce, 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar and 2 cups water along with the ginger, peppercorns, etc.  After cooking the chicken, I removed it from the pan and removed the meat from the bones. I strained all the stuff out of the juice in the pan and then returned the chicken meat to the the pan to reheat to boiling. I added a little cornstarch/water mixture to thicken it just slightly and served it over white rice. 
It could have been even a little more vinegary, but it was delicious as it was. All of us really liked it.

Edited: I've now made this several times. We like both the chicken and pork.

I made it with boneless, skinless chicken breasts but otherwise as the recipe describes.  I could smell the strong vinegar scent, so I read ratings and comments as the chicken was in the Dutch oven.  As a result of reading the comments, I made pretty substantial changes while the chicken was braising.  These changes included: (1) adding 1/2 cup of white granulated sugar, (2) adding 1 + cups of water, (3) adding 1/3 cup of soy sauce and (4) adding a 1/2 cup of sherry.  In addition, I sauteed a round onion and added that and added chopped green onions/chives at the end.  The chicken turned out pretty good with the chicken breasts sufficiently tender and moist after 30 minutes simmering in the Dutch oven.  I gave the recipe two stars because I'm pretty certain it would have been way too vinegary if I hadn't made substantial changes to the recipe.

I'm part Filipino. I was a bit skeptical to make this only because I've never made Adobo on my own before. I mean, my mom makes THE best Adobo ever (I'm sure every Filipino can say the same about their own mom). So, I tried it. And I have to say, it was pretty  close to my mom's. I was so happy. And now, I don't have to go to my mom's for Adobo lol.

Great recipe. I browned red onion, skinless thighs on stovetop. Then used recipes ratios exactly. I did use cider  vinegar and low sodium soy sauce. Tasted at that point but felt it lacked something, so then I also added 1/4 cup white sugar as well as a teaspoon of chili garlic sauce per recipe. I felt the addition of the sugar cut the vinegar taste, you will  end up with sweet, hot, salty, tangy taste. 

Simmered until very tender. The flavor was fantastic. Recipe was doubled and this is the best Chicken Adobo I have ever eaten. Rave Reviews from sons.

This is a great dish, I used apple cider vinegar instead of white and used less-1/2 cup. Turned out wonderfully! Also used 3 cloves of garlic. The apple cider vinegar is less overpowering than the white and gave it a slightly sweet flavor to accompany the spicy taste of the ginger and peppercorns.

I left out the bay and peppercorns since I didn't have them. I used ginger paste which was a bit strong so I added an extra 1/4 cup soy sauce and a couple tsp sugar. I used 4 tbsp garlic powder instead of fresh since that was on hand. I cooked the chicken and cut it up after since I started from frozen. Next time it will thaw and cut the chicken first. It is delicious and the sauce with rice reminds me a little of my friend's Filipino restaurant!

I didn't make any changes. It was  delicious. Some recipes  tell you to add water to the vinegar and soy sauce. This one doesn't and it is much better this way. The flavoring is perfect and this is something I can make quickly when I get home from work.

I made this recipe for my mother on her birthday, who is Filipino, but doesn't cook anymore because of age. I didn't deviate at all from the recipe and it turned out perfectly. Just like I remember eating it when I was a kid growing up. This one is a keeper.

Made for a large group of university students & volunteers and they loved it!! I did add a very large, roughly chopped onion and cooked in a slow cooker.  It was served over Basmati rice.  One of the guests even asked for the recipe.  Thanks!!

This has been one of my families "go to" recipes for years now.  We all absolutely love it, and so does everyone we feed it too.  Occasionally I add more pepper, or more ginger, but otherwise we make it the same every time.  After my daughters have moved out 1 by 1, this is always a recipe they call home about, and ask for.

I found the vinegar to be overpowering.  I already cut down on the vinegar to around 1/3 cup, based on others' suggestions, but still found the dish to be way too sour.  Ended up having to add some sugar and 1/2 cup water to balance it out.  The chicken turned out very tender and juicy, but I think the braising sauce needs some adjustment.

I was looking for something different to make with chicken. This certainly was different.  I used red wine vinegar and I will certainly try other types.  Great dish.

Not a bad recipe. Somehow, it is quite difficult to balance the soy/vinegar ratio. I did marinate it with all the ingredients for 3 hours. Cooked it as instructed and used more soy ratio than vinegar. I browned the thighs after it was cooked. It was ok, but not a real wow factor.

This was good.  I would probably give it a 3/12 star if that was available but went with four cause I can't say anything bad...it just didn't knock my socks off.  Very Easy, quick and I have most items on hand at all times.  Must serve with rice it adds to the meal.

Turned out delicious. Changed it a little, reduced the vinegar to 1/2 cup (used the 3/4 cup per the recipe the first time and it was way too strong for my taste) and left out ginger since I didn't have any.

I didn't realize until I tasted it that I have tasted this before.  I guess I just didn't know what it was called.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and used a 1/4 c of red wine vinegar instead of white vinegar, I also browned my chicken first.  Very delicious will make again.

I rated this a 5 but changed it a little...I used 8 chicken legs & 6 thighs (skin on). 1 cup garlic red wine vinegar, 3/4 cup soy sauce, 1/2 bulb garlic, 1 can chicken broth, 1/2 onion and the rest of the ingredients are the same as original recipe.  I let this cook in the crockpot for 4 hours.  I served this over Jasmine rice. The family could not get enough.  Will make again!!

a lot of strong flavors here.  just to balance everything out, i would suggest a healthy splash of sprite or coke!  (dont be scared!)

when i do my adobo, i marinate the chicen overnight in... no measurements, but pepper, soy sauce, vinegar, lemon juice, and sprite or coke.  the sweetness of the soda rounds out the other strong flavors.  

to cook, i sautee garlic, tomato, and onion, then add and brown the chicken... add the leftover marinade, let it cook...peas at the end so it doesnt get mushy.

I'm 1/2 Filipino and this is similar to what I grew up on.  I brown the chicken first with onion and garlic, then simmer with water, low sodium soy sauce, and rice vinegar.  I throw in a couple bay leaves, a few peppercorns (don't omit these, they are wonderful!) season with pepper, onion & garlic powder. I don't think I use as much vinagar as this recipe calls for, but like a previous viewer said, it takes more than one try to balance the water/soy sauce/vinegar mixture to your taste. I'd probably just add extra water to this recipe.  The other hint is to use low sodium soy sauce, this dish can tend to get very salty with regular soy sauce.  I've never tried ginger, but I will next time I make this dish!  My husband's family (they're German) love this dish!

This was great served on the rice!! I added one cup of water because I thought it would be too strong. I should have just let it alone. Will definitely be making again. Served this with green beans and corn bread.

I'm not an expert cook and this dish was so easy to make. My adobo normally comes out with little flavor and too watery. I followed the recipe along with some tips from the other reviews and this time it turned out the way it's suppose to be! Thanks for sharing!

I made this for a friend who loves Adobo Chicken and lived in the Philippines. He said there shouldn't be any ginger or black peppercorns in it. I also used some cornstarch at the end to help thicken the sauce a little.

We enjoyed this. I did cut the Viniger by 1/3 and added water. We agreed that it needed a little more though. I will be making this again.

This is a good recipe. I did some modifications according to my liking. I decreased the vinegar to 1/4 cup and added it together with 1/2 tsp of olive oil, about 15 minutes before removing the saucepan from the heat. I also added 1/4 cup of water at the beginning of my cooking to boil the chicken longer, it turned out very tender. MY first time to make a great adobo, thank you Liza

The chicken is very tender and I like the ginger.  I thought it had too much of a vinegar taste - maybe it would be better with half as much vinegar.  My family did not like the strong vinegar taste but did like the texture of the chicken.

Terrific recipe.  My Filipino husband loved it, he said "This is exactly how adobo is supposed to taste."  The only thing we might change next time would be to strain the sauce before reducing it, and thicken it with cornstarch.  It was a lot runnier than my mother-in-laws adobo.  It tasted just as good though!

Very good and very easy, though I might add more ginger next time. Quick warning: I used a kosher chicken, which I think is why the dish came out as salty as it did. I would definitely recommend low-sodium soy sauce if working with kosher meat.

I found the flavour to be way too strong for this recipe.  The only person who enjoyed it was my mother, so she had alot to eat.  I wouldnt cook this again.
