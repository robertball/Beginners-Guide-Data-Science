I made these in the prebaked fillo cups for two Christmas parties. At the one they ate every single morsel, but no comments. (Lots of people not a lot of food.) At the other party, ladies only, lots of food, lots of these leftover and still no comments about this recipe. I wasn't crazy about them either. Later I tried some of the unbaked leftovers (without the fillo cups) I had frozen as a dip. Weird eggy quiche like consistancy, although good flavor. I was not going to give up on this recipe, and I personally am not crazy about fillo and didn't want to use the puff pastry cups, so I took egg roll skins and cut them in quarters. Layered two squares opposite each in a flower pattern and put them in mini muffin tins. What a difference this "cheesecake" is in these. Very good and pretty this way. I felt the fillo took away from the taste - not enough filling to dough ratio and the egg roll wrappers just gave it a nice cup to be in with a little crunch with the "petals" sticking out the top. Baked at 350 for 10 minutes an they browned up perfectly.

Don't let the "cheesecake" title keep you away!! This is great.  I used the little phylo pastry cups for a party, and was able to make about 100. Everyone loved them, very elegant.

Absolutely decadent and honestly far easier than anyone would ever believe.  I used the phyllo cups several other people recommended instead of puff pastry.  Garnished with fresh snipped chives and thyme.  I have also used the filling as a baked dip if you don't want to deal with the hassel of filling nearly a 100 of these.  Just buy some very nice crackers or toasts instead to enjoy these delightful bites instead.

Oh. My. Goodness. Since I was taking these to a party, I did as other reviewers suggested and used mini phyllo cups to make 60 appetizers. (This is rather expensive to make because of the cheese and shrimp, so I skimped on the number of cups.) The phyllo dough I bought was already cooked, so I simply heated them with the filling in the oven for about 10 minutes. I still had plenty of filling left over for a cracker spread, but I should have bought more cups- it was hard enough keeping ourselves from eating them before we got there! If you've been looking for a rave-worthy recipe that's always the first to go at a gathering, this is it. Mine were gone in 20 minutes! Thanks for such a great recipe.

I thought this was a very rich recipe, but I loved it.  This  recipe makes A LOT, but  I did freeze the batter and it tasted fine.  I'm thinking you could probably cut the recipe in half.  I used 4 pkgs mini phyllo cups for half  the recipe and froze the rest and used as a hot dip with crackers when I needed it.  I also don't think you need 16 oz. of Gouda.  I believe I only used half of that and I couldn't find smoked.  I did not used the onions or salt.  The second time I made it  I used a pound of shimp to half  the batter recipe.  Much better!

This was a great find, however I am altering it the next time I make it.  There is WAY to much cheese for the amount of shrimp. I am going to do the following: add another pound of shrimp, add a couple cans of real lump crab, add another onion and carmalize them, add a little more garlic, use one smoked gouda and one regular, and call this Shrimp Scampi Rangoon.  I made this for Thanksgiving and put them in the phyllo shells I made in the mini muffin pans. I made 4 dozen and still have half of the mixture left.  I used the other half of the mixture the next day.  I poured it in a glass dish and baked it.  I got a lot of compliments on both and several people asked for the recipe.  I dont think there is enough meat in it.  When I was filling my phyllo cups I was trying to put a shrimp peice in each cup and I found myself digging around in the mixture looking for them.  All in all this was good.  It does make a ton, but it saves well in the fridge. Looking forward to the next time I make it!

My family LOVED these.  Not only was it easy to make, it freezes really well.  It does cost a bit more than other appetizers - I only make it once a year - plus, family & friends rave about it.  It is always a hit at family holiday functions.  I too used the pre-cooked phyllo dough and just filled them up and heated them up in the over.  It has become a family favorite for the holidays.

Wonderful!!  I halved the recipe but used the full 1 lb. of shrimp. Used the mini cups but, as a personal preference, no onion or salt but generously sprinkled shrimp with Old Bay after cooking.  Used Fat Free 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream just to make me feel like I was saving calories. (Yeah, right!!)  My husband isn't usually a fan of smoked gouda but he loved these!

VERY tasty, although I have to admit that I did season w/ every step rather than just waiting until the end to add salt. I also used phyllo cups as I was making these as appetizers for a party. I used 2 lbs. shrimp and only 8 oz. gouda and it tasted great. It makes a LOT - I probably only used 1/3 of it to fill 45 phyllo cups. I did, however, simply bake the rest in a 9X7 casserole and it worked perfectly - I just baked it til the top browned a little and it was great w/ crackers.

These were the best appetizer I've ever made! I did cut the recipe in half except for the shrimp. People couldn't stop eating them and they were all gone before I knew it.  Thanks

Made this appetizer last night for NYE party.  It was fabulous....everyone loved it and ate every last one.  I followed some other reviews and cut the recipe in half. I used individual mini phyllo tart cups (60 total). I prepared the mix prior to the party and upon arriving, I filled the mini tarts, placed on cookie sheet, sprinkled with chopped chives and baked for 10 minutes at 350 degrees.  Initially I was concerned about the consistency of the mix...it seemed runny, but baking melted everything together and they came out perfectly. Wonderful smokey flavor from the gouda.  I am not a great cook and I don't enjoy being in the kitchen:  this recipe however was very simple to make and I will definately make again!

1st this recipe has the worst name, after I got over that and check out the ingredients I was intriqued.  After reading all the glowing reviews I found it a must!  I made it just as written. But...
I found it very disapointing.  My guests were not very interested either and they were all eaters.  It just isn't that special. And it makes SO much, I had tons lefover.  Not impressed, sorry.

I skipped the puff pastry and baked the filling in a deep dish casserole--this recipe makes ALOT! Served it as a dip with crusty bread. Great for a clambake, 3 people asked for the recipe!

I served the filling in the small phyllo pastry cups as suggested by another reviewer and everyone enjoyed them. I baked them in the shells as directed on the back of the phyllo shells box for time and temperature. Very tasty recipe!

This is fantastic.  I used the small phyllo cups to make over 100 appetizers, baking for about 20 minutes (I am at high altitude).  I used the entire pound of shrimp chopped into smaller pieces considering the smaller cups and did not place any on top.  At a party of 40 people, this was THE hit item.

This is great!!  Presentation is everything.  So simple but so elegant looking.  I made it in larger puff pastry shells and also in phyllo dough shells for bite size appetizers.  No fail recipe.  I even had some left over and put it in the freezer.  Thawed,heated in a mini crockpot and served with crackers for unexpected guests!

Wow, I couldn't wait to make these. Unfortunately, I couldn't find the puff shells, so I bought the sheets. Cut and pressed into small bundt cake pan. They came out fine, except I had 1/2 of the batter left. I found 2 small quiche dishes and used the rest of the pastry sheet, baked and filled, baked and enjoyed. I must say to those who do not care for alot of salt, to cut this in half. The gouda provides enough salt. Be sure to mince the onion too. I will make these again. Will see if they freeze and reheat well. Couldn't eat them all!

This is a staple recipe for any of our holiday parties.  I use the mini phyllo cups and have always got many requests for the recipe.  It does make a lot but the mix freezes very well for several months.  Well worth the effort and cost.

Took this to a family reunion with many great cooks around.  They all raved about the taste.  I did as others suggested and used phyllo dough to make small cups and filled.  A lot of work this way, but I enjoy cooking and the work was worth it.

This was the tastiest thing I've ever had or made in a very long time. I made this for my partner on Valentine's Day and she was very pleased. She's been begging me to make them again, I followedthe recipe exactly, and they were delicious.

In addition to the shrimp, I added crabmeat. For this recipe I buy the $5 bag of frozen shrimp from Walmart...tastes great to me. I used regular Gouda, and also used mini phyllo cups instead of the puff pastry shells. I have made this recipe with the shells are there was 2/3 of the mixture still remaining. I also added a little lemon juice and zest. After a little tweeking, this appetizer is fantastic!! Everytime I make them, they ALL get devoured!

Wowzers this is amazing. I've made it for 2 Christmas parties in a row. People can't get enough of it. There is waaaaay more filling than pastry cups, so like everyone says, either double the pastry or cut the filling quantity in half.

I made these and used won ton wrappers with my mini muffin pans and they turned out fantastic.  I used half smoked gouda and half regular gouda. 
I also used a 5 inch springform pan with a cracker crust and it was very tasty but the presentation wasn't the best. Next time I will just bake it in a dish and serve with crackers.
TRY IT YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED

These disappeared in minutes.  They wanted to know where the rest of them were?  They actually looked in the oven to see if there were more!  I made them with mini cupcake pan and just 3 layers of phyllo dough (each layer brushed with melted butter/evoo combo)  This will be at EVERY party I throw!  I think I'd make it as a tart also

If I could give this more then 5 stars, I would!  These are heavenly!!  I used mini phyllo cups and served as an appetizer instead of more of a first course and these disappeared faster then I could refill them!!  You won't be disappointed with this recipe!!!!

My family loves this recipe and requests it every christmas eve.  I always make it in individual little phillo cups (sometimes used for mini cheesecakes) instead of big pastry puffs.  This way it's a simple little appeziter to pop while you mingle at a party.  I found you can make the filling a day ahead to save time.  ENOJOY this is fantastic

I made this to bring to a New Year's party and they were a huge hit!!  I did make a few changes, though. I used regular Gouda, not smoked and sprinkled a little cayenne pepper over top before baking. I used the mini fillo dough cups from the freezer section of the grocery store and they were perfect! I know I will be making these again!

My family & I LOVE these delicious treats. We always have them for holidays & as a special request on birthdays. The only thing I do differently from the recipe is put the cheese/shrimp mixture in pre made phyllo cups. Rich, cheesy & luscious!

WOW!  These were THE hit of my party! Everyone absolutely loved them & kept coming back for more!  It does make a lot . . . I made 45 in mini phyllo cups, then baked some in a small pie plate to use as a dip and I still have about half of it left.  I'm freezing the leftovers to use next week for my book club.  I sure hope it freezes well!  This is fantastic!!!

I made these for a friend's birthday over the holidays last year and they were fantastic! I had to shoo my husband away from eating them all. They were very rich tasting but expensive as others have mentioned. So worth it though! I should note that I did not use the onions as we do not like onions and I would agree with everyone else to use the phyllo sheets and cut them smaller rather than the big phyllo cups. And yes, the name isn't accurate using "cheesecake" but the person submitting it probably had to call it something right?

This is the perfect recipe for special occasions. I used regular gouda instead of smoked, and halved the recipe and still had tons left over.  Next time I will probably quarter the recipe.

Wonderful! I fixed this for New Years Eve it was the hit of the night. I will definitly make this again. I useed regular Gouda as some of the reviewers suggested and put garnished the puff pastry version with 2 large shrimp each. I had enough left over to do 30 small phylo cups to bring to another get together the next day. They were a hit all over again.

This was good but the smoky taste was overpowering, I would recommend using a non-smoked gouda unless you really like a smoky flavour.  Otherwise it was really rich and yummy, I used mini tart shells because I couldn't find phyllo ones.

I finally got around to making this recipe the other night - yum!  I would agree with other posters that if you are making bite-sized appetizers, this makes a LOT (1/2 recipe made more than 60 for me in the small phyllo cups).  My only change would be to either mix in a few chives or sprinkle before baking - they just fell off the top of the finished appetizers.

I don't quite know what to think.  I took the advice of someone else and tried to turn it into a hot dip, but it came out more like a souffle.  It was okay, just not what I was expecting.  Next time I try to use it as a dip, I'll make it without the eggs.  It has potential!

Pretty expensive to make with the cheese & shrimp.  I used puff pastry sheets and cut out mini cupcake sized shells...cooked the shells then stuffed them with the filling.  With the original recipe I was able to make almost 60 appetizers.  The whole process took two days -- too much time!

Not sure what size pastry shells they used but I filled 24 mini phyllo shells and then made 24 more with egg roll skins and ended up throwing away extra. For a smaller gathering I would cut this at least in half. Pretty tasty, everyone kept going back for more.

This looked like too much cream cheese for me.  I cut way back on the cream cheese not only so the flavor of the shrimp would shine through, but also for the calories. Even using less cream cheese, it still had a wonderful creamy cheese sauce.  I would eliminate adding salt.   It was absolutely scrummy.  I bet this would be delicious with scallops too.

Very bland, I added fresh grated ginger for accent.

The ingredients listed would make dozens.  I used 4oz cream cheese, 12oz shrimp, one egg, 1/4# of gouda and no cream.  Still had left over for 12 appetizers.

I did not use puff pastry, but rather mini tart shells.  the recipe calls for 12 pastry shells but the filling makes enough for several dozen.  Also, the directions say to saute the onions and garlic and to drain, reserving the garlic.  The recipe then states to add the garlic with the shrimp and later to add the onions.  This was confusing to say the least.  I added the onion and garlic to the skillet during the first step and ignored the latter direction to add the garlic to the shrimp.  
Once I got it all sorted out and cooked , these 'tartlets' were delicious and were a hit with my family at Christmas.

Tried with both puff pastry and fillo cups.  My guests much preferred the puff pastry, however the fillo cups work very well as a passed appetizer.

My first question is 12 pastry shells.  I made 40 mini-muffin sized phyllo dough puffs and still had plenty left.   Flavor was disappointing.  Way too much work and way too costly for a less than mediocre appetizer.

I made this for New Years Eve.  Great recipe; smoked gouda a must; made way too much.  I used the puff pastry in the freezer section (6 per pkg), which made them a meal.  I'll look for the smaller appetizer sized ones next time.  I cut the recipe in half and I still had way too much.  I put the rest in a container, heated it up the next night and served it with bread (bagette).  Yum.  Thank you...this is definitely a keeper!

Excellent! I used the large and small pre-made crusts and they came out perfectly. I used half n'half instead of cream since the store was out (holiday) and it seemed to work fine. I set my oven to 375 for 25 minutes. I also scaled down the recipe and it definitely  makes at least twice as much than the recipe scale says.
