Love it. I used this recipe for the dressing only, when  make pasta salad i use just about everything in the fridge.  I did have to make a substitution. We are  family of 8 so  triple every recipe, i only had  half the rice vinegar so I used balsamic as well. Also I   did add wasabi. Very flavorful. Sushi flavor on point. Will make again. Thank you.
