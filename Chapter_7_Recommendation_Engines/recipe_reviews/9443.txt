The "soft ball stage" is when you can dribble a bit of the mixture into a bowl of water, then scoopr it up and form it into a ball that can be flattened.  In other words, the ball should hold its shape (i.e., not fall apart), but should be "squishable" --not like a marble.  For me, this happened at 8 minutes without a problem, so you probably don't even need to worry about the soft ball stage.

Wow! This took almost no time at all and are definitely addictive!  Watch the sugar mixture carefully, because mine reached the soft ball stage after just 3-4 minutes at medium-low (I turned the flame down because I was using a small 2qt pot).  If you're not sure how to tell when it's done, check out www.exploratorium.edu/cooking/candy/sugar-stages.html.  It has short videos of the different candy making stages and has been a lifesaver for me.  These nuts are so crispy and delicious -- I'll bet pecans would be terrific too!

Thank you so much for this perfect recipe!!!!  My family LOVES these.  If you don't boil the syrup enough, the nuts come out cloudy and the sugar forms crystals that are kind of powdery but they still taste good.  Try using pecans and substituting a 1/2 teaspoon of cardamom or Chinese five spice powder instead of 1/2 teaspoon of the cinnamon.  Also, I dump the nuts out on a SILPAT or on parchment paper to "dry".  Last time I made them I must have not boiled the syrup enough, and I didn't think they were ever going to set, but I left them out on the parchment paper overnight, and they turned out perfectly.  Thanks again.

First of all I want to say this recipe is great!  I used pecans since I'm using them to decorate a butter pecan cake.  I do want to warn some people that try to make this though.  The first time I tried it my candy thermometer DID NOT read "soft ball" stage so I continued to cook it.  It suddenly became so hard I couldn't even stir it.  The second time around, I set the timer for 8 minutes exactly, per directions, and it did the same thing.  The third time I cooked it I set a bowl of very cold water next to the pan and kept testing it until it reached the "soft ball" stage and it ended up perfect...only ending up cooking it about 4 1/2 minutes total.  They taste awesome and my husband, who HATES nuts, said "wow, I could eat a whole lot more of those!"

I love candied walnuts but the calories are way too much! Since this recipe seemed easy enough, I used Splenda in place of the cup of sugar. They came out great! I served them up to people and they gobbled them up without any hesitation! I will definitely make again, change the spices slightly as I like a little more zip than the cinnamon alone provided.

It was quick and easy, even for a non-cook like me. I did not measure temp, just let the sugar mix cook for 8 min. I did add a little more cinnamon for added flavor. This recipe will be one of my "regulars".

These are wonderful. I have made them with the walnuts, also with almond and pecans, all were great. You would have to be NUTS not to like these.

These are delicious!!!  Not only are they great by themselves, but I also put them in salad w/ raspberry vinaigrette dressing.  I will definitely make them at Christmas to share with my family & friends! Even if you aren't a nut lover, you will love these because they are more like a candy.

Yum!  I must have done something wrong b/c mine were soo wet and sticky but they tasted great!  I did not have a candy thermo so perhaps that has something to do with it..but I plan on practicing this one more.  My hub said it's the best thing I've ever made... go figure.

These are so good, BUT you can even make these easier.  
I put the sugar, water, cinnamon a little salt, BUT I add cayenne pepper, no milk or vanilla...and do in a cast iron skillet on th stove....Way faster and just as good with a bit of a 'bite'...YUM>>>>took me no time at all.  Going to garnish my Waldorf salad with these wonderful walnuts.  Happy Summer

Great recipe! I made this as Valentines Day gifts and people loved it.
A few comments:
1) I doubled the recipe, but I wouldn't make much more than that at one time unless you have a very big bowl -- you need space in the bowl to mix.
2) I made this with both walnuts and pecans.  Both were great, but I really really loved the pecans.
3) The recipe says to add the nuts to the syrup, but in that case you'd be making a small amount of syrup in a very large pot, which is difficult.  I put the nuts in a large bowl and added the syrup to the bowl to mix.

These  are delicious. The second time I made them I put all the ingredients in a sauce pan and brought it to boiling stirring frequently. Then I added the nuts and continued boiling til all liquid was evaporated and nuts are all coated. Pour them on to parchment paper and let them cool for 15 mins. Be patient and dont remove from stove until all liquid is gone, much easier and much faster and just as delicious.

I have made this recipe several times and it has turned out perfect every time.  Besides tasting great, they also make you house smell wonderful while preparing.  I made a large batch so I would always have on hand.   Also made them for Christmas to add to my cookie trays.

I have been trying to eat ultra healthy for a long time now, so sweets are not a normal part of my diet.  I just made these with some healthy modifications, and they are SO DELICIOUS.  Instead of milk, I used plain, unsweetened rice milk ( same measurements ).  Instead of sugar, I used erythritol ( again, same measurements ).  You get all the flavor, and no dairy or sugar.  This recipe is a real winner, and the times listed are perfect!!!

I have never attempted anything like this before, and it was so simple and the results were great.  I did find out that 4 c are in one pound, because I halved it and needed to know.  I used my candy thermometer and had no problems getting it to soft ball stage.  You have to work rather quickly to seperate the nuts, but that's easy peasy.  My husband gobbled them up!

A friend of mine made me a salad that had these as well as raisins, blue cheese and a raspberry balsamic vinaigrette dressing. It was so good, and I had to find out how to make the candied walnuts. Thanks so much for the recipe! I'd also like to try them with Splenda and cinnamon, as suggested by another reviewer.

These walnuts are fantastic and so easy to make!  I used them in a salad with dried cranberries, clementines and baby greens topped with a white balsamic vinegarette dressing.

I made them today, and the walnuts came out perfect. It was a cinch to make. Parchment paper works very well. I didn't have a candy thermometer, either. But I just followed the directions--no problem. Even though it's after Christmas, I plan on serving them on New Year's Eve. Healthy treat, too, since walnuts give us the good fatty acids.

I actually used a candle thermometer AND the 8 minute guide AND the cold water test for cooking the sugar mixture. Everything worked out perfectly. I brought it to a boil and turned it on medium since I was nervous about burning it.  I kept using the cold water test before the 8 min time and before the thermometer showed the right heat "just in case" my sugar mixture was cooked enough before then.  But everything came together perfectly at once: temp 230-ish degrees; cooking time 8 min buzzer, drop was softball-ish in cold water.   My husband liked this recipe for the cinnamon flavor compared to the ones we got from a friend w/o it.   I will definitely make this again.  Thank you!

excellent. easy. for those who burn sugar easily (like me) I just stayed glued to the pot  and stirred unceasingly and quickly. I also did it on medium rather than medium high and it seemed to work fine

These are AWESOME--and so easy! I used some peanuts instead of walnuts; it took me less than 20 minutes from start to finish. They look wonderful and tasted delicious. Heh--I think I know what everyone is getting for Christmas this year!

My two year old and I can't stop eating these. They are so good. I wasn't even sure about the candy stages, but I just cooked the mixture about 8 minutes and called it good. I love these in salads too!

So easy!! I don't have a candy thermometer, so I trusted other reviewers who said that the 8 minutes was accurate. I forgot to add the vanilla, but they still turned out great! I'll definitely use this recipe again, and like others mentioned, I'll try pecans too!!

These are addicting! Only thing I would mention is that 1 lb of nuts is too much for the recipe.  I found that I had to make 2 batches of the sugar recipe to properly coat 1 lb of walnuts.  Other than that a GREAT recipe!

Great recipe. Just like the ones you get at the craft fairs (That I usually spend $8 for a small bag). I forgot to add the vanilla and turns out it doesn't really need it. I would make that an optional ingredient.

Fantastic!  I roasted the walnuts for about 15 minutes because I like them a little crunchier and more toasty, but this recipe is wonderful.  I used to slave over candied nuts at Christmas time, but this will now be my go-to recipe.  Thanks you!

These are wonderful!  I was making them for family and for my coworkers, and I had to bag them very quickly so I didn't keep eating them!  I didn't have to change a thing!  I assume they'd be great with pecans as well.  Thanks so much

WOW !  Easy, fast and FABULOUS.   I'm making candied nuts for my father-in-law and I've been testing lots of recipes on this site.  THIS IS IT!  Thanks for sharing.    AND   Thanks to all for sharing your soft ball and sugar tips.

These were easy and fantastic!  I used mostly walnuts, but also added some almonds and pecans.  I also added a dash of allspice and grated in some nutmeg as well to give it a little extra fall flavor.  I made them to snack on at work and I'm not sure they are going to make it to the office. I will definitely use this recipe again and again! Update:  I thought that these turned out just as intended, but after reading reviews, the sugar on mine is a bit crystalized and powdery.  Instead of using the thermometer next time, I'm going to try the cold water/soft ball test to really make sure I get it right.  Even if I can't figure out how to make the soft ball stage, I'll still continue making these because they are that good.

This recipe is all that it claims.  Wonderful candied walnuts for every occasion.  I prepared them to go with a salad, and they were easy to prepare, all around.  As I have a convection oven, I limited the roasting for the walnuts to about 7 minutes.  I timed this to correspond with the preparation of the sugar mixture, which I heated to about 220 F.  Then, mixing them while still hot, and when fully coated, spread them on a cool baking sheet lined with parchment paper, allowed separation of the nuts without sticking together.  And to top it off, they tasted great!

Ohmygoodness these are SO DELICIOUS!!  I tripled the recipe for my Costco 1.36 kg bag of almonds, and I had to cook the syrup for about 12 minutes, and it turned out perfectly, so simple to make.  My whole family LOVES this recipe, we have a new family favorite!

I cannot make them fast enough for my husband.  I made them for my co-workers for Christmas and my husband was mad at me because he didn't want to share them.  I also have tried using other nuts (cashews & pecans).  They turned out really awesome as well but there is something about the walnuts that make them my favorite.  DO NOT forget to toast the nuts 1st.  The flavor you get from doing that is probably one of the most important things.  My husband & I thank you for sharing this recipe!

These nuts are excellent! Very easy recipe to follow, just don't forget the vanilla!! Everyone loved them. When measuring the nuts, use exactly what the recipe calls for or less because there may not be enough syrup to cover them all. Good luck!

This recipe is easy to make and is sooooo delicious!  I ran out of sugar, so I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar - even better!  The nuts tasted like the goo used on the pecanbons at Cinnabon.  Yummy!

I only had half a pound of chopped walnuts so I baked those half the cooking time. (so 325° for 4 min) and followed the recipe exactly. I followed another reviewers advice and lightly salted (with sea salt) the candied walnuts as they cooled. VERY YUMMY!! I will always have a bowl of candied walnuts within reach from now on! This recipe is so easy and very versatile, next time I'm using pecans!

These were easy to make and a huge hit at the holidays.  I had many requests for the recipe!  Next time I will try with almonds.

Just finished making these and I don't know if they will make it to the party! SO good! One piece of advice. Once you add the walnuts to the syrup stir fast!

Good recipe.  The only thing I did not like was the look/texture of the coating.  It had a cloudy/granular look to it.  I wanted a special "Zip" to them by adding 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne powder, and reduced the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon.  This made them the perfect flavor for salads.

these made my day :) I originally made them for a strawberry spinach salad, now I'm thinking ice cream, and we're even enjoying them plain! I roasted the walnuts in my toaster oven because it's really hot, so I had to do them in 2 batches, but it worked really well.

I have these cooling on wax paper right now!  These came out awesome!  I don't have a candy thermometer, but I do have a digital liquid thermometer which I used to achieve the 236F.  The sauce is the PERFECT amount for 1lb of walnuts.  These are sure to be a hit and this recipe couldn't be ANY easier.

These are amazing and so simple to make.  I, like several other reviewers, found that the sugar mix only need to boil for about 4.5 minutes. I have varied it a bit with several batches.  My favorite was adding a teaspoon of allspice.

This is the best reciepe I have found for candied nuts.  I have made them several way feel this is the best tasting.  I add two teasp of cloves and one teasp of chili powder for spice.  They are very good in salad as small packet for gifts.

I thought other reviewers were too hard on this recipe. I rated it 5 stars hands down. I have never made any type of nuts before and everyone loved these. It was like I had been doing it for years! I thought it was very simple and delicious.
Thank you so much!

Very good taste. I actually spiced it up with some added cloves and instead of one teaspoon of vanilla, I did one tablespoon, which I know sounds like a lot, but I like vanilla and the walnuts are so good. Next time I think I would do less cinnamon...maybe a half a teaspoon less would tone it down a little. All in all, I really appreciated the recipe. Thanks!

Excellent! SO easy. I didn't use a thermometer- I just kept stirring with a whisk until it resembled a dark caramel, dumped the walnuts in (which i just lightly toasted in a frying pan on low heat), and then immediately dumped the mix out on wax paper and separated. These are perfect on their own or added to a mixed green salad with feta, cranberries, and pears. yummm!

I had trouble with this recipe..... Probably more user than recipe itself. I made one batch of syrup, and it instantly turned to a solid chunk once I added the vanilla. Scratch that batch and made another one removing it much earlier from the heat. Worked much better the second time. You are probably better to remove from heat early, and adjust with the next batch as necessary.

I almost had certain disaster.  I followed the reciped and when I added the walnuts the sauce dried completely - not coating them.  I added more milk - put them back on heat and was able to salvage them.  My son loved the.

These are very very good! I own a candy thermometer...that I have never used until now. I am a beginner and these were very easy to make. I did check out my thermometer in boiling water to make sure is measured accurately. I used my enameled cast iron pot which was perfect because it heats evenly with out any 'hot spots'. (2 qt pot)  I made two batches today. On the first batch they boiled for more than 8 min with out reaching the soft ball stage on my thermometer. On the second batch I turned up the heat just a bit and had not problem reaching the soft ball stage. Both batches turned out great, however the second batch looked nicer- better color and a little better crunch. These will be great gifts for Christmas. Somthing about the walnuts in this recipe is perfect. I am not a big walnut fan- but they are great in this recipe.

I'm a beginner in the cooking/baking world and was happily surprise to find that even I could make this recipe. The walnuts taste great and I even used almonds and pecans on my next attempt. All turned out delicious. This will probably become a regular Christmas recipe for our family.

I like a little more bite but these were still tasty.  Think these would go over well at a holiday party or as a gift for a nut lover especially since they are easy to make.

This is an awesome recipe!!  Any nuts leftover at the end of this baking season are going to end up candied with this recipe.  I used a candy thermometer to take the mixture exactly to the softball stage and when mixed with the toasted nuts the mixture starting to harden immediately.  They could be eaten in about 10 minutes.  I think next time I will make a little more of the candy mixture as this just barely covered one pound of nuts (which according to my kitchen scale was close to 4 cups) I also think I will incorporate pecans, and almonds and other nuts as well as maybe try more spices such as some nutmeg.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I had a bunch of walnuts in my freezer but needed candied walnuts for a recipe and I stumbled on this  recipe. Wow! These are great. And they're actually really easy to make. I was worried about whether or not I'd be able to get to "soft ball" stage without a candy thermometer, but the water test actually worked great (my first time using that!). I used half the cinnamon and added 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper because I'm using these in a salad and I was afraid the cinnamon might be overpowering. They came out great, but I would do the full 2 tsp of cinnamon if I were making these just to eat.  HINT: Make sure you roast your walnuts long enough. I took mine out a little too early and my walnuts don't have that nice crunch I was going for, but it doesn't affect the taste. This is a keeper - way cheaper than buying candied walnuts!! Thanks for posting this!

Let me firt start off saying...I give this recipe a HUGE A++++++! We had gotten a recipe for candied walnuts and ended up comparing this recipe along side the other one...and this recipe just topped the other one. We were concerned with the "softball" stage as well as a few others on here..but after timing for 8 minutes nothing really happened..still kinda soupy but within minutes it just started to harden..so you'll notice when it looks ready! so this is a fantastic recipe and thank you for sharing it with all of us!!! Take care!! :)

Thank You for the great recipe!!! I took this recipe with me to Germany in December. I am always baking something new for them. They DEVOURED them. I could not make enough. I was making new batches every other day. In the four weeks I was there I made over five pounds.

Delicious.  We substituted organic almond milk and organic sugar for the conventional counterparts and combined raw almonds, pecans and walnuts for an amazing variation to this wonderful recipe.  We plan on making several pounds of this for the holidays.  Can't wait. Thanks for sharing Dawn!!!

Update, this year we made them again.  This time we substituted the almond milk with equal parts of Bailey's Irish Cream, Rum Chata and Kahlua.  In another batch we used equal parts of Rum Chata and Captain Morgan's spiced rum.  Delicious.

Fabulous!  But, like others, I took my eyes off the pot for one minute.  Sugar turned completely grainy, but I reconstituted it with milk - one tablespoon at a time.  Very forgiving.  It's a keeper.

This recipe is so easy and they are so good.  I was surprised at how easy the sugar was to make, as it sounded complicated. I had never heard of the soft ball stage, but after you tubing it, I understood it better.  Got lots of compliments and  never come home with extras when I bring them places, thnx for the recipe and other reviews, they very helpful.

8 minutes was WAY too long to bake the nuts, mine burned! I did a second batch and roasted them for 4 minutes and they were perfect. I did not like the consistency of the candy. I will stick with the cinnamon roasted almonds recipe on this site and switch out the nuts.

These candied walnuts are Amazing! I halfed the recipe so it wouldn't make as much... Now I am wishing I made the whole recipe so I had more! There is the perfect amount of all of the ingredients and you still get the walnut taste without the sweetness being too overpowering. Thank you Dawn for posting this amazing recipe!

SO easy, SO yummy and SO loved by everyone here.  I candied some for a salad and then ended up trying it with almonds and pecans - all excellent.  They now all go on my plates for cookie exchange at Christmas - thank goodness no one knows how easy they are to make - huge hit with everyone.

Easy and awesome! However, be careful when you store them - other things in the cabinet will pick up the cinnamon flavor. Put them in something airtight (not just a ziplock bag).

So Good! 2 suggestions: 1 - make sure you cook the walnuts long enough, I had never baked nuts before and the first time I made these I didn't bake the walnuts long enough. If your not sure, take them out, let them cool, and then taste to make sure they're done. 2 - If you don't have a candy thermometer make sure to check often for soft ball stage, the difference between soft ball and hard ball is only 30 seconds to a minute.

Great recipe.. Very easy and good. I thought perhaps the cinnamon would be too strong, but it was just right. At first I  was afraid they would be sticky, but after sitting, overnight, they are just right!

I've been making these for two year for Thanksgiving now, and I always follow the recipe to the letter.  They're absolutely perfect and EXTREMELY addictive!  Make sure that you separate them with a fork on waxed paper immediately after they come out of the pot.

just make sure you cook the nuts long enough until they are really hard because otherwise once you added the mixture to them they get soft

Toasting nuts before hand is important.  you can skip the step, as some recipes do, but it's better if you toast.  I substitute water for milk so I can share the nuts with my vegan friends.

These nuts were great.  The only change I made was I used pecans and put the nuts back into the oven once they cooled to make them crispier.  I made the nuts to use in salads, but ate all of them before I got the chance to serve the salad :o(  I have a recipe for candied nuts made in the microwave.  It is very easy and good, but these are better.  Thanks Dawn.

LOVE IT!  LOVE IT!  LOVE IT!  I had been looking for a recipe to replicate my Great Grandmother's Candied Walnuts and I came upon this one.  I have used this recipe and could not be happier.  I made it for a catering of 200 people and topped a spring salad with them.  The raves were unending!!!!! Thank you!!!

Bravo!  This is a great recipe!  It's very simple, doesn't have a lot of ingredients, and looks beautiful in a gift tin.  Great flavor and crunch. I love the fact that there's no butter to add more fat.  Thanks

So good! I used splenda and nonfat milk and I put them in a salad with blue cheese crumbles and a light cranberry vinaigrette dressing and they added so much to it! I also just love to make them to snack on since they are a great, healthy snack and so satisfying! GREAT!

This was a major hit at my party for 100 people.  I made this x4, and my neighbour and I nibbled at them constantly as we prepared the other dishes.  Great instead of the usual peanuts and chips.  RECOMMEND HIGHLY !!  *****

This is a great recipe!  I made with walnuts the 1st time and with pecans the next time- both were very good. I put these in 1 pint jars and sold them at a craft sale for $5- I put out samples and everyone who tried them bought them.  I also put them on the Cranberry Spinach Salad thats on this site- really great!!

I made this last year, but not in time to give as gifts.  This year, I planned ahead and I'm including this in my sweet treats gift baskets.  Easy to do and I haven't met anyone who doesn't love them.  You can also use other nuts....to die for pecans!

Great recipe! The only modification I did was half the sugar. As much as I love sweets, 1 cup takes away from the wholesome toasty flavor of the walnut. Otherwise, Dawns candied walnut recipe is a serious winner! :-)

This recipe was delicious & awesome for salads or toppings to my coffee cake & cinnamon buns! I would just throw these in everything :) I've made these walnuts dozens of time & every time I make it they're gone in minutes. Thanks dawn! I tweeked the recipe a lil I used 1.5 teaspoons of cinnamon & 1/2 a teaspoon of nutmeg :) I have also forgotten to put vanilla in one of the batches :( but it was still delicious! 5 stars!

They tasted great, even though I forgot to add the vanilla.  I would have liked a little more candy on my walnuts, though, so next time I'll double the recipe for the syrup.  I had no trouble with the drying, as the sugar hardened almost immediately.

I usually make a thicker gooier more decadent recipe than this but wanted my walnuts light and slightly sweet for a deconstructed apple pie.  It turned out perfect.  I added a touch of cardamon, since I wanted to incorporate this flavor in my apple pie.  Yum!  Thanks!

I certainly don't need a special occasion to make these yummy little gems! Walnuts, pecans, almonds.....they all turn out well. The only thing I do differently is use half brown sugar/half white, and decrease the amount of cinnamon to 3/4 tsp. As they cool, I sprinkle lightly with sea salt.  Great in salads, yogurt, ice cream or just by the handful! Fanastic and addictive!

love the idea of using Spenda but didn't think Splenda cooked to the same stages  as sugar.  Has any one  else tried them this way? would love to make them for diabetic mother-inlaw with a kick of cayenne. more info or any hints would be greatly appreciated.

I have made this recipe 2 times, and everyone has loved it both times.  I add the candied walnuts to Mixed Spring Greens, raspberries and strawberries, shaved parmesan and a raspberry vinaigrette.  LOVE!!

These were wonderful!!  I made them to put into a cherry chicken green salad, and couldn't keep my hands off of them waiting for dinner.  They were fantastic in the salad too.  Thanks for the recipe, so simple!!

These turned out well I think...are they suppose to be a little grainey/gritty? I used a digital thermometer to make sure i brought the sugar mixture up to the right temp...I'd prolly make them again. My sister (whos a pastry chef lol) suggested lightly salting them as they cool. Wish I would have known that before hand!

these are divine. i was confused at first about when to start counting down the '8 minutes'....8 minutes as soon as you put it on the stove? or 8 minutes after it start boiling? so, i just started the 8 minutes as soon as i turned the burner on, while also using a candy thermometer to check the temp...and it worked!  did a test batch first, and now that i know this is fool proof, delicious, and hella easy, i will be making a whole bunch of these candied walnuts to give away for christmas!

Thanks so much for this recipe! I made these to jar up as a fast gift, and it took me about half an hour total from start through clean up. Amazing that something this yummy takes so little time to prepare.  They look great in the jars, and I will definitely be making these again!

I love the flavor on this recipe.  I used almonds and the flavor reminds me of the vendor cinnamon almonds sold.  I thought it was easy enough to make too.  What I didn't like was the coating is clumpy and sugary.  I was hoping for a coating that was more smooth and clear.  I'm going to experiment to try and master that.  Good recipe though.

This was really easy and delicious! I used pecans instead of walnuts, and instead of 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, I used just 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, so it also had some cloves/nutmeg/ginger flavors, which turned out wonderful!

This was my first time making candied nuts and I made these exactly as directed, except I halved the recipe. I served them in a spinach salad. Everybody liked them so much I put more out with the pumpkin pie. I'll definitely make these again.

Fot those of you, like me who had the walnnuts from Costco. 1 POUND of WALNUTS is 4 CUPS. My soft ball satge came at 8 min. I follwed the recipe exactly. These were super easy. I think next time I would play around with the spices and add cloves and use only 1/2 tsp of vanilla. I think the vanilla is too over powering.

These were SO good!!  I've never made candy before and had a large bag of pecans.  I was so careful with the first batch and tried to catch the "soft ball" stage as suggested in the review, but I think I just missed it.  It was difficult to mix the nuts somewhat as they hardened very quickly.  But it still tasted so good.  I tried again right away, being more careful, and was much more aware of the soft ball stage. I added a little nutmeg to this batch.  It came out perfect, with each nut being well coated and tasted like it could have been purchased.  I mixed some of each batch into a snack size ziplock bag and gave them to the attendees at our Bible study and everyone loved them.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I'll be trying it again w/ walnuts and pecans next time.

Amazing!  I quartered the recipe and the mixture only took about 4 minutes to reach the proper stage/consistancy.  Also, if you happen to have GRANITE countertops, no need to use parchment paper...just plop the nuts directly onto the granite and immediately separate with a fork.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe--I'm using them for a salad for dinner.

This is a great recipe! I followed it to the T, except I added a bit more salt because we like a mix between sweet and salty. Oh, I also added a dash of nutmeg. Overall, an amazing recipe! My whole family enjoyed it.

Delicious!!  I made these for a salad topping, and used pecans instead of the walnuts.  Great paired with baby greens, dried cranberries, and cinnamon croutons (found on this site).  We used a raspberry vinagrette to top it all off.  I will definitely be making these again

I cut the recipe in half cause I didn't need as much.  I substituted half the milk for spiced rum and added about 1 tbsp maple syrup just to make it a bit different.  Delicious.

Easy, and delicious.  Everyone that has tried them, have loved them.  I have a lot of clients, and I sample out some things during the holidays to get an idea of what I want to put in a gift basket for them for Christmas.  So far it has been an excited "two-thumbs-up!!!" from everyone that has tried them.  This is a VERY easy recipe to follow, and it yields a super yummy treat.  DON'T PASS THIS ONE UP!!!

This recipe was so quick and easy. I am not a candy maker but managed to do it perfectly the first time.  I too put a bowl of ice cold water next to the sauce pan and periodically dripped the sugar mix into the water.  I noticed a change around 6 minutes 30 seconds and knew that is what "soft ball" must mean. I also used Silpat to spread the nuts on and they turned out beautifully. If you are a snitcher chew a piece of gum to avoid eating too many.

I don't have a candy thermometer and I didn't have any trouble with getting to the soft-ball stage.  I had a bowl of cool water to test it.  At 8 minutes I tried and it was there.  After putting on wax paper I had to try them before they were cooled all the way.  I really like them and will make them for Christmas.  Thank you Dawn.

Loved it.  Be sure to make them early, as it takes a long time (ie. hours) for the coating to properly harden to the point that you can pick up the walnuts without having them leave stickiness on your fingers.  Also, if you have leftover sauce, try making toffee by adding chopped walnuts, and spreading the sauce & chopped nuts mixture over a cooking-spray coated foil baking pan.  I used some of my leftover sauce to pour over the cooling walnuts.

The coating adhere to the nuts very well. Taste like a store brand. I have tried candied nuts recipe before, but this is the best. Because of past poor results, I almost did not try this one. These will be a great addition to my spinach salad.

Super easy, super fast.  Be sure to use the best cinnamon you can buy, it makes all the difference.  Great on a goat cheese salad.

I halved the recipe and I cooked the sugar mixture for about 5 mins.. way too long!!! It reached hard-ball stage at that point. The walnuts however still tasted great only they turned out powdery. I will certainly try this recipe again. I want also to try hazelnuts.

Excellent, family and friends loved them. I used almonds instead of walnuts and the second time I made it I added a  tablespoon of butter to the mixture while it was still cooking, which made it taste even better.

i gave these a five only after some changes to the recipe.  i did use a pound of walnuts...but the first batch i made i followed the recipe exact and they were waaaayyy to sugary for my taste. so i made a few more batches but i increased the cinnamon and vanilla to 1 1/2 teaspoons and i cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup and they tasted much better for my taste.  hope this helps for anyone who wants to cut back on the sugar.

I've made this recipe twice in a week and I really enjoy it! I added a bit more sugar and cinnamon the second time and the covering on the nuts was more coarse and sugary-feeling but still tasted fine. These are addicting!

I usually make a spiced walnut recipe with egg whites.  They're good but not very pretty.  In the picture, these looked a lot prettier than mine so I thought I'd try them.  I didn't use a candy thermometer, I just heated it for the eight minutes, and it turned out great!  Everyone raved and several people asked for the recipe.  Thanks for another great recipe.

These were ok. I don't know if I made a mistake. They didn't turn out candied. They were more "sugared". The coating is powdery. They tasted ok, but I don't know if I'd make them again.

I don't know what I did wrong but it didn't work out as I thought.  I don't think that there was enough syrup and I wouldn't even call it syrup cause as soon as I put it on the walnuts it turned into sugar again and didn't cover all of the walnuts.

I love this recipe!!!  I found this on a quest to duplicate the Field Greens Salad at California Pizza Kitchen.  These walnuts were perfect!  My boyfriend couldn't stop eating these and already made me promise to make more.

As far as ease of preparation, I have no idea what the "soft ball stage" is, but the mixture was at a hard boil and all of the sugar crystals had dissolved when I added the vanilla.  Other than that, it was quick and easy to make...and surprisingly - it was a breeze to clean up.  Thanks so much Dawn!!

I don't know if I did it wrong, but 8 minutes was wayyyy too long to boil, turned into hard chunks of sugar that wouldn't stick to the walnuts.  Will not make this again.

I have used this recipe from my Dad's cousin Beth Overland for the last 20+ years.  Beth used to make these wonderful treats every year at Christmas, and I have followed the tradition and received MANY compliments.  This is a delicious and EASY recipe.  Enjoy!

This recipe isn't very time consuming, just a tad expensive if you were to make some for gifts.  It's ultra yummified!  Try it!

Very fast and easy.  These disappeared lightning quick at a potluck I brought them to.  It is impossible to eat just one.

I will definitely make again. I made a couple changes. I added 1tbs butter and 4tbs of milk and 2tbs heavy cream instead of 6tbs milk. This was so simple and very very good

Really good flavor and quick to make!  I must not have cooked the sugar mixture right though because it kind of dried up when stirring the nuts. About half of them were not coated completely.  But they tasted good anyway. We ate those and kept the fully coated ones to serve on the goodie trays.

These were so easy and so delicious!!! The only thing I did different was add 1 more teaspoon of vanilla (because you can never have to much vanilla) and I also added a little pumpkin spice that another reviewer suggested. Amazing!!!!

This is my husband's favorite Christmas treat that I make. I always follow the recipe exactly and they always turn out perfectly! This year I (accidentally) added extra vanilla and they were even better! Thanks for posting your recipe and adding a family tradition!

I cooked it to exactly the soft-ball stage, and if still came out too sugary in its constancy....but great flavor!  Oh, almost forgot, I also added 1/3 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper, for a little bite. So good.

A good recipe but it should come with a warning. "Do not turn you're back on the sugar mixture, even for a second." That's what I did and the results were not good. I turned off the sugar to put the walnuts into a bowl and when I went to get the sugar it had harden. I tried to save it by reheating it. I had to add some more milk, but by the end it had slightly burned and there wasn't enough to cover all the nuts. I'd recommend making the walnuts first and then the sugar glaze. But even though I made a mistake, the nuts came out delicious. Perfect to add to ice cream to make it special.

Awesome!  I chopped the walnuts a little before making and sprinkled them on roasted carrots and brussel sprouts lightly coated with brown butter.  Served with prime rib and potatoes for Christmas dinner.  Lots of compliments on the combo of savory/sweet.

easy, tasty, pretty. After I put them in a Christmas tin, I took two candy canes, crushed them (not too finely) and sprinkled them over the walnuts. Added a nice "zing".

These are the best! I initially made them as gifts but had to make a second batch because we couldn't stop eating them. The next time I made them I substituted almonds and used orange extract instead of vanilla. If you sprinkle in a little orange zest when you add the extract it gives them a nice zing.

I have made these nuts for years.  Learned that if you stir the nuts [after syrup has been added] until they appear dry you just have to pour them out onto a cookie sheet to cool.  It takes just a few minutes. No sticky syrup mess, and nuts are good to go almost instantly.

I like this recipe a lot.  I find that the coating goes on the nuts easily and its not to sweet.  In the reviews I read complaints about it not being sweet enough.  I think this recipe was meant to compliment the flavor of the nuts and not overpower them.  So the nuts play a bigger role in this recipe than just adding crunch underneath a sweet coating.  I ate these by themselves, but tomorrow I plan to have them on a salad and I think they would be yummy that way too.

Absolutely amazing! I read the other reviewers concerns about exactly how many minutes it would take to get to 236, but I didn't seem to have any trouble. I paid attention to the thermometer, not the clock! These came out so wonderfully. I'll never buy these again! These are way better than anything I could buy. I'm eager to try this with other nuts, too!

Everyone loved them except me but I'm not sure I like Candied Walnuts.. these were easier to make than I'd thought and used the second reviewer's link, very helpful. One reviewer said to stir this together in a big stockpot before laying it out on paper and I did that.. it was very easy to mix up that way. Also, I didn't have wax paper so I put them on a broiler pan to cool and it cleaned up pretty easily too.

I made these to go in a strawberry and spinach salad b/c I was tired of payin $3/.5 cups.  I mixed walnuts and pecans to = 1lb so I wouldn't have to make a trip to the store.  I didn't want to heat my house with the oven on, so I roasted them in a pan on the stove and added into the mixture and they were both done at the same time, just make sure to keep They are cooling on the table and I can't keep my kids out of them, hope I have some left for the salad tonight.......  My candy themometer says soft boil is 240F.

Excellent! After making the first batch, I upped the nuts and kept the sugar mixture the same. Plenty of sugar to go around.

Very good, but not superb.  I prefer the sugar 'n' spice nuts on this website, and frankly, those were much easier.  That recipe has more spices and a little orange peel which really brings out the flavor.

These had a good taste, but cooking the cinnamon with the sugar ruined my stainless steel saucepan! The cinnamon cooked to the bottom of the pan and could not be removed, so I had to throw it in the trashcan. I followed the directions to the letter, so if there is a secret to this, please let me know what it is.

These are excellent!  I normally use the sugar coated pecan recipe on this site by Carolyn and those are wonderful too.  This was a pleasant change though and I'm happy I tried them.  I'm getting ready to make my 2nd batch b/c my son is on his way over and I know he will love these too!  I was really concerned about the "soft ball" stage b/c I've never heard of that before, but I got out a cup of ice water which was a bit awkward to me, but I cooked my sugar mixture exactly 8 minutes on medium which was a 6/7 on my gas range and they turned out perfect.  No complaints at all.  Thank you Dawn for a great recipe!!!

Very good. Made for gifts. My candy thermometer broke! So I had to use the cold water trick. Came out perfectly. I also added a bit of cayenne pepper to the sugar/cinnamon mix for some kick!

These were a hit - I used pecans - walnuts and almonds. The pecans and walnuts were my favorite. I also used another recipe - Sugar Coated Pecans - it was good also but I think this one was better. My kids loved them! Thanks

OMG...these were so easy to make..and addicting.  8 minutes seemed to be right on the money for a soft ball stage but I'm going to buy a candy thermometer for the next time.  Lots less messy than trying to gracefully dribble a small amount into a cold glass of water..repeatedly..checking for the soft ball stage.  Otherwise, super easy to make and what a treat!

Thank you, Dawn.  My mother made these every Christmas and when she died so did the recipe.  Now have it and will make it for my family.  I am a good cook and have changed the way my family and friends look at food here in Costa Rica.  Without all of my friends on Allrecipes, Id be lost.

I didn't have any vanilla extract, but they still turned out great!  I can imagine the vanilla would make them taste even better.  I also am calorie-conscious so I used Splenda instead of sugar, and it worked great!  My husband has already asked for seconds.  It's the only way I can get us to eat Walnuts, and my nutritionist insists that we eat at least a handful of them a day.  This recipe makes that much easier!  I've tried many different candied walnut recipes and so far this is my favorite!  Next time, though, I will make more topping or I will bake less walnuts.  I like more yummy gooey goodness on each walnut!

These are very good! They have a nice sweet cinnamon flavor! They took a lot longer than 10 minutes to roast but everything else was perfect! I'll be serving these to my guests on Father's Day...if I can stop eating them!

I first tried this recipe at Christmastime and continue to use it throughout the year.  This is a perfect recipe for candied nuts to use in all of your summertime salads.  The candied nuts in the store are so expensive.  You can make these and freeze in batches for your salads.  I love this.

These are sooo good! I only added one tsp. of cinnamon because I wanted them for a spinach salad. Next time I will try some of the other suggestions for spices!! I'm so happy to find this recipe as the ones in the store are so crazy expensive.

I made these because I had extra walnuts after making some bread.   I topped my salad with them and it makes a regular salad, spectacular! I didn't really care about the "candy stages", sometimes it comes out a little sticky, sometimes it comes out harder like candy. It doesn't matter because it doesn't last very long! Just enough for dinner & maybe lunch the next day! LOL

I gave these as part of homemade baskets for Christmas to several of my coworkers and they did not last until the end of the day.  Everyone raved about them and loved that they were homemade.  It is a very simple recipe, and with all the other suggestions I did not have trouble with the soft ball stage, so thanks!

These are easy and delicious! I used pecans and added a little bit of red pepper. I dont have a candy thremometer so I used a bowl of cold water and only had to cook the sugar mix about 5 mins or so. These taste so much like the ones you buy at craft fairs etc..like nutty bavarian! Will definitely make again!

I've made these with walnuts, pecans, and almonds, and they've been terrific every time. I like using 1/8 t. cayenne -it's not hot, but it supplies a little spark on the back end of each bite. Thanks Dawn!

EXCELLENT recipe.  I used my candy thermometer for the first time for this and it worked well.  I followed the recipe to the letter and although the cinnamon smells strong as the syrup mixture cooks, it is very mellow on the finished product - you could probably even add extra if you really wanted the cinnamon flavor to pop.  When you add the nuts to the syrup mixture, you need to stir quickly to coat them because the syrup starts chrystallizing fairly quickly.  I served these on a salad of mixed greens, balsamic vinaigrette, dried cranberries, feta, and tomatoes and it was awesome.  Definitely a keeper - and I might experiment with adding the cayenne or other things.

YUM!  I used pecans because I had a ton of them, but otherwise followed recipe exactly.  I made these for my man and he loved them.  Delicious on their own, in a green salad, or over ice cream.  I had them over chocolate ice cream and the touch of cinnamon in the nuts was a divine complement. Highly recommended!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I served these on top of the Butternut & Apple Harvest Soup recipe on this website.  It was a good combo.  People also loved to just eat them as they are. I got multiple requests for the recipe.  A good example of an expensive product to buy already done made cheaper and did I mention it is easy to do yourself. It's also one of the few recipes that I made no changes to.

These are absolutely amazing. I used them with the walnut shrimp recipe on this website. The only thing I did differently was to pour the sauce over the walnuts in the pan I roasted them in to make it easier.

I had a little trouble but they ended up great! Like other reviewers my syrup reached the soft ball stage too soon, about 4 minutes. I ended up having to add more milk after the walnuts were added to the syrup to make the consistency right. I also added 1/8th teaspoon cayenne pepper to the mix which added a great flavor and bite with the sweet. Thanks!

YUMMY!  My family and neighbors loved these they thought I bought them from a popular nut place.  I used peanuts instead of walnuts and they turned out so good.

incredibly easy even if you don't have a candy thermometer. the cold water test works perfectly. the only substitution I made was using Saigon Cinnamon instead of regular cinnamon and I added a teaspoon of ginger to the mix as well. absolutely amazing.

Absolutely fantastic. Be sure to use a candy thermometer or watch it closely and check often for the soft ball stage; I didn't the first time (going with the 8 minute instruction) and ended up burning the mixture. I used the walnuts for a trifle I made and everyone gobbled up the trifle and the leftover nuts. Delicious!

This took 10 minutes and was great. I used an apple pie spice mix at 1 tsp to avoid overpowering the nuts. Add the milk after the sugar has started melting and stir like crazy to get it up to temp very fast.

Very good recipe as is, but I did use the recipe for another snack.   Doubled the recipe of sugar, cinnamon, milk and vanilla.  Cooked it to 238 degrees and then poured in a box (12 oz)of Quaker Oatmeal Square Cereal.  Stired it up and spread it out on a large cookie sheet.  This made an excellent snack that could be bagged in one cup portions and taken to school or work.  Next time I'll add some nuts too.

Very good!  I made the walnuts for a copy kat recipe of Dewey's Candied Walnut and Grape salad.  I used part of the recipe for some almonds.  It wasn't hard to pull together and the nuts taste great.

These walnuts are great!  Easy to make -- a candy thermometer makes it easier.  I did change the recipe a little -- 2 cups of sugar and probably doubled the milk -- used evaporated milk -- family LUUUUUVVVED these -- my son asked for the recipe.  Made a batch without the cinnamon -- just plain -- they're good too -- tripled that recipe (without the cinnamon) next time, I'll probably use just plain sugar and water to see what happens.

I've had better at a restaurant but these are the best I've made on my own. I put them in a salad with cinnamon baked apples, bleu cheese, w/cider vinagarette. Also, had them out in a bowl at Thanksgiving and they went fast.

The walnuts were a hit but I didn't agree.  They are good but not what I expected.  I will try it again but I will double the amount to better coat the walnuts and omit the cinnamon.  Way too much cinnamon!  It really over powered all the other ingredients.

This was so yummy and delicious and EASY! I have never done this before and I have two children running around while I was making them. I loved the smell as they were roasting. I didn't know the temp so I just watched it and you can see it starts to stick on the sides of the pot and I figured the sauce was ready. I didn't have wax paper so just put it on parchment paper, separated with a fork and DONE! They also came apart easily when I went to store it. I put them on the Spinach Strawberry salad from this site. Thanks for something easy for summer and the holidays. I felt so homey and cozy as I was making them.

I found this receipe to be very easy to follow.  I don't know what "softball" means in terms of cooking so I just guesstimated that it meant until it gets kinda bubbly and syrupy.  Also, I didn't have any regular milk on hand, so I used evaporated milk.  Turned out great in my opinion and I would definately do it again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe. :)

Fantastic! Very simple, very delicious recipe. The first batch turned out so wonderful that I made a second half-batch, but I got creative and used allspice and ginger instead of cinnamon, and vanilla yogurt instead of milk. Even though I messed around with the recipe so much, they still came out fantastic! We can't decide which version we like more. This recipe will most definitely be getting lots of use. Next up, almonds!

Most spiced nuts call for pecans, this is a very good recipe for walnuts. Great for snacking.

YUMMMMM! I just made these and can't wait until they are cooled. These are going to be a favorite for snacking.  I sprinkled mine with a bit of salt to get a salty sweet flavor. Great recipe.

This recipe was fabulous! Easy, too. It took only 20 minutes total from nuts in the box to finished product. I added sea salt after roasting as another member suggested for the sweet and salty tase. I will be making them again for Christmas!!

This recipe was so easy to make, and absolutely delicious!  I used pecans, and then I made candied pecan cookies out of them using the recipe on the back of nestle chocolate chips package.   SOOOOO delicious.   

mix 3/4 c. white sugar, 3/4 c. brown sugar, 1 cup butter (2 sticks), 1 tsp vanilla in a bowl. Add 2 eggs, one at a time.  Slowly include sifted 2 1/4 c. flour, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp salt.  Mix in pecans.   Bake at 375 for about 10-15 minutes.

Wow, these were trememdous and this is coming from someone who doesn't even like nuts. I made them for my daughter who adores walnuts but we all ended up loving this great treat. To get the sweet/salty thing going, once off the stove I added a bit of fresh cracked sea salt to the nuts. Thanks so much Dawn!

mmmm mmmmm mmmmm delicious! I didnt know what soft ball stage really was either but I guessed that once the mixture was thicker and bubbly it was ready to pour over the nuts. Maybe I cooked it too long but it seemed i had to stir the nuts quickly because the sugar mixture hardened fast! I think i'll try other nuts next time...these were easy and delicious! I put them in a pear salad.

This was the BEST! I cooked both Walnuts and Pecans in under 30 minutes... they are absolutely delish! I used the pecans to the recipe exactly --then did like some others and added brown sugar to the walnuts, they weren't as good but still delicious.... The Pecans are the best though, do it exactly as the recipe says... the key I think is to get the temp of the coating to soft ball form, as soon as you add the vanilla it starts to sizzle and then add the nuts and get it on the wax paper quick it starts to harden right away... they were ready to eat in about 5 minutes and everyone loves them! AAAAAA++++++++++++++++++++

I added a tablespoon more of milk in with the vanilla for a more liquid syrup. I found it made it a better consistency. I was also using lactose free milk. It was a favourite at college poker night.

Our first batch came out very well.  We doubled the cinnamon and added a little extra vanilla, and we accidentally added the vanilla to the pan with all the other ingredients and it did not seem to cause any problems.

These turned out well. A bit heavy on the cinnamon maybe. I also expected the coating to harden more. They are delicious just not really crunchy like I thought they would be. Yum.

8000 ft elevation wouldn’t allow me to reach the temperature requested, but cooked it to a boil for a total time of 10 minutes - stirring entire time.
Sugar mix instantly dried on walnuts . Making for easy separation and cooling. No tackiness! 
Used 2.5 pounds of walnut to one sugar mix.

I loved the simplicity of this recipe compared to the candied pecans recipe also on this site, because you don't have to keep stirring them in the oven for an hour.  This is done in 20 minutes tops and they turn out beautiful and not sticky.

Easy and delicious! I made followed the directions as written. It took a very short time to reach soft ball stage (the pan I used was a lightweight pan and that could be why). Cant wait to have them in the apple walnut salad we have planned.

DANGEROUSLY DELICIOUS!  There is a very good reason, this recipe has such great reviews:  It's absolutely delicious!

I went exactly by the recipe!  Not having any idea, nor ever hearing of "softball soft," I just simmered this for 10 minutes, stirring pretty consistently.  After that time, I just poured my toasted walnuts in and mixed to coat well.  

I love that roasted taste, so I went a few minutes longer, when roasting my walnuts on 350.  I roasted mine for 12 minutes and did not touch them at all, while they were being
done.  I did not stir them, shake the pan or anything. I just left them alone until 12 minutes was up.

I couldn't help myself and ended up eating about 6 of these.  I could have easily eaten all of them, to be honest.  

Five stars, and I'd give it ten, if I could.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thanks Dawn, for sharing this yummy, addicting treat!  

I'll use these in the Strawberry Spinach Salad I, from this website.  The Strawberry Spinach Salad I, has a wonderful sesame seed and poppy seed dressing and these candied walnuts will go so well with that.

Always wanted to try candies nuts. This recipe was SO EASY. I bought a huge bag of walnuts on sale at Costco...it was the perfect opportunity to try. It will be a "go to" recipe for office gifts...Christmas goodies... or just a yummy snack food. Thank you very much.

I'm not a huge fan of walnuts, but happened upon a few pounds that I didn't know what to do with. Followed this recipe exactly, and oh my goodness, these are amazing. My granddaughter (who's 3) and I can't seem to stop eating them.

This was easy and delicious. I used fat free milk, needed to change to a larger pan so that was my only hiccup. It is more like pralines, which I love.

These are amazing.  I went by temperature (236*)not time. Only took about 5mins.  Everyone’s stoves are different so timing is hard to go on. I double recipe because it is hard to get correct temperature on such small amount of syrup. Trust me you won’t regret doubling it.

These candied walnuts are EXTREMELY DELICIOUS. I loved making them. I had a bag a walnuts and I was thinking what to do with them and I found this recipe. Make sure that when you roast the walnuts that you watch it occasionally. Our walnuts only took 5 min to roast or maybe we just had a hot oven. Anyway these were delicious and make a great snack and Christmas gift.

Easy, mostly foolproof. ALWAYS be safety conscious when working with hot sugar! Make sure you use a big enough saucepan to allow quick stirring when you add the nuts.

Easy to make. Delicious to eat. I used almonds instead of walnuts, and almond milk. I added 1 tsp chili powder, sprinkled sea salt over them as they were cooling. Definitely a keeper!

I love this recipe! But right after we went to the store we realized we only had like 1/2 cup of white sugar, lol, so we put 1/2 cup of brown sugar in it and it tastes great!!!! And it took like about 15 minutes to roast our walnuts, but it still worked!!!! And my whole family loved them, and I'm going to give some to my friends at school and my other family members :D

I would NOT recommend this recipe.

I have made candied walnuts many times -- always with success.  Since I don't have a recipe on file,  I used this recipe today.  I was a little suspicious since there is no oil / fat in the recipe, but I went ahead with it anyway.  The results were so bad that I threw out the entire recipe (one full pound of nuts) when I was done.

Have made candied nuts before, but this recipe didn't work for me. Used my candy thermometer to measure temperature, but when I mixed in the nuts the mixture became so dry it was hard to stir them and only about half the powdery sugar stuck to the nuts. Overcooked the sugar mixture I guess. They are still edible, but the coated ones are sickeningly sweet.

The nuts were dried out and the sugar never coated evenly on the nuts. I'll  Save  them to top on salads or cereals.  Not good to deliver  as a small gift or serve to guest in a festive plate.  Wouldn't make again.

As soon as I took the mixture off the stove and added the vanilla, it solidified forming a hard mess at the bottom of my pan. I heated it back up to melt it (adding a little more milk) and stirred the nuts in while on the stove. They turned out good. They tasted good, and were easy to make.

As a kid an Aunt would make these and I always looked forward to them.  On a whim I found this recipe and made a batch, omg I'm 5 again.  This is the magical treat from my childhood.  I just made a second batch today using organic sugar instead of white, the nuts came out fine and just as good as first batch that disappeared quickly last night at Thanksgiving.  Thank you for putting this recipe up.

These were very good, but I would use less cinnamon next time. And I love cinnamon, but there was a bit much in this recipe. Otherwise it would be a 5.

Very easy and quick to make. It is helpful to have a candy thermometer to monitor the temperature. Once you remove the sugar from the heat, you only have about 60-120 seconds to get the nuts coated before it hardens.

This was a big hit with my family! I tend to read the reviews for tips and when I did on this one, I realized I know nothing about the "soft ball stage". So I did what one user recommended. I cooked all the ingredients in a pot until melted and well mixed and then when the walnuts were done roasting, I threw them in the pot as well and kept stirring for about 5-10 more minutes. I am a big fan of these over vanilla ice cream!

I chose this recipe because of the high ratings. I'm glad I did. The extra  time and effort will be rewarded with amazing candied walnuts. My friend who is an excellent cook and has her own candied walnuts recipe said, "Wow, these taste better than mine". I'm officially trading in her recipe for Dawn's.......I would definitely recommend using a cold glass of water to check for the "soft ball stage" instead of timing it for 8 minutes. It is only at this stage is the sugar syrup ready to mix with the walnuts.

The timing and temperature are critical. I have made these for years and love them.  As real cooks warned me, working on a different stove proved a little difficult as the "sauce" did dry out.  I do like to add just a little more milk than the recipe says. I have not perfected my soft-ball stage yet so I bought a candy thermometer. I take them to clients and vendors during the holidays and always hear "Your nuts are delicious!"

Made this recipe but had to modify since I didn't buy the designated amount of walnuts. But they came out great.  Made them to put on salad but they were just being eaten without the salad.  I'm making them again as a snack before the Christmas dinner.

I make these every year at Christmas!  I prefer pecans to walnuts but either works well of course. There is no way to improve upon this recipe. It's perfection. My only tip would be--don't make more than a double batch at one time.

These walnuts are wonderful.  I made them to serve with a strawberry  kiwi spinach salad with raspberry dressing (on this site).  They were perfect!  Only problem was DH kept eating them, and I worried there wouldn't be any left for the salad.  Finally put some in a separate dish for him and told him the rest were off limits!!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.  Going to make some as gifts for Christmas.

These are ridiculously good! I made them vegan by substituting cashew milk for dairy milk and raw organic sugar for the white sugar, I don't think anyone could ever tell the difference. These will certainly become a staple as they can be used for so many different recipes.

Great recipe and so easy.  For a little bit of zing, change cinnamon to 1 tbsp and add 1/4 tsp ginger and 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (compliments of a chef who shared that with me).  Wonderful topping for salads.

Loved this!  Quick and easy, and only a measuring cup and spoon to wash (since I lined the baking sheet with parchment).  Why roast the nuts separately when they can micro-cook with the syrup? I will experiment with different spices and brown sugar, but this is perfect for the salad I'm planning to make.

They tasted great, but I'm no candy maker. The "glaze" didn't coat the walnuts. I used a candy thermometer, and it said it was at the soft ball stage.

Absolutely fantastic!  I used fresh chandler walnut halves, and they simply couldn't be better.  I wanted them to be vegan, so I used almond milk and I also used the Florida crystals pure cane sugar.

Great with walnuts and pecans.  I would use a different recipe for almonds.  Also, it is important to be ready to stir the nuts with the mixture right away, or a lot of nuts are left uncoated.

I made this recipe using pecans.  Does anyone know how long they will last and if I can prolong their shelf-life by storing them in the refrigerator?  Thanks!

Very easy and quick as promised.  I used 2 tsps of applie pie spice instead of cinnamon and it is very tasty!  Thanks.

Oops, sorry. I did make one change to the recipe I forgot to mention in my first review. I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup light brown sugar in place of 1 cup of white sugar. Other than that kept it the same. So good!

These were much easier than I thought they would be.... I used coconut sugar and made a super tiny batch with a handful of walnuts, and I didn't do the soft ball test or use my thermometer. They came out delicious..... Added a little extra cinnamon.... Going to put them in mushrooms with goat cheese and wrap them in bacon if I can manage not to eat them all first.....

I've Been making these for years, It's one of those treats that people look forward to eating around Christmas time.  I make Large Batches, and give them as gifts.  Other members of my family have tried to make nuts, but they just never come out as good as this recipe.  Love Love Love!!!
Thank you!

I tried this recipe twice and it didn't turn out either time.  The first time it stuck to the bottom of the pan and burned.  The second time it crystallized as soon as it hit the walnuts and didn't coat them very well.  Tasted good, but I won't make it again.

These are great!  I made them on a whim for Easter, and they went really fast!  I also added them to Strawberry Spinach salad, which made the salad even better.

YUM. I used pecans instead of walnuts, no big deal I did use half truvia (6 packets) and half white sugar. I also used soy milk instead of cow's. Yay for lower calories! I love this and will for sure make it again.

Delicious! I have made them 3 times and the first 2 times..the cooking time was off..so invest in a candy thermometer...since I cooked to little one time..and it turned out sticky..and the other time I cooked too long and it turned out hard as a rock and couldn't remove from the pan very easily..otherwise great.

These are WONDERFUL!  I made them yesterday and we snacked on them all day long.  They remind me of the strusel topping on top of coffee cake.  Super easy to make, but made quite an impression on guests.  These are like something that you would buy at the Nut Hut at the mall.  YUMMY!

Oh Dear, I'm hooked!!! Many thanks for posting this one!!! Great fun to make these - and they are so yummy, that I will have to give most of them away otherwise my scales will die on me!  
I followed these easy steps... but couldn't resist to add just a pinch of ground pepper, clove and nutmeg to it ... mhhhhh the kitchen smells DEVINE !!!

I used evaporated cane juice instead of granulated sugar for this recipe, and it turned out great.  I cooked the candy a little too long, but it still coated the nuts, and they separated fine.  Instead of cinnamon, I used a pinch of cayenne and a grind of black pepper.  In a salad with cranberries, gorgonzola and tuscan dressing, they are scrumptious! Rock on, candy makers!

These were good. I think I'll look for a recipe that uses butter I think the buttery flavor would be good. I did not use the cinnamon. Mine took about 15min or more to reach 236degrees.

Tasty recipe! Unfortunately I couldn't find my candy thermometer so I just estimated.. 8 minutes at the middle setting for my stove. The mixture was fine but the bottom of the pan was a little burnt (which results in a huge pain to wash and a yucky smell). Next time I'll have to dig up my candy thermometer to be safe.

This was a really easy recipe and soooo tasty!! The kids are eating bowls right now, even my 6 year old who is very picky. You do need a candy themometer.
Fast and easy to look like a pro!

These are awesome!  I make them to go with salad greens, pear and gorgonzola and balsamic dressing.  Delicious!  Sometimes I will 'double dip' the walnuts to give an extra coating.  Delicious!

I made these walnuts three times since printing the recipe before Christmas.  My sons and I love to snack on them plus they are great in salads.  I also made Christmas cookie plates for friends and threw a few of these around the platter to make it pretty.

A little confused with the softball stage. I guess I don't know what that means. I ended up cooking on med. for about 15 min. and my walnuts just have a sweet powder on them. They still taste good but I will try cooking for less next time around.

This is the BEST recipe I have been able to find, and I have been looking since Christmas. They are just as good as the "German Roasted Nuts" in the mall. They dissappeared as soon as I finished making them. Thanks Dawn!

I make these with pecans and my family goes wild over them.  Even my two year old who won't eat a thing loves these "toucans".  That's our name for candied pecans now-toucans!
Thanks for a perrfect recipe.

These were sooooooo good that I had to have my husband get them out of the house before I ate them all!  I was a little concerned about the "soft ball" stage since I didn't have a candy thermometer however after about 8 minutes it reached the stage perfectly.  Note however that I attempted to double the recipe the 2nd time around to save some time and it didn't work out as well.  I would definitely make these again (and again and again and again).

This recipe is awesome. I tried it with almonds and they tasted just like the ones you buy in the paper cone from the kiosks!
HINT, don't forget the vanilla or it will be sticky and not crunchy. I had a happy accident, and added it after I mixed in the nuts, much better outcome.

These are pretty good but mine were quite sticky when finished.  I let them sit out for hours on the waxed paper but were still sticky in the end.  Maybe I didn't boil long enough, I don't have a thermometer but I did boil them for about 12 minutes, which is 4 min. over the recommended time.  I may try these again when I get a candy thermometer.  Also, a dusting of sugar over the final product makes a nice treat and pretty presentation.

Great appetizer/snack. Very easy to make.  Everyone, even the kids enjoyed them.
