These veggie burgers turned out great.  I followed the footnote and used only 2 teaspoons of chili powder.  They weren't too spicy.  I might kick it up to 3 teaspoons next time.  The use of the flour helped give the burgers browned look and helped keep them together.  I'll be making these again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Spicy Black Bean & Corn Burger Haiku: "Spicy, spicy yum! Oops, I forgot the flour. But liked these a bunch!" I used all the ingredients as written, but usually when I make bean (black or garbanzo) I form them into patties, then freeze them, as they go right from freezer to hot skillet and hold together cooking beautifully. That being said, I must've missed the coating them in flour part, but still ended up really liking the flavor of these alot.

These turned out great and I liked that they didn't require egg (not a fan). I nixed the jalape√±o and added spicy chili-garlic sauce (1tsp) and I used half the amount of flour (and I still had plenty left over. I also recommend making more or thinner patties, as this mixture for 4 makes huge patties. But overall, they were a huge hit with my husband (a devoted meat eater!) and also I didn't have cilantro, but I'm sure it would have been great with it!

My husband thinks this is much improved with 1/4 cup parmesan. I like these best as a slider, rather than a giant bean burger.

I thought this turned out great. I read the reviews about it being dry so I skipped the flour, formed them into burgers and put them right in the freezer. Then I baked them frozen at 350 for about 20-25 minutes. Served w/a slice of swiss cheese and some mustard, yum!  It wasn't dry at all!  Next time I'll double the beans and skip the corn but it's just a personal taste.

AMAZING, even better than I thought. I added a bit more salt then was recommended and a couples squeezes of fresh lemon juice. I also didn't add the jalepeno because I didn't have any but these came out so delicious. I melted a small square of cheddar cheese on top and the end and topped them off with plain greek yogurt (a nod to sour cream) they were fantastic. Would definitely recommend.

Really good, really big! I was Thanksgiving full after eating these. I felt they were a little dry so next time I'm going to use a little less bread crumbs and try it without the flour. I think I may add more onion too. Thanks for a great recipe

Slightly disappointed that it didn't turn out firm. I think I'm going to try mixing in a little brown rice next time; either that or perhaps an egg might work to hold it together. I am also going to add a bit more spices. I also used canned corn and it worked fine. The flavor was good and I liked it.  Make sure you have enough time for prep -- takes a while for all that chopping and bean smashing!

One of the best veggie burger combos I've had - this has replaced all our other recipes for veggie burgers (including the top rated one on this site right now).

The chili powder seems like a lot, but we love the amount - it's not spicy at all for those who are used to red pepper and hot sauce.

May try extra bread crumbs or even adding an egg next time to hold them together better. This isn't a problem with this specific recipe, but all veggie burgers I've made. It'll hold decently - but I'm always looking for a little more!

I did like the flavor however I feel like it needs more beans next time... it seems like it wasnt proportional and I had a hard time keeping them together and I added less breadcrumbs but the texture was still off... over all I plan to make these again but with some small tweaks.

This recipe was delicious! I added a few of my own things like homemade fat-free tangy mayo and of course a huge pile of caramelized onions! :) It was also great the next day as lunch, and I will surely make this again.

I tried this recipe Saturday but added ground turkey and just threw all raw ingredients in with turkey and added an egg.  No flour.  It was wonderful!!!  We only ate about half so the next day we made tacos with it.  Healthy and delicious!!

Very good flavor! If you make your beans in an instant pot instead of using canned beans the patties stay together so much better! BEST EVER!!

Overall this was a great recipe! The flavors were perfect! I did notice that the final the mixture was more crumbly than I would have liked so I added in an egg to help hold it together and form the patties. Other than this I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone.

Great flavor! I like them spicier so I added red pepper flakes. I had a hard time keeping them together so next time I'll reduce the breadcrumbs by half or add an egg. Overall, a great recipe.

LOVE! This is the second black bean burger recipe I have tried and wow! Best of all it didn't involve eggs! The coating of flour was a nice touch. I reused the skillet I cooked the veggies in (without washing) for the burgers and everything came out perfect! I covered both the veggies and the burgers while cooking. The beans weren't dry, and it didn't taste like flour. They held together very well and were also filling. I followed the instructions as it was laid out, I didn't have some ingredients so I substituted panko breadcrumbs for plain bread crumbs, oregano and cilantro for dried parsley and basil, and frozen corn for fresh. I threw all the chopped up veggies into a skillet to cook; then mashed the beans; then layered beans, spices, veggies in a bowel and mixed everything; then gradually mixed in the panko.

The burgers were great, and not too spicy by any means.  They stayed together perfectly during cooking. But, honestly, I thought the flavour could have been better.

These were delicious! For anybody who likes good flavor and the perfect amount of spice; no need to be vegetarian. 

I added a little bit of rice vinegar to help hold them together. Without anything as such, they can easily fall apart. 

I skipped out on oregano because I did not have any, but they tasted great without it.

Once they were done, I toased Brioche buns in the oven; perfect bun for these. 

Also, I topped with fresh slices of avocado.

Made burgers exactly as written. They were great! Perfect spice combination. As others have mentioned, I would recommend making thinner patties. Satisfied both the meat eaters and vegans in the family.

OMG! This was the most delicious veggie burger that I have ever made! Perfect recipe, came out so good! The color looks "meaty", the texture is nice! Love love love it! I also skipped the flour, just fried as is. I basically chopped everything in the food processor, which made the recipe so quick! I also blended the beans in the food processor too, instead of mashing it, but just a bit, not till a hummus consistency haha. As usually, I added Bragg's aminos, nutritional yeast, tomato paste, also a squeeze of a lemon. Then, the whole mixture went into the freezer for 30 mins to cool off, and then I made about 10 good size patties to fry! Sooo good! Thank u! Will be making them all the time!

The mixture was ver crumbly and wouldn't form into patties, even small ones. Better after leaving to set in fridge before frying. Flavour was nice. Only used half a large jalape√±o and three teaspoons chili powder. Maybe I use too much corn....I used canned corn so wasn't sure how much would equal one cob's worth.

Ridiculously good!! I left out the hot stuff and added eggs so they stay together. Combine with a pickle and it'll make you cry from joy.

These are great!  I added another can of spicy black beans,  (mashed beans from one can,  left other can of beans whole),  parsley  and topped with caramelized onions,  cheese and lettuce.  Baked in oven instead of grilling and they turned out great! Will be making again for sure!

These were delicious, about on the edge of my spiciness tolerance with the two teaspoons chili powder, but still good - I might cut down to one or one and a half.  The best value I could find on black beans was a 15.5oz. can and I think that was a good amount - they didn't hold together super well for me, though I refrigerated a couple for a few days and that seemed to help.  I also used relatively little flour - more as-needed than measured out.  I didn't have cilantro, but will get some next time I make these, as I will be making these again and recommend them.  Maybe a more experienced cook will be able to sort out some of the issues I had.

I absolutely love these! I make them as often as possible! I don't always add the jalapeno, gives me heartburn occasionally. I also don't add the peppers and cilantro. Sometimes I'll add some cayenne pepper, I like the heat even if it does give me heartburn sometimes. Great recipe though! Highly recommend!

This was great. We enjoyed the spicy flavors. I used 2 tsp of chili powder and that was fine for us.  I also added some chopped spinach and shredded, chopped zucchini. Instead of bread crumbs, I used saltine crackers. I made a mixture of ketchup and mustard to put on top to give it a meat loaf taste and topped with delicious caramelized onions.

I absolutely love these!   They have great flavor and aren't too difficult to make.   Definitely a favorite,  I suggest doubling the recipe.  You'll want leftovers.

This recipe is excellent. I made a few additions. I added oats, chipotle peppers in adobo, smoked paprika and left out the corn. I‚Äôve added eggs and Sometimes I‚Äôll use a flax egg or just make them vegan. I‚Äôve discovered the no fail method to keeping them from falling apart is to bake your beans for 20 minutes prior to mashing. The less liquid the better they stay together. I try to make 3 batches at a time because we like to keep them in the freezer for later.

This is one of my very favorite recipes. I always make mine into several very small patties and they cook much better this way. As a cilantro lover, I also like to add in more cilantro. Tastes great with homemade guacamole!

These are delicious! 4 stars instead of 5, because I felt as written, were a little dry. Because the seemed dry I added a second can of black beans drained but not rinsed, used 3 tsp of chili powder, 1 tsp of cumin and about 3/4 tsp salt. Oh and because I didn't feel it was necessary I skipped the flour. I did use frozen corn and next time I'll add a little more of that as well.

Great recipe. Love that it doesn't require any egg and the ingredients bind themselves beautifully! I always mash the beans with my hands and then combine in the breadcrumb mixture with my hands as well. Makes them firm up much nicer. I also mix all of the spices together with the breadcrumbs for better distribution. Finely ground breadcrumbs are a must! Once I form the patty, which I usually divide into 6 or 8 patties instead of 4, I like to pat a little flour on the bottoms and fry them up in a little bit of vegetable oil (not too much!) They come out SO delicious, every time.

Really good taste!!  I altered it a bit. I don‚Äôt like   Jalape√±os  So I left them out and cut the chili powder in half. I am on the Daniel Fast so I cut the flour ( could have used almond flour) and bread crumbs. I added 1 tablespoon of Chia seeds. I let them soak in water and use them like you would an egg.  I also put them in the freezer since they seemed really soft to move. I fried them in a skillet with grape seed oil but they all burnt.  I have never use grapeseed oil before and I‚Äôm guessing it does not have a high enough threshold when it becomes hot. And if you have that problem?    Other than not checking the oil to make sure it was a good oil to use I had no problems with this burger and taste delicious.

I made a couple of subs by using green chilies instead of jalapenos, hot & spicy breadcrumbs in place of plain, and upped the amount of cumin.  My husband had never had a black bean burger and liked them. I think next time I would up the seasonings even more because I would have like a little more spice and flavor overall. I made smaller patties  and served them with pepper jack cheese and blue cheese dressing on Hawaiian slider buns.

Next time I would add an egg to help it hold together. I would also either reduce the corn by half or add another can of beans to make it more proportional. I reduced the chili powder by half and added chipotle (in adobo sauce) instead.
