This recipe produced an extremely creamy praline with subtle flavor.  The problem for me (and apparently for the previous reviewer)is the amount of liquid--I cut it down by about 3 tablespoons or so.  I would recommend letting the mixture rest for about 1 minute after the second zap in the microwave.  Then, you have to beat it like crazy until it starts to go opaque--spoon out some and see if it looks like the pecans are starting to stick together.  THEN you are ready to drop them--work fast because once it starts to set up, your time is running out.  This recipe is certainly worth a try--the texture is heavenly.  If the pralines don't come out, you have some lovely ice cream topping.

This was a terrible recipe.  I tried twice, was extremely careful with the measurments and still ended up with sticky pecan soup.

This really turned out well. You really do need a 1000 watt microwave though. I plan on making these again soon!

Be very very careful with this recipe.  I have a 1000 watt microwave, and I still burned the mixture well before the cook time was up.  It smoked so badly my house smelled for 2 days.

I too had a lot of trouble with this recipe.  I would strongly urge not trying it.  The praline sauce was near the consistancy of water, even after sitting.  What a shame with the price of pecans these days.

Decent for quick microwave pralines. If you use less of each liquid and put them on the pan as soon as the mix thickens; then they should be fine.

I just made these and like most of the other reviewers, mine turned out a very thin concoction. I threw in another half cup of brown sugar and a 1/4 teaspoon of cream of tartar and put back in for another 4 minutes. When it came out, it was still very thin and there was no way I could spoon it out onto a sheet. I stirred it every few minutes until it started to thicken and then spooned them out. It took awhile, but they did eventually set up. I would try them again, but will start with more brown sugar and the cream of tartar.

I had the same problem as APERRY4802. Well, it didn't smoke but as written mine turned out basically burnt as my picture shows. I was determined to make it work and went for round two with changes in what I thought would be better. My version turned out underdone but the pecans were already in so there wasn't much I could do at that point. I wasn't about to go buy more pecans and give it another go so  I hate to do it but this recipe does not work as written. It might have potential with some tweaks but as written I cannot recommend this. Sorry.
