This was a good "basic" recipe, but needed some extra flavor.  I wasn't sure how to extract juice from an onion, so just used onion powder.  I added salt and pepper to taste, but it was still bland.  Finally, I added 1 1/2 teaspoons of Old Bay seasoning and that did the trick. I would suggest adding your favorite seasoning such as Italian blend, garlic blend or perhaps Cajun.

Used Mayo rather than creamy salad dressing.  Added a small tsp of capers and omitted the onion.   Served with a variety of crackers.

I made it exactly as written and used ranch as the dressing.  My daughter was looking for something similar to what a friend had mad at a party. Make this ahead because the flavor need to blend. We really likes it and have made it twice so far.
