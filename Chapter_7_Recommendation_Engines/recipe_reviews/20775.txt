It is very refreshing, just make it sweet, or you can use CACHACA istead of the vodka, I'm from Sao Paulo,Brazil, this drink is getting very popular here as well, it is not hard to find CACHACA, some popular brands PITU, 51 Velho Barreiro are very good.
Bom apetite.

This is good.  You have GOT to like lime.  I happen to love lime so this drink is good.  However the balance seems off a bit.. it's worth experimenting with to make it just right to your taste.  Give it a shot.

This was pretty good. It was a little too sour for me, next time I will double the amount of sugar.

This is good but I would use half the lime next time.
