This was so good!  I never would have guessed that it had zucchini in it.  It tasted just like a coconut custard pie.  If you buy frozen pie shells, make sure they are the deep dish kind- the regular ones are too small for this recipe.

I have made this wonderful pie several times and the family loves it.  It is frequently requested for family meals in the fall when zucchini is plentiful.  One time I prepared it with sweetened condense milk in place of the milk and sugar and it was very good that way also.  A great recipe that we will keep in our files for years to come.

HMMMMMM this was good, I have an 8 year old who detests zucchini and loves sweets and didn't detect it but ate it all.  I thought it was a little sweet and will next time only put in 2/3 s of a cup of sugar I also tipped all the coconut in the custard and just added a little extra for the top.  I served this with cream, YUM.

Loved this recipe! I substituted sucralose for the sugar and used low fat evaporated milk instead of regular milk. The results were amazing.

I used this recipe to get rid of some excess zucchini, and I really didn't like it. The flavor was all right, but the texture was not. Perhaps I didn't leave it in my blender long enough to completely liquify it, but I'm not willing to risk it for a second try.

I was out of vanilla extract so I used almond instead.  I made this with a homemade pie crust.  It was sooo yummy. My husband didn't believe me that it had Zucchini in it.

I would give this recipe a 10 if I could.  As we are being over run with Zucchini, I am making various recipes.  This pie is very simple to make and has a wonderful flavor.  It will definitely be on my list for next summer.

This was the most amazing custard pie. I did put a little less sugar then what the recipe called for but, other than that it was perfect. Everyone loved it! We loved it so much I've made it four times this summer!

It was very good, although I like a denser custard. Adding the zucchini kinda watered it down a bit for me, although you could not even taste it.Pie had a nice flavor. Just not what I was looking for.

I was a bit skeptical once I mixed the ingredients and prepared to pour the mixture into the pie shell.  But this pie was AMAZING!!!  Absolutely delicious, and nope.....not even my picky teenager could tell the pie had zucchini in it!  I'll definitely make this again!!

Tasted gross.  Perhaps due to baker's error, but I dont' know.  Consistency was off as well.

I must confess I'm not a fan of the texture of coconut. That aside, this pie was quite a surprise! It was light and refreshing - perfect for summer - and you'd never know there was zucchini in it. I can't hold my personal feelings on coconut against this dessert, so I'm giving it 5 stars!

It was easy enough to make and I thought it had a good taste, but my family didn't care
for it at all, I probably won't be making this again.

My family loved this pie, even though I forgot to peel the zucchini!  The unpeeled zucchini added color, but didn't affect the taste.  Delicious!

I’ve made this a bunch of times and it’s always great! Here are my tips: 
1) after shredding the zucchini put it in a microwave safe bowl and cook on high for 5-7 minutes 
3)once it’s cooled enough to handle, put the zucchini in a clean lint free cloth and squeeze as much liquid from it as you can. 
 Voilá! A tasty custard pie with a veggie twist!

The best custard recipe I've found.  I had to make some changes due to dietary restrictions and substituted the milk for light coconut milk and used unsweetened coconut since the coconut milk already had sweetness to it. I also used phyllo pastry simply because I had it in the fridge. The texture was perfect (I processed it for almost a minute) and the nutmeg added a nice finish.

It was very tasty. Perhaps a little too sweet tho'. I made it with almond milk instead of cows milk and no crust so as to be Gluten Free.  I also added a teaspoon of chia seeds to compensate , trying to thicken it up a little. I didnt  think the zuccini would be enough to hold it together.  You don't taste the zuccini. Regardless it was still rather flat/thin.  Next time I'll try adding another egg, or perhaps use a little clear gelatin.  My goal is to make Gluten Free/dairy Free desserts.

This pie has a wonderful flavor with a nice and creamy custard texture.  Easy to make and a delicious use of zucchini.  I will be making this recipe for years to come.  Thanks for the recipe.

Wow!  This is REALLY good!  I adore coconut, and this really hit the spot!  I followed the recipe exactly, however I did read a review that stated the pie was runny, so I blotted the zucchini well with paper towels to get the excess moisture out.  I made the pie and even I am amazed there is zucchini in it!  Very delicious!  Thanks for the recipe PARADI...I will be making this one again for sure :)
