A very tasty slaw! But you must like curry flavor or you will be disappointed.  I made 1/2 a recipe and I cut the cayenne to 1/4 tsp. Also added just a bit of carrot and green pepper.  The peanuts add a great deal to this slaw and I think a few more would make it even better.

Great recipe! We used a bag of coleslaw mix instead of the cabbage, green onions, and peas. Turned out quite good.

Very good, quick & easy. I just used a bag of coleslaw mix (red & green cabbage + carrots) as well as the frozen peas, green onions & peanuts. My husband even had seconds (and he is not a coleslaw fan!) If you like asian flavors of curry & ginger I think you will enjoy this.

I recently made this for a pot luck dinner and it was a hit.  This was a great recipe!  However, I did make some changes.  Instead of using peanuts, I used curry cashews, crushed then, I added some chopped apples (leave the skin on for color and extra fiber).  It was a hit!  I highly recommend this recipe.  Yes, don't try it if you are not a fan of curry.

If you like curry flavor you will really like this recipe.  I used yogurt instead of sour cream to lessen the calories a bit, and used a mix of both dry and honey roasted peanuts for a little spicy/sweet combination.  I also recommend drastically reducing the amount of cayenne unless you like things REALLY spicy.  I highly recommend this as a side dish to jerk chicken.

Used this basic recipe but changed and added a few things. Nonfat plain yogurt instesd of sour cream, pine nuts instead of peanuts and added red grapes & broccoli. Also used hot curry along with the other spices. Turned out great!

The taste of the dressing is great!  I had to omit the green onions and the peas tonight, so subbed with carrots.  The coleslaw went from good to great with the addition of the peanuts!

Very tasty, but next time I will use the prepackaged coleslaw mix.  The whole head of cabbage was a bit more thick.  I heated the rest up the next day and added some chicken to it.  Mixed it all together and served it on a bed of Jasmine rice. Adding coconut milk to the mix would probably improve the heated version too.

I did not really like it.  It was a little flat and too much curry.  I added a lttle sugar and it helped some. I do not think I would make it again.

I expected to like this much more than I actually did. I kept thinking the dressing would be better suited to a potato salad? Think I might try that, and will omit the peanuts. Thanks anyway!

I am in a CSA and needed to find a way to use up the season's red cabbage, kohlrabi, asian cabbage and celery.  I used greek yogurt instead of sour cream and toasted pine nuts as I did not have peanuts in the house.  I would drastically reduce the cayenne, I used 3/4 tsp and it was way too hot for my family.
