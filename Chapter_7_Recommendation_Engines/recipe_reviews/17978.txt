The adults in our group LOVED the pie.  It does remind you of cheesecake, only lighter.  Half of the kids liked it and half thought it was too tangy.  We decided it was a "keeper!"

This pie is very good with an undescribable taste. It was very easy and I will make it again.

This is a great quick summer pie. I used low fat sour cream and lite cherry pie filling, it tasted great.  The whole family loved it.

This pie I love. I used to get at Marie Calender's all the time and miss it a lot. Now I can make it myself

For a person who does not eat a lot of sweet things the pie was just a touch to sweet for me in the filling. The graham cracker crust stayed together well and held up well under pressure.  The sour cream added a nice cheese cake texture for the pie that was a delight to eat. I would make this recipe again. It is a very enjoyable dessert.

Quick and easy, I love this recipe. It reminds me of a light cheesecake that doesn't give you that heavy sensation of eating a brick of cream cheese.

Great flavor.  The only suggestion is to use a springform  cheesecake pan.  I used the  9" pie pan and had no room to put the blueberry topping.

Very good. Light and not too sweet. Would make a nice summer dessert. I used canned cherry pie filling but, you could use any other kind. I made a crust out of townhouse crackers, doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9 by 13 pan.

Very nice!  And it does remind me of a light cheesecake.  As usual I used much less sugar (can't do very sweet). . . Almond extract instead of vanilla and a topping of fresh peaches gently cooked with cornstarch, spiced tea and a bit of brown sugar. Simple, refreshing and fun.  Four stars.

Probably the BEST pie I ever ate!  I loved it!  I used all fresh cherries on top in a circular pattern.  Can't describe the taste, other than it was delicious and SURPRISING!
