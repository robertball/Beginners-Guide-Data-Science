Very delicious!  I used ground beef instead of the other meats and cut the recipe in half.

I made these last night and they turned out fantastic with my changes.  I reduced the amount of ground turkey to one package of ground turkey (1.25#) and omitted the veal totally.  I then added a cup of finely chopped each carrots and celery.  The kids ate them up without knowing the added veggies.

I cut the recipe in half since it is just the 2 of us and I still got 12 meatloaf muffins. We found there was just too much seasonings in each individual serving so I think doing it as a large meatloaf would work better. The gravy does help with the taste.

Not very tasty - way too much seasoning. Won't be making this again.

I used 2 lbs ground turkey and 1 lb ground beef.  I served them over fresh-made mashed potatoes, and added a side of peas. My men LOVED this meal!!

I changed the recipe..a little to help with the glazing... I used a bunt cake pan ...turned out great...and gave a nice place to put mash potatoes.. and added a little fun to the table...
