Didn't have an iron skillet so I just baked it in a glass casserole dish.  Came out just as good.

Didn't have celery when i made this the second time.  So i substituted Sweet red pepper ( 1/2 c).  I missed the celery and thought it needed a bit more salt.  The Red gives it a nice color.  I would make it again with both the celery and peper.

Great recipe.  I favor anything cooked in a cast iron skillet for the extra iron.  I thought, after my first taste, a little salt was needed; however, that lasting impression was that this cornbread was the perfect balance of savory and sweet.  This was my four year old's first taste of cornbread and, aside from picking out the "green" celery, he liked it.

I love this recipe! Turns out great every time. I usually find I have to add at least a quarter cup more liquid, though. This is also great when made in muffin pans (12 muffins/tea biscuits per recipe), of course you'll need to reduce the cooking time.

I have made this cornbread time and again and it's always fantastic! I don't like celery much, so I always either double the onion amount (1 cup) or just leave it out. I love onions, so doubling the onion amount makes it very flavorful. On occassion I haven't had onion around the house but still wanted to make this and it still tastes great! Just be sure to add 3 tbs of melted butter to make up for it. :) I also add a bit more spice using a tsp of oregano, and some italian seasoning. The recipe is always plenty sweet for me because I use three heaping tbs of sugar. If you like sweet cornbread, heap your tbs and you'll be just fine. This recipe is fantastic, fun to play around with, keeps great, and always always tasty!

I used an 11 ounce can of Mexi corn.  Next time I will bake in a 8 x 12 pan as it was about twice as thick as I like. This is a real keeper, easy to make and the best ever with chili beans.  YUMMY!!

Very good recipe, cast iron pan seems to give extra flavour. Cut up onions and celery very small.

My daughter's nutritionist and I have been looking for vegetable breads since she loves bread and skips veggies.  We both loved this recipe.  Great for an after school snack.  Problem is - hubby ate it all.

This was soo good. I don't like a lot of onion taste in my food, so I halved the onions and celery and it came out perfect. I've been craving some good corn bread for a while, and this recipe was just right.

This was very dry.  The only changes I made were to omit celery and cook in a stone pan.  The flavor was good and I loved the corn, but I would have liked a moist bread better.

Best homemade cornbread ever! My husband doesn't like celery so I put in onions and green onions instead. I only used 6 oz of corn. It was SO GOOD. Not too dry, not too heavy. It was perfect. I will be making this on a regular basis!

The best corn bread I've ever made.  Onion gave it a nice kick.  I used light margerine and egg substitute and it turned out wonderfully.

This was my first attempt at cornbread.  I didn't have everything on hand so I didn't follow the recipe totally, but used it as a basis.

I omitted celery and sage, substituted butter shortening for margarine and frozen corn for canned.  I did up the salt to a full teaspoon, having read the reviews here (with the amount of sugar it makes more of a balance I think).

Bread turned out moist and fluffy inside with a delicate crust.  I used a 10 1/4 inch skillet without any problems (still took 25 mins).  I really enjoyed it and hubby seemed to too.

My husband loved the authetic taste of this corn bread.  I used frozen corn instead of canned corn because it comes closer to fresh corn.  For a nice flavor kick, add 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese and 1 finely minced jalapeno.  Fantastic with stew or chili!

Changed the recipe a little and I really enjoyed it!  To decrease calories, I did the following:  eliminated the margarine and microwaved the vegies.  I like a sweet cornbread, so I used 2/3 c Splenda.  I didn't have canned corn, so I used 1 1/3 c frozen corn.  I substituted Egg Beaters.  I will make this from now on, it is better than the other corn bread recipes on this site.  I have made it a couple of times in a few days.

This was not at all what I had expected & unfortunately my boyfriend would not take a second bite after the first one. I was very dissapointed.

Not the best.  I chopped up the vegetables fine.  But not sweet at all and I have had better.

This was an awesome recipe.  Very easy and delicous!! I can say this was DEFINATELY not 10 servings-probably 5 in my house-lol-goes quick.  Another hint, be sure to grease the pan, i didn't and part of my bread is in the pan-but it was still great!!

This is fantastic!  I didn't have all of the ingredients like celery and sage.  I substituted roasted red peppers and cumin.  Added a bit of garlic and chili flakes too.  I didn't even finish making dinner, just ate the corn bread.Tried it in mini loafs and in a round pan.  Both worked great.

I used this as the base to a cornbread stuffing for Thanksgiving and it worked very nicely.  I'm not sure whether or not I like having whole kernals of corn in there, but it was a hit nonetheless.
