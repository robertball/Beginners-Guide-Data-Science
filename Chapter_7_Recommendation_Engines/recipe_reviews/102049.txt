I'm not a huge avocado lover so I mashed up half an avocado, added the full amount of sauce (I did use low sodium but added a pinch of salt to compensate), copied Tunisianswife & hit it w/ a bit of lime zest & ate it w/ cold boiled chicken in a lettuce wrap. I loved the flavor of the ginger w/ the avocado. It was a very nice lunch...thanks Josie!

A fast, simple way to enjoy an avocado with little preparation and only a few ingredients.  It is a definite keeper.  I used the low sodium soy sauce and loved it.  Thanks Josie!

Very good as is, even better with a 1/2 teaspoon of sesame oil. Thanks for the recipe!

I did this just a little different. I scooped out all of the inside that I could, sort of like a twice baked potato.  Then I mixed the garlic, ginger, soy sauce and the avocado together and placed it back into the avocado skin.  We enjoyed it and so simple to make.

I Liked this best when mashed together like guacamole; served on a bed of spinach and tomatoes, it was delicious!  Low sodium soy sauce worked perfectly in this unusual dish.

This is excellent.  I probably doubled the amount of ginger.  If you let the ginger & soy sauce sit together a bit, the flavors really pop.

The trick is to let the sauce sit so that it can absorb the flavors. DH loved this. In fact, he asked me to make the same sauce for some raw tofu today. It;s very versatile. I used Kikkoman soy sauce.

any avocado lover would love this recipe!  Such a wonderful lunch.  I only had low sodium soy, and added just a touch of lime zest on top.  Absolutely delish!  So nutritious too; full of fiber and the good 'fat'.

This was ok.  I can see where some may really enjoy the way the asian flavors compliment the buttery avocado.  It was different and good, but not having too much experience with fresh ginger, I found it to be a little overwhelming.  The salt in the soy was strong too...I added a little olive oil to cut the flavor down.
Will probably make again, for a change from the norm...but not my fave.

We really enjoyed this, a delicious change to the usual boring, salted avocado. I increased the amount of soy sauce for extra flavour, and left out the ginger as a personal preference. Ate most of this as is, the rest I chopped up and invented a sort of salad with cold ramen noodles and vegetables. Delicious!

What a delicious way to prepare an avocado, Josie. I have been enjoying this recipe at least  once a week since finding  it almost 2 months ago, although I do usually use the low sodium soy sauce. Thank you for suggesting it to me.

OK - I know it's a little forward of me to be reviewing my own recipe, but this particular way of eating avocados is really good. If your not a big fan of this little green beauty, try this version, you might be suprised.  Happy Eating.

I prefer low sodium soy sauce with a touch of honey and lime to round out the flavors. .  It's so good and so healthy.

Made this tonight w/3 ripe avocados - my 8-year old scooped out the flesh, mixed the sauce and everything together, then spooned it back in the shells.  We used the "twice-baked" idea posted by a previous reviewer.  Yum, yum, and YUM!  Delicious while the chicken and veggies were grilling.  Quick and easy.  Highly recommended!

Excellent, but added a dash of cayenne pepper with a tablespoon of soy sauce. Slightly mashed the avocado and used as a spread in a tortilla shell w/ turkey, lettuce, and swiss chesse. Excellent.

A new topping for my sandwiches!  My avocado was getting bad so I had to cut it up/mash it to get rid of the bad spots.  Here are the things I did a bit differently . . . 1. Mashed my avocado.  2. Used about 3/4 tsp minced garlic.  3.  Didn't have ginger root so I substituted about 1/4-1/2 teaspoonful ground ginger.  I would add to taste!  4. I used a bit more than 1 tsp of soy sauce for more flavor but use the LOW SODIUM soy sauce.  Mine was a bit too salty.  5. Makes a great spread for sandwiches, vegetables, salads, etc.

The sauce is fantastic. We added this recipe to the PF Chang lettuce wraps (home made) and it made them fantastic! I would recommend making it earlier and allowing it to sit for a couple of hours. Also, using low sodium soy sauce is sufficient since the fresh ginger and garlic really give a lot of the flavor.

Salvaged it by tossing it into a big salad.  I couldn't taste it that way. Wouldn't make this again.

Too lazy to check recipe so I did it from memory. On a half avocado, I sprinkled a few drops of low sodium soy, small sprinkle of ginger & garlic powder and thought I remembered onion powder. I know now it wasn't there but the onion powder was delish! Have been having this snack nightly.

My wife were excited about a new way to eat avocado but it turned out too salty for our tastes. I guess we'll just stick to the Mexican recipies using avocados.

This "Asian Avocado" was good. I used my microplane to grate my ginger and garlic. My garlic had a bit of a "skunky taste," so I added a tad of honey to tame it. I like this idea: I will try it with plain ponzu sauce next time. Thank you JOSIE for sharing your recipe.

Such a great alternative to eating avocado, adding sesame seed to it takes it to another level. Glad I read the reviews, adding the sesame really does taste similar to sushi rolls. Low sodium soy sauce helps cut the saltiness, ginger powder and garlic powder works if you don't have the fresh stuff. I love this recipe, I make it from time to time, usually when I get bored with guacamole.

This was a very quick, delicious treat. I served it as an appetizer but it is simple enough to eat as a snack any old time. I got great compliments on it from others too.

Awesomely simple and delicious.  I found that having the ginger and garlic pieces in there had a bit much bite.  So I strained the soy sauce and filled the empty pit, and garnished the minced garlic and ginger at the tip of the avocado in case they wiish to use it for some more flavor.

I absolutely love avocado and used to eat it drizzled  with just soy sauce but the ginger and garlic add so much more flavor and depth. I doubled the mixture and used low sodium soy as well and found that was the perfect amount for me. Thanks for sharing!

SO GOOD!!  I love avocados and I love the asian flavours, so this was a winning combo!  Who would have thought something so simple would be so great?!!  Hubby does not care for avocados as I do, but he did enjoy this, the 'sauce' is super yummy.  I too, added a small amount of sesame oil as it really complements all of the ingredients in this.  I will make these again for sure when I am looking for a quick, satisfying lunch, thanks!

WOW, OH WOW!!!  These are absolutely fabulous!  I added a splash of sesame oil to the garlic, ginger and low sodium soy sauce.  I also added a pinch of sesame seeds too.  My husband remarked that it tasted just like the avocado you find in sushi rolls.  Trust me, folks, this is really THAT good!  I can see this being a staple side dish for most dinners during the summer.  I'll be buying avocados from Costco in bulk from now on.  Thanks, Josie.

I have a surplus of avocados right now and was looking for new ways to eat them.  This was interesting and good.  I used more garlic and ginger than recommended and I liked it that way.  Worth trying!

I made this last night for my son, his girlfriend and my boyfriend. We all loved it! I tripled the sauce recipe for two whole avocados and served with Firecracker Salmon and Sesame Noodles from this site. The only change I made was to add about 1 teaspoon of sesame oil. I can't wait to make it again. Thank you, Josie, for a unique and delicious recipe.

Grocery store had avocados on sale for 88cents each so I was looking for recipes and found this one and glad I did.  What a change from just plain old avocados.  I love this recipe.  It is perfect.  I did add a small squeeze of lime juice to the mix.  Thanks for this new twist on avocados!

I absolutely loved this!  I ended up making 4x the amount of sauce, and putting cubes of avocado over a bed of greens for a full meal. I added 1/2 teaspoon of sesame oil too.

If you're going to make this recipe, you must use light soy sauce. We used regular and just couldn't eat it. Too salty.

Fantastic, made me think of sushi.  Don't leave the sauce overnight, it becomes too potent and overpowers the avocado.

This is awesome.  It reminded me of eating avocado rolls at a sushi restaurant, where I eat there all the time.  I never thought to combine the flavours to make this one though.  I used low-sodium Japanese soy sauce.  Excellent, and thanks a lot for the recipe.  I'll be making this one over and over.

We usually salt our avocados, so the soy sauce mixture was a neat change.  We didn't have fresh ginger, so I substituted ground Jamaican ginger, which tasted just fine.

I was doubtful  as to taste with so few ingredients but was I ever fooled.  This was absolutely delicious in fact I'm making it again again for my dinner tonight.  I can see where it will be one of my favorite go to's in future.  I had to substitute dry, ground ginger as I didn't have any fresh.  Bought fresh today and I'm sure it will be even better and it doesn't get easier than this.

Yum!  I use low-sodium soy sauce because the taste isn't as aggressive in this dish.  I sometimes make without the garlic too - just depends on my mood.

We make this constantly!  SO delicious! SO easy. We put all ingredients in a tiny lidded Tupperware, shake, then drizzle over avocado which we have sliced onto a plate. We usually add a dribble of sesame oil to the dressing as well. If we don't want bad breath, we leave the garlic out :)

Excellent!  Instead of minced garlic and fresh ginger, I used fresh garlic and minced ginger. Fantastic any way you slice it! ;)

I liked it. I too, did the mashed version. Didn't bother to put it back in the skin (barbarian that I am). I have a finely-minced ginger garlic blend that I got in a bodega, so I used a tsp of that and a tsp of full-up kikkoman for half an avocado. I can't imagine using that amount for an entire avocado...it would be too weak, so I will definitely double up if I use a whole one.

My sesame oil did not survive my move and I haven't replaced it yet. Looking forward to that addition next time.

Very good and simple way to eat avocado. I also added a little sesame oil and topped with a few sesame seeds. I'm not usually a fan of avocado on its own, but loved it this way.

very simple way to eat avocadoes.  I agree with a previous review about not adding too much soy saouce, it definitely overpowers the avocado.

Wow. Ok. The fresh minced garlic is tongue-destroying even to the most loyal and dedicated garlic lover. Ginger - ditto. The amount of soy sauce makes it too salty. I'm guessing this review will be replaced by "I did not care for this recipe." And no, I didn't care for it at all.

This is easy and it tastes great!  I usually only like avocado in guac but I had a couple and needed to try something with them and this was a hit.  The garlic does cause some major garlic breath but it was worth it!

I loved the taste, so I mashed it up and used it as the dressing for a salad. It's great, I was trying to find something different for lunch, and I found it! I added 1/2 tsp minced garlic and a wee bit more ginger (didn't have fresh I used ground instead) and soy sauce. This one goes in the recipe box - I'll definitely make it again. Delish! :)

almost too simple, but something to do with a spare avocado that you don't want to go to waste.  does taste good!
