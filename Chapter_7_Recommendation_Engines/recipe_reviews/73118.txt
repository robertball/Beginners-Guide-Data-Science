I was skeptical to try this, as my brain told me good, homemade soup takes hours.  I made a couple of substitutions to work with what I had on hand--my homemade tomatoes put up from my garden, already seasoned with onion, olive oil and parsley for one. I also used regular tomato juice rather than V-8, and added  garlic powder, salt and pepper. I used basil from my garden, so it couldn't have been any fresher. So you throw a few things into a pot, stir, and add a couple of things to finish. How easy is that? Not only that, but this soup, garnished with a sprig of basil, was as pretty and delicious as any we've had in fine restaurants. This is yet another example of how great food doesn't have to be time consuming and complicated--just a few good and simple ingredients can turn out something amazing.

I didn't want a creamy soup - just a tomato basil soup so I started out knowing I wasn't going to be putting the butter or cream in....  I used a 14.5 oz. can of crushed tomatoes and a 14.5 oz. can of petite diced tomatoes.  I put this in the food processor with the basil reserving half of the can of diced tomatoes for a chunky soup. I transferred everything to the saucepan along with chicken broth, V8, 1 Tbsp. of minced garlic, 1 tsp. of vinegar, 1/2. tsp. of thyme, 1 Tbsp. of brown sugar, and some salt & pepper. I followed the cooking time and it was delicious.  I topped it with some seasoned croutons and served with BLT's.

I work at a small cafe and needed a Tomato Basil Soup recipe for a bridal shower for 40.  This worked out to be the best since fresh tomatoes were out of the budget.  I have recieved SO many compliments and repeat customers for this soup, so much so that it has become a regular menu item!!  The only change I made was to add about a table spoon of brown sugar to a recipe for 12.

This soup was pretty good, but I felt it did need some seasoning.  I added about a tsp of sugar, lots of salt and pepper, some garlic powder and a pinch of curry powder.  I actually liked the soup better before adding the cream (I used half and half) and butter.  I'll definitely make it again, but leave out the cream and butter.  Oh, I also added a splash of balsamic vinegar just at the end of cooking.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow!  This was so delicious!  Even my husband, who normally can give or take tomato soup, said this was great and he liked that it was thicker than the average bowl of Campbell's- and much tastier too!  I followed the recipe completely until the very end, and instead of an entire cup of cream, I only added half a cup, and I omitted the butter altogether.  The creamy consistency was perfect. I also added a little bit of dried dill to add to the herb flavor, a teaspoon of bottled minced garlic, and some salt and pepper.  The end result was VERY close to the Tomato-Dill Soup I love at one of our local restaurants.  Great recipe Rachel!

Wow...my boyfriend and I are huge fans of tomato soup, and were looking to try our hands at making some of our own instead of relying on Campbell's, so my stepmom recommended this site to me.  I stumbled across your recipe, and decided on making it.  It turned out wonderfully.  I think this is some of the best tomato soup I've ever had...definately better than Campbell's!

Very good and so easy.  I would recommend thickening a bit but that's only because I like my soups with a bit more structure. I also added two large crushed cloves of garlic and fat-free half and half as well as salt and pepper to taste and it came out quite tasty. With a few tweaks it will be a five-star recipe.

I would probably go ahead and give this one 5 stars if I'd have followed the directions. So the less than perfect rating is actually my own fault. But don't get me wrong, it was still very good. I used half & half in place of heavy cream and light, whipped butter in place of the real deal. Also, I did not puree in the blender as instructed... (I was in a hurry and skipped it). However, the flavor was truly excellent. I will make this  again and do as the recipe states next time; I'll bet it'll be "wonderful" rather than just "good".

I doubled the basil & I used organic crushed tomatoes that were a little bitter so I added a tsp of sugar. I also cut the butter back some & I used half & half for the cream. I think the soup needs the richness the cream adds though so next time I will just decrease the amount some. Not my favorite tomato soup recipe but it was super-easy & almost as good as my favorite. I served it w/ grilled swiss sandwiches on WW. Thanks for the recipe, CaraMommy!

I made this for a Soup Day lunch @ work and made according to the directions exactly. It truly is a five star recipe. Everyone raved about it being restaurant quality soup. I did doubled the recipe. If you make it don't change a thing!!!
Thanks Rachel for such a fine soup:)

I'm rating this based on the original recipe, but will tell you how to make it a 4 star.  Day one we found this soup to be bland, boring and uninspiring.  Day two it had a more intense flavor, but still lacking.  I had made some pesto (All Recipes Spinach Basil Pesto) and put a dollop into my bowl of soup and then it was YUM!

I sauteed some finely chopped fresh garlic and onion (with some fresh ground pepper and salt) in the butter, then added the rest of the ingredients. I did not use the full amount of cream, just a quarter cup was just right for us. We really liked this soup, especially my youngest boy. Watching him eat this soup with grilled cheese was the highlight of my day.

This was fantastic! The only thing I will change the next time I make this is I will chop up the basil leaves. The reason being is that whenever you took a spoon of soup, these long wilted strips of basil just hung off your spoon!

This soup is Fabulous!!  I tripled the recipe and served it with garlic cheese croutons as part of a buffet for a birthday party and everyone loved it!  As other reviewers suggested, I used half & half instead of heavy cream.  I also used Low Sodium vegetable juice in order to control the salt, so I ended up adding a good amount of kosher salt and a small amount of pepper and garlic powder along the way.  This soup just gets better with time.  I made mine the day before, refrigerated it, and then kept at serving temp on my stove for hours during the party.  Although it would have been good served  immediately, it was superb when allowed time to blend the flavors.  The basil flavor really came out overnight!  People who don't even like tomato soup LOVED this recipe!!  I will definately make this again and again.  Thanks!

Pretty good basic soup. And if I was looking for something tastier than canned soup, this is it. If I'm looking for a gourmet experience--this obviously isn't it. But last night's dinner of this soup & grilled cheese was delicious. So much so, we're having the same again tonight--except w/ the leftover soup.

Delish!  I made a couple of changes but used same basic recipe.  I added 1 tsp of garlic powder, 1 tsp sugar, 1/2 tsp oregano.  I also substituted canned tomato juice over cocktail juice and lowered fat content by using fat-free half & half instead of heavy cream.  It was wonderful served with hot sourdough toasted bread.

Excellent recipe! I was amazed it was so quick and easy. It tastes just like the Tomato Basil soup served in upscale shops. I tweaked a little, but didn't change the basic recipe. I added 1 tsp sugar, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp onion powder and 1/2 tsp oregano. I used spicy V-8 juice as well. Before heating, I pureed the tomatoes, V-8 juice, broth and basil in a blender for 1-2 minutes. Then, I cooked the soup according to the recipe. Fantastic! Even my picky kids loved it.

Delicious! Suggested alterations: low sodium broth, low sodium SPICY V8, only 4 oz heavy cream, and 3 oz fat free cream cheese (instead of butter).
A little thicker and DELICIOUS... if my math is correct:
1c = 95 cal & 10 carbs

I have been looking all over the internet for years for the right recipe. This is it! The recipe is perfect, and exactly what I wanted. I shared with my family and friends and they loved it! Its been requested multiple times since then.

YUMMMMMYYYY!!!! This was one heck of a soup, and SO easy to make. I picked this soup because it used canned tomatoes, and I had several cans to use up. I spiced this up a LOT with garlic powder, onion, powder, and some cayenne. It was really creamy but not heavy. I'll make this again very soon. Went perfect with the sandwich I made.

My mom made this for me when I was healing from my c-section. She reduced the peanut butter as recommended in other reviews. I could still taste the p.b., which wasn't necessarily bad. Nonetheless, I didn't love this recipe. It was okay. I'll look for another recipe for tomato basil soup...

I was in the mood for grilled cheese and tomato soup today, and was out of condensed. I halved this recipe since it was only for my daughter and me. I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so a can of the petite diced tomatoes served as the pinch hitter today. Well, guess what? No fresh basil either, so I used the dried stuff (gasp!). I added spices to my liking and used  reviewer suggestions to add brown sugar (used 1 tsp since I was halving the recipe). I used a cup of half & half, as well as a couple ounces of cream cheese. Served with a triple cheese grilled cheese sandwich, I felt like a kid again. If only DD would've felt the same way. Lovely recipe; I look forward to trying this with fresh ingredients next time!

Great basic tomatoe soup recipe! Then one can add spices & such as health, taste and preference dictates. We love left overs so doubled it. Added more basil & garlic powder. Blended & added my own bottled stewed tomatoes that have seasonings, celery & onions.

This soup is fabulous, but definitely add some spices - garlic powder, onion powder and flakes, salt and pepper. I would also add a little more basil.

5 stars for ease, 4 for taste. It seemed to need something, so I added quite a bit of onion powder (gradually) and a tsp. of sugar. It was delicious. Oh...I couldn't bring myself to add the butter; maybe it would have sweetened it, but I can't imagine it would have added that much flavor.

This was fabulous!! I will make again and again and again! Tomatos did not taste like they were from a can, and I blended it to make it smoother. It was just incredible! Dont change a thing!

Bought diced tomatoes accidentally, just smashed em up with my meat tenderizer though and followed the directions. None fresh, so I used 1 tsp dried basil which I added in the end. The soup shrank up quite a bit. It tasted delicious. We ate it with toasted whole wheat Simple Truth bread, nothing super fancy, and it was great with it. The soup is just as good as a fancy restaurant. It only made 4 servings, however, but it was a side to chicken casserole. Will make again.

We loved this soup.  I had to use dried basil so I put it in at the very beginning and let it cook with the tomatoes for thirty minutes or so.  Following some advice from other reviewers I decided to add the TBSP of brown sugar.  I have had better tomato basil - so next time I will pay attention to it's flavor a little bit better so that I can compare.  Texture was smooth.  I hate tomatoes and tomato soup out of a can.  Tomato basil - I LOVE.  Good recipe!

I just finished a bowl of this delicious easy soup. I have to admit I'm on the tail end of a very bad cold and left out the cream, since not good for congestion, or my diet. I guess I was reading so many tomato soup recipes that I got confused and sauteed some sweet onions in butter, and then added all the ingredients, except the extra butter and heavy cream. Well my mistake turned out to taste really great. I chopped some garden chives and mixed in too with the garden fresh basil. I did use my food processor and puree with just a few pulses. I'm sure the heavy cream is great...but for those that want to leave it out...still so fresh and delicious tasting.

This is a very tasty soup and very close to the flavor I was trying to replicate!  I do agree with other reviewers, though, that 1 T. brown sugar is an essential addition to this recipe.  Thanks for sharing, CARAMOMMY!

This is a good basic soup.  I did feel it needed some more seasoning so I added salt, pepper and onion powder.  I also added about a tablespoon of brown sugar to tone down the acidity.  I think next time I might try omitting the butter to see if it is really needed.  I served it over a bowl of rice.  My family really enjoyed it.  Thanks!

Just made this soup.  It was fabulous!  As good as you might expect from any fine restaurant.  I took advice from a couple other reviews and did add 1/2 T brown sugar, plus I did puree the soup. Will be making it often!

This is delish. I made it every week last summer with basil from my backyard. It is very forgiving - I know because I often get the measurements or order of events wrong. It still tastes great. When basil isn't growing outside, we just use jarred pesto. Mmmmm.

Very easy to make, and delicious. As other reviewers have suggested, I will add a tablespoon of brown sugar to the soup next time, as it was a bit acidy tasting. Served with light and fluffy spinach quiche, also from this site, for a wonderful and easy Saturday supper. Thanks!

Weeknight favorite!  Great with low fat grilled cheese sandwiches on whole wheat bread.  I omit the butter and use fat free half and half instead of cream...still wonderful and much more figure friendly!

Very easy and very tasty resipe.  I am not a huge fan of tomato soup and made this for a friend.  I had to try it to see if it was missing anything and I really liked the taste.  I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream to cut down on the fat and still had a thick creamy soup.  I also added about a tablespoon of sugar - I always seem to do that when I use tomato products.  Other than that I made it per the recipe and there was nothing that needed to be added.

This soup was great. I followed the recipe exactly how it is and it was wonderful. I don't understand some of the comments stating it was bland. I used Hunts crushed tomatoes, can of Campbell's tomato juice concentrate and fresh basil and it was full of flavor with the ingredients. Best soup ever

The best tomato soup ever.  I don't even like tomato soup but a local restaurant sells one that they serve in a bread bowl-tried it because of that bread bowl.  I decided to make a batch for a potluck. (I liked this one because I thought the cream would cut down the acidic nature of tomatoes.) I toasted a loaf of French bread with a butter garlic sauce then dipped it in the soup.  My coworkers lifted the crock pot and scraped out every drop and ate every crumb of the bread!  I making some now (without butter and cream) with homegrown basil and tomatoes to can for the winter.  I will add butter and cream when I'm ready to eat!

Just made this soup this afternoon. It was the best tomato soup I've ever made. I added a bit of sugar because of my tomatoes being a bit on the acid side, but otherwise followed the recipe to a t. If you're going to switch up a recipe, please submit your own. It always makes me laugh when people add this or that and then rate a recipe. This is perfect on it's own.

This recipe was delicious!! My first instinct was to doctor it up with other spices but I decided to make it exactly as written (except I totally forgot the butter at the end). I thought to myself, "how could something this simple and easy be so good?" Even without the butter this recipe was great and it will surely become one of my regular meals. I started by putting the basil leaves and crushed tomatoes in the blender on purée for a few minutes. My picky husband has an issue with textures so I had to make sure it was super smooth. I usually use an immersion blender for hot soups because the steam can pop the lid off my blender but I don't get all of the chunks out with the immersion blender so I puréed it before cooking it. I love that this recipe uses crushed tomatoes because peeling/cutting fresh tomatoes  is too time consuming and are not cost effective unless you have tomatoes in your garden. I've made tomato soup with fresh tomatoes before and I honestly didn't miss them with this soup. To prevent the cream from curdling I heated it up before I put it into my lightly simmering soup (I've learned this lesson through past fails!). I served it with freshly grated asiago cheese and garlic Romano croutons. My family loved it, thanks for the recipe!

We enjoyed this quite a bit. I didn't add anything other than what the recipe called for. However, I did use half and half in place of the heavy cream. My family did not find it lacking in any flavor and the kids really liked dipping their grilled cheese in it.

This was fine and I did it 'mostly' as written. I did use fresh picked tomatoes out of my garden instead of canned and home made tomato juice. I used 1/2 and 1/2 since my heavy cream was outdated. I think there are better soup recipes out there.

The soup was tasty, but it was better before I added the heavy cream.  Wish I wouldn't have added that.  I thought it would give it even more flavor, but really it took away from the flavor.  I will make this again, but will try it with half the butter, and probably no cream.

quick and easy to make! So much better than canned soup.  I used spicy tomato-veg juice.  Probably will add more basil next time

This is the best tomato soup recipe I've tried on here so far.  It was a little tomato-ey, so if you don't like that this might not be the recipe for you.  I made it just as written except that I used vitamin D milk instead of heavy cream.  I got 9 small bowls.

This is AWESOME soup. And so so easy to make. Highly recommend it. I made toasted granny smith apple and swiss cheese on ciabatta to go with it. So yummy.

I had a ton of tomatoes from Hubs’ garden that I needed to use, so I decided to make a double batch of this recipe.  On my kitchen scale I weighed out the equivalent number of ounces of fresh tomatoes that the recipe indicated for canned.  I chopped the tomatoes and simmered them as instructed for 30 minutes.  I then used my emersion blender to puree the soup.  I forced it through a fine sieve to eliminate the skins and seeds and then added the basil, 1/4 t. garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Another buzz with the emersion blender and it was ready for the freezer.  I generally figure that 1 1/2 cups of soup equals one entrée size serving.  My double recipe yielded eight 1 1/2 cup servings.  I packaged them two servings per container for the freezer.  For each two-serving container, once thawed, I added 1/2 cup of heavy cream.  And since my soup was rather thin I made a roux with 1 T. flour and 1T. softened butter (which cut the butter in the recipe in half).  I tempered the roux with a little of the hot soup and then added it back to the soup.  That helped give the soup some body without making it too thick.  We really enjoyed this one and I think it was especially good using Hubs’ wonderful garden tomatoes.  I’m delighted we have more waiting in the freezer.  Excellent recipe!

4.5 Not as good as the fresh tomato soup on this site but much faster and one doesn't have to peel and deseed the tomatoes.  Used half and half and the immersion blender, yummo!

Fresh tomatoes are not always available where I live.  Sometimes I can find canned tomatoes, but usually not the kind I need/want for a recipe.  I adapted this recipe using 1 (28 oz) can of tomato puree, 1 (14.5 oz) can of diced tomatoes, and 1 (6 oz) can of tomato paste.  I first sauted 1/2 diced onion and approx 3 cloves fresh minced garlic in a little olive oil.  Next added all the canned tomatoes and simmered for about 20 mins.  Next I added the fresh basil and salt and pepper to taste.  Pureed all in a food processor then returned the mixture to the pot.  I added the cream but no butter and simmered for an additional 10 mins (till heated).  Garnished with fresh basil leaves and served with crusty French baguette slices that I broiled in the oven topped with fresh Parmesan.  Delicious!

Delicious! As others suggested, I left out the milk and butter and it was still delicious.  I also added some dill which added some great flavour.

I've made this twice in the past month.  So good! and to think before I tried this I hated tomato soup.  Even my roommate who didn't care for tomato soup loved this! I make it as is stirring cheddar cheese in before serving.  Thank you Rachel!

We really liked this especially topped with just a little sprinkle of finely shredded cheese.  Looked beautiful!  I used half and half for the cream as that is what I had on hand.  I will be making this again and NEVER buying the canned stuff.  I recommend only blending half and leaving the other half a little chunky.  Reminds me of progressive chunky tomato soup (that I can no longer find in the store???).

Used home-canned tomatoes and basil from my garden.  This was the best homemade tomato soup I've ever made.  Easy, too.  Even my daughter, who doesn't like tomato soup, ate it all up!

Really good and my 4 year old loved it. I used spicy V8 & dried basil because that is what I had. Will definatly make again. Only gave 4 stars because it had a bit more cream than I would have liked.

This was ABSOLUTELY delicious!!! I did make a small change though. Before adding all of the tomatoes and such, I sauteed half of a chopped onion and a teaspoon of minced garlic. Also, I just put the basil into the food processor and chopped it all up.

Fast Easy recipe! Fesh frozen tomatoes were used with  1/2 and 1/2 and cut the butter down by me, I'll try the original version next time...more fat always tastes better. Seasoned w/ sea salt and fresh ground pepper. I'll put more basil in the left overs and spice it up a bit more for my taste.

Made this soup a few weekends ago.  I have been looking for a receipe that tastes like the Au Bon Pain tomato basil bisque soup, and this was it!  Served it with pepper jack grilled cheese sandwiches.  It was delicious!

This soup is AMAZING! I followed the recipe exact with the exception of adding just a little shredded mozzarella at the end as a garnish. It was the best tomato cream soup I've ever had. The basil really shines and the cream is perfect. Love! Love! Love!

This recipe was ok.  I needed to make a lot of adjustments.  The cream was way too much and turned this into a creamy tomato basil soup instead of a tradtional tomato soup.  I found it a bit bland and needed to use additional spices.

This soup is amazing.  I doubled the entire recipe but halved the amt of cream (half & half) and butter.  As mentioned by other reviewers I added some garlic powder, garlic flakes, onion flakes, curry and brown sugar.  I usually only eat tomato soup when i'm dipping a grilled cheese in it, but this soup can definitely stand on it's own.  Delicious!

Very good base recipe.  I did modify quite a bit just to be sure it was delish.  Sauteed finely chopped onion and garlic before adding the puree.  Also added a little bit of finely grated carrot and 1 teaspoon of sugar.  I didn't have cream, so I substituted canned evaporated milk.  Oh, also chopped up a handful of spinach leaves.  Yumm-o and healthy!

Yum! I modified it to make it healthier and it was still wonderful! (I know, I know, that's a crime, but I have health problems that make it a necessity!) I used 2 cups of 2% milk, and only half the butter. I also added a small can of tomato paste, which made it have a much richer tomato flavor. I also used veggie broth because the hubby is vegetarian. Wonderful!

Incredible recipe!  I tripled it to take to my son's school and I was blown away by how easy and tasty this recipe is!  Several people asked for the recipe and one is making it for a tailgate this weekend!  The only thing I changed was to add some minced garlic.  I used homemade chicken stock (only because I had some frozen) so I needed to add a little salt as well.  I may cut back a bit on the cream and butter next time, just to save calories.  Fabulous -- thanks for sharing!

Excellent/ used the canned fire roasted tomatoes/sauted half small onion and one garlic clove at the start then added remaining ingred/used olive oil in place of butter and fat free 1/2 and 1/2, only added enough of it until the color was right to our liking. Great base to start from. Only two of us and over a couple of rainy days here in SC we finished it all.

I am a cook at a sorority house and recently needed a recipe for tomato basil soup (quickly).  This one was first on the list and I printed it out to use.  I increased the amounts to make enough to feed around 65 girls, but because most of these girls eat as if each meal is their last, I needed to stretch the final amount.  My solution was to add some condensed Campbell's soup to the mixture and some water.  The results were amazing.  The girls asked for sour cream as a "side" and added dollups of sour cream directly into the soup.  They literally licked the bowls clean!!!

Our family of 9 is always so happy to hear it is tomato soup day at our house since I found this recipe!  My 6-year-old son says this is a "million star" soup. (They often rate the new recipes I try.) For cost savings and to serve our large family I buy one of those huge cans of tomato sauce at Sam's club and use that. (gallon size?) I have also used dried basil and it still tastes great.  I serve with grilled or toasted cheese sandwiches and a salad. Yum! Yum!

Holy Mackerel! This was amazing! I added 2 cloves of diced garlic, and used diced tomatoes instead of the juice. I chopped the basil up and added at 15 mins and it was UNBELIEVABLE!!!

Nice quick, easy and good tasting soup.  Has a fresh tomato taste without fresh tomatoes--but fresh basil is crucial!  I used 1/2 cup fat free half and half and 2 Tablespoons of butter then seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  I think it would taste good no matter how you played around with the ingredients

What this recipe neglects to mention is that it may be a good idea to let the soup mixture cool down before putting it in the blender. Otherwise you will have a soup explosion on your hands. Also, I put in less tomato juice than the recipe calls for, just a couple of splashes. A whole can would make the soup too runny and not creamy enough.

I have made this twice.  I added additional tomatoes the second time (a can of diced tomatoes) and it was better. I might even add more fresh basil next time as well. It is really good though and extremely quick and simple..

I am not a fan of tomatoes, but I love the tomato basil or tomato bisque soups that you find in restaurants, so we decided to try to make one at home.  This was very easy and very good.  I did use 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream and I did add 2 heaping teaspoons of white sugar.  We also added garlic croutons to the top when we were eating and that really made it taste great!

Fabulous recipe and so easy.  A hit every time I make it.  I've found the soup refrigerates well and can be made ahead of time or leftovers reheated.

This was lovely!  Elegant, balanced, flavorful.  Don't change a thing from the recipe!  It's a little dull looking until you add the basil, cream, and butter.  Make this for a special treat!  Easy, and fantastic!

Came out wonderful!!! I also added 3 cloves of garlic, 1 tsp of dried  Italian herds, and I didn't have fresh basil so I added 2 tsp. dried basil. I pureed in a blender and added it back to the pan and gently whisked the heavy cream and butter. Soooo good!!!! Also made Muenster grilled cheese to go with it!!!

I'm really impressed with how tasty this was given the simplicity of the recipe. I couldn't stop eating it! I stuck to the recipe minus swapping out evaporated milk for the heavy cream. I garnished with grated Parmesan and black pepper. This will be a mainstay! 
Also, another reviewer mentioned that it needed a thickening agent but I didn't see the need at all. Since the soup boils for a half hour, it condenses a bit on it's own and the crushed tomatoes made for a perfect texture.
Thanks to the OP for sharing this recipe!

I made this twice. The first time, I cut the recipe in half, because husband was away and it was just me. I used diced tomatoes, a small can of spicy V-8, and dried basil. I used the hand mixer leaving some chunks of tomato. I also used salt and pepper. This was very good. The second time, I followed recipe exact. Was lacking something. I added salt and pepper and some dried basil. Better with salt, pepper, and dried basil than without. And after adding fresh basil, used hand mixer to blend basil. No tomato chunks. Prefer the chunks of tomato. I think diced tomatoes worked better for my taste.

I made it according to the recipe, and added oregano, onion powder, and garlic powder.  I thought it was delicious and my friends enjoyed it.  I gave it 5 stars because I was looking for both tastiness and simplicity.

This is my personal favorite!  It's basically the copycat recipe for LA Madeline's Tomato Basil Soup if you loved that too. 

No need to change anything, but I do recommend using the best variety of tomatoes you can, such as D. O. P. Certified San Marzano Italian canned tomatoes.  And of course kosher salt and fresh cracked pepper to taste.

This was DEE-licious! I halved it , using a can (~14.5oz) of stewed tomatoes that I wanted to use up (with celery, onion and green pepper in it). I used my mini-processor to process them.  From experience, I don't like the grainy texture it produces, so I also strained it, and it was nice and smooth. I forgot that I wanted to process my fresh basil with the tomatoes. So instead, I added the basil to the small can of V-8 juice, and processed that.  To the soup, I also added 2 TBLSP of tomato paste (gave the soup a richer taste and color), ~2 tsp of brown sugar, garlic powder and pepper. I used low-fat milk with no problem (less fat, too). It needed some salt while having it. Thanks for this great recipe!!

I didn't use the seasoned crushed tomatoes so I added some dry oregano.  Also, I used half and half,  and I added no salt at all and this was creamy and delicious!  OH SO GOOD! And I paired it with grilled cheese on home made bread. My husband loved it.

This is fantastic! If you like Tomato Basil soup you'll love this...I did add a Tbsp of sugar, using evaporated milk in place of cream, because of what I had on hand. This is my go to for simple decadence.

I grew up on tomato soup, from a can. I decided to make it myself. This was delicious. I didn't change anything, (I unfortunately didn't have fresh basil) but was so good. Great for our cold night here in MS with some grilled cheese.

This is a favorite and fall staple of mine!!!  I add onion, garlic, mushrooms and polish sausage and served with goldfish crackers on the side.  It's fantastic and everyone ALWAYS wants the recipe.

This is even better the next day!  Everyone in my family loved this soup. My 6 year old even asked me to save some to pack in her lunch the next day.  

I have made this twice and used a little less butter and added a bit of garlic powder the second time.

This is so easy and delicious. I am always asked to bring this to social functions. I double the recipe and there are no leftovers. If you don't like it so creamy, you can cut the heavy cream in half which I do sometimes.

Delicious.   I used Spicy V8 and added some salt, pepper and garlic powder.  Very easy to make.  I didn't have any fresh basil, so I used dry.  I'm sure the basil flavor would come thru better with fresh, but I was very happy with my results.

Another reviewer suggested making pesto and adding that to the soup instead of using plain basil. I did that and it really made the soup have a rich flavor and warm lingering aftertaste. It would have been bland for my tastes if I had not done that.

I've made Rachel's Tomato Basil soup 3 times.  One big triple batch to serve with grilled cheese sandwiches to a Presidential Debate party.  Needless to say there were repeat requests for this amazing soup and requests for the recipe.  Made again for a road trip in the motorhome.  It keeps well in the refrigerator for several days and my husband and I both love having it day after day....it is that good.  Just finished off another double batch.....served to a granddaughter who turns her nose up at anything tomato...And She Loved It!!!!...and requested a 2nd bowl :)  Leaving on another MH trip next Monday and we will be taking another double batch.  Always.....made exactly as the recipe is written ...don't change a thing it is perfect. And remember.....tomatoes are a very low calorie way to add that healthy potassium and lycopene to your diet...such a heart healthy food. Thank you Rachel!

I am giving this 5 stars because it is a great recipe to build upon for your favorite recipe.  I need a way to use up more of the tomatoes from my garden so I decided to give it ago.  Rather than using a can of tomato-veg juice I used my home-made tomato paste - about 5 heaping table spoons.  Noting other reviews about the richness of the recipe I only added 3/4 cup heavy cream and I didn't use any butter.  Also since I was blending all the ingredients in Vitamix blender I just tossed in the basil leaves whole.  The rest of the recipe I followed.  I think the key for anyone wanting to find their personal favorite tomato basil soup recipe is to taste test after adding more or new ingredients.

It was ok. I will make it again before I make a final decision. However, if you read the reviews, most people that love it changed the recipe. Some to the point that it really isn't the same soup at all. It turned out good but I had higher expectations. Mine definitely needed more salt at the end. It just kinda lacked the full flavor profile that I expect from something I spend the time to make at home.

This is a yummy soup. I skipped the butter and added a clove of garlic and a couple of pinches of sugar. Also, I didn't add a whole cup of cream - more like 3/4 cup. It went great with our grilled sandwiches for lunch. Will make again for sure.

This is an easy, richly flavored soup that's also quick and tasty. I usually add 1-2 tsp of sugar to cut acidity. It can also easily be upgraded with fresh vegetables but using the same ingredients. Try this if you like homemade or don't have V-8 (I've looked for a better recipe but it's not out there).  In the chicken or vegetable broth put two stalks of celery, two carrots and the 2 Tbl. fresh garlic (add a little yellow squash if you have it). Cook for 1o min or until carrots are done. Add Fresh tomatoes peeled or a large can of peeled tomatoes and small can of tomato sauce or the V-8.  Also add 1/2 cup fresh basil. Cook for 30 minutes and puree with hand blender. Add butter and just a small amount of cream (calories!).. it is a great homemade soup. I made this while on a vacation in Spain from fresh ripe tomatoes.. OMG!! Canned are okay too! Also, if you freeze in small containers BEFORE adding butter and cream, it's a great one person meal that is quicker than a can!

Made this and the flavor was rather bland but it still had potential ! I went ahead and added about 1 tbsp of chicken bouillon and maybe like 2 tbsp of chicken broth. I let it boil and finished up the recipe. Then I put it In the blender (maybe like a cup at a time) and made sure it was pureed pretty good. These little steps added lots of great flavor :) I also didn't add the fresh basil..I used the basil seasoning instead.

I didn't expect this soup to be as good as it was! I loved it. After I puréed the soup, I thought it was a bit thin and thought adding the cream would thin it more, so I added a little flour mixed with some water. It was perfect, rich, creamy good.

I have made this as the recipe states, and a
Also Made a few changes - just because!! Both delicious!  Changed by smoking 4 large vine tomatoes as the base, added 1 can of fire roasted tomatoes, added 3 roasted garlic cloves, and replaced heavy cream with Greek yogurt (slightly watered down with some of the chicken broth to be the same consistency of heavy cream)!! This was wonderful served with toasted cheese bread!!! Yummy!!!

This is a truly phenomenal soup. It came out really fantastic, both the time I followed the recipe as written and when I substituted extra vegetable stock and tomatoes for the V8 since I didn't have any. I do use extra basil, because basil is one of my favorite flavors. I always get compliments on this soup - it's especially great with grilled cheese.

Super easy to make and very delicious.  I love to play in the kitchen trying new recipes.  My sons and I have a tradition when I present something new to try.  If we like it, it's worthy of our "Hall of Recipes", which is essentially my recipe box:). If not, the recipe gets tossed.  I admit, I tweaked this a tiny bit.  Here it goes: sautéed garlic with butter first and the added the other ingredients along with salt, pepper, garlic powder a dash of cayenne and a packet of stevia in the raw sweetener (to smooth out the bitterness).  Added extra basil chopped, not cut into thin strips, as I didn't want to have strands of basil floating around.  Also, I used a can of vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.  Thanks so much for this recipe.  It has entered our hall:)

This is the BEST tomato basil soup ever!  You gotta make this one. Stores well in fridge and heating up for leftovers  is a breeze.  I make this all winter long. It's a big hit with our family and is becoming our new comfort food! :)

This soup was amazing!! I only made a few tweaks and that was to add some salt, pepper, oregano and to make it a little thicker kept it on the stove for 15 more minutes after I mixed everything.

My wife and I loved this recipe! It's the nearest we've found to that tomato basil soup served at our favorite Italian restaurant. And so simple to make! Per another reviewer's suggestion, we added about a tablespoon of curry powder.

Best tomato soup out there. I have been making this for years know, and everyone always loves it. I follow the recipe pretty closely but have incorporated some of the recommended changes by other members. I usually get a bowl of tomato soup in a restaurant just to compare to this recipe. This one always wins.

I made a few changes. I cooked diced onion (about half a small onion) with a clove of garlic in 1 T. of butter. Then I added the other ingredients as the recipe called for, but I also added a can of petite diced tomatoes to make it chunky. As other reviewers suggested, I added in about 1 T. of brown sugar, maybe a pinch more. I only added 1/2 c. of Half-and-Half (no butter). My extremely picky husband said it was "restaurant quality". A real win for a wife who doesn't cook (only bakes)! And I served it with grilled cheese sandwiches I made (sauteed some broccoli with sesame oil and salt; spread cream cheese on bread, add feta and mozzarella and the broccoli; broil 'til cheese melts). Perfect Sunday lunch!

This is the best tomato soup I've ever made. Never been a big soup person but this is really good. A great way to use up the fresh basil from the garden. Just right with a grilled cheese sandwich. The only thing I changed was adding a tsp of sugar. Just right.

Great soup but a little acidic so next time I'll add a tsp of sugar. I also added a tablespoon of salt, 1/2 tsp of fresh ground pepper, 2 cloves of minced garlic and an extra 1/2 cup of cream. Fresh basil is the only way to go!

This recipe is great and very versatile.  I highly recommend using Cento canned tomatoes...they truly make the dish!  I did add 1 tbsp of brown sugar and some salt, black pepper, garlic powder and cayenne to taste.  My hubby liked it how it was before the butter and cream, so I just left it like that and added a little butter and cream to my bowl.  It was GREAT both ways!!

I'm not a fan of tomato soup to begin with and didn't care for this at all.  My review is based on my husband & three kids who love tomato soup.  They all thought this was wonderful!  I paired it with the Pesto Grilled Cheese Sandwich from this site and had a home run!  They're already asking when I'll make it again as they're filling their bowls with seconds!

Excellent recipe...definitely a keeper. I used 2 14oz cans of diced tomatoes including one with Jalapeno and that added a nice kick plus I was generous with th basil (using both with Jalapeno would have overpowered the basil too much). I also added 2 tbls of brown sugar to counter the acidity. We both tasted this before and after adding the fats and again found the acidity needed taming. I also made a very flour light roux with the butter and used half and half to help thinken it up slightly. The end result was better than most restaurant versions of this classic. Thanks.

This soup was delicious!!! You MUST use fresh basil though.
I think the only drawback was, for my hubby, he wanted it a bit thicker, so all I am going to do next time is drain the tomaotes....
I don't think there is a better recipe out there for a tomato/basil soup!!!!

This soup was really easy to make! I made a few changes. I used 2 cans of stewed tomatoes because I didn't have crushed tomatoes or juice. I used dried basil as well. I didn't use cream. To thicken the soup I roasted 3 carrots and used sweet potato. I also added onion and celery. I also roasted and added 3 red peppers. I put everything in the food processor. It was sooo good!

Used plain tomato juice instead of V8.  Added 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1/2 tsp. onion powder and 1 tsp. brown sugar.  Very good without pureeing.  Nice rich flavor :)

This was my first attempt at tomato soup and I'm a sucker for easy recipes.  The consistency was perfect, but it was kind of bland.  I just added alot of black pepper, some garlic powder and it turned out really good.  I love tomato soup and will definitely make it again.

OK but didn't have a whole lot of flavor and it just wasn't what I expected. I did follow the recipe exactly but it just needs something more. My family ate it but their comments included, "Campbell's is better" and "Don't save this recipe."

This soup was delicious! I substituted a 14.5 ounce can of diced tomatoes for the tomato juice and added one large clove of garlic and then pureed it. I then cooled and refrigerated it overnight and took it camping and added in the cream and butter after it was simmering over the camp stove. I served it with a little bit of shredded cheese and everyone devoured it! It was a chilly night at camp and this really hit the spot. My boyfriend is begging me to make it again!

Delicious!!! I wanted to find a Tomato Basil Soup that was comprable to Schlotzky's and I found one that's better!!! I followed the recipe exactly and everyone in my family loved it, even my 2 year old cousin couldn't get enough!    A little mozarella cheese on top is a yummy garnish!

This was very, very good as written!  Very simple and easy/quick to make!   I prefer spicier & more tomato chunks so I will add next time.

This was decent.  Maybe my expectations were too high based on all the great reviews, but I didn't think there was anything spectacular about it.  It was an average soup.  I think I will try some other recipes before trying this one again.

I'm not a tomato soup fan (I think it's just warm catsup), but this was very good and easy to make.  I added 1 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. white pepper and 1 Tbl. brown sugar.  Then made a second batch.

This soup was super easy to make so it was perfect for a weeknight and it was delicious. I didn't add the butter, and I don't think it was missing anything without it. I've added this recipe to my rotation.

Very Good.  It needs a little extra spice, so I added some white pepper and garlic.  I also omitted the cream and added some grated parmesan cheese.  Add bite sized ravoli or tortellini and its a great meal.

Absolutly fantastic.  I made this dish exactly to the recipe and thought it wonderful.  Next time though, I intend to leave out the butter.  It tasted good without it!

Wonderful!  I have been looking for a good tomato basil soup for a while now. Used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream. Will try w/maybe half cream and half 1/2 & 1/2 next time to give a little more richness but will defintely make again. Thanks.

5 Plus for its simplicity to make and for the taste!  You MUST use fresh basil.  I did end up using a little more basil than called for. Thanks submitter!

This was incredibly good. I was baking some fresh whole wheat bread, and desperately wanted a grilled cheese and tomato soup. I had no fresh tomatoes on hand, so I used this recipe. I made a grilled cheese with the bread (which was made with mostly white flour, and a little whole wheat flour), provolone and meunster cheese. This is so yummy, a new comfort food favorite.
Side note- I put my hand held Cuisinart blender stick into the pot, and it tipped the pot over onto me and I now have second degree burns on my abdomen, but the soup it still good.

Just ok.  Very acidic tasting.  OK with grilled cheese sandwiches, but I'll try a different recipe next time. Sorry.

I made the recipe hoping for a taste of a tomato-basil soup that we had at a Macaroni Grill restaurant. This recipe was good , but it wasn't what  I was hoping for. I'm the only one in my family of five that ate it. It's the first time that I've ever made a tomato-basil soup, and I would guess that it's a good basic recipe.

What a wonderful and easy to prepare soup!!! I cooked it several times already and will keep on making it. Thank you
