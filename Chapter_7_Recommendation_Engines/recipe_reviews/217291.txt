This is one of my favorite desserts from growing up in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania Dutch country.

Heavens, this was a surprise! I looked around for a quick dessert and what I had on hand. Milk, crackers, eggs and coconut....who knew? Great texture, and I topped it with fruit to make it look prettier!

Very cool recipe. Delicious. Creamy and just perfect on the coconut. I might just try dates the next time. Keeper. Hefty serving for 6! Enjoy.

Such an easy, rewarding recipe!

The ingredients are all at hand, and the pudding was ready to serve in under 20 minutes.  I'm so glad I tried this.  
 
I also tried adding more crushed crackers.  Good either way.

Great recipe. Just as Andy who grew up in Lancaster Co. PA, this was a staple in my home growing up. Love it, and was happy to find this recipe.

I was intrigued by the saltine crackers.  I followed directions but mine came out a bit thick.  I think final cooking time probably needs to be reduced to about 3 minutes.  Iâ€™m not sure how much the egg whites add to this recipe but this was a pain to me.  Next time I will simplify and  just use the whole egg in the first step.  Also make sure to crush your saltines finely.  I had chunks of saltine in my pudding and it just tasted odd.

Very good recipe!  I followed it exactly as written.  To give an idea of how much 6 servings makes, I poured the pudding in a 7x11 baking dish and it filled it up with less than inch to the top of the dish.
