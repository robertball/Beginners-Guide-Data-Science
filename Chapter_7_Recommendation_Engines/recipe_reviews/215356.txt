WOW!!! 
This was much different than the usual fruit-sweet and hearty green drinks.

It had a more delicate, bizarre touch to the flavors that I REALLY LIKED. 

Super healthy too, so definitely not a waste of time/ingredients. 
Great job Heidi!!!

I changed it up a bit:
Only 1/8 cup of Broccoli
No Mint (didn't have any)
Added a handful of baby spinach
Next time I would only use 1/2 a cucumber, cause that's all I could taste.

Not my cup of tea, but interesting. I felt like I wasted a good honeydew. I will try different ratios of melon to cucumber and see if that helps.

This was really refreshing. I like how it has broccoli but would like to double it next time to get more nutrients. *UPDATE* Too bitter with double broccoli.

This is a very interesting idea!  I didn't particularly care for it, but it was not repulsive by any means.  I left out the broccoli, but otherwise followed the recipe.  It's certainly refreshing; the mint helps with that as well.  Not sure I should have had it for breakfast - maybe more of an afternoon snack.

The flavor was really refreshing on a hot summer day! I substituted half of the ice cubes with almond milk I did add the broccoli and added extra grapes. Defiantly going to make this one again!

Actually I didn't have any honedew melon, so I made this with kiwi fruit.  I doubled the broccoli and still couldn't taste it, BTW I used frozen cut broccoli - partially defrosted.  Also, I had to add 1/2 C of water.  Blenders need some liquid to get the process started.  It was good
