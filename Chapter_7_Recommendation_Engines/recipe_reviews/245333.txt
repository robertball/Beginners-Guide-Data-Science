I made this exactly as it is written. The end result is more like porridge. It's very thick the next day and is lacking a touch of salt. Overall, this isn't my favorite recipe using butternut squash. The sweet notes and consistency were not appetizing.

Excellent! This soup has great flavor. Using leftover shredded chicken made this recipe really simple. I added some shredded zucchini for added color and texture.

I reduced the amount of quinoa, but it was still too thick.  The flavor was really lovely, tho.
