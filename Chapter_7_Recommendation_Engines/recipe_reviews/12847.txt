Great easy recipe, but garlic mushroom soup not easy to find.  Use mushroom soup and add some freshly crushed garlic instead.  I've substituted 8 ounces cream cheese for the mayonnaise and baked the dip in a hollowed out loaf of bread for a self contained hors d'oeuvre.  What a hit!  The hint to double the recipe right away is sooooo right!  It went so fast I didn't get any!

You have got to make this dip!!  I used Lipton garlic and herb soup mix because I couldn't find the one referenced in the recipe.  This dish takes just minutes to prepare, and tastes absolutely wonderful.  Try it!!!  You won't be disappointed.

This dip is awesome!  I had so many complements.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and substitued light cream cheese for the mayonaise.  I also used onion-mushroom soup instead of the garlic mushroom, and it turned out just fine.  Seemed to be a crowd pleaser!

Made this wonderful appetizer for Xmas Eve.  It was gone within minutes.  Planning on taking it tonight to bring in the new year.  This time, however, I'm doubling it!

This was a really quick and easy recipe!  I added soome cayenne pepper and some black pepper (and some celery salt) to kick it up a notch!  It was a big hit.  I'll definitely have to double the recipe the next time I make this.

I made this two different times/ways. The 1st way I used mayo as called for...it was SO greasy! The dip was literally floating on top of a layer of grease. I scooped it out and served it in a seperate dish and everyone still liked it but I still found it runny. The 2nd time I substituted regular cream cheese for mayo and it came out a thousand times better. I could not find garlic & mushroom soup either time, I used Lipton Onion soup mix - half pouch each time. Will be making this again - but not with mayo! I also sprinkled shredded Swiss on top in the last 5 mins of baking & it was perfectly melted.

My daughter and I were anxious to try this dip hoping to duplicate what has become one of our family's faves at restaurants for an appetizer. Unfortunately, we listened to other reviewers and used the Onion/Mushroom Soup Mix since we couldn't find the Garlic Mushroom Soup Mix. What you get is a VERY strong dry onion soup mix flavor with a touch of  artichoke dip instead of what I assume should be a "garlic crab artichoke dip" flavor. I gave this recipe 5 stars since it was my fault not being able to follow the recipe as given. I will not try this recipe again until I can find the Garlic Mushroom Soup Mix. Yes, my family ate this but I ended up throwing 75% of it away. I will keep my eyes out for the right soup mix and you should too.

I added a second can of crab because one can seems overpowered by the soup mix.  Very tasty dip even with one can of crab!

I cannot begin to say enough about this recipe!  It takes all of 5 minutes to prepare and toss in the oven so I didn't have to stay in the kitchen as my guests were arriving.  Everyone was complimenting the dish.  This one's a keeper!

I am really sorry to say that this recipe was not worth spending the money for ingredients on.  It was just too dry, and no one really liked it when I served it at a party...especially me!  There are so many wonderful crab dip recipes out there that I wouldn't spend my money on this one.

I couldn't find the garlic and mushroom soup mix, so I bought Lipton Onion Mushroom soup mix and added minced garlic.  I love crab meat, so I added 2 cans.  This was a hit on Thanksgiving as an appetizer!  Everyone was raving about it!

Like other reviewers, I could not find garlic and mushroom soup mix.  I bought onion/mushroom soup mix and added a teaspoon of minced garlic.  Next time, I will probably cut back to 1/2 tsp of minced garlic, but overall, it was a VERY good recipe and I will definitely make again.  Very easy to make, and my husband and company loved it and could not quit eating it.  They didn't think it had too much garlic, but I will try it with less next time.

Honestly, this dip had no flavor. I used cream of mushroom w/roasted garlic soup and cream cheese instead of mayo. First of all, if you use cream cheese, make sure you thaw it out before you mix all the ingredients-otherwise, there are pockets of cream cheese. After cooking for 30 minutes, most of the dip was not even warm. I cooked it longer, then had to confer with my husband to see how to make it better-tasting. We added a generous amount of garlic powder and cayenne. And then extra cayenne and some black pepper. Finally, it was edible and we ate it with pita chips. Just as good reheated the next day. But I was really disappointed with the original outcome.

This is extremely easy and excellent! I didn't have the right soup mix so I just used a vegetable soup mix so I could try the dish and it tastes great.

Delicious recipe! I added cream cheese as well, but I won't next time because it was super creamy (which was great), but it took away from the crab flavor. I couldn't find the dry soup mix, so I just added fresh chopped mushrooms and a few heavy shakes of garlic powder. 
Also, I doubled the crab and put 2 cans in instead of 1. Really glad I did. Overall, super yummy.

I won't make this again.  The soup mix overpowered the crab too much.  I may as well have used tuna fish and saved on the cash.

This dip is wonderful. Instead of using the garlic/mushroom soup (which noone can seem to find) I used Lipton Recipe Secrets Savory Herb with Garlic which flavored it perfectly. I also substituted 2 cans of chicken breast shredded for the crab. Added several good shakes of Tobassco and extra time in oven.

I made this dip for Valentine's day.  It was great!   I did make a few changes, however.  Because I couldn't find the Garlic & Mushroom soup mix, I just used minced garlic and canned mushrooms, and chopped them up in a food processor.  I also used the food processor to chop up the artichokes. Next time, I will try doubling the crab meat, because I think this recipe didn't have quite enough of it.  But it was still very, very delicious!  Better than the Crab & Artichoke dip they serve at the restaurant!

Since I did not have the garlic and mushroom soup mix I used onion and mushroom. This mix maybe too overpowering for the crab. The color was a little off so I added some breadcrumb to the top but ultimately the dip was delicious. My family loved the dip and it was easy to make with mostly cupboard items except for the canned crab. I used sharp cheddar cheese b/c that was all I had in the house. For anyone reading this review and does not have the soup mix, use half of the onion mushroom mix to start and then adjust to taste. I think you will be pleased.

This was excellent.  I made slight modifications - used half amount of artichokes, cut the mayo down by 30% and since I couldn't find garlic and mushroom mix used 3/4 of the onion and mushroom mix and added granulated garlic. Also, I forgot to buy cheese, so I threw in 1/2 cup of good grated parmesan I already had.  I kept getting compliments on it throughout the party.

My fiance' and I made this Christmas Day and absolutely loved it.  We added some Garlic powder in lieu of the dip to add a little flair.  Make sure you use fresh ingredients for this one and you'll be guarranteed to please your company!!  Oh and don't forget some fresh baked bread :)

This was really yummy.  I premixed all the ingrediants the night before and let it chill overnight in the fridge.  The flavor was absorbed by the crab but wasn't too overpowering.  It was a hit with my family of 40.

We absolutely loved this recipe!  The first time I made it, I put the whole packet of garlic and herb soup mix in, and it was really strong. My husband thought it was too strong tasting, but the second time I made it, I put half the packet in, and it disappeared in 10 minutes!  Awesome and easy! Thanks!

This is awesome. I tried it at a party & had to have the recipe.  I don't even like seafood, but it really is great.  So easy to make! I can't find the Garlic Mushroom soup mix, so I use the Onion Mushroom mix, and add 1 Tbs. of minced garlic.  the last time I made this I made it in my tiny crock pot (dip size).  Then took it to a party, and it stayed warm the whole day.  I like to serve it with Toasted crackers.

This dip was a hit! I especially liked it with toasted pitas. I coated the top of mine with a layer of Kraft parmesan cheese (shaker can style) and it helped with the browning on top. Next time will put freshly made bread crumbs on top and add artichokes for variety. A+!

I love this recipe!  I have made is a few times and it's always a hit.  I followed other reviewers advice and I swapped out the mayo and replaced it with cream cheese.  Also I don't use canned crab meat, I use the imitation flake kind and that gives it a much better crab taste.  Delicious!

Very good and easy to manipulate a bit.  I used cream of chicken soup since I forgot to buy the mix, and just added some garlic powder and onion flakes.  It was very good and was eaten right up!

Like many, I could not find the garlic mushroom soup.  I substituted 3/4 of a pack of onion mushroom soup and added garlic as suggested by a member.  I really didn't care for it.  The onion was overpowering.  Perhaps with the recommended soup it would taste better.  I felt the crab and artichoke were overshadowed by the soup mix.

This was just o.k for me.  The soup mix seemed to overpower the dip.  But people did seem to like it though.  If I was to make it again, I would add a can of sliced mushrooms to it and not so much soup mix.

Thought this was just "OK"...but everyone at the party I brought it to raved, so I'm giving it high marks.  Couldn't find the soup mix required, so subbed an herb & garlic mix, which worked out well.

I made this for Easter dinner as an appetizer. I had to use Onion-Mushroom soup mix because that was the closest I could find. I served it in a breadbowl, which is always a hit. The taste was great, the color was a bit brown which wasn't a big deal, due to the soup mix. It's a solid appetizer to please a wide variety, and it's always fun to have something with crab in it.

I used the herb and garlic soup mix (but not the whole package).  I doubled the crab, topped the whole dish with more grated swiss cheese and served with warm crusty sourdough bread.  Was wonderful!

I hate to be the only dissenter, but didn't think this was anywhere near worth the fat and calories - not to mention the cost.  The first time I served it (with garlic flavored bagel chips) my guests just picked at it (my husband said it was just okay considering how fattening it had to be).  A couple of days later, I fluffed it up and reheated the leftovers (too expensive to throw away!) and served it with tortilla chips to a new group of guests and they loved it.  It was definately much better after 2 days in the fridge. However, anything that's going to clog up MY precious arterys better taste better than this.

I would've given this a 5, but the consistency of the dip wasn't what I was accustomed to when ordering in restaurants.  Other wise, a super recipe, great taste.  Used the Lipton's Herb and Garlic mix like others suggested and the taste was awesome!  Next time, I'll probably blend it in a food processor.  Well, when I finally GET a food processor, I will!  lol  :)

I used cream cheese and sour cream as the base. Blended the artichokes then hand mixed ingredients. Added extra swiss and some parmesan. 8 oz of lump crab. (We made a half batch.)
It was pretty good. Didn't add enough garlic, but that's my doing.
It's a solid base, I'll tinker with the ingredients.

We used an Onion and Herb soup mix and fresh garlic, instead what was listed, mushroom and garlic soup mix.  It came out fantastic!  Definitely recommend!

This recipe was quick and easy. Like many reviews I couldn't find the garlic mushrooms  soup mix  so I used onion soup mix. Also in my haste I misread the recipe and used 8oz of cream cheese vs sour cream. what a great alteration! I also used a teaspoon of Spice World's roasted garlic two cans of lump crab meat vs one and topped with shaved Parmesean Cheese before baking

I modified this a bit.  I used 120z of canned crab in order to actually taste it. I used a 1/2 veggie dip seasoning pkt. and it was still way too overpowering.  Next time I will add the seasoning last and just to taste.  I threw everything in the blender for a smooth consistency and then at the end added some chunks of crab and artichoke hearts for texture.  People seemed to really like it but I thought it was just ok.

I was very disappointed with the dip.  There were too many flavors going on in this recipe.  (And I didn't even add capers as many suggested!) I made it for 25 people and it was barely touched.

This recipe was a hit and tasted great!  I used Garlic and Herb Soup Mix because I could not find Garlic and Mushroom. It was alittle watery. So next time I was thinking a little less on the sour cream and mayo and a couple extra ounces of jumbo lump crab to thicken it up.  Otherwise great recipe!

This recipe is great.  I made this for my best friend's baby shower and everyone loved it...even some of the young girls.  I served it with a variety of crackers and some of that great crusty Italian bread that were cut into small ovals.  It was a hit and will remain in my recipe repertoire.

I made this for my annual 4th of July party and only about half got eaten.  Had to throw the rest away.  Too expensive to make for something that doesn't get eaten up.  I'll stick with my Rock Bottom Asiago Cheese Dip recipe instead.  Much cheaper to make and gets devoured everytime.

This is DELICIOUS! I agree with others though, that really only about half to 3/4 of the soup mix packet is necessary. This one's a keeper though!

I also could only find the Herb and Garlic soup mix.  I also doubled the crab meat.  It turned out delicious.  I would suggest using a cracker such as Triscuits for dipping.  Even my children loved it!  This is a great recipe!

A real crowd pleaser.  I find that it's better if you double up on the crab.  It can also be made with lite mayo, etc.  Everyone we've made it for always asks for more.

Made this for a Christmas appetizer and everyone LOVED it.  I served it with pita chips that I made with a little olive oil and parmesan cheese.  Like others, I could not find the garlic and herb, etc., so I used mushroom and onion mix.  Turned out great though.
