I loved this salad. I obviously drained the oil before I tossed it. I thought it was very good. My kids loved it too.

This is- of course- based purely on personal preference.  I didn't like the combination of flavors.  A bite of fruit saturated in oil from the tuna, and italion dressing, is just not good. (And I normally LOVE fruit on my salads).  The salad tastes much better without dressing.

I was sick of my same ol' can of tuna on lettuce so I tried this and was wonderfully suprised.  The warm tuna was a nice change.  I also tried canned chicken and it was even better.

I am not a typical fan of sweet salads.  That being said I used a spicy Thai tuna to counteract the sweetness with some heat.  I also used a raspberry balsamic vinaigrette mainly for a colour contrast.  I don't know if I'll make it again, but it was fast to make!

This is a fun, fresh summer salad. I needed some inspiration for a way to use an abundance of leaf lettuce from the garden. My husband even liked it.
