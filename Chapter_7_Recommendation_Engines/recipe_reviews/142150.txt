This went over very well at the party I took it to!  It was tart, but it sat in the fridge for a little while and the extreme tartness went away.  Tastes like a lemon cheesecake ball.  I used one envelope of unsweetened kool-aid (which is less than one tablespoon of mix).  I served it with the little honey bee shaped graham crackers.  What a hit (and I didn't think it would be)!

I'm glad you are enjoying this recipe. One thing I want to mention is when I submitted this recipe my suggestion was to use something like Countrytime Lemonade mix. Not unsweetened Kool-Aid.

I was pressed for time when I made this dish, so I didn't form it into a ball--i just mixed everything together and served dip! I served it with cinnamon graham cracker sticks and garnished with lemon slices, and everyone loved it. The mixture is delicious and refreshing with just the right amount of lemon flavor. This is my new dish to bring to parties!!!!

This was a big hit when I brought it to an office party. I found it to be a little loose for rolling into a ball, maybe a little less butter or a little more sugar would stiffen it up. Also I rolled it in crushed pecans instead of graham cracker and served it with vanilla cookies. Very, very good.

I made this with pink lemonade w/ the sugar added.  It worked great.  The trick for me is to let it set up in the fridge the night before and then while cool you can form into ball or shape.  I coated w/ gram cracker crumbs and served w/ them.  The pink was a hit for a girls birthday party.

I followed the instructions exactly and ended up with a nice cheese ball to take to work. It went over very well and several people asked for the recipe. Don't panic if you taste it immediately after mixing. It is VERY tart but once it sets it has a perfect taste of lemon.

Amazing.  My husband loves lemon flavor and I do not, but I LOVED this!!  We offered it with a variety of crackers and my favorites were the big Wheat Thins OR sour cream crackers, strangely enough.  Yes, the lemon was light and what I thought were contrasting flavors were actually complementary!  Terrific recipe.

I used 1/2 TBS of lemonade mix instead of one and mixed with a squirt of real lemon juice and 1/2 tsp of lemon zest. I also replaced the bar of cream cheese with the whipped one and made it a spread. I then served with Anna's Ginger Thins which everyone loved!

YUM! Very refreshing for summertime. I used one Pink Lemonade Crystal Light packet and it was wonderful. I didn't form into a ball, just served on a platter with vanilla wafers, animal and graham crackers around it. Saves for days (if you have any left!)

Very good.  I made it but found it to be 'tart' so I increased the butter to 1/2 cup and powdered sugar to 1 cup.  My 'taste testers' liked it much better.  Overall, easy to make and take.

Delicious! I used an envelope of Crystal Light lemonade and served with nilla wafers. I also added some lemon zest, just for a litle more lemon flavor. It was great and not tart at all. Now I'm thinking of trying other flavors of Crystal Light such as Raspberry Ice. Great recipe!

For taste I would give it 5 stars but it was so soft it was more like a spread. I had to put it on the plate by spoonfuls and sprinkle the crumbs on top.

This was a little too sour for me. A Kool-aid packet has less than a tablespoon, but it probably would have been a perfect amount.   I did take it to a book club and others really loved it. Said it reminded them of Key lime pie.

I made this just as the recipe calls for, for a baby shower and it was a hit!  It was tart, which most people liked.  I think next time I will add 3/4 cups of powdered sugar.  I had read one review where they used on envelope of unsweetened Kool-Aid lemonade and that is what I used and will use again.  Simple and refreshing.  A great summer snack served with graham cracker sticks!

This was so yummy!  Very refreshing for a hot summer day.  I brought this to a meeting and it was literally gone in minutes - people were scraping the plate to get the lest remnants of cheese.  I used Countrytime lemonade.  Perfect!

Made this for a party and it was a big hit!  I added some chopped pecans and a little bit of unsweetened lemonade as well because it seemed too sweet.  I think the recipe calls for the already sweetened powder, like Country Time.  Great recipe!  I'm just about to go make some more.

very tart!!! I had to doubled the amount of sugar. I didn't use butter and I tried the 1/3 less fat cream cheese. I think because I changed the recipe a bit, my end product was more like a custard dip, but everyone liked it.

This is a little tart for my taste even with using Country Time sweetened lemonade mix so I add a little more powdered sugar.  I serve it in a dish and use it more as a dip.  My MIL loves it.

I made this for a baby shower and it was a huge hit. I used Country Time pink lemonade mix and added a drop of pink food coloring, since we knew our mom-to-be was expecting a girl. I refrigerated it overnight, but it was not quite firm enough to make a ball. I just rounded the top of it and packed on the graham crackers, and it looked great. I surrounded it with animal crackers and everyone loved it. I also tried it with some apple slices, and it makes a wonderful fruit dip! I had many requests for this recipe. Thanks for sharing!

This is incredible! Used the whipped cream cheese, only because it is easier to manipulate. Used 2 packages of Kool Aid Lemonade mix and a tad more powdered sugar, but only because I used more lemonade mix than was called for. Amazing recipe! Thanks!

I purchased something similar from an expensive home-show party, called a Key Lime Cheese Ball.  This is better!  I used unsweetened lime kool-aid (.13oz) but not the entire packet.  Maybe 2 tsp.  I didn't want it to be too strong.   This is great served with pretzels or wheat thins.   Super easy and yummy.  A big hit.

For those of you who aren't keen on lemon give this a try! Wow! It is so good :) It's incredibly creamy with just a touch of sweet lemon flavor. And definitely use pre-sweetened lemonade mix. So easy and so delicious!

Easy.  Delicious.  Party turned out to be smaller than expected and myself and a best friend consumed almost the entire thing.  Do not recommend this behavior :)

I modified just a bit by rolling the ball in crushed pecans, as I'm not a fan of graham crackers. I know this is a spring/summer treat, but it went over great as a Thanksgiving appetizer!

I loved this recipe! A little soft, so it's difficult to form, but very refreshing. Check how concentrated you lemonade mix is, I accidently used a SUPER concentrated one and had to double the recipe, it was so tart! But other than my own blunder, very good.

Pretty good-- but very tart. I used Kool Aid lemonade, but next time I may use Crystal Light lemonade flavor instead.

Yummo!  A big party hit.  I used recipe as is (well, doubled it, in fact) and it wasn't tart at all.  Tastes just like cheesecake!  It seems if you chill it on top of Nilla wafers, they turn soft and spongy like ladyfingers so I'm going to experiment with turning this into a trifle-type dessert also.  Very easy.

I made this for a cookout last summer and everyone was commenting on how good it was.  It was easy to make and quick.  Will definitely be using this recipe again.

Followed the recipe, like others said it was tart after first making it but after letting sit in the fridge it tasted great, was a big hit.
