What wierdo thought to put bananas with fish.  How genious!!!  Tasted delicious and not very hard to do. Make sure to have colorful sides because the white fish with the white banana with the white sauce makes the dish pretty white.

This has the basis of being incredible! I did it according to the recipe but put the wine in the sauce and didn't uses as much.It was great. Next time I will use Petrale sole instead of Dover, it has less water content. I will also make the sauce a little thinner, mine was super thick. I loved the bananas! I want a banana in each bite so I will add more. All in all, very tasty! We loved it!I'll do it again with the changes and may change the rating to 5 stars!

Very interesting and definately worth trying, but I don't think I'd make it a regular meal. You could definately get away with adding a lot less wine (there is a lot of liquid to drain off in the finished dish) and I think fresh cilantro would make a good addition between the fish and the banannas.

I did not care for this. The white wine was overpowering, and the bananas go all mushy when cooked - overall tasted bad with the fish.

My husband and I love anything with bananas and believe that any meal should be accompanied with one.  So this recipe caught my eye.  However, I was disappointed.  It did not have much flavor and was not what we expected at all.

I had this dish at Tio Peppe's in Baltimore turned out very simalar. I think it would be great with other types of fish as well.

i have to say, my DH and i were pleasantly surprised with this.  i had some cod out for dinner, and 2 sorry looking bananas...i had everything else on hand.  since people complained about the excessive wine flavor, i merely drizzled on the wine and lime.  the only problem i had was the bananas sliding off the fish before cooking.  so, i had to improvise and stick a couple of tooth picks to keep them steady.  very good.  thanks for the most unusual way to eat whitefish KAREN SHAVER!

I thought it was so weird I just had to try it, and actually it was pretty darn good. Although I'm not a huge fan of the directions, why don't you just describe how you're supposed to make a rue instead of saying mix flour butter and milk?? Anyway not bad at all once you figure out how you're really supposed to make it. I would make it again but perhaps with a little less wine and maybe more lime juice.

Me and my husband loved this recipe! I followed the reviews and omitted the wine. We didn't miss it at all! Next time I'll make a little more of the cream. And I use halibut instead of sole.

Was very yummy. My 4 kids and husband loved it (except the kid that doesn't like fish). I omitted the wine and it turned out perfect. Make sure you do not layer the fish in the baking dish. It is very delicate and the fillets stick together making it hard to server the fillets singly. I made it twice already. This is definitely going into the rotation of weekly dinners.

I have been searched for a similiar recipe for years. This is very close to a dish served at Tio Pepe's in Baltimore.
Thank you!

Although this dish is not disgusting in taste it isn't great either.  I won't be making this one again for my family.  I'm sure there are folks out there that would absolutely love it.

This was easy and good.  We used mahi mahi fish.  I think it might be better if the fish marinated longer in the wine and lime juice and I would have enjoyed more of the cream sauce, but still a good recipe.

Everyone was apprehensive about bananas and fish, must admit so was I, but gave it a shot and wow......a very pleasant surprise!! Not a flavor that you can guess about, but love it once you do taste it.

This dish is a nice treat and falls under the category: comfort food.  It is very satisfying and unique.  We would both agree that this will be cooked again and again.  We followed the recipe without the white wine as the bottle was polished off the night before.  Give it a shot and if you don't like it, there's always delivery.

banana and sole did not go good together. the instructions for making the sauce should be adjusted a little if you actually want the sauce to thicken, first you need to make a roux. the butter and flour should be cooked together, stirring constantly until it is a light golden brown color. Then slowly add the milk and keep stirring. I would really like this recipe if the bananas were omitted. creative though!

If you're looking for something different but tasty, this is a great recipe. Would never think to use bananas but really went well with the fish.

I liked this but it could do with little something to give it a bit of a bite, like red pepper flakes or a bit of jalapeno.

We made 1 change to this great recipe - from whole milk to almond milk, which is the only kind we use.  My wife was doubtful at first but quickly changed her mind on first bite. "It tastes like a dinner we would have in the islands."  You know what, she was right.  Well, maybe Key West too. Golly, it is good!

I made this for my hubby and followed this recipe exactly.  It reminded me of Tio Pepe's, and it was excellent.  Next time I make it though I would definitely cut the lime juice & white wine in half.  I am going to give it stars, because both my hubby and I loved it.  I have yet to find another recipe like this that taste so good.  I will be making this recipe again as it is very easy, and I have most things in my kitchen.  Thank you Karen

My husband and I use 1% milk so the sauce didn't thicken easily...I had to use an extra tablespoon of flour.... this recipe originally sounded like it might be good and I like trying new flavors together, but my husband thinks it tastes like Farina, and I wasn't a huge fan, either.

Amazing. I've made it for my family, my girlfriend, and myself. I've also used cod and flounder instead of Sole. Great recipe... easy to make on a budget (I'm a student).

The banana was way overpowering.  It was like eating hot creamy bananas.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because I thought the cream sauce was good, otherwise I would've gone with 1 star.
