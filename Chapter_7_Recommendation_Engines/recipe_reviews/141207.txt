Thanks for this hearty easy recipe. I made a few changes and it turned out great. First I sauteed a chopped onion and minced garlic with the ground beef. I used fresh carrots and frozen veg instead of canned (better texture and WAY less sodium). I didn't peel the potatoes either. No need. I added some fresh basil and dried oregano and let it simmer for a little longer so the carrots would be tender. Next time I might cook the carrots with the beef to carmelize them (AWESOME flavour enhancer). I served the soup with a grating of mozzarella on top and thick slices of russian rye bread. Very filling!

Good soup..even better the next day! A very forgiving recipe...I can see how you can change it up per your taste at the time or the ingredients you have on hand. I used ground turkey instead of beef omitted the green beans used fresh carrots and added onions and garlic. Turned out great! thanks!

This is seriously delicious. All it is missing is onion and garlic for a little bit more flavour. I added one onion and three cloves of garlic to the meat

Easy healthy & delicious! I add a dollop of sour cream on top. If I don't have the cans of tomato sauce I use chicken broth and add 2 taco seasoning packets and kidney beans to make it into a "TACO SOUP" and mmm. delicious! It's a very versatile recipe where you can add whatever veggies fresh frozen or canned and it tastes great! Add salt to taste. Cooking with onion also adds a great flavor.

My family liked this. I will make it in cooler months. I added fresh celery and 1 medium onion and used beef broth instead of water. It was very good. They guys just wanted saltines & bread!

Not a bad recipe for a quick easy meal. I use Rotel instead of the canned tomatoes to spice it up.

Good!!!!! I left out the tomato sauce added some seasoning salt garlic basil and oregano. I think it might've been a touch on the bland side without the spices but this is a keeper now!

Super easy! Added a package of dry onion soup mix and Worchestshire sauce for flavour. Used fresh veggies instead of canned. I left out the green beans and opted to add celery instead. I let this simmer for several hours to boil the potatoes down a bit and it turned out great. So yummy. Would awesome in the slow cooker too. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I love this recipe. Its very easy. I was uncertain whether I should drain the tomatoes or not but I chose not to and it turned out fine! I'll likely make this a lot. Both a fresh and canned version.

Cooked half an onion and one garlic clove with the meat. Added some oregano and basil as well. Then topped with parmesan cheese and a scoop of sour cream.

DELISH! I will definitely make this again. I used all the ingredients except for not so much water since the canned veggies etc. undrained already provided the liquid. I thew in extra spices & a cubed onion. It's all good!:-)

Made this tonight for supper and it was WONDERFUL! I used fresh carrots added minced onion some splashes of Worcester and ended up increasing the water by adding 2 extra cups near the end - wanted more broth in my soup. It was still pretty thick - might add another cup next time. Easy meal for a cold Michigan winter night and the kiddos enjoyed it too.

The whole family loved it. I did replace some of the water with vegetable stock I had on hand. I also used a variety of fresh and frozen vegetables because that is what I had on hand.

i ended up going back and adding a pound of italian seasoned ground beef because i felt it was way too much veggies and very little hamburger. flavor was good though but i also added some italian seasonings to the pot. Then topped each serving with a sprinkling of romano cheese blend. pretty good on a cold day!

Made a few changes but nothing substantial. Like others I like onion and garlic. We also like a little 'kick' so I used one 14 oz petite diced tomatoes and one can Rotel tomatoes with chiles. Rather than water I used vegetable broth. It makes a lot of soup but we finished it off in just a couple of days. It was THAT good! I had thought to freeze some for later. Do yourself a favor and try this EASY recipe if you are a soup lover. You will not be disappointed.

Great basic recipe.  We use canned mixed vege's.  Try rice instead of potatoes, crushed tomatoes and tomato soup.  Cook onions and chopped red bell pepper with your hamburger and add some garlic.  Never use water, always broth please. Almost forgot ! Add a splash of Colavita Balsamic  Vinegar for a memorable flavor !

Good base recipe, though a bit bland for my taste.  Skipped the green beans, added plenty of beef broth, smoked paprika and cayenne. Then it was truly delicious as well as hearty and satisfying.

This came out better than I thought it would! I added onion and garlic when I browned the meat and added some oregano and a little salt and pepper. I also used fresh carrots and string beans. My family loved it! And it was even better the next day!

I made it following the recipe except that I used fresh carrots instead of canned. I added a bit more liquid to compensate for not using canned. The soup was delicious! My husband even had seconds and said the recipe is a "keeper."

Very quick and easy to make.... it was loved by all that ate it. I put fresh carrot and frozen corn in it. Next time I would put more Hamburg in it. It made a good amount. Enough to feed 6-8. I froze a bowl for another day meal...... it was perfect! A hearty meal ready in minutes!
