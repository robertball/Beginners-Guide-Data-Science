In fairness to Campbell's Kitchen, as this recipe's first reviewer I'm rating it four stars even though as written I feel it only deserves three.  Reviews and star ratings are subjective and difficult to attribute, and I don't want to discourage anyone from trying this by starting it out with a mere three stars.  The soup, in my opinion is ho-hum, not much flavor or at least complexity of flavor going on.  To me it tasted like stewed tomato juice with some stuff in it (tho' the roasted peppers are definitely a nice touch) ...until I added fresh mushrooms, cooked chicken breast meat and 1-1/2 tablespoons of Penzey's Taco Seasoning!  Now we had something, and now it was a solid 4-star soup! I was tempted not to add the vinegar at the end, but did and found it definitely heightened the flavors, toned down the tomato, and gave it a little zip.  It was kind of funny that with hubs' first mouthful he remarked that there was "a flavor in here that I really like," and he could only be referring to the taco seasoning! And then HE declared it five stars!  Great base recipe with plenty of potential for creativity!

Excellent chunkier soup that has lots of flavor. I find it's better the next day.

this was easy. I didn't have red wine vinegar so used some red wine and some white wine vinegar.  about 2 Tablespoons of each. I only used 30 ounces of the broth and that was way too much. Needs another can of beans or more pasta to make a meal.
It was very good, I will make it again for sure.

I made this recipe not knowing what to expect.  It seemed too easy.  It was easy and delicious also.  I liked that I had all the ingredients on hand.  The vinegar really added a nice and interesting flavor.  I made it two days ago thinking I would have it for several days but then my son tried it and and loved it too. I am making another batch already.  Will definitely make again and again.

This turned out great!  I followed the advice of another reviewer and added mushrooms and taco seasoning.
