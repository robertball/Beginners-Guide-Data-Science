Very good and healthy. I used low sodium chicken stock (instead of vegetable) and also added salt, plus 2 TB of tomato paste, plus a good pinch of cinnamon. Might add some spinach next time. Served it with a salad and crusty bread, and I think it will taste even better reheated! Will definitely make it again.

Loved it!!!  Even my husband, who isn't always enthusiastic about anything with curry in it, really enjoyed it.  I followed the recipe almost EXACTLY, only adding 1 extra ingredient --  1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro at the end (last 15 minutes).  I started with frozen chicken breasts, and cooked it for 4 hours on high setting in my crockpot.  The chicken was not overdone.  I like spicy, and I found the seasoning, as written, to be perfect.  Be sure to add 1 tsp. black pepper (don't just give it a shake) -- gives it a nice heat without being overpowering.  Use a good quality curry powder.  Since I added my chicken breasts frozen, I started them in the broth while sauteing the onion and garlic.  Heated the canned tomatoes in the microwave before adding to crockpot to speed up the cooking.  I diced the sweet potatoes about 1/2 inch dice.  Everything was done to perfection in 4 hours (at high).  Will definitely make this again.

I made it according to the directions. And yes, it is too bland.. I will make it again but will put my own “flavor” into it.. Using less quinoa is a start & the vegetable stock was huge mistake.. looking forward to next time

This was ok but somewhat on the bland side. Also the quinoa soaked up a lot of liquid which left this too thick and dry.

Very tasty, though I used 2 scallions (in place of the standard onion), dropped the green onion down to 2 (from 5) & added 2 teaspoons of kosher rock salt after 8 hrs of cooking, as the flavour was too muted for our tastes; very hearty & healthy!

Found it a bit bland.  Will try again with much more curry (used mild), maybe some red pepper flakes, more onion and lemon.

Great flavour.  I reduced the pepper to 3/4 tsp. and still found it a bit peppery, but my husband loved it.  I also added some homemade seasoned salt to give it an extra kick.  Used yams instead of sweet potatoes and it was delicious!

I'm making this right now, but I also added in a couple of ribs of sliced celery (in 2" diagonal slices), and also some sliced celery leaves, .... since they have a lot of flavor & aroma. This also needs some chopped Italian Parsley (added near the end of cooking time), so that the flavor & aroma won't be lost while everything is cooking.  My family & I will surely enjoy this dish tonight (with my minor changes).

Enjoyed the healthyness of the dish, but it will not make it to regular rotation in our house. Taste was overall good, but a little bland. Texture of ingredients similar and mushy at end of cook time, so overall not very interesting or exciting dish. Same impression firm the wife and kids. More seasonings may help this dish.

I think I would have liked it better with yukon gold potatoes instead of sweet potatoes.  I think it also needs more seasoning as it was a little bland.

Good recipe that I will make again. I reduced quinoa to 3/4 cup based on other reviews but the full cup probably would have been fine using exact amount of liquids in recipe. I used chicken stock instead of vegetable stock.
I didn’t sauté the onions and garlic first, just threw them all in and they cooked fine.  (Don’t cut onions and sweet potato too small otherwise they cook too fast and turn to mush).
Added Garam Masala and some hot curry powder for extra flavour and heat. Added a handful of frozen peas just before serving which added nice color and bit of fresh taste.
Didn’t shred the chicken; served the breasts whole with the stew over. Very good.
Best part is there was loads of sauce left which I puréed with hand blender and we had two more meals of tasty soup.
This is a good recipe for a Weight Watchers plan also as many of the ingredients are zero points. When I built the recipe using WW calculator it came out to 5 points per serving.
Thanks for the recipe!

I made this as per the recipe. I did add some rock salt at the end after tasting it. Didn’t find it bland at all. Only problem I had was the cubed sweet potatoes weren’t cooked. Had to microwave them separately for about 7 minutes and put them back in.

This was pretty good but had a bit of a bitter aftertaste, I'm wondering if I should have soaked the quinoa? I left out the mushrooms ans used chicken broth instead of veggie broth.

I made it as written but I agree with the others that this is pretty bland. I would definitely add more spice next time. The sweet potatoes should be chopped fairly large as they disintegrate by the end of the cooking time.

Absolutely delicious. My picky daughter ate some, and I brought some to a colleague for lunch. Ate it all week and lost 4 lbs. I forgot to chop the mushrooms, which would have made them better fit with the consistency of the stew

I made this stew a couple of days ago.  It is relatively quick and easy to prepare.  I enjoyed it, however, my wife did not think it is worth doing again.  There are not enough vegetables in this stew.  I did add some green beans, and they seemed to help.  If I were to try it again, I would  add more different types of vegetables (turnip, carrots, yam), and cut them larger.  To make room for the increased vegetables in the slow cooker, the rest of the recipe would have to be modified.

Loved the flavor of this stew! I added a little more curry & a dash of cinnamon. I also added more mushrooms & used chicken broth instead of veggie. I think next time I make it I will use more chicken broth & half of the quinoa. It’s really thick. Yummy though!

This was so hearty and filling.  I loved it but it was missing something that I can't figure out.  Nevertheless, I will finish it as leftovers in the days to come which promise to be quite cold.

I changed it a little. I used a home grown chicken and tomatoes. I used brown rice instead of quinoa as I don't care for quinoa. The rest of the recipe I followed, except i baked it for two hours at 450* as I don't like slow cookers. This turned out GREAT. It will definitely be a winter favorite.

I made this dish.  While it was cooking - it smelled divine!  It was all I could do to stay out of it until it finished.

When I finally was able to taste it, I was so disappointed.  The chicken, sweet potatoes & quinoa were essentially FLAVORLESS and had a “mushy” texture.  It was not good.

will definitely make again! and I always make changes ;) I omitted the broth and added one can of water (rinsed the tomato can).  I used only 2 chicken breasts.  Very flavorful and hearty.  Mine was thick due to decreased liquid, but I really liked it that way!

I made it  and it  turned out generally good. It kind of reminded me of a hearty soup. The sweet potatoes in it made it taste more like a side dish than a main course.

Fantastic recipe, curry adds a smoothness that pairs well with the sweet potatoes, and earthiness of the mushrooms.  I did add a small dash of salt to each bowl

It turned out very bland and mushy. The quinoa soaked up all the liquid which made it mushy. 
I would not make it again.

I probably should have read the reviews before I made it, then I would have improvised with other ingredients.  IF I make it again, I'll use chicken thighs.  I used chicken breast for this but would have cut the amount in half.  Four whole breasts is two too many.  I also would use less quinoa as it  made the overall recipe too mushy in the end; no liquid left and the taste was very bland.

We enjoyed this thick stew.  Because my curry powder is very mild and one note, I added some cumin, garam masala and cayenne along with the curry powder and oregano.  I added the spices to the cooking onions so they could bloom.  I had some leftover tomato paste, so I added that also.  I would usually use chicken broth, but I had half a box of vegetable broth in the fridge, so I used half a box of each.  At the end, I added a cup of peas and a bag of baby spinach to bump up the veggie count and add some color.  Because I had made a bag of chickpeas, I added a cup and a half to the stew.  I made sure to cut my sweet potatoes quite large so they would not turn to mush. I followed the rest of the recipe as written.  Will certainly make again.

I used cracked barley instead of quinoa, and it worked fine. I would use red potatoes instead of sweet potatoes next time, I thought they were too sweet and mushy. Otherwise a great, easy recipe!

After reading the comments, I replaced the vegetable broth with strong chicken broth, substituted the tomatoes with fire roasted tomatoes salsa style and added one more tsp of curry. I also cubed the chicken breast in 1 inch cubes so the cubes would better acquire the nice broth and spice mix. It Became a very nice, spicy stew and my guests asked for the recipe.

A bit disappointed, I made as directed except used only one tsp curry powder as I think curry can sometimes be overwhelming.  Very bland so added to red pepper flakes and some garlic powder which helped a bit.  Hoping the flavors meld better as it made a lot so have two more dinners in the future.

I will definitely make this again! I substituted 1/2 C of the quinoa with 1/2 C wild rice and only one sweet potato was used. The pinch of cinnamon works well as does reducing the amount of black pepper by half. I did however offer Chalula Hot Sauce on the side for those of us who prefer more heat. All were happy with the final product.

I made this and used chicken broth instead of veggie broth. I love mushrooms so I used a whole container of fresh mushrooms. This recipe is definitely not plain or bland...we all have different taste.  Be sure to use fresh cumin and season to your taste.  We ate it the first time as a stew with a good French bread on the side. The second time we put it over basmati rice. Excellent. I will keep this in my winter meal schedule. It’s great comfort food.

Would use twice the number of mushrooms and maybe a zucchini. I’d rather increase the vegetables and reduce the carbs. Could substitute beans for chicken

I made this merely on the coincidence that I had all of the ingredients on hand! It is pretty tasty, hearty, and healthy, I omitted the chicken to make it vegan/vegetarian friendly.
