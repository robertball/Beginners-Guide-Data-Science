My husband and I love our local Chinese Buffets Black Pepper Chicken.  We have tried to duplicate it but with no luck.  When I saw this recipe I thought I'd give it a shot.  WoW!! It was very close.  I did make some changes.  I used chicken breasts and I marinated them 4 hours.  Instead of deep frying them I first cut them into bite size pieces and then sauteed them in about 1/2 cup of veg. oil.  After they were close to done I drained the oil and added the marinade, some water chestnuts and some rather large slices of onion (that is how it is done at the buffet). I  thicked the sauce with Wondra.  I will use this recipe again and again.  Thanks!

I was disappointed in this recipie's instructions. They were okay deep fried, but they weren't spectacular. When the wings are deep fried, they lose any sort of flavor they were marinated in. I did throw a couple in the oven to bake after I didn't like them fried, and those were good. I'd like to throw them on the grill too. I'm sure they'd be good that way as well. Fried just doesn't work with this recipie, all the good bits of onion, garlic, and ginger fall off when stuck in a pot of oil.

The flavor of this marinade is really good - too bad it gets fried to smithereens. I made the wings as directed, but agree with others that these should be baked in order to keep the flavor. By the time my wings were done, the marinade had gotten kinda "burny" looking and tasting. They are still good - but I think they could be great if they were cooked differently. Thanks!

These wings were very oily and lost all the flavor that the marinade gave them. Next time, I will bake them so they can keep the flavor. I'm sure they would taste a lot better that way.

As others have said, when fried seemed that wings lost taste and  the only thing soakng did was help turn wings a very deep dark brown. Another one gone bad.

If the flavor is burning away, the oil must be too hot. Let the oil cool down.
