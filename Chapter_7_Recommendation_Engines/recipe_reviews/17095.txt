Very nice recipe, however I did make some changes. First, I was running low on brown sugar, so I used 3/4 cup brown, and 3/4 cup white. Then, I added WAY more coco powder then called for. (Probably about 1/2 cup) It turned our great! SOOOO chocolatly and rich. It was great just like that. Didn't even need any icing. :)

This is a great recipe.  I substituted applesauce for the butter and added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 extra Tablespoon of cocoa powder.  It turned out moist and flavorful with a unique texture.

This cake was moist, fluffy, and even a bit chewy because of the oatmeal. The consistency was excellent, but unfortunately there wasn't much favor!

I'm surprised at how good this one turned out. I did not have a square pan, so I used a round instead. Since I was taking it to a potluck, I frosted it lightly as well. It was a hit.

Great cake! I brought some to work and everyone liked it. It's very moist and so easy to make! It could be topped with whipped cream, fruit or frosting if you'd like. I don't think it needs anything.

DELICIOUS!! If your cake turns out with not enough flavor, switch to a different baking cocoa! I used Ghiradelli and it was absolutely full of chocolate flavor! Also remember that this recipe is lower in calories........... Never use cheap chocolate for baking. That's my opinion - saved at the wrong place.

A wonderfully easy and delicious standby cake.  I used very hot leftover coffee instead of water.  I'll make this often.

Nice cake, quick to make. Fairly crumbly. 
I can just imagine how nice it would be it with some raspberry jam in the middle! 
I also think it's important to let the oats soak thoroughly as some of mine ended up at the bottom. 
Will try it with apple sauce (instead of using oil, or for half the oil) next time, now that I know what it is supposed to be like as per the recipe.

Delicious! Lovely flavour and very light and moreish. I cooked mine in a 2lb loaf tin and it rose beautifully. It really doesn't need icing it's so moist.

I did make some adjustments like using applesauce for the butter, adding an additional T. of cocoa, and 1/2 t. of cinnamon.  I thought the cake had a nice flavor, but wasn't expecting it to be so "chewy".  This is the first time I have used oatmeal in a cake.  Thanks for the recipe.

SERIOUSLY the best cake ever! I used 1/2 cup Cocoa powder and 2 tsp of vanilla instead of 1. The flavor and texture was amazing! So moist and chewy. LOVED the oatmeal in it - it gives it the best texture. I made a Chocolate Ganache to go on top and it was great. My husband who doesn't eat chocolate or dessert had two pieces saying it was by far the best chocolate cake I have ever made! I will be using this recipe again and again for a long time!

Delicious! Moist and easy. I used 1/4 cup apple sauce 1/4 butter, 1 egg 1 egg white, and subbed splenda for half of the sugar. I also used 1/2 cup of cocoa. I didn't add frosting, but cream cheese frosting would be delicious!

I made this cake yesterday. I added an extra tablespoon of cocoa powder and still found that the cake didnt have enough flavour. If it was more chocolately it would have been a really nice cake. I will try making it again adding more cocoa and maybe choc chips. UPDATE.. Made cake again using 4 tablespoons plus half cup of cocoa powder and added 1 tsp on cinnamon. I also swapped the butter for applesauce. YUM. Will make again.

Great Recipe.  Always turns out super moist.  I usually don't ice mine and have it as a snack cake but have used a chocolate butter cream as well that worked.  I need to try and cut the butter some and use applesauce to lessen the calorie count next time...

As one of the reviewers suggested, I substituted applesauce for the oil.  Coupled with the oatmeal, the result was one heavy cake--very dense.  If I make this again I'll go for the fat and add the oil.

I had very limited baking supplies in the cupboard, and this cake met all of my search requirements. Given that fact, this cake was excellent! The oatmeal gave it a different texture, but it was a welcome one. Some of the kids wouldn't touch it when I said it had oatmeal in it, but once they did a taste test, they ended up really enjoying it. I didn't tell the adults about the secret ingredient, and only one person guessed it was oatmeal. Since the recipe didn't specify between slow cooked oats or instant oats, I used the instant oats in my cupboard, and it turned out fantastic. It almost dissolved the oats -- I can't figure out why no one could really taste the oatmeal! I added a teaspoon of cinnamon, as suggested, and it gave a wonderful flavor. I had to use Ener-G egg replacement instead of the two eggs because of my son's allergy. I also used an extra teaspoon of cocoa. Wonderful cake! Why only four stars? Because I probably wouldn't bake it again unless I had limited ingredients in the house, plus the standard store-bought frosting made it just okay, and it definitely needs a topping, but I'm not sure what kind would make it fabulous.

Chocolatey (used about 1/2 cup cocoa) and yummy.  Feels a little good for you too - used about 1/3 cup applesauce in place of 1/3 cup of butter and added butter to make the difference to equal 1/2 cup.  Thanks for sharing.

Not sure what happened here, but the texture of this cake was very crumbly, it basically fell apart when I tried to turn it out of the pan. Some reviews also comment on the blandness of the cake; it needs more cocoa, about twice as much or more will solve that problem.  The flavour was good (with the additional cocoa) I may play around with it a bit to get the texture right; or look for another recipe.

Yummy cake. It's not too sweet and the oatmeal gives it a nice texture. I didn't have luck with one 8x8 pan - I had burned cake all over my oven. I'm baking it in a 13x8 now - we'll see how it turns out. I also dusted the pan with cocoa. Next time I'll try it with applesauce instead of butter.

Wonderful cake. Very thick & heavy. I topped it with the Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Frosting found on this site, plus strawberries. The frosting adds a rich & flavorful taste. I would definitely make it again - and always with a sweeter frosting.

So delicious! I've made this cake twice now, and am more and more impressed with it. It is fluffy and delicious, but feels hearty and moist because of the oatmeal. I love making it, and it disappears fast! I've done it with a cream cheese frosting, but also without. Bookmark this recipe! You won't be sorry!

I used applesauce instead of butter, and 1/2 C cocoa. I can't imagine it without the extra cocoa. The texture was interesting, so if you're looking for something tasty but a bit different, definitely try this cake. I don't think it needs frosting at all. It was tasty without it.

My mother-in-law had just told me that her mom used to make cake with the leftover breakfast cereal (oatmeal, cream of wheat, etc) so I went hunting.  I used half applesauce /half butter and more cocoa (I think 1/2 c as suggested). The cake was moist and sweet without being chocolate-y.  I topped with the whipped cream recipe from the site.  My MIL loved it - she ate it for breakfast!

We didn't really like the texture of this cake.  I guess we just don't like cakes with soaked oatmeal.  It also didn't have much chocolate flavor.  I'd prefer a good oatmeal cake with coconut broiled topping or a good chocolate cake.  This cake doesn't have enough flavor of either.

A pretty tasteless cake!  The texture was alright and pretty fine even though I sub 1/4 with wholemeal flour, but it tastes REALLY bland.  Will not make this again, its a real disappointment.

I thought this cake was excellent.  I made it exactly per the recipe.  Almost tasted like a brownie, without the flaky top.  Very good with whipped cream or ice cream on top.  Everyone loved it!

For less caloric intake I used coconut oil in place of the butter, whole wheat flour, and only 1 cup of brown sugar. It still tasted sweet and I felt less guilty about it! Delicious recipe.

I've made this as-is and thought it was just ok. I actually hybridized this recipe and the BC Oatmeal Applesauce Cake recipe and it is fantastic!! 1 full cup oatmeal, 3/4-1 cup applesauce and enough apple juice to measure 1 and 1/4 cup liquid, 1/4 cup chocolate syrup, and a full 1/2 cup cocoa powder and then the rest of the listed flour, baking soda, eggs, butter, etc listed in this recipe.
Sometimes I top with nuts or chocolate icing, sometimes I leave it plain.

Very good, I read the reviews, but did not have applesauce, so I used two mashed banana's in place of the butter.  I also added the extra vanilla and cinnamon that everyone mentioned.  I used coconut oil to grease the pan.  I was looking for a coconut topping to bake on top.  Next time.  I will make it again.

Good tasting recipe.  Easy to prepare and the results were yummy.  My results tasted more like brownie than cake.  Not complaining, just stating.  Everyone still cobbled it up!

I tried this recipe and it was just okay, I will not being making this again because it had no taste. I did not mind the chewy taste of the oatmeal because I love it, but when adding the chocolate it did not help with the taste and I added cinnamon and I think for that 1/2 cup of butter may have taken the taste away, to much. but it was just okay.

I topped this cake with cream cheese frosting and it was awesome. The cake was dense and chocolaty with chewy oatmeal bits and the frosting balanced it perfectly! Everyone in my family liked it and it was gone in a day!

Very moist, enjoyed by the whole family.  It doesn't have a ton of chocolate flavor, but still good with some whipped cream on top.  I did add extra cocoa.
