I'm looking forward to making this salad with black-eyed peas/beans. I make a standard bean salad that is almost identical to this one. Kernel corn really dresses up the salad in addition to the red pimentos - yummy AND pretty. Instead of worchestershire sauce I add a 'shot' of balsamic vinegar and give the salad some zing with finely sliced/chopped red onion that I soak first in cold water and then squeeze out liquid. This technique is great for sweeting the red onion. Thanks for the recipe!!

I have made black eyed pea salads in the past that had a lot more ingredients and weren't nearly as tasty as this one. I can't wait to give this one a try in the summer when I can use leftover corn on the cob in place of frozen corn. The dressing definitely MUST sit for several hours I tasted it two hours after making it and feared for the worst. After four hours it tasted delicious and gets better as it sits.

This recipe is great. It's not heavy or too spicey. I'd like to try it with Balsamic vinegar instead of Apple Cidar vinegar. I have already passed this on to family and friends.

Yummy!!! This was really good! I didn't have pimento peppers - the jar in the store was more than I would ever use so I used a small jar of rosted red peppers and that tasted really good.. excellent recipe - will be making it again soon!

Was very good. I used a 12 oz. bag of frozen mixed veggies steamed (corn carrots & asparagus). Delicious.

I made this for a Christmas potluck so replaced the red pimento with one red and one green pepper chopped. It was a bit too sweet for my liking so I increased the Worcestershire sauce added about a tablespoon of salt (used a clove of fresh garlic in place of the garlic salt) ground lots of black pepper and added half a teaspoon of crushed red chillies

This is my new favorite summer side dish! I made it to go with barbecue and it was a big hit. I used 2 cans of black eyed peas and substituted roasted red peppers for pimentos otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

Everyone in the family loved it except my husband. Even my vegetable hating daughter. Didn't change a thing. Well definitely make this again.

Great stuff! I used a little less corn (not much of a corn fan but it's a beautiful contrast) omitted the optional celery (ICK) and substituted fresh green onions from my garden. You can't get much better than this for a side dish! A little spicy - but that's the way I like it!:D

Easy flavorful and healthy. It makes for a good side dish in itself or a salad topping on greens.

Awesome flavors! I love a tasty marinated salad and this one hits the spot. Love the crunch of the celery and onions.  I let it marinate overnight.
