I have been making these cookies since 2000, and every year, they are my biggest request.  My family literally beg me to make them.  The cookies are simple, but combined with the flavorful frosting filling, are absolutely spectactular!  I've made them multiple ways, using either butter or margarine, rum or rum extract in the filling, ditto for the cookie base, and they turn out very good with any combination.  I fill these with a pastry bag and star tip - very cute if I do say so myself :)  Using real butter (& pastry bag), the filling does get very soft if your hands (or home) are hot, so I just stick the bag in the fridge for a while.  I have never had a problem with the frosting "not setting up".  Try them - you'll be glad you did!

Very good cookie!!  It's true - it's not very colorful, but the taste was wonderful!  If you're having trouble spooning the filling into the cookie, use a decorating tube, or a plastic sandwich bag with a courner snipped out.  I had no trouble with the spoon - and no trouble getting my co-workers to eat them, too!  Lots of compliments!  I'm a bit confused that a previous reveiwer had runny filling...with the given ingredients in the correct amounts, it shouldn't have happened.  I'm curious as to what they did to make it "runny"!

One thing I was particularly impressed with...whenever a cookie recipe calls for filling such as this, there ends up being either way to much filling, or not enough.  This turned out to have EXACTLY the amount needed - no more, no less!  How cool is that? :)
These would also be excellent to package up and send through the mail.

I have been searching for the perfect egg nog cookie recipe for 6 years... and I this is by far my favorite.  I have made 2 batches.  The dough comes out beautifully.  I think next time I make it I will use rum flavoring instead of the vanilla flavoring in the cookie. I did mix the flour in with my KitchenAid on Stir, and baked on parchment paper, and they baked beautifully.  I did modify the filling recipe a little.  I used 2 tsp. rum flavoring, 2 tsp milk, and 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg, (probably an extra tsp of powdered sugar as well).  It makes this frosting taste just like egg nog.  So delish!  This recipe has won a place in my annual holiday "must have" cookies.

The frosting makes the cookie on this one. Be sure to follow the recipe and let the cookies cool completely before frosting or your buttery frosting will melt!  Oh, and PS, I only got 30 cookies out of this.  Thanks, Susan!

WOW!  I almost didn't try this recipe after reading some of the unfavorable reviews, but I am SO glad I tried it.  A couple of things that maybe would have tripped me up might be helpful to others:  in step 2 you need to mix the flour in by hand.  I was buzzing away with my hand mixer when I caught myself!  Definitely make into one inch balls.  I thought they were too small, but I was still just shy of yield.  I used the end of a wooden spoon to make the indentations, so I wouldn't have to use as much frosting.  Lastly, under step 4, mix the ingredients by hand.  I started off with my mixer (again) and had to stop myself.  Maybe that's why some cooks had runny frosting?  So delicious - definitely a keeper!

This is the second year I have made these for my Christmas trays and we love them. The food editor at the Las Vegas Journal requested a special Christmas cookie to feature and this one immediately came to mind. I will be delivering them to the newspaper tomorrow ad I think they will agree with our review :) After reading some poor reviews, I have some thoughts on what might have gone wrong. Burnt bottoms....oven is running too hot. My oven runs hot so I adjust my temp down. Hard or tough cookie....Over worked dough. You are supposed to cream the butter and sugar and then stir the flour in by hand. Overmixing would produce a very tough cookie. Dry....baked too long. My cookies were done at 11 minutes. Runny frosting....too much rum or not enough sugar or maybe melted butter? With these simple tips, you will experience success. Enjoy!

Wow!  I just tried one of these and they are amazing!  I used a full teaspoon of vanilla but followed as directed otherwise. Used the end of a wooden spoon to make indentation and baked on parchment paper. The icing is lip smacking good! I used Captain Morgan which is a spiced rum and I think it worked very well here. Very festive.

I am sort of on the fence about these cookies. Like some others, my main problem is with the cookie base. They turn out too dense--not tender enough for my liking. I think I would look for another sugar cookie recipe to substitute. Also, they are homely-looking specimens. Perhaps rolling them in crushed nuts before baking? I only got 30 cookies from this recipe, but I still needed to double the frosting. Also, it came out very thick, so I brought it to the right consistency with a couple of teaspoons of actual eggnog. Finally, though I did not add extra rum as others did, I still found the resulting cookies very boozy! I felt weird giving them to neighbors with children. So I might cut back or use rum extract next time. With some tweaking, this recipe could be a fine addition to your holiday cookie trays and exchanges.

I made some of these to bring to a Christmas party and to work.  People at both ends raved about them!  They really do taste like eggnog and the "filling" (more like frosting really) has a great texture.  I didn't want to use real rum so I used 1/4 tsp rum extract and 1 tbs water.  I was worried about them sitting out if I used milk as suggested.  The frosting was still creamy and great, I don't think milk would have made a big difference.  Also you cannot use a rounded tsp of frosting on each cookie which is obvious when you see them baked.  Just eyeball a small dollop large enough to almost fill the thumb indention and it works out well.  These are excellent and highly recommended!

This is an excellent cookie.  It was this year's favorite among everyone.  The filling really does taste like eggnog with the rum and the nutmeg.  Noone thought the rum was overpowering. The cookies were very pretty to boot.  Try this one!

These cookies are AMAZING!! They're really easy and they really do taste like eggnog. At first, the rum flavor will be strong (you can always use rum flavoring for the non-alcoholic types) but give them a day and they mellow to this absolutely addictive concoction that is really hard to resist. Just watch the kids after these things have mellowed. Our little relatives went nuts for these...well, so did the big ones!

I must have made mine too big as I only got 2 dozen out of this batch. I uses my Pampered Chef scoop which is not as messy as rolling them by hand and it guarantees the same size cookie every time. I put Jamaican spiced rum in the frosting and they are very tasty. I will definately be making more because I'm sure these will be gone before Christmas!

I LOVE these cookies! They're delicious and cute :) they went really nice with the other cookies to add variety for my holiday mix. I only made one small change (as many others had) I used 1tsp rum extract and 2tsp water in the filling. I'll make these again, maybe even tonight :)

Bake for only 12 minutes even though they don't look cooked.  I let them bake longer because they still lokked soft and when they cooled they were hard as rocks.  Also I think the dough could be less sweet because the frosting is so intense.  I would try them again using white sugar and less of it. Nice eggnog flavor.

I have made these several times now. It is my families most requested cookie no matter what time of year it is. They are simple to make and taste incredible. I don't find the cookies bland as other reviewers have reported. In fact, it's all I can do to keep my hubby away from them before the frosting is ready. We are very happy with these cookies. Any time we have a party, or cookie exchange these are what I make, & they are always a BIG HIT!

I really enjoyed these cookies. The cookie itself was very tender and crumbly, which I enjoyed. Make sure to mix in the flour by hand. The dough should be rather dry and crumbly. If you have one solid ball of dough, your cookies are over-mixed. I used a melon baller to get the correct size and made the indentation with a wooden spoon handle. If the cookie starts to come apart, press it gently back together. The only reason I gave this recipe 4 stars was because I feel it needs a stronger rum flavor. Next time I will use rum extract because I can increase the flavor without significantly increasing the liquid. The icing, mixed by hand and stuffed in a piping bag, was the perfect consistency, nowhere near runny. Runny icing is an error on the part of the cook, not the recipe. I can't wait to make these again.

This is my new favorite holiday cookie. I admit I am an eggnog fanatic, including eggnog lattes. I made these as per the recipe. They are easy and delicious. As for the color, not so much. I may add red and green food color to the icing next year.

I'm glad I finally made these. I had trouble with my cookies spreading so I made them into 1tsp "bites" instead. I added nutmeg to the dough, and a little extra to the icing. To keep the icing from dripping off the top of the cookie, I made it thicker, and dipped chilled cookies into it. Very tasty!

I'm not as impressed with these cookies as other people seem to be.  The cookies themselves have a nice texture, but don't overcook them!  They get very dry if you let them get even the slightest bit brown on the bottom.  As for the taste, they're pretty bland.  I'd say they're just a vehicle for the icing, which doesn't taste very much like eggnog.  Maybe it was because I didn't use real rum, I don't know.  In fact, I used about 1 1/4 teaspoon of rum extract, as opposed to the 1/4 teaspoon called for, and it still didn't have the taste I was looking for.  And it's too bad the icing didn't set up firmly.  But what did I expect with all that butter in there?  If I make these again I'll try spicing the dough up some, and using less butter in the icing.

I made the dough as directed. The only thing I did was instead of milk I used eggnog and spiced rum and I mixed the nutmeg in with the frosting and on top. My boyfriend loves them . I think I will add rum to the dough as mentioned earlier

These will be the traditional Christmas cookie for many, many, many holidays to come :] I would have never guessed that a hint of rum added to some butter and confectioners' sugar could be so delicious and taste so much like egg nog! This is one fantastic cookie :]

OMG I had to make these twice in 2 days because they were such a hit. I used overproof Jamaican rum (blame the padres for that one) I dunno if I made them too big, but the batches only made about 24 cookies, which were gone in my family by the end of the night. Either way, was told that I should sell the recipe to a Jamaican restaurant. I wont steal your amazing idea though seriously Im making these every year for Christmas, or like an event where i can make them! Best recipe Ive found on here!!

I'm not sure why my cookies came out too sweet and too hard and I don't think they taste much like egg nog.  The only difference I made in the recipe is that I didn't have nutmeg, so I substituted pumpkin pie spice.  I can't think what I would do differently to improve this recipe.  I would never make it again.  Difficult to store, too, with the frosting on top.

God flavor but I must have done something wrong.   Mine came out flat, not with a dent in the middle.  Even tried chilling the dough.  More flour?  Use shortening instead of butter?

These cookies are DELICIOUS and easy to make! I made only a 1/2 batch to try them out, and will definitely be adding this to my Christmas baking list. The cookie all by itself is a great texture and taste, I will use this cookie as a base for future thumbprint recipes.

I did add a little bit more rum than the recipe called for and sprinkled a fair amount of nutmeg over the finished cookie (I'm sure it would be considered more than a 'pinch') and it was fantastic. The extra rum isn't necessary, but I wanted a strong rum flavor. YUM YUM!!

I colored the filling with yellow food coloring and sprinkled with white snowflake sprinkles.  I also added extra rum extract for some added kick.  A great addition to my Holiday cookies. I will make this again.

Not very attractive. It seems like the dough balls should be rolled in nuts? The frosting and nutmeg make them delicious, though.

This cookie was DELICIOUS - we made it for our annual cookie bake this year, and this is definitely going to become a staple.  EVERYONE in our family loved these cookies.  We used a pastry bag for the filling and it worked wonderfully and made the cookies look even more beautiful.

These were great, and to bring out the eggnog flavor even more, I added 1/2 tsp rum extract and 1/4 tsp nutmeg right into the batter.  I melted the butter for the icing, but made it a little to far ahead and it firmed up by the time I was ready to top the cookies with it.  So I added a Tbs water, and it was workable then.  Yum!

This is one of the best Christmas cookies I've ever made, and trust me, I've made MANY. Here are my recommendations.
-DO use the rum extract; it's the key to making this an *eggnog* cookie. Without it - meh. Nondescript.
-DO NOT add other "stuff" like nuts to this cookie, or again, it ceases to be eggnog-y.
-Don't skimp on the nutmeg. It's a lovely and necessary flavor accent. (But, I sprinkle it on while they're on wax paper & then transfer to the serving plate, so the mess isn't all over the plate.)

The cookie by itself isn't super sweet, and that's by design - it's meant to merely complement the filling's more intense. If you find the finished product bland, you're not using enough filling and/or nutmeg. If you find it overwhelming, you're using too much. Practice and learn the ratio. When you've got it down, it's a perfect balance. 

After a few years of tinkering, I like to make the cookies smaller, with a more narrow but deeper indentation. (I also use my knuckle to make them, not thumb; more uniform & efficient for me.) It becomes an "amuse-bouche" kind of thing, with all the flavor of a mug of eggnog in one delicious bite. 

I once made these cookies for my local newspaper's cookie contest - and won! It's become a family & friends favorite. Everyone loves to see me coming with a plate of these. Plus they're easy to make, so they relieve my holiday stress rather than adding to it, and that can be a game-changer!

I did make changes and I am "on the fence" about these cookies as another 3 star commenter said.  Pretty much,  my comments are like Joy Bugaloo's.

Also, the pics are not realistic.  What are those 'red ribbon' looking additions on the frosting?  My nutmeg certainly did  not look like that.  I am very disappointed and I would not recommend this recipe to anyone.  Sorry :(

Awesome recipe.  Delicious cookies!  The rum in the icing was awesome. I doubled the recipe and made the half I was taking to church with maple in them and the half that was for us with rum.  Both delicious.  I was only able to get about 2 1/2 dozen out of the recipe. for sharing!  Chris

This is a really different flavored cookie, but the kind that it was hard to eat just one.  The nutmeg sprinkled on the top really helped it all go together.  Easy to make.  I didn't have anything fancy to pipe out the frosting, so I took a baggie, sandwich sized, and clipped a corner and used that to help make the frosting look prettier.  It worked pretty well.  Looking forward to Christmas next year so I can make them again!

I LOVE this recipe.  I have never had a recipe that is so universally loved and one that I am constantly asked to share. I do find the dough the most temperamental- Don't melt the butter, just soften it (and add a little nutmeg to it.)  I also often substitute more rum in the dough instead of vanilla.
I use spiced rum in mine which turns out great (and I don't worry too much about adding more!)

Best cookies ever. Made as written with 151 Bacardi Rum. Amazing. I had no problem with the frosting being runny. If anything, it was too thick and I live in a humid place.

Pretty good.  Used them as one of my Christmas cookies.  They weren't my favorite so I'll probably just try something else next year.  Can also use a different filling like melted chocolate in the indentation so it's versatile! Update 12/15/15 - Can't get the center to firm up unless in fridge.  Chocolate worked better.  Still not my faves.  Maybe time to abandon!

The frosting on these was delicious, but I had the same problems some others did: the cookies were very hard.  Not pleasantly crispy -- hard.  I left them in for 12 minutes, and they certainly looked fine, just slightly golden.  I did allow them to cool completely on the cookie sheets (I was doing too much holiday-baking multitasking), which I'm sure didn't help, but there are enough more foolproof sugar cookie recipes in the world that in the future I'll use one of them with this frosting.

awesome awesome awesome. My family couldn't get enough of these. I used a pastry bag with a large plain tip. It made the frosting application super slick.

The cookie itself is good, but the filling doesn't taste like eggnog at all. If I ever make them again, I'll definitely try using a different type of rum.

This recipe came out fairly delicious, but I feel like it could be improved... the cookies were too sweet and rose too much for the thumbprint to allow these cookies to be filled (i basically frosted them). I feel like a more short-bread like traditional thumbread cookie might've been better. I LOVED the filling though, mmmm, and overall these cookies were delish

Really good.  They have a nice soft texture, the cookie itself doesn't have much flavor so the frosting is key.  They spread more than i expected, next time i'll chill the dough before baking, and maybe add some nutmeg to dough for a little extra flavor.
**UPDATE**
For people having trouble w/ the cookie flattening: the second time i made these i added 1/4Cup extra flour, and put the baking sheet in the fridge after rolling and pressing the thumbprint.  Handling the dough may melt your butter, and melted butter = flat cookie.  Extra flour and chilling is key!

I made a couple of alterations to this recipe. I added about 3/4 t. nutmeg to the dough which made a nice buttery cookie with an eggnog kick. I didn't care for the icing but I also didn't have rum or extract. I think that the dough with the nutmeg and a simple water, powdered sugar icing would be great. I'll be making these again for sure.

This was a good cookie recipe. Making it though I did make some changes I felt the cookie needed. Since the dough did not have any eggnog ingredients and just the frosting, I added nutmeg to the cookie and next time would probably add rum extract as well. I think those changes would make this a great cookie!

My dough seemed soft and the cookies didn't hold the thumbprint very well.  I used 2 tsp. of rum extract and a little cream for the icing since I didn't have any rum, and I used a pastry bag with a star tip to put it on the cookies.  I thought that would be a quick and easy way.  The taste of these remind me of a nutmeg log cookie I used to make years ago but these are easier to make.  If you like eggnog you'll like these!
July, 2019--These won third place in the miscellaneous cookie division of the Salem,  VA fair.

These cookies are really good.  I doubled the recipe and as a reviewer suggested added rum extract and nutmeg to the batter. I did use Captain Morgan Spiced Rum (2 1/2 tablespoons) in the frosting.  Sprinkled with the nutmeg as stated in the recipe. Turned out beautiful.   Will give as Christmas gifts along with all the great cookies I made from this site. Thanks Susan.

These cookies turned out perfect!! I used 1/4 t of rum extract, instead of rum, and they just taste wonderful.  I had to bake them for longer then 12 min, but I probably made them huge because I only got 30 cookies out of the dough.  I will make these again at Christmas and may add some red or green food coloring to the frosting.

Kinda a bland little cookie with super-sweet frosting.  As with other reviewers, I used milk and rum extract to flavor the icing and wonder if real rum would have made a difference.  Also, if I made these again I'd double the recipe - I only got about 20-24 cookies the way it's written.  Overall, an all right cookie, but I don't think I'd make them again.

I have made this two years in a row, and I always receive rave reviews.  I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup of shortening.  I also used rum flavoring instead of the vanilla.  Great taste.

I have this recipe in a Christmas cookie cookbook and tried it the first time this year, I think they're delicious and will be whipping up a second batch tonight. Hint: I do cheat a little and use my cookie scoop instead of rolling into balls.

I found this recipe in the Allrecipes cookbook and used it for a cookie exchange.  It was easy to do, with few ingredients and made quite a few dozen at a time.  Everyone loved the taste and my husband didn't believe me when I told him there wasn't any eggnog in the recipe.  Wonderful Recipe.

Simple and yummy!  I made these for a cookie exchange and they were a hit with both friends and family.  Even the kids can help (with the thumb print part).  I've found a new Christmas cookie tradition.

My husband and I love eggnog, but neither of us were impressed with these cookies. The cookie part was a little too dense and firm for my taste, probably because of the lack of baking soda or powder in the recipe. I prefer a soft cookie. The frosting part is good, but doesn't make a very good presentation if just spooned into the cookie, as suggested. I took these to a Christmas Party on a tray with other homemade cookies, and these were the only ones still left over at the end. I will not make these again.

I participated in a cookie exchange this past weekend, and these were the hit of the party!  They did turn some people off, because of the name, and people said that they didn't like eggnog much--but I convinced them to try them, and once they did, they were hooked!  Very easy to make--I made 15 dozen of these babies in 2 hours!!!

I can’t believe it’s taken me so long to review this! My sons request these cookies every year. I double the frosting and use rum extract instead of the real stuff. Sometimes it takes a second for the frosting to come together. If you think you need to, add a splash of cream or half and half. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I made these this year. I skipped the rum and Added more  nutmeg. The icing never set up. Maybe next time I will try less butter in the icing.  I thought the cookies were delicious  and will make then annually.

Unlike most reviewers, I actually liked the cookie better than the frosting! It was dense and overbaked in my oven, but it had a delicious shortbread flavor. I didn't think the frosting was anything special and together they certainly did not taste like eggnog to me. Will not make again.

Used rum extract;  it didn’t really have enough eggnog taste.  The cookie base was quite good, so I may try that part with another filling, ex. jam or butter tart filling.

My favorite for three years running. They can be fairly rich depending on how much "frosting" you put on. Add spices to the dough and use a piping bag so they're pretty.

These cookies were a hit with my family! I followed the recipe exactly as written although I did add a dash of nutmeg to the cookie dough for more flavor. I used Irish butter for the frosting and I think it gave a richer flavor. I too used a piping bag for the frosting and refrigerated the frosting while the cookies cooled.

These are my favorite cookies!  I have made them several times now, following the recipe exactly.  The cookies are plain, but the frosting is very sweet and has a great flavor.  I usually top them with crushed candy canes for additional flavor (and color).  Most recently I tried topping with 2-3 semi-sweet chocolate morsels, which is also incredible.  The cookies and frosting are versatile enough to support different toppings.  They would probably also be good with cinnamon chips, although I haven't tried this yet.

New family favorite. Super easy and fun because you can change up the "decor" to fit the occasion so you have an excuse anytime of the year to whip up a batch. They came out perfect the first time. Thank you.

Followed this recipe as written. This looked and tasted NOTHING like the pictures or other reviews. I always make christmas cookies and the cookies came out flat and tasted like butter. When I added the topping it was too potent!  Will never make again!

My family and I really liked the idea of an Eggnog cookie, so it was impossible to not try this recipe. In the end, we were all very pleased with how it turned out.
The cookie itself wasn't bad, but it's flavor was a bit bland, and while it was pretty much a sugar cookie by itself, I expected it to be a bit sweeter.  The filling was delectable and sweet, and it made up for the slight blandness of the cookie. But instead of the rum, I added a tablespoon of eggnog, which was amazing. I found myself licking the bowl after filling the thumbprints.  The nutmeg was a great addition, as well, it added a bit of spice that completed the cookie. 
I have no doubt I'll make this again, but I'll probably add a bit more sugar/brown sugar. This is my personal preference though, I can't get enough sweetness. :) (Ps, I used a decorative spoon to press the cookies, which is why mine turned out crackled.)

This was an amazing cookie.  I know that I will make this recipe over and over again.  Even my daughter, who usually doesn't like confectioners' sugar frosting, absolutely loved it.  So good!  Next time we think we'll try brushing some rum on the unbaked cookie to give it an extra burst of flavor.

Great recipe! This is definitely one for the Christmas cookie list to make every year. My husband loved them. Cook time of 11 minutes is perfect and added a full tsp of vanilla.

Made just as recipe is given. Frosting has nice rum flavor, very smooth. Nutmeg gives it the perfect spice punch. Cookie is beyond  sweet.  Like, beyond. Thank you for the recipe, it was easy to make, I just wouldn't make it again.

So far these are really average cookies. I'm not a huge fan of icing so that's probably why I'm not crazy about them. They are kind of weird in that it is really difficult to tell when they are done baking. They don't really brown on the edges or anything.  I'm curious to see if they taste different after a few days of settling with the icing.

I thought this was a very nice looking and tasting cookie. I have added it to my Chirstmas collection.  I got 50 cookies. I would double the frosting and then pipe it in the thumbprint. Other than that I followed the recipe to a T.  Very good.

My family loved these ! They don't taste exactly like eggnog but they do have that spicy flavor. I only made a couple adjustments. As others suggested I used real rum and 
substituted it for the vanilla in the cookie. Some said these
 were not an attractive cookie so i tired them in colored sugar before I placed on parchment paper. I also pushed 
my finger nearly to the cookie sheet then placed them in the fridge for about 10 min. Baked them for ten min and they're beautiful! I made them once last week and added food coloring to the frosting. Also beautiful. Mine yeild 30 cookies for one batch both times I made them.

WOW! What a great cookie!!! I've been wanting to make these for a long time, but some of the negative reviews have scared me away. A former co-worker of mine bakes hundreds of holiday cookies every year and posts her creations on FB. I was pleasantly surprised to see that she made this EXACT eggnog thumbprint recipe and knew right away that I'd have to give it a try! If you follow SHOLLISMD's directions closely, these turn out perfectly. Using my small PC scoop, I was able to make just shy of 4 dozen bite-sized cookies. My pastry tool kit made piping the rum filling SO easy! Depending on your oven, these might take the full 11 minutes to bake (or longer), but mine were spot on at the 10 minute mark.... If you're looking for a unique cookie to celebrate the season, look no farther.... These are superb! Happy baking everyone!!! :-)

Good cookie but we didn't detect the eggnog flavor. Would like to try again to figure out why, but would still make a good jelly thumbprint.  Watch baking time or they'll be too crunchy.

Very good! I did not have nutmeg so I did without. I did however add the rum and it was very tasty. Another way I changed was to sub out some of the butter and used applesauce, made for a moister cookie so they went fast!

This is a great recipe as is. :) Buuuuut ;) if you are a big eggnog fan I have one suggestion, make the frosting with eggnog liqueur. Yum! Both are great. Love this recipe, will definitely make these again! Maybe with yet another liqueur in the frosting!

These really do taste like egg nog.  Easy to make, and I followed the recipe exactly.  I used a decorator tube to apply the topping to the completely cooled cookies.  The topping really does make the cookie great!

Good cookie!  Not a visual stand-out, but it'll be great served with a variety of other cookies.  I wanted something that wasn't chocolate and these worked out great.  You could easily drop a few chocolate chips in the thumbprint after they come out of the oven, then give them a swirl when they melt if you didn't want to use the icing. I have icing left over and I plan to use it on french toast...yum!

I am a huge egg nog fan and i just didnt taste the egg nog in these cookies. 
mine didn't turn out puffy like the pictures that have been put up-even though i followed the directions exactly. seriously i really did.
the cookies were pretty. the icing had a nice pearly shine and a good consistency but it just tasted too buttery to me-and ive never had that complaint before,  
i feel like there needs to be a little more mixing of flavors other than just the nutmeg and rum.
*also i used real rum.

Some of the best sugar cookies I've ever made.  I have had many requests for this recipe.  They turn out perfect every time!

The flavor of these were interesting.  My mom didn't think the flavor was strong--that being said, if you don't like eggnog, steer clear of these.  My dough didn't come out very smooth, nor did the frosting.  The idea was nice but I probably won't try these again.

I altered this recipe but would stil recommend it. The cookie is a good base, but I prefer something softer so next time I will use a different thumbprint base. What made the cookie was the frosting...and I think you could do this frosting without the thumprint. I did not use rum instead I used a tbsp of eggnog and then sprinkled a little nutmeg in the frosting mix. I also sprinkled nutmeg on top of the cookie. People who did not like eggnog liked these cookies. Will make again I think.

These didn't really taste much like eggnog to me, more almond-y than anything else.

This recipe was great! Everyone at work liked them and asked for the recipe.  The only thing I did different was I only had coconut rum. And that's what I used.  They were excellent.

These were remarkably easy to make, and taste awesome. I didn't have any nutmeg, so I sprinkled them with cinnamon. I also added a little bit of vanilla soymilk and a second tablespoon of rum to the icing, because the butter made it a little too thick.

Wow! If you like eggnog you probably will enjoy these. I used 1/4 cup butter and 1 stick of ICBIB margarine. I also used 1/4 tsp of rum extract and milk, instead of rum for the frosting.  I also used rum extract instead of the vanilla in the cookie dough. I enjoyed these very much, be careful to keep the cookie balls small, because they really are rich especiall with the frosting. I even liked them without the frosting! Thanks will be making again.

I probably shouldn't write a review on these cookies cause I changed the recipe.  But they were delicious.  I didn't have any rum so I used coconut flavouring in the cookie base and added vanilla flavouring to the icing and everyone loves them.  They are moist and tender absolutely delicious.  I can't wait to try them with the rum next time!!

This was my 2nd year baking these Cookies for Christmas. I loved them last year and again this year and they are popular with my recipients. The best, unique part is the FILLING (after all, it finally occurred to me that this is a standard sugar cookie recipe.  So, to save time this year, I simply quadrupled the recipe to use the same dough for my raspberry thumbprints and also for my cut-outs).  Thanks for sharing -- I'll continue to make these each Christmas!

Everyone that I had try one said they were okay but didn't taste like eggnog at all. I read so many reviews that said they did so I am wondering if maybe you need to use Rum to get that taste. I used the milk and rum extract substitute. Maybe that makes the difference.

I am a pretty experienced cook and housewife so I am pretty sure I got the recipe right but these are FAR FAR too rich for us. The frosting tastes like eggnog flavored butter. A total of 3 got eaten in my house the rest thrown away. Thank you to whoever posted it but do not bother making these unless you like buttery buttery buttery cookies.

These cookies were okay. The filling was tasty, and added a nice flavor, but the actual cookies were a bit dry and flavorless. It might have tasted better if they cookie dough has some nutmeg and/or rum in them. It was a little tricky getting the filling into the holes and still making them look good, but manageable! Overall, I would say it was worthy my time that once, but I don't know if I would make them again.

I am a huge Eggnog fan and had tried another recipe just before that which used Eggnog.  It didn't taste anything like Eggnog at all unlike this recipe which I have since shared with many people.  It will be part of my Holiday Favorites and be made for many years to come.

These cookies were a big hit with my family!  They had wished I'd made more.  I found this to be a very easy recipe and had no problems whatsoever.  My 3 year old daughter loved making the thumbprints in the cookies!  The only thing that I found to be an important key was to make sure they set up before eating them, they taste MUCH better that way.  I noticed someone mentioned something about having trouble rolling the dough...did I miss that part? lol

I was so excited to make these after all of the good reviews you had listed.  I will not make these again, the cookie was dry, too sweet, and they looked so plain.  The cookie dough did not roll very well, it fell apart.  They were left standing alone on the plate after serving them at two different Christmas parties.

I don't know about these cookies.  We made them and no one who tasted them liked them.  They definetly don't taste like eggnog.  The frosting is very odd too, it's very runny.  When I think about it, though, it makes sense; raw butter, sugar and very little rum.

Easy, delicious cookies.  Pretty presentation and most importantly, very sweet... satisfies even the sweetest sweet tooth.  We loved them.

Great cookie!  I made them to have for Christmas, but we've eaten them all, so I have to make more.  Very easy recipe and the rum gives it a great flavor, but then I love rum!  I think this will become a new Christmas cookie tradition for us.

Excellent recipe -- i loved these cookies, and i don't even like eggnog that much.  I made them for a holiday bake sale at work -- and they were a hit.

Thank you!

These tasted great and were a big hit at Christmas time. Wonderful recipe to have the grandkids help with the thumbprint.

I made these for the first time last night.  They are delicious.  My family loved them, and my mother-in-law immediately asked me for a copy of the recipe.

I made these for a cookie exchange, and everyone wanted the recipe!  The only danger is that you will want to eat them all (and they are small, so you feel like you can! :))

I've made this cookie for three Christmases now, and it's become my favorite.  Extremely tasty, highly addictive, and very easy to make!  Also, it can easily be doubled.

This recipe is loved around my house at Christmas time.  I altered it by adding more rum to the frosting.  They are best after a day or two, because the alcohol from the extra rum evaporates, just leaving the flavor.  However, the children who visit on Christmas don't particularly care for them.
