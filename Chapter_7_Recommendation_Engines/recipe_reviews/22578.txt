This is really good!!  I have made it many times on special occasions and everyone loves it.  A great change from the plain cheesecake.

This was great - rich, but not too rich.  The coffee and chocolate flavours complemented each other nicely.  I had a bit of trouble blending the melted chocolate into the rest of the mixture as it was a bit dry, so next time I might try adding some of the milk to it while it melts.

Absolutely fabulous! Everyone loved it. I noticed it started to crack on edges after 45 minutes in the oven so I turned the oven off and left oven door open for about 10 minutes and tranferred to rack. I dusted the cheesecake with cocoa powder on top of the delicious espresso cream. Thank you for a great recipe!

This was good, but could have been a little sweeter.  While I don't think I'll ever make this particular cheesecake again, I am going to have too find something to else to serve with that espresso cream topping - that was excellent!

Velvety smooth cheesecake with subtle flavors that work quite well together!  I decorated mine with homemade whipped cream & chocolate covered espresso beans.  This was a huge hit at Christmas last year & has been added to the official dessert list.  I also added a touch of cinnamon to my crust.  The coffee taste is not overwhelming and the chocolate is not too much for the richness of the cheesecake.  Great recipe for special occasions!
