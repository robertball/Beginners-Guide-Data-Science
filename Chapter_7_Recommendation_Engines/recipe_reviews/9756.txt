It is easier if you microwave the peanut butter mixture and chocolate chips until melted. Spread peanut butter mixture first, then the chocolate. No baking necessary.

I kind of recommend these. I followed the directions thoroughly and the came out very mushy. The bottom layer would not harden.  The were great, however, after they sat in the fridge for a couple hours.

This recipe is not worth the ingredients. They taste great, but they fall apart and are very flaky. I don't think that i'll make this recipe again....it wasn't worth all the time it took, but again they taste wonderful!!

Every layer of this peanut butter/chocolate bar was hard to manipulate into place, especially the crust.  I underbaked the crust and it came out as gooey as the top two layers.  I wasn't sure how the bottom layer was supposed to come out.

I gave this a 4 because everyone I served this to liked it. 
I don't know if it's because I used a glass baking dish, that my pastry layer needed more time. I left it in 12 minutes and then 5 minutes more. It should have been in 5 minutes more because when I went to spread the peanut butter, it tore up the cookie. But maybe that way my fault it wasn't spreadable because I used crunchy peanut butter instead of creamy and nuts, although I did use the whole jar. Then the chocolate did not melt and I left the oven on while doing this since my pastry level fell apart. 
Next time I will melt chocolate seperately, then spread on top.

This is kind of an odd preparation, however the results were good.  Overall, they had a full flavor, although normally I prefer peanut butter bars with the peanut butter in the dough, and less of a topping/frosting.

It was not as good as I thought it would be.  Kind of dry and it fell apart.

I made just the topping to put over boxed brownies. I think the egg whites made it very stiff (probably could omit those). I had to use my hands to try and crumble it into small pieces and it was still hard to spread out. The taste was very good. The kids gobbled them up.

These were absolutely delicious. I brought them to work and everyone loved them.
