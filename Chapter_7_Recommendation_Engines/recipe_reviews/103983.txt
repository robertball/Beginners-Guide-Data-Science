I had no problems with making this bread.  It was very easy to cut in half to only make one nest.  Turned out wonderful, and will definately become a family tradition from now on! Thanks for the recipe!

I've been making this Easter bread for at least 20 years ~ my kids are grown but still ask for it!  I make the braids the night before & refrigerate, then warm to room temp before baking.  It is so good.  Just a hint of lemon makes it a little different from traditional sweet rolls.

I followed the recipe as written. I did find that the dough was VERY soft and had to add extra flour to be able to knead it. I kneaded the dough on parchment paper so I would not have to continue to add a lot of extra flour. To color the uncooked eggs I covered them with food coloring and let them sit for a few minutes to let the color set in. Then I rinsed the extra color off. (Make sure you wear gloves to protect your hands from the color.) This had a nice sweet lemon taste, and looks so pretty.

Has a lot of steps but still easy to make and turns out wonderful. Made this for youngsters at church for an activity we are having and I know they will love it. I substituted orange juice and orange peel and it is very tasty. I also kept leftovers wrapped in foil and refrigerated after baking. This morning I sliced a piece off and toasted and it was just as yummy as last night. Never tried baking eggs before but they turned out perfect also. Definitely going to try this again and in fact have another two braids rising as I am writing this.

Delicious! It is almost like a type of desert. I has a lemony taste that is out of this world. In the end all my doubts about the eggs still being raw were thrown out! The eggs were perfectly cooked! My teenage son, my chef in training,  learned a whole lot about making bread - it was a first at bread making for both of us - that he can carry with him in his career as a chef. Really great learning experience for us. I would recommend this for any family that likes to cook together. It's defiantly a bonding experience!

Great texture, similar to pretzel but didn't care for lemon taste and I used less zest.  Maybe use zest or lemon juice or skip altogether.  I bake for almost 35 min total and it started to burn on bottom.

I probably wouldn't have attempted this had I known the rise time would differ so substantially from those stated in the recipe. I also recommend keeping a very close eye on timing during baking.

Delicious and very pretty.  I used orange peel/orange juice instead of the lemon. For some reason, my bread needed extra rising time, but it turned out great (eventually).
