I tweaked this recipe so that it was served hot and wow! Absolutely amazing!  I buttered hoagie rolls and toasted them in the oven at 350 degrees.  I used deli roast beef and pan seared it for a few seconds on each side to get it hot, then spread miracle whip and horseradish on the hoagies, added the roast beef, then the blue cheese.  My husband thought they were incredible and we will definitely serve it again!

Wow. This knocked my socks off with the very first bite! Indescribeably delicious... so good I can't even spell it. I improvised and used what I had on hand, sandwich bread toasted, chunky blue cheese dressing, and dried basil. I even forgot to toast the walnuts. Imagine this toasted... Mmmmmm. Even with the stuff I used it was 5 star, I can't wait to try it with the real bread and cheese (and remember to toast the walnuts next time). You've got to try this, it is soooo good!

Delicious! The only changes I had to make was to use regular sandwich bread because I didn't have any sub rolls on hand, and I had to use dried basil because I didn't have any fresh on hand. I'm eager to try this sandwich with the fresh basil, as I know it will give such a wonderful, fresh burst of flavor. I used regular mayo instead of light, which was what I had on hand. The first time I made it, I used blue cheese crumbles AND blue cheese dressing... but that makes for very pungent blue cheese flavor, so I wouldn't recommend that. Use blue cheese dressing only if you don't have the blue cheese crumbles. Otherwise, use blue cheese crumbles and mayo. Delicious, wonderful combination of flavors. I also pan seared my roast beef (don't really care for it cold out of the fridge). You won't be disappointed with this one! Thanks for sharing!

Wow, the flavors in this sandwich worked so well together.  I used sandwich buns rather than sub buns and toasted them for a minute.  Then I spread them with a horseradish mayo that I had.  I heated the beef very quickly in a hot skillet and that helped the blue cheese get soft and melty.  Yummmm.  Great sandwich and easy to put together quickly.

This is a really good, easy recipe!!  I followed the recipe exactly and I wouldn't change a thing.  My husband and I both loved it and whenever he sees blue cheese in our fridge, he's hoping it's for this recipe.

This is a wonderful blend of flavors.  Everyone in my family enjoyed this.  However, I agree with other users that the roast beef should be warmed before assembling the sandwich.  Otherwise I feel that the blue cheese flavor is too pungent.  Will definitely make this again.

I sauteed the roast beef in a little au jus powder and toasted a crusty bagette in the oven. The rest of the recipe I followed. The flavors of the blue cheese, nuts, beef, and basil go very nicely together. My man hates walnuts and still loved this, so don't shy away from the nuts.

This was great! I did change it a little. I heated up the roast beef and then I put the cheese on wrapped it in foil and put it under the broiler. My boyfriend doesn't like blue cheese so for his I used cheddar and it was really good. I really like the mayo basil combo!!!

I LOVE steaks with blue cheese, so I figured I would try this out.  The combination of flavors is awesome.  The nuts make an amazing taste enhancement!  I didn't have fresh basil, so I used dried basil. I am motivated to get fresh basil so I can have the full experience, but even with dried basil this was a 5-star sandwich, in my book!

I needed something special and quick for a transportable lunch at work....this recipe was awesome.  Although I'm sure that it would be even better warm and toasted, I made it to the letter and it was delicious and different.  Lots of compliments!  The basil/blue cheese combination is amazing.

Fantastic.  I toasted the roll after putting a little butter on it and warmed the roast beef. I also added horseradish and along with my fresh basil, it was delicious.  My husband said it tasted like it came from a health food store.  The basil must have given him that idea because it sure is not heart healthy.

Absolutely amazing.  Definitely not the same old sandwich.  Even the family members that don't like bleu cheese and the one that doesn't like nuts, love this.  I warm the roast beef right before assembling. I have substituted chunky bleu cheese dressing for the crumbled bleu cheese when I've made many, due to cost.  It worked out fine.   Toasting the nuts is a must and the basil is great.  Thank you for sharing this!

This was a great start.  Taking the advice of others, I added some horseradish and toasted the sandwich.  Very good.

I have made this many, many times and each time it's a little bit different. What I usually do is sear the roast beef until it's warm, then chiffonade the basil and throw it into my Magic Bullet with some lemon zest and the mayo. The lemon basil mayo is delicious on the sandwich! I also have learned that sliced blue cheese works really well on this as opposed to crumbled, which usually makes a mess and comes out all over the place. This is one of my very favorite sandwiches - and my husband's as well. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good recipe. I put the sandwich under the broiler for a few minutes, open faced. Also broiled the top of the bread before putting together. The basil really adds a good flavor to it...

Fantastic sandwich!  When I make them again I will butter and toast the buns first, then add the blue cheese and walnuts to one side of the bun, the roast beef to the other and pop back in the oven to warm thru and melt the cheese.  Then pull them out and add the fresh basil and mayo, yum, yum, yum :)

Such an easy recipe!  I left out the walnuts because I didn't have any, but I bet they would be outstanding on this sandwich.  Roast beef and blue cheese together is outstanding.  Thanks for a great sandwich recipe!

Pretty good. I whisked my eggs added some tomatoes, green onions and a bit of cinnamon  (I know, it's weird; it's my grandma's old secret ingredient) to the eggs and I baked the burger instead of frying it and it was pretty good.

I wanted to make this sandwich according to the recipe the first time, and I found I did not care for the walnuts.  It was just to weird for me. I think this sandwich would be much better toasted, leaving off the nuts and adding some type of relish or sauce.  I will give them a try again with my own changes and see if I can make this what we consider a 5 star recipe.

This was ok. The store was out of fresh basil so I used dried but I can tell it would have been better with fresh. I heated them to melt the blue cheese. Not great but good enough to try again with fresh basil.

We LOVED this recipe!  Followed the instructions exactly tonight, though next time we may include tomato and some onion.  Definitely a keeper!

The sandwich is EXTREMELY impressive.  The tastes together are amazing.  Here what I did:  The first two I made, I followed the recipe to a T, except that I did cook the beef a bit in a skillet, then I put the broiler on my oven and cooked the sandwiches open faced for maybe 5 minutes.  The second two, I put butter and toasted them in the oven, under the broiler.  Then put them together and broiled them until the bleu cheese melted a bit.  The second one with the toasted bread was much better.  And I did toast the walnuts, which made the sandwich great along with the basil.  It was SO SO good!

Loved It!  There were a few things I did differently.  I used Feta instead of Blue Cheese, sauted some mushrooms in butter and cut the fresh basil into strips.  I then put everything on the crunch bread roll.  We'll be making this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Quick and easy.  I found the basil a little overpowering for my taste. I put the rolls in the oven opened with pecans on one side and bleu cheese on other.  Let the pecans gets toasty and the cheese melty.  Added warmed roast beef slices and mayonnaise with basil.  Good for a week night meal.
