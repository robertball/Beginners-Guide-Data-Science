I made these for a Boy Scout Dish-to-Pass Dinner and EVERYONE loved them!  I used Onion Mushroop soup mix, as that was all I had!  Instead of bread, I used
crumbled saltine crackers.  I did not have half & half, therefore, used milk and one egg.
In the sauce:  I added 1/2 tsp. Chili powder, 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, dash hot pepper sauce
and 1 Tablespoon Vinegar--because I didnt' want a sauce with a strong Ketchup flavor.  It was delicious!

Very good! I made them for a party and got rave reviews. To make it easier I bought the meatballs already made. Sauce was great!

Wow...I finally found a sauce to complement my meatballs. I do agree...do not by frozen meatballs as homemade is much better. The upgrades I incorporated were 2 tbls of sour cream as it made the meat much moister, 1 (28 oz) bottle of Heintz Tobasco Ketcup (for a little more zip) and a few splashes of Franks Red Hot Origianl sauce. I then added a few more splashes of red tobasco sauce and a little bit of water in the slow cooker so as to take away some of the "ketchupy" taste while maintaining a moist sauce. These were a great hit!

I used frozen meatballs and then mixed the ingredients together to make the sauce (including the onion soup). I just put it all together on the stove on low until heated through. They were very good. My husband had about 15 friends over and the guys even cheered a beer to me and the meatballs.

I was looking for a simple yet good meatball recipe and this was "the one"! Everyone loved it. The only suggestion I would make was to double the sauce just to make sure they are extra coated. They were all gone fast!

I brought this to our family's Christmas Eve get-together and everyone raved. The amount of sauce worked perfectly for a large bag of Mama Lucia's frozen meatballs, which I warmed together in the crock pot. For my own taste, the sauce was a little thick/heavy... but no one else seemed to think so, so 5 stars it is! I did add the juice of 1 lemon, just to give it a little pep, which worked well.

I used Heinz Ketchup with Tabasco instead of regular ketchup, cooked them 18 minutes and made them for a crawfish boil. They were eaten so fast that i didn't even get to try one! Everyone raved and asked for the recipe. This is now on my list of great appetizers. they freeze really well!

This was really great! 4 Stars because of the changes I made. I used italian breadcrumbs rather than plain white bread, 1 egg and 2 tablespoons milk instead of half and half, Heinz ketchup with tabasco as opposed to plain ketchup, and I doubled the Worcestershire sauce. I also added a dab of garlic powder, onion powder and oregano to the meatballs. It was very delicious, sweet and tangy! I will make this again for sure.

Everytime I make this, I am asked for the recipe. Easy to make and delicious to eat. Only thing I change is I take the meatballs out of the oven a little early since they will continue to cook in the crockpot.

These are the best cocktail meatballs! I usually make these for an appetizer/cocktail party I have before Christmas and they disappear so quickly. Now I have constant requests for these all year long. Thanks for the recipe (:

I made these for a Christmas party. Everyone loved them! Well, everyone that was able to eat them since they were devoured pretty quickly. A few people mentioned that these should become a staple at our next function. Also, I didn't have any bread, so I substituted about 1/3 cup of oats.

Very yummy. I stuffed it with mozzarella in the meatballs before putting it in the oven. Putting a pack of Lipton onion flavoring really gave it a nice kick and everlasting taste in the mouth. Absolutely delicious when you eat the meatballs fresh out of the oven, especially when the mozzarella is still hot and oozes into your mouth

This was a very easy receipt and very tasty. I never knew you could cook meatballs in the oven! I made meatball sandwiches and my family really loved them.  I couldn't believe how quick it was. I cooked the sauce on the stove top instead of in a slow cooker. It worked out great.

I used frozen meatballs as this was a last minute idea. Im not normally a fan of frozen meatballs but I decided to give this sauce a try. Im so glad I did it was amazing! I did use half barbeque sauce and half ketchup so I wouldnt have to much of a ketchup taste. I put the ketcup, barbeque sauce and brown sugar in the microwave for about 3 minutes to get it pretty warm (I was in a big hurry) then I put it the slowcooker and I did the same with the meatballs. I also added some seasoned salt to the slowcooker and let it cook. My husband and all of my family loved these. I will be making them again for sure.

I thought these meatballs were ok but my friends seemed to like them. I made them a little to big I think and was dissapointed that the onion soup mix made them lumpy and coarse. I think if I make these again I will try for a smother (and smaller) meatball by using seperate ingreditents as opposed to the onion soup mixture. The sauce tasted good, it was a little sweet but I think that is what cocktail meatballs are meant to taste like. I think with the sauce I might try adding a little viengar too.

I used the lazy way, and used pre-made meatballs.  The sauce was delish!!!!!  Had it for Wii Bowling league and it was all gone so fast.  I did add BBQ sauce and used a little less ketchup.  Other than that, it was exactly as stated in the receipe.  Loved it and so did everyone else!

These are fabulous, we just ate them as leftovers as meatball subs covered in mozzarella, yummy.  The changes I did were add some chopped onion,italian bread crumbs instead of white bread, garlic powder, and used 1/2 bbq sauce and 1/2 ketchup in the sauce. Will definetly make again my husband loved them.

I absolutely love this recipe. I was first introduced to it by my sister after she made them one night when I was over for dinner. They are absolutely delicious. Of course, I was a bit apprehensive about the texture of the onion soup mix being too much for the meatball, but it actually worked well. I have to admit, while this recipe is great on its own, I did make a few changes. I used bread crumbs instead of the white bread slices called for, and I also added some Honey Barbecue sauce to the recipe, which I think gave the sauce a little something extra.

These were really good but didn't knock my socks off.  I would not use hand torn bread again though.  I would use the traditional bread crumbs; the bread pieces were sometimes to evident even if I tore them quite small.  Missing a bit of zing for my taste but if you like a very sweet cocktail meatball, this one's for you.

These were SOOOO good!!!! Everyone at my party enjoyed them. I used a bottle of ketchup that was a few ounces less than the recipe, added a tablespoon or so of molasses, and a little extra brown sugar to make it less ketchupy tasting. It was fantastic!!!! I can't wait to make these again. They were also very easy.

I tried this recipe for my daughter's grad party. They were easy and delicious!
I was tempted to buy frozen meatballs but decided to make them. It was well worth it! I will make these again. The sauce was simple and delicious too!

Yum Yum Yum! These are great! I made a couple of changes. Like another reviewer, I used fat free sour cream instead of the half and half and used bread crumbs instead of the white bread. I also made the sauce on the stovetop instead of the slow cooker then added the meatballs after they baked. Very good! Thanks!

These meatballs are really excellent, very tender and flavorful. We like our food spicy so I added hot sauce until the heat was where we like it.

I took this to a potluck tonight and didn't bring any home!  Everyone loved this recipe.  The personal touch was not so personal, I bought the bag of frozen meatballs at Costco, cooked them and soaked them in the crock-pot in Ketchup, brown sugar and Worcestershire sauce.  I'll make it again!

These were good. The men especially loved them. I personally don't think they would taste as good cheating with store bought meatballs because cooking the meatballs in the sauce is what flavors the sauce, and you wouldn't get the exact same effect from frozen/pre-cooked balls, but that's just my opinion. They tasted too "ketchupy" at first, but after 4 hours in the slow cooker they were really good.

Yum! Made a half recipe, ended up with 20 balls, probably a little on the too big side, but there was plenty of sauce to go around. Rated 4 b/c of changes I made. I did half ketchup, half chili sauce, added a little garlic powder and chili powder to meat mix, and mustard powder to sauce. I didn't have the onion soup mix, so I used a recipe from another website:  4 t. onion flakes, 3/4 t. dried parsley, 1/2 t. onion powder, 1/2 t. turmeric, 1/4 t. salt, 1/4 t. sugar, 1/8 t. pepper.
The sauce was a little on the sweet sauce, I'd put less sugar next time.

Not bad. I made these on the stovetop instead of in a slow cooker. I also cheated and used frozen meatballs from Sams Club. Added a bit of mustard in the sauce also. I still like the chili sauce/grape jelly recipe better but this was pretty good too.

I made these meatballs in double sized amounts for future use in pastas, etc.  I cooked them about 1/2 the time, knowing I'd be adding them to my own sauce and future recipes.  I froze them in a bag labled "1/2 cooked meatballs" and they are fantastic in anything you add them in.  My favorite forever, and your own meatballs NEVER taste like the cardboard ready-made ones taste like that you buy in a bag.

Pretty darn good!  I too added a little vinegar to the sauce, and it helped a lot.  I like that it is one of the only recipes that works without a slow cooker, and works well.

These meatballs were fantastic! I doubled the sauce, and added to it a tablespoon of BBQ sauce, and 1 teaspoon of vinegar. For the Meatballs I just added a teaspoon of minced garlic. My family ate them all up in no time at all.

Used this recipe for a graduation party for seniors, instead of ketchup we used 14 oz. of chili sauce and 14 oz of ketchup with about 2 tablespoons of hotsauce and 95% fat free beef to cut back on grease.  Set out white bread the night before, cut off crust then mixed all ing. into meatballs and added to slow cooker for about five hours on high. The kids loved it and now I have another child wanting us to make it for their party.  Thanks so much for the post. Use ing. to your taste.

These were tasty but the meatballs themselves were a bit dry.  I used extra lean beef and maybe should have used some extra milk to moisten them more.  The sauce was excellent though!

Great recipe!  It does take a good bit of time to mix up the meat and spices and roll them out, but it's worth it.  These are great for meatball subs.  They're now on regular menu rotation at our house!

Wow!!  These are great!  I have never made meatballs before, but needed a recipe to use a lot of ground beef.  These were easy and yummy!  My whole family liked them.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this for an Oscar party last night and it was such a hit. People were raving about them all night and I had to send the recipe off to a few people this morning. 
I also substituted the half and half for sour cream since I didn't have any and it worked great. I also used some leftover ground turkey for some of the meatballs and they were good too.

I am not known as a meatball maker...until now!  Took these to a party and they were devoured!  I didn't have the onion soup mix, so I subbed minced dried onion, onion powder and beef boullion.  The sauce is so simple but sooo good!  I'll definitely make these again!

This recipe is really easy when you use the pre-maid meatballs.  throw it in the crock pot and go...what could be easier?! It looked so simple to make that I was concerned that my party guest would not like them.  But they received rave reviews and were quickly gobbled up!  Matter of fact, I am making them for dinner per my husband's request!

these were very good.  the sauce is a BBQ style taste, tangy and sweet.  the meatballs really have great flavor too.  i made these as stated, next time i might add a couple of dashes of tabasco for a little heat to balance the sweet/tang.

I usually end up using store-bought turkey meatballs, but this is my favorite sauce.  It's a big hit with the kiddos and at parties.

I enjoyed this recipe, but I cheated with meatballs from Sam's.  I added some other spices to give it a kick.  My family enjoyed it and now its apart of all our family events.

These were delicious.  Made them for a party, and definately had no leftovers!  I didn't have any half and half or white bread so I used 1 Tbsp of fat free sour cream and 3 Tbsp of packaged toasted bread crumbs.  Will make again!

I took these to a family anniversary dinner and they were a real hit - gone fast!  I have had special requests to bring them to this years Thanksgiving dinner from members of my family so I am going to have to triple the number of meatballs the recipe makes to feed them all!

I usually don't bother to rate or review recipes that don't turn out  but this was so bad I can't help but review it . All they really tasted like was I poured a bunch of ketchup over the meatballs so disappointed . I had to add more ingredients to them to make them better . I couldn't serve them to my company the way they were to start with . They would have thought I had a 5 year old make them . Oh well won't make this one again .

This recipe is fabulous because of the meatballs!!!  I often serve these without any sauce because they are that good all by themselves.  At least half are munched down before the sauce even hits them when I do use sauce.

Sauce is great, but made with 2.5 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce and 2.5 teaspoons of Frank's Red Hot sauce. I also used 1.5 cups of dark brown sugar. Sauce was delicious and tangy. Also meatballs were flipped after 10 min each in oven. They needed more time than the recipe suggests. I had to keep checking meatballs and putting them back in oven..I also found that the meatballs did not cook properly. They need WAY more time than 10-15 min. I actually had to take the meatballs out after being already immersed in the sauce twice. I took them out, cooked them an additional 10 min and they were still  pink in the middle. At that point, I put a half a cup of warm water in sauce and maybe 2 tbsps or so of Half and Half to sauce mixture (in hopes that sauce would boil more in crockpot cooking the meatballs). The warm water and half and half enhanced the flavor of the sauce even more, but did not help in cooking meatballs all the way through. Therefore, I ended up repeating 10 more minutes in the oven, but they were STILL pink in the middle. Finally, I took them out of the crockpot a third time, put them in the oven for 25 more minutes on 400 degrees. They cooked perfectly, so I put them back in the crockpot in sauce on low. I served them at a party, and not one meatball was left. The recipe was fantastic after a lot of "doctoring" which is why I gave it four stars, not five.. With my tweaking, the sauce was tangy and tasty. My eleven year old daughter LOVED these meatballs.

I served this at my fiancé's birthday party and it was the highlight of the party!!! I did, like other reviewers, used frozen meatballs and I tweaked the sauce. Instead of using dry onion soup and half-and-half, I used a couple drops of lime juice, a few shakes of garlic powder and hot sauce. EXCELLENT!!!! It wasn't too hot at all. People are still asking me for the recipe!!!

Made this for Super Bowl weekend and was a big hit. Added some garlic and half bottle of amber beer and hot sauce as well.  Made some mash potatoes to go with it and was great.
