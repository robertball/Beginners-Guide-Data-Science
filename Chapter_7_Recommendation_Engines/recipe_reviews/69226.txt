I have always loved Suddenly Salad's Bacon & Ranch Pasta...they ain't got nothing on you Wilemon! This was sooo much better!!! I used a chopped roma tomato because that's what I had on hand, & I'm not a big fan of garlic powder so I subbed fresh minced garlic. I also used lite mayo (I always do...it's the only kind I buy). I didn't use fresh bacon as I had a huge bag of real bacon bits to use up....I probably added 3 or 4 handfuls because we were eating this for dinner & hubby likes his bacon. My can of olives were whole & there was no way I was going to slice them so I gave them a rough chop instead (I really loved the bites that had the olives in them so next time I think I might add more). I squeezed half a lemon (it wasn't a really juicy lemon) over it all & gave it a toss before serving & it freshened  it up a bit. Very, very good pasta salad! BTW 3 tbp. of ranch mix is about the same as a packet of ranch mix.

I've been making this salad for awhile and just got around to writing a review! My family LOVES this salad! Every time I make it someone asks for the recipe! I add two pkgs of the Ranch dressing mix and I add a cucumber, 1 1/2 cups peas, and a small bag of shredded carrots. When I want this to be more of a meal, I'll boil 3 chicken breasts, cube them and put them in the salad. I always let this salad sit over night or else make it in the morning. It tastes much better if you let it sit. Very yummy!

On step 3 I neglected to instruct to add the pasta with bacon, tomatoes, etc. then toss.  My grocery store has since started carrying grape tomatoes, I use them now because the salad will stay even fresher with uncut tomatoes by adding the grape tomatoes whole IF there is any left over.

Fantastic recipe that I have been making for years, but just now reviewing....  shame on me!  Few changes for personal preference and to enhance the flavor:  use Hormel bacon crumbles for ease, wedge cut black olives for a flavorful bite, two cloves minced garlic and 1 tsp coarsely ground fresh cracked pepper in place of the garlic pepper, greeen and red onions and red and yellow cherry tomatoes.  The trick is to use the shredded SHARP cheddar cheese.  A mild or medium just doesn't hold up to the myriad of flavors in this salad.  Also, since the original making of this salad, I have switched to using the buttermilk Hidden Valley dressing made from scratch.  HEPFUL HINT:  Garlic pepper is usually in a "grinder" and contains salt which this recipe definitely DOES NOT need as the cheese, olives, dressing and bacon have enough sodium already.  Thanks for the recipe!

Since this called for ingredients and seasonings that seemed like a great combination I was surprised when this just fell flat.  I was really unimpressed.  Not very flavorful at all. It wasn't all that pretty to look at either since the mayonnaise all but obscured any color.  Thank goodness I had decided to cube, rather than shred the cheese, as it did add some texture and color. At this point I felt I had nothing to lose, because what I had was a pretty boring mayonnaise pasta salad, and that's what I've based my rating on - so I decided to just throw caution to the wind and have at it! First of all, I added more of pretty much everything - more bacon, more seasoning, more tomato, more olives.  Still, a little too tangy and mayonnaisy tasting so I gave it a good plotch of sour cream to mellow it out - and some half and half.  And some sliced green onion.  And some frozen peas.  And then more of the dried ranch dressing mix.  I kept adding and tasting along the way (I must have used up every spoon in the drawer in the process!) until I had something pretty darned respectable, both in looks and in taste.  If prepared as written, I think this would have been a forgotten dish at the dinner table.  With my changes (all it basically needed was a little more of everything, plus some sour cream and chopped green onion) this is comparable to the pasta salads sold in gourmet markets!

Great pasta salad! This is perfect for BBQ's! My husband loves anything with bacon and his favorite dressing is ranch so I had to make this for the last bbq of the season.  Needless to say he loved it and so did our guests! I used sea shell pasta (I'm sure just about any type of tube pasta would work here). I also used 1 quart of cherry tomatoes cut in half, 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese (a whole bag) and instead of the olives I added 3 chopped green onions and 2 cups of thawed petite sweet peas. For the dressing I used 1 oz. of Hidden Valley Ranch dry mix with 1 cup of lite mayo and 1 cup of skim milk. I didn't mix that together with the pasta until 2 hours before serving so the pasta didn't soak up the dressing. Thanks for another great recipe Wilemon!

Great salad! I used the entire packet of dressing mix, a little extra garlic powder, and plain pepper instead of garlic pepper. I used half and half in place of milk, adding till it had just the right creaminess. If it gets dry in the fridge, just freshen it by stirring in a little milk and the creaminess is restored. This is delicious and has a very pretty presentation. It's perfect for potlucks. Love it! Thanks for sharing. Kaye

This was so easy and really good! I doubled the recipe for a party, so I had LOTS of salad! I took the leftovers to work and it was gone in minutes! I had several people ask for the recipe. I only made a couple of variations: I used real bacon bits instead of frying my own (for time saving purposes). I omitted the cheese and added broccolli. I also used halved grape tomatoes. You could probably do lots of variations,and it would still be really good...green olives, artichoke hearts, other veggies or cheeses...I think it's the ranch dressing mix and the bacon bits that make it unique. It also seems to taste better the next day because the flavors have blended more. So I'd reccommend making it the night before.

I LOVE this pasta salad! I'm also picky, so I leave out the tomatoes and olives and add some canned peas instead. I use one packet of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix since it's exactly 3 tablespoons as directed in the recipe and it's sooo good!

This was yummy!  I changed it a bit--added cucumber, green pepper and chicken.  I served this as our main dish-will definately make again.  Thanks!

The best pasta salad I think I have ever had.  I did omit the olives just because I don't like them.  Will be making again.  Thanks for the post.

AWESOME salad!!! I saved this reciepe a while ago, hoping to try it sometime this summer (this is a GREAT BBQ / picnic salad!). I am SOOOO sad that I waited to try this! I love Suddenly Salad’s bacon ranch pasta salad – and this was no exception! :)  Just looking at the ing. list, I knew I was going to like this a LOT. The fact that you can alter this to suit your tastes is very handy - use low-fat / fat-free mayo or Miracle-whip, change up the pasta, make your own Ranch dressing mix (if time allows, lambchop’s mom’s no-guilt zesty ranch dressing recipe seems to be a hit on here) and/or add or remove any veggies you like (I omitted the olives because I HATE them!). This is a VERY versatile reicpe, so have fun with it! NOTE: a reg.-sized 1 oz. packet of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing / dip mix is pretty much 3 T worth. And, here are my 2 tips for the day (haha!). A) Purchase a pkg. of real bacon bits instead of frying up 10 slices of bacon. My pkg. of Hormel bacon pieces stated exactly what the equivalent of 1 slice of bacon was (1 T). I used all but 2 T in my salad & saved the rest (and some more cheese… yumm!!!) for garnish. B) If you're like me & don't know what the heck garlic pepper seasoning is, just use 1/4 t garlic powder and 1/4 t ground black pepper. Problem solved! Thanks SO much for sharing your recipe, Wilemon! Everyone at my BBQ really enjoyed this. :-)

Great hearty flavor.  Not a light salad.  Tastes much better than Suddenly Salad.  I used half the bacon and no olives.  I added frozen peas with 3 minutes left in the boiling pasta.  Will use fresh, uncooked peas when in season.  I also used a whole wheat blend pasta for half of the rotini which added color and flavor.  Definitely a keeper and what's great is there are no trans fats like in the boxed pasta mixes.

This was just ok.  My main complaint is that it was so salty!!  The mix, olives, and bacon was too much I guess.  I will definitely try it again, but with a few changes next time.  First, I used Hidden Valley's Buttermilk Ranch dressing mix, as that's what I already had at home.  Next time I'll use regular ranch mix.  I will probably also cut back to two tablespoons of ranch  mix.  If it isn't "ranchy" enough, then I'll mix some with a little milk and add it later.  It was good enough to try again, but not as tasty the first time around as I'd hoped.

Very good recipe - perfect for bringing to a potluck as other reviewers have said. The only thing I would say is, like making tuna salad, cool the noodles in the fridge for awhile before assembling the rest of it. I made mine in a hurry and rushed the cooling time, and the dressing just absorbed into the noodles. I added some milk, a lot actually, before serving and it was creamy and tasted just fine. Definitely a keeper! :-)

Very good pasta salad!  Won't ever be buying a pasta salad mix again.
This is a foundation salad- it's basic and you should add what you like according to your family's tastes:  yellow peppers, thawed frozen peas, etc.
I added a splash of lemon juice really made the salad pop.  Can't go wrong with this recipe + your own common sense and sensibilities...

Sorry, not a fan of this. I do not like creamy pasta salads but thought I'd give it a try because of the reviews. Made a day in advance and if you do that, you need to leave it out on the counter for quite some time and add more milk. The rotini breaks up because it's so cold and it destroyed the bacon. It wasn't cheap and can't you buy it in a box? It makes a ton as pasta salads usually do when you use a whole box of pasta to start.  Won't be making again. Sorry, just not for me.

I loved this recipe.  I love it because it is very tasty and kid friendly which is a great accomplishment in itself.  I once again like to remind people who give negative reviews is that this is a recipe.  It is a science and variable.  For those who want to change it up or down is a personal preference.  Leave out the cheesy comments.  Just say our preference was to ......and leave it.

This is one of the best recipes I've tried on this site (or any site for that matter!). So easy, with so much flavor.  I used 8 oz. of penne pasta, added three cubed chicken breasts, and eliminated the olives and cheese (personal preference only). I also mixed up a little extra dressing because it was too dry to begin with.  AWESOME!!! My hubby and son ate it for a main meal and then came back later for a "snack."  Definitely something I'll be making alot.  Tip: For additional bacon flavor, I took the cooked and cubed chicken and sauteed it briefly in a little of the bacon grease before adding to the pasta.  Yummmmm!!

Delicious! I didn't have garlic pepper so I just upped the garlic powder, and added some freshly ground black pepper. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, and thought it was really good. I would say, however, that people who are crazy about olives might want to add more. This would be great for a potluck. Thank you!

This recipe was easy to make, and a great break from the usual mayo-n-tuna or bland Italian dressing affair! Next time I'll probably add some chopped red onion. I upped the bacon to twelve slices instead of ten (we really like our bacon around here), and did it in the microwave for the sake of ease. My brother said the only bad thing was it filled you up so quick you didn't have time to enjoy it. Guess that makes it a winner!

Loved this!! Followed someone's suggestion and used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream in the dressing mixture. Also, added a couple more slices of chopped bacon and threw in some chopped cucumber and green pepper as well. Couldn't find garlic pepper, so I just used black pepper. Made it the night before serving, put it in the fridge and all the flavors were well mixed. Thanks for the recipe!

Loved it!  Omitted olives but added chicken, grape tomatoes and a couple scallions.  Great idea for kid pasta!

I have almost the exact same recipe that I created!  Only I slice green olives into the salad instead of black olives.  And I don't use the milk or garlic pepper.  I do add some fresh ground black pepper though. Also, if you're diabetic or low-carbing it, use Dreamfield's brand pasta.  It has added fiber and lower in carbs, so you can eat more of it than regular pasta.

I really enjoyed this and so did my guests. I will not mix ahead again, as some reviewers recommended....even tho I knew better. The pasta sucks up the dressing and becomes dry and flavourless. I had to make another half batch to put on before serving. Delicious tho. We've grown tired of pasta and italian dressing salad. Thank you!

This is a great cold pasta salad! The used bacon bites to save time. Next time I will use real bacon, more cheese and maybe try some sunflower seeds. Mmmmm.

I rate the recipe 4 stars, but here's what I do to bring it up to a 5 (many dozens of potluckers agree):
*Paul Newman's Ranch dressing right out of the bottle. I don't have to mess with ratios of milk/mayo/sour cream/etc., and it is one of the few Ranch products that doesn't contain MSG.
*1 to 2 cups of chopped baby spinach. Sturdy flavorful leaf that doesn't wilt over time.
*Real Bacon bits, 10 - 20 T, add to taste. Not enough bacon may be one reason a few feel this recipe is bland.
*1 T minced garlic instead of powder.
*1/2 to 1 whole bunch of diced (I use scissors) scallions.
*1/2 c sun dried tomatoes (purchased dry, soaked in hot water for 5 min. before dicing).
*1/2 to 1 pint grape (or cherry) tomatoes sliced in half or thirds hold up better than a chopped whole tom
*for extra zing add 1 2.25 oz can of diced chili peppers or 1/4 cup of diced banana peppers.
* I find stirring all "dry" ingredients together first before adding ranch dressing makes mixing easier.

Better the 2nd day. I read 15 to 20 reviews before making this and the most common remarks/negatives about this salad were "bland" & "salty". Still, I was intrigued enough to try (thinking BLT, but BPT), so I thought long and hard about what changes would need to be made to address "bland" and "salty". Starting with the 2 boxes of pasta, I cooked it al dente. Drained and rinsed in cold water, then dumped in large bowl with ice and water to cool quickly. Drained on linen towel and refrigerated. Then I whisked together (double) 1 cup mayonnaise AND 1 cup sour cream, 2 pkgs ranch dressing mix, 2 cloves of minced garlic & 1 tsp fresh cracked pepper. Then I whisked in milk. I let this sit in the refrigerator for 2 hours because i know with powdered ranch dressings, if you try to eat the dressing immediately after mixing, it's gritty and very salty and bland. I fried 1.5 lbs of bacon and refrigerated. 2 hours before party time, I mixed the pasta with the sauce, then I crumbled the bacon adding it with the black olives, unsliced,whole grape tomatoes and sharp cheddar cheese. I have to say, I was surprised how bland the salad was. However, people really enjoyed it. In the meantime, while everyone ate, bite after bite I tried to figure out what I could have done differently. The answer came the day after the party upon eating a bowl of leftovers. Surprise! It was full of flavor! I was afraid to make this the day before worrying the bacon would be soggy and salad too dry, but it wasn't

A hearty pasta salad.  Made the bacon nice and crispy and added at the last minute so it retained it's crunch.  Also added sliced celery for another bit of crispness.  I also used the whole packet of dressing.   I'll be making this for a family get together soon and the only thing I will change is to use buttermilk instead of milk and leaving out the  garlic pepper , going with just plain pepper.  It passed the husband test so the recipe deserves 5 stars!

Such a great salad! I followed the recipe very closely. However I added some crushed red pepper and onion. It has such great flavor, I could eat all of it to myself! I saw a review that said she sometimes adds chopped up chicken breast, that sounds even better! Or maybe shrimp.......

I made this salad to take as a side dish to the event.  I kept a bit extra for myself and WOW! It was so delicious.  I did have to add some extra milk after it sat to make it creamier. In addition, I used some small cheese chunks instead of shredded cheese. Definately something I will make again and again, especially for pot lucks, etc.

Excellent - even my kids loved it!   I admit that I did use 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup of sour cream, and I didn't have any tri-color rotini, so I just used regular.   I also added more cheese.

Great starter recipe! Loved the flavor!!! I didn't change anything, I just added veggies to it. I added frozen peas and chopped up carrots. I boiled those together for about 3 minutes just to get them tender and then added chopped up broccoli and cauliflower. So yummy! Definitley my go to salad from now on.

Really great, but I too made a few additions. I added cucumbers, artichoke hearts, celery and 1/2 a sweet red pepper. (I couldn't find tri-colored pasta at my store, so added color with these additions!)  I had Maple Bacon on hand so I used that. To make it more figure friendly, I used Hellman's Low-Fat Mayo, Kraft Fat Free Ranch Dressing (I didn't have the dry mix!), some fat free sour cream and Almond Breeze Almond milk.  Really turned out GREAT!!  This is the MOST I've gotten my boyfriend to eat his vegetables!!  (Photo 27!!)

This was an easy,yummy recipe. I don't eat olives so I left them out, and I don't know what garlic pepper is so I also left that out. I peeled and chopped half of a huge cumumber and added it to the recipe and I also shredded about 1 1/4 cup of carrot and added it. It came out really good. I will make it again.

This was good, but not substantially better than the supermarket brand (also bacon & ranch) that you boil and add mayo to.

It was pretty good. I added chopped green onions, fresh parsley and diced red bell pepper. Also added some cayenne for a little kick. Would almost give this 5 stars, but I found the dressing to be a little too salty with all the bacon and the cheese. And also needed a bit more dressing as this dried out a bit once it sat in the fridge. I will try this again though, I like the idea and these are some of my favourite flavours! Who doesn't like bacon, cheese and ranch together? Thanks!

I basically followed the recipe except for using cherry tomatoes so the salad wouldn't become liquidy and I also followed one reviewer's idea of keeping the dressing out until almost serving time so the pasta wouldn't soak up the dressing and become chewy and dry. Thanks for this recipe. I now make it all the time!

excellent!  I made a few minor changes~I left out the cheese and olives, and added frozen peas and green onion, I also left out the milk.  I plan to serve this over a bed of lettuce to make it a "blt" salad.  I also think this would be good with chicken in place of the bacon.  

Thank you for a great recipe!

This is a great base recipe and tastes exactly like Suddenly Salad with fresh tomato (can't say I agree with others that it is better than it with recipe as written). I do not like black olives so I left those out. I added in crab meat as well as half of a yellow and half of a green bell pepper. This is definitely delicious but I do not know that I would make it again. With the addition of tomato, bell peppers, and crab meat, Suddenly Salad would taste just as delicious and take less time and ingredients.

This tasted a bit too 'boxed' pasta salad too me. I have to agree with mama_amy .... the sauce was a bit overwhelming to me as well. I think cutting back a bit on the mayo and the ranch a tad might make a big difference. I was struggling over if this was a 3 or 4 star rating so I will give it 4 stars.

Less than impressed.  Based on the reviews, I was expecting something tasty and easy to make.  While this salad is definitely easy to make, the end flavor was somewhat bland.  Everything blended together and tasted the same.  There were no standout flavors.  My husband liked it but I made it for a BBQ and it was not a major hit.  I will not be making this again.

I made this for 50 folks at my grand son's 2nd birthday party. Amazing basic recipe. I love it as is, but I add so much more..chopped celery, carrot, broccoli and peas. I buy the Costco bag of 100% real bacon peices and load it up.  I use the tricolor "wacky mac" pasta and the different shapes help to make it a fun looking dish too. I use 1 1/2 C Kraft Olive Oil Mayo, (1/2 the calories and a lot healthier,) and 1 1/2 packages of the Ranch dressing mix. Get creative with this one. It is made weekly during the summer in my home.

I was going to take this to a pot luck at work but instead I called in sick because it came out so bad.  I followed the recipe exactly minus the olives.

Very good! I made this to take to a luncheon at church.The chopped fresh veggies in with the pasta definitely enhanced the taste and I love the color they added to the dish.I made packaged Hidden Valley dressing mix and it was great. Will definitely keep this recipe to use again.

Great salad! I had many comments of "this is the best salad I have ever had"! I did not make it exactly as written. I was trying to find a salad recipe that I could use up some of my veggies. So I used the ranch, milk, cheese, mayo, and tomatoes. I skipped the bacon only because I didn't want to fry some up (next time I will surely add it but probably in the form of bacon bits). I used carrots, celery, red pepper and green pepper. A noodle is a noodle so I used a macaroni noodle instead of sprial!

This was edible, but nothing awesome.  The dressing was a little weird, probably because of the Ranch dressing packet.  We liked the ingredients, but I will probably try a different dressing.

soooooo delicious!  I made half of it without the tomato and olives (because my husband hates them).  They were both so delicious!  I like it better with the tomato and olives though.

Oh My! This is delicious! This is right up our alley! As far as the grape tomatoes, they will work for now until my garden comes in this summer and with my overabundance of "tommy toes" each year this will be a breeze! (no pun intended!) Thank you.

I used this recipe as a base, making several changes to accommodate the picky eaters of my household (which is everyone including me).  I left out the tomatoes and the black olives, used 8 ounces of pasta instead of 12, used 1 packet of Hidden Valley Buttermilk Ranch dry mix, and subbed the sharp cheddar for a mix of finely shredded mozzarella and provolone.  Everything else I followed the recipe on and I think it came out quite delicious.  I was worried about it lacking flavor, but the ranch and the bacon really came through after letting this sit for the recommended amount of time in the fridge. Overall, this is a great base that's very easy to season up however you like.

We have really enjoyed this salad.  And what's funny is that I really don't like ranch dressing on a tossed salad, but this works well with the pasta.  I've made it 5 or 6 times.  I did change a few things though.  I use the dry ranch dressing from our local natural food store--it is not as salty to me.  Also, I did not use tomato because 1) I don't like a salad the next day that has tomato in it--too mushy for me and 2) I was on dialysis and was very limited on tomato products.  So, I used a jar of roasted red peppers in place of the tomato.  I also added about 5 or 6 chopped green onions.  Finally, for any salad that I use mayo I use a combo of mayo and fat free plain greek yogurt of low fat sour cream.  This has become a real favorite in our home. Thank you sharing the recipe!

This was good and everyone at the bbq seemed to like it! I made a few changes. Instead of a full cup of mayo, I used a 1/2 cup mayo and a 1/2 cup of sour cream. I cubed the sharp cheddar instead of shreading it. I used half and half instead of milk and just eyed it. I used already cooked bacon, although I think the bacon would have been a lot better if it was crunchy. I used chopped olives instead of sliced. I added some red and yellow peppers and the crunchiness was great. I added 3 green onions. I used 3 roma tomatoes. I made this first thing in the morning and served it around 3:00 in the afternoon. I would make it again. :-)

I've made this twice so far.  Once for a company picnic and once for a baby shower.  Both times everyone raved over the dish and demanded the recipe.  It was one of the most talked about dishes even though it was among a vast buffet.  I highly recommend.

This is a delicious pasta salad. I must say that I had to change it up a bit because I was making it for my daughter's birthday party and she does not like tomatoes or black olives so I had to leave those out. I used the entire packet of ranch dressing mix and used cubed cheese. I understand why this dish is requested often because my family asked me to make it again the next time we get together.

Very tasty.  Made with chicken instead of bacon, because I didn't have any.  Roommate said it was too good to be called a pasta salad.  (He doesn't like pasta salads.)

I used my own homemade dry ranch dressing mix that I mixed with a third of lowfat mayonnaise, fat free plain yogurt and reduced fat sour cream. To get more vegetables in, I threw in more chopped tomato, diced red pepper and chopped cucumbers. We all thought this was quite good. My husband thinks that this would be even better tomorrow.

This is a very good recipe. I used low sodium bacon, fat-free mayo, 1% milk, and Santa Sweets grape tomatoes and chunked them up with Fat-free Cheese..I made Scotdog's Dry Buttermilk Ranch mix for this recipe....Other then making the recipe lightly healthier...I followed it to a T. With that in mind, my family thought it was good. A couple didn't like the tomatoes in it....while everyone else said it was good. Thanks

YUM! I actually used a 1/2 cup of bacon-ranch dressing, a dollop of mayo/sour cream/ cream cheese and mixed together. Then I added red onion, used cherry tomatoes and skipped the cheddar cheese. It was very delicious and my roommates loved it too! By accident, I bought the olives with the red jalapenos mixed in and it was actually really good! It gave the pasta an edgy spice that we all enjoyed. Next time I will add more bacon and olives (with red japs of course!).

We made this to bring along for our Thanksgiving meal and both sides of the family loved it.  Made the recipe as written and the only change I think I would make next time is more olives...everytime someone walked past the bowl, they'd pick out an olive slice!  Wonderful recipe, will surely be made again

I do not like the green "spinach" rotini, so I will try this again with unflavored rotini. The flavor was nice and improved the longer it sat. If possible make ahead for optimal flavor. I did not have a problem with this salad being dry and liked that it was not creamy.

i must have done something wrong because I really did not like this pasta salad. the rest of the guests ate it but no one mentioned it specifically. maybe i did something wrong! not a huge ranch fan, that may have been it. dont try this if you dont LOVE ranch.

This pasta salad is delicious and easy to make.  It is so much better than the pasta salads from the deli!  I did add 2 extra pieces of bacon....

Tasty! Tasty! Tasty! I omitted the garlic powder and garlic pepper, and added half of a chopped green pepper. I also used one cup of Oscar Mayer Real Bacon Bits, in place of the real bacon. Which is rare for me because I have an aversion to chemicals in my food.  But I figured what the heck, I'm using a Ranch dressing packet. It was a processed food love fest for my tummy! I would definitely recommend this for the occasional picnic or cookout.

really good. i changed this recipe alot so i almost didnt review it but thought i should share the bacon/mayo/ranch/ seasoning are all the right ratios. didnt use shredded cheese but coarse chopped some block cheddar and i added tomatoes and onions cause i had some to use up. i used pencil point pasta ( again some i had to use up) it came out really nice and creamy and better than expected as i was looking forward to using another kind of dressing only to discover someone used the last of what i had. i will totally make this again.

This was a very simple pasta salad to make.  I used halved grape tomatoes instead of a regular tomato.  I omitted the olives and the cheese.

I was very disappointed in this recipe.  The predominate flavor was salt.  I followed the recipe as written.  I used Oscar Mayer bacon and Hidden Valley Original Ranch dressing mix.  It was served at a cookout and no one had more than one helping.  I'm not sure how I would have altered the recipe to our taste, except to maybe use low sodium bacon.  I won't try this recipe again.

..We really liked this.  I used brown rice veggie swirl pasta and McCormick Buttermilk Ranch dressing mix.  Just seasoned with garlic powder and pepper.  I agree with IMVINTAGE in that it reminds me of Suddenly salad...only better.  Thanks Wilemon!

This pasta salad was a big hit with my family. My 24-year-old son came in today looking for (actually, hoping for) leftovers, but there wasn't one single bite that hadn't been eaten the night before. My husband, son, son-in-law, and daughter have all asked that I prepare it again - the sooner the better!

Family loved it but I used 1/2 cup each of ranch dressing and miracle whip in place of mayo and powdered ranch dressing. Omitted milk.   Also pretty with bow tie pasta.  Also added more garlic to taste.

Yum!  Used whole wheat pasta and added some red bell pepper for extra crunch.  I also used real garlic and fresh ground pepper instead of the salts.  Added thawed frozen peas, and having made this a couple of times, I like to cube the cheese, as in shredded form, it tends to form clumps in the salad.

This was really tasty!!! I am surprisingly happy with the way it turned out because I used miracle whip instead of mayo. Also, since I don't like olives, I chopped one green bell pepper and added to the mix. You will definitely need to add more milk to have the creamy texture. Overall, great pasta salad and very pleased husband!!!

I couldn't get my hands on some garlic pepper (where in the world do you find that?! I looked all over Kroger, and they had nothing!!!), so I added a couple of cloves of real garlic. It took the tang down by a lot. I didn't use bacon, but real bacon bits as a cheaper, yet still tasty, alternative. Caution to the wind-don't ever add the whole pouch, it's too much. I didn't add tomatoes or olives, because I despise those, and am rather picky. It was a good dish. Hopefully I can make some for my family again in the future!

Great pasta salad, I only omitted black olives, didn't have any on hand.  I did use Dry Buttermilk Ranch Mix by Scotdog and Bacon for the Family or a Crowd by Joyce for the packaged dressing mix and chopped bacon.  Thanks Wilemon.

This was a huge success! I took the advice of others and made some changes.  I did not put any olives or milk. Instead I used about 1 1/4 c hellman's mayo, 1/2 cup sourcream and 1/2 cup of Lawson's french onion dip (or your favorite onion dip). One packet of Hidden Valley Ranch is plenty. Also added frozen peas, red onion and some chicken tenders that was poached earlier. While the pasta was cooking, I mixed mayo, sourcream and dip added seasonings then mixed in veggies/bacon/chicken. Let this chill in the fridge until I was ready to add the pasta and cheese. Mixed everything together and put back in the fridge until ready to eat. I will agree with others and say that the pasta will soak up the sauce, so just make more of the mixture, not including the seasoning. The flavor will intesify as it sits. Will use this again for sure!

Yum!  Excellent salad.  It tasted great with lighter ingredients including whole wheat pasta, light mayonnaise, light ranch dressing (used instead of dry mix) and center cut bacon.  Instead of black olives I added chopped green onions.  I did add a generous amount of black pepper and a couple of sprinkles of cayenne and it was just enough to give it that extra spice to make it just right for us.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This was very yummy!  The only changes I made were to make homemade ranch dressing using the Hidden Valley ranch packets instead of combining all the dry ingredients.  I then use a cup of that ranch dressing for the dressing.  Also, I don't use the shredded cheddar but instead use a cup of cubed monterey jack cheese.  Otherwise, my family loved it!  Even my 5 year old ate it and liked it!

This was very good! However, I did not like the olives at all. I think I will leave those out next time, and add chopped green onions and some jalapeno for kick! Also, I instead of 1 cup of mayo for the dressing, I used 3/4 cup light sour cream and 1/4 cup light mayo and it was still delicious!

Made as is, people said they really liked it, but it was one of those that no one asked for the recipe.  So while it was good, it wasn't something I'll probably make again for a party.  I personally found it to taste too salty, & I did not add in any salt.

This was really good!  I used "Wacky Mac" rotini for the pasta (made out of veggies) and left out the cheese - it didn't really need it in my opinion.  My only complaint is that the flavor stays with you for quite a while after you eat it...

Oh my gosh, this is SO good! I made some minor subs (ie. added peas instead of olives, cubed rather than grated the cheese, and used grape tomatoes instead of chopped, etc) but it really is the sauce and bacon that makes this pasta delicious!

Thank you for this wonderful dish!

I let my sister take over for this recipe and she added too much pasta which made it dry. I'll rate it a 5 anyway but probably won't try it again :(

Using the basic idea of this recipe, I changed almost everything. I used whole wheat pasta shells, jarred "real" bacon bits, a packet of buttermilk ranch dressing mixed with 1/2 c. lite mayo and about 1/2 c. buttermilk. I grated a carrot and blanched it along with some frozen peas with the pasta during the last few minutes of cooking. I also added 3 chopped scallions and a can of albacore tuna. Turned out great and was even better the next day. Will definitely make again.

I loved this pasta. I made as directed, an added a chopped seeded English cucumber and grape tomatoes instead of a chopped tomato. Oddly, we liked it best when it was just made. My sons said it was too rich after it chilled for several hours. I disagree so I kept it at 5 stars. This makes a lot. Next time I'll half the recipe because I'm the only one who loves leftovers. It was great taken to work. I added some chopped artichoke hearts to one serving and like it a lot - but if you don't like artichokes don't bother. Thanks for a great recipe.

I've made this salad numerous times and it is one of my favorites. I don't add the black olives only because they are not something I like. This salad is good even when I don' t have tomatoes available. I use a dry ranch style seasoning recipe from this site so I always have that seasoning readily available. It is also quite a bit cheaper to make your own seasoning than purchasing the packages. Good salad and has become a standard in our house when I need a pasta salad. Thanks for sharing.

This is really good!  I was looking for something to be able to pack for lunches during the week.  Instead of bacon I used turkey sausages.  I also halved some cherry tomatoes and threw them in there, and I omitted the olives because I don't care for olives.  I also have no idea what garlic pepper is, so I just put a couple turns of freshly ground black pepper along with the garlic powder.  Oh, and 3/4 cup mayo was just right - remember, you can always add more but you can't subtract!  YUMMY

I made this with traditional white penne pasta. I'm a very picky eater but loved this dish! Every single person asked me for the recipe and this was gone in an hour (I made 5 pounds for a BBQ). Truly simple and delicious!

It's okay, but nothing noteworthy.  The spices, especially the garlic, is overpowering, and I agree that chunk cheddar should be substituted for shredded.  Also, the tomato really brings this dish down because of the acidity.  Instead, add peas or corn to still get a vegetable in there, but not as much acid.

Made this over the weekend, I used the basic recipe and added celery and chicken to the pasta. I deseeded my tomatoes before putting them in there, didn't have any cherry tomatoes. I worked with the dressing until I had it to the taste I liked. Also used Hormel bacon pieces instead of cooking bacon, just saved time. Everyone loved it, will make it again soon.

I made this for easter and it was a big hit. I changed a few thing such as I used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream, no pepper/garlic/cheese, added cucumber/red pepper/green onions, and i added extra bacon. It is a great dish and easy to make. i plan to use it again for many more get events!

Yum. This pasta salad is so great. I did make a few changes in mine, like adding a little milk to the ranch dressing, omitted the tomato and olive but added frozen peas and carrots. I'll be making this again and again.

Great recipe and very easy to change to your liking. I used whole wheat pasta, a 28oz can of diced tomatoes drained (I didn't have any fresh tomatoes), 2 cans of black olives drained, 1 can sweet peas, 2 cubed chicken breasts, 1 lb bacon, 1 cup of light mayo and almost a whole (small) tub of sour cream, lots of shredded cheddar, 2 packets Hidden Valley Ranch mix, lots of garlic powder, some pepper, some salt, a pinch of dill weed and a pinch of ground red pepper. Unlike some reviewers, I didn't think it was too salty. As a matter of fact, I thought it needed more salt, so I added some. I don't measure my spices - just add and taste. Next time I want to try it with grape tomatoes, but otherwise I think I'll do it just the same way I did this time. Definitely a keeper :)

Followed recipe exactly. This was good. The only suggestion I have is to let the pasta cool before adding the dressing. Warm to hot pasta tends to cause the dressing to soak into the pasta, never to be seen again.

I took this salad to a block party and it was a hit! After reading other reviews, I made some minor changes: I used very small cherry tomatoes (whole), add 1 cup of frozen peas to the pasta 3 minutes before done, and I added the bacon at the last minute, just before serving - this gave the crunchiness that may be missing if the bacon gets soaked in the dressing.  I did not add pepper and since I did not have cheddar cheese, I substituted by gruyere, and it was absolutely great.  Thanks for the recipe! This is a keeper, and so easy to make!

I thought this salad would do well for a meat-eaters pot luck.  It didn't do very well; it wasn't fresh tasting enough and was bogged down with too many ingredients. Maybe it's the Californians in us but the eaters went for simpler, fresher salads with less calories.  This salad says: "big eater, I'm here!"

Love this recipe! DO NOT use whole wheat pasta though. I am a huge fan of whole wheat/whole grain, but the taste was just too heavy for this nice, light dish.  Also, I would recommend adding the bacon separately into individual portions, if you think you might have any left over afterwards. By the next day the bacon is chewy and unpleasant.

We loved it and so did everyone at the party. Will be making often. I am going to experiment with yogurt cheese instead of mayo.

Received rave reviews and several recipe requests at the baby shower. I omitted the olives because I didn't have any; I didn't miss them!

Easy enough to prepare. Added frozen peas for texture/color, but had no "wow" factor for me.  After my own taste test, I rely on the response of family, friends, guests for deciding on a "keeper" recipe. When I mostly hear, "its fine", I know its time to move on. As others have stated, pasta becomes very dry following refrigetation. Doubling the dressing is highly recommended.

followed directions EXACTLY, and it came out WONDERFUL. I couldn't stop "sampling it...." while it was chilling. It only gets better the next day from being in the fridge. I recommend making your own bacon, using thick cuts. I also ADDED tiny precooked ham cubes scattered on top. HOLY COW, I'm addicted!

I used 2 tbls of regular ranch mix and 1 tbls of "Fiesta Ranch" dip mix by Hidden Valley. It added a fantastic kick and I think I will use even more next time!! I didn't think this recipe could get any better... and I love that I can enjoy a pasta salad that doesn't take like italian dressing.

I tried making a low cal version of this recipe and it was a GREAT hit! Instead of using a cup of Mayo, I used a little over 3/4 cup of plain yogurt and two big spoonfulls of lite mayo.  I also used turkey bacon bits and added peas, broccoli and olives.  It was a smash and is now my party staple!

Me and my family ate this last night and it was a hit. Although I did change some things, I didn't have any ranch dressing powder so I used 1 cup of ranch dressing and half a cup of sour cream; I did not use any mayo; but I did add half a small chopped onion and half a cup of chopped mushrooms cooked in 3 tbls butter. It tured out wonderful.

Not crazy about this at all.  The ranch was too powerful (I would have halved it) and cut down on the dressing to 3/4 c., if not half a cup.  The entire salad seemed to be too busy, it's not necessarily alot of ingredients, but the combination is too jarring.  I won't be making this again.

I wanted to really like this, but, I thought it was just okay.  I made it for a pot luck--no one really commented on it, but, it was being eaten. I didn't care for the strong ranch dressing taste.

This was enjoyed by the adults and the children under 10.  I did leave out the black olives (except for the youngest...she loves them).  I added extra ranch dressing in the end and I did use more milk to make it creamy.  Otherwise, I made it exactly as it is written.  If you can make it a day ahead, do that and let it sit.  Even better the second day!!
The best part is that everything is made from scratch...which I prefer.  I don't like box salads.  Just great!

I've made this salad for many years, although I make mine using a cup of homemade ranch dressing.  I also add fresh chopped broccoli for color as well as taste and fiber.

Excellent flavor, and easy too! I was looking for a salad to bring to a get-together. I used precooked thick cut bacon, so that was a time saver. I also used a small carton of cherry tomatoes, halved and that worked really well. The host asked to keep any leftovers, but it turns out there weren't any!  Thankfully I had mixed up extra dressing and brought it to the party to add before servings, since the pasta was a little dry after sitting in the fridge for two hours. Thanks for the great recipe!

I have made this pasta salad several times and always get compliments. One change I made was adding a little sour cream and lemon juice to the dressing. I reduce the milk and mayo slightly and add these. It seems to add a little fresher flavor and less mayonnaise taste. Otherwise love it!! Also 3 tbs of ranch mix is basically equivalent to 1 dry package. Thanks for the recipe!!

It was a great way to get the flavor of the fake "suddenly pasta salad, bacon ranch flavor" from fresh ingredients.  I used non-fat greek yogurt instead of any mayo or sour cream.  It worked out great the night I made it.  The next day was a different story.  Next time, I will either do full fat (to keep it moister) or a mixture of the sour cream and 0% fat greek yogurt.

This was so good and so easy.  Did my bacon in the oven.  Only thing I changed was doubled the garlic (that is a given) and added some red onion.  Delicious.  Will be making this again.

This recipe was a hit at my backyard BBQ! My husband took the leftovers to work the next day and said it was even better the next day. When doubling the recipe, I would suggest buying 3 packets of the dry ranch dressing.

Great recipe.  Big hit on 7/4.  Made the recipe pretty much as written except used finely diced fresh garlic and mixed with dressing mix, regular pepper, and 2 cans of black olives (only because I love them!).  FYI, if you measure the standard dry dressing package it equals 3 tablespoons, therefore, you should be using the whole package. There wasn't one spoonful left!  Thanks Wilemon--very tasty!

Loved it! Loved it! If i can in some way, I streamline everything I cook, so I used a small packet of real bacon pieces instead of cooking bacon and that saved some time. Also, I added some shredded carrot and thawed peas. And I left out the cheese because I didn't notice it in the recipe!  Not until I read another review that mentioned the cheese... (I really need to slow down!) But I must say, it tasted fabulous without it, so I will probably omit it always. Thanks for a great recipe!

I used cavatappi pasta instead of rotini, and cooked it al dente. Half mayo, half sour cream, added finely sliced green onion, (about 4 average, including some of the dark green part) and used real bacon bits. I also added 1 cup slightly chopped fresh broccoli just because the grandkids love it. Perfect! There wasn't any left over, but I imagine if it was dry the next day, a little milk would do the trick. My family really enjoyed it, and the hardest part was just some of the chopping. I wouldn't mind trying to tweak it a little more sometime....hard boiled egg? grapes? pimento? We'll see...LOL

I love this recipe, I made this as written, and now it has evolved......I am not a huge fan of olives or uncooked tomatoes, so the first time I made it I just picked at the pasta, bacon and cheese. The Ranch is the key flavor here and this is so much better than dumping some premade dressing on pasta. Like I said I have evolved this salad. The dressing, bacon and cheese remains the same but I have taken out the olives and tomatoes and replaced them with red onion, chicken breast and some pickled jalapenos. The beauty of salads is you can add whatever you like to them.

Everybody loved this... Even those who said they aren't usually ones for pasta salad. I did add 3 cloves minced garlic, frozen peas and about 1/2 cup of chopped green onion... And used 1/2 mayo & 1/2 light sour cream. Really great for potlucks and picnics! Thanks for sharing!

Made this for a potluck. I thought it was pretty tasty, especially with the bacon! I added a tad bit more than called for b/c I had extra from another recipe. Mmmm..bacon makes everything better. lol. Everyone that ate it enjoyed it. There were even other pasta salads there and was told that this one was the best on the table. Thanks for a good recipe. :)

This was great! And that's even with me forgetting the cheddar! I did take the authors advice and use whole grape tomatoes, which worked out nicely. Also used half the olives listed (2.25 oz.) and added a handful of chopped green onion. This truly was spectacular and will be a regular on our table!

This is a favorite!  I never have powdered ranch, so I mix mayo with the bottled stuff (and leave out the milk).  I have also added peas and forgotten to add cheddar, but it's always good!

I'm giving this only 4 stars, because this is a pretty good "base" recipe.  I did have to make some changes to snazz it up a bit to suit our tastes: used grape tomatoes; cubed up the cheese; added more prepared ranch dressing; used 4-5 fresh, pressed garlic cloves; added a seeded, minced jalapeno; used garlic salt (because, believe it or not, it still needed salt!--next time I plan on using ditalini because I think it's easier to get a nice coat of dressing, etc on that type of pasta).

Great pasta salad! Has such a great flavor. Next time I will increase the mayo, milk and seasoning to make it more creamy. I used a pack of real bacon pieces instead of cooking Bacon which turned out great and less cooking! I will also use less olives next time. My hubby hates cold pasta but loved this one!

I actually made this hot and had it for dinner.  I left out the cheddar cheese and added some fresh chopped basil.  It was delicious!    And tomorrow, I will eat it cold as a salad!  Great recipe!!

This was overall good. I felt like there was too much mayo in it though, in the future I would cut down on that amount. Maybe I would use some plain greek yogurt in its place. Others seemed to enjoy it a lot though.

I couldnt stop eating this as I was making it. Dont think to buy bottled ranch instead of powder, the powder makes it easier to increase flavor without adding liquid. I made salad night before and added bacon and tomatoe right before serving. Bacon was super crispy that way. Everyone loved it.

I've made this a half a dozen times or so in the past 2 months. Sooo good! So much better than the boxed bacon ranch pasta I've been buying. The only thing I change, and only because this is what we prefer, is that instead of olives and tomatoes I throw in about 2 cups of broccoli/cauliflower/carrot mixture. This comes all together in a bag in the frozen section. Just straight out of the freezer, I put it in with the hot noodles just as I'm done straining them. This thaws them out. Thanks for the recipe!

I did not like the flavors of this pasta salad.  Too much ranch, and way too creamy.

This is a good base.  I had to make a few changes, but the result was great.  First off, I used a 16 oz box of noodles cuz that's what I had.  Second, I did not have the ranch dressing mix on hand so I just used regular ranch dressing and omitted the milk.  Third, I had to almost tripple the dressing/mayo mixture cuz it was quite dry, (probably because I had more noodles).  Also, I used cubed cheese because shredded makes for a wierd texture in my mind.  Lastly, I just added things to this that I like, like some green onion, cucumber, green bell pepper, and carrots.  I chopped everything up into bite sized pieces for the look.  This was great and I will be making this again.  Thanx!!!

Loved this salad.  I am always looking for a new pasta salad to try and this one was well worth it.  I have passed it on to many friends and family members.

Pretty standard pasta salad recipe. I used a 'bacon-ranch' flavor of salad dressing mix and turkey bacon. This came out good. I didn't add olives, as we don't care for them, but I would add them next time if I was bringing this to a potluck or gathering. 4.5 stars.

Excellent salad, but I'm a Ranch nut! And what doesn't taste good with bacon and cheddar?! Forgot the tomato and still was a fantastic salad. Used whole lb of bacon though and a larger can of olives.

I've made this several times - which tells you all you need to know about how much my family loves it.  I've used Best Foods Low Fat Mayonnaise Dressing for about half of the mayo to reduce the calorie count a little.  I also skip the tomato - my kids don't like them and I'm afraid they'd make the salad watery -and add in finely diced red and green bell pepper for crunch and color.  Of course, other pasta shapes work, too.  This salad is a real winner.

We loved this salad. I only made two revisions. I left out the olives since we don't like them and added some left over turkey. It was great!

Fantastic!!! I made this using 1\2c. Mayo, 1\2c. Sour Cream, a few handfulls of Grape Tomatos halved, 1 Orange Bell Pepper finely chopped, 3 Green Onions chopped, doubled the garlic powder, omitted the milk & used an entire packet of dry Ranch seasoning. 
My family loved it! And the best part is that there is SO many variations to try :)

Always a hit at any gathering. People always want to know this recipe! Adding the tomatoes and bacon at the last minute helps prevent them from becoming soggy.

There is nothing wrong with the recipe, it simply wasn't too my taste.  I prefer my pasta salads to be lighter.  Adding the cheese to it makes the overall consistency of the salad quite heavy, almost gloppy.  My family didn't care for it either.  I won't make it again.

This is more of a personal preference...but this pasta salad was much too rich, thick and creamy for my taste.  I think it made me gain 20 pds..I prefer a pasta salad with a lighter dressing and no bacon.

I absolutely loved this! I would not salt the pasta water though. There is enough salt in the recipe. It would also be great with chopped green onions. I used regular pepper as well. Will definitely make this a favorite!

I wanted a different macaroni salad for barbeques and tried this.  Totally a hit!!!  I've been using it for about 2 1/2 years now.  I usually do a potluck style bbq with one person bringing either a potato salad or mac salad.  Well...my buddy has now begun having bbqs at his house just so he can request that I bring this pasta salad.  Thank you for the great recipe!

This was very good...I didn't use tomato because I didn't have one and I don't like olives...I replaced them with cucumber and it was very good. I like this recipe because you can put in whatever veggies you have on hand and it still is very flavorful!

Very rich and flavorful.  Does have that BLT taste.  I used twice as much mayo to keep it creamy while it stored.  A little heavy and substantial for a summer salad, but I loved it.

This was delicious!  I made a few changes though.  I used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream.  I added one small bag of frozen peas.  I threw the peas in the pasta water when it had 2 minutes left.  Shell pasta instead of rotini because it catches the sauce and peas really well.  I also used crushed red pepper instead of garlic flakes and used 1 tsp garlic powder.  I made it 3 hours prior to bringing it to a dinner and I did not have a problem with it being too dry.

A very good and simple pasta salad.  I added a tomatillo and jalapeño stuffed green olives for a little more bite.  I think I had too many green olives!  Still was very tasty!

This is my go to recipe for bbq, potlucks, showers, get togethers, etc...
I always receive compliments on this along with my husband who asks me to make a double batch; one to bring and one to keep at home. It's very tasy and easy to make.

This was a great salad. I made it for a staff meeting and folks raved about it. I, too, added deseeded chopped cucumber. I also used low-sodium bacon and 2% milk cheese.

I made this for my son's pool party, more for the adults than the kids.  The kids went back for seconds and thirds. It was devoured in no time!  I made it the night before and added a little milk before serving. Wonderful!

this was very good. I left out the cheese just because it didn't seem appetizing to me and I added some chopped onion I already had hanging around as well as a 1/2 can of peas.

This is a really good pasta salad.  Tastes just like the box kind.  I didn't have any garlic pepper and I don't like olives so I didn't put those in.  Very good and I will be making this one again instead of buying the box kind from the store.

Too salty for me.  With the bacon and mayo and seasonings,  its just too salty so i cant really taste anything else. I added a cucumber.  Next time I will prolly make it with fat free sour cream instead of mayo and low sodium bacon.

My family enjoyed this recipe but it wasn't much out of the ordinary. I think that one of the key ingreds. in this recipe is using real bacon, not bacon bits. The only change I made was not to use the black olives because my kids won;t eat them. Thank you -

The 1st time I made this salad I followed the instruction only I added fresh garlic instead of powdered.  The 2nd time I made it I used shaved chopped ham instead of bacon and cut the shredded cheddar in half and added crumbled Feta.  I also chopped up a little fresh basil and a few thinly sliced green onion tops.  I got good reviews.

Oh my, my this is delish!!!  I didn't add the cheese or the olives becuase I served this with homemade pizza which had plenty of both.  I used half baby wagon wheels and half Mickey mouse pasta only because that is what I had on hand...  Subbed 4 green onions for regular and that's it.  this was so good - even my 4 yr old ate it, onions and all!!!!

I made this salad for a "salad social" I planned for a group of my friends! Both myself and the other girls LOVED it! I did changed a few things... I used regular rotini rather than the colored, left out the olives, and added in some canned peas. Definitely delicious! I will making this again!!

Excellent homemade version of the Suddenly Salad Bacon Ranch. I think this tastes a lot better though since you can limit the salt amounts. I will definitely be making this in the future instead of a boxed mix! Easy enough to make on a week night for supper.

Very fresh tasting- it was a huge hit!  I didn't have dry ranch mix, so I reduced the mayo to 1/2 cup and mixed it with 1/2 cup bottled organic ranch dressing.  I used black pepper instead of garlic pepper because it's what I had on hand.  I omitted the olives and added 1 cup of frozen mixed peas/carrots, plus 1 cup of chopped cucumber.    Next time I will double the bacon, because I chopped it up with a scissors and didn't use any of the pure fat pieces.    I will keep this as my staple pasta salad recipe!

The best pasta recipe I have ever tried! I made a few changes: 1/2 cup light sour cream & 1/2 cup light mayo, 1/2 cup peas, large pinch cayenne, 1/2 diced red onion, scallions, 1 carrot diced, 1 red pepper diced, 1/2 green pepper diced & more ranch seasoning mix & milk as needed. WONDERFUL!

This was a pretty good pasta salad.  It could use a little something extra, maybe more tomato and olives? I will definately make this again and experiment with adding different things.

This was a great pasta salad!  I can't wait to make it again.  It is best if it sits overnight and then add more milk to make it moister, this also helped with the saltiness if it seemed to strong.  I added extra tomato and it was great.  It would also be very good with some broccoli, cucumber, and cauliflower added.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great addition to any barbeque.  No such thing as leftovers with this recipe!  I did cut the olives in 1/2 though, too many olives in the original recipe, but that''s just a matter of taste.  You will not be disappointed!!!!

I made as stated and it was very good. There seems to be a lot of dressing when you mix it, but it is absorbed while it chills. Makes a perfect side dish to any meal. Will definitely make again.

Unbelievable pasta salad!  I made this for a party and it was a huge hit.  However the second time I make it (just for myself) I didn't care for it. I realized that the first time I did the recipe 1 and 1/2 (16 oz of pasta ect.) but I only had one package of ranch mix.  The second time I used exactly the amount called for and couldn't eat it.  This last time I made the recipe (for 7) with 8oz pasta and only 2 tbs ranch mix and it was perfect.  As is I'd say WAY too much ranch mix and parred down a little it's amazing. Add in lots of yummy veggies (I do cucumber, olives and carrots) top each bowl with bacon before serving (otherwise it gets soggy) and voila! You wont be able to stop! Thanks for the recipe!

I may never make pasta salad the same way again....or at least this is the perfect version of something different. I tasted it after I made it....awesome! And it says better when cold, I can't wait to have some later. I did not have garlic salt, but when I tasted it, I think with the saltiness of the bacon it was perfect and didn't need any. I also used lots of tomatoes and some cucumber since my husband does not particualrly care for olives. Thanks so much for a new take on pasta salad. Yummy.

This is great.  But I use grape tomatoes instead of chopped tomatoes.  And I add a seeded and chopped cucumber and a shredded carrot to make it a little healthier. Instead of frying bacon I use the package of bacon bits - the real kind.  I can make it in 30 minutes including cleanup.

Much like my old standby "Suddenly Salad," but SO much better with fresh ingredients!  Make the equivalent of two boxes of salad mix.  Very tasty... no changes to suggest.

Excellent! I didn't have any dry ranch packets so I used the premade ranch dressing. I waited to add the bacon until just before serving & added a little buttermilk the thin it out too.

Everyone Loved it at our cook out!  I just did the pasta, dressing, bacon & cheese and left the extras out...still a big hit. I'm suprised a packet of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing with the mayo has that much flavor...delicious.  The 1 oz. (taller) Hidden Valley Ranch packet was the perfect amount.

This went over very well at a picnic! Quite a few people went back for seconds and I got a lot of compliments. I'm a fairly picky person and it was nice to have a pasta salad that didn't call for peppers and onions and such. Made a few adjustments that worked great for us: used a 16oz. box of medium shells, a whole package of bacon (duh!) and no olives since I don't like them. It seemed like A LOT of ranch mix and it tasted pretty strong to me. As I ate some of the leftovers, I added some extra mayo/Miracle Whip and then it was perfect for me. Also, I did not find the recipe too salty. In fact, my bf wanted to add some salt and I wouldn't let him because I thought it was perfect.

Great recipe! There are a ton of variations you can make. I used whole wheat pasta, added chopped cucumbers, and added some avocado cubes to the top right before serving. My husband loved it. My 2 year old ate enough of it for me to know it was decent. I think you could easily add some cubed chicken to this to make it even heartier. Great overall!

I followed recipe exactly and thought it very salty. I'm not sure if it is because I make my own ranch dressing or not. I did add a half cup of sour cream to try and cut back on the salt. It has a great flavor, just to salty for me.

Really good!  I added chopped cucumbers and some dill.  Also used whole cherry tomatoes instead of dicing.

This was really good!  I realized when I started that the dressing is a lot like I make my ranch dressing,  only instead of 1/2 cup of milk, I use a cup of buttermilk.  Then about 1/8 to 1/4 cup of sour cream.  Everything else, I kept the same for the dressing.  I used halved grape tomatoes instead of 1 whole tomato.  My salad is still creamy after about 8 hours.  It has wonderful flavor too!  Thanks for the recipe!

I wish I could give this 5 stars but I cant due to the fact that this salad gets very dry after being refrigerated. I only made this salad about 4-5 hours prior to our party, and even saved some of the dressing to coat and mix in at the party before serving. It wasnt dry to the bone, but it wasnt creamy either. But.....the flavors were all there! This was very tasty! I used fresh cooked crumbled bacon, gemelli pasta, baby cherry tomatoes quartered, scallions, and some broccoli florets. I also used reduced fat mayo, milk, and 2% shredded cheddar. I thought this salad was really good and I will make again....great for a pot luck and makes a ton. Next time, I will DOUBLE the dressing, toss half when making the salad and the other half(so there is more)before serving. Thanks!

Great salad! Make night before to let flavors blend and mellow nicely. Add tomato before serving to preserve salad. Other than having no nutritional value besides the one tomato, this was an excellent and mighty delicious salad!

This was the BEST!!!!! I used Roma tomatoes as my boyfriend loves them and I also used a generous amount of real bacon bits instead of the slices of bacon. I also added cubes of cheddar cheese, ham and salami. YUMMY! We ate it on 3 of the hottest days of 90+.... It is a mirror recipie for something he use to drive out of his way to a mom and pop store in nowhere's ville! Thanks for the smiles!

Just made this - it's in the fridge now..if first impressions count, I can't wait then until it's chilled!!  I used a 16 oz box of noodles so I increased the mayo & milk a bit.  Also sprinkled a bit of "Weber's Grind & Grill Zesty Lemon" seasoning. I'm keeping this recipe for sure!  Thanks much for such a goodie!

This recipe was a success. I used turkey bacon and low fat mayo. I did as others said and added a little milk the next day before serving and squeezed lemon on it. Everyone loved it and several people have asked for the recipe. I'm making it again for a work party.

I made this salad for a 4th of July potluck, and it disappeared, so I think I'll make it again. I may add some broccoli and maybe some cucumbers next time, and I'll follow another reviewers suggestion and squeeze a bit of lemon juice on before tossing.

It was very good - but I didn't have enough of the dry ranch dressing when I put it all together (buy 2 packages to get your 3 TBSP)...It was great - loved the bacon add, and I used roma tomatoes.  Yummy!

Not bad as far as the actual recipe, but the lack of clear instructions is a problem. Especially for someone just beinning to cook. It doesn't say to drain the olives and it doesn't mention the pasta at all in the instructions.  I think it could confuse a beginner cook who wanted to make a nice, easy salad.

Very good pasta salad.  I omitted the garlic  and doubled the dry ranch mix.  Added extra milk for creaminess because the pasta will absorb the dressing. Also added broccoli florets for color and taste

Tasty dish. Took it to a family gathering and everyone liked it and wanted the recipe. Super easy. Only thing I did different was I added the bacon on the top just before serving so it would stay crisp. Will definitely make again.

This was really, really good! I always make a new recipe exactly as written the first time to see if changes are needed.
As I was enjoying my second helping, I thought that blanched broccoli flowers might be better than tomatoes (I used grape), which were good, but seemed to "interrupt" the delicious flavor profile and texture. Also, I'm a bacon addict so I'll cook up the entire pound and put that in, too.
Definitely a keeper - I'll be taking it with us to a family Memorial Day cookout!

My family thought this pasta salad was delicious! We really enjoyed grape tomatoes and kalamata olives in it. I added more spices than in original recipe, but, I usually do add more than what is called for. I will definitely make this again! It was a crowd pleaser!

I am constantly amused at the people who rate these recipes with changes. When someone adds chicken, carrots, peas, the kitchen sink and doubles the seasoning ITS A DIFFERENT RECIPE! Yet they rate their version with five stars. 

I made this exactly as written and it's delicious! My only concern is it looks a bit sticky (not creamy) after a night in the fridge. I'm sure a bit of milk stirred in will fix that. Thank you for this winner!

This needed some work to give it more flavor. I think next time I'll add some thinly sliced red onion. I did as I always do with pasta salad and that was to dice a couple of large Romaine leaves and add to it. We had this for dinner not as a side salad or side dish so after seeing how much it made without the dressing I kept the dressing separate so the lettuce wouldn't wilt and things wouldn't get runny and the 2 of us had it for dinner 2 nights in a row. I did have to take off 1 star due to the stated number of servings, that was way off.

Easy to make and tastes great! I have a tendency to eyeball noodles instead of measuring, which may be why only using one cup of mayonnaise made the salad a bit dry.  I would recommend adding 2 cups of the mayonnaise and be a little more generous with the milk as needed.  My husband loved this pasta salad and he rarely likes anything new.

I followed the recipe but wanted to add some personal touches.

Instead of cutting up a whole tomato, I used a pint of cherry tomatoes, cutting them in half.

In addition to the black olives (a small can of sliced ones), I also added a small can of sliced green olives.

I added a small head of broccoli florets, cut and uncooked and also an 8 oz. slice of a ham steak, cut into small cubes.  I'm going to try chicken breast or maybe shrimp on future attempts.

I also added about a 1/2 cup of Peppercorn Ranch dressing - I might try Chipotle Ranch next time to give it a bit more kick.

Finally, in addition to the tri-color Rotini pasta, I also added a package of Buitoni 3 Cheese Tortellini.

I meant to also add is some chopped green onion and some diced red, yellow and orange bell peppers, for both flavor and color, but I forgot them in my fridge, so I'll do that in the future.

Anyway, it turned out freakin' AWESOME and I'm   already being asked for the recipe, so.....

Loved this and I did nothing different.  First time I brought this to a gathering I was asked to share the recipe by quite a few.  I make it the night before , cook the bacon and put it on right before serving.

I was super excited to try this recipe unfortunately I was pretty disappointed. The ingredient list looked flavorful but I found it very bland and gloppy.  It needed some spice or pop of flavor and a thinner dressing to truly make it tasty.

This is a very simple and delicious dish.  My family really enjoys it.  I added a tiny bit of additional milk to ensure the mix was moist because it can dry a little bit after it sitting in the fridge.

I have made this several times, the family loves it.  It is delicious as the recipe is written. But tonight I made it again adding about half a chopped red pepper and a cup of small broccoli florets. These were great additions and made it a more substantial salad that can be severed as a main dish. Thanks for the recipe!

As I'm sitting here eating this ranch pasta salad leftover , I just had to comment on this !! We all loved it! Made it for dinner last night , huge hit !! Thanks so......much for this recipie !! We are a  pasta salad eating family and why we didn't think of this before , I'll never know . You can add other ingredients if you like but the basic dressing is awesome !! I used the shells and grape tomatoes, large can black olives( we are also olive lovers) frozen peas, as others recommended . Instead of frying bacon, used the Hormel real bacon bits !!  Added a cucumber and of course the sharp cheese , served the red onion on the side ( had some onion haters ) . Options are endless , add pepperoni , peppers, ect....  Thanks again !! Loved it !!

In place of the pepper you use, I just used cracked pepper, and in place of the garlic powder, I crushed a large garlic clove.  Next time I'll use 2 garlic cloves.  It's a quick and very good little side dish.

I followed the suggestion to double the ranch dressing mix and added the suggested bag of shredded carrots -- next time I'm only adding half a bag of carrots. The sliced olives I had came in a can half the size recommended ... and my family agreed that it was fine (with half the amount of olives). I will make this again, and again, and again.

I used Cherry/Grape tomatoes and sliced once. I made it for a PotLuck at work so i made it the night before. Before serving I added gouda cheese ( had on hand) and stirred in the bacon, to keep crunchy! Everyone Enjoy!

An absolute smash at my bunco buffet! Changes: I used 12 pc of bacon & did not chop it rather I cut it into bite size pieces with my trusty kitchen scissors.  I only used California Garlic (it has pretty little green herbs in it), 1/2 t and used only 1/4 c milk. I made it in the morning which allowed the flavors to develop prior to serving in the evening. It's a beautiful salad that could be used for any occasion and it will coming to my table again soon.

Additional comment: I made it again and served it warm as a main dish with a little butter added...yum!!!!

I am in the LOVE IT group. Can't believe someone said it didn't have flavor. I just made this again, I put some green pepper and red onion I had left over from something else in it. Was great again.

Um, yum! This is a keeper and a soon-to-be regular around our house. I made this exactly as written, the only thing I'll do differently next time is to dice the cheese into itty-bitty cubes rather than shredding since it clumps. Might as well make it chunky intentionally. Oh, and sharp cheese is totally necessary.

THIS IS AMAZING! It's flavorful and really easy to make. I use grape tomatoes and they go perfect being that my kids don't absolutely love tomatoes they can just pick them out. The bacon can be somewhat time consuming, but overall it makes an amazing dish!

Didn't have olives so I used sliced pepperchinis. I also used diced tomatoes in a can and drained the juice. It was a huge hit at our cookout, everyone  loved it!

We LOVED the recipe!  I loved the "suddenly salad" and hoped this would be similar.  I didn't have garlic pepper, so I subbed lemon pepper, and I really think that made the salad.  The lemon brightened up the whole dish!  SUPER taste, and even better the next day.  I wish I'd doubled it so we'd have had more leftovers!!!

I made a half batch of this last night for dinner and was amazed at how good it was, probably the best pasta salad I've ever had/made. The few things I changed were: 1) seasoned the pasta with salt AND garlic salt while it boiled, 2) seasoned the bacon with garlic pepper while it cooked, 3) added 1/2 cup (would be a full cup for a normal batch obviously) of both carrots and peas, 4) didn't use tomatoes at all since my daughter won't even touch a tomato, and 5) didn't add milk, which I didn't even realize until right before writing this review. Since I seasoned the pasta and the bacon, I did NOT add any extra seasonings besides the ranch. It was fantastic! I loved that that the ranch flavor wasn't over-powering. Maybe next time I'll remember the milk but I won't be upset if I forget to add it again. Definitely a keeper recipe!

Super good, especially is you love bacon and ranch as much as I do!  Beings the pasta comes in a 16 oz box I used it all and upped all the other ingredients by 1/4.. Never hurts to have more!!!

This is my favorite pasta salad recipe! I made it several times over the summer and one of my friends is now addicted to it ha ha. I cube the cheese instead of using shredded, and use cherry tomatoes but other than that I just follow the recipe and it is sooo amazing, thanks for sharing!

I added spinach and sun-dried tomatoes to make this a BLT salad. I used boxed mac and cheese instead of plain pasta because that's what I had. It was eaten with rave reviews!

Made this as a side dish for my nephew's 6th birthday and it received rave reviews from children and adults. I did change things up based on other suggestions and make a little healthy. Instead of using plain pasta I used veggie pasta. I substituted half of the mayonnaise with sour cream.  Replaced the garlic powder and garlic pepper with 1/2 tsp minced garlic and ground pepper and added a bag of frozen peas. And cubed the cheese for a different texture. Used Colby jack since that was what was on hand. Plus I only used 7 strips of bacon three disappeared before I made the salad.    Next time I will use buttermilk for the plain milk.

Love this Recipe!  Easily adaptable to what you have on hand. I always add carrot shreds, green pepper, red onion, black olives and cherry tomatoes to mine. (Love Pasta salad with tons of veggies)  I also half the mayo and substitute the other half with sour cream and I use fresh garlic.

I added one chopped yellow and one chopped red bell pepper, 1 bunch of green onions diced, 1 red onion, omitted the olives (personal preference), used roma tomatoes deseeded, sharp cheddar freshly shredded, doubled the bacon, and fresh garlic rather than powder. Turned out great and very colorful! Was a huge hit at the BBQ!

Allrecipes is my go to site for wonderful recipes.  Typically if a recipe has 4 or more stars and a large number of reviews I can not go wrong, this recipe is an exception.  I was looking for a different pasta salad and decided to try it.  I liked all the ingredients so I thought it would be good, it is not.  It lacks any kind of distinctive flavor and the ingredients did not blend well together.  It will certainly be deleted from my recipe box.

OMG!!!!!!!!!   Best pasta salad!  Didn't have olives or garlic pepper.  Had a half bag of broccoli slaw so added that.  CANNOT STOP EATING IT!!!  Took the advice of another reviewer and did half mayo and half sour cream.  Added a tiny bit of red onions.  Hope the family loves it as much as I do.

Love this!  Only change was that I used grape tomatoes instead of chopping up big ones.  One reviewer mentioned that it didn't keep very long, but I made it Sunday and ate it every day for lunch through Thursday.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

Made this for my husband's 30th birthday party. It was bacon themed (everything edible had bacon in it) and this was perfect! Everyone LOVED it and there wasn't a bite left at the end of the night! I was upset I didn't make more! It's delicious! My husband hates olives so I omitted them and it still tasted great!

My husband says this is the best pasta salad he has ever had!  Getting the bacon crispy is important and not overcooking the pasta.  Also, it is best to make the day before and add extra milk the next day as it absorbs the liquid overnight.

Saving this one!!  You can definitely change it to your taste, but my bet is the dry ranch powder is the key to this yummy salad, everyone loved it.  What I did different  was add a bit of whole grain mustard, chopped up spinach greens, used mini-bow ties to turn into a type of blt pasta salad.

This is difficult to rate. I had to make this the day before a party. When I made it I tried a small spoonful of this and thought it was good. After it sat in the fridge (well covered) for a day it was somewhat dried out and didn't seem to taste as good. I tried to add milk to fix the problem but it just didn't seem to help. I will keep this but only make it shortly before a party.

Really good!  Just like a BLT in a pasta salad!  We all loved it - the only thing I'd do differently next time is use real bacon (we used bacon bits to hurry things along - I think it would have been far better with crispy cooked bacon).  Thanks!

I really expected to like this as I love all the ingredients listed. I found this to be rather bland. Might be better if you just used ranch salad dressing instead of the mayo and dry ranch mix. I won't make again.

This was very good. I omitted the black olives because I didn't have any. I love that it wasn't swimming in mayo.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Delish! I added some cucumbers to it. Loved this. You can really change it up any way you want. Lots of flavor as is! I made the mistake of adding fresh garlic and it was overpowering.Will stick to powdered.

Very yummy- I added whatever veggies I had to use up and it just added more to it- it's the dressing that makes it- so you can change things up if you need to- I added a bit more milk as suggested since I added more veggies- delicious, thanks!

This is definately the BEST pasta salad around!  I've made this for just about every BBQ lately and everyone always asks for it again!  I cheat a little and use the real bacon bits and add a little Bacon Bacon (Tastefully Simple seasoning).  Soo good!

This is probably the best pasta salad I have ever made.  I made it as is, except I omitted the tomatoes, and I added about a cup of diced chicken.  It's a recipe that is easy to amend to your personal preferences.  I will definitely make it again.

I changed things just a little bit--used tri-color, little cheese-filled pasta--don't remember what they were called.  I thought that would be good, but wasn't as good as I thought.  Next time would use just the rotini as suggested.  The dressing left something to be desired, too.  Made it just as recipe said.  I added some blue cheese dressing I had on hand, and that improved it some.  Just was kind of bland before.  Think it could have used a little more tomato.  Maybe halved cherry tomatoes would be good, as they wouldn't become kind of mushed-up in the salad. Left out the olives, as that didn't sound good to me.  All in all was pretty good, but don't know that I'd make it again.

This salad was rated as "delicious" by my guests.  I did have to use chicken instead of bacon, because some of my guests only eat chicken and fish.  I also used grape tomatoes, one packet of dry ranch salad dressing mix, and one cup milk instead of 1/2 cup.  The salad did not dry out and was better the next day.  Can't wait to try it with bacon.

I made this because the highest rated comment said it was similar to the Suddenly Salads box mix which my husband enjoys very much.  He liked this recipe better than his box mix even though I forgot to add the cheese.  He did suggest that I add some broccoli and carrots next time to make this a bit heartier.

Chop cheese into tiny bits just to get little surprise bites of goodness along with the bits of bacon.  Also suggest using a pasta noodle that's not too slippery and will blend and allow the bits of ingredients to hold on (not sure which one that might be.)

Love this salad, especially for the summer. Great side dish. Only change I made was used green olives instead of black ones. Otherwise, followed directions as is.

I made this for a bridal shower this past weekend for 30+ people and I got nothing but complements.  I didn’t follow the directions provided, I more took the ingredients they suggested and did my own thing.  I used mini shell pasta and the buttermilk ranch mix in place of rotini and regular ranch mix.  I also used minced garlic instead of garlic powder and added chopped green onions also.  I’m not a fan of black olives or tomatoes so I did chopped black olives instead sliced and I was light on the tomatoes.  I also added more bacon than what they suggested; you can never have too much bacon in my opinion.  I’ve never had my husband tell me countless times that he thought something I made was amazing….so I’m taking that as I did a good job.

I liked this but I didn't love it but to be fair, I did alter the recipe.  I used 2/3 cup of greek yogurt and 1/3 cup of lite mayo, I just couldn't bring myself to put a cup of mayo into it.  I'm kind of picky with pasta salads and to me, this was decent although the other people who ate it really liked it.

This is a strange recipe.  I think the only thing I liked about this is that it had bacon & cheese in it.  My daughter loves ranch and she thought there was too much ranch flavor in it.  Plus, so fattening.  I like the box stuff much better, won't make this again.

This was very tasty, but we like more crunch in our pasta salad.  I added two stalks of celery and four green onions, but would add more celery and maybe a red pepper as well next time to add more crunch.  I used "Hidden Valley Ranch" dressing mix and a 28 gram pkg. yielded exactly 3 Tbsp.  The dressing and addition of bacon was very tasty.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Hope this is good, made it for lunch for tomorrow; I omitted the tomato (I have small cherry tomatoes to mix in before serving), I just threw in a package of real bacon bits, and I put in chopped green onion. I was going to put in peas too, but that probably would have been too much ;-)

I get a request for this for every family gathering. The only things i do different than the recipe is use the whole packet of ranch seasoning rather than just 3 tblsps, and i use halved grape tomatoes instead of a large chopped one.

This made an attractive salad but was a little bland.  Needed to add over an extra 1/4 cup of milk because it was so dry.  If I were to make it again, I would try adding more tomatoes and cukes.

Pretty good salad, but not amazing or anything.  I would make this again for an office potluck.

This recipe is very easy to make and tastes delicious! After reading people's comments I added more bacon, 1 cup of peas and left out the garlic pepper. Also, instead of mixing the diced tomato into the entire batch I kept it separate until I was ready to eat it - keeps the salad fresh longer. Will definitely be making this again!

Too much mayo.  Flavor not impressive ... and not worth the intake of calories!  Husband thought it was ok, which is why I gave it one star.  Took this to a potluck and ended up taking most of it home.  Will not make again ...

Everyone that ate it loved it..the only thing I changed was I used cherry tomatoes and Real Bacon Bits, added grated carrots and peas. It chilled for about 5 hrs and the flavor was really good. I also liked it because it was easy. Making it again this weekend.

This was a very easy, tasty salad!  Instead of frying bacon, I used real bacon pieces that were precooked.  Also, I used small cherry tomatoes in place of chopping one.  Yummy!

Love this recipe! Tried it on a whim after seeing it on the AR home page yesterday, and I am so glad I did. The only thing I did different was that I used a can of whole olives as I was too lazy to slice them, and I used a little cream instead of milk as I was feeling indulgent, lol. I also added just a bit of sour cream because it makes almost anything better, and even my son who typically hates ranch dressing loved it. Big hit in this family that I will make many times for sure.

I have made this several times now and it's absolutely delicious! We prefer grape or cherry tomatoes in it. Sometimes I'll add cooked chicken, it makes a great summer dinner.

I personally thought this recipe was just ok, but I am rating this from all my friends comments.  I brought this salad to one occasion and I have been asked to bring it every time since. I followed the recipe but went a little heavy on the bacon.

This has been my favorite pasta salad for a long time now. I like to add cucumbers that I've peeled, seeded and cut into chunks but otherwise I always follow the recipe exactly. I always get requests for a copy when I take it to a gathering.  Thanks Wilemon!

Everyone LOVED this!!  It was more than enough to feed 10 people.  I used 9 slices of bacon and probably could have gotten away with just 8.   I cooked them in the oven on a tin foil lined baking pan for 20 mins on 400 degrees.  The amount of ranch needed was exactly one packet.  So easy, so good, so crowd pleasing!!

Good recipe...I liked it a lot but wasn't totally impressed.  I think next time i'm going to use ranch from a bottle instead of the packet ranch.  Was a tiny bit dry.  Very good taste though, love the bacon with it.

The bold taste of ranch complimented by bacon and cheese is a winning combination.  Made this to take to a friends birthday party.  Unfortunately they ate every last bite; I was hoping for leftovers.  This is a great dish for a crowd and is a real crowd pleaser.  I used the precooked bacon for convenience and added a couple of pinches of dill weed to help accent the ranch flavor, but even without, you can't go wrong with this recipe.

Very good version of the Suddenly Salad Ranch and Bacon mix in the store.  I skipped the olives and cheese, but added frozen peas, and used real garlic instead of the powder (about 2 cloves).  Turned out good.  I think you can add whatever veggies you like to this.

We kept eating this after we were stuffed - it was delicious. This one made it to my recipe box after a long search for a good pasta recipe.

Delicious pasta salad! Made this for a cookout and it disappeared! Didn't add the garlic pepper because we didn't have any but I may try just plain pepper next time.  Will definitely be putting it into the keepers pile. Thanks!

This was very good, and I made a few changes - I didn't have ranch dry mix, so I basically mixed mayo with some ranch and Caesar dressing, plus milk and about a tablespoon or so of sour cream, although I don't know if the sour cream was necessary.  It came out to about a cup and a half.  To taste, I added chives, garlic salt, and black pepper.  I also added about 3 cups of diced chicken to it.  After adding the chicken and bacon to the macaroni, I mixed in the dressing, and then tasted and seasoned to taste, with a little garlic salt and some cayenne pepper, which adds a really good taste.  I don't remember if I added black pepper too, but probably don't need it at that point.  The dressing should taste a little more mayonnaise-ey than the ranch/caesar taste.

I tried this for a change from my usual pasta salad. I made the recipe as given with one exception.  I added green onion.  Although it was good, the boys cleaned the bowl, I still think it needed something?

Definitely an improvement on the traditional pasta salad, but I long for something lighter on the mayo. The salad flavor really improves overnight.

This is great! My hubby loves the packaged salad, but I never really cared for it. I really like this one. Thank you for giving us a compromise! Everything is BEST when it is homemade! I added shredded carrot and some frozen thawed peas, and some cucumbers. YUMMY!

This pasta salad is delicious!  I added a dash of lemon juice and some black pepper.  I only had bacon bits instead of real bacon but this was just as good.  I also didn't have any tomatoes or olives to add but would definitely add fresh disced tomatoes and some cubed cucumber next time!  Thanks for a great recipe!

All the guys at my husbands lodge just loved loved loved this salad.  I will for sure put this in the rotation.  The only changes I made was I added green onion and I omitted the cheee (by accident).  Thank you so much for the easy wonderful flavored salad.

Very good.  This is the first recipe I have ever reviewed.  Took this to my dad's house for Sunday dinner and I could not stop eating it.  Taking it to my inlaws tomorrow.  I am sure it will go over well there also.  Love the combination of flavors and the creaminess.  I did not have any problems with it being dry the next day as some have mentioned.  To me, it was better the next day.  YUM.  Looking forward to trying and rating more recipes.

Pretty tasty, however it was too salty. I felt the recipe calls for too much mayo. I will reduce the amounts of mayo, bacon and garlic next time. That should reduce the saltiness in my opinion.

This is an amazing basic recipe to play around with. I've used both tricolor and whole wheat pasta when making this. I also added peas and double the sauce because it's that good. This dish received rave reviews when I recently brought it to a potluck at work.

I didn't get the chance to let this sit, so I'm betting it will be better once it does.  However, at the moment it tastes a bit too mayonaise-y for me.  Bf thought it was fine.  I don't have olives (I'm going to have to remedy that ASAP!) so I didn't put them in.  Instead, I used kidney beans, which added protein (great bc this was dinner for us tonight) and color.  I think it definitely needs those olives, though.  I used the rest of my whole wheat rotini but didn't have 12 ounces so I supplemented with cheese tortellini.  Worked pretty well.  thanks for the recipe!

The olives were overpowering, if I make again I will definately omit, hoping it would taste much better without.

although i'm not a huge pasta salad fan, this was excellent.  i substituted ranch dressing and cut back on the mayo.  i also added 1/2 tsp of ground mustard for a little extra tang.

Everyone else loved this, so I am giving it 4 stars.  I didn't like the black olives in this though.  It added weird flavor.  I think if you left the olives out, this would be a winner!

I love, love this pasta salad. I tend to leave out the olives and tomatoes. It is so easy as a make-ahead dish and I just use a little splash of milk the next day to get it ready for serving. What a crowd pleaser!

This was very easy...and very tasty. I forgot to add the cheese...and it still was yummy.  (I'm seriously asking myself how one forgets to add cheese???)  I may use a bit more ranch seasoning next time....and remember the cheese!!!

This is a really good summer salad, I added extra bacon because who doesn't like more bacon??? I also used Wacky Mac because I couldn't find tri color rotini. I guess I'm not a fan of green pasta and next time I will use all plain rotini. But that's just my taste. YUMMY

fabulous!  I took it to a potluck and it was a hit!  I am making it today to take on a camping trip.  I added a bit of milk to the ranch to make it a bit runnier and easier to coat the pasta.  I also added some finely chopped onions to add to the many different flavors.  we will definitely make it again.  Instead of using mayo and dry ranch I just added ranch dressing.

Good pasta recipe.  I actually thought it would have more flavor w/ the bacon and ranch, but those flavors didn't pop out as much as expected.  Still very good though.  Maybe the fake bacon bits would bring out a little stronger flavor??  Maybe try it next time.

This was very good, but a little heavy on the ranch for me.  I took the advice of others and added some green onions, thawed peas, and extra tomato.  Lightened it up a little and was great!

Very good stuff! I served this at my 4th of July cookout and it was a hit. I omitted the tomato, because we don't like them. Other than that, followed recipe exactly. (Well, I didn't use colored pasta!) I made this the morning of the cookout, and when I went to serve it, it was a bit dry. So you may want to add a little milk to it and give it a stir before serving.

This pasta salad is so good, my husband who refuses to eat cold pasta eats this!  I made it for a 4th of July BBQ & everyone loved it!  Everyone there requested a copy of the recipe!  I used cherry tomotoes cut in half & bacon ranch dressing.

Delicious and easy!  That's all I needed and exactly what I got from this recipe.  I used Light Ranch dressing because that's all I had and it was more than enough, I also didn't use any olives because not a lot of people like them.  I also used grape tomatoes and it was suggested which made it even easier to make.  Great recipe!

Very good-seemed to be a big hit with the kids.  Did seem a little rich to me after a few bites though...may experiment with some lighter ingredients next time.  If you love bacon-you're gonna love this salad.  Much better than the boxed version and very colorful-perfect for a potluck.

What a great easy salad- I had to come home and make more as everyone kept going back for more and none was left to snack on. I made a few changes- I used real Bacon bits and fresh garlic- other than that, will make again and again

A good picnic pasta salad.  I used 3/4 reg mayo and 1/4 light, next time I will try 1/2 and 1/2 because I don't think you can tell the difference. Skipped the olives and used whole grape tomatoes.

OMG Delicious!!!  I couldn't get enough of this salad.  I used thick cut "smoky" tasting slab bacon.  I added extra bacon and made 1 1/2 the amount of the mayo/milk/HVR mixture, (but I always make extra sauce when making a salad with mayo, as the pasta soaks it right up.)  Everyone loved the salad!

Great salad that everyone liked, even the kids! I used a whole jar of Hormel Real Bacon bits and nobody new otherwise. I used medium cheddar cheese and I cubed it very small rather than shredding it. I also made the salad early in the morning which did allow all of the flavors to come together. I will be making this again and again. Next time my husband suggested I use Pepper Jack cheese which will be just as good I am sure.

Very good. Next time I think I'll leave out the cheese. I don't really think it brought much to the meal. I also used a pack and a half of ranch dressing mix instead of just one because it didn't taste "ranchy" enough for me with just one. I'll definitely make this again.

My all time favorite pasta salad!  It's a must have during the summer when going to the lake.  I always double the recipe, but leave the amount of ranch the same.

Very tasty!  I added fresh garlic, rather than powdered, and ordinary black pepper as I don't have any garlic pepper.  I will definitely make this again.  Rinse the pasta in cold water after cooking to stop it sticking together.

The only change I made to this recipe was to add some red onion. The dressing tasted very very salty, but didn't taste salty once I added it to the pasta. The pasta soaks up the dressing right away, ended up having to add additional ranch dressing from the bottle. I was not impressed with this at all. Took it to a neighborhood bbq, one person said they loved it, no one else mentioned it, which means it wasn't a keeper in my book... If I was to make this again, I would add way more bacon, 10 slices wasn't enough...

Yum! Everyone loved this pasta salad. I used an entire package of ranch dressing mix and extra garlic, because I love garlic! It did get a little dry but I just added extra milk. Wonderful recipe!

I was going back and forth between 3 or 4 stars for this recipe.  I decided 4 stars because it is a good pasta salad.  But like a lot of others said after refrigeration it really gets thick and dry.  Which normally a lot of pasta salads do that after refrigeration anyways.  So right before eating we made more sauce and mixed in to make it creamy again.  I liked this but I have had better pasta salads that I prefer over this one.  I might make it again for a family get together sometime.

I would have given this recipe 5 stars but after a couple of hours in the fridge the dressing was completely soaked up and it was rather dry. If you add milk to loosen it up you lose the flavor, I suggest reserving some of the dressing to toss the pasta salad with before serving. Also, if you are not a huge fan of bacon, I would add some bacon bits instead of freshly cooked bacon because it is a very strong flavor in this dish. Overall it was pretty good and I would make it again with those modifications.

I don't normally like pasta salad, but I have to admit that this one was really good.  I didn't have time to make the bacon so I purchased real bacon bits.  I'm sure the regular, crispy bacon would have been better and I'll try it next time.  I would also add a bit more mayo, as I think I would like it a bit more wet.

I really loved this recipe.  I read all the other reviews and tried to implement all the other reviews suggestions.  I added, broccoli, red pepper, green onions, cherry tomatoes, and omited the cheese. I didn't have garlic pepper so I added more garlic powder and used black pepper. I made sure I cooked the bacon in the microwave to make it extra crispy and right before mixing I added the bacon.  So a great recipe if you plan to do this for a party and this allows you to make it a day before, but just don't mix it until the party.  I think next time I will add more veggies to this dish.  Thank you for the recipe, everyone loved it!

This is a wonderful quick and easy side dish.  I assembled it differently though.  I made buttermilk ranch dressing according to the dry mix directions the night before. The next day I made everything else and then laddled the ranch into the bowl of pasta. I kept all the ingredients the same except for the above part. Wonderful.... and sooo good...

I had shell macaroni so I used that, I doubled the recipe and had only one package of ranch salad dressing so I used that and one package of ranch dip, I used a 4.3 ounce package of bacon pieces, no olives.  It was GREAT!  Next time, I think I won't put so much bacon, though.

This was pretty tasty, but I wasn't crazy about how dry it kept getting. I had to add milk a few times to keep it creamy. I did use grape tomatoes, as suggested by the recipe submitter. Good idea, as cut tomatoes would gotten soggy after a while. I did forget to add the shredded cheese, but I didn't miss it. Next time (yes, I like this enough to make again!) I will remember to add the cheese though! Thanks

I'm only giving it 3 stars and it's probably my fault.  I used reduced-fat mayo and turkey bacon. So if anyone else wants to go that route I don't really recommend it, at least the bacon.

So good. I used regular rotini, which worked great. I also used the real bacon bits that you put on salad instead of cooking my own and it was absolutely delicious.

This inspired me to make ranch pasta salad.  I used cheese tortellini, bacon, tomato, black olives, cheddar and red onion.  Used ranch, and forgot to add spices.

Made again 4/15/11 per the recipe. Everyone loved it!

If you like you like the suddenly salad bacon ranch pasta you would like this recipe way better.  We don't care for the red peppers from the box salad so this is way better.  You can add anything you want but it is fabulous salad! - UPDATE - I make this salad regularly, following the dressing ingredients as-is but changing the add-ins. I've replaced the bacon with pepperoni (yum!) - I've even made it with just the cheese, pasta, and dressing and it's still delicious.

Fabulous!!!  Alterations: Had no bacon so I used left over Christmas Ham (seared on skillet & chopped), used Radiatore pasta (they're just too cute and ruffled not to), chopped the olives, and fresh ground black pepper instead of garlic pepper.
WILL MAKE OVER AND OVER, thanks for sharing!

This recipe is great but I personally like to make more of the dressing because if you only use what is called for you will end up with a rather dry salad.  It has a great combination of flavors though and I will definitely make it over and over!

What a great pasta salad!  I used pitted kalamata olives cut in half in place of the black olives and added some chopped red onion.  This is one of the best pasta salads I've ever made and I've made a lot of them.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I have made this so many times and add cheese, lots of cheddar and I use 2 ranch dry mix packets instead of 1.  So yummy - try it you won't be disappointed.

Nice change from the regular pasta salad.  I only used 4 slices of bacon, which worked out fine.  I swapped out regular milk for half-and-half and omitted the black olives (not a big fan of them).  I was asked for the recipe from several friends.

Next time around I may just add the rest of the packet of dry ranch mix just for a little more ranch flavor, but this pasta salad was absolutely great and everybody gobbled it up.  Thanks for the recipe!

EXCELLENT recipe! Tastes like the boxed salads you buy in the store, only WAY better! I added a little more milk as you suggested, so it wouldn't be so dry. It was PERFECT! Thank you soooooo much for sharing your recipe, Wilemon!!!

I thought this was really good, but overall way too salty.  I've made the Ranch & Bacon Betty Crocker boxed version for years, and this is just like it, only better with a fresher flavor.  I love the concept of making my own, but I would definitely have to do things different to reduce the salty taste.

I made this for a church social and it got rave reviews!! I used pre-cooked bacon so all I had to do was nuke it until crispy. I also followed another reviewers suggestion and added sliced zucchini and grape tomatoes. I have since made it a few more times for a quick meal for me and my husband....the left-overs are great to take to work for a light lunch!!

This salad was just OK. We are great "Ranch" lovers and everyone thought the the salad was a little bland. It also got dry quickly and I had to add more dressing to freshen it up. Would probably not make it again without some major changes.

This was delicious!  I added half of a cucumber and a small bottle of artichoke hearts with some of the juice and used grape tomatoes as others had suggested.   Will definitely make this again.

My children are beyond the realms of picky eating, so when I made this, I omitted the olives and tomatoes.  I can't believe it, but they ALL loved it!  Fantabulous!  Definite hit!

This is a great recipe. I've made it serveral times for family parties and everyone really enjoys it. the only changes I make is that I wait until I'm serving the salad to add the seasoning/mayo/milk mixture...otherwise it gets dry.

I have made this a few times now and really enjoy it because it is so simple to make and it's a little different to other pasta salads.  I use Paul Newman's Ranch Dressing instead of the mayo and dry ranch, because I live in Australia and we only have the one brand of ranch bottled dressing here.  I also use halved cherry tomatoes, giving it a prettier presentation.  Hubby actually commented that he really enjoyed this salad, which is a huge thing as he doesn't tend to care about any type of salad.
This will be a regular this summer for me.
I have also made this with fried onions added, giving it a great flavour.

Yum!  I made some modifications, because we don't like olives and tomatoes...(Yeah, I know, then why are we trying this recipe, right?  haha!)  Anyway, I substituted some diced red pepper and red onion, kept everything else the same, and the result was delish!  I had some fall-leaf and pumpkin shaped tri-colored pasta and it was really pretty...not that we sat and stared at it, it was all eaten pretty quickly!

Everyone here really liked this a lot. I used regular elbow macaroni and didn't have black olives, but it still was great. I'd like to try it with the tri color spiral pasta and olives next time. This was sure a big hit with our bbq brisket, and different from the same ol' potato salad or cole slaw.

Three words for this recipe...YUM, YUM and YUM. I just love a pasta salad, and this one is exceptional. The grape tomatoes really make it, and although I don't normally like olives, they work here  (I just use a little less).      Thank you, Wilemon!

I made this recipe without the olives, due to my husband not liking them, and this salad was very good. Better than buying pasta salad from a box.

Oh my great pasta salad gods 

Probably one of the best, yet simplest pasta salad I’ve ever made!! I did add about 1/2 cup of sour cream for that cream dressing punch!! This is definitely being added to my collection

This has become our new favorite salad!   I've followed the recipe pretty much but use a pound of bacon and also add one 10 oz. can of white chicken meat, diced, and 3 or 4 chopped green onions - and didn't use garlic pepper.  We don't have 4.25 oz. cans of black olives here, so I either use one 3.8 oz. or two 2.25 oz. cans.  I think the recipe is spot-on using sharp cheddar cheese.  I've become a fan of using sharp cheddar when mixed with other ingredients, but prefer mild if I eat it plain.  This is a very tasty dish, and my husband loves it.

Excellent. I don't use the tomato or olives. I added in green onion, cucumber, peas and matchstick carrots. This last time I added shredded chicken. I've made it twice now and it's a big hit.

Big hit at a recent party.  The only complaint I got was to cut back on the bacon.  Some thought it over powered the recipe.  All in all it still is super tasty and I will make again!

Used this for a work picnic and it was an absolute hit! Everyone LOVED it and continuously asked for the recipe. I did alter it a little by omitting the olives and adding grilled chicken. I also used ranch dressing in the place of the mayonnaise so it had a ranchier flavor. 10/10, will definitely make it again.

This was delicious and filling for a light summer meal. I've made some adjustments like using half a tomato and two slices of bacon. I accidentally forgot to add the milk into the mix, but I add it later on and it made the mix smoother. I have enough for leftovers this weekend. I would make this again for sure.

This is our favorite pasta recipe. I added a little green onion and omitted the salt. The bacon and mayo have enough salt to balance out the flavour. We use the recipe  from this site for our ranch mix it also has salt in it.

Made it for family visit and it went quickly. I thought it needed a bit more sauce or something to "zing" it up. Easy to make. I will make again but I always like to tweak recipes when I make them. This time I followed the recipe except no black olives (one member hates them). Next time I will add something to add a little zest.

This recipe definitely needs extra garlic powder, I added garlic salt and a little sea salt.  I used 1 packet of ranch dressing and really think it would have been better with 1 1/2 packets.  I did add my bacon right before serving so it wouldn't be soggy as other reviews indicated and I added more milk since it became a little dry after refrigerating overnight.  Good taste overall!

We loved this salad! It's easy to make and perfect for potlucks. We varied it a little by using liquid ranch dressing and freshly ground pepper. it's also easy to double the recipe if you're cooking for a crowd.

Everyone loved this. They even asked for the recipe! I used bacon bits and cherry tomatoes (quartered). I did 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper since I didn't have garlic pepper on hand. I made this the night before our get together so I mixed in a little milk before serving to get it a little creamer since it sets a little when made the day before.

My first attempt at pasta salad.  Took some time and I definitely overshot it on the portions, but it tasted great and got quite a few compliments.  If I ever make pasta salad again this is definitely the recipe I’ll be using.

I would make it again, but I would separate the recipe into two bowls and only put olives in one of them.  :-)  I don't like olives but used them anyway.  I found that were others who did not eat it based on the olives or picked them out.  However, there were also many that loved them so I'd rather appeal to both groups and split the output.  My wife loved it and had it for lunch twice.  I did modify the tomatoes to using whole grape tomatoes as the original author suggested after modifying it herself.  I agree that made it hold up a lot better.

I did not have olives in the pantry and added diced red onion. So easy to make. Creamy dressing, crunchy bacon and red onion. Very delicious. My family loved it. This dish is perfect to take to a potluck. Thanks for the recipe.

Good.  I'll probably make it again.  My family loves pasta and I try to have a variety.  It seemed a little lacking in veggies, so I added a little minced onion and chopped green pepper.

The directions said add more milk if it seemed dry after chilling in the refrigerator. I added some milk but it became soupy. Next time I would mix some mayonnaise with a little milk, stir to combine and then add to the pasta so it is not so soupy

DE-LISH! My 4yo likes it too! I boiled about 1/3 bag frozen peas and carrots with bowtie pasta,  used a whole cup milk(perfect amount of sauce), added broccoli instead of olives and used red onion which is what I had on hand. Soooooo good! Next time I'll add carrot and sunflower seeds and also try a version with egg!

I love a recipe that can be tweaked based personal taste and what's on hand. The first time around I used the large shell pasta and it made it hard to mix without the shells sticking together. Last time I went with rotini and it was easier to mix and make sure everything was coated. I'm not a fan of olives so I chopped some pepperoncini up and added that. I also used some of the juice from the jar to the mayo mix. Next time I'm going to try a Buffalo growing version using blue cheese and some chicken cooked in wing sauce.

Excellent. Changes I made: Used Baby Red Potatoes, quartered and cooked for less time until tender. As other reviewers said, celery addition was great for crunch. I used less onions and Bacon bits from jar. I added alot of dried dill weed and S&P.

This gets 5 stars for taste but only 4 for presentation. I get so used to cooking warm noodles for other pasta dishes I kind of forgot melted gooey cheese on a summer pasta salad did not look great. Next time I will chill the pasta salad and stir in cheese right before serving or else rinse the noodles in cold water before tossing with other ingredients. Basic step with a pasta salad I just forgot.  However several kids came up to me and said they usually don’t like pasta salad but liked this one. Unsolicited compliments from kids say a lot!  No one likes olives in our group so left them out

I made this dish for Thanksgiving and it came out amazing! The amount of ingredients added to this dish was added based on taste, not measurements. I substituted real bacon for turkey bacon, and I did not add the milk because that would have made the dish soggy. I used liquid ranch dressing instead of the packets because it was more convenient (I already had some in my fridge) and it was cheaper (no need to buy extra ingredients if I can improvise with what I have!). I also added a little bit of chopped red onion. The black olives really made the pasta salad give it its unique taste. The time it took to make this dish was reasonable as well (especially since the bacon had to be cooked), so if you're looking for a good, healthy meal made in a short amount of time, I would recommend this dish!

The mix of flavor explodes in your mouth! Even better the next day.  Great recipe. Can this recipe be frozen?

Skip the dairy and I use Olive Garden dressing.  This coats the pasta so it retains the flavor.   Refrigerates well and tastes great.  I do this with all my salads because this dressing has the most flavor.

l loved this! Super easy to make. I didn't add any tomatoes because my family doesn't like them. I also didn't add garlic pepper because I forgot to grab some at the store! But even modified, this recipe is great!

Excellent is all I can really say here. A bit of spicy mayo might be nice if someone wants a little extra kick to it.

Simple and delicious.  Made it twice in one week.  Once for a picnic where it received rave reviews, and the second time for my finicky son.  I made it just the way the recipe was written.  A keeper!

As is, it's a 4.  Lots of options though.  Half mayo, half sour cream definitely.  Half buttermilk, half milk.  Use your imagination on this recipe.  Very good basic ingredients to start!

I read a lot of the reviews and took a couple of the suggestions especially the one that the developer (Wilemon) made about using Grape tomatoes instead of chopped and someone else suggested reducing the milk to 1/4 of a cup. I was extremely happy to discover that our Kroger in NW Ohio now carries Duke's Mayonnaise so I no longer have to order it online.
The dressing was nice and creamy and at a consistency that I prefer for a pasta salad. This is a a keeper and my husband is going to love it with our Juicy Lucy burgers tonight!
Thank you so much for posting the recipe!
UPDATE for May 2018: I doubled this recipe and took it to a group function as I was asked to bring a "pasta" salad. It made enough to fill my 13qt mixing bowl and by the time I went to go see how much I was going to have to fit back into my fridge at home, much to my surprise the bowl was empty.
Thanks again for this winner at parties and gatherings!

I have made this several times and every time it's a hit! Outdoor cookouts (I double the recipe) and family nights, I haven't met a person that doesn't  like this salad. Sometimes I use a couple of green onions just for something different, but it's great the way it is!

I made this pretty much as directed. I used 1 large can of whole black olives, giving them a quick, rough chop. I used a container of grape tomatoes, slicing them in halves and quarters. I did add a handful of rotisserie chicken to make it a more filling meal. Delicious!!

This is very good.  I had to substitute onion for the garlic due to an allergy and I left out the olives because I don't care about olives.   It was delicious though and a nice change from my usual pasta salad.

This was really good! I substituted garlic salt instead of garlic pepper. I am one of those who don't salt their pasta water so I thought using garlic salt instead would add some seasoning to the noodles. I also added in some artichokes as well. Oh, and I mixed half milk and half cream in it besides just only milk. Really creamy and very tasty. Will keep this recipe in handy. Thanks!

I made this and added cauliflower and instead of bacon, I used chopped ham. I also added 2 boiled eggs, chopped up. I didn’t have garlic pepper, but I just used regular pepper. I didn’t need the milk. Tastes great!

I used 1/2 tsp fresh garlic instead of garlic powder and omitted the garlic pepper.  Was very good!   Didn't seem like it needed any changes, however, for fun I think I might add raw broccoli and sunflower seeds in the future when I go to ladies' events- this was a family event so for that I think it's better without those things ;)

Definitely let this sit overnight, the flavor becomes so much more intense! Took this to my boyfriend's family Thanksgiving and it was a hit! Only things I changed were adding some more olives (because I love them!) and a little salt/pepper. Definitely making this again!

Loved it, great hit at the BBQ. However I did make one change. Substituted red pepper for the tomato. It was delish.

Made extra dressing, thought it was a little salty so I added a touch of Karo Syrup. Added the dressing the morning before serving it. It was a hit at the Fibers of Love lunch.

How can you go wrong with bacon and ranch dressing? This worked perfect for a Halloween party by using Halloween shaped pasta.

This recipe is perfect as written. I've made it several times that way and sometimes I add in a thawed bag of cold frozen peas. Really good both ways! To the reviewer that called this unflavorful mayonnaise pasta, you're delusional and sound extremely arrogant. This pasta salad is absolutely delicious!

This is the second time I made this. I thought it needed a zing so I substituted the garlic powder and garlic pepper with a dry zesty Italian dressing season packet.  Wow it gave it a nice kick. Cheers

I only used 2 T of the ranch dressing mix due to the saltiness. Next time I'm going to try 1/2 c mayo and 1/2 c bottled ranch dressing. I made this for a cookout with friends and everyone loved it!

I have made this recipe several times and we LOVE it. I do make several changes just to make it a bit healthier. I use turkey bacon that I cut up and cook, a 1/2 cup fat free plain greek yogurt and a 1/2 cup lite mayo. As for the cheese the cheddar is the best, but I normally have shredded cheddar jack on hand so I use that.

Who doesn't like ranch and bacon? I have made this twice for potlucks and everybody loves it. The only thing I do different is I use cherry tomatoes instead of cutting up tomatoes. That way the dressing doesn't get runny. Yummy!

A local deli made a spinach pasta salad but very seldom. This is that salad without the  spinach. I added the spinach and yum yum. The ranch dressing mix with the mayo and milk is the mix instructions. This is delicious but I might just try Ranch dressing next time just to see if it stays the same or just isn't right. I would prefer not to use package ingredients but if the taste changes with the dressing I will use the packages. This taste is just too good to change it.

I've never had a pasta salad quite like this! It would make a wonderful side dish for burgers and brats.

Ed says it's very good but he still prefers Italian style pasta salad.

I've made this twice. I tell my family the first time is an experiment. I used cherry tomatoes the 2nd time and we usually have thick cut bacon on hand but I bought regular bacon for it. Delicious! My teenage son doesn't generally like pasta salad unless it's sweet and even he said "that was pretty good" which is saying a lot. I will use this over and over again.

Very good--great flavor combination, except for the tomatoes.  The tomatoes (I used whole grape tomatoes) added nothing.  I ultimately picked them out of the salad & discarded them.  I also used Hormel Real Bacon Bits for a timesaver, and used 1/4 c. sour cream along with Miracle Whip salad dressing.  This is a wonderful salad option!

This was a hit.  Great recipe.  I made it for a large event and the only problem is many people didn´t try it because they don´t like black olives.  So if I make it for a large crowd again I might leave out the black olives.  I thought it was perfect as written.

My husband requested this salad. It has become one of our favorites. The first time I made it I didn't add enough bacon. That really made the difference the next time I made it. The salad it light but very filling.

So tasty.  I made it with dill ranch dressing and that was good too.  You can also change some of veggies you put in.

Unlike other reviewers, I will not award 5 stars unless perfect as written.  Only a minor change, however.  As is, the flavor is somewhat bland.  But  a little cayenne and/or pepper flakes bring it to a whole new level.  Brought this to a party and everyone loved it (I had added the pepper before hand.)

This is just a tad salty and dry or I'd be giving it 5 stars.  I made a batch and a half for a family bbq.  I only used 1 can of black olives and 13 slices of microwaved bacon cut into chunks.  I made 2 times the dressing amounts and added a touch more of the ranch mix (which I shouldn't have done).  I did have to add about another 1/2 to 2/4 cup of milk to make the dressing creamy enough four our tastes.  We will have again when we want something different.  Kids liked this better than the adults, although everyone ate it.

You are all crazy!!  This is the most discussing salad I ever made.  Not not person liked this salad.  I followed this recipe exactly as the directions said.   I will stick to my own pasta salad going forward.  I make a mean pasta salad that is by far better than this one.

I've made this recipe and love it but recently I've switched to a no carb diet. I substituted the pasta with shrimp and it was awesome, the only thing I'd do different is use a low sodium bacon,but otherwise it's a great recipe

This sounded so delicious that I wanted to try it, even though bariatric surgery means I can't eat pasta. So I substituted chopped up rotisserie turkey instead of pasta. Wow, delicious!

This is now a family favorite and more than 1 household now makes it often. For mine I do not take the time to fry bacon. I keep a big sack of costcos real bacon bits in the freezer and dump a bunch in a pan and heat them up a few minutes and throw them in the salad. No fuss no muss.

I didn't add as much milk as suggested. It seemed to get a little dry after refrigerating, so I will add the suggested amount of milk next time. I thought it was good and had compliments.

I really like this salad. I'll make it again for sure.  I bought a container of hidden valley ranch seasoning at Sam's.  It's easier than opening packets and it's the same stuff. I think it was $6 but you get an awful lot.  Also, I was almost out of mayo, so I used 1/4  cup mayo and 3/4 c sour cream just a dash of vinegar. The sub worked fine. You can add any veggies you want to this; I added very small cauliflower pcs to it.  My only critique would be that mine came out a tad bit on the salty side.  It was one of those cases where someone would think it's fine another person would say it's salty but both would love it. Have fun with this one for sure.  Experiment and add!

This turned out quite good. Even my wife and sister-in-law, very particular eaters, liked it. Made it the day before and freshened it up with some sour cream when ready to serve. It went very well with smoked pork ribs.

I made this for a church event, and it was well-received.  The only minor change I made was to use a bit more garlic powder and a little regular pepper, because I didn't have any garlic pepper.  However, I wish I had had time to see whether there was a dressing mix, or some alternative ranch dressing, that did not contain MSG.

This had to be the worst pasta salad I ever had.  It was terrible.  The flavors were overpowering, and just terrible.  My family did not like it, I threw most of it in the garbage, and I will never make this again.

Even though I changed the recipe quite a lot, I feel the basic recipe is great. I needed to make the salad gluten free so I used Romaine lettuce instead of pasta. I added about a cup of thawed frozen peas. I went with half sour cream and half mayo. I used cherry tomatoes cut in half. I added a couple of sliced a couple green onions. Other than that, I followed the recipe. The salad was enjoyed by all.

I found it had too much mayo taste. I will try it again with a different mayo as it may have been the brand.

I decided that garlic times two is too much......one or the other is perfect amount. I chose wisely by using only the garlic pepper.....as it sits, the garlic powder and added garlic from the garlic pepper, can become overwhelming, both in smell and taste IMHO......but this is not only a keeper, and to be used for all the get togethers you can make it for, but make just because, it's delicious, delectable, delivery, to serve just the family. I served this on crisp romaine lettuce bed, and sliced fresh tomatoes on the side, and pita chips. 
As a side note, if you take corn tortillas, or flour tortillas, and spray with Pam, turn a large muffin pan upside down, and place tortillas over each cup, press slightly, bake till golden brown, about 15 minutes at 375/350, remove, let cool, and place pasta salad in each one, and serve with tomato wedges in side of each, it's also pretty and delicious and no dishes to wash.

I used Hidden Valley Spicy Dry Ranch Dressing mix.  Used Cherubs (Halved) for the tomatoes and used shredded mexican cheese instead of cheddar (not a sharp cheddar fan)...and this was a very, very good pasta salad.  Had to add a little more mayo and half/half than was called for but that's Ok.

We absolutely loved this salad. We added lots more vegetables - cucumber, onion, broccoli, peppers because we love fresh vegetables. The 2nd time we made it, we cut the ranch mix to 2 tablespoons and liked it even better.

My sweetie saw the recipe and wanted to give it a try. Meaning for me to do it. I followed the directions and was very pleased with the outcome!

And since we are onion lovers I added some scallions, which really made it pop.

This is now our all time favorite. I can't wait to be invited to a function because this is what we will be bringing. Thanks so much for sharing.  Quite Tasty!!

i put half bacon and half pepperoni, and instead of dry ranch use the actual dressing so 1/4 ranch and 1/4 cup mayo with 1/4 tbsp pepper and a pinch of salt with onion freshly diced thats alot of flavor but not to much of it.

Great recipe! I used ranch dressing from the bottle because it's what I had on hand and added some oregano. I also used shell pasta because out of what I had I thought it would be the best. Didn't want to make a run to the store. Everyone liked it including the kids.

If you love bacon and ranch you'll probably love this. Bear in mind how salty it's going to be also. I used no milk and might have used slightly more mayonnaise than the recipe called for because I prefer my pasta salad a bit more dry but cohesive. Overall a good, easy recipe and great taste if you enjoy the main ingredients. 

Next time I might try adding chopped spinach, one more tomato and a package of spinach dip spices instead of ranch.

Very good salad. I used macaroni noodles, as that is what I had on hand. I didn't have a tomato and forgot to add the cheese, and it still came out great. I added a finely diced stalk of celery, a small handful of shredded carrots, a few diced green onions and about a cup of edamame. Delicious!

This is a very good recipe base! I use half the mayo and replace with sour cream for the rest of the base. We don't care for tomatoes or olives, so frozen peas and diced carrots go in. A big squeeze of lemon juice helps freshen this up as well. I also add in chicken or shrimp, depending on what we have around.

This is such a fantastic salad! I made a few adjustments...first make it the night before, all the flavors set in and it gets nice and chilled! The recipe says 10 slices of bacon, I even doubled it and 10 slices was more than enough (I got my bacon from the butcher, nice and thick!). I used sweet cherry tomatoes and cut them in half. I only used 6.2oz sliced olives and it did just fine. Lastly making the salad the night before, it does get a bit dry, right before I left for my event I eyeballed some milk and mixed it together again and it did just fine!

OK couple changes just to zip it up a little. I diced and added some red onion, red and green bell peppers and a good TBS of Dijon mustard. My family really liked it but it was a little on the dry side so added Ranch Salad Dressing instead of the milk.

I made a few changes to the recipe... I used real bacon bits, and instead of 1/2 cup of milk, I  blended in some of the bottled Hidden Valley ranch dressing, as well as the packet mix and just a splash of milk.  I omitted the tomatoes and used mozzarella cheese.  I would have to say it was amazing and a major it at my cookout.

I wasn't sure how far ahead to make this: would all the dressing be gone, leaving it dry, if I made it the day before? Well, when eaten the day it was made it was good, but we all agreed it was even BETTER the next day! The favors really melded, and more chilling definitely improved it. My mother-in-law, who can be particular, asked for the  recipe. It's definitely a keeper. The recipe makes a lot, ideal for bringing to a barbecue or potluck.

This pasta salad earned rave reviews! I'm making it for a potluck next week. Plan to add milk before serving especially if making ahead. I put the bacon in right before serving.

We love, love, love this recipe! It's easier than you could imagine and it's a million times better than anything from  a box! I do make a few changes based on my taste and to incorporate more veggies for the kids on the down low! It's a go to for cookouts, cook ins and when I want my husband to think I put real effort into dinner! Lol.

I halved the recipe since we didn't want a large quantity. I like the taste of the salad but instead of possibly needing to add more milk after chilling I think I would make the "full" dressing recipe and still halve the rest. Or next time I might use an appropriate amount of ready-made ranch dressing instead of making the dressing from scratch.

Didn't change a thing, other than to add red and yellow bell pepper and some frozen peas. Excellent recipe; much better than the Suddenly Salad version.

I love the ease and the flavors of this recipe - but I didn't have the correct pasta. I used an organic Casarecce, and the pasta was somewhat overwhelming. Still, I loved the flavors, even though I substituted an orange bell pepper for the black olives. Will try this one again with the tri-color rotini!

I received more compliments on this than any side dish I've ever made. Done pretty much just as the recipe listed (maybe a little extra bacon). Samples of comments "best past salad I've ever had" "[husband] told me last night that he was thinking of your pasta salad".

LOVE this recipe. It is my go-to for pot-luck dinners, and there are never any left-overs. Great to make in the summertime, and eat chilled with nice crackers and a glass of wine.

Was not a big fan of pasta salad until I made this. If you are so inclined to try a modification, add sweet pickle chips. It was divine.

Made this for dinner on a hot day and the first thing my family said was it tasted like a BLT salad.  I thought it needed more ranch so I added it .  It is very good.  I also added some chopped green pepper for a little crunch.  Will certainly make it again.

I think this is okay as it is written, but I did find it to be quite bland. I wound up adding extra garlic powder, salt, pepper, and bacon, and I still thought it just didn't have any oomph.

I wanted to try my own ranch pasta salad instead of buying the boxed kind and I love it!!!  I omitted the black olives and reduced the bacon to six pieces and even my pickiest eater loved it.  I will definitely share this recipe and make again.

Made recipe exactly as written. Good but needed something for my palate so I blanched a cup of fresh  broccoli florets and added them before refrigerating. Let chill for several hours. Was delicious! Even my picky daughter-in-law had seconds. Thinking leftover chicken could be chopped and added. Served it with grilled chicken for dinner. Will definitely make again.

This came out tasting pretty good but I should of halved the recipe. I didn't notice it makes 10 servings until now. Since there is only two of us I'm afraid the leftovers will be dry and tasteless before we finish them.

I absolutely love this recipe! This is the second time I have made it and it's become a family favourite. I didn't have garlic pepper but regular black pepper worked just fine. I used the Club House brand for the dry ranch dip although I would have liked to use Hidden Valley. Next time, I think I will add in green onions just for more flavour.

Very good!  My husband ate more than I thought he would, he kept coming back to refill!  Since we both don't like olives, we used chopped red bell pepper in place of it.

We found this to be very tasty. We used grape tomatoes as that was what we had on hand, we did clean out the fridge a bit and added some green peppers, green onion & added a bit more bacon.  We also followed some of the reviews to add a bit more seasoning  & fresh garlic over the garlic powder. All in all I think this will be the go to.

This is good.  Don't skimp on the bacon.  That's what you want to taste.  I added sweet peas and chopped onion, as someone suggested, and that was good.  Don't add the olives or bacon until ready to serve or they lose some of their flavor.

This was just okay.  You definitely need to leave it out if you make it ahead of time since it becomes a big block.  The taste was okay.  The bacon is definitely needed since it's the only flavorful ingredient.  Not sure I'll make it again.

I made this for a family get together.
I followed the recipe since it was the first time making it.
It turned out well. Not your normal pasta salad which is what I liked about it.
However, next time, I won't put in the black olives as I've never been a big fan and I thought the salad was a little salty with them in it.  After a while, that's all I tasted.

I made as directed (definitely added milk as necessary to keep moist), but had a cookout where it hardly got eaten.  Thought maybe it was the crowd, but served it the next day for family (added mayo and milk) and still a dud.  Tasted too salty to me.

Great dish to have on those hot summer days here in Florida. I am a complete novice at cooking, so this was perfect for me as its quick and easy. The only deviation I made from the recipe was to add Shiitake mushrooms, mostly for a different texture.

I made it the first time using everything according to the directions, but added green grapes.  What a refreshing taste!  The second time I made it I used the Marzetti's Creamy Ranch dressing since I didn't have any of the dry ranch. I thought it was better with the creamy ranch.  I also added the grapes again, too.

Great, but next time I'll cut back on the pasta by at least a third and keep dressing the same.  I added green onions and frozen peas.  Really crisp bacon is better than Costco bacon bits, but can sub in a pinch.

The ranch mix I used, combined with the bacon and the kalamata olives I used, made this a bit salty for us.  We'll eat it up and it's good, just not fabulous.

I made it and followed the recipe to a T and it was just delicious. After I ate a couple of servings I thought it would be great if I chopped up my grilled chicken from 2 days ago and I did and it was still great. I'm going to wait until 2mah and see if the flavors marry a little more and I think it will be even better

Love this recipe.  I was a looking for something I could easily add to my husband's packed lunches that would help keep him full during his 12 hour shifts,  and I think this will do the trick.   I used Penney Reigate instead of rigatoni because that's what I had on hand.  Also I made only a half recipe because I didn't need 10 servings.  I added some chopped fresh parsley,  between 1/4 and 1/2 cup, and 1/4 tsp  garlic powder total and freshly ground pepper.  I find that when using dry ranch seasoning it takes time for the flavors to develop so that could explain why some may think it bland.   Adding a can of tuna, salmon,  or even shredded chicken and serving it on a bed of spring mix would make a great light main dish option for when you don't want a heavy meal.

Made this for a work potluck, and it was quite popular. I will suggest though, to add more mayonnaise. Even before it sat in the fridge overnight, there wasn't enough to coat the noodles. I tripled the mayonnaise amount after all was said and done.

Made this w/ a few changes but stuck pretty close to the plan...  I used thick cut turkey bacon (5 slices, 10 is a little much),  added some grilled chicken and sun-dried tomatoes but I'm sure cherry tomatoes would work great too.  Added in a little Parmesan and good to go...

This was a great salad, though I did make a few changes. I needed a pasta salad for a baby shower, and wanted something that wasn't tart or called for vinegar, as I'm not a fan. I came across this and I'm so glad I decided to give it a try, despite some of the critical reviews. This was a definite favorite at the party!

Things I changed: No olives, Cavender's Greek Seasoning instead of garlic pepper,  1 package (pint) of cherry tomatoes sliced into quarters,  added 1/8 tsp of pepper, added just a little more mayo. 

Tips: Make sure your bacon is crisp and dried of as much of the grease as possible (chop the bacon while the pasta is cooking). Boil the pasta for 2 minutes, then turn the heat down to med-high and cook for 10 minutes (let it cool while you mix the dressing). Slowly add in the milk (I stirred it in at about 1/8 cup at a time, got the mixture smooth, then repeated). Mix the pasta/tomatoes/bacon/cheese in a casserole dish. Spread the dressing evenly over the pasta and let sit overnight. Mix together before serving.

This recipe is AWESOME!!! I've made it 4 times in the last 2 months, everyone loves it. I accidentally picked up dry Ranch dip instead of dressing, used 2 pkgs as others suggested and it is so flavorful. Thank you, thank you, thank you for this recipe.

This pasta salad was over the top, genuinely one of the best I have ever tasted. I mistakenly left out the olives (even the can was sitting right there) and the salad was wonderful without them. I saw some avocados' on the counter and diced them up and tossed them in. I taste as I cook, so I know it could stand alone with out them but they were there. Wow, did the avocado put it over the top!  Tomorrow I am going to add some olives to the left overs, if there is any left! LOL!!

I followed recipe directions but omitted the bacon  and added chopped red onion - about  1/4 cup -  delicious and simple!  I will make this again.

As written, this recipe didn't do a lot for me.  I will not make it again - that way.  I would rate it only 3 stars, but that's more a matter of personal tastes than any flaws in the recipe.  The recipe combined with some ideas from the reviews has allowed me to create my own recipe that I love, and any recipe that can be the foundation that I use to create something wonderful is worth 4 stars in my book.  I add diced chicken, omit the olives, increase the tomato, and add lots of other fresh veggies, such as celery, green onions, grated carrot, cucumber, bell pepper, and broccoli.  By the time I've added all that, I need more dressing, so I make 1 1/2 recipe of that.  I haven't decided yet if I like it best making the dressing with just mayo or half mayo/sour cream like some reviewers suggested.  Do make this a day ahead for flavors to develop.

This pasta salad is the Bomb!!! It is by far the best recipe I have tried!  
I made a few minor changes such as mincing fresh garlic instead of the garlic salt & pepper ( the ranch mix has plenty of salt anyway!)  I chopped a beautiful cucumber into the dish & because who doesn't love bacon...I added the entire 16 oz of applewood smoked bacon.  
Heaven in a salad!!!

I absolutely love this! I did make a few modifications though, I added parsley, smoked paprika, and onions it turned out amazing. I also added my personal favorite dried red pepper it gives it a nice zing :-) each one of my addons or not measured they were just done to taste but overall this is great and tastes just like that stuff out of the box and it's cheaper to make :-) the time may take longer but it's totally worth it. Thanks for your recipe :-)

This went together easily,  and I followed the directions exactly, but I didn't like the way it tasted at all. The dry seasoning gave it a powdery taste.

I thought this salad was really good.  I used cherry tomatoes and bacon bits though.  It was so good right after I made it but after leaving it in the refrige overnight, it was dry and I added more milk but it wasn't as flavorful.

Excellent.  I sauté some garlic in a little of the bacon fat and add that to the mayo/sour cream mixture and don't add milk.  Otherwise, make it as written.

I modified the mayonaisse, added crushed basil leaves and a little bit of mustard instead of garlic powder and ranch dressing mix.. fried the bacon on garlic, so the garlic flavour remained in the fat. It was yummy :)

I was actually surprised how much I did not care for this.  I followed the recipe exactly other than using cheese tortellini instead of rotini pasta.  I did not like the sauce.  It tasted exactly the same as if I would have just poured a bottle of ranch dressing on top, which was just strange to me.  It tasted more like salad that was missing lettuce.  

I will definitely make this again using a DIFFERENT kind of sauce base, either a vinegar/balsamic sauce or more of a regular pasta salad/mayo type that is thicker and doesn't have such a strong ranch flavor.  And I like ranch dressing.

We liked this. I added a few small pepperoni (quartered).  I chose to leave out the tomato to make the salad last a bit longer in the frig. We can always add tomatoes at the table. I used regular and lite mayo together. It is a versatile recipe.  Thanks.

If you like suddenly salad you'll probably love this.  Not as flavorful as some we make, but still good. Followed recipe except used cherry tomatoes halved, and after a day in the fridge I removed them to replace with fresh as they were mushy. Also added a little milk for day 2.

Amazing the first time I made it.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The second time I made it I added a few things because of personal preference and it came out to be the best pasta salad I ever had.  I added one avocado, a bag of real bacon bits instead of cooking the bacon, and 1/4 a pound of chopped hard salami.  Everyone loved it, and someone asked for the recipe.  Ill never make another pasta salad again.

This was fantastic. Usually people don't eat pasta salad, but I took this to a BBQ and it was all gone.

Made this for the first time this weekend, and it was AMAZING. I subbed grape tomatoes for the regular tomatoes, as I was worried about the salad getting watery. I also didn't want it too garlicky, so I subbed coarse cracked black pepper for the garlic pepper. If I could rate it 10 stars, I would. Thanks, Wilemon!!

Oh my!  This salad is fabulous!!  I have tried many, many variations on pasta salad over the years, and this one is tops.  I usually follow the recipe exactly as written, but if I'm in a hurry I'll use Oscar Mayer bacon bits instead of cooking up some bacon ... still tastes delicious.  This recipe is a definite keeper.  Thanks, Wilemon!

Love this recipe.  I make it a lot, and tried one little variation.  Instead of black olives I add frozen peas and it is well received!  Love the original and my little twist.

So, I was looking for a recipe to duplicate this pasta salad at the Safeway deli - this does a good job.  I altered just a bit by adding finely diced celery and green onions.  I ommitted the black olives and swapped cherry tomatoes for the chopped tomato and used Hormel Real Bacon Bits instead of pan frying my own.  I let it sit overnight and then added more milk the next day to loosen it up before serving.  It was a hit at the 4th of July BBQ!

Made it twice now and turned out great.  The only adjustment I made was adding an additional tomato and did not add olives - but those are only personal preferences.  I'll be adding this to my list of things to bring to potlucks.

This is a really good base recipe.  I used buttermilk ranch from a packet and added buttermilk rather than milk for tartness.  I also used grape tomatoes.  Where I really deviated from the recipe was the addition of a heart of romaine, shredded.  It added great, and much needed, crunch and it cut the saltiness.  As I made it, it was great, but I really needed that crunch to get it to five star status.

This is really good for a change of pace pasta salad. I did make a few changes based on what I had on hand. I used penzey's ranch dressing mix, buttermilk instead of milk, added peas(frozen baby peas) based on someones review which I think added to the flavor and texture of the salad. Omitted the black olives.

Very good, and very adjustable, made this for my son's band banquet it was a hit! Had to omit olives to appease some, so added tiny diced green onion and crumbled the cheese to give a bit of color and texture.  
easy tip - cook the bacon on a cookie sheet at 325-350 while you prep the rest, saves work and splatter :)

If I could give this 3 1/2 stars, I would. The only change I made to this was that I omitted the black olives, simply because I didn't have any. I thought this was good but, it didn't blow my mind. Flavors work well together. This tasted like the type of salad that you would find in a potluck. The kind that was pretty good and would be gone before the rest of the other dishes. Don't know if I would want to make this again anytime soon but it wasn't bad at all.

This is my go-to pasta salad recipe!  I've taken it to work barbecues, wedding receptions, potlucks, you name it, and there's rarely ever any left to take home.

I do think its better if you make it the day before, though.  It seems better if its say in the fridge overnight.  I think all the different flavors have a chance to come together and it makes it all the better!  SUPER YUMMY!

This was a big hit at a recent party.  I cut back on the bacon a little bit.  I also used some Kalamata olives because that's what I had.  I used cherry tomatoes, sliced in half.  Will make again.

Easy and so delicious.  Loved the dressing.  I made as written, and added a few more diced veggies that need to be used up, some carrot and red pepper.  Perfect with our grilled sausage sammies!

This is really good and it has kind of a greek taste to it which I love. I left the tomatoes out because I don't like tomatoes but soooo delicious. Make sure you use real bacon and not imitation bacon bits!

Awful lot of bacon for the taste.  We found it kinda bland. We probably won't make it again, but thanks for the recipe!  The flavor for all the ingredients just didn't do it for us.

Best pasta salad ever!  The ranch flavor & the bacon were awesome.  I used my own, homemade dry ranch mix, and didn't have any tomatoes.  But I threw in some chopped orange bell pepper and some chopped kale that I very quickly sauteed in the leftover bacon grease.  YUM!!

This recipe was great!  I did use sharp cheddar cheese and skipped the olives but is was really good.  May try a bit of parmesan next time but it might be too much to a recipe with a taste fest already.

The recipe neglects to add the pasta. I do it when I have the bacon, tomato etc in the bowl and then toss to coat all with dressing.
This is an excellent salad and I have made it for four different events this summer

EASY AND YUMMY!  A total win in my book, great crowd pleaser.  I added lots of veggies too! Plum tomatos, celery, pepper and summer squash.  Great to expand on.

I don't like ranch dressing, but I like this salad.  I made it exactly according to directions minus the olives and used cherry tomatos since I have a garden. Even my sone liked it and he is a picky eater. Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely make it again. I also love that it was very easy to make.

I just made this after seeing it as 'Recipe of the Day' yesterday. Delicious!! I read the reviews and made a few changes...i used 1/2c mayo, 1/2c sour cream, 1 packet ranch dressing mix, other seasonings as directed in recipe. I used a shortcut and used real bacon bits. Added frozen peas and a little more olives, cheese and tomatoes (whole cherry tomatoes). My family is raving about it!

We really liked this. Just minor changes like doubling the spices, replacing some mayo with sour cream, adding green onions, and omitting the olives. I had planned on cubing up the cheese but my husband felt the cheese shouldn't be added.

I found this to be very salty in flavor, to the point of not eating it because it was too salty.  I've re-read the recipe multiple times but having followed it to a t I was quite disappointed.

This pasta salad is so simple someone with no cooking skills could manage it!  I use actual ranch dressing instead of the dry mix and add a little dill in with it for added flavor. The bacon I use is from our own pigs, so there is nothing better than that!  I also add a little red onion for flavor.   I find any type of pasta will work.  It makes a great summer dish!

Day 1:  found this recipe.  Day 2: made recipe as-is and it was GONE.  Day 3: made another batch, but remembered I was out of bacon, so I cut up smoked deli turkey and liked it even better!  (I didn't use quite as much milk as the original recipe called for either time.)  KEEPER!!!!!!

Awesome pasta salad! I used fiesta ranch instead of the traditional eanch packet and it was excellent! I read the reviews prior to making and it definitely needed more of everything (olives tamotoes) I also added onion and minced garlic! Excellent!

This is my favorite pasta salad recipe!  I have used it for potlucks, showers, and cook outs! It's super prortable and looks very appetizing. I use the jars of bacon pieces (not bacon bits)  as the perfect short cut.

This is a great easy salad.  I usually make a double batch.  I do a couple of things different,
1) I mix the ranch dressing as directed on package which adds another 1/2 cup milk.
2) I put ranch dressing on the chilled pasta the night before.
3) I put the cheese, olives, tomatoes and bacon bits on the side so people can add if and how they like.
I recommend you use the tricolor rotini or plain rotini because the mouth feel and texture make a difference in my opinion.

This is a personal favorite. I've made it a few times already.  I add a cucumber to the salad. I also add some red pepper powder and a dash of lemon juice to the dressing. SO GOOD.

This salad is amazing!! I omitted the bacon (only because I'm pregnant & don't like the smell of it right now). I added 1/2 cup of shredded carrots & substituted 1 Tablespoon of the dry ranch salad dressing mix with the "spicy ranch" flavor, then used the the regular for the remainder of the 2 tablespoons. My 10 year old LOVED this salad, so I'll be making this again & again!

We enjoyed this recipe and found it easy to prepare, and was really enjoyed when we took it to a potluck dinner.  We did find it salty though which is usually not a problem for us.   ***making it a second time we added 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts and made it into a meal

This is the BEST pasta salad that I have ever eaten.  I used an entire envelope of ranch dressing which was a little under 3 tablespoons.  I may cut up cherry tomatoes next time instead of chopping up a tomato but that's just my preference!  WONDERFUL!!

This pasta salad was AMAZING. I have made it the regular way several times, but tonight I decided to use the spicy ranch mix, and added some southwest crispy chicken to make it into an entre. It was perfect, and we had no leftovers :)

I'm not sure why, but we really didn't care for this.  I like all of the ingredients that go in it but it seemed very dry to me.  Was worth a try, though!

I enjoyed this pasta salad. For my daughter's first b-day party I bought a bacon rance pasta salad from the deli at Meijer and this was better than that. I did have to make some changes just because I didn't have enough mayo for a full cup so I did about 1/4 cup mayo and the rest sour cream. I used the real bacon bits and didn't add the olives because I didn't have any. I used the whole envelope of ranch dressing. will make this again! Maybe add some chicken next time...

My family and I (including a typically picky 3 year old) quite enjoyed this! Definitely not "everyday" food for health reasons, but great for a potluck or family BBQ. I shared it with a colleauge who also enjoyed it a lot! Thanks for sharing it!

This was great!  I used shells and precooked bacon (which I microwaved and put in the fridge in a ziploc).  I mixed the crisp bacon in and then crumbled it in top right before serving.  Definitely a do again recipe!

This is very good, much better than the boxed stuff.  I mixed the pasta and "dressing" and let it sit in the frig. overnight.  Before serving I added the bacon and cheese and a bit more bottled ranch dressing so it wasn't dry.  I did omit the tomato and next time I will crumble the cheese.  Everyone loved it! Will make again and again.

Very easy and so much better than the box stuff sold at the grocery store.  I use bacon bits to save time and it  is delicious, just don't put them on too soon or they become soggy.

Really tasty! Cooking the bacon for a pot luck-sized portion does take awhile, but the results are probably worth it.

I didn't have a tomato and I didn't want to add the salt from olives so I just chopped up 4 cups of broccoli, carrots and a red pepper and added that.  It was really delicious!

I really like this salad. I did a couple of different things. I used plain rather than tricolor pasta and I used grape tomatoes. The tomatoes were easier for my children to pick around that way. Several people mentioned that the salad seemed drier the next day. If you add a dash or two of milk and stir well before serving that will loosen it up. Much better than what's in the box! Update! I now use the tricolor pasta and add some green onion too! Love it!

I would have given it a 3.5 if possible. To be fair, it wasn't that this recipe isn't good but rather that my husband loves the box pasta salad so much, he remains faithful to it and the way it tastes instead. I think it may have been more of a texture issue because it kind of got creamy and stuck together. Like I said before, it is honestly a tasty recipe, but being creatures of habit we sadly prefer the box recipe just slightly.

Pretty good, I was asked to bring it to a potluck after my mom had it at my place. I used gresh garlic and instead of the mayo and milk and powdered dressing I used Newman's Own Light Ranch to the desired consistency. I also add more veggies, pepper and cucumbers.

This was a big hit at the Football party!  I don't think I added enough milk, however, as it turned out a little dry.  Just keep that in mind while preparing the salad.

This is pretty good.......but then again what isn't with cheese and bacon in it.  Next time I will use less of the ranch seasoning powder - pretty salty for us. I used 1/2 regular mayo and 1/2 non fat mayo and I just quartered up some cherry tomatoes instead of dicing up a whole tomatoe. I will make this again.

This recipe is a hit! My pregnant friend can't get enough of it! I added cucumbers to the salad and sour cream to the dressing. Make sure that you add the bacon before you serve so it retains it's crunchiness. Other than that it's a keeper!

I think that this is a good base recipe, and can really be altered to fit anyone's tastes.  We're veggie lovers here, so we omitted the olives and added a handful each of onions, celery, and green pepper for some added veggie flavor.  Also laid some sliced cucumbers on top for a little extra fun... Cooked chicken would have been great in here too, I think we'll try that next time!

Very awesome!  I used Hellman's olive oil mayo and used organic Sunday bacon that I cooked that morning with my pancakes.  This was a huge hit at my party.

Really easy to make and everyone loves it. I find it a little bland if you don't add Lowery's or something...I also use cherry/grape tomatoes whole so that people can either pick them out or it won't gunk up your leftovers.  Definately go with bacon bits over real bacon - the flavor comes thru more.

I thought this was fine but not great.  It was too dry so I had to add more of the dressing.  I could not find garlic pepper so I just increased the garlic powder a bit and added pepper.  It still had an overpowering flavor of garlic.  The tomato wilted too fast also and I saw that people were picking them out.  I don't think I would make this again.

this salad turned out really dry. i made it the night before i needed it, and wish i would have brought some extra ranch dressing or something. it just wasnt creamy like i expected. the flavor was good though.even though i came home with more leftovers than i would have liked i think i will give this recipe another shot.

AHH, just ok. I actually didn't have enough ranch as the recipe called for, you need 2 packets to get 3 tablespoons. And w/ not enough I thought is was too ranch tasting.

I made this for our block party this evening...it was a huge hit! I kept hearing people say "Did you try this salad...it's the best"...Music to my ears! I used elbow macaroni, rather than tri-color pasta, and I added diced red onion. I served in a trifle dish, with the cheese and part of the bacon on top, which made an attractive dish. I'll definitely be making again. Thanks for sharing!

Excellent pasta salad!  It was really good after being refrigerated for two hours, but it was fantastic the next day.  I didn't need to add extra milk, the amount of dressing was perfect. The only thing I might do differently next time is to add more tomato.  Thanks for a keeper, Wilemon!

AAAAA++++++ Recipe. 
This will be a regular, the only thing I do different is use ready made bacon(12 slices) I just take it out of the box and cut it up with a pizza cutter, and toss it in. Thanks for the recipe

I decide I would try this for lunch and made it a day ahead. It didn't make it that far. My kids who are usually soooo picky and won't ant anything, went after this like ravaging wolves. I made it just as is with exception of the olives. Needless to say I'll be making this again.

I made this for a cookout my family and I were hosting...it was gone in NO time. I did not add the tomato or the olives because my kids do not like it. Also, I used colby jack cheese instead of cheddar because that's what I had on hand. Excellent! My kids love pasta salad and they are begging me to make this again.

Yum!  This is a nice change from traditional pasta salads.  Great flavor.  The only change I made was to use skim milk.  It wasn't fully chilled before dinner was ready and still tasted great.  Whole family liked it--even the "picky" ones!

Love this salad.  I have made it a few times and I am just now getting around to reviewing it.  I always make it the same, but occasionally throw in some extra veggies.  M family loves it as is, but last time I made it I threw in a diced avacado, and that was a HUGE hit. I also use pre-cooked baco and that is a big time saver.

A great lunch option. I took it to work and my co.workers loved it. its very quick and very easy. But it does get dry. I made this at night and chilled it in my fridge overnight and by then it was too dry. so i mixed a little more milk in it before eating it.

We liked this, but I used turkey bacon instead of the pork, to try to save on fat/calories.  Big mistake.  I will definately use the real stuff next time.  Weird texture & taste to me.  Also, I used more of the ranch dressing per other reviewers.  I am glad I did.  Very good pasta!

This was a pleasant change from the typical oil based pasta salads I've made. I didnt have any olives on hand so I added some celery instead. I'll definetly make it again, but next time I'll try adding more veggies.

This was pretty good. I followed the recipe exactly and my only complaint is that it was a little dry.

Second time making this one- subbed ranch dressing for the milk and added chopped tri-color peppers and green onion. These changes made all the difference.

This was an okay recipe.  I didn't have tomatoes so I used a red pepper.  I also added green onions.  My husband who dislikes ranch dressing really liked this dish.

I made this for a covered dish luncheon and it was a HUGE hit!  I didn't have the tri-colored rotini so I just used regular rotini.  I also used grape tomatoes (sliced in half) instead of a large tomato (chopped).  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks for the great recipe, Wilemon.  This is definitely a keeper.

I found this to be pretty tastey.  I used turkey bacon and a little less than 3 Tbs of the dressing mix.  I also used diced canned tomatoes that were on hand, and only about 2/3 of the can.  I did not use the olives, I thought of this salad as some sort of blt, minus the lettuce, so I didn't think the olives sounded so good.  Leaving out the olives also cuts down on the salty issue that others were mentioning.  As a side dish at a pot luck it isn't too bad.  My family is not a big mayo fan so I wouldn't make it JUST for my family, we would never eat all of it.

Yum!  I used canned tomatoes and didn't use garlic pepper.  I made it for a get together and everyone loved it.  It's a really good alternative to the usual cold salads.

We are hooked on this! We added zucchini and a bit more cheese.
