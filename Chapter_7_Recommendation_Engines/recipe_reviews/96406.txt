Very good, great flavor.  Quite easy to whip up.  The kids picked out the peas (of course), but loved the rest of it.  The sauce was a bit thin (as somebody already mentioned) but didn't seem to bother anyone.  Thank you!

Definitely a comfort food. Tastes great- kind of like chicken noodle soup. Very heavy though... My boyfriend loved it!

This recipe didn't work for me.  The sauce was thin and lacking in flavor, ruining the entire dish.

Easy to make and I liked that it was a "from scratch" type of recipe vs. alot of prepared ingredients. But the sauce was thin and overall the recipe was bland. I will try it again but maybe add a canned soup to make it more flavorfull.

My husband and I thought this was delicious!  It was pretty easy to make - I used leftover turkey breast. The sauce seemed too thin, so you could thicken it up some.  I didn't and it worked out ok.  I added bread crumbs on top along with the cheese.  My small kids didn't like it, but they are picky! It made the house smell good, too!
