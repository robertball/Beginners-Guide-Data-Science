Excellent.  I've made this twice in the crockpot and learned a few things.  You do have to cover the meat with the liquid or the parts not submerged will get bitter.  It took two cans of Guiness to cover.  Do add the seasoning packet for more of the traditional flavor.  Also, cut the fat off the one side before cooking or the flavor won't get in the meat as much and it'll be a bit on the fatty/greasy side.

Next time I may be brave and try one can water, one can Guiness since it seems expensive to use two cans.

Don't forget the brown sugar (light/golden worked fine for me) and the seasoning packet - it all goes in there!

***COOK CORNED BEEF IN (I repeat, *IN*) THE BEER***

This is such a fantastic recipe, I can't even begin to tell you, but the most important thing is to actually cook the meat in the beer-- this not only infuses the meat with the flavors it's soaking in, but it also makes it unbelievably tender. Last year I cooked it in a big pot and added the veggies the last hour-- my husband and his friends were making fun of me the entire week beforehand because they thought I would "ruin" St. Patty's Day by going out on a limb... boy, were they shocked when it turned out so good that they're actually REQUESTING it this year!... my husband has been looking forward to today for the last month! This year, I plan to use my new crock pot since it's been my experience that meat gets even more amazingly melt-in-your-mouth the longer you cook it... Give this one a try!

(I've never written a review before, but this recipe is so good, I felt compelled to spread the good news and dispel any doubts others have had!)

I wish I could give it 10 stars. I was very nervous about making this since it is not the norm. I made this for st. Paddy's day for a true Irish family(my husbands) and they loved it ( I also did the boiled corn beef just incase). His father (from Ireland) said it was the best corn beef he ever had and he truely enjoyed it. I even loved it and I am not a big fan of corn beef. The beer is not strong and the brown sugar is just perfect. My husband wants me to cook it this way all the time. Thanks so much for the recipe. Will make again and again and again. I did boil the cabbage and potatoes in a different pot since I didnt have room for them. The carrots I did with the meat and wow. I recommend everyone to try it this way.

Wow! Very good! My first time making corned beef and it’s so easy and tuned out so wonderful! I made it with a 2.5lb flat cut corned beef brisket and used 1 can of Murphys instead of Guinness, cooked in a slow cooker for 6hrs. (Note: Murphys is similar to Guinness but not as bitter and strong as Guinness, it’s the Irish stout that I prefer. If you don’t like Guinnes try this recipe with Murphys!) I rinsed the beef under water (too bloody!), trimmed fat off and coated with 2tbsp of brown sugar then placed it in the slow cooker. Poured the stout into a bowl, then I added the spice pack came with the corned beef PLUS additional spice (peppercorns, allspice, cloves, thyme...etc) to the stout than poured the mixture into the slow cooker. At 2.5 hrs before eating, I put on "High" and added 6 halved red potatoes, 4 chopped carrots and 1 chopped onion. I added the 1 cabbages, cut into wedges, 1 hr before eating. This came out just perfect, the house smelled wonderful while it's cooking! The beef were so tender, all the vegetables were a bit over cooked so I'll put them in for shorter time next time or just cook them on low(?). I also made the "amazing Irish soda bread" from this site. Highly recommended!! Please give this a try!

This recipe MUST be cooked in a slow cooker, on low, all day  if you want it to be juicy and tender!! Make sure you buy Flat cut corned beef instead of Point cut too. I've made it a few times and the meat just falls apart.

The second time I made this I added a 1/4 cup of whole black peppercorns, 2 cloves garlic and 2 bay leaves (remove bay leaves prior to serving) and cook per the instructions.  Absolutely fantastic and definitely better than the written recipe - Make sure your beef is covered and for those wondering, the flat cut works best for this recipe!

Absolutely delicious!
I put in a crockpot on high for 8 hours. Added red potatoes, carrots, and onions with 3 hours to go, then cabbage with 1 hour to go.  Will definitely make again. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a terrific recipe.  I read all of the other reviews, and (with very few exceptions) the only complaint I read was that it's too tough.  This is purely a function of how long you cook it; cook it longer, and it gets more tender.  Here's what we did... we didn't bother putting the corned beef on a roasting rack.  Instead, we put the corned beef, sugar, and guinness in a dutch oven (yes, the meat was sitting right in the beer).  We put it (covered) in a 300 degree oven, and then every 45 minutes we turned the meat over.  After two hours, we added cabbage and potatoes, and then let it go for another 1.5 hours.  When we were done, the meat was a little tough, so we cooked it for another 45-60 minutes.  When we were done, we had the best corned beef we've ever had.  Usually we smother our corned beef with mustard and our potatoes with ketchup, but we needed neither with this delicious (and ridiculously easy) recipe.  It's slightly sweet, but really nicely flavored.  Enjoy!

This is now the only way I cook corned beef. I also cook it in a crockpot. It is easier and comes out so tender. Make sure to not use the spices that come with the meat - just use the brown sugar and Guinness.

Been a member for a LONG time- and until recently have never rated/reviewed.  THIS IS AWESOME.  I make this several times a year (in the oven). Someone wrote it MUST be in a slow cooker on low all day? Mine has been great following the directions ... (but obviously, a low slow may be the way to go).

WONDERFUL! We've been an Irish family forever and never baked a corned beef. This is the best way ever! I covered the pan with foil and halfway through removed it turned the beef on the rack a few times and eventually removed the rack, finishing the cooking in the stout. You MUST use a thin cut of corned beef. Never was dry. Exceptionally perfect. Have a cold stout ready for your meal, too.

To the person who said cooking in the oven was too dry. Just wanted to post that I've made this recipe for the last few St. Pats and do it in a turkey oven bag.  I also slather the C.B. with grain mustard and cover it with the brown sugar. Pour the beer into the bag, seal it and give a few pokes to bag for vent holes.  This is the BEST way I've ever cooked C.B.  Just a note - we did "corned beef 3 ways" last year at our party to do an actual taste test.  The oven baked beer version was gone so fast I didn't get any. The crock pot was so-so and the boiled version had lots left over.  It's a winner!!

When I submitted this recipe years ago, I was afraid no one would try it. I have used many suggestions from other cooks as I "tweak" every recipe I have.
I believe that the way to go now is to cook the corned beef in my dutch oven. Put the meat directly in and let it cook in the Guiness. It gets better every time I make it!

OK, first of all, anyone who knows anything about meat at all knows that for corned beef you do not cut off the fat layer, that is where you will get all of your flavor from.  You need to use the season packet, again this is how the beef gets it's "corned" flavor.  Also, you can not cook corned beef in an oven for 2-1/2 hours at 300 degrees and expect it to come out tender.  So, you must either use your slow cooker and cook it all day or in the oven for a much longer time.  I am so not a Guiness person, but I have to say that flavor of the beer and the brown sugar complement each other very well.  Rubbed on the fat layer and slow cooked puts such a nice glaze and flavor to the meat.  I also added the minced garlic as suggested by another reviewer, very good.  Next time, I will not use the store bought meat, I will cure my own as normal and then put it in my slow cooker for the day.  Over-all, this is a keeper, thanks.

DON'T PASS THIS UP BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT A GUINNESS DRINKER.  The flavor is very mild. My husband didn't realize from the taste that the meat was cooked in Guinness.  

I have never made corned beef before but I am a true Guinness lover so this seemed appropriate.  I did NOT use the seasoning packet that came with the meat.  Instead, I added some whole allspice, juniper berries, whole peppercorns, and some cloves to the Guinness per the suggestion of another reviewer.  I got a bit carried away with the cloves, but other than that, the flavor was fabulous.  An hour before the end, I added quartered potatoes, some baby carrots, and a whole vidalia onion cut into large chunks.  I spooned out some of the liquid and thickened it with some cornstarch for gravy.  Everyone loved it and it made GREAT sandwiches the next day.  I cooked it at 300 degrees for roughly five hours.

I do corned beef and cabbage every St. Paddy's Day and this, by far, produced the tastiest and most tender corned beef. I put it in the slow cooker as follows: a layer of thinly sliced onion, a layer of brown sugar, the corned beef, another layer of brown sugar and 2 bottles of Guiness poured over all and left it for 9 hours on low. I did flip it over half way. The sauce it made is a bit bitter (just like Guinness!) so I cooked my carrots, potatoes and cabbage in a pot with 3 parts water to 1+ part of the Guinness broth from the slow cooker. Delicious...this will be my preparation method from now on!!

I make this every year for St. Patty's Day. I put onions, potatoes, carrots and cabbage wedges in bottom of the crockpot and then place the corned beef on top. I pack the brown sugar all over the meat and then pour on the Guinness. I also add about 1 cup of water. I cook on low for 10 hours. This is the best corned beef meal I have ever had!

I opted for the slow cooker since it seamed fool-proof and should have been very tender. But no. Started the cooker at 7am St. Patty's Day. 11 hours later I stuck a fork to it. Brick. Fork wouldn't even penetrate it. Same after 14 hours. Ended up cooking this center-cut beef all night and pulled the plug after 21 hours with slight increase in tenderness but it sure smelled great! Had it for dinner the next night and everyone loved it even though it was still very firm. Next time I'll use a more conventional recipe from Allrecipes and just drink the beer on the side :) UPDATE: I believe my problem was in using Guiness EXTRA Stout. This, as I found out later, has a much higher alcohol content than regular draft. Almost 4 times as much. Too much booze would certainly toughen the roast.

This was wonderful cooked in a the crock pot with out veggies.  I used about 1/2 cup of the brown sugar and 2 cans of Guinness.  I did add the spice packet from the meat and 2 more bay leaves.  Cooked 8 hours on high.  I made 2 in 2 different pots (for leftovers).  I stored the second piece overnight in the fridge, in the juices from the crock pot and it was even better the next day.  Made Diane's Colcannon to go with it and my guests could not stop raving about both the Corned Beef and the Irish Mashed Potatoes!  Thanks everyone for all of the cooking tips!

For those who complained of "tough" "greasy" meat, keep in mind that like any other meat, there are good brisket cuts and bad brisket cuts.  The Flat cut is usually a dollar or two more per pound than the point cut.  There is a reason for this, if you want a good corned beef, don't skimp

this will be the 3rd straight st. patty's day that i will be making this (that does not include any other time throughout the years that i have been asked/begged to make it) my family (esp. the hubby) absolutely LOVE this dish!  my hubby has been on the countdown since valentine's day!  the only changes i make are to trim off as much fat as possible (personal preference), rub with the sugar, throw in the crockpot, cover completely with guinness and cook on low for 8-10 hours.  i add red potatoes the last 2 hours and cook the cabbage separately (just a taste and color preference with me and the kids. . .hubby likes his with the potatoes). shameless, thank you so much for an awesome recipe!!!!

Delicious. Just be sure to cut out all of the cabbage heart. If you dont, it can be bitter.

Wow! This is a keeper! The best corned beef ever. Only changes; trimmed fat from bottom, used Modelo instead of Guinness, and light brown sugar. Placed in slow cooker, first hour on high, then seven hours on low. Used point cut;5 lbs. Incredibly good!! I dont usually like corned beef! Not anymore!!!

I have made this recipe for years.  It also works well with double chocolate stout beer!  I cook mine on low in the crockpot all day.  The aroma is wonderful...The next morning I fry up some potatoes, onion, and green pepper, add salt & pepper to taste along with a dash of cider vinegar and then add the corned beef...makes delicious hash.  I like to top it with a sour cream/hot mustard sauce.

I did not try this exact recipe but had to comment. This has been my secret for years. Make it easy on yourself, just throw it all in the crockpot. Depending on the size of the crockpot is how much G. beer I use, but at least one can and I do add water too, it does not have to be all beer. And use the spices they give you with your corn beef. I add a few cloves of garlic too. I think this year I will add just a little of the brown sugar like this recipe has but I won't use as much- corn beef should not be sweet. Happy saint Patty's Day!

Mine wasn't dry.. stringy.. or over-cooked at all.  I added an extra can of Guinness and the full seasoning packet that came with my 3.5lb corned beef brisket.  Popped everything in my handy crockpot and cooked this on high (yes.. I was rushing things a bit) :) for about 4 hours.. it fell apart.. full of flavor!!  I served this on fresh toasted rye bread with aged swiss cheese and Boar's Head sour kraut.. (much less sodium)found in the small bags in the deli dept. Threw some kettle cooked potato chips on the side. Not only was it a gorgeous sandwich.. it only lasted a couple of hours with my hungry bunch!!
Thanks for the recipe..

For someone who has always boiled corned beef, this was a stretch, because of the ratings I had to try it. I will never boil corned beef again, this really does melt in your mouth
Thanks, Sandy

I have made this well over 20 times and it's THE BEST! I have cooked it in the oven as directed and also (the normal way for me) is in the slow cooker with an extra 1/2-1 bottle more of Guinness. I put the slow-cooker on low for about 6 hours and it is amazing! Seriously, THE BEST!

Making this again for the seventh year in a row!!  Fantastic recipe!  We do away with the oven and use a crock pot on low 6-8hrs with no trouble whatsoever.  We throw away the seasoning packet and it tastes better than with!  Thank you!!

Simple & delicious. Great meal to put into the oven and forget about. I didn't have any Guinness so I used a light beer, it was still wonderful. I also added red potatoes, carrots and wedged cabbage during the last hour. They turned out wonderfully and my family went back for seconds. I thought I would have enough meat left over for sandwiches, but the family ate it all!

I made this exactly as written and it was amazing!  I did cut back on the brown sugar only because 4# briskets are not available where I live.  Next time I'll just buy two because everyone is wishing we had left-overs!  Wonderful recipe!  If you are going to tweek it, write your own... just sayin'.

I cooked a 3 lb corned beef brisket in the slow cooker for 9 hours with the entire cup of brown sugar and used three Guinness Draught to completely cover the meat.   The meat was amazing!  I served it to a large group of people and everyone loved it.  I plan to cook a few larger briskets using the same method for my son's upcoming wedding social.

Being a total novice in the kitchen, I thought I'd give this simple recipe a try. I must say it turned out GREAT! The corned beef was moist & the juice was sweet & delicious. I've already made it twice this week & have a girlfriend who thinks I've somehow morphed into a Chef!!

Seeing as I was working all day I opted to make this in the Crockpot. I used the flat cut corned beef and trimmed most of the visible fat off. I placed the brisket in the bottom and covered it with two cans of Guinness and the brown sugar. I placed carrot and potatoes around the meat and put a few wedges of cabbage on top of the whole thing. I cooked it on low for about 10 hours and when it was done with was out of this world! I can't recommend this combination enough. I'm sure it would be just as tasty in the oven, but for true fall apart, melt in your mouth corned beef the Crockpot works beautifully.

I have made this 2x and have learned the following: cook in crockpot, use original guiness beer & cover ALL the meat. I made mine w/o sugar - but added wedged cabbage, whole carrots & wedged carrots - the last hour of cooking - everyone raved. This is Truly a Delicious recipe.  Make w/ irish soda bread- found on this site for traditional dinner.

I don't drink, and therefore didn't have any Guinness on hand, so I used 12 oz. of a heavy beef broth.  It was remarkable!  I got a corned beef hater to change their ways.

I thought this was really good (and easy) to make in a slow cooker.  I should have included the flavor packet that came with the meat - it turned out a little bland with just some salt that I added.  I also reduced the brown sugar down to 1/4 cup - was the perfect amount for me.  I poured the entire bottle of beer in the slow cooker, then piled cubed potatoes, carrots, onion wedges, and cabbage slices on the top.  Cooked on low for 6 hours. Was very good - just needed more flavor (from the spice packet).  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the most amazing corned beef ever!  I follow the recipe to the letter and always enjoy the end result.  I have always used a crock pot and cooked on high for about 8 hrs., so don't know how the oven version turns out, but the slow cooker version is definitely a keeper!  I have added potatoes and carrots and the brown sugar/beer glaze makes them very tasty.  Thanks Shameless!

This is a superb recipe. I had never added brown sugar before! Personally, I like the slightly bitter taste of Guinness only, but my family found it a bit too strong. I cut the brown sugar back to 3/4 of a cup, and my friends and family loved it, while I still got a certain amount of bite. I also switched to a crock pot,cooking for 8 hours, and added small potatoes and baby carrots with some onion slices two hours before it was finished.

Awesome! No longer will corned beef & cabbage be cooked just because we're supposed to - we will definitely want to do it this way over & over again! Used a 5lb FLAT CUT brisket & cooked it fat side UP w/o the rack. Mixed the spice packet & 2 cloves of minced garlic with the brown sugar prior to rubbing all over the meat & surrounded it with 2 cans of Murphey's. 4 hours later added cabbage wedges & potatoes...an hour later made converts out of my family as well as a couple of neighbors! YUM! The only thing I can't decide is if this is so good that it'll only be served on this holiday? Or, is it so good that it'll become a slightly regular meal in our house???+++UPDATE+++The hubs just informed me that it was a tad too sweet (I'll cut down the brown sugar just a bit next time) & he'd prefer the cabbage cooked separately to retain more of its cabbage flavor, other than that this will be THE go-to corned beef recipe from now on! The four stars are for the flavor & ease of prep, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is due to the level of sweetness & the suggested cooking time being too short...

This is perfect!  I followed the advice from the reviews and used my slow cooker (trim the fat first, it made a big difference!).  I used two bottles of Guinness and flipped the brisket halfway through cooking.  I added allspice, cloves and thyme to the seasonings from the packet that came with the brisket- this was recommended by another reviewer and it really added to the taste. This was so easy and just wonderful- tender and not at all greasy.

Awesome! Best corned beef Ive ever made. I put mine in the crockpot on High for 9 Hours. It took (2) cans of guiness beer and 2 cups of water to cover the corned beef. I rubbed the brown sugar and seasoning packet on the corned beef. So tender and great flavor!

Ridiculously easy.  You could make this drunk, which is appropriate given the holiday.  People said this was better than the corned beef the local Irish pub was serving on St. Patrick's Day.  I didn't measure the brown sugar, just rubbed it on until it was coated.  Put the corned beef in crockpot on low for about 9 hours.  Very juicy and tender.  Put some cabbage, onions and carrots in about the last hour and half of cooking.  I only put in a little bit of cabbage, wished I had put more in because I ran out of cabbage before I ran out of beef.  Its important that you like the taste of Guinness, because the cabbage really absorbs the taste of this wonderful stout.

The alcohol bakes off, so this is child safe. What I did was to cook the cornbeef according to the recipe; 15 minutes before specified "done time" I started making the Amazingly Easy Irish Soda Bread (from this website) and bumped the temp/ up to 375*, to cook the bread. When the timer went off, I removed the cornbeef, put it on the bottom rack of oven and put in the Soda Bread. Cooked the bread according to directions and then took everything out of the oven. It all turned out perfect! I added cabbage only to the cornbeef and didn't even need to add more liquid as there was plenty of juice! A keeper as my hubby says.

I have done a different Guinness corned beef recipe for the past five years, and everyone has always liked it.  But this year, I couldn't find my recipe so I used this one (thinking it was the same).  It wasn't the same as my original recipe; this one is MUCH better!  The brown sugar gives the beef a fantastic glaze/crust that makes this meal so much more!  It was so easy to make, too!  I left it in my crockpot for four hours (only did a 2 lb. brisket), and it was perfect!  My old recipe will never be used again.  This one, however, will always be my corned beef recipe!

This is a good recipe, but if you are used to having corned beef one way; you may think this is too sweet.  I made mine in the cockpot with 2 cans of Guiness.  I put potatoes, carrots and cabbage in with it towards the end.  The potatoes were done under 2 hours, the cabbage took slightly longer than 1 hour. Next time I make it I think I will opt out of putting any sugar in it at all.  The beer is a great idea and even though I can't stand beer, it isn't noticeable in this recipe at all.

I don't like Guinness or corned beef, but my husband does so I thought I'd try this.  (The same recipe is on Guinness' website.)  I used the flat cut corned beef and my crock pot.  The whole flavor packet went in, plus the brown sugar the recipe calls for...I used a bottle of beer instead of a can though.  It was great!  My daughter loved it too which really surprised me.  Made reubens with the leftovers...yummy!  Thanks for the post.

After reading all of the other reviews, I made this for my father and his girlfriend yesterday with a little trepidation...and now I have to say that this was the BEST corned beef I've ever made or had!  For folks who have complained about the meat not being done enough, or too tough, remember that LOW and SLOW is key!  I cooked my in my old faithful Le Creuset Dutch oven at 300* for 5 hours.  One nice thing about LOW and SLOW is that you can't really overcook it, and with cuts of meat that need to be braised, the longer the better.  The Guinness and browned sugar gave the meat a delightfully different taste, but not at all beery or overly sweet.  I added some peppercorns, allspice berries and whole cloves, and didn't use a rack, as so many people recommended.  The leftovers will make terrific sandwiches.  This is the ONLY way I will EVER cook corned beef again!  Thank you SO MUCH for the post!

I've made this the last several years for St. Pat's Day.  It's a family favorite and is expected on March 17th.  The biggest tip I can give is to cook it long enough to get it good and tender.  There's nothing worse than a tough cut of meat.  

Here's how I did it this year.  After rinsing and patting the corned beef dry (I used 2, 3-1/2 lb. corned beef briskets), I put them alltogether in a Pam sprayed crockpot along with 1 cup brown sugar and a bottle of Guinness.  I cooked them on High for 8 hours (fat side down).  I checked them for tenderness, turned them over and cooked them on High for 4 more hours.  I removed them from the crock pot to cool and added another bottle of Guinness to the cooking liquid and then added a head of cabbage cut into wedges and a 48 oz. bag of baby carrots to cook on High for 7 hours until tender.

I also made Diane's Colcannon, here at allrecipes, to go with the corned beef and veggies.  Yum!!

What a disaster!!!I followed the recipe to a "T" and all I got was a tough, undercooked slab of meat!!  I had friends and family waiting while I ran around transferring all the ingredients into my trusty electric pressure cooker, but even then the beef was still tough.  The guiness only gave it an unappetizing brown color too!  Don't make this!!!

Being that my bday is on St. Patrick's day and I have made traditional corned beef in the past, not exceptionally well, but o.k. I decided this sounded delicious and had to try it!  Read all reviews and went with the original recipe as posted with a few of my own additions based on reviews and what I know as a cook.  I used a 3 lb. point cut corned beef (meant to buy a flat cut, but this turned out great regardless), rubbed both sides with couple tablespoons of brown sugar, then added to my dutch oven for extra flavor, 1 cut up onion, 4 cloves smashed garlic, 4 bay leaves, pickling spice that came with package, and few tablespoons of assorted whole peppercorns.  placed meat on top of this, added 3 bottles (12oz) guiness draught beer & 1 1/2 c. water which what was needed to barely cover meat. Placed lid on dutch oven and put in 300 oven for 5 hours.
During the last hour I removed the lid from pot & added 2 quartered russet potatoes, cabbage wedges and 5 carrots. This was amazingly tender!!  I probably could have taken it out after 3.5 - 4 hours.  The meat was extremely moist and practically falling apart, but I LOVED IT.  I did not remove the fat from the meat as I felt it would dissolve and only add flavor to the liquid and I'm glad I did. The veggies were cooked to perfection.  I will say the flavor of the liquid is somewhat sweet and the peppercorns added a little heat, not overpowering at all and frankly I like the sweet/heat combination. I would make this again & again!

I'm only rating this a 3 because my corned beef was tough. The baking time needs to increase by at least an hour. My brisket wasn't quite 3 lbs and it needed to cook much longer. The flavor was good, but it doesn't do any good if you have to chew and chew and chew...

Excellent...I have read a gazillion of the reviews and for the most part followed the recipe to the letter and my family just oved it. In case your having bad results...this is what I did...I used a 13x9x2 pan, rinsed two 4 lb corned beefs and dried with papertowels, rubbed both briskets and both sides generously with brown sugar and browned both sides in a skillet with some olive oil, laid them sideways in the pan to fit pretty tight, used about 16-18 oz of a 22 oz bottle of Guiness Stout (covered 2/3 of the meat), Sealed tight with heavy foil and baked at 300 degrees Fahrenheit (untouched) for 3 1/2 hours and it was perfect! Served with Diane's Colcannon recipe located on this website too...but used half and half instead of milk. Will never boil meat again...braise my friend...awesome!

This was the BEST corned beef I have ever made.  My brisket was only 3.3 lbs, so I used 3/4 cup of brown sugar, 2 bottles of Guinness stout, and the seasoning packet included with the meat.  I trimmed the fat off of the meat, coated the outside with brown sugar, and covered the entire brisket with the Guinness. It was tender, juicy, and melt in your mouth delicious.  This is now the only way I will make corned beef.  Thank you for the recipe.

I made this for a restaurant I worked for and was told by many that is was the best they ever had. I did not change any of the ingredients but I did cook it at 225 for 4 hours. Great flavor and super moist.

This is a great recipe. The only thing i do different is rub the meat with brown sugar then then sear it in a hot frying pan with olive oil first before roastng. It gives the meat a deeper richer flavor. I've already made it for St. Patty's day, and i am thinking acout making it again. my family loves it so much!!!

I loved this recipe. My small family of three ate the whole thing. That is quite a feat for this crew!! I used the spice packet along with the brown sugar, had to add more Guiness to keep enough liquid in the pan. I baked it for 4 hours. Was tender and delicious! A must try for corned beef fan.

I make this just as the directions advise, except I add the corned beef spice packet to the brown sugar for my rum.  This is delicious.  I am an Irish American and this is the best I have ever had.  It is not as "gelatinous" as boiled versions, and the meat doesn't curl up like when I simmer it.  This cuts nicely the day you cook it, whereas with boiled versions, I have always found it does not slice well until it has been refrigerated.

This was FABULOUS!  I was very skeptical about the Guinness (not a fan - hubby is though!) but in the end you couldn't taste the Guinness yet it left a wonderful flavor behind.  Cooked the flat cut in the slow cooker for about 7 hours on low (I used 2 bottles of Guinness to cover the meat almost to the top) and added the potatoes and cabbage about 90 minutes before serving (flipped it to high at that point).  No leftovers...I have a lonely loaf of rye and bottle of thousand island dressing!

NEVER AGAIN -- BACK TO MY BOILED DINNER From all of the rave reviews, I thought this would be fantastic.  I did cook it in the slow cooker as suggested for 11 hrs. so the meat was tender.  The Guinness totally ruined the flavor of everything.  I normally cook 2 to 3 times more food than we need because everyone has seconds or thirds and we also have plenty left for hash and ruebens.  No one even finished their first helping of this (let alone have seconds).  It looks like I have to find another use for the corned beef because the vegetables tasted so horrible.

When I made this recipe, I had all the ingridients at home (I thought), and later realized I didn't have the guinness beer. I had plenty of red wine though, so I used red wine instead. It tasted awesome! So tender and very tasty. My husband loved it, he almost finished the whole dish (good for 6 serving).

We were so disappointed because I tried another recipe on this site and it used beer and it was fantastic.  this one was dry dry tough tough cause it needed to cook inside the beer and not on top of everything.  I'm sticking with Slow Cooked Corned Beef For Sandwiches from now on because it just can not be beet!!

Sorry. Followed the recipe exactly as written, but it came out awfully dry.  I think it was because the beef was on a rack above the beer.  If you're going to use a crockpot (like most of the reviewers did), and want the taste of beer in your corned beef, I recommend the "Slow Cooked Corned Beef for Sandwiches" recipe on this site.  I've used it several times for sandwiches and whole meals by adding veggies to the crockpot about halfway through the cooking time.

Love this!  Corned beef and Guinness are the perfect combo!  I did keep in the oven for about 4 hours versus the 2 1/2.  Mine was only a 3 pounder.  I bought  a second one while they  were on sale.  Think I'll try this one in the crock.

I made this twice. The first time was awful and I left a review reflecting that. Well, it must have been something I did, because determined to have this for St Pats, I made it again and it was amazing. My guests lvoed t, I loved it. It was a real hit. I think  maybe my first attempt I left it in the crockpot too long and the beer/sugar started to burn up a little. Will definitely make again.

EZ, delectable, divine, and the broth is fantastic, going to make a soup out of it, since we ate all the beef. I added one Guinness and one Mexican dark beer, supposedly it needs to be covered in liquid as meat exposed to air might be bitter, (could porb use beef stock instead/addition) meat kept floating up so put a oven proof bowl on it to keep it down in the beer, I mean broth (the alcohol of course cooks away) and crock-potted it all day, added potatoes about an hour or so before I planned to eat and the carrots and cabbage cut in large wedges were added around a half hour later, I like my veggies with a bit of substance, not limp. Time and temp may vary. Phweee never reviewed before, wrote this to a Face Book buddy and decided to copy and paste it here. Where it counts.

My father-in-law makes this dish. It is my absolute favorite way to cook and eat corned beef...and I am not a beer drinker. I can't seem to get enough of this. I suspect, once you have it, there is no turning back to the boiling method! : )

UPDATE: I tried to make this recipe (following the instructions here) and it did not turn out well. I suspect maybe the cut of meat was too big or something. I guess I will let my Hubby's Dad be the corned beef maker from now on.

This is one of the first recipes I tried off this site & it was a hit big time. I work long hrs so the only thing I did different is put it in a crock pot before I left for work & when I got home it was fabulous! If I'm not going to be home to turn it over 1/2 way through cooking I do put an extra beer to cover the meat completely. It's so easy I even get my husband to make it.

I have made this recipe many, many times and it always comes out GREAT!  Everyone raves about it and they can't believe when I tell them that it's only 2 ingredients and the corned beef.  I cook it in the slow cooker.  I put it in on high for an hour and a half, then on low for the rest of the day (about 6 and a half more hours).  It comes out so moist and delicious.  If I could give it 10 stars I would!!

We LOVE love love this recipe! I am taking it to work with me for St.Patrick's Day.  We have a friendly "best cook" competition and this will throw me into the front!  My family got a little concerned I wouldn't make some for home too.  It will just be a 2 crockpot kinda day. . . Lucky me I will get it twice!

I was looking forward to making this recipe but sadly I was a bit disappointed. I found the meat to be quite dry. I think I will try it again sometime but next time I will use the slow cooker, that way the meat should come out more moist. Overall, rather disappointing I'm sorry.

I do this in the crock pot all day on low. Excellent meal! I make it with the colcannon (potatoes/cabbage/onions) recipe you can find on here. I will make this tomorrow (Mar.17th) and every St. Paddy's day from now on. It has become a tradition. Also with the Irish Soda bread and Pistachio loaf that can be found on allrecipes.

I started making the corned beef this way (in the guinness) for my Irish husband and his family 3 years ago.They say it's the most flavorful they've ever had. I put the meat in a roasting pan, right in the beer,cover and bake a few hours. The meat ALWAYS comes out tender,no matter what cut I use. I put in the carrots and potatoes with the meat but steam the cabbage separately. The guinness gives the meat flavor that you won't get boiling the life out of it!

I decided to try several recipes for last St. Patty's day never having made corned beef before.  This one took the cake!  I roasted it in a roasting pan on 300 for several hours and it was mouth watering.  I will only be using this recipe this year.  I caked on the brown sugar & rubbed it in to the meat.  Also, I basted the meat every-so-often and it really was killer!  I can't wait to make it for my party guests, I might have to do a trial run (just so I get to eat it twice, there will be no leftovers).

Amazing. The flavor was just amazing. I cooked mine in the slow cooker on low for about 9 hours. I ended up using 2 bottles of Guinness. I flipped the meat 4 hours into cooking. The corned beef was really moist, tender and flavorful. I can't wait to make this again.

I saw that this recipe had great rating but I don't know how you enjoyed the flavor. I cooked the cornbeef in a crock pot for 9 hours and it came out so tender.  The only real down fall of this recipe was the guiness.  I love beer but not guiness, and the cornbeef was infused with the guiness flavor.  I would never make this recipe with guiness again.  Good luck whom ever tries it.

I tried this for a change and it came out  perfect! I would highly recommend putting in the slow cooker all day. The meat was tasty and flavorful. BUT I wouldn't recommend using this for reubens at all.

I made this for St. Patrick's day this year.  I did it in a crock pot with 22 ounces of beer and cooked for a total of about 7 hours on high.  I added some veggies (onions and carrots) during the last hour and served with Lemon Horseradish New Potatoes and Irish Brown Soda Bread recipes from this website.  While I'm not a huge fan of beer, I think it gave the corned beef and veggies a fabulous flavor.  Even people who don't like corned beef enjoyed it.  I used the leftover meat to make reuben sandwiches all week.  Thanks!

I tried this recipe and thought it was really good. But after reading the reviews I think I must add that when buying a corned beef the flat cut is a better quality than a point cut. This makes all the difference. Plus keep the foil on while baking. TRY NOT TO PEEK you lose all of the heat and steam with is what makes it tender. Also always cut a corned beef on a diagonal angle.

This is the 2nd year I've done this for St. Patty's Day and it's absolutely fantastic.  I used the brown sugar and Guinness but not the cooking method.  Here's how I did it.  If you want the meat to be tender it MUST BE IMMERSED IN THE GUINNESS.  I put my corned beef into a dutch oven on the stove, coated it with brown sugar and poured the Guinness into the pan.  Then I added enough water so that it was not quite covering the meat.  I also tossed in the spice packet that came with the corned beef.  I brought to a boil, reduced the heat and simmered for 3 hours.  At this point I removed the meat to a cutting boad (it is falling apart tender!) and covered with foil.  To the cooking liquid I added small red potatoes sliced in half and chunks of carrot.  I cooked these till tender, about 20 minutes, then removed them to a bowl.  Then I sliced a head of cabbage into large chunks and added this to the broth.  The cabbage only needs about 5 minutes to get tender.  The Guinness did not add a strong alcohol flavor to the meat or the veggies but it did add a nice flavor.  It was fantastic!

My fiance and I love this recipe! He says it is becoming his favorite. I use two cans or bottles of beer though, an outmeal stout is very good. The recipe for Beer Bread I is very good with it also. Both recipes are so easy too. I put the corned beef in the croskpot with the veggies and cook it on high for 8 hours.

The corned beef really comes out delicious, but I wouldn't cook my potatoes, carrots, onions, and cabbage in the same liquid mixture of Guinness and brown sugar.  For some reason, those flavors just don't work with the vegetables, even though I like Guinness.

I'm sorry that I can't rate the actual cooking method and time, because like the others I put it in the crock pot all day. It was tender and delicious, and my kids loved it and keep asking me for it.

I put it in crock pot and put the brown sugar on top. Then I sprinkle the spice packet contents over the top and pour the Guinness over it all. I added veggies (potatoes and cabbage, primarily) closer to the end. We almost never have leftovers.

The Corned beef was excellent.  I cooked it in the slow cooker and I ended up using 2 bottles of Guinness and that still wasn't enough...so I improvised and added some XX, it was all we had.  Like I said, everyone loves the corned beef.  It was gone at the end of the meal.  I didn't like the veggies.  They had that strong beer flavor.  Some of my family loved them.  I gues it's just whatever your preference is.  This was great and I will make it again!

I love corned beef and have made it many times. This approach didn't really work for me. Beef was moist but still a little chewy even after 6 hours in the oven, first at 300 then at 325. I suppose this could have been the brisket which occasionally can be tough. The potatoes and carrots were delicious, but the cabbage was very bitter, practically inedible. Will not make this again.

I made this in the crockpot for St. Patrick's Day and was very happy with how it turned out. Next time I'll be sure to get this started sooner, I only had in for 4 hours on high and I think that a little more time would have produced a more tender brisket.

This was spectacular!  I now have to make it monthly for  my boyfriend.  I added almost three beers and some chicken broth because I put in a lot of potatoes, cabbage, carrots and onions as well.  But it was to die for!  I also had put it all into a crock pot and had it cook on low for about 9 hours...the beef melted off the fork and into your mouth, YUM!

I cooked mine in my dutch oven, covering the brisket with beer (took 4 Guiness).  I cooked it for 3 hours at 300, but then wanted to use the oven to roast my potatoes and carrots, so it spent almost another hour on the stove top (with the cabbage added).  It was very tender!  The taste was great too.  I'm not convinced I needed to use all beer though, maybe 1/2 beer and 1/2 water would have done the job with more beer for drinking!

Very easy; very good! In the crockpot I layered red potatoes, onions, baby carrots and cabbage. Poured 1 bottle of beer over veggies; laid  brisket on top and poured 2nd bottle on top of meat/veggies. Very tender.

This is a variation on a recipe I have used for years. To add a little zip, coat with a hearty grainy mustard first, and then coat with brown sugar. Makes it not as sweet and adds great flavor!

It is good.  I had to add my own spices as there was not a pkg. in with the meat. (Odd).  anyway, I was gentle with them and I think I got it spot on.  This is quite a delicious recipe.  I would use a bit less sugar next time tho'.  I think a bit of mustard will make the meat in a sandwich, my favorite way to eat this.  I had a friend who owned his own meat market and he made grey corned beef that was over the moon wonderful.  Oh how I do miss that man and his store.  Hubby likes this one and that is good because he is hard to please.  Oh, I did use the crock pot too.  Put potatoes and a beautiful big onion in two hours before it was done for my husband.  He loves onions.  Thanks for sharing a keeper with us.

I made this in a crockpot.  Added vegetables and 2 cloves of garlic.  Also, used 1/2 the seasoning packet.  I did not have Guinness beer and just used regular beer.  Meat was very tender and had a good flavor.

This is the only way I make my corned beef now! I don't use a rack though. I coat the meat with the sugar then place in my roasting pan and pour enough Guinness around it until it's halfway up the meat.

Wonderful and easy. DH is Guinness fan so I have to steal a can to make this.I use corned beef eye round instead of brisket--less fat but great texture & flavor, slices easy and makes lovely sandwiches if there are any leftovers. Like to serve it with Champ(recipe on site), steamed cabbage and brown mustard.

I should have used a slow cooker. It was way too dry in the oven. My husband sliced it up and poured barbque over it and cooked it in a skillet the next day and was able to recover it. I will try it in the crockpot next time.

I love this recipe, as a starting point.  I think everyone on here has altered this recipe in their own way, which makes it amazing.  I changed it in so many ways, but the outcome was delicious.  First, instead of Guinness stout, I used two cans of Guinness Draft, way better flavor.  Second change was I, like so many others on here, used a slow cooker.  Third, after rubbing it down with the brown sugar and placing the meat in the slow cooker I then sprinkled the prepacked seasoning all over it.  After that I completely submerged the meat in the Guinness and let it cook overnight for about 12 hours before adding an onion, a head of cabbage and a bag of baby carrots to let it cook for another four to five hours.  The finished product is amazingly tender and it tasted so good that no one at my party could stop eating it all night.  It makes me want to make this for other get togethers, not just St. Patty's.

I ruined a perfectly good corned beef on this recipe. My son made a special trip to the store to buy the Guinness so I could do the recipe exactly as it was written and we were very disappointed. I am so glad I didn't do this for a party because I would have been too embarassed to serve it to my guests. I deleted this from my recipe box.

I tried two ways, this one and another on this site. This one gets 1 star because it was bitter and dry and tough by donig it in the oven as called for. My other turned out perfect. Needles to say I have almost the entire recipe left over but the other one got eatn right away.

An amazing recipe. I used a "point" cut of beef. 99 cents a pound on sale. Just trimed it up. Cooked it 7 hrs on low in the crock pot. Used two bottles of Guinness. My husband thought it was a waste of 2 bottles of beer :). Since my crock pot is on the small side, I removed the beef and poured  the "broth" into a large pot and then added my cabbage, potatoes, and carrots. Then I boiled them on top of the stove for 20 min.or so. Can't wait to serve it tonite!!!

I love this recipe. I would not make corned beef any other way. I cook it in the oven **in the beer** not on the roast rack, covered and turned it over every 45 minutes for around 4 hours. Be sure to rinse the brisket well beforehand and don't use the spices that come with it. Tremendous!

You can't tget tender corned beef by roasting it in the overn.  It has to be immersed in liquid to tenderise.  Try the "Slow Cooked Corned Beef for Sandwiches" on this sight and you will have the best tasting tenderest corned beef AND it is made with beer so you can use your Guiness there!

Holy smokes!  I don't even like corned beef, I just made it cause' its one of my husband's favorites and I thought this was fantastic (he said it was the best he's ever had.  He said it might be the best meal I've ever made!)  I did mine in the slow cooker for about 9 1/2 hours, adding potatoes with 2 hours left and cabbage with a little over an hour left.  I cut off the layer of fat from my brisket, I did use the seasoning packet, (even though some reviewers said not to?) and I used 2 bottles of beer to cover the whole thing.  I was very skeptical..I don't like dark beer and its kind of pricey when I only needed 2 bottles....but it was WONDERFUL....those other 4 bottles will definitely be used when I make this again for St. Pat's company.  AND SO EASY TOO!!!!!!!

After reading the reviews for this recipe, the Executive decision was made to slow-cook the corned beef as opposed to the oven roasting method called for in the recipe.  I must say, it came out pretty good!  I used two 12 oz. bottles of O'Doul's, & placed it on a rack in the dutch oven, then slow cooked it on low for twelve hours.  It was well liked by all, but seemed to have a slightly tart finish/aftertaste, presumably from the beer...  I think I prefer the taste of regular slow cooked corned beef...  So, my 4-star rating. Still, I'm not complaining, this made a great meal!  Served with warm rolls, steamed green cabbage with salt and pepper and malt vinegar, and baked white potatoes with butter and salt and pepper.  Yummy!

My husband has never raved about something as much as he did this one. It was the most succulent and tasty dish I think we've prepared thus far. I actually put the brisket into a pan and let it cook in the Guinness and then flipped it every 1/2 hour and it was perfect! SO yummy will definitely make again and it was SO easy!

I will not make this one again.  Even my husband, who loves Irish stout beer, did not like it.  The Guinness taste was very strong (as I should have known it would be), so don't even try it if you don't like the taste of Guinness beer.

I have to say, my mom is from Ireland and I grew up eating corned beef and cabbage every St Paddy's day. I have made corned beef the traditional way by boilling it but I have to say that I just might not boil it ever again. THis is amazing. I've made it a few times, this year I threw in cabbage that wouldn't fit into the pot to boil and it was very tasty as well. This is worth a try. I don't think many would go back to boiling it after this.

Lots of shifty eyes at my table, all wanting that last piece of corned beef. Without a doubt the best way to cook corned beef. Used a point cut, 4 1/2 pound piece of meat, cooked in a covered roasting pan for about 4 1/2 hours at 300 (1 bottle of Guinness and 1 cup brown sugar). It was the best ever.The meat was so tender, it was falling apart when I took it out of the oven. My mom and brother called me the next day to tell me again how good it was. This is the way to cook corned beef.

My husband can't stop raving about this corned beef.  He says it is the best he has ever had.  This is quite a compliment from a man who is 100% irish and the son of a butcher.  I made it in the crock pot.  After rubbing the sugar on the beef, I sat it in the pot and poured the beer over it.  I did not use a rach.  I then cooked on low for about 10 hours.  The recipe says 16 servings but my roast was bigger than 4 lbs, we had less than 16 guests, not eat meat and there was nothing left!

Wonderful recipe!!Our family has not been a fan of corned beef, but this recipe has definitely changed our minds. The taste was wonderful with just a hint of sweetness. The taste of the Guiness was meshed so well with the other flavors, you didn't taste a distinct "beer" taste. We did add the spice packet that came with our beef. Our brisket was somewhat thinly sliced (about 1-1 1/2 inches in thickness) so not sure if this caused the meat to be very juicy and tender instead of tough as some reviewers have found. We had the brisket in a very low rack just above the juices for the first hour, then took the rack out and added red potatoes and carrots. It also cooked for a little longer than 2 1/2 hours. Probably a little more like 3 1/2, but it was very tender and not stringy as other corned beef we have tasted. Even our seven year old liked it and my husband who usually dislikes corned beef as being to stringy and greasy. Thank you for the keper recipe!!

I am a seasoned cook, and have tried this recipe and everyone was delighted with it.  I served 20 people with this, and added three pounds of beef and a half a can of beer.  Wonderful!!!  PS  
The veggies were wonderful.  Thank you.

I had never cooked corned beef before.  My friend and I bought 2.  We cooked one according to the package directions and one the Guinness way.  There was absolutely no comparison.  The one cooked to package directions is so tough and unappetizing.  The Guinness corned beef is so tender and perfect it was gone with it's cabbage the same night.  Thanks be to Diana and the Irish Rovers!

This was *the best* corned beef I have ever made for St. Patrick's Day. Even my 6- and 7-year olds, who usually don't care for corned beef, gobbled this up. The recipe ingredients are simple. The corned beef came out so wonderfully tender - falling apart tender. I did it in a roasting pan in the oven at 300 (as original recipe calls for) and not in a crock pot (as others have done). I cooked it for 4 hours - longer than the recipe called for - just because I was out running kids to and from school and activities. Since my roaster is large, I used two 12-oz bottles of Guinness (always on hand in our house!) and then filled those empties with water and poured that in as well. As others have said, ***cook the beef IN the beer*** and make sure you are using a covered roasting pan (or cover it with foil if your roaster doesn't have a lid). I added my vegetables 1 hour before the end of cooking time and they came out nice and tender - even the whole potatoes. I did have to remove some of the cooking liquid once I added the vegetables, but that did not affect either the beef or the vegetables. Also, I forgot to rinse and pat the beef dry before rubbing with the brown sugar, but that didn't affect the beef, either. Thanks, Shameless Morrow, for this recipe!

Amazing. Make sure all meat is submerged, or rotate it because exposed parts will get bitter. Do add a bit of water and beef stock.

This is the only way I make corned beef now. I throw quartered potatoes into the crock pot with the meat, and they come out so flavorful.

This was sooo amazingly good. I looked at the comments on this recipe, and read about the person who said to fully submerge the meat in the guinness or else it will taste bitter. I used 2 bottles (they were all out of the cans) of guinness and it still was just barely sticking out. I was really nervous but I didn't want to add more beer. It all worked out though because when I added my vegetables later it all sunk into the beer and the end result....pure tender magic!

I love corned beef and this by far raised the bar. I will definitely be making this again and again and again.

Made this for dinner tonight. Followed the directions to the T. The corned beef was dry, stringy and had a very unappealing flavor. Couldn't even taste a hint of the brown sugar. I had such high hopes for this too considering the rave reviews on here.

My husband and I love reuben sandwiches, so we tried this recipe (followed it completely), made it one day, let it keep in the refrigerator until the next day, then used the meaty chunks of brisket on the reubens.  TO DIE FOR!!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I really don't think the Guinness added much flavor.  I'll stick to my recipe with pickeling spice with the addition of dried orange peel.  Will not make this again.

Delicious! I have never made corned beef before. My bf wanted corned beef hash so i told him 1st i had to make corned beef to get leftovers. I used 3 bottles of guiness, slow cooker on high for 6 hrs, and I didn't add the seasoning packet (since the butcher didn't include one!) I used a flat cut of beef and I added potatoes and carrots for the last 2 hours, cabbage for the last hour. Perfect. Bf said best corned beef he ever ate.

This was very tasty!  I did mine in the crock pot from frozen.  Definitely use the spice packet that comes with the brisket.  I decreased the amount of brown sugar because my brisket was only 2 lbs.  Next time I may increase it some.  I ended up using 3 bottles of Guinness and some water.  I don't know if it was because I used so much Guinness and not enough water or not enough sugar, but my brisket had a slightly bitter aftertaste.  Not yucky, just different.  My husband, however, loved it.  I did add potatoes and an onion in the last hour of cooking time.  The brisket came out very tender!  This recipe could be played with a lot.  Thank you!

I made this using the crock pot and it was wonderful.  I used enough guinness to cover the meat and DID add the seasoning packet.  I added onions, carrots and potatoes the last hour.  The meat and veggies both came out tasting slightly sweet and delicious.  I think adding the spice packet that comes with the corned beef really mixes well with the sweet and carmel flavors of the beer and brown sugar.  I was very skeptical of this recipe but was reassured when my boyfriend said it was the best corned beef I've ever made.

I normally make the Slow Cooker Corned Beef for Sandwiches recipe on here, but this was nice. The addition of the sugar was a good move. Not very sweet...perfect.

I made this in the crockpot.  We had a ~4 lb piece of corned beef, carrots and cabbage.  I put the corned beef on high for 7 hours.  I had to use 4 bottles of Guinness to get it covered fully, used the full cup of brown suger and added the spices.  With 3 hours left, I added cut carrots.  With 1 hour left, I added wedges of cabbage.

The corned beef was great!  However, I found the carrots to be bitter (my fiance thought they were slightly bitter but still liked them) and I also thought the cabbage was bitter (both my fiance and his buddy liked the cabbage).

I am sure I will make the corned beef this way again but not sure that I will add the veggies next time.

I also made the "Guinness Bread" recipe off of here.

This was wonderful! I added in onions at the bottom and some cabbage, potatoes, the seasoning packet that came with the package, and a bit of minced garlic. I think the trick for me was the brown sugar. Amazing!

I don't normally review, but I just wanted to let all the non-drinkers out there that is is AMAZING!  We do not drink alcohol, so I was a bit apprehensive to serve this to our group of friends that are also non-drinkers.  Besides the bitter smell of beer in the beginning, you can not even tell this was cooked in Beer.  My friends ALL went back for 2nds and all 8 lbs of meat was completely devoured by 6 of us!  Follow the recipe exactly, except DO add that packet of spices or else you can not call it CORNED beef.
Enjoy!

Perfect and easy!  Only thing I did was to not rack the corned beef.  I put it right in the roasting pan with the beer.  I pushed the cooking time back to 3 hours, 15 min. (only because we weren't ready to eat yet).  The meat was fork tender and the carrots were so tasty!  This one will be back before next St. Patty's day!

I told my husband I was making corned beef for St Patties, and he said he didnt like corned beef but would try mine... and he loved it! How do I know? he went back for seconds. This recipe is sweet and savory. In a separate dish I chopped some cabbage, carrots and onion with the guinness, brown sugar mixture and added seasoned salt and cornstarch for a thicker sauce as a side dish. I also made whipped mashed potatoes which I added steamed broccoli into for a festive color and flavor. Made for a fantastic Irish meal!

I braised the corned beef in the oven for ~3 hrs, refrigerated it overnight, skimmed the fat and put it in the Crock Pot the next day with carrots and cabbage (and enough additional liquid to cover all) for 4-5 hrs. All were perfect! Wonderful recipe!

I combined this recipe with Slow Cooked Corned Beef for Sandwiches and came out with the best corned beef I've ever had. I did add sliced onions to the bottom of my crockpot. We really liked the combination of the brown sugar and the Guinness. What a stunner!

Wonderful!  I made some changes.  I trimmed all fat off of meat.  Rub with part of the 1 c. brown sugar.  Place in crock pot.  Mix rest of brown sugar with spice packet and 1-2 cans Guiness.  Pour over roast.  Set on low 4 hours.  When timer goes off, turn roast and cook for another 2-4+ hours.  Throw in cabbage with 1 1/2 hour to go.  Make carrots, potatoes, and onion separately.  Serve with Irish soda bread from this site.

I will have to admit I didn't use Guinness, but I instead used 3 london ale beers that my hubby brewed himself. cooked in the crockpot all day on low and it was tender, juicy and flavorful. Weirdly enough, it didn't taste like beer or really even smell like it once it cooked a while. I didn't know whether to put the seasoning packet in or not, so I put it in and I think it might have been even better without it.

I usually use a bit more Guiness because I love the flavor.  I also usually use a slow cooker for 8 hours and add potatoes, carrots, and some onions during the last few hours of the slow cooking.

My husband loves it when I make this. He likes to try different local or favorite beers as well. It has always turned out great no matter what we use. I don't recommend cooking the veggies with the meat though unless you want them to taste like beer instead of veggies.

This turned out very tender & moist!  I made a half recipe, so my small family would eat it up within a day or two.  Next time, I'll make the whole recipe & freeze half!

Very good. Meat was tender and fell apart. Will be cooking it this way for now on in the crock pot.  I did use the seasoning packet that came with the meat, only because I wanted some of the flavor I grew up with.

This is the only way to make corned beef.  I don't even like corned beef and I can eat it this way.  My husband loved it too.  I did increase the Guinness to two bottles but otherwise followed your recipe was written.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Excellent!  I made this yesterday for St. Patty's day.  The only thing I did differently was I used a big electric roaster oven I have.  I set it to 325F, put in two bottles of Guinness and rubbed the brown sugar into the brisket well.  I cut the fat on the back of the brisket in a cross hatch pattern so that it would continue to lay flat the entire time it cooked.  After an hour I flipped the brisket over.  Waited another hour and flipped it back over.  At the 3rd hour mark I added sliced red skin potatoes and angle cut carrots.  45 minutes later I added chopped onions and my cabbage wedges.  I let this cook for another 30 minutes.  Removed the brisket and sliced it across the grain.  I took some of the juice (reduced Guinness) from the roaster and made a gravy because some of my family loves to put it over their potatoes and vegetables.  I highly recommend making the Amazingly Easy Irish Soda bread recipe that is also here at allrecipes.  I can't give this enough stars!  Thank you for providing it.

Wow is all I can say for this recipe. Thank you for sharing it! So simple yet so tasty. I used a 3.75lb corned beef from Costco, who already puts the spices on theirs, so I rinsed the corned beef first, pat dry, and pat with brown sugar. I put in the crock pot on low for 9 hours, and covered with 2 bottles of Guinness. Came home 10 hours later, and the place smelled AMAZING. I quartered about 9 small red and gold potatoes and put them in the crockpot for another hour, then took the corned beef out. I wrapped the corned beef in foil and put in the warm oven to stay warm, then added the carrots and cabbage to the slow cooker, let it cook for around 20-25 minutes. Everything came out grand, the cabbage still had crunch, the carrots had texture, and the potatoes weren't falling apart.  I'll make this one again for sure, my first 5 star rating of a recipe!

I made this recipe for St Patty's Day last year and I used a crockpot.  The recipe was very good.  This year I cooked it in my Le Crueset cocotte in the oven and the results were fabulous!  I will never do this recipe in the crockpot again because there was such a difference roasting it in the oven.   I had a three plus pound roast and I used 3/4 c brown sugar and two bottles of Guinness.  Dinner was spectacular!

I look forward to St. Patty's day so I can do this recipe- so delicious! I also do it in the slow cooker for the whole day and love that simple method. Last year i added all the veggies to the slow cooker as suggested, but this year I plan on roasting my potatoes and carrots- found that there were too many foods of a similar taste and texture when all were slow-cooked. But the cabbage almost stole the show it was so tasty from the slow cooker, so don't skip that!

This is best recipe for Corned Beef I have made. Cooking 3 hours allows it to be tender. Beer and brown sugar works. I did not change anything in the recipe. If you start adding ingredients it would take away from the simplicity of the flavors.

I did it in the oven as written and it came out dry/tough. I was able to salvage it by tossing the meat and the sauce in the Crockpot and recooking it that way......I give it a 3 as that Crockpot version does have an interesting taste that is different from the usual pickling spices.....that is just averaged out with the 1 it got as I did if the first time since it came out so dry. Maybe the oven version really needs foil SEALED on it to keep the mositure in/my cover was too loose. But.....I think I will stick to CrockPots for corned beef........

Though I'm a grandmother and very Irish, I had never made corned beef & cabbage, but decided to this St. Patrick's Day (2009). I found this recipe as well as others and decided to try this one and one other. Had a party of 19 and all agreed, hands down, that this was the best. Not the best of mine, but the best ever! I slow-cooked it for 8 hours on low. I then removed it and put in halved red potatoes and cabbage for 2 more hours. My cooker is 6 1/2 quarts and couldn't fit everything at once. I removed the potatoes and put the corned beef back in for a while to heat it up again, then sliced and served.  Even the little kids loved it.  I also used 2 bottles of guinness and 1 bottle of water. I was very skeptical of the brown sugar. Don't ask me how it all works, but it does and the corned beef tastes like corned beef, not sugar or beer.  I won't be looking further...this is the recipe for me. Serve with home-made brown bread and irish butter and you'll think you're in Killarney, I promise!

This was very tasty.  I followed the recipe and added the season packet that came with the corned beef.  I slow cooked it for 8-9 hours and it came out really tender and flavorful.  I don't drink alcohol and thought the flavor would be too much on the liquor side but it wasn't at all.  I also put a wedge of cabbage, baby carrots, and red taters in the slow cooker.  I could definitely taste the beer in the cabbage, so maybe next time I will not do that.  The carrots and taters were perfect.  Great recipe!

I first made this last year and I can't understand why I didn't rate it then--it's the best!  I used cheap light beer and later added potatoes, carrots, and cabbage to the liquid.  I'm making this recipe again tomorrow...and every time I make corned beef I'll be using this recipe.  It's terrific.  (I always use the slow cooker for corned beef--so tender!)

We just made this using the 18 hour crockpot method with the potatoes and cabbage under the meat (used the seasoning packet too).  FANTASTIC corned beef..potatoes were a little too sweet.  Such an easy and absolutely succulent corned beef recipe.  Thanks so much!

Excellent.  I made one this way and another the traditional way, and everyone preferred this one.  Cooked on low in a crock pot and it came out very tender.  I also used the spice packet.  Next time I will cook the cabbage, carrots, and potatoes separately - the ones cooked with the beer were too sweet.  I can't stand Guinness beer, but couldn't taste it at all in the beef - it just had a very good taste which we didn't think was too sweet at all.  This will be our corned beef recipe from now on!

Wow. Just Wow. Put me in with the 'melt in your mouth' crowd-this was absolutely amazing. I cooked a 3.75 lb in the crockpot for about 8 1/2 - 9 hours on low, and I did not use all the brown sugar called for. The only kind of corned beef available at my grocery store is a point cut, and it comes packaged with the seasonings already rubbed on; I rinse off most of the seasonings and the red goo that collects in the bag, then prepare as recipe states before throwing it in the crockpot. This is the second year I've made it this way, and even though I love new recipes this is my go-to St. Patty's recipe!

This was the BEST Corned Beef I've ever eaten, besides best I ever made! Cooked 4 lbs brisket in slow cooker on low for 4 1/2 hrs, then added 1lb baby carrots & 5 wedges of cabbage,continued on low for another 4 1/2 hours. Excellant, tender, just right sweet. The only thing different I did was added a layer of sliced red onions to bottom of crockpot when setting it up. For potatoes:in a seperate kettle, put in a cup of water, more cabbage wedges & white potatoes peeled & quartered. Took a cup of the broth out of the slow cooker & added to the kettle. Cooked potatoes & wedges on low simmer for 40 minutes. Will always do this recipe!

I had come across some red meat, that appeared to be a roast to me, at the supermarket on sale. When I got it home I looked closer and found it was corned beef. I had never made corned beef before, or even tried it and this recipe seemed pretty interesting. I forgot to bring the recipe home so I just winged it from memory. (Not very well!) I just took the beef out, placed it in the crock pot, layered it with about a cup of brown sugar and dumped in almost a whole pint of Guinness Extra Stout letting my boyfriend finish the rest, (Ew!) Because it was "extra stout" and I'm not too keen on the bitterness I added more sugar after about 3 hours. I cooked it on low for the first 3 hours, then on high for another 2 (we were getting lots of snow and I was afraid we might lose power!) It seemed kind of dry so I turned it over and cooked for another hour. (The other side was flakier.) I also cut up carrots and put them about halfway through the last hour. It came out good. Interesting taste. We enjoyed it with the carrots and some boiled potatos and cabbage. I think they would have been better if the potatos and cabbage were cooked with it. I would recommend trying this recipe.

I have been making a version of this recipe for 3 years now and about a week before St. Patty's Day my phone starts ringing with requests. Growing up I HATED corned beef, mom would crock pot it for hours and the house would reek for days. After denying my poor husband of his precious corned beef the first few years of our marriage I finally caved when I found this recipe. (I love Guinness!) Now I love corned beef. My small changes: No rack in the roasting pan lets the meat "braise" in the beer, I make a slushy syrup of the sugar and beer then smear it on ALL sides of the meat - even the bottom, cook it covered and when its done with the cover off blast it the broiler to carmelize the sugar and beer mix.  I think next year I might blast it first, then cover and cook, I'll let you know how that goes next year!!!
UPDATE: Tried broiling first this year. Looked beautiful and smelled intoxicating coming out of the broiler. Unfortunately lost all that brown goodness during the braise. Taste was still great, just no yummy crust.

Meat was really tender and had good flavor. I added the spice packet to the beer.

I used twice the beer because I wanted to cover the meat, and this worked well. I added vegetables the last hour or so - I would recommend adding potatoes & carrots the last 45 minutes, cabbage and onions the last 15-20 minutes (we like our veggies!)or else the veggies will get to mushy.

The kids weren't crazy about the vegetables that had been boiled in the beer liquid - I think if I had used a milder beer they would have liked it more.

All in all, a good recipe for the meat. And if you like strong beer, for the vegetables, too.

This is the only way I will make roast beef brisket from now on.  Follow the advice to cook it slow and turn often and I put it right in the Guiness and brown sugar fluid.  Finally a corned beef brisket that was not bland and tough!

I cooked it in the crockpot with 4 bottles of Guinness.  The meat was delicious!!  BUT- do not add veggies!  I did and they absorbed the bitterness of the beer.  I'll definitely use this recipe again though for the corned beef.

I made this recipe tonight and it was wonderful. I used Octoberfest beer, and a dutch oven on top of the stove. I added cabbage, potatoes & carrots the last half hour and the flavor was wonderful. Recommended highly and will definitely make again.

If you go back to 2003 and read reviews, there is someone who didn't like this recipe because she used Coors Light and then said she didn't think the Coors Light could be the only reason it didn't taste good! That still makes me laugh. I got this recipe 2 years ago and have been making it ever since. We love it. I gave it 4 stars because the recipe says to cover it with brown sugar, but in the crock pot, the sugar always comes off the meat and dissovles into the beer. Is this coating supposed to form a crust? Why not just put brown sugar in the beer? Why get messy with patting the sugar onto the beef or am I missing something? Although I would LOVE an answer, it doesn't matter - my entire family (and yes, we are Irish by heritage, but that makes me laugh as well) loved it.

This was an awsome idea for St.Patrick's Day.  I improved on the idea by taking the beef brisket, cutting it in half and placing it in my slow cooker.  Then I placed 1/2 a cup of onions on top.  Then I poured the beer on top and slow cooked it for 10 hours.  It was to die for!  I will be making this every year for St. Patrick's day.

Absolutely delicious! I made this recipe for my husband who is 100% Irish, raised in Dublin. I followed the directions exactly other than using a slow cooker. I cooked the corned beef for 9 hours and added the vegetables to the cooker at the end. I can't imagine not using the guinness, gave it a wonderful taste! Husband LOVED it!

Great recipe. I didn't have time to roast it so I put it in the slow cooker, you might want to cut down on the sugar a bit if you cook it that way. I put the potatoes in first, I might not do it that way the next time because they were a little sweet.  I boiled the cabbage in the juice.

This is a great recipe.  It's ALMOST the same one currently being offered at Guinness.com as "Beef 'n' Guiness."  The one from Guinness, however, does not say to put the meat on a rack in the pan.  I would say the combination of putting the meat on a rack and using too large of a pan is why some reviewers have said their meat has turned out dry.  Put the meat directly in an appropriate-sized pan.  It will be awesome!

Made this for St. Patrick's Day and it was the best my husband and I ever had!! I let it sit about 30 min. after taking out of the oven so it would be easier to slice- be sure to cut it across the grain for the best slices- we used it in sandwiches. Very tasty!

St. Patricks Day is just around the corner and I can't wait to make this again.  I prepared it last year, twice actually.  It is the best corned beef I have ever had.  The key is to cook it slowly and buy the corned beef tip I believe it is called.  Wonderful!

It sounded good as I read the recipe.  I followed the recipe to the letter and I am an experienced cook.  Unfortunately, I found problems with it.  I used a rack in a roaster pan as instructed.  This led to the meat not being in the beer during cooking and the vegetables added the last hour were steamed/baked without benefit of contact with the broth. The meat was tough and dry although a very good cut from a good meat company.  This despite cooking an additional hour and adding an additional 14 oz of stout.  I'm cooking it further tonight lying IN the stout hoping to tenderize it some more.  This is in contrast to my usual extremely tender boiled corned beef with veg.  I was hoping for something really different and tasty but was sorry to be quite disappointed.

I just made this today, St Patty's day. It got so many high reviews, that I was looking forward to a good corned beef. I've been heating it on high for 4 hrs now. I just checked on the meat, and it's ok, just very bland, as well as the sauce. I added peppercorn, bay leaves, and garlic, and it's still bland. The Guinness doesn't add much either. Very disappointed. Will doctor it up to salvage the meat.


Update***
I added some Star Anise, and it turned out much much better, 4 stars quality. I cooked it for another 3 hours on high, and it's definitely a keeper now. (added caramelized onions, potatoes, cabbage & carrots).

I use  2 cans of guinness and about a cup of water. turns out perfect every time. I use the spice packet that it comes with and nothing else. I make a gravy out of broth and serve mashed potatoes.

This was the simplest yet most delicious corned beef I've ever had!  I threw it in the crock pot for about 8-9 hours and it was absolutely perfect.  We made rueben's along with the Thousand Island II recipe from this site which was one of the best meals I've ever had.  I would recommend not using the spice packet it your meat comes with it.  We got our from a butcher so it didn't have the seasoning but I'd imagine it'd change the flavor quite a bit and it is perfect as is.

I followed the recipe to a T except I cooked in my crockpot and used two cans of Guinness and thought it was very tasty.  I did add cabbage, carrots and red potatoes the last few hours of cooking.  My kids loved this as it was a little sweet.  My hubby liked this but when I asked if he liked this or when I boiled my cornbeef and cabbage he said he liked my boiled version better.  I liked this and would make again but will also still make my boiled version as well.

I have made this recipe for 11 years now and, even though I always make it the same way, my family insists it gets better every year. The only change I make is that I cook it for about 5 hours in the slow cooker instead of the oven and as others have said, I add the season packet that comes with the beef. This is a definate keeper recipe.

Fantastic! I've made this 3 years in a row and it seems like I can't make enough if it. I make it in the crock pot, cover the beef with guiness, drink one myself for good measure (hey, I'm Irish) and let it cook all day in low. RIDICULOUSLY good. Hands down best corned beef ever. Try it, it will make you very popular on Paddy's day.

This corn beef is so great. Won't make it any other way from now on. Removing the fat really helped in deleting some calorie fat contend and did not effect the favor. I cooked the carrots and potatoes separate, did like the beer taste on veggies.

I usually boil my corn beef and add cabbage, potatoes and carrots during the last hour. The beer and brown sugar is the way to go. I added a little Cajun seasoning and seasoning package. Loved the flavor of the brown sugar and dark beer. This will be my go to recipe for corn beef!

Everyone liked this recipe, even the kids, who complained before tasting it because 'beer is icky'. After trying it, they asked to have it every St. Patrick's Day! I have made this twice now, in the crock pot. Last year's wasn't as good, tough and stringy after extra hours in the crock pot - I realized I had bought a tip instead of a flat. Any advice on how to get the tip nice and tender?

FANTASTIC!!! I've made this recipe several times...absolutely delicious & always a hit with the men :) It makes me wonder why corned beef is only sold during St. Patty's Day - sometimes I buy two and freeze one to make this tasty comfort food now & later! I baked mine in the oven for the required time & it came out perfect!

I was skeptical at first but this is absolutely delicious!  I cooked it in the slow cooker and added potatoes, carrots and cabbage near the end.  The veggies were SO GOOD cooked in the sweetened beer brine.  I may be from  New England but not sure if I will ever go back to the New England way of cooking corned beef again.

I cooked it in my slow cooker; maybe that was the problem- I didn't follow directions.  Mine turned out bitter- like the taste of cooked Guinness.  I had added potatoes/cabbage about an hour before it was finished, as other reviewers had suggested, and boy, did they pick up the bitter flavor I am talking about.  Maybe at some point I will try it again, and this time follow the directions as written.

I'm learning through trial and error that tough cuts of meat must be cooked for as long as it takes to get tender.  Use the time given as a guideline and at the end test to see if it pulls apart easily.  This recipe is delicious if you cook it long enough.

My family loves this recipe.  It is so moist and juicy.  I do make this in the crock pot  for about 5 hrs on low.  I typically add 1/2 head of cabbage that is cut in quarters and separated about 1 hr before it's done cooking, otherwise you'll just have cabbage mush.  

Another thing is that the packaging companies seem to think one size fits all when it comes to the seasoning packet.  So we looked at the seasoning packet and supplemented with what we had on hand to make sure it was flavorful.

I have made this recipe many times over the past 7 yrs since I first found it in AR. It is the best corned beef I have ever had. The brown sugar and beer mix with the saltiness of the meat while it cooks, and makes the best tasting broth ever. The coorned beef seems alot less salty tasting as well. I will never make corned beef any other way. The only change I make is I slow cook mine in my crock pot for about 8-10 hrs, remove the meat to rest so it can be sliced..I turn the CP up to high and add red potatoes, onion, baby carrots and cook for 30 min, then add cabbage and cook another 15-20 minutes.

I will never prepare my corned beef any other way! This was simply the best. I only used half the brown sugar, added the seasoning packet that came with the beef, and a pint of my husband's homebrewed stout. Cooked it in my covered dutch oven for two hours, then added carrots and red potatoes for one more hour, then added the cabbage for another 30 min. Everything was done perfectly, and tasted great. Only wish I had doubled everything!

I personally loved this, but my family was adamant: they loved the meat, but hated the vegetables. They said the beer caused the veggies to taste too strong. (Guiness is a stout beer and has a strong bitter taste due to the hops.... a definite aquired taste) Maybe better to cook the meat and vegetables separately....

This is unbelievably good and the kids clamor for it; one thing I do is to save the Guinness for drinking and use the "ethnic" soft drink called "malta" for cooking this; every bit as good and about 75% less expensive...

I used a beef brisket that didn't come with seasoning and 1 can of Guinness that didn't quite cover the brisket completely so I ended up adding some water. It slow cooked for 6 hrs in the cockpot. The meat was juicy and tender but the flavor wasn't very strong, I liked it though and so did the family but had I served this to others say my parents I'm betting they would've added salt. I served this with an allrecipe for Roasted Root Vegetables and together it was amazing and made up for the mild flavor of the meat.

I had never made corned beef before, so I decided to try this recipe because it looked simple. It was easy to make (I used my crockpot) but it tasted like brown sugar and beer- not like beef. However, the flavor was much improved with salt.

I personally liked this alot, but I only gave it four stars because my family didn't love it. Not too salty-which is our one issue with corned beef (we don't use salt in our household, lol, so any degree of saltiness is noticeable) Super easy, super tasty, and paired perfectly with Diana's Colcannon, found on this site also!

Great recipe. Made this for 10 people for a St. Patrick's Day brunch. Even those who said they didn't like corned beef loved it! As another reviewer suggested, I used Murphy's Irish Stout instead of Guinness. It took 3 cans to cover the two 2.5lb pieces of corned beef completely. I didn't bother rubbing the brown sugar into the meat, just put it into the crock pot along with the seasoning packets. I cooked it on high for nearly 7 hours and it came out wonderful. This is definitely my new standard corned beef recipe. Thank you!

How Yuymmy!!! This is probably the best corned beef that I've ever tasted (and I'm 63).  First we used the cheaper cut of CB.  The night before we cooked it we marinated the corned beef, stout, and brown sugar in a zip top bag (refridgerated of course). We cooked it on the stove top until tender.  Removed the meat very carefully (it was that tender) and added carrots, onions, potatoes and cabbage(last).  Cooked until tender and that was it. By the way and I guess this is pretty important, I TOTALLY DISLIKE THE TASTE AND SMELL OF BEER. Infact I don't even go near my DH if he has had one.  This taste was not aparent in the finished dish at all.  Today is the day for Ruebens, can't wait!  By the way, our Shih-Tzu "Chai" (Hebrew for Life), loved her sampling.  Looking forward to next year, (or maybe a little sooner :-)! Thanks Shameless

The best corned beef i have made thus far- we did not find the flat cut as others suggested, but the tip cut was good as well.  we did use 2 bottles of Guinness to cover the meat, and did extend the cook time by about 45 minutes.. was good, tender, etc...but still could have cooked longer to fall apart more! thanks so much for sharing this recipe

WOW!!WOW!!!WOW!! I missed out on corned beef all of these years!! If I had only known it could be this good... I used a 3 lb flat cut fairly lean brisket, the full cup of brown sugar, 2 Guinness DRAFTS 11.2 oz each in bottles, and used the seasoning packet that came with the brisket. I cooked it in the slow cooker 7.5 hours total, but on high the last 1.5 hours. I turned it over twice. I added 4 red potatoes and 3 carrots with 2.0 hours remaining and cabbage wedges at 1.0 hours remaining. RAVE reviews from all!!

ive made this two years in a row now. absolutely the best corned beef ive had. today i put it in the slow cooker on low at 730 am (completely covered with the sugar- guinness mixture - i used two bottles for a 3.5 pound piece of meat and the 1 c of sugar) and turned it up to high around 4. we ate it at 7 and it was so tender it was literally falling apart.

I cooked this for my very Irish father on his birthday (which happens to be St Paddys day!) and was over the moon! It brought fond memories of his mother and in true Irish fashion led to a lot of storytelling and lies! We did add chunks of potato, carrots and onions for the last hour of cooking and cabbage for the 30 minutes. Everyone used crusty rolls to soak up extra juice on their plates. This was fabhulous! Thanks for a great recipe that led to a great family night!

Excellent, although VERY strong, almost overwhelming on the Guinness flavor, almost couldn't taste the meat last year. This year I added the 12 fl. oz. of chicken broth as well which mellowed the Guinness flavor and brought the good taste of the meat through as well. Thanks for the recipe!!!

Although I used 1/3 cup packed brown sugar instead of the 1 cup called for in the recipe, (and replaced the Guinness with some Sam Adams since that's what was in the house) this turned out amazing. My parents absolutely loved it and even my picky husband ate it!

Even though the flavor was nice, the meat was not tender as I was expecting.  Don't think I'll try it again as it seemed a waste for the Guiness.

I made this as written and LOVED it. My rack/roasting pan combo actually held the brisket (not a round) ABOVE the (single can) Guinness. Wrapped tightly and cooked in the oven, the flavor was wonderful! I made 3 briskets for New Years, and tested 2 methods. The others were more classically cooked and this was preferred. With a 4 pound brisket, I did end up cooking it about 45 minutes longer, but my oven is reliably slow. Only downside is I would not/did not choose to cook veggies with it. I'll cook the veggies with the spice pack and always do my briskets this way from now on.

Good but probably wouldn't make again.  A little too sweet and too "beer" tasting.  I used Guinness and my slow cooker.

I made this for St Patrick's Day and it was absolute perfection. It was moist, tender, and sliced easily. It was a big hit.   Just one caveat: Make a note of the cut and the brand of corned beef you buy. I have made it since, but it hasn't turned out the same! But I'll keep trying :-)

The corned beef was yummy but the Guinness was a little too strong of a flavor for our family.  I won't be using this recipe again.

Well, I gave this 3 stars because the way it came out. I used a crockpot, add the spices, brown sugar, and Guinness, and let it cook on low for about 5 hours. I added carrots and potatoes 1 hour before I pulled it off the heat. It was... different. My husband made a remark about feeling like he was at a medieval festival... The only thing that I can recommend if you are going to use a crockpot- don't cook it for so long, and put the veggies in for more than an hour. I might try this again, but follow the directions exactly...

I cooked mine in a Crock pot like many others have and the meat turned out very good.  The beer made the veggies very bitter. I will cook those separate next time.

I made this for the first time for a St Patrick's Day pot luck for my hubby. The feedback was that is was good but the flavor of the corned beef did not come up like people expect a real corned beef - it tasted more like any other roast. I made it with a few changes that other reviewer made (e.g. used 1/2 of the brown sugar, added a second bottle of Guinnes and 1 bottle of water to ensure that the corned beef was completely covered with liquid) I made it my crockpot and cooked on low for 12 hrs (overnight). I did not get a request for the recipe - next time I might  make it as written because I do not like to give low rating to a recipe that I have changed.  For our own dinner I HAD to make the recipe with the oranges from AR which has been my hubby's favorite ever since I made it four years ago!

First of all..I prefer my corned beef tender, not falling apart. Easier to slice for me. This recipe is perfect even though I changed cook time somewhat - ummmm, 2.5 hrs won't really work at a low temp for corned beef. I had exactly a 4 lb brisket (flat cut). I didn't have Guinness so used Sam Adams Boston Lager I had (but will use a stout beer next time.) I mixed the  spice packet  with 1/4 C LB sugar (since I wasn't using stout beer) and it melted into the meat while rubbing on even though my CB was rinsed and patted dry. I also went 'rack less' with roasting pan & poured the beer around it. I started this at Noon and turned brisket over every hour for 4 hours. At 4 pm I turned oven up to 325 as it didn't appear quite tender enough. Well, 1 hour later (I let meat rest for 20 min.) I had a moist/tender corned beef that sliced easily w/out shredding and the BOMB! I did throw a couple bay leaves and cloves of smashed garlic in at beginning but nothing else. Not sure that changed much. Only recipe I use now for Reuben sandwiches as it's all I want it for.  Best sandwich EVER using this recipe. Thanks!

So yummy!  First I am actually Irish and Scottish and I know corn beef.  It's normally salty and stringy, which is okay if you like that kinda flavor. Yet this recipe with the Guinness and brown sugar makes for a sweeter, non-stringy version.  Easy to make, easy to cut, so wonderful.  If your not a fan of Corned Beef normally try this, its a great twist with exceptional flavor.  Don't go over the 1 Cup of B.S, I did once and it wasn't great tasting. But the veggies in at the end as well they taste just as cooked and perfect.  Also in case some are not aware ( my pops is a recovered drinker )  the booze cooks out of this so you get great flavor and don't have to worry about the booze content for such reasons so everyone can enjoy!  I'm fond of red potatoes for this recipe as well, and chopped carrots or baby ones work either way.  I cook it multiple times a year, so enjoy!

This is the BOMB!  Made this in crock pot, with a 7 lb-er that wasn't even thawed all the way.  did it a teeny bit different--sliced half an onion to rest the brisket on, sprinkled the spice packet that came with beef over the onion, then put the brown sugar on, and poured 2 bottles of Smithwicks in, cause it's what we had in the fridge. (not as dark or strong as Guinness, kind of a lighter version).  Let the pot go on low for about 10 hours (it was a bigger brisket than recipe called for), then took the meat out to rest, took that amazing juice and cooked cabbage, carrots and potatoes in it on the stove top, just to save time.  Can you say amazing?!  I usually think corned beef briskjet is a little boring, bland and just sorta there...this recipe changed my mind!  It was sooo flavorful, tender, juicy and super easy.  Not sweet, not bitter, just perfection.  =)  Thank you!

This was absolutely delicious.  We used 2 pounds of meat and one hole beer (Guinness Stout).  We cooked it in a crock pot for 3 hours, turning every hour.  DELICIOUS!

I made this for St. Paddy's and was worried that it might be overpowering with the beer.  At the first bit the whole table was silent, then my husband very quietly said "this is awsome".  Great easy recipe.  I did add the seasoning packet that came with the meat and I'm glad I did.  Also, I used Smithwick's as most of my guests aren't huge beer drinkers.  Fantastic!

The absolute BEST!!  Easy and delicious.  As a second generation American whose four grandparents emigrated from Ireland to America, I can honestly say I've had more than my fair share of corned beef on St. Patrick's Day. This recipe tops every last one!! And that's no blarney!!

The corned beef was the best we'd ever had. I'm usually not a fan and hubby is a corned beef connoisseur. We had lots of people over for this. The only thing everyone agreed on, besides how wonderful the beef was, is that the vegetables tasted like straight guiness. Not very good.. I suggest doing them seperately in chicken broth. They were the only things left on the plate.. Thank you for sharing the recipe for amazing beef!!

I have been using this recipe for years in Houston and it always came out tender. Last year I moved to Colorado and it came out tough. So this year I will try cooking it longer as suggested by others. Much of my cooking since moving here has come out differently and I believe its the altitude. Sea level makes for superb cooking! I miss it.

This was, without a doubt, THE most tender corned beef I've ever had. I followed the instructions pretty closely, with a few suggestions taken from the other reviews. I didn't measure the brown sugar, just rubbed lightly all over the brisket. I cooked it IN the Guinness, almost covering the corned beef (it took me 3 cans). I also added in the spice packet that came with the corned beef, as a well as some peppercorns and a few cloves of cracked garlic. I covered the roasting pan tightly with foil and cooked it in a 300 degree oven for 5 hours. I think the longer cooking time is the key to a really tender corned beef. My boyfriend and I both thought it was amazing and didn't even need to use a knife to eat it. It was so tender we were able to cut it with a fork. I served this with Diane's Colcannon recipe from this site (which was also a 5 star recipe for me). This is the only way I'll make corned beef from now on.

This is better than you can imagine.  Made for my Irish Father-in-law, he was hesitant at first but then couldn't stop eating it.  A nice change to traditional corned beef.  Leftovers tasted great on a sandwich.

Delicious!  CHANGES: Cooked in slow cooker for 3 hours on high. I added half a tablespoon of peppercorns, half choppped onion, and a teaspoon of garlic. Also used the packet of seasoning/spices that came with the beef. Two hours into cooking I added potatoes, carrots, and lettuce.  I also used 2 bottles of Guiness. TIPS: The first time I made this I didn't drain out all the spices and peppercorns from the sauce.  Because of this it stuck to the vegetables and made it more difficult to eat.  The second time I waited for the meat to cook and removied it, drained the sauce so seasonings won't get stuck to veggies and let cook for an hour.

very good, I only added 1/2 c of brown sugar after reading other reviews. Made in slow cooker with veggies on the bottom & a bottle of Guiness, I could detect no beer flavor. Beef was very moist and veggies flavorable. Would make again.

I was hoping for a heavy Guinness taste, however it didn't end up that way after 11 hours in the slow cooker. I was more then happy to sink my teeth into what the recipe made however. It had a perfect blend of sweetness with the flavor of corned beef, and while the heavier notes of Guinness tended to vanish, it was absolutely delicious. My wife who I couldn't even tell her Guinness was in the recipe until after she tried it thought it was spectacular. We're in agreement here, this is our new St. Patty's tradition!

I'm sorry, this just didn't do it for me. I used the spice packet in addition to the Guinness and brown sugar. The corned beef was tough and lacked flavor. I cooked the beef right in the Guiness and flipped it a few times. I ended up throwing it in the pot with my other corned beef.. so glad I made a back-up. Many people used their slow-cooker, and rated the recipe inaccurately.

YUM! The only changes I made were I cranked the oven up to 400 for the first hour then lowered to 350 for the remaining two hours. Also I added red potatoes, carrots, and cabbage in the last hour. The sweet of the beer and sugar perfectly balance the saltiness of the corned beef. This was the best corned beef ever!

So tender and juicy.  I used 2 bottles of beer and simmered in the crock pot all day.  I wanted to test this recipe before St. Patrick's Day. I will make it again, this time with all the veggies.

I did not like this corned beef and I am not that picky.  I made as instructed and cooked mine in the crockpot for 9 hours.  It had no flavor and was not fall apart tender.  I could deal with the tender issue and try again but the flavor was awful, it had none other than a remnant taste of Guinness.

Very simple recipe - but tons of flavor.  I wont make it any other way.  I suggest Boars Head Brand Corned Beef.  It's a cut above.

I started making this recipe about a year ago and have loved it every time.  I make it at least once a month in my crock pot and it's now a family favorite.  I do have a garlic lovin' family so after the first couple times I added 2 tsp minced garlic as well as the spice packet that comes with the brisket.  Here's the amazing thing for me - my family does not drink beer or any alcholic beverages - just never developed a taste for it.  However, there is something about using that bottle of Guiness that makes the flavor of the meat fantastic.  I used to just boil my corned beef with cabbage, carrots and potatoes but no more.  This is a great recipe.

Wonderful!  Add 3-4 carrots, 2 potatoes, an onion, and additional Guiness.  Very tasty, all-in-one meal. Cook in slow cooker all day and don't forget to put in spice packet.

Amazing! Followed the recipe with very few variations using a dutch oven. Having read other reviews, I did extend the cooking time by one hour. Added the carrots at T minus one hour... added the cabbage at T minus 15-minutes.

SOOOOOO good.  Seriously.  And simple!  I made two, one with just cabbage and one with everything else plus cabbage (onions, potatoes, carrots).  The beer infuses the veggies and the meat in the most sinful way, it's amazing.  Add the second bottle halfway through cooking and it's so juicy, flaky, meaty...I am in love with this recipe.  Non-stout (dark beer) drinkers beware though, it tastes of stout.  So, if you really, really don't like stout, don't try it.  Use the silly little seasoning packet that comes with the brisket.  But seriously...soooooo good.  I made the "Amazing Irish Soda Bread" recipe from this site as well and it complemented it wonderfully.  Both recipes are very easy and it makes your living space smell great while you relax, waiting for dinner to finish cooking itself.

i made this as noted, except my beef was only 3 pounds. i used a home corned beef, as i had access to fresh free range angus beef from our neighbor. it was pretty good, but not knock off your socks. very tender. i cooked it on low in my le cresuet type pot for about 5 hrs with the lid on. added the pre peeled carrots from the bag  and red baby potatoes one hr before, but could have used a little more cooking time to soften them even more. i will try this with a a commercially corned beef (a traditonal red corned beef) and report back on the difference. we are having reubens today for day 2 dinner with chips and pickles...

How can something so good, be so easy. It would get 10 stars form my family. I invited my sister over and her and my husband just kept saying how wonderful it is. Made the cheddar cabbage casserole and cornbread WOW what a keeper. Cant wait to do it again and have more people rave about it. Thank you for this recipe........

AMAZING! As others suggested I used a flat cut and trimmed the fat. I put it in the slow-cooker, on low,  at 9:00 AM with one cup of brown sugar and it took 3 cans of guinness to cover it (I did have a little sip of the third can, I love guinness!) 11 Hours later, it was absolutely perfect! I put potatoes, cabbage and carrots in 1 hour before it was ready, and I should have done that two hours before. It was served at our St. Patricks day party and everyone, EVERYONE, raved about it! I will definetly make it from now on.

DELICIOUS! A nice twist on corned beef.  I made a traditional corned beef and this recipe and this recipe won out for being the most popular.  As other reviewers have stated, I did roast it for an additional hour and it could have even been in the oven a little longer.  Just check it towards the end of the roasting time.  Very tasty!  You won't be disappointed making this one!

Absolutely delicious. I will never boil corned beef again. I used a flat cut and roasted for 6 hours, adding cabbage, new potatoes, onions and carrots after 3 hours. The flavor in the vegetables was incredible and the meat just came apart in shreds. Best corned beef I've ever had!

Loved it! Served this for company tonight for an early St. Patty's; it got rave reviews.  We used the slow cooker method, and during the last hour added carrots and parsnips and turned the cooker on high.  Very tasty.

This was part of my St. Patrick's Day themed meal last night. I cooked it in the crockpot for almost 10 hours with 2 cans of the Guinness. I also used the seasoning packet that came with the beef. The corned beef came out very tender, but I didn't like the flavor of the Guinness. Next year, I'll just use a beef broth.

This was very good. I would use a different beer next time. I'm not a huge Guinness fan but this company also makes Smithwicks Beer which I think would be great. I use this beer when I do Beer Can Chicken and Beer Can Turkey.

not bad - my brisket didn't come with a seasoning packet, and I think that would have made it perfect.  Next time I will make sure to get seasonings, and I'm sure it will be 5 star

This is an awesome dish! Very easy to prepare and absolutely effortless from the time you pop it into the oven until it's done! I added some new potatoes and carrots 1/2 hour before done, and they were the tastiest ever! I run a business from home and on ebay, selling incense oils, jewelry etc, and doing Psychic Tarot and Crystal Ball readings so I don't have a lot of time to cook, but this meal is fast and fabulous. I predict that we will be having this one more often! :)

I made this for St. Patty’s day; everyone we served it too loved it.  I'm giving it 5 stars because of all the compliments.  I still just don’t care for corn beef.  We didn’t realize how much it was going to cook down (I used a crock pot) so we ended up chopping it up and putting it back in the pot with some cabbage and serving it as soup.  Several people asked for the recipe.  We used a flat cut, I think I used an extra can of Guinness to cover the meat, I also used the seasoning packet.

This was good. It was sweet and tender. I made sure to almost completely submerge the beef and veggies in the beer to keep them moist and tender. I used 4 bottles in all and the carrots and onions did seem to go very well with the flavor. The other veggies were just meh.

I'll never boil another corned beef after making it this way. (If you made this and it came out tough or dry, it's probably because 2 1/2 hours is not long enough for a four pound brisket.) With reviewers' suggestions, a tweak of my own and an extra hour, this came out unbelievably good, moist, and tender. I was going to include my variation in the review but it's too long, so I've submitted it as a recipe titled 'Revised Guinness® Corned Beef'. It mainly involves doubling the beer, bringing the meat to room temp before cooking, putting a layer of onion slices underneath the brisket, and cooking an extra hour. This was not only better tasting, but was so much easier than cooking on the stovetop, that next year I'm thinking about corning my own beef before making it this way. I'll also try using a bigger pan with more beer, so I can add the veggies to the braising pan. Also, do *not* be afraid that this will taste too beery-- I don't even like beer, but not only was the beef delicious, the leftover combination of cooked beer, onion slices, and rendered brisket made an wonderful (if a tad salty) jus to go with it. It ain't health food, but it is AWESOME.

My first corned beef as well. I felt that it was ok to go out on a limb with this since the meat was on sale. I don't understand why others had such a hard time with this. Maybe they got larger cuts? I followed the recipe ommitting the rack and I used dark brown sugar. I didn't add the flavor packet and I added my veggies an hour before done. It was so tender and TRULY 'melt-in-your-mouth'! It's tough to impress a chef and I did so with this fisrt recipe!

This was the best corned beef I've ever tasted!  I only gave it 4 stars because I adapted it based on other reviews:  Cooked a 3 lb. corned beef for 5 hrs. on High in the slow cooker.  (Put some chunks of potato, carrot and celery in first.  I served it along with "Fabulous Fried Cabbage" and corn bread.

This was awful! I had a lovely piece of corned beef that I wasted on this recipe.  I don't care for stout, but after reading the reviews I bought a six-pack just for this recipe, forgoing my grandma's traditional boiled recipe that I adore.  Now I have 5 bottles of beer I won't drink, and corned beef that I can't eat.  I've cut off all the outside to rid it of the stouty flavor, and tonight I'll cook it in a casserole to try and make it edible.  Grandma, I never should have doubtd you.

This was my first year attempting a St. Patrick's Day dinner.  I found this recipe and just had to try it since my husband is a big fan of Guinness.  Since we were having company over, he insisted I also do a traditional boiled corned beef.  Well...the Guinness one was devoured and the boiled one was only consumed after the Guinness one was gone.  I did mine for 10 hours on low in the crockput and it was just amazing!

I made this for St. Patrick's Day and it was fabulous even though I didn't use a Guinness but used Honey Brown beer and it still turned out great.  I used two bottles instead of the one to cover for my crockpot.  Also added some black peppercorns, one onion, small Yukon Gold potatoes and carrots.  I cooked the cabbage and bacon seperately.  I will definitely make again.

Tried this last St. Patrick's day, but lost the recipe.  So glad to find it again.  Be sure to use the pickling spices that come with your brisket, or add a couple of tablespoons.  This makes for a slightly sweet beef, but seem to cut the salt a little too.

This recipe was GREAT!  I cooked the corned beef for St. Patricks day and everyone loved it.  My husband said that was the best corned beef that he has ever had.  The only thing that I did different was covered the corned beef and added potatoes.

This recipe is a keeper! It was extremely easy.  Excellent flavor - the sugar gives it just a hint of sweetness.  The Guiness made a nice dark, rich broth.  I also added pickleing spices.  I would make this again.  Don't skimp on the beer!

Great!  Easy!  First corned beef I've cooked  (40 years experience) that did not shrink or get tough.  Will never sinner one again - the oven's the way to go, the Guinness gave it a succulent flavor.

I thought this was going to be great - and was SO disappointed.  It was tough and stringy and the beer flavor was a nasty unwelcome addition. I made the vegetables in broth on top of the stove and it was a good thing - it's all we ate of the meal.  2 thumbs down for this recipe.  I will stick with the tried and true stovetop method from now on.

I get a corned beef round at my local butcher. (They make their own corned beef) I have made my corned beef ONLY this way since trying this recipe. It is the best recipe ever! On the side I serve Colcannon. Then some roasted carrots. The family cannot believe the fantastic flavor. I think using a round is the ticket. Worth every penny!

Excellent idea for a recipe. However, I've made a slight change and it came out great. I used the seasoning packet along with the brown sugar, put it in a slow cooker (made sure it was completely covered in Guinness) on low for 7-8 hours. Added some vegetables (cabbage, potatoes, and carrots) when it had 2-3 hours left and turned it from low to high. I also added some habanero mustard for an extra kick.

This is the best corn beef I've ever had. I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar, mixed with 2 bottles of Guinness and pickling spice. Placed everything in the slow cooker for 10 hours on low. Absolutely amazing, I was a little concerned about the meat having a sweet flavor, I'm really glad I didn't omit it all together. Adding the pickling spice is a must!

nice.  I made some changes.  Instead of brown sugar, I used Agave - it's how i roll.  And to the two German beers (sorry, it's what I had), I used chicken broth to make the liquid cover the meat; I added bay leaves, garlic, ground chili peppers, salt, thyme, pepper.  I roasted in the oven for 2+ hours.  I braised the cabbage, onions, and carrots separately.

It has been a very nice St. Pat's day, IMHO.

I really did not care for this at all.  I could taste the Guiness and it wasn't what I was used to with corned beef.  Next year will try something else.

Incredible! Recipe is great as-is but, as many have mentioned, DO add the little packet of spices that comes with the brisket. I also used my Nesco oven/slow cooker at about 225 degrees for 7 hours and it was perfect! Since corned beef is still available a week after St. Patricks I'm gonna stock up and freeze it so I can make this in the summer. Also, Murphy's Irish Stout works just as well as Guinness.

I used a point cut brisket and it took 2 bottles to cover the roast but it turned out very good.  The brown sugar made it a little on the sweet side and I prefer the briney taste of traditional corned beef but it was very tender.  Thanks for the great recipe

Wish I could give this more stars it was so good. I also wish I had bought a bigger corned beef as there wasn't much leftover! The secret is to COVER the corned beef with the beer, it took 2 cans of beer and I added about 1/2 cup water. I also kept it in the oven for an extra hour and added potatoes and carrots to it for the last hour. This was not overly sweet at all, the few leftovers I did have were very good. This is our only way of cooking corned beef now.

This was such a great thing to do on St. Patrick's day, I simmered it for 8 hours in my crock pot and by the end of it, everyone was quite hungry and the house still smells delightful.

Super easy!!  I did it in the slow cooker on high for 8 hours- adding veggies in the last 2 hours and cabbage the last 30 minutes.  I added a little water to make sure I covered the meat all the way and turned the meat halfway through the cooking time.  I also trimmed the fat off the meat before cooking.  Everyone loved it!!

This recipe was fantastic. It was my first taste of Corned Beef ever and I was not disappointed. My boyfriend and I threw this in the crock pot at 7:00AM. Through out the day I continually rotated it. At 7:30PM it was cooked perfectly. Super moist, falling apart and melting in your mouth. We took the left over Guinness that it cooked in, threw 3 tablespoons of flour in it and cooked it on high heat on the stove top. Made for a GREAT gravy! Yum! This was a total success. Thank you!

Third year in row!  This method of cooking corned beef is the only way to go.  I made it in a large crock pot with 2 bottles of Guinness Extra Stout and 1 cup heaping (packed) of brown sugar.  I needed a little more liquid to cover the meat so I added about 2 cups of filtered water.  Guinness flavor is soooooo strong, it does no harm.  In fact, I like it a little better with a bit of water.  Cooked on high for 4 hours then added quartered red potatoes and peeled 3 inch carrot pieces.  Because of the saltiness of the beef, it is good to do a 2 to 1 ratio of potatoes to carrots to make sure there is enough starch presence in the broth to drink up some of the sodium.  Threw in some peeled whole smallish onions (leave root attached and they will stay together) at the same time.  Cooked it all for another 75 minutes.  30 minutes before serving, put some wedges of cabbage (leave in the core and wedges will stay together).  Served with Irresistible Irish Soda Bread I made this morning (added soaked raisins cuz we like 'em) alongside with some whipped butter.  It's a fantastic meal and even kids raved!  I think they posted something on Facebook about how good it was!  Now that's a coup!!

My husband really liked it!  But, the only think I did need to do was place a glass measuring cup on top of the meat while it was cooking.  It wanted to float in the beer!  I even had trimmed off most of the fat!  Yummy!

The Guinness does give the corned beef such a unique, wonderfully different taste than the standard, old recipe! I had to use almost two cans of beer to entirely cover, and keep the meat submerged. Also, I went with the suggestions about going ahead and adding the included spice pack that comes with the beef.  One warning, do not try to add the veggies too soon to the cooking. Last year I added them in for longer than an hour (maybe closer to 2 or 3) and wow did they turn bitter! The potatoes were salvageable, but the carrots and onions - yuck! But don't skip putting the veggies in, they would have been awesome if I wasn't trying to cook them way too long in beer!!!
Enjoy this one, my entire family sure did!!!

This really is exceptional. You wouldn't think the brown sugar and beer would go well together, but the combination of sweet and bitter melds extremely well!  I do use the spice packet from the brisket.  I cut my meat into chunks, then rub all sides of the chunks with brown sugar.  I may end up using slightly more than a cup of brown sugar all told.  I then add two bottles of beer and braise for four hours.  I make the vegetables separately.  There isn't enough room in my Dutch oven for them, and I prefer my cabbage cooked differently.

The meat is delicious cooked like this. Just don't do what I did and cook it in the crock pot with the vegetables. It gave the vegetables a burnt taste. That could be why they are not listed in the recipe!! :-P

Great recipe.  I only make corned beef once a year on St Patrick's Day but after trying this recipe my family has requested it more often.  I do cook it in my slow cooker and it is very tender.  The beer and brown sugar flavors mix magnificently.  I do use the flavor pkg that comes with the brisket.  This recipe is awesome, no need to try any others from now on.  Thanks for offering this recipe.

I am giving this only 3 stars on account of there was very little flavor. I used 2 cans of Irish Stout. Added water until meat was covered. I used the gray flat cut without the added spices in the pouch. I added pickling spice. Just didn't get the flavor I was looking for.

If I could rate it higher, I would. The whole family loved it.. even the 2 year old! The only thing I did different was to leave it in the oven longer.. maybe 3-3 1/2 hours.

I made this exactly like the recipe except for cooking about 2 hours longer. Lifted the rack out and added the veggies  I laid the beef on top of the veggies and covered about an hour before dinner. DH loved loved loved it. I thought it would be too sweet but it was perfect. I used Guiness Draught.I think I'll try it on a rack in the crock pot next time.
EDIT: Tried it in the crock pot but we didn't care for it as much. I put a rack in the bottom and did everything the same. I'll wait for winter and do it in the oven again.

WOW!!!  This is hands down the BEST corned beef recipe I've ever used & from now on will be the only one.  I did use the crock pot & added carrots the last hour.  The meat was literally falling apart when I took it out.  Delicious & I never knew corned beef could be this tender!

I followed the recipe exactly.  I love corned beef and I love stout beer.  I was greatly disappointed.  The end product was a tough piece of meat that tasted like beer.  I think I might try this again with my regular spices and a splash of stout beer.

A friend made this and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD!  I was trying to figure out what she had used in it.  So I was saying.. kinda sweet, yet there is this other, OH it is marinated in beer?  I was close.  It was SO good, and I asked her for the recipe and she sent me here.  Fantastic and looks really easy.  I will make this myself.  Thanks

WOW is all I can say. This was by far the BEST corned beef we have ever had. I trimmed the fat and cooked it in the crock pot with 2 bottles of Guinness adding the veggies for the last 3 hours and the cabbage for the last hour.

The flavor was scrumptious!  I did make some changes, but just a couple.  I boiled the brisket for 2 hours in plain water.  Threw that oily water out.  Put 3 cans of guinness and 1 cup of brown sugar and the seasoning packet in my dutch oven and covered and baked for another 2 hours at 350, turning it at 45 min as another reviewer suggested.  Then I added carrots and red potatoes, cooked another 30 min.  It was the best tasting corned beef I've ever had and the brown sugar and beer made the carrots taste almost candied.  I will try adding the onion I forgot next time.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

Love this recipe and use it every year.  I slow cook mine in the oven in enamel roasting pans.  Crock pots are easier but you do not get the same flavor.

Awesome! I rubbed the meat with the brown sugar and sprinkled the spices that came with it plus 1 bay leaf crumbled, 10 peppercorns, and 1 teaspoon mustard seed over it and refrigerated it in the removable crock of my crockpot the night before cooking.Took it out and poured a whole pint of Guinness over it, cooked it for 9 hrs. on low, very very flavorful..

Delicious!  I'm a corned beef lover normally but this exceeded my expectations.  The only changes I made were to place the meat into the beer while cooking and add one beef bouillion cube.  I did baste everything a couple times during cooking after I added the veggies.  I'll be adding this into the regular dinner rotation since it's too good to make only once a year!

Oh my....so good!  We used an Irish Porter....my husband said that was close enough to a stout, and it worked well.  I cut the slab of fat off of  the side as one reviewer recommended, so that the flavor could infuse.  Very tasty dish.

I cooked this recipe for St. Patrick's day and my husband and I really liked it.  I used Guinness ale and it sure turned out very tender.  Since I did not have a rack for my roasting pan, I put in my cast iron pot and it was terrific.  Will use this recipe again.

AWESOME!!!  MAKE SURE TO USE A FULL CUP OF SUGAR!  If you rub some on the corned beef, put the rest into the guinness in the Pot.  A friend of mine made it but never put it into the pot and hers came out totally different.  Sugar is the key!!  Be sure to use seasoning packet and add your own seasonings too!  A winner!   I added in cabbage the last hour too.  Delish!

While not what I'd call traditional, this recipe was a great new take on corned beef!  First: is was very very very easy.  Secondly: the flavor was fun.  The sweetness of the brown sugar + stout was a great addition to what is otherwise pretty salty.  My mother thought it tasted a little like ham, my husband compared the salty-sweetness to spare ribs.  At any rate, it was a hit. (I used a Point Cut corned beef, and I did add the spice packet that came with it.  Made it in a dutch oven, 2.5 hours and it came out tender.)

This was absolutely amazing. I made the 4 pound brisket in a slow cooker, using half the posted brown sugar.  The meat was amazingly tender, slightly sweet but with a wonderful depth of flavor. I took it to dinner on St Patrick's Day, and 4 people devoured the entire brisket! Will definitely make this again.

Surprisingly fabulous!  I don't even like beer, and I was not at all sure of the combination of corned beef and brown sugar, but my husband encouraged me to try this recipe and it was FANTASTIC!  The corned beef was as tender as can be, and the flavor was wonderful -- not sugary sweet as I thought it might be.  Like other reviewers suggested, I added the seasoning packet that came with the corned beef and did not use a rack in the bottom of the pan.  Couldn't be better!

This was sooo good!!  Make sure to really wash the Corned Beef though cause otherwise it's way too salty!!  I also cooked in a slow cooker.  Bought it on sale for .99c a pound and used two 2lb packages.  I cooked on high for 8 hours and it was pull apart tender.  I also used 3 bottles of Guinness which covered it right up.  Happy St. Paddy's Day!!!

Very good! I did this in the slow cooker as follows: Remove the fat from one flat cut of corned beef and rub generously with light brown sugar. Place 5 pepper corns, 6 cloves of garlic peeled and slightly crushed, and one large bay leaf in slow cooker. I did not use the spice packet included with the corned beef. Add the corned beef, cover with Guinness (R) and place top on slow cooker. Cook on low for 6 hours then add your vegetables and increase to high for about 2 hours our until done. I used baby Yukon gold potatoes, 1 onion; quartered, 1 small head of cabbage; quartered, and some carrots peeled and cut to size. If you haven't cooked corned beef in a slow cooker before, please note that is does shrink by about 1/3 so be sure to buy larger than you think you will need. To serve, let the beef cool for 15-20 minutes and then slice against the grain. Arrange in a large serving dish surrounded by the vegetables. Try serving with stone ground mustard or my favorite, apple cider vinegar for dipping.

I really did not care for this recipe.  Cooking the corn beef this way did not produce the wonderful salty broth that you can use to cook the potatos and cabbage that you get with the traditionally cooked corned beef.  Also, made the corn beef taste like a bottle of beer.  They should call this recipe "Beer Meat"

What a tastey twist to the corned beef I am used to having and it turned out great!  I have never cooked corned beef on my own and was putting all my faith in the allrecipes members' ratings and they didn't lead me in the wrong direction! The tricky part was how do I cook 4 briskets@once?  Crockpots! I didn't use an entire cup for each cut, I eye balled the amounts and covered each piece in brown sugar.  I then added 2 bottles of Guinness and it didn't cover the beef so I added water to make sure everything was covered.  Temp on LOW for about 8-10 hrs, perfection.  3 briskets were gone in record time and the 4th make great leftovers.  Once you have corned beef like this, its hard to have it any other way!

We had only a 2.5lb piece of corned beef, so only used 1/2C of sugar, but still used the full can of beer to cover the meat.  Ended up baking it for almost 4 hours and was super tender and tasty.  I don't think you can really over bake this, as long as you still have enough liquid in the pan.

Let me begin by admitting that I am a terrible cook. I have very little patience in the kitchen and because I rush I often miss steps and ruin the meal. So when I found a meal with only 4 ingredients I jumped on it! I'm married to an Irishman and have been making boiled (eww) corned beef for years. NEVER AGAIN. This recipe is truly fool proof. I used a dutch oven at 300 for about 4.5 hours. I trimmed the fat, covered the meat in 1 c of brown sugar and poured 3 bottles of Guinness in the pot, nearly covering the whole meat. It was amazing, a little bitter and sweet at the same time, and we did not need knives to cut it! I didn't want bitter veggies, so I cooked the cabbage, carrots and tatoes seperate. I also used a buttermilk soda bread recipes from Allrecipes. All in all a very impressive meal, and a new St Pat's tradition for our family.

Cooked for 6 hours on high on my slow cooker.  Really good.  Added onion, potatoes, carrots and cabbage with about 2 hours to go.  My toddlers sucked down a ton of meat.  Want to add, I do not like Guinness (beer wuss) and I used two bottles.  This recipe does NOT taste like Guinness.  =)

Outstanding.  I made this at the suggestion of a friend for St. Patrick's Day.  I used the dutch oven, but I slow cooked it at 250 degrees for 7 hours.  I added potatoes, carrots and onion with 2 hours to go, and cabbage with one hour to go.  It was beautiful and tasted delicious!

Slow and low is the way to go.  You need to be sure the corned beef is covered with guinness.  It took me 4 bottles.  I also used the spices that came with the beef and it turned out excellent.

I think this was the best corned beef and cabbage I ever made or had for that matter. So much more tender than boiling and the flavor and aroma was wonderful!!! I was unsure about the brown sugar but coupled with the Guiness; superb!  So simple and so good. I wasn't planning on uploading my pictures tonight but I am only because maybe it will get someones attention and they'll also try this method. Thank you Shameless, who ever you are. :)

I did this in my crockpot for almost 10 hours... tried hard to keep it covered with the guiness, but it kept floating up and it was kinda tough. Guess I'm back to making it the old fashioned way :)

My family loved it! I had to use 5 bottles of Guinness to cover the roast, though. That was a LOT of beer! I'm not sure if I liked this flavor better than my traditional recipe, but my family did. They want me to cook it like this all of the time!

Absolutely the best. This is the only way I'll cook corned beef anymore. Guiness Stout wouldn't be my favorite drinking beer, but it works perfectly for this recipe. The only trouble I had was over-filling my crock pot with too much corned beef.

Have made this 2 years in a row, and a couple times in between, and it's a keeper.  I'm OCD about trimming the fat off, I know!, but it's still so good!  I use a little less sugar, and it still comes out great.  Throw in veggies anytime, I save for last couple hours, and you'll have a great meal & lunch the next day!

This was really good, I ended up cooking it in the crock pot for 4 hours on low and 2 hours on high, was very tender. I think I would have liked a little stronger taste, even cooking it with only beer, still was just a little too mellow. Cooked all vegetables with it except for the cabbage. Even my little kids loved it.

This was really good. I recommend starting off with two cans of beer. I added more beer before putting in vegies to cook and it made the vegies somewhat bitter. Although, my hubby who doesn't care much for corned beef didn't think so. Also, rather than use the cheap cut, it is so worthwhile to use the flat cut!

flavor with the guiness is great but don't recommend adding vegtables with it. this is a very good recipe but my personal preference is the more with the traditional corned beef.  Nice to have a way of using guiness since it is too strong for me to drink  :)

Terrific! Hubby and kids all loved it- none left for sandwiches, unfortunately. I did cook in crock pot with seasoning packet, carrots (to act as rack of sorts) and a scant bottle of Guinness (had to make sure it was good!). I was worried since hubby doesn't tend to like sweet and savory meats but the beer and sugar really balanced out the salty meat. Will make this every year. Thanks!

This was a hit with my family for St Patty's Day. I made three corned beef flats (about 12 lbs, fat trimmed off), put them in crockpots. I divided two bottles of beer and the cup of brown sugar between them. Cooked on high for five hours. I preboiled the potatoes for ten minutes then added the last 90 minutes. I suctioned some juice from the crockpot to cook the cabbage in separately on the stovetop.   The guys loved this. It's going to be my new method from now on.

Excellent! I tried this for the first time this weekend for a large gathering. Like some of the other reviewers I also did the old standby just in case. However this is the one that was raved about by all. I used a couple more bottles of the Guinness stout as my brisket was about 6 1/2 pounds. I put a little bit of spicey musturd on top before adding the brown sugar and topped it off with raw onion. Covered with tin foil and didn't touch it for 4 hours. Then added the veggies and covered again, put it back in for another hour and perfect.

Planned to take this to a St. Patricks Day party at work, and everyone loved it - said it was the best Corned Beef they'd ever had!  I did make one modification to the recipe - I used 1/2 c. of brown sugar instead of a full cup because I really don't care for sweet meat. The 1/2 c. turned out to be perfect, and the Guinness taste was more prominent!  LOVED IT!!!

This was my first time ever making corned beef and cabbage for St. Patrick's Day, and this recipe was SO good!  I cooked it in my crock pot on low for 7 hours, adding the potatoes for the last 2-1/2 hours, and the cabbage for the last hour.  Next time I think I'll steam the cabbage separately, because it soaked up too much of the Guinness and my kids didn't like it so much.  Otherwise, this meal turned out perfect!  I made corned beef hash with the leftover meat and potatoes today for lunch.

Great recipe!  I cooked for 8 hours on low in the crockpot using 24 ounces of Guiness and about half of the spice packet that came with the beef.  This made a wonderful main course and great sandwiches for the few leftovers.  Will make again!

I made this  for St. Patrick's day but I'm a little behind in reviewing it. This was my first time ever making Corned Beef so I was pretty nervous about messing up. I couldn't find Guinness at the local supermarket or package store - so I substituted 2 bottles of Sam Adams' Irish Red. I also read A LOT of reviews for other corned beef recipes and they all mentioned adding whole spices. I added 2 Bay leaves, 2 palmfuls pickling spice 1 palmful each minced dried garlic and  onion, 1 palmful whole peppercorns and a couple of sprinkles of coarse sea salt. I also spread a little brown sugar to cover the long flat ends of the brisket. I simmered it on low heat for 2.5 hours - adding potatoes and carrots for the last 25 minutes. Absolutely EXCELLENT. It was even better the next day when I used them to make Reuben sandwiches. I'll definitely be making this again.

This was so good, I was pleasantly surprised. I wonder if those who described theirs as "tough" and "dry" remembered to COVER it before putting in the oven.  I tightly covered mine with heavy duty aluminum foil. It was so tender. At first, I did as recipe said and put the corned beef on a rack in the pan...after awhile, I took out the rack and let the beef cook in the Guinness...let it cook a little longer than prescribed...it was fork tender. Added potatoes and carrots last 45-50 min. Served with "Fried Cabbage II" recipe from this site.  Will only cook it this way from now on. Can't wait to make the leftovers into corned beef hash or tacos (yes, tacos, as served at our local irish pub! delicious with shredded cabbage, a bit o cheese on soft corn tortillas...)

My parents have traditionally made corned beef and cabbage in a pressure cooker, but I was tired of the gummy, stringy quality of the meat and used this recipe instead.  WHAT AN AWESOME CHANGE!  I was a little wary about cooking it in the oven, and I didn't have time to slow cook it all day, so I followed the advice of a previous reviewer: I trimmed off a lot of the fat, rubbed the meat with the brown sugar, put it in a pot and poured in two cans of Guinness and enough water to cover the meat.  I also added the spice packet and found that it helped give the meat flavor.  Brought this to a boil, then covered the pot and lowered the heat, allowing it to simmer for about three hours.  I periodically flipped the meat around and added a little more water to make sure it was mostly covered by liquid.  By the end, it was moist and pull-apart tender.  I did cook the cabbage and potatoes in the pressure cooker with Guinness instead of water and those turned out great, too.  My dad couldn't stop raving about it!

I tweaked the recipe a bit by adding a can of ginger ale and a 1/4 cup less of brown sugar. Cooked it on low for 9 hours and it was excellent!!

This is absolutely the best corned beef recipe I've ever tried.  I used two bottles of beer (Yingling - there's nothing better!) to ensure that the meat was completely covered, and used the seasoning packet that came with the roast.  My family raved!

I made this recipe and a traditional corn beef for the same dinner party, hands down this was the favorite at the table.  I don't typically have guiness in the house, so I used the beer on hand and it was deelish.

Wonderful! I added an extra 1/2 bottle of Guinness, 2 bay leaves, crushed peppercorns, mustard seed, celery seed and dry mustard powder. Absolutely delicious! I used a small casserole dish and lid w/out a rack. It barely fit, but I wanted as much of the meat covered in beer. I added potatoes and carrots too! This is our new corned beef recipe..no more boiling! The only change I will make will be to cook it on low in the slow cooker. It was very moist, but not as tender as it would be in a slow cooker.

I figured there had to be a better way to cook a beautiful corned beef brisket better than throwing it in a pot of water with the prepackaged seasonings like I've been doing for the past 10 years and this recipe was exactly what I've been looking for! I was a bit leary about using the whole 12 oz. can of Guinness (we have an 89 year old who despises alcohol), so I used only 1/2 the can and added chicken broth to compensate (would've used beef broth but I was all out). I was also worried that the meat would taste overly sweet with the brown sugar rub. But I shouldn't have worried. This recipe was flawless. I cooked it exactly as the recipe says and the corned beef came out fabulous! It was tender and juicy and maintained all it's flavor without the over abundance of spices you get in the little packet. Thanks so much for offering this recipe. It's a keeper!

Best corned beef! Even my Irish hubby from Buffalo says it's the best he's ever eaten. The combination of brown sugar and beer adds a subtle, sweet/smoky taste to the beef. I added one can of beef broth along with the beer and kept basting, and added peeled, chunked potatoes at the last hour. Paired it with "Fried Cabbage II" from this site. I've put this one in my recipes file, it'll be the only one I use now for corned beef!

Wow!  I did this one in the crock-pot, as one of the reviewers suggested, and it was just great.  I served it with another recipe from Allrecipes.com: Beer Rye Bread.  My husband had a cold and could smell it cooking!

I changed this by using O'Doulh's Premium Amber(non-alcoholic), a crock pot , and seasoning packet.  We think it is wonderful!!! The beer gives it a good base and is only noticeable in the aftertaste.  I am not sure that the beer couldn't be replace and still get a good flavor.  The brown sugar is the special part of this recipe.  I will use this recipe from now on. Thanks.

FYI - This will make your house smell like beer.

This was excellent.  I have made it in the oven as well as in the slow cooker and both turn out good if done correctly.  Since I needed the oven for my soda bread I made it in the slow cooker.  I also used 2 beers to cover more of the beef.  I used some of the leftover beer to reduce down and made Guiness glazed carrots.  Awsome meal!

only gave it four stars, because i have no idea what this tastes like, im going on the reviews of my family and friends who tried this. 
2 years ago in college i decided i was going to make a fabulous st. patty's feast and i did. i saw this recipe and i thought, well im pretty resourceful and i jumped at the opportunity to stray from the norm and try something new (but i also made the boiled just in case)and finally cook with beer!!! 
my mother is 100% irish and practically disowned me for making such a suggestion.... but after making it 2 years in a row and having everyone rave about it she has finally conceded and asked me to make it this st. pat's at home.

Sadly, I have to say I didn't enjoy this recipe at all. After reading previous reviews, I reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup. It was still exceedingly sweet. The meat was tender, but the flavor was not what I expected after reading all the reviews. My husband, who has never had corned beef before, didn't like it at all.

Simply put, this is the BEST corned beef I've ever eaten. Made it for two different groups of guests and had 0 leftovers! Not even the vegetables were left. Even people who hated guinness or beer in general loved the recipe.

This turned out very well, however I left out the brown sugar since I didn't want it to be too sweet.  Next time I might try it with, just so I can taste that method also.  I will definitely cook my St. Patty's day meal using this recipe again!

YUMMY!!!  This was a great alternative to the traditional boiling method most-often used in corn beef preparation!!  I followed advice of previous reviews and placed the ingredients in my slow cooker on low for 10 hours... the meat fell apart and was extremely flavorful!  YUM!!  I did use an extra bottle of Guinness, threw in the spice packet, and utilized the full 1 cup of brown sugar.  Guinness stout is rather bitter and the brown sugar helps compensate that bitterness.  The only veggies I added were a few halved potatoes under the beef brisket (to sort of act as a rack... my slow cooker heats from the bottom and I didn't want that to overcook/scorch the bottom of the meat).  I thought the potatoes took on a lot of the bitterness, but my husband thought they were good (at least they weren't thown out).  The only disadvantage to cooking corned beef this way is that the traditional boil method allows you cook the carrots, cabbage and potatoes in the liquid... oh well, they were still good steamed on the side.

This is the best recipe.  I'm not a beer drinker but I have a home beer brewer in the house and I'm always on the lookout for recipes to use it in cooking.  I have made this recipe twice now.  The first time I followed as written.  We thought it was great but a little sweet.  The second time I decreased the brown sugar to half a cup and this was perfect. I cooked this in the slow cooker both times with great results. I think are corned beef was a little.  Also, we used guiness once and home brewed stout the other.  Before this recipe I only wanted corned beef once a year now we will have it more often. Thanks again for a recipe I would rate a 10 if I could.

Let this slow-cook all day and the corned beef was tender and moist. The very best part was the 2 cubed potatoes I added 2 hours before it was served; they took on the richest, sweetest flavor I've ever tasted. My 7 and 8 yr olds loved it, and hubby had seconds. I used two bottles of Guinness for a 2-1/2 lb corned beef. Bravo!

I made this yesterday for my family St Patrick's day dinner. I threw in the cabbage and carrots along with the brisket, and I had to fill the crockpot with water to cover veggies, so the end result from all day slow cooking gave everything a nice flavor, and the meat was tender like butter. I do not like beer, but I liked this. It did NOT have a bitter beer taste, and that was because there was water and it cooked all day.

Made this the first time for our very Irish family of 34 for St Patricks Day.  Had seven briskets cooking with six in crockpots and one in the oven (ran out of crockpots) After 8 1/2 hrs in the crockpot we all sat down to dinner but I had left two briskets still in the crockpot as we had too much corned beef.  The 8 1/2 hr briskets was a bit salty but pretty good and moist.  After dinner and 9 1/2 hrs in the crockpot we sliced the remaining two and what a HUGE difference.  The meat was far more flavorful and much more tender-less salty in taste and by far the BEST corned beef we had ever tasted. So readers, learn by my mistake and leave the beef in the crockpot for AT LEAST 9 1/2 hrs-
You will not be dissapointed! Yummy

Happy St Patrick's Day.  I decided to try a different method of cooking a corned beef and this recipe sounded good.  I however raised the temp to 350 and after 3 hours it was not done so I don't know how it could get done at a lower temp for the same time.  Ours was just shy of 4 pounds.  We cooked it another 30-40 min's and raised the temp and it got done but it certainly wasn't as tender as what we're used to from the crock pot.  Neither my husband nor I thought the Guinness did anything special so isn't worth spending the money on it.  My husband loves Guinness stout but he said he didn't taste it.  It was worth a try but won't be baking corned beef again!

EXCELLENT!The combination of brown sugar and Guiness is wonderful. This is so easy to make... a definite keeper. I cooked in the slow cooker and added the cabbage on the last hour. Everything was full of flavor. I added a bottle and 3/4 of another bottle of Guiness and cooked on low for about 8 hours. It turned out perfect.

This was pretty good.  I cooked this in a slow cooker for around 8 hours.  I did make a mistake.  I cooked this with the "fat" side down.  After six hours I tried it and did not like it.  I then cut the fat off and cooked for another two hours.  The fat did not let the meat absorb the brown sugar flavor.  Once this was corrected it turned out great.

This truly deserves "5 of 5 Stars."  My wife is Irish and grew up with this traditional meat.  She raved that this was the best she had ever tasted.  I used a four pound corn beef, light brown sugar, and two bottles of Guiness beer.  I cooked it in my slow cooker on high for eight hours.  The next morning I made fresh corned beef hash with the left overs.  I combined cubed corn beef and cubed potatoes (five) in a skillet and cooked it until the potatoes were down.  I did not use butter or oil, and relied in the oil/fat in the beef and the starch in the potatoes.  I used cooking spray to keep it from sticking.  This is great for St. Patricks Day or any day for that matter.  Thanks for this submission.

My family loved this dish.  I was afraid that the Guinness would be too strong but it was perfect.  I did take the advice of other reviewers and I put the meat into the beer.  I added some veggies for a complete meal.  We will be making this again soon!

I cooked this in my crock pot for 7.5 hours on high. Added the potatoes/carrots and cabbage wedges with 3 hours to go. Smelled wonderful but nothing was cooked. Put everything back in the crock pot the next day and re-cooked for another 6 hours on low.  That was wonderful!!!! I will make this again, but next time I will cook this for at least 10 hours on high, and I will add the veg much sooner.  If you follow other reviewers instructions you should have no problems. VERY SLOW cooking is needed!!!

My mom and I highly recommend this recipe. We made it on Sunday night for our whole family. Please buy a high quality corned beef. I think the cooking time is closer to 3 1/2 hours. Last 45 mins we added potatoes, carrots, and cabbage and they were AWESOME. We basted the veggies every 15 mins with a turkey baster! We truly loved it.

Made this on st. pats.  Used a 2.5 lb point cut corned beef, 3 large carrots and 1 red potato, cut in big chunks.  Veggies in first, sugar on the beef, beef on top of veggies, 1 bottle of guiness.  Cooked on LOW for 10 hrs.  Very tender!  It was a little too salty for me, so that's why it gets only 4 stars.  DH liked it.  Made corned beef hash the next day with red potatoes and the veggies from the crockpot.  2 thumbs up for the hash!  I also made Diane's colcannon which was fantastic, and irish tea cake (also from this site).  Thanks!

I gave it two stars for as written - Please take note of ALL the previous reviewers and cook this IN A CROCK POT NOT THE OVEN! I cooked this in the oven - omitting the rack, right in the guinness, adding the seasoning packet, and covering for the first two hours of cooking. The meat just would NOT get tender. We didn't end up eating until 9:45 pm, and it was still chewy. The next day, I threw the whole thing in the slow cooker and cooked ALL Day on low. (8 hrs) and finally it was nice and tender. After the meat was tender, my meat eating man decided the flavor was actually pretty good, but I still don't think I'll be making this again.

This was OK for me and our 2 yr old, but my husband went and made something else after tasting it.  We will stick with the boiled version from now on.  And yes, we used real Guinness. But the meat was way tougher than it is if you boil it on the stove with water and the spice packet.  And the veggies tasted funny this way.

This recipe was too easy!  I followed the instructions exactly, put the meat directly in the pan,covered it tightly with foil and fought the urge to add liquid.  The brisket was 3 Lbs and was ready in exactly 3 hours from the oven.  I feared it would be dry and tough but it was perfect.  I served it with Colcannon and Soda Bread and everything was well received.

We loved this.  Husband said had never had such a tender corned beef.  I cooked a 3lb. roast in the slow cooker for four hours on high.  I included the spices that came with the meat.  I added carrots the last 30 minutes.  NEVER had carrots that tasty before.  Served this with colcannon and it was a fantastic meal.  I did not use a stout beer.  Next time I will -- I'm sure it will be even better. I used a 12oz bottle of plain domestic beer and the 1 cup of brown sugar.  We may start having corned beef on a regular basis now.

I've been making corned beef and cabbage for many years and I thought this recipe was outSTANDing!!  I too put it in my crockpot and used the packet of herbs after covering it with Brown Sugar Twin and pouring a bottle of Michelob Amber Bock all around.  I put the potatoes, carrots and cabbage in at noon when I came home for lunch.  When we got home at 7:00 p.m. everything was just perfect!  Served with sourdough bread... yum!!

I'm 100% Irish and this by FAR is the best corned beef recipe I have come accross.  My family is dying to have it again this St. Pat's Day.  I encourage everyone to try it and get hooked!  The flavors are incredible and will be lingering in your mouth and mind for days!

I really liked this, in spite of my rubber corned beef.  I ended up having to pressure cook it for over 30 minutes to make it chewable, but that is not the fault of this tasty recipe.  I put carrots, potato, and cabbage in the bottom of the pan.  The cabbage turned out soooo good, it was the best cooked cabbage ever!

Excellent.  Of all the recipes for corned beef I've tried, this one was the best and simplest.  The only changes I made was for the veggies. Instead of adding them in the oven at the end, I sauteed them on top of the stove in butter and added the pan drippings for extra flavor.  Superb! This recipe will be a staple for future Saint Patties Day celebrations.

Just tried this recipe after always being disappointed with the slow cooker/boiled type of corn beef. All I can say is WOW!!!! Soooo much better!  The flavor is phenomenal!  I added in carrots and onions during the last hour and they were perfect wonderful flavor, in fact next time I'll add more onions they came out soo good!  The corned beef wasn't quite as tender as in the crock pot but I think it's because I had to take it out a tad early, I'm sure the longer you let it cook the more tender it will get.  Ditch your slow cooker recipes, this is by far the best!

For whatever reason I have had the hardest time making corned beef.  I've made it with water, I've made it with apple juice.  I've made it on the stove, I've made it in the crock pot.  This was the first time it came out AMAZING!  I used the crock pot (I have a large one), 4lb corned beef, 5 bottles of Guiness, and a little water so that it was submerged.  I will be making it this way from now on.

Flavor was good.  I coked as directed...corned beef was tough and veggies were still not cooked sitting in the beer for 1 1/2 hour....did not find the veggies cooked straight in the Guiness very flavorful.  Will attempt again with cooking directly in the Guiness and brown sugar.

Varied this buy cooking it in a crock pot, my family all said this is by far the best corned beef they have ever had and I have to agree. Started out frozen so I add some additional cooking time. 12 hours and it was falling apart. Saving this recipe and definitely putting this in the file for future use

Ive been using this recipe for the past 3 years now... my family refuses to go back to the traditional boiled version! I cook mine in a slow cooker on low for 8-10hrs. I like to add the seasoning packet as well as cabbage, red potatoes & carrots. Thanx for posting!!

I know you cannot please all of the people all of the time. This was my first time making corned beef and I was thoroughly disappointed. I put in in crock pot and followed directions of others, making sure the meat was covered by the beer. I also added the seasoning packet plus added garlic, peppercorns, and bay leaves. The flavor,to me, was a bitter Guinness taste and the meat was not tender. I even got the Flat cut meat as suggested and had it in crock pot for over 8 hours. It was still on the tough side. I also used the Regular Guinness Draught as I saw that the Extra Stout did not work well. Overall, this was not a good recipe choice for me.

I've made this several times and it's not only delicious and attractive (usually a rich reddish color instead of the pale brown of some traditional corned beefs), it's pretty fool-proof, as well.  You can play pretty loose with the ingredient amounts, and as long as you cook it long enough, it's tender corned beef goodness.  When I make this, I generally rub the spice mix from the corned beef and enough brown sugar to cover the top onto the meat, then pour a bottle of Guinness over/around it, fill the bottle with water, and dump that in.  You may have to add extra water, depending on how much of the meat is uncovered.  If you want a stronger beer taste, feel free to put two bottles in, instead.  Once I made this for a meeting and had to cook it the night before.  Even though it was a bit tough the next day, by cooking it for another hour or so at a high temp (and adding more beer, because I lost a bunch of liquid in transport), it still turned out amazing and got raves...hence the "fool-proof."  I usually make this in a Nesco with the temp set at 250 - 300F for several hours (at least 3-4).  If you get antsy towards the end (like I usually do) and the beef still seems tough, crank the temp up a bit to speed up cooking.  Just make sure to flip the meat every half hour or so to make sure each side soaks up the delicious liquid.  Overall, this is an awesome way to make corned beef.

I also made this in the crock pot with Guiness and it came out very well. I put it on low for about 8 hours and it was perfect. Can't say whether or not the brown sugar made a difference or not? Next time I will probably just skip the sugar.

Made this recipe last year in the slow cooker and we loved it! This year I made the mistake of using Guinness Extra Stout and the bitterness really got into the meat and even more so in to the veggies. Good recipe. I simply chose the wrong beer. I must have used the draught last year. Live and learn :-) I will still make it again :-)

Made it in a foil-covered pan of Guinness and turned every 45 minutes for a total cooking time of 2:15.  Thought it was tough at first, then realized I wasn't slicing in the right direction. Once I figured that out, it was DELISH!!!  Steamed my cabbage separately and we had a fabulous St Patrick's Day dinner. This will be our yearly tradition.

This is the second St. Patrick's day we've had this recipe. Added a few twists myself like those suggested in the reviews. Turned out great. Will use this again even though I still think it's a harsh thing to do to a Guinness.

The only way I knew to do corned beef before this was the usual "boiled dinner".  I didn't often cook it because I thought that version was boring.  Thank goodness I found this recipe--it is SO good!  I do mine in the crock pot and use the spice packet that comes with the meat.  I also add a couple of cloves and a bay leaf.  I read another review that suggested spreading the meat with a grainy mustard, and I'll try that this year for St. Patrick's Day.  I've shared this recipe with several other people, and they've all liked it too.

Had always boiled or used a crockpot in the past, but we thought this recipe was terrific, and will not change a thing.  Roasting always makes a more flavorful meat than boiling or crock pot.  The same with the vegetables you might want to add toward the end.

I'm giving this two stars because I was able to eat the meat, but nothing else.  Granted everything was cooked right, it just all tasted like Guinness...except the meat for the most part.  I'd strongly suggest only making this dish if you actually LIKE the taste of Guinness because no matter what you do, the vegetables, especially the potatoes will soak up the beer flavor.  If I try this again I will only be using a beef broth or something similar.

Whom ever thought that this recipe was tender must have teeth like a horse. I followed the simple recipe to the tee. It was the toughest piece of meat that can be. I spent $20 on a four pound Sy Ginsberg corned beef. It's boil from now on.

This was incredibly sweet! I would consider eliminating the brown sugar altogether or just adding 1T to the stout. The beef was amazingly tender though.

Very good for St. Patty's Day.  I did this in the crockpot on high for 8 hours after cutting off the fat.  I covered it with 2 cans of Guinness.  I also found a great recipe for roasted veggies since I don't care for veggies in the crockpot:

This was outstanding.  I cut off the fat and made the corned beef with two bottles of Guiness.
This was the tastiest and moistest corned beef I've made.
A definite "keeper" recipe.

This was quite good.  I used almost 3 cans of guinness to cover the brisket and I think next time I might try a combo of half guinness & half beef broth.

The corned beef was just ok, a little salty.  I put the vegetables in the last hour of cooking and they were so bitter from the beer .  I will not be making this again.

This was excellent! I, too, like so many was leery about how exactly this combo would turn out, but it was absolutely delightful!  Everyone enjoyed it-so much so my guests wanted the recipe!  Will definitely make this my corned beef recipe of choice. My beef was a little over 4 lbs, and I actually cooked it 3.5 hours and could have probably cooked it a bit longer for an even better tenderness.

Good but we found it too sweet. if I use  this recipe again, will reduce sugar to a quarter of what was suggested.  Cooked in slow cooker on low for 4 hours then added veg and an hour later added the cabbage for the last hour of cooking.

Excellent recipe! This was my first time cooking corned beef. Everyone enjoyed it! The beer turned into a delish marinade for the vegetables (onions, carrots, potatoes. Unfortunatly, the time of cooking was incorrect. I had to add an extra 90 minutes. I cooked it in the oven in a roasting pan on a rack.  Also, the recipe never stated trimming the fat off which would be good to add and also which side up when cooking. I will try this recipe again now that I know a few things; it'll be even better!!!!

This was so tasty.  Everyone who ate went back for seconds and thirds.  It takes longer to cook in a slow cooker so allot about 6+ hours for that.  We added veggies in about 30-40 minutes before it was done.  The cabbage was particularly delish.    Can't wait to eat the left overs, and next time I will buy a larger cut of meat so there's more leftovers.

In my whole marriage I had never cooked corned beef for whatever reason.  This was so easy and so delicious.  Using the tips in all the reviews, we added the potatoes and carrots initially then an hour before serving added the cabbage.  I am not particularly fond of cabbage but I loved the almost "sweet" flavor that all the vegetables had and the meat was very tender.

Awesome !!!   I was a first time corned beef maker and this recipe made me a winner !   It was too warm outside to light the oven, so I used my slow cooker - low for six hours.  I did add the seasoning package that comes with the beef.  Delicious.

I made this late on St. Patrick's Day.  I used 2 bottles of Guiness Black Lager beer.  I used a 4 lb corned beef baked at 350 degrees.  I didn't know if it was cooked enough after 2 and 3/4 hours but I took it out of the oven and served it along with boiled potatoes and buttered cabbage & noodles.

Absolutely wonderful!!!  The best corned beef I've ever had.  I did use Murphy's stout instead and I also used the spice pack that came with the package.  I also cooked it in the slow cooker for seven hours, turning it every 45 minutes.  Everyone raved about how delicious it was!!  It was just really tastey!!!

My husband said this was the best corned beef he's ever had and he would like to have this on a regular basis!  I used a cast iron dutch oven and used 2 cans of Guinness to almost completely cover the meat.  I cooked it for two hours (flipping it once mid way through) then added carrots, potatoes, cabbage, and onions to the pot and cooked an additional hour.  Delicious!

Best tasting corned beef ever! I added the pickling spice packet too. This is soo good. And I poured liquid into a pot and added veggies to cook. It only took 20 mins! I had tiny tiny red potatoes. Cabbage and mini carrots were perfect. I added the meat back in when it was done. Thanks Shameless Morrow. I also made the guinness bread with it, serving warm bread with honey butter. Enjoy everyone!

A M A Z I N G !   I made in crockpot with 2  bottles of  Guinness beer and the brown sugar.  Cooked for 6 hours on high.  It has such great flavor.  I'm so glad I bought extra corned beef to make this again in a few months.

This is the best and so easy! I make it in the crock pot. I rinsed and dried the meat.  Put the brown sugar on meat and put it in the crockpot with seasonings.  I poured 2 bottles of Guinness over meat (add potatoes and carrots during last 2 hrs) and an awesome feast has been made!

This was good. I did it in the slow cooker. I loved the sweetness that the brown sugar added. I covered the corned beef with brown sugar and then poured two dark beers around it and mixed in the spice packet. Cooked on low for about 8 hours, then added chopped cabbage and cooked on high for another hour and a half. Wonderful. Next time, I just need to make sure I get the flat cut rather than the point cut, as it was still a bit tough. Thanks for sharing!

The corned beef came out tasting good, basically like the beer. But I think I would rather drink the beer and cook a normal corned beef. While cooking it has a terrible odor that lingers, and if you add cabbage, it will become almost uneatable, due to the taste. But 3 stars because it only says the corned beef.

Incredible!! I added the spice packet that came with the brisket and had to up the Guinness to 3 bottles of draught. So amazing... I also cooked a cabbage, an onion , potatoes and carrotts seperately to go with it.

WOW!!! All my kids were not happy about trying something so authentic for St Patty's day but after eating this they are now hooked and already have asked me to make again. I cut almost all of the fat of my corned beef (A kosher one without any seasoning packet), followed the recipe exactly using guinness extra stout. I cooked mine for about 3hours and 15 minutes adding some quartered red potatoes the last 30 minutes anf then some quartered cabbage the last 15 minutes! Definitely didn't need the extra spice pack or any other seasoning! Thanks for a new meal to add to our dinner line-up

Simple and easy.  This is the best corned beef I've tasted and this was my first time making it.  I used a 3lb beef and since I didn't have a dutch oven, I covered with foil but it took longer to cook.  I cooked it for 4 1/2 hrs but it was very tender.  I recommend using a tight lid so that it doesn't take this long and you conserve more of the juices.  I cooked the cabbage separately, but I put the potatoes and carrots in on the last hour.  They were perfect.

Cooked it in the crock pot for 8 hours. Rubbery and not nearly as good as the traditional method.
Save the Guinness for the glass, use water and spice packet for tasty corned beef.

I felt that the Guinness saturated the potatoes & vegetables too much, making them very bitter.  The meat was tasty but don't think I will make this recipe again.  Will go back to my old standby .... printed on the packaging.

I'm surprised at the outstanding reviews on this one.  I followed the recipe exactly and the meat was tough (by the way, I used three bottles of Guinness).  The flavor was not as good as if I'd just used the seasoning packet and followed the package instructions.

I started with the flat piece of corned beef and rinsed it under cold water to get rid of some of the greasiness.  I also cut off as much of the fat as possible.  I rubbed it all over with brown sugar and placed it in a crockpot.  I didn't have Guinness, so I poured a bottle of Sam Adams Winter Ale around the meat, then water to cover.  I also used the spice packet included in the corned beef.  I cooked it for about 3 hours, added chopped potatoes, onions, and thinly sliced carrots and cooked another 6 hours, for a total of about 9 hours.  It was super tender and delicious.  Even my picky kids loved it!

I bought another corned beef brisket just to try this recipe for my St patrick's dinner yesterday because my family are not beer drinkers at all.  I made this recipe exactly as written except I used 3/4 c br sugar because my brisket was a bit smaller.  I cooked it for 4 hours.  It was soooo easy!! Then I also cooked a brisket the tradidtional boiled method.  My family gobbled up the Guiness one first then finished the other one. (my sister also brought one that she cooked in her crockpot...she took half of hers back home with her)

I normally boil but prefer this method much more.  It's much easier, kinder to the meat and a lot less trouble than to always worry about the water level, etc.  I also think ANY beer would work, but happened to have a Guiness beer on hand.  My only concern is that it was quite salty compared to boiling (same brand).  I think that's due to not being bathed in the water it used to be and it being cooked essentially above the liquid for the most part.  Only part of the meat was submerged due to the rack being called for.  (I turned it once.)  Perhaps I'd remove the rack next time and also add some water to the beer to hopefully lessen the saltiness a little.  But, it was very flavorful.  Last 1/2 hour I removed some of the liquid and put it in the pot of boiling water used for the potatoes and cabbage.  We use an electric knife and always slice it VERY thin like a deli would for a sandwich, just slightly thicker.

This was good, but not great. I LOVE Guinness Stout, so I thought this would be outstanding.   I used the ingredients exactly (but added an extra bottle of stout to cover the meat), and cooked it in the crock pot (like almost everyone else) and it just had no flavor.  I have a different recipe that I've been using for years that is really good, but all the rave reviews for this recipe lured me away.  This was so bland.  I regret it using it as my St. Pat's Day dinner :(

I'm shocked we were not more impressed since the other reviews were so great.  Maybe you have to like to drink beer to appreciate this recipe but in our opinion, the stout beer made the vegetables too bitter tasting (not a very good broth at all).  The corn beef turned out tasty and I liked cooking it in a dutch oven slow/low but would not do the Guinness again.  I could get just as tasty corn beef with a better tasting broth.  My husband said that I should have watered down the Guinness with beef broth since it is a strong beer for the cabbage/potatoes which absorbed the beer flavor.
Will not make again and not worth the cost of the beer.  Bummer!

Wow! I've been trying for 30 yrs to get the corned beef this tender. And the flavor in the veetables & throughout -- outrageously delicious. I baked at 275 for 4 hrs with 2 bottles of Guiness in covered pot in oven. Cut beautifully; tasted fantastic!

I used a different beer because I was too lazy to go to the store, added a glass of water halfway through, and used the slow cooker.

My rating is based on how awesome it would taste if I'd followed the recipe. Thanks for the beerspiration!

Because I'm not a fan of dark stouts like Guinness, I was hesitant to do this recipe. I doubled the recipe for 8 lbs of beef and used 2 cans of Guinness plus enough water to cover.  I added 6 cloves of lightly smashed garlic and the spice packet. Baked it for 5 hours, then wrapped the meat in foil to rest. Cooked the veges on top of the stove with some of the broth. This was the best tasting corned beef I've ever made.

10 stars!! I've been cooking corned beef like this in my crockpot for over 20 years. So glad to see a recipe with beer. It's the only way to cook corned beef, because just plain water is so bland, it's not even worth bothering with. Love it!!

First off I will say that I don't eat meat, so the review is based on my parents and mother.  If my father eating 3 helpings full is any indication...then go ahead and make this recipe.  It was rather easy.  I would suggest if using the slow cooker, keep it on high for 2 hours before lowering.

I made this last week for St. Patty's Day. I have never made a corned beef before, so that's why I wanted to do it in the crock pot. This was the best corned beef I have ever eaten! It fell apart like pot roast, and had more flavor than any roast I have ever made. I used the grey corned beef, no beer, and no brown sugar, onions, carrots, potatoes, and cabbage added at the end. Cooked 8 hours on high. A note: I would cook the cabbage separately if you like it really soft like we do. Also, I added no salt and was glad I didn't-it was salty enough. We fell in love with this so much, I bought 2 more packages the next day and froze them. I will definitely make this again very soon! Update, I made it again, and added the brown sugar, and I really personally thought it was way too sweet. I will make it with just water and veggies next time around. That's all it needs in my opinion!

I was debating on whether to cook my corned beef in the crock pot, dutch oven or this method. As I'm not a fan of Guinness beer, I was a bit reluctant. Needless to say, I'm SO happy I chose this method. I had 30 guests and I had nothing but raves. It truly was a hit. Even with the kids. Some who didn't even like corned beef, liked this! The only change I made was cooking it in the oven for 5 hours. It literally fell apart. I will only make corned beef this way from now on.

The flavor was outstanding.  I turned the heat down to 225 and baked it in a foil tent for more like 4 hours.   Still moist and tender, and very flavorful!   I gave 4 instead of 5 because my simmered corned beef was still much more tender.   Though - the simmered (in Guinness as well), did NOT have the delicious complexity of flavor that this recipe had.

I made this for out St Patty's Day feast.  It was delicious!  Even my super picky "wont eat anything but kid foods" 3 year old loved it and had 2nds!  I cooked it in the crockpot for around 11 hours and used 3 bottles of Guinness to cover the meat (save for the healthy swig I took - hey, I couldn't resist!).  I put some potatoes in with it and I will agree with others that they really REALLY soaked up the beer flavor.  Lucky for us, we LOVE the taste of Guinness around here (drink it quite often), so my husband and I devoured them.  I served this with fried cabbage and soda bread.  Yum!  It was even fantastic the next day on pumpernickel rye swirl bread with some spicy brown mustard, etc!  I'll make this every year for sure.  Thanks for the recipe!

I hate corned beef. My husband wanted some for St patty's day. The store must have been sold out of Guinness and Murphey's, so i just picked Honey Brown....using brown sugar, honey brown sounds good..I smothered brown sugar on, threw it in the crock pot, poured enough beer to cover it completely, and left for work. It smelled soooooo good, I couldn't wait to try it. Well, it was actually ok...I still hate corned beef, so I had to refer to my hubby for an honest review. He said it was good (wanted the leftovers), but said that it could be tweeked, he just wasn't sure how. I might still try it next year...I'll just have to get to the store sooner...small update, hubby made a sandwich with the leftovers the next day....couldn't stop talking about how "AWESOME" it was....we saved leftovers soaking in some of the "au jus", fyi

This was great. Next time I will add more Guiness (more than 2 bottles) since I had a pretty large piece of meat. I also added all spice, cloves, bay leaves and white peppercorns to the liquid (in addition to the packet that came with the meat). That was really good! I'll do veggies in a separate crock pot next time for 3 hours on high.

This was my first time making corned beef.  I did it in the crockpot with the sugar rub and three bottles of guinness and 2c of water to cover.  The sugar and guinness complimented each other and it was nicely flavored without a strong beer taste.  Even the kids devoured it!  I also added potatoes and onion the last two hours and it came out great!

This is really your standard corned beef recipe.  It was great, but even better when I added black peppercorns, bay leaves, garlic cloves and onions for flavor, in addition to the spice packet and Guiness.  You can't really go wrong with corned beef cooked in beer.  Although the addition of brown sugar was really a nice touch and something I hadn't tried before.  I will make this again with my additions.

Three words... Un freaking believable! I cooked it in a crock pot for 10 hours on low. It practically melts in your mouth. I will definitely make this over and over again.

Excellent.  I made this in my crock pot.  I used Harp instead of Guinness and cooked it on low for 7 hours.  So moist and tender.

I just tried a piece of this straight out of the crock pot....best corned beef ever! Growing up with a last name like Fitzpatrick, I have had my share of corned beef. A few minor changes. I used one Guinness and added enough beef broth to cover the beef. I also added the seasoning packet and just let it simmer for 8 hours on low. This is my new standard corned beef recipe. Fabulous!

I make this every year!  What I do is add a teaspoon of ground mustared to the brown sugar.  I then put the corned beef in one of those "turkey bags"  and draw the bag up so Guinness totally surrounds the meat.  I steam the vegetables in the microwave.

I did not care for this recipe. I did exactly as it said, and 3 hours later had to put the beef in a pot and boil it another hour.  Not sure how they came up with the timing on this as in the oven I'd think it would probably need another 4 hours at least!!

Can I say Oh my goodness!!! I was a little worried from doing anything diffrent than the usual boiled dinner, but my hubby said anything with beer in it must be good lol! I'm not a big fan of the beer flavor & thought I was going to ruin dinner....but it was AWESOME!!! Best corned beef recipe ever! I will from now on be using this & only this recipe! And it couldn't have gotten any easier either! I did mine in a crock pot & the only issue I had was that I should of added more liquid, either in water or beer cause my veggies were still a little harder than I like. But even still it was delicious!!!

Please note that you should LOVE Guinness or atleast like it if you want to enjoy this. It is just ok, but i personally would have enjoyed a more traditional water cooked corn beef for the flavor of Guinness is not one i cared for. If you expect it to just taste like something or other, dont, it will simply taste like a brisket that is flavored in Guinness. I shredded the beef and added mustard to mine and that killed some of the flavor but overall not a flavor i enjoyed.

I cooked the corned beef in a roasting pan and did it just the way the instructions say to and it came out AMAZING.  I was just cooking for two so I got a 2 1/2 lb brisket from the deli and I just wished I would have bought a bigger piece so I had more left overs. Reuben's, Corned beef hash. Mmmmm.  My only recommendation would be to put the cabbage and veggies in the sooner then the last hour.

This was pretty good. The first few bites were great, but then it started to taste a little bit too salty. I dont know if that is how corned beef usually as, as i have never had it before last night.

VERY, VERY GOOD!!! Thanks for a great recipe! I will always make my corned beef this way from now on. I cooked it in the slow cooker for 9 hrs., the last hour I turned it up on high, and added the cabbage wedges. I fixed Diane`s Colcannon & the Amazingly Easy Irish Soda Bread for the meal. EVERYONE LOVED IT!!!

Very good - but very sweet.  I followed another reviewers recipe and put in 6 red potatoes, 1/2 head of wedged cabbage and 4 carrots at the bottom of the crock pot w/ the beef on top.  Added 1 can of Guinness and 1 cup of water w/ 1 cup of brown sugar.  Next time I'll half the sugar --- too sweet for our taste.  As leftovers the next day, sliced the beef and put on Kaiser Rolls w/ packaged cole slaw mixed w/ Thousand Island dressing - SUPER TASTY!!!

This was very good. I couldn't find a "single" bottle of Guinness beer, and since no one in my family drinks beer, I had to find a different beer to use. I ended up using 18 oz of Heineken and I also added 1 cup of gingerale. I cooked the cabbage, potatoes, carrots and onions along with the corned beef all together in my crockpot for 9 1/2 hours and it was very tender and almost falling apart delicious. I would definitely make this again.

I'm so sorry I tried this instead of my regular beer-cooked corned beef. Baking the corn beef in the oven was the biggest mistake! It was so tough and dry my hubby is making me do another brisket using the slow cooked corn beef recipe for sandwich recipe I usually use. I talked to my butcher and he said you have to put the corned beef in liquid for it to get tender. Maby that is why so many people who did their's in a crockpot said it was delicious. I did mine exactly how it was shown in the recipe and it only rates 1 star (or zero stars if they would let me).

I made this yesterday, St. Patrick's Day.  It was amazing, over the top wonderful.  This is one of the best recipes I have ever encountered.  Today I went back to the grocery store to purchase another grey, flat cut corned beef for use at another time.  I will use the same recipe...over and over.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!

this was really good.  I will only make corned beef this way from now on.  Cooked in crockpot for 10 hours...perfect combination of flavor.  Loved it with a little honey mustard to dip in.  I cooked "southern fried cabbage" with this....yummy and easy

Really good for Saint Patrick's Day. I added 1/2 a cup of water to try and dilute the Guinness. Also, I added cabbage and carrots for the last hour. I cooked it in a crockpot for 9 hours on low.

I made this as the recipe directed - right to the letter.  It was one of the toughest pieces of corned beef we've ever had in 46 yrs of marriage.  I'm sure it would have been better, as one reviewer mentioned, to leave it in the oven for 6 hrs @ 300°.  (I should have read the reviews before I made it!) Our best corned beef always came for the crockpot or boiled so back to my older recipes.

My first corned beef - it was excellent! The only thing was that I used the slow cooker and I think I cooked the beef a little too fast as it came out a little tougher than I had hoped.  I didn't use the brown sugar; I used the seasoning that came with the brisket, some fresh ground black pepper, and 2 bay leaves.  I also added some vegetables during the last 1.5 hours of cooking, and those didn't finish either...so the beef came out great, but a little tough, and vegetables needed to go longer...still loved it! Can't wait for next time.

This is a true Irish recipe that my Mothers family (all from Ireland) have made for generations! I like to add 1 1/2 to 2 beers, because it makes an unbelievable gravy!

Just finished the best corn-beef sandwich...ever. I followed the recipe as written, except used the beer on hand;I think your favorite flavor of beer might have something to do with the over-all outcome. Taking hints from the many reviews, I baked the corn beef(4 lbs.) for 2 & 3/4 hrs., shut the oven off and removed the roast 30 minutes later. Once you put it in the oven, don't peak, or open the oven, or lift the lid to look. The juices render about a quart of stock...good starter for the vegetables to be boiled in. Thanks for the new 'favorite' recipe.

I also added the spice packets that came with the beef, but i thought it was way to strong and bitter! The meat had been submerged all day in a slow cooker, but it came out and it was rrrreally not what i wanted. Super tender but very disappointed with the taste. So sorry i "ruined" the 4 lbs of corned beef along with all the veggies. next time i'll just cook it the old fashioned way, with water! yummy.

So the tradional boil is really good, but this blows it out of the water, or beer, so to speak. My family loves this and make me do it now every year! This will be the 4th year. We still make the boiled but this has to be there!

Great flavor.  Added some extra garlic and cooked about 6 hours in a 200 oven.  Very moist and tender.  Cooked vegetables in a separate pot of water with a little added butter.  Easy, delicious meal.

I made this last St. Paddy's day. I made it in the slow cooker. When we got home from baseball practice, it was fragrant and we couldn't wait to dig in! I put the veggies underneath, put the flat brisket on top with the brown sugar, and poured on the Guinness. What a treat.

Very good!!!  We had already bought the point cut roast, so thats what we used.  Next time, will probably try a flat cut.  I think the sugar was a bit much...will cut that back next time.  I also think we could have cooked it longer...but it might have been the cut of meat...it was still a little tough...BUT, again it was very good.  With the changes, I think we will have a fantastic meal!!!   We also added come onions, carrots and potatoes, they were very yummy!!!!

I make this recipe severa times a year.   I usually have to cook 2 of them - they don't last very long in my house.  I cook it in a roaster oven set at about 375 for approx 4 hours, I add 1/2 to 1 onion sliced.  After about 3 hours I add a small bag of baby carrots.  It's the best recipe I have taken off this website!  I have neighbors and friends begging to come over for dinner.  This is amazing.

I've made this several times, always with great results. I prefer the slow cooker, on low for at least 6 hours, adding veggies and more beer after 4 1/2 hours.

Per reviewer's recommendations, I cooked this in a slow cooker.  I added carrots to the slow cooker and served the meal with Colcannon.  I wasn't a fan of how sweet the carrots turned out, but the meat was absolutely perfect!

I also did not have Guinness beer on hand so I used a bottle of whatever was in the fridge.  This turned out better than any corned beef I have ever made.  I do not like corned beef but I make it every year for my husband and kids who do like it.  This was so good that I went out and bought a second corned beef so we could have it again.  Just delicious!  A must-try dish!  Thanks!

I really liked the flavor of the meat. I used 2 bottles of the beer and put the meat right into it. I also cooked this for about 3-3 1/2 hours and added the cabbage after 2 hours. Next time I will use a smaller pan I think that will make the meat more tender.

Deeeelicious.  I did this in the slow cooker.  There were only two of us, so I only used 1 pound of corned beef, but I still used the whole bottle of beer (it was too early in the morning to just drink it).  I also added in some cabbage and potatoes to the pot about four hours in, and they were tender and delicious.  The corned beef definitely was a hit with my boyfriend, who looked longingly at the last bit of it and was thrilled when I told him that I was too full to eat it.

I also cooked this in a slow cooker. I rubbed the meat down with brown sugar, put it in the cooker and added to bottles of Guiness beer.  I flipped the meat after about 5 hours and added a little more brown sugar on the top of the meat.  It turned out great!!! The meat was so tender. My Husband really liked!!! Thanks for the recipe!

The best Corned Beef Recipe I have ever had with great reviews from my guests on St.Patricks Day. I did mine a little different than the Recipe and some of the reviews. First I took the Guiness beer or any other dark beer would work fine also,and put it in fat side down of the corned beef, in a Roasting pan w/o a rack and poured the beer over it and marinated it about 6 to 7 hours in the Fridge, this tenderizes the meat so it dosn't have to cook longer that the recipe requires. Put the Brownsugar over the corned beef with the rest of the marinating beer still sitting in the bottom of the pan w/o a rack and put another 1/2 can of beer in the pan so it wouldnt dry out the bottom of the pan while cooking. Put the lid on my roasting pan and cooked it for the normal time of 2 1/2 hours at 300 degrees. I did double the recipe and still it took the same amount of time to cook and it was tender. I did not add potatoes or carrots so if you do it might take a little longer to cook. It didn't have the boiled taste either the brown sugar gives it the carmelized taste that you get when making a baked ham very yummy!!

Stupendous. It was excellent. I used too big of a pan, however, and the Guinness caramelized at the bottom making it really hard to clean up :( Next time I'm going to try making it int he slow cooker and put the guinness right into it. I thought I wanted it to turn out on the drier side but this was a little too dry, so I think cooking it in the liquid will achieve what i am looking for!

I was skeptical, but it was St. Patty's Day, so I gave this a try...  Overall, I think it was a great dish.  I threw a 3lb flank into the slow cooker, rubbed it with 1/2 cup of brown sugar and the spices from the corned beef seasoning packet, poured a bottle of Guinness over the beef and cooked it on high for 6 hours.  I flipped the beef after 3 hours, and added a little water (about 1/2 cup).  Then in the last hour, I added in some diced potatoes, carrots, and placed some cabbage wedges on top of the beef (mostly out of the broth).  My husband and I thought this was really good - although I'm sure it helps to be big fans of Guinness!

I made this dish on St Pattys Day for my coworkers. They absolutely LOVED it(even a few who have never tried corned beef before!!) I had to make copies for most of them. I cooked 6lbs in the slow cooker for almost 11 hours!! I also used Sam Adams Boston Lager instead of Guiness. It was absolutely delicious!

Great recipe!  I threw everything in the crock pot and added carrots and cabbage in the last hour or two.  The carrots tasted great, but the cabbage would have tasted better just boiled in water. The corned beef was so tender and shredded easily.   My husband really liked it and he doesn't really care for corned beef. Will definitely be making it again!

Holy Schmoley was this good.  I did mine in the crockpot overnight, and I'm pretty sure that was why it fell apart so beautifully - the fat slid right off the meat leaving melt-in-your-mouth corned beef behind.  Everyone raved about it - the stout lends a really nice flavor to the meat.

Wow! This recipe is incredible, it has a wonderful flavor. I cooked the beef directly in the Guinness and brown sugar in a cast iron dutch oven. Put it on a gas burner on low at a steady simmer for 4 hours, added carrots and potatoes and cooked for another hour, then added cabbage and cooked for another 30 minutes. Both my husband and I absolutely loved it, and he doesn't like or drink beer. I, on the other hand, love Guinness to drink. This recipe tastes nothing like Guinness, it is hard to describe the flavor except to say that it is wonderfully yummy and the meat just falls apart when you take it out of the dutch oven. I didn't add any other seasonings except salt and pepper.

This was pretty good - a little tough, even though I used 'flat cut' corned beef instead of 'pointed cut', as another reviewer suggested. The taste was great and, like another reviewer, I served it with Irresistable Irsih Soda Bread and Fabulous Fried Cabbage. Happy St. Patty's Day!

Fantastic taste.  I did it in the slowcooker and it was so wonderful last night.  Can't wait for leftovers!

This was the best corned beef I've ever eaten!  My only problem was what to do with the extra bottles of beer.

I made this for St. Patrick's day.  It was really good and very easy.  I followed the recipe exactly.  During the last hour I added quartered cabbage, new potatoes,carrots and turnips.  Everything tasted great. My family said this is a keeper.  I will be making this again soon.

This was a very delicious way to make corned beef.  It was SO easy and requires virtually no maintenance.  I didn't bother with basting it or even flipping the meat over.  I just dumped it in a crock pot on low for 8.5 hours. I did add a bit more Guinness about halfway through. The meat came out very tender and the aroma was wonderful.  I would recommed this to anyone.

This corned beef had awesome flavor.  I made the traditional corned beef and this one and people raved over the guinness flavor.  My only complaint was that it was a tad on the salty side so next time I make it, i think I'll boil it a bit first to get some of the salt out.  Other than that it was delicious.  This will be my new go to recipe for corned beef.

Very good.  I put it in the slow cooker for a long slow cook and it was delicious!  I had both a tip cut and a flat cut in there and they were both great. Served it with "Irresistable Irish Soda Bread," "Fabulous Fried Cabbage" (both from this site), and roasted root veggies. Thanks!

Yummy! The only reason I gave this recipe a 4 is because I was a bit confused on whether or not I should use the seasoning packet included with the beef. Some reviews say to throw it in, others say don't. I put it in with the Guinness and I think it's better that way. More traditional flavor. Thanks!!

This is great!   I made it last year for St. Pats Day and everyone raved.  I followed the recipe, and served it with boiled red potatoes and Colcannon (Again an All Recipes recipe). It has been demanded by my family several times during the year, and obviously everyone is visiting this year and expect this meal.   I'm not Irish, I'm Welsh, but,       boy I do love this meal.   It doesn't hurt that I'm a big fan of Guinness stout.

Sorry, folks - I had high expectations for this recipe, but it just didn't measure up.  The corned beef ended up dry and stringy.  Guess I'll have to go back to the tried and true boiling method.

I was very pleased with this recipe. I did not use the Guinness beer, just used lite beer I had on hand. Came out delicious, the kids even loved it and asked for more "leprechaun" meat! I purchased the point cut brisket because it was on sale, trimmed the excess fat, and it came out tender and perfect. I also used the seasoning packet it came with. I will make again, thanks!

I am not a big fan of corned beef BUT I made this recipe for my recipe group and it was a hit!!!!

I put it a 4 1/2 pound brisket along with the ingredients in my slow cooker for about 7 hours on low.  After about 6 hours I added some sliced carrots.  It fell apart and was so moist and tasty.

Thank you for converting me to a corned beef lover.  ha!

This was the best brisket I have ever made!! I am now inspired to cook even more with Guinness. I sliced the brisket ahead of time, and then poured another can of Guinness in the warming dish to keep the meat warm.

I cooked this in the beer, rather than on a rack above the beer as stated in the recipe. I rubbed a little light brown sugar on the meat then mixed the remainder with the beer. The flat cut of corned beef is much better than the  point cut, which is too tough. The flat cut costs more but is not expensive. I used red corned beef, only because I couldn't find the gray. Gray is much better.

Wow.
Even my picky 14yr old loved this corned beef.
I rubbed the sugar on the beef poured in the guinness and put it in the crock pot on low for about 6 hrs. 
It turned out wonderfully!

Delicious!  So simple, but a better corned beef recipe I've yet to find.  As suggested in previous reviews, I omitted the rack and let the brisket sit in the yummy stout/brown sugar mixture.  I cooked it in a Dutch oven for 3 hours, adding cabbage and baby yukon golds during the last hour.  The meat was so tender and full of flavor.  This will get made again for sure.

Too dry and not very tender.  If you want corned beef cooked in beer I use the Corned Beef for Sandwich recipe.  Its the best we ever tasted.

It was my first time making corned beef.  I just wasn't impressed with this recipe.  Even after cooking it for 8 hours on high in the crock pot, it was still pretty tough, and the flavor was lacking.  Will make again, but using a different recipe.

Wow!  This turned out great!  I added quartered potatoes, carrots, and pieces of cabbage to the roast.  The beer simmered down and mixed with the brown sugar to make a nice glaze over the meat and veggies.  I made this for a Saint Patricks day party and it was such a hit!

I made this as a whim.  We had a corned Beef and this recipe looked interesting.  It was the best whim I've tried in a long time.  It was absolutely wonderful.  And we've continued to make it regularly.  Even our families really enjoy it.

AMAZING is the only word that describes how good this recipe is!  My husband was a bit skeptical because he is not a Guiness fan and he ate about half of the roast!  The only suggestion I have (and this has nothing to do with the recipe really) is that I used a very lean cut of corned beef.  You don't need the extra fat because the Guiness and slow cooking makes it incredibly moist!!  Thanks so much for this recipe!  I made it for St Patty's Day but after looking through my recipes I think I am going to make it this weekend!!!

Yum!!!  The best corned beef i have had!  It's awesome with the Irish soda bread recipe by Ellen that's on this site.  Cooked it in the slow cooker, used Guinness, and turned out amazing.  My hubby is Irish and couldn't get over how good it was!  Thanks for a good recipe!!!  Will definately be cooking my corned beef like this from now on!

This was so moist and tasty! A big hit on St. Patrick's day! It was better than the traditional corned beef. I baked this one in the oven, and cooked the traditional one in the crock pot.

my husband was extremely skeptical about this one...we're both irish/grerman...we had a corned beef cook-off and he's still raving about this one. i steamed the veggies some before adding to the roasting pan for the last 45 minutes, worried the beer might over-power them, didn't use a rack and added the spice pack, chose a pan that allowed the beer to come halfway up the sides of the meat, turned it once....major shrinkage. get a really good cut of meat for this one...i had to get what i could out here in the boonies. definitely do this one again...excellent sammies w/ lotsa hot mustard on pumpernickle

I made this last year and am making it for St. Patrick's Day this year.  It was incredible!!  I used the crock pot and then cooked the cabbage in the juice.  This year I will add potatoes.  Can't wait!!

This was just "eh" with us. Simmer corned beef long enough and it'll be tendet. I made this in my crock pot (1.75lbs @ 10 hrs on low) and it was falling apart. I think the sweetness with the Guiness was a little too odd. Might just use the Guiness next time.

A waste of a corned beef.  Never did get tender, although I cooked it longer than recipe stated.  Today I'm putting it all in the Crockpot, and I'm sure it will result in a big improvement!

I found this recipe last year on here and made it for both my family and a work potluck.  At home, there was none of the usual left overs. My youngest even ate the cooked carrots, which he never does.  At work, my corned beef was gone long before the other person's corned beef and everyone was asking for the recipe.

I didn't much like this.  The meat was fine but the gravy was thin and not very nice.  I will make this again because I like brisket but I'll add some dijon mustard, some herbs (thyme), garlic, worcestershire sauce and perhaps a little tomato paste.  I served it with Yorkshire puddings and colcannon.  If the gravy had been more flavorsome it would have been a good Sunday dinner.

This had a great flavor, but I only gave it 4 stars because it came out with a "boiled" texture. When I make it again, I will take it out for the last 1/2 hour and bake it on a baking sheet with a glaze of brown sugar and horseradish. I put vegetables in with it, and they were GREAT!

This was DELICIOUS! The flavor is incredible. I had A LOT of corned beef dinners growing up and this one was the best. My meat was tough, and that was totally MY fault. I didnt cover it completely and next time will allow for a little extra time just to be safe. I added baby red potatoes and carrots to the pan for the last hour, and boiled cabbage on the side. Use the pan juices for your veggies, you wont be disappointed!

REALLY yummy.  Don't cheap out on the Guiness and use light beer instead.  The dark gives it a wonderful hearty flavor.

My first time making corned beef, but I liked it better than others that I have eaten.  The meat was done a little earlier than I needed it, so I put it aside and steamed the vegetables over the leftover beer (with a little water added).  The liquid was salty, but a little dribble made a nice seasoning for the cabbage and potatoes.

Pretty good, easy.  Get a high quality, brand name brisket. I didn't use the rack, but I did use the spice packet that was included. Remove the fat after cooking, allow to cool and eat cold the next day.

Cooking the corn beef in the bear will keep it tender and will reduce the cooking time.  I would suggest that the cabbage and potatoes are cooked seperate and the beer juice be set aside and reduce or thickend to be added at the table.  Very good and will make again

Made this last night -- I think it requires a bit more cooking time than suggested -- next time I'd try bring everything to a boil on top of the stove before putting it in for a "headstart".  Didn't use a rack and put veggies in in stages as it cooked.  Added a bit of red wine vinegar to offset the sweetness folks had mentioned.  Would make it again, and allow for more cooking time.  Thanks for sharing!

i tried this recipe previously and everyone loved it.  This time, I am on the South Beach diet and decided to forgo the sugar; just put the meat on a rack, beer in the bottom. Cooked for about 2 hours, then added veggies--cabbage, parsnips, turnips, cabbage to the bottom of the pan. Everything was great.  Wonder if the folks that had tough meat know how to slice corned beef, thin and on the grain? Can't see how this could be tough.

I tried this just for ST. Patty's day, and it was FANTASTIC!  I've never made corned beef, and so I followed the previous reviews, I didn't place it on a rack, but directly into the beer, I also put in the spice pack that came with the beef.  I added cut up potatoes, onions and whole baby carrots the last hour (3 hours total) and it was great.  Thanks to all who helped give tips on how to make it great!

There were things I liked and didn't like about this dish. I enjoyed the nice beery taste - what a great spin on corned beef! But I didn't use the spice packet that came along with the corned beef, and I really missed that distinctive corned beef spice flavor. The recipe didn't say whether or not to use the spice packet - next time I will try using it. Also, not sure if I cooked it too long (this was my first try at corned beef), but it can out rather tough.

My family just tried this at our friends home last night, I had to get the recipe so we could make it for St. Patricks day.  Has an excellent flavor, my family highly recommends.

My husband and I did not enjoy this recipe. I did use a Coors Light  rather than Irish stout beer so that might have had something to do with it, but I don't think that could be the whole reason. The corned beef was VERY tough. I will probably just stick to the regular way of fixing corned beef from now on.

Way too bitter. Guess I should have expected it from the Guiness, but for some reason I thought the sugar would help that.

I only cooked my corned beef for 2 hours and it was incredibly tough (and I used a very popular name brand that I've never had problems with before).  The pan juices made a delicious gravy, though.  I would suggest that people test their corned beef for doneness after 1 1/2 hours.

My husband and I discovered this recipe and decided to try one the "traditional" way and one like this since we both love Guinness.  I am on my way to the store to buy two more corned beef while they are on sale!  Our friends loved it and so did we. It was even more tender than the one I cooked on top of the stove.  This is a permanent addition in my book.  Corned beef, it's not just for St. Patrick's Day anymore!  *smile*

I made this yesterday for St. Patrick's Day and it was so yummy.  I had never made corned beef before, so I was a little worried.  But it turned out perfect and couldn't have been easier.  And the aroma is fantastic!  Thanks Diana!

I tried this early to make sure it was a winner.
Everyone loved it including the kids!  The alcohol cooks out and the sugar keeps it from tasting bitter.  We served it with a mixture of sour cream and grainy mustard on the side.  Also I liked the fact that it is baked instead of boiled.  Less fatty tasting!

I only put 1 star because site wouldn’t accept my review without it??
Hubby prefers Guinness to any other beer, & requested I make this.   A big  overall disappointment.  No matter how carefully I pour beer the brown sugar ran off so   I put on more brown sugar.  Meat didn’t seemed to be getting done at 4 hrs,   At 5&1/2 hours added small chopped veggies, 90 mins later veggies barely cooked    
Another hour later took slightly cooked veggies out and cooked on stove top.   So 8 plus hours cooking left Guinness taste mostly in cabbage.  Meat never got tender.

I used all (2 cans) Guinness Draught Stout but don't be confused with the Extra Stout...or boiling the beef...both toughens the beef  I stock up on Wegmans Flat Cut Corned Beef because all the fat is already cut off so it's very lean. I also cut small slits all over the meat on both sides. Then put it in a Crock Pot with 3 stalks of celery first to keep the meat off the bottom. I put on High for 1 hour to get up to temp a little faster, then on low for the other 9 hours. I added about 2 T pickling spice with 1T Trader Joes 21 spice to cut the sweetness from the (1/2 c) brown sugar since my husband doesn't like sweet dinner meals. I roast the veggies then add them to the crock pot while the meat in resting so they absorb some of the flavor. I also added Napa Cabbage this time and it turned out wonderful. We LOOOOVE to heat the  Safeway Grocery Store Soda Bread and spread with butter. The bread goes perfectly with the meal. Cooking one right now and it smells sooo good. To go one step farther to have a true and complete Irish meal...in a fluted glass, add 50/50 Guinness and Champaign or sparkling white wine (We also add about 1-2 splashes of Hiriam Walker Cream De Cassis and a Brandy soaked cherry to top it off.) Some call the drink Black Velvet. We call it OUTSTANDING...YUM!

I made this recipe exactly as written, except that I used the seasoning packet that came with the corned beef, and roasted it about 4 hours.  The pan I used exactly fit the corned beef, so the bottle of Guinness almost completely covered the corned beef.  I flipped the meat a few times during baking. We really enjoyed this recipe, but next time I make it, I will use half the amount of brown sugar, or less.  It was too sweet for both of us.  About 45 minutes before serving, I added chunks of potato, carrots, onion & celery to the pan.  Cabbage had to be steamed separately, as there was no room in the pan.  Also, I followed another reviewer's advice, and made gravy from the juices/beer in the pan.  That was a big hit, too!  Thanks for the recipe.

Very tasty and tender, the meat fell apart and had a wonderful sweet, stout flavor from the brown sugar and Guinness beer.  I added about 1 cup of water at the 6 hour mark and another at about 7 hours along with the cabbage, potatoes, carrots, onion, and garlic to keep the meat stewing while it cooked.  At 8 hours in a crockpot on Hi it was wonderful.  Will be making this dish more often.

I was very worried after reading reviews that the meat wouldn’t be tender. I made it in oven according to recipe. It was delicious. Added carrots at the beginning but didn’t like the tastel. Used 2 cans of draught Guinness. Cooked potatoes separately and added cabbage after I removed the meat. Wonderful.

I ADORE this recipe and will never make corned beef any other way again. The flavor is supreme and the slow cooking in the beer made the meat incredibly tender. The only slight change I made was that I used about half the brown sugar called for and rubbed it right in to the meat. It is so amazingly delicious I have to say my family is PLEASED.

Amazing !!! I will NEVER EVER boil brisket again.  I used my cast iron dutch oven , i rinsed and dryed and trimed the fat, then the only addition was i added quite a bit of fine ground black pepper to the brown sugar,  that is the only change, put it in the dutch over poured the bottle of guiness over and around it and put it in the oven at 275 so i could get other things done and let it cook longer ,  four hours to be exact, it was beyond tender and amazing in flavor this is definitely the way to go with this meat. I think the oven is the way to cook this as a slow cooker tends to change the texture of the meat.

Not familiar with corned beef so did not know what to expect nor have a basis of comparison. Spouse liked the way the marinade (e.g. beer + brown sugar) made the roast potatoes and carrots taste. I felt the meat tasted a tad dry, but maybe this is the way corned beef texture naturally is?!

I agree, this recipe was excellent. I did follow the suggestion to rinse the roast (mine already had the packet of spices blended in) and rub stone ground mustard on before coating the corned beef with brown sugar.  I baked a 4 1/2 pound roast in a 13 X 9 pan with one can of beer and it was tender and delicious!  I baked it for 4 1/2 hours on 300 degrees.  I did cook the vegetables separate because there was not room in the pan for them but next time I am putting the vegetables in with the broth, increase the pan size and add more beer.

Roasting pan: Easy and fantastic.
Dutch oven: 3 stars. Didn't like it sitting in the beer as much as steaming in the juices.

As written we feel it is about 3 stars. With changes, we fell in love with it. Make sure to use draught NOT stout as stout is bitter. We also only use 1/4 cup brown sugar. Dash of allspice and then we let it simmer. The liquid I pour from the crock after and thicken for a gravy that is simply amazing.

This recipe is amazing. I agree with other reviewers that you absolutely have to cover the beef with the beer. I’ve made this recipe three times now. Two times I did not add the pack of pickling spices and once I did. I honestly preferred it without the pickling spice pack...I felt it made it too salty even after rinsing the corned beef. To each their own though! If you want to add it, go for it! The best thing about this recipe is that it is super easy. Takes but 5 minutes to put together. Then just sit back and relax and drink some of the other Guinness while you wait!

I used a Sam smith oatmeal stout and slowcooked it for about 9 hours in the crock pot. Added a head of red cabbage and carrots and onions a couple hours before it was done. Delicious!

Fabulous!  I cooked it in my Instant Pot on slow cook.  It was so tender and so very flavorful. I froze half of the brisket in the juice and defrosted it just last night.  Again, so good!  I'll cut back on the brown sugar next time, just to be a good girl.  No more boring corned beef and cabbage for us!

Best corned beef ever! I have used this recipe multiple times with minor modifications. I use the slow cooker and more meat with the seasoning packets. The meat is soooo tender and the entire family loves it. Still only use one bottle of beer - it covers all the  meat. Added bonus is that the house smells wonderful while the meat cooks!! Thanks for such a great recipe!

Used a local craft beer similar to Guinness  (at 16% alch.)  Made no difference the alcoholburns off and the sweet grains left added to the flavor. I trimmed the flat of all fat I could get to and it still just melted in the mouth. One hour in the pressure cooker was all it took.

My son absolutely loved this recipe -- and SO easy!  I did overcook it a little, but it's a hard recipe to kill.  It has a lot of yummy liquid (who would not love beer-soaked brisket?), so it reheats very well.

We made two corn beef & cabbage dinners for St. Patrick's Day, the crock pot version was voted the best by 6 out of 6 guests.  This one, although they liked the flavor, said the meat was just too tough.  My husband is making tuna fish rather than take a corn beef sandwich, because of the toughness.  I will try this recipe again, but in crock pot.  I did not change recipe.

Made for get together with friends, some said it was the best corned beef they ever had.  I did use the packet of seasoning with the brown sugar, and cooked in crockpot.  To cover meat had to use 2 bottles of Guinness and added bit of water.   Only bad thing is that it was so good there were no leftovers...

I make my own corned venison and used this recipe for St. Patrick's day and it got rave reviews.  I had done 2 roasts and needed more.  I used the brown sugar as indicated, but had to use 2 bottles of Guinness to be sure to cover the roasts.  But the ratio was still good.  Gave the corned venison a nice rich flavor.  Would do this again in a heartbeat.  May do this more often than just water.

I did the 9-hour slow cooker method. Half way through I dipped out a lot of the juice, boiled it down some, froze it to separate and remove the grease, then simmered it until thick. 
It made an amazing glaze over the meat and added so much more flavor than the meat had on its own!!
This will probably always be my base recipe for Corned Beef!

AWESOME!!!  This will be my forever go to recipe for corned beef.  I made just as the recipe said, except to bring the liquid level up to meet the top of the meat and fat layer, I added a little water, a carrot and a piece of onion.  Just perfect flavor of sweet and stout and corned.  Served the  cooking liquid with the meal.  What a hit.  Had to make another brisket the next day for sandwiches!!

Slow roasting was a great alternative to all-day crock-pot.  I had a larger roast and used 2 bottles of Stout beer.  The meat had a nice "crust" - not dry but gave it a much more appealing look and firmness that essentially "boiling it all day" did not provide.  I cooked the cabbage and other veggies, with spice mix and other spices per the All-Recipies  "Easy Corned Beef" recipe.  I used beer and would try it next time with water as the look of stout-brown cabbage wasn't so great.  Enjoy!

HORRIBLE!!  I had another couple for for St. Patrick's Day and I had to call them this morning to apologize for such a horrible meal.  I think the main issue is the timing is way off.  The meat was under cooked & tough and the vegetables were not even the consistency of par-boiled. This should cook in the oven way more than 2 1/2 hours and vegetables need more than an hour to cook.

I had never made corned beef before, I found this recipe and followed it to the letter.  The corned beef turned out wonderful.  The whole family loved it, even my picky eater.  I don't use any other recipe now.

I used 4 lb flat cut, and at my butcher, the corn beef was pre-seasoned.  I put it in a crock pot, and poured two bottles of  Guiness Stout over the top, after rubbing the brown sugar all over.  I made sure all the meat was submerged.  I set a timer for every hour and then would flip the slab.  After 6 hours of this, I added an onion (cut in quarters), 6 new potatoes (halved) and 6 sliced carrots.  After 3 more hours, I turned off the crock pot and went to bed.  I turned it on for 3 more hours in the morning, and when the meat slid off the fork when I tried to flip it, I called it done.  DELICIOUS!

My favorite way to cook corned beef now!  So much nicer than the crock pot!!!  What's best  about this method is you get slices, as opposed to shredded.....  I have  made this several times and forgot the sugar once, no biggy...  Have also cooked longer than the called for timing to get the tenderness I was looking for.  This one is easy peasy outstanding!

03-17-16 ~ My favorite meal of the year is St. Patrick's Day meal.  This recipe didn't disappoint!  I was afraid the brown sugar/beer mixture would make the meat to sweet - it didn't.  It was delicious.  Served this with 'Easy Irish Colcannon' and 'Basic Irish Soda Bread' both from AR.

Turned out perfect! I tenderized the brisket by piercing it several times on both side with a fork, placed it fat side up in the roasting pan. rubbed the season packet on top, and let it marinade in the beer overnight. Followed the cooking instructions and after 4 hours I removed the fat and drained and reserved the drippings to use in boiling the potatoes and carrots. I then placed the brisket under the broiler, center rack,  for 5-10 minutes per side to caramelize. It was tender and juicy! Everyone had seconds and wanted more and it was gone so fast I didn't even have time to take a picture! Thanks for sharing!

I used 2 bottles of Miller Lite, & no water. Guiness is to strong of a taste for my family.  I cooked this exactly as the recipe says for 2 hours. Then I removed the rack,& turned the Beef over. Cooked for 1 more hour at 300 degrees. Added Carrots,& Potatoes,& cooked for 1 Hour at 350 degrees.Removed Beef & kept in 13- by- 9 pan covered in foil on bottom of oven to keep hot.Added Cabbage to pot,& cooked for 45 minutes.  I never got such rave reviews from my family. The best Corned Beef they ever had. I am not a big fan of Corned Beef , but I made a sandwich of some of the leftovers an hour later. It is delicious.

I made this in the crock pot totally covered with Guinness. Cooked it 7 hours on low. I cooked 2 roasts together at a total of 5.5 lbs. One piece was great but the other was tough. 't know what happened. I rotated the pieces for even cooking. Disappointing

I didn't use Guiness, but used a 40-oz. can of Miller or Bud (don't remember) which I bought in the grocery store so it was only 3.2 beer. Otherwise I followed the ingredients to a T. I cooked a 2-1/2 pound flat cut in my crock pot on low for 7 hours and it was wonderful! Today I bought a 4 pound flat cut and will again use 3.2 beer and cook it for about 8-9 hours on low. Highly recommend this recipe!

This is a very good recipe for corned beef. It should be noted to those who have reviewed, it was not meant for the crock-pot. It cooks differently. You will get an enhanced flavor if you follow the directions. I typically do my veggies stove top, as to not disturb the brisket. Well done Shameless.

Biggest problem is oven cooking time was waaaaay off (which I accounted for so we didn't eat too late). 2.55 lbs of meat was in for a total of 4 hours (not 2 & 1/2) and potatoes and carrots were still crunchy after 2+ hours. I will definitely use a crock pot next and let it simmer all day. Guiness/brown sugar along with spice packet added a nice sweet flavor to the salty meat. Overall, not a bad first try but there's a lot I'll do different next time.

This recipe is great. Instead of putting the corned beef on a rack, I slice 2 vidella onions & put in the bottom of a castiron dutch oven. Rub the roast with the brown sugar & pour whatever beer I have on hand around the roast. cover & cook as the recipe says, until tender. Sometimes it takes longer than 2 1/2 hours, but well worth the wait. Thanks for sharing.

I covered completely with Guinness and water and added the seasoning packet and cooked for 8 hours on low in a crock pot.

Wonderful! I usually make this in a crock pot, but it creates such a nice toasty surface this way. I sautee some cabbage in the drippings and dress with black pepper. I also add some ground mustard and garlic powder to the brown sugar which really makes it per my family. Wow!

Maybe I was expecting too much. . .  The recipe was good, but nothing special.  If I hadn't poured the Guinness on the corned beef myself I would have never known it was cooked in anything other than water.  The sweetness of the brown sugar was there but nothing else.  Think I'll stick to my original recipe.

I used 1 bottle of beer, 1 can of beef broth, and enough water to cover the meat.  I also only used 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and it was plenty.  I cooked it in thecrock pot on low for about 4 1/2 hours.  It was perfect.  I made reuben sandwiches and it was a hit.  Will definitely keep as my go to recipe for St.Patrick's day.  Next time I want to make the Reuben casserole recipe from this site.

Made this today for saint pattys day. My dad who is irish aways did the boiled corned beef, so i decided to try something different.  This was tender flavorful and so delish. I normally hate cabbage but this makes cabbage more appealing. My 15 month old loved this. I did cook it for longer to make sure the alcohol cooked out. Will make this more often, i did use another beer cause i didnt have guiness but will use guiness next time. Thanks for a delish  recipe

Amazing.  The longer you cook it the better it is.  Do use the spice packet, and add extra allspice berries, whole cloves, and garlic.

As corned beef recipes go, this one is better than most, but the Guinness leaves a bitter aftertaste. I'm not a huge corned beef or Guinness fan, though.  My husband is a fan of both, and he loved this.  So I'll be making it once a year.

My entire family are corned beef fanatics, but found this one just okay. We don't drink beer and the Guinness was just too overpowering. I was looking for a way other than boiling to make corned beef and found two other recipes that we may like. This one, however, will be removed from my recipe box.

We LOVED it!

We put it in the crock pot on low for 7 hours and didn't use a seasoning packet....just Guinness and brown sugar.  It was amazing!!!

The corn beef was tender and moist. I added a few of my own seasonings to bring out a litte more flavor. Overall everyone loved it.

Hands down the best corned beef I've ever had, much less made. I did need 2 bottles of Guiness to cover the brisket, and I cooked it on low in the Crock-Pot for about 10-11 hours. Perfect!

Loved it!  I will say that it was a tad sweet for our preference, but that's personal preference.  We also did add another beer so that it just covered the meat.  PERFECT for Reubens too!  And we thought the serving ratio was a bit high.  I would plan on 1/2lb. per person because corned beef shrinks down quite a bit.  We did a 3lb. cut and it was just enough for 4 of us to eat for dinner (with potatoes, carrots, cabbage and bread) and 2 Reubens the next day.

I don't like Guinness but I loved it in this recipe...get the biggest corned beef you can as it goes fast ! I followed the recipe exactly and cooked it all day in my cast iron dutch oven at the 300. I did turn it every 2 hours and removed it after 5 hours to cook the vegetables. The vegetables were awesome cooked in this broth ! I saved the broth so I can cook more vegetables today. I used a large bottle of Guinness so I had several cups left over. I cooked carrots, turnip, cabbage, potatoes, onions, and parsnips. All were delicious !!

This recipe just turned out to be an okay recipe.  The beef never turned out as good as I had hoped, it was very salty and tough even though I cooked it for 3.5 hours.  I usually cook my corned beef in water with potatoes, carrots and cabbage and I will go back doing that.  I thought this was a waste of good Guinness beer.

This sounds interesting with the Guiness but in the  end it is just a boiled corned beef using beer instead of water. When it is covered it in the oven as the recipe says, the meat just simmers away in the big puddle of beer which doesn't really add much to it. As far as the brown sugar goes, it all dissolves away within minutes so what is the point?  It was OK but not worth the trouble over just simmering the beef on the stove top in water. It comes out like a big slab of boiled beef. The only way to give it any character is to, after it is done, coat it with a brown sugar/mustard mixture and roast it it in the oven at 350F for 10-15 minutes. It will come out with a nice sweet crust, like a baked ham.

I might now cook Corned Beef more than once a year.  Followed the recipe exactly. I didn't know what to expect and was very suprised at how flavorful and delicious it was.  A bit a spicy mustard was perfect on my plate.

I like the way the meat came out with this recipe. I thought the veggies came out a little bland for my tastes.  I will cook the meat this way again, it was pretty tender and really easy to make.

EXCELLENT! The kids loved it! Don't put the veggies in the crock pot, just boil them a few minutes. Also put a toothpick in the cabbage to keep it from falling apart in the bolling water.

Great!  Put 2 briskets in the slow cooker, each with about a cup of brown sugar rubbed on.  Filled with 2 bottles guinness with a bag of baby carrots.  Added about 10 new potatoes (quartered) with 2 hours to go.  Boiled the cabbage separately.  Outstanding!

I did not care for the sweet beer flavor- it would be best with one or the other. I cooked this on high for 3 hours and low for 4 hours, but only the bottom portion was fork tender- even after using two cans of beer to be sure it was covered. I also added the vegetables an hour before we were planning to eat as recommended and they were not done. I had to simmer them in a pot just before dinner. I would recommend that this be cooked a lot longer- probably 9-10 hours if possible (I also did 4 pounds like the recipe called for not 1 or 2 like most reviewers). My husband doesn't like corned beef and thought this was pretty good- especially the vegetables. I could be skewed though- I am pregnant and my taste-buds are a little awry.

A keeper. Used 1/2 cup brown sugar mixed with the spice packet and placed the corned beef in a casserole snug enough so a 12oz bottle of Guinness Extra Stout covered almost 2/3 of the contents. I made sure the lid fitted tightly.  Three hours on 300 degrees and it was perfect!  I then thickened the sauce and served along side the corned beef.  Great with Fabulous Friend Cabbage and new potatoes.

My Irish husband, who is also the better cook of the two of us, raved and ravished this dish.  Only problem was I didn't make enough. I made it in a very large slow cooker and will add more vegetables and potatoes and another bottle of stout to ensure everything is covered. What a great and incredibly easy recipe guaranteed to succeed!

This is a really great recipe! I first tried this out for St. PAtrick's Day. I use a point cut of corned beef and trim as much fat as possible before placing it in the crockpot. This helps to make it less greasy. My husband loved it!  He's a bit of a picky eater and he's asked me to make it several times since March.  This recipe has found a permanent place in my collection.

Good stuff. Not only my first time making corned beef, but first time eating it! I placed the meat in the beef as some ofers suggested and it came out super moist. May try again with my husbands favorite beer shimay since it is heavy like guinness.

This was excellent - I don't think I will make it any other way again.  Used about 1/4 of the sugar. Put the carrots in as a base for the corned beef, and cooked on low for about 6 hours, then added big chunks of potatoes.  Added the cabbage quarters after another hour, and they did not take long to cook.  I am not a fan of Guiness, but I did not really taste it, even in the veggies.  Great recipe!

This was very good. I followed the directions but I reduced the amount of meat to 1 1/2 pounds. I added a clove of garlic and a bay leave to the Guiness. I cooked the meat in the beer and turned it in the oven every hour. I also agree with other commenters that the fat should stay on and the amount of time cooking needs to be increased. I cooked mine for 6 hours but it could have cooked longer. My boyfriend loved it and preferred it over the boiled kind. As did I!

The flavor is wonderful, but I think next time I'll do this all day in a crockpot.  I highly recommend cooking the beef IN the beer.  I used an Irish stout.  I cooked this in the oven for 3.5 hours and it was still a bit tough.

I intended to make this for St. Patrick's day, but my grocery store was out of brisket.  I decided to try this same recipe with a chuck roast and it turned out unbelievably tender!  A wonderful flavour and the meat was just falling apart.  Served with Diane's Colcannon (from this site) and soda bread, it was a hearty and cozy meal.  I'll definitely be making this again.

Yum. I added carrots, onions, and red potatoes, which were delicious. My husband asked if I could make carrots soaked in Guiness every time. I used a 2 lb corned beef round (no seasoning packet).

I made 2 changes - put it in the slow cooker and cut the recipe in half.  Slow cooker, good; half recipe, bad.  This was so good I was very disappointed I didn't have leftovers. I'll not make that mistake again!

So good! The sweetness of the beer and brown sugar really balance out the saltiness of the corned beef. Per other reviews, I put 4 lb. brisket in crock pot w/ can of Guinness and 1/2 can of water--I used seasoning packet.  cooked on low for 8-10 hours.  I roasted my cabbage,potatoes,onions and carrots in oven.

Oh My Goodness!  This was the most tasty corned beef I have had in a long time!  I highly recommend it.  I would not put the veggies in the same pot because they come out a little bitter for my taste, but the beef is WONDERFUL!

I baked this in the oven (300 degrees), covered, for about 6 hours, adding potatos, carrots onion and cabbage for the last 1 1/2 hrs.  One bottle stout was sufficient.  It was so tender and very tasty!  Even the MIL loved it.  Be sure to use a flat cut (less fat).  I used brown sugar, but only about 1/2 cup.    It does not serve 16!  Maybe 8, especially if you have teenagers.

I made this last St. Patrick's day. While it was good, it just didn't satisfy my St. Pat's CB fix. It's likely that I will make it again, but will have another standard CB brisket to go with it. Thanks for the interesting variation!

This dish tasted okay and the meat was tender, but didn't actually taste like corned beef and it was a lot of extra work. We ate a lot of corned beef growing up and I serve it often to my family and this dish was lacking that traditional flavor. My husband and kids all agreed they wanted the corned beef made "the regular way" from now on.

Very easy to make.  I don't like that kind of beer to drink.  We will be making this again.  I added spuds and carrots the last hour of cooking and they tasted great also.

Awesome recipe! The hubby loves this one and has a tendency to request it. I personally don't change any of the ingredients, I just pop the beef into the crock pot for as long as possible (up to 18 hrs. on low) and it is sooooo tender. Easy and good! Can't get better than that!!

This was good. I made it for a St. Patrick's Day dinner and really enjoyed it. I shredded the corned beef and served it on crusty rolls with horseradish and cabbage. Everyone absolutely loved it. I had never had corned beef before, and I will make it again! :)

Oh my goodness this was TENDER!! I cooked an Irish dinner for St. Patty's Day, complete with          sculpted red potatoes! This corned beef was out of this world!! I served a family of 9 and each one of them thought it was awesome! Even my kids, 15 and twins that are 12 asked me to make this more often!

Thanks so much for sharing!!

This is by far the best corned beef with cabbage recipe we have ever tried.  Most recipes call for boiling the beef with the veggies and we really liked the roasted corned beef with the savory/sweet gravy provided by the Guinness cooking liquid.  I put the veggies in the last hour of roasting and it makes a scrumptious meal.

You do have to change the recipe around a bit. First I would rub the top of the brisket with coarse mustard and add only a couple of tbsp. of the brown sugar. Also add the packet of seasoning that comes with the brisket. I would drop the beef right into the beer, and add 2-3 garlic cloves (if you like garlic). I even added a can of beef broth. Cover the meat while it cooks. Also the cooking time needs to be doubled.

Delicious...I didn't use the included seasoning packet that comes with the corned beef...it would have given too strong of a flavor.  But I added cabbage in the last hour of cooking time and the flavor of the Guinness really soaked up in the cabbage! So Good!!

The slow cooker is a must for this recipe! Cooked on high for approx. 5 1/2 hours.  I highly recommend adding some cabbage and carrots to the pot during the last hour of cooking.  Yum!

Very good and easy.  I followed the recipe and then cooked for 4 hours and it turned out perfect.  I boiled cabbage, potatoes and carrots separately in salted water for about 30 minutes.

I used others advice, and made this in the slow cooker.  Due to hubby's pickiness, had to omit the sugar, added garlic and peppercorns, cooked on high for 6 hours.  It was very tender and yummy.  I will use the flat cut next time, point cut was kind of fatty.

I usually can tollerate corned beef once a year and enjoy it.  I made this for my husband and step daughter and they LOVED it.  It was by far the best I have ever eaten.  We might actually make it more often because it was so good.  We served it with Colcannon and Soda Bread.  Incredible dinner!

This was my first attempt at corned beef and I have hit the motherload with this one. I took the advice about cooking it in the crock pot on low for 9 hours and it came out so moist, tender, it completely melted in your mouth. I included the spice packet that came with the brisket and the flavor was fantastic. This couldn't have been easier. I also made "Diane's Colcannon" and it was AWESOME!!!!!I had rave reviews from "corned beef connoisseurs" so I will be using this recipe every St. Patrick's Day! Thank You!

This recipe worked too well for me.  It was polished off in 1 meal.  

I used a sale priced, inexpensive point cut... Substituted our regular brand of beer for Guinness...Put in the spice packet...Used a crockpot. The corned beef was tender and tasty.

Oh so good!!  Made this for St. Patrick's day dinner yesterday and it was absolutely marvelous!  I cooked it in a 7.5 qt covered cast iron dutch oven at 300 F for 2.5 hrs and it was perfect -- tender and delicious.  Did not use a rack, just placed the meat in the pot and cooked it directly in the Guinness beer (14.9 oz can).   In addition to the brown sugar I also added the spices which were included in the package with the corned beef.   Served the beef with "Diane's Colcannon" and "Irish Cream Bundt Cake" for dessert.  Both were scrumptious.. My family loved everything and said it was the best Irish dinner ever.  This corned beef recipe is a keeper and is going in our favorite recipes book.

Made this for St. Patrick's Day and it was sooooooo good. I used a 3 lb. roast and cooked it in the crock pot all day. Turned it up to high for the last hour and a half after I added potatoes and carrots. I cannot even describe the flavor, but it was so rich and yummy. I plan to use this recipe for many years to come!

Not a fan of Guinness, so I used Harp Lager (made by Guinness, but a little lighter), added a boullion cube, and let it simmer away in my crockpot on Low. Honestly, I couldn't stand the smell most of the time..it just smelled like beer. I was worried. But after about 9hrs or so I  pulled it out and it was AMAZING. So tender and flavorful.. THANKS so much!

I made this yesterday for St Patty's Day. I am really a Reuben Sandwich person, but thought I would try this for my Irish husband. He just loved it. I put it in my slower cooker thought I would put it on high for a few minutes, three and a half hours later. I was thinking this will really be tough. I did remembered someone saying to cook it longer, so I turned it to low and cooked another two hours. It was wonderful.

This was, by far, the best corned beef I have ever made. I forgot to put it in the crockpot before leaving for work, so I cooked by 2lb. brisket in the toaster oven for 3 hours when I came home (with no adjustments from the recipe aside from the weight of the beef) and it came out wonderfully. This recipe is a definite keeper!

AWESOME RECIPE! My suggestions for the recipe are cook it for the 2.5 hours straight in the Guinness (i used a 14.9oz can instead of the suggested 12oz) at 300 F. I also flipped the meat every 45 min or so and added fresh ground pepper to each side as it cooked. After the 2.5 hours i flipped the meat, as well as added some chopped celery, onion, carrot, 3/4 head of cabbage and some chopped white potatoes (golf ball size or smaller). Then i poured a bottle of Smithwick's over it all and returned it to the oven for another 45-60 min. I ended up removing the meat a bit earlier than the veggies, so i may have done good to add them a bit earlier, but i also prefer my carrots and potatoes real soft. The brown sugar, pepper, guinness and smithwick's make for an AMAZING flavor though, i even added some of the remaining liquid (about 1.5-2 tbsp) to some mashed potatoes and it tasted great as well.

We followed the recipe as instructed and we felt that it needed to be cooked for several more hours. The beef was still rubbery and chewy after only two and half hours. We removed the veggies and placed the beef with the broth in a slow cooker and cooked it for about 8 more hours on low and it came out great! The next time we do this we will plan for it to stay in the oven for at least 4-6 hours. We will also increase the stout to 3 bottles. The veggies came out extremely yummy!

This recipe is excellent! I followed the directions exactly except that I cooked it in a crockpot on low for 10 hrs. I also added the spice packet that the meat came with. During the last 1.5 hrs. of cooking, I also added potatoes and carrots. It turned out wonderful. Thank you!

I made this last year for St. Patrick's Day and really liked it. My husband didn't care for it - he prefered Corned Beef cooked in a crock pot so it falls apart. The Guinness gives it a very good flavor. Last year I followed the directions exactly and it was a bit tough. This year I wanted to make it for St. Pat's Day again. I thought I had a corned beef in the deep freezer but it turned out that all I had was a Bottom Round Roast instead so I used that. I also ran out of Guinness and the little store by my house didn't have any so I used a JW Dundee's Original Honey Brown Lager instead. The only veggies I had on hand were carrots. Instead of putting the roast on a rack I put it right in the beer. The meat had a good flavor but was still dry. I had to eat it w/ BBQ sauce. The beer gave the carrots a very interesting flavor - I really liked them. I think the Guinness would have been better though. So all in all I would recommend to only use Corned Beef w/ this recipe and not substitute the Guinness and definately put the meat right in the beer. I'll plan better next year! :)

I thought the corned beef was pretty good but did not care for the vegetables cooked in the beer broth, too strong and a little soggy, even on a rack. Maybe need to cut some of the stout with beef broth.

This came out really well.  The beef soaked up the aroma of the beer and made my apartment smell so good!  I actually basted the meat every 30 minutes, added two beers and then some carrots towards the end.

No-one really like it...actually my son "lost" his dinner as soon as he was done and settled for a peanut butter sandwich.  I won't ever make this again.

I fully enjoyed this and it is a keeper, I only rated it 3 stars because my husband wasnt fussed. In future I will serve it to him with a white sauce as I think that may take some of the sweetness away. Or with broccli and white sauce. Anyway the leftover are great in sandwiches.

I have been making this recipe for years now and my family and I love it. I normally cook it in the oven as per the recipe. Over the weekend I did it in the slow cooker as other people have done, but I didn't like the consistency of the meat. It just shredded when I cut it. I will stick to cooking it in the oven.

FANTASTIC!!! This was the most delicious brisket I have had. I only changed the recipe by putting the brisket in a crock pot on high for four hours with still fabulous results. I have been recommending this recipe to all of my friends.

Made this recipe March 18, my first attempt at making corned beef and it was a hit! I followed the advice of others and made it in the crock pot, directly in the beer, and with some water for the veggies. Overall cooking time was about eight hours and the meat was perfect.

The corned beef was awesome and extremely easy to make.  I followed the recipe, but put the brisket right in the beer, and it turned out perfect. If I would have had more time I probably would have cooked it longer or used my slow cooker. I served it w/ Diane's Colcannon(on the site), it was a great St. Patty's day dinner.

The flavor of this was really good. I think the brisket we had was really fatty, so it was real chewy and I didn't like that very much. This is the first time I've had corned beef and it was overall a good experience. We may even have it again for St. Patrick's day next year.
Okay, after picking out the right cut for my corned beef after reading previous reviews, I must say that this is absolutely divine. I never thought I'd like corned beef, but boy howdy! it was sooo good.

This was the second time I have made corn beef.  The first time I boiled it on the stove and it was really stringy/tough.  This time, I put it in a slow cooker overnight.  It was flavorful and fell apart with a butter knife.  I added the spice packet and used two beers in order to ensure it was covered while cooking.  Delicious!  Will make it this recipe again.

I've never made corned beef before I made this recipe. Now I'll never have to try another recipe. I thought the sugar would make it too sweet but I found that the guinness balanced it out nicely. I made this recipe with "Diane's Colcannon" for Saint Patty's Day and it was a hit.

First time making corned beef.I put a 3 lb. flat cut piece in a dutch oven. and followed the recipe exactly. I think the timing is a little off. For my piece of meat it took more like 4 1/2 hours to cook. It did evently come out tender and it was gobbled up.Just for comparison I'll try the crock pot mext time. But the taste was good!

This was the hit of the party. We made three different corned beef briskets and this tasted the best by far. The Guiness infused the meat with flavor and kept it moist.

Absolutely amazing- followed the directions, except I just put it all in a small dutch oven with the lid on and it came out perfectly 2 1/2 hours later.  My whole kitchen smelled Yummy!

Be very careful with the sugar you use, as too dark changes the flavour dramaticaly. My husband is Welsh and unfortunately he was not as impressed as I thought he would be.

Turned out a little salty but I think it was because of the corned beef I purchased.  Next time I'll try it with plain brisket and I'll add some beef broth to the guinness.

I had never made corned beef before, this was a very simple and easy recipe that everyone liked. I used a 4 lb point cut roast and I added wedges of cabbage, red pot. and carrots during the last hour of cooking in the oven. used a bottle and 1/2 of octoberfest beer and added flour and water to the drippings for a gravy that everyone felt 50/50 on liking. a great St. patty's day experience.

This is a real great twist on a classic Irish meal.  We always have corned beef on St Pat's, this year I decided to break with tradition and followed this recipe.  I tweeked a bit by using my crock pot and following an earlier suggestion to layer with some sliced onions. Then I cooked this on low for about 10 hours and added a 2nd bottle of beer, carrots, potatos with 3 hours left and cabbage toward the end.  I recommend breaking with the recipe and slow cooking the meat, corned beef can be a tough cut and slow cooking will make it more tender.  One friend was said "Huh, I didn't think I would like corned beef but this is good!"

Yummo! This was amazing.  My guests said the best they've ever had and oh so easy.  I used 2 cans of Guiness and cooked for 6 hours for high in the crock pot. So tender and flavorful.

This did not turn out so good for me. I cooked it for 3 hours and the meat still was not tender and the beer and brown sugar just turned into a liqued mess in the pan that spilled when I went to take it out of the over.

This was excellent and I placed cabbage, potatoes and carrots around the beef for the last hour.  The cabbage soaked up the sauce and it was great.  I think I will save the sauce next time and a little bit of cornstarch to it.

This was really very good.  Added cornstarch to the drippings and tasted very similar to red eye gravy.  Everyone commented that it was really good!

This was just okay - nothing special.  We LOVE Guinness and we love Corned Beef, so I thought the combination would be great. However, it tasted just like regular Corned Beef. I followed the instructions completely too.  Bummer.

We made this for St Pattys of course--sorry for the late review, but it was actually quite tasty!!  Not crazy about Guiness itself, but it was perfect for the corned beef.  This will be our staple for the Irish holiday!!

I used this recipe with a little twist to make 100 pounds of corned beef for a fundraiser.  The only thing I did different is I cooked it in crock pots instead of in the oven.  It was to die for!!!  I had people come tell me that they did not even like corned beef but loved how this tasted....not salty.  Thank you so much for submitting this for me to use.  It will definately be used again at next years fundraiser....however we sold out in only 1 1/2 hour so I guess I'll be making lots more.  Thanks again!!!

This meat had a different flavor and texture from the boiled and it was a delicious change. I don't usually make gravy but the juices tased so good I did.Everyone liked it even those who don't like the boiled dinner of corned beef and cabbage. I'll make it again

This was SCRUMPTIOUS, but took about five hours to get tender; enough time to make twice the amount of carrots, new potatoes, chunked onions, and cabbage on top.

This was the first time that I had ever attempted to make corned beef.  Everyone loved it!  Although I did have to cook it much longer than the 2 1/2 hours.  I will definitely try this recipe again throughout the year.

Didn't do it for me.  Perhaps because I'm not a fan of Guinness the beverage (whatever possessed me to pour it all over my dinner, then??), but I didn't think it added anything, and the flavor intruded unpleasantly into the flavor of the vegetables.  The brisket turned out OK, but I was left with a pool of bitter-tasting liquid.  I was confused by the suggestion that I might ahve to add more of the stout after 90 minutes of cooktime...I had PLENTY.  I did pour in a bottle of Yeungling when I reheated for dinner (after draining the residual Guiness).   Next year, I may just stick with the recipe on the brisket wrapper!

I make a lot of corned beef.  I usually simmer it on the stovetop or in a crockpot.  With both those methods I add 2 or 3 bottles of Guiness--so I thought I'd like this recipe.  I cooked for the time called for--and my meat came out somewhat dry.  My family gave this a thumbs down--they prefer the softer, more moist corned beef.

My husband loved this - I used Harp.  It was very tender - even I liked it and I don't usually like corned beef and cabbage.

I had high hopes after reading the other reviews, but this recipe was just not my thing.  I cooked per directions (and tried longer after that didn't work) and it was as hard.  I also thought the taste was peculiar.  I guess I am just a traditional corn beef kind of girl!

Given the reviews, I was very excited about making this recipe, only so after 2.5 hrs. I could be very disappointed.  The taste wasn't too bad, but not as good as I get it after boiling the corned beef in a steamer....here the meet was tough, something I'm not used to with corned beef...will stick to the original and stay away from this recipe

Family really liked this one. Corned Beef is so strong anyway the beer just enhanced the flavor.
