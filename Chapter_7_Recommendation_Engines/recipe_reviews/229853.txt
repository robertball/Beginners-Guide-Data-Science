This was very good! I only made 1/2 of the 'breading', and I still had quite a bit leftover after coating all the fish, so... I also reduced the garlic powder in the slaw, as 1 Tbsp. granulated garlic powder seemed a bit much to me. The fish itself came out very flavorful and moist. Everything went together nicely! Thanks for sharing. :)

I would actually prefer this without the bread, or maybe a burger size.

The breading is perfectly seasoned.  The spicy slaw is unique and delicious and adds nice cold crisp mouth feel.  I've been using Allrecipes for 5 years now and this is the first review i have written.  After dinner i threw together another batch of the breading for the next time.  Hope this gem doesn't stay hidden.  I fried at 320 for 5 minutes.

Quick and easy just the right amount of heat and the fish was crispy adding cole slaw gave it that pop and sweet crunch.
