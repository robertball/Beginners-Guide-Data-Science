These muffins were very good! I left the rum extract out by mistake, and used 3/4 cup fresh pineapple, instead of dried. I'll use more next time! Also, the reviewer that pointed this out was right - the recipe makes 18 muffins, not 12 (we definitely didn't mind!).

This was a great and easy recipe.  Instead of muffins, I made a cake in a 13x9 pan.  Silly me, I forgot the baking soda, and the cake still turned out and was delicious.  Granted, it was a bit more dense than cake, more like bread or pound cake consistency, but it still received rave reviews.  It was moist and flavorful.  I made a crumble for the top out of butter, mixed spices, oats, shredded coconut, and brown sugar.  It complimented the cake really well and added a nice, contrasting texture.  I find it difficult to find good recipes with true carribean flavors, but this one is excellent.

TO correct the typo in the recipe, I used 1 tsp. of vanilla instead of the 1 tbsp. of rum as was instructed.  I added more pineapple and coconut also.

This recipe turned out moist and tasty! However, I had to alter the recipe: I used margarine instead of butter because we were out of butter. I used 1/2 tablespoon of VANILLA extract instead of 1 Tbsp of rum, I used 2 large bananas instead of 3 medium, I used 3/4 cup of sweetened, shredded coconut because that's all we had, and instead of dried pineapple I used 1/2 cup drained canned pineapple tidbits. I will make this recipe again, still with my alterations-however I will use butter next time for a richer flavour.

Dry and cloyingly sweet.  I couldn't get past the first bite.  Definitely deceiving because they look so much better than they taste!  The flavor of banana is prominent but the rum, coconut and pineapple  flavors are all but lost in that of sugar.  I was also disappointed that the yield was totally off.  One recipe made 21 good-sized muffins, not 12.  I realize the given yield can only be an approximation, but this wasn't even close.  I didn't need that many.  I wasn't prepared for that many.  The recipe was good...in theory.  The real thing will be tossed.

THESE WERE AWESOME!  I used slightly less brown sugar than called for (and may alter it next time to use honey or agave instead as I prefer not to eat 'sugar', anyone have any suggestions on making the modification???) and used canned tidbit pineapple chopped into bits.  Mmmmmmmm.  These were very tropically and moist.  I didn't taste too much of the coconut sadly, so next time I may omit the flaked coconut altogether and add 1/2 rum extract and 1/2 coconut extract instead.  My husband is 'not a muffin fan', which he told me today after ten years of couplehood, ha ha, and he thought they were not moist enough.  I told him I don't care, that I'll be making these often for myself.  Today in fact, because I have some pineapple left over!  :)  Don't worry, I'll still find something to bake for him...but I'm glad I get these all to myself!

I'm always looking for ways to use up ripe bananas...these were really moist and I liked the taste of the coconut and pineapple. Next time I think I'll increase the pineapple to at least 3/4 cup and add some diced maraschino cherries. Following the recipe exactly I ended up with 18 nice sized muffins.  Thanks for sharing!!!

I thought this was an innovative muffin recipe so I tried it out. I did change a couple of things: I dont like shredded coconut much so I omitted it except for using a little as a garnish on the tops. Instead, I substituted the rum flavoring(also something I dont care for) for an equal amount of coconut extract. I also substituted the same amount of puree'd canned pinapple for the dried. They came out heavenly. Next time I make them, I will increase the bananas to four as I think it would make them even more moist and dense. Also, I didnt have butter on hand the first time so I used margarine which I WOULD NOT recommend doing-I was lucky they still came out despite that mess!

I just loved these muffins, if you are making these make sure you use the rum ~ it really is what gives these the extra kick.  I did tweak this recipe a little.  I only had 2 bananas, so had to use just those.  I used a mixture of white and brown sugar.  I increased the rum extract to 1.5 tablespoons and the coconut  I used 1/2 powdered coconut (from the asian store) and 1/2 shredded.  I did'nt like the look of these muffins so decided to use my own coconut streutsel ( 1/4 cup all-purpose flour, 1 tablespoon white sugar, 3 tablespoons sweetened flaked coconut, 2 tablespoons butter  simply mix all the ingredients together and put to one side). Once I filled the muffin papers to 3/4 full I added streutsel mixture to the top before putting in the oven, they really did give the finished muffins a m ore professional look.  Like other reviews stated this recipe makes approx 18 good size  muffins!

Although I am not a big fan of muffins, I had all ingredients on hand and decided to try these while family was in town.  They were excellent and everyone loved them. I used 1 c mixed dried tropical fruit, and substituted vanilla for rum.  Especially liked the nice large size and the dense moist texture.

Excellent muffins! I thought they were perfectly moist... and, I am baffled by other reviewers who say the recipe as written makes too many muffins?  I got 12 perfectly sized muffins out of the recipe as written.  I agree with others that the coconut and pinapple flavors really aren't very strong. I will use rum extract next time- I used vanilla because it's all that I had on hand. I will definitely make again.

I can only give this 3 stars because, although the taste was okay, they were a little drier than I prefer. I made the recipe as is because this was my first time using it. I'll keep looking for one I like better.

Love this recipe!  Best muffins I have ever had.  I took the suggestions others made and made a couple changes.  I used 1tsp of vanilla rather than the rum extract, 2 bananas, 15 1/2 oz can of crushed pineapple drained, 1cup of packed coconut and on top of the muffins put some brown sugar and coconut.  Awesome!  Great recipe.

I use this recipe often. I love the taste and texture the pineapple and coconut provides. I often used crushed pineapple instead of dried, reduce the sugar and use some random combination of butter, coconut oil and or apple sauce to sub for the butter. This makes a nice loaf and both the loaf and cupcakes freeze well.

These muffins were the most delicious muffin I have ever made.  They were so moist, flavorful and easy!  I did make a couple of changes.  I used a tsp.of vanilla extract instead of rum..I did not have any rum.  I also added 15oz.drained crushed pineapple rather than the dried pineapple and I added a crumb topping with 2 tbs. flour, 1/8 tsp. cinnamon, 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1tbs butter

Reduced rum extract to 1 teaspoon, and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  Used toasted ribbon coconut which I crumbled before putting into batter, and sprinkled the tops of the muffins with coarse sugar crystals with a little cinnamon.  Very tasty!

I just made these and they are great! I gave it 4/5 because I cut a pineapple up and in to small bits and used a cup of that rather than the dry. I also added chopped walnuts and cranberries. I did have a tiny bit left over, probably from the extra I added, but I just topped them all off with it to make bigger muffins. Great recipe, thank you!

Very good! Our family really liked these muffins.  The recipe made exactly 12 of our usual size; maybe we like larger muffins than some other people!  I was afraid to use a tablespoon of rum extract, so only used a teaspoon.  Next time I will trust the recipe and use a tablespoon.  I used drained crushed pineapple instead of dried, substituted whole wheat flour for half of the flour amount, added a dash of nutmeg, only used half the amount of brown sugar, used coconut milk and canola oil to replace the butter, and put all the coconut on top instead of mixing it in.  It was less than a cup, but we could really appreciate it more fully on top.  My teenagers said we need to have these again  -  a true sign of a winner!  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe.  Alway try to adapt with the things that I have on hand.  Found some dried pineapple in cupboard while cleaning so needed to use it up.  Had only frozen butter so I used coconut oil and organic cane sugar and used 1 cup of pineapple.  Didnt look like the picture but would be oh so good with a cream cheese frosting with some large coconut flakes in it...YES it made 18 nice sized muffins and I loved that they came out of the papers without sticking.  Nice and dense, not crumbly~

These were really delicious, and perfect because I have a lot of dried pineapple chunks to use up. The coconut, banana and pineapple flavors blended perfectly. They were great breakfast muffins and they froze very well also. :) I will be making them again.

These were the best muffins I've made in a very long time! I used dried unsweetened coconut, real rum and fresh pineapple. Awesome in January when we'd rather be on a Caribbean beach...thank you!
