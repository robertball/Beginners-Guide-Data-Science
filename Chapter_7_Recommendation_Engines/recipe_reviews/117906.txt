This was a great use of leftover chicken. I did eliminate the salt, thought there really wasn't a need for it and also didn't use the chicken bouillion, but rather used a chicken base. It went together in no time and dinner was on the table in 30 minutes. Love the pecans, it's a nice touch to a basic recipe. I'll remember to do this again with extra chicken.

Really a good recipe that just needed some additional seasoning to pull it all together. I made 4 servings for the 3 of us which turned out to be a good thing, as my Daughter couldn't wait to eat the leftovers for breakfast. I upped the lemon to about a Tbsp. Served over rice with mixed vegetables. Thanks!

I am working on a tight budget to feed my family (as is everyone I'm sure) and I had some left over chicken to use up.  So I tried this one out and the whole family loved it!  My husband rated it an 8 (on a 1-10 scale).  I give it a 9.  I will definetly be making this agian.  I'm gonna make a turkey for Christmas dinner and make this with the leftovers.

Thanks!!
Loved the pecans in it!!

Great flavor, super easy and fast to make, perfect porportions for two. Great meal if you're looking for a budget friendly meal. I used to make it all the time when my husband was unemployed and it didn't taste like we were skimping by at all. We still enjoy having it at least once a month.

My kids really liked this, but I wasn't quite pleased with the flavor.  I used 2% milk.  Maybe whole milk would have made a difference.
