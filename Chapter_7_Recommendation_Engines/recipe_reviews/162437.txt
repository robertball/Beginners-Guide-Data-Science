I was excited about this recipe because it allowed me to use a variety of seasonal fruits.  However, it never set well and after one day the liquid was dissolved and it was unusable.  I would make this type of pie again but would probably use whipped topping instead of the yogurt and freeze the pie to make it last more than one serving.

I was intrigued and needed a light summer dessert so thought I'd give this a try.  Delcious and easy! I did forgo the marshmallows- personal preference, but did garnish with extra berries.  We all enjoyed this a lot -Thanks luv2cook!!
