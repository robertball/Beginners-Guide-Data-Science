Absolutely wonderful.  The final product comes out rather sweet but I found that the cookies had a tendency to crumble (as shortbread-type cookies do) if the frosting was too thick.  Problem easily solved though by thinning the frosting.  Definitely a keeper!

I love these cookies! My grandmother has made them for years, but only recently did I find out that her name for them is "maidenhead cookies"!... hahaha, still very irresistable!

These are my favourite christmas cookie!  The recipe is perfect, but how you make them makes a big difference.  We have made them 6 times now, and I think we have perfected the technique:
1. Instead of mixing all the ingredients, add them one at a time and mix between each.  **don’t forget the almond extract!  It’s missing from the instructions.  
2. strain the cherries before you start baking so they’re not super juicy.  This makes them easier to roll
3. use only a tablespoon of dough per cherry.  The recipe will yield about 35 cookies, and they won’t seem dry
4. My bake time was 20 minutes
5. instead of icing and coconut, I use the maraschino juice, thickened with icing sugar. Dip the cookie top in, then dip it in toasted, crushed almonds.  
Perfection!

One of my favorite holiday cookies, a soft shortbread type with a cherry accent peeking out the top. I have never iced them, but  might add that next time.
