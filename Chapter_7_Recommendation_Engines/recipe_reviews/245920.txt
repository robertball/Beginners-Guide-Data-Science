We loved and enjoyed it. I particularly loved how easy it was to put together. The only different thing I did was that I added salt and pepper.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Will make again and again!  Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe.

This was very easy to put together and perfect for a weeknight meal.   The sausage and tortellini worked very well together.   Make sure you use a good quality marinara sauce since there are so few ingredients in the dish.  I did add a little chopped parsley at the end for a touch of freshness.   A little basil would be nice also.

I did this a little different. I used four cheese Italian sausage (cooked on the grill), no green peppers and sauted the onions and garlic in EVOO, shredded monterey jack cheese instead, plus parmesan. I also used Italian seasoning, parsley, salt and pepper and basil. Still kept the oregano. To finish it I broiled it to melt the cheeses and make a slight crust on top. Wonderful! Will definitely make my own version of this recipe again!

Love it! I’ve made this multiple times. I’ve made it in the frying pan and then baked it. I’ve been using garlic & onion powder with the sausage and belle pepper and it stills comes out super delicious!!

Followed the receipt, except used the hot links.  Did not have enough pasta, so the dish was runny, but good flavor.  I liked it, but the family was not a fan of the dish, so won't make it again.
It would be a easy and tasty dish for a pot luck!

This was indeed easy to make and tasty. My boyfriend went wild over it; I don't know if I loved it *quite* as much, but still definitely enjoyed. 

Used a yellow onion and pre-chopped garlic. I unfortunately wasn't able to get my hands on fresh tortellini, so I used the frozen kind. I used a nice marinara sauce (Rao's homemade), which was a little pricier but worth the cost, since the marinara is pretty important to the overall flavor of the dish. I did make a few minor additions: added some salt, pepper, and chili pepper.

I accidentally used fresh basil instead of oregano, obviously wasn't reading closely, and it was a great mistake! Another change I made, that was intentional, was I used hot sausage  because my husband loves spicy things and it was also a great change.  I am thinking that this would be a great dish to take a pot luck dinner.

Very good.  switched to a baking dish for the oven part and it went very well.  Added a little extra garlic and used basil instead of oregano.  Came out great.

This dish turned out beautifully!  My whole family loved it!  The only changes I made are that I left out the onion as my son hates them and I increased the garlic.  Oh, also I use the already minced garlic stored in olive oil one can purchase at the grocery store.

We loved this, and it was really east and quick. I used the Bertolli garlic alfredo sauce instead of marinara to make it more diabetic friendly.

Good flavor but maybe a bit mushy because of the refrigerator section tortellini I used. To me, the combination of the smoked sausage and cheese tortellini as well as the other addition of cheese was richer than I prefer.   Next time I would just use penne pasta in place of the tortellini.

Oh yes. This was good.  Will be making it again within the next 2 weeks. I just didn't keep it in the pan to put in the over. I put it in a casserole  because I didn't have an ovenproof pan.

The marinara sauce overpowered the taste of the tortellini.  I'm not sure how it could be modified, either, because there was barely enough sauce to cover everything as it was.  Perhaps I'd be happier with a different kind of pasta sauce...three cheese or something, but there are plenty of recipes out there so I just won't make this one again.

The most popular dish in our household that I've ever made originating from this app (out of a few dozen). I erred and put in two 24 oz jars of marinara but otherwise kept it as written.  Still came out great!

I'm not a fan of green peppers but this is a good recipe. I might use less sauce because not all of it cooked out and Ragu is a good substitute, if you don't want to make a trip to the store!

super easy and fast to make. Perfect for hectic weeknights! We used a more robust sauce than marinara and it was great. Family really enjoyed this one!

Quick and tasty. If you don't have the vegetables on hand or you feed picky eaters, there are pasta sauces that include the vegetables. Budget friendly and filling. GO MEAT!

This is a quick, easy & delicious dinner.  I did half the amount of cheese, used only 3/4 of the sausage(trying to cut back on meat), used red bell pepper because that is what I had, added 1 large chopped Kale leaf with the veggies and used spinach tortellini.  Even my casserole hating husband said it was good.

I enjoyed the ease of preparation with this dish. I used the Hillshire farms turkey smoked sausage. If I could improve one thing it would be to somehow reduce the sodium content. Perhaps a homemade marinara would work for this issue.

Delicious! I don't have an oven proof skillet, so after getting it all ready, I just put it into a casserole dish, topped w/ cheese and baked it that way...it came out wonderfully! I did decrease the oregano a bit per my family's personal preference, but that was my only change. This was quick and easy and the whole family enjoyed it...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
