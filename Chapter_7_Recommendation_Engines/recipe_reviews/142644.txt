I've made these twice now.  First time as written but then made a few changes for the better.  I didn't add the tablespoon milk to the dip, didn't need it. I did use the wasabi powder but only used 1/2 teaspoon.  For the green beans I cooked them in water instead of vegetable broth.  I cut down on the salt to 1/2 teaspoon and 1/4 pepper. The most important change I made was I used panko bread crumbs and it made these extra crispy.

Excellent!  I tried these for the first time at TGIFridays and wondered if I could find a comparable recipe on this site... I found one that's even better!  Thanks for the great recipe!

green beans turned out awesome . i made these for new years and the beans were a hit ... i didn't really like the sauce. i made double the green beans but i wouldn't recommend doubling the sauce we had plenty and a ton left over. also with the sauce i wouldn't use the wasabi powder it gives the dip a funny taste. i would use wasabi paste or mayonnaise.  we ended up using a little more horse radish too. other then that it was good.

This was a great appetizer! The only thing is it's a bit tedious and I didn't care for the dip.

I had a difficult time finding wasabi powder, so I used 1 tsp of horseradish, and 1/2 tsp wasabi sauce. The sauce was very runny. The beans are awesome. I did not measure exactly to the recipe. I thought there was a little too much  egg/milk mix. I saved the vegetable broth and put in the freezer so it was not just dumped down the sink. So, recipe is super messy, but worth it in the end.

Used this sauce with the recipe of Green Bean Fries also on this site.  It is a similar way to prepare the green beans without having to use up 4 cups of chicken broth.  In the sauce I almost doubled the amount of cucumber and added a pinch of black pepper.

I want to make these for my daughter who has always loved green beans but is getting a little tired of the same-old-same-old.  I am wondering, has anyone used can green beans for this recipe?  Thanks

The green beans are great, but this dipping sauce leaves a lot to be desired - no zing - very bland.
