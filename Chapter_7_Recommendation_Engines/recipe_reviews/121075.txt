Ohhhhhh, yeaaahhh.  Looking for the perfect side dish? One that won't drown out the flavors of your main dish and will let IT be the star of the show?  This is it! Gently enhanced with lemon and "amped" with soy sauce, this was just beautiful and downright delicious.  Use butter, not margarine, for best flavor, and cook the rice in chicken broth.  So delicious I could have eaten this on its own and skipped the "Oven-Baked Sesame Chicken" and "Almond Broccoli Stir-Fry" I served it with. But don't get me wrong - the three of these dishes together?..... perfect harmony.

Very good rice recipe as a result of modifying it.  I added 2 tablespoons of lemon juice along with a 1/2 teaspoon of lemon pepper to add flavor (for 4 servings). I strongly recommend that the lemon pepper and lemon juice be added to this recipe; if not, it will be bland.

I made this for a dinner party one night and now my husband asks for it all the time.  When I made it the first time I added 2X more hot sauce, also salt and pepper.  1/8 teaspoon of hot sauce it's not enough, you can't even taste it.  I personally like my food with a little zip to it.  It was a perfect combo of lemon flavor and spicey, definitly a crowd pleaser!  Made this rice with Grilled Lemon Chicken (from AllRecipes),..YUMMY!!

This side dish was a nice surprise! It has a wonderful blend of flavors; I liked the minced fresh herbs. I absolutely love the fresh hint of lemon-nice! I omitted the hot pepper sauce since no one can tolerate anything spicy but I did add lots of fresh ground black pepper. I just eye-balled the low-sodium soy sauce, to taste, never measuring. The peas are tender and sweet while the rice is perfectly seasoned. I served this with, “Oven-Baked Sesame Chicken,” and “Asian-Style Zucchini,” also from this website.

This is a wonderful side dish! I always boil my rice in chicken broth with garlic powder ... I just think it makes a big difference.

Magic! I love when I happen upon a dish that just fits the meal perfectly and I can throw it together with what I have on hand and in a whim, when I realize I should serve something besides just shrimp.  :) I didn't have parsley but didn't miss it this time around. A perfect balance of flavors; I loved the fresh zing of the lemon and how nicely it complemented the other flavors. As mentioned, I served this with a spicy shrimp...again, balancing the zip of the shrimp sauce. My bf said this is one to keep around!!

Good Stuff! What else can I say, It's like Chinese soul food! Served with Korean Spicy Chicken Tenders With Sweet Apple from this site. 0 leftovers! This recipe will be a regular for my family.

Excellent with the modifications suggested in the reviews. I didn't even bother with the lemon peel. I made 4 servings, adding 2 Tbl lemon juice and 1 tsp lemon pepper. Also used fresh peas and brown rice. Make extra, since the leftovers are great as a main dish adding chicken breast pan-fried in olive oil and lemon juice!

i am giving this 4 stars only because my husband liked it.  personally i just thought it was weird tasting and the flavors didn't blend well together at all, and i usually love lemon dishes. i did add the lemon juice and lemon pepper seasoning as others suggested (didn't have a lemon on hand) and i think it was the lemon pepper seasoning that made me not care for this dish. if i ever make it again (as an absolute last resort for a side dish) i wouldn't use that with the lemon juice, just one or the other. it was a little overwhelming using both.

This was very good.  I used lemon juice and dried lemon peel.  It went very well with the sweet and sour chicken I made.  I will make this again.

I did not follow the recipe exactly, which is why I only gave 4 stars. The recipe gave me an excellent base to start from with some ingredients I had laying around. I did not have green onions, so I browned some chopped red onion (about a 1/4 cup) and 2 cloves of garlic instead, I also added the juice of 2 lemons and about a 1/4 cup of chopped carrots in with the second half of ingredients. I used brown rice, and it tasted great. Next time I will also use the green onion.

It was pretty bland... It tasted like plain rice with peas and soy sauce.  I would probably jazz it up with some other spices.

Enjoyed this.  A nice variation on the traditional style.  I used basil instead of parsley.

I followed the recipe as written and thought it definitely needs more flavor. I will double the seasonings next time I try this one.
