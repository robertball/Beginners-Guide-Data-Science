This recipe is delicious. Everytime I make it people beg for more. I've given it as a gift to a friend and he hoarded it like gold! The crust is an amazing shortbread, and the topping is an amazing chewy, sweet nutty concoction. Delicious.

These were easy and fabulous. The toffee bits came in an 8 ounce package instead of 6 ounces, so I used 8 ounces and it worked fine.

Made a half batch in an 8*8 pan, expect using a whole egg.  I have to agree with another reviewer. These were bland and not very sweet.  The bottom layer was crumbly and bland.  The top layer didn;t have much flavor except for the nuts and was also very crumbly, the nuts fall off while eating.  Would not make again--a waste of very expense nuts.

Great Recipe!! The crust is buttery and flaky.  The topping is salty and sweet!  We're big fans of salt in our house so we used salted cashews and did not omit the salt from the recipe.  Word of advice:  Don't foreget to let them cool completely before cutting into bars.

I have made this several times, the only issue being the shortbread was too crumbly.  I looked up other shortbread recipes and found I only needed to increase the confectioners sugar to 3/4 cup.  Perfection.  I used unsalted cashews this year so a sprinkle of sea salt after baking was even better.  I knew it was a hit when family members were hoarding them.  Thank you for a wonderful treat.

Not sweet enough for me.  Everyone else loved them though.  Maybe chocolate drizzled on top?

Very tasty, super easy! How easy is it? I'm only 12 (pssst don't tell) and I could make it. However, I had to take away one star because the bread beneath the sticky (but yummy!) cashews came out very dry and crumbly. the top came out very delicious and all my family loved it! my uncle wanted me to send some to him. He loved even more!

I agree, this recipe is delicious!!   My mother makes something very similar, without the cashews, but they add something special to it.  My favorite way to eat these is cold from the fridge, and they're fantastic with ice cream.

Quite good. I am not usually a fan of bar cookies or shortbread-type bar cookies but these are wonderful. The bottom layer is slightly crumbly but perfectly sweet. The top layer is, of course, creamy and crunchy thanks to the condensed milk which makes most desserts divine. I have been looking for a cookie with cashews and this one  did it for me. I made these for a road trip and they were gobbled up within 2 days. Thanks:)

The bars were easy to make and delicous, however I needed to bake them so much longer than the directions. I have a fairly new oven and they still had to cook for about 30 minutes longer or the bottom crust would not have cooked.

Oh my goodness!!!! This is amazing!  AMAZING!   If you like shortbread, toffee and cashews, you can’t go wrong.  This is super easy to make and taste so good.  Definitely satisfies my sweet tooth.

Well I followed this recipe to the letter, but instead of toffe I used slivers of almond and craisins. The nuts did not fall off, and the crust stayed together. I was kinda weary because of the reviews.. But im glad I tried it..... One word.... AMAZING!!!

I am sorry, but this was just awful. No flavour whatsoever.Very disappointed. It needs some sugar or ANYthing in the topping. It's just too bland.
