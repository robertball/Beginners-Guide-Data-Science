I thought this was great!  Very easy and quick to put together too.  I added some garlic and onion powder to the burger and also 1/4 cup bbq sauce.  Helped give it some zip.

I made this today for first time and it was awesome. I outed the celery for a small white onion which gave it a little kick. I also added some horseradish sauce on the top bread which made it awesome..... served au jus on the side for dipping too as the recipe as is can be a little bland.

I made some slight modifications. I seasoned the beef with garlic powder and onion salt. I omitted the celery. I shredded the american cheese and added it directly to the beef mixture and poured in about a quarter cup of BBQ sauce. It makes a great addition to a buffet.

This is a great work night meal. I used ground chicken instead of the beef, 2% american cheese, and 2%percent mozzarella instead of the canned soup (my husband doesn't really care for it). I also sprinkled some parmesean and pepper jack after cooking. Great recipe, will make again. Thanks!

A little bland and pretty salty. Maybe next time I will look for a reduced sodium cheddar cheese soup?

I've made this several times but I've used BBQ sauce or sloppy joe mix in place of the cheddar cheese soup.  Then I cover the whole thing with shredded cheddar cheese and bake in the oven until the cheese is melted and the bread is crispy! My family loves it.

excellent starter recipe, to tweak to your own tastes and have on a busy night.  i added more worc. sauce and quite a few spices, and shredded sharp cheddar, mozz and american instead of the condensed soup which i hate, then out of the oven topped with a bit more cheese, tomato slices and a romaine leaf and it was wonderful.  thanks!

This is just ok. A bit bland for sure. I left out the celery, and added a can of tomato sauce.

I did not care for this. My husband and picky 10 year old liked it. My 5 year old did not like it either. I guess it just a matter of taste.

I would give this 5 stars if it was a little healthier.  But, boy is the flavor good.  Easy to do also.

What a great recipe, my husband just loved it!  I left out the celery, but other than that, made it per the recipe.  Easy, tastes great, you can't go wrong!  Will definitely be making this often, as my husband continually asks when I'll be making it again!

Quick and easy, but taste is just OK.  It needs something more but I'm not sure what--all I could taste was the cheddar cheese soup.  Everyone ate their sandwich, but no one wanted seconds and we threw the leftovers away.  We like sloppy joes and BBQ beefs much better.

This was a really good recipe. I was a little weary about it but I followed it and everything was really good. The only thing I changed was using a orange bell pepper rather then a green one. My boyfriend, he loved it too. 5 stars!!

I'm at a one with this, the husband at a three, so it's a middle rating at 2 stars.
