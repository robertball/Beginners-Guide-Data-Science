Hubby & I used little mini loaf pans to shape the meat (took them out of the pan) but they became so misshapen while cooking that we should have formed them by hand & saved ourselves the trouble. We added extra herbs & because of reviews saying it was a little too moist, we decreased the ketchup down to 3/4 cup. We also used 2 parts ketchup to one part bbq sauce for the topping. We have always preferred brown sugar meatloaf but chose this recipe because we wanted to serve it over halved new potatoes & thought the flavors would pair better. With or without the bed of potatoes, this is our favorite meatloaf recipe! We sliced the "loaves" & plated them on to top of roasted, halved rosemary potatoes topped that w/ grilled onion slices & served it w/ roasted asparagus & cherry tomatoes on the side. Great meal...thansk McCormick!

This was a hit with the family, especailly my wife(she got a night off from cooking), simply and good enough to make once a week. Did Exactly what recipe call for except with about a minute left to cook put american cheese on top to melt. Kids LOVED it. Definite hit with busy parents and hungry kids...

I've been making this recipe since last September. It's always a hit. I take a loaf to work for lunch and have been warned that I'd better bring enough for everyone next time. (I never do.)

Great recipe.  Prepared loaves according to recipe without coating the top and kept in frige overnight.  This saved me the prep time when I came home from work the following night.  Used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup for the topping and baked the final 10 minutes at a higher temp to make sure they would brown well.  They were absolutely delicious and made for a great sandwich the next day.  Definitely as my husband says..."is a keeper!"

We have never been big meatloaf eaters until I came across this recipe and now it is a family favorite!  They stick to the bottom of my non-stick pan terribly though, so I would recommend greasing it first.

Very nice taste but I would'nt use dried onion, use fresh! A touch more liquid would help me next time, I use very lean burger.

Liked these very much. Seasonings were nice and the glaze was yummy. Still haven't found a meat lof my 11 yr old will eat. tried to convince him this was more like a hamburger because of the size and the ketchup but he wasn't buying! I also tried some with melted cheese on top which some one else had suggested. good with and without.

Used 1/2 Oats and 1/2 bread crumbs, mixture was very wet, had to add more bread crumbs to shape into loaves.  Tasted great and had a very attractive look.

my husband absolutely loved it. The teen and I are not too thrilled with meatloaf, but liked this one. The individual loaves were a great idea. We'll make this one again. I usually do make meatloaf with BBQ sauce but used the recommended ketchup, the sweetness was a good contrast to the savory herbs.

I absolutely love this recipe!! My husband is a meat lover and he can't get enough of this meat loaf. I like it especially because it tastes a little Itailian (my favorite) and it is simple to make. I usually substitute crushed club crackers instead of the bread and it comes out great!

I was amazed at how delicious this came out! I doubled the recipe (to freeze some for later) and used 1 lb. lean ground turkey and 1 lb. extra lean ground beef, and I substituted the bread crumbs for oatmeal (per WeightWatchers Core plan). I couldn't believe how well these stayed together.. and I loved how much quicker they were to bake than a traditional meatloaf. I paired it with some roasted potatoes found on this web site, and it was awesome! I will definitely make this recipe again!

My husband and his mom loved these! They are like huge meatballs. I thought they had a little too much seasoning, but then again, I have been accused of liking bland food - I got praises so that's all that matters to me!

This meatloaf is so moist, it feels mushy in your mouth.  I like my a little drier.  Altogether, Not what I was hoping it would be. :o(

we loved it, we tried the recipe both with individual loaves and in one big pan. and it made a big difference in taste. we will defenatly stick to the individual loaves. it is also easier for meatloaf sandwiches (also a favorite in my house). the only thing i changed was i added 2 eggs, it made it easier to keep it all together.

This is my favorite meatloaf recipe.  My husband loves it too & that is saying a lot :)  I've made it many many times.  The only thing I change now is I add the basil & oregano into the meat mixture (although not as much as it calls for) instead of in the ketchup.  But that's the only change I make.  LOVE these!

They were to mushy, and I didn't really like the flavor. My husband liked it!  Good idea and a time saver. I usually love anything McCormicks makes.

I used this recipe as a base for a ground turkey and fresh onion mini-meatloaf and it turned out great.  I baked it about 10 minutes longer than it took to reach good internal temperature so that the outside could get a little more crispy. This was about 30 minutes for turkey.

Made this for my husband the other night.  I substituted onion powder for the minced onion.  Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.  He said it was even better leftover the next day.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I substituted spaghetti sauce and used Mckormick Roasting Rub French Herb Seasoning isntead of all those other spices.
I am not really a fan of meatloaf, but i loved this and so did my family. i used mini pot pie dishes to serve it with and baked macoroni and cheese.
will be making again in the future! :)

I tried to make this a little healthier by using half turkey and half ground beef.  It came out very rubbery so I do not recommend that at all.

This gets four stars only because the oregano and bazil were a little overpowering in the top layer of ketchup.  But everything else was great and my husband loved them!  He took the leftovers to work the next day!

This was AMAZING! I cut the recipe to four servings, baked it in a loaf pan, and just used ketchup on top (without the spices). I also used dijon mustard instead of the ground mustard, and omitted the onions, and used some extra bread crumbs. The final product was really good, and we will definitely be adding this to our stock of dinner recipes.

This is pretty good meatloaf!  I do like my usual recipe better because it has brown sugar in it and is a little sweeter than this one, but this one does taste good.  I did like the meatloaf patties  better then the traditional loaf shape.  They cooked a lot faster and I like the crispier edges.  I also topped the patties with more ketchup than the recipe calls for only because I LOVE the ketchup on top of my meatloaf.  So, although these were good, I'll go back to making my old standby meatloaf recipe and keep trying new ones, but from now on, I'm going to make patties instead of a loaf.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good. Hubby missed having real chopped onions and I thought it was a tad dry/crumbly but overall this was a good, regular meatloaf recipe. Thank you.

This is a great meat loaf recipe. My boyfriend who sweared he didn't like meat loaf tried it and liked it. I thought there was a bit too much of a g mustardy taste (which could of been cook's error) & we both thought it could of used a bit more ketchup on top but otherwise it's a great recipe.

This smelled so good as it was baking and then tasted great when it came out!  I baked it all in one glass bread pan.  We all had seconds.  It was a lot moister and crumblier than the one we usually have.  I might try adding the glaze later in the baking (in one pan) because it got a little like fruit leather -chewy.  I think I will try it next time in individual loaves to see what that is like.

This was just your average meatloaf.  It was easy to make and the individual sizes were a neat idea that made for extra crispies.  If I make this again, I'll probably ease up on the ketchup topping.

The whole family loved this simple dish.  I served it with broccoli stuffing.  Very filling.  The kids even asked to have it the next day for lunch!

I never ate meatloaf until two years ago... I've recently got married and now am always looking for recipies. My Irish husband is certainly a meat an potato man and he loves this meal. Being new to eating meatloaf and cooking it, I love this recipie and the results of it. I don't make the individual loaves, but rather bake it all in one glass pan and it is wonderful that way. Thank you!
