What is not to like?  We love Caprese!  A little balsamic glaze would put this over the top.

EASY FAST SOOO GOOD.
Makes a great lunch. I used goat cheese. Would also be good with an egg on it.  Buying glaze for next time.

Balsamic glaze is great on this.  Also, the garlic rubbed on the toast is essential.  We LOVE garlic.
