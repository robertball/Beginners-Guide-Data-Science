Love these! They were super easy, and the 2 times I've made them, they've disappeared quickly.  I used baby portobellas the first time,a dn white mushrooms the second - both were fantastic.  The second time I forgot to get green onions at the store, so I used chives, and they tasted just as good. :)

This is a good basic recipe, but we like a little more zip.  I added finely chopped celery, rosemary & thyme, and more black pepper; I'd like to try adding crumbled turkey bacon too.

made as recipe states though I had to substitute colby-jack for the cheddar as I had none.  It was fabulous.  Best served hot, so cook them last if possible.  DEEE lish!

Delicious, doesn’t require too many indredients and is easy to prepare.  I only used half the amount of stuffing and froze the rest to use at a later time.  I’m not sure it will hold up but thought it was worth the test.

These were very tasty. I will definitely make again. The only change I will make will be to decrease the amount of butter and replace with broth. I also don’t think basting the mushrooms with the butter added too much.

This was pretty good but it came out a little dry for my taste. The only part of the filling I could really taste was the bread crumbs.

my husband is diabetic so I had to x the breadcrumbs. Also, my grocery store -- I live in the boonies of NW NJ-- was out of scallions so subbed in leeks instead. Rather than breadcrumbs, did smashed low carb pretzels. Worked great! Only thing is I had much more filling than mushrooms. No biggie, used it in a stuffed bread which got amazing raves. Awesome, unique recipe. If you like hot stuff, add some fresh jalapegnos!

These are a hit. It makes a lot of stuffing so buy 2-3 packages of mushrooms.

This is a keeper.  Loved it!  I could have used a smaller chop on the pecans, not tiny but not quite as big as mine were.  Overall, this is a great recipe.  Thanks!
