This is the best mussels I have ever tasted!! Very simple ingredients, but very tasteful. The only change I did was using just 1 stalk of celery, 250 ml of wine mixed with bacardi rum and no parsley just more thyme. Garlic bread is great aside this dish. This was a tip from a friend, and as I said: It´s simply the best!!

This was a great recipe.  The only thing I changed was using garlic butter instead of normal as it added a nice change to the flavour.  TRhanks for the recipe.

Wonderful recipe.  I added two cloves of garlic, minced, sautéing 1 minute before adding the mussels.  I also substituted heavy cream for the crème fraiche.  So easy and so delicious.

Fabulous recipe.  Added a little zip with some cayenne, but otherwise just perfect.  The sauce is to die for...have lots of break on handy.

Easy, simple, and good but not as great as other shellfish dishes I've had. Since it was just us 3, I only used 1 onion and 2 celery stalks. I think this dish needs garlic and maybe use heavy cream instead of creme fraiche. Overall, we had a nice dinner! Thanks

Absolutely perfect. I live in Belgium where the mussels are served at nearly every restaurant, and I must say, these were on par with some of the best that I have tasted.

Wonderful!! My husband is from Belgium, and he thought this flavoring was as good as in Europe! My children loved it, too! We used heavy cream instead of creme fraiche. It was a good substitute. We'll definitely make these again for a special occasion!
