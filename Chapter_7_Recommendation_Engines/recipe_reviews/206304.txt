This dish is easy and extremely good.  Love it. I would suggest draining 3/4 of the juice from the tomatoes.

Absolutely Delish...and super easy to boot!  I took the advice of other reviewers and drained off some of the liquid from the tomatoes. It was a total hit.

A very nice way to eat courgettes.  I didn't have a Blue, and was too lazy to go out and buy, so I used a mix of Emmenthal and Parmesan.  But the next time I will make sure I have a bit of Roquefort on hand.  It would be even nicer, I am sure.

I love cooking with zucchini it takes on the flavor of the other ingredients you use I sort of make the same thing but instead of blue cheese I put in Parmesan cheese and onions and sometimes fry it in bacon delish 5 stars

Cooking instructions were spot on and ingredients simple but the flavors just didn't work for us.  By the time the dish was served, having "rested" to allow the cheese to soften, the entire thing was pretty mushy.  Won't make it again.

i used this as a starting point for our side dish for dinner.. my modifications are as follows: regular diced tomatoes (the little mex market by bf's work didn't have the fire roasted kind and i'm sure they bring that extra layer of flavor), mozz instead of blue cheese and a lot more than 1/4 cup.. i added about a tsp of Italian Seasoning I (from this site) to the zucchini and garlic as they cooked.. we were very happy with the end result and ate these inside of flour tortillas.. ty for the recipe

Good, but remember to drain the tomatoes or it will be way too watery.

I added mushrooms and red onion, drained most of the juice from the tomatoes (at the suggestion of other reviews), and used an extra dash of minced garlic. I saut√©ed everything longer than the recipe called for as I don't like a lot of liquid and it came great! My husband, who loves blue cheese, can't wait to have this again.

This was awesome!  The blue cheese is the key.  My husband absolutely loved it.
