Lets make this great recipe even easier. Cook the onions and garlic in a big, thick bottomed pan, add the chicken (chopped small or used cooked chicken that comes in the little pouch).Add dry spices and herbs. When chicken is not pink anymore and the rest of the canned ingredients. 1 can of tomato is plenty, the best corn is of the frozen kind. Top with the sourcream, tortilla chips , cheese or whatever else your heart desires! 
If this is useful-remember to mark it!

The great thing about this recipe is its flexibility.  You can adjust about any quantity to your liking and still enjoy the basic flavors.  For those who thought it too bland or too spicy, the solution is to adjust your seasonings as you go.  The parsley flakes, onion powder and garlic powder are not so critical, but save adding chili powder and salt for the last, especially because the boullion cubes will be salty.  Chili powder intensifies the perception of saltiness, so add it before any salt.  Start with half the recipe quantity of spices, wait 5-10 minutes as the soup simmers for the spice flavor to fully release, then taste.  Repeat this adjustment cycle as necessary until you're satisfied.

We save the sour cream to add at the table, along with shredded cheddar cheese and corn tortilla chips.  Want great tortilla chips?  Buy a package of fresh corn tortillas.  Spray or brush both sides with olive oil, cut each tortilla in half and then julienne them into 1/4" strips.  Spread the strips out on a nonstick cookie sheet.  If you like, sprinkle with sea salt, chili powder and/or cumin.  Bake 5 minutes at 425 degrees and check; sample and bake longer until the chips achieve your desired crispness.  The julienned chips are great because they're easy to pick up with a soup spoon.  You'll never go back to store-bought chips!

Wow is all I can say. Made this for the 1st time last night and my husband and I both agree it was delicious.  I decided to halve the recipe because I only needed to feed 2 adults and one child and even halfing it left us with plenty of leftovers for another meal.  I did decide to do this in the crockpot though. Here is what I did based off of other suggestions:  

Minus olive oil, corn and beans, threw everything in my crockpot (chicken breasts whole) and set on low for 8 hours.  Last 2 hours, I removed chicken breasts to shred (didn't take much as they fell apart from being in the juices), added chicken meat back in, 1 can of black beans (rinsed and drained), and the corn.  I did not use chili beans, whole tomatoes or sour cream as I prefer a lower in fat and calorie meal.  I did use a fresh pico de gallo from the store instead of canned salsa and used fire roasted diced tomatoes.  I topped our bowls with diced avocado and chopped cilantro and voila!  For the kids I added crushed fritos and cheese, the soup was not too spicy for my 3 year old.  So easy in the crockpot, I highly suggest making it this way.  So much flavor, and I will definitely be adding this to the rounds with no changes.

Excellent recipe, and this is how I make it easier on myself. I use a supermarket rotisserie chicken with the skin removed and shredded off the bone. I saute the garlic and onion in the olive oil and then stir in a little flour to absorb the oil. Then I stir in 2 large containers of good quality chicken stock, and add the shredded chicken. I also use the diced tomatoes with the chiles already in them, and I double the amount and omit the whole tomatoes and tomato soup.  I use a  medium salsa that has black beans and corn already in it too. I also hold off on the sour cream and let each person top their own bowl with corn chips, sour cream, green onions and shredded cheese. Especially good cabin recipe, winter or summer.  Yum!

I really liked this, but like others, I made changes: I left out the whole tomatoes and chili beans; used frozen corn rather than canned and tub of fresh salsa rather than jarred; I didn't have the patience to shred all the chicken, so I diced about half of it and it all broke up just fine; I spooned the sour cream on top of the serving bowls (good without, too) with sliced black olives--all yummy options! This definitely eats like a meal, but you can decrease the chicken if you're just looking for a side dish. Also, it freezes well. Everybody else may already know this, but I accidentally discovered that condensed tomato soup does a GREAT job cleaning electric stove elements and underpans. Those little discs in the middle of the elements are supposed to be silver! News to me!

WOW! WOW! AND WOW!  This was the BEST soup I have ever made.  It's the perfect blend of spice and  thickness, and it's FABULOUS.  

My one suggestion is if you are health conscious replace the sour cream with plain fat free yogurt.  In my opinion plain fat free yogurt tastes very close to sour cream when mixed in with things and it will save you alot of fat and calories!! 

Again, this was a great recipe!! :)

I LOVED this recipe!
I've been trying to eat meals with low to no fat and came across this one.
I love spicy food so this was right up my alley.
I substituted the tomatoes for a can of Rotel diced tomatoes with green chiles like Lucky0372 did and black beans for the chili beans. PERFECT.

Another thing, I just boiled the chicken for about 20 minutes, took all but 2 quarts water from the pot, then threw everything in and simmered for an hour. It was PERFECT.
Very spicy! My husband and I sat on the couch eating the soup with a box of tissues in between us for our runny noses from the spice-lol!

I've made this 4 times already and have only had the recipe for a few weeks. For me to make a meal more than once over that time is very rare, so it HAS to be good.
I'll be serving this soup to my grandchildren! (Well, I may have to cut down on the spice for them-but I'm keeping it as is for me!

This soup has become a staple in our house, by far the best soup I ever tasted. We just had a birthday party for my son and we made this soup along with other foods, everyone left with the recipe as they truly loved it. I gave some to my neighbor & he asked for the recipe saying its the best soup in the world. When I make a dish I follow the recipe exactly the first time & make any changes the second time as I see fit. I can say I only made a 3 changes, one was by accident, we forgot the sour cream & I have to admit I didn't notice any difference so to save on unnecessary fat and calories we omit it from now on. I also omit the corn, first I don't notice it in the taste nor feel it adds anything but unnecessary carbs and calories. One other change I make is I add about 1/2 tsp of Ground Red (Cayenne) Pepper. This make a huge difference in kicking it up just a bit, if 1/2 if too much try 1/4 tsp but I suggest adding it if you like a little extra spice is all. It doesn't make it hot but it will clear your sinus's out... This soup has helped me lose weight as I have been cutting fat & calories in my diet so I eat a lot of this soup as it has a lot of fiber, low in fat and low in calories. Since I write down everything I eat and keep track of my caloric intake here are the nutritional changes should you omit the corn & sour cream. 199.4 cal. 1.5g Fat, 25.7g Carbs, 23.4g Protein 7.6g Fiber per serving. Enjoy...

This is a great recipe!  I usually head straight for the 5 star rated recipes and, to do them justice, follow them to a “T” on the first go around. I’m no expert chef but I have been cooking for family and friends since I was 9 yrs old and as a California born and raised “Span-Mex-Rican” who’s been around Hispanic home cooking all her life, I’ve learned a thing or two about spicy cooking. I made some changes right out of the starting gate on this one. 

Omit the ½ Teaspoon salt – there’s plenty of flavoring (and sodium) in the bouillon
Use 4 cubes of chicken bouillon (1 less than original recipe)
Use 4 cloves of garlic (1 more than original recipe)
Replace 2 (14.5 oz.) cans of peeled and diced tomatoes w/ 2 (10oz.) cans of “Ro-Tel Diced Tomatoes w/ Lime Juice & Cilantro”
Omit the 1 (14.5 oz.) can whole peeled tomatoes all together
Replace the 1 (10 oz.) can of condensed tomato soup w/ 1 (7.75 oz. can of “El Pato” – Mexican hot style tomato sauce)
Replace the canned corn w/ 2 cups of frozen corn

For the Salsa: I used “La Victoria Medium”
For the Chile Beans: I used S&W Chile Beans (Pinto Beans, Chili Pepper, Onion, Garlic in Zesty Tomato sauce)

Cook as directed except: add Chile Beans before the corn & “lightly” mash the tomatoes and beans in the pot. (This further releases the flavors of the beans & tomatoes into the broth and the smashed beans make for a creamier consistency…I’m not a big fan of whole beans or chunky tomato bits in my soup.) Then add all other ingredients

Catherine should submit this recipe into recipe contest!  I made it last night with the following adjustments: 3 large breasts, 2 TBL chili powder.  I just simmered the breasts for 20 minutes, sauteeed the onions, and then threw everything into the pot and simmered for an hour.  My husband and I loved it and I have already given it to four people!

Man!  This soup was awsome!  It's chili made with chicken.  At first bite I thought it would be better made with beef, but by the end of the bowl, I'd totally changed my mind.  Chicken was the perfect meat in this.  We're not fans of White Chili, but this just knocked our socks off.  Ya gotta try it!  Thanks Catherine!

My husband and I enjoyed this soup very much. I only used 4 chicken breast halves, but it was still awesome and the chicken was so tender. I also added an extra can of corn. Next time, I will omit the whole tomatoes. Thank you Catherine!

I made this last week and it was great! I love soups and this was at the top of my list. I left out the condensed tomato soup, because I hate the fake flavor of it, and used a can of Rotel Original instead. Added some fresh cilantro and a few dashes of hot sauce, topped with a dollop of sour cream and some crushed blue tortilla chips. I could eat this often!

This soup was excellent and very tasty.  My children and I enjoyed it very much.   

Since we didn't like our food spicy, I cut the chili powder to about 1 1/2 Tbsp.  Also, I put a spoonful of the sour cream in each bowl of soup instead of putting the sour cream in the soup pot.

I made this last night for dinner and everyone really liked it. It is a very decent soup! We made a few slight changes though. I cut out the tomato soup and only used 1 large jar of salsa and 1 can of peeled and diced tomatoes. It was PLENTY of tomato for this recipe. You do not need more! I did not have any chili powder at home, so I used a Piri Piri spice mix which was perfect. In it was dried Bird's Eye chili, onion, paprika, sea salt, pepper, garlic, and cow's parsley. I cut out the extra onion and garlic powder, but I went ahead and added the fresh garlic, onion, and additional dried parsley. I used 3 teaspoons of the Piri Piri and 2 teaspoons of Cayenne Pepper. My husband and oldest daughter wanted the soup spicier, but my youngest daughter and I thought the soup had just the right amount of heat. The canned tomatoes were far too acidic tasting, so I also added a teaspoon of sugar as well. Then it was perfect!
I couldn't find Chili beans, but a can of kidney beans and a can of white beans worked just fine. The sour cream was served at the table for each person to add to the soup themselves. I found that the serving size was absolutely correct. I have enough leftovers for all four of us to eat another bowl. I froze it for later use. Everyone agreed that the soup should get 4 stars. It was delicious. The only request I had was less chicken and more beans next time! Of course, this is a personal preference. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

I have made this "soup" many times and each time i make changes to the original recipe. This time i wanted to make it less salty and lighter tasting while keeping the spice and heat.   I used 6 chicken breasts and that was more than enough.  I  substituted low sodium chicken broth for the bouillon cubes and added 1 bay leaf and cooked the chicken per the instructions and in 40 minutes the chicken was 165.  Next i chopped up 1 green pepper, 1 red pepper, 1 poblano pepper, 1 serrano pepper and 2 jalapeno peppers. I sauteed 1 jalapeno with the onions and garlic then threw the rest of the peppers in with the soup. The peppers gave the soup some nice color along with the heat. The heat will mellow overnight in the fridge if you're making it for the next day. I left out the  the sour cream and the can of whole tomatoes, used 1/2 the chili powder and substituted "No Salt Added" diced tomatoes for the regular diced tomatoes. Also, i blew off the corn this time but i use frozen when i use it.  The soup had a nice lite, spicy flavor without too much salt. This would be good in summer with some cilantro, a little lime juice and a margarita.

Definitely a keeper. Nothing to knock you out of your chair, but darn good and with so many ingredients that you can keep on hand, it's a real go-to recipe. Used drumsticks instead of breasts. Replaced the can of whole tomatoes with another can of diced (think next time I'll omit one of the cans. it was very tomato heavy). Left out the soup, seeing how tomato-y it was. Added a can of hominy and replaced a can of chili beans with black beans. Didn't drain the corn (because corn is soooo tasty!). choose a good chunky salsa because it imparts a lot of great flavor to this. Put the sour cream as a dollop on each bowl, instead of mixing it in.

I really wanted to try this recipe, but didn't have a lot of time, so I used a crock pot. I followed the recipe as it pertains to measurement of ingredients, but modified the steps a bit for the crock pot timing. As the chicken, water, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, parsley and bouillon cubes were cooking in the pot (kept it on low setting), I prepared the second half of the recipe. 
After combining the sauteed onions and garlic with all of the good stuff (minus chili beans and sour cream), I just removed a bit of the broth from the crock pot and added everything else in, except the sour cream and chili beans. After 10 hours on low, and getting up to a fresh batch of soup the next morning, I shredded the chicken (basically falls apart anyway), added the sour cream, and chili beans. It is VERY good and super easy to make, especially using a crock pot!

Being lovers of both white and dark meat chicken, I cooked a whole chicken subbing fresh parsley for the dried (I think dried parsley is vile stuff, and I always have fresh in my fridge).  I used better than bouillon base instead of cubes, and thought the chicken came out great; I would use this method to cook chicken for salads or some other use.  I wanted a soup, not a chili, so I used more of the broth in the soup, and used frozen corn.  I skipped the whole tomatoes and used three jars of petite diced but my finicky teen thought it was "too tomatoey".  Next time I will use two cans of crushed and one diced and she won't know the diff.  I tasted it at the end, liked it as it was, so I skipped the sour cream, although I did put a dollop on the leftovers and it was good.  Oh, and I threw in a chipotle pepper in adobo sauce that had been hanging around my fridge for a while. I will make this soup again...Excellent!

This is a very good and flavorful soup. I used diced tomatoes with jap peppers to give it more heat. I also used light sour cream and only about a half of tbs of olive oil to reduce the fat content. Give this soup a try.. I'll definitely make it again.

This recipe was very good!  I followed it exactly except I did not mix in the sour cream.  I ladled the soup in the bowls, put a layer of chipotle cheddar shredded cheese, chopped up green onions and a "dollop" of sour cream.  It was fantastic!  Thanks for sharing!

This soup is AWESOME!  Definitely makes more than 8 servings, but that's okay because you'll love the leftovers!  I added okra and use hot salsa and it turned out wonderful.

This recipe was excellent and makes enough for about a month but you will go through it quick enough. I made it for someone who was unwell and added some tabasco for some extra heat. It is a great change from the usual chicken soup.

This was the best soup!!!  Very spicy and full of flavor.  It's also healthy if you substitute the sour cream for non-fat sour cream.  It made so much and my husband and I will be eating this for a week - but it's so yummy that we don't care.

WHile this soup had a long list of ingredients and was kind of time-consuming to make, I have to say that it had an OUTSTANDING taste.  I used only 2 tbl. chili powder and it was perfect.  Other than that, I followed the directions exactly.  Delicious, really - impressed my guests.  Appreciate the recipe.

My husband and I loved this soup!  He said that I outdid myself with this one.  Like other users, I added a cup of instant brown rice and used black beans instead of the kidney beans.  I also used ALL of the water in which I cooked the chicken, not just the 5 cups the recipe called for.  An all-around excellent soup.

Great Soup! Very filling. I'm not a fan of kidney beans, so I used black beans instead. I also did not have enough broth after cooking the chicken breasts so I added regular canned chicken broth. Excellent!!!

This is a GREAT soup...very thick, and stew like.  My fiancee loved it.  I made a double batch to freeze and even though he ate it several times during the week, he took the frozen containers out over the course of the next week to bring to lunch!!  Yum!!  Thanks Catherine!! It was easy and I will make it again!

Mmm this stuff is good! Definitely only needs 1 can of tomatoes, and I actually forgot the condensed tomato soup, so it's fine without that, too! I only used 3 chicken breasts and 1 quart of water, and this nearly filled my soup pot! Thanks, Catherine! I like that it's unique enough from the other soups I make to be added to my mix.

THIS IS AN AMAZING SOUP! Reminds me of chicken tortilla. Very easy to make. I like spicy food (not too spicy though) but after reading the ingredients, I was unsure how spicy this would be. So everything that I could add "hot" (hot salsa, hot canned tomatos, even added a fresh jalapeno), I did. It was WONDERFUL! It makes A LOT of soup though so I am giving it away and I am sure my friends and family will LOVE it as much as me. My Mexican boyfriend even said that it tastes like an authentic mexican dish he has had before, which is a huge compliment because he is a picky eater!

This soup was really good...I made half the recipe and plan on eating it over the next few days for leftovers.  I personally didn't think it was spicy enough so I added a few drops of Dave's Insanity Hot Sauce to give it some good kick!

This soup is simply awesome, a new favorite in our house.    Here are my modifications:  I used 64oz. low sodium chicken broth instead of water & bouillon.  In addition, I used 1 can ob diced tomatoes w/ green chiles instead of the whole peeled tomatoes.  Finally, I used 2 cans of black beans instead of chili beans.  Love this soup!

I tried to emulate this recipe exactly but the day I decided to make it, realized I didn't have the ingredients precisely.  Had a couple jars of almost half-full salsas of two different brands and swapped one of the cans of chili beans for a can of black beans, only had one can of diced tomatoes and added twice the amount of chili powder called for.  Somehow, is still turned out phenomenal and I've never heard people speak so highly of my cooking before.  Thanks for an awesome base for many more great soup ideas!

Also, I didn't want the chicken to overwhelm the broth so I only used four breasts and so glad I did!

This was EXCELLENT!  I used Lasvegas00's review as a guideline for cooking this in the crockpot, and it came out great.  I added a little extra corn, and a little extra light sour cream, and used black beans instead of chili beans, but kept everything else the same.
My only beef with this recipe is that the serving information seems way off base.  I made this for myself only (since no one else likes spicy food), and figured I could take it to lunch for a few days this week.  So I halved the recipe, which should have been 4 servings, but I have well over 8 LARGE servings of soup. I'm not sure how I'm going to eat it all, and wish I hadn't "wasted" all the chicken.  Next time I will cut it in 1/4 for 4 servings.  I should have known something looked off when the original 8-serving recipe called for EIGHT chicken breast halves... that is a TON of soup!
Totally delicious, though :)

Great spicy soup for chilly fall night! I did saute the onions and garlic in a big pot until translucent. I also used a rotisserie chicken from my local grocery store. I used chicken stock and one can of tomatoes is plenty. Used frozen corn. I also topped with sour cream, tortilla chips and cheese. Thanks for a keeper!

This is SO good!  I only made 1/2, and for 2 people, could probably get away with 1/4 of the original recipe.  It makes a TON...but it's okay with me because it's absolutely delicious and makes great leftovers.  Next time I'll probably add another can of corn, because I liked the nice sweet contrast the corn bites had, but other than  that, wouldn't change a thing.  I served with Jiffy cornbread muffins, which went very nicely with the soup!

Absolutely yummy!  I added a pound of sausage and a can of black beans and omitted the can of cream of tomato soup and the corn. This made way too much for two people, but I froze some and will enjoy when the weather cools down :))

This was good.  For ease and to save time I bought a rotisserie chicken from the store and shredded it, then just started with a base of onion and garlic sauteed in oil and added the rest of the ingredients.  I would omit the tomato soup next time.  There is already an incredible amount of tomatoes in this recipe and adding that gave it a flavor of, obviously, condensed tomato soup, which I felt took away from the flavor of the other ingredients, which went well together.  I also used chicken broth in place of the water and bouillon.

This is a wonderful soup for guests.  I added more beans (black and red) and doubled the amount of corn (using frozens rather than canned) and left out the whole tomatoes.  I also cut down to 4 chicken breasts and 1 Tbsp chili powder, but added about 1 tsp of red chili flakes.

Love this soup but its NOT SPICY!  I had to add cumin and cayenne to give it a kick.  Otherwise I would have given 5 stars....its worth 5 stars with the spices.

Fabulous recipe.  Only made small changes due to making it in a crockpot.  First used only 1 qt of water, left out the whole tomatoes, added 1 tsp of cumin, used only 1/2 C of sour cream & added a couple handfuls of tortilla chips, crushed to thicken.  My family loved it & asked to have the leftovers tonight!

I made this for 6 people today.  I only used 4 breasts insted of 8...I feel 8 would be too much chicken.  I also used lowfat sour cream.  Every single person LOVED it.  I was told I "should can this soup and sell it", "this is the best soup I have ever tasted" "this is the best meal you have ever cooked".  Everyone had seconds and some had thirds.  There was only one serving left at the end of the night.  I will def make this again.

YUMMMY!!! I actually adjust this recipe as a nacho dip. I use all of the recipe, except use a HOT salsa and replace the whole peeled tomatoes with one 10oz can of HOT Rotel diced tomatoes with habaneros. So its not so soupy, I use about 2-3 cups of broth and drain everything. Its really not that hot either, it has a really nice kick. Serve as a dip with shredded cheese on top and tortillas. (-:

I just made this soup for dinner tonight and it's wonderful - great flavor!  I basically followed the recipe but used 1 can Rotel tomatoes in place of the regular and used black beans.  I will definitely make again.

Yum!  I made a few changes of course: 1) Picked up a rotisserie chicken to skip that step. 2) Used several large fresh tomatoes instead of the canned. 3) Used one can of tomato sauce instead of tomato soup just because that's what I had and 4) Skipped the sour cream.  Definitely a keeper!

Everyone really enjoyed this recipe.  It was different and tasted great the next day.  Next time I would skip the whole tomatoes and double the corn.  I reduced the chili powder by one teaspoon and it was still quite spicy.

This was a great recipe...easy to make and very tasty!  I did substitute black beans and added a cup of rice.  It also makes much more than the serving size indicated, but we don't mind these leftovers.  It is now a family favorite!

Loved it! 8 chicken breast halves seemed like too much to me, so,  I only used 5... I think using 8 would have left me with a pot of shredded chicken mush and very little soup. Next time I'd use 4 at the most. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.
Next time I would omit the whole canned tomatoes completely. Very flavorful soup!

This is the best chicken soup Ive ever had!! Wow! I followed the directions pretty much to the letter, since I am such a novice with soups. Cubed chicken instead of shredding it, and served it with lots of cilantro and shredded cheese. Amazing! Great flavor!! 
I also made some julienned tortilla strips in the oven suggested by another review, and added those as a garnish. Will definitely be making this again and again!

I've never reviewed a recipe before...but this was awesome!  We had a great organic bird for dinner, then as a I was making stock I came across this recipe.  I just used the left over meat and stock. I didn't have any chili powder so I used a dash of paprika.  It was also just fine without the bullion!  Thanks Anuttaf.  Great recipe.

Love this soup- though I think the boiling the chicken step is unnecessary. Whenever making chicken soup, I just buy a rotisserie chicken from the store, shred it, and use the carcass to make stock. This way, you can just sautee the onions, garlic, and whatever else (I like to add 1 green pepper), add the canned ingredients (buy spicy salsa if you like it spicy, mild if you don't), bring that to a simmer for half an hour, then add chicken and bring to simmer again until it's ready to eat. Season with salt and pepper to taste, stir in a spoonful of sour cream and top with tortilla chips.

Nothing beats a giant pot of spicy chicken soup in the winter months.  I think I would omit the whole tomatoes, I also only use 4 chicken breasts.  Make a massive amount of soup, perfect for entertaining!

Made this with fresh serrano peppers instead of cayenne and a whole mesquite smoked chicken instead of breasts. The flavor was fantastic and everyone who tried it loved it. I say play with the recipe - you can't go wrong!

It's no surprise that this recipe got so many high ratings. As 1 writer suggested, I shortened the prep time by btowning the onion along with the cut up chicken breasts.  It does not need the tomatoes at all.  I did not add them because my guys do not like chunks of tomato in anything.  Very flavorful soup!

I followed the original recipe and it's excellent.  Next time, I will use only 5 boneless chicken breasts and maybe add extra corn.   This soup will become a regular at my home.

Delicious.  I could have licked the bowl!  I didn't use tomato soup because I didn't have any.  I just substituted tomato sauce.   Also used 1 can kidney beans and one can of black beans instead of chili beans as that's what I had on hand.  Love this soup and I am not much of a soup eater.  Everyone raved.

Didn't follow the recipe exactly and it still came out fantastic. I kicked up the spice a little bit more by adding a little Texas Pete and Hot chili beans. I highly recommend this!

WOW! I love this soup. I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, except I used my own quart jar of homemade canned tomatoes vs the whole/diced cans of tomatoes. I also left out the chili beans since I don't like them. Also, I took advice from another reviewer and served with cornbread muffins. Delicious! Will definably be making this one again!

Wow this was really good. I basically used it as a starter and added/changed some things. I followed the same directions for making the broth, but instead I used 5 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves and it seemed like plenty. This is where I changed it. In a saucepan I added the olive oil, garlic and onions. I omitted the salsa and instead added chopped celery and carrots. While that was cooking, I shredded the chicken and reserved all the broth. To the garlic and onions I added 2 cans of peeled and diced tomatoes, the shredded chicken and ALL the remaining broth (I had about 6-7 cups. I actually omitted the rest of the ingredients and added a half of cup of rice. I let it simmer all together for about 45 minutes. Really amazing.

This was "pretty good." Considering I basically live in the heart of the southwest (New Mexico) and eat spicy soups quite often (mmm, menudo), I'll try to be fair. I made this for my boyfriends family, following the recipe to a T. They said it was, "good." But I could tell that they weren't as impressed as they usually are with my food. Perhaps this would taste good to people up North. But, IMO - I wouldn't make it again, and I'm sending the leftovers to my mother to deal with, as there are plenty :P Makes more than 8 servings!

Great stuff!  The only things I did to it were my typical little personal tweaks like pureeing tomatoes since I don't like the hunks, but that doesn't change the flavor any.  (Meaning, in fact, I just used all whole tomatoes.)  But all the spices, beans, etc. I did as is.  I cooked the chicken originally in the crock since that's the easiest way to shred chicken, something I dislike doing.  (And seem to do a lot anyway.)  After that I transferred to my Dutch oven which fits more easily in the fridge.  A good thing since there was plenty.  I halved the recipe and I doubt the whole thing would've fit in the Dutch oven.  This is easily at least 12 servings for the whole recipe, and I'm one who thinks a serving is a good big bowlful.  I like the level of spiciness just fine.  It was much like a tortilla soup.  Blopped on some extra sour cream on top.  I do have one issue, however: the prep time.  It's like the first step doesn't exist, so if you think you're going to start this recipe and have it ready in 45 minutes like it says, think again.  It doesn't say "cooked" chicken in the ingredients, so step 1 absolutely counts!!

Quick, easy and absolutely delicious!  As I am sure many others have done, I made a few tweaks to this recipe to suit my own tastes, and it is absolutely incredible.

In order to make this recipe less labor-intensive, I made it in a crock pot and let it cook throughout the day.  Rather than sautéeing the onion and garlic, I just threw it all into the pot to cook.

Tomato paste was substituted for the condensed tomato soup, as I don't like all of the ingredients I see on the label.  I also chose to leave out the sour cream (although I'm sure it would be delicious).

The verdict: a wonderful recipe that can be manipulated to your tastes and still turn out delicious!

I got very lazy and just threw all the ingredients into a crock pot and let it cook all day.  I even used frozen chicken breasts and cut them up after being in the pot for a couple of hours.  It came out so good I have to wonder if the original cooking recipe is any better!  Doing this is as easy as it gets!

My husband and kids said this was the best meal I had made.  Unsure how I feel about that however here goes my first rating.  It probably would have been even better had I followed the recipe completely.  Even so, only changes were one can of kidney beans instead of the chili beans, a small can of tomato paste instead of tomato soup (less sugar), and I used real garlic instead of ground.  I will be making this many times over and perhaps add some more spice on a day the kids are out.  Thank you!

This was an excellent recipe.  I halved it since there are only 2 of us, but we still had a lot left over.  I left out the whole tomatoes per other reviews, and changed the order of things so that I only messed up one pot.  I sauteed the onion and garlic in a large soup pot, added in the chicken to brown, then added the spices and stock.  Per other reviews I only put in chili powder to taste (and ended up not using the full amount - it was still hot).  Brought it to a simmer for 30 minutes  and then added the rest of the ingredients (no sour cream) and let it simmer for 30 minutes, breaking up the chicken (instead of taking out and shredding it). Served with grated cheddar and crushed tortilla chips.  It was excellent.

I liked it, but the amount of chili powder was overkill. I love spicy, but this wasn't quite the right kind of spice. Still, it was pretty good and I'm enjoying the leftovers.

This was awesome!  I cut the recipe in half, but used the full amount of salsa and tomato soup.  I ended up adding all the cooking liquid back in, it seemed to need it.  I agree with other reviews that this does not need the whole peeled tomato.  I used diced tomato w/ green chiles and frozen corn b/c that is what I had.  Even cut in half this makes a lot of soup.

Fantastic recipe! I used 2 tablespoons of Grandma's Zesty Chili Powder, and one of Grandma's (regular) Chili Powder. Also, substituted an additional can of drained corn in lieu of the beans. I also didn't have a can of tomato soup, so I used one 6 oz. can of tomato paste instead. OMG, it turned out incredible! Thanks for a great recipe!

I'm sure someone has pointed this out, but the "cook time" of 45 minutes listed at the top of this recipe is clearly off.  The very first step of the soup requires one hour.  I was careless, saw the 45-minute estimate and planned on making this in 45 minutes for dinner.  I was unable to finish in time, and we did not have this for dinner.  It was really tasty when it was finally finished, but I wish the cook time at the top of the recipe would be adjusted.

I made this soup on Christmas Eve for my whole family along with a large pot of Chili. This soup was cleaned out and everyone loved it! I substituted black beans in place of the chili beans and I added some cumin. I will definately make this again! Next time I will cut back on the bouillon as it was just a bit salty for my taste.

Very good soup, but I didn't give it 5 stars because from experience, after simmering the chicken for 1 hour, you have nothing but dried up shreds of meat.  I  simplified the recipe by skipping the 1 hour of simmering.  I started by sauteing the onion, garlic, etc.  Then added the water, chicken bouillon, and spices, and when the water boiled, dropped in cubed chicken breasts.  25 minutes later the soup was done!

It was a little tangy for my tastes, due to all the tomato and sour cream.  I'm not sure that I would make again, but it's all in personal taste.  I don't like overly tomatoey taste.  But my kids really enjoyed it, which was surprising given that they are so picky.

Wonderful recipe. I modified based on prior reviews to make it a clean recipe. Halved it and it still made a lot. I used 4 frozen grilled chicken breasts and about 8 oz frozen grilled salsa which we always keep on hand. Started with the onions and garlic per the recipe, added 2.5 cups of boiled water with 3 chicken bullion cubes dissolved (microwave), salsa, 1 can petite diced tomatoes, 1 can fire roasted diced tomatoes, 1 can corn, 1 can black beans, and 1/2 can condensed tomato soup. Then added the spices used in the chicken broth, also halved. Once it was combined well, I added the frozen chicken breasts and let it simmer covered on the stove for about 30 minutes. Then I took out the chicken breasts, shredded them and added them back to the pot and let it cook about 5-10 minutes more. Wonderful!

I made this last night and it was so yummie and easy!!!! I did use black beans instead of chili beans. I'm vegetarian so I took out the some salsa, corn, onions, beans, etc for me before i mixed the rest in with the chicken. My boyfriend loved it! I def will make this many times more! I also took some advice from Uncle Ed's Nephew and made my own tortilla chips! It was a great idea! All together it was awesome!!

I used 6 chicken breasts which was plenty and next time will make without the whole tomatoes.  Definitely a hit with everyone!  Made enough to freeze another whole meal.

Made a 2nd time and cut recipe in half.  Left out the chili powder.  It made PLENTY for our family of 4 with leftovers.

Begun this looking only at the ingredients and prep/cook time...directions say it takes an HOUR just to cook the chicken but prep time/cook time says 15 and 30. Be aware that this recipe takes much longer to actually prepare than what is advertised...

I always make a highly rated recipe as written first. The first time I made as is there was just way too much tomato for our liking and I felt like it was good but missing something.
The second time I made it I substituted the tomatoes for a few cans of rotel (hot because we love spice). I also add freshly sliced jalapeno when cooking garlic an onion. Since the corn only didn't seem filling enough I also add sliced carrots and green beans to make it more of a chicken stew and to make it more filling.
I add half the sour cream when cooking, and reserve the other half to top the soup when serving. The other day when I made this I added some cubed cream cheese to give it a thicker and creamier texture. I also add a few dashes of cayenne, again because we like the spice.
This is a good soup that can be adjusted to any taste. Simple and easy and it does make a lot which is great for freezing or leftovers.

one of the best flavored soups I've ever tasted. This recipe is a MUST TRY!   I make soups all the time, I'm so thrilled to find this recipe.  I will be adding it to my list of favorite family dinners! The soup looks as good as it tastes. Amazing.  I used a whole chicken- which made the flavor incredible. I used two cans of black beans and one can of pinto beans. I also substituted one large diced carrot for corn which we loved. Everything else I followed to a T. My family LOVED this spicy yummy comfort meal.  It's a delicious leftover too! Lastly, it took longer for me to prepare than it said .... but worthy of the extra time!

I loved this soup..I think 4 chicken breasts was way too much. I used 1 and shredded it, perfect amount. I also used one can of diced tomatoes and a small amount of shredded carrots. I think the salsa used makes all the difference in flavor. I used Aldis southwestern salsa. Very good soup. Thanks

I have made this soup numerous times and vary the type of beans that I use.  Whatever I have in the pantry is put in.  I always add black beans, chili beans and either romano or chick peas to the mix.  Always thoroughly rinse the beans.  Usually turkey stock and some canned chicken stock for more flavor.  I only use 1 can of diced tomatoes and eliminate the whole tomatoes.  Add some red chili flakes for more spice and left over turkey.  I make a huge pot and freeze in containers for work.  An easy and nutritious lunch.  Great recipe!

Great soup and easy to make.  I  cooked my chicken in a crockpot with salsa- then assembled in a stock pot.  I did not add any more salsa and halved all canned beans/corn. Did not add potatoes either.  Next day I added cooked rice to stretch it a bit. Everyone loved it.  Will make again.

SO SO GOOD! I made this not knowing what to expect and was very pleased. My friends and co-workers all asked me for a taste and then the recipe. I did eliminate the whole peeled tomatoes because I felt there was enough already, but that is just my preference. I added a little dollop of sour cream and baked tortilla strips to top it off which added a nice touch.  The only thing that I do not agree with is the time said for this recipe. It took me much longer, but that could just be me...

I made this recipe for a coworker whose husband was in the hospital. She loved it so I made it for my family and it was delicious. I made a few changes: I used 4 skinless/boneless chicken breasts cube, 1 tsp. mined garlic and 1 tsp. garlic powder, 4 tsps. chicken boullion and 1 (14oz.) can chicken broth, one can (14.5 oz.) peeled and diced tomatoes with green chilis, only 2 Tbsps. chili powder, deleted the whole peeled tomatoes, tomato soup and sour cream, used 1 (16 oz.) can chili beans undrained, added 1 (16 oz.) can black beans. I will definitely make this recipe again this winter.

Was craving this today. My fiancee and I made this when we got snowed in together during a crazy storm. I'm usually not into really spicy things- but this is DELICIOUS- and the sour cream cools it off and gives it that little extra oomph to the flavor!! :) Love it!

Made this recipe amost  exactly as it was written out. Took som advice from others about leavg out the whole tomatoes. I used extra diced tomatoes instead. I felt like the soup was missing something and wasn't even spicy. It turned out to still be edible, howeve I probably will not be making it again. :(

I halved this recipe and it still made enough for 6. I put extra sour cream. I also added a whole lot of chili pouder and it still wasn't spicy. But this was sooooooo goooooddddd. I will make this all the time! Use less broth to make it thick and use it for enchilada filling!

Easy recipe and very delicious. While soup was simmering I cut up fresh corn tortillas into strips, fried them in oil & lightly salted.  I served soup in  a bowl with a handful of homeade strips on top & avocado Yum Yum

Another yummy soup recipe from AR, which I love all the more because I always have the ingredients on hand! I use low sodium chicken broth in lieu of the water and cubes, omitted the can of whole tomatoes, added about a tsp. of cumin and a few shakes of oregano and served with tri-colored tortilla strips, shredded Mexican blend cheese and a dollop of sour cream on top. This was great with some honey cornbread on the side! We'll certainly be eating this one more often. Thanks, ANTtAFF

From what a lot of other reviews have said, this recipe sounds like it would turn out delicious "as is" without any "tweaking."  However, I did the following and was extremely happy with the results.  I realized it didn't call for any cumin (which in my opinion is a must have when it comes to this kind of dish) so I used half chili powder (1 1/2 TBS) and half cumin (1 1/2 TBS.)  Instead of regular salt I used garlic salt seasoning that was mixed with parsley.  I added a large dash of Goya Adobo seasoning (another "must have" ingredient for anything mexican/spanish.)  I used 1 (15 oz) can undrained can of mild jalapeño black beans with lime juice (EXCELLENT FLAVOR!) in place of the chili beans, 2 undrained (15 oz.) cans of mexican seasoned stewed tomatoes in place of the 2 different types of tomatoes called for, and used 1 (15 oz) tub of medium FRESH salsa.  I put all the other ingredients from the recipe into the crockpot (raw boneless chicken breasts, pepper, condensed tomato soup, chicken bouillon, onion and garlic powder) and cooked on high for about 2-3 hours, then on low for about another 4 hours.  I then simply shredded the cooked chicken and threw it back in along with a bag of frozen corn.  Added shredded mexican cheese, a dollop of sour cream and cubed avocado on top of each individual serving.  PHENOMENAL FLAVOR!!!

One of the most delicious soups I've ever tasted. I made a few changes. I made a half recipe and that was enough for ten people-plus seconds. if you make the whole batch it would feed an army. 

So this is what i did:

I used chicken broth instead of water, and i did not add the salt that the recipe calls for because the broth adds enough flavor.

i used HOT chuncky salsa (is supposed to be spicy!). I didn't bother putting in the can of whole tomoatoes (it would be a bit hard to eat) so i did the one can of diced tomatoes, plus another can of diced tomatoes in substitute of the whole tomatoes. 

instead of only using half the can of corn, i used the whole thing-why not!

bring it to a boil for about 5 minutes then let simmer for 30. this soup is fantastic!!!

This soup was so good! I put everything except the corn, sour cream and beans in the crockpot all day and just threw them in for the last hour or so. Everybody loved it and I will definitely make it again.

This soup was SO tasty. The only change I made was that I exchanged the 2 quarts of water for 2 quarts of chicken broth for a richer taste. I then combined it in the pan, but then threw it all in a 6 qt crockpot (this makes alot of soup) for 2 hours. We really didn't have a ton of it left it went so quick!! I will be passing this recipe onto people.

Wow, these ingredients are all super healthy...you've got your protein and antioxidants...low calorie too if you don't add the sour cream.  I will try one reviewer's suggestion and go buy some non fat plain yogurt.  I think the only iffy thing about the ingredients is the canned stuff with the BPA controversy, but I know I'm being nit picky.  Ok, as for taste, it's like a 4.7 stars.  I was uncertain that the flavors will come out, but the longer that I cooked it for, the stronger it became.  I ended up adding the listed amount of salt.  The corn really adds a nice sweet touch to the dish.

This was so good !  Loved it !  It was so good I am looking forward to serving to company.     I made a few revisions; (cooked the chicken in the onions and garlic); and did not use the whole peeled tomatoes or the soup.  And i used black beans instead of chili beans.   I used a "hot" green salsa - yum !

I enjoyed this soup.  Had a good flavor just was not very spicy for me.  I would make it again but would leave out the whole tomatoes and add something to make it a lot more spicy.   Was the first homemade soup I've ever made and was pleased with the results.  Was very easy to make.

I hate the ole traditional chicken soup, however I LOVE chicken. This recipe was great! A new swing to chicken soup that I will certainly make again. Just a word of warning...I used hot salsa because I worried it would lose its 'kick' while cooking. It didn't! Be sure to select your salsa wisely.

We make this often.  The leftovers are great, also!  I often tear up a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store instead of using the chicken halves.

Delicious! We loved it. I wasen't sure when I started, if it would be too spicey, but the spices are perfect. I made the tortilla chips as one of the previous reviewers said.  To the soup,  I only added half the sour cream.  Topped soup with sour cream and shredded cheese, alongside the homemade tortilla chips.

Great recipe!  Just note, this makes a LOT of soup!  Plenty for my family of four and still have leftovers to freeze!  I made it exactly as written and I thought it was perfect as is.  I like my soup a little on the creamier side so I added more sour cream at the end and topped it with shredded cheese, crushed corn chips and sliced avocado...YUMMY!

Took this to a holiday party and it was a hit.  It makes a LOT of soup!  I cooked it as instructed, but then moved portions to a slow cooker to keep it warm during the party.  I also cooked the chicken breasts from frozen and they were done in a little under an hour of simmering.   I would definitely make this again, but if I made it for just my family, would cut the recipe in half.

I picked up a cooked rotisserie chicken and shredded it to make this soup easier and quicker.  All other ingredients followed exactly except only one can of chili beans and frozen rather than canned corn.  This soup was so easy and tasted awesome!  I've got some packed for lunch tomorrow and I'm freezing some for later - this recipe makes a ton!

This turned out great! I got the full approval from the husband! I used some lime pepper in it too, and a little extra chili powder :) I made a 1/2 size version, with 2 big chicken breasts and half the canned veggies. It was great, and the whole apartment smelled like spicy chicken soup!

I accidentaly put in too much sour cream.  I doubled it actually.  The soup was such a big hit though, I can never go back to using 8 ounces.

Takes a bit of time to make but delicious soup! I cut the whole tomatoes, I didn't see the point of them next to the 2 cans of diced tomatoes, jar of salsa, and can of tomato soup. Makes A LOT! We've been eating leftovers for days...not that I'm complaining! Also good to scoop up with tortilla chips.

I'm pretty sure I made 3 new friends via this soup. It's AMAZING. I put 3 tablespoons of Siracha hot sauce in it for some extra kick.

This recipe is great & flexible. I like my soup more chunky, so I added less broth and more beans, tomatos, etc. I also used black beans instead of the beans listed. Came out great, I will definately make this again.

I do have to note that the recipe takes much longer than stated time-wise. Just keep that in mind!

by Kit-Kat This soup is good.  It's the sour cream that gives it a good taste and blends in well with all the other flavors.

Yum! Tried this recipe based off of others' reviews and it did not disappoint! I halved it and still had PLENTY (just me and my husband). I used "hot" chunky salsa, which gave it the perfect kick - nice and spicy but not too overpowering. Also left out the corn and used black beans. Very easy to make.

I boiled the cut up chicken pieces in water.  Used a carton of fat free low sodium chicken broth and fit N active tomato soup.  Left out the extra can of tomatoes and this was perfect.  Added sour cream, cheese, black olives and tortilla chips to each individual bowl.  FANTASTIC recipe!  Hubby already asking when I'm going to make it again.  LOL

I thought the soup tasted MUCH better after leaving it in the fridge for the evening. I left out the corn, sour cream and whole tomatoes. I wouldn't add as many tomatoes as the recipe calls for because between the tomato soup, salsa and diced tomatoes, there are plenty. The cheese also makes the soup that much better! I would make this again!

I cook for just my boyfriend and myself so I halved the recipe and ended up freezing half of that. This is much more like chili than soup. We are pretty health conscious so I totally left out the sour cream and it turned out delicious. I think the sour cream would have taken away from all the spicy, flavorful ingredients. Also, I wasn't crazy about the giant whole tomatoes in there so I would cut those in half before tossing them in.

This was excellent! I followed pretty much everything that the recipe called for except I didn't I only had 1 can of chili beans, so I used black beans to substitute for the other can...Also, I didn't add the sour cream. Other than that, this dish was gone in 2 days!

Was looking for a chicken soup recipe, and this was (to use a baseball phrase) a grand slam home run. I followed the recipe exactly and it was out of this world. As every cook does, I'm sure that in the future I might make changes, but as for now,I'll follow the recipe, and continue to take bows.

Delicious!!  I used vegetable broth instead of water.  I only had beef bouillon cubes.  I used 1 can of diced tomatoes.  I first sauteed the onion and garlic in the oil until soft, then added all of the other ingredients except the chicken.  I also added 1 tsp of red pepper flakes.  10 mins before serving I added packaged chicken tortellini.  Wonderful, will make this many more times and try other combinations.

Very yummy!  I only modified it a little bit.  I left out the whole tomatoes as someone else suggested, added some fresh cilantro since I LOVE it, and some spanish rice.  I put crushed tortillas chips in it as well and sprinkled some shredded cheese on top.  We will definitely be eating this soup again!!!!

This was wonderful!  Instead of adding the sour cream in the soup I added it to the top of each serving so each person could put as much as they wanted.  Topping it with avacado and chips really hit the spot!  I will be making this again for the family soon :)

Awesome soup Catherine!  I brought a big bowl into work for my lunch and as soon as it came out of the microwave I had a crowd of coworkers hovering around asking what smelled so good, gave everyone a taste and had to promise I'd make more to share next time!  I have a thing about canned foods, so I made mine with with dry pinto beans (soaked overnight), used 9 fresh roma tomatoes (boiled until the skin could be easily peeled off, then chopped), organic chicken broth instead of water, and just put it all in a crockpot (with the uncooked chicken) and let it cook on low all day (10 hours?) until the beans were tender.  At the end, I added some seasonings to taste (italian seasoning, basil, chopped fresh cilantro, and extra pepper).  Came out wonderful!  I can't wait to make another batch, think we'll freeze half and bring it with us on our next camping trip!  Enjoy!

My husband loved this soup.  I did change some of the ingredients..I added carrots and did not add the tomato soup..only the canned whole tomatoes..with tweaking the amounts and ingredients you favor..this becomes a great tasting soup.  I used 2 very large chicken breast halfs and peeled the skin off after cooking.  It makes a very large pot of soup.

I made this soup in under 30 minutes tonight. I had left over roast chicken so that cut down on the prep time. My family really loved this soup. It hit the spot on a cold snowy night.

We made a glutton free version of this by using chicken stock instead of water and bouillon cubes, a can of tomato sauce instead of condensed tomato soup, and Bush's chili starter instead of chili beans and chili powder. It was excellent! A great option for a GF meal!

I've been making a version of this for years, adding strips of roasted chilies and pinto beans. I was a little skeptical of the tomato soup, but glad I tried it, as I liked the addition. I love recipes that hold up well to variations based on individual preferences. Used boneless, skinless thighs cooked and shredded in the crockpot and added all other ingredients directly in there and simmered until we were ready to eat. My husband, 3 year-old daughter, and I are all sick with colds, and we found this a perfectly delicious twist on the old standby chicken soup.

This is my family's new favorite.. YUM! I didn't have parsley on hand so substituted 1 Tbl of Italian seasoning. I think it was a nice addition.. and the house smelled wonderful.  Will make this soup again.. and again..

I thought this was very good!  I left out the can of whole tomatoes and one tablespoon of chili powder - but it turned out very well.  Thank you!

Did not care for this at all, just way too tomato-y for me and my family.  I ended up straining the broth and making into a chicken salsa.

This soup was sooooo good.  I think I pretty much made it the way that it was originally posted (I'm always adding little extras but usually when I try a recipe for the first time I do it as written) and it was amazing!  Would recommend this to everyone.

Fabulous recipe- halved the recipe and still had PLENTY of left overs.  Great way to use my leftover rotisserie chicken!  I did like a previous reviewer recommended and left out the can of whole tomatoes and it was more than enough! Thanks for this GEM!

Never usually give anything 5 stars because I always want to try things a second time to make it better than the first. This was so good. Few things I used a can of rotel and just "eye-balled" all the seasoning to my liking. I also used taco seasoning. I simmered my chicken in the crock pot first, shredded it, then put everything in the crock pot together and cooked longer. Perfect amount of spicy, I don't like spicy food. Amazing flavors. I also halved a lot of stuff since I don't have an army to feed :) Thank you for sharing this, can't wait to make it again!

I made this recipe last night.  I'm not much of a cook, but you don't have to be with this recipe.  It did take me a little longer in the prep department than the recipe calls for.  That said however, it turned out brilliant.  My husband loved it and now I have a bunch left over to eat for the rest of the weeks lunches.  Fantastic recipe.  Thanks!

I add kidney beans and black beans to my soup for a little extra fiber and protein. I also don't use the sour cream or the whole tomatoes. I use fire roasted diced and they are delicious. Thanks so much for this recipe! My family can't get enough of this so it's a good thing it makes a lot of leftovers!

This was amazing. Everyone absolutely loved it. I followed the recipe exactly except for using only 6 chicken breasts and it was perfect! So much chicken in every bite. 6 was plenty in my opinion. It made so much, but it is phenomenal reheated as well. We crushed tortilla chips on top each time. Thank you for this recipe. I will make again and again!

This was fantastic!!  Got rave reviews from my family and was told I was making this again.  The only MINOR changes I made was using chicken broth instead of water and left out the whole peeled tomatoes.  Will absolutely make this again!

Yum!  This was fabulous! I did what the top reviewer did and added chopped chicken to the oil/garlic/onions and added the spices. Cook till chicken is cooked through and add the canned stuff.  I LOVE that it is so flexible cause I didn't have all the different stuff on hand so I added what I had and then added so taco seasoning cause I thought that the flavor was a bit off. I added some cheese to the bowls and it turned out PERFECT!  Thanks!

I loved this soup.  We topped the soup on Frito chips and cheddar cheese. I only used 4 bouillon cubes and 5 chicken breasts and I didnt add the whole canned tomatoes. I also added a can of slice olives.  I dont think my changes would made that much of a difference in taste.  But i loved this and I will make this again.

This was great!  My family loved it.  It makes a lot of soup.  I used fire roasted tomatoes and omitted the whole tomatoes.  I used salsa from the produce section of the store and I only used 6 chicken breasts which was more than enough.  Can't wait for leftovers tonight!  Will make this again!

I didn't cook the chicken as directed- I just made the broth because I already had cooked chicken, but it was still delicious! Makes A LOT, so make sure you have a crowd over. So tasty. Definitely a keeper!

Simple, healthy and tasty.  I added used smoke chipotle chili powder, 3 tbl chipotle flavored Tabasco for some extra spice, swapped out chili beans for black beans, an extra can of corn and 1 tbl of smoked chili powder.  Next time I will use fresh corn for extra sweetness.

This was delicious! After noting other reviewers' comments about it not being too spicy, I added diced jalapenos when sauteeing the onion and garlic, some red pepper flakes, and some cayenne pepper. Next time, I will omit the whole tomatoes (I don't see the point) and use hot salsa instead of medium. Thanks for a great recipe!

This has become my new go to comfort food!! We used to go for the Italian wedding soup, but my wife prefers this over that. My only changes are adding about 1 T of red pepper flakes and some cayenne, because that's the way I roll, and doing it all in 1 pot using chicken stock and boneless skinless breasts. An outstanding recipe.

Very good overall.  I eyeballed most of the seasonings and it turned out great.  8 chicken breast halves seems like a lot.  I used 5 larger perdue brand breasts and it was enough.    Also, beware, this makes a lot of soup.  Make sure you have a big enough soup pot for it.  Or, simply half the recipe.  I now have 6 frozen tupperware containers in my freezer, which should last for some time.

Really good, did not use tomato soup, used diced toms instead, I also used green salsa verde instead of regular salsa.  Served with crushed tortilla chips and sour cream on top.  A great appetizer for this dish is a 7-layer dip, that is what we did and it really tied it all together.

I didn't even bother to thaw the chicken. I just put the frozen breasts in the pot to simmer and it was fantastic. This is absolutley wonderful! Definately simmer a long time to meld the flavors. Serve with crusty bread and you have a fabulous fall evening!
1-30-10 I made this again with 2 cans chunky Rotel and 1 can diced tomatos. It was 6 stars and freezes so well to serve anytime. Everyone in my family loves this soup!

I absolutely love this recipe and my kids do too even though they are extremely picky and don't like tomatoes. however I did make some changes because of previous cooking experiences. I also left out the whole tomatoes as others did but I added a an extra can of Hunt's basil, oregano and garlic flavored diced tomatoes, I can't help it I love those diced flavored tomatoes! Instead of chili beans, I used 2 cans of pinto beans and a can of black beans, my family loves beans so we added an extra can. I also prefer frozen corn so I used that instead of the can corn but I am sure it tastes just as good either way. I used two onions instead of one because our family does enjoy our veggies. Instead of using bouillon cubes, which can make some recipes to salty, I used the 98% fat free and low sodium chicken broth. If you find the recipe not salty enough, you can always add salt to your liking, but since I love using Tony Chachere's creole seasoning which has salt in it, I didn't need to add salt. Also, I do like the chili powder flavor when added but I don't measure it, I use my eye to call it and then do a taste test. You get the hang of it after so many years of eyeballing seasoning. I don't use as much chicken, usually 6 breast halves since you are shredding the chicken anyway and 6 breast halves is still a lot of chicken in this soup, but if you want A LOT of chicken then use 8. I also use fresh parsley because I prefer the taste of fresh herbs. I have tried this recipe with and w

This soup is fabulous! I altered the recipe just a bit. As a soup lover I enjoy the juice becaue I love to add crackers. I thought that 8 chicken fillets was way too much so I just shredded 2 fillets.  The recipe called for 3 cans (total) of tomatoes and instead I just added 1 can of rotel with green chiles and I ommited the beans and corn. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. I made this soup for friends and have been asked for the recipe more then once. This is definately a winner!!!!

This was sooo good. The only problem I ran into was not having a large enough pot. Be sure to use a large stock pot. I added a little more garlic than it called for and it was perfect. I'm not one for eating the same thing twice, but I ate it for dinner and I'll eat it again for lunch today!

I try and make every recipe from this site as written and don't pay too much attention to the reviews of those that change the original.  I am so glad I stuck to that this time as well.  I can't imagine improving on this delicious soup!  This was simply delectable.  My husband and I both agree that not only is this a "keeper", but it's going in heavy rotation around here from now on.  It's also very healthy, especially if you use a light sour cream.  We like to eat healthy and it's hard to find delicious AND healthy sometimes.  Thanks so much for this welcomed addition to our recipe book!

This was awesome!!! I cooked the chicken the night before and mixed everything together and put in crock pot for a lunch and work. Everyone loved it! The only thing I would say is that you don't need the 5 cups of broth it calls for. I used all the tomatoes since I LOVE tomatoes, but just a cup or two of the broth is plenty. This makes a huge batch which is good since everyone will eat it up!!!

This is the best soup.  It freezes well, and the leftovers just get better.  I left out the garlic, tomato soup, whole tomatoes, and sour cream, and it was still delicious.  I used chicken leg quarters instead of breasts.

Delicious! I cooked this soup in a slow-cooker for 8 hours, and reduced the chicken breasts to 3, and only put about three cups of water. It turned out perfectly! SO good in fact, my boyfriend ate it at 8:30 in the morning for breakfast! He says it's the best soup I've ever made.

We love this soup!!  I did leave out the whole tomatoes but followed the recipe otherwise.  It is better if you follow the recipe for cooking the chicken as I tried it with some leftover chicken and although good, it didn't have as rich of flavor as the original.

Our family absolutely loves this soup! It has a wonderful flavor (obviously, if you aren't wild about tomatoes, either don't make it, or make it to your taste), and it's quite easy to add or subtract an ingredient if you feel like experimenting! EVERYONE who has eaten this at our house has asked for the recipe! It also makes a HUGE amount of soup. We freeze what we don't eat, and it makes a great quick meal after soccer or softball practice!  Thanks for an awesome recipe Catherine.

Sinfully tasty and rich. I cooked it all in one big pot to make it simpler. Cook chicken with olive oil, onion and garlic. Add herbs and seasonings, water and the rest EXCEPT for the beans and corn. Simmered soup for one hour and the chicken shredded like a champ. Threw in the beans and corn last. Super spicy, next time less chili powder for us and next time only 1 can of tomatoes will be fine. I agree about the sour cream. Add as desired to each serving. Yummy!

WOW! This was great! The best part about it is that I had mostly everything in my cabinet. Lets make this easier tho. Throw everything in the pot! I do not think that the soup needs all that tomato stuff (but thats just me!) I used everything but substituted the cans of peeled tomatoes, whole tomatoes and tomatoe soup for just one jar of "CALDO DE TOMATE" by Knorr. I used about a handful. You can add as much flavor as you like. I also used Rotel tomatoes. For the Finishing touch, when I made my bowl I crushed fritos and added shredded cheese! OMG talk about good! I think all those cans of tomatoes would have been way to much for my taste. You can even add Creole and sauted (sp?) mushrooms!

Only used 3 chicken breasts, used half chicken broth and half water instead of 2 qts water, did not use whole tomatoes, did not add chili powder, and did not add beans. Kept everything else the same and was voted the best soup at our office soup/chowder/stew cook-off (people usually go for the chowder so this was an accomplishment). cooked and shredded the chicken first then cooked everything else together in a slow cooker over night on medium and kept on low the next morning until lunch time.

My sister-in-law and I made this. By accident, we boiled the chicken for the whole hour instead of simmering it. But, because of it, the chicken was beyond juicy and insanely flavorful! 
We loved the way the chicken tasted so much that later we used the first step as a base for homemade chicken noodle soup. All of the kids loved both dishes and devoured the leftovers!
Much liked recipe!!

I made this for the first time tonight. We all loved it! I served it with cornbread. I didn't add the whole tomatoes and I only used about 4 cups of the broth. I also didn't need 8 chicken breasts but this will depend on the size of the breasts. Next time I think I will add some carrots. Very tasty, especially when it is cold.

I'm not so sure about this one.  I had high hopes because of all the great reviews but it turned out just average for us.  I think with most soups if you add cheese, sour cream and fritos or tortilla chips to the top it greatly improves the flavor.  I was looking for a healthier type of soup and without all the extras on top this just didn't cut it.  I will not be making this one again.

Best soup ever! I omitted the whole peeled tomatoes and used petite diced tomatoes instead of the regular sized since my family hates tomatoes. Every one had empty bowls and smiles on their faces after dinner. =) Thanks for sharing this EXCELLENT recipe. We will be making this for years to come. Rhiannon

love this recipe!  A delious soup.  so hearty and a nice alternative to chili.  served with fritos and shredded cheese.  really fantastic!  Oh, I used crushed tomatoes instead of the can of whole tomatoes as I do not like whole tomatoes.  Also, I plan to add extra beans and another can of corn the next time I make it.  YUMMY!

this is one of the best soups, ever! simmered all day on the stove. i didn't change a thing except cooking the chicken prior and using chicken stock instead of bouillon cubes and omitting the onions because we don't really care for them. 10 stars if i could. will be making this again for sure. thanks catherine ;)

Very good! I made a whole chicken for dinner for my husband and I the evening before, saved the extra meat and boiled the carcas with carrots, celery, fresh thyme and a bay leaf for 5 hours and used the resulting broth and extra meat in the soup. I used only 1/2 of the tomato soup and one less boulion cube and omitted the salt. The canned tomatoes and salsa all have lots of salt as do the boullion cubes and season the soup perfectly. I will certainly make this again.

So delicious. The only thing I did different was added Rotel instead of salsa because I didn't have any and made it in the crockpot. Turned out great! I halved the recipe and we had plenty for the four of us and some left overs for the next day. What a treat. I'll be keeping this recipe around, that's for sure!

Very delicious! I made some minor changes for the sake of purer, fresher flavors. Instead of jarred salsa, I added the ingredients of salsa - extra tomatoes and onion, diced jalapeno and chopped cilantro. And instead of condensed tomato soup (which contains high-fructose corn syrup) I used a small can of tomato paste. And instead of chili powder I used chipotle powder, and frozen corn instead of canned. Topped with shredded cheddar/pepper jack and broke tortilla chips into it - fantastic! This recipe makes a LOT of soup. I made it in my 5-quart dutch oven, but then had to pull out another pot and transer some because it wouldn't all fit in the 5-quart. Now I just hope it freezes well.

Absolutely wonderful soup!  Complex flavors, yet so ridiculously easy to make.  How can it be so good?!?! 

Like others, I reduced the chili pepper substantially.  I am a baby when it comes to spicy heat, so I reduced from 3T to 1T, and that was the perfect temp for me.  I think that few people would truly enjoy the intense heat of 3T.  

I serve with a chunky lime wedge, as I fnid that fresh lime or lemon juice squeezed just before eating brightens the flavors. 

I've made this vegetarian and it's great that way.  Enjoy!!

Very, very good!  I omitted the parsley, and tomato soup.  Also substituted can of diced chili and tomato for plain diced and used one can of chili seasoned diced tomatoes.  Used one can kidney beans.  I omitted any sauteing of onions and just threw it all in the Crock-pot for 8 hrs on low.  Added frozen corn for the last few minutes.  Made my own tortilla strips too.  Too hot for the kids but husband LOVED IT!

Excellent soup. I didn't have regular chilli beans but used the Bush Grilling Beans (Texas Ranchero) for that extra kick. Super hit with wifey dear, a bit spicy for the kids.

I made this pretty much as the recipe states, only I have to puree all the tomatoes because of one family members dislike of chunky tomatoes. I also pureed the salsa for the same reason.(I started pureeing the tomatoes because of this one person but now I've found I like the texture it gives to the soups, chilis, and stews, etc. less watery and more creamy.) I also added about a half tsp of celery salt and 1 tsp. Mexican Oregano. I't's simmering now and tastes fantastic already even without adding the chicken back in or the sour cream. May just serve the SC on the side this time to see if it add or detracts from the flavors in the soup. Thanks for the recipe.

This soup was wonderful!  I have several chicken chili/soup recipes, and I didn't think this one would be that different.  I was wrong.   My kids even liked it.  The sour cream may be what makes this so good.

Great recipe.  Thank you!  The only thing I did differently was I used about 3.5 lbs of boneless/skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts for taste/cost reasons.  I'm happy to add this recipe to my folder.  It is very very good.

Awesome, hearty soup.  I used black beans instead of chili beans and put the ingredients in my slow cooker.  Had just the right amount of "kick" and great flavor.

This soup is delicious!  I've made it numerous times and everyone I've shared it with loves it too.  After reading other reviews I too made some changes.  I leave out the can of whole peeled tomatoes, replace 1/2 a can of tomato soup with 1/2 can of enchilada sauce, use frozen corn, and add an extra tablespoon of chili powder (and sometimes a little cayenne, I like things spicy).  The first time I made it I simmered the chicken for the listed time and it was way too long, my chicken turned out dry and it left very little broth.  Just keep an eye on it and pull it off when the chicken is no longer pink.  I also accidentally used cream cheese instead of sour cream and it was quite good, made it a little more creamy and thick.  Using different varieties of salsa also changes things up a bit, my favorite I've used was a chipotle one.  Regardless of the these little changes the soup is great!!

I was just reading through recipes to find something to make for dinner and stumbled across this. I happened to have all the ingredients so I gave it a try. It was a hit! Everyone in the house loved it and told me to keep it in the rotation. Very delicious, flavorful, and filling.

My family is HOOKED!!! The soup is excellent as is but i made a few changes. I boil chicken in about 4 cups of water then remove chicken and shred. I put the cubes in the water then add the chicken back in. I got a containter of Pico De Gallo at my grocery store in the produce section and used that. SO MUCH BETTER THAN SALSA!!  I use three cans of corn because i like corn. I will use any sort of tomatoe i have around whether canned or from the garden. I eyeball all of the spices. I used garlic, hot chili powder, and salt and pepper. The Pico de Gallo has jalepenos and cilantro in it for more kick too. I like this soup so much because you can use whatever you like or whatever you have in the pantry and it will always turn out great. My kids can never wait on it to simmer for hours so they eat it as soon as it's warm. I let it just sit on the stove for awhile then later i'll take it off to cool and keep some in fridge and freezer. Freezes well. This wil always be a staple in our menu. So far i have given the recipe to more than a dozen people.

This  is delicious!  I added a can of drained  black beans and a can of Santa Fe chile beans (undrained), and used one can of corn, which gave this recipe the right amount of sweetness to complement the awesome flavor of the spices.  I ground my own chicken in the Mini Cuisenart using chicken tenders, and we loved the texture and taste.  Thanks for posting this!!

LOVE this soup.  I used spicy salsa and a tad more chili powder and it gave the soup quite a kick!  I would serve this soup to anybody and be proud.  It freezes very well too.

This was very good.  We were somewhere in between just liking it and loving it.  It wasn't spicy to us at all!  I was hesitant about using tomato soup in this, but I actually found this recipe to try and use up some tomato soup, and it was surprisingly good in this soup -- those who are hesitant don't be afraid to try it!  I halved the recipe but went ahead and used the whole can of soup.  I also used some chicken I'd already cooked and shredded, so I skipped the whole chicken/broth stage and just threw everything in the crockpot.  I skipped the corn (hubby doesn't like corn in soup... don't ask me why!), but I added some lentils to thicken/bulk out the soup.  We each stirred our own sour cream and some cheese into it at the end.  All in all, a very good taco soup.  I think on it's own it would be a 3-4 star soup, but with the crushed tortilla chips, some cheese, and sour cream it really is tasty!

I make soup or stew for my darling daughter at least once a week and this recipe ranks top of her list. Here's the changes I've made to suit my 20 month olds taste. I use ground chicken, reduce the garlic to 1 clove and use low fat sour cream. I omit the tomato soup altogether.

This is 5 stars exactly as written.  I did use 5 cups of chicken stock instead of water/bullion to bring down the sodium.  I also prefer shredding the chicken as stated in the recipe because it fits the other textures in the soup.  Not sure about the suggestion of leaving out the Chili beans, Whole Tomatoes and sour cream for calorie/fat savings.   Typically, Chili beans have about 10 more calories (no fat difference) per 1/2 cup than black or other beans and the flavor the chili beans adds is worth it.  For calorie savings use Reduced Fat (360 calories for 8oz divided by 8 huge servings) or Fat Free (if you must - calories are usually the same as Reduced, only fat grams drop from 3.5 to 0) sour cream and the whole tomatoes are nothing but nutritious.   The real calorie/fat saver without diminishing taste/flavor, texture and style of this soup would be to omit the 3 Tbsp of olive oil (between 300-360 calories) and use 3 sprays (0 calories) olive oil spray.  I've always been a fan of dropping the calories/fat where it has the least impact on the taste.

This is really great, and very forgiving....I didn’t have any chili beans, so I used kidney beans….I didn’t want whole tomatoes in there, so I used one can of black beans….I didn’t have garlic powder (who doesn’t have garlic powder?) so I used minced…I used light sour cream, I think I used parsley flakes instead of dried parsley..that sort of clumped up, but you just stir it...I am going to try it with green chilis in it too and tone down the salsa a bit....I will make this a lot this winter!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

I had half of a large batch of chicken fajita filling that I made the night before that I added to this soup, eliminating the cooking chicken in water step. I did add a little more spice, like cumin, oregano, paprika, and coriander only because I thought the soup could use something other than just heat. Adding the tomato soup added a little sweetness, something I would have never come up with on my own. Next time, I'll take some of the other reviewer's advice and saute the chicken and vegetables in EVOO before adding the rest of the ingredients. It'll add more flavor. I think I'd leave out the chicken bouillion, as it made it a little salty. Otherwise, great idea for a soup. Serving it with just a bit of shredded monterey jack and sour cream made it really shine. NOTE: This is also good with pork.

I made it twice. The second time I cut the chicken into bite size pieces instead of shredding it. It was easier and I thought better. I also used 4 chicken breasts instead of 8 and there was still plenty of chicken in the soup. I also substituted whole tomatoes with diced.(personal preference) This is the best soup I've had so far on this website!

Great, hearty, spicy soup.  I would have given it 5 stars, but I have to agree with other reviewers about the tomatoes called for in the recipe.  I ommitted the second can of diced tomatoes and the can of whole tomatoes.  I would also reduce the amount of soup, but my husband thought it was fine.  Do be careful, this soup is spicy.  My husband and I love hot foods- our favorite recipe includes habanero peppers- and this soup was perfect for us, so it may be too much to take for those who prefer milder dishes.

This was good. If you want to make it better, healthier and quicker, here's what you do:
1.Make it a one-pot-dish and buy an already made chicken, preferably a rotisserie. Sautee the ingredients that need to be sauteed first, add other ingredients, and add the chicken and spices last.
2. Omit the whole tomatoes. They just don't make sense.
3. If you like it spicy, which this dish is NOT really originally add chayenne pepper to taste. 1 tsp should be perfect.
4. Add cumin seed ground- 1 tablespoon for some extra flavor.
5. Substitute the sour cream for some fat free sour cream, or to make it really healthy plain fat free yogurt- but you risk changing the taste with yogurt. Go for the fat free sour cream if you don't want to chance it-and add it LAST. Reserve some for the top along with shredded cheese.
6.Don't let it taste like enchilada filling-thats just not a good taste for a soup to have. CHUNK the chicken, don't shred it.
8. Add black beans instead of chili beans-they are so much healthier- and rinse thouroughly. Everyone knows the starches on the beans just don't taste good. To make it more of a 'chili' add kidney, black AND white beans. 3 cans won't be too much especially if you spiced it up with chayenne pepper.
9. To spice it up even more get the diced tomatoes WITH jalapenos or green peppers. Jalapenos are good for the metabolism but bad for the weak-stomached or heartburn prone.
10. Go with the crusty bread- or even better, put it in a sourdough bread boule.

First, this recipe calls for WAY too much chicken.  I used 3 breasts which I boiled and shredded and fed 8 people.  This would have been too tomato-y with the can of whole tomatoes.. They're just not necessary with all the other tom's in this soup.  Very delicious and not TOO spicy.

I just made this for the 2nd time and this soup is absolutely delicious! The best part is that this recipe makes a TON of soup, so it is a wonderful thing to have the leftovers in the fridge for a quick meal or snack. Made it with 9 chicken breasts instead of 8 (since they may come 3 to a pack at the grocery store) made it extra hearty- a meal in itself- thanks!

Great recipe!  I made a few changes - I omitted the whole tomatoes, used the 2 tbsp of chili powder mentioned in some reviews, only used one can of chili beans because I forgot to buy two, and I also added some fresh zucchini that I had to use up.  Even with all of my adjustments, it still was an excellent soup - the whole family loved it!

This soup was really good.  I halved the recipe and still had a huge pot full.  I also left out the whole tomatoes.  It was a perfect dinner for a cold night.

This was the best soup that I have ever made.  My husband and I fought over the last of the soup for our lunch.  I HIGHLY recommend this to everyone to try.  I did however use only 3 chicken breasts and 2 tablespoons of chili powder like someone else recomended.

This very delicious! I put it in the crock pot while hubby was surfing in the afternoon. It made the house smell so good and tasted great. I omitted the tomatos and added kidney beans instead. Served over tortilla chips with cheese. Made a wonderful dinner and we are going to have it again tonight. ~ Thanks

MMMMM! Made this for lunch today and it was wonderful! I made a few modifications due to personal preference. I halved the recipe,  but felt 2 chicken breast halves were plenty. I used diced tomatoes with green chilies and left out the whole tomatoes entirely. I substituted light red kidney beans for the chili beans. The corn I had on hand was the kind with peppers and it was delicious. I ended up with 4 cups of stock, so I used 2 cups in the soup and put the remaining 2 in the freezer for another use! Hubby was so happy to come home for lunch and have this waiting for him. We're having it again tomorrow! I think we'll try shredded cheese and a dollop of sour cream on top.

If you like spicy food then this is the best spicy chicken soup you will ever had. I did change a couple things,I added Cumin, used medium salsa, pureed garlic, mixed beans, and also added hot pepper flakes, I also halved the recipe, which still came out with lots, filled the pot. Very yummy! Next time I think I might not half it and keep some leftovers, but I'll have to buy a bigger pot. This was gobbled up in no time.

This makes a ton but I am glad as I get to freeze and enjoy this soup many times over.  I used frozen corn and added 2 fresh chopped jalapenos and left out the whole peeled tomatoes-I used a fresh cored and peeled one instead (I just put a whole tomato in the broth for two minutes while simmering, took it out and the skin peeled of easily).  I also used the diced tomatoes with chilies and added a lot more spices to suit our tastes such as Tabasco sauce, celery salt, and red pepper flakes.  To serve, I garnished with chopped green onions and a 4 mexican shredded cheese blend.  It was delicious.  Gotta go, my mouth is watering and I'll think I'll reach for one of my frozen containers of this soup!

Like many other reviewers, I use a little less chicken, fewer tomatoes, brown rice (not instant), low-fat sour cream and a can each of kidney & black beans. This is an amazing recipe. I think you can modify just about any way you like and it will still be wonderful. Bravo, Catherine, and thank you!!

I used some other suggestions that were previously mentioned..i upped the garlic to 4 cloves, only one large tin of crushed tomatoes, no whole ones..an I also did add corn or kidney beans but rather put in brn rice..used my homemade salsa - very fresh.  added chili powder towards the end lil by lil till my husband would still eat it..omitted salt, enough with cannned tomato soup an oxo cubes..bought a rotisserie chicken an deskinned it..much lazier but end results were totally narly!!

I loved it and better yet so did my family!! a definite keeper! like many I added my twists on it, like fresh tomatoes instead of canned, black beans and pinto beans w chili beans, also omitted soup and used tomato sauce seasoned with chili powder and cumin. I also used my favorite salsa a peach pineapple from safeway select, yum!and low sodium chix bouillon. then threw it all in the slow cooker to simmer all day.

I made this for my bible study group and everyone said," You can bring this soup any time!"  Great recipe!  I did use V8 in place of the tomato soup but other than that I did it exactly like the recipe.

OH MY GOSH!!!!  AMAZING!!!  All 6 (4 kids) of us ate it up like crazy!  I changed almost NOTHING - Lightly sauteed onion & garlic, then browned meat slightly ( I like the flavor better) then added the broth & stuff from first paragraph.  AFter an hour, I removed chicken, shredded it and added the rest of the stuff ( except sour cream, let everyone put a dollop on their soup).  I added a dash of smoked paprika also, as that is a fav in our house.
 DH LOVED this and said it was hearty (soup isn't normally enough for him, so I make him a little something extra - he didn't even touch it tonight!!!)  Thanks AUNTTAF!

This makes a  LOT of soup so there's plenty for leftovers.  This soup is wonderful; it's easy and uses general pantry ingredients that can also be easily substituted for others one may have on hand.

To speed things up a bit I used a whole store-bought rotisserie chicken that I chopped up in the processor.  I skipped the can of whole tomatos but added: 

1 large can of chopped green chilies (Sam's Choice)
1 teaspoon cumin
2 tablspoons fresh parsley
1 tablespoon dried cilantro

I also used boxed, no sodium added chicken broth instead of boullion cubes/water, black beans instead of chili beans, frozen corn instead of canned, and reduced fat sour cream.

This recipe's a keeper.  DH LOVED it!

Just okay. Tasted like chili with chicken...not "spicy". Will not be making again.

Amazing soup. The whole family loved it. I added chick peas, a jalapeno pepper and some cayenne pepper to make up for the omission of the salsa which I did not have on hand. Used a whole chicken and made the stock from scratch. I'm so glad to have found this recipe which will be a family favorite for the years to come.

This was good, but not spicy enough.  Next time I make it, I will use a can of rotel tomatoes.  I only used 5 chicken breast, which was enough.  I added extra garlic and black pepper.

Excellent, but the recipe yields a LOT of soup -- too much for my large slowcooker!  Would suggest halving.  I added extra beans.  The sour cream is definitely worth adding.

This recipe is a good basis for a chicken soup/chili. But made as is - I found it rather bland and missing some necessary spices. Certainly not worthy of the 5-star rating so many other great recipes on this site have been afforded.

One of the best meals I've ever made! Served it for a family dinner and everyone raved & raved about how good it was. The only thing I changed was to use some "salsa style fire roasted tomatoes" in place of the salsa (we have a ton of stock, thanks to an obsessed family member ;). The soup got better and better each day we had it for leftovers, too.

SUPER GOOD Soup!!! Made it for a ladies meeting and everyone raved about it! Only added one can of tomatoes and one can of chili beans. I followed another suggestion to saute onions/garlic then chop up chicken breast and saute til done. Then add everything else and heat through. I used my own chicken broth which I freeze after boiling chicken. Always keep some on hand!

This is a great soup!  It's not that spicy though so I added a can of Rotel tomatoes and left out the can of whole tomatoes.  Also added some cumin for flavor.  Cook this longer than 30 mins for sure cook down and thicken up a bit.

Great recipe. I used a roasted chicken from the supermarket and shredded it. Then used a good chicken stock as the base which replaced the first part of the recipe.

Absolutely fantastic!  Slight changes: 2 cans of corn, 2 cans of black beans, no whole tomatoes, no tomato soup, no sour cream.  I brought this to my very critical mother-in-law's house and she asked for seconds!  The whole family loved this.

This was delicious! I didn't have salsa so I just omitted it and added more seasoning. I also didn't have sour cream and don't feel like I missed out. I added a bit of cayenne powder to kick it up a notch and I used kidney and black beans. Also I doubled the veggie content and used a mixed of frozen veggies instead of canned corn. I also made rice for the family to add as they wished. Oh and I make my own chicken broth using the carcass from a store bought rotisserie.

This is by far my favorite recipe off this site, and probably my favorite thing I've ever made! This is so easy and like another post said, very flexible. I changed some things, but just to simplify. I used reduced sodium Swanson chicken broth instead of boullion cubes. I sauteed my chicken breasts with onion and garlic until they were just cooked, then added them to the broth and boiled for about 20 minutes, then shredded the chicken. I followed the rest of the recipe as it reads and it is soooooo good!!

WONDERFUL! I am still new to making homemade soup, and this was an easy, delicious recipe! I used 6 large chicken breast halves and there was a TON of chicken- I might use 4 or 5 next time.  I substituted black beans and small kidney beans for the chili beans, and used Medium salsa.  (I don't enjoy foods that are very spicy, and this was perfect for me. My boyfriend loves spicy and he absolutely loved it as well)  I started to worry when I added the sour cream, as the color was much different than all of the pictures submitted on the page, but it darkened after simmering.  SO happy I tried this- definitely a keeper! Thanks so much!

This soup is really good and really easy.  I felt a little weird about the amount of tomatoes going in, but it turned out really well.  I left one can of tomatoes out and added a fresh red bell pepper to the onion/garlic mix.  I also served it with fresh avocado on top and it was amazing.  It also makes tons of servings, so if you have a big family or you are a single person who likes to cook a big dish for yourself to eat throughout the week....this one is great!

It was good.  I guess I just felt like it was to tomato-y.  I don't really like Chicken in a strong tomato base, but I did like the broth that this makes before it goes into the soup.

Oh, so definately 5 stars!!!  This one will become a staple.  My husband said it was probably the best soup he'd ever had -- I added kielbasa along with the chicken and kidney and black beans for the chili beans that I didn't have.  It turned out beautifully.  I did cook the chicken breasts in chicken broth instead of water and eliminated the need for boullion.  I really try not to make any changes to recipes the first time around and only did so this time to avoid a trip to the grocery.  None the less, we could not have been happier.  Thanks, Catherine, really great soup.

Unlike the review below, I think it is well worth the 5 star rating.  I did everything except for adding salt.  I mean extra salt with 5 cubes of bouillon?? No need for that if you ask me.  Makes a ton of soup too.  A little spicy for my wife, but I did use HOT salsa.  ALSO, this recipe takes closer 2 HOURS to prepare and cook unlike what the recipe states at the top of the page - just read the directions and you'll see what I mean.  My wife's devil horns were starting to surface after an hour and a half when I originally said, "Yeah baby, just 45 minutes and we'll be eating".  She wasn't that happy about the time error, but the soup's awesome flavor made up for it!  This is a keeper for sho!

I love to make homemade soup and after finding this recipe and all the 5 star ratings it had recieved I figured it had to be out of this world.  I followed the recipe excatly. It was a good soup but nothing what I was expecting after reading all the rave reviews.  I will make it again, it was very yummy but there are better soup recipes out there.  Anyhow, thanks for sharing!

Ok, I've made this twice already and we can't get enough of it. It even tastes better the next day as far as I'm concerned. 
I made it the second time with intentions of giving some away since it makes quite a bit for just the two of us but......we ate it all instead.

This is definitely a 5 star soup-even though I did make some changes. I cut the beans portion in half, as we don't care for them too much. Next time I think I may use the same amount of beans, but black beans. Anywho, I added 1 tablespoon of Siracha hot sauce plus 2 tablespoons of chili powder instead of just the three tablespoons of chili powder. I also omitted the sour cream altogether. I do also think next time I will add another can of corn to take place of the one lacking can of beans. It is a great soup, and only gets better the next few days in the fridge! Thanks so much for the recipe!!!

This was an excellent soup and I would love to try it again when I have a lot of people to feed. It almost tasted like a taco soup with all the chili pepper in it. I did put a lot more chicken in it and it turned out perfect.

I halved the recipe, shredded leftover rotisserie chicken and used 4 cups of chicken stock instead.  It was amazing, leftovers were amazing.

So good! I doubled the amount of diced tomatoes and just left out the whole. To make it easier, I cut the chicken up first and boiled it along with everything else. You don't have to wait as long for it to cook this way.

I used canned chicken to really cut down on cooking time! And chicken stock instead of water and bouillon cube. FANTASTIC quick dinner!! Makes great left overs too :)

My girlfriend really liked this. I think it was okay, tasted like chicken chili to me. I followed the recipe and didn't change anything. But next time I would use diced tomatoes only instead of the whole ones. The whole ones are big and don't melt in the pot. This makes a huge amount, so  use a large pot.

A great base soup to make your own.  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs, varied the seasonings a bit using what I had on hand, and it was great.  Like another user, I made it a one pot meal.  Chopped the veggies and chicken and sauteed them in one pot.  Added the rest of the ingredients and simmered.

This reminded me of something my mom used to make when I was in high school, and thats the only reason it got four stars. tastes pretty generic, but it's a nice recipe to cut in half and throw together if you need a quick dinner.

Delicious, healthy, and easy! I halved the recipe using the calculator, followed the recipe with these slight changes: substituted 1 qt chicken stock for the water and bouillon cubes, used 1 whole medium onion, 1 bag frozen southwest corn for the canned corn. For the tomatoes, I used 1 can of fire roasted tomatoes, 1 can ro-tel, and the entire can of tomato soup. Like other reviewers, I serve the sour cream on the side. Halved, this recipe makes at least 10 servings, which is great because the leftovers are even better the next day. Ran this through the WW recipe builder and for 12 servings this recipe is 3 points. Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

Really good. I leave out the whole tomatoes and use black beans instead of chili beans. Just a personal preference.

THis was pretty good - I liked the flavor.  Could have a bit more spice/hotness - but that's an easy fix and personal preference!

I left out the tomato soup and the whole tomatoes and one can of beans. (One can of beans was all I had in the house) I did thicken the soup with some masa.  Although I didn't miss the tomatoes, the correct amount of beans would have been better.

My husband, who hates chicken, had three big bowls of this soup tonight!  He has declared this the only way he will eat chicken from now on.    I'll probably cut this recipe in half next time and only use 2 chicken breasts.  As is, it makes a TON - definitely more than 8 servings, in my opinion.

Absolutely delicious!  Definitely one of the best soups I've made.  I made a few revisions because I didn't have all of the ingredients - I didn't have tomato soup, so used a can of tomato paste instead, frozen corn instead of canned, an extra can of diced tomatoes instead of the whole tomatoes, and used chicken broth instead of chicken bouillon.  I didn't use sour cream and used black beans instead of the chili beans.  I let it simmer for a couple of hours and it was absolutely fabulous!

EXCELLENT! I make a few modifications, I use less chicken (there is PLENTY of meat with 4-6 breasts) and I add several chopped carrots when I sautee the onion. I throw in a bit of crushed red pepper flakes and use fresh salsa rather than jar salsa. I use 2 cans of diced tomatoes and no whole tomatoes. I also leave out the chili beans and the sour cream. People can top it if desired. I make this in HUGE batched to freeze extars and it has been a hit with everyone who tries it.

I thiought this was very tasty. It makes a TON though so you may want to halve the recipe. I did think there were too many tomatoes in it so I would cut back on those next time. It had a great flavor and I used chicken broth in place of the water/bouillon.

This is, by far, one of the most popular dishes I make.  It's easy to make it large batches and everybody loves it.  I go through the effort of cooking & shredding the chicken myself, which I think makes a big difference in the texture of the soup.  It has become a winter staple in our house, and it is great for leftovers.

Not too bad, for a soup made mostly from canned goods.  Make sure not to boil the soup after adding sour cream-it may curdle.  Also, for the measurement-challenged like me, 2 quarts water=8 cups.

I wish that I could give this more than five stars.  I used my slow cooker for this instead of the stove and I only used four chicken breasts, didn't use the whole tomato, added green chilis and used black beans instead of chili beans but those are all just personal taste changes.  It did end up being more than my slow cooker could handle so I think I will have to adjust the amount next time.  This is absolutely on the rotation now at our house!

this soup definitely beats the canned chicken tortilla soup that i usually buy. the portions are very hefty and it will fill u up. i cut the recipe in half and i made the following changes based on user reviews and because i forgot some things at the store: only used 2 chicken breasts and thought it was more than enough meat, omitted the salt, instead of the jar of salsa i used a container of diced tomatoes, green peppers, and onions from the grocery store, omitted the cans of tomatoes and instead doubled the amount of tomato soup (might add some fresh tomatoes next time too), used frozen corn, canned chili beans in medium sauce, and low fat sour cream- couldn't taste the difference, but i wouldn't recommend omitting the sour cream altogether. served with shredded cheese and corn tortilla chips. this was the first time i've ever made soup and i was pretty impressed with how it came out-perfect amount of flavor and spice. my only complaint is that it tasted too salty to me-especially with the tortilla chips-even though i used reduced sodium tomato soup. i think next time i will use reduced sodium bouillon cubes and/or make fresh beans.

This is a great recipe for those cold nights.  The only thing I do differently is let it simmer in the crock pot for about 6 hours on low.  It is DEEEEE-LLLLISSSSH!

I took this to a soup putlock and it was all gone and sadly the others were not.  Everyone asked for the recipe and I could not lie so I told them where to find it.  I will be making this again when the weather cools off!Update: I just tried this in the slow cooker and it was so easy.  I used chicken stock and all the spices, tomatoes, salsa and tomato soup, and put in 2 frozen chicken breast for a half recipe.  I turned it on low for 6 hours.  When it was done I shredded the chicken and put it back in, added the beans and corn and let it heat through.  So great and so easy and so much food.  I leave out the sour cream becasue of allergies, but I'm sure it would be good with it too.  Try it in the slow cooker, it is so much easier.

This was so yummy! My husband and son went back for seconds. I changed the prep and seasoning a bit, but I will definitely make this one again. I served this with Golden Sweet Cornbread from this site.

sounds good but it's equal to 10 Weight watchers points which makes me wonder why it's in the Healthy recipes section when one serving would be half my daily intake.

I'm not a soup lover, but this was AWESOME! Just a couple of changes: I used a 12 oz bag of frozen corn, and just one 28 oz can of crushed San Marzano tomatoes (they're the best!). Served it topped with Mexican blend cheese, blue corn chips, sour cream, and chopped avocado. 

I liked the flavor the broth gave to the chicken so I started making my chicken for quesadillas this way!

The beauty of this soup is that because of its versatility, if you have a decent pantry, you will have a variation of most of the ingredients on hand.  I read a lot of the reviews, and being from Arizona, wanted to add some serious heat.  If you like heat, I would suggest these modifications.  Broth -- didn't change a thing.  I saved the leftovers and could just drink the broth, cooked the chicken perfectly.  Used frozen chicken tenderloins.  Used 2 small cans of runny Mexican salsa and a can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce.  Omitted the can of whole tomatoes.  For tomates -- used one can of diced tomatoes with garlic and onion, and two cans of Rotel.  Added dash of cayenne.  For beans, used one can chili and one can black beans.  Served with these help yourself add ons:  heated up tortilla chips, sliced black olives, shredded cheese, and dollop of sour cream.  Much better than most chicken tortilla soups and a heck of a lot spicer.  Would open up your sinuses if you had a cold.  Kudos to Catherine!

This soup is delicious. I omitted the sour cream and just added it to each individual bowl. I also put some shredded cheese, fresh cilantro and some cubed avocado to each bowl!

Excellent!  The package of boneless chicken I bought only had 3 large breasts, but I thought it was plenty. Still used same amount of water and boullion with chicken. Able to fit into my 5 quart dutch oven, however I did omit the corn, chili beans and sour cream.  Decreased chili powder to 1.5 tablespoons (personal preference). Thickened slightly w/ cornstarch and water mixture.  Added a little rice to each bowl prior to serving. Yummy!

Exceptional!  I did not shred the chicken, I cooked it seperate and cubed it. Then used better than buillion for the stock.  Everything else as recipe stated.  I will serve to guests this winter.  My husband raved!  And our 7 year old ate bowls and bowls.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Really good. I only witheld that last star because I thought it needed 2 cans of corn and a little cayenne pepper. I'm also a little confused about the whole tomatoes.

I loved how easy this was to prepare and how very filling it is. I did have to add a bit more chili powder, but other than that, it was perfect.

Very good!  I altered the recipe a little because I halved it.  I used chicken broth instead of water and boullion, too.  I added the whole can of tomato soup even though I halved it and omitted the whole tomatoes.  I used mild salsa but added a few spoonfuls of chopped canned jalapenos.  And I used drained pinto beans instead of chili beans.  Excellent!

this is a good recipe for soup...great flavor....filling.  However I would say it is more than the 8 servings it described.  I would say it was at least 16 servings.  I would reccomend it !!!!

This was good and I will make it again, but in my opinion, 3 TBS chili powder plus 16 oz. of salsa is WAY too spicy. I used the salsa and only 1 TBS chili powder, and it still had quite a zip to it. I used some leftover rotisserie chicken and threw everything in the crock pot on Low for 8 hours. Next time we will add tortilla chips and make it like a chicken tortilla soup.

My pan ended up being smaller than I thought (oops) so I added one can of diced tomatoes, one can of beans (drained- I only eat them that way), the can of tomato soup and the jar of salsa.  I then poured on about three cups of the broth.  I let it simmer for an hour, meaniwhile deciding it needed some paprika and cumin and WOW!!  I mixed in a dollop of sour cream at the end along with a bit of shredded cheese and served with cornbread.  This is a keeper- it's delicious and makes enough for my boyfriend and I to eat for a few days!

This soup is fabulous! I made a couple changes as well...I didn't simmer the chicken for an hour...only until cooked through, about 15 minutes. I then strained the broth through cheese cloth. I only used about 6 breasts, I added a can of black beans, used chili hot breans, 2 cups fresh medinm heat salsa, no whole tomatoes and no canned soup. I did use 3 T of chili powder and instead of stirring in sour cream, I had some fat free half and half, so I stirred in about 1/2-3/4 cup. I added in more than 5 cups of the broth also.....might as well make a huge pot, right? I used a 16 oz bag of frozen corn, not canned....I had cilantro on hand so I added a good handful of that too. After it was all put together and up to heat, I stuck the pot into a 185 degree oven for the afternoon...served it with shredded mexican blend cheese and sour cream for granish and corn bread....it was out of this world!!
I think it will feed 10-12 people easy.

I loved this dish.  I didn't use the sour cream to cut down on some calories. I used 3 chicken breasts instead of eight and I added diced carrots along with a can of black and red beans for some extra fiber and it was still delicious.  In fact, I'm making it again right now!!!!

This is a very good soup, will definately make this again. I only wish I had more sour cream so I could have topped the soup bowel with a spoonful. I loved the sour cream, it made this soup so good. Thanks for the great recipe Catherine.

I also halved this. The single thing that I left out was tomato soup, since it was the one thing I didn't have on hand. I kept thinking that I should go to the store for it but procrastinated. Now that we've been eating it, it's hard to imagine what difference it would have made. I'm use to putting a dollop of sour cream on chili even at Wendy's which is how I did it here rather than mix it in.  Really, really tasty!

Thank you Catherine for the absolute best soup I have ever made!  My family couldn't stop eating it, or raving about it.  Words can't describe the rich, full flavor of this dish.  The taste and texture are complex, multi-layered and interesting from the first bite to the last.  Even my six year old loved it -- and she hates everything!!!

Very good.  I made the following modifications.  Used turkey stock from Christmas turkey instead of boiling chicken in bouillon.  Reduced amount of chicken to 4 breasts, diced, and sauteed in herbs.  Replaced one of the cans of chili beans with a can of black beans.  Used frozen rather than canned corn.  Cooked it in my slow cooker all day long.  It smelled fabulous and everyone who had some seemed to like it.  Thanks!

Ummm,ummm good! I cut all the ingredients in half and it still made a ton of soup! I used 2 cans rotel tomatoes instead of regular diced, and it gave it a nice kick. Simmered it in the crock pot all day....tastes better each time I go back for another cup!!

So good!  I forgot to add the sour cream, and it was great without it!  Will add some to individual bowls to try it.  I only used 3 large breasts, but think I will up it to 4 next time and that should be plenty.  I made some changes to make it a little healthier and to only use one pot. Boiled the chicken for an hour with only two bullion cubes, it created a nice stock.  Removed chicken to cool, and added remaining ingredients (minus the oil) to stock.  Subbed a can of diced tomatoes with chilies for the can of whole tomatoes.  Left out the tomato soup, added an extra can of corn, and subbed black beans for chili beans.  Also added some red pepper to taste, I like spicy.  Simmered that for a half hour while the chicken cooled and I shredded it, added the chicken back and I had a great big pot of delicious, healthy soup.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

I went with everyone else - leave out the whole tomatoes. It doesn't need it.
If I could give this more than 5 stars I would!  It was a hit and VERY easy to make...You have plenty to share which is good, because everyone wants some!

YUM! I made this for an employee potluck dinner and got lots of compliment...there was none left. I think I might try it with okra as well next time. Oh, and I also added some cilantro, which tasted great.

This soup was a hit at our church
gathering for "Souper Bowl 2005" where
we had a contest for the best soup. I
took home the prize. I made it exactly
as the recipe stated. I didn't think it
was too spicy. It was just right. Liked
the fact that it made a lot of soup.

THANKS FOR THE RECIPE-THIS IS AWESOME!  MADE NO CHANGES.  I have made this now several times.  You can make it more or less spicy by using mild salsa/mild chili beans or hot salsa and the hot chili beans.  It's great either way!

what's really great about this recipe is that it uses things you probably already have in your pantry. i was looking for a crock pot soup when i found this recipe.  i did cook the chicken in the crock(on low for several hours)but ended up finishing on the stove...it was too much for the crockpot.  i used my 8qt stock pot and it wasn't too big.  my chicken was so tender from the crock that it melted in the mouth AND in the pot...next time i will not shred but cube it instead.  i'm bad about tweaking a recipe and i had planned on dropping a dollop of the sour cream on top of the soup for "presentation".  i followed the directions instead and was glad.   the sour cream really rounds out the flavor.  i also added a little cubed avocado to each bowl...maybe a tablespoon or so.  this makes 8 hearty portions.  serve with your favorite cornbread.

Delicious soup, however, it really isn't that spicy. Used black beans instead of chili beans, doubled the corn and just used all the water in the pot. This made a ton. We have eaten on this for two days and the pot is still full so it is going in the freezer. Think this would be great with leftover turkey as well. Used sour cream in the soup as well as topped each bowl with a dollop. Also sprinkled on some chopped fresh cilantro.

When it all comes together, it didn't fit in my dutch oven (5 1/2 Q I think). The taste is just wrong. The only help for it was to add a lot of heavy whipping cream.

As per the recipe by LASVEGAS00, I made mine in the crock pot. I halved the recipe and made the following adjustments: "Minus olive oil, corn and beans, threw everything in my crockpot (chicken breasts whole) and set on low for 8 hours. Last 2 hours, I removed chicken breasts to shred (didn't take much as they fell apart from being in the juices), added chicken meat back in, 1 can of black beans (rinsed and drained), and the corn." However, I did forget to add the corn, black beans, and chilli powder until I had eaten one bowl of this deliciousness. It was great without it too. After I added them in, I decided I actually preferred the flavor without the chili powder. Next time I will leave it out altogether.

This soup was very spicy when I made it. I put the full 16 oz. of sour cream though. Also, I added around 2 tbsp on hot sauce, a fourth of a cup of maple syrup, around a tbsp of cinnamon, 2 tbsp of seedless strawberry jelly, and 1 tbsp of honey mustard.

Loved this soup. Fantastic flavor and easy to adjust recipe if you don't have all ingredients (no salsa). Have made two big pots now and have given the excess to co-workers, they loved it and wanted the recipe too. This will be my Chicken soup recipe from now on.

Excellent soup! I have been looking for a tortilla soup for a long time and this one is by far the best! If need be you could take out the meat and make it a vegetarian meal or just use it without meat if you do not have any chicken in the house. All of the ingredients are pantry staples which makes this meal easy and delicious!

This is a delicious and easy-to-make recipe.  For a less spicy, but still flavorful soup, I swapped 2 tbsp of chili powder for 2 tbsp of cumin.  I also squeezed in the juice from 2 small limes.

This recipe was excellent!  Made some tortilla chips as another reviewer suggested, did without the whole tomatoes, added a small zucchini, and put a small dollup of sour cream on top rather than mixing in the container, to save on calories.  It was excellent!  Will definitely make this again and again!  Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

Best soup recipe ever for using leftover chicken. This recipe is so versatile that you can easily adapt to your own tastes. I made half this recipe and it was still a very big pot of soup....enough for 6 people.

My family loves this recipe; however, I have changed a few things over the past year of using it. 
I'm a big Trader Joes shopper so I modified it so I don't have to go to a 'regular' store...all ingredients are from TJs... I boil 4 breasts and shred, add to that broth an additional 2 boxes of chicken broth, a tub of precut veggie mix (celery, carrots, onions), 1 can of black beans drained ( omit chili beans) , 2 large  cans of diced tomatoes drained ( in place of whole tomatos and t -sauce, 1 bag of frozen sweet corn. I use all of the suggested seasoning and sour cream. Absolutely delicious ! For gatherings of folks who love it super-duper spicy - and to the recipe's seasoning list 1 packet of Trader Joes Taco Seasoning! I serve this with a side of TJ's cornbread (box mix)! All delicious and healthy, too!

Wow, fantastic!! Of course like lots of others I customized it to fit what our family likes. We don't like tomato or onion chunks so I substituted granulated onion for chopped onion. So I then I pressed the garlic into the simmering chicken and strained the broth before adding it to the other pot. I also omitted all 3 cans of tomatoes but added extra tomato soup and pureed salsa (since I can them in fall) to compensate for the weight given of how much tomatoes I omitted. Superb flavor! Thanks so much, we did enjoy!!

Great base recipe.  Serve with melted cheese and tortilla chips. I added fresh jalapeno to the garlic and onion mix, as well as lots of black pepper.  While you simmer it towards the end keep adding what you want to make it taste good.  I used Frank's Red hot as well to add flavor and thickness.

So tasty!!! I made this for myself, my mother and sister for dinner tonight. Both my mother and sister left nothing more than a drop in their bowls. The soup turned out being a little more spicier than I had anticipated or aimed for, but that was entirely my goof... I accidentally added 3 tbsp of cayenne pepper mistaking it for chili powder! I'm such a klutz. Oh well. I went ahead and added a bit of chili powder anyway, figuring what the heck after I realized my mistake. I was a little worried, but the soup turned out delicious! Maybe it had a little bit more of a kick than it needed, but still, delicious. I'll definitely make this again. Though, I think I'll replace the can of whole tomatoes with another can of diced tomatoes. I just found the whole tomatoes to be in the way and wished I had more tomatoes to spoon up in each bite. And I'll be sure to leave the cayenne pepper out next time and double check the label for chili powder. Hah! Also, I should mention that I followed the advice of others and left the shredded cheese and sour cream until the end to use as a sort of topping. I can't wait to make this again! So tasty.

Oh my goodness!!!! This soup is amazing! I made this to take for a fellowship lunch. It was so good I had to go buy more ingredients to make another pot (the first pot never made it past my family). I highly recommend it! The only change I made was that I left out the whole tomatoes, and added a can of Rotel in its place. Excellent recipe. Thanks for sharing.

Wonderful soup!  I took other reviewers advice and substituted a can of Rotel for the can of whole peeled tomatoes. If you like spicy, I suggest you do this! I also did not add the sour cream as I knew I would be freezing a good portion of this recipe. I only had 5 breasts on hand, and it was more than enough chicken!  Enjoy! A keeper!!!

Love this soup.  Have made it twice now and it has turned out great both times. Used hotter salsa the second time since that is where the heat comes from and wanted it a bit hotter.  Have made it with and without sour cream in it and it was great both times.

Amazing recipe and very versatile.  Loved that I did not have to cut chicken before cooking.  Left out beans b/c DH does not enjoy and this was a huge hit.  Definitely 5 star!

Delicious!! I was worried it may be too spicy so only did 1.5 tablespoons of chili powder. Also, husband doesn't like too many chunks of tomatoes or onions (lame!) so I did only one can of tomatoes, two cans of tomato soup and used Lipton's onion dry soup mix (and dry onion flakes because I didn't have onion powder)... still gave the flavor without my husband having to bite into a chunk of onion. Also put 2 cans of black beans instead of the chili to make it healthier. Topped with avocado made this yummy soup even better!! 
I followed someone else's advice to make the cooking easier: Cut chicken into bite size pieces, boiled in (I did a little over 2 qts of water because I actually cooked 6 full chicken breasts) water for 20 minutes then added all the rest of the ingredients and simmered for an hour. Made a lot, nice to put in baggies and freeze to pull out for later!

I love love love this soup. I don't use 8 breasts (I did the first time). I also leave out the corn--just a personal preference. I only use the diced tomatoes. Otherwise, I follow the recipe. It freezes GREAT. I put single servings in a ziplock and put those in a large freezer bag. Tip: use the paddle attachment on your stand mixer to shred the chicken....works like a charm!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

What a flavorful, tasty soup! My husband mentioned how much he liked it about 3 times :) I made a few changes to suit our tastes: I omitted the salt (the bouillon cubes have quite a bit as it is) and the sour cream, just because I didn't feel like they were necessary. I also omitted the onion, just because we're not huge fans of onions. I substituted one can of diced tomatoes for a can of Rotel to give it a kick (and boy it did!) and instead of whole tomatoes I used crushed (I just prefer the texture). I used frozen corn rather than canned (I think it tastes more fresh) and substituted a can of drained, rinsed black beans for one of the cans of chili beans. I made the soup the day before we ate it, so that the flavors could combine and it would be even more delicious. It ended up being quite spicy, but we loved it!

Also, just a tip: if you have a Kitchen Aid mixture, use the paddle attachment to shred chicken perfectly! I just added the (hot) chicken breasts to the mixing bowl (no liquid needed) and used the mixer for about 20-30 seconds. Couldn't be easier :)

This recipe was unbelieveable.  What a hearty meal with lots of chicken.  My entire family rated it a 5 star.  I made a few changes:  I used hot chunky salsa.  I substituted 2 cans of petite diced tomatos with zesty jalapeno for the peeled and diced tomatos.  I also used a can of diced tomatos with onion and pepper in place of the whole peeled tomatos.

This soup was absolutely AMAZING! I made mine exactly like the recipe and it was so delicious. It was hearty and flavorful. There are four adults in our household and my sister's boyfriend stopped by and everyone thought it was better than soup you have out at your favorite restaurant. Plus, it made sooooo much soup that we have plenty of leftovers (which are even better the next day!)

Excellent!  I made a few changes because I wanted to use what I had on hand.  First I used black beans instead of chili beans, then 1-14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes and 1-14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes w/green chilis, and a packet of Mc Cormicks hot chili seasoning along with all the other herbs and spices the recipe calls for.  This is tasty and spicy-definitley a 5 star soup!  A dinner to look forward to-thank you Catherine.

This is the very first recipe that i've ever reviewed, but i had to bc this soup is FABULOUS!! I followed the recipe to a 'T' other than decreasing the chili powder to 1.5 tbs due to the fact that one of my children hates spicy food. Kids ate with tortilla chips and loved it! Will definitely be part of our meal rotation!! Thank you!

Love this soup! I added canned corn instead of peas since my husband hates them. I turned out delicious! Would definitely do it again ;)

Awesome and easy to make! Everyone that I have made this for loves it! I have tried it with canned and fresh tomatoes...for some reason, the canned has a lot more flavor.

This is delicious! Can't wait until my husband gets home to try it. Add some tortilla chips and maybe a little shredded cheese and we are all set. 

I think my husband will say that it's not spicy enough but since our 4 yr old daughter would not appreciate it if I kicked it up...it is perfect the way it is.

I think there is enough that I will be freezing some.

Very tasty! I love how easy it is to make as well. Wonderful, filling, and warming on a chilly fall night. The only thing I did differently was I left out the whole tomatoes (didn't feel it added anything to the recipe) and used hunt's diced tomatoes with green peppers and onions instead of normal diced tomatoes. It made tasty left overs the next day! We will definitely be making this recipe again!

Cut back on the chili powder (I love spicy but my husband does not), substituted 1 can of black beans for the chili beans, used frozen corn, and cooked the chicken with the onion to save a pan.  This is delicious!

a little heavy on the tomato, otherwise very good. I would add green and jalapeno peppers as well. The cook time is also misleading. Unless you already have cooked the chicken, add 1 hour to cook time.

This was excellent! I have made this a few times, once I even added some leftover rice, and it's always great. Some sour cream, shredded cheese, and crunched tortilla chips makes it perfect!

Good flavor but we did not just love it..  This soup has what I call a "southwestern" flair which I normally love.  For Crock Pot convenience, I tweaked the recipe just a bit.  I shredded a whole rotisserie chicken and added only 4 cups of (purchased) chicken broth.   I did not add the bouillon cubes because I thought the canned broth would be stronger than broth from chicken breasts as recommended.   However, I think next time, I will keep it in there.  Though I did saute the onions and garlic as directed, I really think it would taste the same if I had just thrown that in the pot with the rest of the ingredients, minus the oil, of course. For the sour cream, I used fat-free but I'm not sure what any sour cream does for it.  Finally, because I think most soups taste even better the next day, I put the crock pot full of soup in the refrigerator overnight and the next day, cooked it on low for 10 hours so it would be ready when we got home from work. I can't say I loved this soup but I think it is worth making again and  tweaking just a bit more to suit our tastes. BTW, this makes a lot of soup!

One of the best soup recipes I've ever made. My family LOVED it!  The only additional thing I added was one additional can of corn and a little cilantro.  I also put tortilla chips in it before serving.

My husband really enjoyed this. I liked it as well. He said next time I make this I need to add rice. Also I didn't shread the chicken. I cut it up in cubes before cooking it.

Not sure what I missing.  I thought this soup was actually pretty bland.  I made it exactly as stated and was totally less than impressed.  It wasn't bad, by any means, but nothing very exciting ... So much so that I didn't even want to eat the leftovers and I never have a problem with eating the same dish the next day.  My husband liked it, though, said that it was better the next day and he actually liked it.  I would have rated it a 2 and my husband would have rated it a 4, so I'm giving it 3 stars.  NOTE: This makes a very large batch of soup -- More like 12+ servings, if you ask me.

This was AWESOME! I didnt have the can of soup or the whole tomatoes and it was still amazing! the soup probably would have added a little more flavor but it was still great. It made a HUGE pot and got devoured in one day when i brought it to my moms. Next time I wont be sharing!!

excellent soup!  Very easy to make and a real crowd pleaser.  I followed just as written but substituted frozen corn.  I also topped with 1/4" strips of baked corn tortillas, a very nice addition to a perfect soup!

This is restaurant quality soup.  After boiling the chicken I put everything (except sour cream) in the crockpot and cooked for 5 hrs.  Excellent!  I halved the recipe but it still makes a lot so I will be freezing individual portions.

I made this just as it was written, except that I left out the onions (I didn't have any :( ) and I THOUGHT I had a can of tomato soup, but what I actually had was tomato bisque...but I tossed it in anyway. I don't think either of those would have made a huge difference in the taste. We all loved it here...similar to a chili flavor. My kids despise chicken chili with white beans...this was more their kind of soup. My son had leftover soup for a bedtime snack :) I will definitely make this one again and again!

If I could add more stars, this recipe would rate an absolute 10! I've always loved soup recipes and enjoy trying new spices and flavors...this recipe is warming, flavorful and delicious!  I was lucky to have ingredients on hand so I didn't have to eliminate anything, but I did add a can of spicy V8 to give it a little extra zest(awesome) Add or omit as you choose, the foundation of this soup is great so you can't go wrong

Wow! This is SO good.  I only used 4 chicken breasts because the kind you can get at Costco are normally really large.  It made the perfect amount.  I didn't use onion powder because I didn't have any.  I also only had about 8 oz of salsa, so I just used what I had.  Instead of a condensed can of tomato soup I used the organic Pacific brand of Roasted Red Pepper Tomato Soup (I filled one of the empty cans of tomatoes with the soup and it was the perfect amount). It was PERFECT!  I did add some salt at the end because I felt it needed just a tad more.  I didn't use chili beans because I didn't have any.  Instead I used kidney beans but think that black beans would work really well too.  The sour cream at the end is genius.  I normally just add it on top of other soups that I've made that are similar, but I love that it's added in.  The whole tomatoes are great!  Don't leave those out, like others have suggested.  It gives the soup more bulk!  They only thing I think I may add next time is some fresh chopped cilantro.  Great soup!  I will definitely be making again!

Wonderful recipe!  I made this when my daughter had a cold, and she and my husband added tobasco sauce to theirs.  So now her nose isn't stuffy!  I added a dollop of sour cream to my bowl-so good!

I been looking for a good tortilla soup and I came across this one and this was the EXACT SOUP MY TASTE BUDS WANTED!  I love this soup!  I have made it over 5 times since I found the recipe 3 months ago.  I did skip the sour cream in the soup, I add it to my personal bowl if I feel like it, but it is superb without it.  I don't add the can of whole tomatoes, I just add another can of diced tomatoes, I really love tomatoes so the more the merrier.  I also only use two chicken breasts because that is enough chicken for me.  I also usually use all the water from the boiled chickens not just 5 cups.  One more thing I add is one to two small cans of green chilies, I have had the soup with them and without them and it is good both ways, I just like green chilies.  I freeze a bunch of it and it's the same goodness from when u first make it!

Excellent recipe, my family and friends all loved it. I went with the unaltered recipe. I wouldn't tweak it a bit from the original, at least not yet.   I was a little suspicious at first since it didn't look as good as I would have liked but all doubts vanished as soon as I tasted it.  The base recipe made a huge amount of soup which I froze and reheated later. It came back from the freezer great, just as good as before it went in.

There are so many ingredients I almost changed my mind about making this one...glad I didn't!  It's fantastic.  I thought a jar of salsa was wierd, but it all comes together in the end.  It was great with some tortillas and cheddar cheese on top.  One hint though if you want to freeze your leftovers...don't add the sour cream into the pot.  Put a dollop on a bowl.  I added it into the pot and when I froze/defrosted, there were little speckles of sour cream floating in it.  Still tasted great but looked funny.  Thanks for the recipe!!

My new favorite soup!  Very tasty. I added a little more of the spices but that was to suit our tastes.  The only thing I will do different is add only one can of diced tomatoes which I will change to petite diced and leave out the other cans.  It was tomato overload with the three cans and there are tomatoes in the salsa.  I also followed the advice of cooking the garlic and onions first then adding everything else.  Also instead of chili beans, I added black beans.  The sour cream in the soup is a nice touch.  To me that's what makes this soup stand out.  Warmed tortillas to dip adds the finishing touch.

Wow! This soup was delicious - talk about 'Kicking it up a notch'!  What a great break from the same 'ole soups.  I did not have all ingredients on hand so I improvised a little; adding a big squeeze of Catsup in place of the Tomato soup and leaving out the whole tomatoes and adding only 2 Tbs. of Chili powder.  Regardless, the flavor was fantastic and my 7 year old loved it too! This will definitely be added to my favorites!

Really very good! My husband was less impressed (thus the 4, not 5). Will make again, but with some personal preference changes. I agree that half the tomatoes would be sufficient. I think you could easily add extra corn, chili beans, or even green beans. Will definitely stand up to personalization!

I don't typically comment on recipes, though I get quite a few from this site on a regular basis.  This is an incredibly easy and wicked good recipe!  My rendition was probably a little higher fat because I used what I had on hand, however, I can imagine it would taste just as good with the low fat options.  The things I changed a bit:  I used a whole cut up chicken instead of breasts (I think the bones help add flavor to the stock), skipped the whole peeled tomatoes and substitued a can of Rotel instead, and I used frozen corn in place of canned (I am not a fan of squishy corn).  Otherwise I stuck to the recipe - EXCELLENT JOB AUNTTAF - it was a HOME RUN with the family!  This one is a keeper and going into the weekly rotation! :)

This was phenomenal and very versatile.  I made a lot of changes based on what I have on hand and wouldn't normally review unless I followed the recipe strictly but since I only have good things to say...

I added fat free yogurt instead of sour cream, added celery, used leftover turkey, used chick peas instead of chili beans.  I also followed the advice from the "most helpful" review in terms of starting with the garlic and onion, adding the chopped turkey, then spices, then canned items and water.

I made this the other night with leftover Thanksgiving turkey.  It was delicious!  I made it on Saturday, then put it in my slow cooker on Sunday for a few hours.  We had about 10 adults over after church and there was even some leftover.  I omitted the whole peeled tomatoes and instead of fresh garlic I used the minced kind in the fridge.  I put the shredded cheese and sour cream on the side.  You can't go wrong with this recipe!  Oh, and it's not too spicy especially for someone as sensitive as me.  I plan to make some more and freeze it in small batches to eat over the next couple of months.  Definitely a keeper.

I've made this recipe COUNTLESS times, all with great success!  Variation can come from the type of beans to the type of salsa used.  I recommend medium southwest type salsa & getting a mixed blend of beans.  I always let the recipe warm in the crock pot over night to let the spices settle into the chicken - always a hit with the family!

***UPDATED - this soup is a staple in our house now.  If I don't make it at least once a month and have a bowl or two frozen for a quick lunch, my husband will ask, "Isn't it time to make some Catherine's?"

Absolutely delicious! I only made minor changes to the original recipe.  I omitted the can of whole peeled tomatoes, used frozen corn instead of canned, and tempered down the heat by using 2 tblsp of chilli powder instead of 3.  This is a must try!!  I will make it again and again!

I skipped the can of whole tomatoes, onion, and onion powder, and used frozen corn instead of canned. I also added some sauteed minced garlic and a can of green chilies. Topped it with sour cream, monterey jack, tortilla strips and diced avocado! This is so delicious and freezes well!

Simply an awesome soup!  Some changes I had made were adding fresh minced garlic to the boiling water.  I also added 1 can black beans, undrained, 1 can dark red kidney beans, undrained and reduced the chili powder to 2 and a half tablespoons and added about a tablespoon of cumin.  Instead of the whole tomatoes I just added 3 cans diced.  Next time I plan on using frozen corn.

Great winter soup recipe. A great twist on tortilla or chicken taco soup. I will say I did make some adjustments: used chicken broth instead of the water and chicken bouillon cubes, left out the tomato soup and chili beans, didn't saute the onions and garlic...just added all the ingredients to the slow cooker and cooked it all for 6 hours. This was a family winner!!

Very good, whole family loved it.  Used 6 chicken breasts instead of 8.  Didn't use 14.5 ounce can whole peeled tomatoes. Used 1 19 oz. can black beans.
Thanks, Michele, Cambridge, Ontario

Excellent! I made it exactly by the recipe, and the soup turned out phenomenal! I am actually proud of myself for how well it came out!

I recommend cooking the chicken in the water to make the broth and adding the sour cream to the soup while cooking. These things really add to the rich quality. The sour cream will not be overbearing. Instead it will add just the right color and favor to the soup (believe me--I am not a fan of sour cream). I shredded the chicken with the help of a vegetable peeler, and the process took only a minute or two.

We all loved this!!  Well, except for my 14 yr old son who has a thing against tomatoes.  And since I have a thing against beans I omitted those.  This was fairly easy to make and such a wonderful comfort soup for a cold Michigan night!  Will make this a regular on my rotation!!

I made this recipe for an after-Christmas dinner get together. I was originally going take a shortcut by cutting up the chicken and just adding it into one pot with all the other items. Had I done that, the chicken would have been dried out and tasteless.  However, I did not do that, it this soup/meal came out excellent! I useed 1 can of white hominy and 1 can of black beans instead of the chili beans. On the second day, we put tortilla chips in the bowl before adding the soup and sliced avocado on top of the soup. This is one recipe I will do again!

This soup is great on the first day straight out the pot, but its absolutley delicious on the second and third! I cut the recipe in half because I just wanted to get an idea of how it would taste, but I shouldnt have because now Im mad its all gone. The only thing I did different than the recipe was taking out the can of whole tomotoes, the one can of diced and the tomoatoes from the salsa were plenty for me.

After reviewing other inputs, I made the following changes to make this even easier and time saving.  I began by cooking the onion and garlic in olive oil until slightly browned.  I then added all the mentioned seasonings, 16 oz. jar med. chunky salsa, 2 cups frozen corn, 14.5 can petite diced tomatoes, 28 oz. can crushed tomatoes, 1 can chili beans, 1 can black beans, 5 cups chicken stock and 2 13 oz. cans chicken breast meat which I shredded.  I simmered for 30 minutes and served with roasted garlic bread.  We thoroughly enjoyed this meal!  It's a keeper!

The only thing I changed about this recipe was to cook it in the crockpot.  I didn't even consider that the liquid in the recipe would not evaporate from a crockpot like it would on the stove top, so my soup ended up too watery.  If I make it again I will either do it on the stove top as the recipe calls for or, if I make it in the crockpot again, I will reduce the water.  I have a 7-quart crockpot, which I think is the largest size available, and all the ingredients did not fit.  I ended up leaving out part of the chicken, but there was still more than enough chicken. I used medium-hot salsa, but I think I would go with hot if I make it again. In my opinion, the best thing about this recipe is it makes enough to feed my husband and me and to give some away and/or freeze some.

A delicious change from "regular" chicken soup.  I've already made this twice and shared recipe with family who also gave it 5 stars.  Ingredient list looked complicated but it is super easy and readily available in most pantries. Only 3 changes:  I use about 3 *large* chicken breast halves (plenty); add 4 oz. can diced green chili peppers; dollop sour cream on each serving as opposed to stirring into soup pot.  Easy, tasty cold weather fare.

I thought this was just OK.  I'm kind of stumped at all of the 5-star ratings.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, but used fresh chopped tomatoes and corn instead of canned.  It was kind of bland and did not have *nearly* enough salt, even for my husband who doesn't like a lot.  This could partially be my fault, because I didn't account for the fact that canned vegetables probably have more sodium and needed less salt in the original recipe.  So if you use fresh veggies, you may need to add salt.  It was definitely spicy, but just enough.  If I make this again, I will use chicken breast w/ bone to make a more flavorful stock as well as some cumin in the soup.  Mexican shredded cheese and tortilla chips go well with this.

Update: Awesome when recipe is followed exactly (canned veggies instead of fresh).

This is a very tasty soup. I made it slightly differently, with less salsa, tomato paste instead of soup, fresh corn instead of canned, black beans instead of chili.  I also cooked the chicken ahead of time, since it was easier that way.  Everyone in my family loved this soup!

My 19 year old son and 3 friends inhaled the entire pot of soup in one sitting.  I don't think they had time to breathe!  I did have a taste while it was cooking.  Yummy and not to spicy for us.

Soooooooooooo delicious!!!  I couldn't stop eating it. My husband even made it, following the recipe of course, and it was still perfect!  Very fresh, very healthy, and tastes exactly like you're at a fancy restaurant.  Needs one more can of corn though!

I couln't have enjoyed this more!  I used black beans instead of chili beans and I only used 2/3 the chili powder (and it was spicy enough!)  I made so much that I froze half of it.  The half that I didn't freeze only lasted a day and a half just between my husband, 2 yr old and me.  It was great!  We'll be having it again!!!

Yum!  This soup is awesome!  I used 1 can chicken broth & the rest water w/bouillon cubes then added the spices & frozen chicken tenders. I brought to a boil and cooked until chicken was cooked (about 30 minute). Then I removed chicken and cut it up. I emptied the pan then added back in 5 cups of the broth, chicken and all the rest of the ingredients. Also I didn't have canned tomato soup so I just used crushed tomatoes and tomato paste. I also added some canned green chiles. I had everything on hand to make this and it was ready in about an hour. I added shredded cheese & crumbled tortilla chips on top. I love it, my husband thinks it's ok.  I will definitely make again!

Excellent! My entire family loved it. I left out the whole tomatoes and added extra tomato sauce rather than condensed tomato soup. I ran out of sour cream and was only able to add about 1/4C., but it was still an awesome recipe! Makes enough for 2 meals.

What can I say? Absolutely FANTASTIC!!!  We love this recipe and will make it again and again!!  Only difference I did was to use a whole chicken instead of chicken breast halves - it was a little more work, but worth it cause we love that dark meat!

Wow!  What a soup!  It came out a little too spicy for my taste -- but this is fixable.  Use mild salsa, no chili powder, and chili beans that are not hot.  I think the first 8 ingredients simmered together looked (and smelled) fantastic.  I plan to do step one, add egg noodles, and enjoy it as a soup without the rest of the stuff!   Enjoy!
2nd review: Still love this recipe! I use the sour cream only as a topping because I prefer the soup to be more like chili and less like a cream-based soup. I use the full two quarts of broth (not just five cups) - and find it is hearty and flavorful.

Turned out really well! I followed "Can't cook-can eat"'s review suggestions. I omitted any stock, just added some water, to make it a thicker soup. Very quick meal to prepare, just what I need!

Delicious!  I used 5 chicken breasts, so decreased the broth to about 3 cups and left out one can diced tomatoes.  It was a little too spicy for the kids, so I ended up sending half of it over to my mom's.  I will make this again!!

This is a great find!  My guests loved it and all asked for seconds! I served it with basil pesto bread and a dollop of sour cream on top.  Was good reheated the next day for lunch, too. I'll definately be making this again. Thanks for sharing it.

I love this soup! Im a beginner in cooking so I followed the recipe exactly. It came out so good and it makes so much that you have alot of leftovers. I brought some to work and everyone was shocked that I actually made it. Even my niece liked it and she's very picky.

I scaled the recipe in half, simmered the carcass of a rotisserie chicken for the meat & broth, sauteed garlic, onion & celery  before adding 14.5 oz can tomatoes w/ gr chilies and 15 oz can black beans, cup salsa and box froz mixed veg (bec didn't have just corn), 5 cups of broth, 1 T chili powder, 1 t chipotle chili powder, 1/4 t ground red pepper.  I thought it was a bit watery so I took the cover off and simmered for an extra 20 mins until a bit thicker.  Delicious!

This was awesome!  I halved the recipe, and used 1 can diced tomatoes, and 1 can Rotel instead of the tomatoes that are called for.  Turned out fabulous!  Topped with some crushed tortilla chips, cheddar cheese, and green onions.  Yummy!

I used frozen bulk chicken breasts,there were 7 breasts to the package 3 pounds.I put the frozen chicken into the soup pot with water and other ingredients called for, plus I added 1/4 tsp hot red pepper flakes. After bring it to a boil I let it simmer for 2 1/2 hours till chicken was tender..I followed most of the recipe except I omitted the 14.5 oz whole tomatoes. And added 1-15oz can drained black beans and another 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes to the  soup..When I served up the soup I crushed tortilla chips on top with shredded cheddar cheese..This is difinitely a winter time soup..We loved it..I was afraid it called for too much chicken but it turned out fine..Highly recommend this recipe if you like mexican spice...Thank U for a great soup recipe..

Really Yummy! I halved the recipe and only used 3 half breasts and it was still ALOT of chicken. Oh my! I will use even less next time. The sour cream makes the soup creamy and delicious.

This soup was great.  I served it with the southwestern egg rolls on this site and it was a lovely meal.  It makes a TON of soup though. I gave some away, froze some, ate some and still have a lot left over!  Thanks!

Very Good!  I only made a few changes, first I halved the recipe.  I used black beans instead of chili beans and I tossed in a whole onion so I could get the flavor without the onion pieces. I left out the salsa since I have little ones.  This soup was great and went really well with Southwestern Egg rolls from this site!

My guy is calling this one of my best soups - I've been on a soup kick this year.  It is realtively easy to make.  This should be called Catherine's Spicy Tomato/Chicken Soup.  It called for a lot of tomatoes so I should have expected it to taste tomatoey - but it didn't.  It does make a ton of soup I cut it in half and it still fed 8.  Thanks Catherine.

This is the best soup ever.  I think that I'm addicted to it.  Perfect just the way it is.  Every mouthful has some chicken in it.  Gotta run now time to make another pot full.

This recipe was fantastic! Even my fiance who will not eat soup liked it and asked for it again!  I'd rather have this than a burrito anyday, although I omitted whole tomatoes and the beans.

This soup is fantastic!  I only used 5 chicken breasts and omitted the can of whole tomatoes.  But it was still great, maybe add some more beans next time.  Great with crushed tortilla chips on top and a side of cheese quesadillas!

My family and I really liked this recipe! I did however think it was overkill on the tomatoes. Next time I would not add the stewed tomatoes and half the salsa. I also used spicy chili beans, medium salsa and medium chili powder and WOW was it spicy! I think I'll watch that next time. Instead of adding all of the sour cream we chose to add it to our individual bowls.

I've made this soup 4 times now and its always a big hit with company.  I've never added the full amount of chicken, always about 4-5 decent sized chix breast, and its not missed.  The soup has a great flavor and is very hearty, especially after adding the chips and cheese.  Thanks Catherine!!

This soup was PHENOMENAL!  I used spicy salsa, and therefore didn't add the full amount of chili powder.  Other than that, I stuck with the recipe exactly.  After tasting this, my new boyfriend raved to his family about what a good cook I am--now I have to keep up that image!  Thank goodness I have the help of allrecipies.com!

I was so happy with this recipe!  I didn't have corn so omitted it.  I did follow another reviewer's advice and added cumin.   For garnish; chopped cilantro,parsely and green onion with shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  I can't wait to make this again, thank you Catherine!

Great recipe! My picky husband loved it! To make it a quicker meal instead of boiling the chicken breasts I grilled them and subtistuted tinned chicken broth for the bouillion and broth that would have been created by boiling! Only drawback this recipe makes ALOT! I scaled it to 4 servings but still ended up with enough to provide 8 servings!

This was an excellent soup!  The sour cream is a must.  I substituted diced tomatoes for the can of whole tomatoes.  I boiled a whole chicken instead of using boneless chicken, thus making my own chicken stock.

This was so good!  I also used 2 T. chili powder and 1 T. cumin.  I only used 2 cans of diced tomatoes, doubled the amount of garlic, used chicken base instead of bouillon cubes.  Used Ranch Style Beans with Jalepenos and used 7 cups of broth.  It has the greatest flavor.  Will definitely make again.

This soup was fantastic!  First of all, I halved the recipe.  Then, instead of using chicken parts, I just used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, fried them up in a pan with some parsley, garlic, cayenne pepper, salt and pepper, and chopped them.  That way, I eliminated the wait!  For the chicken stock, I just used some Knorr's chicken stock powder and water (to make 5 cups).  For the chili-style beans, I added a can of chili-style pinto and kidney beans, which tasted great!  I also added a can of green chilies, and a diced tomato, but I eliminated the can of whole tomatoes.  My boyfriend raved that it tasted like taco soup!  We will make this recipe often!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!!

I just finished my last cup of this soup and I already miss eating it. It's so hearty and satisfying, even on a hot 90 degree day! I made my own chicken stock flavored with bay leaves, and I think that made it taste even better! I also added shredded cheese on each bowl of soup, and it just melts right in. YUM!!!

Great recipe! I made just few changes though: I added celery leaves and two chilies in the pot while bringing the chicken to a boil. I also added chopped celery and carrots in the tomato sauce and seasoned with thyme, seasoning, basil, bay leaves and parsley, as I didn't have corn, chili beans and sour cream. It came out great!!! Next time I will try again with the correct ingredients.

This made a huge pot of soup!  I used my biggest pot and it barely fit.  :)  It made a lot of leftovers, but we've been enjoying them greatly.  

I didn't put the sour cream in with the soup, but put it on top like others did.  I used black beans instead of chili beans.  Also doubled corn as other suggested.  We also found that it wasn't quite spicy enough and added Tabasco.

Delicious! I left out the whole tomatoes (there was already enough tomato for my taste, and I love tomatoes). I also omitted the chili powder, as my children don't like too spicy. (Turns out they didn't like it anyway, so I'm going to use the chili powder next time.) I used about 6 pieces of leftover chicken, using the bones to make the broth and shredding the chicken in the food processor. I also used about 3/4 of a jar of hot salsa, and put sour cream on top of each bowl instead of in the soup. This recipe reminds me of a much more delicious taco soup. Hubby and I both loved it, and I like the versatility. I'm an experiment cooker, so it was nice to be able to add and remove ingredients based on my family's tastes.

Awesome soup! I have an awful cold today and this hit the spot. I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned. I also substitute a stick of cream cheese for the sour cream. It made a huge pot of soup. I am freezing 1/2 to eat another night.

I made this for dinner one night and my son keeps asking for it again! This was good...I used mild Salsa. My husband (who's always right about these things) says to add Tabasco for 5/5.

This was really good. I used a little less that the two quarts of water and did not include diced tomatoes in part based on what I had on hand. I also used a  whole split fryer and prepared it in a crock pot instead of boiling. I added 1/2 t cumin seeds and 1/2 t red pepper flakes to the spice blend listed. This is a soup I'm sure I'll make again, love that after a hearty meal, we have enough leftover for a second meal.

I have been making this recipe for 3 years now... I make a giant batch in the fall and separate and freeze it for cold nights during the winter. The ONLY thing I do different is one less can of tomatoes, because the first time I made it I was one can short and we decided it was perfect anyway!! Thank you so much!!

Too much meat, prep and cook time info is wrong and WAY TOO MUCH sodium. We modified by cutting down to 2 bouillon, used 4 not 8 chicken breast halves, frozen corn, and NO added salt. It was good but still more sodium than needed and plenty of chicken (maybe still too much).

Whole tomatoes with diced is unnecessary, stay with all diced. On the fence about the salsa plus canned tomatoes (next time I think we'll just use salsa, some low sodium Mexican seasoned tomatoes or fresh tomato salsa/pico de Gallo as others have mentioned).

For certain next time no bouillon cubes. Canned beans rather than canned chilli beans will cut the sodium down tremendously.

I adapted for the Crock-Pot and it is restaurant quality!  used left over grilled chicken and did not add sour cream. it does not need it in my opinion. used home canned tomatoes and salsa. One more thing.... two tablespoons of chilli powder still makes it a bit spicy so start out with one then decide.

I still have dreams about it. I am a tiny, supple corn kernel, glistening with rich oil and jalapeno drippings. The mouth, warm windy cave beckons me inside as the slowly erotic grinding of the offwhite squat monks in rows knead me into sweet nothingness. Also, sour cream.

I made this for a family cooking contest and it was hands down the favorite. I use frozen corn, instead of canned. Just a preference in any soup I make.

I NEVER do reviews... but I LOVE this soup.. seriously can't get enough.. love the corn and the sour cream.. love the suggestion of using rotisserie chicken or subbing black beans, etc.. it's a bit of a kitchen sink soup with a great base.. just brewing a batch now and can't wait to dive in... enjoy and thanks Catherine!!!

I have made this soup several times with no variations however tonight since my boyfriend and I are both sick it I made it again this time don't have any chilli beans in the house. I used dried rosemary, and few other spices added to the soup. I have read most of the complaints when it comes to being too salty add a little vinegar this will take away some of the salt. My boyfriend loves this soup its so simple to make I just throw everything in a crock-pot or on the stove top in a big pot to simmer for about 2 to 4 hour's. Even my boyfriend made this last month he was impressed by the simple recipe and he says he can't cook. We keep everything in stock for soups in the house. Can smell it already but will wait till he gets home from work. I'm half Italian so most of the time I use my grandma's recipes for soup's this one is close to her's just different. Love this soup one day when I have time I will post some of my grandma's recipes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I took the advice of others and used black beans instead of chili beans.....other than substituting chopped fresh tomatoes for the canned whole tomatoes and adding some red pepper, I made it exactly as the recipe shows.  It was great!  I garnished it with a handful of fried tortilla strips, some avocado chunks and a dollop of sour cream.....a quick squeeze of lime....very good!

I was first drawn to this recipe because I had never used tomato soup (besides on its own) or salsa in a soup and I wanted to try it.  I made a couple changes though, to save time I cubed the raw chicken and cooked it in the olive oil on a pan with the onions and crushed garlic, then let the chicken cool before pulling with my hands.  Then I poured the medium chunky salsa and tomatoes (i used rotel tomatoes and chilies instead) in a pot with the tomato soup but only used 1 and a half cups of water, I figured I would add water as I went (didn't need anymore because of the liquid in the tomatoes).  I added 3 bay leaves, dried parsley, onion powder, garlic powder, chili powder (i didn't need any salt because chili powder is salty) and I put in a couple tablespoons of chicken Better Than Bullion instead of the cubes, much easier and tastier I think.  I decided I wanted it thick so I put in almost the whole container of SC and also added a half teaspoon of corn starch mixed with a tablespoon of water.  Then I put in about half a cup of raw rice.  It wasn't spicy so I added about 10 drops of green Tabasco and a drop or two of franks red hot (i would have used Sriracha but I was out), and some extra pepper. Also instead of chili beans I used one jar of kidney and one of black beans rinsed. I added cumin too for an extra kick and some adobo.  It came out awesome!  Basically a white chicken chili.

Absolutely delicious!! A few adjustments I would suggest: I only used 3 bouillon cubes and didn't add the 1/2 teaspoon of salt -it would have been too salty with the extra cubes/salt. I added two bay leaves to the chicken boil. I used super sweet frozen corn- the sweet little nit bits where a perfect addition! I also threw in some crushed up tortilla chips on the top of each serving. Enjoy it's the best soup ever!

This is one of my favorites. It is so flavorful and satisfying. I prefer to boil a whole chicken and use its broth. It freezes well, too. Since it makes such a large amount, I freeze the leftovers in individual serving containers. Great for a cool fall evening. Thanks for sharing!!

Irony? I've only been cooking for the family for a year and this is the very first soup that I have made. At the risk of sounding immodest, this is the best soup that I have ever had. My wife didn't quite say the same but she did say that it was better than anything she has made herself.

PS: I followed the advice of "Chef 101" review:
Cook onions and garlic in thick bottomed pot, add dry spices and herbs, add uncooked chicken (small cuts) until no longer pink, then add canned ingredients. One can of diced tomatoes and one can of whole tomatoes. I did use canned corn though. 

This is going on the menu for one of our next dinner invites.

Really delicious and easy!  I only used 4 large chicken breasts.  I cooked the onion and garlic in the olive oil.  Removed it and then browned the chicken a bit on both sides.  I then returned the onion & garlic to the pot and cooked the chicken in 4 cups chicken broth for an hour (rather than water and boullion.  I only used one can of tomatos - that was plenty.  Add all the other ingredients and cook for another 20-30 minutes.  Save the sour cream for the top.  I found the recommended amount of seasoning was perfect- spicey but not too hot.

This recipe it so yummy and simple! I had plenty of leftover chicken bones that I had been waiting to use and this recipe was perfect for them. I also added some chopped red bell pepper that I had to use soon and I topped the soup with sliced avocado. I will most definitely be making this again.

Been wanting to try this recipe for a long time and I finally served it for a dinner party last night.  This recipe turned out very well.  I used five chicken breasts and that was plenty.  Cooked them in chicken stock (32 oz) for one hour and removed from pan to cool and shred.  With the chicken stock left in the pan, I added a chopped onion and garlic.  I used 3 cans lo Rotel diced tomatoes, 1 teaspoon cumin, only 2 tablespoons of chili powder, a bag of frozen southwestern corn, 1 can black beans and one can of kidney beans.  I did use the jar of chunky salsa and tomato soup.  I served the sour cream on the side.  This was a wonderful dish and it received rave reviews.

Excellent and very customizable. I am constantly making chicken stock and freezing it, so I am always looking for great new soup recipes to try out. I bake the chicken (whole bird) separately and then shred it. I then added all the ingredients to the thawed stock (2 quarts) and simmer it all for 30 min. Came out really well.

My family loves this.    I used Swanson Chicken Broth flavor boost instead of bullion.  I only used one packet - needed about 1.5 packets.   I sauteed the onion prior and used 5 cloves of garlic (we love garlic).   I didn't use whole tomatoes - just used another diced can.   Only had black beans - which turned out wonderful.    This is a go to recipe for us..   We love soup !!!

This is Soo good. I followed the recipe/directions exactly as stated, except I didn't used the can of whole tomatoes. The diced ones were enough. And I cut up the chicken before I started cooking it. Added the shredded cheese on individual servings. With grilled cheese, this meal is amazing.

Delicious!  I, like some others, threw everything in my slow cooker.  In the last hour, I added chopped frozen spinach- gotta have those greens!  Loved it, and can't wait to have some more when I get home from work!

Used black beans instead of chili beans, used only large can of diced tomatoes, didn't have an onion, and didn't put in 2 quarts of water (wait until the end to see how much you need).  Threw it all in a slow cooker, put it in the fridge overight, and started it on low the next day.  FAB-ulous!

I've just made a batch of this soup and it's very, very tasty. The chicken is a bit overwhelmed by the amount of chilli bean and tomato but it's still a lovely meal. The next time I make this I will try substituting condensed chicken soup for the condensed tomato soup. This quantity made 8 English pints of soup so I have stashed loads in the freezer for eating and enjoying later. Thre recipe is very easy to make up and there could be endless variations on it which is what makes a good recipe great! I left out the 3tbsps of chilli powder as this might have been too hot for our tastes but otherwise I made no alterations. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Catherine :-) I only rate it 4* and not 5* because the chicken is overpowered by the chilli and tomato so I thought it was misleading to call it a chicken soup - more a chilli bean and tomato soup with chicken.

I modified based on the most popular reviews.  Made it in the crockpot, before leaving for work I put 4 split chicken breasts in along with the spices, a 32 oz container of chicken broth, a jar of salsa, a can of rotel, and a can of tomato soup.  When I got home I shredded the chicken and added some sauteed some onion and bell peppers, then frozen corn and a can of black beans and pinto beans.  This makes a lot, have lots in the freezer, but it's tasty and seems healthy, until you top with cheese, fritos and sour cream that is!

This soup is excellent! I made a couple changes to the recipe and loved it.  Instead of using 8 chicken breasts I use 5.  Instead of the one can of whole tomatoes I use a can of Rotel diced tomatoes with green chiles.  And since I don't care for chili beans I used 1 can of black beans instead.  And finally, instead of the sour cream I use a container of plain greek yogurt.  Once its in the bowl I add shredded cheddar or mexican cheese.  Excellent soup!

I made this recipe last night and it was AMAZING. It smells like it belongs with the tortilla chips. And the sour cream and cheese really top it off. All these ingredients I added after putting the soup in the bowl. My husband preferred to add grated Parmesan cheese but I used shredded Sharp cheese. Can't wait to add avocado slices, too. Yumm yumm!

AWESOME!  Made a real simple version using what I had and it was delicious. Boiled leftover whole rotisserie chicken 1hr in 6c water.  Removed skin and bones then added sauteed onion and garlic to chicken and broth.  Next, 2cans corn, 2cans dark red kidney beans and 1cup salsa.  1 can tomato puree and 1 can diced tomato.  2tbsp chili powder.  We couldn't stop eating it.

The soup was delicious however this recipe makes a lot of soup!  My husband & I agree that it's a bit too tangy, too much tomato flavour.

Absolutely YUMMY! I cut the recipe in half & still have so much left over. I followed some modified recommendations such as cooking the chicken first and adding all the ingredients. That was so much faster. I loved topping it with crushed tortilla chips. I will definitely make this again.

Awesome!!!!  I made this recipe many times now and I like to substitute black beans instead of chili beans.  Also, if you have the time let it simmer down for about 2 hours and it thickens up to a wonderful chip dip.  Top with cheese and a spoonful of sour cream.

This is an impressive recipe. I made only a few changes...added 1/2 of both a green bell pepper and a red. Also, left the sour cream out and used as a topper. I followed the advise of another reviewer and made my own crunchy tortilla strips in the oven. I had a few different varieties of tortillas, which made for some great colors. Topped the soup with mexican blend shredded cheese, tortilla strips, and sour cream. Delicious! Thanks, Catherine!

This is too much work for what it's worth. It wasn't that spicy either. If you want something like this that tastes way better try out Slow Cooker Chicken Taco Soup.

This soup was PHENOMENAL.  I skipped out on the salsa and the whole tomatoes, but otherwise followed the recipe to a T.  Turned out absolutely amazing.  Highly recommended!

This made alot of soup and although it was edible it was just not good enough to eat more than twice and even twice was stretching it for me. My son didn't finish his bowl and refused to eat the leftovers. It was too tomatoey and very spicy with no other flavor.

This is a really good soup. Very easy to adapt based on what you have on hand too. I used kidney beans instead of chili beans (I can't get those here), tomato sauce instead of condensed tomato soup and omitted the additional salt. Served with a little chedder cheese over top and it was delicious. Keep in mind, this makes a ton. I halved the recipe, used only two chicken breasts and still got 7 bowls. It also freezes very well.

I made this the day before we ate it and it turned out wonderfully!  My 9 yr old thought it resembled Wendy's restaurant chili.  Even my picky 6 yr old liked it!  It is a little spicy, but I still felt comfortable giving it to my 2yr old.  Will definitively be a keeper!

I thought my kids were going to take the pot and fight over it. The wife and I barely got any.....I do agree with the first reviewer that it looks harder than it really is and can be simplified with short cuts. Crazy good though.

I loved this soup and my husband, who is not a soup lover, ate three servings! I followed the directions for the most part. I did cut the amount of chicken in half and substituted it for shrimp which I added at the end. It was the frozen precooked kind that just needed to be thrown in to defrost and heat up. When adding the chili powder I added a couple dashes of red pepper, but we like the extra heat. I also left out the can of whole peeled tomatoes and switched in black beans for the chili beans. I decided to double the corn amount and use Pico de Gallo instead of a can of salsa like another review suggested. Everything turned out great! The mixture of shrimp and chicken tastes great and looks delicious. I am thinking that the next time I make this soup I may add some rice, but haven't decided. I don't think it's necessary.

Holy Moly, this is the BEST chicken soup I have ever tasted. I do want to mention that this recipe makes more than 8 servings, more like 12 but now I am so glad I made the full amount for only the two of us. It tastes so much better the next day and it's hearty so it fills you up. Great for work lunches. I even had enough to give to some co-workers and they loved it too. A new soup staple in my house. Thanks for the awesome recipe!!!!

I left out the whole tomatoes and used 2 fire roasted tomatoes as the diced tomatoes.  I added some chopped celery, julienned carrots, squash, and some rice.  Instead of the tomato soup, I used tomato sauce.  I used black beans instead of chili beans.  Everything else was done as written.

WOW!!!!this is wonderful..The broth is so rich and creamy. Followed the direction and only made 2 changes. I used fat free chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon for the simmering of the chicken and I used black beans..I love this soup! I took some to work and when I heated it up all the girls in the office needed to taste..they almost ate all my lunch...thank you! thank you!

Made this today and it went over really well! Did the one pot thing by cooking garlic, onions, and then chicken and dry ingredients in olive oil first and then adding canned ingredients. What I did different: 4 chicken breast halves, about 64 oz chicken broth, one can diced tomatoes, 1 can tomato paste, 1 cup salsa, 1.5 cup frozen corn, 1 can black beans, 16 oz plain yogurt, about half or 3/4 of the spices

This soup was a hit. The serving size is huge, I adjusted to 3 with only 1 1/2 large breasts and barely fit all the ingredients in my smaller size dutch oven. I followed the 1 pan idea from the top reviewer, used chicken broth instead of water and bullion added black beans and adjusted for ingredients I had on hand. Near the end of the process I felt there was just a depth of flavor missing and added my favorite ingredient Cumin and it added just that something extra. Without the changes I would still have rated it 5 stars

I  followed the recipe exactly.  I thought it tasted wonderful.  I love the flavor blend.  My husband thought it wasn't very flavorful, but I think that is because he is used to extremely spicy foods.  This had just enough kick. Yum!

delicious, thick, great for a cold night. I served it with homemade bread.  It is moderately spicy. I didn't have the whole peeled tomatoes so used more diced tomatoes.

Very good although i did make some changes.  I didnt use chili beans or whole peeled tomatoes.  instead i used diced tomatoes w/green chiles.  i also used seasoned black beans.  not sure if that made a difference.  i used the sour cream as a garnish along with lots of cilantro, lime wedge and tortilla chips. the garnish really topped it off!  the only thing i would do different next time is not use the jar salsa but again use the tomatoes w/green chiles and  oh next time i will add some cheese on top - yum!

This is a great crock pot meal. The chicken was so tender and pulled apart easily. I let the soup cook for about a hour longer then suggested in order to thicken the broth. Instead of boullion, which is loaded with sodium, I used four cups of low-sodium chicken stock. I didn't miss the extra salt at all! Excellent!

Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe and just added extra sour cream and another can of kidney beans. Sprinkled cheddar on top after I poured it into our bowls and that just made it all the more delicious. As they say, cheese makes everything taste better!

This recipe is easy and very delicious! I'm a student and so made it for myself and halved the recipe but it was A LOT and I ate it for 2 successive days. The changes I made, considering it a bit unhealthy, I substituted all kinds of canned tomatoes ingredient of same amount with fresh diced tomatoes together with its skin(anti-allergic properties+bioactive polyphenols+antioxidants, BUT careful washing is mandatory!); I substitued sour cream with yogurt, used dried basil instead of parsley, used 1 can of "Gallina Blanca tomato sauce for macaroni" in hand instead of condensed tomato soup, I substituted salsa with pickled cucumbers, and used only 1 cube of bouillon. I served with sweet dinner bun and it was the most wonderful meal. Thanks!

I love this recipe.  It's very good and it's great on a cold night.  The only complaint I have is the amount of chicken.  I really feel that it's a bit too much so I've reduced it a bit.

In the past year, I have made this probably 6 times, it has become a favorite, don't be afraid to add more spice if you like it that way. We will be having it again on Christmas Eve. I have used canned chicken and canned broth and it is just as good, but quicker and easier.

This was FANTASTIC!!!  I used less chili powder and not all the tomatoes to suit our taste and I could not get enough.  I loved the chili beans in it, used the mild variety.  I used frozen corn and only 1-2 bouillon cubes.  I was trying to cut the sodium some.  It's sad, I won't be able to buy canned soup anymore after making so many soup recipes from allrecipies!  There's nothing like home made soup!

WOW this has such a wonderful flavor!  And just enough spicy flavor.   All I did was use chicken broth instead of the water and omitted the chicken bouillon. Cut the chicken up into small chunks and add it to the pot after it started to boil.  The chicken just cooked in the soup and had lots of flavor.  I did follow the recipe exactly with everything else.  Give this recipe a try! It is even better the second day.

This soup was fantastic!! I used skinless boneless chicken thighs because I sent my little brother to the store and he brought back the wrong thing, but it was just as tasty! Really good on a cold winter night :)

I make this a few times every winter and freeze it to pull out for lunches since it makes so much. I only use 4 chicken breasts and find that to be more than enough meat for us.

This recipe was great!  It was hearty and was more like a chicken chili than a soup.  I made this for my parents and we all loved it.  It did have a bit more flavor when we ate it the next day for leftovers so definitely the longer it sits, the more flavor it has.  Overall, a great recipe!  I will definitely make it again.

This is super YUMMY!  My whole family enjoyed it :)  We are a family of 5 and we had enough to eat it for dinner and then lunch and froze enough to have it for dinner again .  Makes a lot!!  It is a little time consuming to make, but very well worth it :)  I am making out my grocery list and this is going to be made again!!!  Don't forget the crackers to go with it ;)

I absolutely loved this! Thanks for the best soup recipe ever. In fact i joined just to say i loved it! I made it for four people. All of whom thought it was the best. I did use a rotisserie chicken. Used 4 cups water and one can of chicken broth. Boiled with seasonings and chicken then slowly added the rest and simmered.  I omitted the whole tomatoes. Added extra diced. Did the black beans and one can chili beans. Otherwise i followed the recipe. I will be making this again and again. Thanks again so much. :)

I really like this recipe. It was easy to make and was ready very fast. I used a little less chicken and kidney beans instead of chili beans, but is still turned out really good and I think I will make it again.

This was great.  As other reviewers have said, the good thing about this recipe is its basic flexibility.  You can modify things and still keep the flavors you want.  I cut the recipe in half and instead of shredding the chicken, I cut two breasts into bite sized pieces.  I used fresh parsley instead of dry (I always prefer fresh herbs) and didn't add the salt (I took a queue from 'Uncle Ed's Nephew" about chili powder creating the sense of salt in a dish and held off until the soup was seasoned - in the end it didn't need the salt).  I also didn't add the salsa - instead I used diced tomatoes with chilis in them.  The flavors were really nice and hearty.

I used this recipe as a base for my own.  I made the broth in one pot with the chicken as the directions call for but then I also added 3 potatoes (cubed), 3 (chopped) celery stalks and 3 (chopped) carrots.  I then boiled up some medium shelled pasta. I then combined all 3 pots into one (Pasta + Broth/shredded chicken + Salsa pot) and it turned out amazing.  Very hearty and it will last a very long time

This soup totally hit the spot!  I was in the mood for something spicy but didn't really feel like making chili so this was perfect and quick and not as heavy.  I followed the recipe for the most part with the exception of the amount of chicken. I only had 4 chicken breasts in the freezer so I used that and it seems like a sufficient amount of chicken.  I just had some of the soup for lunch and hadn't even let it cook long enough. Can't wait to try it again tonight! I'm going to be serving it with cornbread and topped with sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese.  I will be keeping this recipe for my collection!

Wow,Wow Wow Wow my husband says.  I put everything in a crock pot but the corn and beans and sour cream.  Had to put it in a pot to add the last of the stuff was out of room.  This cut the need for olive oil. I all real stuff garlic, parsley and onion and no bouillion. (all broth) Used no salt tomatoes, and no tomatoes soup instead pulsed a can of whole tomatos (no salt) I did add a small amount of sea salt.  This great I wouldn't change a thing if it weren't for a low salt diet.    This wonderful....

This is the best soup I've ever made!  I doubled the seasonings (added some oregano too), used chicken broth instead of water + chicken bullion, and used light cream cheese instead of the sour cream.  Also, I used one big can of "crushed tomatoes with added puree" instead of the tomato soup/diced tomatoes/whole tomatoes.  This is an easy recipe and tastes SO GOOD!

Very good!  Reminds me of my taco soup recipe but is actually better.  Only changes I made:  I used low salt variety on all canned items, low fat sour cream and shipped the whole tomatoes.  Will make again, Thanks!

This soup rocks!! Spicy, hearty and easy to make.  Not for one on a sodium restricted diet- but not many soups are!!  Great for a cold winter dinner!  Makes alot, so invite some friends for soup.

This recipe was super easy and delicous. the only differences in mine was that i added some chopped jalapenos, as well as cayanne pepper, cumin, and extra chili powder. It turned out amazing and every loved it. Cant wait to make it again. Also, the chicken (before putting it in the soup) was amazing and was made again as the main dish of a seperate meal.

This soup is amazingly easy and absolutely delicious!! I've never made soup before, and was a little apprehensive on how it would turn out; but no worries!  I only made a couple of minor changes; I switched out one of the cans of chili beans with a can of black beans.  Also, I cooked the chicken breasts in a crock pot with chicken broth, a bit of water, and all the spices.  I'm just not too fond of boiled chicken breasts.  Just wonderful!!  I'm so glad I tried this recipe for my first soup!!

I found this recipe under "healthy cooking." That seems like a lot of fat to be considered healthy...

Great soup!  I used canned chicken broth (1qt) with the one quart of water.  No bouillon.  I used the sour cream just as a topping (dollop on top of the bowl).  I cooked just 3 large bone-in chicken breasts in the crockpot in the broth/water mix with the garlic, onions and peppers.  I also left out the salt.  I think next time I will use all diced tomatoes; not sure why the whole tomatoes.  Anyway, the soup was a huge hit and made enough to feed a small army.  Thanks!

I've made this several times.  This is a great recipe and easy to adjust for a smaller amount.  I used petite diced tomatoes (personal preference).  Hubby thought the onions and chunky salsa was too much.  One time I forgot and left out the salsa and it was still good.

My husband's favorite soup. I use canned chicken and whatever canned tomatoes I have in the house - any variety works, but we like crushed the best. You definitely don't need as many as the recipe calls for.

I'm not sure if this is chicken chili or soup, but it was really good.  I simmered in a crock pot for 12 hours and it got better and better the longer it simmered.

This ia an excellent, spicy, but not to spicy soup. I don't care for some of the ingredients individually, but when all these flavors come together it's a delicious balance. I didn't change a thing. Leftovers the next day are even better.

This soup is amazing!  I followed the reciped exactly as written.  Using medium salsa gave it just enough kick!  The only problem was, my pot wasn't big enough to hold all the soup.  The next time I will need to use two pots.

This was delicious! I did make some changes, so all I can do is rate my end result... After reading the reviews, I decided to omit the salt, the whole tomatoes, and the condensed tomato soup.  I only had 4 chicken breasts, but it was plenty!  I also reduced the chili powder to 2T and used black and white beans instead of chili beans (rinsed).  It really was excellent, and I will definitely be making this again!

I made this for a group of friends, they all loved it. I didn't read the recipe thoroughly and when I did, I had to just skip the olive oil/onion/garlic thing b/c I didn't have time! But otherwise I made it as is, except I did not put the sour cream in the soup. I chose to leave it on the side, and let people put it on if they wanted. Which they did, along w/ shredded cheese. These was SUPER yummy and I will definitely make it again.

Wonderful recipe!  This is a very tasty soup.  It's even better the second day. I used frozen roasted corn from Trader Joes and only four chicken breasts.  I also deleted the whole tomatoes.  This recipe makes a huge pot of soup so I was able to freeze three containers for some delightful winter dinners.

THis was a great recipe. I like using dark meat in soups and stews so I used chicken thighs and cooked them in the crockpot for about 5 hours with some of the spices. I try to avoid a lot of salt so I only used one boullion cube and put it in the crockpot with the chicken and the other spices.  I then shredded the chicken and added 5 cups of the broth with all the other ingredients and simmered for about 40 minutes. It was great. I found that I could have even added more spices!

This was good, though I did modify it a little.  I left out the salt and cut back on the bouillon (3 cubes) and chili powder (2 T).  Also, I had some leftover chopped green bell pepper, so I threw that in.  Next time I make it, I will go with all diced tomatoes.  I agree with other reviewers - those whole tomatoes seem a little out of place.  It's a good soup for a cold day!  Thanks!

I halved the recipe and turned this into a slow cooker soup.
I roasted a chicken the night before so I just used all the meat from that, I made the Salsa as suggested by another user, put everything in the pot using 5 cups of my homemade chicken broth instead of the boullion cubes and water. I also cut the spice to 1/2 tsp and it still had a slight kick to it. Cooked on high for 5 hours. I loved this, even a half recipe made so much that we gave away some to family members. I will make this again.

I sauted onions and bell pepper in a little butter and olive oil.  When they began to soften, I poured in a bottle of Bud Light Lime, then added the rest of the ingredients according to the recipe until the broth.  Since I put the beer in, I only put in 4 cups of broth.  I simmered for about 30 minutes - seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and chili powder.  Then I topped with sour cream, shredded cheese, chives and blue corn tortilla chips.  Yum!

I made this the other night and my boyfriend and I loved it!  I scaled the recipe down to 6 servings.  I omitted adding any salt.  Insted of whole tomatoes I just used Hunts fire roasted diced tomatoes.  In place of using corn and bean I choose Premium Selections Grande Black Bean and Corn salsa available at Kroger.  I added a tad more salsa and a bit more chili powder.  After the soup was finished we added some shreded taco cheese as a topper and some mild jalapeno peppers for more kick.  Loved it, will make it again!

YUMMO!!!
I followed the recipe with the exception of not using the 1 can of whole tomatoes...I don't think it needs it...plus...I don't think my soup pot would have held much more!  This is a BIG pot of soup!  Oh...it is good with or without the sour cream added.  
Great with cornbread too.
Hope you enjoy!

This was excellent soup.  It's easily made in the crockpot... I seared the chicken first with the onion and garlic, then put it in the crockpot with all the other ingredients (except the sour cream, which I waited until the end to add).  I also halved the recipe and it still made 3 dinners worth for me and my husband.  I cooked on low for 8-9 hours and the chicken was so tender... shredded them and put it back in the pot.  We followed the suggestion of another poster and made homemade tortilla chips to go along.  Yum!

This was excellent! I followed directions and simmered the chicken for an hour, rather than dice it up and mix in the ingredients right away, and it turned out exceptionally well. After an hour, I took the chicken out and it practically shredded itself under my knife it was so tender. The aroma was incredible. I left out the whole tomatoes (who wants exploding tomato juice in their face?) and used a tub of grocery store extra-hot salsa, which eliminated any need for more chili powder or cayenne. Only problem? The recipe sorely lacks green pepper. That will be a must next time. Also, Monterey Jack cheese goes beautifully on top.

Great recipe.  I made it as written except I added a can of diced green chilies and omitted the whole tomatoes and tomato soup.  Delish!

This soup is restaurant worthy!  Absolutely wonderful and great on a cold night.  I agree that the whole tomatoes make this soup a little tough to eat.  They're large and require cutting and they are really hot too.  I'll omit them next time and use one can chili beans, one can black beans rinsed and drained.  I will also slice avocado and put it on top of each individual serving.  The chicken only took about 20 minutes to cook through.  I'll probably use 2 1/2 quarts of water because I only had 4 cups of broth at the end and ended up using store bought stock for my 5th cup.  Green chili's might spice this up but honestly it doesn't need it.  Serve with tortilla chips or quesadillas... if that's how you spell it =)

Unbelievably tasty and pretty healthy too!  I realized at the last second that I was out of chicken boullion, but it still turned out great without it.  I also did not add the sour cream, and next time I won't use the whole tomatoes - I don't see the point of them really. 

I made a huge batch and froze it in individual containers to bring to work, and it works out great!  I just take each portion out of the freezer a night or two before and stick it in the refrigerator...an easy and healthy workday lunch!  If I want to indulge a little, I throw some sour cream, cheddar cheese, and crushed fritos on top.  I'm so glad I found this recipe!  Thanks!!!

I have made this recipe twice now and it just gets better!  My husband loves it!  The first time I made it I used chicken as called for, but the second time I used left over Turducken from New Year's.  Both were delicious.  I am sure any left over poultry would work fine... or shred a rotisserie chicken if you don't have time to prepare the recipe as written.  Also, I have not added the canned whole tomatoes and have not missed them.  I felt there was enough tomato without that addition.  I think the only other thing I add to this recipe is crushed tortilla chips to the top along with a bit of sour cream - yum!

This is a good soup and worth making at least once to try it. My husband really liked it but it's just not my favorite.  If I make it again, I would definitely add some heat, such as Rotelle, because it was not spicy enough for me.

This is very good and a keeper for soup in my house. Only used 6 chicken breast, all diced tomatoes, and instead of two cans of chili beans, used one can black beans, one can of red kidney beans, and the corn. Used hot salsa and even cut up two jalapenos and sauteed with onions, because we like heat. It was just right, not too hot to where you are dabbing the sweat from you brow with your napkin, but spicy.

My boyfriend and I made this soup last night and we were extremely impressed with the outcome.  We felt like this is the best soup we ever made.  At this very moment I'm thinking about the leftovers in my frige!

this was delicious!  I didn't have any salsa on hand, so I added a can of diced jalapenos to get the kick.  I also added a cup of basmati rice at the end, let it simmer for another 15 minutes - and I ended up with a tasty variation of jambalaya!

This is probably the BEST soup I've ever made.  I did make one slight change.  Instead of the can of whole tomatoes, I used a can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos.

I followed the recipe as it is and it turned out fantastic.  I couldn't stop eating it.  Its more like a chicken chili than a soup.  It is thick and has a very hearty chili flavor.  If you want it more soup like, I suggest using about 1/2 the chicken suggested.

Very good and very easy! I made the following subs/changes: left out whole tomatoes per other reviewers' suggestions, used about 2/3 amount of chicken, used leftover chipotle-seasoned pintos instead of chili beans, and left out chili powder. Perhaps the chipotle remnants were enough, but it was plenty spicy without the chili powder. I also used "medium" heat salsa. It's a bit salty with all the canned products, so I'd recommend low-sodium canned goods and then salting to taste at the end. Definitely a keeper in our house!

Great soup!  I used 6 chicken breasts and added 3 packs of Goya Sazon to the water while they were cooking.  Used 1 can diced and 1 can Rotel tomatoes, a can of creamed corn b/c that's all I had and put some heavy cream in at the end that I had leftover, along with 1/2 container of sour cream.  This makes a nice big pot!  Thanks for posting!

This was okay.  I expected something else. To me it's a little too much tomato. My family all said it reminded them of the slow cooker chicken tortilla soup, and I agreed.  Had to make too many changes, like I added cilantro(a lot), less tomatoes, more spices. We'll stick with the other.

This recipe was OUTSTANDING! It provided a lot of food for several people, and was even great warmed up the next day! 

I added fresh cilantro in the soup and I really liked that extra flavor! Everyone who ate it raved! Very very good!

AMAZING! 

I substituted fresh Cilantro for the Parsley and I think that it adds great flavor to this recipe. I recommend it. I also added 1/2 of a green pepper. Also a great addition.  

I also substituted boneless, skinless chicken breast STRIPS. I found them easier to cook and shred. 

I also recommend using a fresh salsa, the kind usually found in the deli section of the grocer in the plastic tubs, rather than the mass-produced salsa in the jar. The salsa will adjust the spice and flavor of this recipe, so if you want something spicier, get a spicier salsa. 

I have to say it was even better the second day after marinating overnight in the fridge. This takes a while to cook, but it is amazing!

I turned this recipe into a crockpot recipe.  I omitted the water, and dumped everything but the corn and sour cream into a crockpot.  I used two large, bone in breasts.  Cooked in crockpot on high for 5 hours, removed the chicken, let it cook and shredded it, and added it back to the pot with the corn, and turned the pot on warm until ready to serve.  It was awesome on a cold rainy day!

Delicious!!! I used a whole rotisserie chicken. Pulled off the meat and simmered it in the broth for about 5 minutes to cut time. I used black beans. This is a really delicious soup!

I made this soup pretty much as directed and it turned out perfect for my family - not too spicy and not too mild.  I made mine with all diced tomatoes (no whole tomatoes) and I switched one of the cans of chili beans for black beans.  I also opted to serve the sour cream on the side.  It was awesome!  I have served it with tortilla chips and over fried polenta - yum!  Next time I'll serve it with avocado on the side too.

this recipe was so good!  I had a bowl to taste it and immediately had another bowl...I added sour cream and avocado to my individual serving...this has been added to my all time favorite soups...However I cut back on the amount of chicken on this recipe...I only used 4 chicken breast halves...and I cubes it and sauted it in the olive oil and onions then I added the rest of the ingredients...but I pretty much kept to the recipe other than that change...I will make this over and over again...

This recipe is wonderful for the autumn! Really gets ya in the mood. I used less chicken (3 breasts instead of 8) and it was plenty! The broth was fabulous. Rich and creamy. I really recommend giving this one a try.

Delicious! I made a few changes based on other reviewers-- sauteed the garlic and onion in the olive oil, then added diced chicken until almost cooked. Added the spices, then wet ingredients. I cut back on a few things--only used 6 cups of water and 2 cans of diced tomatoes, 1 can of soup, and 2 tbsp of chili powder. Instead of adding sour cream in the soup, I put a dollop on top of each bowl, along with some taco cheese and crushed tortilla chips. This recipe is a keeper, thank you!!!

As usual I never scale back a recipe, so I followed measures shown - it was great for dinner, lunch and dinner..ha ha! In fact, I often find a soup tastes much better the second day.

Only difference in prepapration for me, was frying the garlic and onion in the olive oil, then adding herbs and spices then chicken until it turned white, then adding water. Let it cook for maybe 40 mins before I added everything else and brought it to the boil; just let it simmer away for another 40 mins.

My wife thinks I should do it the next time we have friends - I say why share! Ha ha. Great tasty meal in itself!

This was is a very very good soup.  I cooked the chicken breasts in the spices.  Sauted the onion and garlic and then added everything else.  Not the extra tomatoes.  Used kidney and white beans as that is what was in my pantry.  Also like others added sour cream to bowl.  Thanks so much for a nice soup will be making again.

The soup was good but I didn't think it deserved 5 stars.  It needed more salt, and  it was not a very developed stock base, very heavy on the tomatoes.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was great.  I did everything exactly as the recipe said only I used 4 chicken breasts and fresh parsley since I was out of dried parsley.  Even with the chicken cut in half, it was still plenty for the normal recipe.  This also made a TON of soup...I ended up freezing most of it afterwards.  I topped my bowl with shredded cheddar, an extra scoop of sour cream and some tortilla chips!  Excellent...will make this again!  

*Also I used the full amount of chilli powder and my b/f and I both agree that it wasn't spicy at all.

This soup is incredible! By far the best soup i have ever had. I was a little hesitant about adding the corn and sour cream, but it complimented the soup very nicely, and definetly should not be omitted! Also, being in the middle of july,the only corn i had was corn on the cob. I ended up par-boiling a cob of corn in the chicken broth with the chicken during the last few minutes of simmering, then cut if off the cob when i shredded the chicken. The corn finished cooking while it simmered with the final ingredients, and was an extra sweet touch. I cant get enough of this soup!

This is one of the best soups I have ever had.  It is so wonderful and spicy!  I omited the can of whole peeled tomatoes as others suggested and it was perfect.  I used the Rotel diced tomatoes with green chiles for the diced tomatoes.  Other than that, didn't change a thing and WOW, it is good!

This is excellent.  I used three cans of diced tomatoes instead of the whole tomatoes and added extra chili powder because we like everything spicy.  Just be sure to have a very large stock pot.  I had to tranfer the soup from my regular stock pot to an extra large one.

After reading some reviews I decided to follow the receipe and do it Catherine's way and I'm happy I did. This soup is awesome. The only thing I will say is that 8 servings is really like 12 or more and we were only 2 people. I froze the leftovers. I also topped the soup with cheese, sour cream, chives and crushed blue tortilla chips. You could also add sliced avacado. I will make this in place of Chili in the future.

I love it too!  It definitely becomes even more flavorful after a day or 2.  I agree with everyone that the whole tomatoes can be left out.  Also, I think you can get away with half the chicken called for and it makes it even better (and cheaper!)  Great stuff though...

Catherine, you have truly outdone yourself! This soup is wonderful. I have to make it alot for my grandson as he loves everything spicy. If you love tomato and spicy, make this just like what it calls for. And I love how easy it is to add things too. thanks a bunch for a very good soup.

Our family loved this dish!  I changed a few things...boiled a whole chicken and deboned it and used the broth for the soup. --I cooked the onions and garlic in the broth and then added back the debonded chicken.  No tomato soup, added can of rotel w/ green chiles instead of canned tomatoes.  And added both kidney and pinto beans.  It was great.  Try garnishing with sour cream, avacado slices and tortilla chips.

DELICIOUS!!!!  Next time, I would make a day ahead and let all the juices/spices simmer together over night.  It was great the first night, but even better the night after and after. :) 
Thanks!

This recipe was awesome! Instead of simmering it the last 30 min, I put it in the crockpot for 2 hours. next time I'll add jalepenos for an extra kick.

This WAS very good.  Better than another "tortilla soup" that I tried.  I too omitted the whole tomatoes and the condensed soup...I was aiming for something a little thicker and heartier.  We garnished with some grated cheese and crushed tortilla chips.  I think this is a keeper.

Excellent.  I add some diced jalapenos to spice it up, and I exclude the tomato soup and add only one can of diced tomatoes (as other reviewers suggested).  If you can find chipotle powder (I like Penzey's), that adds a nice smoky touch.

I thought this was very good!  I used spicy salsa so I only added 3 teaspoons of chili powder.  This was about right for my family.  My husband said to put it in the "make again" category.  That is a compliment from him. It was a little too spicy for my 3 year old to enjoy.  I loved it. Definitely a keeper!

After making modifications I would rate it a 5 star.  I added more chili powder, cumin, sazon seasoning, cayenne,  added a little bit of pasta shells and used 1 can of black beans.

This is a very good recipe. My family loved it. I did cut the pepper down to 3/4 tsp. and the Chili powder to 2 Tbsp. as some don't like real spicy food. I also added a can of black beans. I froze 1/2 of it and will see how that turns out in a week or so.

This recipe was great, but boy did it make a lot of soup!! I gave a bunch away and froze the rest. Next time I'll try halving the recipe. The flavor was wonderful, though.

Wonderful soup.  Had it for the last 3 days and still not tired of it.  Still have enough left for 3 days more so I would caution folks to halve the recipe if their family is small.  The only change I made was to reduce the amount of chili powder.  This is by far one of the best soups we've ever tasted.  Thank you Catherine for sharing.

I added Cumin like the others.  This gets better with age just like a chili.  A hit with everyone.  Due to budgetary restraints, I upped the chili (kidney) beans and lowered the chicken portions.

I really enjoyed this soup. It definitely makes a ton of it so its good for a small crowd. It also freezes quite well. I only used 2T. of chili powder and felt it had  a bit of a "kick" with that amount. I used low fat sour cream and omitted the corn because of a picky husband. I served it for company and everybody loved it. This soup is a keeper!

Like TIGERHAWK I added cumin.  I also added a little chopped cilantro, and I used pinto beans instead of kidney. I  squeezed fresh lemon before serving.  Delicious!

This is the best soup recipe I've ever had!  I made it around Christmas time so we would have something quick to heat up for lunch.  I only used 2 TBS of Chili Powder, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly!  My whole family enjoyed and I'll be sure to pass this recipe onto others!

I thought this soup is a KEEPER. I made a double batch and we had it over Thanksgiving. It was available whenever anyone got hungry. I did decrease the chili powder to 2 tbs, and being I doubled it, I used one medium and one mild salsa. I also used only crushed tomatoes.
The only thing I would change is add another cup of Chicken broth to the soup. It was LOVED by all the company. I will be making it again next week.

This was a great hit! I did follow some of the suggestions. I omitted the can of whole tomatoes and used Knorr's chicken stock intead of doing it from scratch. Saved a ton of time. Also, used 6 cups of the broth. Will be making this again soon and have been asked to double it next time around!

This was a delicious soup, I loved it.  It was really spicy at first, but it mellowed a lot after a night in the fridge. Next time I would only put 2 Tbsp. chili powder instead of 3. I would definitely make it again.

The recipe is the favorite thing I've tried from allrecipes so far!  It is absolutely delicious.  I replaced the whole tomatoes with another can of diced tomatoes.  I think what really makes the recipe is the sour cream.  It really adds a great flavor. I used light sour cream and it turned out great. It made a LOT of soup, but this is great because I loved it so much!

This makes a LOT of tasty soup!  Fortunately it freezes well.  I've made it twice & didn't have salsa 2nd time - didn't notice that much difference.  Soup does taste better 2nd day - be sure to add the sour cream; it seems to "mellow" all the tomato taste.

Yummy!  I tried this tonight and my husband (a tough judge) and I (a picky eater) really enjoyed it.  I halved the recipe and substituted rice for the beans (can't stand them) and simmered the whole thing for about 1 hour which made it more like a chili or stew which I really enjoyed.  I also added a can of green chilies and left out the whole tomatoes.  I'm glad there's so much left over.  Thank you for such a good recipe.

This soup is fantastic, and is even better the next day.  I used this recipe to get rid of some leftover store-bought rotisserie chicken.  I went ahead and simmered it with the spices in the recipe to mix the flavors better, but only for about 20-30 minutes because the chicken was already cooked.  This is a great recipe for a cold, yucky day.  Also, halving the recipe still made a ton of it.

I made this 2 nights ago and the 1st night my husband thought it was just o.k and so did I. Then last night we had it and it was awesome, I think all the ingredients had to marinate together, or something but it was awesome. Every couple bites my love would say this is sooooo good, man i love it.. I put sour cream and tortilla chips in. Very good!! Thanks..

This recipe was delicious!!  I did make a few changes; I omitted the can of whole tomatoes and added a small can of green chilis and 1 can of black beans.  I'm pregnant at the moment and I think this has become my newest craving!  Thankfully there's enough left over to enjoy over and over again.  Definitely putting this in my cookbook!

The recipe is delicious. I cooked a turkey the other night, with the carcass and some frozen chicken parts made turkey/chicken soup. After eating turkey for 3 meals I couldn't eat the soup, too much turkey. 

Last night I added the ingredients in this recipe and tasted it, great. We're eating it for dinner tonight. I didn't have beans so I added a can of turkey chili w/beans. I only used one can of tomates and no tomato soup as I don't like the  the taste. I think 3 cans of tomato items is way too much tomato for me.I haven't put in the sour cream yet, my opinion it is great without the sour cream. 

Thanks for sharing this.

This soup is awsome!!  I had leftover Alberson's rotisseri chicken and did a search for a chicken soup.
I only had one can of chili beans so I also added a can of black beans.  I did not have a can of tomato soup so I added a can of tomato puree.  I added a can of rotel tomatoes.  It turned out quite spicey-just the way we like it!!  Spectacular!

LOVE THIS SOUP...I got this recipe in August and have made it at least 4 times! Plus there's so much a freeze a tub of it then I can have it anytime. The only subs I made was I used a whole chicken, substituted a can of ro-tel for one of the cans of diced tomatos, used 1 12 T. of chili powder, and added fresh corn...YUMMMM

This was delicious!  As I was boiling the chicken, I threw in about 5 cloves of chopped garlic.  I used all the tomatoes and added frozen corn instead of canned, 4 carrots chopped and 2 zucchinis chopped.  I did reduce the chili powder to 1 Tbsp otherwise my kids wouldn't eat it.

I loved this soup! I was looking for a white chilli recipe and found this one instead. I used bone in chicken breasts and just removed skin and bones before shredding. My husband was out of town so to make it kid friendly I served it over white rice. The next day I strained some of the "soup" and spread a serving over a bed of lettuce for a "taco" salad. Excellent.

This was a good recipe.  I actually made this in my slow cooker, slightly altering the ingredients and cutting the recipe in half.  I cooked the chicken whole, about 1/2 an hour before serving, took it out and shredded it using a knife and fork, then put it back in.  Good, but could have used some more vegetables - maybe some celery or zucchini for some crunch.  I'll try this one again.

This was a great soup.  It was even better the next day.  I didn't consider it "spicy".  I added cayenne and cumin to it on re-heating.

Loved it. Having seconds tonight. 

One issue. It says ready in 45 minutes. 

If you read the recipe details, it has an hour to simmer the chicken, then 30 minutes to simmer after mixing it all together. 

It took me a bit under 2 hours to be ready.

This is a very nice soup. The only change I made was to cut back on the chili powder very slightly in deference to my husband's taste. But I could have used the entire amount and it would not have been overly hot and spicy.

Love love this soup.  Have made a few times.  First time exactly as written.  Now I make it with half the amount of chicken breasts and it is still plenty!  With the 8 breasts it was mostly chicken more like a casserole lol.

I'm not a great cook, not even close. I've been using Allrecipes for the past two years to find simple, basic recipes that even I can't screw up. I've tried some and liked them, tried others and hated them. But this recipe is above and beyond my favorite- so easy to make, and tastes SO GOOD. I follow the directions almost exactly, with one change- for the canned tomatoes, I use cans of hot Rotel. I also use hot salsa. And hot chili beans. We love spicy food in my family, and by using spicier ingredients, it makes this soup so perfect for us. Alternatively, if you can't stand spicy food, just get mild versions of all ingredients! The only real "work" in this comes from trimming/halving the chicken breasts, and then dicing one onion. I have a can of pre-minced garlic that I use for this because I don't even trust myself to chop garlic. Regardless, this soup has come out perfectly every time and the leftovers never last long. 5 stars.

I made it the crock pot way, closely following the suggestion of LasVegas00, including the pico de gallo for salsa, halving the recipe, but also adding the beans she left out & adding 2 cups of water (instead of the 2 quarts per recipe). Also used 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper just before serving (forgot about it earlier) instead of chili powder, and that was plenty hot for me. Ate the soup without any sour cream, as I forgot about that due to my haste to sample. One word: YUM!

This is one of our favorite recipes we have found! We omit the sour cream and add as needed in our bowl to cut calories. We also omit the whole tomatoes simply because we don't like them. Great recipe!!

We loved this. I made no changes, even though I was suspicious about adding the sour cream to the soup and almost left it to serve on top, but I'm glad I didn't. This soup was awesome, filling, and the leftovers fed us for a week. This one is a keeper!

This was good. It is much like some other soup recipes I have come across on here.  Just FYI, this makes way more than 8 servings!  After eating four generous portions, I still have over two LARGE tupperwares full of this soup.  One ended up in the freezer.  I'm glad to have so much of a good thing, though!

I been looking for a good tortilla soup and I came across this one and this was the EXACT SOUP MY TASTE BUDS WANTED!  I love this soup!  I have made it over 5 times since I found the recipe 3 months ago.  I did skip the sour cream in the soup, I add it to my personal bowl if I feel like it, but it is superb without it.  I don't add the can of whole tomatoes, I just add another can of diced tomatoes, I really love tomatoes so the more the merrier.  I also only use two chicken breasts because that is enough chicken for me.  I also usually use all the water from the boiled chickens not just 5 cups.  One more thing I add is one to two small cans of green chilies, I have had the soup with them and without them and it is good both ways, I just like green chilies.  I freeze a bunch of it and it's the same goodness from when u first make it!

This is one of my favorite soups. Really easy to make and pairs well with one of my other favorites, corn bread.  I cut way back on the chicken, usually about 3-4 breasts, depending on the size and never feel like it's missing anything.

Yummy!! Made this tonight and it was super delicious. I added a tablespoon of cayenne pepper to it as we like our food quite spicy. I changed the servings to 4 and it made a big pan full and I still have half leftover to freeze for another night :)

This is the BEST soup I've ever made!  It is so easy to make as well.  My only advice is that I only needed half of the chicken that it calls for....otherwise it will be very thick with chicken and have less juice.  I have made it several times and never had a person who didn't love!

Really good! I froze over half of this (even with sour cream in it) into a muffin pan, and the salsa & sour cream containers (used in the recipe). Reheated slowly on the stove... Really great recipe!

I throw all these ingredients (raw) into my slow cooker. I just cut the chicken into smaller bits and it all comes out so nicely! My mom loved this soup, she helped devour my  stash'o'soup in the freezer! I like adding cilantro into mine (found some frozen in cubes at the grocery store). I usually use about 2 chicken breasts and 3-4 cans of beans (garbanzo is good!) doesn't really matter what kind, I like the white beans in this soup tho, looks nice.

Great soup! I use chicken pieces from a cooked rotisserie chicken and this works out just fine. I also add a little sugar to perk up the taste a bit and omit the sour cream.

This is my favorite soup recipe.  I have been making it for several years and it is a hit with the whole family.  Perfect for those cold winter days.  I use three cans of diced tomatoes instead of 2 cans of diced and one can of whole tomatoes because I thought the whole tomatoes were too big.  I also use 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons of chili powder instead of 3 because my family doesn't like super spicy foods.  I think it is better if it cooks longer than 30 minutes to get it thoroughly heated through and let the flavors mix. Top with cheese and crushed tortilla chips. Absolutely delicious!

My family loves this soup and it is requested several times a year, especially during cold winter months.  I only make a couple of slight changes, just for my own personal preference (I use rotel and tomato sauce instead of the whole and diced tomatoes).  And I usually just bake a whole, small chicken and pull the meat off instead of the chicken breasts.  Very good, hearty soup!  Thanks for the recipe.

Can I please say that this is the most amazing 'meal' recipe I have found on Allrecipes?  I love it, love it.  I'm excited when I find a leftover batch in the freezer.  Oh my goodness.  It has earned a permanent place in my go-to meals!

Great recipe. I made it with ingredients that I had on hand and had to make two substitutions.  Tomato sauce for the condensed soup and black beans for chili beans. I had medium salsa on hand and it turned out to be the perfect amount of spice for us. Excellent! It makes a lot of soup, enough for many meals for the two of us.  Instead of freezing extra portions like I usually do, I took it to work to share with my staff.  They all liked it a much as my husband and I did.  Definitely a keeper.

I absolutely LOVE this soup! I've made it about a dozen times. Now that I'm a spicy chicken veteran, I've figured out a few changes that really make the recipe POP! I substitute black beans for chili beans, add some cilantro and squeeze in the juice of a half a lime. I use rotisserie chicken from the store to save time. And to save calories, I garnish with plain greek yogurt, instead of sour cream. I also add a few dashes of hot sauce, to ensure this "spicy" soup stands up to its name. It's a rare rainy day in LA - so I'm planning to make it again tonight!

Little bit on the salty side for my taste. I suggest leaving out the extra salt since you can always add more later. Otherwise, excellent recipe

This makes way more than 8 servings as it has 8 chicken breasts and then 8 cans of various ingredients.  Also, not sure how it can be ready in 45 minutes if I am simmering chicken for an hour?  I didn't have 5 cups of broth left after simmering for 45 minutes.  Very spicy and salty.  Next time will only add 2 bouillons and half of salt.  Omitted soup.  Don't like to make soup out of soup.  The sour cream is an absolute must.  The creaminess, in my opinion, is what makes it great.

We love this at my house, but this recipe is HUGE.  I would suggest halving the recipe.  It does not fit in our slow cooker, as is.  

Also, I just throw everything in the slow cooker in the morning with frozen chicken breasts (that's right!  they should be FROZEN so that they don't overcook).  By dinner time the chicken breasts are perfect for pulling with a fork, but not overcooked.

We LOVE this soup!  This has become a staple in our house and even though the ingredient list is long, most (if not all) items are things I keep on hand.  I follow the recipe except for a couple of minor changes.....I use frozen corn instead of canned, and we dollop the sour cream into our bowls instead of mixing it into the entire batch of soup.  My family likes to add shredded cheddar cheese and crushed tortilla chips or fritos into their bowls at the table.  But the soup is delicious without it too.  Also, this recipe makes a ton of soup....find it hard to believe it is only 8 servings.  When I serve it to my family of 6, we have more leftover than was eaten.  Of course, that is a good problem to have.

My 8 year old said this is the "best soup in the world!"  It is a HUGE recipe.  I downsized it and it still didn't even fit in my crock pot.  I would halve it next time.  For my own records, I want to remember, that I did 1 quart water, 3 chicken breasts, just one can tomatoes. After cooking in the crock pot a few hours, added the corn and just one can pinto beans with chili powder and mini star noodles for the last 15 minutes.  Served with sour cream and avocado on top.

My husband and I have been making this for a few years now, and yes, like others I have left out the whole tomatoes and use frozen corn.  We crush tortilla chips on top and add cheese.  
This recipe is well worth the time it takes to make it.  
Just finished a bowl before writing this.  Yum!!

It is fairly bland and has WAY too much chicken.  And coming from someone who likes a meaty soup, that is saying a lot.  I had to add a little extra salt, an extra table spoon of chili powder, a teaspoon of cayenne pepper, and two roasted red peppers.  I could have easily halved the amount of chicken.

My fave chicken tortilla soup recipe- I only use 2 big chicken breasts, one can of beans and just a little of the broth- that's all that fits into my crockpot.  add tortilla chips and a little cheese- warms your heart and your stomach.  Best recipe I've seen!

Terrific! I was out of salsa, so I substituted 2 cans of Rotel. I don't like chicken boullion cubes, as they usually contain MSG or some form of gluten, so I substituted some gluten free chicken stock for the water and boullion. Definitely a keeper!

wow! this soup was amazing.  i have found 1 more recipe to entice my son into eating chicken, thank you!  i didn't get to follow it to a T, i didn't have the beans, or whole tomatoes (but next time, i will try that).  i also didn't add sour cream into the soup its self, because we're on a budget and sour cream is a nicety, i added a dollop on top and it was just perfect.  i think next time i will add half the chili pepper, since it was SPICY.  and more chicken (i used 5 chicken breasts, cubed since i was making for only two... but i did use the rest of the measurements.  it was so tasty, and i am going to be making more without a doubt, freezing and making this a part of our regular menu.  thank you  Catherine

I'm a very simple cook, so the list of ingredients was a little overwhelming at first.  While there are quite a few ingredients, most of them are common household groceries and are relatively inexpensive.  And even though there are a number of ingredients, it's virtually impossible to mess this recipe up.  It's totally worth the time and money you spend on it.  On an added note:  If you have trouble finding CONDENSED TOMATO SOUP in the grocery store [like I did], I found a substitution online for 8oz tomato sauce, 2 tbsp sugar, 1 tbsp cornstarch, and 1/2 tsp salt.  Throw that together, and it comes out just as delicious.  I hope everyone enjoys this recipe as much as I did.  The beauty of it is that whether you're a salty, sweet, or spicy lover, you can adjust all of the ingredients exactly to your liking, and it's virtually impossible to end up with a bad result.  I promise you and your family will love this meal, and it will make plenty of leftovers that re-heat wonderfully!  Bon Apetit!

Really good, flavourful soup.  Nothing wrong with recipe as is, but I did a bit of tweaking to suit my own tastes - left out the tomato soup, used pinto beans, used the sour cream on top, and added a bit more heat (red pepper flakes).  Very tasty the 2nd day with a dollop of sour cream, some green onion, and a hunk of fresh cornbread on the side.

I took this to a family gathering and because it was soup no one was interested until my brother ate some to make me feel better.  He had three bowls of it.  Next thing I knew it was all gone.  My father said, and others agreed, that it was hte best soup they had ever eaten.  I agree.

The was very very good.  I dumped everything into a 6 quart slow cooker and turned on high for 5 hrs and turned out excellent!  I used 8 chix thighs instead of breast and then took them out after cooking ans shredded the meat and placed back in slow cooker and made rice and poured soup over rice what a meal!

I doubled the recipe and it made a TON!!! This recipe was time consuming and laborious but I found it fun to cook and it was definitely worth it! I froze a bunch of it in containers and gave it to family members. Everyone devours it and says it rocks! It reminds me of tortilla soup from Max and Ermas. I will be making this every year for sure!

Very delicious and flavorful!  Tastes a lot like a tortilla soup I used to get at a nearby restaurant.  My family and friends loved it.

I gave this four stars only because I was upset that so many of these items came from cans. The taste was delicious. Instead of using all these canned items dice up tomatoes, onions, jalopenos or serranos peppers. I used corn on the cob and removed the corn from the cob instead of using a can of corn. I also had pinto beans already made so I didn't use those in a can either.

Used this for a basic idea for my soup. Big difference that I did, I just threw everything in the pot together all at once. Don't know how you could mess this one up! It's delicious!

The family loves this soup!  You can omit the olive oil without effect.  I never add the sour cream into the soup, but offer it as a garnish.  The parsley can be subbed with cilantro if you like.  It's flexible, but so good.  Also, one of the cans of diced is good to sub with Hunt's chili seasoned diced tomatoes.  Then you don't even need the salsa.  Sooo good!

This soup is really tasty and easy to make. It's even more like a chili. My husband and I loved it. This recipe made a ton but I froze half to eat at another time. The only adjustment I made was to add 3 14.5 cans of diced tomatoes instead of the whole tomatoes and tomato sauce.

I've made this a couple of times now.  I find it easy to follow the directions.  Even though I'm only cooking for two, I make it according to the 8 servings and freeze most of it for later.  We love this soup!

Best soup I've ever had.  Every one else says the same.  My wife's new favorite meal.  Stay away from adding lime like some tortilla soups call for.  It detracts from the taste.  Garnish with cheese, tortilla chips, and avacado.  The chips are a must...have chips on the side and add them as you eat it so they are crispy.  Otherwise you just get a bowl of soggy chips.

Made it for the first time tonight. It is AMAZING. I also deleted the whole tomatoes as well as the beansand used frozen corn. I only used 2 Tbls of chili powder because I was also making it for my kids. All around yummy meal!!

I didn't have tomato soup, so I used a small can of tomato sauce and a can of tomato paste to substitute.  I used 2 cans of kidney beans instead of chili beans.  I also didn't have any whole tomatoes so I used one 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes and one 15oz can of diced tomatoes with green chilis.  I omitted the chili powder altogether as the medium salsa I used made the soup pleasantly spicy but not too spicy for kids.  I also used about 2x the sour cream the recipe called for.  It was excellent. Thanks for sharing.

Excellent!  I didn't read all the reviews, so I don't know how many people mention this, but the Cook time is WRONG on this.  The first thing you do is simmer the chicken for 1 HOUR! The simmer the combined soup for another 30 min.  Just wanted everyone to know that this isn't a quick soup.  And you can tell - VERY TASTY!  I used a mild salsa for my first time, but will try medium next time.  We like it hot and my dad was adding Tabasco with the mild salsa.  Shredding the chicken was so easy and I like that in soup better than chunks.  Thanks!!

this is good.  It tastes a lot like Chili's Chicken Tortilla Soup but I think its not as "bright" tasting.  Its smoother and a bit more creamy (maybe the sour cream or the tomato soup).  We topped it with broken tortilla chips and some cheddar cheese.  D'Lish!

So good! I usually half the recipe and add a little cayenne pepper and 2 bay leaves to the soup. I've made this twice: first time, with beer and chicken broth and the second without. My husband and I both prefer the flavor in the first with the beer. It just makes it!

Very good.  I used enchilada sauce instead of the 16 ounces of salsa, only because that I what I had available.  It still tasted very good, but will definitely be chunkier when I add the salsa next time.  I served it with rice and/or tortilla chips.

This soup is fabulous! I made it exactly as the recipe called for.  It was so easy and the ingredients were all staples in my house, but I was surprised at how much my whole family loved it!  I made it without sour cream mixed in, but topped the individual bowls with shredded cheese and a little sour cream.  I will make this all the time.  Thank you so much for sharing!!

This soup is amazing!  I followed the receipe exactly, but left out the sour cream and only used enough olive oil to coat the bottom of the pan.  Turns out perfect each time!

Excellent soup!  I didn't have sour cream on hand, so I left it out and didn't miss it one bit.

Absolutely loved this one with a few changes. I left out the can of whole tomatoes and tomato soup. I used 2 lbs chicken thighs, shredded. I also added one 15oz can of black beans (drained), 2 fresh jalapeños (diced), half a green pepper, 2 roma tomatoes (diced). I used a habanero lime salsa that I really enjoy.   I garnished with tortillas brushed with olive oil and sprinkled with fresh cracked pepper and creole seasoning and baked for 10 minutes at 350. Cut in quarters and sprinkled with cheddar cheese and a generous dollop of sour cream.  When I do this recipe again, I will add 1 or 2 habanero peppers, and maybe some diced green chilis but I am extremely happy with it. A tasty, inexpensive dinner that will make great left-overs.

I used low sodium broth and diced tomatoes. Used unseasoned beans and added my own chili spices. Added no salt. Fresh corn, Fat free sour cream. Used fresh onions and garlic. No olive oil. Serve with reduced fat cheese. Other then that it was real good.

Aside from changing up the preparation as I had some leftover turkey I wanted to use, I made this as per the recipe.  I just sauted the onion and garlic in olive oil and then added everything to the pot to simmer for half and hour. Absolutely the best soup I have made in years and years!

I have made this soup three times now and have LOVED it every single time.  I generally follow the recipe except this last time I omitted the whole tomatoes as I felt they were just a bit too much.  My sister and brother-in-law each had three bowls a piece over the weekend!  Great recipe!  Thank you!

I chose to leave out the sour cream and have that on the side... the first night I put a spoonful of sour cream in it, it was ok... I had it the next day without sour cream, my husband and I both prefer it without..  I added a good squirt of hot sauce to my bowl of soup, I LOVE spicy food...  made a lot of soup, have three containers in the chest freezer downstairs for last second meals! thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This chicken soup was awesome and easy to make!  For the most part, I stuck to the original recipe.  However, because I was lacking a few ingredients such as tomato soup and whole peeled tomatoes, I made a few substitutions with tomato bisque soup and 2 diced tomatoes.  I also added an extra can of dark red kidney beans for texture and flavor.    We also sprinkled the soup with cheese and fritos.  Yummy!

This recipes was FANTASTIC! I'm not typically a fan of spicy foods but this was amazing. Had a little kick but had such great flavors that I didn't mind. I followed the directions exactly minus the whole tomatoes. I'm no cook, and this recipe turned out great. Fiance went back for seconds, then thirds and ate it for lunch the following day! This is a keeper!

Many people asked for this recipe when I made it as a side recipe at a Pampered Chef Cooking Show. Followed the recipe to the T, no modifications at all. It makes a LARGE pot of soup, my group was 25 and there was still leftovers.

This soup is deeelish!  I made it today to use for dinner tonight.  I didn't have the exact ingredients used only four chicken breasts instead of 8.  Also instead of whole tomatoes and diced used just 1 28oz can of crushed tomatoes; instead of whole kernal corn I used creamed corn and a little Mrs. Dash southwest chipotle blend (about tsp) b/c somehow I'm out of black pepper.   Everything else kept as is (added the sour cream and shredded cheddar the last five minutes of simmering and threw some tortilla strips in there at the table).  Mmmmm...

I loved this soup! Very flavorful and I liked that their was shredded chicken in this soup. I am newly married and new to cooking, and this recipe was easy to make, and my husband loved it! We had tons of it leftover, and it still tastes great heated up.

I followed the recipe on point. Very good. Next time I make it, I'll skip the whole tomato, and maybe one less can of beans.  I also added some cilantro. Very very tasty!!!!

exceptional.  I added the tortilla chips from another recipe along with some grated cheddar cheese.  Probably the best soup I have made.  It makes a heck of a lot... if you don't have a number of folks to share it with, you might want to consider halving as others have mentioned.  thanks for sharing this recipe!

Oh my goodness! Made this for my hubby who doesn't care for chicken or soup. He loved it! My mom and sister stopped by that evening, needless to say they took the rest with them!! So yummy. To save on cost, I omitted the tomato soup and corn. I also did only diced tomatoes and no whole tomatoes. So yummy!

My boyfriend and I LOVED this soup!  I made a few changes. I baked the chicken seperately to make sure it would be extra tender. Half the sour Cream. Used 1 can of black beans and 1 can of pinto beans in lieu of the chili beans. Added 1 fresh jalepeno (chopped) and served with corn tortilla chips and shredded cheddar cheese on top! Delicious!

This is wonderful!  I have made this a few times and added extra veggies - like carrots, zucchini, whatever your heart desires.  I have some habenero salt and added a that instead of regular salt.  Wow!  I could have this once and month and be happy, happy!

OMG!!!  There is a reason this is a five star recipe.  It tastes wonderful and is healthy too!  My husband and brother both said that it was awesome.  I did like others and used diced tomatoes with green chiles in place of the regular diced tomatoes because we love spicy.  Also because I knew that I was going to let it simmer for a long time I didn't bother sauteing the onions and garlic I just threw it all together.  Another reviewer said she just boiled frozen chicken instead of thawing it out first and I did that too.  Worked great and saved time.  Yum yum!  Try this recipe.

OMG! This soup is amazing!! I don't rate very often, but I couldn't resist on this one. I am a HUGE soup fanatic, and this is by far the BEST I've had. I followed the directions accordingly, but used yogurt instead of sour cream as another reviewer suggested. I also omitted the whole tomatoes and added a can of spicy rotel for a nice kick. Thank you so much for this recipe!! :o)

My husband an I love this soup! That says a lot because I almost have to force feed him soup. Be warned if you make the full recipe be prepared to have a HUGE pot of soup. I halve it and cut back from three chicken breast to 2, there still ends up being plenty of chicken. The only other changes I make are leaving out the can of peeled tomatoes and can of condensed tomato soup and add a can of tomato paste. Thanks for a great recipe :)

Very Very Good!!! I took out the whole tomatoes. Its more like a chili then a soup, but I think its better that way. Makes a lot! I cut the recipe in 1/2 and I still had a lot. Even my nephew who is a very picky eater loved it! So it wasn't a big deal having lots of left overs. We ate it with Frito chips also. I plan on making this again. Maybe next time I will add noodles or white rice.. But, it still very good on its own! A+++++++

This was great! I made a very large batch, and it still didn't last as long as I expected simply because we couldn't keep out of it. I made a few alterations. First, I added  a bit of extra chicken broth since I'm cooking at a high altitude and the additional liquid helps make up for evaporation. We didn't have onion powder in the house, so I used an extra half cup of finely diced onion. I also used only canned diced tomatoes instead of canned diced and canned whole, and I added a can of black beans for color and volume. I also used plain fat-free yogurt instead of sour cream and cut back significantly on the olive oil to keep the fat content down. The finished product turned out fantastic, and I'll definitely be making it again.

Very good, I will make this again!  However, I changed it up a bit as others recommended. I used 1 can of diced tomatos, and 1 can of Hot Rotel (w/Habanero). Omitted the whole tomatos, and also used 1 can of chili beans, and 1 can of black beans. I didn't use the water from the boiled chicken, I substituted that with 5 cups of chicken broth. I also used 2 11oz cans of Mexicorn, and left out the sour cream. I added the sour cream to my bowl afterwards.   I might try hot chili beans next time instead of medium, just for a little more kick...

11/5/09 Update: This also works very well for Quesadillas. Simply drain as much of the liquid out of the soup as you can, then heat the mixture before adding to your Quesadilla with whatever other filling you may like. I just use shreddeed Chihuahua cheese. When served with sour cream for dipping, this is another way to enjoy this delicious recipe! Try it, I dare you... I bet you'll enjoy it! Hmmm, bet it would also make a great filling for Burittos, or Enchiladas that way too.

This was very good.  I used less chicken than was called for and I did not use the beer.  This is a great recipe that can be tweaked for your own personal preferences.  Highly recommend.

Great soup. The only thing I did differently was to use reduced sodium chicken broth in place of the water and bullion cubes. I did not add the salt either. I think in the future I will add more beans and corn - it makes a whole lot of soup and I ended up with a lot of broth left over after everyone scooped the goodies out of the bottom.

This is the amazingly the best chicken soup I've ever made or tasted - I wish there were more than 5 stars!  It's like a perfect mix between chicken chili and chicken tortilla soup.  The best part about it is that I have almost all of the ingredients on hand, it can be really healthy, and is filling!  My friend's loved it and asked for the recipe.  I followed the recipe as stated with a few minor changes:  I followed all of the measurements for the chicken broth with the addition of a small bay leaf.  It had the perfect amount of seasoning and would be great in any recipe that calls for chicken broth - so this is a keeper.  Then, the rest of the ingredients that incorportate the "soup": I used a can of diced tomato w/jalepeno (rotel) in place of the can of whole tomato.  I also added a packet of sazon and a few squeezes of Sriracha hot chili sauce to the mix for an extra kick.  I used no fat sour cream and it still tasted fantastic in this dish.  I will be making this often and next time I will also add black beans.  I dont think that there is a way that you can mess this recipe up - I've tasted the mix even before I added my own "tweeks" and it was still wonderful.

I love this recipe!  So easy.  I have made as written and it was great.  Another time I just substituted diced tomatoes for whole and omitted sour cream from pot but used on an individual basis.  I also usually double the chili powder now for my personal tastes and I use chili hot beans and medium salsa because I like spice.   The recipe as written must make 6-8 quarts.  If you leave out the sour cream, you are talking about 420 calories for 3-4 cups of soup (1 serving).

I made this when my honey was out of town knowing he doesn't like white meat chicken.  Unknown to me, he found it in the fridge and told me he thought it was excellent.  He's in the food industry and knows good food. We just finished off the last little bit and he wants me to make it again!

Yum! My boys and I loved this soup. Next time I'll use all diced tomatoes since I ended up dicing the whole tomatoes anyhow. Taste a bit like brunswick stew! Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

Great recipe.  I used chicken that I had previously cooked and added all of the spices that were to go into the broth.  Let cook for a short time and then added all the other ingredients.  The only other thing I changed was added 2 cans of seasoned tomatoes instead of the plain ones and added a 28 Oz. can of chopped tomatoes instead of whole.  My husband said it was the best soup I had made.  I definately will make it again.

Soooo good!  Me and my picky husband each ate two bowls of it!  I sauteed the onion & fresh garlic, then added the chx & dry seasoning (replcd chili powder w/ southwest ssn b/c I was out) & cooked til no longer pink.  Then I added the rest of the ingred and simmered for about an hour.  I also threw in diced red bell pepper and chunks of fresh zucchini from the garden.  I might add a can of black beans next time.  Served w/ french bread & butter.

Easy and healthy with no changes needed.  It is adaptable and I used mild beans and mild salsa and it was perfect for my taste.  My husband is a track and cross country coach and I will definitely be making this for the hospitality room on cold days.  I like this version much better than the taco soup with ground beef recipe I had.  Thanks!

I love this recipe. I accidentally added 16 oz. of sour cream instead of 8 oz. and it still came out delicious. There's plenty of flavor the way it is, but I added some home grown jalapenos to give it a little heat and it was perfect. Next time I make it, I plan on adding some black beans, possibly in place of one of the cans of chili beans.

No need to add salt at all as far as flavour is concerned.  Use no salt added tomatoes and I omitted the condensed soup for the same reason, although it needed longer cooking to reduce down, was a bit watery at first.  Very tasty.

I wanted this to be more of a spicy chicken chilli/stew, so I omitted the tomato soup and the canned whole tomatoes, and cut way back on the chicken broth. Apart from adding some Adobo seasoning, I made this pretty much as written. It turned out hearty and filling. It's easy to make, and I usually have all the ingredients in the cupboard. Thanks!

Yummy! We eat a lot of spicy food, and this was not very spicy to us, especially after adding sour cream. We even added a tsp of cayenne pepper.

I'm pretty sure this is the best soup I have ever tasted. It calls for a lot of ingredients, but it makes a lot of food and is totally worth it. I have made this twice and will make it many more times. Very good with homemade baked tortilla chips.

I made this soup out of left over chicken....Wow! Amazing! To save time I just cut the chicken into small pieces and because my husband doesn't like really spicy foods I only added 1 tbls of chili powder instead of 3. I'd recomend this recipe over and over again. Delicious!

Everyone loved this.  As another reviewer suggested, made the tortilla strips to go along with it.  Only had 3 bouillon cubes, so added 2 TBSP poultry seasoning to the water that just covered the 8 chicken breast halves and cooked 20 minutes.  While they were cooling, sauteed the onion and garlic till soft and clear; then added a jar of Newman's black bean and corn salsa, can of petite diced tomatoes, can of tomato soup and 2 cans of spicy chili beans.  Cut up the chicken and added along with the broth and about 10 ounces drained yogurt.  It was a very healthy hit at the family gathering!

This soup was so good. The only reason why I rated it a 4 is because I expected it to be more spicy, so I had to add some green hot sauce to it and it not only made it more spicy but also gave it a tangy flavor that I loved.

This soup rocked! I made some minor changes, cut back the chicken breasts to 5, used chilli ready tomatoes with green chiles, frozen corn instead of canned, and canned chicken broth. Fabulous!

This soup is great! I followed the advice of some others and used a crock pot to simmer and topped with sour cream at the end. However, I ended up putting the soup on the stove and mixing in sour cream. Follow the recipe as written, and the dish will be a hit.

Excellent soup! Like others, I played around with the seasonings some and the recipe made enough I was able to freeze for later. When I thawed it, I added rice, and the kids liked it even better!

Adjusted this for the crockpot, and it came out nicely. Saute onion and garlic in the olive oil ,reduce the water to 1.5 cups, add a can of beer. Add all ingredients including whole chicken breasts (can be frozen or thawed) and cook on low all day, then take out chicken and shred it. Mix shredded chicken back in soup along with the sour cream, cook for a half hour on high. I also added fresh cilantro and 1.5 tsp cumin, and omitted the cans of tomato soup and whole tomatoes. Quite good topped with shredded cheese and crushed tortilla chips.

Yummy!  I love the chicken tortilla soup at Panera, and since there is no Panera in my current town (a tragedy in its own right, but probably one that saves me money), I was looking for a good spicy chicken soup recipe.  This one is different than Panera's, but still tasty.  I like that it's pretty adaptable--different veggies or different beans would all taste great.  I don't care for tomatoes, so I left out all of them (except the soup), and it still tasted great, though it was probably a bit more brothy-looking than it might have been otherwise.  But it has great flavor, and that's the most important part!

Very simple and very tasty.  My only change was I used only 6 chicken breast halves instead of 8 and it was plenty.  Next time I may add a can of black beans also.  I will definitely make this again.

The soup was ok.  I definitely made a lot of changes (many of which were suggested by other viewers).  Used a lot more spices and still did not consider this soup to be spicy.  Added a lot more onion and corn, a jalapeno, spanish paprika, to name a few.  This recipe definitely makes a lot; much more than 8 servings.  I ended up freezing half the soup I made.

My husband's marine buddies came in for a weekend. I thought something hearty would be good for these "manly men."  they loved it. It makes tons, so I took the leftovers to work. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.   I hate the people that leave comments about changing the recipes, but I have to say this... It calls for a lot of chicken. the next time I make this I will use 1/2 of the chicken the recipe calls for. It was not "soupy" enough. I also would either use chopped canned tomatoes instead of the whole. I also added other mexican seasonings to taste. Cumin, cilantro, mexican chili powder ect.   I am rating this a 4. I am my own critic and I didnt like the soup at all. However, EVERYONE ELSE LOVES IT!

Yum!! I made a few delicious and easy alterations. I sauteed the chicken with onions and peppers (cut into fajita like strips) with the garlic and dry herbs until a little blackened like fajitas. In another pan i mixed 1 can of black beans (undrained), 1 can of corn, and 2 cans rotel diced tomatos with chiles. I didn't have tomato soup, so I used a can of enchilada sauce instead. Then added the fajita mix to the soup and wala! Cheese, green onions and chips on top make it superb!

This recipe deserves 10 stars!  I used chicken broth instead of the water and chicken bouillon.  I only made half of what the recipe calls for, but wish I hadn't, because I bet this freezes well.  Will probably make another batch this week :)

so good! this recipe will be permanently magnetized to my fridge for easy access. I took chef 101's advice and cooked the chicken with onions & garlic then added herbs & spices and finally the canned goods (using only one can of tomato and frozen corn instead of canned). It turns out rather thick - more like a chicken chili. I suppose broth could be added if someone wanted it more soup-like, but it's so perfect without. So easy! and Amazing!

This recipe is one of my favorites!  I have tried tweeking it, but I always return to the original.  It is excellent just as it is.  Be aware, however, that the orignal produces a large quantity of soup, so you may want to adjust.  We made it for our New Year's Party and even though it was a big hit, we still had enough left for 3 more meals!

Left out the whole tomatoes.  Cut the chili powder in half.  Very good -- need to try to cut the salt down -- low sodium bouillon cubes or broth?

Just made this for a Holiday party - HUGE hit!  I took the advice of previous reviewers and reduced the tomato content (didn't use the condensed soup), and used the sour cream as a topping along with shredded cheese and tortilla chips.  Guests loved it.  Thank you!

This is a very good recipe, especially on a cold winter day.  We ate it with chips, kind of like a tortilla soup.  The ingredients mix very well and create a wonderful taste.

My husband and I love spicy food and this soup totally hit the spot!  It made plenty for the two of us so we froze about half of it.  It is essentially a chicken chili soup...and it is great!

Great flavor used fresh salsa and added can of Black Beans.  A little on thin side may add some more tomatos next time. Appearance was not the best but flavor made up for it.  Thank you will definitely make again

I improvised a bit to make a smaller portion. Also didn't need oil as I cooked chicken, onions & garlic in water with seasoning. Shredded chicken and added that and the liquid (along with some more liquid) to rest of ingredients. This was so good and so simple! We ate with tortilla chips... my daughter stuffed herself silly. ***I just realized I forgot to add the sour cream! Super tasty so I doubt I'll add next time I make this as it certainly didn't need it.

I made this last night and it was almost ten o'clock before it was done, but I ate it anyway heartburn be darned! Loved it! I put extra sour cream, shredded chesse and tortilla chips on top. I am thinking this would be good with polish sausage or shrimp also.

This is absolutely delicious. My husband and I couldn't stop eating. Simmering the chicken is key and makes the shredding process so easy - it literally falls a part. It's a great meal for lunch and dinner. I wouldn't change any ingredient.

We like this soup in the fall and winter. I don't add the sour cream to the soup, that makes it really low fat and healthy. I have added a little low fat sour cream to our individual servings. It's good both ways

I was absolutely impressed by the flavor of this soup!!  Totally easy to make...I boiled the chicken according to the directions and satueed it with the onions and garlic.  I omitted the whole tomatoes and one tsp. of chili powder and it was still plenty spicy!  I was afraid that it was going to be too salty and then I added the sour cream, which completely cut the saltiness.  Great recipe!

This soup is fantastic!  I have made this recipe 8 times over the past year and I love it every time!  A couple things I change every time:
- Always leave out the condensed soup, makes it taste like it came from a can!
- add a jalapeno pepper or other hot seasonal pepper from the garden, it is called "spicy" after all!
lastly, something I struggle with time and time again, I've done it with and without, but just so you all know -- it tastes just as amazing without the sour cream and lowers those calories like you wouldn't believe!  If you are going to use it, go full-throttle b/c the low fat & fat free versions texturize the soup and make it slightly strange.  Everyone loves it, add what you have in the kitchen or garden, leave out what you don't have.   This is my all time go-to recipe for potlucks, company, and just to impress the family!

This recipe is wonderful!!!  I just found it a month ago and have already made it twice and it is still hot outside!!  I use hot salsa, and hot 
ro-tel tomatoes because my husband loves spicy food! It freezes very well and  tastes great leftover (and I don't usually eat leftovers).  Thanks for sharing!!!

Great for crock pots! I used a whole jar of salsa, extra chicken (uncooked), added tex mex bean salad (beans, corn, tomatoes, spices, ect) from the deli,and I used chicken broth instead of water. I threw it all in and simmered it on low, adding sour cream when I served it. 
For leftovers, I used the chicken in wraps with a chopotle sourcream, lettuce, tomatoes, onions and tomato tortillas. Yum, Yum! The chicken is so tender from the crockpot.

VERY GOOD SOUP!!! I used all fresh tomatoes and made "Fresh Tomato Salsa" from AllRecipes for this soup. I put everything in a crockpot for 6 hours on high, shredded the chicken, and continued cooking for 2 more hours.

yummy but Way less spice (maybe 2 tsp chili powder). Don't add any salt.  Pureed beans was a good way to get more fiber in there.

so, i incompletely read the recipe.  as a result of my incompetence, i added less beans (though i did use a mixed can), and none of the diced tomatoes.  i did however add some extra corn, a green pepper finely diced, and about 2-3 cups cooked rice.  very nice.  it looked questionable when the chicken was cooking, the broth looked mucky, but it turned out nicely.  next time i would also probably cook some mushrooms.  a little oregano would be nice too.  if you had some chipotle peppers, or even chipotle powder, that would add a beautiful flavor.  my dude loved it.  serve it with crusty bread.  will definitely make again.

This soup was wonderful! I even forgot to add the sour cream (which was actually in my favor, since I sure don't need the extra fat!). I would highly recommend this to friends and family... and I will SURE make it again!

I made this last night and it was awesome. I made a couple changes: had to use a can of chicken with the breast, added 1 potatoe, a little more salsa, diced tomatoes with chilis, used onion flakes instead. This recipe is still delicious reheated!

I made this for dinner last night. I served it with cheese quesadillas. It was delicious. My husband is very picky and he loved it. I gave a container full to our neighbors because it makes a ton. they loved it too. She called me for the recipe right after. The only thing that I would change is I do not think it is necessary to use so much chicken. I used 6 breasts and it was still way too much. I had about two and half breasts left over. I did not use the exact amount of spices I just added things to taste. During the last 10 mins of simmering I added about 2 cups of shredded cheese.. YUM! Definitely will make this again, but most like half the batch!

excellent!! The only thing I changed up a bit is instead of putting all the tomato ingredients in I just opted to put in one can of petite diced tomatoes and the 1 can of tomato soup.  I cooked it all as directed except I put the finished soup in the crock pot set to warm(low) and the last 30 min before we ate added the sour cream, and it was delicious. Thanks for the recipe.

We LOVED this soup!  It was fabulous and authentic tasting.  There's only two of us eating this so I just used 2 chicken breasts, half a jar of Pace salsa, one can of diced tomatoes, one can of black beans, half a bag of frozen corn, a proportionate amount of the seasonings in the recipe and eye-balled how much broth to add.  I think it might have been about 3 1/2 cups.  Altogether it made enough for at least 6 servings!  And we're glad there was so much leftover because it is WONDERFUL the next day.  I found the spiciness to be perfect.  It wasn't offensive to my husband who doesn't like his food hot but it left a pleasant heat in the back of the throat as it went down.  I love this recipe and I intend to share it with everyone I know who loves to cook!

I scaled it down to 3 servings and it was enough for me and my boyfriends dinner that night, lunch the next day and a little in the freezer. It comes out to be a ton! 
for the broth, I substituted chicken broth for the bouillons, added 2 cloves minced garlic for the powder, dried minced onions for the powder and no salt. Also 2 chicken breasts is way enough. For 3 servings I only put 2/3 canned beans, 1 14oz diced tomato, 7 oz frozen corn, 1/2 of the salsa, and left out the soup, whole tomatos, and sour cream. 
Turned out great, and tastes better each time its reheated!

Yummy yummy yummy in my tummy tummy tummy. And I made it vegan. This was the best soup recipe I have tried. (I’m a beginner). Anyway… my wife and kid loved it. And we shared some to our neighbor and it got great reviews.
The changes I made. Two packs of  firm tofu, Boullion was s “better than bouillon,” vegan sour cream from the local health food store. – everything else was the same.
I adjusted the cooking time because I was in a hurry and because there was no chicken. This recipe is absolutely a Wow!

Made this during cold/flu season and it was a big hit. I would cut back on the amount of chicken slightly though, it's pretty hearty, more like a stew.

I only use 4 bouillion cubes to cut down on the sodium a little, I also use 1 can of black beans, 1 can of canellini and use another can of chopped tomatoes instead of the whole.  Fantastic recipe, love this soup.

I halved the recipe. It was really tasty & filling. Used Rotel in place of the hot sauce - Had a Beer Butt Chicken that I needed to do something with. Put the carcass in water for just a little while to make the broth. This added so much flavor. Good stuff - Thanks!

yummy!  I made a few changes since these ingredients were what I had on hand.  I used the canned Ro-tel choped tomatoes with peppers and i used chili beans that were already spiced in the can.  I used the spices as recommended in the recipe.  I also cut up the chicken as it cooked since I was in a hurry and it took much less than the time mentioned to cook.

This was very good!!! Not spicy to me at all, only thing i would do next time is leave out the whole tomatoes....i ended up chopping them up before i put em in because it just didn't look right. other than that it was delicious......but watch out IT MAKES A TON!!!! I think mine made about 3-4 servings more than it said. Thanks again!

YUM!  We loved it.  Left out the whole tomatos, it just didn't seem like a good idea.  We did not find it spicy, in fact I added more chili powder.  Next time I might use medium salsa.  This is great and I cannot wait to make more and serve it to others.

This recipe is a keeper! My suggestion would be to submit Hunts Fire Roasted tomatoes with garlic for the diced AND the whole tomatoes. Also to use a rotisserie chicken because they tend to be more juicy and makes cook time a LOT faster. Super yummy! My family loved this and it does make a ton and is even better the next day! I will be making this again and again! Thanks!

Great recipe.  My husband and I liked it alot.  I made it all in one pot except for cooking the onions and garlic in a skillet with the olive oil.  I thought it was going to be very spicy with all the chili powder but it wasn't.  I used 2 cans of roasted tomatoes with garlic and skipped the cans of whole tomaoes.  I substituted cannelini beans for the chili beans listed.  Also added a tablespoon of sugar to cut the acid of all the tomatoe ingredients.  Think I will add a little cayenne pepper next time to kick it up a bit.

This was fantastic!  I used a rotissere chicken that I made the night before.  Not too much kick, but abounds in flavor!  I used some corn chips when serving, and even my picky teen came back for more!  Beware, it does make a lot!

Not as good as I was hoping based on the other reviews :(  I'll continue to play with the recipe, since I think it has good potential.

this recipe is glorious. I have made it several times adding my own flair to the dish but it always turns out because it is a super easy dump recipe. I always add extra veggies (whatever I have in the fridge)and change the types of beans I use in the soup. The only thing  Itend to leave out is the can of whole tomato, I do not find it neccessary and do not like the large chunks. Top of with a dollop of sour cream, cilantro, and shredded cheese....perfection!

Great! Great! Great! I did not use the whole tomato. I used one can of black beans in place of one can of the chili beans. A huge hit.

One of my favorite soup recipes of all time.  Chicken prep can be used for any soup with chicken.  I tried it with chicken noodle and it came out great.

Great recipe.  I used 1/2 bone in thighs (cooked and then shredded)  and 1/2 breast.  I also used reduced fat cheese and sour cream (added at the end) and it didn't detract from the taste at all.  Served with a handful of tortilla chips.....OUTSTANDING!!

This was an amazing recipe.  Great comfort food.  I did tweak it a bit.  I added a can of tomatoe paste towards the end of the cook time.  I felt it was a bit watery and needed some substance. Also I did not add as many beans.  I added one small can of red kidney beans abd one small can of cuban black beans, a frozen bag of corn instead of canned.  I added hot salsa (mrs. renfros) very good, added quite a bit of heat.  Will definitely make this again.

This one wasn't a favorite.  I followed the directions exactly...just wasn't the best.  Maybe it was the salsa I used because for the most part that is all I could taste...it tasted like salsa soup.  Not bad just not great.

This was a very good soup.  Like many others, I did not put in the sour cream.  Served it on the side.  I also didn't put in the tomato soup.  This reminded me of Sopa Azteca - a mexican soup.  I served it with tortilla chips (baked in the oven) and cheese and avocado.  It was a nice soup for a winter night with a sick hubby.

Yummy!  I cut the recipe in half, and didn't use the whole tomatos.  Any cans that called for 1/2 I put in the whole thing.  It was awesome!  Thanks!

Awesome!  Perfect blend of spices.  After I added the rest of the ingredients and shredded chicken, I put the whole mixture in the crockpot and let it cook on high for an hour or so then on medium until we were ready to eat it.  I'm glad it made a lot because now I have leftovers!

This has wonderful flavor, though I think the chili powder could be cut back (that's mostly what mine tasted like).  I will be making this again though.  We topped it with toasted tortilla strips, yummy!

This was delicious!  We added the sour cream separately at the end.  This saved even more calories and fat.  I served it homemade tortilla chips.  I will be making this one again.

I chose to make this recipe for a friend of mine just getting over a cold and made a mad dash to the store for the ingredients. It is delicious, but whoaa, it makes a ton! I actually made it exactly as directed and was surprised at how nicely it all came together. Thank you for sharing your wonderful recipe Catherine! **Update**  My husband just ate 3 heaping bowls of this and said it was the best soup he has ever tasted. He told me I had better get back on here and change my 4 star rating to a 5. I have to agree. It gets better with every bite.

This soup was so good the night of and the next day! I made a few changes as I did not have all the ingredients. For the tomatoes, I used one can of diced tomatoes and 2 cans of stewed tomatoes (which I cut up to smaller pieces). For the beans I used one can of kidney beans and one can of plack beans. I also used 4 frozen chicken breasts instead of 8 and it was plenty! Next time I would also add okra. We served with tortilla chips on top - very tasty! It had the perfect amount of spice but may be too spicy for some. Will make many more times!

Excellent recipe. I didn't use quite as much of the saved broth to keep this a little thicker. We omitted the sour cream and it tasted great without it. East to make and the whole family loved it!

I usually drop the whole peeled tomatoes, but do the rest by the book, and it always gets rave reviews!  I love it and my boyfriend always asks me to make it.  :)  I always save the extra broth it makes for starters in my other chicken recipes.

Great recipe!From my experience, and after reading other reviews, this recipe allows for many adjustments to personal tastes. It's a very forgiving recipe if you don't have an ingredient or two, which was what happened with me today. I was *hoping* to cut down the recipe a tad bit by only using 5 chicken tenderloins, 4 c. water, 1 can diced tomatoes, 1 can stewed tomatoes, 1 4.5 oz can diced green chiles (my husband ate the salsa), 1 can corn, 1 can light red kidney beans, 1 can mild chili beans, 1 can tomato soup and some sour cream. The spices and seasonings are also easily adjusted- I ended up adding more boullion, cayenne pepper, seasoned salt, and black pepper. Although I love the soup with the sour cream in it- next time I think I'll either use less or just add it to the top. Like other reviewers, I sauted my onion and garlic first in EVOO, then added my chicken and simmered for about 45 minutes. Overall, very good and easily adjustable to desired level of spiciness.

My huband and I make this about twice a month, we love it so much.  We pretty much keep it the way it is with the exception of one can of black beans and one can of spicy chili beans.  We also aren't fans of the whole tomatoes so we use 3 cans of diced tomoatoes with green chiles.  It is one of the best recipes I have found.

The fact that we, very amateur cooks, could make this and it turned our divine is a testament to how amazing this recipe is. We couldn't get enough of it. And knowing it was healthy made it taste even better (although it's very hard to believe how healthy it is since it tastes so good). We used petite cut zesty tomatoes for the peeled and diced and medium hot chili beans. Also used a medium salsa. The spicyness was perfect. Not sure if you need the whole tomatoes?? Maybe that's a very amateur thing to say. But not sure how they added anything except that they looked pretty. We also cut this recipe down to 3 servings and it fed my very hungry fiancé and I with enough for one serving of leftovers. THANKS FOR THIS RECIPE!

Mmm!  We were munching on this one for days!  I made a few changes, however:  I used 1 28oz can of Muir Glen Fire Roasted tomatoes instead of the 2 cans diced/one can whole; I used "fresh" salsa in a tub from the grocery; I topped the finished soup with sour cream instead of mixing it in; I used 1/2 package of Trader Joe's Fire Roasted corn instead of the canned corn; about 1 cup of cooked rice, which I tossed in near the end to warm it up; 1 drained and washed can of regular black beans; and used chicken stock instead of the buillon, which I didn't have on hand.  It freezes and refrigerates well and for a house of 2, we were able to stretch this for work-lunches and sides for dinner for about a week without getting tired of it.  Too yummy!

This was so awesome! The chicken was so tender and yummy I'd make it any day of the week.  I only used one big can of diced tomatoes and 1/2 of a container of sour cream and it was great. Thanks Catherine!

We loved this soup, although we only used four chicken breasts as others suggested.  It makes a HUGE amount and is great reheated.  Very tasty and filling, thanks for the great recipe.

Very good soup!  It took a little more work to shred the chicken than I expected, ended up needing to cut and shred simultaneously.  I didn't have onion powder, for some reason, so I used minced onion and it worked well.  I transferred the chicken out, shredded it, and put it in another bowl ... then poured the chicken stock into a measuring cup, used the same pot for browning the garlic a little (didn't have to use oil at all that way) and transferred everything back so I didn't dirty another big pot (I have to hand clean those and I am a little lazy).  We ended up with 10 - 2 1/2 cup servings.  Froze most of it in individual servings (thaws well in microwave).  There is a LOT of chicken in this soup - makes it very satisfying!  My husband topped his soup with cheese (shredded sharp cheddar) and I with sour cream, just yummy!  There is even enough leftover chicken stock to make a squash soup or something!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very tasty and satisfying. I had cooked chicken, so I cut way back on the water. Added a bit of cumin to add a tex-mex kick. Great with cruch tortilla chips on top too.

The chicken was incredibly tender and delicious -- I almost wanted to stop the recipe right there and just eat the chicken!  WOW -- I will be making just the chicken like this again for sure.  I didn't have chili beans so I used 1 can of dark red kidney beans and 1 can of mixed beans (chick peas, black eyed peas, etc.). Make sure you have a huge pot -- my biggest pot was barely big enough to hold everything.  This is so delicious!!!  For me it is actully two recipes in one. I cannot rave enough about how falling-apart tender and delicious the chicken was.  I can't wait to make chicken dinner next time.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!!!

This soup is excellent!!!   I followed the directions to the T and could not be more pleased with the results.  I used medium salsa, so there was just enough spice to it.  I also used flour tortillas, cut in strips and fried till crisp in olive oil to top it.  Will be serving this often in the future!  (Makes plenty for leftovers or if you have company coming too!)

I did this exactly as written, except I didn't use parsley. Next time I will do it with frozen corn. Also, I used HOT chunky salsa.

This is without question, one of the best recipes I have made in my 37 years on this earth. If you are wondering whether this recipe will live up to the reviews..I wondered the same. No longer. This soup has excellent taste and texture. The chicken tastes GREAT!

Amazing!  I only used 4 large chicken breasts which was plenty.  I cut back the water to 1 1/2 quarts and kept all of the spices the same.  I garnished the soup with shredded cheese, chopped fresh cilantro and a dollop of sour cream.  So glad to be eating leftovers of this yummy soup!

My husband and I loved this soup.  In fact, this is the first time he has given a five-star rating to a homemade soup!  I omitted the can of whole tomatoes and one can of beans, and I used black beans instead of chili beans.  For the diced tomatoes, I used the kind with green chilis.  I topped each bowl with a dollop of sour cream, instead of adding it to the pot.  This soup couldn't be easier to make.  Awesome!

Thanks for sharing this one!  It has become a family favorite. I make it in large batches ( don't ya just love allrecipes and the magic serving calculator?) It  puts together fairly quickly for a soup- and freezes without any loss of quality.

YUM! Very good soup! I leave out a few things in this soup, as it makes ALOT and fills up my pot fast. I leave out the can of whole tomatos, 1 can of beans, 1 can of diced tomatos. But this is just me, the rest of the recipe is great!!

I scaled the chicken breast back to 3 large breasts and it was plenty. I also left out the whole tomatoes and put the diced tomatoes in the blender for about 20 seconds because my husband doesn't like chunks of tomato. The soup was fantastic and after feeding 2 adults, 5 kids and a baby ... there was still enough to freeze for a whole other meal.

Awesome soup!  I forgot to buy the can of whole peeled tomatoes and the chili powder.  I peeled tome cherry tomatoes and substituted the chili powder for Tapatio+pinch of cumin+pinch of oregano. Used a can of pinto beans with sliced jalapenos.  Turned out really well.  My husband loved coming home to warm soup.  The chicken was juicy too!

The whole time I was cooking this my family complained that they woulnd't like it, that it would be too spicey, one even said he had heartburn just smelling it... but once it was in their bowls and they tried it, they were loving it! It got rave reviews at my house.
I used 10 chicken tenderloins and it was enough chicken.  We topped it with the sour cream instead of me putting it in the soup.  Also topped with sour cream and tortilla chips.  Delish!

This was really good! It did remind me of chili, which was interesting, since it was the middle of July when I made it!! :) It also makes a HUGE amount, but we will be having leftovers tonight!

Great, mixed it up with different canned beans and tomatoes with chiles.  Spicy, really spicy, but great with an extra dollop of sour cream.

Very good!  Personally I will cut back on the tomatoes next time though and maybe kick up my spices.  Mine came out more sweet than spicy.  Makes a ton of soup and there is SO much chicken in it.

My family thrilly enjoyed this recipe, as with anything I cook I deviated from the orignal. I used more vegtables (spinach, peas, carrots, green beans, zucchini). Next time I will use less chilli powder, but overall it was very good.

WOW! I just made this and I can't believe how amazing it tastes.  I didn't add the chilli powder at all because I added fresh Jalepenos to the stock and I omitted the can of whole tomatoes. It turned out perfect. Just spicy enough!

Left out the whole tomatoes and tomato soup, and I still thought this had too many tomatoes in it.  I used 6 breasts, which was plenty of meat.  Not as spicy as I was expecting (and we used hot chili beans and medium salsa plus all 3T of chili powder).  Nice soup with cornbread.

This is a delicious soup with a kick-- and SO easy!  The canned ingrediants are what really make this an easy recipe.  I made the original recipe, which says it serves 8.  I ended up giving big bowls of it to several co-workers and my boyfriend ate it for many many meals the week I made it.

I also made a pan of cornbread to go with it.  I highly recommend it!

Delicious! Just what the doctor ordered for my clogged up sinuses. I used frozen turkey that I had leftover, for the can of whole, peeled tomatoes I used Rotel, used black beans instead of chili. I used spicy salsa. With using the already cooked turkey this was pretty quick and easy to throw together! Thank you for sharing.

This was excellent! I did , however , add one thing. After it was done I added 2 cups shredded Colby jack cheese and cooked and stirred till melted. I topped each bowl with French fried onion rings.

Love this soup. I first had it at my daughter's. It reminded me of the chowder we used to have at my aunts. 
I used rotisserie  chicken and substituted another can of diced tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes.

Delicious and hearty! It needs some cheese, and also the sour cream really tamps down the spice. I would definitely add some tabasco sauce and serve with bread!

I used a small bag of frozen corn instead of canned. Also too much chicken in comparison to the broth ratio. Next time I will try 5 large or 6 small breasts. I used only 7 breasts and it soaked up too much broth.

Super soup!  It is a delicious meal.   The recipe would have made entirely too much for two people, so I cut it in half, making it in my crockpot.  I omitted the tomato soup due to the sugar and salt content of it and used 'no salt added' vegetables.  The soup was flavorful enough without the tomato soup or the salt.  Even with it being summertime we enjoyed it.  This is a keepie...I'm looking forward to making it again when the weather here in Florida cools down.

Great ideas for spicing up blandish leftover chicken soup.  I’m single so I usually have a lot left over of one of my favorite go to dishes.  It’s great to see what u can do with leftovers too and get a whole new dish out of it!! Always looking for a “refurbishing” idea for leftover.

Fantastic doubled the batch.  Store rotisserie chicken, add for last 1/2 hour or so.  Skip the soup, used chicken broth in place of water.  Also added carrots and celery and some crushed red pepper (careful).

Another name for this is chicken tortilla soup. The flavors are all Tex Mex style. Though I don't use condensed tomato soup but use a small can of tomato sauce and it tastes great with just one can diced tomatoes or Rotel. They

This makes a LOT of soup. The recipe says 8 servings, but it's probably more like 20+. 

Half a batch feeds my family for a week... happily.

Spice level was not super spicy. Perfect for us.

This is a hearty soup. Almost like stew. Save all extra broth to add for folks who can’t get enough of the liquidity part of the soup.

Be sure to make extra, it reheats great.

I am NOT a cook and only dabble in making my own food.  But after ordering out one too many pizzas I wanted to make food for the family at home.  I'm also kind of picky taste wise.  I substituted black beans for the beans in the recipe because I'm not a bean eater but i will tolerate black beans in burritos.  This was pretty labor intensive for me but very very easy to follow.  And the family liked what Dad made.....score!  I'd highly recommend this.  I'd also like to know if anybody has made it and froze the leftovers.  Can this be put in the freezer?

Really quite excellent.  All I did was add a seeded and chopped jalapeño while sautéing the onion and garlic.  My husband loves it.  A lot like posole but less than half the work!
Oh, and I made it without the sour cream and let the eater add however much they wanted.

My family and i loved this. i used our homemade salsa which is a little spicy so i reduced the chili powder to 2 Tbl. and it was fine. it made a lot for a family but happily for me we had leftovers for a couple of days and it was better and better.  i'll definitely be making this again.

I've made this soup for years. I make it slightly different after making it for so long. I now drop a cooked Rotisserie chicken from the grocery store into the broth instead of the 8 chicken breast halves. I leave it in the broth for 15 minutes boiling and then remove it and shred it and then add it and the broth to the mix. It saves a lot of time and still tastes super yummy!

This is one of the best soups EVER!  I’ve been making it for over 10 years and never posted about it!  It can be a little time consuming, but so worth it because it makes a lot and i always freeze leftovers.  The flavors are so perfect and it’s got a little kick to it, but definitely not hot.  This soup I’m making today for a cold rainy day tomorrow!

Love this soup, and I normally don't bother with soup. Read some of the modification people do, It's very accommodating, you can tweak it as you like, we like to put the sour cream on the soup after it's served, I cut back on the chile pdr as my wife doesn 't like it to overwhelm the soup. We use different bean with each batch. I bag of frozen corn.  It's really good no matter how you put it together, try it.

Whenever  I   buy  a whole roasted chicken there is a lot left over.  I stumbled upon this recipe and noted that I had most of the ingredients   on hand.  I was out of garlic and simply  used garlic salt  For  lack of tomato soup I used the entire can of peeled tomatoes.  Instead of chili beans I used black beans.  Since the chicken was already cooked I reduced the cooking time to 30 minutes.  Didn't add salt until I tasted it.  I topped each serving with  Kraft Mexican  grated cheese, a dollop of  sour cream and a few drops  of hot sauce.  Day's  later  my wife and daughter  are still raving about it.

Husband loved it.  I only did 6 chicken breasts, and that was plenty of meat (and I’m a meat eater).  I think I’ll like it tomorrow.  Seemed a little sweet to begin with.  Heat is growing.

This soup ("chili") has replaced the beef chili I made for decades. It's become a favorite. I simplify the recipe by using one to two bags of Tyson frozen pulled chicken breast and add 5-6 cups chicken broth. I follow the recipe otherwise and brown the oil, onion and garlic. Then, add remaining ingredients.  Easy!

Will make again! Heartier (with the tomatoes) than many tortilla soup recipes and easy to adapt to your tastes. I followed the recipe and it wasn't too spicy, but I served it with jalapeño peppers for those wanting an extra kick.

This was really good!  However, I omitted the tomato soup, doubled the corn (personal preference) and added 2 Tbsp cumin, 1 Tbsp oregano and about 1/2 Tbsp each of onion and garlic powder.  I didn't drain the tomatoes (probably should have), so I only used 4 cups of broth.  Instead of adding the sour cream to the soup, I dolloped some in each bowl at the end.  Served with avocado, cilantro, and cheddar cheese.  Very tasty!

Soup was good. Easy to prepare.   Thinner than I would have liked.  I left out the whole tomatoes just because I am not that crazy about tomatoes.

SO DELICIOUS! I used rotisserie chicken, added celery and cayenne pepper, and it’s one of the best soups I’ve ever had, definitely the best I’ve ever made myself!

Most excellent.  Friends loved it!  Will definitely be on my go to, large batch list!  Was great refrigerated for days and also in the freezer.  BUT, neither lasted that long ... consumed too quickly!

didnt put sour cream in it - that would have made it creamy - thinking the recipe didn't really call to add that in - the pictures don't show it.  Also put a little less chili powder in it.  Kids loved it!

Did not have any tomato soup nor whole peeled tomatoes- used a large can of crushed tomatoes instead. Turned out great!

So good! A heartier soup. Almost chili like. I halved this recipe and it made a lot! I used 1 28oz can of whole peeled tomatoes and just chopped the tomatoes up while it cooked. I also used frozen corn instead of the can. Also, rather than using just the 5 cups of broth I used all of it to thin it out a bit. I think I’m going to try with white beans next time too just to see how that would work. I feel like I’m always cooking with red or black beans. Really delicious recipe. Great for a chilly day! Enjoy!

This was easy and tasty.  However, I would not call this spicy.  It could have used lots of red pepper and cayenne.  The condensed tomato soup throws off the taste a bit, even though I didn't use Campbell's.  I added poblano pepper and topped with cheese.

Whole family loved it.  I made it but left out the sour cream because I didn't have any.   Was delicious and have made it again a couple times.  Will probably not bother with the sour cream since it was a hit as is.

Easier yet - Instead of boiling the chicken I used my combo pressure cooker/ crock pot!   Pressure cooked chicken was done in 20 mins.  Meanwhile, I sauted onions and garlic.  When chicken was done I shredded it and took out all but 5 c broth;  put them along with the onion and rest of the ingredients back into the pot then used pressure cooker setting on low for 3 hours.

This is really good. If I had to do it again I would have used less broth for more a stew. I used a spicy salsa (Tostitos Habanero) so I didn't use the chili powder and it was plenty spicy. Great dish. Thank you!

This is really great as is!
I switched to chili tomatoes and put it all in the slow cooker for 4 hours rather than the 30 minutes of simmer time. I also skipped the sour cream as I didn't have any on hand.
I'd suggest a very large soup pot for this.  My slow cooker holds 6 quarts and I couldn't fit it all in.

Amazing soup! My boyfriend and I made it one night and he absolutely loved it. Has just the right amount of kick to it due to the chili powder. Due to how we were strapped for time, I cut up the chicken in cubes (added a bit of salt and pepper) and cooked them in the pan--this is so much faster if you do not have precooked chicken on you and don't want to spend too much time on cooking. I also cut down on the amount of onion by about half, and cut up I think two cloves of garlic instead, plus did not include the garlic power (personal preference). Overall, this was very tasty and I will definitely be making this again.

Excellent soup - we love spicy foods and this one hit a home run.  I try to leave out as much salt as possible in recipes, so I did make the following changes:  Used 5 c. unsalted chicken broth (instead of water/chicken bouillon) as 2 qts of water was  too much; used 2 cans Rotel no salt added tomatoes/green chilies, 1 can no salt added tomato sauce instead of soup, skipped the whole tomatoes and used frozen white corn (canned corn has salt too).  I found Bush pinto/kidney chili beans combo had lower salt than regular kidney chili beans.  I diced my chicken and did step 1.  In step two, I just added everything into a crockpot on low for 6-8 hours and it was delicious.  Using the crockpot to simmer always helps the flavors go through the food so much better.  I definitely will make again and have shared with my friends.

Delicious!  Not spicy at all so I added a few dashes of hot sauce to my individual bowl.  I think green beans would also be a nice addition - almost making it a spicy chicken vegetable soup.

This soup is very good.  After letting it sit for only 15 minutes  in the pot when done,  my first taste was ummmmm!  Easy to make due to all the  canned items.  I halved  the recipe.  Used half of a rotisserie  chicken and let it  cook for 15 minutes in   chicken  broth and all the dry spices.  The chicken fell off the bone!   Will  make  this again for sure.

I love the recipe and quantities, but I do substitute with fresh ingredients when possible. I especially avoid the canned ingredients and replace with items like fresh tomatoes (skin removed), homemade stock (cook chicken for soup and make stock in one go), boiled dry beans, and frozen corn.

Not a bad soup, per se, but I made it according to the recipes (no substitutions or omissions) and my husband and I both found it to be rather bland. We are both fans of fairly spicy food though, so our standards for "hotness" might be skewed.

This was perfect for me and my fiancée while feeling sick from the cold.  Definitely didn't plan on it making as much as it did but will make great leftovers.  Prep time should be a little bit longer.  Though I did make one modification.  Instead of chili powder I used Cheyenne powder for more kick!

I don't make homemade  soup often, but I love this one and make it fairly often.  I cut the recipe in half and use a whole rotisserie chicken, 2 cans of diced tomatoes (one with either roasted tomatoes or mild chilies), 32 oz of gluten free tomato soup, the salsa, beans, garlic, onions (I skip the corn).  It turns out like a stew and it's great with tortilla "scoops".  I'm sure I could thin it with some broth, but I like it thick.  I can prep it in the crockpot or on the stove depending on the day's schedule.

It's not what I'd call gourmet, but it was good. I took advice from several of the reviewers by using a rotisserie chicken and then doing it all in a slow cooker. Even with all the spices it still needed some extra hot sauce at the table. After a night in the fridge, it thickened considerably and will probably next be served on a bed of rice.

Great recipe.  I love spice and this has plenty of it!.  I followed several suggestions and cubed the chicken and boiled it in the water and spices (up to adding the salsa) for 20 minutes.  I then added everything else.  I substituted 2 cans of dice tomatoes with green chills for all the tomatoes, and added 2 cans of black beans and 1 can of chili beans.  Omitted the corn.  Makes a huge amount so if you cooking for 2-4 people, you may need to half the recipe.

I made this with four chicken breasts and two boneless thighs. It's certainly plenty of chicken, but I like a lot of meat in soups. I used two 32 oz cartons of chicken broth instead of water and bouillon. I chopped about 7 stalks of celery and sautéed them with the onion. I also used black and white beans instead of chili beans. This soup is delicious and not too spicy. I think I would actually add hot salsa and maybe some cayenne pepper to make it little more spicy next time.

Very good soup. I cheated and used a rotisserie chicken and cut back on the seasonings. I will make it again.

My mom used to make this soup back when I was a sophomore in high school. Now, as a sophomore in college, I've made it! The only thing that I don't like about this soup is that it has high sodium content that's very difficult to avoid. I omit the bouillon cubes, and it still tastes great. I also only use one can of diced tomatoes, chicken legs instead of breasts as they are cheaper, omit corn, and use one can of chili beans. You honestly don't need more than this. Using legs does take a lot more time though, since you have to separate it. You need a lot more time than you think to make this soup.

My soup making skills have not been spectacular by any stretch.  This is the first soup I made that was spectacular.  It is packed with flavor.  We found it to be very satisfying and definitely a main dish.  This will become part of the regular menu lineup.

My husband made this about a year ago and we just can't get enough.  We use 2 cans of corn instead of 1 for the starch.  If you like spicy soups this one does the trick.  It's fairly easy to make and only takes a little over an hour.  Perfect for office potlucks in a crockpot.

My family loved this soup.  I planned to add the sour cream at the end and I forgot. The soup was delicious without it so even though I'm a sour cream lover I don't think it's needed. I will make again soon.

Delicious soup! Easy and very tasty. I was looking for an alternative chicken soup, as I had a pot of chicken stock.  This was a nice switch from the typical chicken/vegetable soup.  As many others posted, I would save the sour cream until the end.

So I did the "allrecipe adjustment" for the serving size to 12, the original recipe is for 5 or 6 people I think, any who I have a family who likes going for seconds, alsol wanted to save some on the side as lunch for the wife and son who works, I made the recipe precisely as given, last step let it simmer for 30mins, I started cleaning up, proud watching the food simmer, I looked at the photos you guys posted, and the video. The video said 5 cups of broth?! I already poured out the broth! It should've been 10cups of broth, that adjustment should've been added to the ingredients location. Soup came up very dense. Good tho.

Very good.  I cut the recipe in half, used 3 chicken breasts, only 1 can of diced tomatoes, the whole can of tomato soup and 1/4 tsp. of cayenne.  I didn't have chili beans so used black beans.  I also used a lot more corn because I had it thawed out.  I let people use sour cream at their discretion.  Will make again!

I used a 6 quart Dutch oven for this recipe. Here is what I did and turned out amazing. 

I let the Dutch oven heat on medium high for about two minutes. Added about 3 Tablespoons of olive oil, add one whole chopped yellow onion with two table spoons of minced garlic. Once translucent, I added three large diced chicken breast pieces. Half way cooked through I added the spices for the meat to cook into adding the parsley as well, onion powder (salt and pepper to taste!).I added 1 can diced tomatoes (not 2) and about half of the whole tomatoe can and one condensed soup. Use hot pace salsa not medium for that kick! Once all sauces have been combined into the pot I followed with 1.25 cups of chicken broth NOT water. Let boil on high for about 5 - 10 minutes and simmered for about 30 minutes low to let the sour cream get creamy with soup texture. We added some more sour cream on top with tortilla crisps. Goes great with grilled cheese! My husband was hesitant about soup for dinner but loved it so much.

This soup is really good.  But the recipe is totally wrong about the cooking time.  How does 1 hour + 30 minutes + amount of time to cook onion and garlic = 30 minutes?

It was good, but will probably end up being a one-timer for us. I'm not sure why it has "spicy" in it's title as no one in our family thought it was spicy.

While everyone had a good meal, there were just several soups that we enjoy more.

I added taco seasoning, and a extra can of beans. I  also used the mild rotel instead of diced tomatoes. Next time I will get original rotel instead! I used leg quarters with thighs, more economical. As suggested I made my own tortillas. This recipe is great!

This is a great recipe.  I add okra and chili peppers to mine. Sometimes I add  a little Andouille sausage. At this point it becomes more of a gumbo.

This is one of the best soups I've ever made! We make it a couple of times a month in the winter and never tire of it. Anyone who has it wants the recipe and agrees it's one of the best soups ever.

Fantastic taste as ranked by several people with whom I shared! Quite a spin on chili perfect for cold winter months. Portions as listed make enough to feed two families(lol) be sure to plan according to your needs.

EXCELLENT SOUP!  I only changed a few things.  I only added 6 chicken breasts instead of 8 (I think 8 would've been too much chicken), I omitted the 1 can of whole tomatoes, and only used 2 TBS of chili powder (instead of the 3 that the recipe called for).  My kids are picky eaters & they loved it too!  THANK YOU for the fantastic recipe!

This soup really is spectacular! I can very easily see myself making this over and over again. I made a few changes to the recipe, some based off of other reviews and some on my own personal tastes. I replaced the diced tomatoes with Ro-Tel and the tomato soup with Mexican tomato sauce. Canned whole tomatoes were ditched entirely. I'm of the opinion that the spicier something is, the better, so I also added a chopped jalapeño into the soup.

Very good soup! If you make the broth from scratch, as suggested in directions, it takes about 1.5 hours total to make.  We are adding it into our routine!

Like others suggested I saved the sour cream for the table.  I also substituted RoTel tomatoes with green chilis for the diced tomatoes and fresh salsa for the jar.  Very good and sneaky hot.  Didn't start out tasting that hot but yet I sweating when I finished.  I'll definitely make this again.

This is my go to soup which is always requested when friends come over! It has such great flavor and is very easy to make!  To add a little more fullness, I add a chopped chipotle pepper in adobo sauce when I sauté the onion.

My boyfriend was getting sick and asked me to make him chicken soup. He cooks great without recipes. I know he loves spicy food. I made this for him and he LOVED it. He had 2 bowls and took it for lunch the next day. The next heavy rain day he asked me to make it for him again.

I really liked the flavor of this soup. Not too salty, and the spices didn't need any alterations. Because I had no tomatoes-only tomato sauce- I added some of that instead.  I had some real chilies in adobo, so I subbed 3 chilies for the chili powder (2 would have been spicy enough for most) and I liked the smoky chili flavor it added.

This was very good!  Made a huge quantity!  A little bland so spiced it up with a little Tapatio.  Very similar to Slow Cooker Chicken Taco Soup on this site which I think I like better.

Used eight chicken tenders and about eight cups water. All recipe spices. About 20 min. Makes awesome broth/poached chicken. Half onion, 3 cloves garlic, 1 1/2 tbls chili powder, large can tomatoes, all the broth, frozen corn and about a cup of homemade Pico. One can dark red kidney beans, no sour cream. Topped with shredded cheddar and tortilla strips. 8 corn, sprayed with Pam, one inch strips,400* 10 min. Still a bit spicy for kids. Would like rotel with habanero for adults.

My family does not care for traditional chicken noodle soup. I was looking for winter-time comfort and this us it!  I used rotisserie chicken and added a small can of diced green chili and only one can of beans. We serve with grated cheese, sour cream and fresh cilantro. Great flavor and super easy!

Just did this.  Excellent.  But I added an extra TBS of chili power and three fresh jalapeños during the garlic and onion sauté phase.  Gave it a nice extra kick.  Will definitely make again and add even more heat.  Obviously, I'm a chili head.

To save time, I put all ingredients into a roasting pan and baked the soup for a minimum of three hours at 325 degrees. I used fresh mango salsa from Costco, frozen corn, and then kept everything else as is. The chicken shredded very, very nicely. And the best part?  I freeze it so that I can enjoy this for lunch. And my dog LadyBug LOVES this soup and will try and climb onto my desk to get some chicken!  I never grow tired of this soup. It is excellent!

Super good! I only had 4 chicken breasts and it was perfect.. I also just used all the broth instead of measuring it out since it wasn't that much more... I also grabbed the fire roasted diced tomatoes but i don't think thats a big deal!! 5 stars no doubt!

This recipe is delicious. My only note is this:

BEWARE: The quantity is WAY more than 8 servings (it fills an entire large pot) and takes a lot longer than the 45 minutes as listed. It probably took me 2 - 2.5 hours to make. But still, well worth it.

This recipe was absolutely fantastic. I did a little adjusting, added some black olives and fresh salsa plus all the other ingredients. 8 chicken breast was quite a lot so my servings was about sixteen, but my family of five it was perfect for great leftovers.

My son loved this soup!  I didn't add all of the tomatoes the recipe called for and will puree what I did add since my family does not care for chunks of tomatoes.

This dish is awesome!  The only ingredient I changed was to substitute non fat plain yogurt for the sour cream.  I did use all the broth, almost 8 cups.  My husband is the cook of the family and a super cook I must say.  I was pleased that he went for seconds.  I shall make again.

Made to recipe with the only exception being the beans. I used one can black beans and one can white beans because I didn't have the chili beans. This was a great soup, easy to make and very flavorful. Paired perfect with cornbread and served with a little green onion on top. Will make again for sure!

At my house we love tasting food from around the world, and this is a take on the Mexican tortilla soup. I made small changes, I seasoned the chicken rather than putting the seasoning and it separate in the water, I find it holds the seasonings flavor better. Instead of 3 cloves of garlic I used about 3 tablespoons of minced garlic, didn't need the 2(14.5 oz) can peeled and diced tomatoes,I only used 1 can. used cayenne pepper since I didn't have chili pepper, and instead of chili beans I used 1 can of red beans. Topped it off with shredded sharp cheddar cheese, sour cream, scallions, and broken up pieces of tortilla chips(Which I forgot to add in my pic!)This was so excellent because of the those different types of flavors!! My Husband, kids and other relatives loved it very much. It was suppose to last 2 nights and was mostly done by the first day. Has been added to my collection of favorite comfort soups, Well make this again soon.

Was very excited to try this recipe as a base and change to suit our tastebuds...Did not add whole tomatoes or tomato soup as I felt it would overpower the taste of the soup. I did however want to bulk up the soup. I added 2 carrots, half a punnet of white mushrooms and 3 potatoes. Did not have parsley so I used sage instead. Hubby does not like bean so hence could not add those. The recipe did not state whether the salsa should be hot or not so I opted for hot and used 1.5 tablespoons of chili powder and 1 tablespoon of masala. O and we love having the bones so i used a braai pack instead. Personally I think that using the bones added to the flavor when boiling. I loved the way the reserved juices cut the tartness of the salsa to bring a perfect blend of tart and spicy and added depth to the flavor base. I added tons of Cilantro and bought Greek Yogurt to top but the smell was so inviting that we forgot to add it. Will maybe try it tonight with the leftovers. Will definitely do this again!!!

Amazing soup! I made it a little easier - instead of boiling the chicken I chopped it up and cooked until almost done and then added the onions and cooked a bit longer and then added everything else. Instead of the 5 cups of broth I just added 1-2 cups of water and it came out perfect. You could leave out the water and have it be more like a chili. I made this for work and everyone loved it.

This was delicious!  I made it exactly as written but halved the chili powder since 3 TB seemed liked a lot.  It was perfect.  I also didn't add the sour cream or shredded cheese until dishing the soup in bowls.  I will say it made WAY more than 8 servings.  We had enough for probably 12 people.  I just froze the extra.  Terrific recipe!

Tastes like chicken chili, but does taste good if you're in the mood for chili.  Certainly is a different take on chicken soup.  My family liked it and I've added it to my recipe box for occasional use. I made it as written but reduced the amount of liquid by 2 cups since my pot seemed to be getting too watery. I agree with another reviewer that it would be great over rice, as a gumbo, if you don't add the broth.  I did taste it before adding the broth and found it tasted very good.  For the next time I will not add the broth or whole tomatoes to reduce the very tomatoey flavor and serve the sour cream on the side just to limit calories. Although not a 5 star rating, certainly an overall thumbs up.  Just a minor point, my prep and cooking time took a full 1 1/2 hours.  Don't see how it could be done in much less time. thanks

I used most of the basic ingredients of this recipe. On top of that, I prepared it in the crockpot. Since I was preparing it for two adults and our two yr old, I had to adjust the servings. 2 cups water and cooked the chicken and seasonings for 90 mins, took the chicken out to shred, placed the rest of the ingredients, salsa, tomato soup, diced tomatoes, and chicken into the pot for the remaining time left. After coming in from the SNOW and COLD, this was right on time to warm us up. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This stuff is amazing! Followed the recipe pretty closely, but I probably added a little extra chicken and chicken broth, plus added a can of black beans. As some suggested, I used Ro-Tel crushed tomatoes with cilantro, etc. I only had a little parsley left so omitted that by necessity. I served crushed blue and yellow tortilla chips with it, plus yogurt or sour cream, white rice if anyone wanted it with rice, and some shredded Mexican cheese. This stuff is to-die-for! Mine made a huge batch, so it should be good for several meals. I plan to make this a regular in my household! Thanks, Catherine!

I made this super easy on myself and just threw everything into a crockpot in the morning.  The chicken breasts were frozen, but they cooked just perfect in the juices all day.  I just took out the chicken after it was done and shredded it up... sooo good!

Great!!!!! This soup had so much flavor.  I omitted the chili (because I didn't have any), and added potatoes (boiled) to it.  I cut the potatoes into small cubes.  Reaaaallly delicious! I will definitely make this again.

What a find!  Love this recipe!  I have used many different combinations for the  3 tomato ingredients - just use what you have around as long as the total ounces is the same. For the salsa, I have always used Pace brand - I find the flavor matches the overall flavor of the soup.

Amazing recipe and it tastes a million times better than the restaurants serving this dish.  It was so easy to make. My family loved it. I'd put off the sour cream and just set it on the side as an option but other than that, thank you for submitting this recipe. It was sooooo good.

This was delicious! I made it for my family, since I like to cook, and it tasted amazing. Although, I was a bit confused when it came to the broth and chicken, since I decided to get already cooked chicken. That broth made a lot more than was needed, too. Besides all of that, I still savored the taste when I got to eat it.

Soooo tasty on a cold Fall evening!  I read other reviews so used only diced tomatoes, less bouillon, and cut recipe in half. Makes LOTS of soup even halved -- Plenty for four, with leftovers!

SO GOOD!! My version: I only used petite diced tomatoes. I don't add the sour cream because I freeze the soup. Then I add sour cream to each bowl individually when it's served. I eat it with 'scoop' tortilla chips instead of a spoon. I also keep frozen shredded chicken in the freezer so when I make this soup I can skip the 'work' part of the chicken prep and just add everything to the pot, simmer, and eat.

I just made this for lunch, and it is really good!!  I will make this often with leftover chicken, as I did today.  Very easy and such a nice blend of flavors.  It uses ingredients I usually have in the pantry, so that's an added benefit.  I topped my bowl with a couple of slices of avocado, and a dollop of sour cream and hot sauce.  If I had the family here, this whole pot would be gone already.  Thanks for this one!  This recipe is super as written and can easily adapt to whatever spices you want to add or delete, and whatever veggies are in season.  Winner!

I really like this recipe. Good with cheesey garlic breadsticks. My boyfriend didn't care for the corn, and 
I don't think that would be a significant omission, although I liked it. He suggested celery instead. The only issue I had with the recipe was that it just said to use a "large pot" and didn't say what size. I figured a 6 quart pot would be just right, but I had to take out 6 cups of liquid  to make it all fit. Still really tasty and I look forward to making it again, just scaled down for 2.  I haven't tried the leftovers yet, but I bet they'll be tasty.

This recipe was kind of 'meh' for me. Seemed like it was lacking something in the flavor department. I prefer the Chicken Tortilla Soup V recipe from this site.

Wow!!! What an excellent recipe. The only thing I did different was use 2 cans of Rio tomatoes with lime and cilantro. I did not add the corn. I don't care for corn added to dishes. I love spicy food. I will be making this soup on a regular basis. Thanks for the recipe.

A lot of ingredients for just a so so soup. I had to add Cumin and Oregano for more Mexican spice. 2 cans of diced tomatoes is plenty.  Could to use all the broth. Pan not big enough and it would've been too soupy for my taste. Hoping its better the second day. I chose to use the sour cream on top of each individual bowl and crunch some tortilla chips on top. Also added some chopped jalapeño to onion mixture. Used 2 tbs. chili pwd. Originally this was just a chicken chili. Guess I was looking more for a tortilla soup.

This is an excellent recipes with lots of flexibility! I cooked it in my pressure cooker and it came out perfect. Like others already mentioned, I used frozen corn instead of canned corn. I also added some more chili beans since we really like them.

I changed this recipe a bit due to what I could find at the store and dietary restrictions. I halved the recipe. For half the recipe, I used one medium can of tomato sauce without salt and one medium can of diced tomatoes instead of the diced, whole and souped tomatoes. I also used frozen corn and guessed on the amount and used a can of black beans rather than chili beans. I also skipped the parsley as I don't have any and omitted the sour cream. Served with tortilla chips.

Love it! This is very tasty, but not too spicy! Perfect! Everyone loved it! Cooking for a smaller group than 8? I would suggest cutting this recipe in half, but if you like TONS of leftovers (of awesome soup) make the whole recipe! Again, it's very flexible. You can almost change anything and still get the same taste! Love it, thanks Aunt AF!

This is really delicious!  I made it in the crock pot  - I put everything except olive oil, corn, beans and sour cream in the crock pot.  I used all the tomatoes and then poured in a little water and the rest chicken stock to fill the crock pot (leaving enough room for beans and corn).   I used about half the chicken simply because my crock pot is too small for that amount of soup.  I cooked on low for about 7 hours.  I then shredded the chicken and added the beans, sour cream (low fat) and corn and let it cook for another 2 hours or so .    I used frozen corn, pinto beans and fresh hot salsa.  I also added some cumin and extra chili powder.  In the future I will probably skip the peeled, whole tomatoes because I don't feel they add much.  This would be great with rice also.  This tastes like chili made with chicken and I love it!    Great recipe.

Delicious and easy! I halved the recipe and dumped everything (minus the olive oil) in my crockpot for about six hours. It turned out great. I left out the sour cream but otherwise stuck to the recipe.

Do yourself a favor and make this for dinner tonight or tomorrow!  It's so incredibly delicious and it makes a lot.  Our 2 year-old wasn't interested, but the parents loved it and ate it for 3+ days later.  Such a good deal and a delicious recipe.

As a mom of 5 kids who needs a easy go to soup that everyone loves, well this is it.  I have made this a dozen times and have several bags of it frozen in my freezer for this purpose I double the recipe. I add a extra can of beans or 2 because that is how my family likes it.  I do NOT add as much chili powder as suggested (the first time I did that it was way to hot for my family). I use Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream none of my family can tell the difference and it is healthier. When I do not have time to boil the chicken I use chicken broth and a few cans of chicken, not quite as tasty but will do in a pinch.  You cannot go wrong with this soup!

Made so much more than 8 servings!  Turned out great!  I used chicken thighs and browned them on both sides before cooking them in the broth.  Adds good flavor and I prefer chicken thighs, more flavorful.  Also used frozen cord.  Next time I'll add spicier tomatoes and maybe more chili powder.  I like a good "punch"!

I used black beans, chicken broth instead of water & bouillon, skipped the whole tomatoes, and probably let it (accidentally) simmer down a bit too much, but it was delicious!

Left out the whole tomatoes and added a can of diced tomatoes. Also used a chipotle corn instead of regular corn...amazing flavor...definitely serve with tortilla chips. No need for sour cream but if you want the calories go for it. for extra beans we added a can o kidney beans.

Basic and good soup. I did have to add hot sauce to make it somewhat spicey. Next time I will add a few fresh jalapenos to kick it up a notch!

Delicious! I used fresh whole tomatoes cut up, but I may leave those out next time. I also didn't have tomato soup so I used tomato sauce instead. Definitely will be making this again!

This recipe gave me the basis and with what I had on hand a very delicious soup. I threw all of it in the crockpot on high for about 5 hours then shredded the chicken and put it back in on low for another hour. I didn't use water, corn, diced or whole tomatoes but did use 2 cans of tomato sauce along with the tomato soup. 
I will definitely make this again and again.

I have to agree with all of the reviews...this soup is great!  I was skeptical at first when I saw "tomato soup" in the recipe, but the soup is truly fabulous.  I'm not sure why the recipe called for whole tomatoes, (they were a little overwhelming) so I'm omitting those next time.  We like our food hot, so next time I will add more garlic and chili powder.  Totally Yummy!

Absolutely loved it!!  Left out the whole tomatoes due to not having any and used only 5 chicken breasts, otherwise followed it to the letter.  I had less than the 5 cups of broth left, I just poured all I had left in the soup. Came out like a perfect chunky chicken chili. Very hearty and meaty, will make this again.  Makes enough to feed my family of 4, 3 times.

This was amazing! I added some adobo to it, and reserved the sour cream for a topping like the other posters recommended. It was an instant favorite. Make enough for leftovers, because its even better the next day!

My wife and i embarked on a 5 star soup making marathon. This was our first and we loved it. Our kids loved it as well which was an added bonus. We only used 2 tablespoons of chilli powder. we also used 3 cans of dice peel tomatoes because we couldnt find the whole peeled and it still came out great..

I loved this recipe! I was looking for something different to do with chicken breast that I had found on sale and most of the items in the recipe I already had on hand so it made for a great dinner. I did add some ground cumin to it as well, then we topped ours off with crushed tortillas and shredded cheese. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this soup two nights ago and it was wonderful.  We are eating leftovers and they are just as good if not better than the first time.  The only thing I did different was omit the corn and instead of mixing in the sour cream those that wanted it just put a dollop in their bowl along with shredded cheese and avocado. Yum!

This was delicious!  Spicy, but not overly, and so flavorful.  I only used 5 chk breasts, didn't have whole tomatoes so I used Chunky Stewed tomatoes instead, and didn't have parsley or onion powder so I just skipped it.  Other than that, I followed the recipe to the tee, and my husband and I were so impressed!  Loved it, and will be definitely making again and again!!

Followed the recipe as written *except I only had 6 chicken breast halves.  I also didn't put the sour cream in until it was ladled in bowls.  I just put a dollop on top.  Man, was this soup delicious!!!!  We sprinkled a few chipotle cheddar tortilla strips (found in salad dressing aisle) on top and enjoyed this soup!

This was good!  I made it as stated.  I don't care for the corn in the soup.(it made it sweet)  Other than that is was a tasty dish.

Yummy! I like my chilli thick so I skipped adding the broth into the final product! It was great.

This is a great spicy chicken soup.  I made some minor changes due to what I had on hand.  I did not use the tomato soup, I substituted a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis for the whole peeled tomatoes, and instead of chunky salsa I used salsa verde.  

Will definitely make this again.

Very easy and so good! Made some changes...used sour cream on top.  Made 1/2 the recipe but only 2 chicken breasts.  Didn't add the can of whole peeled tomatoes and did 1/2 a jar of salsa.  Add jalapeno peppers next time.

This was sooo good. All 4 adults really enjoyed this. It was extremely flavorful but not over spicy. I just threw frozen chicken breasts and all the liquid ingredients in the slow cooker on low for the day. (there wasn't room for all of it) I pulled out the chicken and shredded it and set aside which made room for the other ingredients. Next time I will either decrease the serving size so it can fit in the slowcooker or just do it in a pot on the stove. Thanks for such a wonderful recipe. Will definately make again.

Could not stop eating this!  For half a recipe used only one can of diced tomatoes, no tomato soup, no beans and frozen corn.  Used part pineapple salsa and part homemade salsa.  I forgot the sour cream and it was still wonderful!!! Can't wait to try it with the sour cream (and beans).

Pretty good. I left out the bouillon and used low/no sodium canned products since I too was concerned about sodium content of the recipe.

This was a big hit for the adults and older kids in our family, not so much for the under 5 crowd, though.  I used mild salsa, and then when it came time to simmer all the ingredients together, I divided it into two pots and made one spicy with dried jalepenos and ground cayenne pepper for the adults, and left the other mild for the kids.  We had three adults and four sons with hearty appetites, and we still had PLENTY left over.  But the leftovers were something to look forward to!

After reading the great reviews, I decided to give it a try....with some alterations.  I added all the dry ingredients with boiling the chicken(used 2 bone in chicken breasts and chicken sausage) so I can adjust the taste if need be when everything is combined. When I combined everything I added all of the broth instead of the 5 cups along with a can each of black & red beans and 1 cup tubettini pasta(I added the last 5min).  It came out awesome!!  Everyone loved it and not only do we have food the the next day but it was enough to freeze a big bowl.  Thanks Catherine!!

Made this for dinner this evening and it was really yummy. I used the diced tomatoes with green chilies (medium heat). I made it even simpler by buying a rotisserie chicken from the store. I just used a box of chicken stock since I didn't have to cook the chicken. My husband enjoys spicy stuff so this had just enough heat to make him happy & still be edible for me. I will make this again.

This is a fantastic soup!  "As good as grandma's homemade all but the kitchen sink soups with a special flavor".  I made half but left out the whole tomatoes, kept the whole onion and 3 garlic cloves and added a bit more chili beans.  I plan to make this regularly.

Fantastic!  Made it with the leftovers from a turkey roast.  This is a great backbone recipe that you can customize based on your taste for spiciness and the veggies you have in your fridge.

this is a really good soup, I make it using my slow cooker and it is so nice to come home to this smell.   It is a tad spicy, but I like it. I alos like the contrast of corn in it, very good.  Would probably freeze well and be easy to make a bunch, freeze, then have an easy dinner option.

I served this at dinner for friends and we ALL raved about it.  It's DELICIOUS!  I served it with salad and garlic sourdough bread.  I substituted one can of Rotel tomatoes w/chilis for one of the cans of diced tomatoes, only 1 Tbsp. of chili powder and 6 chicken breasts.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly as written.  This recipe is a keeper.  Hearty and extremely flavorful!

Oh yes, definitely a keeper!  I followed the recipe almost exactly and loved it.  While I was putting away the spices, I saw Cayenne pepper and threw in a dash for even more spice.  Yummy.  The recipe is easy to follow and if you decide, easy to customize.  Thank you so much for submitting!

I am currently simmering some spicy chicken soup/chili. I have been going back and forth to the pot tasting it over and over... Its very yummy. I used Cayenne pepper powder and Ranchera style Salsa which is thicker and spicier. Can't wait! Highly recommend it, especially on a cold afternoon.

So I have never actually wrote a review but felt I had too on this soup.  I made this last night for new years and everyone said it was amazing!  They all wanted the recipe.  The only thing I changed was added rotel tomatoes and did not put any whole tomatoes.  I also did v8 instead of tomato soup.

Excellent!  A great soup to adjust for your own preferences.  I definitely had to kick up the spice with some more chili powder and cayenne pepper.  I also added some red and green bell peppers.  So healthy, but hearty!!

I added black beans rather than the chili beans called for.  I would like it with a bit more of a kick though.  I think next time I'll add a little hot sauce.  Added it at the table this time.  Yum!

This is SOOOO good!!  I halved the batch since it was only for my husband and I and I had a bunch for leftovers...can't wait for tomorrow!  I popped the raw chicken in a crockpot with the salsa, tomatoes, spices, etc (all except the bouillon and sour cream) and let the chicken cook for a couple hours until it was cooked through.  I took it out and shredded it and put it back in with the rest of the ingredients.  Also I only added about 1 cup of bouillon to make it thicker, added a little cheddar and topped with some spicy nacho Doritos...very yummy!!  Will definitely make again and again.

Absolutely perfect! It has a spicy kick with great layers of flavor. Recommend making sure people realize that this takes 90 minutes to make, including all the cooking time. I was upset at first but after I tasted it, I was okay about it!

Instead of whole tomatoes, I used Rotel tomatoes and chiles...added some kick! My nephew said it was the best soup he had ever eaten...EVER!! Served it with sour cream (didn't add it to the soup), chopped green onions, shredded cheese and chopped avocado. My daughter in law also uses fresh lime to squeeze on soup if you like...I really like the lime. Superb recipe!

I have to admit, I was reluctant when I was dumping in a jar of salsa to the pot.  BUT it was fantastic!  I followed the recipe and directions exactly...wouldn't change a thing.  It made so much that I'm taking some to two of my neighbors.  This one is going in the rotation this fall and winter for sure.

We had this soup last night and loved it! It does make A LOT, so be prepared for that! The only modifications I made were eliminating the whole tomatoes (there are plenty already), using only 6 chicken breast halves and adding the sour cream on top of our bowls of soup rather than stirring it into the whole batch. Delicious!

This was really good! The rating is my husband's rating since he loved it. I tend to be more critical and I would only give it 4 because it was a tad too spicy for my tastes and next time I will cut down on the chili powder. But the title is SPICY chicken soup, so I want to give it the rating it deserves. I used one can of chili beans and one can of black beans. I can see how this recipe could be very versatile. Thanks for a good recipe!

This has become, by far, my favorite soup recipe.  I have made it four times and each time alter the recipe for what I have on hand.  Freezes well and, in my opinion, is even better after freezing or sitting in the fridge for a couple of days.  Add some shredded Mexican cheese before serving and you have a great winter time comfort food.  A big thank you to AUNTTAF for submitting.

Amazing and easy!! Tried it for the first time with some modifications (no sour cream at all; Only 1 can of diced tomatoes, not 2; I sliced 2 fresh tomatoes instead of the can of whole tomatoes; I used 1 can of chili beans, not drained, and 1 can of black beans, drained; and the 3 tablespoons of chili powder was not enough, but didn't want to add more of it so I put red pepper flakes for the extra kick I wanted). This is a really great recipe as it is pretty versatile to what you can find around your house, as long as you have the tomato and salsa base, you can just fool around with it. Awesome!

Reminded me of chicken tortilla or enchilada soup.  Worth making and really good.  I accidently left out the chili powder and my husband and I were thinking well it's okay but not that great...then I remembered and threw some in and it was amazing the difference it made!  I used alot more sour cream too, made it even better!  This makes a huge quantity, so I froze half in freezer bags to eat later...yum.

This was great!  Spicy and thick - almost like chili.

I gave this one a four because I didn't really find the soup spicy.  It does taste good however, next time I will add more kick to it.

I added a can of black beans, used black bean and corn salsa and added cumin to make it perfect for my family. A little shredded jack cheese and crumbled tortilla chips are a great topping.

Delicious! I eliminated the can of whole tomatoes and the can of tomato soup.  I forgot the olive oil - and it came out amazing!! It really does make a LOT of soup.  Great spicy flavor.

Have made this recipe a couple of times.  Even shared it with family.  Only thing I changed the second time I made it was to replace the whole tomatoes with another can of diced tomatoes.  When I used the whole ones, I ended up chopping them up anyway.  Great recipe.  Thanks.

This was a really good recipe to get my wheels turning!  I omitted the tomato soup, as we're not big tomato eaters, and used the sour cream at the table.  It was still extremely flavorful, and the salsa and diced tomatoes added just a touch of tomato flavor.  Great recipe!

Wow! I loved it! I used 1/2 water and 1/2 low-sodium chicken broth, and i also used mexican stewed tomatoes instead of diced tomatoes. I also cut back a little on chili powder because I don't like too spicy. I also omitted the salsa because I didn't have any. This was fantastic! I will definitely make this again!

I made this several months ago and am finally getting around to writing a review. The reason I remembered to write a review is because I had saved some in the freezer and just defrosted it for dinner. This is a great soup kindof reminds me of a chili with southwestern flavors. I believe I added quite a bit more garlic and chili powder just because I like my food to have lots of spice. By the way in my opinion most soups and stews taste better the next day after the flavors have had time to blend.

I have made it three times and have goofed up in one way or the other every time (Young bachelor).  And I still can't put it down after I start eating it.  This is going to single-handedly make me fat.  But the best news of all is that it's really not bad at all.  Maybe the sour cream, but meh.  I'll deal with an extra calorie or 2.

Great recipe!  I don't use whole tomatoes or chili powder, and instead of the 2 cans off peeled, diced tomatos, 2 small cans of hot (or even extra hot--love spicy food) Rotel, then also I add about 1/2 a small jar of the spicy cheese whiz.  Crock pot is a great way to go.

It's very good the way it is but I definitely thought there should have been more chicken.  Other than that, I'd say it's good enough to make again.

I did change some things but the most important thing I added was a bottle of beer!  Let the soup simmer with the beer for thirty minutes (the alcohol boils off) and enjoy the full flavor it will add to the soup!

This is a great recipe. A friend came over: it wasn't spicy enough for him. He felt topping it with pepper-jack cheese and adding a little bit of tabasco would have made it perfect. I think it's great as is. I made it in the crock-pot, but instead of chicken bullion, I used "Better than Bullion" (first ingredient is chicken, rather than salt) and didn't put any salt into the recipe. I also only put 1 cup of water. I'm definitely making this one again :)

Very easy and delicious. I used a George Foreman to cook my chicken instead of boiling, but still kept the broth simmering separate. Very good, thanks!

This was a great meal to warm you up on a snowy day. It was my first attempt at making a soup from scratch,and i was pleasantly surprised it was really quiet easy. I may have went a little crazy with the chilli powder so mine was very spicy but me and my boyfriend like spicy foods so i'll definetly be making it again!!

This soup is amazing! It has the perfect combination of heat and flavor. It smells fantastic when cooking and tastes even better. I did cut back the chicken, I used two breasts. I also used a bag of frozen corn instead of canned. I will be using this recipe for years to come! Thanks

This soup was really good! I didn't use as much sour cream and it was still really good. Once we poured our individual bowls we added a spoonful of sour cream, which was really good. I didn't think it was that spicy either but we added a little cayenne pepper to add a little kick to it.  Overall, we were very pleased.

This is a great recipe!  If you have kids who don't like spicy foods, just leave the chili powder for last and separate into two pots before adding to yours.  Also, I didn't quite "get" the whole tomatoes... I think it would be better to just use all diced tomatoes.

I made this for a church dinner and was overwhelmed with requests for the recipe. I only had breasts on the bone from which I had to remove the meat. They worked wonderfully. To make a nonspice version, purchase mild salsa and mild chili beans

This was very good~ I liked it and my boyfriend (who is quite particular) loved it! Definitely a recipe worth keeping
***9 years later this is still my most requested soup/chili recipe for a large group. You can't go wrong with it. I make it almost to the t on directions- sometimes I omit the sour cream if I'm worried about dairy intolerance in a crowd, it is fantastic either way. Thank you again for the recipe!

Very good and quite simple. The only part that really required alot of work was shredding the chicken. I made it exactly as the recipe said except letting people add their own sour cream at the table and instead of whole tomatoes I just used more of the diced ones. Then I made my own little tortilla chips from another users review suggestion. It was scrumptious! There is alot of chicken in the recipe. It could probably be halved if someone wanted to but with as much as there was in it, it was very filling. Will definitely make again but would be nice to use pre shredded chicken on lazy days. Not sure it would have that perfect flavor as it does with boiling in the juices of this recipe.

Very good soup, very similar to a local mexican restaurant.  I did use less chicken breasts, 5, and it still had quite a bit of chicken.   Look forward to my next bowl of it!

Really tasty. I used the handblender to break down the chuncks of chicken and that left me with a really nice consistency.

I didn't find this soup spicy at all, and I made it exactly as the recipe stated...except I used less chicken. I might have used 5 half breasts, 8 was too much.  Eight servings? Maybe if you're friends happen to be cattle. I ended up with quite a bit.  I'm not sure I'll make it again but if I did I will cut back on the sour cream, the taste was too much for me. I might cut back on the chili powder and add something for more heat.

My husband absolutely loved this soup.   It is so delicious and oh so easy to make. At the suggestion of other reviewers I only used 4 chicken breasts and used a can of black beans in place of one of the cans of kidney beans. Thanks for this keeper!

This is a great recipe! I used cooked chicken that I already had, so it was really easy. I halved the recipe and only had about 1/2 cup of chicken. That was enough for my taste buds, but my husband would have preferred the whole amount. Update: Had to change this to 5 stars after eating leftovers! This was much better after hanging out in the fridge for a day and a half. I did serve the sour cream on the side rather than in the soup pot, so that could make a difference with the leftovers.

My mom and I made this and we loved it.  We added a can of black beans and some chopped, stewed tomatoes.  We also used a cilantro salsa that gave the soup a good flavor.  I was a little concerned about the lemon because I think lime works better with these flavors, but was pleasantly surprised.  It was really tasty!  I ate mine with chips and cheese mixed in.  Great soup!

Great tasting recipe. Makes A LOT! Will be freezing most of it. I think I will make only half of the recipe next time. I think I will also add a little bit more corn and leave out the whole tomatoes. I will definitely make it again :-)

Soooo good!  My husband declared this a winner, perfect for the snowy day on which I served it.  I modified my leaving out the whole tomatoes and the chopped tomatoes completely as we aren't big fans.  I felt that the consistency using the tomato soup and salsa was just right...wouldn't change a thing otherwise.  I will be serving this again!

Easy and tastes awesome.  Reminds me of a really good and spicy tortilla soup.   I baked flour tortillas (brushed with olive oil) and cut into triangles to use for dipping.   Even my picky kids ate it!

After reading several reviews, I followed some advice to make a great soup. I only used 4 chicken breasts and skipped the whole tomatoes. I reduced the chili powder to 2 tablespoons, but kicked up the heat with 2 cans of tomatoes with green chilies. This made the soup quite spicy - perhaps too much for some people! I used one can of red beans and one can of white beans. The sour cream adds a nice touch at the end and gives the soup a nice color. I'm taking the big pot to a church dinner tomorrow.

Awesome.  My whole family loved this soup.  It is a keeper.  When I made this recipe it stated it's serving size was for 8, It could of easily feed double that.

I liked this soup. I marinated my chicken breast over night. I changed the recipe just a little. I added pigeon peas in addition to the red kidney beans. I also omitted the sour cream. lastly, I used skinless chicken breast with the bone. I love when meat cooks until it falls off the bone. Once the chicken was fully cooked, it just slid off the bone and then I shredded the chicken using two forks. Some additional seasoning that I used: Cayenne Pepper, Garlic Salt, Bay Leaves and Seasoned Salt. This helped to make a delicious chicken broth!

I think this is a great soup for the cold season. My son is starting to show signs of a cold, he doesn't like spicy food, but this is going to be the perfect medicine for him and help with that ugly cough.

This recipe was GREAT! My Dad and I loved how it mixed spicy with savory in a very yummy combo. Not to mention the fact that you pretty much just dump everything in a pot and let it cook, so it was easy for a couple of bachelors to have a really good meal!

Oh MY!  That was delicious, and I'm not a soup person.  I was only left with about 3 cups of broth, but that was all it needed.  I omitted the corn, used only 1/2 can of beans, otherwise pretty much followed the recipe exactly.  Made a lot of soup but I'm glad because I will eat this daily until it's gone.

This soup is awesome! It's like a creamy chicken chili soup! It had a perfect spiciness to it and I'm not a spicy foods kinda girl. It just had a little heat to it that was perfect! I accidentally doubled the sour cream. It said one container of sour cream and I didn't notice that it had (8 oz.) next to it. But it still turned out awesome! My boyfriend hates sour cream and he loved it! (I didn't tell him there was sour cream in it :) ) Anyway, my only complaint was that there were so many big chunks of tomato. My boyfriend and I don't like big chunks of tomato so next time I'll leave them out or just use one can and dice them smaller. All in all, superb and will definitely make again!

This is GREAT!  You can make it spicy hot or a low spice for the kids.

I added red pepper flakes to kick it up!

Terrific recipe.  A word of caution to use a large pot!  We almost ran out of room; this recipe makes a lot.  My only change was using 2 tblsp of chili powder instead of 3 for the kids.

Wonderful!  My husband who does not like chicken eats all the leftovers.  I made it for a work potluck and by the end of the day, I just emailed the recipe to the whole staff I had so many requests.

Very good, but very spicy!  I probably added too much this time (medium salsa, cayenne & chili powder, extra can of green chilis, Rotel), so next batch I make will have a little less.  I definitely recommend this soup though!

I have to admit I did change the ingredients around a little to suit our tastes and what we had on hand, plus cut back on the broth a bit (no boullion) to make more of a stew/chili.  Delicious.  I just cooked everything together, then we added cheese and sour cream to our bowls.  A great dinner.

Great base recipe!  Not hot enough for us so I added some jalapenos and some jalapeno juice - yummy!!  I think I'll puree the rest to have along with our quesadillas tomorrow night!  Thanks for a keeper!

Not shabby; only a little too tomato-y. I added some cooked elbow pasta for a more heartier meal. Next time, I'll opt for rice.

This is absolutely delicious!!  I cut back on the chicken, used 2 cans black beans and added some chili paste (in a tube in the produce section of the grocery store).  We love spicy food, and this soup is an excellent change from my usual "vegetable beef soup".  Thanks!!

I gave this four stars because I completely changed the recipe.  I did not want it to be too tomatoey so I only used a large can of chopped tomatoes and one can of Rotel.  Those are the only tomato products that I used.  I used one can of chili beans and one can of corn.  I cut corn tortilla's from the grocery store into strips with a pizza cutter and deep fried them until they were crisp and added a little salt.  These turned out much better than Tostito's or some other tortilla chip.  My picky 7 year actually gave this recipe a 100 on a scale of 1 to 5.  I think that sums it.  Beware, you may have to add your own blend of seasonings to season this recipe to your taste.  I added seasoned salt and old bay until it tasted good to me.

This is so good!!! I floowed the recipe exactly, except I ran out of chilli powder, so I used 2 T. chili powder, 1/2 T. cayanne, and 1/2 T. red pepper. It is delicious!!

This makes a lot so I usually half it for a family of 4.  No other changes.  A great winter meal.  We use tortilla chips with this soup. Another family favorite.

Seemed a little sweet (although quite spicy), try leaving out the tomato soup??

Fabulous! You can omit the sour cream, but then it doesn't taste as intended. Next time I will double the corn.  Had to cut up the whole tomatoes when served, because they were big and floated to the top.

I've made this recipe many times and I enjoy it every time!  I do make some changes though.  I don't use as many tomatoes as suggested in the original recipe.  If I put in the whole tomatoes and the tomato soup, then I don't use the diced tomatoes.    Sometimes I just use the salsa and only one other tomato product, and this recipe is still just as good.  Instead of using chili beans, I use a can of rinsed and drained black beans.  Also I don't add in all the chicken broth - I like this soup kind of thick.  In addition, instead of mixing the sour cream into the soup, I place a dollop on top of the soup when it's being served.  This is a great soup and my friends at work enjoy it when I bring in this dish!  This one's a keeper!

I made this soup for my works Christmas Pot Luck.  It was a big hit.  I didn't change a thing and it had a nice balance...not too hot for a group, yet a nice spicy flavor.  It makes quite a bit though.  Smaller families might need to cut it down.

My wife and I had a great time making this soup on a Saturday afternoon.  We are not into chunky soups too much so we blended the onion, tomatoes, and salsa which created a slightly thinner soup.  We cooked some white rice and put about a tablespoon in each individual bowl, which everyone loved.  This makes a tremendous amount of soup (maybe 20 bowls?) so be prepared to freeze a portion.  It is spicy, but not overly so.  Our kids loved it topped with tortilla chips and cheddar cheese.  This is one of the best soups we have ever made, or tried for that matter - highly recommended!

Great Soup!  Shredding the chicken is the only thing that takes any time and shredding the chicken is much better than cubings it.  I omitted the whole tomatoes and used one can chili beans and one can low sodium black beans.  I also used  used sodium free chicken bouillon packets.  No other added salt.  Used 1.5 cups frozen corn.  I did add the low fat sour cream and still put a dollop on top of my serving.  Made this soup alot last year and will be making many times over the next few months.  Thanks!

Omitted one can of beans and the whole tomatoes(it already had alot in it from the cans of died and the salsa) Also added some cumin and cilantro!  Very good and worth the effort!  Thanks

I was pretty skeptical about this recipe...but it is GREAT!! My boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised, and impressed! I did make several changes. I baked seasoned chicken breasts (375 degrees F) in a cake pan with a little butter, olive oil, and water covered with tin foil. I combined all the ingredients in a crockpot while the chicken was baking. I used one, drained 28oz can of petite diced tomatoes instead of all three cans, I used half mild salsa and half jalapeno salsa (very spicy!), and used some of the broth from the chicken's cake pan to thin it out a little. To be honest, this soup is still simmering in the crockpot...but based on "taste tests," it is awesome! I cannot wait to add cheese, chips, and a little chopped, raw onion! Thank you so much!

This was really good soup. We made it exactly like the recipe stated (with the exception of parsley for the simple reason that I hadn't realized that we were out) and it came out well. My only complaint was that I could really taste the tomato soup in it. Next time for my personal tastes I will just use tomato sauce. The rest of the family had no complaints.

I thought this soup was very good, and my husband loved it.  I made a couple changes.  I only made 1/2 the recipe, and I used Frozen Chicken Tenderloins.  I didn't defrost them, just put them right in the pot, and they cooked up in about 45 minutes.  I also added a green pepper to the mix while I was cooking the onion too.  I used frozen corn instead of canned.  I used a can of Tomatoes and Chilis instead of the regular cannned chopped tomatoes.  The last thing I did was at the end I tasted it, and it seemed it needed some extra kick, so I added about 8 shakes of the Tabasco sauce, and some juice from the jar of Jalapenos that I had in the fridge.  My husband raved about this, and had two big soup bowls full!

Excellent soup!  Smells incredible when it's cooking.  I omit the sour cream and whole tomatoes (2 cans diced instead).  Also use one can of chili beans and one can of black beans, undrained.  This recipe does make alot of soup but it freezes very well.  Perfect for a cold day.

My husband and kids absolutely loved this!!  My husband gave it a 4.75 --- the highest he's ever given anything else is a 4.5!

And, it made enough that we could enjoy it for several meals.

I've passed the recipe onto several of my friends and they love it too!

I LOVE the flavor of this soup and think it is wonderful! I did modify as others. No tomato soup, no whole tomatoes and no diced tomatoes for us. With the salsa being chunky and having lots of tomatoes, I added a large can of crushed tomatoes and that was sufficient. I did not want tomato soup. I also did 1 can chili beans and 1 can of black beans. I did not add sour cream, but added a dollop on the top of each bowl of soup, along with corn chips. Awesome soup!

This is sooooooooooooooo good!  I made it last night for my family and they loved it.  On a plate, I had lime wedges, cilantro and avacado wedges that we used as toppings for the soup.  Wow, this is the best soup we have ever had.  Thank you Catherine

We liked this soup.  It has a nice flavor.  I used cajun spice, and will omit the peeled tomatoes the next time I make this.

This soup was good, but I was hoping for unbelievable due to the high ratings. I haven't reheated it yet, will probably add cumin. Followed the recipe, it makes a HUGE amount, I had to use 2 dutch ovens. Would like to add black beans, more corn & maybe some rice. Also, maybe a rotesserie chicken and broth, then it would be an extremely easy recipe.Thanks Catherine, you obviously have a winner.

Forgot to add the sour cream and it was still delicious. I do agree that unless you have a really large pan, scale it back. I had to do it in 2 pans. Added a spoonful of rice to my bowl. Great. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was a different, great recipe. I modified it in a few ways: I used three different kinds of chopped/stewed canned tomatoes with seasonings and no whole tomatoes. I used frozen white corn and only one can of chili beans. I also used chopped garlic in a jar. It was a simple, throw together soup that was fun to make. My family loved it and I have it in the freezer for quick lunches. Thank you!

This soup was the bomb!!!!!  I added 1 can of black beans and skipped the whole peeled tomatoes.  The spices and everything were perfect.  It also makes enough to freeze for another meal.  Thanks! :0)

I thought this soup was going to be amazing with all of the five star ratings, but I found it to be bland. I think the recipe calls for too much chicken because I used about 3/4 of what the recipe calls for and my husband even commented that there was a lot of chicken. It also wasn't salty enough. I also think that it was too watery. Maybe omitting the whole peeled tomatoes next time would be best. Anyway, I'm thinking that maybe a lot of the flavor is dependent on what salsa you use and I just didn't use the right kind. Overall it was ok, but not great.

Very good! 
I used a drained can of Original Rotel for the diced tomatoes, small jar of On the Border hot sauce, I didn't have any chili powder so that became a pack of taco seasoning, and boxed chicken broth.
Just a hint of heat to make nose run. Had to have heat for here in Texas. 
I call it mild.
Sounds weird but served over spaghetti noodles. Most excellent.

This was a really great easy recipe.  It makes a lot more than what I thought it would.  I didn't have any chili beans in the house so I made it with black beans and it was delisious.  I will make this again!

Oh, the flavor!  Rich and velvety and with just the perfect level of spiciness.  The only changes I made were to leave out the whole tomatoes and use a rotisserie chicken instead of  boiling breast-halves in the stock.  I won't be doing that again--the boiling of the breast-halves would actually be less work, I think.  The rotisserie chicken, which was cooked perfectly and tender, ended up having a mealy texture and almost disintegrating into the soup.  Regardless, it was delicious, so I will most definitely be making this soup again.

This was ok.  It tasted like the taco soup I usually make with ground beef (which is much easier and simpler).  The flavor was good but I won't make this again.

OK - so I've made this soup many times but was missing one of the steps - adding the sour cream while the soup is cooking- I figured with so many ratings I should try this. So I'm now changing my rating from 5 to 4 stars. I'm amazed so many people like it that way - it had this really odd orange color to it... the taste is still there but I feel like it changed it and not for the better. the picture on the web site is one before the sourcream is added and that is a five star recipe.

This soup is great!  It makes A LOT of soup and there is just two of us, but it warms up wonderfully for lunches.  I made this the "easy" way by sweating the onions and garlic in the oil, chopping the chicken breasts into large pieces and sauteeing for a minute, then adding the canned ingredients.  I let it simmer for quite a while and then pulled the chicken pieces out to cool.  The easiest way to shred that I've found is to use your fingers and pull them apart.  It's super quick and easy.

Like many of the others, I too was surprised at the 5-star ratings. I followed the directions exactly, and found this to be very, very bland. I tried doctoring it up as it simmered, but was basically unsuccessful in my attempts. Also, it makes a ton of soup, so now i have some in my freezer as well, and most likely will never eat it.
