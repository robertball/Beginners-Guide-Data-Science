Excellent flavors.  Leaves a pleasant taste on your taste buds.  We doubled the recipe and spread the extra herb mixture on some potatoes sliced 1/8-1/4 inch.  We spread the potato slices on a cookie sheet and basted them with the herb mixture and baked them with the chicken breasts. Due to food allergies we used aluminum foil instead of non-stick spray, which means makes this dish extremely easy to clean up.  Serve the chicken and potatoes with steamed veggies such as green beans or carrots.

Thank you for sharing this wonderful,flavorful herb mixture with all of us. I made the herb mixture and then rubbed it UNDER the skin of a whole roasting chicken, which I had previously loosened from the meat. Then using a fork, I poked holes into the meat so that the herbs could penetrate the meat while roasting in the oven. It results in an absolutely delicious, juicy chicken.

This came out well, but in step 1 where it says "pour over chicken" -- there was no way that stuff was going to pour. I added a bit more oil, then just spread the mixture over my chicken breasts with the back of a spoon. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and baked them at 375 for 30 minutes (your results may vary, that's just how long it took for how thick mine were). I served this chicken sliced over AR's "Pasta Hot! Hot! Hot!" with a side salad and it came together nicely. Thanks for the recipe!

I used boneless skinless chicken seasoned with garlic, salt, and pepper, and browned in a pan.  I placed the chicken in a baking dish, poured a little olive oil over it, and rubbed the dry ingredients into the chicken.  I also added some cut up potatoes around the chicken, poured olive oil over the potatoes, and sprinkled the remaining dry seasoning over them.  This was a quick and delicious meal---good for a busy work night or suitable when having company over.

I followed this recipe exactly... I didn't have chicken breasts though, so I used chicken breast tenders and cooked them at 425 for about 20 minutes.  They were delicious! Wonderful flavor and moist! Will make these again for sure! Thanks!

Great sauce, Judy...thanks for the submission.  I shredded the leftovers the next day for a simple salad and the chicken was so juicy in flavor that I didn't need salad dressing.  Thanks again.

Made this with sliced potatoes around the edges of the baking dish, added melted butter to the olive oil to make more liquid and only used: onion, minced garlic, salt, ground pepper and extra dashes of hot pepper sauce.  Poured over chicken and dotted the potatoes with extra butter.  Bake.

Next time I will rub the herb mixture underneath the skin.  The meat didn't have as much flavor as I expected, and the bottled herbs were all new too.  It made a yummy pan sauce, though (which I was able to use the rest of my leftover giblet stock for).

The caption is true: 'easy to prepare but seems special enough for company.' I added potatoes and baby carrots; didn't grate the onion but just threw it in chopped. Used a pastry brush to get the marinade under the skin. Made a double batch of marinade to cover chicken and potatoes/carrots/onions. Mine baked for quite a while, covered. Just kept checking until it was soft and juicy. Will make again!

Tasty for a healthy chicken recipe.  I used skinless, boneless breasts, added more olive oil and garlic.  I substituted cilantro for the parsley to add additional flavor at the end.

I made this for Mother's Day and it was a big hit.  I used bonless skinless thighs and breasts and coated the chicken with the oil mixture, then wrapped each piece with a slice of bacon.  I covered the prepared chicken and refridgerated overnight.   I baked it as the recipe stated, but about 5 minutes before it was done, I sprinkled some Colby Jack Cheese on each piece.  Yummy!

When I first mixed the seasoning with the olive oil and the hot sauce it didn't look like it would be enough, but the juice from the chicken made a perfect amount of sauce. My family loved it! I served it with baked sweet potatoes and fresh green beans.

This was good and certainly quick and easy.  I used boneless skinless chicken breast tenderloins and added a little chicken broth and reduced the baking time to 25 minutes.  I normally use boneless skinless chicken breasts.  However, this is a recipe that I think would probably taste better with chicken with the skin.  While it was good it was not great.  I think next time I would marinate the chicken overnight and grill it instead of baking it.

Boyfriend really liked this, I really didn't. The amount of the herbs made the texture very gritty. It would be better if the chicken was coated in the mixture rather than pouring it on top.

Tastes like Thanksgiving. I rubbed the herbs under the skin, rolled baby potatoes in the oil/herb mix and roasted together. Hubby loved it. Served with seasoned green beans. An easy week night meal with a down-home cooking feel.

Since I had to make this a little ahead of time, I cooked the chicken according to the recipe (less 10 minutes). Within the recipe I added chopped carrots to roast along with the chicken. Then I put it all in a large crockpot on low with 1/2 cup chicken broth, added an entire bag of lima beans, and left it on low for another 2 hours until it was time to eat. Our family loved it. He's taking the leftover to work so he can show off in front of the other guys eating fast food. Great herb mix and made with ease.

I am on a diet and eating a lot of chicken!  This chicken was delicious!  I put it in the over and went to the gym, so I overcooked it slightly, but it was still so tasty we ate it to the very last morsel.  Plan to make this again, when I can concentrate on just cooking and have it a little less dry.  If you need 'simple but tasty' this qualifies.

An absolute winner. Creative yet simple recipe to make use of my garden herbs. Like other reviewers, I added a bit of broth and a bit more olive oil as I was using skinless, boneless chicken breasts. The sauce was wonderful. Served ours sliced thin with a hearty spinach salad and whole grain rolls.

This recipe has become a family favorite! For an easy side dish, once the chicken is cooked, I move  the chicken to a serving dish and reserve cooked juices. I open 2 cans of white kidney beans, drain and rinse. Add the beans to a large pan over a medium heat. Add the reserved chicken juices and 1/4 cup white wine. brinng to a boil, then reduce heat. cook covered for 10-15 minutes. remove from heat and serve. The bean are smooth, creamy, and extremely flavorful.

I made this with 5 BLSL chicken breasts and a little more than 2 TBSP olive oil and did not use rubbed sage because I don't have it. Also, instead of hot pepper sauce, I used cayenne pepper and some red pepper flakes. This is very easy to prepare and tasty dish although I found it a little too salty. Next time, I will use just 1/4 tsp or less salt to start.

This is fabulous! I've made it twice now and there were no leftovers either time.  I used chicken thighs and also doubled the recipe and added sliced red potatoes.  Very good!

I made this tonight and it was absolutely amazing, although I made a few changes. I did not have any marjoram so I added oregano and left out the the pepper sauce. I also added more olive oil as it looked pretty dry I only used 2 skinless chicken breast with about 1/8 cup of olive oil. served with rice and corn for a full rounded out meal.

Fantastic and easy recipe. I followed almost exactly - I had to substitute oregano for marjoram. It took five minutes to prepare, and came out juicy and flavorful.

Loved the taste of it but; it turned out a little dry.  Keep a close eye on the cooking time.  Instead of aprinkling with parsley I added dry parsley to the rub.  The recipe stated to discard the skin; which didn't make any sense to me since you were suppose to rub the spices on the skin.  I decided to lift the skin and rub the spices directly on the breast of all the pieces then I rubbed the extra on the skin of the chicken.  
I have family members who love the skin and they loved it this way.

We didn't find this to be anything special.  Maybe it's just us.

The whole family LOVES this recipe! My only change is to add just a little bit more olive oil.  I usually have a green veggie and mashed potatoes and gravy (made with the pan drippings) as sides.  I plan to use this seasoning recipe on my Thanksgiving turkey this year!
