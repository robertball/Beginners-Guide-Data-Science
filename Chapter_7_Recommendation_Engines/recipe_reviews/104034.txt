OH MY GOD these are sooooooooooo yummy. I substituted the peanut butter chocolate chips instead of the solid chocolate so that my son could eat these without to many repercussions. I am keeping this recipe handy for when I need a quick and easy sweet fix that I can eat.

This is a REALLY good recipe.  I used a smaller pan (7 1/2 x 11 inch) so they came out thicker. Super!

Turned out delicous!! I used chunky peanut butter to give it added crunch.
If you crave chocolate and peanut butter this is the recipe for you.

This recipe is definetely a keeper! I used margarine, reduced-fat peanut butter, and semi-sweet chocolate chips. I'm glad my husband, who is a diabetic, can enjoy the desserts with me and my sons. I shared this recipe with a friend and she was amazed it was made with Splenda, neither her famiy are diabetic. This recipe is good for anyone.

These were great!   I followed the recipe except for the brown sugar.  I was out of Splenda brown sugar and used regular.

These came out great. I used toll house cookie chips. Easy to make and quick.
