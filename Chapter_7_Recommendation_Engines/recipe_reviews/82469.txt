This recipe is truly delicious and a hit at the potluck I brought it to!  It was fairly expensive to make though as asparagus is about $5/bunch where I live right now.  
I have a few suggestions to add to the recipe.  1. Oil baking pan well before putting puff pastry in.  2.  Cut venting holes or slits in the top layer of puff pastry 3.  Ten minutes was too long to cook the asparagus.  I sliced my mushrooms to around 1/4" thick.  Next time I make this I will fry the asparagus and mushrooms in butter together no more than 5 - 7 minutes.  They have further cooking time in the oven and soggy asparagus is kind of gross.  4.  Go ahead and use all of the prepared Hollandaise sauce (just shy of 2 cups). 5.  Brush the top layer of puff pastry with a beaten egg before baking to give a nice glazed appearance to the finished product.

Very Good recipe! For those of you who are a little more health conscious, like myself, an alternative to frying the asparagus in butter would be to blanch them quickly just until tender or steam them for 5-7 minutes. The mushrooms still need to be sautéd, but I used about 2 Tbsp (I realise this may not seem like enough, but because mushrooms give off so much liquid 2 Tbsp is all you need) of olive oil to make it healthier. Getting rid of that butter should knock off at LEAST 100 calories.

Yummy!  And very elegant!  As suggested, I used the whole pkg of hollandaise.  I also used the full amount of asparagus. A few tips: 1)Use an egg slicer to slice the mushrooms.  They slice easily and are uniform that way.  And 2)My puff pastry sheets were square, not long enough to cover my pan, so for the top layer, I cut into 9 strips and layed them criss-cross in a lattice design on top. It turned out great, thanks!

For those of you with a soggy crust this may help: Brush bottom crust with lightly beaten egg white or whole egg. I use this trick for pies that may cause a soggy crust.

I made this today, and it was truly delicious ,although as mentioned high on the carbs.  I did take in the last reviews points of "pamming" my dish before applying the puff pastry.  I didn't go the extra mile in getting fresh asparagus, I used a can of asparagus tips, not cooking them, but layering them first on top of the pie shell and then pouring the mushroom, garlic hollaindaise sauce.  I also made "vents" for the top layer of pastry and instead of egg wash, I washed the pastry with milk to give it a nice golden colour when baked.  My husband enjoyed this dish very much.  Thank you for sharing !!

great! Make personal ones by cutting sheet of puff pastry into forths. Layied asparagus on bottom sheet covered with musrooms that had been pre cooked in butter, added sauce and covered with other half of sheets. Poured rest of sauce over packets at serving

I thought this was a great way to use such great ingredients.  My puff pastry sheets fit into a 9" square pan perfectly, would probably had to do the strips if I had wanted to put it into a 13x9 pan,  I think this would even be good with a regular homemade pie crust.  thanks!

This is truly great. I followed tips used pam in pan and sprayed top of vented crust to brown.  I used 1 bunch of asparagus, mushrooms and a red pepper; actually any combo would work nicely and also used the entire package of sauce.  This is a meal in itself for Lent!!

I didn't use 2 bunches of fresh asparagus and I didn't use 1 cup of hollandaise sauce.  Here is what I did do.  I sauteed about 1/2 a bunch of cut-up asparagus in a margarine/butter blend for 10 minutes, then I added 8 oz. of mushrooms with the garlic.  I drained off as much of the liquid as possible.  As one reviewer suggested, I brushed an egg wash over the bottom crust before adding the filling.  I only added enough of the sauce to keep the filling moist and was left with about 1/2 cup.  When I finished the pie I put it in the fridge for about 30 minutes before popping it into the oven.  What came out was beautiful and absolutely out of this world.  I poured some left over sauce over the servings and just chewed each piece slowly as I savored each flavor.  It is very rich. I don't believe there is any way you can help having a soggy bottom but it doesn't really matter because it is so good.  Maybe increasing the oven temp might help.  This pie make a beautiful presentation and is perfect for a romantic brunch.

This dish was very good.  Really flavorful.  I'll be careful not to overcook the asparagus next time.  Other than that, it'll be a regular menu item in our house.

Delicious! I used the full amount of Hollandaise sauce and steamed the asparagus instead of frying it in butter. I also brushed egg on top of the pie. I will be making this again.

This is delicious. I've only made it once and my bottom pastry crust was soggy so I'll try some of the other reviewers ideas next time. This is really good though for the Asparagus and Mushroom lovers out there!! Yummmmy!

my family LOVED this pie! my brothers are so picky with their vegetables yet they loved this one. I used a square sheet of puff pastry on the bottom then used the second square on top by cutting the sheet into long lines & crossing the strips to look like a pie top. I also egged the top for shine and crisp. thanks for the great recipe!

This is a delicious recipe. I used the helpful comments of other and brushed the bottom crust with egg whites; I also added vent slits in the top crust and sprayed PAM on the pan. However, I think next time, I will simply saute the vegetables and pour the "Blender Hollandaise Sauce" over the veggies just before serving. You can find the Blender Hollandaise Sauce on allrecipes, too.

This was FANTASTIC - I really loved it. Maybe not the most healthy way to eat your vegetables, but certainly a delicious way! I did make 1 change, in that I substituted zucchini for the mushrooms (I hate mushrooms), but it turned out fabulous. And I used the Blender Hollandaise Sauce on this site, which worked very well and was delicious, especially combined with the yummy puff pastry crust. My fiance absolutely DESPISES asparagus, and he complained loud and long about my choice to make this, but after he tried some, he used the phrases "not bad," "better than most," and "I kind of almost forget it's asparagus sometimes." So I think that makes this recipe a resounding success!

Excellent vegetarian meal, puff pastry did stick to bottom.Had to stretch bottom puff pastry to fit 13x9 pan, Next time will use 11x7 pan and salt and pepper to taste.

WOW!  This is so GOOD!  I did add some things to it and I used to pkgs of the sauce.  I boiled some red potatoes and some chicken breast.  I also brushed the bottom crust with egg and layed the potatoes on top then the chicken.  I drained the vegies before mixing with the sauce.  I also added some onion in with the garlic.  I put the sauce mixed with the asparagus and mushrooms on top of the chicken then stretched the pastry out to fit the 13 x 9 size pan.  It is wonderful!!!  I will make again!

This recipe is awesome! The only change I made was to roast the aspagargus (I love roasted asparagus, and I was able to cut out half the butter!)before adding it to the sauteed mushrooms. The second time I made this, I got sidetracked and burnt the asparagus, so I ended up sauteeing the mushrooms with a leek I had on hand, adding some garlic, and then switching the hollandaise for a packet of mushroom/pepper gravy for steak. Added a little stilton on top and ended up w/a totally different (but incredible) meal--Bottom line, you can't screw this one up! Thanks for a great recipe! (Even when it's totally changed! lol)

Tastes good.  My husband complemented on the dish.  Making the dish took longer than I thought it would (the recipe times).  Took other peoples advice and greased the pan, used all of the prepared hollandaise sauce (1 1/4 cup), and brushed the top with the egg yolk.

I hurried to make this dish for a potluck, but I made it exactly as written. It was only 10 minutes out of the oven before people were trying it, and I got great compliments. The hollandaise I used was not from a package, but from a 4-star recipe on this site, so this was two recipes in one. A couple of notes, though: the cooked vegetable mixture, before adding the hollandaise, had quite a bit of liquid at the bottom. The recipe didn't say to do so, but I tried to drain it all. Even after mixing in the hollandaise and putting it between the pastry crusts, liquid seeped out. So my results were not picture-perfect, since I was hurrying and didn't pinch-seal the edges well enough. The other thing I should mention is that I had a lot more filling than I thought could fit inside the crust. Unless I was being too conservative, I only managed to put maybe 2/3rds of the filling inside until I thought it was maxed-out. I rarely buy asparagus, but maybe my "2 bunches" of asparagus, even after trimming, were a lot larger than average? Still, the leftover veggies in hollandaise should be really tasty when reheated tomorrow. Overall, despite my results being a bit of a structural mess, they looked nice and better yet tasted wonderful, and earned me praise.

Wow, I will have to make this, but use my asparagus casserole recipe aka a twist on green bean casserole.  Don't use the fried onions but fresh grated parmesan cheese instead, cream of mushroom soup.  I will cut into triangles like another poster did for appetizers or single servings.  I think I will make it this weekend with that Sirlon Steak Diane recipe and salad.  Sorry 4 star for right now, as I don't know if this will work yet.  I'm not a hollandaise sauce fan but will make some of each to test out on the hubby. :)

I think if something is referred to as a "pie," it should be round, which is why this recipe threw me off. I made it like a pie anyways :P I think the author should note that you need to roll out you dough a little to make it fill up a 13x9 pan. I just used a regular glass pie plate. I had to alter the amounts in order to make it work; less butter, 1 bunch asparagus, still 6 cloves garlic, 8 oz mushrooms, still 1 cup sauce, and still the entire package of puff pastry. It came out very nice. I highly recommend poking good vent holes so you don't get a big buildup of liquid under the crust. And make sure not to get impatient, let it cool for a while! It's not a clean-cutting pie anyway, but if you don't let it cool you'll have to scoop it out with a spoon. I let mine cool for 10 min and it was still too soupy, but set up after a while. Other than that, this was a delicious pie besides the mushrooms :P My mom loved it.

My family loved this pie! I wasn't able to get puff pastry so I used a double regular pie crust and used an egg wash on the bottom crust. The taste was awesome and the bottom didn't get soggy, even the next day. Definitely a keeper!

This recipe was easy and delicious.  I was making it for dinner and wanted it to be a little heartier, so I added some chopped onion and diced Canadian bacon.  Makes a nice leftover for lunch, too.  Actually, this can be served any time of the day or night.

I made this dish last night for my son and his fiance who are Vegan.  I made a Vegan Hollandaise sauce, found on this site, and added some pearl onions, because I really like cooked onions.  It was a big hit.  I will definately make this again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was sooo goood! I had a 1 left over already pie crust,and 1 left over phyllo sheet from X-mas. Pie crust on the bottom, phyllo on top.[Used the blender hollanaise sauce] I only added a small sliced onion to it. Very rich. I drained my vegetables, and I sprinkled a little bit of cracker crumbs on top of the "pie crust" to help absorb some of the juices. I don't know what worked but I didn't have a problem with a soggy crust. I think the next time I make these I'm going to take Mr. Dolanski's suggestion and make indivdual packets; that sounds impressive. Also I only had 1 bunch of asparagus and 8 oz of mushrooms, and doubled the recipe of the hollandaise sauce.

This was absolutely delicious. I am a vegetarian and wanted to make something hearty to eat for Thanksgiving dinner, since my cousin is also vegetarian. We both loved it, and nearly ate the whole thing ourselves. I will definitely be making this again.

Outstanding! Made this for Mother's Day and it was a huge hit. Followed the directions exactly and used the blender hollandaise on this site. 
It was great like it was but next time I will probably cook the asparagus less before putting in the shell. I may experiment with making individual ones.
Overall, this recipe as is, is a 5. Thanks!

This was great! I added more mushrooms and garlic because we love them. And I took the advice of another review and blanched the asparagus. The mushrooms I sauteed in a little less butter and be sure to let all of the moisture evaporate before you combine the ingredients. I did not have the puff pastry, so I just used pie shells and sliced in the vents. My kids ate 2 slices each! I will make this again!

This was absoulutly wonderfull & loved the leftovers for lunch the next day or two. I made it just as written except I took someone's advice and cooked both veggies together. Put the asparagus in a few min. ahead of the mushrooms as I didn't want anything to be overcooked. I used a store brand puff pastry & had to cut the crust to fit a 9"x13" dish, maybe pepperidge farm is sized differently but they were out of it at the store. Didn't think to use rolling pin to resize it. Nest time I will take others suggestions as to use a egg wash on bottom crush to keep it from getting soggy. Mine wasn't really soggy,it just could have cooked a bit more. One pkg of sauce was plenty & everything else was perfect. Can't wait to make it again. Oh, I also added pam to the baking dish. Hope you all enjoy this as much as we did!

This recipe was awesome I did however tweak it some. Instead of making a hollandaise I made a mornay sauce. To all of whom aren't familiar it's basically a bechamel sauce with cheese added to it. I've neved tried it with the hollandaise but I'd like to think that the mornay idea is JUST as good if not better! A+!

I only used 2 TBSP of olive oil and 1 TBSP of butter and it was plenty. I enjoyed this recipe but my husband did not--he missed his meat! My only complaint was that there was not enough sauce using the Blender Hollandaise Sauce recipe from this site. Otherwise good.

Nice recipe.  I actually hate mushrooms so I have no idea if this tasted good, but I made it for a bake sale and everyone loved it.   Just some small changes.  I used less butter and less garlic, no hollandaise, and just sauteed the veggies in the garlic butter, before dropping it in the puff pastry.  I intended to add feta as well, but forgot!  Anyway, everyone enjoyed it and it was perfect for a bake sale, especially in an office where savory always sells easier than sweet!

Oh my god, amazing!  I halved the butter, mushrooms, and asparagus, but kept with the 1 c. of hollaindaise (made from a powdered mix) and used the whole package of puff pastry.  Surprisingly easy and to quote my husband "This is so good that I literally want to cry"!

WOW, this was an amazing dish!! I cooked it as written, just added a whole pkg of hollandaise instead of 1 cup and 3 shallots diced. This was a hit with all the family and even my picky hubby loved it. A definite keeper. Thanks so much for posting this one.

I also used regular pie crust instead of puff pastry. YUMM!!  I used 2 cups of hollandaise sauce--definitely needed it.  Good, but will use a little kielbasa in it next time.  My 10 month old even ate it!

ok folks,  I thought this recipe was really good.  I tweaked it by adding flat iron steak cut into bite sized pieces and sauteed with the veggies.  This steak is as good as filet mignon but less than half the price.  I also used bernaise sauce instead of hollandaise.  I saved some of the sauce and drizzled it over the top of each piece.  It was delish!!

I made this in a 9x9 pan and only used half of the asparagus asked for. I also used all of the hollandaise sauce and added pork that was sautéed in the pan I cooked the veggies in until almost done before putting it into the pie. It was absolutely delicious!   The only thing I would change next time is to put less asparagus and more mushrooms. It was slightly off balance.

I made this yesterday, adding some chicken breast to the asparagus and mushrooms. Fabulous! My 8-year old granddaughter polished her plate and decided that she now likes asparagus and mushroom. Result!! I shall make this again and again. It was so quick to make and so delicious. Recipes like this are a godsend to busy cooks.

I must have done something wrong a couple of times because this did not turn out so well for me.  I used far less butter because 1/2 cup seemed like a lot (perhaps the first thing I did wrong?)  I sauteed my veggies in about 2 tablespoons of butter until they were just a little crispier than I like them (perhaps the second thing I did wrong?)Then I added the sauce and assembled and baked as directed.  My end result was very liquidy.  It tasted pretty good, but the asparagus was really mushy and I don't care for mushy asparagus.  Also, the bottom layer of puff pastry was soggy.  After it finished cooling I covered the pan and put it in the fridge.  When I went to go pack some in lunches the next day, it was a soggy mess.  If I could figure out how to not overcook the asparagus and to keep it from becoming a liquidy soggy mess, I would give it 5 stars, becuase the taste combination was great.

Delicious!   I used mushroom soup diluted with a wee bit of water instead of the boring white sauce.  This has enough salt to bring out the mushroom and asparagus flavours.. Saute for no more than 5 min.

Mine turned out very greasy. Would not make again. Suggest reducing butter if you try it.

Super yum. I added a couple of carrots to beef it up a bit. Will definitely make again.

I didn’t use puff pastry to keep carbs down. I made my own hollandaise sauce instead of using a package. It was a delightfully delicious side dish! My husband called it restaurant-quality. I wouldn’t have thought to combine these ingredients together. Really enjoyed it!
