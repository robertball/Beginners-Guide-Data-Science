This was very good.  The apples and bacon really added to the flavor of this substantial cabbage dish.  I would make this again.

The complexity of flavors makes this a special dish.  We felt the first hint of fall in the air today, so I thought this would be an appropriate supper.  I'll also make this again - it would be excellent even without the sour cream added.

I love this dish! I used both bacon and sausage because we just got a half a hog and wanted to try both. I added chopped carrots and celery to the onion, left out the olive oil because with the porks I did not need it and the sour cream because I don't like it and forgot the coriander and nutmeg. LOL. Was still awesome.This dish had a different flavor and texture with every bite. I think the only thing it needed to be a perfect meal was some kind of course peasant bread like a rye bread or maybe Irish Soda Bread. Thank You for this recipe, it is definitely a keeper!

I didn't like cooked cabbage much until I tried this recipe. Now I LOVE IT! I want to tell the world about it and eat it for breakfast lunch and dinner! I didn't have the corriander so I did just a pinch of the nutmeg. Delish!

Very good with mashed potatoes and breaded pork chops. (We prefered this as a side dish, not as a main course.) Subbed ground corriander for the seeds because that's all I had and used 1/2 as much. Fat free sour cream worked just fine too.

Made this for a St. Patrick's Day potluck.  Wow, did it go over big!  Excellent tasting. . . will definitely make again.  Added 2 cooked, sliced bratwurst.

this dish was excellent....almost as i remember it back in europe. only the american bacon is not quite like in europe (the smoky, fatty version is better). i did not have coriander (which is the key) and used fennel seed instead. was delicious with a hint of fennel as well. i like that sour cream is used instead of heavy cream or butter...was just as rich!

Very surprised how well the flavors blended together.  It really does require the 30 mins cooking time for the flavors to meld.  This combination does a good job of eliminating the sulfuric taste of cabbage.  Didn't add sour cream, and it tasted great.  Also used Canadian bacon instead of bacon and gala instead of Granny Smith apples (cut down the sugar though) with good results.

Thanks to whomever posted the photo - right on!  I posted the original recipe - this pic made me think of folding in a can of lowly sliced potatoes (50 cents), rinsed and drained, at the last minute for a one-stop shop.  Get back to you on that... And ground coriander or mustard is fab instead of the seeds...

We did not like this at all.  It was kind of sweet.  It just wasn't very good.

Followed recipe and I have to say I was surprised how much I liked it. I don't usually like cabbage.

Awesome!!!

One change:  apple cider (juice not vinegar) for the chicken stock.  One omission: Did not use sour cream.  Loved it!

I read most of the reviews and decided to season it my own way. I used this recipe as a starting point. Surprisingly, the ingredients taste pretty good together.

I've made this  twice, with and without the sour cream, and it is awesome either way. You could probably substitute cream or plain yogurt,  but I haven't  tried yet. I like to crush the coriander seeds a little with a mortar and pestle before I add them, it adds more flavor throughout and you don't  have to worry about biting down on a whole seed, which is  unpleasant in my opinion. Great combination of textures and flavors, really unique. I think I may add toasted sliced almonds or pecans next time. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This was delicious -- reminded me of a dish my mom and grandma used to make. I followed the recipe except for using ground coriander instead of coriander seed. Perfect fall side dish with pork chops.

I love this recipe! Made it several times and it was a hit every time. I don't have all the ingredients but it still worked out well. Skipped coriander seeds and in place of sour cream I added Miracle Whip. A go-to favorite easy recipe. Thank you!

I did not make any changes because I believe whenever the recipe is made for the first time -- then it should be followed as directed (by all).  I would not have changed anything.

Excellent recipe! Used ground coriander, since I didn't have seeds. Stirred in about 10-12 oz of cooked egg noodles at the end -it's a meal!

This was very good, I didn't have enough coriander seed so I added a little dill as suggested.  Will try again.
