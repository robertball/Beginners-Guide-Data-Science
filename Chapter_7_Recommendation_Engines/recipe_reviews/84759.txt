I think there's something missing from this recipe. I looked at it and thought, "Hm, this would make a nice scone." And it did - dense and crumbly, but definitely not a sponge. Sponge cakes generally contain eggs; perhaps the recipe's author left them out accidentally?

Either I don't know what a "sponge" is or there is something missing from this recipe.  The mixture was very think and not pourable at all. I baked it the required time and the result was dissapointing.  It was overcooked like a big cookie. It actually tasted it okay as a cookie bar but not at all what I expected.

I tried this recipe and the baking time is too long. It should only bake for about 30 minutes or 40 at the longest.

I remember this recipe from living in U.K, it was on the BBC food network. Never had much luck with this until now. Far easier instructions on here!!! My boys loved it! Think it would work great as muffins. Enjoy.
