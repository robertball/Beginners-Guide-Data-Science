I am giving this four stars because the ingredients and procedure are very similar to how I usually make mozzarella.  The problems with the recipe are that there is no measurement for the rennet and it fails to mention when to add the citric acid.

I make cheese every week, but rarely do I make Mozzarella because the numerous recipes a I have tried were not that impressive.  This turned out perfectly and I will be making it often.

Need to add 1 step please.  Should put balls in an ice bath after forming so they hold there shape. Other than that all good!  Also I find it better to do all in once :)

It took a couple of tries to get it right, but now I have the hang of it and the mozzarella turned out great - it's not easy, but don't give up! I used raw milk, it didn't work with whole milk for me

Tastes fine. Wish I would have read the reviews before I tried to make it. I would have realized that it forgot to mention when to add the citric acid mixture and how much renet to use.
