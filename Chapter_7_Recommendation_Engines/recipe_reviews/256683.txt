Perfect for our low carb diet to replace that longing for mashed potatoes. I didn't change a thing and enjoyed creamy and goodness all in one.

We used regular gouda (not smoked), and it turned out wonderfully.   I also had to simmer the cauliflower a tad longer than the recipe recommended.  Reminds me of the  gouda grits that I make, only far healthier.

I do not have a food processor, so I used my electric mixer. Otherwise I made no changes. It was tasty, and a nice accompaniment to the Light Herb Pork Loin. I may try it again.

This recipe is super easy and tasty! I mashed instead of putting in the food processor...tasted great but consistency would definitely have been better if blended like recipe suggested.

I used regular gouda, not smoked and doubled the cheese. It tastes pretty good, but its not great. My family did not care for the texture. I doubt I'll make this again.
