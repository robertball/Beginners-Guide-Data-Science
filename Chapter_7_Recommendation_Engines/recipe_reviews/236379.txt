We are gluten and wheat free in our family now. I tried these except I didn't have any almond flour. Instead I subbed Coconut flour. they turned out tasty. I find cooking with these types of flours makes the end product denser and it needs  more cooking time. Something I need to get used to. Not that light fluffy texture one gets with a white wheat flour.

These were actually quite delicious. I used coconut flour vs. almond flour because that's what I had on hand, and I threw in some mini chocolate chips for good measure. The result, tasty muffinesque pancakes that the kids devoured! Will certainly keep this recipe on hand!

My fiancee' and I are working toward a more healthy diet and some paleo-type recipes are included.  I couldn't find almond butter, so I had to cheat and use regular, sweet cream, unsalted butter (I know, this is not paleo) but I made everything else exactly as the recipe stated.   These had a nice flavor and browned up nicely, too.  I didn't think the cooking time was anything out of the ordinary.  The texture, of course, isn't the same as "standard" pancakes, but even my fiancee' said they were good and he'd eat them again.  (He's VERY particular about food.)  I'm going to try tweaking it a little, with more and less almond flour, adding some honey, and maybe trying some different spices, like nutmeg instead of cinnamon.  Maybe some almond extract instead of vanilla, too.  I'm thinking this recipe is a great one to potentially make in different versions, for a little variety.  

For the reviewer who asked about paleo syrup:  Real, unprocessed maple syrup is considered paleo-friendly.  As is raw, unprocessed honey.

These were tasty and did not need any topping but maybe some fresh berries.  I used frozen bananas this time and they were fine but probably better with fresh bananas.  Using coconut oil in the mix was a bad idea as the coconut did not dissolve.  Next time I will use another type oil like walnut or sunflower seed.  True about the length of time to cook them.  Very slow indeed.  I will try this recipe again!

This batter was so loose I had to add 1/2 c of almond flour.  The flavor was good but Iâ€™m struggling to believe my eggs were so large as to cause this proportion issue.

These were very delicious but I tweaked them a bit because I didn't have a banana.  So I substituted apple sauce instead.  I wasn't quite sure how much to put in so I ended up putting too much in.  I just added more almond flour to balance it out.  My husband loved them as well.  He had his with plain yogurt and honey while I did maple syrup and yogurt.  I added salt as some reviewers mentioned but not sure it made a difference.  Oh and I added allspice  with the cinnamon.

I made this exactly as written. Excellent texture and flavor, (especially for us: not accustomed to paleo foods.) I agree with the other reviewer(s) who suggested a pinch of salt would help bring out the flavor. The almond flour I used was "super finely ground", so I had no trouble with large chunks.

This was very tasty. I would add a little salt to the mix to balance the maple sera up on top. I replaced all of oil for the banana and coconut flour for the Allmond. Delicious!

Made as instructed except I did add some chocolate chips as recommended by another. It turned out surprisingly good and even 50% of my children loved them! Great healthy alternative to regular pancakes

These were good! I didn't have almond flour so I used almond meal, which is most likely why they were a tad bit dry for me, but nothing that a little maple syrup couldn't make better. The pancakes' taste was really good and I was happy that they didn't taste as 'eggy' as some paleo pancakes (and breads) taste. Thank you! We'll definitely make these again!

These are super good for what they are! I gave them four stars because I would not make them if I could have the real thing. Since I can't, these are the next best thing! I made these in the blender to help with texture and made a "syrup" of cooked down strawberries pureed with unsweetened coconut milk. This was more tart than the banana-sweetened pancakes but complemented them perfectly.

These are very good. I used a small ripe plantain instead of a banana, coconut oil instead of olive oil and added a drop of Fiori di Sicilia. My hard to please five year old ate it and asked for seconds. This means it must have been good. I can barely get her to eat anything.

We used to love zucchini pancakes before paleo, so I added a quart of defrosted shredded zucchini that I squeezed out the liquid. YUM!

These are too delicious to be healthy.  I didn't use almond flour, but gluten free flour that was a mixture of different types.  I did not have almond butter, but I used a tiny amount of coconut manna. I also did not use baking soda, but I'm not sure if it makes a difference.... I also add in soy or almond milk , sometimes yogurt . Also, they do not need any topping.  Next time, I am going to try quinoa flour.This is a versatile, healthy, and tasty recipe!

Let me just say that I've tried my fair share of paleo pancakes in my day and this recipe is by far my favorite. The pancakes cooked up just like "normal" pancakes and weren't really dense or heavy like others I've tried, simple ingredients that produced a good flavor without having to add any sweetener to the recipe itself.  I made these at night and heated them back up in the morning for a quick no-fuss breakfast and they were great!  Will definitely make again.  The only thing I changed was I used peanut butter because I didn't have almond butter on hand.

I've been eating gluten-free for a while, and started Paleo a couple months ago. Other than bread, pancakes are the most difficult thing to "get right" when going wheat free, so it's hard to be too hard on any pancake recipe.  This recipe uses almond flour, so you do get the little chunks of almond, which my husband did not like. The flavor was okay, though my husband didn't like them at all, and he's used to eating gluten-free.

I loved these, Very easy to make. Texture more like a regular pancake than other recipes.
