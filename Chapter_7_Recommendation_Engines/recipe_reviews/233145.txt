Normally I only use recipes that have at least 50+ reviews. When I tried this one, it only had 1 review with 5 stars. I am sooo glad I took the chance on it. It's terrific! I didn't have swiss cheese, but I did have shredded Italian Blend cheese, so I used it instead. And because I had 2 shallow pie crusts, I added an extra egg and dollup of sour cream to the mix so I could fill both pie pans. Well, it was absolutely delish! Even my husband, who doesn't like quiche much, loved it! Definitely a keeper... the recipe AND the husband! LOL

I didn't get to try this, as I brought it in for work, and there was nothing left.  So . . .it was a success at work, I guess.  This was very easy to put together, but I can't speak to taste other than it was all eaten.  Thanks for the recipe!

I felt this recipe was rather bland.  I only made it because I had the ingredients listed.  Both my husband and I ended up putting hot sauce on it.  I will not make it again.

The addition of sour cream really made all the difference in this recipe.  Won't make quiche without it anymore.  
Thanks.

Wow!  Thank you for perfecting this recipe because that’s what it is - a perfect quiche!  I followed the recipe and instructions exactly with one addition of a half cup of cheddar (for my hubby) - it came out fluffy, perfectly browned on top with the crust cooked through.  (It filled my deep dish pie plate right to the top.). The texture was incredible - the pieces held their shape but each bite tasted like soft scrambled eggs melting in your mouth. I found it a nice balance of onion, bacon and chess flavours.  The egg, milk, sour cream ratio makes a really great deep dish quiche. Thank you again for your work on making a great recipe!!

This was a delicious recipe.  I made it with a homemade quiche crust.   I wanted to eat it all for dinner but I saved enough for lunch the next day.

super easy to throw together!  I even added a handful ( so maybe 1/2-3/4 cup ) of fresh baby spinach.    Now when I make it I will make two, one to freeze for later or maybe just double the recipe and bake in a small 8X11" dish

Easy recipe to make. I brushed a tablespoon of Dijon mustard onto the crust before adding the other ingredients. Good with a salad for Sunday brunch.

I made this for a brunch and there wasn't a crumb left.  Everyone raved about it and said it was the best quiche they ever had.  I added a little Canadian bacon, but otherwise followed the directions to the letter.

I had to make it quick, so I used packaged real bacon pieces, and dried parsley.  Very good recipe.  Hopefully I'll have more time next time (when I'm not caring for a sick family member).

This was great! Creamy with just a little bite. I used half sour cream and half plain Greek yogurt and fat free half and half. Everyone loved it.

Loved it!    The half and half plus the sour cream really worked.   I did change it a little.
instead of bacon,  I used 8 ounces mushrooms,  sautéed in butter after I cooked the onions.   I used NY sharp cheddar and omitted the garlic.   I only used a little bit of parsley and minced it.  I cooked it for 50 minutes, but it could have used about 5 or 10 more minutes.   Nevertheless,  people loved it.  They said they liked having the mushrooms instead of the bacon.
