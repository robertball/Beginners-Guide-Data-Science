I’ve made this recipe at least 10-15 times since May with success! Truly delicious go to for us. My husband even says it is one of the best Mex. Rice I’ve ever made and I agree…full of more flavor than I expected using the Instant Pot (IP)! I’ve subbed taco seasoning when out of cumin and have made this exactly as written too. Here are some tips for some who might be new to the IP as I was. #1 Rinse your rice. #2 Do not stir in the tomato sauce—recipe doesn’t say to do so, but you might be tempted out of habit. When I stirred, IP did not come to pressure and some rice was uncooked. I fired up pot for 3 additional minutes, but ended up with a very thin burned layer of rice on bottom of pot. No big deal, just remove the pot and cover it with foil. Cooked rice will lift off fine and some like the crisp part anyway. Barely any rice wasted from my own newbie error. You’ll just have to soak the pot a little to wash out what’s left…easy peasy. #3 Do not try to do natural release because you’re busy with other dishes. Texture change noted…still good though. #4 Chunky/Thick salsas do not seem to work as a sub. #5 If rice done and you think too much moisture, just leave it on keep warm and excess moisture will be absorbed by rice or evaporate lending to perfect fluffy and delicious Mexican Rice. End of story, make exactly as recipe instructs and you won’t be disappointed! Yum! Thanks again, Bren—I’ve been converted to making your rice in the IP! :)

I am the submitter of this recipe and would like to address the issue that Adela had with the recipe. The "Burn" warning seems to be prevalent to the newer models and there are several possible causes. 1. The pot is too hot from sauteing,  should this happen in the future simply turn off the unit and wait a few minutes  2. The gasket in improperly inserted 3. There are bits stuck to the bottom of the pot 3. The pressure relief valve is stuck and releasing steam....I am sorry that this recipe didn't work for you, best of luck with future recipes:)
I am responding to a question about the pressure on this recipe, there is an error in the instructions that I didn't catch...it should be high pressure, not low.  I'm sorry that this didn't work for you.

This is the best Mexican rice recipe I've tried so far...outstanding! I should note, however, that I didn't have the chicken stock on hand. Instead, I replaced the 1 1/2 Cups of chicken broth with 2 Teaspoons of "Better Than Bouillon" dissolved into 1 1/2 Cups warm water. Also added 1 whole diced Serrano pepper. This is my go to Mexican rice recipe from here on out. The ingredient proportions and cook time were spot on, and I did NOT experience any burn issues whatsoever. To clarify one thing, I waited exactly 5 minutes AFTER engaging the  pressure release mechanism before opening the lid...flawless rice. Seriously. Release the pressure immediately after the 7 minute cook time, and then wait the 5 minutes.

I think the instructions are unclear.  Mine also came out with the burn message.  I was able to salvage it and put it on the stove.  I mixed in the tomato sauce when I was making it.  According to an IP troubleshooting blog I read, and another reviewer noted not to mix the sauce, don't mix the sauce because the liquid at the bottom needs to be thin.  What that means is that after you have mixed everything, pour the tomato sauce on top and don't mix it in, just let it float there, so the liquid on the bottom stays thin.  Next, I am unclear whether I cook on high pressure or low pressure?  I don't know.  I think the flavors are great, but the instructions are unclear for those of us who are not used to using an IP.  Mine is the newer model.

This was perfect!  The kids raved about this and asked for seconds.  I did double it so we would have leftovers.  It's a really mild flavor which is appealing since it didn't overpower what I served it with.

I made this recipe according to the instructions the first time around. The base recipe was decent, but it was too wet and didn't have as much flavor as I hoped. 
My grandmother is from mexico and used to make rice all the time. I took the base recipe and tweaked it a bit. 
I slightly browned the rice on the saute setting before adding the broth/sauce. I used bullion instead of chicken broth and reduced the amount of water by 1/2 cup. I added a tablespoon of onion powder and followed the rest of the recipe! Came out great!

I was so excited to try out this recipe. I followed it to a T in my 6 quart instant pot.  A few minutes  after I closed the lid,  the message “burn“ showed up on my instant pot. #EpicFail

This is a great recipe! I've made it multiple times now and the whole family loves it. For anyone who wants to use brown rice, the only change is to increase the pressure cook time to 28 minutes. I recommend letting the pot cool a couple of minutes after sauteing the onions and garlic to avoid the dreaded burn warning.

Made this using most of the ingredients in recipe. The only change I made was adding cumin/salt to rice and stirring after adding stock, and I needed this to be vegan so I used veggie stock instead of chicken . I added the tomato sauce but didn't stir it in  until  after cooking was complete.  Was a little concerned that I had put too much liquid because as a rule, with pressure cooking rice, you do a 1:1 ratio of rice to liquid. Was somewhat wet when I opened the lid but I stirred and after standing for a few mins it was fine.  Good recipe, thanks for sharing!

I followed the recipe and the rice came out delicious. I will use it again. Took it over to the relatives as a side dish to their Mexican dinner they cooked and everyone loved it. As I recall it makes a lot of servings. Possibly if you're not cooking for lots of people, cut it in half. Thank you Bren for such a great Mexican dish!

This is soooo good. I followed the recipe, only rinsed the rice, poured the tomato sauce on top of the rice without stirring, and added a bay leaf. Really, really good. Next time I will double the recipe.

Good Mexican Rice, but came out burnt on bottom. Got the burn warning only a minute or less into the cook portion. I think maybe the other commentators are correct and it has to do with the saute. Will definitely let it cool off before beginning the rice portion next time and report back. l Followed the recipe and only changes I made was to double it, sub EVOO, and add 1/2 tsp chili powder.

Thank you Bren for this recipe - it saved my Christmas dinner! While I didn’t follow the recipe to a “T”, I did follow the spirit of it. I made modifications to suit my family’s tastes and traditions. I did follow the suggestion of other reviewers and did NOT stir in the tomato sauce prior to cooking. It did just fine on top and when the cooking was over it stirred in beautifully like it had always been a part of the dish. There were many raves about the rice at dinner. We all marveled at the ingenuity of this and it will become a staple in my house for cooking rice going forward.

Awesome recipe - simple - and the whole family loved it. I didn't have avocado oil, so I used my standard no flavor coconut oil. The only other change I made was doubling the recipe.

Flavor was good but had to finish it on the stove top due to multiple “burn” notifications on the Instant Pot.  Poor texture as well but that may have been from switching it to a pan.

Came out great, but couldn't keep it from causing the burn notification. Made sure to scrape the bottom and as soon as it came to pressure it gave me the burn notice. I released the pressure, scraped clear the bottom again, and as soon as it came to pressure again, the burn notification came up. At that point I released pressure and then let it sit for a little and it came out good except for the burnt bottom.

Just got an instapot and made this spanish rice. I suck at making spanish rice in general. This recipe along with my instapot has my rice tasting like restaurant quality! I didnt understand the quick release instructions at the end and opened the pot without letting it sit for 5 minutes longer..I can see how that will make the rice softer. This recipe is great alone..could be even better with extra ingredients such as peas,carrots,pepper or cilantro. Thank you Bren!

Was I supposed to use cooked rice?

I Followed the recipe, but rice was hard and uncooked. 

Doubled cooking time, which is dicey with an Instapot, and rice was still hard.

Hmmmm.....

I had to sub canola oil for avocado oil.  Otherwise I stuck pretty much to the recipe.  Not sure what browning the rice contributed but maybe I didn't do that long enough.  Found that the tomato sauce seemed to overpower the other seasonings.  If I make it again I will increase the seasonings.

This was very tasty rice. I used olive oils (no avocado oil) and used enchilada sauce in place of tomato sauce and spices (because I had extra from dinner). The rice was tender and the veggies were soft. Everything blended very well. No overpowering taste of anything. I should have added more spice along with the enchilada sauce to get a kick, overall a good recipe. Makes 4 small servings, great as a side dish.

Made this recipe minus they cayenne pepper and it turned out great! Follow the instructions and you will be just fine. I had not made rice other than one time and I made this for a baby shower, got lots of compliments. It’s a keeper!

I have tried many Mexican rice recipes.  This is the first one my family liked.  Made as directed with no changes.

I liked the flavor but it had a little to much liquid for me. Next time I'll cut the broth back to 1 cup.

Made as directed. Removed lid and was a little watery, but it thickened as it sat for a few minutes. Easy and a good accompaniment to Instant Pot Salsa Chicken.

Good flavor!  The only thing i changed was to cut the salt in half, subbed chicken broth, subbed olive oil, and I plopped the sauce in without stirring like others suggested. 

After the seven mins, i did a quick release and set my timer for 5 mins. Opened up and fluffed with a fork.

one tip: Immediately out of the pot, it was very soggy. I set out on the counter and allowed some of the wetness to soak in and it was much better after a 20 minute rest.

I didn't have tomato sauce, so added about 1 TBS of tomato paste to existing liquid. No temps for the IP given, so I used Medium level of Pressure cooking.. This rice came out delicious!!

This is perfect! I made as written. After seven minutes the rice was still very wet and I thought it was going to fail. I put in for two more minutes and it was perfect. Highly recommend!

I scaled this down to 3 servings and used olive oil in place of the avocado oil (as that is what I had on hand). I also rinsed the long grain rice for a bit to remove some of the starch. I only cooked this for 6 minutes, due to scaling the recipe down, I figured that it would need slightly less time to cook. It turned out great, and went well with our leftovers that we brought home from the Mexican restaurant over the weekend. Will make again. Thanks Bren!

This was really good!  A great side dish to fajitas, chicken, steak, etc.  Would make again.
