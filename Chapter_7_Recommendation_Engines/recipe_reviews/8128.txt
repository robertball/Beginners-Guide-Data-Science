Note for chefs like me who must cook for beet haters: If your picky eaters know there are beets in the cake and eat the plain cake, they will be able to taste the beets.  However, if they don't know there are beets in the recipe and with the frosting they will not be able to tell.    The texture of the cake is lovely.  I didn't have powdered sugar so didn't make the frosting and instead had my eaters frost their own cupcakes with the store bought cream cheese frosting.

I have baked chocolate beet cakes for years. People think it might be zuchinni but are not sure. This cake freezes beautifully and you have to let the cake rest so all the flavours can blend. I have served it for years and when the cake is gone, I tell my guests there were beets in it -= to their amazement

Was looking for a way to use the beets in my garden and this sounded like a good way to sneak it past my anti-beet husband and son.  They both liked the cupcakes, but others thought they were so-so (nobody knew about the beets). Frosting was runny, even after adding and extra cup of powdered sugar; would use a regular cream cheese frosting recipe next time.

This was great! This has quickly turned into a family favorite and my daughter thinks now the only thing beets are good for is this cake! With our CSA, we get beets, so I had to find something to do with them, and hubby could not guess what "surprise" I had in the cake. Even after I told him, he couldn't taste it... he just thought I made chocolate cake! The frosting turned out fine, but the cake broke up in the frosting when I spread it on. I frosted it a day later, so maybe that's why, but it tasted all the same.

What could I replace the cocoa with? Any suggestion? I used 100% pure cocoa unsweetened (Van Houten) and everybody loved the cake, that's not the problem. The problem is that cocoa makes it resemble a chocolate cake -while it is not- and I cannot help but compare the taste. So I thought: if I find what to replace the cocoa with, I'll be fine. Otherwise, it's very moist and digestible.

Sounded like a great idea.  I have to admit I never frosted the cake.  That probably would have made it a bit more tasty, but I don't think cake should need frosting to be edible. Will stick to eating beets as beets.

This was delicious!  No one even noticed the beets.  I actually turned them into cupcakes for my kids and their friends and everyone loved them.  I used hard white whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour and the cupcakes still turned out wonderfully moist and flavorful.

Very delicous!  My husband and I don't usually like cakes made from scratch because they usually seem dry, but this was fabulous! I will definitely make again! :)

No one could guess it was made of beets!  Very similar to zuchinni loafs.

It was delicious!  I think it only lasted about a day in the kitchen before it was gone.

It was amazing. You'd never know that there were beets in the cake. It tasted even better the second day.

I wanted to try this recipe because the three of us Love beets! I made this knowing that it would be good just by the smell of it baking in the oven! Waiting for my husband's review with anticipation, but sadly he said it was very dry! I told him that most of the review's said very moist so I reviewed the recipe and found my mistake I used 1 1/2 sicks of butter not 1 1/2 cups! Oh well it will give me an excuse to try again even thought disappointed in myself still tasted good and I used peanut butter frosting!

I did the following changes: - 3 eggs instead of 4 (to minimize cholesterol) - 3/4 cup margarine instead of 11/2 of butter because I couldn't bear putting in that much fat - No honey - 11/4 cup sugar instead of 2 cups as I prefer desserts not to be too sweet  I served with a cream cheese frosting and raspberry sauce. It was a little dry (probably because of my alterations) but my guests still loved it! :)

I  used yellow beets and gluten free 1 to 1 baking mix.  It was excellent (really good chocolate cake was a thing of the past...pre-g-f).   My only issue is the center does not  get baked without the top getting burned.  Any suggestions besides cutting off the top of the cake?

I made Red Beet Cake, came out divine. Very soft and flakly and with the cream cheese icing , was so great. I cut the recipe in half and only used a 8x8 glass pan. Just for me and hubby.

Awesome cake! We all loved it, my son who hates beets loved the cake, even after he helped to make it! I used gluten free flour, and since it is so moist, it turned out perfectly!

This cake turned out super good. It looks and tastes much like a red velvet cake and no one noticed the addition of beets. I didn't use the frosting for this recipe we decided to frost with an Almond Joy canned frosting we had in the pantry. Thanks for a great way to sneak some veggies in my kids.

I was wondering about the taste of the beets in this cake but it turned out just great. You don't really taste it.  It makes the cake very moist.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Very moist. My husband, the beet lover, loved this! The kids didn't even finish their one piece though, except of course, the frosting. I'll make it again, probably, since my husband liked it, but for me, I'll stick to a cake where nothing competes with the chocolate flavor.

Yummy.  This cake tastes like a chocolate cake, it is very moist and we liked it alot.
