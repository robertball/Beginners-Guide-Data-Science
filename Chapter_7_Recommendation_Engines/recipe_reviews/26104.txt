This was the best cookie recipe I have ever made.  The cookies are so delicous you wouldn't believe.  My kids ate up the cookies in less than a day.  Trust me after you eat one you'll have to eat another and another.  If you don't have mace then you can add 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg as a substitute.  I really recommned making these cookies!

Wonderful cookie!! Received raved reviews at work. Incidently, I used frosted flakes instead of regular flakes, and the results were excellent. Frosted flakes, because of their extra thickness, tend to hold up better in raw cookie dough, to not lose their crispiness.

These were great! Five STARS all the way!
I made them over the holiday weekend for visiting relatives, and everyone loved them.  I took the tip and substituted the mace(which I didn't have)with nutmeg.
I'm glad that I didn't see those two last wacky reviews, or I might not have tried these....and I'm SO glad that I did!

This is a keeper. You can add anything and everything, use your imagination. I had 1/4 bag of peanutbutter chips, chopped a Hershey special chocolate bar, chopped pecans, Special K cereal (stay away from frosted cereal, makes it to sweet). Next time may try sour cherries and white chocolate chips. Watch the cooking time,hard to tell if their cooked becasue the dough is dark in color. My oven runs hot so I baked the first batch to gague the time. Have fun.

What a GREAT cookie!!!  I really appreciated the review that mentioned slightly underbaking for a chewier cookie (good for hubby .. I like crispy)
And the recipe makes both easily with a small 
adjustment to baking time.
This cookie pleases every eater in my house!!
A Five Star Keeper!  :)

I felt like a mad scientist when I was making these cookies, but they are SOOO good. I made mine with Rice Krispies, 1/2 choc. chips and 1/2 butterscotch along with everything else. All I can say is Yummy, they are for sure going into the Christmas cookie box this year.

These cookies are amazing - everyone at my dinner party ate about ten! I halved the recipe and substituted raisins for walnuts. These I LOVE. Remember they spread ALOT on the cookies sheet.

These cookies were excellent!! I substituted rice kripies for corn flakes & raisins instead of walnuts.  Instead of shaping the dough into balls, I flattened it down.  It makes the cookies crispier.  Definitely a keeper in this house!!

This is a great cookie recipie!  Easy to put together, easy to bake, and they taste wonderful.  I added 1 cup of raisins, and substituted 1 cup of white chocolate chips, for the regular chocolate chips  - considering peanut butter chips for the next time I bake them.  I also used 2 + 1/4 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice instead of all of the other spices listed - the flavor is comparable and you only have to purchase one spice.  Please disregard the nay sayers, this is a recipie worth trying.

You know... whenever I try a new recipe, I try to use all of the ingredients listed and follow it exactly. This recipe is the perfect example of WHY I do that. So many people change it and leave things out without even giving the original recipe a chance! Get this: I don't care much for walnuts, shredded coconut, cornflakes, OR oats, but I made these just like they were supposed to be made minus the cloves because I ran out. And guess what? I ate 3 of them because I thought they were so yummy. So please, don't knock it before you try it! My dough was fine, even a little crumbly but easy to roll, and my cookies didn't spread out like crazy in the oven, and I flattened them quite a bit. The reason why everyone's are soupy or the dough is loose is because it's made to hold all those DRY INGREDIENTS... sillies. Anyway, everyone liked these and in they go to the recipe box :)

Fantastic - I love chewy cookies and these are amazing.  I added an extra cup of choc chips instead of walnuts (my kids don't like nuts) and used dessicated coconut instead of coconut flakes.  Also used rice crispies instead of corn flakes.  Made them a bit bigger and baked them for 15 minutes and they are a huge hit in our house!

I made these exactly as written and they turned out pretty good. They did spread more than I would have liked, though. If I were to make them again, I would leave out the cornflakes. I don't think they added anything.

excellent !!  I just made these....I followed a few of the suggestions and added an extra half cup of flour and a bit less backing soda.  I didn't have mace so instead I just increased the nutmeg to half a tsp.  and used mini choc chips and dark brown sugar as that is what I had.  (next time I will probably use 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and only one and a half cups choc chips).  I added only half a cup of white sugar as I knew the brown sugar and chocolate would be plenty sweet.  sooooo good.  my husband loves them.  I baked them for only 6 min and they didn't look quite done---but they firmed up to a nice chewy gooey cookie (my oven always cooks faster so maybe 7-8 might work for a normal oven.)....oh , and it helps to put the bowl in the freezer in between batches.  this makes the dough easier to handle.

My Dad made these a lot when I was growing up. He called them Garbage Cookies. Silly name, but once you had one, you were hooked. The ingredients 
always vary by what you have on hand, so you rarely had the same cookie twice!
For comfort and memory sake, these will always be my favorite cookie.

Very good!  I wish I'd added cranberries or raisins as well.  I thought about it--after I'd mixed everything in already and was too lazy to mix it again.  I subbed frosted flakes for the corn flakes only bc that's what I have.  It does make the cookies sweeter, so bear that in mind if you do the same.  These do spread a bit, but not so badly that you can't do a lot of cookies to a sheet.  They just flatten out a bit, so don't bother with flattening the dough--I didn't, and they were fine.  10 minutes were perfect for my cookiesl  This makes a lot of cookies, especially if you use a smaller cookie scoop like I did.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are the perfect cookies .. i´ve made them soo many times .. with all kinds of moderations .. I always skip the mace and cloves because I don´t have them in the house .. DELICIOUS :D what I used to do is make a double tripple batch and put portions in a zip lock bag and roll it into a roll and then it´s super easy to cut them down when they are still frozen

BIG hit in my christmas tins this year.  I did had to add some extra water to the batter, it was a bit dry and crumbly as is. Second time around I made it onto bars, worked just as well.

I have found very few cookies that I would rate a five star, but these were excellent. So good in fact that as soon as I was finished baking the first batch I turned around and made a second so I would have enough to share with friends without taking away from my stash lol. My friends loved them just as much as my family. Thank you Melissa

These were good.  I added Rice Krispies instead of corn flakes, and no chocolate chips since my crew won't eat chocolate.  Instead of mace and cloves I used allspice and nutmeg.

Hands down - our new favorite cookie.  Only change was to leave out the nuts and use raisins instead.  These are so good.  The different flavors and textures work so well together.  I did only make 1/2 batch and still got 40 cookies, so I'm glad I did.  Underbaked by about a minute, and the are gooey, chewy good!

Awesome!  These cookies are really great and definitely a keeper.  I didn't have any mace nor do I ever really use it so I just put in an extra pinch of nutmeg.  I also left out the coconut since I'm not a big fan of it.  I followed another reviewer's advice and use frosted cornflakes so that they stayed nice and crisp in the cookie dough.  These cookies are nice and chewy inside but then have great crunch from all the add-ins.  There seemed to be a TON of chocolate chips in this cookie (which made them quite sweet, even for my monster sweet tooth that can usually handle it!) and I usually like a little less so I can also taste the cookie part, so next time I might reduce the chocolate chips a bit and maybe even add more walnuts.  Thanks for the recipe!

I live in Norway and mace is hard to come by so I substituted ground ginger for the mace.  The cookies were delish!  And I agree with the author, less baking makes a better cookie!  I took these to a party and they were gone in a heartbeat!

These taste pretty good. Made them today for a different cookie. I get tired of making the same 4 cookies over and over again. I used Rice Krispies, and choc chips. I meant to add raisins and I forgot. They were kind of hard to mix up, the dough was really stiff even though I used my KA. Hard to get all of the oatmeal incorporated into the dough. Towards the bottom of the bowl, there was some oatmeal just kind of stuck there. They got really flat as they baked. They are chewy and taste pretty good, but don't look especially pretty.  Not sure if I will make them again.

I absolutely LOVE these cookies! I just used whatever I had on hand, and they ended up working great. I didn't have enough white flour so I substituted wheat (which I pretty much hate doing with cookies because I think it ruins them) and I can't even tell the difference! These cookies are just amazing.

Wow!  Great cookies.  You can add almost anything to the basic recipe.  Because I don't like things too sweet I measured the br.sugar loose and reduced the white sugar by 1/4 cup. This recipe is a keeper.  Thanks Melissa.

Outstanding!  Rolling into walnut sized balls will result in regular sized cookies, if rolled bigger, they won't fit in cookie jar, lol. Again, these are heavenly!

Wonderful cookies! A little on the difficult side as far as finding the right amount of dough to use per cookie in order to get them just right, but they're worth the trouble. I made them as Christmas gifts this year and they were a huge hit! Hint: I omitted the cloves to keep the flavor more mild, and they tasted great.

I sub'd 1/2 of the butter for applesauce, went lighter on the sugar, and added a few tbs of ground flax.  Used unsweetened carob chips because I prefer them over chocolate in some things.  I will surely be making these again.

This recipe spread a lot! So I decided to grease a baking dish and make them into bars. I baked them at 350 for about 20-25 minutes. They turned out soft, chewy and tasted great. My family cleaned the pan in two days. Yum.

I followed the recipe exactly and they are quite tasty.  But they came out really flat, I'm not sure why.  Perhaps I will try again with more flour or something.

Very tasty.  I made them much larger than the walnut size recommended, and that way they didn't flatten like the smaller ones.  Bake until you see the light brown edges.  They're not good when the whole top is golden brown looking, too crunchy.  I will make these again, but use wheat flour, raisins instead of the chocolate chips, and maybe another kind of fruit or nut.  The chocolate was good in them, but with the other ingredients, it seemed like it should have been a healthy, hearty cookie instead.

I thought the texture of the cookies were excellent, definitely crisp and chewy. I was disappointed in the flavor. Too earthy for me. I guess I prefer a sweeter dough. Thank goodness there was chocolate in there to balance it out a bit. I used 2 ovens to bake these in, side by side. The convection oven (or fan assisted oven--must decrease temp by 10 degrees when using this type of oven) really made the cookies rise better. The conventional oven made them flat, although chewier.

These are OK, but nothing spectacular.  They taste like a combination of a spice cookie, oatmeal cookie, and chocolate chip cookie, which is nice for a change, but not something I want every day.  They came out chewy for me (not cakey), and pretty attractive looking.  Maybe a nice unique recipe for a get-together or holiday package.  They stayed soft for about a week in a plastic container.

I have gotten so many wonderful recipes from this site.  Thanks!  I love trying new recipes and this recipe is absolutely out of this world.  This cookie is so chewy and yet so crunchy and the taste is super.  How can it not soon be your favorite chocolate chip recipe?  It is mine.

This cookie recipe was FABULOUS!

I baked it for a cookie exchange and everyone absolutely raved.  There wasn't even crumbs left!
Great combination of flavors and textures.  This is going to be a family favorite from now on--thanks!

This is a lovely recipe for versatility and taste ... all the ingredients (and you can be very inventive with this one) meld together nicely for crisp and sweet and chewy.  I used all brown sugar rather than white sugar, but that is the only thing I did differently.

For the dough itself, I found it difficult to manage without a mess, so I used the same idea I do with all my cookie doughs ... I put all the dough on a large sheet of parchment paper, formed it into a roll approx 1-1/2" in diameter, rolled it and placed in freezer till my next pan was ready.  This is super easy then and you just slice off and put on the pan whatever thickness you like.

This recipes has good appearance, texture, taste and versatility... all of these are excellent in any recipe.  Thank you for posting it.

I followed the recipe exactly the first time and my cookies came out super flat! The cookie is actually really tasty so I decided to make them again with the following modifications: bread flour instead of all-purpose, 1 1/2 eggs, and cold butter-flavored shortening. With the modifications the cookies were much fluffier but still not as fluffy I like my cookies to be.  I will make again, however, because they do taste yummy!

Oh my goodness these were wonderful cookies! I read all the comments and have to disagree with so many of them. I found the dough to be very workable and blended wonderfully well.  I used rice cereal rather than corn flakes and had no mace to use so did without, other than that I made the recipe exactly as written. They spread some but not excessively, had a lovely crunchy but soft bite and made a large amount. I will definitely keep this recipe upfront for the future, especially when I want to use up bits and pieces of leftover ingredients. Very flexible recipe.

This recipe is giving me a complex, because I just can't concur with any of the rave reviews.  I found these to be a huge disappointment as stated - they spread out very thin, resulting in a cookie that was burnt around the edges yet still raw in the middle.  They kind of cooked through while cooling on the sheet, but they turned into more of a florentine or lace-type cookie, they were so thin.  I mean, you can have a cookie that's chewy but still have some body to it.  I added more flour to last batch and that produced a fairly decent cookie.  If I were to try this again, I would reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup brown and 3/4 cup white and increase the flour to 2 cups...maybe even more.  On the bright side, I actually quite enjoyed the spices in this - I used the exact amounts called for and found none of them to be overwhelming at all.

I halved the recipe and only baked half of that (the rest I froze into a log shape). They turned out great! Didn't add mace, didn't substitute anything for it. Substituted heavy cream because I didn't have any milk on hand.

These tasted great and the dough is very easy to work with.  It is also easy to make changes and still have the cookies come out beautifully.  I took the suggestion of others and used extra nutmeg instead of mace since I didn't have any.  I only had 2 cups of rolled oats on hand so I added an extra cup of cornflakes.  I made them a little larger and baked for 12 minutes.  My husband, who normally doesn't care for anything too sweet, ate most of the first couple of batches.  Thanks for a great recipe; I will definitely make these again.

A few alterations: I halved the mace (based on a lot of reviews but next time I'll put in the recommended), ommited nutmeg, used whole wheat flour, and used flax corn flake cereal.  I had tons of people come up to me to comment on how yummy the cookies were.  I would make these again!

wow. i made these for my husband for valentine's day and he must have eaten eight or nine that day alone. he took the rest to work and everyone went crazy for them. plus this recipe makes over 4 dozen cookies so you're loaded with chewy goodness for weeks. my rec: keep 'em on the smaller side and cook less time.

I love these cookies.  Toss in a cup of peanut butter and mini M&M's for the kids. I double the batch, roll in balls, freeze on cookie sheets, bag and keep in the freezer.  You have fresh baked, hot cookies in a few minutes by doing this.   I've made them with Rice Krispies and Total cereal also, used walnuts, pecans or peanuts.  Coconut is also a wonderful addition.  Can't say enough about these cookies!

Really nice cookie.  When I was in college I loved a similar cookie from a Whole Foods, and have been looking for something like it ever since.   Everyone really loved them.  They were even better the next day.  I used almonds instead of walnuts, and left out the cloves.   Next time I will use a little less sugar/brown sugar, since i prefer a little fuller cookie.. these were a little flat..  But overall really good..

This recipe was easy to prepare and the cookies were some of the best I have ever tasted. Nice flavor and texture. I also substituted rice crispies for the cornflakes and didnt have cloves or mace but added the other spices. I would definately recommend these as an alternative to plain oatmeal or plain chocolate chip cookies!

Excellent - made 2 times. Omitted mace and nuts (allergies).  Second time I ran out of oats so I used ground up special k for one of the cups also used rice krispies for the cereal.  Best cookies I ever made!

I made these without mace or coconut. I added some white chocolate chips because I didnt have sufficient semisweet ones. Also, I substituted the corn flakes for Special K. VERY GOOD!

Exactly what I was looking for, I've made these cookies several times and I always change them up.  I've made them with a lot more coconut, no cloves and white sugar and white chocolate chips.  The only limit with these cookies are your imagination.

Tasted good, but spread out so much that they were ugly.  Be sure to up the flour and maybe decrease the baking soda a bit.

We made 1/2 quantity for my daughter to take to school.  Unfortunately as there are several nut allergies, we were slightly restricted in our ingredient choice.  However, we used Fruit & Fibre cereal (minus the nuts) and Golden Nuggets cereal, in place of the nuts and cornflakes.  Not sure how many we will have left to take to school tomorrow! Yummy!

Oh my, these were a hit.  They are so tasty with all the different ingredients - and the corn flakes add a wonderful crunch!  The spices make these cookies delicious, and are perfect for fall!

Great recipe! I added another half a cup of flour and brought down the baking soda just a smidge after reading the rest of these reviews. Used white chocolate chips in one batch and peanut butter chocolate chips in another. Almonds instead of walnuts and rice krispy cereal instead of cornflakes in another batch. Also made another batch with raisins. This recipe makes quite alot of cookies which leaves the margin for imagination very wide. Tried a few things and these cookies were amazing every time. Very chewy and are an instant hit!

This recipe got many raved reviews.  The cereal added a welcomed texture.  No need to buy mace just for this recipe (it's not a common staple around here).  Adding an extra 1/8 t. of nutmeg worked just fine.  Due to family preference, the dough was split in half at the end and 1/2 cup of pecans was added to one half and 1/2 cup of raisins to the other half  (no walnuts were added to either half).  It may seem odd to have all these ingredients together (especially the spices and the chocolate) but somehow (and quite well) this recipe works.  Try it, if you like oatmeal chocolate chip cookies, I don't think you'll be disappointed.

These were very good. My first batch came out too flat and crispy, so the second time around, I added an additional half cup of flour and used a bit less baking soda. The second batch were thicker and we enjoyed them more. I also omitted the mace, nutmeg and cloves, as I didn't think they would give the sweeter taste I prefer in a chocoate chip cookie. The cookies still weren't quite as sweet and chocolatey as we prefer, but they got good reviews around here. I'll probably stick with a more traditional chocolate chip cookie recipe next time.

I remembered cooking a big batch of these - using this basic recipe, with some addition of pecans, walnuts, raisins and flax seeds (all I can find in my kitchen cupboards) - and it was great - and it's all gone when i brought it to the office!  Just made it again today, but now I think it's a bit too salty! So, not sure what was different from last time.  But I still like it a lot!

I'd rate these cookies about 8 out of 10.  I found they dried out quite quickly in the cookie jar and were, therefore, crumbly.  Perhaps air tight storage would solve this problem. The flavour was good but not exceptional.

These cookies really do have a lot of stuff but they Tasted Wicked Good.  I just didn't have any Coconut and just omitted it. The only problem I had, probably due to "no coconut" was taking them off the cookie sheet after amply cooling them. They fell apart and cracked real easy.  But, we didn't really care, they tasted awesome anyway.

Love these cookies. I did a healthier version,substituting gluten free flour, used only one cup of brown sugar, no white sugar,only one cup vs two of chocolate chips and it was definitely sweet enough. I think u could even put less butter. But butter is so good.

Loved them-makes a ton of cookies!!  Used butterscotch & choc chips-no nuts.  Butterscotch kinda of overwhelmed them.  Will try with peanut butter & choc chips next time.  I cant stand coconut, but you cant taste it in these & actually makes for a nice consistency in the cookie.  Thanks!

I tried my hand at this recipe and my boyfriend couldn't even wait til they were done before loving them! I didn't have walnuts or cornflakes but I used Banana Nut Crunch cereal crushed up instead. (I also added crushed up Golden Grahams to see if anyone would notice!) They came out great and look just like the picture! Very pleased! Testing them out on classmates and family tomorrow!

I loved this Recipe. Instead of Doing the Chocolate Chips though, [Because we were out,] I used Hershey's Cocoa. Though im sure any Cocoa would Suffice. It Turned Out Absolutely Delicious. But i disregarded the brown sugar and added more white granulated Sugar. Please Tell me if you like it when you try it!

I was surprised how good these were! I found adding the corn flakes right before putting them on the pan was the only way they would stay crispy. I will definitely be making these again in the near future.

These are so good! They are not like traditional chocolate chip cookies, so if you're seeking Toll House, you might be disappointed. I love all the added ingredients. Thanks!

I don't understand all the raves because I thought they were "just okay". I followed the recipe exactly and I thought they made my house smell like potpourri - a little too much spice I think for my liking. I also think there was no need for cornflakes as they added notihng to this.

Made these without coconut (my wife doesn't like it) and walnuts (I don't like them), and added peanut butter chips instead.  Could NOT for the life of me roll the cookies; the "dough" was so loose and sticky that it was like trying to roll Elmer's glue.  Worked fine as a drop cookie using two spoons, though; I bet it would also work to refrigerate the dough for a bit before shaping the cookies.  The cookies came out well, very chewy, very sweet, and with a hint of "what's that familiar flavor?" with all the spices.  The cookies were definitely better after they'd rested overnight - the texture firmed up and they became much more satisfying to bite.  If we make them again, we'll try Heath Bar chunks instead of PB chips.

I am used to healthier and mealier oatmeal cookie recipes and was disappointed in these cookies. The flavour just wasn't there like it should have been. The amount of sugar is way too much (they also spread a lot) and could use at least another 1/2 cup flour and coconut. I didn't see the point of the cornflakes (I used bran) since it really didn't add anything.  I would try another oatmeal chocolate chip recipe with more substance!

What a wonderful cookie.  It tastes like a chewy chocolate bar.  I added the cinnamon but only 1/8 tsp each of cloves and allspice - no other spices.  The result was a mild hint of spice.  My family find walnuts too bitter so I used pecans and rice krispie cereal insead of corn flakes.  
  They went fast and this recipe has now made the rounds of the neighbourhood.

Good cookies!  I omitted all spices except  cinnamon and used m&m's for the chocolate chips.  Had to bake for 14 min and cookies did flatten- may try adding a bit of extra flour next time like some of the other reviews suggest.  Very good flavor!

These were rather good. I substituted 1/8 tsp nutmeg for mace and I substituted pecans for walnuts. The coconut couldn't be tasted, so the cookie rather resembled a chocolate-chip oatmeal cookie. Next time I will add more coconut and extra chocolate chips. Friends and family enjoyed these cookies.

I made these last night and they are delicious! I halved the recipe, didn't have mace, forgot the vanilla! and added white chocolate and cranberry/raisin mix and they still were wonderful.  I must admit when I first read the recipe there was so much it made me wonder if they'd be good but they are.  Try them out!

I made this quite a bit different. First, I didn't have any corn flakes or regular cereal, but I did have Uncle Sam Cereal - so I substituted that. It tastes good but the flax seeds are powerful - if you're not a fan of them I wouldn't recommend that substitution. I also used 1 cup whole wheat flour instead of all regular flour. I used egg whites instead of full eggs. Finally I used a combination of chocolate, butterscotch, and white chocolate chips to make up the 2 cups of chips. That part was my favorite about these cookies - every bite tasted a bit different. Yummy!

These are wonderful cookies; rave reviews all around.  I added some flaxseed and used 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour.  Oh, and I substituted some of the chocolate chips with peanut butter chips (my little one's special request).  They turned out great.  Pretty healthy, too.

Very good chewy substantial cookie.  I was out of nutmeg, and mace so i just left it out.  Was still great.  I believe cookie recipes are suggestions mainly, cause you can throw anything in em.  But these are my new favorite!

These cookies tasted very good although they have been a little dry both times that I have made them.  I basically do a pantry search before I make them and add whatever else I have on hand.

This is a delicious recipe, an instant hit with the kids for taste. We started of with a few hiccups. I had to convert American cups to UK ounces. I felt the mixture was too dry for the kids to handle as it crumbled and they lost interest, so I added 2 extra eggs, That seem to do the trick. They gave the cookies 10 out of 10 for taste.

My family absolutely loved these cookies! I'm vegan, so I wasn't able to taste them, but based on the speed with which they disapered, I missed out big time. Wonderful! They smell terrific, too.

these are good but came out as little firm mounds for me- i have now made them twice- and are certainly not runny as others have described.  the only change i made is that I left out the white sugar as i don't like things too sweet.

A disappointment.  Too thin, didn't stay together well, too much "stuff" and not enough "cookie".  The only saving grace for this was that I can crumble this mess up and use it for ice cream topping.  The taste was only average.  Deleting this from my recipe box.

This is the greatest cookie recipe I have found yet! Instead of using corn flakes, I used Honey Roasted Honey Bunches of Oats, which tastes great all together. I would probably add more flour the next time, because the dough was a little sticky to handle.

What a fun and yummy recipe. My kids loved them, and I have a tough crowd. You can also make a non-dairy (parev) version, substituting margarine for the butter and non-dairy cream for the milk, and it comes out really well. Next time I will go for the butter and I am sure it will be even more delicious.

These cookies are great! I made some additions to make it healthier though :) I used 1/2 cup sucanant and 1/2 cup cane sugar for the sugars. I substituted the corn flakes with more oats. I added a handful of raisins and white chocolate chips, while only using 1/2 cup c.chips.   All in all, excellent recipe! Thx :)

Really really good! Make sure to undercook since they have so many dry ingredients. Next time I may add less oats and more cornflakes but that would be the only change.

I did not care for these cookies. We didnt put in the coconut, walnuts, or corn flakes because we felt they were unnecesary. They turned out soupy and after baking they looked like an extremely flat sheetcake. Also they were COATED with butter. Maybe we're just horrible cooks.. and also while we were baking them the "cookies" smelled like auntie anne's pretzels.

Everybody loved these cookies. I did not have mace, so used nutmeg instead as per other reviews. Also used chopped pecans instead of walnuts since that's all I had. I halved the batter and stirred in chocolate chips and M&Ms in one half and in the other used craisens and white chocolate chips. The latter was my favorite by far, but of course the kids preferred the choc. chips and M&Ms. GREAT RECIPE!

These were interesting... tasted almost like a gingerbread or molasses cookie at first bite because of all the spices, but the rest of the ingredients added a strange twist.

This is now my family's new favorite cookie!  I followed the recipe except for the mace and walnuts, which I left out.   They were delicious and the recipe makes a nice big batch!

Absolutely delicious! The subtle hint of coconut, the ocasional walnut crunch, and a delightful chewy consistency. The cookie dough is very easy to mould as well! 

I would say to cook it for 12 minutes, as 8-10 isnt long enough.

Very Good.  I followed the recipe almost to a T.  I used 1/2 C marg, 8oz baby food prunes, 8oz apple sauce.  For the flour I used 1 C. flour, 1/2 C whole wheat.  I used 3 eggs instead of 2.  Also, I didn't flatten the cookies before baking.

Soooo amazing! Made these for a BBQ and ran out almost immediately!! YUM! Love the little "surprise" crunch of the corn flakes. Could imagine these with raisins instead of chocolate chips, too.

I made according to the recipe except without cornflakes (didn't feel like paying $4 for a box just to use a cup) and coconut (hubby is allergic).  Great!  Spices were strong but I thought that is what makes this cookie different from every other cookie.  Gave away many to friends so we wouldn't eat all 60 servings, although we probably could have.

I get angry when I see Husband moving towards the cookie jar; these cookie are amazing!  I pretty much stuck to the recipe except for two additions: rubbed half a vanilla bean in with the sugar (had some left over from another recipe),  and threw in a handful or so of white chocolate chips.  Couldn't find mace,  so I followed another reviewers recommendation to sub it for more nutmeg.  Seemed just fine,  but I have no idea what mace tastes like.  I could be missing out on an even more amazing cookie,  but I don't think we mortals can handle the awesomeness! 
I don't know if it's my oven or not (not a proficient baker by any means),  but these hardly seemed done after 8-10 minutes.  The first batch I left in for 16 minutes after testing with the toothpick method, and although not burned,  they may have been just slightly overdone.  I left subsequent batches in for 12 minutes and then let them cool on the cookie sheet to solidify a little more.  The results were great!  Hope this helps the more clueless bakers like me. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These cookies are AWESOME! Every time I've made them someone asks me for the recipe. I wish I could say it was my own original recipe! The only thing I do differently from the original recipe is I use half dark chocolate and half semisweet chocolate chips (so 1 cup of each). If you like dark chocolate, it's a great way to incorporating the flavor without making it overwhelming. Try it! Everyone loves it!

Left out the mace seems it is only the outside of a nutmeg shell thats ground no need ..we added coconut, peanuts,  m&ms plain and peanut. Peanut butter morsels.  Chocolate chunks butterscotch morsels,and raisins they are a very full cookie  next time use 1/2 peanut butter instead of butter it gives the cookie a better peanut butter flavor ..but this is a good base for the EVERYTHING COOKIE

My stepfather requested these after eating them 30 years ago on a fishing trip.  He basically listed off the ingredients and called them "dish sink" cookies.  After some googling and research I found this recipe.  I didn't use the cloves or mace and I added 1 cup of raisins.  He said they are exactly what he remembers and he loves them.

Overall, this was a tasty treat. I would definitely cut back on the oatmeal. Felt like there was too much of it. Besides that, everything worked well together.

Dang good little cookie.
Made it close to recipe, but in the spirit of "whatever you've got in the kitchen, less the sink" I threw in leftover partial packages of delicious bits from previous baking adventures.
Turned out delicious.  
AND the baking pantry is so tidy!
Highly recommend.

I halved the recipe and got about 3 doz. I really liked the texture, soft and chewy.  I increased the amount of vanilla to 1 tsp, and the salt gave it a nice flavor (would even add a bit more). All of the spices give it an additional layers of flavor, something that your usual chocolate chip cookies don't have. Baking time of 9 min is about right. After I took them out of the oven, I found that 5 min was a little long. They were difficult to remove from the pans; I'd remove them at about 3 min. Super recipe that you could change-up with your own additions! I'm also finding them a little addictive!

These cookies were really good.  The mace, cloves and nutmeg give them a really good flavor.  I omitted the nuts and coconut.  The only complaint I had about these cookies is they stuck together.  Oh well, a good excuse to have two cookies instead of one!
