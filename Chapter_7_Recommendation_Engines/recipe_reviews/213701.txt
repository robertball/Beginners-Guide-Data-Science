I felt this was a very good recipe, however next time I make it I will use stewing meat.. Flank steak is for quick searing not a long simmer.  Definitely not tender enough after about an hour.  Also, there is no need to warm the beans ahead of time just throw them in the pot about five minutes before the soup is done.  Make sure you rinse and drain the beans first or you will get a pastey taste.  You don't need chicken granuels if you don't have them.  Use 3 boullion cubes.  Same thing.  I actually used chicken "stock" (not broth) for more flavor and additional liquid.  I served this with all the toppings mentioned but added Mexican shredded cheese, sour cream and crushed lime flavored Xochitl tortilla chips.  These chips are very thin and crispy. Excellent!!

My family and I loved this recipe... and I am having leftovers for lunch today!  I was a little hesitant to try it since no one had rated it but I am so glad I did!  Our grocery store did not have serannos, so I used jalapenos, and I cooked the onion with the meat- only because we don't like raw onion.  It was really yummy. We had it with a salad with avocado dressing and sliced avocados.  I liked it alone, but the rest of the family ate it with corn tortillas.  I honestly didn't think combining the beans with the meat mixture would taste so good, but it was.  I will make it again for sure!  Thanks for the recipe!  :)

This recipe is great!! I am from Guadalajara, and I know that the traditional way of making it is, with tomatillo. But I grew up eating my mom's version without it and it is amazing as well. Now when I'm homesick, I cook it for my gringo husband.
The only thing that this recipe is missing for an A+ on my end.... is to have some avocado tacos with it. Oh yes ma'am! 
Warm up some corn tortillas, place some avocado slices in the middle, sprinkle some salt, roll, and take a bite with every spoonful of carne en su jugo. Enjoy!!

This was great! only minor improvement would be slow cooking the meat with the tomatio sauce for a long period of time (8 hours?). Then adding the beans and bacon in about and hour before eating. Can't wait to try this one again!!

A total hit with my family.  Very Yummy!  I did however use fresh cooked beans (de la olla) instead of the canned, which i think made the recipe even better.

The recipe works best with very thin slices of flank steak or skirt steak. I have tried both. Last week I blended a few pieces of the browned meat with the tomatillo for added flavor and the result was even better.

We loved this recipe!  I served (almost like a gravy) over plain white rice.  I also had a bowl of tortilla chips on the table to dip with.  DELISH!!!  Our grocery store was out of serrano peppers.  So I substituted 1 large banana pepper.  I will try with the serrano peppers the next time.

Wonderful!  We used this on toastadas and it was great with shreaded lettuce, green onions and cheese.  We also used the chile de arbol hot sauce from the "authentic enchiladas" recipe on this site.  I've already made two batches of hot sauce to go with the leftovers of this dish!  Yummy!

Yum! Turn this into a crock pot recipe and skip the expensive meat!  Choose the beef stew chunks, already cut and ready to go.  After you brown the meat in step 2, be sure to drain the juice for a better tasting crock pot outcome.  Everything else is perfect as is.  I add extra hot peppers since the crock pot cooks out some of the hotness.  I make this almost weekly, eat if for dinner, take it to work, eat it with eggs for breakfast.

The most authentic Mexican food I've ever been able to create AND the most authentic than any restaurant I've found.

Must try - It is so hard to mess up this one.

I live south of Guadalajara, and this recipe is dead on for how the locals make it. I think the reason some of those outside of Mexico are having trouble with the flank steak being not tender enough is that we don't age our meat here in Mexico. I saw some people draining the beans, but that adds extra liquid and flavor. I don't think this recipe needs to be altered at all, unless you want to call it something else.

One of THE best I've discovered on this site.  Not a well known recipe but absoloutely wonderful comfort food. Using grilled meat or searing it first gives more depth of flavor.  
I also oven roasted the tomatillos and a jalapeno before blending.

This was sooo yummy! I am going to start making this regularly. The only change I made was I used stew meat (easier) and instead of the serrano peppers I used chopped green new mexico chile (we buy sacks and store bags of it in the freezer) I've been craving an authentic mexican meal and this hit the spot! My husband loved it and even suggested making it for family get togethers! Yum!

The flavor was great. I was worried with 3 cayenne peppers that it would be too spicy. But I could have added more. It was hardly noticeable. I agree that a cheaper cut of meat could have been used and definitely simmer this for a long time (crockpot!) to tenderize the meat. A great way to use tomatillos.

Love love loved this soup.  I actully used a combo of short rib and sirloin steak.  I didnt have enough serrano peppers so I added a can of green chiles.  This was a nice change from the usual soups I whip up and will be making this one often.

This was really great! I couldn't believe how well this turned out.  Definitely a keeper. My neighbor gave me some tomatillos from his garden and I wasn't sure what to do with them until I found this recipe.  I followed the directions  but with two changes. I only used two serrano peppers (canned- couldn't find fresh ones at the supermarket) because I don't like it spicy hot.  I also used turkey bacon instead of real bacon.  Next time I think I cut the bacon back to three slices because it seemed to overpower the other flavors  somewhat.  I was a little worried the water tomatillo mix would be too thin and have no taste, but in the end everything worked out perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this on a rainy day and was satisfied that I had some nice warm stew for a chilly fall day. I added a little more of the seasoning to give it more flavor i think going forward id add the cilantro into the tomatillo mixture and add the chicken seasoning stuff in there too along with pepper and salt. I paired this with cilantro rice and that boosted the flavor. I like this as a base recipe but next time I'm going to play with the add ons a bit.

I made it in a pressure cooker like an Instant Pot, but mine is a Fagor Multicooker. I am thrilled because that made it so easy! It was very good. I used Stew meat  and soaked dried beans and this is what I did in order. Diced the bacon and browned it in the bottom of the multicooker, removed it and browned the (cut up smaller)stew meat in about a tbsp of bacon grease. As the juices started coming out of the meat I poured it off and saved it. While the meat was cooking, I put the  raw tomatillos, serranos, garlic, chicken base and meat juices in the food processer, pureed it and then poured it over the meat in the pot. Then I took soaked beans and placed them on top. Lastly I measured the water in the container  that I saved the meat juices in and then poured it over the beans. It was just the right amount to cover the beans. I set it to pressure cook for 20 min. The beans were a little overdone but it was well worth the time savings of not cooking separately.  We topped it off with the bacon, the rest of the ingredients and then used another reviewer's suggestion of dipping avocado tacos in it while eating. Yum!

I make this at least once a month it's easy and so tasty. My dad is from Jalisco, MX and says it the best carne en su jugo he's ever had! I now make this every time he comes to visit.  I brown the flank steak in the bacon grease and gives it a great flavor, I also keep the seeds in 2 of the peppers for a little more kick.

Made this today as my step-son loves Mexican food above all else. I took a reviewer's suggestion and used pot roast. Also, cut it into bite size pieces, browned it in the bacon fat, then put it into a crock pot with the tomatillo mixture. Took other suggestions and used beef broth vs. chicken bouillon. I watched a video of a version being made online...that person kept taking the liquid that was coming off of the flank steak and draining it into a pot then used this liquid to mix with the tomatillo to puree. This way the flank steak was sauteed without too much liquid which might be why the reviewer found the steak did not get tender for them. Using the chuck roast and crock pot saved quite a bit of time. With all that said...I received rave reviews from my picky husband and super picky step-son so well worth the effort PLUS against my prediction, I loved it!!! Really quite good...has a nice bite but not overly spicy. I served this with rice on the side and made some cornbread...just a mix with some cheese and part of a can of chili peppers stirred in. Don't skip any of the finishing touches...each one adds to the complex flavor..I thought the bacon was weird but it truly is delicious...the fresh cilantro etc. are all musts.

Loved it! I used Arracharra (flank steak tenderized by puncture from the butcher) from the Mexican grocery store. I cut the steak into pieces and marinated in a bag with fresh lime juice and Adobo while other things were cooking. I also made my own pinto beans, using 2 C dry beans, soaking overnight in 9 C water and then cooking w/2 pieces bacon, onion & garlic. My end product was much darker than the photo, maybe because my beans turned out dark. Delicious!

This was sooooooo good! The only thing I did differently was I used sirloin steak instead of flank simply because I couldn't find it. My husband has already asked me to make this again next week.

I've made this recipe twice in 2 weeks. My family loves it. The only thing I did different the second time was I used a roast and cut it into chunks instead of using the flank steak. It was super soft with the roast and a lot more juices also.

I love this recipe, the only thing I can add is that I cut the tomatillos in half and chopped the garlic before putting it in the water, otherwise there was no need to change anything.  This is by far the best recipe on this site.

I will definitely be making this soup again! I made it a few years back for my Spanish class for extra credit, and absolutely fell in love with the recipe. It is now a winter staple in my house, and my dads favorite meal!

This is an absolutely delicious dish. Rather than flank steak I use skirt steak. This will be done in 35 minutes or less if you use  skirt steak. The other thing I do is I add salt to taste. So delicious!

I'm a single Father of  three teenage daughters, and we have been enjoying this one together for a few years now.  This is at least a bi-weekly staple in our menu-and also very easy as long as you think about the timing and have the ingredients that need to be cooked ahead of time, it's very simple.  I don't heat the beans (I use Ranch Style beans in the blk & yellow can).  Thanks for the recipe!

Oh my goodness! I buy this from a Mexican restaurant I go to often & always wanted to make it. It seems really complicated but it's quite simple. I loved it! My kids ask why I've never fixed it before & asked for it every day until I had to make it again that same week. I fix it once a week now since everyones so fond of it (it's so fast & easy). I made minor changes, may be major to some but I use seasoned fajita meat out of the deli section at my neighborhood grocery store, can of chicken broth,chopped celery & rotel? Yes rotel...I could not find green tomatoes anywhere? Eat Greedy!...

Absolutely delicious! I simmered for an hour and flank steak was completely tender! My boyfriend from Guadalajara gave my meal an A+ and said he felt like he was back in Guadalajara! One change I made was 30 minutes into the simmer I added the bacon grease.

This was very good. We forgot to put the bacon it even. Won't next time. I used Flat Iron steak and it was tender right from the start. I still simmered it for a couple hours just to absorb more flavors. I will leave one Serrano with seeds next time to just kick it up a bit. No one said whether or not to drain the beans. I assumed to drain them.

It’s a good recipe to follow although I do think the flank steak is not tender enough for all that simmering. Maybe a stew meat will be a lot more tender and more flavor. Otherwise everything else for ingredients was wonderful.

I used a few extra tomatillos and meat because I'm making a bigger batch. One thing we do to make the broth thicker is to blend some of it with cooked meat and then add it back to the pot. I include chopped yellow potatoes in my recipe as well.

This was really good, even though I went overboard on the chili peppers so it was VERY hot. I toned it down with plenty of cheese and sour cream. Next time I will do as the recipe says and only use three. I had some leftover thin sliced brisket so I used that for the meat. It worked even though not the most tender. Thin slicing helped a lot. Next time I’ll use flank steak but stick with thin slices. I also didn’t see a need to heat the beans before adding them to the pot. This was my first time cooking tomatillos. I used canned ones, which worked well for me. I’m already looking forward to eating this again!

I add pickled jalepenos and alot of the juice from them to taste. And i cook the flank on a cast iron skillet whole it nicely sear on both sidsides about 5 minutes each side then i let them sit for a few minutes. Then cut them into nice thin bite size pieces, throw them back in the skillet and continue to cook til they are about medium cooked and finish the cooking in the sauce .

This was delicious! It was my second time making it, so I did make minor changes... I used beef chuck instead for a more tender meat and let it simmer up to 2 hours. I also used jalapeños instead of serranos and added my buillon to the tomatillo mixture before blending. Also, I add half the bacon to the pot to simmer and the rest I add to the top once it’s served to give it an extra yumminess and as other have mentioned, there’s no need to boil your beans on the side, just drain them and add them to the pot! Definitely a great fall dinner :)

Love this! This last time we used some instapot frijoles instead of canned and WOW- it really took it to a whole new level. Also be sure to add avocado slices, cilantro and lime. Pour some salt on a tortilla and roll it up for dipping. So good and SO filling!

Definitely make this again. I simmered 4 cloves of garlic and 1/2 onion in the tomatillos. Also used carne asada meat with half sliced onion, tbls of cumin and it only took an 1 1/2 hours to get tender. A little extra of garlic powder, pepper, and kosher salt. The sauce was thin so took out 1/2 cup of the sauce and whisked it with a tbls of flour to thicken. Served it with mexi cheese and sour cream on tortillas. Oh my! Yum

This came out absolutely perfect! I substituted Top Sirloin thin cut steaks that were $5/lb and couldn't notice a difference in the flavor from the previous times I've made this recipe. I made it in my Instant Pot using the saute function for the bacon and then the top sirloin, and then I let it simmer on slow cook for an hour. The meat was incredibly soft, so I was happy with the adaptation to the Instant Pot. I had this in a restaurant once, and I fell in love with it. I am so glad that I found this recipe!

made this for dinner. Learned a huge lesson in ensuring meat is not dry. Bought beef chunks and cut them into 1/2 inch chunks. Don't do this. leave chunks as is (about 1 inch), sear and make sure that pan is not overcrowded. Then simmer for no more than an hour. had to add seasoning (recipe was too bland). Added garlic salt and seasoned salt to taste. Kept everything as recipe indicated. Nothing is working then overcooked dry beef. However, the juice and bean/bacon addition was very tasty.

Absolutely amazing recipe. I tried it at a restaurant my husband loves it so much so I thought why not try to make it at home. It was very easy to make and I am no cook. Some amendments I made. Added 3 more cups of water to make it more soupy after adding the blending sauce to the meat. I used 2 peppers vs 3 as they are very hot and the soup was still spicy after the fact. I used 3 chicken boullian instead of broth. I did not cook the canned pinto beans they are very soft I just added them into the soup at the end and everything went great. I precut the bacon prior to frying I'm not sure if that was the easiest thing to do but I didn't have to crunch it later :)  I also garnished it with some radish as the restaurant had radish in it and squeezed a wedge of lime aswell prior to eating. We are this with tortillas ! Yummy I recommend this recipe ! It was my first time cooking with tomitallo and I'm so happy I did !

This is a great recipe I made it for my wife and nieces which are Mexican and they all loved it. I did make a few changes though first I doubled the the tomatillo ingredients and browned them in a dry pot added 3 cups of water and boiled until cooked through. Then cooked 12 slices of thick bacon  in a stock pot drained most of the grease reserved some for the carne browned the carne n added the bouillon then the green sauce. Rinsed the beans and added to the meat. Next time I’ll make fresh beans drain then add and add extra carne.

I now add the tomatillos one onion 3 Serranos and 2 gloves of garlic and roast them in the oven and then to the blender with a little water and the bouillon.

This is a delicious dish! It's one of those that I've come back to over and over... and if I forget to make it for a while my husband will remind me! Two things I've learned: 1) Give the meat a good long time to simmer in the tomatillo mixture - about 2 hours and 2) raw onions make it really wonderful.... and the other toppings are pretty key, too!

It turned out wonderful although I added a few more ingredients. I added 1 teaspoon of coriander, 1 teaspoon of garlic powder, 1 teaspoon of cumin, 1 teaspoon of coarse black pepper and 1/4 teaspoon of onion powder

I doubled the recipe because I knew it would be delicious and I was right! Fed 6 people and had some left overs for breakfast the next day. I will definitely make again.

Have used this recipe many times. Always my go to. Don't forget to garnish with seared Chile de arbol and diced avocado. The best carne en su jugo I've had was from Los Gallos in Chicago on 26th st. They use celery also in their tomatillo sauce. I've never tried it but am curious to see if it makes a difference.

I love this soup. I tend to use a cheaper cut of meat, cut it into small cubes and simmer it for longer. you get the tender meat without the high price.
Also, serving it with a few slices of avocado and chips was fantastic.

Pretty easy, and leftovers lasted forever and made great tacos! I didn't use bacon just because I was too cheap, but it still turned out great!

I love this soup. It is delicious and I always get compliments on it. I have been making it for about 2 years  now so I have added my own touch to it. I like to add 1-2 more Serrano, more bacon and diced up hot dogs!

Followed the recipe, except that I seared the meat in bacon drippings and cooked it in the slow cooker on low for a few hours. Added the beans and bacon during the last 30 minutes. It was even better after a couple days in the refrigerator. Will make it again and again.

I have made this recipe for my very picky family.  They all absolutely love it!  I make no changes at all and it is exceptional each time.  I have used various types of meats, Tri-tip, london broil..... I tend to use less fatty meats due to personal taste. But it still comes out great! Many thanks for this go to recipe!

I made this tonight and didn't change a thing and it came out perfectly. I kept wanting to drift off from the simple recipe, but I didn't stray. Great taste. The cilantro, lime and onion added before serving are key.

I LOVE this recipe!!!! My Girl Scout troop grew tomatillos in our community garden and didn't know what to prepare with them.  We tried this recipe, and it is a staple for all of us now!  Easy and delicious...a perfect combination (and it's very reasonable cost-wise).

Absolutely delicious!  I didn't have flank steak, so I used part of roast I had, cut into pieces.  I also used homemade beans versus canned.  Three of three kids gave it a thumbs up, and so did hubby.  This will be part of our regular rotation.  I didn't make it as spicy as the recipe calls for, but only because of the kids.

I cannot speak to its authenticity, but I can tell you this is a really good bean soup.  Just like ham ‘n beans, only made with beef.  I could not find flank steak, so I used top round steak.  I just finished making a large pot of pinto beans, so I decided to use those instead of canned.  I’m glad I did because I found this to be very salty.  I can’t image what it would have tasted like had I used canned beans.

I usually cook the beans and add the meat so that it releases its juices into the bean broth...its so yummy. Also, if you keep the bacon aside and add it when you add your topping (cilantro, onions, lime...etc) it adds a delicious crunch. :)

Great dish for those end of garden vegetables. I love the taste especially with the fresh onion and cilantro served on top of each bowl. The canned pinto I used had jalapeños in them which added nice flavor. I doubled the recipe because this recipe states it feeds only four. I have extra ingredients on hand plus want some for the freezer. I will definitely make this again.

Delicious, I didn't have much time to let the meat simmer so mine was a little tough, but the flavor was fabulous
