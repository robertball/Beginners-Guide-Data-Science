This is a keeper! Great with turkey,chicken, or pork, or even a small dish alone. Have to be very exact with ingredient amounts or can turn out runny, but recipe delivers as advertised. Just be sure to drain the sweet potato's thoroughly after cooking. I did alter the 8 serving portion a bit for personal taste: it's very sweet, so reduced white sugar to 1/2 cup; added 3/4 tsp each of ground cinnamon and allspice; used evaporated milk instead of regular milk...makes for a creamier mixture; and be careful not to overdo the pecans (one cup is a lot!). Everyone always wants seconds!!

My children ask for this recipe every Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter.  

I usually don't bring the canned sweet potatoes to a boil first, however; I just use them drained right out of the can, and increase the baking time of the casserole to about 50minutes to 1 hour.

this is the one! pecans add a more sophisticated touch than marshmallows and cut the sweetness and boy, is it sweet. Don't use the canned yams. Instead use 3 cups (approx. 3 potatoes) of real mashed sweet potatoes. Sooo much better. And you can get away with decreasing sugar.

This is a yummy, yummy dish.  I made this three times over this last holiday season.  Since I only had the 29 ounce cans, I used 2 of those cans and multiplied the recipe by 1.5, and baked it in a 9x13 casserole dish.  It came out perfect!  I had to bake it for more than 35 minutes...more like 45-50 minutes.  Yummy!  I'll be making this for every holiday.  Added 12/22/06:  I also made it this year and it's just as yummy!  This time I baked the same 1.5 times the recipe and split into two 2-quart trays, and baked it for about 45 minutes.  It was yummy and made it easy to bake one recipe for two potlucks.

I had two Thanksgiving Dinners to go to and made this for both, my 18 year old son came in the kitchen because of the wonderful richness that he smelt. Once he saw this, before I could say that it was to take for a Dinner, he was dishing up a big serving. He ate every bite and had 3rds and he hates sweet potatoes! I made more and it was a instant hit. Also made it for a large church dinner (100+people) I made 40 batches and we still ran out. I was asked for the receipe so much that I printed out over a 100 of them. This is definatly a huge hit at any holiday dinner. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe it will always be on our table.

A scrumptious, oh-so-easy version of the classic Southern holiday dish. This was a huge hit -- I took it to a potluck and got tons of compliments. The filling was a bit liquidy, so next time I will cut down on the milk and butter. (Please note that you do DRAIN the potatoes after you cook them; I've made this four times now and I'm 2 for 4 on remembering that.)

Gorgeous and easy to make, I did however halve the amount of sugar added to the potatoes and it was still plenty sweet and yummy. The pecan topping is so goooooood! Try it on baked salmon its also extremely good!

Way too much sugar! Cut the sugar in 1/2 (at least) and I cut back on the butter as well. The fresh sweet potatoes tasted way better than the canned also!

Loved it!  Used 1/2 the sugar, dark rum instead of vanilla, and added some ground clove and nutmeg.  Turned out perfect:)

I followed suggestions made by Ron and decreased my sugar to 1/2 cup and added cinnamon, pumpkin spice, and ginger. I also used evaporated milk instead of regular milk. My son said it was better than my mom's version; this is definitely my go-to recipe for now on.

I lost my original recipe that's a family favorite, and this is the closest I could find to it.  Cut the milk to about 2 TBS, add a couple dashes of cinnamon, and cut the sugar to about 3/4 of a cup.  I also usually omit the pecans, but add mini-marshmallows to the top and brown right before serving.  AMAZING, especially with glazed ham or turkey.

If I could rate this recipe higher than a 5, it would be a 10! The first time my husband and I tried it we thought we had died and gone to heaven, the taste was so good. I have it a number of times, with deep fried turkey, as well as baked and everyone loves it.

This is really good, but it might be a little too sweet.  The pecans taste great on top.  I've always had sweet potato casseroles with marshmallows, but this way is much better!

This is delicious. I make it every Thanksgiving and Christmas. I have made it a few times just because it is soooo good. Even non sweet potato eaters tried it and liked it. My daughters boyfriend said he was surprised at how good it was.

I have a traditional sweet potato recipe that my family has used for years (it is posted on here, Sweet Potato Cashew Bake) and it was really hard for me to try something new but I really wanted something quick and easy because I was so busy this holiday season.  This was it.  It came out so good!  I doubled the recipe for a large crowd and it came out PERFECT!  Eventhough I doubled the recipe, I only used 1 cup of sugar and one recipe for the topping.  I baked it in a 13x9 pan for about 50 min.  I had made it the night before, so I let it sit on the counter for about half an hour before baking and I put the topping on right before baking so it wouldn't get soggy.  The topping tasted like candy coated pecans. YUM!

I used fresh sweet potatoes, not canned. Only used 1/4 cup of white sugar as I figured it would be sweet enough. Also only used 3/4 cup of brown sugar and the dish was still very sweet. I was in a rush, and forgot to add the flour, but the topping turned out fine. The dish looked great coming out of the oven.

This has become a delicious addition to our Thanksgiving meal.  I added a hint of cinnamon and orange juice to add a bit more flavor.

I have made this recipe several times, and it is always a hit! Sometimes I substitute 2/3 cup heavy cream for the 1/3 cup milk and 1/3 cup butter. I also add a whiff of nutmeg and cinnamon. This is a fail proof recipe!

Super delicious. The pecans gave it a nice crunch to the mushy consistency. I agree with the others, its best to bake the sweet potatoes in the oven for about 1 1/2 hours to fully let it cook in its own sugars.

Made this for our Thanksgiving this year and modified the receipe based on other reviews. I used 1 C of light brown sugar instead of the white. added about 1/2 Cup of finely chopped pecans to the sweet potatoe mixture with about 1/2 C of miniture marshmellos. I also exchanged evaporated milk for regular milk. The potatoes were creamy and fluffy and the crumble topping was like a dessert by itself. My family and friends loved it and asked for the recipe before they left.

LOVE this..  I like to put marshmallow creme on the top at the very end and place back in the oven till the mallow creme puffs up and slightly browns!  Puts a yummy sweet and crunchy finish on it!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year, having never made it before.  Let me start off by saying this is VERY sweet!  I love sweet things, so that is fine with me, but it was almost like a dessert it was so sweet!  Secondly, it was a bit runny.  I followed the instructions completely and my sweet potatoes were mush by the time I was done cooking them.  After letting it sit for a bit after baked it did thicken a little, and trust me, we all still ate it.  But I would suggest maybe cooking the sweet potatoes only for about 5 minutes, if at all!  Overall a good recipe.

This casserole is incredible. I used 3/4 white sugar and did the full cup of brown sugar and didn't think it was too sweet...we thought it was just right. This is so much easier than you think it's going to be when you read the instructions, too. This is my second time making it, and it's gone so fast!

This is a great recipe! The family loved it. I made a few changes. I doubled the recipe and put in a 9x13 baking stone dish. I did NOT double the white sugar, but only used 1 cup. I did not double the butter either, and it still tasted wonderful! I assembled it the night before, wrapped in foil and popped in fridge. Next day, just popped in oven and baked for 40 minutes. Delish! It can also be assembled and frozen.

I only gave this three stars because I had to alter it some. It is a good base recipe but like others I found it very sweet. I even double the sweet potatoes and left the sugar(which I did half brown half white) at the same amount! I also added spices(cinnamon, ground ginger,and nutmeg)and marshmallows on top . I did not double the topping mixture, thank goodness cause I had more than enough. Cant imagine making this with 1/2 the sweet potatoes, the topping would have been completely overpowering. But I loved it with my alterations and this topping is so good! I am going to put it on apples or peaches next time for a crisp:) p.s I loved it cold:)

Delicious. The recipe was great as is except that next time I will only use half the butter called for in the topping so its more crumbly. As is, it was very thick and, when baked, a large amount of the melted butter laid on top of the casserole.

My family doesn't like Sweet Potatoes. Or at least they think they don't. I made this for Thanksgiving and no one really had it. Those that liked sweet potatoes raved about how good it was. Those that don't like sweet potatoes didn't touch it. The second time I made it, though, I made sure the crunchy top looked more like a "crisp" dessert and told them it was something new I tried called a Pumpkin Crisp - like apple but with pumpkin. They ate every bite and made me promise to make it for Christmas dinner! This recipe was great. The only change I made was I used fresh sweet potatoes. Other than that, great as is! :) Thanks for sharing!

this was my first time making a sweet potato dish and it's a keeper! i also followed other reviews and used 1/2 to 2/3 cup white sugar and brown sugar - it had just the right amount of sweetness with this change. i also cut down on the amount of butter (to 1/4 approximately) and it still came out fine. the pecan/brown sugar topping is amazing!

This year I spent Thanksgiving with my boyfriend's family, but they had never had sweet potatoes. I took these over to their house, and they loved them! I also added marshmellows on top 1/2 of it.

I decided to try this instead of the usual plain old sweet potatos, and it was a big hit!  Great recipe and super easy to make.  Only difference is I cut the sugar just a bit.

MMmmmmm! This was soooo delicious! BEST sweet potatoes I have ever eaten! I would suggest lessening the sugar mixed with the potatoes though and perhaps using brown sugar instead of white.

Like other reviewers, I omitted the step that calls for boiling and cooking the sweet potatoes. I drained the sweet potatoes out of the can, mashed them before adding other ingredients and then baked for a full hour. Worked great!

This was so good even my Sister in law raved.  I didn't used ANY sugar in the casserole, but did use Evaporated milk instead of regular.  Dark brown sugar in the topping - which was so crispy and good.  I've given this recipe out many times.

Perfect every time! I forgot to use milk once, and it came out just as good. Nobody noticed the difference. I have also tried walnuts instead of pecans, and pecans/walnuts mixed...and it all works. It's pretty difficult to go wrong with this recipe!

This was awesome! I also did not boil sweet potatoes first. I added rolled oats and cinnamon to the pecan topping and gosh was it YUMMY. Ofcourse, my children insisted on marshmallows...so we had those too. I also made this for a work Thanksgiving feast & it went FAST! Everyone loves this!

Another 5 star review! Didn't change a thing except I used baked fresh sweet potatoes. Just threw them in the oven the night before, let them cool overnight, then peeled them when I was ready to make the casserole. I make this often for my mom because it is one of her favorite dishes. Thanks for posting!

I made this today for Thanksgiving dinner and everybody loved it! I changed it a bit though and used about 6 yams and chopped them up and boiled them. They were soft and I didn't mash them and still followed the rest of the recipe. I will be using this one again. Great recipe!

This is definitely the most requested dish for our holiday dinners - one change I highly suggest is to add the melted butter gradually so that you end up with a streusel like topping rather than a gooey one.

This is such a simple recipe!  I've been using the same one for years and my daughter absolutely loves it!  After Thanksgiving my neighbor comes over in hopes of getting leftovers! I do double my crust, just to give it more crunch and sweetness, but its a huge hit at my house!

This was my first time making sweet potato casserole and overall I think this was a very good recipe.  It is sweet but I liked it that way and will not change the amount of sugar next time.  I did think 1c of pecans was too much and will cut it down to 1/2 c in the future.  I also added 3/4 t of cinnamon and a few marshmellows on top which was a great addition.  Will make this again.  Got awesome reviews at Thanksgiving dinner!

I love this recipe!  I have made it for the past 2 Thanksgivings and everyone always raves about how good it is.  This year I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 3 Qt. casserole dish (took 45 minutes instead of 30 but it came out perfect).  I did not precook the sweet potatoes, I just drained and mashed them.... otherwise I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I had fixed sweet potato casserole from a different recipe in the past.  In our cross-country relocation I lost the recipe but could remember the type of ingredients used.  I found this recipe and knew it was very similar.  I fixed it for Thanksgiving and had rad reviews!!  Everyone that tried it loved it!!!  I highly recommend!!!!

I have been making this for a couple years now and it is the best sweet potato casserole. The only thing I change is that I add oats to the topping mixture.

Easy bake! Thanks for the recipe! I've been using it for 3 years now! Sometimes I add more flour + sugar to make it more like a cake texture! :D

My review is mixed.  I was sure this was going to be a hit because with all that butter, sugar, vanilla, and pecans, how could you go wrong?  My mom said it was nothing special and I was literally shocked.  On the other hand, my sister and niece ate half a pan.  They thought it was out of this world.  I did not have any.

I made this dish for Thanksgiving and it was a HUGE hit.  The only changes that I made was using fresh sweet potatoes instead of canned and I cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup.

This thanksgiving, mom was recovering from knee replacement surgery, so our family of 14 made supper pot-luck style. I made this recipe, double, except for the sugar which I cut back to 1-1/2 cups, and I only made a single sized batch of the topping to cover a 9x13 pan. Baked it 40 minutes. My family gobbled it up and want it for Christmas supper now. Also, looks like pot-luck T-Day supper is the new tradition! Mom loved being served for a change! ;^)

Great! I did add a little nutmeg and cinnamon as well as cut the white sugar down just a tad.  But everyone raved that it was the best Sweet Potato Casserole they have ever had!  Will definitely be making again and again!

PERFECT! I love the fact I can open a can and make this delicious casserole!  I followed the recipe exactly and it tasted phenomenal!   Super easy to boil, drain, throw it all in the KA mixer and then spread in a pan. Thumbs up!!!

Yummy, Yummy, Yummy. This is by far my favorite sweet potato casserole recipe, and the two years I've made it for Thanksgiving, I've had a lot of favorable compliments! Last year I steamed about two large sweet potatoes instead of using canned, and it turned out great.

It was great, and quick. I was up @ 4:45 am, and got started. I made 2 casseroles. 1 with nuts, and one without. I made green bean casserole, and injected the Turkey before my girlfriend got out of bed. I was off by 8:00am to do Meals on wheels. When I got home my girlfriend thought I had been up all night cooking, and the sweet potato casserole was a hit

This recipie is outstanding!! It was the surprise hit of our Thanksgiving meal. I cut back on the white sugar, increased the vanilla and added a healthy dose of my favorite holiday spice blend (which contains cinnamon, star anise, cloves, allspice,nutmeg and ginger) and the results were amazing!! My daughter who normally hates sweet potatoes has already begged me to make this again for Christmas. Thankyou for this new holiday masterpiece.. it is so easy and absolutely divine with added spice!!

So we have this bourbon potato casserole dish that we usually make every year.  For whatever reason (silly wild hair!), I decided to try something different and to my surprise, EVERYBODY Loved this dish!  Yeah, its so good, the compliments were never ending.  Then the next day I had a little bowl left over and I as I was getting ready to warm it up, I tried a bite cold and it was amazing too!  I can't wait for Christmas.  It is sweet but it is such a compliment to your dinner table.  Many thanks for sharing this recipe!

Excellent recipe! Following other review suggestions, I only used 1/2 cup white sugar and the recipe was still plenty sweet. Great Thanksgiving dish!

No need to use canned sweet potatoes.... fresh ones taste better, easy to fix (just bake, peel and mash) and are better for you...I use my grandma's recipe - you can really overdo the topping with extra ingredients...like coconut or corn flakes... just adds extra calories!

I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup.  It went from being "scary sweet" like my mother-in-law makes to being just sweet enough.

Not at all what I was hoping for. If you are looking for something kind of custardy, you may like this. But, as for a traditional casserole, TOOOO sweet, and runny--I couldn't even get it to drain. I wouldn't recommend this at all!

I prepared this as directed, choosing this recipe because it specifically called for canned sweet potatoes.  It was well-received and I will consider making it again.  It was a bit too rich for my tastes--just a glance at the ingredient list tells you it will be rich, but I was still unprepared for just how rich it really was.  This is not a slam on the recipe, just a personal opinion.  I did give out the recipe twice to various family members, who have plans to include it in their holiday meal rotations.  Thanks!

I made this recipe for my family for several years and it is the hit of the evening.....every time.  I truly enjoyed this recipe and will use it from now on.  I use 3 fresh mashed sweet potatoes instead of the canned.

This recipe has been in my family for @20 years (walnuts instead of pecans). I have loved it forever and we never had a real name for it. I lost the recipe and am so thankful for Allrecipes and its ingredient search!

Oh man this was great!  I was a bit concerned about using canned yams, but it wasn't even an issue once we tasted it.  I mixed it in my KitchenAid mixer and it was a little runny, but it baked very well.  I baked it the first time, so I could use the oven for the turkey and then reheated it in the oven just before serving.  This made the topping extra crispy and good.

This was very good, I didnt use the entire amt of sugar, since yams are naturally sweet.

The topping was not like I thought it was going to be. It was to wet to sprinkle on top of the sweet potato mixture. The next time I make it I will cut down on the butter that I put in the topping. Other than that it was good

Made this for Christmas and it turned out wonderfully! Light and sweet without being overly so and the topping was so yummy. Other than a couple of folks that  love marshmallow topping and don't like pecans too much, everyone thought these were the best sweet potatoes they've ever had.

This recipe is very tasty!  I used very finely chopped pecans which made the topping even more delicious!!  Next time I will use a little less sugar.

Hands down my favorite dish this Christmas.  As I finished adding all the called for ingredients to the yams I got super scared because it was really "soupy/runny" and I thought I messed up on the measurements and ALMOST added cornstarch to thicken it and was really worried it was ruined. Glad I didn't add anything because after baking, it thickened up perfectly!  I made the recipe exactly as stated except minor changes.  I used my hand mixer to get it smooth, and I made a layer of 1/2 the sw. potato mixture then topped with marshmallows then another layer with the rest of the sw. potatoes and topped it off with the pecan crumble mixture.  I broiled it the last couple minutes to make sure the topping was nice and crisp.  It was FABULOUS!  The topping tasted like those yummy candied pecans in the paper cones you get from the fair :) I'm on day 2 of the leftovers and they are still amazingly delicious! (even tho the topping isn't crunchy anymore) YAY!!! for this recipe!! It's a keeper!

I tried this on Thanksgiving and we loved it.  My hubby isn't a big fan of sweet potatoes but ate this all up.  I'm still getting compliments 2 days after Thanksgiving!  I did use two cans of the smaller size canned yams instead.   Thanks for sharing.

Absolutely delicious!  I was nervous when I was making it that it would be too sweet, but it was just fabulous!   I used 8 small fresh sweet potatoes and baked them in the oven for about an hour and 15 minutes and then scooped out the inside.  I also doubled the topping.   I will definitely be making this again- and not just on Thanksgiving!! Thanks for sharing :)

I've made this twice and cutting the sugar down to 1/2 cup was the best version.  It is way too sweet otherwise. Everyone on Thanksgiving LOVED this dish.  It was rather easy to make too.  I would recommend would be using a straining spoon to drain the sweet potatoes.   I'll have to experiment on cutting down the butter to 1/4 cup, but it's hard to mess with perfection.

I have been making this for years at Thanksgiving and Christmas.  It's a family favorite.  The only thing that I do different is I don't melt the butter all the way in the topping.  So the topping is nice and crumbly when put on.  When it bakes it is nice and crunchy.

I have used this recipe since 08 now. I love it so much and my family just raves over it. When I was still in college I went to my roommates house for Thanksgiving and the people that hated sweet potatoes ended up eating the most. Now this year my roommates sister-in-law asked for the recipe because everyone told her how good it was! Thank you for my new tradition!

I just made this from my left-over sweet potato in the fridge, it tastes so good and crunchy but i also think it's a little bit too sweet. Probably I'll reduce the amount of sugar next time. the sweet potato itself is already sweet!

I found this recipe on this site a few yrs ago and made it for my family: everyone loved it! I do tweak it a bit but it is a great basic recipe. I went through a divorce and didn't think about this recipe for a long time. Now I am so glad I found it again. Made it for my father and family and it was a super success...

This was amazing! I did cut the sugar in half, in both situations and the butter and pecans as well. And I increased the cooking time to 50 min because I doubled the recipe. But wow, my whole family  ( 11) loved it! No small feat there! It went great with our Easter Ham! Thank you!

I make this every Thanksgiving for our church dinner for 300 people.  They all love it.  I love how easy it is to make.  I adjust the recipe and make 6 batches, each for 50 servings.  It always turns out great!!

I just moved back to CA from NC and wanted to share a little bit of the south with my non-southern family. :) It was a huge hit at Thanksgiving and it was insisted that I bring it for Christmas! I did cut the sugar in half and it was still really sweet.

Love this recipe.  I've taken it to work functions and other get togethers and frequently been asked for the recipe-- I just send them the link to this recipe.  Very simple to create, too.  Great dish!

wonderful.  I used 3 medium sweet potatoes that I baked in the oven, much better than the canned ones.  And the kids must have the marshmellows on top, but that is very good too.  we have this every thanksgiving and Christmas and other times during the year as well.  A family favorite and am always asked to bring it to gatherings....

Delicious... just like my Southern grandmother used to make.  Instead of using the canned sweet potatoes, I used some leftover baked sweet potatoes.  It gave me a really great, custard-like potato base.  I think I preferred that to the option of using the canned sweet potatoes.  The topping is what makes this a treat... it's a side dish and a dessert.  I keep vanilla sugar and used it for this recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly... This seems to be a popular dish, but it was way too sweet... everyone at Christmas dinner agreed! I would cut both the white sugar and the brown sugar in half. The constistancy of the dish was also too runny...

Absolutely delicious, though it is more like a dessert than a side dish. I used fresh cooked sweet potatoes instead of canned, but otherwise followed the recipe to a T.  It was a hit this Thanksgiving.

I made this for Thanksgiving and substituted the milk and butter with pareve margerine and Silk soy milk to accommodate for my dairy allergy. It took a little longer than 35 minutes to set up, but it tasted great and everyone enjoyed it!

EVERYONE loved this one! I made a few changes to suite my families needs: instead of 1 cup sugar, I used 1/2 c splenda, I replaced the mile with evaporated milk, for the topping I used walnuts instead of pecans, and I used 1/2 c brown sugar splenda blend. One other change was that I didn't cook the sweet potatoes first as when mine came out of the can they were really mushy enough to use right away. Oh, I also added 3/4 t nutmeg & 3/4 t allspice as suggested by another poster. All in all, this dish was gobbled up by everyone! I will use this again!

I made this for the 1st time ever today for Thanksgiving.  It was a huge hit!  The topping is delicious!!  I only used half the sugar in the sweet potato casserole and it was sweet enough.  I think it would have been too sweet if I had added the full amount.  It was awesome!  This will become a tradition for sure.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Great recipe. Made for a pre-school holiday party, so omitted the pecans from the topping and adjusted the flour/sugar mixture to compensate. Added pumpkin pie spice to the sweet potato mixture and halved the sugar as recommended. Loved it!

This was awesome!  I had two thanksgiving dinners to attend and I made a batch for each one.  The first I followed the recipe exactly and it was great but a little too sweet so the next batch I cut 1/2 cup of sugar out of the potatoes and 1/4 cup out of the topping and it was perfect.  I will definately be making this again!

I halved the sugar in both the sweet potatoes and the topping -- and it was still WAY too sweet for me. We even added some lemon juice and salt to cut the sweetness. But some people at the Thanksgiving Dinner I brought it to just loved it, others were silent.  I'm guessing the variable is how sweet your canned sweet potatoes are -- and how much of a sweet tooth you have.  The recipe makes a really pretty presentation, but I don't think I'll make it again.

I like to add a little cinnamon and nutmeg to this recipe. It's a wonderful dish.

Yum, this is a keeper! Much better than sweet potatos with marshmellows, the pecans are a wonderful touch. I did cut the white sugar in half and it wasn't missed.

This was sooo crunchy and yummy.  I processed the pecans in a food processor first because we don't like big pieces of nuts.  I baked it as described so that the top would be crunchy.  Then, because we HAVE to have marshmallows, I sprinkled little marshmallows all over the top and popped it back in the oven until they toasted.   SO good.

EXCELLENT recipe!  Made it for a daycare Thanksgiving lunch, and it was so delicious, I am bringing it to Thanksgiving Dinner tomorrow.  I made it exactly like the recipe....perfect!  If you want to cut back on sugar, though, you could definitely reduce the 1 cup a little (though I am keeping it the same.)

Very easy and will get compliments!

I love this recipe I am a big fan of sweet potatoes and this is just makes them better. I make it on holidays and I can never keep it long. I even had people who hate sweet potatoes eat it and say how good it was. I'm sure to make this for years to come.

I made this for a work function, and it was a big hit.  Personally I thought it was a tad grainy, but overall pretty good.

This was very easy to make and tastes like a sweet potato pie with a pecan pie topping.  My family of finicky eaters gave it rave reviews.

I made this for xmas (my first time as a host) and everyone LOVED IT!! It's extremely sweet and you can actually eat so much that you will get a sugar tummy ache, but it's so amazing as a small side dish (and i mean small, there's a LOT of sugar in this sucker!!)

Okay, there were so many 5 star sweet potato casserole recipes here, I didn't know which one to choose.  I got lucky and picked an awesome one, though!  I fixed this for Thanksgiving dinner (a day early)and already have a request for the recipe.  Definitely one of the yummiest dishes on the table.  I made as directed, except cut back on the white sugar a little bit...the topping is so delicious I'm lucky any made it onto the potatoes!  I didn't find it to be greasy at all, as someone else had said.  I can't wait for leftovers!  Delicious!!!

This recipe is SO GOOD!  I never really liked sweet potatoes until my mother started using this recipe. Now someone makes this dish for every holiday meal.  The only thing we change is sometimes adding in a small can of crushed pineapple (drained) for a little extra flavor.

I made it using 3 fresh yams.  Too sweet for my taste, but it was a hit at Thanksgiving.
Update:  I bumped it up to five stars because it was a special request for this year.  Apparently it was a hit!

This was way too sweet and not near as good as the Praline Sweet Potatoes on this site.  Try that recipe - you'll be happy you did!

This was very good although a bit too sweet. The presentation was nice as I added the topping throughout the casserole. For those who don't like things too sweet, halve the sugar.

This is one of the best recipes for sweet potatoes I have ever had. Got rave reviews at family Easter dinner. The only things I did differently were to use Splenda Blend in place of the white and brown sugars.

Made this last year for 170 people. Two huge professional grade pans of sweet potatoes. Made one and cut the sugar in half with marshmellows.  Made one as directed.  The one with the most sugar got he best votes.  It was good either way.  I don't like sweet potatoes and I liked the really sweet one because it was almost like a dessert.  Gave five stars because I got such raved reviews.

Thank you so much for this recipe!!  It is quickly becoming a family favorite, and a request for every holiday.  We took it one step further, and added one half a stick of butter, and one bag of mini marshmallows.  Melt marshmallows with the butter and spread over the top of the casserole before baking.  Sure it makes it nearly a desert - - but what's wrong with that???

My family couldn't get enough of this dish.  They absolutely loved it.  I changed a few and added a few like most do but even if I hadn't this is a sure hit.  You can put it together before hand and bake when ready or you can freeze it for next month.

The topping is fantastic and just makes this casserole.  I lessened the sugar IN the sweet potatoes but followed the rest as written.  This is very good.

Oh, my word! This is the best sweet potato casserole I've ever eaten... and have ever made. I baked my yams in the oven on low, overnight- and followed the recipe in the morning. The only things that I changed were that I didn't add nuts, I halved the sugar and added some miniature marshmallows on top. It was absolutely amazing!!!!

Perfection in a pan. Just a little too soggy. Next time I will use UNDRAINED potatoes. Even soggy they were the best sweet potatoes I've made!

This was such a refreshing change to the classic with marshmallows.  My 5yr old had given one of my cans of sweet potatoes to the school food drive the day before so on Thanksgiving Day I was stuck without enough sweet potatoes. I ended up adding a can of pumpkin puree and wow it was great!  I had a little bit of a hard time getting it done all the way but everyone loved it.  I tried it a second time and used pumpkin and then mixed in the sweet potatoes from a can not mashed and it was even better!!!  This is our new addition to Thanksgiving!

I made this twice this year.  Once for a luncheon at work and everyone loved it!  So I made it again for my friends on Thanksgiving.  I did think that it was a bit too sweet and used 3/4 cup white sugar instead of the full cup.  It was delicious!  Definately going to make it again.

I followed some advice and used evaporated milk instead of regular.  I also doubled the topping and cut the brown sugar in half.  It was delicious, but next time I won't double the topping - tasted too sweet.

Made 1st time for Thanksgiving and was fairly good except with all the sugary topping it was like eating pure candy and no yams. I will make again but put HALF the sugar topping on it and it should be fine. I also think by adding a little coconut and mini marshmallows to the topping would make even more delicious.

A little too sweet for my taste, probably due to the fact that the canned sweet potatoes were already sweetened. Next time will add less sugar to compensate.

I try this recipe last year and everyone told me they didn't know that sweet potatoes could taste so good.  I am doing it again.  I can't wait until Thanksgiving when I can do it all over again. Thank you so much for the recipe.

Really good!  I took the advice of others and only used half a cup of white sugar.  It was still really really sweet.  That is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars.  I will definitley make it again, but probably only at Thanksgiving/Christmas.

Made this for Easter.  I don't like sweet potatos, never have, but I tried them this time they were okay.  I did get a lot of compliments on this recipe though, so I gave them five stars.

This recipe was soooo good.  I don't like sweet potatoes but my mom does, so I try a new recipe every holiday hoping I'll find one I like.  I definitely did this time.  I might use less pecans, but other than that it was delicious.

This was absolutely amazing. I made it for thanksgiving (canadian) and it was SO good. Got mad reviews. I didnt change a thing about the recipe, and it turned out beautifully. Actually, I was a bit nervous about cooking it. The truth is I have never in my life made thanksgiving dinner.. and I had also *never* cooked sweetpotatoes.. But this recipe was just so simple and fool proof! And, as I said, it turned out delicious. I will most certainly be making it agin!!

I fixed this for thanksgiving. I doubled the recipe. It was a big hit everone went back for seconds. The only change that I will make next time is leave out about a 1/3 of the butter for the topping when I double the recipe.

This was so delicious and easy to make.  Everyone raved about this, and I even had it for dessert on Thanksgiving.
My inlaws said it was like an apple cobbler--crunchy on top and soft and gooey inside!

Thanks for sharing a great recipe!!  Into the permanent collection!

My husband doesn't like sweet potatoes and enjoyed this. To make it healthier, I'm going to try to reduce some of the ingrediants in the sweet potato mixture, as they didn't seem needed as much once mashed.

This has a good flavor, but our family thought it was too sweet.  We would probably like it better as a dessert with whipped topping, than a side dish.

This has a good flavor, but our family thought it was too sweet.  We would probably like it better as a dessert with whipped topping, than a side dish.

So yummy and super easy to make!! My sister brought this to Thanksgiving and we loved it! I asked her for the recipe and she forgot to bring it to our Christmas celebration on Christmas eve. I went ahead and looked it up on here and it tasted exactly like the same one my sister used! It reminds me alot of Pecan Pie and we absolutely loved it! Thanks so much Nancy, this will definately become one of our favorite holiday side dishes!

Finally found a recipe that tastes like my mom‚Äôs! I got in a hurry and forgot to cook the potatoes first, but I softened the butter before adding and mixing and it still turned out great! Will be saving this one for sure. This is VERY sweet. You‚Äôve been warned.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit! I did reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup and used evaporated milk.  I also cut the topping in half and it was just right. This a keeper for sure.

I've been making this for Thanksgiving for years!  Even my pickiest eaters ask for it every year.  We do a potluck for about 20 people, and I double the recipe.  I don't think I'd be allowed in the door without it!
I drain, but don't cook the potatoes ahead of time. I don't see the need, and they turn out perfect every time. Other than that I follow the recipe.  I won't make my sweet potatoes any other way!

I always follow a reviewer‚Äôs suggestion to cut the white sugar in half and it is PLENTY sweet, but I‚Äôm giving it 5 stars because this remains our favorite recipe for sweet potatoes. It‚Äôs a Thanksgiving staple, though it is good anytime of year.

I make this throughout the year, not just for the holidays... Family and friends love this. I do like sweets, but this recipe is a bit too sweet for me, so I just cut back on the sugar and butter. YUMMY!!!!!!I  I looked at some of the reviews, and I use an electric mixer, never had runny potatoes, they come out fluffy like a souffle. the canned potatoes are excellent I'm sure the fresh potatoes are good to, no problems and delicious with the can.

It was a hit!  I did only use 1/2 cup of white sugar, as suggested by other reviewers.  Next time I might increase the amount of sweet potatoes to change the sweet potato to topping ratio.

Our new favorite sweet potato recipe. Made as directed minus the heating up the potatoes before baking. Thank you for an amazing recipe.

Not only is this a delicious side dish, I can eat it as a stand alone dish.  Smooth and not too sweet.  The topping really adds to it.

Much more delish if you bake fresh sweet potaoes, taste/flavor is the difference between day and night.

People who don't even like sweet potatoes (and there were several) loved this recipe.  One person said it reminded him of his mother's sweet potatoes from 40 years ago.

This is a great recipe, though a little sweet even for me.  I will adjust the sugar next time, though my family loved this.  Glad that I heeded the advice to watch the amount of liquid.  This will return to my Thanksgiving table next year.

I loved this recipe. Instead of using cow's milk I used almond milk. It turned out great. I received many compliments. I also doubled the recipe, eliminated the pecans, and used half the amount of sugar that was suggested. The cook time in my oven was about 1h 20min. I would cook again in the future.

I have made this recipe for the last ten years or so. It doesn't need any alterations, perfect just as it is. Much, much better than the standard candied yams.

I have made this recipe many times for Christmas or Thanksgiving Family Gatherings.  It is always a hit.  I have 2 variations.  I always use fresh sweet potatoes (not canned).  I also reduce the sugar.  I only use 1/3rd cup of white in the potatoes  and 3/4 cup of brown sugar for the topping.  (The topping adds a of sweetness so you really don't need to add much to the potatoes themselves.

This was great and really easy to make.  I like "sweet" sweet potatoes so I used the full amount of sugar in the recipe, but did halve the topping and it was fine.

I've actually made this for several years, now.  Everyone loves it.  The only changes I've made was only using about half the amount of milk to the sweet potato mixture and  using pecans instead of walnuts.  Didn't use a full cup of the pecans.  Probably about 2/3 cup.

Make this every year for almost 10 years now. I use half the surgar and yams that are in syrup but that's just personal preference for sweetness level. It always turns out awesome.

Excellent fun.  It reminded me of a soufflet recipe so I added some baking powder some ground ginger.  Topped it with powdered sugar.  So much for the healthy angle.  It could pass as dessert!

This recipe was excellent and I used only 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup butter in the sweet potato mixture and 1/4 cup butter in the topping. My family loved this - made it for Christmas dinner.

I agree with some who said that it is better with fresh baked sweet potatoes.  However, if you use canned sweet potatoes, I find no need to go through the process of boiling the sweet potatoes; I find the consistency of the dish much better when you drain them completely and mash them by hand.  I also cut down on the quantity of some of the ingredients as several others mentioned; however if you are cooking for a larger crowd you can accomplish the same result by leaving the ingredients the same and adding extra sweet potatoes.  Overall I love this recipe and have gotten great reviews.

I only bought one can of Yams - 29 ounces. I adjusted the recipe down to 6 servings to accommodate the one can I bought. Oh my goodness was this absolutely delicious!!! I thought for sure when I put it in the oven that it was going to be a bust. To my & my son's Christmas delight, this came out PERFECT! This will be my goto recipe every Christmas!!! All I can say is yum, yum & yummy!!! Thanks for this recipe!

Way, way, way too sweet as written. I didn't change the topping, but put in 1/4 of the recommended sugar, and left out the butter in the casserole.  Turned out wonderfully, it was a big hit.

I‚Äôve made this several times and my family loves it. Do remember drain some of the liquid from the canned potatoes or it will be too soupy. You want a pur√©e texture so the topping will stay on top.

Made this sweet potato casserole for Thanksgiving dinner. It was very well liked and I'm sure to make it again. I cut the white sugar in half and added 3/4 tsp. of cinnamon and 3/4 tsp. of all spice. It was delicious. We received nothing but positive responses from folks who never liked sweet potatoes. It was received more as a dessert rather than a side dish.

Love this recipe. I've made it quite a few times. It is quite sweet and winds up more for dessert that's even better with ice cream.  Sometimes I do cut down on the sugar so it will be less dessert-like.  I'd love to know hot to make this night before for say - a church function - and then how to reheat the entire thing. I don't want to overcook it. Also it'd be nice to know whether or not its okay for the topping to not be crisp or how it should be because the potatoes get done but what sticks to the knife coming out is the topping.  I've overcooked mine before trying to make sure it was indeed done. Any suggestions on the reheating email me at adtset@gmail.com.  Thanks!

Great recipe, I've been asked every time how to make this dish. It is simple and tasty.  I agree you can cut back on the sugar.  I also skip the pecans most of the time.

This one has become a Thanksgiving tradition in our home (we've used this specific recipe for the past three years).  Since the sweet potatoes are already tender coming out of the can, we skip the first step (no need to pre-cook them).  I also cut back the sugar by about a third.  Otherwise it is perfect and we'll be making it for years to come.  Thanks for posting it to the site!

These are the best sweet potatoes ever!  We have made this since last Thanksgiving after trying several other recipes.  It has become a holiday tradition.  Even my husband who doesn't like sweet potatoes enjoys this recipe.  Thank you for sharing it.

I added marshmallows on top, but that made this recipe a little too sweet for my taste. So, if you want to add marshmallows cut back on the sugar a little bit.

This recipe was amazing! I made it for Thanksgiving and received rave reviews for it. I talked my husband who usually passes on the sweet potatoes into trying it and he asked for seconds and then asked if I would make it again! I did follow a couple of suggestions and cut the sugar down. I was glad I did because it was still really sweet. I also added some mini marshmallows to the top.

I made this for my Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit! I did have to substitute the milk though. I forgot to pick it up milk the day before, but I did have my daughters Very Vanilla Soy Milk. I was so worried using it would make it taste different because I excluded the vanilla due to the soy milk already being flavored, but it was awesome all the same.This will be on my at least once a month list!

This is a very good recipe. I will make it again. One of my guests, who has never eaten sweet potatoes or yams since childhood, tried and LOVED the dish.

The best.  I made this recipe as written except I ommitted the pecans.  My son, who usually does not eat the sweet potatoes, ate this up!  The amount of brown sugar was just a bit much in the topping, otherwise, perfection!

This is the best sweet potato recipe I've ever found. Everyone at our Thanksgiving dinner asked for the recipe! Substituted the milk for condensed and used fresh sweet potato instead of canned (the store was out of canned...) AWESOME!

I don't even like sweet potatos, but this is yummy.  My husband and children always race to see who can finish the casserole off first!  I will use this recipie over and over again.

This is definitely a dessert and not a side dish. Very sweet and sugary. Sweet potatoes are pretty good without all the sugar too.

I used this recipe instead of my regular recipe since I misplaced it.  My only problem was that the potato mixture wasn't thick enough and my topping sunk.  I've never had that happen before and I make this every year.  Maybe I stirred too much.  Either way, the flavor was awesome as always.

last year my sister made this for thanksgiving, and it was the first time i enjoyed sweet potatoes any way but baked. this year i specifically requested it!!! it's the only leftover i took besides turkey. it's soooo good-the crunchy topping really makes it fantastic, and yes, more like dessert!!! i'm going to add it to my recipe box as soon as i'm finished here.

I was trying so hard to find the recipe to this just the way my aunt made it.  When I looked at the ingredients I said to myself "This sounds like it could be it".  Sure enough it was.  It was great!!

The texture turned out too runny.  Flavor was very good, but no where near as thick as mashed potatoes.
