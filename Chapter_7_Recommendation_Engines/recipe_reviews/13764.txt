The eggs and milk part needs to be whisked before even turning on the heat because the mixture needs to be stirred CONSTANTLY (NOT "Frequently"!!!) It will burn if you stop stirring it even for a moment. It seems to be good other than that.

This was good.  The recipe worked out and it did make a pudding and was not hard to make at all.  On the down side, when using it as a pie filling with a graham cracker crust, it seeps more liquid than I would like a pie to.  It sets up fine but then liquid seeps from it.  I made it with cocoa powder for a chocolate pudding pie and I topped it with whipped cream.  I made it for my son because he hates Key Lime and I made Key Lime for my husband, and my son did not care for it at all.  He might just be more used to the instant puddings.  It is really important with this pudding to really get all the white away from the yolks, my yolks were not too eager to fully separate, despite my use of an egg separator, so I had little bits of curdled egg white in it, not a lot but it freaked my son out.   I did not have a problem with burning.  I use quality thick bottom pots and have an electric stove and heated it on medium heat and stirring with a wire whisk.

My childhood pleasure was visiting grandma and she would whip up a batch of chocolate pudding just for me. So creamy.This is the closes I can find "Loved it". I add 1-1/2 sugar and 3tbs coco, 1tsp of cinnamon & substituted half of the milk for half & half cream "yummy"

I used this recipe as a chocolate pudding to eat on its own, with cocoa added. Of course, the first ingredients MUST be whisked before heating. I used 1 cup sugar and 1/4 Splenda to sweeten it (just over a half-sweet ratio), and it was VERY sweet. I would stick to just under 1 cup sugar next time.

A good tasting pudding with a mousse like texture. I was not thrilled with the liquid coming out of it the next day, still tasted very good though. I used the cocoa and whisked all the dry stuff together before adding the milk and heat.

Not bad. Here's a few things that work best for me, though, when it comes to pudding:

Stir CONSTANTLY until it thickens. Stopping at any point will scorch the milk.  

When it comes to adding eggs to anything really hot, it's probably best to temper them before adding them. That means to add a little at a time of the hot mixture to the egg mixture, about  1/2 cup in total, mixing between each addition. THEN add it to your main pot/bowl/whatever. I'd rather not risk making scrambled eggs in my pudding. 

Before adding it to a graham cracker  crust, I always cool it before hand. This way, it has a chance to thicken further, and is less likely to make the crust soggy. 

This is what works for me. If any other method works for you, then do that. Hope I was helpful, at least.

I used almond milk due to a milk allergy. I used a 1/4 cup of Hershey’s reg choc and 1/4 of dark chocolate powder (having adapted from a Hershey recipe). I used the two cups of sugar because the almond milk was unsweetened and the chocolate. Otherwise if I was making vanilla, I’d cut back significantly on the sugar - but ultimately that’s up to personal taste. Because I was making a pie, I added 2 additional tablespoons of starch due to experience.  I like a firm pie and it’s hard to get the firmness from totally homemade pudding, IMHO. I always seem to have some weeping with the pudding in a pie so I’m not deterred if it happens this time.

Pudding would not get thick enough or set up. Put into a pie and it was liquid.  Had to throw the pie away. Followed recipe exactly. Flavor was good, but probably needs more corn starch for this much milk.  Also, this made twice as much needed for a pie.

I agree with most of the other reviewers. It's a very good recipe but it's way to sweet. I will make it again and use less sugar as recommended.

I made this twice. Used less sugar the second time and did prefer it (about 1/4 c less), but it turned out great. Gotta watch out, or the milk will curdle!

I just finished making this the only thing I changed was instead of 3 cups of milk I used 2 3/4 cups. Other than that it was great !

Great pudding!  Maybe a little too sweet!  I'll add a little less sugar next time.
