I shook these in a gallon zip-loc bag with olive oil and kosher salt.  I spread them evenly on baking sheets and flipped often.  Occasionally the excess water from the squash would pool in the pans so I drained them once or twice during baking and I really think this helped cut down on the mushiness. They are softer than french fries, but mine were not really mushy.  Delicious!!  My kids liked these as well as the adults at my dinner tonight.  I will make these again for sure.

Really yummy! Like other reviewers, I coated the slices in olive oil, sprinkled with salt, pepper, cinnamon, a tiny bit of nutmeg. I also put the cookie sheet into the oven while it was pre-heating to warm up the pan, this helps the fries to be crispy, instead of soggy.

I tossed mine in olive oil first and needed to bake them more like 45 minutes. Also, I just cut mine into round pieces. It is way easier to cut. I just slice all the way down the squash...time saver. I will make this again for sure.

I treated like we do zuchini or eggplant.  salt them and put them on a papertowel and let the salt pull water from them...then oil, season and bake.  HUGE difference and more like fries.

Actually I would rate 3 1/2 - it had GREAT flavor however I sliced thin like it some recommended for the same amount of time. It was browning nicely but was mushy 30+ min was up.  To start I tossed in olive oil and flavored it like others recom. w/ cin, nutmeg and I added garlic salt...anyway since I didn't have "fries" I tossed it all in a dish and family ate it anyway - they loved the flavor.  So I would have given it a 4 or 5 had it not been so mushy! :(

These are a great idea for kids and grown ups alike. I've been doing "faux fries" for awhile and have found that the best way to get that crispiness you are looking for is to first toss them in a small amount of evoo, cook them a little shorter time than called for, then broil them for the last 3-5 minutes. You'll have to experiment with the thickness you cut, the time you cook and your own oven temps, but a few times and you should find the right mix so that they come out soft on the inside and crispy out. I move alot, so I have to play with the mix with each new oven. Don't put too much oil on, it won't help! Also, don't crowd the pan or everything ends up getting steamed instead of "faux fried". Hope this helps!

Toss the squash in a little olive oil first, they will be a lot tastier and not stick to the pan.

I used butter spray first then seasoned with Mrs. Dash as I cook salt free.
Yum. Even the kids liked them.

This was really good I've made it twice now for myself and will probably make it again. I tosed them in ovile oil and seasond them with pumpkim pie spice and salt they were yummy a little sweet and salty. When I slice up the squash I try to keep my fries thin I think it makes them better.

I really enjoyed these.  My husband thought they were okay and my 5 year old didn't like them.  I like a previous reviewer added cinammon, nutmeg and ginger and tossed them with a little olive oil and salt and pepper.  I will definitely make these again.

5 stars with the addition of salt, olive oil, garlic powder, cayenne, cinnamon, and cloves.  Spicy/salty/sweet/savory and they do get crunchy, but you have to be patient.

these are yummy!  i have gotten our family hooked on these (even an extremely picky 5 yr old who wont touch veggies!!).  To make them less soggy: cut the squash, salt it, then let it sit for like 5 mins, then pat dry with a paper towel.  Salt/season again then cook on broiler pan.  They must be cooked at least 40 mins!

I tossed these with a bit of olive oil and salt. Do microwave first for 3-5 minutes to make it easier to peel the squash.

First, read all reviews!  I coated my slices in a mixture of olive oil, garlic salt and parsley to taste.  Cooked at recommended temp for 15 minutes on the second to highest rack (pan was coated with foil).  The fries were cooked, but not crispy.  I turned my broiler on low for another 15 minutes, thus avoiding the need to turn them over as the tin foil crisped the underside.  HUGE winner with me and my 4 year old twins ate them up without question or ketchup!

Excellent flavor; found that for a more crispy squash fry... you want to bake longer, around 40-45 minutes. Make sure not to drench the fries in olive oil since squash is very absorbent; they will turn out soggy. Make sure to SALT and pepper them, the nutmeg and cinnamon turned up the flavor a bit, too. So easy and so good!

The flavor was great, however the end result was very unlike a fry.  No crispness or crunch.  I tossed in olive oil and salt, then baked for 35 minutes total.  Still not crispy like I wanted them to be.  Would be a great component in another dish but not a stand-alone side for me.

I didn't use olive oil, I used a fat free olive oil spray just so they wouldn't stick to pan but I think these are great all by themselves so the extra flavor from the olive oil masks the natural flavor. I think it tends to be a little on the mushy side and not be as crunchy when tossed in olive oil.  But that's just me! These are amazing even without salt!!

They were really good.  I used a suggestion from a few other users and coated them with olive oil by shaking them in a large ziploc bag.  Then I put the on a cookie sheet and sprinkled them with salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger.  Very good.  I made them with another recipe on this website, "Juicy Pork Chops."  The chops called for broiling.  The two recipes were great together.  I baked the fries first, then changed the setting to broil and did the chops.  It got me to thinking that the next time I make these squash fries, I may just broil them.  They may crisp on the outside better that way.  And it'll save a little time if I make them with the pork chops again.  I can broil them together.

These tasted delicious! I also tossed them in a little olive oil and used a little salt on half of them and some Lawry's french fry seasoning on the other half (fry seasoning is strong, so don't go too crazy). The only downside I found was they they are definitely not your typical fry and are a tad mushy in texture. I think I cut mine a bit too thin because when I went to flip them they kind of just squished together. Next time I'll try thicker cuts and slightly longer in the oven. Definitely worth the time...yummy and healthy side to your dinner.

These are really good.  They came out pretty crisp, not crispy just crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, not mushy at all!  Make sure they are not too thin or too thick, they do shrink a bit.  Cut them kind of like steak fries then you'll get mcdonald sized fries when they're done.  Coat them very lightly in olive oil then season them.  I baked them 20 minutes on one side then flipped them, after about 10 minutes on the other side I checked them and took out the smaller ones (they were starting to brown) then left the others in for about 5 more min.  Perfect!  My 19 month old is actually eating squash!  Another important step is DO NOT over crowd the pan, leave space between the fries.

Very tasty.  I made one half of the squash following the directions almsot exactly.  I sprayed with cooking spray was the only alteration.  The other half I coated in melted Brummel and Brown butter (yogart butter) and added a little cinnaman and netmeg.  Both were great.  I was able to use a veggie peeler to peel the squash which was a lot easier than using a knife, especially for someone who tends to cut themselves a lot :).  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

I liked this recipe... they tasted great... BUT i cut mine too thin and they got sorta shriveled. I'd try it again but I'd be sure to cut them much thicker. They really lose a lot of mass when they cook.

These sound yummy!  After reading several reviews of them being mushy.  I'm going to try baking them on the broil pan, that way they wont be sitting in the water.

I sliced them about the size of standard French fries, lightly coated with olive oil, some cinnamon and pepper. Baked 30 minutes, turning once. Salted when done cooking. The only thing holding me back from eating all of it myself is the amount.  VERY filling, delicious and satisfying.

These came out really yummy with a little cinnamon and nutmeg (I'll try a little ginger instead next time to change it up) and they're a great way to get your baby started on healthy finger foods!!

I made this recipe and it was a hit. The only thing I did different was at the end of baking, I broiled them to add an extra crisp. Thank you for sharing.

Loved these fries..  added a little seasoning and they were great. Need to cook them longer though.. 20 minutes wasn't long enough.

Loved this recipe.  I did sprinkle with olive oil, salt, pepper, nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger and curry powder.  My kids and my husband loved them!  They didn't get crispy but still were delicious.

These are very good.  Make sure you slice them very thin to get a nice crunch.  Very good with burgers or just as a side dish.

I really liked these.  I peeled the squash easily with a potato peeler and then sliced it into sticks.  I placed them on a baking stone, sprayed them with Pam, and salted them.  I cooked them 20 minutes and then turned them over and cooked another 10.  Not crispy (but I wasn't expecting crispy since they aren't fried), but delicious!

These were very tasty, but they never got crispy like french fries.  After an hour, we ate them as they were, and they were still yummy, but I was expecting a more french fry texture.  It was also a LOT OF WORK to peel and cut the squash this way.

Tried the recipe just as it is offered and it was very good.   My first thoughts were to alter it exactly like the others did with olive oil but I resisted.  JUST USE THE RECIPE LIKE ITS OFFERED....the oil makes them mushy and extracts the moisture.

Good stuff. Husband liked it too, and he is a picky vegetable eater. They came out on the soft side but definitely not mushy. I was short on time so after tossing in the ziplok with olive oil and salt, I microwaved them for 5 minutes first (the effect of blanching) while my oven was preheating, then drained the liquid and tossed them in a paper towel to remove excess moisture. Then spread on a spray-oiled sheet and backed at recommended temp for about 25 min.

These are excellent. I do however agree with a previous reviewer.. must toss these in some good olive oil first.  on my second attempt at making them i fried them briefly with some olive oil and then put them into our counter-top oven for 20 minutes at 450 on bake, followed by another 10 minutes on broil just to crisp the outsides more.  turned out amazing!

I read a lot about how some people's fries turned out mushy. I got mine to be perfectly crispy using the following:
I cut the squash into strips a night before. I placed them on a few paper towels and salted them to suck out the moisture.
I put the baking sheet in the oven while it was preheating. Using a hot pan can help the fries crisp.
I sprayed the strips with cooking spray, not olive oil. 
I baked for 5-10 min at 425 and then broiled at 500 for ~20 minutes, occasionally flipping.
Hope this can help someone else!

Delicious!  Try to slice them uniformly, and a little thicker, or else they will burn.

Excellent. At 20 minutes, these were cooked but very soft; at 45 minutes they were as crisp as oven-baked sweet potato fries. We added some pumpkin pie spice and kosher salt, and olive-oiled them as reported by others.

This recipe did not work at all.  The fries were soggy.  I tried them on the pan (on foil sprayed with olive oil spray) and they were almost raw at 20 minutes and cooked through at 30 but soggy. I tried them on a rack on a sheet pan and they were soggy. I'm trying to fry the last batch on the stovetop now, but that sort of defeats the purpose of baking them.  Still...butternut squash in just about any form is pretty tasty...they did not go to waste!

If you want them crunchier, cut them thinner.

I added cinnamon, nutmeg, and brown sugar as other comments suggested, but I found them to be too sweet.  I even made a batch without the brown sugar, but they were still too sweet.  I probably wont make these again.

Love them!!  If you like sweet potato fries, these are a great substitute.  I cut them thinner with a crinkle cutter and spray with cooking oil.  We use garlic salt after they are done cooking.  They are not crispy but I find if you cut them thinner they aren't as mushy.  FYI - if you are on Weight Watchers, these are no points if you use the cooking spray!!!

These taste better to me than sweet potato fries.  I bought a 1/2 squash already peeled and seeded, which makes this much quicker.  Once cut up, I spread them on a baking sheet and added garlic powder, cumin and crushed red pepper. I baked at 425 for 40 minutes, flipping once.  I overcooked them or possibly cut too thin.  These are going to be my new go to when I want french fries!

Great flavor!  I didn't give 5 stars b/c it takes forever to prepare the squash and then all the flipping while baking- high maintenance cooking.  They seem to take longer than the stated 20 minutes and some pieces start to burn before other are even close to being done.  I did 2 batches- one with salt, cinnamon, a little nutmeg and pumpkin pie spice- the other batch I used cajun seasoning.  Both were wonderful!  I put them in a ziploc with a little olive and the seasoning.  I wouldn't expect crispy fries but they are delicious!

Maybe I cut them too thick, but they were still pretty mushy. I couldn't remember if I was supposed to flip them halfway thru cooking-but it made a mess when I did. Stuck to the pan too.

This is a nice alternative to the usual soup I make. The fries were not soggy, but not crispy like regular fries. I think maybe next time I won't toss in oil and see how it works. This is a nice kid-friendly recipe that tastes great and is super easy to make.

This did not turn out well.  After reading all the reviews I thought they would take a long time to cook but after 15 minutes I smelled them burning and they were! I heated the pan first as some suggested but they were still soggie (the ones that weren't burnt). Won't try these again

The timing seemed to be way off. I cooked these for 55 minutes, and they still never got crispy, more like chewy.

this is SO good!  I used my food processor and sliced the butternut squash thin like chips.  It was so delicious it didn't even need oil or salt.  I am definitely making this again!

These were TERRIFIC as written...I tried adding spices other reviewers added, and they were also tasty that way...but they are truly good without olive oil, and with salt only...I used a potato peeler to remove the outer skin before slicing into fries...worked great!  Thanks for this healthy way to enjoy fries!

Wow on the deliciousness factor!  I followed others' advice to toss in a 1 gallon bag with olive oil & kosher salt, but added allspice instead of ginger/cinnamon/etc. b/c those are allergens for us, and allspice is a great substitute. Mine went about 25 minutes total & turned out VERY mushy, so that removing them from the sheet meant I was practically turning them into mashed squash instead of fries.  I'll have to work on lowering the amount of oil next time to avoid soaking them to this level of mush--but still YUM!!  Just eat 'em with a fork...

Great sweet potato sub! Added cinnamon, a light sprinkle of ginger, and a smidget of cayenne. Took another reviewer's advice and put them in while the oven preheated. Perfect compliment to my kale chips! Also works well with frozen cubes.

these were great!  I only gave it 4 starts because they were on the mushy side; couldn't pick them up and eat them like regular fries.  I will try the suggestion of microwaving them and draining the extra liquid next time.  adults & kids loved them; it was a hit!

I used acorn squash and sliced it thin.  I sprinkled garlic salt on half and bacon salt (!!) on the other half.  Came out crisp and delicious!!  I found that half of a medium acorn squash sliced thinly covers a large baking sheet (single layer). I lined a baking sheet with a silicone mat and sprayed it with baking spray, laid out the squash slices and sprayed them with baking spray.  Then I sprinkled garlic salt over them and flipped them over halfway through baking. YUM!

Delicious. Used a touch of olive oil to keep everything from sticking. They were crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside, similar to a steak fry. Dipped in a butter/brown sugar/vanilla sauce.

My boyfriend and I loved these squash fries.  I coated them lightly with olive oil and used a combination of Mrs. Dash original with a smidgin of Chicago Steak seasoning for flavor.  I cooked them on parchment instead of a cookie sheet in my convection oven and they were divinely delicious without turning them over.  What a great way to use our bumper crop of butternut squash!  More, please!

I took others advice and used pumpkin pie spice and a bit of brown sugar on top.  I did find they were abit better when cooked for a longer period.  If you use EVOO, be sure to use a smal amount (the squash stays very moist).  Thakns for sharing :)

This was a good basic recipe for fries. I salted before fries before hand on a paper towel to expell some of the water so fries would not be soggy. Let them rest about 10 min. Then I used some olive oil in the bottom of my baking dish and broiled them turning a few times for about 15-20 min and they were very good

I made up a pan of these and tried a few different falvors, some with just salt, some with a few herbs sprinkled on, some with onion/garlic salt but like some others have stated they were not like fries at all. They browned on the edges and eventually started to burn but never went crisp. And the thickness wasn't an issue because I used a veggies slicer meant for making thin potato chips. If I were to try it again maybe I'd lower the heat and cook for longer so they have more of a chance to dry out.

I've tried making butternut squash fries several times and this is the closest they've come to being actual fries. First I tossed them with olive oil and a generous amount of cinnamon. I did NOT salt them beforehand because I did not want to draw out any additional moisture. I salted them immediately after taking them out of the oven instead. I sliced them thinly and kept a close eye on them. As soon as they were nicely browned on one side, then flipped them and waited for them to brown on the other side as well. But be careful, there is a pretty short time between "nicely browned" and burned so don't wait too long. But don't flip prematurely either, because they will be soggy. All in all, some were burnt and some were soggy, but most were perfectly delicious.

My husband and I liked these, but our children did not.  I cooked them for 30 min then turned off the oven and left them in there for a while longer, but they were always a little mushy, even when the edges were crispy.  I think that's just the nature of the squash (vs. potato).  But the flavor was very good.  I did toss them with olive oil first so they wouldn't stick to the pan (although they still stuck a little).  thanks for the simple recipe!

These were much better than sweet potato fries.  I could eat this again.  I only gave it a 3 star, because they were soft on the inside.  I will try to make again, and try the idea of salting and then placing on towel to draw out the moisture, and see if that helps.  Good way to get away from regular fries and eat more vegetables! I did add cajun seasoning, which made them taste like cajun steak fries.

I modified the method taking past reviews into account.  Dried the cut squash on a towel with garlic salt and then roasted for 50 minutes. I pulled out the squash at the 1/2 way point to flip.  They easily flipped and were noticeably steaming.    Some cut thinner werer starting to wrinkle and the fatter slices were not.  Did not roast to brown edges though; however, when I had one it was great!    The texture was like that of a fat potatoe fry not super crisp like a cracker.  I really enjoyed the taste which the salt helped to bring out.  I could see these now being arranged into other dishes instead of just fries.  Something like atop a pastry shell with butterscotch ganache or as part of a veggie casserole.

What a clever idea!  I like sweet potatoe fries (I make them the same way at home with yams) and so this was easy for me to make and tasted great!   I modified it slightly by putting paprika on it in addition to salt.

I lightly sprayed the fries with my version of  seasoned olive oil, lightly sprinkled with sea salt & then used my 16" cast iron dutch oven to bake them on a camp out. You will need to remove the lid & turn them mid point, but what a camp fire hit:-)) The Trail Chef

Delicious! I coated the 'fries' in vegetable oil to help the salt, pepper and nutmeg stick and it was FABULOUS! My husband has been begging me to bake some more!

Very yummy. I shook them in a bag with olive oil like other reviewers suggested. I did put too much salt on them. I had a hard time getting them crispy, after they baked for almost an hour I gave up and turned the broiler on for a few minutes. We had them for breakfast. I'll try them again!

I used the suggestions of some of the other reviewers.  I cut into fairly small slices (smaller than in the picture), set out for 5 min., seasoned with salt and pepper, and pressed with paper towel.  I brushed some olive oil on before baking on broiler.  Halfway through the 30 min. time I turned the pieces and brushed olive oil on that side.  Very tasty!

These were full of flavor and easy to make. Like others, mine came out mushy, not crisp. No matter, they were delicious!

flavor was very good. But that was all. Maybe I cut them to thin. They mushed all up. We just ate the mushed up "fries". Don't think I will make these again.

Very good, I do the same with sweet potatoes too and they turn out delicious. I do bake them a little longer to make them crispier.

We enjoyed this side dish, however I will follow other people's advice to heat the cookie sheet before putting the squash fries into the oven.  They were a bit "wet" but very tasty.  I also added a bit of olive oil to the mixture.  I will make this again.

I followed the advice of previous posts (olive oil/salt/cinnamon in a ziploc bag, pooling out access liquid during baking, leaving the sheet in the oven while it preheats), but I still ended up with soggy fries.  Maybe too much olive oil?  The flavors were awesome though!

I coated the fries in olive oil, salt, cinnamon and pepper and they turned out great! Make sure you cut them thick because they shrink up quite a bit. I used only the neck of the squash to make them all the same size and saved the curved part for my butternut soup.

Like others, I coat the squash very lightly with oil before cooking.  My husband, who would have said he didn't like squash, loves these.  They've become a staple.

This was wonderful. I placed the squash in a zip lock bag with cumin, cinnamon, salt, and olive oil. I used pre-cut squash and chopped then very thinly. Even my one year old loved them. Definite keeper recipe..thanks!!

This was truly yummy.  I sprinkled cinnamon, ginger, sea salt and nutmeg in a bowl, swirled in some olive oil and tossed my squash in - gave them a stir and slipped them onto a preheated jellyroll pan.  They stayed in about 35 mins. but never got crunchy.  What do the success stories have that I don't? Hmmm...  Well, I don't have anymore fries - I ate them all up because they were delicious.

I really liked the idea of this recipe, but it didn't turn out.  The fries were mushy even using a pre-heated stone.  I am not sure if it was me or the recipe.

This is an easy way to make an unhealthy favorite (French fries) easier on your waistline while incorporating a fun summer veggie onto your plate. To help them brown up, I sprayed them with butter flavor cooking spray and seasoned them with a low-salt grinding spice.  Baked for an extra five minutes, and they were just fine!  Definitely worth repeating.

Really, really tasty.  I did what everyone did with the oil and cinn/cloves/salt & pepper.
Don't use too much olive oil or they will be soggy and cut the squash thin to help keep them crisp.  One squash wasn't enough!  I ate it all myself!

I salted the raw cut-up squash, let sit, and soaked up excess moisture with paper towels. I shook squash in bag with some EVOO and then I spread out on cookie sheet and sprinkled it with cinnamon, allspice, garlic powder, cumin, and chili powder. I baked it for 45 minutes and it came out perfect and very tasty.

I have made these for years.  I toss the fries in oil in a zip lock bag, and add salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder.  Or, sometimes I'll toss them in oil and cinnamon, nutmeg and a little ginger.  Fantastic!!!

This was one of my favorite winter recipes. Before baking, I put all of my squash sticks into a gallon-sized plastic bag and drizzle olive oil, cinnamon and nutmeg, and shake/mix until all are coated evenly. These taste like dessert!

Took over an hour to make, although preparing the fries was quite easy. I think the process might be made a lot easier for a beginner like me if cooked directly in the oil like french fries.

I found the fries rather mushy and even used less olive oil than required.  I also added cinnamon and nutmeg as recommended which spiced them up a little.

I had some butternut squash and wanted to do something with them that wasn't too sweet.  This was simple and delicious!  My 2 year old and I couldn't get enough of them.  My 4 year old tolerated them with ketchup and my husband said they were okay.  I tossed in olive oil and sprinkled with just a little salt.  I put foil on the baking sheet so clean up was a breeze.  Personally, I like them better than real fries.  Definitely something I will make again.

These turned out more soggy than I thought they would. It was good eating vegetable instead of potato starch though!

Deeelicous!  Cutting up the butternut squash was a major chore (perhaps I needed a sharper knife...), but it was sooo worth it. I sprayed mine with Pam and ate them with ketchup (although they really didn't need it).  Yum!

Butternut Squash Fries are awesome!! But this recipe didn't give it enough time to cook. I always shake the cut up squash in a ziplock bag with a little olive oil and bake the fries at least 45 minutes so they are crispy.

What a great idea!  I cut up one butternut squash and made two cookie sheets of fries.  One cookie sheet was seasoned with pepper & celery salt and the other sheet I sprinkled with sugar, nutmeg, and cinnamon.  I did spray the cookie sheet to avoid sticking and cooked a little longer to ensure fries were crispy.  These are wonderful!  I have already made a couple batches and keep experimenting with flavors :)  Tasty!

I followed this recipse and the squash stuck to my nonstick aluminum foil and came out mushy and then burnt.  It was terrible!  I assume if you fried instead of baked, maybe it would work better.

Again, came out too soggy. But I may have made the slices too thin. Will try again at a different size and bake time. Flavor was delicious though. Shook squash and oil in a ziploc bag. Spread out in a pan and salted with garlic salt. Yum.

My son and I loved these, my husband was not a fan. I made a spice blend (chili powder, garlic powder and salt) tossed the fries in that then baked then on a cookie sheet with no stick spray. I will make again, might play with the spices!

I love this recipe. Since squash is one of the few things I can have since I'm not allowed to have store bought french fries or sweet potatoes due to candida, I tried this recipe in hopes of finding something really tasty. They turned out just like sweet potato fries and are now one of my comfort foods. Thanks for the great recipe!

SOOOOO good!!! My household is not a huge fan of squash including me, I only like a tiny bit at thanksgiving but this was a great healthy way to get everyone eating it a bit more! I cut up into fry shapes & put in a zip lock bag with just enough olive oil to coat them (didn't want them to get soggy!) Then sprinkled cinnamon & nutmeg on them. I didn't measure anything just eyeballed it. Turned out great! My only complaint was that it was a tad bit soggy (not my complaint I still thought they were good but still could have been crispier!) Next time I think I will broil them close to the heat to get them to crisp up a bit....or bake them halfway then finish them off broiled! Either way great recipe!!! Nice alternative to sweet potato fries....its nice to switch it up a bit sometimes!

These are very tasty but with or without oil I could not get them to be crispy enough to be like fries. Still would make again even as is, but will keep trying to get them crispy. Thanks for the recipe!

I did what others suggested, I added olive oil. I also added kosher salt, pepper and paprika. They ended up being delicious. Only problem is that they're kind of mushy and I had to cook them for way longer than 20 minutes... and when I decided enough was enough (some were beginning to burn), they were still not very firm.

I used some olive oil, salt, roasted garlic and tossed. I used a broiler pan so the liquid would fall through the holes. They were tender in about 30 minutes, but I couldn't seem to get them crispy. They still taste good.

I loved these but did them up old school but deep frying them in Canola oil and then when they came out crispy, I sprinkled them with salt, cayenne pepper, garlic powder and curry powder.  They were and awesome side dish to the grilled chicken sandwiches I made that night!    I realize they were a bit more fattening deep fried but not as much as standard french fries.

these were great!  I'd done this with sweet potatoes before but not butternut squash! I too basted it lightly with olive oil and sprinkled a mix of cinnamon, a tiny bit of nutmeg, salt and some pepper. Delicious!

My husband and I thought these were pretty tasty.  We shook them in a ziploc bag with olive oil , salt and pepper and they had a great flavor. I didn't read the instructions well and baked them at 350 for 1/2 an hour before realizing the temp was supposed to be 425. So then I broiled them for 5 minutes.  Not really crispy but SO good!

I was looking for a winter squash recipe that didn't call for a ton of sugar/butter/etc., and this fit the bill. Mine never got crispy like traditional fries, and I found I had to cook them a bit longer than 20 minutes. That may just underscore the need to slice them somewhat thinly. Mine weren't as close to sweet potato fries as I had expected from the description, but they were a welcome and healthy change of pace.

These fries are totally awesome even without the salt. Sprinkle with white or brown sugar also for a grand taste but my favorite is just with a touch or salt. We could not get enough of these!!! They are as awesome as sweet potato fries. I deep fried ours in veggie oil. We love these so much I am going to fry up a bunch and take them to my mom and sisters house for them to try. This is going down in our family traditional foods!!! Thanks soooooooooooooooooooo much!!!!!

These were fantastic. Did them with sea salt and paprika. I couldn't stop eating them and I don't usually like squash.

Not the crispiest fries you'll eat, but a great way for kiddies to east their squash!  Tossed with EVOO and Kosher salt too.

My 2 year old inhaled these! I put them under the broiler for a few minutes at the end to crisp them up a bit. I think no matter what you do they'll always be a little soft but they're delish and good for you!

Very good and easy!  I shook them up with a little olive oil, salt, and cinnamin.  Added ground pepper when they came out.

VERY tasty! I dipped them in sour cream, which complemented the sweet flavor of the squash nicely. This is a really fun concept, and I think that I will try it with other types of squash too. Thanks for a great recipe! :)

This is a great use for butternut - I've made them twice so far and the first time they were fabulous, the second kinda eh but I think I did not bake them long enough. I was hungry!

SPRAY YOUR PAN! Or coat the squash with some kind of oil first. I WILL TRY THIS AGAIN!! I just put mine on a non-stick pan and they just mushed when I tried to get them off. EXCELLENT FLAVOR!! Might try to deep fry them next time also. Thank you for sharing but you need to add the oil!

I love this! I  just stumbled across this while looking for something else to make with squash. I make the fries and then serve them with feta cheese...sounds a little weird but I love the flavors together. It's a great snack or side dish!

As suggested, I coated with evoo, cinn, nutmeg, and house blend.  Very good, but it was a little mushy.  I will experiment with the temp and timing to try to firm it up.

These are AMAZING!!!!! I coated mine in olive oil and added salt and fresh cracked pepper, with just a dash of cinnamon, cayenne, and garlic powder and they're perfect. Theyre tender but not mushy. I cut them like I would any homemade fries...not too skinny, but not as big as steak fries. Will be making these again...tomorrow!

My husband and I liked these a lot. We'll let the kids try them next time--hope they like them just as much. It's important to make sure I slice the fries big enough, and also that they cook long enough to get a little crispy. Yummy!

These did come out a little bit soggy but that's to be expected. I baked them more like 30-35 minutes though. Only 4 stars because I think they needed a little seasoning. I tossed in olive oil, salt, pepper and paprika and served with some sweet/savory dipping sauces. Boyfriend loved them so will probably make again. Thanks!

My family never eats veggies, shockingly they actually ate these and even liked them.  They were a little mushy, but no one complained.

I cubed mine and put it into a baggie with a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of sugar and salt and smooshed it around until coated and then baked. My picky daughter and my carnivore husband both devoured them and asked for more. Will make again for sure! Also great with no seasonings for my 13 month old.

These weren't bad, I think for my tastes next time i'll add some cayenne and maybe some garlic powder with the salt. I tasted them as is after they baked and they just seemed sweet and I'm more of a sweet and savory person so I added some cayenne and that improved it for me but tomorrow when i reheat some i'll try the garlic and cayenne to see what I think. Overall good base recipe.

Good recipe.  I used some pumpkin that came from our garden this year and it tasted so good.  My 3 year old ate them quicker than anyone in the family.  Don't waste your seeds either (pumpkin or squash).  You can toast them and enjoy them for dessert!

We didn't eat these.  We love butternut squash in other recipes.  But after 40 minutes of cooking they were still mushy.  I cut them pretty thin.  I did the olive oil.  I did the cinnamon.  My husband took one taste and said ugh!  The soups I've made are a much better use of this squash!

These are fantastic. I used a toaster oven, cut slices in 1/4" to 1/3" after peeling (use microwave method as others suggest), lightly dust kosher salt and bake as directed, then flip over slices, salt and bake as directed. I then followed with broil feature on the toaster oven to dry the "fries" and the batches couldn't cool fast enough. Easy, fast to make and good nutrition without loading up with sugar.

I thought these were great but, as I did some changes, I didn't give it 5 stars.  First off, it is really difficult (or it was for me) to cut these into steak fries shapes.  I put some oil on my baking sheet and then sprinkled the fries with ginger, cinammon and salt- yummy!  They didn't need to be drained as some others have commented.  Great!

I thought this was great!!  It was so easy and my kids loved it.  I also added a little olive oil into a zip-top bag and added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg then tossed with the squash.  Will definitely make again soon.  What a good way to get the kids to eat their veggies and love every bite!!

MMMM!  These were really good.  I bought pre-cut squash from Costco so I didn't have to peel, just slice into small thin pieces.  I seasoned them with EVOO, cinnamon, sea salt, and pumpkin pie spice.  I threw them around in a plastic bag and then baked them in a single layer, turning/tossing a few times while baking.

Followed other reviewers' suggestions & used a combo of salt, pepper, garlic powder, cinnamon, ginger, & allspice after tossing the fries in EVOO prior to baking.  I used the convection function on my oven, and it still took the full cook time to get the fries crisp.  Even then, some were a bit mushy, but I gave those to my 9 month old.  I think we're all addicted (even the baby)!

These were very good - I used olive oil, salt and pepper. True, they came out a tad on the mushy side - so I broiled them for a little at the end. My husband loved - but said they were a bit bland, so put Tobasco on them. He recommended fried onions with them next time, so Ièll try that. Also , I was surprised at how little comes out of one massive butternut squash! good for a side dish for 4 people.

Cut circles like someone suggested. Mixed 1tblsp of coconut oil w/ cinn,cloves and sugar. Baked for 25 min. some got a little crispy, i think it would turn out crispy w/ less coconut oil and longer time. Delicious!! Great possibilities, tastes like pie.

Really good flavor. I did toss with about 1 tsp of olive oil before baking, no trouble with sticking. I couldn't stop snacking on them right out of the pan!

I made them with krinkle precut butternut squash I bought from Trader Joes. So easy that way. Maybe next time I might tumble them in some olive oil first. I didn't add salt but better than what I expected. Thank you!

Not quite as good as sweet potato fries. I do not like that they do not crisp up easily, but they tasted pretty good. I used a baking rack in the oven with a sheet pan so the fries did not turn out soggy.  That did help! I added a tablespoon of olive oil and sprinkled a small amount of sea salt and pepper on them. I think next time I want to try them with a small bit of brown sugar and cinnamon! I will definitely make these again!

I have made it twice and  will definitely make it again. The first time I used to much Cajun seasoning and it was too hot and salty. I toned it back some the second time and it was better. In both cases I found that 20 minutes was not enough cooking time. They did not look cooked and they were too hard  and had to go back into the oven. I had to add another  15 minutes at least.   But great recipe and wonderful to have guilt free fries!

Good recipe and I just added coconut oil to the pan on broil and they sizzled. Some came out pretty perfect and the rest were just really yummy.

After reading numerous reviews (positive and negative) I decided to slice the butternut squash thin, thick linguine noodle size strips.  I stored the noodle like strips on a thick layer of paper towels in an air tight container overnight.  Prior to placing them in the oven I sprayed the squash with butter cooking spray and then sprinkled the squash with garlic powder.  15 minutes in the oven the last 3-5 minutes  under  broil heat,  Healthy,  crispy and so delicious.  WINNER!

Would've loved it to be crispy like an actual fry. I've not only baked the squash but also fried it in a frying pan and both times the end result was soft and squishy.

This recipe was super mushy even though I broiled the butternut squash after baking at 425...there at the end. The flavor of the "mush-fries" was deeelish!! A plus!!...but ( A BIG FAT BUT) the consistency was disgusting. I do have to note that  I was patient and tried to for 40-ish minutes to make these more french-fry-like. Didn't work.

Never tried doing this with squash before and it was TERRIFIC!  Used a baggie with olive oil, garlic powder, cinnamon, curry, and salt.  Baked for about 30 minutes without turning.  Irresistible! Can't wait to make more -

Yummy! This is definitively something I will make again. I followed the suggestions in the comments of brushing with olive oil first then baking and then I sprinkled with some salt afterwards. I used a crookneck squash instead of butternut because that's the variety I have growing in my garden. I am sure any variety of squash would work.

Very yummy! I almost ate the whole squash! The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is due to texture and the amount of time this takes. I couldn't get mine crispy enough but I think if I had a double broiler that maybe would have solved the problem. I sprinkled my "fries" with salt and let the moisture sweat out onto napkins before baking. All in all I don't think I would make this again unless I am really craving it. I think I will simply roast them. Seems easier.

I used pattypan squash with this since I don't have butternut squash right now.  I also just sliced very thin and made what would probably be considered home fries.  I couldn't find what I wanted for a plain pattypan squash recipe, and this hit the spot.  I'll definitely try again with butternut squash cut like fries.  I, too, used olive oil and chose to use kosher salt bc I like how it looks on fries.  Thanks for the recipe!

The power went out and I forgot the oven went out so my fries came out quite mushy. I still gave the recipe 5 stars because I'm not sure of the original outcome because of my oven. Next time I would like to use my veggie peeler, try shaving the squash, cut matchstick squash, or increase the temperature to get it more crispy.

I've made this several times and it's true that they do end up mushy but they taste so good! I use season salt instead of regular salt and I usually end up eating the whole squash by myself :)

These were ok... We love butternut squash so we really expected to like them a lot more, but we prefer the squash the way we usually cook it -- roasted with other veggies.

Even after tossing with olive oil and seasonings they turned out soft and mushy, which is ok if you're not looking for something at least a little crispy.

This was really good. I took "busymomma's" advice and placed the butternut squash into a bag, sprinkled 2 tbsp. of olive oil in it, some salt and pepper, and some sprinkles of cumin (about 1/2-1 tsp.). It was very difficult to cut the butternut squash into strips. Next time I will have to remember to use my food processor - which has a french-fry mode - too bad I didn't think of that earlier.. otherwise I will just cut it into squares.

I'm not sure what happened with everyone else's recipes, but when I cut the squash thinly in the shape of fast-food french fries, they crisped up wonderfully.  I also added cinnamon and nutmeg, and I smeared the pan with a little grapeseed oil.  Very good!

eh... I don't know if I'd make these again.  I used vegetable oil and a pinch of salt with pumpkin seasoning.  I probably should have added a pinch of sugar or brown sugar as well because the pretty much just tasted like cooked squash.  they were a little on the soggy side, but not awful.

There's no fooling the kids with these "fries".  They taste like squash, have the texture of squash and no one in the family thought they were anything but oven baked squash.  Nice to have another way to serve butternut and very tasty...as long as you like squash!

very easy and delicious. Would have liked them a little crisper but I will just broil them a little or raise the oven temp. That's all. We prefer just a little garlic salt and olive oil. Great idea!! Thanks

Very good.  I just kept it simple and put the cut up squash in a large zip bag, drizzled some EVOO, some cinammon sugar, nutmeg...laid out on a liberally sprayed cookie sheet, and salted.  Turned a couple times while cooking.  They stayed a little soft, but that didn't matter to me.  They were very tasty!  Something different!

I had no problem getting them crispy.  They weren't AS crispy as french fries but they were not mushy.  I made them with some sweet sauce of honey, butter, sugar, cinnamon, etc. found on another website.  My only problem was peeling the butternut squash! I struggled with it for a while.

Definitely toss with olive oil/other to prevent from sticking. I used salt and pepper and tossed halfway through. Really good. something different!

i also found these good with little olive oil, but found that they dont really ever get crispy.  i jacked the temp way up to 500 and flipped a couple times with increased cook time around 40 min.  this gave some slight crisp outsides.  the insides were soft and tasty though.  its a good use of a squash if you have no other.

I wanted a sweet treat for the kids so I tossed them in a plastic bag with pumpkin pie spice and some sugar.  I sliced my fries very thin and after baking 20 minutes I broiled them for like 5 minutes  They still didn't get crisp, but the kids ate them anyway.

These were too soft and stuck to the pan even though I liberally greased it and tossed the sticks in a baggie with the seasonings and more oil. I cooked them longer than stated as well. They did have a great flavor to them but it just did not outweigh the softness of the fries.
