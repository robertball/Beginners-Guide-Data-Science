This is a wonderful recipe, and it's very quick and easy to make.  I didn't let my young children participate because of the risk of burns, but with very close parental supervision, older children could certainly help make this wonderful treat!  I used 16 medium sized apples, and the recipe scaled for 18 small apples wasn't enough, so I made a second batch and poured the remaining caramel onto parchment paper, allowed it to cool, and cut it into squares.  I plan on giving a container of chocolate caramels and the recipe to friends and family at Christmas!

This is a great recipe -- try it, and I'm sure it will become one of your favorites too!

I tried this today for my family first before making for a school Halloween Party and my family loved it.  It has a different taste since it is chocolate, not caramel, but did not seem as sweet or sticky as caramel.  My husband's comment was:  "I have never in my life eaten an entire caramel apple until now."  I will definitely be making it for the party and in years to come.  Thanks for sharing!

These were very good. I made a batch covered in peanuts and a batch covered in candy. I plan on making these again for my son's halloween party.

I made this recipe yesterday for a party in the courthouse and my sister and 2 friends split one to taste.  They are absolutely delicious.  I was able to make 22 small apples with the recipe.  This beats plain caramel apples hands down.

Since I find the little store bought, wrapped caramels grainy and runny, I decided to make my own caramel for apples this year.  This is the best recipe!  The unsweetened chocolate really takes some of the overwhelming sweetness out of the caramel.  I didn't need as many apples as the recipe calls for, so I let the left over caramel harden a little on a baking sheet, then wrapped them as individual candies.  They are smooth and delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe!

My family absolutely loved these apple treats. Wonderful change than traditional caramel apples. I personally feel these are tastier than the traditional caramel apple.  Followed the recipe and they came out Fabulous!!! Thanks for this recipe.
