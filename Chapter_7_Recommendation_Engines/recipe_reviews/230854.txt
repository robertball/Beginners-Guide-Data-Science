Very good chicken.  The cornmeal adds a nice crunch.  Just had to make sure to shake off all the excess breading. We will be making this again for sure!

I want this to work as I've been trying several recipes for crispy fried chicken, but I need help. I followed this recipe re ingredients and temperatures, but the chicken turned out burnt on the outside and raw on the inside. I must have missed something!

This is a true Southern Fried Chicken recipe...I've made it for years. To those of you who "burned on outside, pink in middle, you could of done a number of things either "flame to high, crowed your pieces, or did not make sure pieces were of the same uniform size. Also, make sure oli is hot enough before placing piecec in...Any GOOD quality deep fry pan, will work. Do NOT fill oil more than one inch. Make sure "one side is completely browned and crispy "before turning over. Do not "over turn.
You must use the buttermilk to get it tender and juicy. It "does not change or alter the flavor in any way:)..I do cook at approx.370...350 is not hot enough to get that "instant crisp." after about 5 minutes that "seals the juices".Take your time. Never be in a hurry when making this.You can change up the spices you use. Sometimes I use Italian spice mix, with added garlic powder(yum) and then other times I make it spicy with garlic powder/salt pepper to taste.MAKE SURE to drain on paper towels or you'll get "wet coating". Do this EVERY time you fry anything. Never skip o the "little details when you cook. Enjoy! I get requests for my old fashion Southern fried chicken ALL the time. Its TOTALLY different than the " you get in restrurants:)

Burnt on the outside and raw inside also. It was better when we cooked it at 375 but it was still burnt. The chicken was nice and juicy but I would not make this again.

I thought I was a competent cook, but this recipe challenged me, from marinading the chicken (which I skinned) in buttermilk for 12-24 hours, to resting prepared chicken on a rack (which I didn't). The biggest problem was trying to maintain a steady temperature in my cast iron skillet. Maybe it would have gone better in a deep fryer. A few pieces came out pretty good, but many of them were burnt outside/undercooked inside. I wouldn't try it again without a fryer. At least I went the easier route and used all chicken legs.

My husband is a very picky man. He is usually the cook in the house, and a VERY good one at that!! I do have to say that I felt a great deal of accomplishment when he tried this chicken after I made it and said that it was the best he had ever had. Thanks so much for sharing!!!

Tastes delicious! The flavor is not too overpowering nor lacking - just right. What I did was bake it instead of frying. I sprayed canola oil before putting in the oven at 350 degrees fahrenheit for a good 30 - 50 minutes. Yum!

I used this recipe except I cooked in in an air fryer rather than in oil.  Marinated in butter milk with seasoned salt over night. Removed the chicken from the butter milk and let it set on a rack for 10 minutes, shook it in the bag of flour and let it rest  on a rack another 10 minutes. Meanwhile I preheated my air fryer 390 degrees for 4 minutes.  Sprayed the chicken with olive oil, put in in the air fryer sprayed side down and sprayed the other side.  Cooked 10 minutes, flipped and cooked another 10 minutes. Checked with instant read thermometer . 
 for 165.  Very good,will probably adjust the seasonings a bit the next time, but this is a keeper.
