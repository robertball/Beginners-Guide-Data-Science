The flavor of the meat in this recipe is really good, but the cooking time is way, way, WAY off!!!  At 45 minutes, my leg of lamb, which was only THREE pounds, was only about half done.  I think the recipe meant to say cook 45 minutes, turn, and cook 45 minutes more.  That'd be more accurate, though I'm still thinking it'd be a pretty rare dish.  It took almost 2 hours for mine to cook.  My family (including my carnivorous dad) really thought it came out very moist and loved the flavor, though, so I will make it again just keeping in mind that it takes a lot longer to cook.  The gravy is kind of grainy because of the bread crumbs, but the meat almost doesn't need it.  Next time I may just add some beef broth to the drippings and thicken it a bit and call it good.

This recipe is truly amazing! Several of the calculations are REALLY off. First of all, a 5 pound lamb serves a lot more than 4 people, unless you're feeding sumo wrestlers. Second of all, like a turkey or other roast, you can't fully cook 5 pounds of meat in 45 minutes. You do need about 1 hour per pound of meat. In light of needing about 5 hours to cook, I recommend that you add the bacon somewhere in the last 1/2 hour of cook time.

I love gravy.  When I used this recipe I replaced the wine with 1/2 cup of red wine. Parsley became optional. Then to thicken I used a little Veloutine (Instant Thickener).

I loved this recipe!  The gravy was weird because I've not made my gravy that way before but it was good!  I used red wine instead of white and I thought the entire thing was amazing.  I also sprinkled "Herbs de Provence" all over the lamb before putting the bacon on it and it was spectacular!  My piece of lamb was only 1.4 lbs but I used a thermometer and set it for 140 F.  It was PERFECT!  Just the right amount of pink and OH SO GOOD!!!  I paired it with an Israel couscous pilaf and some roasted broccoli, carrot, and cauliflower mix.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!
