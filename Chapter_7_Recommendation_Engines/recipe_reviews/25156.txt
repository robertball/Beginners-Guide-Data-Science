This was a great snack while passing the time BBQ-ing with friends!  Followed directions, but only snipped in a "little" mint, not the full amount. The mint really adds a little surprise to it!  We had Sea Salt Bagel Crisps, spread some garlic and herb soft cheese on it, topped off with a cucumber/grape tomatoes sliced small/onions from the salad and really enjoyed it!  Thanks - even better than Mom used to make!

I've been making this salad (without the mint) for years-the mint was a new twist to the recipe that we all enjoyed!

The mint is an enjoyable change from basil or oregano, which are typically used in salads of this type.  Great salad!

I made this salad for a big group of friends and nobody, including myself, liked it that much. I would suggest cutting down on the onions because the onion flavor really overwhelms the salad.

Perfect summer side dish, would be great at a barbeque.  Found it to be a little too much liquid though, so next time I would reduce.  Very tasty!

I didn't have mint, but it's fine without it. I would prepare the salad right before serving as it got extremely watery. Very tasty though.

I try to serve salads four or five times a week and get stuck in a real rut. This was not only different but delicious as well. I have worked it into one of my "standards".

The whole family LOVED this side-dish! My toddler asked for seconds five times...so I guess he asked for fifths. (He's a little unusual, though--i.e., loves raw onions--which is why I rated this a 3 for kid friendly.)

This salad is very yummy.  The red wine and sugar marinade is delicious and adds a sweet yet almost acidic flavor.  I added avocado which we love and it added a creamy texture to all the crunch.  The mint was refreshing!  This salad is very reminscent of a salad I make affectionately called "Drew's Salad" after my hubby who does not like lettuce.  I make mine with all the ingredients here but also with chopped sweet peppers (the little ones you can get in the bag now.)   I use Italian dressing or oil/balsamic, but I think I will keep making this salad and yummy dressing but continue to add avo and also peppers.

Thanks! I needed a good base recipe for tomato and cucumber salad. Skip the mint and substitute rice wine vinegar for the red wine vinegar and you have Noodles & Co's cucumber tomato salad recipe! I sprinkle it with celery salt, too.

Loved the recipe, but I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because I made a few changes. I only had one cucumber and one tomato and no fresh mint, so I used half of one red onion instead of the 2/3 cup. I diced the cucumber and tomato, put them in a collander and let them sit in the sink for fifteen minutes or so. Then I sprinkled them with 1.5 tsp salt, tossed them to distribute the salt, and put them back in the sink for 2 hours. Rinsed off the salt, drained them, and made the dressing. For 1 cucumber, 1 tomato, and half a red onion, I used 2 Tbsp. red wine vinegar, 1 tsp sugar, and 2 tsp dried mint. Combined everything in a bowl, popped it in the refrigerator, and it was fantastic the next day. Yes, that's a lot of steps, but each of them takes what? Thirty seconds? It's pobably about fifteen minutes active prep time, and most of that is chopping veggies.

This is a DELICIOUS salad...and the only reason that I gave it 4 stars is due to the revisions that I made.   The best advice I can give anyone looking to try a new recipe, is to read the reviews from other cooks who have tryed it first.  Very valuable and well worth afew extra mins to do some reading!  I used Rice Wine Vinegar rather than the much stronger suggested Red Wine. I cut back abit on the sugar and added one minced Garlic Clove and alittle Celery seed as well.  I cut the seeded Cukes in chunks and salted them in a colander in the frig for about an hour to draw out some of the water. Other reviews mentioned that the Red onion was over-powering.  As a result I used only 1/4 of a red Onion;sliced very thin and steeped it for 5 mins. in hot water and then drained to 'soften' the sharpness,then added 5 Green onions; sliced to make up the difference lost in the amount. One other thing that was unclear is WHAT KIND of Mint to use.  I have 3 different kinds growing in my herb bed.  I used Peppermint in this recipe and minced it finely ( again a suggestion from another review )Peppermint was brighter in taste than the Spearmint I sampled in the garden.  Top with Feta Cheese if you have some..yummy! Overall.VERY GOOD salad.  Both my Husband and I really enjoyed it with Rosemary Salmon and fresh Corn-on-the-Cob. Well worth trying and adjusting to your own personal tastes. :)

Great recipe and I love the mint!  The ONLY thing I will be sure to do next time is chop up the mint super super fine - I enjoyed the taste of the mint but not chewing the leaves themselves!

For those who thought there was too much liquid...slice the cucumber down lenthwise and scrape out the center seeds...then chop the cucumber into bite size chunks. I've made this for years but usually just add zesty italian dressing and no mint.  This receipes just gives a little different twist.

I would make this again. I used green onion instead of red onion and red wine vinegar instead of white wine vinegar - because it's what I had onhand, and it worked great.

I prepared this salad for myself first - then my family.  We all really liked it, except the mint was a little heavy!  Tried it again minus the mint and used a little leamon juice.  It is wonderful.

I've been made fun of for making this, for years!  So glad to see that other people enjoy it too.  I've never known how to dress it up and thanks to you now I can.  I always had it with just tomatoes, cukes, vinegar, salt, pepper!  And folks out there concerned about it getting watery, not a problem.  Cukes and tomatoes are so full of water, the ingredients bring out that water.  But I just eat this delicious, refreshing snack and leave the water in my dust.  It's always going to "sweat" I believe it's called, just because of it's character.  Not a problem for me, I use a fork and the water just drains right through to the bottom of the dish.  :o)

I like this combination, but found the recipe very salty and had to add more sugar and vinegar to try and balance out the saltiness.  I also cut the olive oil because it didn't seem necessary.  It wasn't.  The dressing was watery, but that was fine by me, and it marinaded the veggies so it's even better after a day in the fridge.  I liked the amount of mint in the recipe and wouldn't reduce it, it provides a nice fresh taste.

If anyone is doing WW I put this into the Recipe Builder and it comes out to 3 Points under the new Points Plus system because of the Olive Oil.  The only thing I'd like to know is the serving size - yes I know you get 6 servings out of this, but how big?  Is it a cup, 1/2 cup?  Definitely a nice, easy salad for the summer.  Thank you for posting!!

Loved it!  Our garden has produced an abundance of cucumbers, so I've used at least 3 different salads from this site.  I really like the mint flavor with the red wine vinegar.  I only used about 1 Tbsp of olive oil and I always substitute green onions for red onions since my husband doesn't like red ones.

Fresh and yummy! I chopped up the tomatoes and let them sit while the cucumbers were in vinegar, then drained the liquid before tossing together.

I so loved this salad! I used fresh heirloom tomatoes (red and yellow) and a cuke right out of my neighbors garden. I was really surprised how the mint mellowed out in this salad. The red onion is key and there was a subtle sweetness from the sugar, the tartness of the vinegar with the freshness of the mint. Great combo of flavors. Served with Spicy Shrimp Skewers and Zucchini Patties from this site. A yummy recipe...thanks!

Very nice salad.  Best to make it in the morning so the flavors blend.  I have had to make it with cider vinegar and it was still very good.

Excellent salad.  The combination of flavors, and especially the mint, remind me of wonderful foods we ate while living in the Middle East.  For supper tonight, I paired this with a slow cooker Chicken Curry and rice.  Thanks for this post.

Greatastic salad! It's so fresh and healthy and I love the unusual touch given by sugar and mint. I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine and didn't bother to marinate beforehand because I was in a hurry. I don't think it'd make a huge difference.

I think this salad is awesome.  I served it with Parmesan-breaded chicken, which it complimented very well.  It's refreshing and different as far as salads go.

I guess I shouldn't rate this because I didn't add the mint.  I hope the mint makes all the difference because this was nothing special.

7/13/06 I only used 1/2 the salt and 1/3 the oil to make it healthier still. (We will see if the left overs turn out.) I also used cherry tomatoes, quartered with seeds because that is what I have from my garden. It made a more attractive salad. I did not have any fresh mint so I used 1 Tbls. of dried crushed mint.  It was wonderful!!P.S. Marinating with the salt draws out the water from the cucumbers, but I think that is the point, to make dressing.  Try using 1/2 the salt and it should reduce the water.

I always get compliments when serving this salad.  I too cut done on the mint so it's not so overwhelming.  I've even sprinkled crushed peanuts on top right before serving.

I had high hopes for this salad as I liked all the ingredients, and I have mint growing in the garden.  However, it was just average.  It just didn't work for us.  Sorry, but thanks for sharing.

Excellent salad for a change of pace! Very tangy sweet/sour dressing makes a great side dish for any entree. My husband gets kind of tired of the "tomato" salads as my garden overfloweth! He loved this fresh and spicy alternative! Fixed it exactly as posted!

This recipe is a jewel. I made this with homegrown heirloom tomatoes, 6 persian (mini) cucumbers, and mint.  Reminiscent of a mediterranean/middle eastern salad, so it's probably a great compliment to any dish along those lines... but also great by itself!

This recipe is similar to one of my country's (Iran) salad, the name is Shirazi salad, and we just use a chopped small onion , chopped tomatoes and cucumbers, and for dressing we add lime juice, salt and dry mint. Enjoy it!

I was looking for a new mint recipe because we have so much of it growing around our house.  I happened to have all of the ingredients for this laying around so I threw it together for a party and it was a huge hit.  The only thing that I changed was that I didn't add as much onion that the original recipe called for, but that was it.  The pile of fresh mint was a huge hit.  Thanks for sharing this one.  I'll be making this a lot.

I make this salad all the time but in place of the mint I use fresh finely chopped parsley and pinch of celery salt and instead of seeding the tomatoes I use grape tomatoes cut in half. My family loves this salad, there is never any left after a meal

I would've never thought about putting mint in a salad but it grows wild in my herb garden so gave it a try. My son and his gal were here and they loved it. I used three cucumbers and still had a ton of juice, and felt it was a bit overpowering in the vinegar, so next time I'll use less vinegar and maybe cider or rice vinegar because the red wine discolors the salad. But I will put mint in more salads, it surprisingly adds a nice refreshing flavor and not real minty tasting.

I liked the flavors blended together.  What I did not like was the large chunks of veggies.  Next time I will cut cucumber into quarters and use halved cherry tomatoes instead.

Im soo glad i found this.  I have been looking for this salad for so long because it reminds me of the salad i love at the restaurant we love to eat, they actually serve it very chilled on top of lettuce.  SOO good, i did just as recipe called for, let chill for about 2 hours, and added on top of chopped lettuce just like the restaurant! thanks

I really liked this recipe. I did tweak it just a bit, adding about twice the sugar and using balsamic vinegar instead. Thanks much.

Great recipie. I gave it 4 because the vinegar was a little too strong. I recommend not using quite as much. Still a very good easy salad. Suggestion: to cut the mint I reccomend using sizzers.

Quick and delicious! I have always left the seeds in when I made tomato/cucumber salad before...I took the time to seed them and they were perfect. I used regular vinegar and added a couple small yellow bell peppers. What a pretty presentation! I put the whole salad in a freezer bag and let it marinade in the fridge. Yummy!!

I had a lot of cucumbers to use so this recipe was great. I did cut the mint in half and I still thought it was a bit too much.  I also cut the olive oil down to 2 tbs, and that seemed to work well. All in all a very refreshing side dish. Thank you!

Great summer salad when you have lots of fresh garden cucumbers and tomatoes. I also added goat cheese crumbles and olives to kick it up a notch.

This was delicious. I used fresh tomatoes, cucumbers, and mint from my garden. I didn't have time to marinate for an hour, just 1/2 hour and it was still yummy, so refreshing and healthy tasting. Thanks Alison

This is a delicious salad for this time of year with fresh produce from your garden or the farmer's market. The use of mint adds to the fresh flavor of this salad. I agree with other reviewers that it has too much liquid. The next time I make it I won't do the first step an hour ahead of time because I believe the salt draws moisture from the cucumbers. I may also cut back a little on the vinegar and olive oil. I will definitely be making this salad again.

With our summer garden producing record amounts of tomatoes and cucumbers, this was an excellent way to get rid of some of them in a refreshing dish.

Here are a couple changes that I felt enhanced the recipe. First, I used seasoned salt rather than regular salt. I felt that it needed a little more umpf, and it really gave it that extra flavor.

In regards to the onion being too strong, there are 2 simple changes that can be made and will make the onion flavor more mild and enjoyable. First, slice the onions very thinly and into the crescent shape rather than coarsely. Secondly, mix all ingredients (including onions) together with dressing and allow to sit for an hour, stirring or shaking once in awhile. As the onions sit with the other ingredients, they will become more mild, and the flavors will meld.

on paper this recipe sounded great... however, i think that there was far too much vinegar and it overwhelmed the balance of the salad.  also, i thought that the mint sounded like a creative and unusual addition and i was excited to use it (i even bought a mint plant!) but honestly if i make this again i won't use it.  it just tasted "out of place"...

Very pretty, very tasty, and very easy.  Next time I might try chopping the cucumber instead of slicing so that all the veggies are the same shape.

Loved this!  Such an amazing blend of flavors. Since I'm on a diet and have to avoid most fat I left out the oil and juiced half of a lemon instead.  SO tasty.  Also, instead of sugar I now use Truvia and it only took 2 packets.  I will make this again for sure!

My family has been making this type of salad for years, but we just dice the cucumber, tomato, and onion, optional mint/parsley/chives or other green, add salt and pepper to taste and some lemon juice, the lemon juice gives it a great flavor. With the lemon juice though this salad is best served fresh, although it is still pretty good the second day it gets rather watery, the salt makes it watery too.

I made the recipe with 2 cucumbers, 1/2 the red onion, and 2 tomatoes. All other ingredients the same. I didn't have mint (forgot it at the store), but decided to make it anyway. I thought it was absolutely delicious. I added some crumbled feta cheese on top and was in heaven! it is such an easy recipe and soooo delicious, even without the mint. Some reviewers said it was too "vinegary"; in my opinion it was just right. Thank you for the awesome recipe!

This has to be the best and simplest dressing I have ever made! A great balance of acid/oil/sweetness. I served it over a salad of cucumbers, red onions, tomatoes, romaine lettuce and mint leaves. Will definetly make this again and again. Thanks for such a great recipe!

This was delicious. I made this for lunches at work. It got even better throughout the week. I did put in chopped avocado because I had one I needed to use.  I will make this again and again.

This was a nice salad, but next time I will use less vinegar and a bit more oil.

This is one of my favorite salads to make when I have extra cucumbers and tomatos on hand.  I usually only add half the amount of olive oil called for, and it turns out great.  I've also made it without mint (when I didn't have any but wanted this salad), and it still tasted great.

I made this without the mint as my boyfriend hates it.  Still came out yummy.  I served it over couscous seasoned with a little salt, pepper, olive oil, and Asiago cheese.

This is a nice refreshing summer salad and a pleasant way to use fresh garden produce.  I didn't have red onion so I used one from the garden.  This didn't score a 5 in my book because it wasn't totally outstanding.  Just nice and pleasant.

I'm not a huge fan of cucumber, but this recipe is wonderful!  The mint makes the salad.  We had fresh mint in our garden and a cucumber from our neighbors' garden on hand.  I used halved cherry tomatoes instead of the suggested large tomatoes, and cut back a little on the vinegar & the salt.  Thanks for this great summer recipe!

I made this last night and it was wonderful. Had company over and they wanted the recipe. I made it according to recipe except I added garlic to it minced. I have a garden with lemon cucumbers and regular cucumbers and tomatoes, so I will be making it a lot. It taste great with Mint.

Been making this salad since I was .... well my mom made this salad when I was a child in the 60's  It is timeless.  

I do modify this recipe occasionally by omitting the sugar and adding watermelon as the sweet component.  Tossed in at the end and served

I have used this exact recipe for years, but I never saw it with mint before.  It is delicious with the mint, but my better half prefers it without.  I also sometimes put a half tsp. or so of celery seeds in when I add the tomato mixture.

I used sweet Vidalia onions which were great and milder for those who found the red too big a flavor.  I would add a bit less sugar, but it was great with fresh mint from my garden.  I can't wait to taste it tomorrow as I did not take time to let it sit.

I will definitely be making this recipe again. I actually ended up making a "mistake" during the prep. I marinated all the ingredients together in the red wine vinegar. It was certainly a powerful taste but I was strangely addicted to it. I found myself going back for more and more. I will make it by recipe instructions the next time to compare the flavors. Great salad.

My husband really enjoyed this. It's nice and refreshing. I agree with other reviewers that it needs to be served right away or else the salad gets too wet and juicy. We put it on top of a crusty bread which was great!

I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I subbed it with rice wine vinegar and used half the sugar and half of the amount of red onion...I could tell it was it was a very strong flavor just chopping it. The mint is refreshing...we liked this a lot!

I will make with Basil instead of mint next time.  But very good.  The mint is strong so use less if you aren't a huge fan....

this is a staple in our family now. we are a veggie family but i'm always looking for a way to change it up from a regular tossed salad. this one is perfect. my husband loves it and it holds well for lunch the next day. a plus is it looks beautiful on the table! i did simplify it a bit after making it a few times exactly as stated it all just depends on time. for an extra flare add greek olives and feta for some medeterranian flair!

Wow! I thought that a salad with mint in it would taste really odd- like a dessert.  But, it was really tasty - the mint just adds a 'refreshing' taste to it, but doesn't taste truly "minty" to me.  Everyone loved it, including the kids.

This is wonderful!  I wanted to use up a cucumber and some tomatoes and remembered this recipe.  I followed the directions exactly.  You have to try this recipe.  Will be making salmon tonight so I will have this along side.  This salad is good anytime of year that you want something light.  This is a great recipe for the diet concious, plus being good for you too!!

It was very tasty.  The mint added a very nice extra flavor.  But the wine vinegar was overpowering for us.  I would try this again using less vinegar.

I omitted the mint and only let the cucumbers sit for 1/2 an hour in the vinegar and it was still so delicious!  This is one of the easiest salads I've ever made.  

I will be bringing this to parties in the future.

Did not make any changes, but as other reviews have noted quite a bit of water in the finished salad. I will dump the sugar/salt water next time I make it. Otherwise, a real favorite!

The adults loved this more than the kids, but we really lived it. This is just a great, simple summer salad. Easy to put components together while you have a little time between doing other things, and then it’s easy to toss it all in the final bowl just before serving.  I had smaller cucumbers than I’d like so I adjusted everything

I made the marinade and added the onions and English cucumbers a couple of hours early to let them marinade.  I was going to add the tomatoes at the end but I didn't.   This dish was delightful.  My husband that hates onions ate it.  So fresh and summery....  i encourage you to use English cucumbers that have less water, seeds and pulp.  Very nice

Excellent salad! I recently purchased a small mint plant, and it came in handy here. I've never used mint in cooking before, and it really complements this salad. If I was going to bring this for a group (and I'm thinking of doing that because it came out so good), I'd further slice the cucumber into quarters, not just halving it. Nice for the warmer weather when you don't want to deal with mayo. Very light and delicious, too!

I did make changes. I went to a half cup red wine vinegar, 2 tbl of sugar, 1/4 cup olive oil, 3 cucumbers. Makes 8 servings that each are 90.6 calories. I use these for my daily snacks between walks and meals.

This was delicious and I don't often say that about salad! I did make 2 changes..didn't have red wine vinegar so I used Rice vinegar and second...I cut the onions down to half because my family does not like them.  The kids still picked them out but I was ok with them!

This a very tasty salad.  The touch of sweetness with the  red wine vinegar was delicious .  I was surprised that the mint did not stand out.  I did not change anything and I would make it again.

Very tasty. I added black beans and think they added a nice creamy texture.

It was ok...but I'll be trying other recipes to get the flavor I'm looking for.  This would probably be better if you substitute the mint with basil.

This wasn't my family's favorite; nothing "wrong" with it, but we didn't care for the flavor.    I prefer a simpler cucumber, tomato, olive oil, and salt and pepper combination!

Great recipe and everyone liked the flavor.  I added added vinaigrette instead plain olive oil to get more flavors, but the out-of-the-box recipe is probably also great.

My only struggle was with right off the vine cucumbers having so much juice.  Cutting out the seeds doesn't leave a lot of cucumber and not accounting for all the liquid fresh cucumbers makes a watery salad.  This recipe may be better for store-bought cucumbers, the ones from my garden are almost seeping juices.

Made a second time, put cucumbers in a colander for a while then proceeded with directions. Much better.

Tried 3 times...like the Basil touch better.  Maybe because family is not crazy about mint.  Love the simplicity and ease of making.    We add feta on the side...

I love this recipe, I'm not very good at measuring out the ingreds.  Just throw in amounts that look right.  The sugar adds just enough sweetness to make it very palatable.  One of my summer favs and a great opportunity touse my own mint from my garden.

This was outstanding, though I will likely cut the onions back as others have mentioned. The onions were a bit much, 1/3 or 1/2 c per 6 servings may be more appropriate. Also a bit liquidy, but not an issue if you use a slotted spoon to serve.

I liked the idea of cucumber, tomato, and mint. I made a 1/2 recipe, so I just let the cucumber sit for about half the time. I don't care for mushy vegetables anyhow and I knew the vinegar would soften them quite a bit. My issue with the recipe was the vinegar, sugar, salt mixture just had a bitter aftertaste. I was able to remedy that by adding 1-2 Tablepoons of water, common in similar recipes. I would have to work with the dressing on this, so I will probably just stick to my favorite cucumber and tomato recipes on the site.

Not bad. Tastes much better after it sits in the refrigerator overnight instead of eating at room temperature. Next time, I'll also be using less mint.

Great refreshing change.   You have to like mint tho... Or shave back the amount.  My hubbie also thought it had too much vinegar flavor; too sour.  I, however, love vinegar and mint!  It was perfect for me

Very good!  My husband was skeptical about the mint (so was I!) but it added a very different and refreshing flavor to this salad.  I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used balsamic, but less b/c I was afraid it would be too strong of a balsamic taste.  Husband and I both thought this was excellent.  Perfect dish for potlucks when you want something more healthy!!!

Made this for Easter dinner - thought the mint would pair well with the lamb, and that it's over 80 out today - nice hot weather side dish.  

I added some julienned sweet peppers, yellow and red, mainly because I had them on hand and they needed to be used.  I am not a huge fan of raw tomatoes, but I did enjoy them in this salad.

I will update how well it is received at dinner tonight!

This was great! I did not add a whole half cup of mint to the mixture and I used sweet onion because that is what I had. This was so perfect for me to use up the cucumbers! Especially after 2 batchs of pickles. The second time I made it, I left out the mint. I liked it both ways.

Very good flavor, but I just couldn't leave it the way it was. I added 1/2 a bag of spring mix lettuce and a little more Red Wine Vinegar and Olive Oil, mixed it all together, and my whole family loved it! One of the best Salads I have made. Thanks

I wasn't that hungry for dinner so I made this light and refreshing veggie salad. People at work are bringing in cucumbers and tomatoes from their gardens and of course I grabbed some!! Glad that I did. I didn't use the mint because I didn't have any just a little bit of black pepper.

I made this recipe as is and I thought it was great!  I made it for a cooking club and it was a great hit.  Nice change from the typical cucumber salad.

Very yummy!  I only put in 6 mint leaves . . . but they made all the difference in the world!  I'm going to have some of this in my frig for whenever I need a little something zippy!

Refreshing and excellent flavor! A great use of the garden veggies and mint.  I was very pleasantly surprised.

Yumdiddlyumpcious! My co-worker has wild mint that grows in her yard and she gave me a gallon sized baggie full to use up. This salad was perfect! very refreshing. This made a huge batch - I had company for a barbecue and they all loved it. I devoured the leftovers over the next day or two :)

I didn't have mint either but it's still a favorite of my husbands.  I will use mint next time.
