Excellent recipe, but a little modification, Add half teaspoon of Nutmeg, and one star Anise makes the flavour burst in your mouth. Note: you can also use Goat/Beef meat it works perfectly great with the same recipe

Very, very good and very authentic tasting.  It does have a long list of ingredients, but my spice cabinet is pretty well stocked.

This is my favorite Indian dish, along with the Palak Paneer.  This recipe is fantastic!  I love to drink mango lassi with it.

Wonderful recipe. It took me two and half hours to prep  and cook. It turned out real good! Cant wait to make again.
Modification- Step 6: Instead of oil use Ghee(clarified Indian butter). When the onion start turning brown add a handful golden raisins followed by some raw cashews (Do not use the salted or seasoned kind like Planters-- you can get the  raw cashews at the Indian stores, they are like $4.99 for quarter pound).

Great recipe. I left out all the hot spices because I wanted to give it to my 1 year old son. I also didn't have garlic paste and ginger paste. Also, instead of 5 onions, I just put ONE and it turned out perfect. Everyone in my family absolutely loved it even the baby.

It called for a total of five large onions! I used only one giant one, and it was sufficient. It was so spicy.There was not a good balance of meat and rice mixture. The ingredients were expensive.

I did try this two weeks ago and it was great. I used the regular cardamoms and also took the advice on the half tsp of nutmeg and one star Anise, during the frying of the cloves,cardamom and and cinnamon. I used veal as I had some in the freezer. The family really enjoyed it. Thank you.

I just got into cooking a couple months ago. This was my first time making Indian food and it was excellent. I cut the heat back on purpose but next time I believe I will make it as is. Thank you for posting this recipe it was wonderful

5 onions?  Layered with rice in a deep pot?  what?? I need milk??  That is not listed as an ingredient! It turned out to be an expensive sloppy rice soup.  Embarrassed me too.  I followed this recipe to a T.  Choose another recipe.

I roughly followed this recipe and it still turned out  to be the most authentic biryani attempt I've ever made! I  used only 1 onion and 1 tomato, plus two tbsp of tomato paste. Great recipe!

Delicious. Only, put less chills. I put only 2 and it was perfect! Also, next time I'll add one cup more of rice. It was just too much curry to rice. Very authentic recipe, better than many I have had on my annual trips to India. I'll definitely be making this one many times.

I only used two small/med onions, added an extra cardamon, reduced the cinnamon sticks to two. Used two green chili's instead of 4. I didn't use lamb chops, but used lamb stewing meat and I stewed it for a number of hours. It is wonderful! This would work well with beef in place of lamb!

This recipe is a winner, turned out delicious! The first time, I made it exactly the same way listed in the recipe and it was excellent. The second time, after reading all the reviews and looking at other recipes, I decided to added about half a teaspoon of turmeric, a sprinkle of black pepper, 2 stars of anise, about 1/4 teaspoon of cumin and 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg, and it also turned out amazing, just a bit stronger on flavor with the additions but either way it's very good!

I wasn't thrilled about this dish after making it.  I made as written and it didn't look like anything in the picture. while it had several spices listed, it didn't have that aromatic smell or taste like Indian restaurants I've visited. I really felt it needed some cumin in it, maybe some coriander, turmeric, garam masala, and/or nutmeg. Maybe anise star?  I love spices and for a dish that is so flavorful and intense, this really lacked what I was looking for. Thanks for the recipe anyways.

This recipe was pretty great! Only I did 2 medium sized onions and I wish I added one more. Also, I did one less tomato (3) they were small sized tomatoes and not as much as I wanted. I added only 2 chili peppers and I regret it! It came out so spicy. It's still edible but definitely make note of that. Other than that it is a great recipe!!

this recipe was great. tasted authentic and I have tasted many authentic biryani's. i didn't have all the ingredients as is so had to substitute- for example cinnamon powder instead of sticks, ginger powder instead of fresh ginger, no saffron- still came out great. Husband and kids loved it.
