I've used this recipe for over 14 years now, and I was greatful to find that someone had actually written it down.  Previously, I did it from memory.  It's a MUST TRY, and WILL LOVE!!!

This was just ok for me.  The 'instant pudding' taste was predominant - I was expecting more flavor I guess.  Probably would be delicious with homemade puddings instead of instant, but labor intensive. It was eaten, but will probably not make again.

GREAT! Kids ages 10 & 8 loved it, so did hubby and me. We kept in the freezer after the first servings and it was wonderful, especially in the 95-degree Texas heat! Thanks for the post; this is a Keeper.

I took this to a family picnic last weekend and even the cousin who "never eats dessert" had two 
pieces and demanded the recipe.  Next week I'm making it again for my mom
to take to a gathering.  For a dessert that sounds heavy, it's lovely and light. Kay,
thanks for the perfect dessert recipe!

This is wonderful and very easy.  I saw how some said the crust got a little soggy... so I double the crust portion and did not have a problem w/sogginess.

This hit the spot and I even made it a little more healthy.  I used reduced fat Parkay margarine for the crust.  I used Neuchantel cheese for the cream cheese and fat free Cool Whip.  I used ff/sf instant chocolate (2 boxes because I wanted all chocolate on top) made with skim milk.  Very tasty and pretty ok in the calorie and fat department!!  This is certainly in my dessert rotation now!

This was very rich- but very good! My only gripe was the crust got soggy after the first day. Good recipe to make for a crowd- but doesn't keep well for leftovers.

Called "Four Layer Delight" back in the '80s and always a hit in my family at any gathering. The original version shared with me by a friend's mom used chopped pecans in the crust and only called for one layer of instant pudding, using the larger size box. Any flavor from chocolate to pistachio is a crowd-pleaser. Since butterscotch/caramel pudding is my all-time favorite -- but I'm not a fan of the artificially flavored instant variety -- I occasionally go all out at the holidays and make a cooked pudding using brown sugar, butter, milk, and egg yolks (let cool before layering). The luscious smoothness and buttery richness of the real deal makes it worth the extra work and calories!

An Awesome dessert...complemented my ham dinner beautifully. A little time consuming, but well worth the effort.
