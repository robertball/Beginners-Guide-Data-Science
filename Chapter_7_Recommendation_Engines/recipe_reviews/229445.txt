I made a few small changes... I didn't include the pimientos because I didn't have them, and I added smoked paprika because I love it. I thought this dish was creamy and warm and perfect for a cold night.  My family agrees.

Better than the box.  Understand: Kraft Mac and cheese is my GO TO comfort food, so this is SUCH high praise. Most nights, I try to make special, unique dinners, but some nights are just  hot dogs and Mac and cheese nights, until you reMember you don't have Mac and cheese. Until tonight. I think this replaces my box. I did add a TB of cream cheese in the cream phase (partly because I had 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy.) And I tossed in a little Dijon and garlic powder and left out pimentos (because I am a purist when it comes to Mac and cheese). So delicious. so easy. I will no longer go to the box. THANK YOU.

Super fast and easy to make. I didn't have the pearl couscous only traditional and it still came out yummy. I'll be keeping this recipe around!

Great! However i did not use any salt because the brand of chicken broth had so much therefore i added some steamed peas to help with the sodium. I also didn't have pimentos but smoked paprika worked great.

Had to make slight changes because we didn't have all ingredients, so we used sour cream instead of heavy cream, and paprika instead of the other spices.
This recipe seems flexible, though, and I'll probably add garlic, onions and spinach next time. 
Wouldn't say that it tastes exactly like Mac & Cheese because the texture is very different. Still very good tho!

Ok so I'm in the kitchen excepting company in minutes & I am looking at a box of Mac n cheese thinking I cannot serve this. I saw the couscous and after a quick recipe search found this. Love it!! I did omit this pimentos  & cayenne pepper as my focus group was 5 kids ages 6, 4, 3, 1 & 1. They all loved it including the adults. Will definitely make this again as it came together quickly and was better than a box of Mac n cheese. Thank you again Chef John!

I did not have pimento either but loved the splash of color so added a half red poblano diced and sautéed.  My cheese was not sharp - I think sharp would have made it tastier.  Was looking for couscous my teenage grandson would eat.  Success will try again w sharp cheddar.

It was delicious and probably would have been just as good without my changes. I added  a little more than 3 oz and a mix of medium cheddar and smoked muenster cheese. Spiced it up with about 1/3 tsp of  chipotle  powder. Talk about good!!~

Yummy variation on classic mac and cheese. I didn't have heavy cream, so I substituted a combination of milk and butter. Delicious.

I keep forgetting to pick up fresh chives, but I've been substituting Herbs de Provence instead and that has been tasty. The first time I made this I used Italian seasoning and it was just so-so. Husband and I really like this as a substitute to traditional mac'n'cheese. We'll usually mix in baked beans and have a hearty side dish. This is delicious with or without the pimentos. I've shared it around to family and friends since it is so simple, so easy and pretty darned inexpensive. I also like that you can play around with the spices and the cheese.

This was nice change instead of the regular macaroni and cheese!! Great recipe. I did leave out the pimientos because I don't like them.

I don’t make changes to new recipes, ever.  Otherwise, how could you judge it fairly?

This dish was delicious.  Trying to eat less red meat and I served it with  roasted broccoli.

The cheese and heavy cream taste was very prominent but the taste wasn't bad at all. I think the issue was, my mouth expected there to be more of a hot and seasoned flavor, and there wasn't, so my brain was very confused. Not my cup of tea, (or should I say cup of couscous) but I'm sure others would like it! I would suggest experimenting with different seasons to help bring another flavor to the plate.

This recipe was sent from the heavens. The angels sang in my mouth when I tasted it. Added smoked gruyere. Also used a palmetto cheese spread because I didnt have pimentos.

Substituted the heavy cream for low fat milk with a bit of cornstarch to thicken. Also added some paprika, saw some others did too and it was a great idea!! Delicious!

This makes a nice side dish.  I used roasted red peppers instead of the pimientos and scallions instead of the chives.  I also added about 1/2 tsp of garlic powder along with the roasted red peppers.  Will definitely make this again.

I will definitely make this again, and did two substitutions that I really liked. I used fat free Greek Yogurt in place of the cream and found it still rich, and substituted diced sweet hot cherry peppers  for the pimientos, which gave it just a little more kick.

Came out lovely. I used mozzarella instead of cheddar cheese because it's what I had on hand. I'm sure it would have been just as good if I had used cheddar though.  My son loved it.

It was bland and tasted a little like dirt. I added garlic and then it tasted like garlic flavored dirt. Don't waste your expensive Israeli couscous on this.

It's a nice meal for comfort, easy to see why kids would like it. I would probably do 1 1/2 cups chicken broth next time, it was a little too soupy.

The only change I made was to omit the pimientos.  I love them but my husband and daughter won't touch them so to keep the peace I left them out.  I have only recently discovered this type of couscous after spying it in the international foods section so I was so thankful to find this recipe.  It is truly delicious, fast, and so very easy!

This was a nice change of pace! Creamy and delish...would be great with a grilled steak. I added fresh diced tomato (instead of pimento) and parsley at the end too. Was a hit with the kids also!
