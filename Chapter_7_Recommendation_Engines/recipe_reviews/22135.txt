I don't generally like bread pudding. I certainly have never made bread pudding. I was curious and made this on a whim. I will never be the same... this was amazing... the most tasty dessert I have ever had. I was so proud of myself. Ha! Thank you for submitting, you've made me a bread pudding fan!

Very good. I did make it without the crust, this is more like a cake than a pie.

This is an excellent recipe.  Very different twist on apple pie.  I used cinnamon raisin bread instead of plain bread and it is delicious.  Nice and moist and very tasty.  Very easy to make too.  Will definitely keep this one.

I made this for Thanksgiving.  It was a hit.  I followed the recipe using Granny Smith apples and for the bread I used Hawaiian bread...mmmmmm.  Thanks for a great recipe.

No need to put into a pie shell.  It's just as good without and reduces the fat/calories.

I have to admit that I was a little skeptical of this recipe.  It was intriguing however because of the combination of apple pie and bread pudding.  Two desserts that I enjoy greatly.  I used cinnamon apple sauce and added 1/8 tsp. allspice.  It was very good.  Different because it is more firm like a previous review mentioned, firmer.  But still very tasty.  I made the crust from this site and it was a great compliment.  I used Grandma's Secret Pie Crust recipe.

I made this recipe without the crust b/c I didn't have one and didn't want to put time into making one, so I just greased w/butter a 9 inch pie pan. I only had wheat bread on hand, it worked beautifully. I used 4 slices and 3 apples. Easy, fast and YUM!

I have made this pie on a few occasions.  In fact I making a couple of them tomorrow for the 4th.  Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.  
One time I exchanged the apples for peaches, and used peach flavored applesauce and it was very tasty.

DYNAMITE! The crispy brown sugar topping provides an excellent contrast to the soft, gooey filling. I'm not usually one to nick someone else's recipe, but, my girlfriend wanted to try this one straight up. It was great. It's very rich, so, those of you who do silly things like put cheese on apple pie and want toned down sweetness, pass on this one. But, for people who like good food, this is at least worth making once.

This is very good.  I used whole wheat bread to add nutrition..and I drizzled my homemade caramel sauce on top after taking it from the oven..family and friends had nothing but nice things to say.

Delicious!  As others said, I needed to use a loaf of bread and some apples before they went bad.  I didn't have applesauce, so I added a little milk instead (like regular bread pudding).  To keep it healthier, I didn't do the topping or the crust.  That way it's more like a breakfast bake that's healthy and filling.  I would probably throw in a little salt next time.

This recipe is flawless. I'm a newlywed who pretend she can cook/bake and it was a breeze! I've never made pie or bread pudding and this was easy. My family loved it at Christmas. My only change was that I forgot the oats but it tastes fine without.

What a great dessert to make with what is always on hand in the fall-apples! I added a dash of salt to the filling, used 6oz. of vanilla yogurt, 5 slices of whole wheat bread cubed, and 3 small gala apples.  Skip the crust, it is unnecessary, just butter a 9x9 pyrex pan.  I placed a cookie sheet under my pan in the oven to catch the filling spills. Super recipe and so easy. thanks!

Didn't use a crust. Used 3 granny smith apples and 3.5 pieces of whole wheat bread, lightly toasted. Also, added 1/8 tsp allspice as someone suggested. Last, I only used half the sugar, knowing it would be significantly less sweet, but wanting to try it, in hopes of being healthier; an experiment. Results - Not sweet enough for a dessert, alone, but with a little ice cream on top, perfect. You may think that defeats the purpose, but the alternative, full sugar would be much worse! Here's the best part though - can have it for breakfast and not feel guilty at all. I did it w/a few spoonfuls of plain yogurt on top. Excellent texture. Delicious. Might try with chopped toasted walnuts next time or some ground flax to add a contrasting texture. Yummy though, just as it is.

This is one of the best pies I have ever made and I go out of my way to make as many pies as possible. Moist and rich in flavor with no flavor being too overpowering. Goes well with vanilla ice cream. I highly recommend this!

Marvelous, even without the crust. I used fruit and berry rye bread and added a bit of cinnamon to the crumble topping. It turned out to be very similar to a coffee cake. For a drier, firmer texture, I would use only one apple or maybe a bit less yogurt or applesauce.

made this exactly as in the recipe, except baked in a 8x8 metal pan (so no crust).  It was great!  a bit sweet, so next time I think I will try rhubarb instead, or cut the sugar back some.  Stored leftovers in fridge, they kept fine.  Good with cool whip or ice cream.

I love this pie. I made it for my family and they can't stop talking about it. I have to make it all the time for them. It's fairly easy and is the best tasting apple pie I have ever made.

This is delicious!  The second time I made it with two eggs and replaced the third with milled flax seed/water.  This didn't seem to change the flavor.  I would also like to try to reduce the sugar.  Totally worth making, though. Yum!

I'd probably give this a 4.5 stars in reality. But it's a really delicious dessert! I used a shop-bought pie crust, and it didn't cook completely unfortunately, so if I made it again, I might try partially cooking it first. But the filling and topping was really good. The bread pretty much melted and my son who doesn't like normal bread pudding loved this one.

Very tasty although I made it low fat.  I didn't use a crust and just put into an 8x12 casserole dish.  Used egg substitute and only had plain yogurt so added some vanilla.  Very good!  I think I'll try half splenda and half sugar next time to lower the calories even more.  Thanks for posting this good recipe.

Really great!  I made for my dad who is like the picky-est bread pudding fan, and I was afraid he wouldn't like it, but it was a hit. He just kept asking for MORE! I made my own applesauce, which was really easy-just cut and peel about 3-4 small apples, cook them in a pot with a little water. Add a little cinnamon at the end and ta-da! I will definitely make this again (and again and again).

This is a great recipe!  I had two leftover apples I didn't want to eat so I made this bread pudding pie with them.  I'd read the other reviews before making it, and here's what I did:  I made my own bread cubes using whole grain wheat bread (toasted, buttered, then torn up).  I also made it using a glass pie pan with a crust, just as the recipe called for.  It's great for breakfast too!

I think I liked it more than my husband did, but he is so used to my crispy apple crisp.  It was a bit mushy and wasn't the best the day after.  I may make this again because it was very easy.

This was pretty good.. a little dry so I recommend adding a little water or something to moisten it up.  Tasted very different from plain apple pie so it puts a nice twist on the every day apple pie.

This was fun to try.  It was good fresh out of the oven.  Didn't fair as well after a few days.  Will probably make again.

This recipe caught my eye, loving bread pudding and apple pie.  It is great, followed recipe exactly except used 4 cups of bread. i used my bread machine and made my own raisin cinnamon (and walnut) bread. This is bread pudding for the 21st century.  Served with store bought butterscotch topping. Five star all the way.!!

Amazing!!! Ok well ive never eaten nor made bread pudding, but this was a great start. I cut the recipe in half just to try it and see if I would actually like it. So I used just one egg and a little less then what half recipe called for. I thought it was a little too sweet so I will probably cut the sugar a little when making again. I used wheat bread and plain yogurt and added vanilla. Great recipe for on hand items!!!! THANK YOU SOOO MUCH!!! will be making again soon. Quick and easy!!1

This pie is FANTASTIC!!!  The only change I made was by mistake and I put rolled oats on the top instead of flour. But I will make it right next time, I'm sure it will even be better.  THANK YOU

Like another reviewer, I used cinnamon raisin bread.  I so wanted to love this pie, but didn't.  It is missing something.  I'm going to try again and add two tsp of vanilla and a dash of nutmeg.  Maybe serve with vanilla sauce or whiskey sauce.  It was better the second day.  I served it with carmel sauce.

This was delicious the day I made it.  I would recommend a different recipe though, if it isn't all to be eaten in one day.  It separated and became mushy.  YUM!

This is fantastic pie.  I used half french bread cubes and half krispie cream donut cubes.  WOW!!!  This is a pie that you can't wait to bite into.  There is a different taste every bite!  Can't wait to make it again.

This recipe is awesome! I got major "brownie" points, I used fresh italian bread cubes.
I think warm caramel sauce or vanilla ice cream would be wonderful on it. We used Cool Whip.

My husband LOVES this pie!!! He says it is his favorite apple pie! I do add some more apples and cut back the sugar a little, but a very tried and true recipe! I have made it many times!

I didn't use a crust as I didn't think it was necessary.  I substituted sour cream sweetened with a little sugar for the yogurt as I didn't have yogurt.  It was delicious!

This was a very unique recipe combining bread pudding and apple pie.  It was very tasty.  I will definitely make it again.
