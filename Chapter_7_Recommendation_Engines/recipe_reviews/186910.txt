Good, but the sugar needs to be reduced to 3 tablespoons, and I prefer brown to white.

These were very good.   Exactly what I expected.  Sweet and tangy.  I will make them again and expirament a bit by using brown sugar instead of white.  I did bake them quite a bit longer because I wanted the sauce to get extra thick.  Next time I will either use a little more corn starch or a little less water to get the sauce to more of a glaze consistency quicker.  My 15mo old loved them as well.  I used another meatball recipe from this website so that the meatballs weren't just plain hamburger...

VERY sweet...I used half the sugar required and it was still a bit too much sweetness. But, a very easy-to-make recipe and an interesting variation to the usual sweet/sour or regular meatball.

Yummy! Loved how the tops of the meatballs turned golden brown in the oven - I made sure to drench them in sauce every few mintues so the tops didn't dry out. Added just a bit of honey as well to my sauce for added thickness...very good, will make again! Thanks!

I will be cooking this for the second time this evening, my 3 year old couldn't get enough and she is a infuriatingly picky eater. Only 1 change, and I did this the first time: replace the soy sauce with balsamic vinegar.

I'm glad I read the other reviews, as I'm pretty sure it would have been WAY too sweet if I'd put all that sugar in it!  I reduced the sugar to 2 tbsp and used dark brown sugar.  I subbed flour for cornstarch just because I didn't have any cornstarch, and I used apple cider vinegar for "vinegar."  I threw Ikea frozen meatballs in it and baked them for about 20 minutes at 450 (although I probably could have done 15 if my oven told me when it was preheated).  It was the perfect amount of sauce for 1 bag of Ikea meatballs.  :)  This recipe was really a great jumping off point, though!  I think that the soy sauce, mustard, apple cider vinegar, and dark brown sugar really made it.  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm the writer of this recipe and I just wanted to share that I do mix my meatballs as I would regularly, with onion, garlic, salt/pepper, an egg, and oatmeal. Sorry for the confusion, thanks for the compliments!

Great recipe for sure! I did alter it just a bit though... I followed the other reviews and added about a 1/4 C of brown sugar and that worked great.  I used apple cider vinegar and I did add just a little seasoned salt to the meat. Oh, and I used buffalo meat instead of ground beef and that worked out great, too.  I noticed I omitted the salt-- didn't need any, I thought! And I did add about 1/2 C of instant wild rice to the meat as well.   My 2 1/2 year old son loved them- wanted more! Will definitely make again. :D

My husband and kids could not get enough of this! It was great. I was in a hurry and used frozen meatballs--still turned out great. I also used brown sugar instead of white. Will definately make again.

My family loved these meatballs!  I even had requests to make them twice in the same week.  I had read the reviews and cut back on the sugar, but other than that followed the recipe.  Great recipe, thanks!!

Yummy!!   I was tempted to add some onions or bread crumbs or something to the meat as I was mixing it up into balls, but in the interest of keeping some semblence of this recipe, I refrained. :)   Per other reviews, I only used 1/4 cup sugar.  I left out the soy sauce and mustard powder, and instead added 1/4 cup BBQ sauce along with 1/4 cup ketchup.  I also used red wine vinegar.   This was really good!  :)  I will be keeping this recipe!

The recipe is easy and the sauce really is tasty. The only problem is that the flavors don't penetrate the meat. The result is that instead of what most people think of as a meatball, you get a ball of meat. A ball of meat with a tasty coating, but still not really a meat ball. To drastically improve it, I'd keep the sauce the same but mix some breadcrumbs and spices into the meat before forming the balls. But the sauce is definitely a keeper!

These are delicious, but definitely cut back on the sugar unless you have a sweet tooth.  I used brown sugar.  Easy weeknight dinner with veggies and rice.  Make sure your meatballs are close in size for even cooking.

I get lots of compliments on this recipe.  The sauce is yummy!  I use a bag of frozen meatballs as a shortcut and place them in a slow cooker with the sauce.  Thanks for sharing!

I made my own meatballs (a family recipe), the sauce was simply delicious! I had to make a few slight modifications due to lack of ingredients. I substituted flour for cornstarch and used a bit of BBQ sauce to make up for the ketchup that i was missing. I found the sauce cooked down quite a bit, not leaving enough to put on the rice i served with the meatballs (however this could have been due to my substitutions). Other than that a great recipe, that i will be making again!

My family loved them. The only change I made was I used "Mr.Yoshida's Marinade & Cooking Sauce  Original Gourmet Sweet & Savory" because I didn't have any soy sauce.

My husband and son like these but not that much. They weren't interested in the leftovers at all.  I think it's a matter of personal taste.

I love this recipe! It's exactly what I was looking for. I have a son who usually hates meatballs but loves these ones. I did use frozen meatballs instead of making my own and threw them in the crockpot and poured a double recipe of the sauce over them, set it on high for 4 hours and they came out perfect. The second time I made them I added 1/4 cup Sutter Home Sweet Red Wine and an extra tablespoon of cornstarch and cooked them the same way as the first time and again they were great! The sauce really is a great base that you can add to or great by itself. Thanks for sharing it with everyone.

This was great!  I took the others opinons and used 3T of brown sugar instead of what the recipe called for.  My boys (8 & 6) both really liked it.  My oldest, who is especially picky even asked for seconds! My husband thought it was great too!  I will be making this one again, for sure!

I had made some burgers the other night and had leftover seasoned hamburger. I rolled them into little balls and seared them off. I used beer instead of the water and simmered the sauce with the balls. I served them over white rice. Really Yummy! These would make a Wonderful appy with a fancy toothpick in it. Thanks Melissa. delish!

WOW! I have never seen my little ones so excited about ground beef! I made mini-meatballs and stuck a toothpick in each. No fork necessary! I didn't have dry mustard powder. I just used regular mustard and they were FANTASTIC. Even my husband, who typically doesn't like "sweet meat" gobbled them up. I have already made them a second time. These will be in regular rotation at our house. Thank you for posting!

Looked this up on a whim and had it ready in an hour. Was really happy with it! Was easy to put together and tasted pretty good too. Sauce was a bit runnier than I expected but was still quite good over rice. I'll make it again for sure.

This was a pretty good basic recipe, however I did change a few things.  I used 1 lb ground beef, 1 lb ground turkey, added 1 cup seasoned bread crumbs, 1 envelope of onion soup mix, & a bit of rosemary.  I made 12 large meatballs that fit in a 13x9 baking pan, I did not brown these in a skillet but rather put them in the oven for 12 minutes to brown up before adding the sauce. For the sauce I also changed a few things to taste 1/4 c. brown sugar, 1 tbls apple cider vinegar, and only 1 tbls soy sauce, the rest of the ingredients stayed the same.  All in all excellent..and I'll certainly make them again. Even though I made my own changes to the recipe I still feel it justified the 4 stars because it's simple and gives you basics to tweak it to your own taste.

Good once I added ginger and honey.  Substituted brown sugar  for white sugar, and tomato juice for 1/2 of the ketchup.

Very good for a different spin than my usual meatballs. It was sweet, but it was good. I’ll make this again.

Enjoyed this easy meal.  Thank you for the recipe.  I used ground pork and ground beef that I had left after making meatloaf.

Very tasty and quick. Had it with noodles the first time and will make more sauce to have with the leftover meatballs and serve with rice this time.

Not often I find a recipe my whole family will eat. Definitely a keeper and will be making this again. Can also be used from frozen meatballs if you are strapped for time.

I've made this recipe quite a few times and it's a hit everytime I make it. I follow the recipe for the sauce almost exactly... I only use about 1-2 tbsp of sugar instead of what it calls for and it's absolutely perfect! Also, before I roll the meat into balls, I add onion powder, garlic powder and a small amount of ketchup to the meat. I highly recommend this recipe... it's totally worth the time :)

I read other reviewers and followed some suggestions - I halved the sugar and put in a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar instead of a teaspoon. It was really great! I will be trying it with chicken. Thank-you for an easy recipe with ingredients I always have on hand. ??

These were so easy to make, I had everything here already, and the flavor was great. Why only 4 stars instead of 5? I had one person out of our family of four that thought they were just okay. I am definitely making these again.

Sooo delicious. Thanks to other cooks I made the following (minor) changes: I used a couple of tbsp of brown sugar instead of the white, and I added seasonings to the meatballs before cooking. Fantastic recipe!

I made this recipe as is. I browned the outside of the meatball as called for. However, when I pulled the meatballs out of the oven I was disappointed to see that the sauce had been completely diluted by the fat from the meatballs and it was a greasy runny mess! I think it is best to cook the meatballs and sauce separately and pour the sauce over the meatballs. It's probably also best to add some bread crumbs egg and spices into the ball, or it's just rolled up ground beef. So sorry, but I was not happy with the outcome, was expect something much different!

I made this recipe last night. Everyone loved it, there were no leftovers (unfortunately!). ??  I made one change; I reduced the amount of sugar to a heaping 1/4 cup of Brown sugar. The ketchup already makes it sweet in my opinion.  I served the meatballs over jasmine rice and veggie  eggroll.  Enjoy!

Excellent recipe and turned out to  be absolutely delicious! Though I made few modifications: I didn't have ketchup, so I substituted it with salsa, tomato paste and barbecue souce; instead of dry mustard I used dijon. Thanks for a great idea for a tasty lunch.

I used frozen IKEA meatballs and they worked excellently. I wish I'd read the reviews though as this was very sweet. Would be fantastic as cocktail meatballs but was a bit overpowering for dinner. Kids loved them!

I've made these 3 times since I found this recipe 3 weeks ago.  My hubby, 5-yr old and even picky 3-yr old all love them.  The sauce is perfect for serving with rice.  I made the meatballs very small, so the flavour seems to penetrate right through the meat making them super soft, not "hamburgery".  Super easy and so good!

Very good!  I had 2# ground veal (on sale) so I used that, and scaled the serving sizes up.  I made as directed except used only 3 T brown sugar instead of white sugar, as several others suggested.  I probably could have left out the salt too but it was fine as is.  Served with rice - very yummy.

I made these with 1 lb ground beef and 1/2 lb ground sausage. I had to sub flour for cornstarch, used 2 tbsp of brown sugar in place of white sugar. The flavor was great. My only issue was there was not enough sauce. I think next time I will double the sauce. I will surely be making these again.

Excellent recipe.  As mentioned by several people, it was very sweet, but we liked it just fine.  I made these meatballs and sauce for myself and my son - and just the sauce over Morning Star veggie meatballs for my vegetarian man and he liked it as well.  Sauce thickened well, served over brown rice.

These meatballs were so yummy.  My family didn't think the sauce was too sweet like some others.  I liked how the soy sauce didn't over power the recipe.  It was a favorite at our table.

Pretty tasty!  I followed the recipe except for using prepared mustard instead of dry and I added a healthy dose (around a tsp) of freshly ground black pepper.  The consistency of the sauce of "just right" after 30 minutes.  The next time, though, I think I'll just pour the sauce over the meatballs in the frying pan (after browning them) as that saves having to clean a 2nd pot.  Of course, that would mean they're no longer "oven" meatballs!  LOL!  Anyway, it turned out quite well... thanks for sharing!
