Everyone I've made this dessert for has loved it, they don't even realize that they're eating a much healthier dessert than usual! I usually make half of the recipe in a pie pan, which means half the phyllo dough, and I fold over all the edges to make a strange looking little tart thing. Strange, but delicious! I only use egg whites and not a whole egg, and I use light cream cheese. I usually top half with fresh chopped strawberries and the other half with raspberries/blackberries and blueberries, so people can choose whichever they like better. And I use spray Crisco butter instead of brushing the sheets with butter, much faster and lighter this way! I top it with powdered sugar after it's finished baking. Mmm!

This pie was good- the crust was a little too insubstantial to accomodate all the filling, so it often fell apart when serving- be sure to cool completely before serving, as per instructions, but even this doesn't prevent accidents! I made my own apple filling, and I used about half the cream cheese and it was fine.  I also spread a bit of melted butter on top of the pie before baking and sprinkled it with suger and cinnamon to make a nice taste.  Next time I will probably sprinkle this mixture in between some of the layers of the crust, too, to make it a little more flavorful. On the whole, tasty and unique, but not amazing.

Delicious! I used blueberry pie filling and non-fat cream cheese as well as more phyllo dough on the bottom and top. My family ate this one up in one night.

It was really good!!!  Definitely a solid 4 stars (if I could give it 4 1/2, I would!!  I used blueberry pie filling, but otherwise followed the recipe.  The only change I would make would be to either make the crust on top thicker, or leave it off entirely.

Very good, the Phyllo crust is time consuming, would make again with a normal crust.

Recieved absolutely rave reviews, though I myself wasn't as crazy about it. I used blueberry pie filling. The cream cheese mix was very delicious, but I think I might have done better using a different filling. It definitely wasn't your traditional pie, and you shouldn't expect it to act exactly like one. It was very tasty though, and easy for what it was. My mom said it might have been the best thing she ever had, though that might have been heat of the moment reviewing.

This worked out great.  Instead of pie filling, I used sliced strawberries lightly dusted with sugar.

This pie was ok. I was not crazy about it, neither were my kids. I also think that this would have been much better with a real pie crust. The pie fell apart and the crust was just not enough for us. I used berries instead of apples and they did taste good but IF I made this again I would use a different crust. The phyllo was not that easy to work with but you do get the hang of it. Just remember the damp towel so it does not dry out. I just do not see me making this again. My kids did have fun with the phyllo though.

Very good!  I used splenda instead of sugar and butter cooking spray instead of butter. For the fruit I used peaches. My husband went back for thirds.

The cream cheese filling would be better with the addition of sour cream. I didn't care for this warm; it was better after it chilled. I won't be making it again.

The filling was great with the cream cheese  apples. But I think it would be better with an old fashion pie crust.

My hubby and  one son gave this recipe a seven out of ten, and one son couldn't bring himself to try it. I thought it was very good, and I think I'll try it again with berries instead of apples.
