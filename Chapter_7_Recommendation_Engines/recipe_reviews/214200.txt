Great recipe. I made a few modifications: I recommend making sure you use stout, since the tab thing in the draft can change the soup a bit. Also, since the beer can leave a bit of a bitter aftertaste, throw in some finely chopped prunes (about 1/4 cup or less); they will dissolve but will take away the bitterness and add another layer to the stew.

If you are using Guinness or any other beer it is not gluten free, because beer is made with barley, a grain that contains gluten. I made this using gluten free Redbridge beer (made with surghum) and cut the garlic down to 2 cloves. I served it with gluten free biscuits from Glutino.

Made the way te recipe is written using carrots and potatoes - yields a very tasty beef stew which I thicken with a little flour and water, if needed.

I made this recepie for St. Patty's party I hosted. It came out quite well. I did change it up a bit because I did not have all the ingredients. I used two potatoes and 2 sweet potatoes and added extra carrots and celery to add a bit more color.  I also added beef broth.  It came out more like a soup but It was delish.  The guiness gave it a kick!! I guess it did not taste too bitter because of the sweet potatoes!

I've made this twice before, and am embarking on my third pot! I adore it! The first two times, I've followed the recipe exactly. This time, I've add a bit more meat and potatoes and some carrots, just to see how it would taste... I had to add in a little bit of beef broth to cover everything. But wow is it fantastic! This is a certified hit in our house. Especially with a homemade loaf of country bread to clean the bowls with!

To me the stout did make it quite bitter. I made my stew in a slow-cooker. My husband likes just about anything and he did not care for this. Sadly, I will not be making this again. At least not with the stout.

Thanks... this beginner (used to be a full time working mom, now a stay home mom) is learning to love my slow cooker.  I tried this recipe and it was a BIG hit! Mixed in sweet potatoes and added a lot of beef bullion and a pinch of flour to thicken.  Used Guinness Draught beer... got a thumbs up from the hubby!!

I tried this recipe because I love the Guinness stew at a local Irish pub.  This was a good substitute, just not as good as I am used too.  I will probably make it again, just not when the teens will be home, they didn't care for it much, but what do they know about good food.

Made it in the slow cooker and was VERY bitter.  Cut with beef broth, then balanced with salt, lemon and sugar (I like the minced prunes idea someone else had) and it became OUTRAGEOUSLY delicious.  Going to try it on the stove next time.

The problem may be that like KerryB, I made it on low in my slow cooker, which did not get hot enough to really cook off the alcohol or take away the bitterness of the Guinness. (The meat is quite good.)  I like Guinness, but it tastes as if the stout has gone slightly off.  If I try this again, I won't do it in the slow-cooker so that the alcohol is cooked off -- It's definitely different getting a buzz from a bowl of stew.

Came out rich hearty and then I drank the remaining bottles of Guinness.  The meat was tender and the flavor was cooked through nicely.  You couldn't taste much of the bacon, but the stout flavor was there for sure.  I put it the slow cooker.  It was ready in no time.

This recipe as written was a disappointment. Potatos were way overcooked - should not be added until later - maybe an hour. Taste was too bitter.  Needed something to sweeten it or maybe use half Guinness and half beef broth. As it was the amount of liquid was not enough to cover the meat and potatos. Had to add extra. I may experiment or I may look for a different recipe.

I would say a *6* star for our St. Patrick's meal. I substituted beef for cubed elk. I dredged the elk in flour and sauteed. Then I sauteed the garlic and onion once they were cooked. I added Beef broth. I cooked in the slow cooker. 1st time making it....but it will not be the last time. All my guests seemed to enjoy the Guiness Stew. Delish :)

This turned out spectacularly.  I did add about 1/4 cup Merlot to it as it simmered, to add a depth to the flavor.  will definitely make this again... my husband loved it@

I loved this as a base recipe! I did alter it a bit. I added carrots and beef broth. I also added three bullion cubes. It came out great! Next time I'm going to wait an hour before I add the potatoes. They kinda got mushy and dissolved a bit. And I'm also going to add more potatoes.

It's a great simple, consistent, comforting recipe. I know the difference in my Guinness' also so no prob.  Tend to use less potatoes but load up on peppers and mushrooms.

It was tasty and very easy. I added 3 carrots along with the potatoes. Also, I garnished it with shredded sharp cheddar and a splash of Tabasco because in Southern California, even my beef stew has to be spicy.

Great recipe. I made a few small changes. I used a Oatmeal Stout to avoid the bitterness of Guinness, used potato, parsnips, carrots, and sage.   Came out tasting amazing.
