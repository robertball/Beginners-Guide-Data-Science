Great veggie quesadilla! I used Hellman's light mayo and added in a little spinach and roasted red pepper for a little added color and flavor - YUM! Perfect with a side of homemade salsa and some sour cream!

This is a wonderful meatless meal.  So easy to do, it would be good for a quck meal as I have the ingredients on hand most of the time.  I made it according to the recipe and here is how I would tweak it going forward:  Cut back on the mayonaise and omit the jalapeno.  Both are personal preferences and I won't count it down because of that.  I will make again and again.

Yummy, these quesadillas were so good! At first I thought the addition of the mayonnaise was a little odd, and thought they might be better with sour cream instead, but I stuck with the mayo and I'm glad I did. Turned out great to add to the mushroom/onion/pepper combo to make the ingredients really come together. My whole family loved it and said that I could make them again sometime. This was very quick and easy too, which makes them even better.

Oh, YUM, these were really, REALLY good! I used Hellmann's Light Mayo, because that's all I buy, whole wheat tortillas and a combination of cheeses that I had on hand. Also, I always bake my quesidillas, so I did that. I could totally see even maybe adding spinach to these, but they were absolutely DELICIOUS as is. I will be making this A LOT! Thanks for sharing. :)
