I have to admit, I'm shocked to be giving this 5 stars!  I'm not a sausage fan and was reluctant to try this, but decided to give it a shot based on the ease of preparation and other reviews.  It was ready in less than 15 minutes, from start to plating AND I went back for more.  I did use the sweet sausage, as it's what I had on hand, and used 2 links, rather than the whole package (though, Mr. LTH said he would have liked more).  You really can't go wrong w/this for a last minute weeknight meal.  THANKS, Johnsonville!

This is a great busy weekday meal!  We love anything with Johnsonville Italian Sausage, and this did not disappoint.  I thought that it seemed like a lot of water, but it turned out great!

Amazing! My motto is, "Think like a lazy man, you'll get the job done easier." This recipe is easy and another, "Why didn't I think of that method of cooking spaghetti?" As I made this I'm thinking it's going to be soup! Not! It's too good to be true. I use a 26.5oz can of plain traditional spaghetti sauce and the sausage delivered the rest of the flavor. Come on I dare you to try this. It's so easy to make for those lazy days and turns out perfect. A keeper for sure.

This was AMAZING! You'd never guess it only had four ingredients, and one of those is water! I don't care for a lot of ground meat in dishes, so I doubled everything except the sausage and there was still plenty of meat to be satisfying. This will definitely be repeated in our home on a regular basis!

Love this recipe. Have been making variations of this "helper meal" for some time but have never tried the sausage before. Nice starting point for adding more veges, adjust liquids as needed.

There aren't very many recipes that are flavorful, fast, and easy cleanup, this recipe is the complete package. I was skeptical that we would enjoy this being from a homemade meatball and sauce kind of household. The kids asked for seconds and wanted it again the next day for lunch. It is very flavorful with minimal work, and the items are always in my freezer or pantry. This will be a new go to recipe on those nights I just don't feel like cooking.

I've been cooking for years, and spaghetti is my usual "I need something quick and easy for a weeknight because I'm exhausted" dish. I just HATE the clean up afterwards. I can smack myself now because this is genius! I mean, why haven't I thought of this years ago!? I seasoned the sauce to my liking, and the Italian sausage was a new twist! I usually just use ground beef, but the sausage adds more flavor (I used mild ground Italian from Johnsonville). My family loved it, and my toddler had seconds. I paired it with garlic cheese fries, because I did not feel like making garlic bread. YUM!! Only one dish too! What's not to love?!?!

It had a gluey consistency because of cooking the pasta in with the sauce and water.  It felt like I was eating red wallpaper paste with dots of sausage thrown in.  I added a little more water and sauce to try to loosen things up more but this dish just didn't work for me.

It was very simple and easy. I did add one whole box of spaghetti so I had to add more water to make sure it was done. I think this will be the way I'll cook my spaghetti in the future.

I have to admit I was really skeptical of this recipe, but after reading all the amazing reviews, I had to try it for myself! I used the Chicken & Pork lower fat sausage and a good quality jarred sauce which brought the calories down to 440 and the fat down to 21g.  This recipe will only be as good as the sauce you use, so make sure not to skimp!  I thought 3 cups of water would be way too much. It's wasn't til the end of the cooking time that it really thickened up nicely. I had to cook everything for an extra 4 mins because I was using whole wheat spaghetti, and by that time enough of the extra liquid had evaporated to the perfect consistency. Such a quick meal, and yummy too! I can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch today!

This was AMAZING, FAST, and DELICIOUS!  This is a major, major keeper - great for families in a hurry to sit down and enjoy a nice dinner together.  Add some garlic bread and salad, and you're good to go!

Simple and Easy! I used the ground sausage and a full box of thin spaghetti and it worked perfectly. My kids devoured this. Even my oldest who hates sauce on spaghetti!

Five stars all the way! I really didn't think this would turn out like all the reviews said. I was dead wrong, this is so easy and the taste was out of this world for such an easy recipe. I will make this again and again,

So easy to cook the pasta in the sauce. It does make for a slightly watery sauce so I cooked it a bit longer to thicken it. Will remember this technique for the future. Also would recommend buying ground sausage. The links don't break up as well when removed from the casings and cooked.

I have to admit I was skeptical, but this works!  I used 3 cheese sauce and hot Italian sausage.  Since I scaled this to 2 servings I wasn't sure there would be enough water, but it worked out fine.  I did use angel hair pasta rather than regular spaghetti so I watched it closely.  It still amazes me that such small effort yields such good food.  Thanks, Johnsonville Kitchen!

Another Johnsonville hit for us!  I made as directed, using Hunts Four Cheese canned sauce and Johnsonville Mild Italian Sausage.  I did add about 1/2 cup more water while everything was simmering, as it seemed to be drier than I liked.  We were very happy with the results!

What a terrific discovery this was. This is a boon for anyone who wants to get dinner on the table in a hurry with tasty results. I reserved one sausage for the top of my meat loving husband pasta. Very nice! Thanks for sharing!

This was really good and really simple.  It hit the spot after a long day at work, without having to stress over making a good dinner.  I used the Johnsonville chicken & pork mild Italian sausage, which is lower in fat, and followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  I was worried about all that water, but it cooked down nicely  and looked just like photo #1. It was thick and nice, not soupy at all! Topped with a little parmesan and a small side salad, this dish is tasty and satisfying without being labor-intensive.  Super recipe!

We love spaghetti with hamburger meat. My boyfriend also tends to hate trying anything new but he liked this. It'll definitely become a regular. We'll alternate sausage and ground beef so it doesn't get boring. Might even try it with both!

I MADE IT WITH CARAMELISED ONION SAUSAGES AND LLOYD GROSSMAN BASIL TOMATO SAUCE. I USED PASTA TWISTS AND I ADDED A FEW ROASTED PEPPERS FROM A JAR. KIDS WANTED MORE.

This was excellent.  The only change I made was to use 8 ounces of Italian sausage and already cut pasta.  Update - January 2016, used 8 ounces of Italian sausage and reduced servings to 3.  Still delicious.

This gets five stars just for ease alone and it was really good too. I may have overcooked it a bit just so the sauce could thicken up a bit. My husband said he would have preferred his pasta a little more al dente. Didn't keep him from having two helpings and taking the leftovers to work tomorrow. Yummy and easy peasy!

This is a great recipe, especially for busy week nights! It is simple but it tastes so good! I think the sausage really adds that extra touch to help elavate this dish up from regular spaghetti.

FANTASTIC!!!!! I am not a sausage fan, was somewhat reluctant to try but did.  Wow!!!  Did not even have to drain the sausage, not even a tsp of fat comes off the sausage.  Used hot Italian sausage, with Hunts spicy and zesty sauce. Sauce not watery at all.  Followed the directions and wow!!!  We loved it.  So easy to make, one pot does it all!!!! Great for pot lucks as well, just double up on the ingredients!!!!

Gah! How easy is this? I never ever thought to make spaghetti this way. Turned out perfect. I used ground Johnsonville Italian sausage instead of trying to decase links. Great recipe!

Awesome!  It's crazy that this actually works!   I have been cooking for 45+ years and I have never made spaghetti like this before.  I honestly didn't believe this would work, let alone taste good.   Boy was I ever wrong!   This is so easy and tastes AMAZING!  Thanks Johnsonville!

This was a great recipe. I thought I'd love to try a new sauce with this - huge mistake. The sauce was horrible and ruined the whole dish. Since that was on me, I re-made it with a sauce we like and it definitely made the dish 100 times better. It tells you 'your favorite pasta sauce' for a reason! Would recommend to anyone, super fast and delicious meal :)

I was running behind and looking for a quick meal. With only 4 ingredients (one was water), it came together fast and effortlessly! That's my kind of meal! :)

This is the second time I've made this spaghetti recipe.  It is downright delicious, and the only "change" I made was to garnish with some freshly shredded parmesan cheese.  I prefer using the Bertolli Cabernet Sauvignon sauce with this recipe (if I don't have time to make fresh sauce).  Absolutely a winner from Johnsonville!

This was so easy, I was expecting a clumpy mess of spaghetti... Man was I WRONG! This was so great I made mini meatballs with the ground sausage. I added nothing to the meat just made little balls and browned. Then added 2 1/2 cups water (I like my pasta andante), pasta, sauce and mushroom pieces and half a med. onion. This was so full of flavor I can see me making my spaghetti like this from now on. Totally worthy of 5 stars!!!!

Dear One Pot Meal, Where have you been all my life??? But seriously, the ease of this dish was fantastic. The Johnsonville sausage added great flavor to this spaghetti. I will be making this again! Thank you Johnsonville for a great recipe!

This is delicious, especially when the amount of time and effort to make it is considered! A tip I learned from Johnsonville, to de-case the sausage, run a knife from the top to bottom of each sausage. I don't typically buy pasta sauce in a jar. My go to recipe is best marinara sauce from this site. I wanted to follow the recipe, so I searched for a jarred marinara that looked close to what I typically make. I used Victorio brand Old World Style marinara. I then added the 3 cups of water with about 2 oz extra water to make up for the shortage in the jar. I also saw the store now carries pot sized spaghetti, already broke in half, so I went with that. When it was done I tasted it, but felt like it needed something. I sprinkled a tiny amount of garlic salt into my bowl and then topped with some fresh grated parmesan. It did the trick. I would definitely consider this, if I have over-night guests. It's easy, filling, and I won't have to be in the kitchen washing a bunch of dishes all night.

This was pretty simple. Obviously, the sauce you use will make or break this, so be sure to use a good sauce.

Three things I love about this meal: It all cooks in 1 pan, it's ready and on the table in less than 30 minutes, and it uses Johnsonville Italian Sausage :) I was able to lower the calories to 449 calories per serving by using Prego Light Smart Traditional Italian Sauce and Ronzoni Smart Taste Thin Spaghetti. 1/5 of the entire recipe was a large serving size for me.

Oh yes, this is lazy cooking. If you're looking for a satisfying dish made with pantry staples... this is it. Johnsonville sausage freezes nicely and thaws quickly. Short on time? Try this one. (I used Barilla Campanelle pasta.)

Very easy and delicious meal!  I didn't have spaghetti noodles so I subbed linguini.  It look longer to cook because of this.  Next time I will definitely use spaghetti noodles though (I just have to make sure I have them in my pantry!).

This truly was wonderful. I almost screwed it up because I didn't read the recipe closely and made a whole pound of pasta.. but in the end it was saved by my pulling out half of it. The dish itself is so tasty (the sausage has so much flavor.. unbelievable!) and we also used Prego Traditional sauce. Thanks so much.. will make this again and again and again!!

Oh wow, this was great! I used Johnsonville's sweet Italian sausage, but I followed the recipe to the letter otherwise. It was really, really good! Perfect as-is, but I also prepared half of a batch of Johnsonville meatballs to serve along with it. This might be my new favorite way to make spaghetti from now on, especially on busy evenings!

This was super easy and made such an easy clean-up by using only one pan! What a clever idea to cook the pasta all in the same pan...I would have never thought to cook it this way. The spaghetti came out cooked perfectly. This is a perfect dish when you need to put dinner on the table in a hurry and with little work or clean up involved. This was a real winner! Thanks Johnsonville!
