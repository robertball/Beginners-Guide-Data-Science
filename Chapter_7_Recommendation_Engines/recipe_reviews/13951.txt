These are juicy and delicious. Refrigeration is very important to this recipe, as I found out to my chagrin the second time I made them. This recipe takes flavor additions very well - we have made it with minced jalapenos and onions, and with Cajun seasonings. I like it best served on a bun with lettuce leaves and slices of tomatoes, red onions and avocado, and sauteed mushrooms and Jack cheese melted on top.

I'm going to give this four stars, because this recipe prepared as a burger didn't impress me much, and I would have given it maybe one star, but I used the leftover mix (I didn't want to waste it)as a base for vegetarian wontons and it was FABULOUS. I added some onion, carrots, snowpeas, oyster sauce, ginger and a little flour and it made a wonderful filling. I took them to work and NOT ONE PERSON could tell they were meat free, and they were begging me for the recipe.

Be sure to dampen hands with cold water before handling mixture to prevent mixture for sticking to hands, very hard to remove from hands. 
Will add extra soy sauce and spices on next batch.

These are great!  I think they are some of the best veggie burgers I've had.  They can come out kind of dry, so they are good served with lots of mayo and mustard.  Also, I refrigerated the mix for a couple of days and it still turned out good.

These were so tasty, but I had trouble with them falling apart and being slightly dry. This may have been my fault for overcooking a bit or because I used less cashews and added some almond butter in place as that was all I had. The flavour was great though-I will make again. These seem to freeze well too.

Made these exactly as written and they are delicious!  Reminds me of Nature's Burgers I used to have when I was a kid.
These will definitely become a staple for when we are going veggie...or just as a lighter alternative to a regular burger.

These burgers were delicious!
I didn't have sunflower seeds so substituted some ground chick peas.  The flavour was really nice and they formed nice patty shapes.

Michael, I have been trying to find ways to substitute grains for meat and this recipe is perfect.  I was concerned that the burgers would give me trouble in the tin foil, so I decided to place my very large cast-iron skillet on my gas grill and use that to cook the burgers.  I also thought fresh pita bread would make a good substitute for buns in case the burgers fell apart.  With this approach I didn't even worry about making them into perfect burgers; instead, I just dropped clumps of the refrigerated mix onto the very well preheated skillet (with olive oil) and I also had a wood chip smoker box going to give a little mesquite smoked flavor to the burger clumps.  To dress the pita wraps, I chopped some fresh tomato and scallions and had wedges of lemon handy to squeeze onto the mix.  My wife added fresh spinach as well.  This is very healthy!  Thanks a million for this recipe.  The burgers are so delicious but subtle, so I don't recommend putting too much stuff on them.  I also found that this is  a very low-salt meal if you use the low-sodium soy sauce.  My only caveat is to not overprocess the nuts and seeds too much or you get peanut butter, which is very good, but not easy to remix into the bulgur.  Really wonderful.  Mike
