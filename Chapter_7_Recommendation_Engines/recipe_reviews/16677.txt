Finally!  After 30 years of many different oatmeal cookie recipes, I have hit upon one my husband really loves!  Oatmeal cookies have never been his favorite because he likes chewy--not cakelike, not crispy--CHEWY cookies!  He tentatively took one bite, then another and then started exclaiming, "These are really good!  Wow!  These are sooo good!"  They are easy to make (ended up with about 6 doz.), freeze very well, and above all, THEY ARE CHEWY!!

I added an extra cup of oatmeal (I used the slow cook kind) and switched out half of the raisins for dried cranberries.  I found the extra oatmeal made them chewier and not as crispy and flat.

Excellent cookies - great texture.  A couple people mentioned the cookie was "cakey".  They didn't follow the recipe then.  Follow the recipe precisely and you will get a chewy cookie on the inside, a little crisp on the out.  This includes the size in which you bake them in (teaspoon-size, no larger - they'll fan out as they cook).  

The flavor is outstanding.  This is a definitely a keeper.

Change Nothing. These are perfect. After 2 days baking, of all the cookies I made, (all 5 star recipes from here) I think this one was my personal favorite, and oatmeal is not my favorite cookies. It really did have a nice blend of sweet and savory, with a great texture.  Now that I think about it, they all were delicious.  Check your cook times, If you like a toasted crunchy flavor, bake a bit longer if you like a chewy cookie, bake a bit less and let cool on the pan. These ARE NOT "CAKEY Cookies"  Listen Reviewers.. if 100 people review something and say its a chewy cookie, and 5 say its a Cakey Cookie, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say, the 5 did something wrong or different.  So before I judge a cookie against the grain, I'm going to make doggone sure I'm not the one looking like an idiot. Which means DOUBLE checking my recipe. Did I put too much of one thing and not enough of another? Is my oven too hot or not hot enough? Do I need to adjust my cook times? Am I cooling this on the cookie sheets? Are my cookies more like plum sized rather than walnut sized?  I'm amazed by how many people can rate a cookie as awesome and then One reviewer comes in and bashes it and says something totally contrary to what everything else is saying, I know tastes are subjective, but texture? Not quite as much.   Bottom line, before you bash a DELICIOUS recipe. Take a second, perhaps the problem is not the recipe, but the cook.

I needed just a basic oatmeal cookie so I didn't include the raisins or nuts, and just added the egg to the creamed butter and sugar.  To tell you the truth, I was initially unimpressed with and concerned about the dough as it seemed dry and it was kind of difficult to incorporate the oatmeal thoroughly.  However... these are probably one of the best oatmeal cookies I've ever tried.  First of all, they bake up beautifully, and you'd be proud to put them on your serving plate.  I mean, they have a bakery look about them.  Secondly, and most important, they're just darn good!  Crispy on the edges, soft and chewy on the inside, pleasantly sweet with just a hint of cinnamon.  Excellent.

Yum yum! These oatmeal raisin nut cookies are chewy, moist and delicious. They are mouthwatering!

Some notes for those who like to experiment: I have made them with or without the nuts; they are excellent either way. Try dried cranberries for all or part of the raisins -- that gives it a nice tart sweetness, too. I have even made them with chocolate chips (skipping the "soaking" step) and that is top notch as well, if you have a big chocolate fan in your house.

The review below that suggests more raisins and more cinnamon might be on to something. But then I always think you can't have enough raisins and spice.

Excellent recipe!

Love this recipe.  I alter it a little by adding a little less rasins, substituting with semi-sweet dark chocolate chips.  I got the idea from a local bakery that made gigantic oatmeal/chocolate chip cookies.  I also bake mine a little longer as I like a crunchier cookie.  Thanks for sharing this!

The name of this recipe says it all!  These truly are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever eaten.  They are soooo chewy and practically melt in your mouth!  Not that they need any changing, but we added a "Brown Butter Frosting"* from Paula Deen to the tops and everyone raves about them.  I have make three batches already this weekend!  My hat is off to the creater of this recipe!  Keep them coming!

Finally.. An Oatmeal Cookie I can be proud to serve, deliciously chewy inside and crispy outside!  I did follow the changes suggested by other reviewers: chilled the egg/raisin/vanilla mixture overnight, used 3 cups of oats, added 1/8 tsp ground cloves and 1/8 tsp ground nutmeg for a more "old-fashioned" flavor.  I also lined my cookie sheets with parchment paper and alleviated the sticking problem. My husband loved them, thank you so much for sharing this recipe:)

Great cookies but they are cakey! The reason for this is the 2 tsp of baking soda! As we all know baking soda is a raising agent - hence a more cakey than flat, crispy cookie. Omitt or half the amount of baking soda for a flater, crispier and chewier cookie.

Good but tad sweet for my liking.
Two days later, made again but changed a fewthings. 1.5 cups of sugar, (white and brown combined), dash more cinnamon and to make tad softer, 1/4 cup more oats, and the cookies were perfect
9-8-12 update. I have tried other similar recipes, not one comes even close to this one. If you don't like raisins use dried cranberries.   Remember 1.5 cups combined white brown sugar is better.

Finally! I found the recipe for the oatmeal cookies I remember! Just a little crispy on the outside, and nice and chewy when you bite into them. I did the recipe a instructed, the only change being walnuts instead of pecans. My search is over.... these are exceptionally good. The dough is really stiff, and hard to work with, but the results make it worthwhile. I made small balls, about an inch around, and they flattened out into perfect little cookies. Very happy with this recipe find.

Good oatmeal cookies.  These are definitely not the healthy-type of flavor oatmeal cookies.  Did not like the pecans in them (!); I'll probably try a different recipe next time.  Certainly no one will complain about them though!

These are so damned wonderful, it's ridiculous! I baked everything in about an hour since my in-laws could keep the kids busy.

They filled the house with that brown sugar/cinnamon scent. It's Xmas in a bite! We all ate one as soon as they were cool enough and my 1yr old kept making "yummy" sounds as he ate it.

I had to make it with chocolate & no nuts because of allergies & no teeth (the 1yr old) & per recommended added more oats. Unfortunatedly adding the extra oats made the cookies not so very sweet so that was my bad.

I do think the recipe should have more cinnamon but that's cause I love cinnamon. Then again it could've been the extra oats that ruined that too.

Either way, wonderful cookies. Thank you for sharing.

I sifted in the baking soda with the flour and it was still very strong in flavor. If I use this recipe again, I will probably cut the baking soda down to 1 tsp. They're flat anyways, can't see it will make a difference other than better flavor. I also used 3 cups oats. I don't see how only 2 cups would suffice. This recipe was just "ehh."

3.5 out of 5 stars. While this is a decent oatmeal cookie recipe, I wouldn't call it the best, nor would I call it chewy. I followed the directions exactly and it seemed to be lacking something, of course I'm used to the recipe once used by my Great Grandmother at her restaurant, Dorothy's Lunch in Gambier, OH, but since I was lacking the shortening needed for her recipe and had a MAJOR oatmeal cookie craving I thought I'd give this one a try. Once again, not a bad recipe, but definitely not the best.

These cookies were just OK for me...if you don't flatten the cookies when you put them on the tray to bake, they come out soft and cake like...if you flatten them they come out soft and chewey...The dough is sticky so you will need to dip your fingers in flour before you press them down with you fingers otherwise the dough will stick to your fingers in the process of flattening them down on the cookie sheet prior to baking them.I prefer a cookie that's more crispier...if however you like SOFT cookies then this cookie recipe is for you. The taste was good but here again I prefer crispy cookies as opposed to soft ones. Also I sprayed my cookie trays with Baker's Joy because I had a hard time getting cookies off the cookie sheet after baking them even when I cooled them for five minutes on the cookie sheet as recommended in the recipe. UPDATE: When I stored these cookies afer baking them they all "melded" together in about 12 hours time..(meaning they all stuck together in my cookie tin)...My son suggested that, that happened because the cookies were somewhat thin...I slightly flattened each of the teaspoons full of dough before I baked them but that should not have stuck them all together like they did..(they weren't that thin..but they were soft and crumbly...I think maybe two teaspoons full of baking soda that the recipe calls for is too much...then again, maybe I did something else wrong..frankly I don't know what happened.

I made these for my husband since I don't like oatmeal cookies I thought I wouldn't eat them.  I was wrong these cookies are wonderful!!!!  I didn't soak raisins very long in eggs first time I made them the cookies were still awesome!  The second time I had more time so I soaked for the full hour.  They are even better!!!   Didn't change recipe at all perfect just the way it is.  Had to make more only two days later because my husband insisted he NEEDED more.  :-) thanks for the great recipe!

The title says it all. They came out nice and fat even though i used half applesauce for the butter. Not flat at all like i thought they might be. Kids love them and they are perfect.

First let me say I HATE oatmeal cookies!  They were my mom's and brothers favorites and I forever found them in my lunch box, to my dismay!  I have, over the years tried a ton of oatmeal cookie recipes hoping to find one that was at least tolerable to eat and didn't taste like cardboard with dried up pieces of... I don't know what in them.  I gave up on finding a recipe that I would like, but since this is also my hubby's favorite cookie, and it's Christmas, I tried looking for ONE more recipe to try that I would at least think was edible!  So, when I say this oatmeal cookie recipe is to die for - you just have to believe me!  They are chewy, tasty, and the raisins (since they are soaked before adding to the cookie dough) are soft , sweet, and yummy!  FINALLY!  This is an oatmeal cookie that even "I" love!  Yay!!!!  Thank you so much for posting it!!

Finally a chewy cookie! These were great, only change I made was to add some ground cloves as I prefer some more spice, but they were great. Also made with cranberries and white chocolate chips and were super. Thanks for sharing :)

Yikes, I just made these and am too embarrassed to say how many I've already eaten!  I have been craving homemade cookies for awhile and fiinally gave this recipe a try.  They hit the spot (obviously)!  I didn't add pecans b/c of picky children, and added chocolate chips to about half the dough.  I loved the addition, but even without them, if you are looking for a "plain" old, delicious oatmeal cookie recipe, this is for you.  Thanks so much for sharing!

While the cookies had good flavor, they would not set up at all. Very disapointed in the recipe. Tasted much more like a cake cookie with a few raisins and oatmeal than an actual oatmeal cookie.

I was really impressed with this cookie, I have tried several oatmeal recipes but never really got the results I was looking for. These came out really chewy and I loved the fact I did not have to use shortening. I did not have pecans on hand, but plan on using them the next batch I make. Great cookie! Husband and kids ate them up!

Fantastic! I used only 1 teaspoon of baking soda, as another reviewer suggested, which made them the perfect compromise of crispy and chewy. No "cakey" texture here! I might use a little more oatmeal next time since we really like the flavor and texture of it in my house- maybe an extra half cup. My only complaint which brought my rating down to four stars (I really wish there was a 4.5 star button) is that they're almost too sweet...but maybe that's a good thing as it will keep me from eating too many in a row! I would try 1.5 cups of combined white and brown sugar next time as another user recommended, but I can assure you there will be a next time!

We loved these cookies! These definitely beat store bought oatmeal cookies x 10! :) I sent a tin of these with a family friend out to the oil rigs and he says that they were the best he has ever had, he has put in a request for me to make them again for him to take to his next project. My husband however said that I should replace the raisins I added in place of the pecans with chocolate chips so next time for just him I'll split the dough in two, one for chips one for raisins.

i just made these a few days ago, the only change i made was in reducing the sugar because 2 cups of sugar seemed like a recipe for diabetes to me. this cookie is not the best nor would i qualify it as chewy the way an oatmeal raisin cookie should be.  somewhat cakey which would have been ok except that the cookie was so dry on the inside, not moist at all.  i should've just used the recipe from the quaker oat label. a lot of people seemed to like this recipe but not me, maybe these people like a cakey cookie, i don't.

This a great recipe.  I made a batch last night and everyone loves them.  I did not use raisins(hate cooked raisins) I used chocolate chips instead. SOMEBODY used all my baking soda, so I had to use baking powder instead.  They still turned out great. :o)

This is by far the BEST Oatmeal Cookie I have ever made or had the pleasure of eating.  When family and friends come over, the first thing they check is to see if there are any cookies in the container.  I make this about once every two weeks and they're gone in about 3 days.  :)  Just a wonderful recipe.  I made it exactly as written the first time and loved them.  Then I went with another reviewer's suggestion and added 1 additional cup of oatmeal and, personally, I like it better.  BUT, they are fabulous as written.  Thanks for a family keeper!

A very good oatmeal cookie recipe.  I made mine with cranberries instead of raisins.  But delicious all the same.  For those who gave it less than five stars may I recommend first of all rating the recipe based on the original recipe.  If you alter it and get less than stellar results--it is not the recipe's fault its the one making and changing the recipe!  Most of the less than 5 stars rated it as such because of their shortcomings not this recipe.  Very good--the cookies were gone the night I made them!

I dropped by teaspoonfuls onto my cookie sheet as instructed and in the end I had 109 cookies!  That's 109 delicious cookies with great texture and taste.  I will definitely make these again.

These came out very chewy just like the recipe states. Other reviewers said they added more oatmeal. I kept it at 2 cups as the recipe states. Anymore oatmeal and I wouldn't have been able to stir the batter. I really had to struggle to get that dough mixed! I baked half the cookies and froze the rest of the batter (I made little dough balls; pop the frozen dough balls in the oven and the come out fantastic!). My husband HATES oatmeal raisin cookies. He LOVES these cookies. He's like..."hmmm...maybe my taste buds have changed." Thanks for a great recipe!

it made 6 dozen and they truly are "the best"  I love the idea of soaking the raisins in egg & vanilla first, it took cheap dry raisins and turned them nice again.  I did not have 3 hours to soak them, and 1 hour did a good job.

I have no clue where the "cakey" people are coming from with this recipe!!!!  They are so moist and chewy--I haven't ever had an oatmeal cookie quite like them and I generally don't like oatmeal cookies.  So do yourself a favor, follow the recipe exactly, and give these a try.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.  And, for the record, the next time I make them, I'll scale back a bit on the sugar.

I made this cookie according to the recipe.  It is not a sweet cookie, more cake like.  I did not care for it, it's just not what I wanted it to taste like.  Hope the family will like them.  They were just not my favorite taste.

I thought this was a good basic oatmeal cookie recipe. I cut the white sugar in half and added 1/4 cup molasses and they were still plenty sweet. Next time I might add a little more cinnamon. Overall, soft as advertised and yummy cookies.

Love these cookies.  They were flavorful and had a chewy consistency with a little crispness.  I substituted 1/2 C of butter-flavored Crisco for 1/2 C of the butter.  This gave me the consistency that I wanted for the cookies.  Next time I will cut the salt in half.  Will definitely make these again!

These are really good.  For those that want a REALLY chewy cookie... The second time I made them, I used bread flour instead of all purpose, an egg yolk and full egg and 1 1/2c brown sugar and 1/2 c. white.  They were sooooo chewy.  I creamed the butter and sugars, then added the eggs and vanilla.  I beat it well after adding the bread flour/leavening mixture to develop a little gluten and then added the oatmeal and raisins.

Also, they could use more cinnamon and maybe a pinch of nutmeg to spice it up a tad.

Great recipe!  Thanks!

This recipe was incredible. Soft and chewy cookie! I left out the pecans and substituted a dried craisin/cherry/blueberry mixture with the raisins and they were delish. I also used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce, increased the oats to 2 and 1/2 cups, baking soda by 1 tsp. and used 1 and 1/2 cups brown sugar and only 1/2 white. I would make these cookies again 10 times the same exact way. Everyone at my house loves them!

This IS an awesome cookie recipe. I tried it because my husband was insisting I make his mom's oatmeal cookies. I baked these and he hasn't asked for mom's since! All the flavors are perfectly balanced, no alterations I can think of not at all a bland cookie. Just a note let them cool COMPLETELY before putting them in a container. I got impatient with one batch and they all stuck together...

These cookies are delicious - as many others have said, slight crunch outside & chewy inside.  I've made them 3 times so far, and they're yummy substituting dried cranberries for some or all of the raisins or without nuts also (my teen doesn't like nuts).   I use  egg substitute instead of real eggs - less fat and no noticeable difference to the batch I made w/ eggs.  Next time I'm going to try a little more cinnamon, too!

Oh my were these tremendously good! My only change was that I left out the raisins and subbed with chocolate chips. I super sized the cookies to use for ice cream sammy's but not before devouring several on the sly! My S.O.'s (significant other's) grandchildren loved these. Thanks so much Melanie!

I give this recipe three stars instead of one as it is probably me that goofed.  But I did not care for it at all.   I believe that I did all the steps correctly. The cookies fell apart, were gummy, browned way before their time and were flat.

I love to bake cookies and find these to be the best I have ever made. It is important to chill the eggs,vanilla and raisins for the 1 hr as directed. I made these into a delicious dessert by putting a scoop of vanilla icecream on top of a cookie and drizzling with caramel sauce and toasted nuts on top. It was a hit!!

I'm not an oatmeal cookie lover, but these are some of the best cookies of any kind I have ever had! I'm shocked they're so good--yet were so simple to make. I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't add nuts, plus I altered the recipe to make only twelve cookies.  They were perfect--only bad thing about them is how good they are: I've already have five!!!

Instead of raisins and pecans, I added chopped dried apricots and walnuts. I let the chopped apricots sit in the egg mixture for a little longer (like 3 hours) so they were well hydrated. Everything else remained the same and everyone here likes the tangy snap the apricots add. I think it would taste even better with a bit of lemon or orange zest, too.....  This was chewy if they are made in small cookies - that wasn't what happened with the bigger cookies.

mmmm-mmmm.... I had to get my hands involved in the mixing and I used 3 bowls, but other than that no complaints. I am sure I made my first batch too big and they got a little teensy bit cakey. I will let you know how my second batch goes tomorrow. Only things I modified was that I just added and extra handful or so of oatmeal since I couldn't be bothered to save that little left-over. And just to highlight how good these are, I am NOT a fan of raisin oatmeal cookies, but I made them as a healthier option for a treat in my kids lunches, and I think they are superb and will be adding them to my usual rotation. Thank you!

I went in search of a recipe for "The Best Oatmeal Cookies" a few weeks ago, and found this recipe. I have made it twice already. Without a doubt, THE BEST oatmeal cookie I have ever made! A definate keeper. I added a bit more cinnamon the second time. Also left the eggs, raisins and vanilla overnight in the refrigerator, and the cookies turned out even chewier the second time. If you are looking for a great oatmeal cookie, this is it!

These cookies are so good!  I have been looking for a "keeper" oatmeal cookie recipe and I have found it...much better than the recipe on the name brand oatmeal carton!  These were crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle. Perfect!

My favorite oatmeal cookies! My father always made these for us and would send them in care packages to college. Now I am a Mom and make them for my kids. I was about to submit this exact recipe, when I decided to do a little research first to see if it was already on here and ta-da! You did the work for me! Just as the reviewers have written, these are THE BEST ever! So chewy and moist - the secret is soaking the raisins or dried cranberries. I also decrease the sugar a bit and sometimes add some chocolate chips. They are great everytime!

Yummy!!  
Very similar to the kind at Subway, nice and chewy on the inside, cripsy edges, thank you.
Update: it's been a couple of days and these are still great, going to have to refill the cookie jar soon -yummy

These were the best cookies ever!  They were chewy-just as promised.  The search for a good oatmeal raisin cookie has ended.  I made these for a friend who is crazy about oatmeal raisin cookies and he said they were the best he had ever had.  This recipie is a keeper.

These cookies were awesome!  I didn't have time to chill the eggs, but they still turned out great.  Oh, and I also used mini chocolate chips instead of raisins and nuts.  The only thing I will do differently next time is use a bit less baking soda b/c I could taste it in the cookies.  Noone else could though!  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this delicious cookie. I did follow the suggestions of using 1 teaspoon baking soda and one teaspoon baking power. I got great reviews on the cookie.  My only problem was they are a bit sticky. When I put them in my cookie jar they stuck together. But that didn't matter. They disappeared within the day

I had never made raisin cookies before since no one else in my house likes raisins, so I looked over a lot of recipes and read a lot of reviews before settling on this one and I’m sure glad I did. I followed the instructions exactly and am really happy with how they turned out. They’re very sweet and chewy soft. I will make these again.

This is so good.  I used Walnuts because that is what I had, and milk chocolate chips in place of raisins.  So I didn't do the soaking thing.  Nice and crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle.  YUM!  This is my go to oatmeal recipe.

This recipe made THE BEST oatmeal cookies. My husband couldn't keep his hands off of them. The only thing I struggled with was combining the oats, because the batter was pretty tough at the end. I substituted Coconut Oil for butter (1:1) and used dried cherries and white chocolate chunks. These are soo good! I can't stop eating them! The batter was amazing too. =)

oh my goodness was this great!  I swapped out half the raisins for dried cherries and dumped in a cup of chocolate chips and boy were they terrific. I made them for my husband's cub scout leadership team meeting and told my hubby to make sure he sent the leftovers home with them.  I came downstairs after the meeting and there were only a couple left, and I said, "Oh good, you sent them home with those guys." "sent them home?!" he said, "They devoured them ALL!" :D  I'm not a great baker, so that was a real compliment.

Love these! I will have to admit that I was afraid my mixer was taxing itself and I left out the last 1/2 cup of flour. I realize that this made mine flatter than others, but the taste was wonderful! Buttery goodness. I did use a Chinese Cassia Powder for the cinnamon and upped the amount. Left out nuts (kids don't like) but added a few semi-sweet chips. Yum! Thanks for the recipe.

These are really the best oatmeal cookies! I added dried cranberries instead of raisins and walnuts instead of pecans. Perfect!

Ok, this is hands-down my favorite oatmeal cookie! But, first time I made this, instead of using oats, or flour for that matter, I used 4 1/2 cups of Oat flour! It turned out ALOT better than the next time I made these. Tip if your going to use the oat flour, make each cookie a teeny weenie spoonful, it runs then becomes gigantic o_o.

Excellent cookies.  Evidently those who said these cookies were cakey did not prepare them the way I did because they have perfect texture.  I did add one tablespoon of molasses to the raisin mixture, but I wouldn't change anything else.

I just got done baking these cookies and I love them! I halved the recipe to just try it and I got a crispy cookie on the outside, chewy on the inside cookie! Next time though, I might use all brown sugar, up the salt, cinnamon, and less baking soda for a crispier cookie. I felt the cookie needed a bit more spice or something so maybe I didn't put enough salt or spice. Either way I will be baking these again!

These are the best cookies.......ever!  I made this recipe close to 1½ years ago, and liked them.  Baked them again yesterday, and my husband loved them...  He said they were the best he had ever had.  They were chewy and soft.  Delicious.

I made these cookies because of the reviews. I have never had a better tasting oatmeal cookie. I added chocolate chips to the batter, and it is very stiff with everything mixed in, but well worth it. Everyone loved them and it made so many I sent them to work and school.

These are great cookies.  You do need to cook a little longer, but they will still look uncooked.  Soaking the raisins made them more juicy.  I will remember that trick for future recipes.

These cookies definitely live up to their name! They are THE BEST! I used a tsp measuring scoop for my 1st batch, but they were kinda small (have to make them to be sold@ a function), so the next batch I used 1TB, left them in for a about 13 min, and they too turned out perfect! Thanks SO much for sharing!!!

Awesome cookies!  This recipe is just great I have been trying various Oatmeal Raisin cookie recipes (5 different recipes) and this is so far the best. I can not say enough good things. follow the directiond to the letter and it will come out great. The only change I made was I did not add pecans and put in extra raisins.

these cookies turned out great-but i had a problem i never had before! the few minor changes i made were: subed 1/2 c. of peanut butter for 1/2 c. butter and to quick plump the raisins (i used dried cranberries) i used hot water and vanilla for about 20 min. i saw this in another recipe but had never tried it before. the cookies were moist and chewy the first 2 days but by the third day, stored in an airtight container, they started turning green! i am guessing mold from the un-dried fruit. i've never had that happen before the only thing new i tried was soaking the fruit.

This recipe is great.  I made adjustments by adding 1/4 cup flour, and doubled the baking soda as suggested by others.  I did refrigerate the dough and did not have spreading issues at all.  The second batch I used crasins, white vanilla chips and fresh orange zest and oh what a great combo!  To keep them from getting too hard, do not overbake.  They will not look done, but the time on the cookie sheets finishes them.  Also, thank you to the reviewer who suggested truly "beating" the sugars and butters for several minutes.  I did, using my KitchenAid and stirred the rest of the ingredients by hand.  Hubby is munching them and has a bag packed for work tomorrow! UPDATED 2/14/09:  I tried Soft Oatmeal Cookies from this site and it is also very good.  Hard to pick a favorite, both are great!  So 5 stars for both recipes!

I agree - these are the best! I tried it for 2007's Christmas cookie assortment, and it has become a raving classic. Everyone LOVESLOVESLOVES these cookies! I just made a batch to thank a co-worker for a favor, and passed the rest out to other lucky co-workers. It was a very good day at work! A couple of suggestions. I simply rolled the cookies into balls about 1" - didn't flatten them - and they baked up just fine. Also, the dough does get quite stiff, so I just tossed the spoon in the sink and got in there with my hands to mix the oatmeal in. Hey, maybe that's why they're so good! ;-)

This is the best oatmeal cookie recipe I've found to date!  I followed a previous reviewer's lead, and added an additional cup of rolled oats.  I also substituted the raisins for a 1 cup mixture of raisins, golden raisins and dried cranberries.  The cookies came out beautifully!  They look and taste fantistic!  Make sure you don't make them much bigger than a rounded teaspoon and they'll be soft, chewy and perfect!

By far the best cookies that I have ever tasted!  I use cranberries instead of raisins, and added just a little extra salt.  I have made these cookies three times in the last three weeks and my family goes crazy for them.  If you are looking for an oatmeal cookie recipe - this is the one you want!

This recipe produces nice chewy cookies.  I believe the last reviewer used baking powder instead of baking powder, which resulted in the cakey cookies rather than chewy cookies.  Hope this helps.

This was not the best oatmeal cookie.  Although I followed the recipe, I was surprised how tasteless it was.  It was cakey, not chewy.

Awesome cookies!!! So many oatmeal cookie recipes I have made in the past left a after-taste that was unpleasant, but these didn't at all.   Great flavor!  I followed the recipe exactly except that I doubled it and also added 1/4 tsp of freshly grated nutmeg.  My husband, who is a very picky cookie eater, and my daughter both raved over them.  I am taking a batch to work tomorrow.  These cookies are chewy and a little crispy around the edges (except that it was hot and humid out today and this made some of the first batches get very soft since I left them out too long.  The rest I bagged in zip lock bags as soon as they cooled and they stayed more crisp).  I will be baking these often!

I think I've ruined almost every batch of cookies I've tried to make in the past.  These came out beautifully!  Absolutely delicious.  I used half raisins and half dried cranberries and left out the nuts.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Really, these are the best.  They are actually much better the next day, rather than fresh out of the oven.  They stayed moist and chewy for several days.  We are not a raisin family so I used chocolate chips instead (omit soaking).  We loved these cookies, thanks.

This is the BEST RECIPE for OATMEAL COOKIES I have come across. I took one bite and KNEW these were the ones! 
I changed the recipe to metric and made almost 9 dozen today! I reduced the sugar amount. I used a mixture of High Fiber oatmeal and regular oats. The oven time was pretty precise. Thank goodness for timers. The cookies were golden and chewy. My husband LOVES them. 
This will be my signature oatmeal cookie recipe!

Awesome, awesome, awesome.... Had no cinnamon or white sugar in the house so I added more brown sugar and three packages of apple cinnamon instant oatmeal (took out the apples). My very picky boyfriend ate the majority of them and said that they were the best he's ever eaten. THANK YOU for this recipe!!!

These cookies are exactly what I was looking for in an oatmeal cookie.  I added a selection of dried fruit and nuts (cranberries, dates, walnuts, etc.) and did not soak them for an hour (more like 15 minutes).  My two year old son helped to sample it every step of the way, and approved the entire time.  My husband and him ate them fresh and hot from the oven with no complaints at all.  All in all, this recipe is a keeper. Thank goodness for wholesome real ingredients!

I made it this time as per the recipe. I really like the raisins soaking in the egg and vanilla, really plumped up the raisins.  Next time I would try cutting back a little on both the white and brown sugar, 3/4 cup vs 1 cup.  I would also trying adding coconut.

Oatmeal Raisin cookies are my husbands favorite. These were awesome. I've read the bad reviews and have no idea what the other people did wrong. They came out perfect.  The dough is not runny at all, Maybe they let their butter get too soft. They didn't spread too much. I was able to get 16 cookies per sheet. Make sure you leave them on the cookie sheet for that extra 5 minutes out of the oven, seems to make the cookie "set". I used a hand mixer for the butter and sugar, everything else I mixed with my hands, literally.
Too thick for the hand mixer and too difficult with a spoon. My clean, rubber gloved hands worked the best. I give these 5 stars!!!

It's true, these cookies are the best I've ever had (my partner and friends agree!). Crunchy on the outside, chewy goodness on the inside. After reading the reviews, I was careful to follow the directions exactly, unfortunately, I ran out of butter part way, so added maybe 1/4 of cup of olive oil. I also substituted walnuts for the pecans and dark chocolate chips for the raisins. I can confirm, totally yummy!

I halved the recipe to make a smaller batch, used ghee (purified butter) instead of butter. Added some walnuts in with the pecans....they turned out scrumptious!

This recipe makes a delicious cookie that is chewy on the inside and not super sweet. I added an additional1/2 cup oatmeal and used Egg Beaters because I had it on hand and needed to use it up. You must soak the raisins! I used small dinner sized spoonfuls and it yielded about 5 doz , 2 inch cookies. Be sure to let cool completely before storing. They will freeze well also.

Made these today and took them out of the oven thinking I had done something wrong.  They looked cake-like which I saw in the reviews.  Wait for it......let them cool on the pan and by the time the next batch is ready the the puffy goes down and it leaves you with the most amazing cookie ever.  A little crisp on the edges with chewy in the middle.  EXACTLY what I was looking for.  I won't be making the recipe on the back of the oatmeal box anymore.  Thanks for taking the time to send this in!!!

I have made these for at least 25 years but we call them Aunt Elsie's as I got the recipe from my SIL Elsie.  My boys prefer them to chocolate chip.  I always make the wheat germ 1/2 cup sub for oatmeal.  I think the soaking of the raisins is key and use a mixer to make the dough as it mashes the raisins.  They make a good emergency breakfast!

I like nuts so I increased to 1.5 cups.  I also doubled the vanilla (I always do) and decreased the sugar to 3/4 each (again something I always do.  ??

This is the best oatmeal cookie recipe I've tried.  They are delicious.  Only change I made was to add about 1/4 t of ground nutmeg, and used walnuts, probably more than they called for.  I did change the mixing method: soaked raisins in boiling water for awhile, then drained then and dried off excess water.  Creamed the eggs with the butter, et al, then followed the instructions.  Wow!  These cookies are great.  Plannied on using them for a quick breakfast on the go, but they're so good u just keep eating.

I am so sad! after all the amazing reviews, I was so hopeful. I must have messed something up because my cookies turned out thin and crispy, regardless of the size of the cookies :( The flavor was fantastic though! 
I chilled the dough in the freezer to keep it from spreading too fast; my first dozen turned out to be cookie chips before I chilled it :/ 
After chilling, they were a bit better, but still not great. They were still a bit chewy despite being so thin. I'll have to check my oven temp because that is the only thing I can think of that could potentially be the problem.

No, followed directions but cookies came out very thin and stuck to the pans (I tried several different sheets including a silicone sheet) so I have a lot of cookie bits.  Was something left out of the recipe?

I have been using the Quaker Famous Oatmeal cookies recipe for 50 years. I decided to try this recipe today, don't know why, but I am glad I did.
These cookies are superb! As my old favorite didn't contain cinnamon, I decided not to use it this one either. I love cinnamon a lot, but not in my oatmeal cookies. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly, but used Craisins® instead of raisins. And I love them! 
I made the first two batches big, using about a tablespoon of dough for each one. They came out great, but they spread a bit more and touched in a few places. I reduced the dough to 1 teaspoon for the rest of the cookies and they were perfect. 
I don't see how anyone could say these are cakey, far from it! If you used shortening instead of butter though I bet they would be cakey. 
Stick to the recipe, you can't go wrong. You will get crispy edges and nicely textured, chewy centers! Yum yum!

My husband is very picky about oatmeal raisin cookies.  His grandmother's recipe is his favorite and he doesn't want any others.  Could not find her recipe and tried this one.  Great flavor, wonderfully chewy.  Did not add nuts.  He raved about them!  Thank you!

I have been using this recipe for years, as it was first published in the Colorado Cache Cookbook. I get rave reviews every time I make these. I have played with substituting ground flax , chia, and coconut with success. These freeze beautifully.

Absolutely fabulous!!! I substituted coconut sugar for the brown sugar but otherwise made as written. Family devoured them!! Yum!! (Not sure why others have said these come out cakey--if you follow the directions and take them out of the oven in time (for me it was 11 minutes), they are crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle.

Plus they make the kitchen smell heavenly!!

I made these with the suggestion from another user in here to add more oats. And yes they where perfect with a 1/2 cup more oats added. Simply the best oatmeal cookies I’ve ever had.  Wonderful. I added some chocolate chips. 1/3 cup and it gave the last yumminess. Try them.  .

I will definitely make this again. Everything about it is just perfect for my taste. I used a food prep scoop to place the dough on the baking sheet, which gave evenly sized and browned cookies. Also, I soaked the raisins for 10 minutes in warm water before adding them to the eggs.

I was looking for an oatmeal raisin cookie recipe that was crunchy and chewy at the same time. This one, when followed exactly as it states to do, was absolutely perfect!! The edges were crunchy and the inside was chewy.  My husband said they were the best he has ever eaten. This is huge for me because he is soooo picky. These were also so good that I even enjoyed them and I'm not much of an oatmeal raisin cookie kinda gal.

Great recipe. My husband doesn't like raisins in his cookies, so I left em out. I mixed up and let dough sit covered over night in frig. Made perfect chewy cookies .... So good I had to hide em.

The cookies are delicious.  Maybe the few people who are having problems didn't cream the butter and sugar enough (or maybe too much).  I did add a bit more cinnamon and I added chips to half the batch.

These are the best oatmeal cookies ever. My husband doesn't even like raisins and he can't stop eating these. I added min chocolate chips to my second batch at his request and they really kicked these cookies up a notch (not that they needed it lol).

The cookies were great! I made them as a way to use up some dried blueberries I had been given a few years ago. The soaking really made all the difference. I found that the bottoms burned a bit in my oven if I cooked them as prescribed, so I wound up having to turn off the oven about two thirds of the way through each batch, then letting them go an extra minute or two to make up for any lost heat. Doing that, the bottoms turned out golden and crispy still with a toffee-esque taste without any blackened burnt tasting bits.

excellent cookie.  I made them large and flattened out before baking.  I used 2 cups brown sugar and no white sugar.  Best if using quick cook oats.  Very stiff dough.

These truly are delicious.  Soaking the raisins is the key (although I don't always give it the hour and usually do it on the counter).  I like cinnamon so I tend to add a bit extra and these go quickly!

I took advice of another reviewer and added another cup of oats.  I also used regular oats--not quick-cooking.  I left out nuts to please a group of college guys. Sent away to college in care package! Very chewy and great flavor.

I love this recipe. The raisins are soft and the cookies are chewy and the edges just slightly crisp. My sister has decreed them the best oatmeal cookies ever and I've made them according to the recipe twice and both times they were just perfect.

I am not a big baker, but I had some left over breakfast oatmeal mix (oats, millet, pumpkin seeds, dried cranberries) I wanted to use up. I substituted the oats and nuts for 3 cups of the nut/grain mixture. This turned out soooo good. Crispy outside, nice and chewy inside. Not too dry,  not too flat, not to cakey... perfect!

Oatmeal Raisin Cookies are my husband's favorite, so I gave these a try.  He has been raving about them for days.  They are the perfect consistency, crispy around the edges, and chewy in the center,  absolutely irresistible.  Just for fun we added about 1/2 cup of chopped dates, to use up the end of a package, and maybe 1/3 cup of mini chocolate chips, also to use them up.  The recipe would definitely stand on its own, but I don't think my additions did any harm.  Delightful.

I followed the recipe exactly except for I was a little short on the rolled oats. I have to admit that the cookie did not look like I thought it would, they didn't really keep their shape. Anyway, in a nutshell they are okay. The dough tasted great!

Very tasty recipe! The only thing is that the taste doesn't linger on the tongue very long. The taste just seems to evaporate so you can't really savor the cookie, if that makes sense. I adjusted the recipe to only make 24 servings and used a measuring scoop to measure out 1 Tbsp. It still made over 50 cookies!!

I don't know what the people who are saying this cookie is cake-like did wrong but these are definitely chewy cookies. I've made them several times with and without nuts and they are always a hit-- even with people who are not oatmeal raisin cookie fans. Try it, don't make your cookies too big and follow the instructions. You won't be disappointed.

A very delicious recipe. I used cranberries rather than raisins and left out the pecans. I thought the dough was too dry when I mixed it because it is so stiff, but they turned out great-very moist and chewy on the inside, crisp on the outside. I might add dark chocolate chips next time I make these.

My 11 year old son & I bake every week. This week we tried this recipe but, being an 11 year old boy, he wanted to swap out half the raisins for chocolate chips (actually, he wanted to switch raisins for CC entirely, but we settled on 1/2 and 1/2). Also, we didn't have an hour to chill the egg mixture so just popped that bowl in the freezer while we mixed the dry ingredients. I only had steel cut oats so used those and mixed them in with the egg mixture before adding that to the dry mix in the kitchen aid. The cookies turned about wonderfully and my son is thinking they are the best we've done so far. This recipe is a keeper for us!

I'm not much of a baker but my son loves oatmeal raisin cookies. These turned out perfect!!  I surprised myself and he loved them as well. My mom bakes often and thought they were wonderful. This is the only oatmeal raisin recipe I will use!!  I did use walnuts instead of pecans because that is what I had!!

As a person with a background as a pastry chef I forewarn future bakers: THIS IS NOT A CHEWY COOKIE!!! For goodness sake the cookie springs back when I poke it with my finger! I even tried undercooking it and flattening the cookie on the baking sheet prior to baking ---resulted in a super flat, ugly cakey cookie! Haha. I was hoping the other reviewers were wrong and accidentally swapped the baking soda for baking powder---which would sabotage any cookie. I should have trusted my instinct when I saw that this recipe had an extra egg and double the baking soda of comparable oatmeal cookie recipes. Don't be fooled to think just because a cookie is soft, pliable and has tons of chewy oatmeal---its a chewy cookie. Ahh, no. A chewy cookie needs to be formulated to be chewy---and this recipe is far cry from that. Plus its a bit bland. I've tasted better. Sorry----hopefully I'll save some obsessive-baker/food-critic such as myself from the same disappointment.

These are a family favorite! I add cranberries, not raisins and chocolate chips and a healthier alternative; one and a half cups of whole wheat flour (plus one cup of white). The longer the cranberries (or raisins) and eggs sit, the better. I've left it up to a few weeks in the fridge, instead of the recommended hour and they are the chewiest cookies around, and crisp on the outside, just how I love them. I would say bake 12 minutes and be careful to not be alone and hungry when you're baking, you may end up eating much too many!

I hate oatmeal raisin cookies.  Until now!  I couldn't stop eating these.  My husband loves oatmeal raisin cookies and ate a whole tin by himself.  He finally begged me to hide the rest from him.  They are chewy without being gloppy and the oatmeal is totally incorporated (no cardboard taste!) I used craisins and walnuts because that's what I had on hand and on impulse threw in a handful of chocolate chips.  Yield was more like 7 dozen rather than 3.  These are definitely the ones I will make from now on.

Am just a part-time baking fan, just for the smile from the faces enjoying the result. Can't believe simply by changing a little bit here and there, wonder evolved itself. Only twist I made was instead of vanilla extra (haven't got any), I added one table spoon of maple syrup. Also, as a huge fan of cinnamon, I added 2 teaspoons instead. My friend's family claimed these are the best oatmeal cookies they have ever had in their life. Apologize the absence of photo, because they are all gone.

I will never look for another oatmeal raisin cookie recipe again. These are out-of-this-world awesome!  I do wish they wouldn’t spread as much and they’d be a little taller, but I’m experimenting to try to make that happen because I’m not straying from this recipe.  The soaking of the raisins in eggs and vanilla—genius!  I believe that this is what makes the recipe so good!

I am in the kitchen baking them now. Followed the recipe exactly but left out the pecans. My husband gave me the Oatmeal Cookie Challenge. He loves my Chocolate Chip Cookies but I am not an Oatmeal Cookie fan. WELL, I went through a lot of recipes here and read through the reviews. This one had an review that said her husband liked this one best. Chewy cookie with slight crispy outside. I LOVE this recipe. He gets home Tuesday. They probably wont make it from Sat to Tues. I will have to make more. The kids love them, too. Made them walnut size with a dark gray Teflon baking sheet. Came out perfect at 10 minutes. Leave on baking sheet for 5 minutes. Then move them to cooling rack as directed.

I made as directed minues raises and nuts, since my kids don't like them and did one batch as the recipe calls for and they were a little cakey, but after that batch I added more oats to it and it was better.  I also had to lower the time to about 7 minutes, but that could just be my oven as ovens and altitudes vary. They weren't the best I've every had, but my kids enjoyed them.  I'm going to add chocolate chips in the last two batches (I'm still baking them) and see how they taste.  But overall, good if you add more oats unless you do like them a little cakey.  I don't with oatmeal cookies, but don't mind with other types so I think it's a preference.  I also think that the cakey part comes from mixing the batter too much, so that could be a problem some were having.  Next time I'll try it without mixing too much and see if it's better.  Overall, they are good and worth a try.

These are simply the best oatmeal raisin cookies ever. Soaking the raisins makes all the difference! I follow the recipe exactly, but I add chocolate chips to some of them.

I made a few changes: 1/2 c butter, 1/2 c butter flavored Crisco, 3/4 c Craisins, 1/2 c sliced almonds, 1/2 c chocolate chips, & I added the zest of 1 orange & 1 t baking powder.  I found I needed to mix the dry ingredients with my hands to get a sticky enough dough.  I baked for 12 minutes.  These came out with a nice chewy consistancy.  I got 5 dozen & my calorie counter app says they have 104 calories each, so I broke my diet to try one, ok two!

Just baked a batch of these cookies.  I agonized over whether or not to follow the recipe or take the suggestions of other reviewers.  I made two adjustments:  used 1 teas. of baking soda and 1 teas baking powder; I also added 1/4 teaspoon of allspice for extra spice.  My cookies turned out beautifully. Having admitted that, I fall on the side of the reviewers who emphasized that following the recipe exactly will reap excellent results.  Trust it.  I think the best advice is to make sure that you take the cookies out of the oven as soon as the edges turn brown and the center appears underdone.  On one batch of cookies, I let the center start to brown and that batch is not nice and chewy in the center as the rest of the cookies.  If you have a taste for these cookies one day and you don't have any nuts, no worries.  I bought some expensive pecan nuts that added nothing to the recipe. You can skip the nuts. I could have done without them and they would have been just as good.  As others warned, this recipe yields LOTS of cookies.  It seems they are all over the kitchen. I'll have to give some away.  I suspect there will be many takers. I used parchment paper on most batches but for experimental purposes, I made one batch just using my new non-stick sheet.  No difference.  As others have warned, the dough is stiff! Again, don't worry.  I used a cookie scoop and they were the perfect size. The cookies are indeed crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle.  Good Luck!

The only problem with these oatmeal cookies is that they disappear from the cooling rack before they reach the cookie jar!  These are dangerously good cookies!  YUM!

These are the best Oatmeal cookies. I did not add the pecans and I didn't have the raisins so I substituted with dried cherries. Chopped them up and followed the rest of the recipe. They were delicious, my grandson even thinks so. They are chewing and crunchy. I will be taking these too work. My co-workers allways love it when I bring goodies and they are going to love these.

Delicious recipe.  Cookies do stick to the "unprepared pan" though.  I lined pans with parchment paper.  After baking, I slid cookies on the paper, right onto wire rack to cool.  When cool, the cookies lift right off the paper.  Easier clean up too.

I just made these cookies following the recipe exactly as it is here and my cookies turned out perfect!  They are a little crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  I am definitely saving this recipe.  Maybe next time I would double it because I know these cookies will be gone tommorow already.

I didn't have butter, so I used butter flavored shortening and they turned out well. And instead of just cinnamon, I used apple pie spice, which worked well, too.

These cookies are truly the BEST! I've made them several times and they're great every time. I use dried cranberries instead of raisins and walnuts instead of pecans...still, fabulous! I think the soaking of the raisins makes the difference. Thanks!

This is a very good recipe for Oatmeal Cookies, but I changed it up a bit.  I soaked the raisins in a mixture water/apple juice for about an hour.  I added 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1/2 cup butter instead.  I also added 1/2 cup of Quaker's Honey Wheat germ and 1 1/2 cups of oats.  I was trying to make it a little healthier and hiding some good stuff for the kids. Turned out perfectly.

I'm not a bog fan of oatmeal cookies, but I made these for my boyfriend for Valentinme's Day. He loved them! They are just chewy enough..crispy bottom but soft everywhere else. I even liked them!

I used quick oats--not sure if it had something to do with it, but my dough was kind of flaky..I just made balls out of the mix and pressed them down. Perfect after baking!

I used walnuts instead of pecans, simply because I didn't have pecans.
These are better than I expected.  Saved to my recipe box.  Highly recommend these.

Excellent recipe, the only change that I made was to use cake flour instead of all purpose flour. I refrigerated the batter for approximately 1 hour and used a cookie scoop to put on parchment covered cookie sheet. Baked cookies for 9 minutes and they came out great! Perfect in everyway...VERY CHEWY!

Very good recipe! Next time I'll add more raisins and cinnamon though. Cookies came out chewy and everyone loved them.
