Although, our plates looked simple the taste made it feel like we were out an expensive resteraunt.  The smell was amazing.  I will be using the technique and rub on other meats.

This smells fabulous while it's cooking and is SOOOO delicious! One of the best, flavorful Mexican recipes I have tried on this website. My picky 3-year old even loved it! I have yet to try Ronaldo's Beef Carnitas which this recipe is "based from" so I'll have to try that before chosing my favorite between the two.
