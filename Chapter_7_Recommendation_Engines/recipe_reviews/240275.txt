I don't normally review recipes when I didn't completely follow the recipe, but since this one doesn't have any reviews, I want everyone to know how delicious it is! I totally left out the pie crust on bottom. Also, I'm not crazy about peanuts, so for the topping, I finely chopped peanut butter and chocolate chips and sprinkled that on top - fantabulous! A very rich and delicious dessert!

This recipe was fantastic! I've made other chocolate-peanut butter pies and this was the best. My kids and husband went crazy over this pie. The brownie mixture on the bottom is what made the texture and taste so incredible. Two tips: I had to cook the brownie layer longer than what the recipe recommended. In following the recommended time, the brownie was obviously not done, it was jiggly. I'm not sure why.  2.  I used a graham cracker crust, which made it sinfully great. This pie is a must try, if you like chocolate brownies and peanut butter - thanks!
