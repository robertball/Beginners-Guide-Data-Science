Wonderful, healthy recipe! It took me a while to roll them out, but I am sure that is just my lack of talent...The only thing I would recommend is to put them on a towel after cooking them and stacking them up, or the bottom one tends to get pretty soggy! Thanks for a delicious recipe!
**I just made these again, and let them sit for about thirty minutes (covered) instead of ten after kneading. They rolled out MUCH better, and tasted just great still!

These turned out great!  I have tried several tortilla recipes recently trying to find a good one, since store bought tortillas have so many wierd preservatives and additives.  These are definitely the easiest and best recipe that I have tried.  Husband loved them too.  Used them for enchiladas.  Followed recipe exactly, dough seemed dry at first but turned out to be just right after kneading for 5 min.  Very easy to roll out, didn't even need to flour countertop.  Cooked each side over medium heat for about 45 to 60 seconds, didn't oil or spray pan or anything.  Next time I might try using some whole wheat flour for some of the white and see how it turns out.

These were great! I used whole wheat flour as well a the oat bran I was not sure how it would go over, but my family LOVED them!! They want more LOL I filled it with black beans and corn from another recipe I found on this site for quesadillas. Be careful to pour the water into the bowl, not the opposite, cause it gets too dry( that may have something to do with the whole wheat flour) I had to throw my first batch away... But it was worth it for good to you, good for you tortillas . Yum.

Great recipe! I followed the recipe as close as I could, just didn't have any baking powder.  Used a cast iron skillet to cook them and they puffed up beautifully even without th baking powder.  Taste awesome! Thanks for the recipe!

These had to go right into the trash. They would not roll out. The one that I did make looked like a mess and tasted terrible. I would not make these again.

My entire family thought these were delicious. No problem rolling out and also found it unnecessary to oil the pan to cook them. Used whole wheat flour. Will make these again and again.

These were awesome. I made half recipe.  I did substitute 1/2 flour for 1/2 whole wheat and  1/2 oat bran with 1/2 psyllium husk. They turned out great on a flat iron skillet on the stove. No more buying high fiber tortillas at the store.

Impressed! I was surprised how well these turned out. Granted I did adjust a couple things, but just barely... I added 2 tsp olive oil and made my tortillas thick. They were too thick to "bubble", they just got slightly browned on either side. I was hoping they would work for wraps and they do! They are soft enough. Glad I found an easy and healthy recipe so I don't have to buy store bought tortillas (with all their nasty additives!) anymore.

Cheap, easy, and healthy way to make homemade tortillas. I took a suggestion from above and placed them on a towel to stack them. Followed recipe as it is above. With only a few ingredients, there was no need to alter anything. Rolling them out is a little difficult, but remember, practice makes perfect. Great recipe and the directions are pretty clear cut for beginners.
