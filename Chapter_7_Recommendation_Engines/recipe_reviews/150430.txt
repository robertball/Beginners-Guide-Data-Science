This is superb! If you are wondering whether or not to make it, the answer is YES! Make it! It's insanely easy to make, is really simple to clean up after, and tastes thoroughly divine! I made a bunch of different candy for Christmas and this was everyone's #1 favorite. I cannot recommend it highly enough. I put it out for dessert at Christmas and in Christmas gift plates alongside "Foolproof Chocolate Fudge", "Chocolate Snow Swirl Fudge", "Microwave Oven Peanut Brittle" (a recipe I played with and made Microwave Cashew Brittle, Microwave Almond Brittle and Microwave Chocolate Covered Almond Brittle from), and Gingerbread Men. By far, this was everyone's favorite! I did make one alteration and omitted the candied pineapple (just because I didn't have any on hand). It is probably nice with the pineapple, too. But for sure, it is delicious without. I am making a few extra batches of this today to give to other friends because it is SO amazing. Thanks for a great recipe!

very good and easy.  changed a bit due to availability.  used all semi-sweet chips.  omitted pineapple.  used 1 c almonds and 1 c salted peanuts.  also used sweetened coconut.  will make again and try with milk chocolate.
