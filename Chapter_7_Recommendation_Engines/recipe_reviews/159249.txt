This polenta is very tasty.  I used it as a contribution to an appetizer party and everyone raved.  I used cornmeal rather than polenta which should be the same thing and the recipe yield was more than twice the 8 servings the recipe states.  I'm hoping for other reviews so I can see if I did something wrong.  Another thought is that the butter could probably be cut down a lot without harming the result.

This didn't work for me at all. It smells great but it was to soupy.

I can't help but think that the 1-1/4 cups of butter must be a typo. I used 3/4 cup (1-1/2 sticks), and it was plenty. I made a trip to Aldi to pick up some Gruyere cheese, just to make this recipe, but they were all out (seasonal item). I pulled up Google on my phone and found that any Swiss cheese is a suitable substitution for Gruyere, so I purchased a block of baby Swiss and used that. I ended up with more polenta than would fit level in the 8" cake pan. It was slightly mounded up in the pan, and I ended up shaving some of the top off once it was set, so that it made for a flat surface when I turned it out onto the cutting board for slicing. Next time I will use a 9" or 10" springform pan. Both my husband and I agreed that the flavors are similar to the shrimp and grits that we make, so we intend to use the left overs with some sauteed shrimp another night this week.

I agree that the butter should be cut in half. I ended up mopping most of it off.
I  also used  medium grained cornmeal, along with basil versus the sage and added more cheese for excellent results.
Thanks Karen for a great recipe
