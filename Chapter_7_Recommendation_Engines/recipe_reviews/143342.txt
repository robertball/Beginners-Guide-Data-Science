WOW! These were really good burgers. A little hard to handle, and not very pleasing to look at but the taste was 5 stars, easily. EDIT: Wet your hands before you make the patties this helps with the sticky meat.

Totally great!  I did add bread crumbs as well.  Very moist burger with lots of flavour from the taco seasoning.  Great too with the avacado and salsa.  My husband loved them which was great because he is a big red-meat-burger-guy.  Will definitely do again and have passed on to my friends!

I love this recipe.  I make it into taco salad and used tortilla chips with shredded lettuce, cheese, salsa, olives and green onions.  Great salad!

okay so i know it is cheating to add a review to your own recipe but i love it, so i'm gonna give myself 5 stars ;) so, on the breadcrumb issue, if you are cooking these on an outdoor grill i would probably suggest adding breadcrumbs. I left them out to cut out unneeded carbs and calories and just used my George Foreman grill. so just wanted to clarify the reason why there are no crumbs in this recipe. :) thanks everyone for the great reviews and ideas for mixing it up!

I really enjoyed this as did my husband.  I too had to add breadcrumbs to this however as it was very gooey.  I cooked the burgers on my Foreman grill, and dressed them w/lettuce, tomato, onion, pickled jalapenos, salsa & guacamole.  I think this would make a great meatloaf.  You could either add breadcrumbs to it or oatmeal to help bind this together.  If I were making a meatloaf with this I would add some chopped up jalapenos, anaheim chiles and/or some pasillas.  I would also probably top this with a Mexican hot tomato sauce like El Pato (instead of ketchup that some people do with a traditional meatloaf)......

Excellent! Used about 3/4 packet taco seasoning, added 1/2 cup breadcrumbs, fresh minced garlic. Served with guacamole, sour cream and fresh salsa. Family and guests loved it!

We loved these.  I added some bread crumbs to hold together, and served them in folded-over tortillas with a little salsa, cheese and sour cream.  Everyone gobbled them up -- even my super picky daughter!

I've made these several times now and my family LOVES them!  It's such a great healthy substitue to regular hamburgers.  My daughter doesn't like tacos and loves this recipe and my son doesn't tend to like anything but chicken nuggets and loved this meal.  The only thing that I do a little differently is add the jalapenos into the mix for my husband and I's burgers so it gets cooked right in.  Awesome recipe and so easy to cook!!

Delicious and juicy burger!  Added 1/2c of bread crumbs after reading some other reviews.  I did not use the grill. Browned the burgers on the skillet 2-3 mins on each side then transferred to 325 degree oven for 7 mins.  It came out perfectly!  I ended up making 5 patties as it seemed too thick.

Loved these! I used extra lean ground chicken breast, totally omitted the egg....not neccessary, meat is way moist enough. I also sauteed my onion and garlic first, also added a 4 oz. can of diced green chilies and some panko crumbs for binding. Grilled these babies up and served with sliced avacado, pepperjack and some salsa! I went bunless for carb reasons. Tons of flavor here. Thank you!

Delicious!  I used 2 T of taco seasoning spice blend (purchased in bulk at a natural foods store) and added bread crumbs to bulk it up a little.   Topped it with sliced avos and tomatoes, and BBQ sauce and ate with sweet potato sticks (another recipe from allrecipes). Will definitely make again!!

We loved these! It was nice to have something different than typical beef burgers but still have the simplicity of a burger. My husband and I topped ours with green chiles and I added sour cream. Delicious! Our boys just ate them plain, one added cheese. These are versatile and easy and just plain good.

Great burg! I make "Mexican" chix burgs that are very similar--the avocado, i mix with a bit of mayo to spread on the buns instead of sliced on top of the meat; we use our Foreman grill as well. Might try this on the char-grill sometime. Thanks mwiessner for this tasty alternative to beef burgs! This is a fun meal, especially for a group of teens  ;O)

Made these for my husband and he said they are a "5". Unlike other people, I didn't add any breadcrumbs and, although the burgers were pretty loose when we put them on the barbecue, they firmed up quickly and stayed moist. Served on poppyseed buns with avocado slices and salsa to to top. Thanks.

We really liked this recipe.  I put the jalapenos directly into the chicken mixture and I did add a bit of panko crumbs to firm it up a little.  I cooked them on the stove in a little olive oil because we don't grill and they were beautiful.

I enjoyed these. The addition of the egg made for a softer burger, but I liked it. I forgot to add the avocado , but have leftovers for dinner tonight so I'll remember to add it. I cooked mine on a stove top grill pan..

Loved these burgers! I used ground turkey, added some bread crumbs, and topped my burger with chipotle hot sauce. So yummy! My 3 very picky girls thought they were better then beef burgers!

Fixed as written except omitted the egg and the bun and the fixings as we don't eat our burgers on buns. The burger stayed together without the egg. The flavor was tasty. Will keep this in my burger rotation.

What a neat recipe idea for something different with chicken! This is the moistest chicken burger I ever had. Made the burger as written. Though gooey and sticky, I did not add bread crumbs as some did. Grilled it on my George grill and it turned out just right! Will definitely made again soon.

I tend to find a recipe, make it once, and then move on to the next thing. It's not that the recipes aren't good, I just hardly repeat myself. But, this one I make again and again.  Love it! I also use my George Foreman grill to make them.

This was something different for a change of pace.  The burger tasted just like taco meat.  I question the need for an egg.  Ground chicken is mushy enough as is and adding the egg would have turned it into gloppy mess.

Good solid recipe.  I was worried b/c the meat mixture was so wet, but the burgers turned out nice and moist.

Very nice - the girlfriend brought home a pound of ground chicken, so I was thinking "What am I going to do with this?"  This recipe fit the bill!  As some of the other reviewers noted, as written, the burgers are very wet, so count on adding in 1/2 cup of bread crumbs.  We will be doing this again throughout the summer.

Excellent!  pretty much followed recipe, but did add 1/4 cup of bread crumbs as others said to do. Added Alphafa sprouts and jalepeno cheese with a couple slices of avocado for hubby and me.  For kids I actually chopped up burger and threw it in a tortilla added ched cheese and chopped tomatos.  Kids loved it!  will definitely make again.

Great recipe!  I forgot to add the taco seasoning while mixing the ground chicken with the other ingredients so I sprinkled it on top, still turned out great.  I took advice from others and added bread crumbs.  Will be using this recipe again! Thank you!

This was a great, easy, healthy dinner.  Both of my young daughters (5 and 2) loved it.  I didn't grill the burgers -- I cooked them on the stove and they were very tasty. Thanks!

This was a nice quick summer sandwich.  Easy to make.  I used my gas grill.  The kids liked the fact that they could build their own.  Everything was good.  My patties were a little too wet for the grill.  They had kind of crumbled while flipping.  Despite appearance, they were quite tasty.

Just made this for dinner tonight and it rocked!! I did have to add in a small amount of bread crumbs, as my mixture was too wet to hold together (I grind my own chicken).  The taste was amazing. I put them on sesame bun with jalapeno slices.

I did use bread crumbs as other suggested, still quite sticky, but I managed. Amongst the bread crumbs, I also crushed up some tortilla chips and used them with the bread crumbs as I thought they might step up the flavour a bit, so all together a 1/2 cup per batch.  Did not use the jalapeño pepper but I did buy jalepeno monterary jack cheese to put on top of burger.  These were delicious!!  Will definitely become a regular meal.

Made this for dinner tonight.  Had a pkg of ground chicken and needed a recipe for what to do with it.  I used fresh garlic(wasn't sure if it was to be fresh or the dried).  I also added 1/4 cup plain breadcrumbs, as others suggested, with the egg. This made 4 big patties.  I cooked them indoors on an electric griddle.  I did lightly toast the buns as suggested, I think it adds a nice touch. Topped them with the pepperjack cheese, salsa, lettuce, sliced avacado and french fried jalapenos.  They were so moist and flavorful!  This recipe is a keeper !  Thanks for sharing!

Very good and easy. To the ground chicken I added one egg, about a cup of bread crumbs, taco seasoning and a pinch of salt and pepper and formed into patties. I grilled the patties on the stove and then melted cheese on top just before serving. I made a guacamole/salsa spread and topped burgers with fresh lettuce and tomatoes. Really great way to eat ground chicken!

No salt, the taco mix covers that. It was very gooy, but I just spooned it onto my griddle and shaped with the spoon.

Followed recipe exactly, but cooked in a frying pan. I had to flip them very carefully, but burgers held together nicely. This is the best non-beef burger we have ever had. Will definitely make these again and again.

We really enjoyed this! My husband, my brother and I all tried different toppings. We did have pepperjack cheese or avocado so we all had american cheese. I had peach salsa and sour cream, my brother had creamy ceaser dressing, and my husband had creamy basil ranch dressing. We loved our burgers!

This was a great recipe!  so easy and tasty, as others suggested I added 1/2 c. breadcrumbs.  I had to leave out the onion unfortunately cause my kids don't like the taste of onion, next time I'll make one with onion just for me!  we melted cheddar on top, very delicious!  Oh ya, and grilled on the Foreman grill, no fat dripping at all! Yay!! Thanks for the great recipe!  it's a keeper!!

My family loved these burgers!  Usually I buy the pre-formed ground chicken patties and just season them before cooking, but never again.  I made these on the spur of the moment and didn't have any of the suggested toppings on hand.  Even just topped with mayo and mozzarella cheese, they were delicious!  Like others suggested, I added 1/2 cup bread crumbs.  I cooked them in a skillet instead of on the grill.  The burgers were tasty and moist, and even my daughter (who doesn't like onions or tacos) said they were great.   I can't wait to make these again once we have the grill gassed up and ready to go!  Thanks!

This is a really tasty treat.  I added green chilis to the meat too.  Really good and I don't like meat.

Really good!  Easy too!  I've made these twice and will keep this one in my recipe box.  I added some bread crumbs because I found the mixture was a little wet.  Great flavour.

These were quite good!  My boyfriend kept saying how he hates ground chicken, but he ate two of them!  I added some sour cream and only used 2 egg whites.  Even though it is a very wet mixture, I cooked it indoors (without using bread crumbs) on a grilling pan and had no problem.  Delicious!
