Made this tonight for dinner. It was great! Everyone loved it, Even my kids who are very,very picky. It was easy to cook and delicious, I did however only use 2 tablespoons of butter, But other than that it was perfect.

The recipe was good and i will make again, but for anyone trying to make this, Progresso has discontinued the whole line of recipe starters so i used campbells slow cooker tavern pot roast sauce it was just fine. Progresso put the recipe on here i think they should have taken down or modified it when they discontinued the sauces. I see a lot of these recipes on here calling for recipe starters,  Don't waste your time just modify from the start.

We had to substitute a few things for budget reasons. We found a less expensive steak, used regular mushrooms instead of portobellas, and used cream of mushroom soup instead of the package sauce. It still turned out incredible! I think my daughter added a little more wine to help thin the sauce a little (yes, my 16 yo made this).

This was simple and great tasting! I didn't have any white wine on hand so I used chicken stock. I also in the middle of cooking realized I ran out of creamy mushroom cooking sauce so I made homemade cream of mushroom and it turned out awesome! (To make your own cream of mushroom you just need 8 oz evaporated milk, 2 tablespoons cornstarch, 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, 1/8 tsp white pepper, 1/4 tsp salt and 1 or 2 handfuls of sliced fresh mushrooms. Blend and then microwave for 3 mins.) My young kids and parents loved it!

I couldn't find the Progresso recipe starter so I used Swanson cream starter traditional, 1 T. worcestershire, 1 teaspoon each of garlic,onion and paprika powders and beef broth to taste (1/2 a can). The husband loved it :) Great recipe

Very delicious! Used a can of mushroom soup and white wine. Poured the sauce over only 2 ribeye steaks. Also doubled the mushrooms. Husband loved it!
