LOVE this cake!  I suggest only a couple of modifications, but if you can't make the changes, make this cake anyway because it is a real crowd pleaser.  First, use Demerara sugar instead of brown sugar if you can. It's usually found in regular grocery stores, next to the other sugars, and it doesn't cost much more.  It's is a light brown sugar that provides a stickier texture and a really rich aroma-- perfect for this cake.  Second, marinate the candied fruit in the brandy for as long as you can.  You really want the fruit to be plump.  Third, follow the directions for a long baking time in low heat.  Don't try to speed things up by increasing the temperature (like I once did...)!  Fourth, top with Royal Icing-- there are some very good recipes for it on this website.  Royal Icing is a bit tricky to work with, but it's worth the effort!

I've been making fruitcakes for several years, dutifully wrapping them in liquor-soaked cheesecloth which I refreshed on a regular basis.   Well, all I can say is 'Thank you Carol!  I'll never soak a fruitcake again!'  

This is the most moist, delicious fruitcake I've ever eaten.  No need to wrap in cheesecloth.  I do recommend letting it 'mellow'.  I soaked my fruit for a full 24 hrs. rather than overnight.  I also mixed some dark rum in with the brandy.  
Being allergic to nuts, I omitted them and slightly increased my fruits.  I baked in a tube pan, too.  Anyway, the yummiest fruitcake around and it will make a believer out of the most vocal critic.

>>>>>>>>>>>December 2010 update:  Used Grand Marnier to soak the fruit this year and Muscovado sugar.  Increased my dates to abt. 1.5 cups.  Didn't think it was possible, but even yummier this year!

I made this recipe about 6 weeks before christmas and then resisted eating it until then.  This is truly the best Christmas cake ever!  It is really rich and moist.  It did make a lot and I had to put it in a 26cm or 10inch square tin which fit perfectly.  We thought we would never get through it it was so huge but it was gone within a week or so.  It was so delicious.  

As my husband is allergic to almonds I substituted brazil nuts which worked just as well.  

I let the cake cool in the tin with a teatowel over the top to keep the moisture in then when it was cool I basted it in brandy and wrapped up in greaseproof paper and tin foil.  

Also for all you Aussies, after hunting around shops looking for Molasses with no luck I did some research on the net and found out that what they call molasses in the US is what we call treacle over here - if they ask for blackstrap molasses then that is what we call molasses. Hope that helps when you find it hard to find molasses on the shelf in Aus.  

Will definately be making it again this year (and also planning on making smaller ones for gifts keeping the big for myself of course)- can't wait!

I made this cake a couple weeks ago, I won't be trying it till xmas so I will update my review then. I left out the cinnamon and cloves and just used the allspice/mixed spice, my house smelt of mollases/treacle for days!!due to the 3/4 cup of it that went in, I have a funny feeling this will be way too strong a flavour and smell for me as all of the other recipes I have seen only call for a couple tablespoons of mollases!! but, I will let you know, I will obviously marzipan(almond paste/icing) and ice/frost the cake and decorate it, couple weeks before exmas I will skewer the cake in several places and poor over brandy and whisky (more for the flavour and kick rather than moistness) as I think this may be a moist cake anyway. I will report back after exmas or just after the first few comments on the cake. Hope it's good, it took 3hrs 35 mins to cook. UPDATE, after 2.5 weeks I took it out of the air tight container and unwraped it from the double layer of tin foil and layer of greaseproof and it smells gorgeous, no more mollases smell just a lovely traditional english christmas cake smell, almost like christmas pudding!! I skewered 5o times and poured over a tbls of each whisky and brandy.Update: Very moist but may add double the mixed spice next year. NOTE: this is for an 8" square cake if you use a round pan you must use a 9" one!! an 8" round fits exactly onto an 8" square one, so, you must allow for the corners (thats why a 9" round is needed)

I tried this cake last Christmas.  It was the best, ever.  I used apricot brandy. I did not feel icing was necessary.  I will most definitely make this cake again.  Thanks so much for sharing it!

This recipe is awesome!  The first year I've used it, I got several compliments from family and friends. The second year, I gave cakes away as gifts.  Now people wait for it every Christmas.  I have my great aunts - who are great cooks and bakers themselves and who are very critical about other people's cooking who actually want this recipe for themselves. Thank you for having shared it. I never thought making fruitcakes could be so fun and rewarding!

Thank you Carol for sharing a great recipe.  I have been on the look out for a simple and good recipe for quite some time now.  This cake turned out perfect, just the way I like it.  Since I have a convection oven, I reduced the temperature by 25 degrees and my cake was done is 2 hours and 45 minutes.  Thanks for sharing the recipe with so many readers.

After converting this recipe to metric I then poured the dry ingridents into Australian measuring cups. My husband helped, so we had two people ensuring the QA process, though if it goes wrong, blame the chef, not the recipe!! or me!! 2 1/2 cups glace cherries - not chopped; 1 1/2 cups mixed citrus peel; 2 cups raisins ;1 cup currants ;1 1/4 cup sultanas (substitution for dates); 1 1/4 cup slivered almonds; 120 ml brandy; 1/2 cup flour for the dredging; 2 cups flour for the batter; 1/2 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda (same as baking soda); 1/2 teaspoon cloves - I sub with ginger spice instead cloves too strong;1/2 teaspoon all spice - I add 1 teaspoon 1/2 teaspoon cinamon - I add one teaspoon ;1/2 teaspoon of salt; 250g butter, as I could not be bothered leaving behind the 25 grams - your choice;3 cups brown sugar; 6 eggs; 180ml treacle - same as molasses; 180ml apple juice - little tetra packs handy size to buy. Pleased double check ingredients against original recipe and for the spices please use your taste buds as some may require more. As there is heaps of batter use non stick baking paper to extend above the side of the tins, go at least 5cm as it does raise pretty high. Also from my experience it took about 3.5 hours in a fan forced oven. I based this on a 20cm round pan.

I've used this recipe for my Christmas cake for the past three years and have had nothing but compliments.  Have found using nutmeg instead of allspice gives better flavour.  Make early and dredge in brandy weekly for best results!

This recipe turned out beautifully, EXCEPT that it made double the cakes it said (which is why I've given 4 stars instead of 5).  I'm not sure why no one else has mentioned this, but I ended up with 2 8" cakes, not 1.  I was pouring and the batter was spilling over the top of the pan and I still had tonnes left, so had to stop, scoop out some batter and start filling a new pan.  Anyway, because of the "bonus" cake, I was able to taste-test this morning, and it does taste divine.  I'm going to be marinating with a variety of liquors every few days until Christmas, so I'll be able to taste the difference over the weeks, and know just how good the cake I'm giving to my sister will be.   Not sure why I'm the only one to end up with 2 cakes, but I hope you've got an extra cake pan around in case this happens to you.

We are English so icing and marzipan were a must on this deliciously moist cake.  I started making it at the beginning of December and soaked the fruit in brandy for two days.  I was unable to get currants so added more raisins.  Three hours in the oven and it was cooked to perfection.  I stored it for a couple of weeks then covered it with almond paste and icing.  A ribbon around the edge, a santa, angel and christmas tree made it look seasonal.  Thank you Carol; this is my first go at making a Christmas cake (should not admit that, but it is) and I felt like Chef Ramsey when my husband said "This is so scrumptious, can I have another piece?."

I made this recipe today and loved it. However, I admit I did change what fruits I added. I left out the citron instead adding a cup of dried cranberries and a cup of candied pineapple that I snipped into smaller pieces. I also add a lot of nuts in addition to the almonds. I added 1/2 cup each of pecans, chopped walnuts and chopped hazelnuts. I added the zest of a lemon to the dry ingredients, and to the apple juice mixture I added a tsp of vanilla, and 1T of Grand marnier. Because of the extra ingredients, I added an extra 1/4 cup of flour to the flour that was mixed with the fruits and nuts. I did not change the batter quantities at all except I used extra large eggs instead of large eggs. Finally, while it was baking, I opened the oven door at every 1 hour interval or whenever the top looked dry, and brushed on a Basting liquid of 1/2c of apple juice plus 2T of Brandy +2T of Grand Marnier and 1/4 cup whiskey. This cake looks and smells delicious, but I will not taste it until a month from now. I have looked online at many other recipes, and I think this is the best. Thanks for submitting!

I made this Christmas cake last year for my husband who is obsessed with Christmas cake. He (and I) loved it!  I used the exact recipe except I used gluten-free all-purpose flour (had no problems with texture or crumbling).  I soaked the fruit in brandy for a week, baked the cake around Halloween, and fed it 2 tablespoons of brandy every week.  About 2 weeks before Christmas I covered the cake with apricot jam,  homemade marzipan, then with homemade sugar paste one week later.  My British in-laws tried some when they visited in March and gave rave reviews.  I will begin the process again this weekend and plan to make several cakes to give as gifts.

This was my first time making fruitcake and I could not be happier with the results! I used golden raisins but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It makes a lot - I filled 2 loaf pans plus the 8x8 pan. It was delicious right out of the oven but much better soaked in brandy and stored wrapped in waxed paper and foil to allow to 'ripen'. Reminds me of my mom's fruitcake I loved as a kid. Thanks for sharing.

This was my first time making fruit cake and it was delicious! I omitted the citrus peel (husband and I don't care for citrus peel) and substituted candied pineapple. I also omitted the currants and dates and used extra raisins to save a bit of money. I used apple juice in place of brandy. I definitely want to make this again next year for Christmas.

Everyone loved this.  My only change: soaked the fruit in rum, then drizzled about 1/3 c brandy over the cake just prior to storage.  Stored for 2 weeks wrapped in waxed paper in a tin in my fruit cellar.  This will change everyone's mind about the dreaded fruitcake.

Very moist and full of flavor.  I made it for Christmas and New Year, and all my friends loved it.  The only change I made the second time was instead of using molasses and juice, I used mincemeat and port wine because the taste of molasses was too strong (for me) the first time.  Definitely a keeper.

just emigrated from uk and left my usual recipe in uk, so even though late for me to do cake (nov) i chanced this one. What excellent results, the only change i made was instead of 2 cups raisins used 1 cup of sultans in place, and as late making it i dosed with brandy every few days up until christmas. Its been eaten already and theres only the two of us. (wheres the nearest gym)
Now the 3rd year of making this cake, I made a mistake and bought prunes instead of dates. Wow its even better. Only November and one cake already gone, lucky I made 3 by doubling up.

I've been meaning to review this recipe for a while - it's wonderful!  I made this in November ready for our solstice celebration in December...and we're still eating it in March!  This is quite a lot of work (but that appeals to me), and certainly isn't "cheap" to make, but the number of servings it provides and the fact that it keeps brilliantly in the pantry means it is excellent value for money and well worth the effort.

This is THE best Christmas cake ever! I grew up in the UK and have had many Xmas cakes and loved this the most.  I made it a month before serving which is short but it still turned out flavourful.  I cooled the cake and then poked holes with a skewer and poured 1/4C of brandy before wrapping up and storing in a cool place.  I repeated the process twice more.  I then put marzipan icing, let dry and topped off with fondant icing and decorations.  I was iffy about how it would be received by Americans since I think English Christmas cakes are an acquired taste but EVERYBODY loved this cake!  So it's really worth the effort.  I'm going to make mine in Sept. next year and I'm also going to make one for my Irish mum for her to keep till Christmas!  It's moist, dark, spicey, and really full of flavour! Very best!!

Everyone loved this.  I made about 4 weeks before Xmas- wrapped it up good and tight and every week I would open it and poke wholes in it with a toothpick and pour a cap full of brandy over it.  I don't eat Christmas cake but everyone loved it.  Said it was so moist and tastey.

This is an excellent recipe.  I made it 4 times last xmas, varying the fruit and spices each time.  I even substituted the brandy with other liqueurs.  As long as you maintain Carol's proportions, you really can't go wrong.

This was my first time making Christmas cake, I only made it so my husband, who loves it, wouldn't go and buy one. And it is really good, but be warned it makes a huge amount, I didn't have a pan that would fit so I used two. There's so much we'll probably be eating it until March, but it keeps getting better with age!

The only difficulty is to gather all the ingredients. Apart from this, it's an easy, full of flavor recipe, very suitable for Christmas present. It makes 3 medium-sized cakes.

Awesome. With a chef for a partner it can be a little hard to impress. But, "great cake babe" summed it up. Thanks Carol, followed your recipe to the letter. Did have a little mixture left but  they made yummy muffin style "mini 
chrissy cakes" for "play lunch"

Love this! I have made this for my Christmas party 3 years in a row and everyone loves it! Someone who had it two years ago was still talking about it when I met her recently. I reduce the sugar by at least half - it is more than sweet enough with all the fruit. And I add candied ginger.

This Christmas cake rocks! I made it last year and it was gobbled up by the family in record time. This year I am gonna do some different fruit- dried cherries, cranberries, dates, currants, kiwi, and candied ginger. I'm sure it will be delish. Thanks for the great recipe!

absolutely delicious! I added a little more brandy to the fruit than listed and soaked the fruit for a couple days before making the cake. I covered the cake with marzipan 3 weeks before Christmas and then covered that with royal icing a week before.  I am not a fruitcake fan but I loved this cake.

This is a WONDERFUL recipe!!  I made this recipe the first week of November for my 82 year old father. He loves fruit cake.  I gave it to him at Thanksgiving and by Dec 12 it was almost gone!  I'm in the process of making a second batch.  I took advice from others, paid extra and included dried cherries and some apricots.  Dried cherries have an excellent flavor, and candied cherries are more for the appearance.  In my opinion, both are necessary.  I also omitted the citrus peal---yuck! (This is why most people hate fruit cake.) I also soaked the fruit for a week in bourbon.  I don't think you could do this wrong.  I also added peach Schnapps, since I had it.  As the week went on, and the fruit become plumper, I added more alcohol.  I also added pecan pieces and some walnut pieces.  As suggested, I also only used about 1/2 of the "dough" so the fruit & nut concentration was higher.  Turned out great!  Lastly, I made this into 5 different size loaves.  A couple were slightly larger than a cup cake.  Make sure to keep some pecan halves and candied cherry pieces to decorate the top of the cake!  Just excellent!

Update: I've made this recipe over 3 Christmas now. I've halved the flour quantity in order to have a more fruity cake. Will keep this one going. Yummy!As my partner is not a fan of the glazed cherries I used dried cherries (pretty expensive, but worth it!)and it tastes lovely.I'm pouring 2tbsp of Brandy on each cake every 2 weeks.I don't think it needs any icing either as it's delicious as it is.Hope it lasts till xmas.Thanks Carol!

Fantastic recipe!  This came out perfect, everyone in my family was obsessed with it at Christmas last year. I just thawed the portion I'd frozen to enjoy over the summer and it still tastes amazing.  (I soaked my fruit overnight in brandy btw)

Best Christmas/fruit cake recipe I've found ever. I keep to the weights of fruit and nuts but replace the whole lot with whatever dried fruit I've got at the time due to family allergies. Also I hate candied peel so use zest of a lemon and orange instead. You can soak the fruit for as long as you like, personally I soak mine in about a cup of port for a few months before cooking and then after cooking regularly baste the cake with port and masala for a few months before eating. Have some sitting here beside me in August that is still delicious from last years 6 cake effort baked in October, the longer you soak the longer it'll keep! Delicious!!

I made this cake for the first time last year. Instead of I big cake though I made five smaller cakes which made excellent presents. I love this recipe and everyone who received a cake for christmas wants another one this year.

I make this cake every year as it was a huge success the first year I attempted it. I made a few changes though, 3/4 molasses sounded too strong so i halve it and put an equal amount of summer fruit jam, i also add ginger and dried papaya and chopped karithaki (a sweet walnut, Greeks will know what i'm talking about). I also drenge it with brandy every couple of days up to icing day. Excellent recipe.

This is an incredible Christmas cake recipe. I made the cake this past November(2011). The only thing I added. After the cake had cooled, I poked holes down through the top with a chopstick & spooned brandy over the top so it ran into the holes. A week later I dribbled more brandy into the holes & then again after another week. I'm British so I know good fruit cake. Even though we usually make our fruit cakes months ahead of Christmas, this cake was excellent in just a couple of weeks. Thanks Carol for sharing this recipe. I thought my regular recipe was unbeatable but believe me when I say that your recipe will be the only one I will be using from now.

My first Christmas Cake ever. Instead of molasses I used half/half golden syrup/treacle (live in the UK). Turned out great. My husband said it's better than any he's ever had, even his mums :))) I must say it's a bit dense but I like that about it. You'd want a rich, dense Christmas cake if you've got the Christmas spirit.

This is the recipe I have been looking for!  It is the best Christmas cake ever; very moist dark and rich looking.  We couldn't resist taste testing it as I was basting it with brandy & the family loved it; hopefully there will be some left for Christmas.  It will definitely become our traditional Christmas/wedding cake.  As suggested by someone, I substituted demera sugar for the brown sugar and loved it.  I did use a slightly larger cake pan and found it cooked in the given time.

I've never made Christmas Cake before but decided to give it a go this year.  This recipe is fantastic.  I made two cakes - one is stored away for Christmas and we've already eaten the first cake.  I made no changes and found the recipe really easy to follow.

Because of this cake I've become the fruit cake maker in the family...I did some modifications - minced & soaked my fruits overnight in brandy & after baking I sprinkle brandy or rum a couple of times on it.  Also, try using a few cups more fruits - leave the rest of the ingredients as it.  You can never have too much fruits in a fruit cake

I am really happy that the cake is moist but it is definitely a little different to the traditional English Christmas cake I was hoping for. Not as dense or flavoured! May be it will change as it hibernates. I like soaking the fruit in Brandy overnight. Also my toothpick came out clean but it wasn't done. I put it back twice! The toothpick thing usually works for me. If anyone can refer me to a good Christmas cake more like what I'm used to please do.  One more thing I made it to serve "11" and it was still too much for my 8" round! If anyone else has one. If it changes I will update.

This cake is fabulous!! I love the molasses in it. I omitted the nuts because I don't care for them and added a little extra fruit. I make it every year and highly recomend it.

I switched the dates for sultanas and added a little cherry brandy in addition to the brandy that the fruit absorbed overnight.  I haven't tasted the cake yet but it looks and smells wonderful.  Thanks for sharing, this one is a keeper.

This cake tastes wonderful, we'll  be eating it for a while but it keeps well.  I decorated it with almond paste and fondant icing.

Made this cake last christmas and with all the additions of nuts I added I am able to make two cakes of 9" pans. The reviews of this cake was endless!! Here are my changes due to my love for nuts and dislike of cherries, mix citrin fruits and currants. I used my own home made orange rind minced fine also orange flavoured cranberries..also used 3-4 cups dates. Addition to the almonds added another 4-5 cups of Brazil, pecans, hazelnut and walnuts..Doubled the seasoning. This cake for me bakes nicely within 2 1/2 hours at 250 degrees. After 2 hours I check to see how it is with a tooth pick or fine knife.

The house smells great! I already had a piece right out of the oven and it's pretty good. But I had to modify a bit because I don't have access to molasses so I increase brown sugar and add maple syrup. Also don't have candied citrus so I used dry apricot instead. Next time I will add a bit more spice maybe additional half a teaspoon each at least to intensify the flavor. The recipe makes 2 loaves and a low 6 inch cake for me, with baking time only 60 minutes.

Really yummy cake, moist and packed densly with fruit. As previously mentioned, I also did get more than 1 cake with this recipe, however, it might be because i used a 8 X 8 X 2 inch pan rather than a 3 inch one. At least I got to taste it before it is served during christmas.

Would have prefered a stronger brandied flavour, so I will moisten it with more brandy before christmas.

I made fruitcake for the first time in November; this was one of two recipes I worked from and is the one I'll return to next time. I did make some changes. I used dried cherries and fresh orange peel instead of candied, and I sprinkled the cake with brandy before wrapping it. Cake was a little on the gooey side; maybe I should have baked it a little longer, or maybe cut back on the apple juice to compensate for the added brandy? But I was very happy with the result anyway.

This recipe is great. It takes a lot longer to cook (for me) than what is recommended but if you're patient, it'll come out great. I made it adhering t other users' comments about demerara sugar and soaking fruit overnight, but other than that, i kept all other ingredients exactly as written. I made it last year and although i don't christmas cake it myself, others looooved it. Made it again today for my parents, and it looks lovely.

I have made this cake for the last 6 years and it never disappoints! Friends and relatives look forward to receiving a mini Christmas cake yearly and were quite disappointed when I said I wasn't making cake that year. I had to reverse my decision! The only change I make is changing the almonds for walnuts due to my daughter in law having an allergy. Still the best ever!

made this cake in the last week of October, and have waited patiently to taste it! It's great, although next year I'll put in a smaller amount of cherries...but that is a personal taste thing.

I substituted a number of things - marg for the butter, powdered egg replacer for the 6 eggs, soy & rice flour for the wheat. I decided there was too much cloves so cut that down to 1/4 tsp, and doubled the cinnamon to 2 heaping teaspoons. I mixed 1/2 cup dark rum and 1/2 cup brandy and poured that over the fruit and let marinade for over 24 hours. I also substituted 1/2 cup orange juice with 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice instead of the apple juice. I divided the recipe between two Teflon bunt pans. Convection baked at 275° for 2 1/4 hrs. Then I poured 1 cup of mixed rum & brandy over the cakes when cool. Was delicious! Falls apart with the flour substitute but sure tastes great.

This is the third year we are making the cake.
The only change we made was soaking the fruit for two days in double the amount of Brandy.
For those who are interrested you can store for a year adding a little brandy every 2nd to 3rd month.
People love this cake - enjoy with a healthy dollop of whipped cream!!

This is the dark rich fruit cake from my childhood. I cooked it in an 8"x8" pan. Then I wrapped it in plastic wrap, foil and put it in a plastic container in the dark for 1 month. The result was awesome!

I must have done something wrong. The butter/egg mixture curdled. I had to add a LOT more flour than called for otherwise it was just a liquidy gooey mess (but with all that fruit and brandy in it, I wasn't going to give up!) It tasted okay, but was quite dry. I also used two loaf pans instead of one larger pan. WHAT did I do wrong???

Made it for the last 3 years.  I found the best way to decide on if it's cooked properly is using a thermometer and cook till 95 degrees Celsius.  
Last year it was a little undercooked even though I used a wooden pick that was clean.  Also cooked for about an extra 1.5 hours than indicated.  This makes the best fruit cake.  I now make 3 cakes because friends enjoy it.

I’m making this cake for the second time, last year it came out beautifully, even though I just gave it 4 weeks to mature.
Very moist and flavourful, loads of compliments!
I love walnuts in a fruitcake so used those instead of almonds.

I made this a few days ago and followed the recipe Very closely with a few minor additions.  I added walnuts as well as sliver almonds and I also added some dried cranberries to the fruit mix.  Because of the added fruit and nuts I added an extra egg and increased the proportions of all other ingredients by about an 1/8th. 
I also followed the recommendation of another reviewer to lower the oven temperature a little for a convection oven.  I did that about 45 into the baking process.  I also added a pan of hot water to the lower rack in the oven to keep the oven heat somewhat moist.  
I used square cake tins that my grandmother passed on to me and I filled them quite high. One large (9” square) and one medium (6” square) pan.  Photos attached.  It took 3.5 hours to bake. I had both pans side by side with a gap between to allow heat distribution. 
I won’t get to taste these for a while until they age, at least a month or two.  I poured the strained juice from soaking the fruit over the cakes once they had cooled slightly.  Then wrapped in plastic after they were completely cooled and now refrigerated.  
Over all an easy recipe to make and very similar to others I have done in the past.  From the smell and appearance they turned out perfect.

I made this recipe as suggested. I served offered slices at an Office party.They loved it.  One  person who is a commercial baker raved over it and wanted the recipe. As always while many liked it very much others don't like any kind of fruit cake.

I would like to give this 10 stars.  I made it a week ago, I poured some brandy on it as it was cooling. I tried it the next day amazing. I did add a bit of mace and nutmeg as I like these spices.  Next year I will make this in October!  Thanks for sharing.

I made this exact to the recipe... I think American cake dishes are bigger than U.K. ones as I needed two of the recommended size pans to make this!! It was a little dry, so maybe a little milk is required in addition. Apart from that it was very easy to make and turned out well

This is absolutely GREAT! I did make a few changes....Did not use any citrus, added about 1 cup of chopped pecans, used watery apple sauce in lieu of apple juice, and did not frost. I did bake it in a bundt pan, which was a little tough to handle, so next time I'll do two loaf pans.

Cake was amazing and everyone ate it up! I recommend this recipe!

My cakes turned out really nice and moist.  The only changes I made are instead of 2 cups of raisins I put 1 cup as I don't like them very much and instead of 2.5 ozs of Slivered almonds I added another 2.5 ozs of chopped walnuts as I like my cake more nutty.  I found the cake a little too sweet so next time  I will lessen the brown sugar.

I love this cake and make it every year.  However, I do make changes so that it resembles the one my grandmother use to make when I little.  I use only the raisins, currants, dates and 1 cup of prunes.  All of those are then processed through a grinder to give the cake a certain texture.  No icing and 1 cup of brandy.

My first time making a Xmas cake and this recipe is really good.  I left out the almonds and used walnuts instead.  Next time I will add green candied cherries.  I'm not the biggest Xmas cake fan, but this recipe is too good to ignore.

This fruit cake was great.  I used pecans for the nuts and rum for the alcohol. I used 3 loaf pans and baked them for 1 hour and 15 min.  I would only use 2 loaf pans when I make it again.  I have 2 of them aging.  The other one has been eaten.  It was better each day it aged.  Will make it again.

This recipe used spices I really like to use in baking.  I use allspice quite a bit.  Also the molasses makes this cake unique.  I used Apple cider instead of apple juice.  I prefer to use more dried fruit instead of the glacé fruit.  I reduced the heavily sugared glacé fruit and added more dried fruit such as dried apples and apricots.  Buying a food scale has made all the difference in my baking and I ended up with 3 pounds of fruit altogether.  I am a traditionalist and wanted a recipe that reminded me of the fruit cakes I ate as a child.  The best part of baking fruit cakes is that as bakers we can make changes and it still comes out great!  Happy Holidays!

This recipe used spices I really like to use in baking.  I use allspice quite a bit.  Also the molasses makes this cake unique.  I used Apple cider instead of apple juice.  I prefer to use more dried fruit instead of the glacé fruit.  I reduced the heavily sugared glacé fruit and added more dried fruit such as dried apples and apricots.  Buying a food scale has made all the difference in my baking and I ended up with 3 pounds of fruit altogether.  I am a traditionalist and wanted a recipe that reminded me of the fruit cakes I ate as a child.  The best part of baking fruit cakes is that as bakers we can make changes and it still comes out great!  Happy Holidays!

My niece and I have gluten, egg and milk allergies, so I have adjusted the recipe for this and it is still the same as my mom made when I was young.  Thank you

I have made this recipe now 3 years in a row.  I get compliments on it every year.  The only thing I do differently is I make the cake in 2 loaf pans.  I always have difficulty getting the larger round cakes to cook completely.  I cook the loaf pans the same amount of time indicated in the recipe and they come out great!!!
