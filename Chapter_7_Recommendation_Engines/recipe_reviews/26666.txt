This was really good. To keep the meat from getting to wet drain the tomatoes first. I used hot bar-b-que sauce because we like things very spicy. I made the meat into six 4x2 loaves instead of one big loaf they cook in about 25-30 minutes and each person gets their own. Also I made a well in the top of each one and filled with a mixture of sour cream and picante sauce and then topped with cheese during the last 5 minutes of cooking. The people in my house gave it a thumbs up.

My hubby enjoyed this meatloaf with a definite kick. It may be a little too spicy for very little kids but older kids and teens will love it! It puts a nice twist on an old favorite. It does turn out moist not dry. I used a sweet bbq sauce and that was a good contrast. Will use it again.

I had to decrease the size of the origianl recipe so that may have something to do with it but the meatloaf before baking was very "wet" I had to add additional crushed taco chips and then when the meatloaf was done it was terrible. It tasted like taco chips you couldn't even taste the meat anymore. Would not use recipe again.

Because of the comments about the mixture being too wet I cut back on the BBQ sauce and partially drained the canned tomatoes. Apart from adding a little salt and pepper I made it as written. The result was a very bland crumbly loaf with an uneven mushy texture. I won't be making this again. Thanks anyway.

This was very wet even after I added additional bread crumbs. It fell apart when I was taking it out of the pan. The flavor could be good but it needs to hold together better.

I love how simple your recipe is but I first seasoned the meat with some garlic ginger cumin cilantro and thyme and it was even better!

This is one of the best meat loaf recipes. Make sure you cook it for 90 mins. It will not be to wet

The flavor was fantastic but the texture was sloppy at best. I will make it again but I'll decrease all liquids. I should have known that it wasn't going to hold together by how wet the uncooked "loaf" was. I should have added some breadcrumbs but that's just hindsight.
