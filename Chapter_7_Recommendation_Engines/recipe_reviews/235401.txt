As written, it is 4 stars. No fault to the submitter as she says her children like all the ingredients. I love Potato and Leek soup, and I have tried many recipes. Most of the recipes on here do not include carrots or celery, and I always add them to my soup and have never reviewed any other leek soup recipe because I change it so much. This recipe looks almost how I do it except I usually add a clove or two of garlic, lot's of black pepper and use all chicken stock. After making it, I did have to add some garlic and pepper just to get the flavour we like. I am not sure about the veggie stock though, I used an organic veggie stock that was a very dark mushroom colour, and I should of known by the smell of it I wasn't going to like it very much. But after it was all cooked, I still liked the soup, but next time I'll use a stock I know I like! This is still a great base for a soup, plenty of Leek flavour, very creamy. Just make sure if you use veggie stock, it is one you know and love, otherwise use a good quality chicken stock! I will be making this again, thanks for sharing your recipe. :)

This was great!  I used vegetable broth, and only used 3 potatoes (that's all I had), but it still came out great!  I added a cup of a rice/quinoa mixture at the end and it gave it a nice chewy texture.

I made this with no substitutions.  It's really good, and fairly low calorie despite the cream.  If you feel like altering it, you can do so many things because it's a great soup to begin with.  Yummy!

I loved this after I customized it little bit by only adding veggie stock (no chicken broth) and by also adding cut of sweet corn. Yam!!!!!

Very mild flavour. I ended up adding 1 clove chopped garlic, 4 tsp OXO chicken bouillon, a pinch of white pepper, and three slices partially cooked bacon. It's a good start, but needs more flavour. Reminds me very much of the soup served at the start of a meal when I was visiting people in France.

Made 3X as described, though different proportions of the vegetables. There's a lot of 'wiggle room'  but still  comes out very good.

I’ve made this recipe several times and it’s always delicious. It’s a great base as is. This time i puréed most of the soup but held back a few ladles so there would be some chunks, i used all chicken broth and added some leftover rotisserie chicken in the last 15 minutes. We topped it with shreds cheddar, crumbled bacon and warm Italian bread!

This recipe is so yummy!   The carrot really adds some nice sweetness to the soup. I only added 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream and that was plenty for my taste.

I used 2 cans of diced potatoes instead of peeling, I used all chicken broth, and I used evaporated skim milk instead of cream.  Very  satisfying!  And healthy! This was was the first recipe that I ever bought leeks to make. I will make this soup again, definitely, & I might vary some of the vegetables!
