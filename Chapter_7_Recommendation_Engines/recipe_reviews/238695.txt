So decadent!  I’ve been craving chocolate and this really hit the spot. I made a few substitutions. I used honey instead of agave syrup, walnuts instead of almonds, omitted the cacao nibs, and used Himalayan salt. I also didn’t have medjool dates, so I soaked my regular dates in hot water for 20 minutes, then drained them before adding to the blender.

I loved these.  I will definitely be making it again. I used sea salt instead of regular and tasted much better.

Absolutely delicious! Would've been 5 star perfection if it had coconut or avocado or some kind of oil listed; it's extremely difficult processing dates without a touch of liquid and my kitchenaid processor was not very happy.

great basic chocolate treat - Here's what we did:  we used acorn flour (made from harvesting white oak acorns, soaking and rinsing in cold water for 2-3 days, then coarse-chopping, drying at a low oven temp to preserve the oils, then running them through a grain or coffee grinder to a fine powder) as a substitute for half the cocoa powder, and also for final dusting.  Also we used raw cashews instead of almonds, and maple syrup instead of agave.  Acorns lent a salted carmel/nutty flavor.  Very unique!

I just made this, skipped the syrup and used 1/2cups more dates, they are rich and delicious.
