Best soup Ive ever had!  I added a cup of chopped celery in with onion and leek. Put minced garlic in when steaming the mussels  I also used a cup of clam juice and only a half a cup of chicken broth.  Oh and last but not least a table spoon of red wine vinegar at the end.  Trust me it makes all the difference.

Decided to give this bisque a try and I loved it! The onion-y flavor from the leeks and the fenugreek spice paired very nicely with the mussels. My change to the recipe was using coconut milk instead of heavy cream due to forgetting to buy it. I think it only aided in the flavoring of the bisque. My biggest regret is not buying a baguette to glob up all of that delicious sauce!

Made this and my family and I couldnâ€™t get enough of it. Shared a little with some co-workers and now everyone at work is asking for the recipe. Huge hit with everyone. My family asked for it two weeks in a row.

I didn't have all of the fancy spices because I'm on a tight budget; I only used garlic, butter, olive oil, heavy cream, onions, and, of course, mussels. It still turned out AMAZING. Absolutely delicious.

Wow this is so amazing! I can't shut up about how much I enjoyed this. It was worth an extra trip out to get saffron. I used shallot instead of leek. I also omitted the water because I wanted it to be more like a sauce. There was still plenty of liquid.  I also used 1/4 tsp curry powder because I was out of fenugreek. It didn't taste like curry. It just added to the aroma and depth of flavor. I got lovely mussels from Prince Edward Island and they were delicious. I think this should be served right away because when I went back for seconds the mussels had become a bit mushy. I can't wait to share this recipe with my family. This would also be good with a dry vermouth instead of wine.

Straightforward and excellent. I added a little garlic powder during the step 1 (cooking the mussels in the diluted wine). I used a sweeter German white wine and it was good, though I suspect it would be better with a chardonnay, pinot grigio, torrontes etc. My saffron was a little old, so I added a few extra strands--I think this was quite important to get the color and flavor profile correct--and the fenugreek was a perfect complement to the saffron. Thanks for this recipe; I will ABSOLULTEY make it again.
