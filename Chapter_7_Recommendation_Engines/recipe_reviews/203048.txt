I am new to jicama.  This is so fresh and tasty that I will be preparing it a lot.  I used a fresh orange and added a sweet red bell pepper.  I also added 2 TBS of orange marmalade and the zest from the lime and the orange.  No salt and no pepper.  This is great as a salad, a snack and also tasty over fish or chicken or pork.  I think the word "slaw" probably turns cooks away from trying this.  I'm sure glad I did try it.  Thanks for sharing.  Also, the nice thing about the jicama is that it doesn't turn brown, just stays nice and white!

As it is, tasty and refreshing. I used a regular orange as I had one of those in the fridge. The saltiness was a nice counter to the sweet and sour . I love chili powder on my jicama so I sprinkled a bit on the salad. I liked it even better with that on it!

This is just awesome!!  My first time using jicama and I wasn't sure what to do with it -- except have it with dip.  Then I found this recipe and I'm glad I did!  I did add lemon and lime zests and I used "no sugar added" mandarin oranges and used all of the liquid from the can.  I only had dried cilantro -- I used about a Tbsp and a half or so.  Very yummy!  :D

How did this have 3.5 stars when it only has 1 review that gives it 5 stars? I haven't tried it but am giving 5 just because I almost didn't look at it because it only had 3.5

I love this recipe, but my boyfriend does not, so more for me. I added some ingredients from other variations I found which were 3 T. orange juice, 1 T. lemon balsamic or rice vinegar, 1T. olive oil and 1/4 t. red pepper flakes.

I have made this a couple times and it gets rave reviews.  Instead of chopping the jicama, I put in my my food processor and shred it.  It may be a little more work, but it makes a lot more salad!

This is a good BASE recipe.  I added the chili powder after I made it at one other reviewer's suggestion to help.  I probably won't make it again because no one in my family loved it.  The kids (jicama fans) would not touch it after one bite. They actually asked if they could just eat the brussel sprouts on their plates instead.  It was a weird moment.

love the crunch of jicama! added in red pepper for bright color, red onion for a little bite and a mango, cause that what I had for fruit sweetness. lime and cilantro work with this salad... fresh. next time I'll try shredding jicama, as suggested by others.

My husband and I really liked this, except that really we hardly stayed true to this recipe, so here are my changes: I omitted the lime and cilantro because I didn't have them. I added 1 ripe avocado and red pepper flakes to taste. I mixed it all, so that the avocado blended a little to make the dish creamer. I served this as a side dish to black bean/cheddar/ onion gyro wraps, but actually it tasted great inside the burrito as well. Yum, yum.
