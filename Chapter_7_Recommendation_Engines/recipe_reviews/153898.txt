This is really good as is, and very similar to what I grew up with in Indiana.  The only change I make is adding some chopped giblets from the turkey, along with a little broth they were cooked in.  I've always used white bread because it doesn't compete with the delicate flavor of the oysters. If you never tried oyster dressing, try this one!

I made this stuffing for Christmas dinner this past year and my family LOVED it. My uncle asked if he could take the left overs home and my aunt emailed me asking for the recipe. The only thing I changed was that I added a tube of sweet thyme sausage that I ground and browned first, then cooked the onions and celery in the sausage fat that I drained off of the meat. The sausage made it really robust - almost casserole-like. Warning: it will make your entire house smell like oysters when you make this, so be prepared with good ventilation and lots of candles!

This is a pretty good recipe, but for 8 cups of bread crumbs (I used herb flavored), I added about 2 cups of chicken broth besides the oyster juice from 3 - 8 oz cans of oysters.  You'll want to add enough liquid so that the stuffing is very wet, and give it enough time to really soak into the bread - about 15 to 20 minutes. You could easily add chopped turkey giblets, garlic and about 1/2 cup bell peppers for a little extra flavor.

I think this is the first time I give a recipe a 1/5.  I actually delayed dinner to make this stuff for my husband and all for it to end up in the garbage.  Should have listened to Courtney5Cent on this one, this is beyond extremely dry.  You might as well open a can of bread crumbs and stick like 3 oysters in it and dig in with a spoon because that is what it looked like...oysters drowning in a sea of sand.  I had a feeling too with so much bread crumbs and almost nothing to give this thing moisture.  The liquid from the oysters was no where near enough.  It needs broth or SOMETHING that's liquid to balance all the crumbs but I'm so annoyed at wasting money with this recipe that I'm not going to bother with this again.

This was very good! It was a hit at my Thanksgiving table. I used canned oysters. It was still great.

The flavor was good but this stuffing was EXTREMELY dry.  I used two cans of fresh oysters and even added more water to the stuffing.  I think that maybe more celery might help or definitely less bread crumbs.

I made this Thanksgiving dinner.  I tried to heed the other critiques that stated this was too dry so I added the oyster juice from two cans.  Over kill!  Next time, I'll use 2 cans oysters and chicken broth only for the moisture.  I love oysters, but this was too much.

If I didn't make this stuffing at Thanksgiving, my family would Revolt! LOL.  I have basically the same recipe submitted, congrats Stephanie for getting it published! It deserves 10 stars! I use Stove Top Stuffing and add fresh veggies plus a little poultry seasoning. Perfect!! Thank You Stephanie:)

I adapted this recipe to fit my needs.  I had made an oyster dressing years ago where breadcrumbs were not overwhelming.  To make this recipe work for me,  I added only 1 1/2 cups fresh breadcrumbs. I used a 16 oz container of oysters with all its liquid. Baked at 325 degrees for 45 minutes.   Delicious. It was so good I ate the leftovers for breakfast the next day.

I have been making oyster dressing for some time, this is close but surely the writer omitted the chicken broth, but then when I saw the video it did look dry. This should be a very moist dressing and have the look of golden on top but moist inside. I do.this recipe by look only so can give measurements, but by stirring all the ingredients it should be moister more than when you add water to stove top stuffing. By the  way I also use pepperidge farm herb bread crumbs. Hope this helps. It would be five star if it had the chicken broth.

Agree with Alaena. Something is missing from this recipe. There is either way too much bread crumbs specified or way too little liquid.  I even added a 32 oz. container of stock to add more liquid and it was still too dry.  What a waste of money for the oysters and time to prepare this disaster.

As some others have suggested, it was a little dry. I wound up adding all of the liquid from the oysters, and half again as much onions and celery. The next time I prepare this dish, I am going to add another 8oz can of oysters (for a total of 4 cans)

I had to make a few changes. I used all the quantities indicated in the recipe, but it was a little dry. I added about  1 ,pint of liquid to add to the 8 cups of bread crumbs. Came out great though

I came across this recipe and thought, "well, I can just use my regular dressing recipe and add the oysters." With that said, as far as the bad reviews (which are quite old I know), I wanted to mention that you can use your regular recipe with the oysters maybe adding some Old Bay or the like to spruce up that fish house flavor. I use homemade cornbread (a four inch skillet - about 3 cups of crumbs) with 16 slices of lightly toasted white bread food processed together. With all that bread you will need about 4 cups of stock, or the 2 cans of oyster juice plus stock to equal 4 cups, so that it is nice and moist and doesn't dry out in the oven. As for the stock, the turkey neck and giblets, heart, etc, do not get wasted in this house. Simmer those things in a potful of water with some celery and a bouillon cube or 2 - voila - stock. Makes a great gravy as well!

This recipe did not work at all as is...it was so dry - would have been eating dry bread crumbs if I hadn't moistened it up with a stick of melted butter and broth which actually brought it to a dressing status...
