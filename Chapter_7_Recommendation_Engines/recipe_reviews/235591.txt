I doubled this recipe, and it made 24 in regular muffin pans--more than the recipe indicates but just right for a buffet style party. They tasted ok but not cheesy enough and could've used salt and more pepper. I used foil cups inside the muffin pans and did not use buttered crumbs on the bottom

I wasn't a big fan of how crunchy they were as cups, but this recipe makes amazing Mac & Cheese, so I plan on using it to make a big pan of it. The only thing I changed and would recommend is using Italian bread crumbs instead of plain. The flavor it gives is DELICIOUS!!!!! Honestly I think the Italian breadcrumbs is why I loved it as much as I did!

We loved these! I didn't have any Cheddar Cheese soup so I used Cream of Chicken. Added a little more cheese (bc more cheese is never a bad idea!) and also sprinkled in some garlic salt. Will definitely be making again and again.

Tasty, but the cup bases did not solidify while baking; might need to use a liner next time to make it actual finger food.

I made this for a party that was themed "small bites."  I needed about double the breadcrumbs but other than that I made the recipe as is.  They turned out great!  Creamy, cheesy, got lots of compliments.  I will be making these again soon for my kids.

I added more bread crumbs and used nacho cheese soup. They were even good leftover cold in kids lunches.
