I used reduced fat cream cheese and added a touch of pure vanilla extract. EXCELLENT spread.

Wow! I'm pleasantly suprised at how good this is - it's so incredibly easy with so few ingredients! I cut the recipe in half and added the confectioners' sugar to taste. I processed half the strawberries and chopped a few folding them into the cream cheese mixture as I like them "chunky". This was so good over top fresh bagels and as a fruit dip. I'm sure I'll find many for uses for this - definitely better than store bought.

Great for dipping fruit!  although I found myself without confectioners sugar, so I just blended normal granulated sugar and strawberries first to let the sugar dissolve.  Then I added the cream cheese.  spread turned out nice and smooth.

This turned out great and Hubs will love it on his morning bagel. To help guard against the runniness some have noted I used less strawberries and left them a little chunky rather than processing them.  I also added less sugar, wihich causes fruit to release its juices. Half a recipe was more than enough for the two of us and easy to whip up again quickly if we want more.

I'm a college student without many fancy kitchen supplies, and I just whipped up a bowl of this spread really quikly. I actually finely chopped/diced my strawberries and then added the cubes of softened cream cheese and powdered sugar to the strawberries. Then I stirred for 1-2 minutes on high (aka using some arm muscle strength!). This will be perfect on my bagel before class in the morning. Good recipe that can even be made by dorm cooks! P.S. Mine isn't soupy like many others have said- yay!

Good but a little too sweet. If I were to make it again, I would leave the strawberries a bit chunkier - just personal preference. Thanks!

I used seedless strawberry jam (1/2 cup for a block of cream cheese) instead of fresh strawberries. You can add a drop or two of red food coloring to make it look better; it will be almost tan colored if you use jam. Every kid loves this stuff!

I thought this was far better than what you buy in the tub at the grocery store.  I shaped it into a heart for a lingerie shower and served it with vanilla wafers and chocolate wafer cookies.  Very good!

This was a great addition to my english muffin. I only used 2 teaspoons of confectioners' sugar. It was the perfect amount of sweetness to me. You can always add more but you can't take it away. I blended everything with a fork because I wanted my strawberries a bit chunky. Make sure your cream cheese is at room temperture to make it easier to blend.

This didn't turn out well for me -- it was way too runny, even after refrigeration overnight and immediate serving.  I will try this again sometime -- I really want it to work, and maybe with better strawberries (mine were the washed-out winter grocery store berries) the results will be different.

This is really good. My store had a sale on cream cheese and strawberries so would could resist? I did use this on a bagel, but found myself searching for other things to dip in this as the day went on. Thanks for the post.

This works great, but don't use frozen strawberries!  They contain more water & will make cream cheese runny!  Will try dehydrated berries next time!

It was very, very runny, more like strawberry cream cheese shake... Tasted great though! Does anyone have any advise as to how to make it a more solid consistency? I followed the recipe exactly, cheese was at room temp., blended in my new Hinari Genie (bought specially to make this!). Blended the cheese for about 20 seconds, then added the sugar and finally added the strawberries one by one. Ended up runnier than a smoothie?!? Any ideas?

This spread had good strawberry flavor.  I tasted it after adding just one tablespoon of confectioner's sugar and decided it was sweet enough for me.  I think it would have been too sweet for my tastes if I had added the amount of sugar indicated in the recipe.  My advice would be to taste as you go and keep adding the sugar until you achieve the desired sweetness.

Watery, beware! I should have known when it was fresh strawberries. They still have water content so be careful of this. You may want to dry the strawberries a bit in the oven to get rid of some liquid then blend it. 1 lb of cream cheese couldn't event firm up the 1 cup of fresh strawberries I used for this recipe. Powder sugar didn't help either.

This spread has excellent flavor, but mine did not turn out the consistency for spreading on bagels (and since the submitter states it's good on bagels, I thought this was important to mention).  My daughter suggested freezing it in popsicle molds, and that worked well.  Delicious popsicles.

I found that this is a simple recipe, especially if you have *last minute* guests arriving. The method that I used takes a bit longer, but it does help with keeping the cream cheese from becoming runny. 

To curtail the runny after effect that  can happen:  I mixed the diced fresh strawberries with sugar ( I used 2 tablespoons of Sugar in the Raw) in a bowl until the sugar was mostly combined. Then I let the strawberries sit for about 15 minutes, covering the bowl with a paper towel. After 15 minutes I gently mixed the strawberries again and  poured it into a large strainer with a bowl underneath. I used the back of a large spoon to spread the strawberries  around the inside of the strainer evenly so they could drain (about 5 minutes). If you want to leave your strawberries a bit on the chunky side, be sure not to press down too much or too hard on the strawberries. When most of the liquid was gone from the strawberries ( the juice came out less and less from the bottom on the strainer), I reused the original bowl that the strawberries and sugar were in (cleaned and dry, of course) to combine the strawberries and cream cheese. The extra liquid can be used for flavoring  or added to drinks. I found that a 12 oz. empty whipped cream cheese container was just the right size to store it in.

Since the strawberries were about the same temperature as the cream cheese, it was very easy to mix by hand. Also, by removing most of the juice from the strawberries before mixing them with

This was really good.  Mine turned out a little runny, probably because of the juiciness of the strawberries.  I also added a bit more sugar as I like my cream cheese sweet.

I made this however I used some frozen blueberries I had on hand. Let them thaw and drain at room temperature as with the cream cheese. Placed chunks of cheese in processor, sprinkled the conf sug over the cheese, pulsed, slowly added the thawed and drained BB. Pulsed to my liking to keep some chunks. Absolutely wonderful, not to sweet at all. Thank you

I should have read the reviews on this one prior to making. I processed in my blender and it was too runny. I had to add more cream cheese to thicken it up a bit. I only added a little bit of the sugar, my strawberries were sweet enough. Taste really great on a bagel, I will make it by hand next time and just add the strawberries until it reaches the right thickness. My son was dipping pretzels in it, I tried one and it was pretty good.

Very light and tasty. I finely diced the strawberries and used cultured cream cheese. Then whipped it up in the mixer. This time I omitted the sugar because we ate it with stuffed french toast. Yummy!

I didn't have the strawberries so I used homemade strawberry jam (used about 5 tablespoons and only about a teaspoon of confectioner's sugar).   Awesome!   Will not buy store brand strawberry cream cheese again!

What a wonderful way to jazz up cream cheese. I used a little less sugar than requested and it was perfect.    My spread turned out a little too loose so I tried putting it in the refrigerator but that had little effect in firming it up.  It was still very good.   So simple and so delicious.

Pretty darn good! Next time I would add the strawberries in one at a time, so it doesn't become too runny, as mine turned out.

I like this recipe. It is better than the store bought spread due to the fresh strawberries. Healthier, too, I'm sure. To make it creamier and less runny, I suggest only using a little less than a cup of strawberries. Or use the cup to 1 and 1/2 packages of cream cheese. I substituted a Stevia blend sugar instead of confectioners, and it was great. I will make again, maybe with goat cheese, just to see how it comes out.

Read the reviews about it being liquidy but if you keep mixing, it thickens up. This is sooo good. I was going to Einstein to purchase their spread but mine is soo much better. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!

I made this with dairy free cream cheeze from Daiya, and it was pretty good! I hated the Daiya plain so I made this, but needed to add about triple the amount of sugar to get it palateable

I used frozen strawberries, thawed and drained well. It worked out great - simple and tasty recipe! Thank you!
