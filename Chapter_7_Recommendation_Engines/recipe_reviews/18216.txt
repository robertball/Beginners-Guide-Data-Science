We've made these for years, and they're requested everytime our family gathers.  We add a cup of kethcup, a tbs of molasses, and use 2- 15 oz cans of Bushs Best Beans in place of the 15 oz of baked beans, and they're amazing.

I had a recipe similar to this but I lost it.  These beans turned out pretty good the first time I made them, but the second time I added some ketchup, worchestershire sauce and molasses and that was more like the recipe I remember.  Great for a summer bar-b-q or picnic.

This is my husband's favorite meal!  I have to make it at least once a week.  I do add one teaspoon of dry mustard and instead of lima beans I use baby butter beans.  I have even used chili beans when I didn't have the butter beans.  Basically any bean will do.

I used several kinds of beans and added kielbasa.  Cook on low for several hours in a crockpot.

These were amazing.  From young kids to adults they all loved them.  As other people had mentioned I added 1 cup of Ketchup, a tbs of molasses and 2-15 oz cans of Bushâ€™s Best Red Beans in place of the 15 oz of the pork & beans.  Also I used ground sausage in place of the ground beef.  Definitely a keeper, thank you.

First of all I slow-cooked them for about 7 hrs. When i first blended them I did'nt care for the flavor at all. Too much mustard and sugar. But after simmering for 7 hrs. they greatly improved.

Reduced the amount of the ground beef slightly. Used frozen chopped onions and precooked bacon as timesavers.

I added molasses and a bit more mustard, but it was the hit of the party and people were scooping it into plastic containers to take home before the football game was over.

This is great just as it is but it is also very versital in terms of beans that you have on hand or particular favorites that you prefer. I have made it many times, sometimes cheating on the amount of ground beef & bacon, but it is always a filling hit.

This dish does have a very good flavor, however, it needs to either be served over rice, or as a shepard's pie with mashed potatoes placed on top of the casserole.  The flavor is great but just needed to be served over or with something.  Will make this again, as my husband rhapsodized about it.

Love it.  I cook it on the stovetop - simmer for 30 minutes or so.  I add some water because my first batch turned out thick and pasty.  1/2 cup to 1 cup of water does the trick.  That's in addition to the 1 C ketchup other reviewers recommend; definitely add that.  It turns out great - I've already had recipe requests.  It's the only way I'll eat lima beans (butter beans work, too).  My hubby thinks the limas are essential because of their starch and their shape holds the sauce well.

**** STARS!!  Did add 1 cup of ketchup, per other reviews- would cut back a little bit on dry mustard- husband thinks it needs to be sweeter- - would make again with these changes- thanks for the recipe!!

I made these for the first time for a church potluck picnic, after tasting something similar a week before.  It got rave reviews.  It's hearty enough to be a main dish.  I did add an extra can of pork & beans, and used baby butter beans instead of limas, added a little Worchestershire and a splash of barbecue sauce (maybe more next time).  Rather than putting it in the oven, I just turned the slow cooker on low while I was at church.  I think you could extend this by adding different kinds of beans.  I'm going to try some black-eyed peas & perhaps some great northerns next time & see what happens!

Campfire memories. I can't stand lima beans so I used two cans of pork n beans. I also squirted in some yellow mustard, about a half a cup of ketchup and 1/4 cup of barbecue sauce. Always have to serve with cornbread. Thanks for the post.

I really like this recipe as a change of pace from the tomato based baked beans we're all so familiar with.  I have made these twice now.  I substituted Northern beans for the limas, mostly for color, and also because I know limas often get a mixed reception.  I also used light & dark kidney beans instead of the poke & beans.  The first time I made these, I put them in a slow cooker & they ended up getting a bit starchy.  The second time I baked them & served them right away.  They turned out much better.  This is a recipe you can play with & get different results each time.

Everyone LOVED these beans.  I substituted great northern beans for the limas since I have a few lima haters here.  This was easy and very yummy.  It seemed a little watery tough, maybe because of the substitution?

This is a tried and true standby at our house.  I've beeen making it for years, and it's always a hit at barbeques and casual pot lucks.  It can be done in the crockpot, simmered on the stove, or baked in the oven.  I frequently substitute a high quality bulk pork sausage for the ground beef, and the flavor is great.  I've used different combinations of beans (including black beans, white beans, cannelini beans, pintos, etc), and I've added 1 T molasses.  I generally use only 1 T of dry mustard.  Try a couple of tsps of Sriracha chili sauce --- gives it a nice kick!

This recipe is so good that my boyfriend and I gobbled it up on top of French bread for a main dish - and we're not even huge bean fans!

My husband loves this!  It's so easy to make.  I accidently used pork and beans and it still tasted great.  Great recipe!

The beans are absolutely wonderful.  My daughter-in-law used ground turkey in place of beef (that's is what she had already) and home cured bacon.  She said they got a little too dry but everyone loved them.  what a great addition to our Labor Day meal.

I thought this was great when I first put it togetjer, but I didn't like it as well after putting it in the crock pot for 6 hours, as suggested.  I also added the cup of ketchup and tablespoon of molassas.  I served it over rice, but there just wasn't as much flavor as I expected.  I may work with it a bit if I make it again.

After making it as the recipe instructed, I put it in a crockpot to keep it warm at the party I took it to.  It was a big hit.  I did substitute butter beans for the lima beans  the recipe called for

This is my 3rd time making this recipe. I normally add a little more dry mustard, some spicy brown mustard, and a little ketchup or BBQ sauce. Delicious!

I've made these for years and they are perfect!  I sometimes leave  out the ground beef if using this as a side dish with other heavy foods.

Very good! We like a little less sugar to taste....but that's just our preference. We doubled the mustard. Some brands of ketchup are sweeter than others, too.

With suggestions from others, I added the ketchup and these were delicious!!  They spent a few hours in my crock pot, and leftovers will not last long in the fridge.
