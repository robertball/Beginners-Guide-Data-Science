I made these potatoes tonight for dinner along side a crispy Greek chicken - and we were really impressed! I did change the recipe a bit by eliminating the canola oil altogether and using only about 1/4 cup of olive oil - the end result was golden delicious potatoes with exactly the right amount of color on them! We will most definitely make these potatoes again!

Delicious! I did lighten this up a bit, so I hope the submitter doesn't mind. I followed the recipe as written, but instead of using all the oil, I just sprayed them very well w/ olive oil cooking spray...worked perfectly! Great flavors and very easy to put together. The recipe didn't specify which type of potatoes to use, so I used yukon gold, which were great for this. These were a nice change from the usual potatoes, and I will definitely be making these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Easier than mashed potatoes, and my family loved these!  I made it exactly as the recipe calls for.  Outstanding flavor, tender but crispy, into the oven in eleven minutes.  I used Yukon Gold potatoes because that's what I like, and I did not peel them.  I stirred when I took off the foil and then again after 15 minutes.  Made it to go with Creamy Herbed Pork Chops from this site, and they were a marriage made in foodie heaven!  There was just a little potato leftover, and hubby heated it up to go with his eggs the next morning.  This qualifies as company food!

Roasted Potatoes & Onions Haiku: "Oil off the charts. Seriously, a whole cup? I couldn't eat mine." Used red potatoes, and went w/ Cook's Notes about leaving uncovered longer to allow for maximum browning, which unfortunately also resulted in the onion soup mix turning to little black flakes. That I was OK w/ though, b/c I actually like things overdone, but what I didn't jive w/ was the insane amount of oil. A 1/2 c. canola + 1/2 c. olive oil seemed like an amount better suited for frying rather than tossing and roasting, but oh well, I followed the recipe, and it was just too greasy for me. Husband kindly told me (as he happily ate his, maybe for my benefit and to not have to toss leftovers) that he wouldn't mind me making the recipe again, but drastically scaling back the oil(s).

I made this today and turned out great.  I did make some changes.  I only used EVOO and 3 tablespoons of bacon grease.  Along with the onion soup mix I used salt, pepper, rosemary, sage, and a little tarragon.  I left in the oven a little longer as I like my potatoes a little on the crispy side, soft in the middle.  At the end I added Mitzithra Greek cheese.  I will be making this again

Definitely did not need such a large amount of oil - I used strictly olive oil and only enough to coat everything when tossed. Ended up adding quite a bit of salt and pepper and couldn't really taste the onion soup mix... the rosemary was overpowering.  Thinking next time I will keep it simpler and make it with olive oil, salt, pepper and dill and cut the onions much smaller so perhaps they will caramelize better.

I will definitely make this again. I used red bliss potatoes,  onion soup mix and oil.  I didn't use any other seasoning. It came out great. I only used 1/3 cup olive oil and that was plenty. I baked it at 450 for 45 min uncovered.

I did cook it the second time for the full 30minutes.  It was excellent.  When I do it again, I will decrease the canola and olive oils by a third.  It was pretty greasy for us.

I made this, using coconut oil rather than olive oil and canola.  I also cut the oil down as suggested by others.  (1/3 cup).  It was pretty good, though the potatoes were a bit overdone. I'll watch the cooking time more closely the next time I make it.

I made this using a bag of "celebration blend" multi-colored small potatoes.  Like the other reviewers, I didn't use as much oil ( just  1/4 cup of olive oil).  I didn't have fresh rosemary, so I used crushed, dried.   My entire family loved this recipe, and the only thing I will change next time is MORE GARLIC CLOVES, possibly more onion.   It was delicious!
