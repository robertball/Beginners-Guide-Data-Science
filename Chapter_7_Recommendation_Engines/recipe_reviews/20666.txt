The first time I rated this, I only gave it a 3, but I've got to change it to a 4.  We had it the day I made it and it only tasted like coleslaw with taco seasoning in it, but the next day it was a good bit better and then the day after that, it was really good.  So, if you know far enough in advance, make it two days before you'll eat it.  It has a great flavor then!

Great!!!  Brought this camping and served at a potluck at the campground, everyone wanted the recipe. We like our coleslaw a little sweet so I added apprx 1/4 sugar.

I made this recipe b/c of the great reviews it received. However I was sorely disappointed. The amount of cumin was way too overpowering.  I think this recipe can have a few overhauls in the spice department, but I really like the addition of radishes.

Wonderful recipe!  I hate coleslaw, never eat the stuff.  But this one is really good, not too mayonaisey and has a nice little kick.  Yummy!  Very good addition to BBQ menu.

Excellent!! I stumbled on this looking for something to go with my Chili Cornbread Pie. WOW! I will be making this often. After reading the other reviews, I used half the cumin and half the cayenne called for and I used a packaged slaw mix. Thanks for a great recipe, Denyse!

I liked this coleslaw, but my husband took one bite and couldn't eat anymore.  He is not a picky eater so I was suprised.  I won't make this again in case someone else was to have that same response.

I found the cumin in the dressing much too strong in this. A hint of it only would be preferable. It was also very salty. The amount of dressing this makes is excessive, so I would recommend making only half the amount. Thanks for sharing the recipe with us. I would make it again with a few adjustments.

YUM!  I wanted a quick coleslaw to go with chicken quesedillas - this is it.  I doubled the lime juice, used a bit of chopped sweet onion instead of green, and omitted the radishes because I didn't have any. I could eat this as the main course, it's that good!

Re: "For a more mild salad, use less green onions."  We found the problem was NOT solved by using less onion, but by the need for cutting the amount of cumin and cayenne at least by at least one-half, as other reviewers have already suggested.  After making that correction, the recipe has become a "keeper".

I stumbled upon this recipe while looking for a "spicy coleslaw" to serve with fajitas. I joined the site, just so I could rate this recipe. I cheated and used pre-shredded cabbage and carrots, but the amount of spices was just perfect. It's a great recipe!

Way too much cayanne pepper.  If you're going to make this recipe, try adding the pepper a little bit at a time, until the dressing tastes right to you.

I love this recipe.  Quick, easy to make, and extremely versatile. I've added poblano or jalapeno peppers sometimes to give it an extra kick.  I use this in turkey wraps, serve it along side pulled pork bbq sandwiches, and sometimes just eat it right out of the container, all by itself!

Too much cumin! You want it to enhance the flavor, not take it over! 1 tsp is more than enough.

I love this slaw. It's tasty and tangy and just different. One may want to consider the fact that there are a few savory spices in this recipe, so if black pepper makes you sweat, this is maube not the best choice. If you like spicy, tangy - you'll make this salad again and again for the taste and the crunch.

I thought this was a wonderful coleslaw recipe!  I am more of a creamy, savory coleslaw person and this hit the spot!  The cumin adds a nice smokey flavor and it makes this one different from the rest.  Great recipe!

I made this tonight with my special steaks for my husband and I.  He really liked the slaw and said it was a good side dish with the steaks and  rated it 5*s.  Will definitely make it again!!! I did make one change by adding 1 TBS of white wine vinegar.

Wish I'd read the reviews first! It was way to much for me, but my husband said it was the best coleslaw he'd ever had. I will try again with 1/2 the spices(especially the cumin) as suggested.

I don't like sweet coleslaw and thought this would be a perfect side for BBQ ribs.  I used a package of finely shredded cabbage, but kept the rest of the recipe the same.  Next time I make this, I will definitely cut down on the cumin - it was way too much. I also will use more shredded cabbage, as my slaw came out a bit soupy.  Very unique recipe - thanks for sharing, Denyse!

Made this with pulled pork sandwiches, loved it. Used 1/2 green cabbage, and 1/2 red cabbage,just because I like red cabbage. I made this in the winter, cant wait for summer BBQ's

This is a great coleslaw recipe!   I don't like restraunt style coleslaw, because it is too sweet.   That is one reason why I tried this, because it didn't call for sugar.  I also used a slight bit less cayenne pepper that was called for so the kids could eat it and it wasn't too hot at all, I wouldn't mind trying it with all the cayenne sometime.   Also I forgot to buy the limes and used a tablespoon of white wine vinegar, it was still very good, I will definately make this recipe again.

I tried this recipe out with pulled pork samwiches- deeelish! It was HOT! I had to take a drink of milk after each bite- but it was worth it for the flavor. Since then, I have cut the amount of cayenne in 1/2 to reduce the fire. Also, great tip- try this on top of your burger or a sausage sandwich- it makes an ordinary sandwich taste oh-so-fabulous! Thanks for the recipe :-)

Very tasty. I used only half the amount of mayo, added a dash more lime juice and it was perfect. not too soggy. I also used reduced fat mayo and did add mroe cayenne and cumin. The leftovers of this tasted yummy the next day.

I followed this recipe to a t and measured all the seasonings out only using a bag of pre-shredded cabbage with carrots in it. OMG the seasoning were out of control. It felt like a paste in my mouth. Usually I never measure out my seasonings just use what I think is right, I wish I would have with this recipe because I think it has the potential to be really really good.

Delicious and fresh-tasting.  Especially yummy for those of us who don't like overly mayonaise-y coleslaw.  And the cayenne gives this a wonderful, surprise "kick"--no longer will your coleslaw be something that just "comes along for the ride!"

The addition of cumin and radishes was a nice change but this recipe has no tang or sweetness to it. It is just too much mayonnaise. This makes a huge amount.

Not impressed.  Sorry.  The cumin was overpowering.  We will go back to a more vinegar-based coleslaw that includes a kick of hot peppers for our "Texas" version.

I have been looking for a good slaw recipe with no added sugar or sweeteners.  After reading the reviews, I decided to make this 1 day in advance.  I also decided to HALVE the spices.  I'm so glad I cut back on the spice.  I cannot imagine this slaw being edible with the full amount.  It is very spicy with half the cumin, cayenne, and black pepper.  I'm not sure if I'll make this again, but if I do, I will cut back on the spice even more.

I think this has a lot of potential, but I would recommend cutting back on the cumin and definitely cut back on the cayenne pepper to about half a teaspoon. It was so spicy we couldn't even finish what was on our plates, and we like spicy food so this is saying a lot!

Never really liked coleslaw.  Was looking for something different to go with BBQ brisket sandwich and this was it.  Love the cumin as it takes away some of the cabbage taste.  Excellent!

We loved it!  I had all the ingredients and used prepackaged coleslaw mix.  Instead of the green onion, I substituted a whole white onion, which I chopped in the food processor with 6-8 radishes.  Delicious!

Awesome coleslaw if you don't like traditional slaw that is too sweet. It definitely has a kick..more like a punch.. so if you don't want to feel the after burn in your mouth try 1/2 tsp of cayenne, instead. Absolutely loved the cumin and that's what makes this recipe. I substituted sour cream and greek yogurt for the mayo. I don't like mayo and next time will probably just sub the yogurt but because I had sour cream I needed to use up I included that. I will use this again in the summer when we start to BBQ again. Yummy and thanks for posting!

Mmmm, so good!  I am NOT a fan of coleslaw, but this was very good!  I altered the recipe just a little because I can't leave well enough alone: I added Cilantro to the cabbage mixture, and to the dressing I added some taco sauce (about 2 T.) and about 1/2 cup sour cream.  I didn't have radishes, so I omitted that.  I will be making this again!!

Loved this!
I used a bag of coleslaw greens from the store and added the dressing to it.  I also used a bit less cayenne than called for.  The taste of cumin and lime are delicious.  This is the dressing recipe that I will always use from here on out.

This was surprisingly good.  I don't like coleslaw and have, therefore, never made it.  But, I love cabbage and can't turn down anything with cumin in it.  It was super easy to make and was excellent.  I've discovered that it's important to slice the cabbage super thin.  So, next time, I'll use my mandolin slicer to get that shredded cabbage feel.  It was super flavorful and a bit tangy/spicy.  I loved it!

Whoa....this was just TOO spicy for me and my family!  Some other people say it has a "slight" kick but I think it has a HUGE kick!  BUT I think the flavor could be really good and I will definitely make again but with less of the pepper.  I do like the cumin flavor.  I recommend to others to try this recipe but add the cayenne and black pepper gradually and taste to make sure it's not too spicy for you, especially if you're sensitive to spicy foods.

This is a very good coleslaw with a twist.  If you don't like cumin, you won't like this slaw.  It has a very slight "kick" also.  If you are looking for something different to try for summer BBQ... this would be it!

Best coleslaw ever! I used half and half green and red cabbage, left out the radishes and added a splash of cider vinegar. Served it with smoked pork ribs and there wasnt much left over!

Way too spicy, and just a strange combination of all the different flavors.  Could also be a bit creamier.

It was way too spicy but was also just a strange combination of flavors.  And it's not that we don't like tex-mex because we do but not this.  Will certainly not make it again!

As the three stars indicate, this was simply ok.  Although we like southwestern foods in general, I'm not sure we liked the cumin, cayenne, and lime juice mixture on slaw in particular.  Husband LOVES hot, spicy foods but said that somehow the cayenne in this dish was "distracting".

5.9.18  This was OK, would probably cut back on the cumin a bit if I made again, which I probably won't.  This didn't WOW me, and I wasn't crazy about the way it looked either (that dark dressing).  Maybe I'm just too much of a fan for traditional coleslaw.

Oh my word!!! This was  crazy delicious!! I made the dressing exactly  how it said. Oh wait, I added probably more lime  juice, I squeezed a half of a lime into it and just a small pinch of sugar. It was amazing , the family all liked it but I loved it! The salad I did completely different but it was the dressing that made it a hit! So my salad, I used bagged broccoli slaw, one can of black beans rinsed, one small bag of frozen corn rinsed and thawed and then because I had them at the last minute I threw in halved grape tomatoes. The result was out of this world and I only had it in the fridge for a 1/2 hour before serving it. Thank you Denyse for such an easy and especially delicious salad!!

Modified for large group. It was really good and the flavors blended well. When increasing for large group be careful when increasing the cayenne and cumin since both can overpower the dish.

This was the PERFECT companion to the Texas BBQ brisket we ate today. I changed a couple of things: I used purple/red cabbage instead of green; I only used 1/4 tsp of cayenne (and it was still plenty spicy); and I added about 1/2-1 tsp. of grated turmeric root.

Yummy!  I did follow the recommendation to cut the cayenne.  I cut it to 1/2 teaspoon and it was still a bit spicy and we love hot food.  Next time I will only use 1/4 teaspoon.  I think I will add cilantro next time too.

Used this with beer battered fish from the frozen aisle on a white corn tortilla.  Mighty tasty!  Much better I think than fish tacos with just cabbage and the white sauce normally used.

This recipe is so easy and good! I had made a pork roast in the crockpot wit the Campbell's Sweet Korean Barbecue and wanted a coleslaw to eat with it on soft taco wraps! I did not have cumin so I added garlic powder and onion powder. I left out the green onions and just bought the pack of the already prepared cabbage with carrots and radishes for coleslaw! It was so good! Definitely will make again. Would love to try it on shredded beef tacos!!

I doubled this for a potluck and thought it was tasteless.  Asked DH to taste it, he thought it was great.  Evidently so did others, because I came home with an empty bowl.  So what do I know?  I did add more cayenne in an attempt for flavor.

Shared this with a neighbor friend and they came over to get the recipe.  The flavor combination was great.  I used pre-shredded coleslaw mix with good results.

I'm not a coleslaw fan but THIS recipe is fantastic!  I wanted to keep eating it but calorie/fat gram worries help stop me.  I pretty much followed the recipe except I used 1/2 cup rather than 1 cup of mayo.  All too often I'd see/eat coleslaw swimming in mayo.  I think too much of it drowns out the other flavors.  Overall, it's a great recipe, very easy to make, and add alittle more cayenne and it'll kick a--!

Very tasty.    
Maybe a little bit too spicy, but even my husband(He normally cannot handle spicy food very much.) loves this recipe.

This is a yummy sidedish for bbq. It is a bit spicy so I will cut down the cayanne this weekend when I make it again.

I like hot.  But, this was way too much cayenne pepper.  Even with less heat, I still think this is only fair.

This is absolutely delicious! I put this on burgers and on baked fish for easy fish tacos. The only change I make is to use 1/2c mayo and 1/2c sour cream.

In all fairness, I did make quite a few changes, but it was because I was making it at the last minute and just had to use what I had on hand.  That said... here's what I did:  I omitted the cayenne, radish and the lime juice (didn't have any).  I kept the entire amount of cumin as I love the stuff.  I also added a splash of vinegar as well as a little (maybe 1/8-1/4 cup?) sugar.  I must say, this was a HIT.  I did not have any sauerkraut available so I used this on reuben sandwiches.  I'm typically very picky about using kraut, but this was an awesome substitute!

Awesome recipe! One of my bf's favorite dishes. I did scale down a bit on the spices the second time I made this. Excellent on a BBQ pork sandwich. Can also use broccoli slaw mix in place of cabbage. Thanks for the recipe!

Not to bad.  I omitted the carrots and radishes and added cilantro and in place of cayenne, used chipolte seasoning.  I also used the juice from one whole lime.  It turned out pretty good.

This wasn't a hit with us, unfortunately. I also halved the cumin and cayenne, but we just didn't think the overall combination of flavors worked. Maybe it would be better as a potato salad? Oh well, thanks anyway.
