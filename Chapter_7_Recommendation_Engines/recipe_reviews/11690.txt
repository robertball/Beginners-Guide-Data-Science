We love this recipe, and the rice noodles are a nice change from our usual rice, pasta, or potatoes.  We only use half a cucumber, and make our own peanut sauce, using:  2 Tbsp soy sauce, 2 Tbsp water, 1/2 cup peanut butter, sugar, garlic powder; heat gently (either stovetop or microwave) til peanut butter is melted.

This is a very good recipe, in Thai food the veggies should all be tender crisp, not overdone and soggy.  Some tips on cooking the vegetables: onion in first, when it just barely starts to soften, throw in the mushrooms. Cook for only 1 or 2 minutes, then add the peppers and the sauces.  Continue to cook till the peppers are tender-crisp, by then the mushrooms will be succulent, and the onions will be softened.

I used the peanut sauce mentioned in the review, but I added 3/4cup of soy milk (use light coconut milk if you have it) as the sauce thickened to a sludge when heated.  I also added some lime juice and chile paste.

I loved this recipe, but I didn't follow it exactly.  I didn't have sesame oil, oyster sauce, or sesame seeds.  I also substituted some broccoli for the cucumber and mushrooms.  Even with the missing ingredients I thought it was great.  I had a bottle of spicy Szechuan sauce on the table so others could add spice as they pleased.

Thanks Sharon for sharing the recipe. May I add a little note for member TAPJ? This recipe calls for peanut sauce, but if it's not your liking you should try ground roaster peanuts. Here in Thailand that is what we use in various noodle dishes. Just 1-3 table spoons (I often put 4 spoons!) per dish. Roast and grind (traditionally with pestle and in a little mortar) or very quickly blend (on pulse) to a corse and crunchy texture. Do not mash it to pulp! Sprinkle it before serve or quickly toss it last to keep them crunchy.

Fantastic!  I'm enjoying this dish as I type this review.  Tastes like it was made in a high-quality Thai restaurant, not in my very own kitchen!  I love my stir-fries to have very strong flavors and to be fiery hot, so I was a bit more liberal with the ginger and hot sauce.  I also varied the veggies a bit, I honestly think this recipe would go great with any your heart desires.  I omitted the cucumbers but wouldn't omit the red and green peppers- they really add something essential to the medley of flavors.  Oh, I also added a splash of orange juice just before serving, it gave a very nice citrusy tang.  Next time I'd like to try this over rice.  This dish will be made often, thanks so much for sharing it!

This was a really quick and easy dish to whip up. The texture was a bit gloggy but overall it tasted yummy.

Oh my stars, is this ever FANTASTIC!! The flavors are so rich and complex. Since some of my family claims to dislike Thai food, I cheated by using cayenne instead of the chili sauce and calling it "Chinese stir fry." My husband proceeded to eat 4 helpings, and my extremely picky 7 year old even wanted seconds. 

Other than subbing for the chile sauce, I added all the ingredients called for except I didn't have rice noodles and used regular spaghetti instead. I also tossed in a generous handful of broccoli--yum! 

I made my own peanut sauce using the Thai Peanut Sauce recipe on this site and adding garlic powder as suggested in another review here by someone making their own. I also used rice wine vinegar in place of the sherry. 

I wound up halving the recipe because my wok wouldn't have held the entire amount called for, but we still got a big enough bowl of noodles so that after dishing up almost 7 servings total, we still have enough left for lunch tomorrow. Thanks so much for posting this!

This was great! I don't like really spicy stuff and this was just spicy enough to challenge me - in a good way. Very light and the peanut flavor wasn't too overwhelming if you don't like peanuts. HIGHLY recommend...will be cooking for guests.

This was good for starters; but our local Thai restaurant uses a lot of basil in their dishes.  I omitted the peanut butter and used sweet basil (dried because I didn't have fresh) and it tasted a lot more like what our restaurant here serves.

This was a fabulous recipe.  I made a few changes based on preference.  I omitted ginger only becuase I didn't have any on hand.  I added about 2 cups of shrimp.  I also added some fish sauce and lime juice.  Then I garnished the dish with chopped cilantro.  Because my husband cannot eat spicy dishes, I left the spicy sauce on the table for those who prefer it spicier.  Absolutely delicious!  Thanks so much Sharon!

very tasty dish!  I used water chestnuts and bok choy in place of the bell peppers. I also didn't have red chile sauce so I just used 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes instead. Oh, and i did add a few dashes of lemon juice at the end too. Also, I followed the peanut sauce recipe that one of the reviewers posted and it was way to peanut-buttery for me, so i'll cut the peanut butter in half next time. One reviewer mentioned that this dish was gloggy. To cut down on the gloggy factor I did not mix the noodles and chicken mixture together before serving, put them in separate bowls. Will make this dish again for sure! It's fun to make, you've gotta try it!

Yum! Left out the cucumber (didn't seem like it would go) and garnished with peanuts along with the sesame seeds. Everyone loved it.

This recipe is SO good!!  It's very spicey, so if you aren't a big hot food person, might want to cut back on the chili sauce.    I've made it twice, and it's just so good.  2nd time I added broccoli and carrots.  YUM!

The final result was good, not great, but I found this recipe very annoying because of the ingredient order.  All of the ingredients were completely out of order.  I guess I didn't realize how much I relied on ingredient order until they were disorganized. I kept losing my spot and having to reread the recipe over and over.  By the end, I was so over this recipe.

This is good, fine, quite similar to other Asian dishes I have prepared.  I wasn't blown away but I certainly ate all my food.

This turned out great for my boyfriend and I. We didn't have a wok big enough for the noodles and everything else so we cooked everything else and then cooked the noodles in some of the juice and added a little more peanut sauce, soy sauce and sesame oil. We also left out the cucumber but added snow peas. I will definitely do this again!

I used chicken thighs and left out the red pepper, cucumber, and mushroom. I used green pepper and a frozen Asian mix (broccoli, snow peas, carrots, and water chestnuts) instead of the listed vegetables. I didn't try to mix in the noodles and just served the chicken and vegetable mixture on top. It was delicious and was quickly dispatched by my friends.

Although I do like peanut butter, I found this recipe way to peanut buttery to eat as a main dish with rice. If I was to make it again, I would have other dishes with it to cut the taste a bit more.

Didn't have chicken.  Added zucchini, 2 carrots, fish sauce, lime juice.  No cuke, mushroom, chile sauce or oyster sauce.  Maybe less pepper flakes next time.

Very good! I used the peanut sauce recipe mentioned in the first review, but it was VERY thick even when I kept adding water and a little lime juice.  Finally I added about a 1/2 c. of chicken broth and that was better.  Still, it thickens over time.  I skipped the cucumbers because my husband hates them and I didn't think I'd care for them cooked.  I substituted broccoli and snow peas for the mushrooms too.  I had no oyster sauce, so I skipped that.  I couldn't find anything that said "red chile sauce" but I did find a "thai-style chile sauce" and it was very good. This has a great flavor.  I toasted the sesame seeds which are a great touch.  Crushed peanuts would also be delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.  I'll definitely make this again.  It would go great with rice too.

Husband thought it was 4 star.  Turned out a tad soggy, I probably overcooked the noodles.  Also, I think the type of peanut sauce you use affects the taste.  I may try making it as another reviewer suggested.

Very tasty. However, I altered the recipe by using broccoli in place of cucumber (as suggested), deleted the mushrooms (husband does not like them), had red chile garlic sauce on hand and used that in place of the plain red chile sauce, and since I wasn't quite sure what Peanut Sauce was, I used a Satay Sauce.  Quite a few people said the sauce got really thick, so I did not drain any liquid from the chicken and the sauce was perfect.  The rice noodles were a bit different but very nice and suited the dish well.  Makes a very pretty presentation. And definity will feed 4-6 people. Would be great to take to a potluck dinner. I will absolutely add this dish to my line-up.  Thanks.  We really enjoyed it.

Very good.  Next time I think I will use zucchini instead of cucumbers..don't like cooked cucumbers I now know.  A bit spicy but not too much.  Couldn't find oyster sauce so used fish sauce.  Will definately make again.

OMG !!!! THIS WAS THE BOMB !!! Also tried it with shrimp and my family loved it. the sauces combined made such a flavorful dish.  I omitted the cucumber and carrots.  Had a hard time with the rice noodles, and tried regular angel hair pasta.  Just DELISH !!!

not quite as easy as going to our favorite Thai restaurant, but really delicious, and not difficult to make. The prep is the most work, and I highly recommend having everything prepped before you even heat a pan, this dish is quick moving once you start cooking.  Like another reviewer stated, authentic Thai food is going to have tender crisp vegetables, so basically just heating the veggies through is enough cooking.

Great basic starter. Didn't have all the ingredients so I did change a few things. No chicken wanted veg dish used red,green,orange,and yellow peppers. Made fresh peanut sauce from AR. Didn't have red chile sauce so I used Kung Pow Sauce for the spice. next time will have all ingredients and will rate then. Thank you for the great recipe.

I left the chile sauce out because I don't like too much spice, and added some Red Hot instead. The result ended up being a little flavorless, and much too peanut-y. I doused the leftovers in soy sauce and they were a little better.

Delicious!! I used what I had on hand, which is quite a bit lately (been exploring lots of new recipes) But used pork instead, still very good! The only thing i would change is not to make the rice noodles too far ahead of time. By the time i got to them (never used rice noodles before) they were a big clump! Awesome recipe!!

Wow! Delicious! This is definitely something that I will be making again! The only thing I tweaked, was I used spicy stir fry sauce along with the soy sauce to marinate the chicken... Also I served it on sticky white rice instead of noodles. But it's so versatile you could even put it in a pita pocket or tortilla! That's what I'm doing with the left-overs!

This was pretty good....very spicy, so not for the weak palate. I used beef instead of chicken, and marinated the beef in the soy sauce, adding garlic powder and onion salt to the soy sauce. I reduced the peanut sauce, omitted the red chile sauce, and added green onions. I also served these with lumpia (shanghai style) from this site. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe, Sharon!

This was really good and spicy. I used tofu instead of chicken, as I forgot to defrost the meat. I reduced the green and red pepper and in lieu of mushrooms I used broccoli. I will keep this in my recipe box and make again

Used broccoli instead of cucumbers and skipped the mushrooms. Used a little less ginger and oyster sauce and more garlic. Used the whole bottle of peanut sauce when making the recipe of 6 servings. Spicy enough as is! Don't need to add more spice. Plus we added roasted peanuts.

This is the first recipe I decided to try after finding the website.  I really dont enjoy cooking and get fed up with trying to think of new and different things to eat.  I tried a little of this whilst it was cooking in the skillet and thought oh this is awful, my hubby is going to try it, say thanks for the effort, but he doesn't like it.  Long story short I dished it up with the noodles and for some reason it tasted a whole lot different than my earlier taste from the skillet.  We both really enjoyed it.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because when I see the picture that accompanies the recipe, that's what I expect it to look like and this didn't look anything like it.  Now to find recipe number 2.

As I was carefully preparing all the fresh ingredients I taste tested along the way.  It was absolutely awesome... then came time to add the peanut sauce.  Once I did that it all went south.  All the fresh crisp vegetables were over powered by the peanut flavor.  I do have to say, that it did have a nice little 'after burn" but not too much.  It was the only thing you could taste beside peanut.  I'll make it again, just without the peanut sauce... I'll sub more chilli and add lime.  I definately thought the cucumbers were an interesting touch.  Probably tasted really good if it hadn't been for the peanut flavor.

very good and easy!  I made a few changes, though - mostly because I didn't have some of the ingredients but also from other reviews.  

Firstly, I used ground pork - because I didn't have enough chicken on hand.  For the peanut sauce, I chopped up finely about 3 tbsp of roasted peanuts, and then also added a dollop of peanut butter (prob about 2tbsp).  I also added about a tpsp of soy to this mix.  instead of the oyster sauce, I used 1 tbsp fish sauce and 1 tbsp lime juice.  I didn't have red chile sauce on hand, so I used about a teaspoon of red thai curry paste.  

I didn't use the cucumber in the mix, but chopped some up and served on top.  I didn't use mushrooms (didn't have any) but used brocolli.  

It was quick, easy and a hit with the family (husband and 2 kids).  Will make again!

I loved this recipe.  I had a hard time finding oyster sauce, so I substituted fish sauce. Also, I used Thai Kitchen's Sweet Chili sauce instead of regular chili sauce. My boyfriend loved it to, will definitely make again!

I used chili paste insted of chili sauce, so I only used one tablespoon. It was still quite spicy for my own personal taste.

I loved this recipe.  I love foods from other countries. I especially like making them at home. I am good at going to a restaurant eating something and liking it so much I try to go home and either find a recipe for it or experiment on my own. I am always getting inspiration from reviews and recipes and then creating my own recipe. In my opinion cooking is nothing more than creating. A friend of mine's son is getting married and the bride and groom want Thai food for their reception. I was asked about a month ago to help with SERVING the food. that inspired me to go searching for Thai recipes. My husband doesn't like real spicy food and I have acid reflux so even though I like it pretty hot it doesn't like me. But since my husband and I got married he does like it when I add a little kick to stuff because he says it's not too spicy. I used peanut sauce in the bottle. I liked the cucumber it was a nice change. I didn't think it was quite hot enough so I added extra peanut sauce and my friends husband suggested adding cayenne pepper. It was great. My friends enjoyed the food  so much that they almost didn't have enough for their son to try to approve it for the reception. LOL! Some of the other tips that were given in other reviews I will try next time I make this. Needless to say this  recipe will be served at the reception. Thanks for sharing.

Very tasty dish and great over rice noodles. The cucumbers were a little weird in it so I'll skip those next time. I added extra bell pepper and a bit of broccoli to stretch the meal out a bit, and I used BLSL thighs.

We tried the recipe this evening and did not change anything.  It was very good, but if you are looking for spicy add a litte more chili sauce or paste.  I was not sure about putting in the cucumbers, but was pleasantly surprised.  I will definately make this again and try making my own peanut sauce next time, too.  Thanks for the recipe.

We loved this dish!  I added a few red pepper flakes at the end because we enjoy very spicy things...otherwise I fixed it exactly as called for.  Thanks!

Good recipe. I used fish sauce instead of oyster sauce, and used the veggies that I had on hand: green onions, yellow onion, carrots, and celery. We like our food spicy, so I added a squirt of Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce on top of the red chili paste.

Excellent recipe.  I found it abit spicy but the hubby loved it.  (I think my chili hot was exceptionally spicy) It was my first attempt at anything thai and it turned out great.  Very easy to make.  Will definately make this again. Thanks

This is a lot of work- cutting, dicing, and chopping. We were disappointed. The flavor was ok (we like spicy food) but the noodles werent cooked all the way and we ended up having to add chicken stock to it so the noodles could cook. I will keep searching....

My first attempt at making Thai food and it turned out wonderfully. It was a little too spicy for my 5 year old but every one else in the family loved it.  I'll definitly make this again.

I thought it was a tad on the bland side. I added black pepper and lime juice to give it a bit of extra flavor.

Have made this recipe numerous times since coming across it, it's great. Preparing all the vegetables can take some time, but it's well worth the wait. Tasty, spicy, and colorful. I don't tweak this recipe much, other than using onion powder instead of onions for the anti onion people. Everyone has loved it!

My family love noodles, so keep trying diff recipes. This was good for a change. Used spring onions alongwith the veggies. Remember to keep the veggies firm.

This was a delicious dish! Prep time was a little lengthy but it was well worth it. I added some jalapeño for a little extra kick! We also made "Zoodles" (zucchini noodles). We used a gadget to slice the zucchini and set them aside. Once all of the ingredients are cooking together in the wok, I added the Zoodles and mixed for 1 minute! They are a great alternative to noodles for us folks that are on a low carb diet.

Overall we enjoyed this dish, but something was missing to give it that really memorable feel.   I left out the chicken and I wish I had made my own peanut sauce.  I'd say how well you like this recipe really depends a lot of how much you like the peanut sauce you bought.

This was a good recipe. The ginger gave it a very nice, pungent kick and the chili sauce gave it a good heat. The only ingredient modification I made was to leave out the mushrooms. I liked this recipe (wouldn't say I loved it, though) and would probably make it again, but, considering all of the work it requires for prep, it's one of those recipes I might make every once in a great while, not very often.

So delicious. My husband and I felt as if we had dined in our favorite Thai restaurant. The only thing I did was sub snow peas for the cucumber and made my own peanut sauce per one of the other reviewers consisting of crunchy peanut butter, equal parts soy sauce/water and a pinch of brown sugar, then microwaved to soften.

I think this makes a lot more than 4 servings.  Probably closer to 6 or more. But I guess it depends on how much you eat.  I didn't have any peanut sauce so I made a mixture of 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter, 2 tablespoons water, 3 tablespoons hoisin sauce & 1 tablespoon soy sauce.   It ended up turning out really thick in the end, but I think that's because of my "peanut sauce" so I added a 1/2 cup of water to thin it out a bit.   I also used the veggies I had on-hand: broccoli, mushrooms, carrots, onion, & sugar snap peas.  In my bowl I added more chili sauce and it was perfect. Extremely filling too.

As far as homeaide thai dishes go, this is one of the best I've made.  Lots of cutting, but it is worth it in the end. My husband and I love thai, and this is the closest recipe to buying the thai.  Thanks!

I don't like to be negative, but this took a lot of work and my husband and I ended up throwing most of it out. We both like spicy food, and love to cook, but this was a waste of time.
