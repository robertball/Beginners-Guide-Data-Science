My family and I have been making a similar recipe ever since I was a child. The main difference to our recipe is that we add 1 teaspoon of lemon juice or lemon zest to the cream cheese mixture. We love it and bake several each Christmas. To answer a previous reviewer's question: this is how my family bakes it - after baking cream cheese layer let it cool slightly, then top with sourcream mixture and bake again for 5 minutes.  Remove from oven, cool and for best results let it refrigerate overnight or for at least 4 hours.  We think it is best when served cold or room temperature.

This is almost the same as my momma makes it...it's sooo delicious.  I made this for "family meal" at The French Culinary Institute where I work and one student told me it's the BEST she's ever had...thanks for this wonderful recipe!  PS to make the crust yourself, combine 1 sleeve graham crackers in robocoupe or food processor with 2 T sugar and 2 T butter and blend until crumbs are moist, pat into pie dish and pre-bake at 350 for 5 minutes.  Let cool and fill.

This was quick and easy and very tasty. I did make a few changes.  I made the graham cracker crust.  After I poured the filling into the crust, I heated 1/4 all-fruit raspberry spread in the microwave for 30 seconds.  I drizzled this over the filling and it sank down into the pie.  I cooked as directed and then added the sour cream topping.  The raspberry flavor in the cheesepie was delicious.  It was a big hit at the party I was at.  Thanks for the recipe!

I am interested in making this recipe but I find it quite unclear.  (I've been baking for thirty years so it's not inexperience)   Is this to be served as a warm, hot, room temp or chilled pie?  Do I bake the filling, chill it and then bake off the topping or leave the whole thing out at room temp before baking it off, or what?   It seems like a cheesecake type of filling which would naturally be served cold but the recipe says to top it and bake it off and then serve.  Confusing!!!  Please, just one more sentence in the recipe would make it crystal clear to all of us.

I made this over a week ago and it was D-lish! For a while now I've been craving one of Marie Calendars Sour Cream Cheese pies, but lately they've always been out of stock. I finally got sick of waiting and set out on a mission to find one and, like magic, here this recipe was. My family absolutely loved it and I got my cream cheese pie fix. The only difference I made was to serve it totally chilled. And as a personal note to other cooks, don't cheap out on the pie crust like I did! You'll be happier in the end.

This recipe is delicious and easy to make.  I made it for my Christmas Eve Dinner and everyone loved it.  Tastes just like cheesecake instead of pie.  Will definitely be making this again.

I am not sure what happened here--- but cooked for 40 mins  (35 the middle was still not set) then the crust was starting to get brown-- so did take out and put topping-- cooked for last 5 mins--- middle was still soupy-- is it 2- 8oz of cream cheese or really suppose to be only one??

This is an awesome recipe! The filling is light and creamy. I followed the pie directions exactly except I put a blueberry sauce on top instead of the sour cream.

I received a copy of this recipe from my grandmother 12 years ago...and I still use this recipe to this day! Everyone loves the pie. Just don't tell them about the sour cream until after they eat!

I brought this to Thanksgiving dinner and my family gobbled it up.  It is so deliciously creamy!  Make sure not to overcook - it finishes baking a little after taking it out of the oven.  A keeper.

This was so yummy.  I added a 1\2 tsp. of lemon extract to the topping and it was so good I could have eaten the whole pie.  This one is a keeper!

this is a good recipe. I've been helping my mom bake this pie since i was 4. The only thing different that we do is add 1tbs of lemon juice to the filling, and add 1/2 to 1tsp of vanilla to the topping. I personally never tasted a difference with baking the topping the extra 5 mins so i just add the topping to a cooled down pie then refrigerate for at least 4 hrs.

I've been making this recipe in lieu of traditional cheesecake for over 25 years... I found it in a cookbook I got as a wedding gift way back when! My friends and family ask me to make it for the holidays, special occasions, and birthdays. It's incredibly simple and it has always come out great for me. Sometimes I make it with a ganache topping, or use flavored yogurt in place of sour cream. I love the idea of fruit topping.  Maybe I'll give it a try, as I'm making it right now!

I have been using a modified version of this recipe for years. I triple the sour cream layer and half the cream cheese layer cook as directed in a Keebler shortbread cookie crust.  Drizzle chocolate sauce on top for a pie that is to die for. I love Marie Calendar's sour cream pie; this one is just as good.

Yummy!  I used less sugar, about 3/4c or less, and it was still delicious.  A good basic recipe that you can really take off with...lemon, chocolate chip, all kinds of toppings, etc.

Baked cream cheese? We tried this and it was less than a success. I didn't actually bake it, someone else did, so who knows what happened! Well, I won't be making another attempt.

I am amazed that this cream cheese pie tastes so good and is so simple to make.  I didn't even have to get my big KitchenAid out - just used a handmixer. Truly it tastes like a good quality, light cheesecake.  Thanks, Sally, for sharing this keeper!

Simple and delicious!  I used reduced fat crust, neufchatel cheese, and light sour cream.  Like someone else mentioned, the sour cream is more detectable when the pie is fresh out of the oven.  So in my case, the sort-of-funny-tasting light sour cream was more noticable at that time, but not bad.  (And obviously this is not the fault of the recipe.)  Once chilled though, I don't think anyone would have known it was low fat.  I will make again- low fat, full fat, whatever.  I loved it.  Thanks!

This is the easiet pie I have ever made and taste was devine!  I also use individual pie crusts and topped with fresh strawberries and blue berries for the 4th of July...my family raved on and on about how good they were. If using individual pie crusts bake for about 25min so that the crust doesn't get to hard. Thanks for sharing.

Absolutely fantastic! My 14 year old daughter made this for us for dinner and company the other night. It was the best cheesecake we had ever eaten. It was much lighter than regular cheesecake, and much easier to prepare. She topped it with Supreme Strawberry Topping on this site - and it was perfect! My Mother-in-law and I both requested that this be our birthday cake this year.

this recipe has been in my family for generations although it started with a soft fresh farmer's cheese that was made in my great great grandmother's day. If you like a soft gently flavored cheesecake this is for you!  Christmas wouldn't be Christmas without this recipe. We lost my grandmother a few years ago so making this is a rememberance to her.

This cheesecake was awesome!  I put half of the filling in, sprinkled chocolate chips and then put the remaining filling in over the chocolate chips.  It was sooooooo good!  Thanks for a great recipe that's sooo simple to make!

I found the volume of the cream cheese part more than adequately filled the pie shell so I did not bother with the sour cream topping.  I did add finely grated chocolate and lemon rind though.  I liked it.

I can't argue that this recipe is incredibly easy, and the pie does taste good.  My issue is with the density and richness.  I don't see any difference between eating this, and, literally, taking a bite out of a bar of cream cheese.  Mind you, I love cheesecake and love cream cheese.  I would like to alter this recipe to make it lighter.  And for anyone making it, you can easily add a flavor or topping to it.  For clarity, I suggest letting the pie cool before adding the sour cream topping.

This was SO GOOD. Followed the recipe but was unsure what to do after the first baking. Took it out let it sit while the oven heated to 450 and made the sour cream topping.  After the second baking I let it cool and put it in the freezer for a couple of hours because I didn't think it would get cold quick enough.  Then I put it in the frige until we were ready to serve...EVERYONE LOVE IT! This is for sure a keeper!

I love this cheesecake.  It's easy to make and very good.  Not as dense as the New York style but still delicious.  I did add choc chips to the batter.  Also I added instant espresso granules (dissolved)and a bare dash of cinnamon to the sour cream layer to add a cappucino flavor to it.

Excellent recipe - I didn't use the sour cream topping because I forgot to get sour cream but it was still absolutely delicious!  I eat mine with a little whipped cream on top but it's also delicious with a fruit topping - just don't overdo the fruit - you want to be able to taste the cheesecake!  Thanks for the recipe - I'll be making this again and again!

OMG!!! Majorly good! Tastes like the original cream cheesecake by Sara Lee!!! I just used a Keebler crust. Make sure your eggs & cream cheese are at room temperature! I forgot to up the oven temp....no biggie. In fact, I might try not baking the sour cream layer next time. This is to die for. Thank you SO MUCH for this recipe!!!

This recipe was a hit for my family and neighbors, I get several requests for it. The filling is quite thick though, it's hard to place the plastic cover that comes with the crust over the pie. I also add 1/4 cup of sweetened condensed milk to the filling ingredients which makes for great added flavor.

This was crazy delicious. Rich and creamy. I skipped the sour cream part but I did add crushed salted cashew nuts as toppings., for some texture plus to offset some of that sweetness. I'll reduce the sugar to 3/4 c next time. I also chilled for 24 hrs before serving. Super yummy. Thanks for sharing

THANK YOU for posting this recipe!  I have been making this EXACT recipe since the '70s (with lemon juice added) and I lost my handwritten copy when we moved....Do you have any idea how many copycat/not quite it recipes for what we call "cheesecake pie" there are on the internet?  But this is it-this is the one and only-and I am so glad I found it!

I've made this pie a dozen times for various gatherings in the past year.  I am always asked for the recipe, and almost always get a surprised reaction when I provide the recipe.  It's so simple, yet so delicious.  I don't alter it in any way, it's perfect as it is.  I think next time I may try cherries just for a change of pace.  So good!

I love cheesecake and this was delicious and easy. I took it out after 35 mins and while my oven heated up to 450 I left it sit. Then put on the sour cream topping and baked for 5 mins more. Refrigerated over night. I will make over and over.

I’ve been making this pie for many years. I do like to add a bit of lemon to the mix, about a tsp. Also, I don’t raise the temp for the sour cream topping. The oven is hot enough and I bake it another 10 minutes. Follow the rest of the recipe as it is.  After it has chilled, you can top with pie filling(blueberry or cherry is a good choice) or fresh fruit . My family loves this pie.

Turned out great, just like my Mother-in-law used to make. Needs to cool before serving which the instructions do not tell you.  Better if placed in the fridge for a couple hours to cool and set.

Something is very wrong with the measurements. My mixture overflowed the 9" pie shell. It appears that the 2- 8 oz packages of cream cheese should have been maybe 1 - 8 oz. pkg. The taste  was OK, but the mess I had to clean up was not fun. It also took much longer to bake because it was too thin. I will not make it again.

This cheesecake was great. I had company coming the next day and I wanted something to make ahead. It really came out smooth and creamy. I served it with strawberry sauce made from fresh strawberries and it was enjoyed by all.

This is a replica of my grandmothers recipe with one exception... I add a pinch of nutmeg just like grandma to the cream cheese part of the pie.

Love the taste—but the pie needs to be cooked longer than indicated, maybe 5-10 minutes would do it.  My stove is relatively new and I cooked everything as detailed—and my pie was quite runny.

This is a very tasty cheesecake. Everybody I know who tried this loves it. We creamed the sugar with the cream cheese first which resulted less lumps. Also you can mix on high to to make it a little more airy. Finally, after letting it cool to room temperature, we put it in the fridge for at least 4 hours.

Easy to make, followed the instructions to a T. Only difference was that I made my own graham cracker crust and it was Delicious. I recommend anyone to do so.

I made this receipe but the amount was too much for the 1-9 inch prepared crust.  I had to add more time in the oven . It was puffy in the middle, 10 more minutes.   I let it cool down  and it came down.   I'm  wondering if 1-8z.  Cream cheese would have been sufficient.

I only had 5 oz. cream cheese so I halfed the recipe and it turned out delicious. We topped it with our fresh blackberries from the yard and it was soooo good! Reminds me of Marie Callender's Cream Cheese Pie which is what I was going for!

This was VERY good.  I made a Ritz cracker crust because it's what I had on hand and I like the sweet/saltiness of it.  I made the filling as written and the topping as written - but I did do what another reviewer wrote and I microwaved about 1/3 cup of strawberry preserves and dropped small amounts of it in the filling before baking.  Absolutely wonderful recipe!!

I made this recipe exactly as written, but there was no sure way to tell if it was done because the center still seemed under cooked when the time was up. I cooked it another 5 or so more minutes.  The filling was a little dry and tasted too much like a quiche, not a pie. My husband liked it okay, but I won't be making it again.

Easy and delicious!  :)  Oh, and for the person who wanted to know if you eat it warm or chilled, I chill mine. I guess you could eat it warm but it doesn't sound as good.  Try it, you'll love it!

I make this same pie low carb and even lower calorie.  Using liquid splenda or another zero carb sweetener, you can bring the carb count super low.  Also I make my own crust so that lowers the carb count too.  To make it lower calorie, I use homemade plain yogurt instead of sour cream.  I like the tanginess and it's just as thick when I make it homemade.  It nearly cuts the caloreis in half.  I'm making it tonight with sugar, but with yogurt (I am in Africa and we don't have sour cream) and I'm positive everyone will LOVE it.  Wish we had fruit here so I could top it with that!!!

I made this pie to top with some leftover strawberry syrup I made and it fit the bill perfectly. It's rich and delicious enough to stand on its own as well. I used a packaged graham pie crust and my crust was EXTREMELY full, will use a deep dish or make my own next time. No changes, thanks very much for sharing.

This was a great recipe - goes great with your own home made base too. Only tip was to literally pop it in the oven with the sour cream for 5 mins just before serving. If you serve it later the sour cream taste has mellowed and is almost indetectable. Tastes great when its hot out of the oven though !

Delicious cream cheese pie...tastes just like cheese cake, but much easier to make!  I used a homemade graham cracker crust and it came wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe!
