I'm a lazy cook :)  I subbed a large can of pumpkin for the sugar pumpkin and a can of vacuum-packed sweet potatoes for the fresh variety.  I used a tsp of pumpkin pie spice for the spices and used 1/2 c of evaporated milk for the cream.  Although I'm sure fresh is better, this soup turned out very tasty!! And for 140 calories and 6 grams of fat per serving, was quite healthy too.  Will definitely make again.

I thought this soup was very good.  However, next time I am going to omit the whipping cream.  When I put it in my blender to puree it, the cream "whipped" so my soup was more like a mousse.  I don't think it even needs cream.  I think it would be fine on its own.

My family loved this recipe, and my 12-yr-old son said it was a "keeper". My other two kids, both rather finicky eaters, gobbled this right up and asked for more. We used this as a main dish, and therefore DOUBLED the recipe to serve 7 people, which only gave us about 2 leftover servings. Considering the amount of time it took to prep, I'm glad we did that -- I wouldn't have wanted to prep this twice in one day! Some tips: we sliced up the pumpkin and cut out the seeds, then boiled it in water for about 15 minutes to soften it up, making it much easier to pare the skin from the flesh. Because we doubled the recipe, we had to saute the veggies in batches before throwing them all together with the remaining ingredients in our large stockpot. Kid-friendly: 4 stars (if your kids don't like pumpkin or sweet potato to start with, they probably won't like this.) Easiness: 5 stars (it IS easy to make), but quickness, 2 stars -- takes long time to prep! Overall, 5 stars -- it tasted WONDERFUL, and the rave reviews from my parents, husband, and kids made it all worthwhile.

Great soup! Couple of tips, use a food processor to chop all of the veggies, saves significant amount of time chopping. Use an imersion blender to puree the soup, transfering hot soup to a blender can be dangerous! I doubled the recipe and substituted butternut squash for one of the pumpkins. I also had to boil the pumpkin cubes first in order to get the skin off. I served it with hot wheat rolls, all my neighbors are still talking about this soup. I will definitely make this again.

This was a fabulous soup! Really hearty, and the leeks with the squash and sweet potatoes make for a really full flavor combination. These were my alterations:
I can't eat much dairy, so like I do for all cream soups I omitted the cream and it was still wonderful (and MUCH healthier.) I baked the butternut squash instead of trying to peel it, and added it later than the raw vegetables. Also, I don't like the spicy flavors of nutmeg and cloves, and didn't have any of the other spices on hand anyway. I ended up adding a little ginger and thyme and tons of black pepper. I loved that the flavors in the soup can really stand on their own without the spices and cream. This is the best squash soup I've ever made!

All the work cutting the veggies is well worth it. I so enjoyed this soup that I made another batch the same week.

Amazing soup!  I think this will work with any kind of winter squash - there are so many varieties available in the fall.  Instead of using 1 cup heavy cream, I used 1/3 cup heavy cream and 2/3 cup lowfat buttermilk, to cut down on the calories and fat.  I also used ginger instead of nutmeg, because my husband doesn't like nutmeg.  This soup is hearty and tasty, and I will definitely make it again!

This was a delicious soup!  I used butternut squash, instead of pumpkin. I had a hard time cutting it up, so I microwaved it a few minutes, to soften it a bit.  Also, I have never heard of a creamed soup recipe that didn't add the cream at the end, after the puree.  I did it this way and it turned out just fine.  It's a lot of work, but I will make it again.

Unlike many other reviewers, I followed the recipe with the minor exception of using lowfat cream.  It is excellent.  I like a little spice in my soups, so I might toss in one of my homegrilled chipotles in my next batch.  I grew my own leeks and they vary greatly in size but I would estimate that if using store bought leeks, use two that are at least 2 inches in diameter if smaller, use accordingly more.  Basically it appeared to me that the mass of leek and pumpkin should be about equal!

A Thanksgiving hit :) Although I did end up adding a bit of curry powder and dried mustard. Without a little extra spice it was slightly to bland, but still delicious!

Awesome!  I made this with butternut squash instead of the pumpkin, and roasted the squash and potatoes first, mostly to break up the prep time.  I also omitted the cream, as the soup was so rich and tasty on its own.

I followed one reviewer's advice and seeded and boiled the pumpkin in three large pieces to make removal of the rind easier.  I used veggie bouillon to make stock because I was out of chicken stock.  Omitted the celery and cloves, and did not add any cream (and didn't substitute anything for the cream either).  Used half a large can of sweet potatoes, and only 1 leek (as I only had one on hand).  I pureed the soup in small batches in a blender because I don't have an immersion blender, and topped the soup with a sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg.  This was a really tasty, thick puree of a soup.  The flavors are hearty and refreshing, and go well together.  This was really healthy and filling, and I really think you can skip the cream and be okay.

Tasty fall soup. I doubled the recipe and froze individual servings into freezer bags. Just cut the bag open, put into soup bowl and microwave for a few minutes. I used 1 1/2 cup half and half cream and 1/2 cup sour cream instead of 2 cups whipping cream. Also used chicken bullion cube in 2 cups hot water, and 6 cups chicken stock. This way i didn't need additional salt.
Also added 2 small basil leaves and a kaffir lime leaf. Brought a little extra flavor to my soup.

Excellent without cream, with pumpkin spice (as others suggested) and squash instead of sweet potato (out of season)

Thanks Marbalet

This was absolutely fabulous.  I used 2 percent milk instead of cream.  My sweet potatoes must have been pretty big, because it turned out really thick.  I think one could add more chicken stock if necessary.  I'll be making this again.

I love this Pumpkin soup and so do all my friends that I have made for. The other day I made it realized I was out of celery and didn't have time to run to the store. I used cilantro instead and it was wonderful! I used Cinderella Pumpkin as well as it has nice smooth flavor.

This is the best soup I've ever had, and all my friends thought its amazing too! I used butternut squash instead of pumpkin, and chilli flavoured olive oil instead of ordinary, and none of the spices except just a dash of cinnamon because am not a fan. Did not have chicken stock, so I used stock cubes in water instead, and I served the soup with fresh bloomer. You dont even need a main meal after that!

Great fall soup! I'm not usually a big fan of that spice mix, but I wanted to try it anyways. I wasn't crazy about this soup for that reason but it was still good. I didn't want to give a poor review because it's my own personal palate that made it less enjoyable for me, not a flaw in the recipe (plus my room mate LOVED it). I didn't use cream and just added another cup of vegetable stock. I did not puree the soup, I just mashed it with a potato masher because I like a fairly chucky soup. Next time if I was going to mash it, I would add more liquid because it wasn't very soupy. I used a suggestion from a previous reviewer saying to cut the pumpkin into slices and boil for 15 minutes for easier removal of the peel. Great suggestion!

I modified this some. I left out the leek, added a touch of curry, cinamon, ginger for seasonings. I sauteed the onion w/some garlic and added zucchini and celery. I had fresh pumpkin puree so used that w/chicken broth and kept the pumpkin and sweet potato in chunks since my hubyy likes chunky soup. My 3 1/2 yr old ate 2 bowls & said make this everyday. My 2 yr old ate it as well. Yummy. It was thin though...maybe cause I didn't puree the veggies? I also added some shredded pork and rice before serving. I will be making this again!!! Thanks for posting.

I made this for a Thanksgiving dinner.  It was enjoyed by some, but others had difficulty with the texture and unusual flavors.  Not bad, but probably not one I'll try again.

Yummy!!
I did not have cream, or celery and i did not add the spices and it still tasted amazing. I also just stuck the pumpkin in the oven for an hour to cook, then cored, chopped and peeled it. 
I will make this again.

Sorry, but this was quite bland. It may have been partly my fault for possibly adding too much pumpkin and forgetting to put in the bay leaf until the last few minutes, but it was still pretty bad. We had to throw out the leftovers. : (

I have never had anything that tasted like this before it is my new favorite! I topped each bowl with tortilla chips, cayenne pepper and a little bit of shredded Swiss. I usually have to alter recipes that I find but seriously, don't change a thing.

Great soup! All the ingriedients went well together.  I added a little bit of sugar(1/4 cup) and more ground nutmeg and ground cinnamon. I forgot about the celery, but it still tasted great.  Make sure you use a big pot for this one.

Very tasty soup.  the sweet potatos, pumpkin, and leeks meld together well and add depth to the flavor.  i made it to the T except instead of chicken broth, i used homemade vegetable stock.  i was a little skeptical before i pureed it, but it turned out nicely.  i used just a smidgen of the spices, i didn't want them to overwhelm the soup.  i prefer a curried pumpkin to a sweet pumpkin taste.  i must admit peeling a pumkin is a pain in the butt.

Very excellent soup.  Took a while to chop all the veggies, but it was still good.  I used fat free Half and Half instead of the heavy cream and yams instead of sweet potatoes and it tasted great.  Made the house smell very good.

This is a  great cold-weather soup!  It was an awful lot of chopping to do, but definitely worth it!  If you have a food processor, use it!  My hand was sore from chopping so much!  I kept saying "This better be good!", and luckily it was!  lol  I made the recipe to a T, and I thought it needed something, so I added about 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  That was just what it needed (and my husband thought so too).  Thanks, Holly!

Ingredient privation of this small Welsh town determined the exchange of butternut squash for pumpkin, and thai seven spices and herbs de provence for Holly's list of herbs and spices. The recipe worked wonderfully, very comforting, and must be recommended.

Delicious recipe!  I substituted fresh pumpkin for canned pumpkin, reduced the amount of whipping cream by half, didn’t find either salt or pepper necessary, and added a very large Mayan onion.

I made it but used  regular potatoes instead of sweet potatoes. And added some chipotle and some cumin for a gentle touch of heat. Used 2% milk instead of heavy whipping cream. Very yummy and totally filling

Delicious!  I had to substitute pumpkin I had previously pureed and frozen.  I just added it at the end.  Also used 10% cream because that's what I happen to have.

I really like this simple method of making a truly delicious soup! I dislike prepping pumpkins or butternut squash, so I usually prepare them in advance by roasting in the oven, pureeing and freezing in containers that hold about the equivalent of 1 small can (14 oz) pumpkin puree. I add the thawed puree to the soup when the other veggies are tender. I do not use a full cup of cream - this time used half cream, half milk, and it was fine. My whole family loved this soup.

This is a wonderful fall soup, especially with crusty rosemary bread. I subbed coconut milk for cream, omitted the celery, and used veg broth. I used slightly more than a pinch of each of the spices, but I think it's a good idea to start light. This would also be good with some fresh ginger and coriander.

None of us liked this. It ended up as dog food. I had the feeling I messed something up, the recipe was rather vague on amounts, but I'm a 'dump' cook- just dump stuff in- so it might of been my combination.

Because the ingredient list was too vague, the soup turned out to have more the texture of hummus than soup although the flavor was good.  (Perhaps too many leeks, sweet potatoes and pumkin for the stock?)

Agreed- this recipe is A LOT of work and doesn't need any cream to make it hearty. It's hard to gauge the amount of vegetables the recipes calls for from the description, but the mix seems forgiving. End result is delicious and nutritious, and filling enough to be a main course (perhaps with some crusty bread).

This was absolutely delicious!  The only thing that would have been good is to have the actual amounts of vegies, since size varies so much.  I ended up using more broth, and whole milk instead of heavy cream (the milk has much more cream here in Australia).  Also, I did not have cloves, but the recipe was still marvelous.

I thought this soup looked beautiful and tasted good.  But strangely, my husband hated it and thought it was too sweet!  I followed the recipe fairly closely and didn't add any sugar, so he must have just been tasting the spices.  I didn't think it was sweet at all, so my husband's impression seems very odd to me.  But I don't love it enough to make it just for myself, especially considering the prep time, so this will probably be the last time I make it.

I also used canned pumpkin to make things easier, and it turned out just fine.  My husband ate it, but didn't seem to like it too much.  But, that's ok because he doesn't feel a meal is a meal if there's not meat involved.
I for one really like it!

This is a great source of Vitamin A. The sage works well in this soup, and the leeks are a good addition. My family rates this as a keeper.
