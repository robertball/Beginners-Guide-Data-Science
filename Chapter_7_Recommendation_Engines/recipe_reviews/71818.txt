I've made this recipe twice, the second time doubling it, but using only 10oz spinach.  I used Parmesan Reggiano for the cheese (3/4 cup for the doubled recipe) and for the vegies, sauteed some onions, red peppers.  Also added some chopped fresh flat leaf parsley and chopped fresh basil.  They came out like little frittatas - the recipe made 16, so I cooled them, wrapped them individually, put them all in a large zip bag and froze them.  If yours are soggy when you reheat them out of the freezer, you may not be drying out the spinach well enought.  It has to be super dry before you add it to the mixture - drain it really, really well.  I squeeze it out in a clean tea towel.  My son and husband love these, and we all have a couple for breakfast on weekdays when there isn't time to cook.  A little salt (the parmesan tends to be salty) and fresh ground black pepper really adds a lot of flavor, too.

Five stars if you modify and than these are awesome!  I'm starting Southbeach tomorrow and made them today and if they're this good when you haven't started dieting, they must be good.  Here's my version to make larger, double size so you only have one and they really are filling:  Spray tins, don't use liners.  10 oz. spinach (squeeze, squeeze, squeeze the moisture out); 2 cups liquid egg; 1-1/2 cup cheese, 1 bag onion/pepper stir fry (frozen, it's about 2 cups) - sauteed with 4 tsps. minced garlic and then chopped; 6 drops of hot sauce.  I mixed it all up and seasoned with about 1-2 tsp. seasoning salt. Filled 12 regular size muffin tins (full).  Sprinkled each with a bit of pepper and topped with diced tomato pieces.  I also added a couple Tbsp. of Real Bacon bits, but it really wasn't necessary.  Baked at 325 for about 40 minutes.  Wonderful!

These are great as the recipe is written, but I have made them a dozen different ways.  One of my favorite combos is to use red bell pepper instead of green, adding baby spinach and finely chopped canadian bacon.  I freeze them in foil muffin cups, peel the muffin cup off the quiche, and pop in the microwave; almost as easy as grabbing a donut!

These Quiche cups are gross.  Most of the people giving this recipe high ratings are all saying the same thing - it's great if you change it.  So the vegetable quiche cups to go are not great...some other recipe is great.  

I'm going to try some of the variations suggested here.  I hope they are better than mushy spinach cups to go.

My husband and I love these (and neither of us care for spinach). I doubled the recipe except for the spinach and there was still plenty of spinach in the cups and they held togehter perfectly. I replaced the extra 3/4 c. cheddar with low fat cottage cheese. For the peppers and onions, I put half of a bag of pepper stirfry in my food processor to mince. I also added 1 tsp. dry mustard and extra hot sauce. This made 20 perfect cups that have only lasted 2 days between my husband and I. We eat them for breakfast and snacks because they're so healthy. They're great on their own but also good with fresh tomato salsa. I made some with paper liners and some without and I liked them better with out because the sides browned better (worked even better in my dark pan over my light one). Next time I'm gonna try adding turkey bacon to them and would also like to try it with brocolli. Wonderful recipe that I will continue to use after SBD Phase 1.

I altered my favorite quiche recipe to be south beach friendly. It involves using another combination of "appropriate" veggies.  For the green, using chopped poblano peppers rather than spinach.  You avoid the soggy factor and get much more flavor.  I saute the onion, some minced garlic and cumin seeds in olive oil, add the poblano and saute until soft. Add diced tomatoes and saute. (I like drained Italian canned, but you could use fresh.)  In a mixing bowl,combine liquid egg substitute and cheese.  Add vegetable mixture to the bowl and mix.  Add to the muffin tin, and voolah.  20 min at 350 was great in my oven, and I definitely recommmend doubling the recipe.

I give 5 stars to my update on this recipe... it needs something extra!
I was on South Beach for a while, and even though I don't need it anymore, I still make these every week for breakfast for myself! I double it so it will last for a couple of weeks.

2 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach 
5 eggs (or 6 if you like it really “eggy”)
1 ½  cup shredded cheese (or more if you want it more cheesy) 
½  cup diced green or red bell pepper (red makes it sweeter)
½ cup diced onion (optional)
any other veggies you want diced up: water chestnuts, zucchini, broccoli, etc…
8-10 drops hot-pepper sauce (it doesn’t make it spicy, trust me, so add more if you want it spicy)
½ to 1 pound of breakfast sausage (optional), patties or links with casings removed, crumbled, cooked, and drained
Salt and pepper (don’t be afraid of it, there’s a lot of eggs and veggies to season, use your best judgement)
My take on this makes between 24 and 28 cups, depending on how full you fill the muffin tin. And I don't use muffin cups, just spray with no-stick spray! They're wonderful!

These were great!  I made them with 3 whole eggs, light mozzarela cheese and broccoli.  Will definitely make again and will try various recipes.  Only note is I did have to cook them 5 minutes longer than the directions indicated... though I like my eggs dry dry dry! :-)  THANKS

Love this!  Perfect for the South Beach dieter who doesn't like eggs and loves spinach.  For me, breakfast was the hardest part of going with South Beach - I was a lifelong cereal eater.  This really got me started.  Have also used chopped broccoli with great success.

Try adding frozen chopped broccoli -- it's delicious and hardly adds any calories. 

If you make a large quantity and freeze them, defrost them in the microwave, then put them in the toaster oven for a few minutes so they're not so soggy.

I've made this several times now using different veggies...only tried spinach once. We prefer bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, you could mix anything you want in these. I bake them in my Pampered Chef stone muffin pan with no liner or greasing, my is well seasoned.

I cheated and used the pre-made southwest egg beaters and some cheddar cheese.  Sooo easy and delicious! However, the proportions listed only made 6 and they were really small at that, so I would definitely double or triple the recipe.

After I reached my target weight on the South Beach Diet, I modified this recipe to make them a little bigger and heartier.  I use one entire 15oz container of Egg Beaters.  I saute chopped onions and red or green peppers with 4oz turkey sausage until cooked through.  I mix in the defrosted spinach or broccoli and 1/2 cup low fat swiss or cheddar cheese.  I divide the mixture in a jumbo 6 count muffin tin and bake for 30 minutes at 350 degrees.  They are great alone or made into a breakfast sandwich with a toasted whole wheat english muffin.

Decreased amount of spinach and used 3 eggs instead of egg mixture. Only made 9, not 12.

These are so good!  I used 3 real eggs, green onions, mushrooms, and swiss cheese in addition to the spinach.  (To avoid sogginess, be sure to press ALL the liquid out of the thawed spinach.)  I love the convenience of making these in advance, freezing them...and then being able to just warm them in the microwave for breakfast on the run!

The first time I made these I followed the directions exactly and didn't care for them.  The next time, I halved the spinach and threw in some diced Canadian bacon, and it was marvelous!

I thought these were very good, except next time I'll cut the spinach in half. It was a little too much for me. They are very easy and you can use whatever veggies you  want. I used some cut up canned artichoke hearts, mushrooms, green peppers and onions.

I doubled the amount of egg when I saw what the batter looked like and they were still very spinach-y.  However, with tweaking to my personal taste it was a good basic recipe.

The idea is good, the flavor....Dont get me wrong, i like spinach but geez, the flavor of spinach dominated these little babies to the point where you couldnt tasta anything else. I'm thinking this would be good with a lot less spinach and maybe some mushrooms and a little turkey bacon...

This recipe is wonderful -- what a time-saver!  I used egg substitute with peppers, celery, and onions already included in its ingredients, so I didn't even have to dice up those veggies!  They baked perfectly, and they taste great for ANY meal on-the-go.  Thanks!

This is similar to a recipe I use that calls for 3 eggs instead of egg substitute. I added 1 small cloves of garlic, sea salt, and fresh ground pepper and the Spinach Muffins as my husband calls them taste great! It also cuts down on Breakfast prep work which I like since for two people they last nearly a week!

First time making these, they were OK at best.  I actually heard about this recipe from a coworker who is currently on the SBD and she raved about these.  So I decided to try it, modified first time around.  Reason why I only gave it 3 stars was because it was too much spinach for my tastes - and I even used the whole carton of Egg Beaters, can't imagine what they would of tasted like with only a 3/4 cup! I made it as follows: 10oz pkg spinach thoroughly drained and blotted with paper towels, 1 whole carton of southwestern style Egg Beaters (has the onions and peppers already in it), 1/2 cup reduced-fat feta cheese.  Baked at 375 degrees for about 40mins (the centers just weren't setting, plus my oven takes longer it seems), when done I sprinkled reduced-fat shredded cheddar cheese on the tops and put back in oven until melted. I will probably make these again, just cutting back on the spinach by probably about a 1/3.

I make these every week and have modified each time. My favorite way is with broccoli instead of spinich and adding red pepper and chopped canadian bacon. Also, I add reduced fat shredded mozzarella cheese. Recently I added a spoonful of crumbled goat cheese to each muffin cup once the mixture was poured in. Delish! I make enough for the week and refridgerate them in a ziplock. Each morning I put a couple in the toaster oven for 5 minutes and they are perfect, and not soggy. They were soggy in the microwave.

I have mixed feelings on this recipe, as the result with modifications was at least a 4 star, but as written it is more like a 2 star.  I am glad I read the reviews and comments on recipes before trying them for some variation ideas and tips.  As others have said, make sure the spinach is as moisture free as you can get it after microwaving.  I emptied it onto a strong paper towel, wrapped and twisted out the moisture.  Yes, I am sure I was loosing some of the healthy juices in the spinach, but didn’t want a soggy, mushy mess and the directions only state to drain the excess liquid.  Also, I found the recipe as written to be too heavy on the spinach, so I doubled everything but the spinach, and not quite double on the cheese, maybe a cup to a cup and a quarter.  I still used 12-cup muffin pan with foil baking cups sprayed with cooking spray.  The cups were almost full to the top.  I cooked for 30 minutes, since I was making bigger cups.  The modified version came out great.  Two of these are a good size for an easy breakfast meal.  The kids and I both enjoyed them.  I will add a little seasoning to the mix before cooking next time, as I think it could have used a little pepper, garlic, etc.

This is an excellent breakfast, it makes enough that I store them in individual containers and they make a quick breakfast when Im on my way to work. They smell so good.

Pretty yummy for a low fat, low carb recipe. I added chopped tomatoes instead of the green pepper, and some smoked turkey deli meat. Also added thyme and garlic salt for taste, and sprinkled cheese on top. Great and easy recipe!

A lot of people have mentioned that they used less spinach, and added some other things - I DEFINITELY recommend doing so! I made these exactly as the recipe suggested and froze them to have for breakfast on my first week of South Beach. By the end of the week, I couldn't eat any more - they were like big wet piles of spinach w/a little bit of egg/peppers here and there. NASTY. Even if you're using egg substitute, I think this recipe would be much improved by using 2 or 3x the amount of egg product and about half the spinach - unless you are a huge fan of soggy spinach!!

Very good.  I used red peppers instead of green, real eggs instead of substitute and it was great. I made a bunch, then froze them in two packs for a fast meal later on.

I'm not on South Beach, but these are so good and really are a great take along meal or snack. I too added a bit more egg and some seasonings. Delish!

These are really fantastic for breakfast esp. if you are on Phase 1 of the South Beach Diet. Instead of a muffin pan, I used mini pie pans. I'm not freezing these because they are so great, they're gonna be gone FAST. PS) I eat mine cold.

Unfortunately, these are just awful.  I've tried three SBD recipes, two of which nearly turned me off to SBD altogether.  Said this to a friend currently on SBD, and she said that the same two recipes didn't come out for her either, but to keep plugging.

After mixing all the ingredients, it seemed like there was too much spinach so I just added more egg to it.  It was quite good. Since I love mushroom (cooked with garlic powder and Benecol margarine) omelets, I think I'll try these again with mushrooms and asparagus.  Yummm.

easy and delicious make-ahead meal. i took previous reviewers' tips (squeezed and squeezed the spinach, put mix directly into greased muffin tins). i also used real eggs (can't find the substitute here in rural japan), regular cheese, 1 clove fresh garlic, salt, pepper, and jalapeno powder. i topped some with (strained) diced tomatoes, but i think they're better without the topping. it may just be my stove, but i had to cook for 30+ minutes at 180 degrees celsius.

I did slightly modify this recipe.  I love, LOVE, spinach and feta cheese omelets.  So, I adapted this recipe to taste like my favorite omelet.  I used 3 Eggland’s Best Eggs, 1 package of chopped frozen spinach and ¾ cup of reduced-fat feta cheese.  Next time, I’ll add two more eggs to even out the spinach to egg taste.  Another plus, if you work outside of the house this is a good snack/breakfast to bring to work.

I used broccoli, bell peppers and garlic.  No onion because I didn't have any.  It would be helpful to know how much of the raw egg mixture counts as a single cup so I know I'm making them the right size.

This is a very yummy easy dish to make. I didn't alter at all. We love spinach so it was perfect. My entire family loves this one. I usually serve it with some cooked canadian bacon. I even keep some already cooked in the fridge for snacks during the day. My 8 month old also likes it. I mush it up for her and she gobbles it up. Definately a winner.

This is a great recipe.  I like to double it and bake it in a medium casserole dish.  I cut it in squares and freeze. (You do have to cook it a little longer this way.) Also, I always salt  it and eat it with light cream cheese on it.

Great if you modify, like everyone else. Sort of combined the quiche cups with the canadian bacon egg  cups...Used less than half the spinach and added 1/4 large green pepper chopped, 5 mushrooms chopped, and 1/2 large onion chopped. Put the canadian bacon on the bottom as per the other recipe, baked at 400. Also added seasoned salt. Used montery jack cheese as a topper. We'll see how they freeze, but they're great fresh out of the oven!

These weren't too bad considering they're for a diet, but there was way too much spinach. Next time I will use less spinach and add mushrooms and bacon.

I made these at the start of the SBD. I found the spinach to be over-whelming (and I love spinach). I also do not think they freeze well. I agree with the other reviews that varying the ingrdients might help. I prefer the baked egg with Canadian bacon recipe over this one.

I loved the fact that this recipe is simple and easy to make, and the final results were great.  I did, however make some changes.  I didn't put any onions into the quiches, and I added more spinach than what was originally recommended.  However, even with those variables being altered, the quiche cups turn out wonderfully every time.

These are great!  I cannot actually account for how they would taste if you completely follow the recipe, though.  I followed some other reviewers suggestions and modified it a bit to suit it more to taste.  I doubled the egg beaters, almost doubled the cheese, and added a chopped up package of deli ham, as well as some garlic.  I didn't have to change the cooking directions at all.  We absolutely love these, and they're extremely easy to freeze individually and then just pop in the microwave in the morning!  YUMMY!

This is a really good recipe but too much spinach, and I love spinach. I also mixed in green onions and celery and it was really good. I am going to double the recipe next time for everything but the spinach. They freeze well and make for a great quick breakfast. Can't wait to try it with turkey bacon mixed in.

I also used the egg substitute with onions and peppers in it already.  I think next time I will probably chop the fresh veggies, though, because there aren't as many veggies in the egg substitute as I would have liked.  These are really quick and easy to make...and they taste pretty good, too!  I will definitley make these again...and probably quadruple the recipe next time!  I haven't tried these after they've been frozen, so I hope they're good!

This is a good and quick breakfast. Can reheat in the micorwave in less that 2 minutes. I find that I like this better made with chopped broccoli. The spinach tastes a little bitter, even using name brand spinach instead of store brand. Adding a few drops of red pepper sauce also improves the flavor.

These were great! It's very nice that I can freeze the rest that I don't eat and just heat them up in the microwave later. Very tasty and filling!

This recipe is real good for those on the go in the morning. I just make a few batches, freeze them, and microwave what I want in the morning. I also add some mushrooms to it. Tasty.

Good breakfast item, especially to bring to work.  The quiches freeze and microwave well.  I don't like spinach, so I added green pepper and green chiles instead.  Yum!

I love these!  Lots of different variations to make and you can use whatever you have on hand!  I usually use a 6-cup muffin tin instead of 12 as it doesn't call for a lot of liquid.  My most recent version called for fresh wilted baby spinach and about 5 slices of crumbled leftover turkey bacon.  I make these at the beginning of the week and microwave to have a quick, healthy, breakfast on the go!

I made this recipe when I was on the South Beach diet.  The quiche cups taste fresh and delicious even if they are frozen.  I would make an entire batch, then take individual ones out of the freezer and warm in toaster oven each morning.

AWESOME!  I made 3 versions of this. First was the original as posted, which was just YUMMY! Second was the original recipe with broccoli instead of spinach. Another YUMMO! Finally, I made a batch with the broccoli and with some diced turkey breast (leftover from Thanksgiving), and ANOTHER hit!

These are so easy to make, store, freeze, reheat, ENJOY!

This was very tasty and easy to make. I only had fresh baby spinach, so i wilted it and added it to the egg mixture. I didn't have any bell peppers so I skipped it. I also added a couple slices of bacon that I crumbled and a little extra hot sauce. I didn't have any muffin cups, so I just used baking spray and the eggs popped right out of the pan. These are a terrific way to start the day. Thanks!

These are very good and very easy to make to your taste.  I put 3 colours of peppers, onions, spinach and cheese and used 6 eggs instead of the egg substitute.  However, I find they need something.  I'm  not quite sure what yet.  Maybe some salt?  Garlic?  They are a little bland but they freeze very well and take only 30 seconds to microwave.

I altered the recipe as I had no spinach. I put in heaps of diced  red/yellow/green peppers - mushrooms 3 real eggs(as per book recipe) , and red onion. then put a small piece of feta cheese in each - DELICIOUS! - (not very original recipe but not soggy) Off to make more to freeze as I have no time in the morning for breakfast.

Recipe is good modified.  I used green pepper for more flavor, crushed red pepper, less spinach, and sharp cheddar cheese.  If you have more egg than spinach the leftovers won't be as soggy.

I made these exactly as recipe called (but sprinkled salt and pepper on before serving) and thought them tasty, although a bit skimpy looking.  Next time I will try baking twice as much in each cup, as the recommended serving is two anyway.  I did freeze them and they reheated nicely in the microwave.

I had to use a full cup of liquid egg, because there is so much spinach I didn't think there would be anything to hold these together while baking! But they turned out anyway, and I thought they tasted quite good and were perfect for taking to work. I used feta cheese this time - will try other combinations next time.

Great recipe!  You really don't need to add more egg, it looks like you do when you are pouring them in the muffin tins but don't they really turn out great.  I didn't use the paper cups either.  I add salsa on the top of these when I eat them in the morning (in my car)  what a great breakfast on the go.  Also you can make these as little appetizers in the mini muffin tins...just pop them in your mouth!!

The recipe calls for a little too much spinach--I doubled the recipe, that may be the problem. I would have liked something with more egg in it. I will try again with different veggies...

I don't even like spinach but I thought these were really tasty.  I use a little more egg and lots of extra red peppers for the filling.  Make sure you double (or triple!) the recipe because they will go VERY fast!

This is really good and quie filling, surprisingly.  I'm not a fan of spinache or I substituted chopped broccoli and mushrooms.  It was much tastier this way!

I raved about these to my MIL (doing SBD too:) and can't wait to make more. 12 were gone the same day I made them so I haven't tried them after freezing yet but quiche usually does fantastic in the freezer.
If you love spinach and eggs... this is a definite keeper! It is on my favorites list for sure!
