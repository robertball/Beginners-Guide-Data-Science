This was a DELICIOUS salad, easily the best part of our meal tonight. The only thing I changed was to use a romaine/spinach mix because I had spinach leftover to use up. I did not find it necessary to add extra salt to the dressing but I did add some black pepper, because I add that to most everything. I will not only make this again, I can't wait to share the recipe with my sister :-) Thanks so much! (P.S. If you're new to cooking nuts or ramen on the stovetop it's worth mentioning that you have to MOVE THEM constantly once you can 'hear' them cooking or else it's going to burn. It also helps to use a high-heat oil instead of butter which is kind of bad for heating stuff for long periods as it has a lower burn point. I like sesame oil but any kind would work really. I did use butter for this recipe but only half success really--some of my ramen was a bit overdone, some underdone. Will use sesame oil next time.)

I've been making this for years and it's always a huge hit.  It is so easy and so good, and makes you look like a pro chef.  I've altered it a number of ways based on what I have in my fridge.  At one time or another I've used pecans, green leaf lettuce, balsamic and even white vinegar, no scallions, etc. One time I went without the ramen and while no one else knew better, I definitely missed it.  I also always cut the dressing in about half.  All in all this is an awesome recipe.

I made a huge dinner for my parents tonight, and everyone went back for seconds on the salad. It was so good! Be careful when cooking the noodles and walnuts - they will burn very quickly!

This is an excellent salad that I have been making for years.  I recommend using apples in place of the strawberries and then adding crumbled feta cheese and craisins-- even non-salad eaters come back for seconds!

The flavor was good, however I was not happy about all the butter and the sugar. I think next time I will toast the walnuts in the oven with the noodles to avoid the butter, then cut the sugar in half since the strawberries already provide natural sugars. The texture and taste was excellent though.

I make this salad in large quanities for church functions.  I use pecans and bake them in the over.  I also bake the ramen noodles.  I don't use any butter and it is never missed.  Instead of strawberries I use fresh broccoli.  People love this salad.

Wow, is this ever delicious! I loved this salad. I used a baby blend of romaine and spinach. I had trouble with the nuts browning faster than the ramen noodles though and didn't get to cook this as long as stated because I didn't want to burn the nuts. I used nut pieces instead of halves and they tended to stay on the bottom of the skillet beneath the ramen noodles... other than that, this recipe is terrific. You must try this salad, you won't believe how good this is!

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this Salad!  I maybe used a combo Romaine-Baby Spinach, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Making it again tonight with Baby Spinach.  It's beautiful and tastes so delish.. I'm keeping it to myself for now, and planning on making it for our Christmas Family gathering -- then I'll share the recipe :)

I really loved this, and will make it again.  Don't forget to season the dressing with S & P!  I think it would be equally good with dried cranberries or dried blueberries or a combo.  This would also make it more adaptable to other seasons when strawberries are not as good.

Spectacular!  I left out the walnuts because we are not a big fan, but it did not matter.  It was so good.  Made it last night and the friend I served it to just called and asked for the recipe.  Super easy and super good. Thanks!

I took this salad to my sister's birthday party and it was gone in no time flat. I followed all the directions and it was perfect. I'm making it again tonight in a smaller batch as my husband loved it. I will be taking this salad to all my future gatherings.

Delicious salad, the walnuts and the ramen noodles added a nice crunch and the dressing was just sweet enough. Be careful when sauteing the walnuts and noodles, they burn easily, so you only really need to do them for 3 or 4 minutes.

This is a delicious salad. I had some grilled chicken breast that I wanted to use up, and it combined very nicely by just shredding a couple of cups and stirring in before adding the dressing. My whole family really enjoyed it!

This was good.  My only issue was that the dressing was too sweet.  I would definately cut it in half and add more if you want to.  Rating it a 3 as my guests either raved (5 stars) or didn't like.
There wasn't much middle ground.

GREAT salad! I mixed the dressing the night before, toasted pecans and ramen night before in oven with no butter, and put all of it together right before serving. Made for fathers day brunch, two adult guys ate it up, BFs picky 9 year old gave a few bites a try- which is success in our book. Planning to take this to a potluck this week, in season strawberries make this incredibly good and cheap for LOTS of people. (I used 3/4 of the dressing and also chopped the romaine into VERY small bites, tasted great!) Thanks!

A hit with the kids, well, they picked out the strawberries and ate them first, and left the romaine.  I thought it was pretty good too.  Will make again :)

This salad was awesome! I loved the crunchiness of it and the fresh strawberries made the salad! The only thing I would say is you don't need as much butter for the ramen and walnuts, I used about 1/2 of what is called for! LOVED THIS!!

Nice combination of flavors and textures.  I used pecans instead of walnuts- just a personal preference - but they worked well.

Made this salad to go with grilled burgers and baked beans last night.  Had family over.  It was a huge hit.  Just be careful when cooking the walnuts and ramen noodles - burnt them the first time cause I walked away.  Will make this again for sure!!!

I loved this and will definitely make it again!!!  I doubled the dressing, and will most likely double the noodles and walnuts next time - that part really made the salad stand out and there just wasn't enough of that for me!!  The flavor of the toasted walnuts was perfect with the other ingredients.  I also added a little salt and pepper to taste (to my own portion).  Yum!!  Leslie - I saw your recipe first in Simple & Delicious - congrats on winning the grand prize!

I made this recipe for a group of women.  They all loved it and came back for seconds.  I really like the ramen noodles in the salad.  It was something new and tasty.  The wanuts and noodles turned out great in the butter and didn't burn.  I did stir them continuously.  This is the perfect salad for a luncheon, summer salad, or even a dinner salad.

This was a great and simple salad.  The only changes I made were I put the walnuts and ramen in without toasting them -- it still turned out wonderfully.

Made this salad for dinner last night.  My husband and I both thought it was very good.  I made it as writeen except for the butter.  There's no way I could justify putting 1/2 a stick of butter in a salad!!!  I used only about 1 tablespoon, and it was great.  I also used seasoned rice wine vinegar instead of red wine which means that I also omitted the sugar since the rice wine is sweetened.

Overall we thought it was great.  Very fresh and light for a summer night's dinner.  My husband, of course, had to add grilled chicken to his!  :-)  We'll definetely make again, especially when strawberries are in season, as they are now.  Great way to use up all those juicy red strawberries!

I used EVOO instead of vegtable oil and made it in a blender.  Then I used almonds instead of walnuts.  SO GOOD!! It does not take 8-10 minutes to toast the noddles and almonds.  Watch them.

This was so good.  My husband and son both turned their noses up when I told them what I made for dinner, but once they tried it- they both had seconds!  The sweetness from the berries really plays well with the tangy flavor of the dressing, and the crunchy mix of ramen and walnuts adds texture and interest.  Love it!

I thought this was a great salad.  Both my husband and I said it needed cheese though.  I think it would be great with goat cheese.  I'm also either going to bake the nuts and noodles or use 1/2 the amount of butter.  I want to keep it lite.  I also used Splenda in the dressing.

I made this but I changed it up a bit. I used spinach instead of romaine. My husband, who said he HATED spinach, LOVES it. I make this almost EVERY weekend. I wonder how raspberries would taste.....? Thank you for this delicious salad!!

Dear Gussie! I don't know when I have fallen in love with a salad as quickly.  My husband had a fit over it; he wanted me to make it again the next day. I'll be making this recipe again and again.  The only change I made was to use curly-leaf lettuce instead of Romaine.  Definitely worth 5 stars.  Many thanks.  Pat

We loved this! I'm always amazed at what ramen noodles can do to transform a salad =) especially toasted with butter and nuts (I used pecans, as I prefer them). Incredible salad! I loved how the ingredients came together so quickly and so perfectly. I eyeballed the measurements and adjusted to my liking...easier than making more dishes =) Great as a light meal. Perfect for serving to guests. If the soy sauce has you hesitating to make this, wait no longer. You'll thank Leslie over and over for sharing this treat!!

This was the first salad I have made from a recipe and I thought it was great! It has a nice sweet, strawberry taste and the walnuts and ramen noodles add a nice crunch. I would be careful in cooking the walnuts and noodles to be sure not to overcook them.

Yum! Made the dressing exactly as written and loved it! If you like cabbage salad with ramen noodles and nuts, you'll love this one, too!  Works equally well as a side or main dish. Chunks of swiss or mozzarella cheese are also yummy additions.

Good stuff!  Family loved it, it was very refreshing and pretty, and it was quick and easy to prepare.  It was a a great complement to our BBQ ribs and zucchini frittata.  Thanks, Leslie!

This recipe is amazing!! I didn't have a jar, so i just prepared the dressing in the bowl i was going to serve the salad in then i added the lettuce and the strawberries when i was ready to serve. I would also suggest adding a TBSP or 2 of poppyseeds for some more texture. I also didn't add the onions the first time around and it still tasted great!

Great salad! I made a few changes due to personal preference. I omitted the ramen noodles because there are a lot of fat in it and I'm not a big fan of it anyway. I used splenda instead of sugar, and olive oil instead of regular oil. The green onions give a really nice flavor to this salad. Thanks Leslie, I will definitely make this again!

This one is a keeper. I made it on a whim one night, because we had some extra strawberries handy, and chicken as well. The dressing is what does it. My family LOVED it! Note: my kids, who are typically not really picky eaters, were not especially fans...my son didn't like the walnuts in the salad.

This is my new favorite salad.  Add grilled chicken to make it a main dish meal.  Also works well with toasted slivered almonds instead of walnuts.  Yummy!

Made per recipe. I would reduce the sugar by half. Very sweet. Otherwise the combination of flavors and textures is great!!
