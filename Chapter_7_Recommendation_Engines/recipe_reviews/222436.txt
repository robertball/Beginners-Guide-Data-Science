WOW! I found it to be fabulous and very unique! The only thing I changed was to use Sugar Free, no calorie maple syrup. I will be serving it at a BBQ on Monday and can't wait for people's reactions when they learn it is kale.

I can't believe the low stars. For the person who had too sticky and too sweet, are you sure you measured right? Or did you use processed syrup, not real maple?  We made these and after they cooled for a minute, they were flaky crisp, with a slightly sweet taste, mixed in with a touch of salt.  I combine the oil and the syrup and after pouring on the mixture, I mixed and scrunched the kale together on the baking sheet to achieve an even coating.  A surprisingly HUGE hit even for my healthy food "neigh-sayers."

Yummy! The only problem is that the directions are a bit vague. Be sure to rub each leaf with oil to evenly crisp during baking. You should do the same with the maple syrup.

I've been making kale chips for years now, and when I found this recipe it was like a light bulb going off. Maple syrup goes really well with kale! I use almond oil instead of olive oil, although the saturated-to-unsaturated profiles are virtually identical. There's also a variation I've seen floating around where you use bacon grease instead of oil to make "maple bacon kale chips". I used 100% grade A syrup. Grade B is lighter and not as thick. If you like kale chips, this is a great variation to try.

This is the best recipe for kale chips I've tried. The sweetness of the maple syrup really balances the bitterness of the kale. Just make sure to remove from the pan before they cool or you'll never get them off.

I had made baked Kale chips before, and was intrigued by this variation.  I read the reviews, and decided that I'd halve the maple syrup, because I didn't want them to be too sweet.  A ratio of 1 Tbsp. oil to 1 Tbsp. syrup seemed right, and it was!  However, my "bunch" of kale was big I think, because when cut and laid out in a single layer, it filled two large cookie sheets. Even though I did whisk the oil and syrup to blend them in advance, and tossed the torn kale pieces well to coat them (as if tossing a salad--I used a latex glove to cover my hand, because that made even coverage easiest, without a sticky oily hand--which meant I solved the last time's problem when I ended up with uneven texture--great flavour, but some chips were a little chewy, while others were crispy). Doubling the oil and syrup (2 T. each) to better coat the amount of kale I have, and lowering the oven temperature by 25 degrees, because after 10 minutes (alternating the sheets on top and bottom racks halfway through) some were almost burnt. Coating only two sheets' worth at a time also improves kale coverage. I used a small jar with ounce marking to both mix and measure oil/syrup mixture as I used it--worked marvellously.  Shake sea salt over before baking. Very popular with everyone...even my four-year-old granddaughter!  Will make again, and often, I expect!

These turned out pretty well. If i was going to make these again, i would mix the syrup and olive oil in a bowl. Then i would mix the kale in the mixture to coat. And then I would put it on the baking sheet. I think that might infuse the kale with more of the maple flavor. I wish I thought of it before I put mine in the oven!

Funny. I've been making these every week since discovering this recipe 2 months ago.... I just noticed I've been using 2 tbsp of evi and 1 tbsp of mp where you have it flipped the other way around. Lol... Mine are still absolutely delicious too! ;)

Holy Cow was this good! We had this at our work as part of our health and wellness program and I couldn't get enough. I've had many different types of kale chips but this one was the best.

I mix my oil and maple syrup (REAL maple syrup please!) in a ziploc and let it sit for a few minutes.  I spread it on my dehydrator trays before sprinkling with salt.  Lots of salt.  I then turn on my dehydrator to 110 degrees for 8 hours.
I love this.  It is like caramel popcorn with kale instead of corn.  Definitely one of my favorites - even the kids love it.

This was NOT a hit in our house.  These were so sticky we could not pick them up.  They were also way too sweet.

I just tried this recipe to go with my lunch today.  It was delicious!  I washed up a small amount of Kale, dried it and allowed my pan to warm up in the oven.  I mixed 1 tbs of extra virgin olive oil, 1 tbs of real maple syrup and a pinch of sea salt together.  Then I poured the mixture gradually over the kale as I mixed it.  I removed the hot pan from the oven and dumped the kale on it.  I used a really hot oven - 400 degrees - and stirred the kale a few times while it cooked and got crisp.  The touch of maple takes the bitter tastes of the kale away.  I will definitely make this again!

Great healthy snack!  Love the crispy sweet & salty taste! Will try to make them again---next time with coconut oil as someone suggested.

This is super good- our kids loved it. I omitted the parchment paper it was really difficult to remove from the baking sheet. A light layer of cooking spray works better. I also found I needed to bake a little longer than what originally stated. But they're really good!

Oh my gosh!!! So good! I don't usually review things but...too good not to! Just one tip remove right after baking from the sheet. I was using it as a garnish for salmon and let the kale sit...my mistake. I just scraped it off and good to go!

Mine are still in the oven but, I have tasted them and they are very good. The only change I made was rather than salt I used one teaspoon of Tony Chachere's Cajun seasoning for a little kick. I also mixed the oil, syrup and seasoning together and then tossed the leaves with my hands after drizzling on the mixture. I set the timer for 10 minutes and they barely started to crisp; after turning them over I set it again for 5 minutes, they are better now they have cooked down, so I reset it for 5 more minutes. Timer just went off. They are very close not, but five more minutes should do it. Twenty-five minutes total.I turned them over each time so they won't burn. There are certainly a lot less after cooking down. Very tasty.

I replaced the olive oil with coconut oil and the kale chips were so good. Next time, I might reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp.

oh man...didn't like it, couldn't eat it. Everyone in the house didn't care for it at all. 1st time I've ever made this preparation, so I can honestly say, won't again. Sorry to those that do like kale chips. It wasn't pleasing to anyone's taste buds. Sorry

They turned out well, especially considering my last attempt at Kale Chips. I took them out a little early, so most were crunchy but not all.  I put leftovers in a preheated oven for a minute or two - they were great!! Added a bit more salt, they were gone!

The only problem is that they were gone too quickly.   My family generally has issues with kale & my savory kale chips were only enjoyed by me so I decided to try this.   The family is begging for more.   I used purple kale & followed recipe exactly.

Literally, just made this recipe and eating kale chips directly from the pan. Yummy! I only made changes in baking temp and time. I baked at 300 F for 10 minutes, turned kale then baked another 10 minutes. Light and crisp chips!

Great! Just use less salt! The recipe was great - just a touch of sweetness. BUT there was way too much salt in the recipe. I would use 1/4-1/2 tsp next time and add more at the end if needed.

These are really good - I love the sweet and salty taste they have! I never measure, I lightly coated with olive oil, then drizzled some maple syrup, and tossed all together to evenly coat. I liked these :)

This recipe was easy to make and tasted great.  I used real maple syrup.  I ate it as a snack at work.  It does still have the Kale taste though.  If you are looking to mask the taste of Kale, this will not do it.  I love kale myself, so this recipe is a great one for a change.

I finally had a chance to use my Wisconsin maple syrup and I'm glad I used it on these chips. Even the 9-year-old was chowing down on them before we even reached the table.

I used baby kale leaves--no need to cut or trim! Nice flavors but gave a 4 because I found it to be too salty and some of the chips became chewy-tacky in spots because of the syrup. Will use less salt and syrup next time, will def make again!
