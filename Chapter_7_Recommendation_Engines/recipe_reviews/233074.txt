With a recipe like this there is absolutely no reason to buy a box mix ever again.  I am one of those oddballs that doesn't like syrup on my pancakes so the sugar in this recipe added just the right amount of sweetness. Don't overmix the batter.  After flipping they really rise nice and tall so flip them gently and don't smash them down with the back of the spatula.

The first time I made this recipe, the batter was way too wet and the pancakes were too sweet. Second time I made it, I cut the milk by a scant quarter cup and I cut the sugar back by half. Good pancake recipe but not our family's favorite.

I have to wonder when I read some of these reviews... I saw one that claimed the pancakes tasted funny because of the vinegar...what vinegar? There isn't any in the recipe. Another blamed the recipe for being too watery whereas another person who had that issue knew it was because of the altitude and adjusted. Don't you think you should be aware of the effects of altitude before you cook? Alternatively, runny pancake batter is necessary if you want pancakes with a larger diameter. 

Personally I thought these were great and I wish I could have made them as written as I think they would have been just as good that way if not better.

I added blueberries because my son insisted. I also realized too late that I was out if canola oil (which is my oil of choice for pancakes) so I used raspberry infused olive oil in the batter and cooked the pancakes in butter. I figured cooking them in the fruity olive oil might be too much.

I will definitely save this recipe and next time I make it, I'll only add the blueberries to my son's pancakes and make sure the recipe holds up!

First off, I hate pancakes! I only make them because my kids love them. I think they're syrup sponges that are a crime to the culinary world. My hubby made this recipe a couple weeks back and I gasped in shock. Dense, soft, most sponge like a cake and just enough sweetness. I've been craving them since. The ONLY pancakes I will ever make in this house again. You won't regret it!

These are great!  I followed the recipe exactly w/the exception of adding some vanilla.  If you try this recipe, make it as written before making judgement or changing for what you think is wrong or how pancake batter should be.  The batter IS thin, but the pancakes do puff up (although, not sky high) so don't add flour until you have tried as written. They also will bubble up (one reviewer said they did not).   Some reviews talked about "soda" - HUH?? - where does it say "soda" which would completely ruin this pancake.  It uses "baking powder" NOT baking soda!!  They are sweeter than most pancakes so I don't understand how anyone can say they are "bland"???  Usually when I make pancakes, I just Pam my griddle once, but these seemed to need another spray or oiling - probably because there is so little oil in the batter.  It was obvious a reviewer or more, reviewed on reading, not cooking and that is SO wrong and arrogant!  I once had a friend say that when she tried a new recipe, she followed it exactly, but after that it belonged to her to change as she desired.  Reviewers here should adopt that philosophy as reviewing after making changes is unfair.  (There, got that off my chest! :)

Grandpa and his family must have had a sweet tooth! At 4 times the amount of sugar as my usual pancake recipe, these pancakes were way too sweet for my taste.  I loved that this recipe cut the salt some and had minimal oil included.  The texture was what you'd expect from a pancake.  My kids thought they were terrific, saving it from a three stars from me.  If you don't like syrup, like "Baking Nana" said in her review, these pancakes could possibly be your flap jack of choice.

The ratio of liquid to flour is way off.  The batter is far too watery.  1 and half cups flour to 3/4 cup milk is more like it.

I have made this recipe for years now since finding it. My boys all love the heck outta these pancakes. The recipe is perfect as it in our opinion and is great without syrup. I now use buttermilk versus milk and add a teaspoon of vanilla and also let the batter rest for a while before cooking. Perfection!

I added a little less milk, just added it into the dry ingredients until it came together. I love them, the dogs love them (They only get a bite) and my Nephew loves them too! That kid is as picky as they come, so that says allot for the recipe. Super fluffy, but also thick. For me this was a pure 5 star recipe, and I have made my share of pancakes from recipes off of this site. These turned out the best, thanks for sharing this family recipe. 

It was allot of sugar, though it was also allot of Baking powder, so it all evened out. Just like any recipe for any dough, add the main liquid as you go (In this case milk), never add all it calls for all at once. That's the best advice I can give.

I gave it 4 stars (vs. 5) because I changed the recipe a bit, based on others' reviews.  I used 2 tbls of sugar plus one packet of Truvia.  I added one tsp of vanilla extract and OF COURSE added chocolate chips :)  These pancakes were light and good, nice and puffy. My milk and egg were not room temp either but all turned out good.  I am sure I will use this recipe again.

Wow! These are great. I make pancakes every week and have tried many recipes on this site. This is one of the best yet! Because people complained of the pancakes being too liquidy, I used a bit less milk. This recipe yields very little; I got only 7 smallish pancakes from a single recipe - which is a lot less than 4 servings in this house particularly with pancaked so delicious.

Sad to admit that at 49 years old, this is the first time I've made pancakes from scratch.  I had no mix!  :-)  My son had a sleepover and they wanted pancakes for breakfast so I found this recipe.  WINNER!!!  Very easy to follow, and make.  They turned out wonderful and the kids loved them!  This recipe was voted as a keeper for the next sleepover!!  THANK YOU!!!  Awesome simple tasty recipe!

This recipe was really good and easy to make! I scaled it down to 4 servings, since it's just me. It had the right amount of sugar for my taste buds to where I didn't need a lot of syrup, and I love syrup. However, I did add a some vanilla extract as I normally would and my milk/eggs weren't room temp. I do think I may have over-mixed the batter, so they were a little flat. Overall I really liked the recipe and will be making again. No more box mixes!

The ratios of everything are perfect if you make in multiples of 4 servings because it takes one egg for four servings. 4 servings is (12) 5 inch diameter pancakes. This batter makes wonderfully delicious pancakes and there's nothing to it but to do it! Freeze leftover pancakes in a freezer bag by stacking with a square of waxed paper between each pancake.

These are delicious as is!! They are on the sweeter side but my family had them with bacon on the side so they balanced each other out. Definately reccomend! These would be good pancakes to put fruit in.

I love this recipe it's just a basic pancake recipe, but it is sooo good. I did change it up a bit I added A LITTLE bit of sour cream and lots of vanilla. The flavor was a little weird but that's because of I added too much sour cream, I would have used yogurt instead but we didn't have any.  (sour cream or yogurt lightens pancakes up, makes them more fluffy) But over all it was AMAZING

This was the worst pancake recipe I've ever tried. The batter was way too liquidy. And it was extremely hard to flip the pancake due to the fact that it didn't hold on itself.

Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! Great recipe; the family loved them! Only tip is to not add the milk all at once. Made a double batch and only added a cup of milk. I also cut the sugar by half and added a tablespoon of vanilla (my usual addition to pancake recipes). Overall great recipe!

These were good, but not the best I've had.  I would definitely make them again though, I think I'd just add more sugar and add a splash of vanilla extract like another reviewer mentioned.  As for the consistency of the batter - it was perfect.  And the extra tips on when to know if the griddle is hot enough were very helpful as my husband is normally the one cooking the pancakes but it was Father's Day so we were making him breakfast in bed.  :)

I made these exactly as written except I used splenda instead of sugar. I really like these although for my purposes I may use half as much 'sugar' as the recipe calls for, in the future. As is, they are great and need no syrup to be enjoyed.

These are the best pancakes. They are now my family's go to recipe for our weekend pancake breakfasts. So good, even my mom asked for the recipe! Only thing I do differently is using melted butter in the pan instead of oil. Also super tasty with blueberries added!

This is by far the simplest and tastiest pancake I've made! It's also very versatile. I cut back on the sugar because I load it with fruit compote and syrup (1/8 c instead of 1/4), but as it's written, it's a perfect sweetness if that's what you like. As other reviewers suggest, you can add vanilla. I sometimes add cinnamon.

The mix is very wet when you first combine the ingredients but if you let it sit it will puff up/thicken (5 minutes).  This is a very light pancake - not what you'd expect to be served when at a late night diner. If you load up the pan with oil (say 1/8 c), the edges get nice and crispy!

Love these pancakes! I don't make them often, but they're so simple I don't need to worry if I have everything to make them. And I like sweets, so the amount of sugar is great for me, I even add a dash of vanilla extract. Cooking them on an electric flat range cooktop was a bit problematic at a medium high heat, but I figure that's the least of my worries. They're so yummy and fluffy and delicious, with or without syrup. I'll hang on to this recipe for a while.

Tried this recipe this morning. It was really to sweet for my kids. Next time I'll use half the sugar. Other then that, they were great. They turned out fluffy and light. I put butter in my skillet instead of oil to give the pancakes an extra crunchy edge. I think I found my new pancake recipe.

These were really good. I added a little vanilla and almond extract, and a tiny bit of cinnamon. For whatever reason I had to lower my heat quite a bit so they wouldn't burn, compared to where I cook my other pancakes.

It turned out runny so had to change it. Measured everything, but in the higher elevation I live in it had to be changed. After I altered it, it was great. So I had to make my own up, but with the adjusted recipe my husband was so happy. Now I no longer have to buy his favorite pancake mix. Thank you for the great basis to many happy pancake meals. A'ho

Wonderful consistency! I was nervous about the amount of sugar...but it didn't really matter. On my gas stove, cooking on low heat with a good amount of veg. oil was key.

I love these pancakes!  So easy to make. All ingredients are common pantry ingredients.  I don't have a griddle so I cook them on medium heat. And sometimes I use coconut oil.  They turn out fluffy.  The pancakes are sweet but not overly so.  Perfect!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I used to make scratch pancakes all the time but somehow got away from it, replacing with a mix.  This morning we wanted pancakes but I'd run out of mix and couldn't find my pancake recipe, so I came to Allrecipes for a substitute.  These are great, a little too sweet for me, but I think one has to remember that this is "Grandad's" recipe, from back when they used more sugar and salt in recipes. I'll make them again but reduce the sugar in half and add a smidge of vanilla. I don't need to look any further to replace my old recipe! :o)

I’m a cook for the Chicago Fire Department. I made these for one morning at work. They were  good and fluffy and everyone loved them. I quadrupled the recipe and used Buttermilk in place of milk. I also added a little vanilla and doubled the oil in the batter. So there is no reason to put oil on a nonstick pan. Next time I would cut the salt in half. ?Very Good Recipe.

These cook up incredibly light, and the flavor is quite neutral, so they would accept flavored syrups, compound butters, or even some kind of fruit topping.

Word to the wise: use a quarter cup measure for adult pancakes (about 4" cooked) or eighth cup for kids (just under 3" cooked).

I went to make pancakes and found I didn't have any pancake mix - nuts! Well I got brave and went to "All Recipes".   I made this recipe exactly as written and they were extremely easy and wonderful!  I will never buy pancake mix again which is most probably filled with preservatives and heaven knows what else.

Wayyyy too sweet and not fluffy (though to be fair they weren’t advertised as such) I should’ve known something was wrong when I added 1/4 cup of sugar but I went with it. If you make this definitely cut the sugar. Grandad probably put all that sugar to cover the taste of 1tbs of baking powder (which I’m sure isn’t necessary btw) I’m pregnant and the smell of these just cooking was off-putting :( I really wanted to like these but I think you’d have to make too many alterations to make this work. My suggestion: Just find another recipe.

Best pancake recipe yet! Thick yet light and fluffy. Very filling and very tasty with or without syrup. I used vanilla almond mylk which I’m sure contributed to the sweetness but it was still so delicious. This recipe made 4 large and 4 small pancakes. Usually that’s not enough but these are very filling without feeling heavy. I’m a horrible cook too so my kids we’re reluctant to try but they are so happy I cooked today. Thanks grandad pancakes for making my cooking skills look like a pro

I have no idea how this recipe has so many 5 stars.   the batter is so watery that when I put it on my griddle is just spread out to a thin layer. the pancakes hardly rise, if at all.  do not make this recipe.  it's not good

A delicious product from an easy recipe.  An added benefit of this recipe is it’s versatility.  Make the batter a bit thinner and it works great for crêpes.  Add cinnamon and/or nutmeg and wonderful for Christmas morning breakfast.

I made this exactly to the recipe. Thumbs down. Tasted too much like flour. Also burn easy. Not sure why so many people like it. Much easier and better tasting to just use bisquik. Disappointed.

I thought this recipe came out great! I didn’t find them to be too sweet or batter too thin at all. The only thing I did differently was add a touch of vanilla extract. It was an easy no fuss recipe (which is why I chose it). I liked using just one bowl, no melting of butter, etc. As easy to bring together as a mix but much tastier.

I have tried many recipes for pancakes. I had been fascinated by the recipes with buttermilk but this one is just right. I only added a bit more salt, a splash more milk for the right consistency, and vanilla for our tastes. They have just the right fluffyness without being too thick. Perfect.

Awesome recipe!! I have been looking for a recipe from scratch for my grand baby and I. We both love pancakes!!! I doubled everything except sugar and oil. I am diabetic and don’t need to much sugar but wanted extra pancakes. We definitely will be making more. My daughter even loves them after trying!

Easy great recipe! I make double batches and add a tablespoon of vinegar to the milk to make the pancakes a little fluffier. Cinnamon and Nutmeg are nice additions, too.

I would add 1/4 cup flour or omit 1/4 cup milk, this may only be for high altitudes. These were pretty good but the batter was too runny and more suited for crepes than pancakes. They are quite sweet also so they barely needed syrup. I added a dash of vanilla and cinnamon too. I would say this recipe serves about 2 large portions.

My family loved this recipe. Better than the average boxed mix at the store. Next time I will try cutting some sugar, and adding vanilla extract. Great pancake overall.

I used half the sugar and they came out about the sweetness of a plain waffle, sweet enough to be eaten with or without syrup. I used 1/4 cup of batter per pancake and made 8 delicious pancakes. :) Definitely would recommend.

Best homemade pancakes I've ever made or tasted.  If you ever want to know if a dish is tasty, try your dish with children who are honest. I made these pancakes for eight-year-old twins and they said they were the best pancakes they've ever had.

I made this as written. The pancakes were delicious. I’m weird and only put butter on my pancakes. The sweetness of the pancake was just right. All my life I’ve only used box mixes and have to throw out half full boxes because they expire before I can use it all.  Never again! Thanks to your grandpa for sharing his recipe and thank YOU for sharing the recipe with all of us.

I love this recipe and make it regularly. I add a teaspoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of powdered cardamom for extra flavor. Today my seven year old who loves lemons asked me to include lemon juice. I added the juice of a small lemon to the milk and I think the pancakes were even fluffier. 
Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

Went perfect.
Not sure why so many people said it was watery/liquidy. If measured out correctly it's nice and thick. 
Very sweet to what I'm used to but nonetheless very nice. we had them topped with strawberry sauce. Children chocolate sauce

Definitely the best pancake recipe I've tried so far. After 30 years of Bisquick, though, they're not the same. Not quite as fluffy, & you can really taste the sugar. I'll definitely make these again, but cut the sugar & maybe add more baking powder (though you'd think a whole tablespoon would've been enough...) Oh, & I decreased the milk by 1/4 cup as other reviewers suggested.

These were amazing my kids loved them! No syrup needed at all since they were sweet. I followed the directions and all I adjusted was a dash of vanilla extract.

Excellent recipe! I love the thinner batter and the sweetness. Light texture but a thinner pancake, which is just what I was looking for. The second time I made them I added a bit if vanilla, they are good both ways. I started mixing these up in a single jar - just give the wet ingredients a good shake before putting the mixed dry in, then shake again. They were very easy to pour onto the griddle!

I will definitely be keeping this recipe. Made it and enjoyed every bite. 
I made no changes except very minor which was
Using butter on the pan instead of oil. 
Thanks for sharing finally I've found a pancake recipe I will always go back to.

These are delicious.  I added cinnamon and vanilla and used gluten free flour. Batter is very runny, but no need to add more flour. They are on the thin. Would 100% make them again. You can eat a few and not feel overly stuffed as you would 1 regularly thicker pancake.  Would have taken a picture of them, but I already ate them ??

I added half a cup of flour and omit the oil in the batter. Extra flour makes them more fluffy and the oil isn’t needed. If I’m using salted butter in my pan, then I’ll also omit the salt. This is our go to recipe for pancakes!!

Also, a bit of unsolicited advice to anyone complaining about this recipe: Please stop blaming others for your shortcomings in the kitchen.

First time making pancakes from scratch.  I got a thumbs up from all 5 kids.  They absolutely loved them.  I did add 1 tablespoon of cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the 8 serving batch.  3 of the 5 didn’t even out syrup on theirs, they said it wasn’t needed, pancakes were delicious as is??

Excellent recipe. Really quick to do. I like that these pancakes were so puffy, we combined them with different fruits in the batter too. I reduced the sugar to 1/8 cup.

I made these for my family for breakfast. I did read the other reviews, but I added a dash of vanilla and nutmeg to mine, but otherwise made them as the recipe called. The batter does mix up very watery, but the pancakes are nice and fluffy. They are a tad sweet and remind me of the pancakes that are used in Japanese confections like dorayaki. My husband loved these pancakes and asked me to make them again. We smattered a little honey on them and rolled them up and ate them by hand.

Thank you for sharing this recipe! I usually make terrible pancakes where it would always fall apart when I flipped it over or they would just be undercooked. These are very easy to make! I make them with my 3 year old daughter, she adds and mixes everything and I cook it. 
I add the leftovers in the freezer. I added an extra Tbsp of oil because my daughter is underweight. 
I am going to make this recipe on our family and friends vacations!

Everyone loves when I make these- and it’s always impressive when you say you make them from scratch!  I add mini chocolate chips once i pour them into the pan so they are spread evenly throughout, never into the batter mixture for my niece and that is the only thing she asks me to make since no one else can make them like I do! ?? thank you for sharing!

Used nutmeg. Added lemon juice to milk. Waited 10 minutes to use after mixing. Great fluffy recipe! Made them twice in 1 week.

This recipe is awesome.  These are a little more dense than other pancakes, but I love that because it doesn’t become mushy from the syrup.  I will not go back to any other recipe.  It’s just about the best I’ve ever had.

By far the best homemade pancakes - so easy & quick to make. I make it dairy free with almond milk - I do half the milk called for with vanilla almond milk & half with plain. I then leave out the vanilla flavoring. Easy to double.

These pancakes are seriously the best I’ve ever had! When I read the recipe 1/4 c of sugar just seemed like so much, but I did follow the recipe exactly. The batter is runny, but just trust the recipe. The pancakes come out very fluffy, sweet (but not too sweet) and just taste amazing.

I added 1/4 cup of sugar and a tsp of vanilla flavoring. The kids and hubby loved them. I made a double batch and they were all gone! I added my pic. I normally do buttermilk but these turned out fine as a substitute.

I absolutely hate pancakes but I made these for my grandkids and they smelled heavenly, so I tasted them and oh my goodness they are amazing! I’ve made pancakes a lot for my family and never tasted like these! Yum! I made my own pancake syrup as well, it was called butter syrup

I really enjoyed this recipe. The pancakes were soft and just melted as I ate them. I used almond milk and an egg at refrigerator temperature and they still turned out great. I’m not sure what the room temperature milk and egg would do to change it but they turned out delicious nonetheless.

These are the perfect pancakes! They are lightly sweet, so they can be eaten with, or without, syrup (a little syrup goes a long way!). I set my griddle to 300 degrees, and cooked them on each side for 2 minutes. I made 2 batches, and the second batch I overmixed, and they were a little runny, but still tasted the same! The first batch was light and fluffy! So good!

By far our favorite pancake recipe! I just mixed up the dry ingredients and put them in a ziplock bag so I can make them quicker! I only did one bag and I’m thinking I may do up a bunch of them to keep on hand! I put the mix in a squeeze bottle and made them mini for my two year old and he loved it!

I prefer my pancakes fluffy and love the fluffy pancake recipe on here. But, since I didn’t have all the ingredients I needed to make those, I decided to try this recipe instead. They came out really thin and I made sure not to over mix the batter. The taste was pretty good though!

These were great, my son said they were just as good as our favorite breakfast place.  For the people that say the batter is too thin, let it rest for a few minutes after you mix everything it will thicken on its own.  I would cut down on the sugar if making these for myself, but I love that I can make these from scratch with real ingredients, no premise mixes.  My stovetop must run hotter yes most, I needed to bring it down to medium low to prevent burning but overall great pancakes.  Thanks!

I have made these 3 times and I will never use another pancake recipe! So much better than boxed, and so easy! They are sweet, and we always double the recipe to store leftovers for later. My son got creative and added melted chocolate chips and regular chocolate for sugar overload! I prefer them plain..no need for syrup! Next time, I will add vanilla. I forgot this time!  Thank you for the recipe!

Really good. I was pleasantly surprised when I whipped this up. I put the milk in the microwave for 15 Sec to bring to room temp. The egg was already there. But perfect amount of sweet and fluffy. Cooked up a nice color on both sides. Really a great recipe! Thank you for sharing this gem!!!

This is now my favorite pancake recipe with the addition of a little vanilla. If you are a sweet cornbread southerner you will love these. If that's not your thing, then you might want to back off of the sugar a bit, but at least try it as written first. You might be surprised.

I make this several times a month, my new go-to pancake recipe! Only substitute I make is I used melted butter instead of the oil.

Easy and really good. Added 1/4 cup of flour for thicker batter, 3/4 cup milk, and reduced the sugar by half.

Really loved this recipe.
I have tried for years to get a recipe similar to how my gran would make pancakes. This is it!
They are very sweet for my taste, so usually I add half sugar.
However for my friends and family I leave them as is, they love them.
We usually have them with no toppings or with a little lemon juice and sugar.

Absolutely 100% loved these! Followed directions as specified and they came out light and thin (how I like them!) and tasted awesome!  We ate one without syrup, just to see how it would taste and even then Yum! I agree with Baking Nana, this is our #1 go to recipe for now on, forget the box version!!! My husband couldn't get enough! I can see why the original owner didn't want to part with it! Still, Thanks for posting.

These pancakes are delicious. I love that the batter is a little on the thin side. I used cold milk and egg. Not sure why they are supposed to be warm temperature. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I've never made pancakes from scratch before so I chose this recipe based on the fact that I happened to have all the ingredients on hand. I was amazed to find that it made the absolute best pancakes I've ever had! I did add just a little vanilla to it but these pancakes you don't even really need the syrup...they are just that awesome!

With the high sugar content, these pancakes burn a lot quicker, so be careful. I use a griddle and am used to making pancakes at 375, these do much better at 325!

These pancakes were so very easy to make and soooo delicious. My daughter and I loved them and so this recipe is definitely a keeper. The measurements were great because it wasn’t too sweet as I’m not a sweets person so I loved them. Can not wait to make it for my husband.

I’ve made this recipe several times, and it produces the best pancakes I’ve ever had in my life! As other reviewers have said, the sugar in the pancake batter adds enough sweetness so that syrup is not necessary. They taste fabulous right off the grill, with nothing further added.  Thanks for this recipe!!

So fluffy and works well with coconut milk or rice milk, too. Delicious! Can prepare the batter night before; just stir again before pouring onto hot griddle.

Good pancakes.  I'm puzzled by all the comments about these being too thin.  I tripled the recipe (grandkids in the house!), so headed advice and started with 2 cups of milk instead of the 3 it should have been.  Way too thick, so added 1/2 c more.  Still too thick, and ended up adding the full amount of 3 cups, and it was perfect.  One suggestion ... always stir your flour to aerate it well before measuring - flour tends to pack down as it sits.  The advice of not adding all the liquid initially is good, but be careful you don't overmix as you add more liquid ... overmixing will lead to tough pancakes.  Let your batter sit for 5 minutes or so before cooking, as others have mentioned ... this lets the flour absorb more of the liquid.  One thing I did change was to cut the sugar back by about a third ... when you know you're covering them with maple syrup, all that sugar in the pancakes themselves isn't necessary!

I've been using this recipe for years. It made me hate box pancake mixes. I mix almond extract into the milk and don't level the sugar because we like it sweet. We never need to use syrup. It's perfect

You can replace white sugar for coconut sugar and it give a little taste. But this is still the best pancakes recipe. Thanks a lot. Great pancakes.

I wanted pancakes for my birthday.  So I made this.  It was the best home made pancakes ever.  I added a half cup of wild blueberries.  Yet I do agree of cutting the sugar in half as they were very sweet.  I will definitely be make these again for my next birthday!

Came out perfect! Don't over mix and let batter sit for at least 10 minutes before putting in heated pan. I usually put grape jelly on mine but with these I'm going to make a low sugar substitute maybe a grape or blackberry jam... yum !

The lost star was only due to the excess sugar. Once I decreased the sugar the recipe has become the go to favourite in my family!  I always add a tsp Vanilla to my pancake or crepe recipes or more to taste..

I made these pancakes a few times but they always seemed a little flat to me. In spite of this, everyone in the family loved them so kept the recipe as my go-to.  Wanting to make them more to my own liking I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut back on the milk - A LOT!!  I eyeballed it, but estimate that I used 1 and 1/3 of a cup for a doubled recipe which resulted in fluffier, just as delicious pancakes.  Cheers for submitting!!

The batter started alarmingly thin but made very light and fluffy pancakes. Just as easy as boxed mix. Will definitely make these again.

I have never made pancakes before without using store bought mix... but with this recipe those days are behind me. These pancakes are light, fluffy, and so simple even a novice can knock out a stack of beautiful pancakes in ten minutes. I did use about a half cup rather than one cup of milk, and the consistency was just right. Now I can't wait for pancake day to roll round!

Made gluten free! Used Robin Hood all purpose gluten free flour, and added an extra egg. They were delicious! Especially to a person who hasn't been able to have pancakes in ages!

Husband said very good so I give this five stars.  Next time I'll let the mixed batter sit for about 15 minutes.  The last pancakes poured onto griddle were fluffier for the best texture.  :-) edit to add: Complaints about runny pancakes= your baking powder is old.  1/4 cup sugar doesn't make these too sweet. You must be miss-reading the recipe.  Double check your ingredients and measure carefully because these are perfect.

By far the best pancake recipe I've found so far. I can whip up a batch of these pancakes and my boys (2yo/4yo) will eat them ALL day. No syrup, no butter. Just munch on them for snacks. The only change that I make is to substitute 2 tablespoons of whey or soy protein   in the flour. My husband likes to have a little extra protein in his meals.

This is my favorite, simple pancake recipe. My kids love it! No changes necessary! Occasionally I add choc chips on top of the pancakes while they are cooking. I don't add it to the mix prior to pouring out bc they sink to the bottom!! Another option is to add a little bit of cinnamon to the mix, about 1 tsp.

This is my "go to" pancake recipe. A friend even converted to this recipe after trying it. I did feel that it was "missing something" when I made it the first time & based on other reviews, I added Vanilla Extract. I have since tried other extracts & my family likes these best with about a tsp+ of Almond Extract & about a tsp+ of Cinnamon. I usually have to triple this recipe, if I want to have any left over, or even just want some for myself after cooking. My family LOVES this recipe. We don't usually use any syrup or add any toppings. These are tasty as is. As far as the batter being too watery goes, I have found that the humidity in the air effects mine. I personally add the milk last & sometimes have to adjust the amount a little. I also use this recipe, with my additions, as a base recipe for making donut holes or funnel cakes. My family gets excited when I say that I'm making those. I pretty much double the flour to make the batter thicker & make a few minor adjustments. Sometimes I need a little more, sometimes a little less. I usually "eyeball" the amounts that I use. But, I agree with other reviewers that you should always make a recipe as it is written the first time you make it. Otherwise, you are not reviewing the written recipe & you are just reviewing yourself. Making changes due to dietery restrictions is one thing, & that should be noted when reviewing. But, making changes just to change it is another. If you like a sweet pancake, this is the one.

I found this recipe a couple years ago and I LOVE them!! I don't add or take away anything from it. I notice better results when I do use room temperature eggs and milk though. Sometimes I'll let the batter sit for about 15-20 mins so it's at room temperature. Sooo good!! My daughter loves eating them! Definitely a requested meal! Thanks for sharing!!

This was my first ever pancake recipe when I started cooking for my fiancé 4 years ago ( I have always refused to use store-bought pancake mix!). Still one of the best ones out there! I have since found another recipe with way less sugar, but whenever I don't have any buttermilk around the house, I go back to this recipe! Grandpa's pancakes are one of the best around!

I tried this recipe immediately upon reading it, and feel that it is a terrific pancake, and this from a guy who generally prefers waffles or French Toast. I made an adjustment which I think makes them even better, if that's possible. I added 1/4 tsp. of Almond Extract, and that does a lot for the WOW factor.

I usually add a splash of vanilla extract, some cinnamon and some nutmeg. I've also added fruits such as berries or bananas.

Wow, these are perfect!  Followed the recipe and they were NOT runny or thin at all (a few reviewers stated they were)  I will never use another recipe or buy a pancake mix again.  Thank you for sharing your family recipe.  It is highly appreciated!

One morning my son wanted his favorite meal: pancakes. Well being that it was super early on a Saturday morning and I didn't feel like going to McDonalds, I decided to make them at home. I was accustomed to using box mix like bisquick or aunt jemima. Unfortunately I didn't have any mix so what was I to do?? I just on here and found out how to make pancakes from scratch! This recipe was pretty easy and they turned out great; definitely better than the boxed stuff! Needless to say I'll be able to save money by not going to McDonald's for pancakes!

These pancakes are delicious! I had zero problems making them and they came out great. As for the reviews about the batter being too thin, I recommend packing the flour down in the measuring cup till it's full. The batter wasn't too thin at all.

I automatically double pancake recipes, in the off chance they aren't all eaten they are easy to freeze and reheat. I did cut the sugar in half, if you're putting syrup on them I figure we didn't need the extra sugar. The 1:1 ratio of flour to milk is what I automatically use in whatever pancake recipe I'm following, I like a thinner batter. I think I'll use this one again, maybe try adding pumpkin or other things like I have with other recipes.

Excellent recipe! The first pancake was thick, but that was my fault since I didn't think about smoothing the batter out on the grill. Things like that occasionally happen to me, as I approach the mid-70's in life!  They were delicious and best I've ever made.

Yuck!  I made these as written and they were almost inedible!  The batter becomes so thick you can hardly pour it into the griddle!  I will never make this again. I think a box mix would've been better.  I will stick to making buttermilk pancakes...

I would give this 5 stars for fluffiness but 4 stars because the batter was crazy thick which made cooking the pancakes through without them getting too brown was tricky.  I omitted the sugar altogether and they tasted great.  Think I'm going to stick with "Fluffy Pancakes" as my go-to pancake recipe.

These are my kind of pancakes!  Thin, soft, dense, not crusty.  I read from many reviews that they were too sweet, my tastebuds disagree.  I think everything in these pancakes is perfectly balanced.  I don't care for making pancakes, mainly because I cannot find a good recipe-and I have tried many!  This might be it.  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change anything. Cheers, enjoy!

Really great recipe.  Only alteration I made was instead of 1/4 cup sugar, I used 1/4 cup of Splenda.  My kid eats enough sugar as it is, so wanted to limit it, but not change the taste of the recipe.  I served it obviously with maple syrup, and added some fresh strawberries, kiwi and blackberries to the side of my own plate.  Together it tasted like a yummy dessert.

OMG. Why have I not found this recipe before? Grandad would have given Aunt Jemima a run for her money. Super easy to make. I'm sure you can customize them with your own little tweaks like your favorite extract flavors. So light and fluffy. These will be a staple for us along with cornmeal pancakes.

This recipe is a keeper. As recommended by other reviewers, I decreased the milk to 3/4 cup. I addd cinnamon and vanilla per my family's preference. These pancakes were great with a fruit topping. I topped the pancakes with fresh strawberries. Yummy!

These pancakes are the bomb digity! I've made them time and time again trying different flavor combinations....they are sweet enough to where I don't usually need syrup.....mmmm got some cooking now.....side note making the "well" makes a huge difference in the outcome of your pancakes.

Very good. It was very sticky when I was mixing the ingredients together, so I added about a cup of water and it was better. Perfect for pancake art.

Simple, fluffy and tasty! My 8-year-old wants to learn how to cook. This recipe was perfect for her. She made them herself, with very little help. She was thrilled! They tasted so good that she at them plain -- with no butter or syrup. Next time, I'll have her add 1/8 tsp. of vanilla (my personal preference). Yes, they are sweeter than the average pancake, but not by much. We will definitely let her make these again!

Pancakes are not my favorite but my husband loves them, so I decided to give a new recipe a try. Wow!  I used buttermilk instead of regular and these were so good no syrup was needed. Thank you, this is exactly what I was searching for.

These are very fluffy pancakes with a nice consistency. I added a little vanilla and some blueberries, but they would be wonderful without any changes. My new go-to recipe for pancakes.

Granddad's pancakes are light fluffy and delicious . I added a little less sugar and about a half a teaspoon of the  vanilla.  It's nice to think  that this Grand dad lives on through his  delicious pancakes.  Thanks for sharing.

I used this recipe because I was running low on butter and this recipe uses oil (I did use butter to cook vs. oil). Very good overall, just too sweet for my taste. I would make again with much less than the 1/4 cup of sugar that the recipe calls for.

This didn't turn out at all for me. maybe it was me, but the ratio of flour to liquid didn't work, hey werewere very flat pancakes, no puffiness and it was very hard to keep them from burning, because they would go from not cooked at all and can't flip them, to over cooked. Sorry

I made this pancakes with the hubby's help. He's even impressed how simple and straightforward this was. I used Bob Red Mill Gluten Free 1to1 Baking flour. I added a splash of almond extract for that kick. Because it was sweet there was no need to use syrup or anything else. Next time I'll play with the sweetness and even add chocolate chip.

Perfect! A lot of people say its to watery but the secret is making sure your griddle is already good and hot. I followed this recipe and it made beautiful large fluffy delicious pancakes. Thank you! I'll never buy the bagged store stuff again.

like others, I found this batter far too watery and far too sweet-cut back the milk by a quarter cup, and only use a tablespoon of sugar instead of a quarter cup

I reduced the sugar by half and it still turned out great. One draw back is with pancakes you need to have the heat really low on the griddle or you enter up with them slightly burnt by the time the batter is all fully cooked.  Another thing that this recipe does great is waffles and it was not even necessary to fold in the beat egg whites to get them light and fluffy

The best pancakes ever!! The batter is runny, but it makes perfect diner style pancakes. I added some vanilla and cinnamon.

They came out really nicely.  We added a few things to suit our personal preferences: cinnamon, blueberries, and when the blueberries ran out we put in chocolate chips. :)

It was so good! It was my first time doing pancakes and it was amazing! But I think it needs a teaspoon of vanilla extract and to cut down the baking powder from 1 table spoon to 1/2

These pancakes always come out great!! They are easy to make and I always have everything in my kitchen to make them! I especially love them so much because they don't need vinegar which most pancake recipes require!

This is a super recipe for pancakes! It has become my go to for Saturday mornings and when we have brinner or breakfast for dinner.  For a while I had tons of buttermilk on hand and used it, at room temperature,  instead of regular milk, and the pancakes were even better!

I completely cut the sugar and left everything else the same and the pancakes were great. (No offense to the family recipe.) I love that they are fluffy but I don't have to have buttermilk or wait 5 minutes to sour some milk. I used whole wheat flour. My kids love them too.

I've made this recipe several times now and it's a hit with my family. Definitely sweet, but we like that. My father in law ate the batter in a cup! I've made it with regular and almond milk and both gave yummy fluffy pancakes. I do add vanilla because I put it in mort things I bake. The batter is thin but it puffs up well.

We liked these pancakes very much.   Easy to make with good flavor.  I read some of the other reviews and I think (for our tastes) they were NOT too sweet.   However, they were too runny for us.  So I added another 1/4 cup of flour and the consistency was about right.   I also added a teaspoon of vanilla because my pancakes HAVE to have vanilla in them!  :-)   We like to add things to our pancakes:  either blueberries, mini-chocolate chips, apples, or the combination of bananas and chopped walnuts.  I added the banana/walnut combo to these and they were excellent.   But even if you like them plain, these pancakes have a lot of flavor.   Thanks for sharing the recipe with us.

My family loves this recipe! I double it since I have teenage boys and I are a teaspoon of vanilla per recipe. I use 2 cast iron skillets and put blueberries on the ones in one own and chocolate child in the other.?? I plan on trying this with diced apples, cinnamon, and pecans!

This is my go to pancake recipe when I’m out of buttermilk as they turn out just as fluffy with no need for fussy egg separating and egg white beating! I often use half whole wheat or spelt flour and they turn out just as fluffy and delicious. Similar to other reviewers, our family finds the sweetness to be enough if we don’t want to use syrup or want to use less!

Great recipe. I'm never buying a box mix again. Even my wife love them and she is not a big pancake fan. The only substitution I made is using sugar in the raw versus granulated sugar.

It was good and my son liked them, as well.  A good basic recipe that does not require running out and getting anything.  But, nothing really special, as is.  I think next time I might try adding some extras, like orange zest or vanilla.

Pretty darn good. Added vanilla and sometimes blueberries. I usually double the recipe. Depending on who I'm making them for, I add more milk to make thinner pancakes.

These are my grandkid's favorite Saturday or Sunday morning treat. As a matter of fact, we had them for dinner tonight too! Easy recipe, and nice and fluffy. Tonight I was out of white sugar, so I used light brown and some cinnamon in the batter. They were really good. I definitely recommend this recipe to anyone who loves pancakes.

I love the pancakes, however I did reduce the sugar by half, and I use soy or almond milk. I also add a few drops of lemon juice as I do to all my pancake batter. I added the milk a bit at a time so I did not use the whole cup, it would have been to watery. Other than that this is going to be my go to pancake mix.

Great recipe! Very easy to quickly whip up a batch of pancakes. I add 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1/2 cup frozen blueberries. The pancakes were delicious - very light and fluffy.

Love these pancakes! Followed the recipe exactly, its definitely a wetter batter but it is delicious! It made a few to many for just the two of us so I made all of it and froze the few we could not finish, I made them toaster size so we'll see if they reheat.

Throw out the boxed pancake mix. This is just as easy and better...and cheaper. A hint of sweetness and nice and fluffy. I prefer this over the boxed stuff and so do the kids.

I use this recipe every Sunday to make pancakes for my family.  My 4 year old loves the pancakes and that's something he looks forward to.  My husband thinks they're fluffy and yummy.  I add vanilla extract to give it some extra taste plus I add all kinds of fruits to jazz things up.  Simple recipe that produces great tasting food!

I make these pancakes every weekend with my 4 year old daughter. They are great but I only use 3/4  cups of milk because 1 cup makes the batter too watery.

It's a perfect recipe. I have made it many many times, don't change anything follow the recipe as is. It never goes wrong!
For anyone complaining about the batter being thin just let it stand for few mins and it will thicken.

Made these they were so lite and tasty, incredible. The only change made was we split the flour in half using 1/2 a cup of whole flor and 1/2 a cup of regular all purpose flour, and they can out just right light and fluffy. Will need to double the recipe next time. Thanks this is a keeper, bye bye Aunt Jemima.

THEY FLUFFED!!! Seriously, most recipes I try are in between pancakes and crêpes. Due to the sugar content they can caramelize easily, so on my uneven-heating griddle I got a little blackening, BUT it wasn't burned (taste tested). Best pancakes I think I've made, including mixes.

I loved this recipe! I tried it because I've been trying to get out of the habit of buying the pancake box mix and making them from scratch. I am so glad I did! This was so easy and simple. I love these pancakes because of how fast I can whip them up! Once you get them off the griddle add a little butter, drizzle some syrup on top, and enjoy!!!

Hands down my favorite pancake recipe.  I have a 95 year old grandmother that would not eat pancakes (because she did not make them and believes everyone else uses a boxed product). She watched me make these once, tried them and loved them enough that she has my mother make them for her.  I shared the recipe with my mom and now my kids request this every time they visit grandma.  Pretty cool to see grandma and great grandma eating these simple pancakes with the kids.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I made this recipe this morning and they were absolutely amazing! My husband said they were the best pancakes I've ever made ! They had a nice sweet flavor to them and dense but still fluffy ..I added vanilla extract and a 1/2 teaspoon of honey

We enjoyed these, but I did need to add more flour as the batter was a little too runny and just spread out too thin with my first pancake, making more of a crepe than a pancake. After adjusting the flour, these turned out great. I added some mini chocolate chips (for the kids pancakes). Yum!

These turned out amazing. I used wheat flour instead of bleached white flour and they were still delicious. My husband keeps thanking me for the tasty pancakes I made.  Thank you for the recipe!

My family loves these pancakes.  I substituted applesauce for the oil and added cinnamon to the batter.  I also cut down the milk to make it a thicker batter.

My family really enjoyed these pancakes, and I liked them as well.  However, I had a really tricky time getting these cooked right (I borderline burned the majority of them and that is not normally a problem for me).  Also, the extra planning required to have room temp milk & eggs means that I will keep looking for a favorite plain pancake recipe.  Side note - if you're looking for fun in your pancakes, my all-time favorite pancake recipe is Chunky Monkey Pancakes from this site.

I agree wet to dry is way off, knew this before pouring milk and knew baking powder was a bit much so I added 1/2 cup flour and went down to 3/4 milk. I also added blueberries per my sons request.

sooo good! made it exactly as stated except added vanilla. At first thought it was going to be to watery but it thicken up as I was making them. Upped the serving for 12 and it made 27 pancakes, if that helps anyone. Saved to receipe box. this will be my pancake receipe moving forward! Thank you to your Grandad and RIP

I was hopeful that these would be amazing fluffy pancakes. Sadly, it didn't work for me. Batter was very thin, and pancakes were only 1/4 inch thick. I followed the recipe exactly with fresh ingredients so I'm not sure what happened.

Best pancake recipe I've tried. It's several tiers above any box mix. I questioned the amount of  baking powder, but forged ahead anyhow, and I am so glad I didn't change a thing. I'm very sensitive to baking powder/ soda taste and it's not there at all. We did substitute butter for the oil, but regardless this is an amazing and easy recipe.

So, this is not my first time making it. I do not add as much sugar because I liked it less sweet, but everything else is the same. I love it and it is so yummy. I 'm a pancake fiend.

I made this as written and I was a little concerned as the batter was so thin. So, putting faith in Grandad I continued.  These were very very good. :D I may add less milk next time, as I like a fluffy pancake, however if the taste changes I will go back.

I work at a nursing home and we usually use the gold medal pancake mix in the 5 pound box.  We were short pancake mix one day and I pulled up a recipe to make them from scratch.  Luckily for us, this is the one I picked.  We have been making these pancakes for our residents ever since.

My kids loved it! Very easy to prepare! I however thought it was just okay. I ladled the batter with a 1/3 measuring cup for seven perfect 6-inch pancakes.  I added 1 tsp vanilla extract, as always with pancake batter.  I reduced the milk by maybe 1/8-1/4 cup.  The batter was loose, but not runny.  I used cane sugar and they were not overly sweet.  I also added cinnamon and pecans to half the batter to give it some extra flavor.  This is a good base, however it will not replace my current recipe.

I was looking for a quick & easy pancake recipe & found this one, which ended up being perfect in more ways than one. it made about 6 smallish  sized pancakes.. the perfect amount for my husband & I when paired with a couple of other breakfast sides. I wisked the egg 1st & set it off to the side so it wasn't as chilled from the fridge & then popped the cup of (almond) milk in the microwave for 30 sec or so on 1/2 power. then I combined the dry ingredients first (including a pinch of nutmeg & cinnamon) & then just threw the rest of the wet ingredients in & gently folded the batter together. once poured on the griddle I pressed some halved blackberries in each. (otherwise adding them directly into the batter would make it blue.. same with blueberries if they r really ripe.) they took me only 15 min total for prep & bake time & they turned out so fluffy & flavorful that they could almost be eaten without any butter, syrup, etc etc. I have to say though, I have made pancakes we've liked better in the past.. however, bc of how easy they were to make along with the convenience of usually always having the ingredients on-hand, I have a feeling this will become great go-to. thanks for sharing ??

I always triple the recipe for breakfast (there's 8 of us). I never have the milk or eggs at room temperature. This is usually made on a whim. The kids never have any complaints. I sort of like that they're not so fluffy because I always get the hiccups with fluffy pancakes. But for those of you who like thick fluffy pancakes, these would be a bit to liquidy for you. The flavor is good, and I don't find them too sweet, as other reviewers have mentioned. The great thing about this recipe, is that you can alter it to your liking.

These were good but maybe a little too sweet for me.  I didn't have a problem with the batter being too thin.

Surprisingly great recipe (I have an old buttermilk whole wheat pancake recipe that also rocked).  Next time I will reduce milk to maybe 7/8 cup or increase flour to 1 1/8 cup.  Thank you for the recipe!

These are wonderful! They rise beautifully. I use almond milk instead and add according to the texture I want. With all the milk called for, they were a bit runny for my taste but it's just personal preference. Yum!

I really loved these pancakes. So much so that I forgot to take a picture! They are a lot lighter than pancakes I'm used to and I actually really liked that. I will definitely be keeping this recipe around!

I only made a couple of changes: I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk and added an extra egg. I liked the pancakes but my star rating may not fair because of the changes I made.

You are better off with the box pancakes or a different recipe. I looked at the reviews for this recipe and some people are right. This batter is too wet and does not puff up enough. When I followed the recipe the pancakes were so wet they didn't even cook through. The inside of the pancake was soggy. When I added more flower to the recipe about a half cup, it was then decent but too sweet. Never using this recipe again

I was looking for a good recipe for pancakes and came across this one. Instead of cooking them in oil I cooked them in a bit of butter for even more flavor and it was so delish! no more out the box for me! have tried many others and none were this yummy! I usually add chocolate chips for my little one but besides that I don't change the recipe

Best, fluffiest, from-scratch pancakes we have ever eaten!  Thank you for sharing!  Made as is, but we love cinnamon so sprinkled some into the batter.  My kids love mini chocolate chips so half of them got a sprinkle of chips on top while on the griddle before flipping.  Outstanding!!

Too sweet. Recipe is very easy, but the sweetness was too much for my kiddos. They snacked on a dry one but didn't eat when buttered with a little bit of syrup.  I may try again with half or less of the sugar.

I've tried various pancake recipes from scratch and, by far, this one is the best. My children loved them. I took advice from another review and added 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.

Favorite pancakes ever! Taste, flavour & perfect puffiness! Whole fam loved them. Double the recipe - it doesn't seem to make as many as I thought it would.  May as well carve it into stone. I ain't changing anything!

Great recipe! I took the advice of others and added about 1 tsp of vanilla to the mix. I also reduced the sugar to 1/8c of sugar and increased the flour to 1 1/4c. We also sprinkle crumbled sausage into the poured pancakes in the pan for some protein. Thanks!

Fast, easy and delicious. I made a strawberry sauce to go with them and they were gone in a few minutes. A perfect breakfast for Sunday's before church because they get gobbled up so fast.

This recipe is great and a definite keeper! I didn't make any changes to this recipe except for adding a little vanilla to the mix, because it doesn't really need any change to it!

These taste wonderful, but the batter was runny. Also, the vanilla suggestion made by others was perfect. I'd suggest gradually adding milk to get to a consistency that works for you.

didn't have pancake mix in the pantry so used this recipe.  it was very good.  I added some apple sauce to the mix instead of oil and used buttermilk.  the resulting pancakes were very light even though the batter was thick.  next time is will use a little extra milk.  easy to make.  this is a keeper

This is a great all-around pancake recipe and tastes great either with syrup or a fruit sauce. I, too, have a family pancake recipe which was passed down from my great grandmother, but it's much more time consuming with many more ingredients.  This pancake recipe is so easy that it may become my new everyday go-to.

I made these and had to substitute almond milk.  They were great!  I didn't make any other changes and they turned out thinner than shown but the flavour was very tasty.

I was looking for a good, easy, quick recipe. Think I found it.   I looked at the reviews and just put in a little less sugar (not full 1/4 c.), it was a little sweet not bad, but it's your own preference, if you like it sweet or not. I tasted a piece before putting any butter or sugar/syrup on it.  It taste GREAT to me. I will use this recipe more often (freezing it) for my morning breakfast instead of the Eggo waffles I have.  Thank you for the recipes

This tastes wonderfully! I whipped up a batch of these and added some chocolate chips and made the most wonderful pancakes. Although they are pretty sweet. I ended up skipping kn the syrup and just topped it with some butter and didn't even miss it!

These are great!  I use 1/4 confectioner sugar and a tablespoon of raw sugar.  Also add cinnamon. But it's so easy why would u use a box?

I used this recipe to make blueberry pancakes.... And now I can't stop eating them! Ok, I did make a couple of minor changes. I reduced the white sugar down to 1/8 cup. Instead of milk, I used 1/2 cup plain yogurt + 1/2 cup water. I stirred in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, and while cooking I  used the smallest amount of oil possible to keep from sticking in the pan. I feel confident that they are amazing as written, but I try to cut sugar and use what I have on hand whenever possible. Thanks for sharing this amazing recipe, OP!

I really liked this recipe,  it turned it a wee bit thicket than I wanted but that was easily fixed with a bit of water.   The best part is its simple and straightforward enough the kids had no problem helping making it.

Very simple recipe. I had to change the flour and milk since my wife is dairy and gluten free and has IBS. I used Pacific organic oak milk and Bob's Red Mill 1+1 Gluten free baking flour. They came out nice and fluffy. I am the one who is finicky in taste and texture and this recipe is saved for future use. We used real Maple syrup and Coconut butter to enjoy these pancakes.

I usually doctor up my bisquick but I ran out and needed a basic pancake recipe. This was basically what i normally make already (i add some vanilla and cinnamon  too though!) Mix was way too runny, I ended up eyeballing it until it was consistency we like in my family, but I would guess I added over a half a cup more of flour and in the end I needed more. Also it was a bit too sweet for us even without syrup on them, so if you dont want super sweet then i would only use half of the sugar.

My son had these pancakes for 2 meals yesterday! I've actually used the recipe 3 times before reviewing. I'm getting closer...each time they taste great but they've previously been ugly or hard to flip. I've sans salt and have yet to think in advance so that my egg and milk are room temp but I repeat the taste is superb! Oh, as is the measurements make a TON of pancakes, I think we came out with 14 or 15 so plan accordingly :)

These are everything. Perfect, fluffy, thick, and so filling. I also only used about 3/4 of the cup of milk because I mixed the milk in as I went and they seemed perfect at that point. Didn't even need syrup. Never buying the box mix again.

This is really tasty. I made it today and I was able to make 5 large pancakes. I love the recipe Nd will surely make this again. I love the fact that it's very easy to make. I mixed everything as mentioned in the recipe but at the end to avoid lumps I blended it in my magic bullet so it turned out to be a very smooth batter. I added a bit extra sugar but I guess it's good as mentioned in the recipe... Thanks for the great recipe...

I've searched for a simple homemade pancake  mix   and   I found it with this recipe.   For sure you can add some other flavors to it and it will work out great.

I'm giving this recipe three stars because I'm willing to believe the taste of the pancakes were a fault on my part. For some odd reason, even though I used less salt than recommended, I could smell the salt coming from them and started to taste it after a few bites. I was wondering if it could have been the baking powder but I followed the recipe as it was written. If someone could help to explain the salty smell and taste, that would be great... Hopefully I can make these again and have them turn out correctly.

these pancakes are so good! We use butter to cook them in instead of oil and add vanilla and cinnamon.  We have added fruit or chocolate chips in the past too. Plain though they are just as good! My daughter AND husband ask for these every weekend. Just the best!!!

Delicious! I made a healthier version by using whole wheat flour and 2 tablespoons of coconut sugar instead. I used 3/4 cup of milk bc some people said the batter was too watery and I added a bit of vanilla. This was a wonderful recipe to work with. Thank you!

If I ever make these again, I'd use less milk, and possibly less sugar too. 

When I made them following the recipe, there was too much milk so I had to add more flour. And the finished result was a much to sweet pancake. It kind of tasted like a sugar cookie.

It is delicious. When I couldn't eat other pancakes, I enjoyed this one. I'm one of those weirdos who doesn't eat everything, and we found out it is perfect with or without syrup. Me and my family ate it at breakfast and all probably agree on five stars. We loved it, finding ourselves with no reason to call I-Hop every day. (But we still enjoy a good I-hop trip! *Chuckle, chuckle!*) Delicious, a winner for all picky families at lunch, dinner, or breakfast!

The batter, when completed, was too liquid-y so I added extra flour. Next time I would use less milk and add a hint of vanilla or lemon juice to add a little kick to the flavor. Also maybe I but more baking powder; I like my pancakes fluffy and these were a little flat.

Great and easy recipe with minimal ingredients. Will cut sugar next time. I added some vanilla and cinnamon as I love that warm flavor profile. Won't be buying a mix again.

As someone who is trying to move away from boxed mixes, I couldn't have asked for a better, easier recipe! I used a little less sugar and only 3/4 cup milk because I like a heavier pancake with syrup :)

LOVE this recipe! It's become a staple in our house. The only change I make is that I add a little vanilla to the wet ingredients and I don't use any extra oil when baking on the pan as it's not necessary.

I love this recipe!!! It's simple and easy. It takes my husband takes 15 minutes to come home for breakfast and from start to finish they're ready by the time he gets home, this recipe is easy to add anything to. This morning we added chocolate chips but so far we've done blueberries, strawberries, peaches, and bananas. Looking forwards to trying more things!

I've made them 3 times, and they are so good that I could eat them without maple syrup...which, of course, I won't. The second time I used 1/2 cup white whole wheat, 1/4 cornmeal, and 1/4 cup oatmeal. Came out great. Today I just used all white whole wheat and think they are even better than regular flour. Love these!

Light and fluffy pancakes!  I did make some changes because of the ingredients I had on hand.  I subbed almond milk and also used whole white wheat flour.  The amount of milk was correct (perhaps because of the flour substitution) resulting in batter that was almost too thick.  I also had to lower the temp to medium to keep the pancakes from burning, but that could be a stove issue since I have an electric glasstop.

This was great! It actually wasn't too sweet for us like many others said. Although, I may have put a little less sugar in this. I added a drop of vanilla, a dash of cinnamon, and pinch of nutmeg. They were awesome! My kids (4 and 6 years old) ate one without syrup and loved it, and ate another with a touch of syrup. Good either way! :-)

Great quick and easy recipe, I will use this as my base recipe from now on, and  perfect further from there. On the first batch, added a TBSP of vanilla (doesn't overpower for those thinking it's too much, but to each his/her own), several swipes of fresh lemon zest and a couple handfuls of fresh blueberries...yum and thumbs up from the whole fam! Don't forget to sprinkle some of your flour on the fruit before dumping in, so they don't sink to the bottom of the batter.

This is the first review I've ever made but I decided to make one because this Taste like heaven! ?? once the batter was made I added a little bit more of flour cause I wanted to make it extra fluffy. Also I added cinnamon and it was delicious! If you don't add these to ingredients then it will still taste Amazing!

The batter is way too runny- had to add more flour. Also it seems there isn't quite the proper catalyst to make the batter bubbly for fluffy pancakes. Plus it is very bland. I added vanilla extract and chocolate chips.

My sons and husband really enjoyed these. I liked them as well but felt they needed something else. Next time I'd follow a few other reviews that said to cut down the milk by a quarter cup and add in some vanilla extract. Not bad at all, though, we will have them again!

I have made these many times and experimented with different flours and each time they were perfect. Just use what flour you like. I added chocolate chips for the wee ones on special occasions and there are never any left. However leftover pancakes (if cooked to a nice golden brown) freeze well and toast up great!!!

This recipe was easy and tastes great. Not sure about the negative comment that was made about the sour taste that it must be the vinegar...there is no vinegar in it! Yum, I will never buy the boxed mix again. Thanks.

Very good and very easy. My batter came out really thin, so I would probably add a little more flour next time. I might also cut the sugar back a bit to see what happens, as these are very sweet. But since I was out of the box stuff, this was a great way to go.

These are Great!  Come out perfect every time...even when I add stuff to them, like blueberries...or bananas...or  all different kinds of baking chips, ie choc chips, PnutBtr chips etc.  Great recipe.  thank you. Oh, and Like another reviewer, I do put in 1 tsp vanilla and a couple shakes of cinnamon, in the fall i add a bunch of pumpkin pie spice, MMMMMMM good!

Great recipe. I enjoyed the recipe as is and eventually started adding extras. I now use this recipe with 1/4 tsp of vanilla extract and a dash of cinnamon.  My daughters always love it.

This recipe is really good.  I use it as my pancake recipe,  since I qualify as a Grandad.   Today I added to the recipe,  1/4 cup of milk, 1/2 cup of sour cream, and a pkg of  instant lemon  (because that what I had) pudding mix, stirred it up.  Tallest fluffyest I have ever cooked.

Delicious! I added a few shakes of pumpkin pie spice. Also VERY easy to put together with a crying toddler in the background. ;) great for very busy people.

Followed the recipe exactly.  The batter seems quite thin, however the pancakes turned out perfect.  The best pancakes I have ever made.

This recipe is perfect as is, but I went to the next level by adding a dash of vanilla extract & one teaspoon of cinnamon. I will be using this recipe for the next thousand years. Thank you for sharing:)

Yep, the best pancake recipe I've ever tried!  Been looking for the perfect recipe for years. The batter consistency is ideal because it's easy to mix and cooks up quickly which is helpful when folks are anxious to eat.  It was obvious my five year approved by the number he ate and when I asked him if he liked them he said, "No, I didn't like them, I LOVED them!"

These are great vegan! My son has allergies and I can easily swap out the milk for almond/soy milk and I use Bobs Mill egg replacer and they still turn out great. We generally add blueberries to the pancakes and they are a big hit.

Granddad knew what's up with pancakes.  Love the density of them and they are sweet enough to not require a lot of syrup.  My boys gobbled up twice the amount they normally would! These will become a Sunday morning staple in our house!

The family didn't like these at all.  They didn't come out fluffy at all.  They were flat and bland.  I know my baking soda is fresh because I use it regularly.  I will not make these again.

My son cannot get enough of these.  He comes in from school asking for them.  They are so easy to make...especially since we have moved to Africa and there really isn't a ready mix.  I bought the ready mix in the States and he would eat them, but never ask for more!  I make it about twice a week.  It is good in the fridge for about a day.  Thicker on day two and just taste ok. (I try not to throw anything away!)

Like this better than box mix. It has a touch of sweetness, which I like. I used coconut oil for mine, adding a tropical flavor to them. I also use coconut oil in the pan, but I think butter browns better. Definitely my favorite pancake recipe.

This recipe is AMAZING!!! I make it all the time, as written and it's perfect. Today I decided I wanted blueberry. So I made 4x the recipe (i have a big family). And I added one egg and left one cup of milk out, but replaced it with one cup of blueberries. They are light, fluffy and delicious! Try this recipe. It's great.

The only pancake recipe you really need. This recipe is simple, but as noted in other reviews, the batter is a bit liquidy. I just added flour a little at a time until the consistency was right. I also added a tablespoon of Ronald Reginald's vanilla bean marinade. These pancakes rose quite a bit and were fluffy and light.  So many pancakes end up very heavy, but definitely not these. I don't think I'll ever go back to my family recipe again!

This is a very good recipe! I added a tsp of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg. Very good! I haven't a clue as why another reviewer said there was an aftertaste,that it must of been from the vinegar.??? Excuse me but I didn't see any vinegar in this recipe! Thank you for sharing your recipe!

best. pancakes. ever. I hated pancakes before this recipe because I could never get them just right, but after this recipe, I love them! The sugar was a bit much for me, so I added a little less but all in all it was great! Adding some semi-sweet chocolate chips makes them taste great too.

My family and I loved these pancakes.  They taste just like our great-aunt's pancakes.  I tweaked them slightly my adding a splash of pure vanilla extract.

Love how easy this is, I always have the ingredients on hand. My pickiest kid loves these. I do not let milk and eggs get to room temperature,  and I add 1 Tsp vanilla. I use coconut oil most of the time with this recipe as well. They always come out great. Also I double and freeze all leftover.  They reheat great.

Thank you so much for adding your family pancake recipe! My whole family loves them! From my husband, to my two kids, oldest is a very picky eater, and doesn't always like the recipes I've tried in the past. Even I love them, because I'm a weirdo who doesn't like syrup (I know weirdo) but I love these, cause they are sweet with that little bit of sugar. In fact both the kids and I eat these without syrup! Love them! ????

These pancakes are so yummy! My husband is pretty particular about his pancakes, but I must say these are a hit! I've made them a couple of times now, and they have become our staple weekend breakfast. They are a huge hit with my grands as well!

We've tried MANY pancake recipes and this one has passed the test! 2 batches barely satisfied all 6 of us, so plan on doubling it up if you have a big family. Really, a tasty recipe and definitely worth giving it a try!

Great recipe! I added some vanilla and fresh blueberries and these were delicious! The batter seemed a little runny at first but they fluffed up perfectly when cooking. Great flavor , crispy edges, wonderful texture!

Best pancake recipe on here that I've tried. I didn't alter it a bit and they taste great. They are thick and fluffy. Just the way we like them.

One thing I will say is that I omitted the oil every time after the first time and I think they taste better that way.

I definitely enjoyed this recipe.  I agree w/ the other reviews about the amount of sugar.  So if you don't want such a sweet pancake or if you plan on using syrup, cut the sugar by half.

Made these this morning. Use soy milk and half whole wheat flour. Added coconut and bananas, and cooked in coconut oil. Delicious! Surprisingly light and fluffy considering the whole wheat flour. Definitely recommend this recipe

These pancakes turned out very dense more cake like then fluffy pancake. I added a splash of vanilla and added just over 1/8C of the sugar. They had good flavor but as another reviewer wrote it has an odd after flavor. Too much baking powder maybe? Although I must say my 2.5 yr old gobbled them up. I also added diced peaches to ours and some chia seed sprinkled on top while cooking.

perfect! I use this instead of purchasing pancake mix because this is way fluffier and tastier! NOTE: I ADDED QUITE A BIT OF VANILLA TO THE BATTER BECAUSE THAT'S HOW I MAKE ALL PANCAKES! :)

I just made these pancakes and the thing I loved the most about this recipe is how fluffy the pancakes turn out. I cut the sugar back a little but the pancakes were still a bit too sweet for my taste. I added some cinnamon which added some nice flavor and aroma. I was eager to try out some new Maple Syrup I just got, but these pancakes do not need any added sweetener! I want to try this again with less than an 1/8 of a cup of sugar, the cinnamon, and maybe try almond milk. 

All in all, a very quick, go to, fluffy pancake recipe. You probably have all the contents in your kitchen. Alter sweetness to your taste.

This is the best pancake recipe I have ever tried....and I have tried many.  We make these at least twice a week, if not more.  I usually let the milk and egg set out for at least one hour.  Having the milk and egg room temperature is very important.  I follow the recipe as stated, except only use one tablespoon of oil on griddle and make sure the griddle is completely covered with the oil.  Make sure you let the oil heat up.  If it is not hot enough or there is too much oil, your pancakes will be flat.  Sometimes my first set of pancakes are not the best looking for this reason, but the rest are picture perfect.  I cook over medium heat on a gas stove, using a stainless steel griddle.  Usually cook about 3-4 minute per side.   Try this recipe, you will not be disappointed.

This is the only recipe I use for pancakes now. It is the same way my grandma used to make them and it took my sister and I forever to find the recipe. Thanks so much for posting this!  My grandma used to make them in the cast iron skillet though and Grandpa would use the dark corn syrup. Either way, these are awesome!

These pancakes have a good flavor.  They are a bit sweet, but I liked them just the same.  I guess Grandad  and I both have a sweet tooth.  However, Grandad likes his pancakes awfully thin.  These are on the verge of being crepes.  I'll try a 1/4 to 1/2 cup more flour next time.

This was a GREAT recipe and everybody loved it. I used whole grain flour and added vanilla and cinnamon. It turned out amazing!!! Would definitely recommend this to anyone. You can add fruit or chocolate chips, which make these even more delicious, but they are still perfect plain! Best pancakes ever!!! ????????????????

I can't believe how good these taste. I don't know why they taste so good, but they do. I actually tripled the recipe but only upped the sugar to 1/3 cup. They were plenty sweet so tread lightly with the sugar.

Reading the reviews, I cut the milk and sugar a little. I did sub butter for the oil, but it was good.

This has become my homes weekend breakfast.  My son absolutely loves them and there just sweet enough to where his eats them with no syrup... I also improvised with a Tbsp of unsalted butter because I ram out of oil.  I didn't see a difference in how they cooked or tasted.  Enjoy!!!!

This was a really good recipe. My family enjoyed it and I made a double batch to freeze for left overs later in the week. I also added a bit of vanilla and omitted the oil, replacing it with applesauce.

I have always had issues making pancakes. I tend to burn them every time. This recipe was so simple. I thought the batter was a little thin but once in the pan it worked. They were very light and fluffy. If you do not like sweet pancakes i would definately cut the sugar. I used 2 tbsp and they were still quite sweet. Delicious though! I'll never use a pre made mix again

These were great!  The only reason I can't give them 5 stars is because they would have been way too sweet with the full amount of sugar.  As it was, I cut the sugar down to 2T, which was just right.  They were very light and fluffy, as another reviewer mentioned.

After reading the reviews i also used half the amount of sugar. I had some leftover canned pumpkin so added about a tablespoon and used almond milk instead of regular milk. Excellent!

In my quest for the perfect pancake, this is the closest I have found!  A few modifications:  only did 1/2 the sugar based on others reviews (and that was sweet enough, really), 3/4 cup of almond milk, used 3/4 cup white - 1/4 ww flour, and I did not have oil so I used 1 TB of applesauce.  Oh and a small handful of chocolate chips and my picky kids ate these right up.

a little too sweet. I doubled the recipe so next time I'll reduce the sugar by half. I added 1/2 cup of flax seed. I'd reduce the milk and add gradually.
