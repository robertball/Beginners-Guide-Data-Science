I made this using 1 onion, NOT cooked in the butter beforehand (I chopped an onion and added it directly to the dish before popping it in the oven).  So, my dish is made without the butter, and it still came out well.  The mustard and pickle relish flavors r noticeable, so if u r not a fan of pickles or mustard, I suppose u could omit either or both.  Would make a more rounded meal served with a salad and bread on the side.  All in all, not disappointed here.  Also, this sort of a recipe or dish would make for a great dish to bring to a potluck.

I've made this recipe twice, once with cooking the onions in butter and once without. Without cooking the onions seemed to overpower the rest of the ingredients, also using sweet onions seemed to make a big differene in overall flavor, which I would recommend using. I will DEFINATELY be making this again as its a very unique casserole! Thank you. :-)

I was a little unsure if my family would like this, but it was sooo yummy. Used olive oil instead of butter, but that's about all I changed. I will definitely make this again.

My husband hated it and I threw away the second batch I made to freeze.  It had a strange flavor.

my 15 year old just loved this dish!  i used the wacky mac rotini and exchanged mexicorn for the regular.  i also added some greek seasoning to onions while cooking and 4 dashes of cholula hot sauce to the soup.  definitely will be making this easy dish again for my son and grandkids!

It has an excellent flavour. I made as instructed except used half or 2/3 the relish and mustard. I’d use a little less noodles or a little more sauce next time as it seemed a bit dry. But I’ll make it again.
