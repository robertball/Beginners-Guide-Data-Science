I was extremely pleased with the way this turned out.  Based on earlier reviews, I used 1/8 c dried Italian seasoning instead of the oregano and parsley, and two 14.5 oz cans of peeled diced tomatoes instead of fresh simply because it's what I had handy, and it was still marvelous.  I imagine it would taste even better with fresh ingredients!  The feta on top was a great finishing touch.

I may try this with other meats, like diced chicken breast, just to see how it turns out because I liked this so much.  Perhaps I'll also try it with mozzarella instead of feta.  Serving with noodles is recommended and something I'll try next time also, or make pasta, mix the whole thing up, top with a cheese and turn it into a bake.  Thank you, Rose Ann!

Great Recipe. Quick, fresh ingredients and versatile. I personally prefer it w/ angel hair pasta. Jalapenos add little heat but a great subtle finish. On the vine tomatoes also added to the already robust flavor. 

Changes: I let the tomatoes simmer and reduce slightly and cooked the shrimp(sm/med)in the sauce until pink and ready to serve. This added to the flavor as well as added convenience points. 

A staple in my kitchen. :)

Frozen cooked shrimp, dried seasoning and canned diced tomatoes all worked out just fine.    With frozen cooked shrimp keep the flame low & not too long or the shrimp will be tough.  Also, I only had serrano peppers, which wasn't hot enough for us, so added some crushed red pepper.  Took Henny's advice and stuck it under the broiler to melt feta w/ some mozarella too and three of us loved it over spaghetti.  The leftovers were great non-melted too.  Thanks for a keeper!

I made this recipe the other night. My husband who is always skeptical about recipes I get off the internet, loved this one. And so did I. This will become a regular staple in our home. Which is amazing because my husband is a meat and potatoes guy. I did use pre-cooked shrimp and one fresh tomato with a can of diced tomatoes with onions. It was great the next day for lunch. This will be a dish we will serve to company.

This was quick and very tasty.  The jalpenos gave the sauce a nice zip - not too hot.  The first night I served it with crusty bread. Should have served it over some kind of pasta. Worked out great as leftovers over rice.

This is great. I use the frozen shrimp to save time. Don't be afraid to try the peppers. If you saute them long enough they don't seem to be that hot. My husband does not like spices and he loves this. Great reviews from everyone I've ever made this for.

This is probably the best recipe that I have found on this website!  The only thing I changed was that I used Italian seasoning instead of fresh oregano.  It is excellent!

This was a wonderful recipe.  I didn't have fresh or dried oregano, so I used dried Italian seaoning.  If you cook the tomatoes too long they get very liquidy so don't overcook.  I served it over yellow rice and got rave reviews.

Delicious! I used half fresh roma tomatoes and one can of diced tom. with garlic, basil and oregano, I also had to use red onion (didn't have green) next time I'm going to double the garlic and used a lot more feta(presonal preference) served this over ww rotini pasta and a green salad for dinner and it was excellent! Thanks for sumitting your recipe!

We LOVED this! So quick and simple, and it tasted like I'd spent ages on it. The only thing I did differently was to omit the parsley, and I upped the amount of oregano (I definitely recommend using  fresh. The taste is so wonderful). I also didn't bother adding salt to the shrimp as feta is plenty salty enough imo. Great recipe. Thanks, Rose Ann!

OUTSTANDING!!!  I made a few modifications, but that was just based on what I had in the fridge.  I used shallots instead of green onions, and goat cheese in place of feta.  But man, oh man, this was some seriously good food!  My husband raved about it, so I can see this on going in the "make again" file.  Thanks for a great dish, Rose!  it was awesome.

Wonderful meal...a lot of chopping but worth it. The only thing I did different was added the uncooked shrimp at the end to the tomato mixture instead of cooking it separately and then adding it. We will make this again. Served it over a bed of rice.

This was delicious - even though I forgot the feta, heh (was so eager to eat I just forgot to put it in).  I also only used 1 lb of shrimp - that was deliberate - and it was plenty.  Very good and simple, though the prep takes some time.  Will be making again.

This was very tasty and easy. The direction never say when to add the fresh oregano in, so I threw it in at the end.  Love this and will probably make it frequently it is a great light summer meal.

Delicious, with a nice kick to it. If you don't like spice, you won't like this... we loved it. I tried to "lighten" it up a little bit... I cut the oil in step 1 to 1 tablespoon and used low-fat feta. I also only used 1 pound of shrimp, which was plenty. It was super yummy. Served it over farfalle. Will definitely make this again.

This recipe is wonderful!  I like to make it, then add it to salad...a romain lettuce and light caesar vinegar dressing.  We make this at least monthly, and cant thank you enough for the post!  NOTE - it also works great with chicken.

This was tasty, I just couldn't take the texture of the tomato skins. Maybe next time I'll either blanch and peel the fresh tomatoes or use canned. We tried it with pasta and it was good. I think rice would have soaked up those yummy juices a bit more.

Fantastic outdoor Summer meal.  I served it with garlic bread and over white rice.  Do use all the tomatoes, they cook down and liquify.  And the jalapeno, the heat deminishes with the cooking.  Consider adding more for added flavor.  Very Meditaraian like.  Sheryle & Rich.

I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so used canned diced tomatoes.  Also used some red pepper flakes instead of fresh peppers. Didn't want to spend so much for fresh herbs, so left out. Was really good anyway.  Imagine it would be  wonderful using all fresh ingredients. By the time you buy fresh tomatoes, fresh herbs, feta cheese, and shrimp, this really gets expensive, but is very tasty for a special occasion.

I made this last night and it was fantastic.  I served it over spaghetti and it was a big hit.  Very easy and do not be scared away by the jalapeno.  I was not too hot by any means.

I got several bites into this before I realized I forgot to top with the feta cheese. Once I did, this went from 3.5/4 stars to a definite 5. I did omit the oregano and added basil (preference), and cooked everything in one pan. My four large tomatoes released plenty of juice (from Gramma's garden) so I had no issues with it being too dry. I like this best with whole-grain brown rice or pasta - thanks so much for sharing :)

Excellent! Anyone who gives this a review of less than 5 stars must have the pallet of a cow's back side. There was so much flavor and you can taste them all. It seemed that when one flavor ended the next one would pop up. I didn't change anything except I had some fresh basil on hand so I used it. Only other thing I did was after I heated the shrimp in the oil I had to drain the excess liquid before I combined it with the rest of the stuff. The shrimp I used were unfortunately previously frozen so they held some water. Other than that, this is an excellent, smashing recipe. Thank you very much for sharing!

This recipe was very easy and delicious.  A new favorite in my house! Next time I will use more peppers to make it spicier.

We really enjoyed this and not a bite was left over :)  I did add in some chopped asparagus when the jalapenos and green onions were added, just to make this a well rounded meal.  Delicious stuff, and phew, my jalapeno was spicy lol!

Very good and easy recipe.  Made first time as written and it was wonderful. The second time the grocery store was out of jalepenos so i made with one serrano instead.  I also added some marinated artichokes with the tomatoes.  I will definitely make this again and again.  I also like the idea of trying the same recipe with chicken to change it up.

This was excellent.  Took another reviewer's advice and cooked the shrimp with the tomato mixture and it was very tasty.  Served over a bed of fresh linguine.  Yummy!

Excellent and simple recipe. Probably would have been worth 5 stars if I had the fresh ingredients that the recipe calls for. As others have suggested, I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes (w/garlic and herbs), 2 tbl Italian seasoning, 1 tbl dried oregano, pinch of red pepper flakes and 1 lb of frozen, peeled shrimp. Sauteed it all together while the angel hair pasta was cooking and served with homemade sourdough bread. ...mmm, mmm, good!

This was so tasty! And very easy to make. I will definitely make this again. The only thing I did differently was add some mushrooms when I sated the garlic.

These shrimp are mighty good.  I never would have thought of putting feta cheese on shrimp, but that really made the dish.  Thanks for the recipe.

You can have this ready in 5 inutes flat. I used fresh grape tomatoes, and instead of the oregano I used a dash of Worchisire sauce. Turned out GREAT that way. Also, as others have said, no need to cook the shrimp seperately. Just throw them in with the sauce when you're ready to cook them.

This recipe was very good.  I made some minor changes because I am on a low-fat diet. I used much less oil, and used reduced-fat feta cheese.  The kids preferred it on white rice, I myself used brown rice and it was delicious. It was also very quick and easy for a Monday night. Will definately make again.

This was quick and easy and sooo good. I loved the sauce. I served it over angel hair pasta. However, this was my first time cooking shrimp and it didn't turn out very tender. I think I either over cooked it or under cooked it.

This was very good. I served it over penne pasta and I added one small can of tomato paste and one cup of water to thicken it up a bit. I would recommend this recipe for sure. It was also easy and quick!

For all you amateurs like me. Make sure you saute the green onion and japenos in oil...not the bare pan. But what a great blend of flavors. the creamy taste of feta cheese with a spice of life from the jalapeno and green onion.

This recipe is fantastic! Not only is it incredibly simple, it is also very quick. I have made it three time this past month as the entire family loves it! I serve it over quinoa or brown rice. I had some cilantro on hand the other night and replaced the oregano and parsley with it. I also added lime juice to the shrimp to make a delicious variation. Thanks for the great, healthy recipe!

This was very good! I cut down on the spices and didn't add the jalapeno peppers, cause I don't like spicy foods. I served this on top of some wild rice. I also sauteed some spinach with garlic and mixed it in with this dish. Very tasty! I will double this next time so we can have some leftovers!

My first all recipes try--although I consider myself a great cook, I was interested in this website to try something out of the ordinary for me--And it was a hit!  My Son in law said "definitely restaurant worthy."  I had a little more than 2 lbs of shrimp, so I increased the amounts of garlic and used 3 jalapenos instead of 2.  It was a little spicy for me--wished I stuck to 2--but everyone else loved it!  I forgot to use the parsely, but didn't miss it. So thanks! I'm going to try the Chicken Milano next.

Wow! This is the simplest and most delicious recipe I've made in awhile. I felt like it was almost a Mexican dish, so rice was the starch that we used, and it was perfect. I used uncooked frozen shrimp AND scallops (since we were short on shrimp) and I used only one large jalapeno, and canned chopped tomatoes (one cand had green chilis in it, too). I had a garlic/herb blend of feta here, so that was the topping and I added fresh cilantro after serving for those who wanted it. My husband and both sons (12 and 17) went crazy for it. Thanks a bunch for such a simple treat!

The recipe was really good, but am I the only one who noticed that oregano (which was called for in the ingredients list) was not mentioned at all during the instructions for putting the recipe together?  Just curious, even though I added it when I added the parsley, but that's  something that should be caught and edited in.

this was quite possibly the best thing i have ever eaten. next time i may use more jalepenos though, because i like my food spicy. but seriously, bravo. my boyfriend and i loved it. very rich and flavorful.

the only substitute i made was for the parsley and the oregano, i used dried italian seasoning.. still amazing. i also added a little butter to the pan before i cooked the shrimp.

yum. if i could give it ten stars, i would.

We absolutely loved this recipe.  It would have gone very well with a side of angel hair pasta.  Fresh ingredients are always best.

I thought this recipe was great! Very simple and easy. I used canned tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes and also omitted the feta cheese - I thought it was good without it. It was very good. I will definately make this again.

This was the BEST shrimp dish I have ever had!!!!!  My family loved it.  I am from MD so I added some Old Bay to my shrimp to give it an extra kick.  So if you have some old bay around I highly recommed cooking your shrimp in it!!!!!!!

Wasn't superwowed, wasn't outright disgusted.  Can't say it really registered one way or another.  Probably wouldn't make again, just because for me, it didn't stand out.

Really good.  I used Vidalia onions instead on green, and sauteed the onions in butter. Served over angel hair pasta.

Great recipe. I used to make a different recipe which I baked in the oven. This is much better. Only change was I added a 1 tsp of fennel. Keeper and I will make often.

I have to admit, I didn't go by the recipe exactly. After I sauteed the onions and garlic I also added some red, yellow and orange bell pepper to give it some color with the jalapenos. Being winter I didn‘t have any fresh herbs from my garden so I decided to use Italian Seasnoings to get me by. I also added cajun spices to the veggies as they cooked.  I did cheat and used frozen cooked shrimp since I already had them on hand. Right before everything was done I did add a splash of heavy cream to thicken everything up and a couple of tablesppons of capers. I topped the dish with chopped cilantro and feta cheese and it was awesome.  Hubby lived it and we both went back for seconds.  Served over cajun yellow rice.

really enjoyed this.  next time I think I'll add kalamata olives, but other than that I think it's fantastic as is.  I also think it would make a good cold salad over cous cous or pasta in the summer.

After doing some substitutions (lesser amounts of Chipotle and Guajillo Peppers) to bring the spice within my tolerance range, this was outstanding. As suggested by others, I added a bit of Mozzarella to the Feta and put it under the broiler just long enough to melt the cheese into the rest of the ingredients.

We liked it but had to make modifications.  We gave it 3 stars because of the amount of modifications needed.  We cooked the shrimp in the tomato mixture and added wine to give it a little extra flavor.  We also used canned italian flavored tomatoes (2 15 oz cans) and would probably drain out some of the liquid as the sauce was too thin.  Overall it was good and we'll make again with the changes.

Okay, but not a 'company' dish.  Good for something different than the old 'fresh basil, fresh tomato, feta' recipes.  definitely not 'the best'--average recipe. I won't make again-my family prefers the basil recipe.

I liked the shrimp, and I liked the feta... but I didn't like the recipe other than that. Plus, it was confusing... it's all solid ingredients, but I'm supposed to wait for the chopped tomatoes to boil? When do you add the oregano? I felt like shrimp and feta should have made something much better.
