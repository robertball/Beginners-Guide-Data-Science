I made this gumbo as is.  It makes a lot.  I used a 20 quart stock pot, and have plenty for the freezer.  It was delicious!!  It is the most unique and best flavored gumbo I have had, and I was a chicken sausage gumbo fan before this one.  I love the the combination of the black eyed peas, mustard greens and the pork with all these seasonings. This will be my New Years Day gumbo from now on!

Let me say first that this is one of my favorite recipes.  I've made it a half dozen times in various settings, and it always gets lots of compliments. With that said...

First of all, I can't even imagine making the full recipe.  I cut it down to 1/3 of what's called for, and that easily feeds 6-8, probably 10.  Sometimes I make it just for me and my wife and we split up the leftovers among friends at work.  

Secondly, play around with the ingredients.  I started with the way it's written here, but have gone through various permutations.  I cut the okra.  It makes the gumbo slimy.  I've replaced the pork butt with chicken thighs.  Added extra mustard greens.  I'm thinking about trying some shrimp and/or crabmeat next time.  I think that the mustard greens, black-eyed peas and smoked sausages are a must, but that's just personal taste.  Use this as a base recipe and you'll do well.

Ended up halving the recipe as best I could and removed some things the wife didnâ€™t like. Turned out great. The 3.5 hours all-in was pretty close. Made great leftovers

This is one of my favorite dishes. I used the fresh collard greens with the black eye peas that needed to be cooked. It was awesome. Now everyone wants me to cook it for all of us on New Years Eve.
