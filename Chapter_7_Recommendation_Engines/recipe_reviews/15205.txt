I changed this just a bit, so I can't give it 5 stars.  I added 8 ozs. of sour cream to stretch it a bit and make it more creamy.  I also add about 2 Tbs. of zesty cocktail sauce and a tablespoon of lemon juice to add the zip other posters said was lacking.  I brought it to work for a low-carb potluck and served with whole wheat crackers.  Everyone really liked it.

Sorry to say I was not impressed with this recipe.  I made it for a dinner party and my friends didn't much care for it either.

Very quick and easy - my guests loved it - I spread cocktail sauce over it to add to the seafood flavor.

Horseradish, my friends...about a 1/2 teaspoon.  And 1/2 tsp. of cayenne and a couple dashes of tobasco.  That'll give it the kick it needs.  People were scooping it up with big hunks of bread when I zipped it up a bit!

I made my family guinea pigs with this recipe and soon after it was on the table they were just plain pigs, they ate it all up in no time. Very delicious recipe, well from the bowl scrapings that were left for me it was.

This turned out really tasty but I made several changes.  I blended 8 oz of cream cheese with 1/4 cup of chili sauce as recommended by other reviewers.  Added the one green onion and two cans of canned crab instead of just one.  I don't like canned shrimp, so I bought 1/2 lb. of fresh and steamed it myself with vinegar and Old Bay, then chopped it up.  Other reviewers kept stating this needed a "kick."  I think I figured out what is missing - about 1-2 tsp of Old Bay seafood seasoning.  This was great served with crackers after chilliing.

This was pretty good for a recent holiday party, but even with the addition of cocktail sauce, sour cream, and lemon juice it was still a little bland for my taste.  Serve with savory crackers.  Next time I might try a spicy salsa instead of cocktail sauce.

I make this dip but I use 2 cans of shrimp, a regular small onion chopped fine instead of the green onions and I add seasoning salt (or Trader Joe's 21 seasoning salute if I have it) and course ground pepper.  It is always a hit and ends up being the recipe everyone asks for.

this didn't do well at all on the Christmas appetizer table!  I was surprised, it has great ingredients & potential.  fam didn't like it, but roommate did, so I was saved from dumping the not-cheap ingredients!  might try again, and will jazz it up.. a LOT!

I make this all the time, but I add french dressing, about 2 tbsp and more mayo about 1/2 cup, the french dressing gives it more zip, everyone loves it, its always gone in no time, I usually serve it with chips but crackers would be good also.

I am living near the Gulf of Mexico.  We buy live crabs and boil them in Crab Boil.  Crab Boil is all spices which enhance the flavor of the ordinarily bland tasting crab meat.  Also, in the boil we add onions and lemons along with small red potatoes and corn on the cob.  These veggies also absorb the flavors of the crab boil.  The shrimp are done in similar fashion, but boil a lot shorter time.  The result is the same.  So, whenever I find a recipe that calls for canned seafood, I substitute the home made variety and it turns out well.  So folks, use some spices in the recipe and maybe the canned variety will take on a new flavor, as some of you have done.

I tried this but will go back to my old tried and true dip, which uses cocktail sauce instead of the mayo. It's just the zip you need!

This was my first time using canned shrimp and canned Bumble Bee crab.  I chose this recipe because it was so easy and inexpensive to make, but I found it tasteless.  However, I read the reviews and added the horseradish and Tabasco, and that fixed it right up! I also recommend letting the mixture sit in the fridge for a bit to allow the flavors to come out.

I eliminated the onion because my daughter doesn't like them. It was very thick. Needs acidity. I added salt and pepper. Will add vinegar and maybe some lemon juice next time. It still tasted fresh but just too thick. Put it on top of sliced Portuguese bread. Yum.

This was the perfect dip to serve on New Year's Eve!  It went over big at our house and will be served again whenever dips or finger foods are appropriate.  It was delicious.  I divided the recipe in two, making half of it as it was written and adding Old Bay Seasoning to the other half.  They were equally as good, but having the variety was nice.

This is a great basic recipe and go to for quick snacks. I hit mine with a couple shakes of garlic powder and cayenne. My tribe leaves no leftovers. That's a very good thing. :)
