I haven't actually tried this recipe but it sounds just about exactly like my family's recipe. (My family is German, Irish, and Czech and the recipe likely came from the German and Irish side of the family.) I'm not sure if the recipe author forgot to write this step but we always shred the cabbage and salt it and let it wilt before adding the dressing. We've tweaked it slightly but the flavor remains constant. We now use partially non-fat yogurt to save on calories and the rest mayo. Another idea is that if seeds present an annoyance to perhaps folks with braces or people fussy about their teeth there is such a thing as ground celery seed that is available and we now use that every time we make coleslaw. If ground celery seed is unavailable you could always grind the seed yourself in a coffee grinder dedicated to spices alone.

I made with 2 packets stevia instead of sugar, and with cumin seeds instead of celery seeds, using bagged cole slaw mix. Excellent.

SO easy! I added a shredded carrot for color. Didn't measure any ingredients. I made the dressing in a large Pyrex dish that has a cover. Then I added the cabbage and carrot and just put the lid on and shook it all up. Served it right in the glass Pyrex dish. red bell pepper or purple cabbage would be great too for more color. Served with BBQ chicken and lemon roasted veggies and potatoes.

I used bagged slaw mix, and made this exactly as written. I let it chill for about 2 hrs. It was wonderful, so good I ate the whole bag at dinner. I would not change a thing

Amazingly good. Just like my most fave slaw from a certain fast food restaurant. I used bagged slaw mix to make it even more simple.

I used a pre-packaged cole slaw blend and low fat mayo and Stevia non-sugar sweetner instead of sugar. I also added some fine diced red onion. My family loved this with their pulled pork sandwiches. Thanks!

This is exactly like my mother made (she was German and Pennsylvania Dutch heritage) but she taught me to quarter the cabbage head and then slice it VERY thinly on  a diagonal line , place in a large sieve over a bowl to let water drain from cabbage, then refrigerates (about 1/2-1 hour), then proceed forward.I agree with JKH's recommendation )above or below) in that review. We used less sugar but I'm sure you can taste and adjust (as Chef John would say!).

I made this tonight for my 8 year old son and myself.  It was great!  It was quick and easy and we both loved it.  I used a purple cabbage that I had on hand, three small carrots and a bunch of green onions.  I put them in my high speed blender, covered with water and blended for 5 seconds, variable 5. I drained it and after drying it, added in the sauce, which I followed as printed.  This is definitely a keeper.  It went well with the BBQ chicken and yams.  Thank you!!

I've made this one a few times, and I'm pretty sure it's the keeper. Easy, fast, (I think it takes me about 6 minutes, and that includes chopping the cabbage), and just the perfect classic version I had been looking for. I've tried a lot of them; the cooked versions, the ones with a cup of sugar and mayo, the ones with mustard or horseradish or whatever, and they're all too sweet, or too gloppy, or just not the flavor I was missing, this one is just perfect, and the exact right amount of dressing for the softball sized organic cabbages I usually have languishing in the crisper. I do add a carrot, and today I added a green pepper that I needed to use up, I imagine you can add anything you like and it would be fine. I mix the dressing in a tupperware bowl, dump the cabbage and carrot on top, shake, done, and even better the next day. Really happy with this one, thank you!

I needed a quick recipe to use up some shredded cabbage and this was perfect!  With a little horseradish added, it would probably taste just like the stuff from the famous chicken restaurant.  There was no celery seed in the house, but I will buy some for next time.  Thanks!

To make this super easy, I buy package of coleslaw mix and just toss it with the dressing mix. The first time I made the recipe I used 1/2 teaspoon celery salt and 1/2 teaspoon salt only to realize that celery salt is most definitely not the same as celery seed! Using 1 tsp of celery salt instead of the celery seed and salt seems to be working just fine as a substitution.

I made this almost exactly as written using a 14 oz. bag of coleslaw mix.  I did add about 1/2 of a large carrot, shredded.   This turned out very well and both Hubs and I enjoyed it.  In fact, Hubs had three helpings and almost polished it off!  I won't hesitate to make this one again!  Thanks for the recipe!

This dressing is so easy and so good. The only thing I did different was add a little extra salt the second time I made it. My family loves this slaw and I will make a double batch from now on.

Delicious!  Thank you for sharing.  Was given a fresh purple cabbage so used that and added 1 shredded carrot and used apple cider vinegar. Will definitely save this recipe.

Great recipe!  I made it as written though I did add a shredded carrot and one bunch of green onions finely sliced.  The balance of flavors in the dressing is perfect. I measured every thing into a a jar, shook it up, then poured over the cabbage.  So easy! This one goes in the recipe box for future use.  Thanks for sharing.

Family loves this (hubby, 2 yr old, 4 yr old, and me). Don't bother taste testing until it sits in refrigerator for a couple hours. I didn't have celery seed the first time I made it but added 1tsp chia seed for the health benefit and since it also gave a similar look. This week I added 1tsp ground flaxseed as well and it did not alter the flavor. So far it's been good even with me tweaking the recipe. Highly recommend this.

I have doubled this recipe several times and it goes over so well with everyone!  Even those who like more of a vinegar-like slaw...it's a huge hit!

I didn't make quite as written.  I had a bag of pre-shredded slaw mix and didn't think it made enough dressing so I used an additional 1/2 cup of mayo.  I also did not add celery seed because I didn't have any and added about a teaspoon of black pepper.  Turned out great!
