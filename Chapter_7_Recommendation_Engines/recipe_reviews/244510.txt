This tea is so good for you! I don't drink it every day although I should. I've used it to nurse me back to health when I had a horrible cold and when I get UTIs I lean on this too. The vinegar helps balance your Ph levels which helps your gut! Someone else said make sure you use the vinegar with the "mother"in it. Like Braggs. I agree.

So many healing properties in all the ingredients in this recipe. Be sure to use the apple cider vinegar with the "mother." I'm making this in the summer but can only imagine how soothing and comforting it will be in the wintertime.

Having a bit of experience with acv, I know that 2tbsp would have been a bit much for me so I used 8oz of water and cut the rest of the ingredients in half with the exception of the honey and cinnamon. If this is your first experience with acv, I would suggest making the recipe as is and altering it to your taste later. The great thing about this recipe is it can be altered quite a bit. If you like more honey, less cinnamon, more water, etc. You want to make sure you get in atleast 1 tbsp of acv to get the full benefit but the rest can be altered to taste. I am so grateful for this recipe. It sure beats just adding acv to cold water. 1 cup a day will make your digestive system happy and is even thought to help regulate glucose levels in diabetics. Although this needs more research, the vitamins and minerals are enough to drink a cup of day. Just replace this with your morning cup of joe or evening cup of tea and your body will thank you later. It is suggested to carry the most benefits in the morning on an empty stomach. The last and most important point is to use "RAW" and "UNFILTERED" acv with the "MOTHER" (meaning it looks cloudy with a bunch of stuff floating around). Bragg is a great brand that is easy to find. I found mine in my local GNC store. Whole Foods or other health food stores should also carry it but in my experience you probably won't find it at your local grocery store.

The original was just way to strong for me!  I was almost shocked at the first taste but I doubled the water and figure I'm still getting the benefits - it will just take longer.

Made no changes, was pretty good and will make again, but don't think I'll drink daily. Couldn't figure out the cinnamon, it doesn't dissolve of course just settles to the bottom. If you sip the tea after it settles you hardly know it's there; if you stir right before sipping, you get too much cinnamon.  Guess I'll use less cinnamon and stir before sipping. Thanks for a good recipe.

I could not kick a cold, this tea did the trick, (I think). I kept this tea as part of my morning routine as the first thing in stomach in am. I was surprised that I could tolerate the flavor, I actually enjoy drinking it. It is sort of savory to me. I use a reusable straw to keep the ingredients mixed while sipping out of the straw or use a spoon stir almost every sip. I do recommend using  the BRAGG brand organic unfiltered Apple cider vinegar. I just noticed it tasted better with this brand. I also use organic mild flavorful lemons (Meyer Brand). I used an organic honey, try an orange blossom honey if you can. Every individuals palette is different. Funny thing is I think this tea has reduced my cravings for sweets. I also started eating smaller portions overall throughout the day. I am not claiming weight loss but, for me personally I have lost a couple of pounds adding this to my daily routine. I also appreciate the calming satisfaction I feel in my gut after drinking it to start my day.

I just made this, and I used only 1 tbsp of acv because I thought it might be too strong to start with 2. I put all of the ingredients in a mug then added boiling water. This helped the honey and cinnamon to dissolve. Much tastier than I expected! I have been struggling with high blood pressure recently,  and I hope this helps.

I have been using ACV as a facial mask for quite a while and i have always heard of the benefits of drinking it but the smell was very off putting. This drink is delicious! I made just as written without the cinnamon. Obviously you can taste the vinegar but it’s a mild taste and the honey and lemon balanced it out.  Definitely found my new morning drink!

I'm very happy with this! ACV is hard to like. You either Love it, kinda like it, or completely hate it with a passion. I've been trying to like it but it's so overpowering. Finally there's a recipe that makes it bearable and actually yummy! I unfortunately didn't have enough honey left to make a tablespoon so I added about 1/2 tsp. of brown sugar. The amount of honey I'm guessing was around one tsp. Also, the fact that it's a warm drink really makes a difference in the flavor of the ACV. 
Will make it again.
Warning, it's still strong. Best to drink in the mornings, will help wake you up.

I was a little reluctant to drink acv, so I started with half the recipe.  The full recipe seems  too much to drink.  It wasn't bad at all.  Definitely need to cut back the cinnamon.  Plan to drink it again for the health benefits.

I love this as a detox tea, especially during flu season! I had to cut out the cinnamon for allergies, but I added more honey. I make a huge cup of this and put it in a thermos to sip throughout the day! It does have a strong smell depending on the amount of apple cider vinegar.

To be honest, the ingredients ratio is ridiculous in this recipe. Too much apple cider vinegar and not enough other ingredients to balance things out. Vinegar has a kick to it, and the lemon will only up that kick, not settle it. Plus, more honey is needed. This recipe is more sour than it needs to be.

We have experimented with the process for several days.  The cinnamon mixing can be a challenge.  We have settled on mixing the cinnamon with the honey first; after it is  well mixed and no clumps, then add the other ingredients to warm water and shake well in a glass jar.  Shake again after each drink.

I make this in a blender (shaker) bottle. That way, it’s easier to swirl before drinking (helps ensure you’re consuming all the cinnamon).

I don’t measure the lemon - just squeeze half of an organic lemon into one cup of warm water. I use 2 tbsp of acv and one tsp of cinnamon. I also don’t measure the honey...just squirt some organic, raw honey in the bottle! As I said before, I swirl it before every sip. This elimates the “chalky” taste of the cinnamon.

I drink this before bed. It helped me kick a nasty cold in a day and a half! Will definitely keep it as part of my daily routine.

I don't particularly like honey, cinnamon? meh, vinegar? ewww, but somehow all these put together make this delicious tea!! I love it!  Sometimes I add a few drops of Stevia (if I accidentally put too much vinegar).

I'm drinking this every day.  Thank you so much for the recipe =D

I make this tea whenever I have a sore throat or am sick in general. It's a great pick me up and vinegar tickles the back of the throat and soothes it. I prefer to add a tsp of ginger and occasionally a pinch of cayenne for an extra kick.

This was not for me ! (and I like sour tastes)  I gave it the second star because it has healthy ingredients. I had to add much more honey to make it palatable. I don't think it needed both the lemon juice and the vinegar. Drink this at your own risk!

This is soo much better than other recipes I've tried!  I drink this first thing in the am and get my day started off right.  I don't alter it at all and sip on it even as hot as it is right now (Summer in OK).  Can't wait to enjoy on a cold night!  Thanks for sharing!

I just made it! I was afraid of the taste so I only used 1 tsp of ACV this time. Will work up to 2. Also used the suggestion of using a cinnamon stick and 2 tsp of honey instead of 1. And I added green tea bags.  I even made some more so I can warm it up in the morning.

Very tasteful and refreshing. I added a little more honey and just lightly shook my mug to roll the cinnamon around to ensure that I consumed all of it before the tea was all gone.  I plan to have this nightly. The Braggs ACV is a lot tastier then my previous ACV purchases so I would recommend that brand. I purchased mine at Heritage Health Foods in Va Beach.

I had to  try this, because it sounded so unusual - tea made with  Apple cider vinegar? ? It's  delightfully tangy, and felt good with my dore mouth/ throat.  

 I made a couple of changes the second time:
1)  I found that ground cinnamon  doesn't dissolve in water -  so I put a cinnamon stick in the water as I heated it.
2) I added an extra teaspoonful of honey, because it was a bit too tangy for me.  

  Much better with those two revisions.

This is a great drink to detox, help a starchy throat and jump start your day. Will be adding to my morning routine along with my juicing recipes
