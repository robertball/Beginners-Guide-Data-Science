This rice tasted pretty good, but the mix of curry powder and soy sauce didn't make for a very appealing color.  I would recommend omitting the soy sauce and adding some turmeric and/or saffron for a really "curry" color.  Also mix in some chopped onion and peas for both flavor and color.

Despite my preference for flavorful foods, the proportion of cumin, curry powder and chili powder to the amount of rice seems incorrect.  I doubled the amount of rice; the spices were still too heavy.  The correct proportion might be 1 tsp or each instead of 1 tbs of each.

Yummy Yum Yum!!! This rice was fabulous! I couldn't find vegetable bouillion cubes so we used a chicken one and it tasted great!! The spices were all perfect and I used 1 TBSP each as listed on the recipe. I've made other curried rices before and it just didn't have enough flavor to my husbands liking...this took the cake!!!! It tasted like something you'd get our local Thai resturant!! Thanks so much Issac.... we love this rice!!!

I really liked this rice. Didn't have a problem with the quantity of spices, although it did seem a bit dry.  I will add a bit more water next time.  

The nutritional information seems out of wack for this...calories (533 cal/serving) seems way high, I assumed it was an error...

I've been searching for a great curry recipe and this is definately a keeper! It tasted wonderful. I did use chicken broth instead of veggie and I needed to add an extra cup of water in order for the rice to cook through. I will be making this again.

The rice was great but be forewarned that it is very spicy!  I had my brother and sister-in-law over when I made this and they both liked it but couldn't eat much because it was too hot for them.  I'll definitely make it again but I'll go a little lighter on the seasonings.

Exellent. I used a cup of organic vegetable broth instead of the vegetable bouillon and water. I didnt have any problem with the quantity of spices either,seemed just right to me. Good stuff.

I halved the spices, but I think next time I will try them at full strength.  This tasted GREAT! And it's nice not to have to add anything to my grocery list to make it. This will be something I make often.

This was fabulous.  It's as easy as making regular rice but adds so much flavor.  I used as a stuffing for a Cornish game hen.  Wonderful addition.

This was quite good. My low rating reflects a couple of things. First, as others have pointed out, the amount of water in the recipe is insufficient. Rice is almost always 2:1 ratio of water to rice. Unless you like your rice al dente (and no one does), double the water. This is a heavily seasoned dish--I like hot food, but this would be too much for most people.  It's hard to season "to taste" when the seasoning goes in before the rice, so this is just a word of caution. Finally, a not a big deal, this needs some salt. Both the bouillon and the soy add salt, and this can be done to taste at the end.

I omitted the chili powder, cumin, and used only one teaspoon of curry powder as my family does not enjoy excessive spices. The meal turned out quite edible, and was even more exceptional with lentils.

I made this as written and it tasted great. I did add some onions and grated carrots to the garlic in the beginning. Next time I will add even more vegetables, but the spices and amounts are just right. It has kick and flavour, but is not overwhelming.

This was delicious and easy!  The only things I changed was double the amount of water for the rice (what kind of rice are you using?), used hot sauce and cayenne pepper in lieu of chili powder, and doubled the garlic because that's how I roll.

I served it with an ad hoc chick pea & tomato dish.

I used brown rice instead and it took A LOT longer. I did not realize this but that was my fault. This recipe does require more water even if you are using white rice, because you need twice the amount of water to rice. I also used a chicken bouillon cube instead. Overall it was good, I added more curry too :).

ok, as recipe is....I give it a 3.  It is WAY too spicy and there wasn't enough water  as it dried up before the rice cooked properly.  Next time I will add more water, decrease the cumin and soy sauce and add some peas and onions.

Delicious and very spicy.  Needs 2 cups of water obviously, I think that was a typo.  Otherwise, delicious.

This recipe was really nice...I left off a star because I thought the process to make the rice caused it to be a bit goo-ey.  I would suggest parboiling the rice in plain water until the water boils whilst preparing the seasonings separately, then add fresh water to the seasonings, drain water from rice and then add it to seasoned water when it comes to a boil.

My husband and I loved the robust flavor of this recipe, and the texture turned out exactly as it should have.  However, we found the final product to be a tad greasy; next time we'll use only 1 T. of olive oil.  Otherwise, it was fabulous (but VERY spicy, which we enjoy but others may want to be wary of).

We loved the flavour of the rice using the full tablespoon of each spice.  I also used vegetable broth instead of a cube but had to add an extra cup of water to cook the rice through.  Great recipe!

Delicious! It was a bit spicy to give to my 2-yr old, but other than that, it was great!
Made it again with half the curry and cumin and it was still delicious, just less spicy.

I'm going to add corn and green peas and maybe diced carrot when I make it, this sounds delicious!  I can't find any boullion cubes in the grocery store though, and I don't ever really like the flavor of vegetable broth that can be bought in those cans so I'm still looking for an alternative plan since I can't use chicken (I'm vegetarian)  Any suggestions?

I took the suggestions to use teaspoons of the spices. As I cooked I wasn't sure how it would turn out. Once I added the rice it came together. I had to cook the rice a little longer plus add water. My hubby and I enjoyed it. I'll try it full strength next time.

Great recipe idea. But only 4 stars because even though the ingedients were correct, some of the amounts were not. Firstly, we need to use double the liquid for any raw rice to cook so add an extra cup of stock or water with quarter teaspoon salt. Secondly the dry spices need to be reduced to half or it would get too hot and over spicy! I used Basmatti rice and added one stalk chopped celery, quarter cup green peas in the last 5 minutes of cooking time. Basmatti Rice needs only 11 minutes on low simmer with closed lid. Finally I sprinkled some chopped spring onions and chopped cilantro, squeezed some fresh lemon juice (1 table spoon) mix it all up  – Paradise on earth!

Loved it, though I used brown rice, increased the liquid to 1 and 1/2 cup and the cooking time.  Absolutely a great dish.

Delish Recipe,  I did make adjustments to it though. Not a lot.  I used 2 cups of Rice and 4 1/2 cups of water in total. Also I added 2 cups frozen yellow corn and 2 cups green peas.  Also I did throughly rinced rice with cold water to prevent it from being sticky- It came out great, the amount of spices is just right, with those adjustments and it has a kick to it, so if you dont want it too spicy try cutting chilli powder in half.

I'm not sure what I did wrong but the rice stuck to the pot, and the seasonings were very...dense, for lack of a better word.

Maybe it's just me, but I did not care for this recipe as is.  It somehow managed to be too spicy but still not flavorful enough.  That could be because I omitted the soy sauce, though.  To make this recipe more to my taste I added an extra cup of water for cooking, diced onions, 3/4 cup tomato sauce, and 2 tbsp sugar.  I threw in some frozen peas and red peppers near the end as well.  With some alterations to the quantities, this recipe made a great base for the final product!

I just bought new spices (curry and chili seasoning) at Penzey's, and was anxious to use them.  This was the perfect opportunity!!  Turned out delicious. My changes: 1)  Used brown rice (healthier and I find it yummier) 2)  Per someone else's suggestion, I added sauted onions (larged diced onion cooked in pot instead of garlic b/c of hubby's allergy to garlic) and frozen peas.  Added some zest and color 3)  Added some whole milk at end to make moister/creamier.    Overall, this dish is very flavorful.  My new spices were fun to use and definitely were better than store brand I am used to using  :)

I gave this recipe 5 stars based on the modifications I made: 2 tbsp peanut oil, 2-3 cloves minced garlic, black pepper to taste, 1 tsp. cumin, 3/4 tbsp curry, 1 tsp chili powder, 1 cube vegetable bouillon,  1.25 cup water, 1 tbsp soy sauce, 1.25 cup basmati white rice. I sauteed some chopped green pepper, and broccoli in a wok separately, and once the rice was done, added the rice to the wok and tossed/cooked the whole thing on medium heat for 3-5 minutes. Absolutely incredible!!!!!!!

Maybe it was just me but this recipe did not work out for me at all. The rice needed alot more h20 than called for and the flavors were totally overpowering. Maybe i will try this again to see if it was me or the recipe, but for now i don't think this is for me!

This was a hit for dinner a few nights ago. Don't over do the cumin though! I did but I was able to cover it up by adding more curry powder, and chili powder.

Like another reviewer had said, the proportion of the spices and rice is not quite right. Luckily it's not too expensive, the ingredients.

Yes it's spicy, but it was really good, there are no complaints here. I thought it needed some veggies in it, so next time will add some chopped onion, peas and grated carrot, or anything else I can find.  I did add more water then called for because it was gone before the rice was cooked all the way.

This was good.  My toddler twins loved it!  I had extra people for dinner and ending up mixing it with an insant saffron rice to make it go further.  It was still good.  I used instant brown rice in the dish and turned out fine.  There was soemthing not quite perfect, but I still haven't figured out what it was.  I would make it again just to figure it out.

This is great! I made it for dinner two nights ago, finished the leftovers for lunch today, then made it again for dinner! When I used almost 2 cups of water the rice cooked much better. I didn't have soy sauce, so I used a little vinegar and brown sugar instead. I stir-fried lots of veggies and some tofu, and served it all with plain yogurt (which helps take the bite out of the spices if they're too much for you). Yum!

I just found this recipe and...let me tell you...I'm glowing after I eat this rice. If you are vegetarian or vegan you can improvise and add some tofu in the last few minutes. If you eat meat, I think some baked or fried chicken pairs really great with this rice. There's something about the spices that have this magical effect.  After you eat it you will feel an overwhelming sense of calm...it's like a drug.  And I'm not exagerating, I make this recipe at least once a week and it's always as amazing as the first time I tasted it.  I recently started a recipe box where I rate the foods that I make and this one got an A+.  Try this rice and you will never go back to RICE A RONI.

This recipe didn't have enough water for the amount of rice. I ended up using about 3 cups of water instead of the 1 cup as written. That aside the rice was quite tasty.

Stellar! This rice is packed with flavor.   I cooked it first exactly to recipe, but it's so good I've changed up the base idea several times to try different variations. Warning - I like hot, so I like this, but it was a bit too much for my wife.

I've made this a couple of times. The first time I thought it was a little salty, so I omit the bouillon and use a homemade broth.  Its very good with chicken and onions too.

This rice dish is wonderful, aromatic and full bodied flavored. One of my children does not like very spicey food, so I did cut back on the chili pepper. I also used chichen broth instead of water. I will make this over and over, especially with chicken.

Maybe I did something wrong, but this didn't end up very good.  The rice didn't cook properly, and the spices didn't really settle in, they just kind of lay on top.

I love this rice! It could go with everything, but I can finish it just by itself. I cooked it 10 years ago several times just the way it is. Now, since I have a kid and just to be adventures, I reduced the amount of red chili to  1 teaspoon, used brown rice, and cooked in the pressure cooker. My kid was telling, "It smells so good," while it was cooking. It wasn't too spicy for him. (He does love spicy food though.) It was not the same as with the white rice, but still was pretty awesome!

Excellent recipe!  Since I am not vegan I made a slight adjustment.  I used 14.5 oz. can of chicken broth and an additional 1/2 c . water to 1 c. of water.  Used instant rice but will try jasmine rice  or basmati rice next time.  Spices were great!  If per chance it is too hot for anyone I would suggest adding sour cream or cucumber dressing/Tzatziki sauce to cool it off a bit.  Will be definitely be making again!  Thank you.

Doubled everything including the rice.  Omitted soya sauce as was suggested, and added about 1 tbsp. of tumeric. 
Also added chopped onion, chopped red pepper and peas.  Would definitely make it again.  Quick dinner!  Loved it.

Very good and easy to make. I left out the soy sauce because I didn't have any. Thank you for the recipe.

Overall this was a pretty good recipe. I didn't have any vegetable broth so I just omitted that and it tasted fine. Also, I used cook rice which doesn't soak up all of the flavor, but still came out tasty. I added peppers, carrots, potatoes, and tomatoes to the garlic in the beginning and it adds a great variety of flavors to the dish.  For the spices I added 1/2 tbsp of cumin, 1 tbsp of curry, and 1/2 tbsp of chili powder and its a perfect balance of spice. The only con I have of this recipe is the lack of salt, which is probably because I didn't add any broth, but other than that this is a fantastic recipe!

After reading other reviews, I changed the tablespoon quantities for the curry powder, chili powder and cumin to 2 teaspoons instead and the spice was just right. I mixed the rice with some lime juice and some mango chutney after it was done cooking. I also added in some mixed vegetables and corn (aren't frozen veggies the best?) Totally going to make this dish again!

Great as written, and great with experimenting! For those of you who frequent Thai or Indian restaurants, I highly suggest you use the amounts as written: cutting the spices down is an insult to this dish! I like to use 1/2 T turmeric and 1/2 T curry powder to get the anti inflammatory properties of turmeric, and I use liquid aminos instead of soy sauce (same taste). I also like to add other tough greens like collard, mustard, and turnip greens, and after the rice is cooked I mix in 2 Roma tomatoes sliced like apples (seeds and all) and cover and steam for 5 minutes, I also like a sweet contrast so I sprinkle sugar on top, drizzle honey, or put a scoop of jam on top. Like I said, it's good as written, but easy to change it up! AND it's vegan!!

I kept the proportions of spices the same, my only complaint is that it definitely needs salt. Probably about a .5 to 1 teaspoon. Otherwise, so good and so fast! I added in diced onions to the saute and peas after I added the rice. My husband just couldn't get over the idea that I had made this in less than 20 minutes. He kept asking, "and this is completely from scratch?" He loved it!

This is a great base recipe.  I used about 1 & 1/2 cups of minute rice to the same amount of spices.  I love veggies, so I put some sliced carrots in with the rice and put sliced onions and frozen peas in towards the end of the cooking process.  I'm not sure if it's because I used minute rice, but I used about 3 cups of water for 1 & 1/2 cups of dry rice to ensure it got cooked properly.  I like spiciness and I had mild curry powder, so I put some chili pepper flakes in there as well.  Overall, it had tons of flavor and would make my modified version again!

This was really great, thank you so much for posting it! I didn't follow the exact amounts (I just kind of guessed and added more if I thought it needed it) but the combination of spices was beautiful. I added onions and peas (and some tumeric and I only used a little bit of soy sauce since someone here mentioned that with the soy sauce the color was less attractive).

Very tasty rice, though I recommend halfing the ammount of cumin... it's a very pungent spice and it'll overpower the taste of the curry if placed in 1:1 ratio. 
As of the ammount of water, 1 cup is too few. I used 1.5 cups AND I thoruoughly washed and soaked the rice beforehand, and it came awesome that way, so I'd recommend using half as much water (or more, depending which type of rice you'll be using).
It also goes very well with mushrooms and with curried coconut milk, if you're looking for variety. Will make on a regular basis!

This is very tasty! Like a few others pointed out, the ratio of water to rice seemed off, so I doubled the liquid. I used a rice cooker, sautéing all of the ingredients in a small pan then transferring them into the rice cooker with the water and the rice. It came out great. I also added a fresh plum tomato to the sauté mixture. I think this would be great with a few more vegetables and even some shrimp.

I have made this with the added water and rice. But I also made this with "cauliflower rice". I put the raw cauliflower in the food processor and chopped until it looked like rice. It doesn't need to cook as long, and I might have added maybe 1/2 cup of water. Also good.

Really liked this.  I did cut the spices in half per other recommendations and was glad I did.  Still had plenty of bite without being so much as to be difficult to eat.  Used 2 cups of water, but will cut this back to 1 3/4 cups as it was a bit more moist than I prefer.  Added small amounts of chopped veggies, (onion, carrots, peas) as I served it with a stir fry.  I would add more veggies if I were to serve it as a side with a protein.

I already had 3 cups of (uncooked) basmati rice going in the rice cooker when I found this recipe. Since I am a bit shy about really spicy foods, I left everything the same, knowing I was going to add about 4 cups of cooked rice to the seasonings. Once it got to the point of adding the extra water that was meant to cook the rice, I added 3 ribs of diced celery, 2 thick slices of diced red onion, and 1 large grated carrot. It only took 3 minutes or so to cook them to the desired texture, then I stirred in 4 cups of cooked rice. It was still a tiny bit too spice for me, but I just added some of the leftover plain rice into my bowl, and I loved it. My husband said it was delicious as is; but he wouldn't mind a little more curry. Done my way, I used about half the spices the recipe called for, for the amount of rice I added!

Cooked it for dinner, it needs twice as much water, or two cups per one cup rice, I thought it was wonderful but my husband hated the smell of the cumin and loved the taste. Had to dump the rest out as he just could not stand the smell of that cumin.
Served it with Naan bread.

I didn't have chili powder, and only used a 1/2 tb. of cumin, added a green onion and used non-fat vegetable broth in place of the water and bouillon.  I also used Minute Rice brand jasmine rice.  This turned out fantastic! Will make again!

I used the same amount of spices as the recipe called for, gave it a nice kick, not too spicy that you couldn't eat it. Added onions and peas. Had to use almost 3 cups water instead of one. Added salt, very tasty.

This is so yummy! I like it by itself, but sometimes I add a package of curry-marinated tofu and a bag of frozen mixed veggies, and it is SO! GOOD!  I don't think it's too spicy or too salty. I use low sodium vegetable broth for the liquid, and I actually add more curry powder near the end.

Hey me again. I have to say when I made this I cooked the brown rice before adding it to the sauce pan. I added the vegetable broth as needed to keep it from being too dry. I cook brown rice frequently enough that I have cooking it down to a science, so I don't mess with my method. Again my husband said it ROCKED!!!!

This rice had a good flavor but took me awhile to cook. I'm not sure if it was the rice i was using or the the fact the recipe didn't call for 2 cups of water. I had to repeatedly add water to my pan. My family liked the recipe but I'm not sure if I'll make it again.

I was dubious about the amount of spices, and with good reason. The taste was okay - a little bitter - but the texture was odd. After adding the bouillon cube and a bit of water, the garlic and spices were a thick paste, and a noticeable pastiness remained in the finished product. Also, I've never seen a long-grain rice recipe cooked at a 1:1 ratio. The package my rice came in called for 1 3/4 cups of water, so that was what I used. (I try to follow recipes as written the first time, but not when logic dictates otherwise.) I doubt that we'll make this again, but thanks anyway!

Not bad but a little too spicy, even for me. Next time I'll go easier on the chili powder. Also, perhaps becase I used basmati rice, I needed twice the amount of water stipulated.

Great recipe with a few changes: I added more spice as I found it a little bland. I also added whole cumin seed to give it a little texture. I served it with tomato slices sprinkled with salt & lemon juice over the top. I also used homemade vegetable broth and had to use 2c.

The proportions of liquid to rice were way off, I added about a 1/3 cup more and it still turned out terrible, really dry and crunchy. I gave 2 stars because the spices were good, strong but worked well. The second time around, I used a lot more water and also threw in an onion and some peas.

I had such high hopes for this becoming a great regular in my line up but it just didn't turn out good.  It may have been chef error, and I may try it again, but I found the rice did not want to get soft and the texture with the seasonings was a bit gritty.

This recipe was fantastic! I go to a potluck every Sunday at a friend's place so I'm always looking for quick but plentiful recipes, and this was perfect.  I'm a vegetarian and another girl there is a vegan so this worked out well for both of us.  I added a handful of mushrooms when the rice was almost finished cooking and it turned out beautifully.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

I did not care for this recipe.   Proportions are all wrong.  Needs at least  twice as much water.

the over all recipe was yummy!! i was skeptical about it at first, because the spices didn't really smell good together. but when it came out it was surprisingly good!! but the rice that i used called for more water, so it didn't come out perfect:(

This was great!  I used chicken broth and a little bit of water instead of the vegetable and it turned out wonderful.  I can't wait to add more to the rice next time I make it, perhaps an egg and some veggies!

I made the eggplant curry from allrecipes.com and I wanted to serve it with a rice dish that had like flavors. I did make this way different from the recipe, though, since I had already made plain, white rice to serve the eggplant curry over (before changing my mind). Since I like this recipe, I decided to just add the spices to the rice I had and just cook it a bit more in the microwave. I was still awesome. My husband asked for seconds on the rice and my daughter could not stop eating the rice from the pan, my plate, her dad's plate, etc. "Guess you shouldn't make food that tastes this good. Then, I wouldn't steal yours." :) The only thing I can say is that with my rendition, it was SLIGHTLY "grainy" (due to the powder spices, I am thinking). The flavors of the rice were wonderful, though. Spicy, yes, but wonderful nonetheless. I'll make this again but, next time, I'll try following the instructions to the tee.

Like other posters, I added a cup of water, and added a 1/2 cup of peas.  We had it with pork chops.  Yummy!  My husband loved it.

Great, but...  I followed most everyone's notes and added the second cup of water which was really important.  It was a little too warm for me though.  I used curry paste instead of powder, so I halved that.  But I think all of the spices could be taken down by half from the recipe; I still couldn't finish mine.  And the only other issue was that it needs a little texture of some kind.  We're planning to try the leftovers cold with some canned chicken for lunch, sounds very tasty!

I used this with instant rice.  I poured everything in together, at the beginning and it still came out great!  I used 1 tbsp Bragg's Liquid Amino's instead of soy sauce.  Great recipe - thanks!

Wow! This was a total disaster! Maybe the recipe is ok for those who know how to cook but...in my case it came out uneatable. The garlic and the other spices got all burned up making the air in the kitchen hard to breathe. Then i mixed in the rice, and covered it, and by the time it was supposedly ready i foudn out that a thick layer of spices and rice got all sticked at the bottom of the pan. I should have probably used a non-sticky recipient, but oh well....

Honestly I wasn't a fan of this. It needs a little "something" to give it that "WOW!" factor...I'm just not sure what it is yet. I'll probably play around with this.

All I wanted to do was cook up some wild/brown rice I had sitting around - I never expected to be so happy with the results! This recipe is now one of my favorites, and I've passed it on to alot of people already. It's very versatile and tasty. LOVE IT! I'll keep making it. And making it... and making it...

this recipe was glorious.  though it didn't have all the bite of traditional indian style curry, it was the perfect temperature for people with a low threshold for hot.  if anything, the spices could easily be increased to have a more authentic flavour.

I didn't think the spices were too much, but I didn't think this was particularly good. I like curries but I don't really like rice, so that could be why. My family ate all of this, however, without complaints so it must not have been awful.

This recipe was really good, though I thought the concentration of spices was a little strong.  I added more rice to the sauce to even out the flavor some.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was NOT what I thought it was going to be. It tasted like Chili Rice not Curried Rice. I threw it ALL away. I will NOT make this again.

I usually don't like to rate recipes that I've made changes to since it isn't the original recipe anymore but in this case I really want to comment!
I made this last night, using more liquid, as others suggested. I also used sushi rice because I like sticky rice and also because that's all I had. 
I didn't have veggie bullion cubes so I used a mix of 1 cup water and 1 cup veggie stock. 
I used the spices as listed and it was wonderful!!! Hubby went back for 3 bowls and that never happens! He said he should probably stop eating it but he couldn't! And it IS spicy. That is saying a lot coming from a person like me who's favorite category is "stupid hot"! LOL 
This a great recipe and I can't wait to try it with regular rice to see if it gets a creamier consistency. Will definitely make again!

I've made this recipe 3 times since I first saw it, but with some modifications.  I added extra curry powder, some garam masala and ginger as well as currants, frozen peas and carrots and hash brown potatoes (not sure if that changes it from vegan).  The quantity of water needs to be adjusted and I used jasmine rice as a variation. Delicious and versatile!

The smell was a bit much for me, but my father had woken from a deep sleep absolutely loving the smell, reminding him of his grandma's Armenian cooking.
It was a nice recipe to try, but I won't make it again unless my father's bagging will make me give in.

I added a small yellow onion to the mix before the garlic.  I thought the spice blend was good, but found it sufficent enough to flavor 2 cups of rice for my personal taste.
