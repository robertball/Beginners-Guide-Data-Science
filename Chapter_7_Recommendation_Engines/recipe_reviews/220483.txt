The first time I made potato candy (over 50 years ago) I used a large potato and ended with enough candy to feed a crowd. My grandmother told me I should have used a tangerine-sized potato and add confectioners' sugar until the mixture resembled pie crust dough. This makes plenty of delicious candy.

I have a similar recipe, without the peanut butter.  We make small potatoe shaped pieces and roll in cinnamon.  A traditional gift given to my kids from my mother

This was never a favorite of mine, but hubby and kids love it.  Like someone else said - I never knew it was Irish.  I was always told it was all my grandmother could afford for sweets.  We always made it by using leftover mashed potatoes.  May be a little richer with the cream and butter in the potatoes.  Nothing could be easier to make and fun for the kids to help with.  Can't wait to teach my new grandson how to make it.

I used this recipe and made two kinds of candy from it, the first I added green food coloring and made as recipe suggests, rolled up, chilled and sliced. I was a bit short on powdered suger so ended up using some (quite a bit actually) corn starch to finish it off. The candy was not overpoweringly sweet this way and still tasted good!
The second candy I shaped into irregular, potato shaped balls, rolled them in a mixture of equal parts cinnamon and cocoa then pressed in tiny pieces of almond "eyes" Cutest potato, potato candies you ever saw!

I have been making this for 70 years but never knew it was called Irish since I am German! We all love it and even use food coloring at Christmas time to give it either red or green!

I really like these cookies but find them too sweet, sort of like peanut butter fudge.  My son said they taste like a peanut butter cup minus the chocolate.  A friend suggested adding cocoa to cut the sweetness.  You could also consider adding dried milk to reduce the sugar as well.  Thanks for the unique recipe!!!

My Mom made this when I was a kid & I'm 60 now. Still a big hit in my family. Somtimes Mom would add a thin layer of grape jelly or strawberry jam on top of the peanut butter before rolling it up. It's simple, easy & tastes great.

My grandmother made this candy for her eight kids before the depression and my dad passed it on to his three kids.  Our children are now teaching their kids...what fun!  Kids think it is such a goofy recipe but they love to help make it.

I have made this exact recipe my whole life, it's a holiday tradition in our house.  The secret is not using too much potato.  If your potato is too big, you'll end up using so much confectioner's sugar.  I know it takes a whole box usually, but instead of measuring it out, I just keep mixing a little more in at a time until I achieve the dough.  You absolutely have to be a little flexible with this, and not get hung up on exact measurement with the sugar.  Just add it gradually. I agree that it is very sweet, that's why I like to use chunky peanut butter, and maybe sprinkle in a dash of sea salt on finished pieces for that salty/sweet taste.

I make this for my sons class every year & this past year he did a report on Ireland & had to bring in a food, so I made this, most kids love it, b/c they don't know what's In it...
It's fairly easy & to make it festive, you can add food coloring or sprinkles.

I work at a camp and always try to sneak "secret" healthy ingredients into foods, so potatoes in candy were a no-brainer for me to try! I can't rationalize so much sugar though, so I took other's recommendations and added a tablespoon of cocoa and a cup of powdered milk (in food processor to make more powdery and less chunky) with 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar and a tangerine sized potato. I will make again and keep tweaking the proportions- it was not easy to roll and was pretty sticky, plus needed more cocoa to make better chocolate flavor. Will make it with Sun Butter at work also, since we don't use peanut butter for allergy reasons.

To everyone giving this a bad review, use LESS potato than you think you'll need. You can always add a little more later if you need to. This recipe is the exact one my grandmother made when I was a girl. She always told me to use a LITTLE bit of potato (just a few tablespoons of mashed potato really) and you don't want it to be too wet either, otherwise you'll be mixing in confectioner's sugar forever to get your dough the right texture. My grandma's was always somewhere between play doh and pie crust in texture which allowed it to roll out, and then roll into a log easily without cracking. Work quickly after rolling out, the dough will dry out fast.

Yes this is a family favorite. You can do so much with this also. You can add color like in the photo. I add chocolate to make like a Reese type, but me fave is white chocolate and raspberry.

I've made this some years ago. My grandmother was Irish. When I was living with my father I learned to make it from his memory. Dad said I did good ?? I really don't like baking so I never made it for my kids, how sad. Maybe one day I'll try to make it for them or tell them how to make it. They are grown and on their own and I'll be 63 soon. To be honest, I hate being in the kitchen baking.

I love the green color and am using it for a school bake sale-would have never thought of that! As per the ole family recipe, I do add 1/2 tsp vanilla and use a small cooled potato, along with 1 pat of butter to make the confection sugar dough. If your dough is too stiff, a little milk works-just a bit.  I also roll it out, using confection sugar like you normally use flour, before spreading the creamy peanut butter. Wrapping it up in wax paper and chilling as directed above. For those who said it was "too sweet" try using a natural creamy peanut butter without sugar in it. Always love the reaction when you tell kids it has potatoes and they like it!
