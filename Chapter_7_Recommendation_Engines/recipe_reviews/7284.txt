Made two cheesecakes using this recipe. On the first, I followed the baisc recipe, with the exception of adding 1/2 c Bailey's. As reported by the majority of others, it cracked very badly. I disguised it with Cool Whip and chocolate sprinkles. 

***The second I baked using all the tricks I've read about to avoid cracking. 1. All regrigerated ingredients were brought up to room temperature befoe mixing. 2. After baking the crust, it was put in the freezer to cool off. 3. After mixing the batter and putting it into the springform, the springform was placed in a waterbath, with the water being halfway up the side of the springform. I then baked the cake as per the recipe, removing the cake from the waterbath at the end of the bake time. I put the waterbath on the shelf beneath the cake, and left everything in the oven overnight. 

Results: Not even so much as one solitary crack. It was the prettiest cheesecake I've ever made, every bit as pretty as those from the Cheesecake Factory. 

The recipe itself was a hit, with both cakes devoured within minutes by my coworkes. All raived about it.

IME most important thing to do to prevent cracks in my cheesecakes is to GREASE AND FLOUR my cake pans. this is becos cheesecake will tend to shrink and hold together as it bakes, so if you don't grease and flour, the cake will stick to the sides. the surface tension will be too much so it cracks in the middle. a water bath will further reduce the likelihood of the cracking, but the greasing and flouring is the deciding factor. hope this helps.

This recipe produces a very high quality cheesecake.  I use 2 regular cream cheese and 1 low fat, light sour cream and reduced fat Oreos; the lower fat ingredients are totally undetectable.  I never put my springform pan IN a water bath; I place a roasting pan full of boiling water on the rack below my cheesecake.  This steam method works just as well, with no threat of seepage.  Thank you for sharing this phenomenal recipe!

I make this cheesecake often. It's absolutely wonderful! I've reviewed it here before, but I just want to comment on a few things. First, the chocolate flavor is only going to be as good as the cocoa you use. I always use Ghirardelli cocoa in this recipe. Also, I double the recipe for the crust, use chocolate graham crackers instead of cookies, granulated sugar instead of powdered sugar, and put the crust up the sides of the pan instead of just the bottom. That probably makes it taste more chocolatey. 

And remember to wrap your springform pan tightly in a couple of layers of aluminum foil if you're baking it in a water bath. That prevents the water from getting into the pan and making the crust soggy. :)

I love the way this cheesecake looks. It truly looks professionally made. I had no problems with cracks because I used a waterbath. I like to use the wide sized foil because the regular size doesn't cover the whole pan bottom and even overlapping another piece of foil allows for water to leak in and mess the whole thing up. After turning the oven off I left the door closed with the cheesecake in for another hour and then put it in the refrigerator overnight. When making the crust , keep on stirring it up and don't be afraid to use your hands (clean please) if necessary to form a "more pasty than crumbly" crust. The only thing I changed was the amount of irish cream which I upped to 1/3. The taste is very subtle but I liked it very much and so did everybody else that tried it.

This is a GREAT cheesecake!  I made this for my husband's birthday and it turned out fantastic!  I did use the other suggestions and increased the irish cream to 1/3 cup and cooked in a water bath. I let the cake cool for a couple hours in the oven before removing and had no trouble with cracking.  After reading a couple reviews stating that this cheesecake didn't set properly, I was a little concerned...but those concerns were unfounded.  This is delicious with a wonderful texture.  I topped this with chocolate fudge for a truly decadent treat!

I brought this to work, it went very quickly and everybody raved about it.  I did make some changes - I used chocolate graham cracker crumbs, 2 Tbs regular sugar instead of the confectioners sugar, and half of the cocoa for the crust.  I didn't bake the crust either (I actually just forgot that part).  I also put in just shy of a 1/2 cup of irish cream, as some other people have suggested.  I also greased and lightly floured the spingform pan since I read all those posts about the cake cracking badly.  I started to do the waterbath, putting a pan of water on the rack below, but I took it out after 10 minutes, since I have never baked any cheesecakes that way, and never had a big problem with cracking....I read some posts about the texture being like "mousse" and I was a bit worried. After the baking was done I left the cheesecake in the oven to cool with the oven door partially open.  The texture was excellent, not like mousse, so I was pleased.  I personally prefer regular cheesecake, but like I said, everybody raved about this cheesecake.

This was the first time I had tried to make a cheesecake.  I made it for a Christmas party and it turned out great!  I may add a little more Bailey's next time...

AMAZING! I've used this recipe many times over the years! Never failed me.  All my friends love it - especially chocoholics! :) Some of those who do not like chocolate as much seem to enjoy plain cheesecakes more.  Also I made it once low cholestrol with all fat free cream cheese and fat free sour cream - and it was surprisingly BETTER than the original recipe! My bf said b/c it was lighter and also softer! :) :) Also bake it in a water bath! :) that helps :) If you have time - don't open the oven door for 8 hours after baking - that seems to do wonders too! :)

This cheesecake was really smooth!  However, I used 1/3 cup of Irish Cream and that still didn't seem to be enough.  May try 1/2 cup next time.  This dessert was really enjoyed by all.

Oh. My. Goodness. This is gorgeous! Absolutely incredibly delicious! This is my new favourite desert, I'll probably end up making it for myself for my birthday it's so good! 

I followed the recipe exactly except for the addition of a few tips for avoiding cracks I had read. I greased and flowered the pan, used a modified water bath (I didn't want to fiddle with sealing my springform with foil so I just put the pan of water on the rack directly beneath the cheesecake), When it was done (the given timing was perfect in my oven) I ran a thin knife around the edge to loosen it, then put it back in the oven with the heat off  and the door shut until the oven was completely cool, then left it on a cooling rack until it was totally room temperature before refrigerating it. There wasn't one single minuscule crack, the most beautiful cheesecake I have ever made! (I usually end up with things that resemble the grand canyon)

It is a little bit lighter in texture than cheesecake usually is but I quite liked that, it wasn't fluffy or mousse like, just not quite as thick and heavy as most cheesecakes. I also liked that the flavors were fairly delicate, not faint by any means, it was solidly chocolate and Irish cream flavored, but  nothing was overpowering or overwhelmed your palate, so you could really enjoy every bite. (though I guess I did use more of 1/4c and a splash of Bailey's than a strict 1/4c)

Fabulous fabulous fabulous! I am wishing I had an excuse to make more already!

This is the most requested recipe people ask me to make.  I use a 10 inch pan so I change the serving size to 16 JUST FOR THE CRUST.  I also add 1/2 cup of Baily's instead of 1/4.  

To keep it from cracking, wet 2 dish towels and put them in the freezer before you even make the crust.  After the crust comes out of the oven to cool, put the whole springform pan into the freezer along with the now frozen dish towels wrapped around the rim of the pan.  While it's in the freezer mix the batter.  Once the batter is done take the pan out, fill it and keep the frozen towels around it and let the batter settle for 15 minutes before putting it in the oven.  Bake as suggested, but shut the oven off after 50 minutes, leave the cake in the oven for another hour before loosening it from the rim.  Put it back in the oven till completely cool (I usually make it after dinner and leave it over night).  The cold rim will keep the batter from baking the sides first, before the center; keeping the heat distribution more even.  It's the same purpose as a water bath, but it's an easier method.  Works for me.

This is a recipe for an incredibly rich, restaurant quality (yes I'm talking CHEESECAKE FACTORY) cheesecake! I made this twice - once as a whole cheesecake, then second as mini cheesecake cupcakes. First time, I followed the recipe as-is except added 1/2 cup of irish cream as others had mentioned. For the crust, instead of chocolate cookies I used chocolate graham crackers which you can get next to the normal graham crackers at your supermarket. I even baked this a few days ahead of serving and it was marvelous. Second time, I made into cupcakes by just smashing the crust into each cupcake liner with the end of a plastic cup, and then pouring the cheesecake mixture ALMOST to the top. I baked at 325 for 25 minutes and these were delicious too! I realize 1/3 cup of baileys is the best amount.

Extremely rich and very sinfull!  I had never made cheesecake before and tried this recipe.  Turned out great!  Follow the instructions exactly but also but a boiling water bath on the rack below the cake.  After the cake has finished, leave in the oven another hour at the least to cool and do not open the oven door.  I had no cracks or anything!  Pretty good for a first try.  A must try recipe, thanks Elaine.

This is a great cheesecake! However, I was unable to find any of the liqueur the day that I made it, so, I substitued caramel syrup.

I have made this cheesecake many times as it is always a hit with whomever I make it for, I have made some tweaks that I feel make it a better cheesecake. For the crust use 1/3 to 1/2 cup of melted butter, sift the icing sugar and cocoa as well to avoid lumps. For the cheesecake I double the cocoa and flour, use 3/4 cup of Baileys and omit the sour cream, add 1 tbsp of vanilla and 1 tsp espresso powder. I bake mine with a water bath on the rack under it and have no cracks, after 60 minutes I turn off the oven and let it sit for another 60 minutes before chilling in the fridge overnight.

Admittedly, I made a few changes, but the base recipe is excellent.  I omitted the flour and cocoa powder from the cheesecake mixture, and didn't add cocoa to the chocolate cookie crumbs for the crust.  I didn't start at 450F, I baked in a water bath (bain-marie) until the cakes were set (I did individual 8-ounce cakes in ramekins).  I also reduced the recipe to one-third its original size--don't need that much for just two!

I LOVED this cheesecake.  The texture and taste were incredible.  The four stars is because the crust didn't work out for me, it was too dry...it either needed more butter or less crumbs.  It was just too crumbly.  Oh well.
I cut back on everything by 1/3 for an 8 1/2" pan and it was still very large.  My top cracked and it would have looked bad plain, so I took it out after 50 mintures and made a DELICIOUS sour cream glaze to go on top.
2 cups sour cream
1/4 cup sugar
1/8 teaspoon almond extract
2 teaspoons + of bailey's
Put on top and popped back in for 10 minutes.  Then put grated chocolate on top and promptly refrigerated.

It was for my mom for her birthday and EVERYONE LOVED IT.

This is one of my absolute favorites!  I really had been looking for a Bailey's Chocolate Chip Cheesecake recipe, so I just leave out the cocoa that would normally go into the mix and carefully fold in 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips right before pouring the batter into the pan.  I also use 1/3 cup Bailey's as was  suggested by other reviewers.  It turns out great every time!

Excellent recipe! I doubled the crust, pressing the excess up the sides of the pan, which left a little "wall" of crust sticking up above the top of the cake -- not an intended result, but one I plan to repeat! Soooooooo pretty! I also increased the Irish Cream in the cake to 1/3 cup. Decadent!

**Note: I used a "steam bath" -- placed a pan of hot water on the rack below the cake while cooking. Helps prevent cracking! Also, make cheesecake a day ahead, so it can set (in the fridge) overnight.

I made this exactly as stated but used the chocolate graham crackers, with the cocoa and sugar of course, and1/2 cup of bailey's.  Perfection!  I put a water bath on the rack under.I have never done that before in 40 plus years of making cheesecakes. I will use that method for every cheesecake I make from now on. Best texture I have ever had and a beautiful top. I let it cool in the turned off oven for about 5 or 6 hours before refrigerating. Absolute rave reviews! Drizzled a little chocolate syrup over each piece before serving. Fabulous! Thanks for a great St.Patty's recipe or any time of the year.

This was amazing and really easy to make! I used the pre-made pie crusts and had some left over. Will make them in little pre-made crusts next time. Even the kid who doesn't like cheesecake loved it! Fair warning - it's rich!

I made mini cheesecakes using this recipe and they turned out perfectly! Instead of making individual crusts, I used a split apart Oreo for each crust.  I added 12 oz. chocolate chips to the recipe, and increased the Bailey's to a 1/3 cup as many suggested.  I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and lite sour cream.  I had no idea how long to bake them.  I baked them in a 300 degree oven for about 14 minutes.  Then I just let them sit in the oven for the next hour.  They turned out perfectly!  This recipe ended up making 3 1/2 dozen mini cheesecakes.

WOW! This was so good! I LOVE Irish Cream so I LOVE this cheesecake! The only thing I did different from the recipe is add 1/2 cup Irish Cream,since I wanted a stronger flavor..which I got! It was more Irish then Chocolate but that is what I wanted. Smooth creamy filling...Ah just so good! I was sooo worried after reading the reviews about the cracks but thankfully mine did not crack! THANK YOU THANK YOU for such a great recipe!

Delicious. I didn't change anything from the original recipe. We will be having this cheesecake again for New Year's party on general request.

I did the water bath like most people suggested and left it in the oven out of the water bath for 1.5 hours with the oven off after baking.  Then left in cold garage (it was probably just as cold as fridge) covered overnight...  No cracks and it was beautiful.  I also didn't have Irish cream so I used Kahlua and boy was it good.  Will be keeping this one around for a long time.

This is one of the tastiest cheesecakes I've ever had. If you like rich...it should be up your alley! It took me several times to acheive the "perfect" cheesecake. I do add 1/2 cup of Bailey's. All other ingredients stay the same. I must have whipped it too much (that will for sure cause cracks) and it was a crumbly consistancy. The last time I cooked it, I didn't whip it as much. Placed it straight into a water bath...and the "perfect" cheesecake was born. Yummm!

This was so-so. The taste was not as full as I'd expected, though it managed to taste like a cheesecake, at least.

I made this for Christmas and it came out flawless. I baked it in a waterbath to keep it from cracking. I got great reviews on it. Everyone thought that it was store bought. It was my very first cheese cake so I was very excited that it came out great.

I was able to cut the calories a bit by using light sour cream and 2 packages of neufchatel (reduced fat) cream cheese, along with a package of regular cream cheese. Served with a dollop of green tinted whipped cream for St. Patrick's Day! I prevented cracking by keeping the cake in the turned-off oven for about an hour after baking, then propping the door open for another hour. I might try a wee bit more Irish Cream the next time.

I'd give 10 stars if i could!  Made this for a St. Patrick's Day Luncheon and the rest of the day I had co-workers complimenting me on how great it was.  Very creamy, not too rich.  My only problem was it cracked - like the Grand Canyon.  I don't think it's the recipe, but I've never had that happen to a cheesecake before and I've made many cheesecakes.  I will make this again, but do some research on how to prevent cracking.  I guess I've just been lucky for it to never have happened to me before.

Fantastic cheesecake!  I made this recipe for the first time a few days ago, so I didn't want to make too many changes off the bat.  I did, however, use only 1 package of "regular" cream cheese and used 2 packages of "1/3 less fat" cream cheese along with it.  I increased the Irish Cream to 1/2 cup at the suggestion of many other reviewers and found that that amount added plenty of flavor.  I also substituted Splenda for a very small portion of the white sugar, and used light (but not fat free) sour cream.  It tasted fantastic with no hint that those substitutions had been made.  I will definitely make this one again, and next time will probably use all of the lesser fat cream cheese, and substitute Splenda for even more of the white sugar.

Amazing! I am an avid "cake" baker...and had never made a scratch cheesecake...my husband who is not a big cheesecake fan even said it was great! My guests loved it.  I made this in an 8 in. Cake pan, lined with parchment on bottom and sides, baked in a water  bath and followed the recipe exact other than adding 1/3 cup Irish cream and cooking for 10 min longer. After cooling, I flipped it cookie side up...added some extra cookie crumb on top and garnished with a circle of strawberries. Great St.Patty's dessert...thanks for sharing and all of the comments!

Very creamy and tasty. Cheated, used store bought chocolate crusts...this recipe filled 2 crusts.
Baked at 350 for approx 40 mins. Mixed Kaluha and Irish Cream together for 1/2 cup total, really had a rich and complex flavor. Decreased the sugar to 1 cup, found the liquor was very sweet. 
HINT: to prevent the white bloches of cream cheese. Mix one block of cream cheese and then add sifted cocoa powder a little at a time then add more cream cheese till all is well mixed and no white is showing.

Fantastic!! Cheesecakes in a springform pan are my feared recipe...all the talk of the water bath, the cracks, wrapping the dish with foil scares me off most of the time - so glad it didn't this time! I did increase the amount of butter for the crust, to made it easier to press into the pan. I did wrap the bottom outside with foil, sprayed the springform pan with flour/oil spray and put a pan of water on the rack beneath the cheesecake - still cracked just a touch, but just made it authentic looking. So rich and tasty - our hosts happily kept the 2 small leftover slices!

I was pretty disappointed in this recipe. I was looking for a good chocolate cheesecake recipe, and this was not very chocolatey or very cheesecakey. The chocolate flavor was barely noticeable (the Bailey's contributed most of the flavor) and the consistency wasn't as firm as cheesecake should be...more like mousse. I'm sure that many people would really like this cake, but I wanted chocolate cheesecake, and this is not really passable as chocolate cheesecake.

A wonderful cheesecake!  Everyone loved it!  Needs a bit more chocolate flavor but otherwise it's perfect.  I used 1/2 cup of Bailey's and it was just right for all of us.  Thanks for sharing the wonderful recipe!

I've made this cheesecake at least five times now, and it has never cracked!  Followed the recipe exactly, except increased Bailey's to 1/2 cup and used a water bath while baking.  I also leave it in the oven with the door closed up to 1 hour after it is done baking.  Because it's so dense, I slice it into really small pieces - it is a huge hit at my Christmas party each year!

Wonderful crumbly crust and the creamiest cheesecake.  The flavor was fantastic!  Don't change a thing if you are making this recipe!  Bake only until you have a little jiggle left in the middle of the cake, remove from oven and immediately run a sharp knife around the edge.  You should have no cracks  in this cake if you do this. No water bath was needed.

One of the best cheesecakes I've ever made. I used 1/2 cup Irish cream and 1 cup sour cream. When the cheesecake cooled I topped it with a chocolate glaze. It turned out very creamy. Will be making this one often.

Since I was looking for a Kahlua cheesecake recipe, I modified this one to reflect that.  I took the advice of adding more butter to crumb mixture (used 1/3 cup) and it was perfect, held it's shape.  Then I added 1/4 tsp vanilla and instead of 1/4 cup Irish Cream, put in 1/3 cup Kahlua (or other coffee flavored liqueur) and sprinkled about 1 more tablespoon of floor cause I thought it was a bit thin.  Turned out fantastic!  Couldn't do much about the cracking on top but decorated with chocolate whip cream rosettes and placed a chocolate covered coffee bean ontop.  Nummy!  Also quick note: take out of fridge approximately 20 minutes before serving, better taste.

This is hands down my favorite cheesecake!  It has a lovely creamy texture and the chocolate comes through more than the Irish liqueur.  It has been an absolute hit every time I've made it.

I have adapted it to be gluten-free (GF) by using GF chocolate cookies, using coconut flour, and either substituting heavy cream for the Irish cream or leaving it out altogether (that was an accident but it worked out well).

As other reviewers suggested, I froze the crust while I prepped the filling and I used a modified water bath (roasting pan filled with hot/boiling water).  I don't think it's cracked in the 2-3 times I've made it.

This recipe was AMAZING!!! I served it for St. Pattys Day and my picky family totally devoured it!  Thank you so much!  I did 1/2 C Irish Cream as per reviews, and did chocolate graham cracker crumbs.  I baked it as directed and when I turned the oven off and checked it it didn't wiggle at all so I was a little scared, but it turned out amazing!  I did get one tiny crack that I covered with home made Irish Cream Whipping Cream.... more amazing!!!! Did I say thank you... THANK YOU SO MUCH!

Ok, this turned out really awesome!!!!  Only two changes.  I used 1/2c of Baily's instead of the recommended 1/4c.  And since I was using a 10" spring form pan, I baked for only 50 minutes instead of an hour.  It turned out moist and rich and it was the rave of the luncheon at work.  Eat Your heart out Paula Deen!!!! hehe

Good consistency and recipe that went over well with guests, but I decided I prefer 'regular' cheesecake. I made as stated except used 1/3 cup of Bailey's Irish Cream.  I love my Bailey's, but I prefer it in on ice.

It's really wonderful cake! I added extra Bailey's and Polish vodka (I'm Polish) and it was very fluffy and had this little sharp taste from vodka! I recommend it!

Made for Thanksgiving and everyone loved this. I did increase the Irish Cream to 1/3 cup and used a large chocolate bar the I cut into large chunks to decorate the top. I put a pan of boiling water in the oven underneath the cheesecake and had no problems with cracking at all.

Fantastic! Works out every time and gets rave reviews. Took another reviewers advice and wrap the cake pan half way up with tinfoil, put in shallow  pan and pour in hot water half way up cake pan. Helps to keep the cake from cracking.

I followed all of Latina Cook's helpful advice and came out with a perfect cheesecake. I too upped the amount of Irish Cream to just over a third of a cup. Many thanks.

Great cheesecake - rich, dense and not overly sweet. I didn't have irish cream so I used chocolate liquor and added 2 tsp. of dissolved coffee powder. I would have liked a stronger chocolate flavor. I think next time I'll use more cocoa.

So good! Everybody loved it.  I doubled the Irish Cream (Ryan's Cream insted of Bailey's)and it was great.  I think 1/3 cup would have been perfect.  Can't wait to make it again.

I loved this cheesecake.  I made sure to put a pan of water in the oven while it baked, then left it in the oven an hour after it baked.  It was beautiful, and I didn't even garnish it before presentation.  I used 1/3 cup of irish cream, and I will use more next time, because I could barely taste the irish cream.  I thought this cheesecake tasted best two days after making it.  Who knows how good it'd taste on the third day - it didn't last that long!  :)  Angela

Best cheesecake ever. I usually make it before dinner and leave in the oven until it is needed. Also, it works great with 2 packeges 1/3 fat cream cheese and 1 regular. Great with amaretto or grand marnier.

I am not sure what went wrong, but I followed the directions correctly, and it turned out too creamy.  Not like a cheesecake (new york) but like a cheese pie.  And the flavor was off.  I read so many good reviews that I am wondering if it was my irish cream, or what, but my cheesecake turned out nothing like the reviews....

Excellent recipe!! And easy!  I too used 1/3 cup of irish cream & next time I may use 1/2 cup.  For the crust I used chocolate graham crackers with butter and no confectioners sugar.  I did not pre-bake the crust and when the cake was cool, I drizzled hot fudge over it.  Everyone thought I bought it.  They all loved it!!!!!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good. I wasn't the absolute biggest fan of it, but me and my family liked it a lot. My cousin and I made two of these: one to test it (and for ourselves) and one to take to a dinner party. The first one we made tasted great, but cracked terribly, even with the water bath. I think perhaps the cream cheese was still a bit too cold or something. The second one, everything was pretty much room temperature when we began. Unfortunately, we forgot the flour too, so I’m not entirely sure if it was the lack of flour or the lack of chill in the ingredients, but it didn’t crack nearly as bad the second time. We topped it off with some chocolate ganache drizzled on top and some whipped cream (with a healthy shot of Irish cream to keep with the theme). It got finished off at the party some quick and everyone really liked it. Some even came over the next day to have piece of the other one we saved for ourselves! Thanks for the tasty recipe, Elaine.

I took the advice from review #31..it turned out pretty well. I do have to say that neither flavor was very potent---I think I may try one or the other flavor next time. Good texture though!

So I made this cake for the bf and it was my first real cheesecake. Even though I don't care for cheesecake, the taste was very good and he loved it!. Also found out what a springform pan was AFTER I made the cake in a regular pie dish (oops) and will use one the next time I make this! The only problem I had with it was the top looking...overcooked? It formed a nice skin, but it was too dark around the edges. I don't know why that happened, but maybe it'll turn out different in a springform pan? We will see!

This cheesecake was wonderful. I am on a diet but had an intense urge to bake. I ended up bringing this to work for a St. Patty's Day treat and it was devoured within minutes. It looked very nice and held up well. I definitely would make this again and again.

I thought this was a very good Cheesecake.  It was the first one that I've ever made and it turned out really well.  I followed the baking instructions exactly, but baked it in a jelly roll pan that had water in it.  I put aluminum foil around the bottom of the spring form pan (and sprayed the inside with PAM).  After the hour was up, I turned off the oven and let it sit for an hour.  It didn't have a crack on it. My only complaint is that it didn't have enough Irish Cream flavor (and my guests agreed).  Next time I will add more Irish Cream. Other than that, great recipe!

I loved this recipe, and per the suggestion of other reviewers thought it was better with the addition of extra Bailey's (I used between 1/3 and 1/2 cups and thought it to be neither too strong, nor not stong enough--just perfect).  Everyone who tried it loved it!  My only complaint was that my crust kept removing from the bottom of the cheesecake while serving (I never had that happen before with a cheesecake).  I used ready made Oreo pie crusts that I'd crushed up for the "Chocolate Cookie crumbs", and I wonder if I wouldn't have had that problem if I'd actually crushed up real cookies (since they would've had the sticky vanilla filling).  Either way, I thought this was worth 5 stars and I know I'll make it again in the future. :)

This is an amazing recipe.  I took it to work and didn't have any leftovers.  The women in my office bake a lot and they recommended not baking the crust beforehand; the longer it bakes the harder the crust gets.    I followed the recipe except like others I used 1/2 cup of Irish cream.  I let the ingredients set out at room temperature before.  I also used low-fat cream cheese and sour cream; it had a really creamy consistency.    I topped it with chocolate fudge, and next time I think I will add chocolate chips.  One tip I do have is watch the baking time and the temperature.  You know how your oven works.  My oven runs hot, so I lowered the temperature by about 25 degrees when baking.

This came out absolutely delicious!  I used Pepperidge Farms Chocolate Chessmen for the crust, and I also added some crushed thin mints on top of the finished cake for garnish.  To bring out the minty side of things, I might add a touch of mint extract next time, but everything is great as is!

Delicious cheesecake! I've used this recipe a few times with Irish Cream, other times with another liqueur. I make a couple of adjustments for my own tastes.. I don't use cocoa powder, I add more liqueur (anywhere from 1/3cup to 1/2cup), and I add 1.5tsp of vanilla extract. The recipe is very forgiving so you can add/take away small amounts of things to fit your tastes. I get a creamy flavorful, delicious cheesecake with no cracks(using a water bath, and greasing the pan of course). After done baking, I shut the oven off and leave the cheesecake in the oven for a couple hours before actually removing it. Then chill overnight and decorate. So good!!!

This cheesecake is absolutely delicious!! It turned out perfectly for me. I left everything in the filling the same, maybe a little extra Irish cream may have slipped in ;), but for the crust I left out the icing sugar and the cocoa powder becaue I felt it didn't need it. Also when baking I wrapped the bottom of the cake tin in heavy duty tin foil twice and set it into a large roasting pan. Once I put the pan in the oven I poured hot water around it. Thses helps the cheesecake while baking to avoid any cracks on the top. Also when the cheesecake is done just turn off the oven and crack the oven door slightly and allow it to cool completely before removing the cake.

A very good cheesecake.  I substituted Creme De Cocoa for the Irish Creme with excellent results.

I used 1/2 c. Bailey's as others had suggested and I thought it was perfect.  I also baked it in a water bath and the texture was exactly what I was looking for - smooth but not mousse-like.  This was a winner and I will definitely make it again.

I served this at a dinner party to rave reviews. One guest said it was the best cheesecake he's ever had! Add some extra Bailey's. Note however that the chocolate and Bailey's flavors are very mild. Doesn't have the tang of a NY-style cheesecake, but incredibly smooth flavor and texture.

I made this at Christmas and it was FANTASTIC! I was a little worried because it had to share oven space with a turducken, and my sister's kitchen is not very well equipped for anything that doesn't come from the refridgerated dough section. In spite of all that, it was great. I put a pan of water in the oven and it didn't crack (heck, maybe the turducken helped). The only thing I changed was I put a LOT more irish cream in it. I used about a bottle and a half of the Bailey's minis.

I personally do not like flavored cheesecakes, but I decided to make it for St Patricks Day.  So even though I did not like it, the fact that the entire pie was reduced to a pile of crumbs w/in 2 hours makes me give this 5 stars.  Also, several people wanted the recipe, so that also tells me that it was good.  So if you like chocolate cheesecake, I believe this is a good one.  By the way, I also used 1/3 c baileys like other reviewers.

This is only the 2nd cheesecake I've ever made and couldn't have turned out better.  I used the suggested 1/3 Irish Creme and a water bath.

I'm not even a huge fan of chocolate (but love Bailey's) but this was a huge success. Rich but good! I still need much practice at making cheesecakes as it cracked in a few places...but since I'm so new to this cheesecake thing, I'm very forgiving of that minor fault. Besides, the taste was wonderful! Will make this again!

I did this once according to the recipe and I kind of missed the sourness of a cheesecake. so the second time I made it I divided the mixture in two and added the cocoa only to half of the mixture. I poured the chocolate first and the white later and baked according to the recipe. also I substituted the sour cream for Greek yogurt For me this has to be the best combination!

It tasted great but I would recommend not cooking the crust first. When I followed the recipe exactly the crust stuck to the bottom and came off the cake.

Made this yesterday, actually my first cheesecake. It was delicious,  everyone loved it. I used a non stick springform pan, did not grease or flour, and it came out perfectly. For the waterbath, I put a pan of water on the n rack below the cheesecake and that worked..no cracks.  Upped the Irish Creme to 1/2 cup as many suggested. Bon appetite! !

Creamy and delicious, if you like Irish Cream liqueur, you’ll enjoy this recipe.  I used ½ cup of the Irish cream liqueur.  Instead of a water bath, I lined the sides and bottom of the springform pan with parchment paper.  After the recommended baking time, I cracked the oven door and let the cheesecake remain in the oven until room temperature.  The results were a smooth and creamy cheesecake with no cracks.  Perfect.

The family raved about this when I made it for a picnic.  Personally I would have given it 4 stars as the irish cream taste wore off after a couple bites, but the response from everyone made me rank a 5.  I used crushed oreos in the crust & low fat cream cheese - otherwise I followed everything.  I put water under the cheesecake in the oven and left it in overnight after I turned the oven off just before bed - NO CRACKS!

Wonderful wonderful!  I'm a big fan of cheesecake--always have been--and this is by far my favorite recipe thus far.  I cheat and use a premade chocolate pie crust and end up with two cheesecakes.  I'm not that concerned about cracking, as I generally cover that up with a bit of whipped cream and chocolate chips.  Big hit at home and at work.  Even my boyfriend who doesn't like sweets very much enjoys this cheesecake.

Made this for St Patrick's Day and it was a hit! Great texture and the size is perfect to feed a whole family and have some left over. I myself found it to be a little more bitter than I would prefer. Not sure how I could adjust that. But overall a great holiday treat.

This is a wonderfully rich, well-balanced cheesecake.  I made exactly as written and thought it was perfect.  My "chocolate cookie crumbs" were oreos.  No adjustments needed.  I did use the water bath and had no cracks.  Topped with homemade whipped cream.  Not too heavy, not too fluffy  Juuuuust right!

Very good! Very easy..I used hersheys special dark cocoa and it was very chocolately, just perfect. I also doubled the ingredients for the crust as I prefer a slightly thicker crust and I used chocolate graham cracker crumbs. I also doubled the amount of irish cream per most of the reviews. excellent served alongside fresh fruit.

Great taste. Easy to prepare. Just a long process, but not gruesome. I had to bake it for additional 30 min. The middle seemed uncooked at stated time and tested with toothpick after each additional 10 min. It was impressive with homemade whipping cream and choc chips on top.

Great recipe! I just finished baking this. Although I didn't have a pan big enough for a water bath with my springform pan, I simply filled up another pan and put it on the rack underneath. Didn't have a single crack! UNTIL I did the part with using a knife to loosen the edges. This was my first ever attempt at making a cheesecake. Then I later found that my cheesecake shrunk so the small crack could have been avoided! Other than that, perfect! But, DON'T USE A KNIFE TO LOOSEN THE EDGES!

It was delicious in every way.  But mine cracked right down the middle.  It didn't really matter though, my family and friends ate the whole thing within hours.  They said it was addicting.

Made this for Saint Patricks Day and everyone loved it. I followed other advice and made it with 1/2 cup of Bailey's (if you really enjoy the Bailey's flavor.) I also buttered and floured the pan, and yes, the cake still cracked. I also added the ingredients in at room temperature, per someone else's advice. My assumption is a waterbath is your best bet for non-cracking.  Serve with whip cream. mmmm.

I was looking for a unique dessert for St. Patrick's Day last year.  I searched the web and found this one.  It is not difficult to make but delicious. The cheesecake filling is so creamy yet not too chocolatey, and the Bailey gives it a traditional touch. Guests will ooh and aah when they try this!

Made this for Christmas.  Delicious.  Added 1/2 c of homemade Irish Cream instead of 1/4 c.  Besides that, kept recipe as is.  Very rich and yummy.

I added a lot of extra cocoa powder to up the chocolate taste and it still wasn't super strong. This is a nice cheesecake but I really disliked the Bailey's flavor. To be fair, folks at my office loved it and someone actually ate three slices! I myself found the Bailey's distracting and not pleasant even though I love it in mixed drinks. But a good recipe over all, I might try it again without Bailey's.

This recipe is really rich!  I took the other suggestions and added 1/3 c of Irish Cream.  But my favorite part of this recipe is the crust!  Everyone was so impressed by the flavor from the crust that I now use this crust recipe anytime a cheesecake calls for a chocolate cookie crumb crust.

I give this five stars, although I did not prevent the cake from cracking. I placed a pan of water in the oven under the cake. The next time I may place the pan directly into a bath.  The cake was better than bakery quality and I did increase the Irish Cream.  I would serve with whip cream or cool whip. A winner!

This was the first cheesecake I had ever attempted and I followed the recipe to the letter as far as I understood it and the only thing that I did different was a touch more Baileys and let it sit in the oven with the door closed for one hour after it was done baking. I have made at least 5 more since for parties and such and none cracked with this method. I did try to use good quality ingredients in every part and for me each cake seemed to taste better than the last.

This was very good, perfect consistency. I used a waterbath (no cracks), and left it in the oven until it was cool, then refrigerated overnite. My center was still a little bit wet, that's why only 4 stars, so next time I'll let it cook 20 minutes at 450. Because of that, my center got a little bit messy when I sliced it up, but I stuck a sprig of mint and some nasturtiums in the center (how clever am I folks?)and it was beautiful. Tip: you want to be sure to sift the cocoa powder and powdered sugar 'cause lumps will SHOW, and I used 1/2 cup booze.

I just made this for a St Patricks Day party but instead of mixed the Irish Cream and Chocolate i seperated the batter into two equal parts and then swirled. You can really get a taste of both flavorings and it came out great!

One of the best cheesecakes I've ever eaten, much less made myself! Crust came out a bit dry and crumbly, so I will add more butter next time. Also increased the Irish Cream to 1/2 c like other reviewers suggested.

My co-workers and I LOVED this! It does have a texture similar to mousse, and we liked that about it. I made my own topping with heavy whipping cream and sugar, then added some vanilla. I started to add some irish cream to the topping, then thought better of it - I'm a teacher at an elementary school, and I didn't think it would be wise to add uncooked alcohol to the cheesecake (even in the smallest amount). The topping didn't need it, though - it was EXCELLENT! I also doubled the irish cream in the cheesecake itself. Fabulous!

This recipe was fabulous!  My guests loved it.  I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and light sour cream and it was great.  Cheesecakes have a tendancy to crack, but you can turn off the oven about 5 minutes before it's done, and crack open the door (while leaving the cheesecake in) and it will help prevent those settling cracks.  Mine didn't crack at all when I did this and the cheesecake was very moist.  I will definately make this again!!!

If you like a creamy cake, bake your cheesecake in a water bath.  I double wrap the springform pan in foil and set in a bigger pan, fill half way up the side with hot water.  Bake for 55 minutes then turn off the oven and leave for one hour. Perfect cake, creamy without cracks!!

Recipe is great! I noticed a few posts have been made to where the cake actually cracked. I went about removing the yolk from two of the eggs, and added a little powdered sugar to the batch itself, maybe about a tablespoon; I figured the cornstarch in the powdered sugar will help the eggs from over coagulating, basically preventing cracks. Cornstarch itself can also be used. I also added a bout 1/3 cup of heavy cream creating a little lighter creamier cake. Give the pan a little jiggle before putting it in the oven and tap the sides to get some of the air bubbles out as well. I baked the cake in a water bath to the given temperature and time given in the directions. And after the hour of baking opened the oven door for a couple of minutes and then shut it and left the cake in the oven for another hour. I refrigerated the cake for a good 8 hrs or so and it turned out wonderful! :) I was a pleasure to make this cake and will definitely make it again.

This was an okay cheesecake.  There's another irish cream recipe on this site, Sensational Irish Cream Cheesecake that we think is much better.  This just tasted like a chocolate cheesecake, even after increasing the Baileys to 1/3 cup.

Excellent cheesecake and so easy!  My first cheesecake and the friends I served it to loved it.  I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust instead of chocolate cookies.  As another reviewer recommended I left it in the oven for eight hours after it had cooked for the required hour and it didn't crack at all.  I didn't even use a water bath.  So easy!

This recipe is a bit heavy, it is not the best cheesecake I have ever made. Make sure that you cool down while in oven or it will crack, if it does just crush more chocolate wafers over top.

First time I baked a cheesecake from scratch. Substituted Kahlúa for the Irish Cream (not a fan of Irish Cream. Baked well, cracked on top, which I don't mind. (I'm going to eat it, not enter it in a beauty contest.)  Tastes wonderful!

My son asked me to make this as his birthday cake this year. I only made the one adjustment that was suggested by other reviewers and that was to add 1/2 cup of irish cream. This was the most AMAZING cheesecake! It was creamy and moist and delicious! I didn't use a water bath but I DID put a pan of water in the oven as it preheated so it was already a moist environment. After baking I left it in the oven with the door open for two hours and there was not a single crack! I will definitely make it again!

Excellent! I took the advice of one of the reviewers and did a steam bath (as opposed to a water bath) and it looked beautiful. It was a little underdone in the middle so I'll give it an extra 5 min next time - don't know if that was because of the steam bath. Will definitely make again!

This cheesecake was a hit last night with our guests on St. Pattie's Day.  I followed some of the tips recommended by reviewers and used granulated sugar instead of icing sugar.  The only icing sugar I used was to decorate the top.  I also floured the pan and cooked it with a pan of hot water underneath.  As you can see from the 'shamrock' pic, there was only one slight crack.  This is a 10.

This is not a cheesecake.  It is a mousse.  I added more Irish Cream as was suggested, and this desert was absolutely tastless except for the crust.  It didn't taste bad.  It just didn't have any taste.

I made this cheesecake for my husband for Christmas.  He is a diehard Bailey's lover and we thoroughly enjoyed this cake.  It was so rich we had to give some away to the neighbours as we never would have eaten it all by ourselves.  Our neighbours called to see if we had more!  Awesome.

My husband is the official cheesecake baker in our house, so when we planned an Irish themed dinner party with another couple, I asked him to make this for dessert. It came out fantastic! He always uses a wet bath and it came out just right. We've had several people ask us for the recipe.

Made this with a for a dinner I prepared for my family and my Mother.  I had never made a cheese cake and found this very easy.  We loved it.  My mother and I enjoyed it with a chocolate Martini.  What a great way to end the evening. I'll be keeping this in my box for those special occasions.

A little difficult to make. I usually change little things here and there about recipes I try, but I was afraid to deviate too much with this one. 

Preparation was very time consuming. I think either the crust or filling was too much. The filling almost overflowed and then I had to throw a little out. My oven gets very hot, so I always lower the temperature by 25 degrees, but other than that, I cooked this exactly how the recipe said, and the cheesecake got a little too done and was much tougher than I cared for. 

I might try this recipe again, but only if I feel like being lazy and buying premade crust and filling and just adding the cocoa powder and irish cream. I would not want to spend the amount of time that I did on this recipe again. Everyone really loved the cheesecake, and it did taste really good, but was not quite worth the time I put into it.

This turned out well. I cannot honestly say I loved it, though. I felt like it needed less Bailey's, and more chocolate flavoring. All the same, I guarantee you not a single piece will go to waste, so it IS a tasty recipe. Mine did crack before the end of the cooking time; the recipe did not specify to grease the pan in any fashion but I went ahead and PAM'd my springform pan. This is a standard cooked cheesecake so I do recommend that you look up tips & tricks for how to avoid cracked cheesecakes if you're serving it for company :) Unlike the no-bake kind, this kind will crack very easily!

I have not made this exact recipe, but I have one similar to this that I have made for years, and the main differences are the recipe I use has more Irish Cream and instead of the cocoa powder, you mix an amount of the cheesecake "batter" with melted chocolate chips, then swirl that into the rest of the pan before baking. Another variation I have used a few times is white chocolate, and added a bit of green food coloring to swirled in amount. Every time I've made this cheesecake, it disappears and I never have left overs to take home! You really should read all the tips (and reviews) on a good cheesecake if you haven't made them before. Greasing the pan, using a waterbath, and cooling it slowly are very important, but I would certainly say give it a try! It's worth it. Thanks for posting this recipe!

This cheesecake came out practically perfect. I'm not sure what the big deal is about cracks...I followed the directions in the recipe and there were no cracks at all!  It came out very smooth and creamy. The only problem was with the crust, which mostly crumbled on contact. Maybe my measuring was off. I followed the advice of one reviewer and upped the irish cream to 1/2 cup and it was way too overpowering (and I am a big fan of irish cream). I would stick to either 1/4 cup or 1/3. Otherwise, great recipe, will make again.

This was pretty good.  I made it without the coco powder because I had a brownie crust and I didn't want it to be too chocolaty. I made 2/3 of the recipes and used 4 tablespoons of baileys in it.  I thought it had plenty of baileys flavor, and I am glad I didn't add any more.  It didn't crack at all, but I did put a pan of boiling water in the oven as well.

This was the best Irish Cream cheesecake I've had.  Easy to make, excellent taste.  I didn't have a springform pan but put into two pie plates instead.  Reduced baking time by 10 minutes and everything turned out fantastic!

delicious! I floured the sides (from another suggestion) to prevent cracking, it still did. I used 1/2 C Baileys-perfect amount. Since it cracked I topped w/coolwhip & crushed girl scout thin mint cookies....so good!

Simply astounding! I also get amazing compliments whenever I take this to a party.   As is, it's a bit too much chocolate for me, so I use regular cookie crumbs for the crust. I also tend to use more Bailey's - it hasn't hurt things yet!

I make this every year for my annual St. Patrick's Day Dinner.  It is always a hit.  I didn't make it one year (wanted to try something different), and one of my friends complained that they wouldn't come again unless I served the Bailey's Cheesecakes!  My younger sister was most excited when she turned 21--not to go out to the bars, but so she could buy Bailey's Irish Cream and make these herself!  I serve them in individual mini pie tins (about 6), and bake them in a water bath to prevent cracking.  Turns out perfect every time!

I prepared this exactly as stated in the recipe. I found the cooking time of 10 minutes at 450 caused the sides to burn, giving a bitter, burnt taste to the last couple bites of an otherwise wonderful cheesecake. I will make another one in the morning for my dinner party. I just realized I used too big of a pan. Maybe that had something to do with it. I've been known to have "user error". Thanks for a good recipe. Let's see if I can get it right this time. Will let you know. :)

Super easy and yummy.  I, like others, added 1/2 cup of Bailey's.  I used oreos for the crust and then followed everything else to the letter.  I found that my cheesecake cracked big time too.  But it's not really that big a deal to me.  Thanks for the recipe.  Everyone loved it.

Great recipe! I have made many different cheesecakes and this one is definitely one of my favorites. I do, though, add a total of 1/2cup of Bailey's for a little extra kick.

YUUUMMMMMM!  Very dense and rich.
I used 1/2 c of Baileys in the batter, and instead of a water bath, placed a roasting pan 1/2 full of boiling water on the rack below the cake.  Gave it an extra 15 minutes baking time, and left it in the oven overnight after baking until cool.  (Greased and floured the pan before baking.)  No cracks.  perfect cheesecake.  Great recipe!

This was a very popular item at our St. Patrick's Day party...absolutely yummy! The irish cream flavor was very light and not too overpowering. Thank you for sharing this recipe! I'm sure it would be delicious with other types of liqeuers or alcohol as well.

I have made this cheese cake MANY times, what i like to do in order to make sure that there is a nice Irish Cream flavor is I dont add choco powder to the batter..... the basic recipie for the batter is perfect you can add ANYTHING to it to make is any flavor you want!!!!! 

but to keep it from craking I do the first baking for 15min not 10 @ 5 degrees warmer, then i bake 5-10mins less at time given. i have yet to have any troubles with it that way.

This recipe is AWESOME!  I bake it as directed but use a water bath to prevent browning and cracking.  Wrap the bottom of the springform pan in foil prior to baking the crust and place in a water bath when you add the batter.  The result is a smooth, shiny top that is ideal for decorating or leaving it plain- no need for topping to hide any cracks.  This is ideal since the flavor of the cheesecake needs no improvements and is fantastic all by itself!

Not enough Irish cream flavor. Plus, it developed a HUGE crack in the center. Probably won't use this recipe again.

this is quite possibly one of the best cheesecakes that I have ever tasted.  I put some whipped cream on top which made it even better!

I had never made a cheesecake in my life - I was so surprised by the ease of baking this one.  The family and friends just went crazy over this-will need to make 2 the next time.  I had a problem with the cracking too, so next time I'll do the water bath, grease & flour, let it sit in the oven with the door cracked open to cool.  (obviously I just now read the other reviews!)  I also used extra butter in the crust portion..it just felt too crumbly to hold together without it.
I'll make this one again, and again, and again, and again............

i was worried while making this cheesecake that it was going to be too creamy and soft, but it really ended up with a nice texture. tasted really good, but i couldn't taste the irish cream even though i added more than the recipe called for.

This cheesecake was absolutely wonderful.    The taste and texture was great... very smooth, creamy, and delicious.  It's also nice how easy the recipe is!  I increased the Irish cream to 1/2 cup and used gourmet sweetened cocoa.  I liked it with the additional Irish cream, but it may be a bit strong for those who dislike a liqueur taste... it will obviously depend on your personal preference.  I placed a shallow dish of water into the oven on the rack beneath my cheesecake while preheating and left it there while baking.  The cake turned out beautifully and did not have a single crack.  Thanks for such a great recipe.

I absolutely love this recipe.  I used 1/2 cup Irish Cream liquor and I put a dish of water on the shelf under the cheesecake to keep the oven moist.  The cake did not crack and it was so amazing.  I served it with the "Raspberry Topping" (also from allrecipes).  My guests went back for seconds and thirds.  I can't say enough good things about this cheesecake.  I will make it again and again.  Thanks.

Love it, love it, love it! Very rich and smooth.  Mine didn't crack, had perfect texture and just the right amount of Irish. I chose not to alter the ingredients, but I did put a shallow cake pan with about 3 inches of water in the oven before preheating. This adds moisture to the oven, preventing cracks. This technique always works for me.  I also bring the eggs to room temperature. This cheesecake is a new favorite. My coworkers, family and friends have all asked for more. I recommend fresh whipped cream as a garnish.

After reading of other reviewers' comments, I assumed I had to be very careful in the baking of this cheesecake. Hence, I filled a shallow baking dish with water and placed it on the lower rack of my oven while the cake was baking. I also doubled the amount of Irish Cream called for in the original recipe. The result was a perfect looking recipe, smooth, almost like an Irish Cream mousse. Its taste and texture make it extremely delicate, maybe a bit too much to be baked on a regular basis (it has to be reserved for special occasions).

The flavor didn't turn out quite how I anticipated, but this was the first cheesecake I ever made and it turned out decent.  Very rich! I also increased the Bailey's to 1/2 cup and used oreo cookie crumbs for the crust.

This was so yummy! It is very, very rich.  I used chocolate graham crackers instead of the chocolate cookies and served it with sweetened whipped cream with Bailey's in it.  Was a huge hit at Christmas dinner!

THis is incredibly rich - Id definatly serve with some whip cream. My husband loved it. I used a Oreo cookie pie crust instead of a spring form pan, and with the extra filling, I grabbed two custard cups, layered the bottom with oreo's and added the left over filling  -put some water in a casserole pan with the cups inside (water bath) and baked it with the pie. Came out perfect. Husband ate BOTH cups after dinner  ;) Thanks for sharing.

Awesome recipe!  I made it for Thanksgiving and there wasn't any leftover!  What a great crowd pleaser.  This cake is rich and just perfect for chocolate and cheesecake lovers.  I added 1/2 cup of Bailey's Irish Cream instead of 1/4 cup.  It made it even better.  Make this cheesecake and everyone will want your recipe.

If you love chocolate, this is the recipe for you!!  It turned out with great texture, not too heavy.  Had an awesome flavor.  Cooked it in a water bath, then let it sit in the oven 2 hrs. before removing.  Looked beautiful.  My only suggestion would be more Bailey's to be able to taste the Irish cream better.  Will definately make again!!!

I tried a variation with 1/3 C Kahlua. We could not taste the Kahlua flavor but the chocolate flavor was intense. I bake it for an extra 10 mins until only 2-3 inch area of center was wobbly. Used mocha beans on top edge and chocolate shavings in the middle for decorations.

My first cheesecake (actually my first ever non-mix cake!) and it was awesome. So incredibly easy to make. I used Chocolate Vanilla Wafers for the crust. Used mini chocolate chips for a garnish. This is not a really dense high cheesecake. It's lighter, which I prefer. Great recipe to make to impress company!

Terrific recipe!  It was hard to keep it intact until our dinner guests arrived.  Everyone enjoyed it!
I mixed the filling in my food processor with great success.  It was really quick & easy to put this delicious treat together.

Scaled it to 16 servings, added over 1/2 cup Irish Cream and baked in a 10 inch springform pan close to 1.5 hours. Turned out delicious!!! Everyone who tried it was impressed.

This was the second cheesecake I ever made and it turned out perfect. I love this recipe. I used Kahlua instead of Bailey's and got the most wonderful flavor combination. I have out of town guests coming in next weekend and this is the dessert I will serve. What a wonderful chessecake and a great holiday party dessert!

This cake was fabulous. I followed the recipe until I got to the chocolate drizzle whcih requires me to buy 8 ozs of semi sweet chocolate. Instead I bought a container of ready made dark chocolate icing which I used to ice the sides of the cake, saving some to which I added a little milk until it was drizzel consistency. Then I drizzeled it over the top white icing. The flavour was a big hit.

This rating is only for the filling.   Delicious!  Beautiful color, like a chocolate mousse but firm as a baked cheesecake should be and delicately flavored.  I didn't have any cookies so I used a honey Graham crust.  It was fine, though a chocolate crust would've been prettier.  I've never had an issue with cheesecakes cracking because I use a bain-marie while baking, then when it's done I leave it in the oven for a few hours to cool.

Absolutely loved this recipe.  I changed a few things.  Instead of using chocolate cookies I used Girl Scout Thin mint cookies along with 1/4 cup of white sugar.  I also increased the baileys to 2/3 cup. I made sure all ingredients were at room temp and I greased and floured my pan.  I place a bundt pan full of water under the rack from the cheesecake and not one crack.  I topped the cheesecake with a chocolate ganache flavored with the bailey's.

Because my oven has a convection that runs the fan even when you are not cooking convection, I cooked the first 10 minutes at 425F rather than 450F. I baked the cake in a glass bottom springform pan, from Germany. The springform pan was placed in a cheesecake moat. The cheesecake moat is a pan within a pan. That allows the springform to be sour rounded by water without touching the water. After baking I left it in the oven four hours. I am very pleased with the results. (Also used a 1/2 cup of Bailey's)

Great recipe!!! I doubled the crust like someone else suggested. I also made a whiskey ganache and topped the cheesecake with it! Delicious

Delicious! I was worried I wouldn't like it because it wouldn't be too chocolatey, but the balance of chocolate and Irish Cream was perfect. I followed the recipe and oven time/temperature precisely and it turned out perfect.

I've made this a few times now and I always get so many compliments on how good the cheesecake looks and tastes!!! I like to use the dark chocolate wafer cookies for the crust but resorted to using two Oreo readymade crusts. I simply crushed them and pressed them to the bottom of my springform pan.I didn't add any other ingredients for the crust. Used 1/2 cup Irish cream and instead of doing a water bath, I put a pan of water on the shelf beneath the cheesecake! No cracks! The trick is to let the cake cool in the oven for a few hours (no peeking in!) The slower it cools, the less chance for cracks plus the sides will not stick either!

This is the second time I've made this.  It came out perfectly.  I used a non stick spring form pan, sprayed it well and put parchment on the bottom. wrapped the bottom in foil and used a water bath.  This seems like a loot of work but it really makes a difference. No cracks!.  The ONLY change to the recipe at all is it took 1 1/2 hours at 250, after the initial 450.  be patient, dont open the oven.

This cheesecake it perfect! I melted mint chocolate candies and swirled them on the top of this cheesecake before baking and instead of using the regular Oreos i used Mint Oreos. Perfect cheese cake for St. Patricks Day! Will definantly make again.

KILLER cheesecake! This has an amazing, unique flavor and was the perfect touch to bring to a St. Patty's day party. I used 1/2 cup of Irish cream instead of 1/4, and came out with a flawless, crack-free cake. That was the perfect amount to absorb the flour and add the cream flavor.

I can't wait to make this again!  My hubby dislikes dessert and had two pieces.  I did increase the Irish cream to a 1/2 cup for flavor and it was perfect.  It's a very moist cheesecake.  I served with Irish cream infused whipped cream.

I tried this recipe last week. I didn't follow the crust recipe , as I forgot to buy confectioner suger...For the cake mixture I also added 30 g sugar less , as my friends don't like very sweet dessert. Also, I added the flour mixture at last, but not when the sugar creamcheese mixture was done, as I was afraid that the cake would got hard if i blended in the eggs and sour cream for too long. ( I don't have kitchenaid, so i gotta do the blending manually) It tastes really good. Just that i got some little lumps in my cake. It actually quite obvious as the color of the cake is abit brown.anyone know how to avoid that? I don't have kitchenaid, maybe that's why it's easier to get lump ??

I adjusted this to 8 servings and made it in a mini cheesecake pan, halved the flour, and doubled the Irish cream. It was so rich and so good!!  Now I just wish I had another excuse to make it!

I made this for people at work.  I thought you could add more irish cream liqueur but people I worked with said they could taste it.  A co-worker has a recipe that doesn't use the cocoa but mini chocolate chips.

After reading reviews I used a 1/2 cup of baileys irish cream and I also used a roasting pan with boiling water underneath of the springform pan while baking.  Worked like a charm....not one crack.  Really pretty cheesecake but the recipe is labor intensive.

this cheesecake was wonderful. I altered it a little as I felt some ingredients were unneccessary. I used oreos and butter, no sugar and no cocoa in the crust. In the cheesecake I ran out of sour cream so I used 1/4 c sour cream and 1/4 c plain yogurt. I used only 1 c sugar. I doubled the cocoa and doubled the irish cream (YUM!). As other people suggested, I only put in 1T flour. Oh and another thing is I used the fat-free cream cheese. All my alterations were perfect in looks and tastes. The presentation was pretty. I did have a slight crack on the top but thats because I forgot the water bath until half way into it. It was a pretty crack though LOL. Will make again.

This cheesecake was amazing.  I took advice from other reviewers and upped the irish cream to 1/2 cup.  It was just enough.  You could taste it without it being overwhelming.  The chocolate was also great...not too dark, just enough.  Although I bake a lot, I don't make cheesecake often.  This came out well, just one little crack.  I did do pans of water in the oven as opposed to a water bath (I was afraid of it seeping into my cheesecake) and I used ingredients all at room temp.  I would definitely make this again...everyone really loved it.

This was a really good cheesecake. However, it is very very rich. It had far more chocolate flavor than the irish cream. The bailey's got lost in the all the chocolate...but it is still yummy!

I actually used this recipe to make mini cheesecakes for a party. I followed reviewers' advice and used a 1/2 cup of Irish cream in the batter - yum! Then I used chocolate graham crackers, a bit of sugar and melted butter for the crust, and pressed it into the bottom of muffin pans. I did prebake them and let them cool before pouring on the batter. I baked them at 300 for around 30 minutes (turning on the oven light to check them), then left them in the cooling oven for another 20 minutes. For a topping, I made chocolate whipped cream.   If I make this again, I'd probably try to get more chocolate in there, either with a ganache topping or more cocoa in the batter. Still, it was very yummy as is!

YUM ! Big hit with my family. As mentioned in other comments, mine cracked a bit.Without going to the trouble of using suggested baking tips to avoid cracks, I just baked it and hid any flaws with chocolate whipped cream. Very tastey - will make again.

Made this for work the other day.  Being that it was the first cheese cake I have ever made I know know it may be the last receipie I will ever use.  It was turned out freaking awsome.  I used chocolate gramcracker crust and added fresh whipping cream and crushed gramcrackers on top as well.  Eveyone said it looking like i bought it at a bakery instead of making it myself.  I think i might try it next with out the irish cream plan gramcrackers and fresh strawberrys next....

Great cheesecake! I made this for an  Easter dinner and it was well received. Followed the recipe to the T and the Irish Cream flavor was perfect. No cracks or bubbles in my cake; reading the allrecipes articles about cheesecakes taught me a lot of good tips before I started.

I made this to take to my boyfriend’s family on Christmas, his dad requested a cheesecake. It was great! Very rich and had lot's of flavor. The only changes I made were to omit the sour cream and compensate by adding an additional 3 oz of cream cheese and a couple Tbsps of Irish cream. All in all a good cake and a very yummy combination.

This is one of my most requested things to bring to potlucks.  This makes a beautiful and delicious cheesecake.  I have substitutes Irish Creme coffee flavoring for the Irish Creme and it works just as well.  Sprinkle green cookie decorating sugar on top for a great St. Pat's day dessert.

This is 5+ stars this is the best. My husband loves cheesecake factory and said this was better. I have never been big on cheesecake but this was awesome. I followed all the directions with the foil wrap and water bath and not a crack. I did not leave it overnight for the fact I do not believe it is safe to leave cheese out overnite, let it in oven (turned off) for about 4 hours then refig.... easy and great!!!!

This was the best cheesecake I have ever made.  The only alteration I made was using 2 eggs rather than 3 to make the cake less rich.  In the future, I swill add more Baileys as I could hardly taste it.

I made this last weekend. There was some cracking, but I covered it by making a chocolate glaze and drizzling it over the top (unsweetened Baker's chocolate, butter, sugar & milk). It made the cake more chocolate tasting, but it was fabulous. I also upped the Irish cream as recommended to 1/3 c.

Delicious!  I appreciated the advice to add more Irish Cream as I know it's not a strong flavour to come through the chocolate, but thought 1/2 c was a lot of my Baileys to use ... so I added 2T of Irish whiskey instead.  It's flavour is stronger but was not overpowering.  I'll make this again!

This cheesecake was so incredible.  My husband and I made it for my birthday and shared it with neighbors.  We served it with raspberries and a little chocolate sauce.  Everyone loved it - no one left a crumb on their plate.  It did crack a little on top, but we should have watched it more closely and taken it out a few minutes earlier.  Still it didn't matter.  It was still delicious!  We will definitely make this again for another special occasion.

Very, very rich.  Take to large gathering because it is hard to resist any leftovers in the refridgerator.  I served with a raspberry dessert wine drizzled over the top.  Very easy and loved it just like it was.

This cake is awesome! Made it for my new girlfriend and she was wowed... took the leftovers to work, and they were wowed too :) It is extremely rich... but that's kind of a given with cheesecake. I used the European butter (Plugra) for an even richer flavour. Be sure to do the water bath... it does make a difference :)

i've made this cheesecake twice for school events, and everyone raves about it. i did have some cracks on the top (despite using a water bath on the rack below), but covered the top with a layer of chocolate cookie crumbs, and no one noticed it- i definetely did not bring any home with me!

I made a couple changes: first of all I substituted the irish creme with vanilla syrup and added about a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a teaspoon of almond extract.  I mixed all the ingredients except for the cocoa powder, divided the batter, added half the amount of cocoa to one of the batter and then poured that in the pan and poured the vanilla over it to make a layered cake.  Hubby loved the vanilla layer but thought the chocolate was so-so, as to where I loved them both.  I think next time I will cut the flour though to make it a little creamier.

Good recipe, thank you.  I used graham crackers instead of cookies and extra butter to achieve the right consistency for the crust.  My cheesecake cracked but it was my secret with a simple chocolate ganache on top and fresh strawberries.  The consistency and flavor were great, I made it ahead one day and was glad I did.  I will try this one again.

This was a wonderful recipe!  I had to do a presentation in my Cultural Cuisines class for college and this is one of the recipes I made to go along with my presentation on Ireland.  It was a huge hit with the class and professor.  Will definately make again!  Would still be an excellent recipe with the Irish Cream left out if some prefer.

Creamy texture, wonderful taste. No crack, but I did bake it in a water bath, after wrapping my springform pan in foil. Then I left it in the oven an extra hour after I turned the oven off. If you're wanting an unmistakable Irish Cream taste, you should increase the liqueur; I made the recipe "as is" and the Irish cream is not even noticeable--my son (who hates a liqueur taste) didn't even notice it.  Everyone loved it!

This turned out rather well. I thought the liquor flavor was a bit strong. It IS an aquired taste, and this isn't a good desert to make for kids or young adults for the most part.

Fantastic!  I used chocolate graham cracker crumbs for the crust.  I've baked this twice; once in a water bath and once without.  The water bath makes the cake much creamier and all but eliminates cracking.

Great recipe - rave reviews by my family.  I used 1/2 cup of irish cream and chocolate graham cracker crumbs instead.  I used a water bath and left the cake in the oven (with the door partially open) for about an hour after turning the oven off.  No cracking at all.  The crust was a little soggy from the water bath, but hardened in the fridge overnight.  I topped with a thin layer of irish cream-flavored whipped topping (whipping cream, sugar and bailey's) and some semi-sweet chocolate shavings.  The whipped topping was a nice offset - the cake is very rich.

Excellent recipe!  My only complaint was that when I baked it in another pan of water, my crust got soggy!  Perhaps I need a new pan?  The cheesecake was great though & no cracks... Oh, I almost forgot - I did increase the irish cream to 1/2 cup and it was not too much.

Quite good - and my cheesecake sustained not one crack!   : )   The irish cream flavor was just right at 1/3 cup.  The cake's texture was fairly good, but could have been a bit creamier - I think 3 T. of flour is excessive for a cheesecake; I'd scale  back to 1 T. next time.  A water bath might also aid creaminess. I garnished the cake with a border of sweetened whipped cream and it was a great flavor complement to the irish cream flavor.  Some good bittersweet chocolate shavings or melted chocolate drizzled on top would be great as well.

I wish I could rate this higher than 5 stars. I made it for a friend at work and everyone was raving. I did double the Irish Cream to 1/2 cup and the cake did crack, but the taste was better than any I have ever had (much less made!!)... it was fantastic. Thank you!!

Fantastic flavour.  I omitted the Irish Cream because I didn't want to buy a whole bottle but substituted melted caramels and pecans on top of the crust to make a turtle cheesecake and it was a hit!  Very rich as cheesecake should be.  Thanks

This recipe just did not work for me.  Perhaps because of the substitutions?  I used graham cracker crumbs instead  of chocolate cookie crumbs and used hazelnut liqueur instead of Irish cream liqueur.  The cake cracked *big time*, the taste of the cake was unremarkable, and the crumb crust tasted burnt and crumbled apart at the slightest touch.  I've had better results with other cheesecake recipes.

I was given the assignment to make a cheesecake for Thanksgiving Dinner, so I decided to try something different.  I found this recipe and first decided to try it out on my co-workers.  They loved it!  Since it got such rave reviews, I decided to go ahead and make it for the dinner.  I did, however, change the recipe to call for 1/2 cup Irish Cream.  My family thought the cake was absolutely wonderful!  I will definitely be using this recipe in the future.

I made this for a my husbands work Christmas potluck and everyone loved it.  I didn't think it had a classic cheesecake texture but the taste was terrific.  I added 1/2 cup Irish cream and it wasn't overpowering.  My cake cracked so I just spread a layer of whipped cream and some cookie crumbs on the top and it actually looked store bought.

I followed the advise of a few other reviews and added 1/2 cup of Irish Cream.  I didn't have to bake it as long as the recipe said (good thing I was paying attention). It turned out fabulous! Not too rich, but rich enough to enjoy the whole slice with a smile. Wonderful recipe and I will definitely make this one again!

I don't like cheesecakes, so I didn't have a piece, but everyone else loved it!  I used a whole sleeve of chocolate graham crackers for the crust.  Thanks for the recipe!

Two words to describe this recipe:  Super gourmet!  I used crumbled chocolate nilla wafers for the base.  Very yummy!

This was the first cheesecake I ever made and it came out AWESOME.  I brought it to a friend's Thanksgiving dinner and people just swooned over it.  I made it in a simple glass pie dish with Oreo cookie crumb crust.  PERFECTION!!  I am now a dedicated fan both to cooking and to this website

Fantastic recipe!  Made it for a friend's birthday last week, and will make it again for our Thanksgiving celebration feast.  Great helpful hints - my cake cracked, so I smoothed it with the spatula & then topped with wafer crumbs - great finishing touch.  Will do it again, even if no cracks!

I made this for a parent-teacher luncheon, only I glazed it with melted milk chocolate, drizzled it with white chocolate, and garnished it with chocolate-covered espresso beans.  It tasted and looked magnificent!!  This one is definitely going to be a standby for me now.  Thanx!

After reading all the reviews I decided to try it out, but the result was disappointing. It turned out too thin (not thick in height like other cheesecakes) and it lacked the taste of irish cream. What was nice was the lightness and the choc. cookie crust. I would probably use twice the amount of filling next time to achieve more height.

WOW!  Outstanding recipe.  Neither of the 2 kids that tried it liked it, but all the adults did.  You can expect to cut this cheesecake into a MINIMUM of 12 pieces because it's so rich.  Thanks Elaine.

This was so easy and so good.  I served it at a large party and had to stash two pieces for my husband and myself to have later as the rest disappeared immediately.  I added more Bailey's as well as some Kahlua and served it with whipped cream.  Delicious!

I thought this cheesecake lacked a strong enough Bailey's flavor. It tasted more like a good chocolate cheesecake. It was improved with a topping made with sourcream, sugar,vanilla and Bailey's.

OMG. This is the best cheesecake I've ever had. I made two: one strictly according to the recipe instructions and one with a couple of minor alterations. My preferred version was the one for which I applied some alterations. Nothing major - I used two cups of crushed chocolate cookie crumbs for the crust and 1/2 cup of Bailey's Irish Cream. 

I did not use a water bath. I just lined a sheet pan with foil and put the springform pan on top of that (in case of any minor leakage). After baking it according to the instructions, I left the cheesecake in the turned-off oven, with the door ajar, for 30 minutes (this is a practice I follow for pretty much all cheesecakes). After that, I let it sit at room temperature on a cooling rack for a couple of hours, then I put it in the fridge to sit overnight.

No cracks whatsoever! It was the most perfect looking cheesecake I've ever baked. The taste is simply amazing. I will be making this one often! Thanks so much for a fantastic recipe!

Outstanding!! I've made this recipe for several years now and everyone loves it.  The only change I make is increasing the Bailey's to a 1/2 cup.  Bake this in the evening and leave it cool overnight and I have never had it crack.

This was a big hit with our friends, and goes great with bold read wine.  I used chocolate liqueur in the crust to help it mold a little more, and the added flavor worked out well.

ARE YOU KIDDING!  This cheesecake is absolutely FANTASTIC!  It is really rich, but soooo good.  All of  my dairy was at room temperature, and I baked it in a water bath.  One of the reviewers added 1/2 cup of Baileys and I thought ...why not.  Thank you to Elaine for submitting.  I will be making this cake for many occasions.

I will definitely make this again.  Only changes I made were I added an additional 1/4 cup irishcream and 1/4 of cocoa.  Its extremely decadent.  We had small servings and it was plenty.  Probably could get 16 servings out of one springform pan.  Whipped cream helps cut the sweetness.  I put a pan of water under the cheesecake in the oven.  Instead of sitting it directly in the water.  Not one crack.  After letting it cool in the oven for 4 hrs, I put it in the fridge overnight. It was still a little soft in the center.  Next time I may put it in the freezer to set.  I also added the irishcream & sourcream first before I added the cream cheese.  I used a very high quality cocoa from a local source.

This is the best Irish Cream cheesecake I have ever made. I doubled the crust and covered the sides of the cheesecake which I will not do again. The crust was way to thick and was almost burned so next time I will only do a bottom crust.

My guests ate every crumb.  I dressed each plate with a small teaspoon of raspberry preserves and a multi sliced strawberry spread like a fan. Delicious with coffee or a dessert red wine.  Can you say “Staple go to?”  Thank you Allrecipes!

It was ok.  The changes I made: Like most I increased the Irish Cream to 1/2 a cup. I reduced the Sour cream a little.  And I used 1 low fat cream cheese and low fat sour cream.
A few people in my family liked it but I was disappointed.  It was probably half and half.  No one disliked it but here's what the dissenters felt...
It didn't taste cheesecakey.  It was EXTREMELY rich.  Almost too rich.  It tasted like a very thick, very rich mousse in a cake form.  People who liked that, loved it.  I felt it was a bit much.
I also couldn't taste the irish cream - but some family said they could.
I did bake it with a water bath on the rack below (I can never get it to not leak into the pan no matter what I try) and left it in the oven with the door cracked when it was done for several hours.  Visually it was stunning, probably the prettiest cheesecake I've ever made.
I brought this to Thanksgiving and I had high hopes, but in the end I was disappointed.  I probably won't make this again.

EDIT: I realized I bought Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa Powder instead of Unsweetened.  I wonder if this is why mine was like chocolate smacking you in the face when some complained of not having a chocolate taste.  If you wanted more chocolate, try the Special Dark Cocoa. Because whoa.

I love this recipe, I make it Gluten Free using gluten free cookies, and flour, and verify my other ingredients are gluten free, .. my favorite cookies are the ones from Aldi's the chocolate brownie, and I mix it up with the snickerdoodle.

Love this recipe, im not a huge fan of cheesecake but this is so good. Also didnt use water bath but only had small cracks around the edge. I also leave the oven open for about 2 mins to let it cool to 250 a bit quicker.

Excellent cheesecake. Baked in water bath and no cracks on top. Did increase coffee liqueur to 1/3 cup as suggested from other reviewer. My only problem was the crust, it just crumbled on me. I used chocolate Teddy Grahams crushed, not sure what went wrong.

Made this for the first time today. I have made many cheesecakes (espresso, amaretto, strawberry, chocolate, tiramisu cheesecake etc.). This was no more difficult or time consuming than any of the others. I used closer to 1/2 a cup of Baileys, and I did bake it in a waterbath. No cracks at all. I refrigerated the crust to cool while I mixed the cheese filling, and I also made sure that all my ingredients were at room temperature before I started. This was made ahead so it's in the freezer, but I plan to decorate with grated milk & white chocolate before serving. The batter tasted delicious. It came easily away from the sides of the pan too. Will definitely make again.
Edited to add that it has now been eaten. Removed it from the freezer 24 hours before serving, and decorated it with shredded white and milk chocolate. It was perfect. You could absolutely taste the Baileys, the consistency was exactly as it should be for a cheesecake. Extremely rich, decadent, and definitely a make again cheesecake!

This tastes awesome, but it always ends up with cracks on the top. I've tried the water bath, but that didn't help. If anyone knows a way to fix this, that'd be great to know.

Delicious!  Added 2 tablespoons of Irish whiskey to the crust right before baking, as well as about a half a bottle of Guinness to the batter.  Increased high heat baking time by 5 minutes, and voila!  An Irish car bomb cheesecake.  So good.  :)

Made this for St. Patty’s Day, but with some trepidation given the conflicting reviews.  Followed the recipe but cooked about 5 minutes longer, and it was great! I got rave reviews and was asked for the recipe, which means people weren’t just saying it was good to be kind.

This is a very forgiving recipe. I have made it before and it is delicious but today, on Christmas I decided to make one at the last minute. We don't eat a lot of desserts but my dad, who is 92 asked for something chocolate this morning. I could have thrown some brownies together but then remembered this recipe.  I had to go to the convenience store for his newspaper and they had the cream cheese, no chocolate wafers but they did have oreos, and I had everything else. So in a food processor I blended oreos and melted butter but omitted the powdered sugar. Then patted the mix in the bottom of the pan as directed. I mixed up the filling in the food processor as well, just dumped everything in and blended,  but ugh! I was out of Baileys. I did have Kahlua so in it went. Then I couldn't find my spring form pan so I used 2 round cake pans, 9". I reduced the baking time a bit and just watched them closely.  Turned out amazing. My dad had 2 pieces!! One is in the freezer for another day and Pa will probably finish off this one in a few days. So good.

This was a good recipe. Simple enough and turned out well. It just wasn’t quite rich enough for me. When I make a chocolate cheesecake I really want the chocolate to be dark and rich. This had more of a subtle chocolate flavor which was fine but it just wasn’t what I was hoping for. I piped a dark chocolate mousse on top and that help but it still just wasn’t enough for me. However, if you want an easy, straightforward, subtly chocolate cake, then this is the recipe for you!

I am critical in my ratings, a recipe must be great to get 4 stars from me. 
I refuse to use Oreos or any Nabisco/Mondelez products  so I used my typical home ground Malted Milk Biscuits, (Australian made, I am in Thailand) added 1/3 cup cocoa powder, confectioners sugar and butter for the crust.  Also, My oven will not go hotter than 370°. That given, The cake turned out ok in my opinion, I felt there was not enough of the Irish Cream taste but my friends loved it just like it was. I liked the baked crust idea, other recipes I tried did not call for that  but I must say I was quite happy with the crust.

I liked it, but I am a choc-o-holic! My family found it too sweet. I used dark chocolate cocoa powder, which I thought would cut the sweetness. Maybe a graham cracker crust next time.

First of all I wanted to make this non-alcoholic so I substituted Bailey's Irish Cream creamer.  I really couldn't taste that irish cream flavor. However this is still Phenomenal!  It didnt have the totally cheesecake consistency which was why my hubby wasn't a huge fan however I as well as my family thought it was absolutely "da bomb";)  It really was a cross between the cheesecake/mousse consistency - somewhat solid but very smooth!   Loved it!   I want to make it again - right now;)  I baked it with a pan of hot water on the rack below the cake and left it in the oven overnight to cool.  No cracks whatsoever! Highly recommend this recipe!

03/18/17, First, I omitted the confectioners sugar in the crust. I used regular sugar instead in the crust. I also used crushed Nabisco chocolate graham crackers with butter for the crust. For the cocoa powder I used King Arthurs Flour's Triple Cocoa Blend.  Which made for a richer chocolate cake I think. I reduced the granulated sugar by 1/3c because  I used half a cup a Bailey's Irish Cream in the cheesecake mixture (as mentioned by other reviewers). I baked it low and slow on 350 degrees for 55 minutes. No water bath. Little to no cracking. I let the cake cool in the oven with the oven door cracked open for an hour. Then I ran a knife around the spring form pan and let the cake continue to cool on the counter. I made a whipped cream frosting with A little Baileys added to it. The cheesecake was good!  Not overly sweet. It taste reminded  me of chocolate ice cream for some reason.  The cake had a very smooth texture. Yummy!

Made this for a St Patrick's Day dinner. Caveat: I'd never made a cheesecake before nor did I have a springform pan.  Used Oreo wafers for the crumb crust in a 9" deep dish pie pan which worked just fine.  Used my stand mixer to make the cheesecake. Am new to all this so I had chocolate everywhere! But I finally got it put together. The top cracked during baking. When cooled I topped it with Cool Whip and added a few green sprinkles.  Didn't taste very "cheesy" to me but others loved it. It could use more Irish Cream for sure. Serve in very small wedges because it's rich and dense. All in all everyone seemed to enjoy it.

Delicious! This was my first cheesecake and it turned out perfect! I followed some advice from the other reviews and brought the ingredients to room temperature before mixing it. Then, instead of a water bath, I just put a big stainless steel bowl of hot water on the rack beneath it while it baked. I cracked open the oven door after it finished and let it sit for about an hour before taking it out.  My cheesecake didn't have a single crack!

Great recipe, easy to make and very rich and tasty.  Used Bailey's Irish Cream, and decorated with dark chocolate shavings, melted chocolate chip drizzle and raspberries that hid a few cracks on the surface.

Used 2 tbsp white sugar in crust instead of confectioners sugar. Doubled the Irish cream and cut the sugar down to a cup on account of the sweetness of the Irish cream. Also used 1/4 cup flour to stiffen instead of 3tbsp. It was a huge hit, everybody loved it. It is however very filling so small slices are recommended.

We used Bailey's Irish Cream coffee creamer for a non-alcoholic version.  It was okay, I guess, but it wasn't delicious.

I will make this one again.  Cool the crust well before adding the filling.  I baked it on a cookie sheet filled with water to reduce the cracking.  When the cook time was over, I turned the oven off,  put the cookie sheet of water on a lower oven rack and left the springform pan on the original rack. I left it there for a few extra hours before removing it from the pan.  There were a few small cracks on the surface, but nothing to make it look horrible. Taste is yummy!

I've made this cheesecake twice and people practically drool over it. Increase the cocoa in the cheesecake batter and increase the bailey's. I use a cherry pie filling on the top and chocolate shavings on the sides. Voila. Chocolate cherry bailey's Irsh cream cheesecake. It's a mouthful and it earns it!

Yes, a great recipe.  I used limoncello instead of Irish Cream and sprinkled the top with limoncello chocolate curls and candied lemon peel. No cracking with water bath.

Made this for Easter dessert. It was so rich and decadent! The only changes I made were subbing out 2tbsp white sugar for the confectioner's in the crust, and upping the Irish to half cup. While it was absolutely delicious, it was too rich for everyone. No one could finish an entire slice. If I make it again I will likely cut the Irish back down to the original amount, and cut the cocoa as well, and swap 8oz cream cheese for mascarpone to silken it up. Aside from the over sweetness it was amazing.

This is awesome. I couldn't find chocolate wafer cookies so I used chocolate graham crackers and regular white sugar for the crust.   I also used a bit more Irish cream then the recipe called for , about 1/3 of a cup, simply because that emptied the bottle.   I baked it per the recipe, except I used a water bath and when the 60 minutes at 250 was done, I turned the oven off and let it sit in the bath for another hour.   Removed it,ran a knife around the inside of the pan, let it cool then refrigerated overnight.  No splits, no craters,  Did dark chocolate curls on it.  Everyone loved it.
3/30/16--Update--I made it again and this time I used Kahlua in place of the Irish Cream.  General consensus is that it is even better with Kahlua.

I have made this cheesecake a dozen times or so, and it is wonderful!!!  It's the only cheesecake we make.  A couple things though:  increase the Bailey's to at least 1/2 cup, and up to 3/4 cup (if you really like the flavor), but 1/4 cup is not enough.  Also, my cheesecake needs to bake at a higher temp than 250.  When I follow the recipe's directions, my cheesecake was runny and underdone.  Finally, you can substitute Kahlua for Bailey's, if you don't have or like Irish Cream.  :-)

I have made this before. I baked it in a water bath like the viewers and video suggested and I added a half cup instead if 1/4 of the Irish Liqueur and it was perfect for my chocolate fix. Not sure if people  serve this dessert to children but very nice creamy, chocolate dessert for the adults. Making this baby for thanksgiving

Have done the original and the 1/2 cup variations, I do find half cup to be a bit overpowering.  A friend turned me into a Maple Bourbon Cream that works well with this. I do dark cocoa powder with the Irish and normal cocoa powder for the bourbon. Also I do a crust with Oreo cookies which works great

Love, love, love this recipe!! I made this a second time tonight!  Used probably 1/3 cup of Irish Cream this time, but this emptied my bottle! Lol!  I baked it just as stated and when I take it out of the oven, it does have minor cracks, but as it cools in the frig, the cracks close up.  I sprinkle it with more chocolate crumbs and it looks perfect!  The flavor is wonderfully rich!  Everyone at work thought it was bought and not homemade!  This is definitely my all time favorite cheesecake!

This was a great cheesecake. I love Irish creme so took the advice of others and used 1/2 cup instead of the 1/4 cup called for and it was really a little too strong for my taste. I think about 1/3 cup would have been just right.  The cooking time was off (at least for my oven).  I cooked it for the 10 minutes at the high heat and then checked it at 40 minutes after changing the temperature and it was already set all the way through.  I'd check it at 30-35 minutes after changing the temperature.  I also had a pan in the oven with water and had no problem with cracks.  It came out beautiful.

This cheesecake had a nice consistancy and looked nice, but I felt it did not have a distinct flavor of either chocolate or Irish cream. Flavor was very subtle.

I am not a fan of cheesecake and everyone else who feels the same who I have given this cake to LOVES it.  I have done several variations of this cake (with or without its irish add ins) and it never fails me.  For those looking to have a more chocolate flavor, I recommend getting your hands on some dark cocoa.  I found some at a local baking supply store and use half dark cocoa and half regular cocoa in my cakes.  I'm experimenting with making mini cheesecakes based on the suggestions here and hope they turn out just as amazing (I'm even trying to make vanilla mini cheesecakes based on this recipe.) Fingers crossed.

I made this for my husband's dad's birthday. He said his family LOVED it (I missed the party), but I wasn't a huge fan.  I guess maybe it's because I'm more used to the texture of an unbaked cheesecake - I never realized there was such a difference between baked & unbaked.  It seemed too dense, really heavy, super rich, which I didn't love, but apparently that's how baked cheesecakes are supposed to be (my husband tells me).  So he would have given it 5 stars, and I would have given it 3, so I averaged it out to 4.  I also did chocolate graham crackers instead of chocolate cookies for the crust as a few reviewers had recommended, and you couldn't tell the difference, and I used reduced fat cream cheese & sour cream.  The flavor of it was good, it was just the richness/density that I didn't like.

I brought this to a family dinner...and the leftovers to my office. Everyone loved it. I used two packages of chocolate cream cheese and 1 package of regular cream cheese. Also upped the Irish cream to 1/2 cup.
Will make again for sure.

Amazing! although i had frozen and thawed my cream cheese (not knowing that was bad...) and had so resulting in a grainy texture... the cheesecake still turned out so delicious! my co-workers raved about it! i put 1/2 cup bailey instead and used low fat sour cream as the full fat has ran out

My husband and I recently made this cake for a friend's birthday.  It was excellent. So rich, everyone loved it.  We wrapped the pan in foil and baked in water bath. Beautiful with no cracks.  Can't wait to have again.

I didn't add the alcohol or the sugar to the pie crust and it still came out great. Very rich!

excellent! i made this for my family for mother's day after my mom made a request for a dessert that was chocolately. my cheesecake cracked, as everyone else mentioned, but i didn't attempt the water bath because this was my first cheesecake. but i'm also blessed with a family who isn't remotely food-picky and couldn't care less how cracked and unsmooth a dessert could be. but i'm appearance obsessive, so i'll try it next time. the irish creme taste isn't too terribly apparent, my family kept asking if coffee was an ingredient. so if you're really looking forward to tasting the irish creme, up the amount a bit. delicious and super rich!

Loved this recipe. It was my first attempt at a cheesecake and it turned out WONDERFULLY. It came out beautifully. I didn't experience any cracks, just be sure to grease the pan well. Like many, I increased the amount of Irish Cream to 1/3 cup. It was less creamy than I hope it would be. Next time, I will watch it more carefully and take it out earlier than I did. (An hour was not long enough for me)

YUM!  I could not find chocolate cookie crumbs, so I ground up chocolate graham crackers and made my own crumbs for the crust.  This was well-received at the Saint Patrick's Day party we recently attended!

This was very good. The only changes I made was to use chocolate grahmn cracker crumbs & to up to Irish cream liqueur to 1/3 C. The crust was a little crumbly, might add more butter next time. I had to cook for 15 mins longer than specified but I have to do that with all cheesecakes, it might be the high altitude where I live. Thanks Elaine.

I made this over the holidays, and for being my first attempt at a cheesecake it turned out great. The recipe is wonderful but I did add more irish cream for a stronger flavor.

I doubled the recipe and made a 2-tier cake using an 8-inch springform and a 10-inch springform pan. Didn't have Irish cream so used Kahlúa instead. I also increased the bake time by 20 minutes since I was baking both at the same time, and baked in a water bath. The resulting cake was absolutely beautiful and equally delicious, and was devoured in minutes.

This cheesecake was absolutely delicious!  It had great texture and a wonderful chocolate flavor.  However, I did not taste any irish cream flavor at all which was a big disappointment.  I even upped the irish cream to 1/3 cup, but maybe I should have done 1/2 cup as some others have suggested.  Also, my cake did crack even though I put a pan of water on the lower rack of the oven.  Next time I will be sure to grease and flour the sides of the pan.  Overall this was an excellent cheesecake, thus the 4 star rating.  But if you're looking for a strong irish cream flavor, I would suggest adding 1/2 cup.

this is great. i used a standard crust (2 c graham crackers, 6 tbsp melted butter, 1/4 c sugar) and omitted the cocoa. baked the crust for 10 minutes on 350. i also used 2 tbsp flour instead of 3, only 1 cup of sugar, and 1/2 c of bailey's. i baked them in muffin tins (makes 24) for school. these are sooo good. my mom who refuses to eat stuff that's "bad" for her was licking her fingers. i also sprinkled shaved white chocolate on the top when they were warm and dusted them with cocoa powder. a tip if you're using muffin tins- spray the tin after you bake the crust. then fill and bake 30-35 minutes at 350. yum!

Followed the directions exactly, except I upped the bailey's to 1/2 cup per reviews. Also, placed a pan of hot water in the bottom of the oven. It came out beautiful - no cracks. Brought this to a work party and it was GONE in 10 minutes. Delicious.

Decent cake but definitely not worthy of five stars.  The texture and crust were perfect but the cake itself was lacking in flavor.  It had no chocolate taste and just a hint of irish cream.  I was expecting a richer cake.

This was the first time I baked a cheesecake and it turned out great. The flavor and texture are excellent and everybody at work loved it. :-) There is not an obvious Irish Cream flavor, so if you want that, you will need to add more.

I've tried many different irish cream recipes. This one is great! I suggest turning the oven off when the cheesecake is done, and letting it cool off in the oven. This helps to prevent cracking.

I made this cake tonight for 5 other friends and they all loved it. I upped the Baileys to somewhere between 1/3 - 1/2 of a cup. I could defintely taste the Bailey's but it wasn't too strong. I also crushed up Oreo's for the crust and it turned out to be everyone's favorite part of the cake. The cake did have cracks, but this was the first time I made a cheesecake, so maybe the cracks were my fault. Bottom line is that I will certainly make this again.

I sub vanilla for the irish cream.  It was the best tasting cheesecake I have ever eaten.  Be sure and place springform pan on a cookie sheet or butter will run onto the floor of your oven (like mine!)  I bought chunk of dark chocolate to shave on top but didn't need anymore chocolate!!!

Delicious ( I used 1 c. sugar, and sub. 1 tsp vanilla for Irish Liqueur, and doubled the sour cream to 1 c.) I made two-the one in the glass pie plate developed the famed Grand Canyon Crack but the one in the large square corell dish did  not.  I left the oven door open the last 10 minutes of baking.

This is a wonderful cheescake. I did have cracking down the middle of the cake but I doctored it with chocolate leaves that I made from melted chocolate chips. I made this for thanksgiving, it wouldn't have mattered how much cracking I had it was a serious hit with everyone. Very creamy texture, rich! but very good!!! Highly recommend.

The flavor of this cheescake was excellent.  However, just like one of the other reviewers stated, mine also developed a huge crack.  The day I made this cheesecake I also made three other cheesecakes.  All for a function at work.  This one was left at home.  There must be something about the baking instructions with the high heat beginning that causes this.  I would make again but try to adjust the baking method.

This was good, but I have never had a cheesecake crack like this one.  I nicknamed it the Grand Canyon cheesecake.  The chocolate crust made the taste!

Wonderful recipe; the comments and the tips all very helpfully lead it to a great success to my very first Cheese cake. I made this for my birthday. It looks great, no cracks, so good that my dad had a huge piece before the party ( long story, in short, I had to make another cake in 3 hours ON my birthday before the guests arrive.) It tastes good, everyone loved it. Some thought the Irish Cream was too strong, some said they couldn't taste it. I put double the original recipe as suggested by others. I actually accidentally put double the sour cream, but it turned out fine, probably a bit stronger/ heavier taste of the cheese. I didn't put sugar in the crust, and added only one cup for the body, as most of my "audience" prefer less sweet, and with the Irish cream, it probably WILL make it too sweet if I follow the original portion for sugar. I wonder how everyone else garnish their cheese cakes? Just plain cake? It was too plain for a birthday cake... In all, thank you again for your tips, great cake, will make it again soon!

This was pretty good. I made a fudge truffle one off of this site that I like a little bit better, but I might try to mx the 2 recipes. Still good though. Mine didn't crack at all and looked really pretty.

Made this for St. Patrick's day dinner and it was a big hit.  Very rich so we cut small pieces.  My son took the leftovers back to the college dorm and they all loved it too!  This is definitely a keeper!!!

Terrific cheesecake, but do be careful about making one or two adjustments.  I had increased the Irish Creme to 1/3 c as suggested by others, which was WONDERFUL.  I used crushed chocolate graham crackers instead of cookies.  Also, I used my water bath on a separate rack instead of putting the cheesecake in it (believe me, I ruined 2 of these by putting them inside the water bath).  Just place a roaster with 3 inches of hot water into the oven about a half hour before baking the cheesecake, it will come out just beautifully!

Excellent taste! I used a graham wafer crust and put in 1/2 cup of Bailey's. I think another user said theirs had more of a mousse texture than a creamy one and mine did too. I topped this with unsweetened real whip cream.

My grocery store didn't have those chocolate wafer cookies, so I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust and it worked fine.  The cheesecake was fabulous and all my guests loved it.  Definitely a keeper.

This was a huge hit at my work's St. Patricks Day potluck.  I decorated the top with cool whip and then sprinkled some leftover cookie crumbs on top and it looked and tasted great!  Terrific recipe!!

Excellent cheesecake!  My first!  The only suggestion I will make is the recipe calls for the cookie crumbs to be placed on the bottom.  The bottom was a bit thick, SO next time I will press the cookie crust on the bottom AND the sides.

Fantastic cheesecake! Made it for my Sister-in Law's birthday, and everyone raved about it. I make cheesecakes often, and have never had one crack so much (maybe I overcooked it a bit, wasn't watching too closely, and I think my oven runs a little hot), but a ganache finished it off nicely, and made it even richer!!! I couldn't taste much of the Irish cream, and I put in 1/2 cup. It was delicious nonetheless. Definitely a keeper! Thanks, Elaine!

Perfect cheesecake!  Everyone who tried it absolutely loved it.  It was so easy, too.  I didn't have chocolate cookies to crush for the crust, so I used regular graham crackers, and I think the crust was still great.  Thanks, Elaine!

This is very yummy.  I put 1/2 cup of Irish Cream in the recipe.  Then, I cheated.  I bought a premade graham cracker crust.  This recipe fills 2 of them with just a little bit of room for whip cream or ....  The oreo crust tasted really good with this recipe.

My husband commented that there should be more Irish Cream in this, but other than that, it was my first attempt at cheesecake and it turned out GREAT. One comment from those with whom I shared: "This is SO GOOOOOD".

fantastic recipe!  Tip to share-If your springform pan is not of the non-stick variety, line the bottom with some parchment paper.  It peels off the bottom of the cake effortlessly when you take it out of the refrigerator.

I made this for Christmas-all the adults loved it, but my kids didn't care for it-it's not really sweet (which all the adults liked) but most kids don't care for.  All the more for us! This was very good and a real treat. I personally should have baked it for less time - I think my oven's warmer than it should be.  Keep an eye on it if you're unsure of your oven so it doesn't dry out.

I made this as a trial cheesecake for Christmas dinner.  It did not crack and I thought it was good, but needed a sauce on top.  My husband didn't like it... thought it was dry.  My brother-in-law was not a big fan either.  It won't be our Christmas dessert.  Sorry!!

This was soooooo yummy!! I made this two days ago for a family dinner & it was the first time I'd ever made cheesecake. I was amazed at how easy it is to make. Everyone really loved it & actually asked to take some home, which never happens. I followed everyone's advice & added 1/3 cup Bailey's & it was just the right amount. I couldn't find cookie crumbs for the crust though, so I used chocolate Nilla wafers that I ground in the food processor. It worked really well. I have a piece left in the fridge & can't wait to get home to eat it.

This cheesecake was wonderful.  I've been searching for a great recipe with no luck until now. All my co-workers loved it and were left wanting more.  This cheesecake didn't taste really heavy like most do.

I made this for my husband's birthday and everyone liked it!  It even passed the Mother-in-law test because she liked it too!  She said it was light and not too rich, just right.  It was really good and easy to make.  I used 1/3 cup of Bailey's as someone else suggested.  It came out great!  I will add this to my recipe box and will make this one again.  Thank you!

I served this cheesecake at a party and it was a HUGE hit!  Everyone was asking for the recipe.  It's relatively easy to make, and I will definitely be serving it again.  I used 1/3 cup of the Bailey's instead of 1/4 cup.  Next time I'll try Kahlua.

This cheesecake had great flavor, but I was a little disappointed at the thickness of it.  Other cheesecakes I've made are much thicker and look nicer, but it was still a great dessert.  Mine cracked, but that has to do with the baker, not necessarily the recipe.  Will definately make again!

Absolutely fantastic. I added a bit more Bailey's for a stronger flavour. It has a wonderful taste, rich but not overpowering and so creamy!

This was really good but I don't think that it is anything special, maybe because I like my cheesecake texture more solid than mushy.  Everybody gave me good comments on it though!

I served this cheesecake for a dinner party recently and it was a HUGE hit.  Guest said it was the creamiest, best cheesecake he'd ever had. It was delicious and Bailey's Cream wasn't overpowering.

This is my second time to bake the cheese cake.  It was good but the bottom crust got very dry. Everyone just eat the top part and threw the bottom away.  I will definately try again.
