I've made this recipe a couple of times.  We just finished eating it and it was absolutely fabulous.  This time I halved the recipe since there was only two of us.  I had ham instead of bacon on hand, just less milk than called for (just enough to make a nice cheese sauce.  Add a little milk, then a little cheese, repeat until cheese is gone).  I also sauteed the onions and then added the ham in the pan to flavor up the ham.  The adding of dijon mustard as suggested in another review topped everything off perfectly.  There was no need for salt or pepper.  It reminded us of eggs benedict.  Delicious!

Wonderful recipe! I'm bad though, I used half and half instead of milk because I wanted it nice and rich, and it was! :)

flavor was really great, however, mine turned out really soupy- even after cooking longer. Next time I'll try it with out hard boiling the eggs first.

I had leftover ham which I substituted for the bacon.  Good recipe to use up Easter leftovers!

Unusual and tasty breakfast dish! Add a little Dijon mustard to the sauce for zip, and buttered bread crumbs as a topping for crunch.

I like this recipe.   I did add minced garlic along with the onion.   I also cut the corn from one ear off my sweet corn and included it with the onion and garlic.   A different twist on eh bakes with the hard boiled eggs.

My wife and I loved this dish.I had my doubts when I put it in the oven and still had doubts when I took it out of the oven due to how creamy it was. Upon tasting it though, it was much better than I expected. the creaminess only enhanced the taste.
It is a extremely good dish. The only thing I did differently was to  put some of the onions on the first layer before I added the rest of the in ingredients.

My family loved it. I omitted the bacon and added a pkg of hash brown potatoes (cooked them 1st). Fantastic!

Exceptional! I did add some cubed white bread that I toasted in the bacon grease.
A variation of layering hash browns in the bottom would sound like a good idea too. But overall, definitely want to make this one again!

If I could give it no stars I would. Consistency is soupy. Tasted bad. A waste of a dozen eggs and a pound of bacon.
