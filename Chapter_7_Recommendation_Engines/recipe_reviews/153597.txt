Good cookies. My test batch baked up with a somewhat rounded top instead of flat like I like. I flattened out the next batch with the heel of my hand and they baked up just right. I do not use brown sugar so I added a tablespoon of molassas to make up the difference when I used two cups of white sugar.

Baking time was somewhere between 10 and 12 minutes depending on how you like your cookies.

We all think these are fantastic!! I decreased the cumin to 1/2 tsp. and baked them at 350 for 12 minutes. 375 seemed to be too hot, because they fell quickly (did not stay the least bit 'thick'), so once I decreased the temp. to 350 - they were perfect. I love the spices in this - PERFECT! (Oh yeah, moist too!) :)

These cookies were fantastic! The mixture was a little dry, I formed into balls and put them on the cookie sheet. Half way through baking I smooshed them down a bit, to make them a little more flat.

A little too sweet. I used less fresh nutmeg as well. I also added rum extract! My next batch will be adding more ground cayenne pepper. Yummy!

This is actually a very good recipe.  I was a little leary about the six spices, but the recipe is a keeper.  I may omit the cumin next time though.  It was a little more overbearing than any of the other spices.

These are very good and part of my usual.  Go very lightly with the cumin as it can overtake the cookie.  Tried without, and they were kind of bland.

We simply did not like this recipe.  You're better off with the recipe on the top of the lid of the oatmeal box.  We found this recipe to have a "funny taste" that nobody liked.

somewhat dry but tasty.  not as "spiced" as i thought they would be.  maybe needs more cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger.

I did only a half a teaspoon cumin.  It already seemed a little much & one other reviewer had suggested it.  Since there were a lot of comments about it being dry, I added half a can of pumpkin puree.  They are so good.  A half can may be a smidge too much, but it definitely keeps them moist.  Very very good.

I tried the cookies and found them to be a little to dry.  Th cummin could probably be reduced to 1/2 t. vs 1 t. But the ginger wasa nice touch.

An interesting and yummy twist on normal oatmeal raisin cookies!  I accidentally had to double the egg, as I was making a half recipe and didn't really look at the ingredient list until I came to "1/2 egg".  Oops.  They came out great anyway, and since others seem to be complaining they are too dry, maybe it was for the best in the end!  I'll make these again.

I need to know what is to hold these ingredients together.  Mixed everything together as per recipe and it didn't do a thing to hold.  What's going on?  Is there an ingredient/s missing?  Not a happy camper.
