My husband loves anything with "ranch" so I decided to try this. However I had a different take on it.  I didn't warm the chicken in the microwave and made these into wrap sandwiches with flour tortillas vs. making these into tacos. I used pico de gallo vs. salsa and "Taco Seasoning II" from this site vs. a packaged seasoning mix.  I left out the olives and instead thought what works best with ranch, lettuce and tomato - Bacon of course! So I added a few slices of bacon to each wrap along with the avocado slices and shredded cheddar cheese - YUM!

I didn't bother cutting my ranch with sour cream. I just used my own homemade dry ranch dressing mix and added it to reduced fat sour cream. I didn't use rotisserie chicken, either. I had two chicken breasts I boiled in chicken broth with mexican spices (cumin, coriander, onion, garlic, mexican oregano), then cooled and shredded. I also used flour tortillas. This was quite good--easy and a kid pleaser. I think that next time, I'd skip the tortillas and try this as a chunky chicken taco salad.

VERY VERY GOOD!  My new favorite taco! The only thing I did different was to pan cook a few chicken breast with some taco seasoning on them and shred them up.  The rest was the same!  I LOVE these and will be making them often! They are also great for not having to use the oven in this Texas Summer Heat!

Great recipe, especially for these hot days. For the chicken I cooked it with the taco seasoning mixed with water on the stove (like you would typically do with ground beef). I also added a little more salsa to the sauce. Excellent! We'll definitely be eating it again.

I used Light Ranch and only 2 TB fat free sour cream (I was short) for the sauce.  I didn't use all of the remaining seasoning in the chicken- just eyeballed it until it looked good and seasoned and I had to add a little water to the chicken just to keep it moist.  The flavor was probably only 4 stars but since it was so easy I gave it the 5th star.  Hubs and the kiddo assembled theirs on flatout bread and I had mine on a spinach salad.  Everyone was happy and healthy. Thanks!

Really good.  I found myself adding extra sauce to my tacos because the chicken was kind of dry.  Otherwise, it was a nice change of pace.  Can't wait to make taco salad from the leftovers.

Very good! We used green chili instead of regular salsa, flour tortillas and excluded the onions (because I forgot) My husband loved the Ranch sauce and so did I.

Yummy!  My family loved this "ranch" dressing.  It would be great on a taco salad as well!  I did add 2 tbls of both the salsa and taco seasoning for a little bit more mexican flavor.  Will make again!

Don't underestimate the simplicity of this dish-it was great!  Not to mention VERY easy.  Who couldn't use an easy recipe to whip up when time is short?  I followed the recipe exactly, except for a few toppings that I didn't have on hand. The ranch salsa adds a lot-don't skip it. Very family friendly.  Thanks for the recipe:)

I baked the tortillas in cute little metal taco salad bowls I ordered from an infomercial. Then I filled the bowls with the chicken as instructed, sprinkled cheese on top, and popped the bowls back in the oven until the cheese was melted. Everyone loved adding their own toppings to taste, i.e. black olives, green onions, the special taco sauce, salsa, avocado. I had everything on mine and thoroughly enjoyed it. I thought it would not be filling. But since I doubled the chicken portion, I was able to fill the bowls at least half way, leaving room for the toppings, and a satisfying meal.

I’m glad I saw this recipe.  I was looking for something quick and it just so happened that I had everything this recipe calls for, including things that were about to perish.  There’s nothing I love more than when I can turn leftovers into a 5 Star meal!  The Ranch dressing just gives this a new and refreshing taste and has inspired me to go in all sorts of new directions.   I like my greens and minus the tortilla, this makes for a very tasty chicken ranch salad.  As a side note, I make my own taco seasoning using the recipe for “Taco Seasoning I” that you can find on this site.

These are good, but not too terribly exciting.  I'm thinking of trying to add different seasoning to the chicken.  The sauce is really good if you make fish tacos.

Delicious and EASY dinner! I used lowfat ranch dressing and sour cream. I don't think there was a difference and you save fat and calories. We also used flour tortillas- worked just as well too!

This was a speedy, wonderful meal.  We used flour tortillas that you bake yourself, and it was that much better. I loved the sauce.  My kiddos and MIL didn't like it, but they also don't ever eat Salsa (even the 1 TBSP) .

My family didn't like this at all. Could have used another 2 tsp of taco seasoning and it would have been ok for me, not even my not picky husband only ate one taco.  Was very bland.  Even my son who eats ranch with virtually everyone didn't like it.

This was easy, quick & soooo yummy.  Hubby loved it, 9 year old son loved it, 10 year old friend loved it.  Can be healthy, if using diet dressing, sour cream & cheese.

I had some left over rotisserie chicken that I was looking to use up. Found this recipe, this is definately a keeper! So easy to make and the sauce is perfect with it. 
When I served them, my hubby turned up his nose before tasting it.  After he tried them, he said YUM! Keep that recipe, that was great!!  Will be making this again and again. So easy, so tasty!

This was super yummy, easy and healthy. I didn't have rotisserie chicken so I cooked 2 chicken breasts in the crockpot...then shredded it up put in a pan on the stove kept them warm, added taco seasoning and a little water.

These are great! No heating up the kitchen in this summer heat! Next time I make the Ranch sauce, I'm going to add some adobo sauce from a can of chipotles and see how that tastes. I love the flavor of chipotles in most other dishes of this sort. :D

I am a new cook and this was super easy and really yummy! My husband wouldnt stop telling me how much he loved these tacos. I boiled the chicken breasts in broth and some of the taco seasoning. I added lime juice to the sauce and on the tacos after I put them all together. Another change I made was using Litehouse Jalapeno Ranch instead of plain ranch. It gave it a kick! I will use this recipe again soon!

We really liked it but would not add the taco seasonings to the chicken. There was enough flavor with the ranch sauce.

I have made this a couple times because it's so simple. I actually use chicken breasts and put them in the crock pot all day with the seasoning. When I get home from work they are completely tender and so easy to shred. Then it's just a matter of getting some toppings around and you're done! Great recipe for a working mom.

I love these ranch chicken tacos. I am not a big fan of chicken so I used ground beef and also cut out the ranch dressing, lettuce and salsa. I added a few of my own things like pinto beans, tomato paste, tomato juice and some chili powder. Once mixed up I aded the corn tortillas to the mix and that was the best stuff ever.

Delicious, made this tonight for a quick week night meal.  I did not made any changes except I left off the black olives ( forgot to buy them :-).  My family enjoyed the tacos, commenting that they were light and tasty!  We also enjoyed the minimal clean up.  Perfect week night meal.  We will definitely have these again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

These tacos were really good!  I kept to the original recipe as much as I could.  But I did go with medium salsa and cabbage because I didn't have lettuce.  The ranch sauce is delicious and as others mentioned I'd use it almost any place I'd normally use Ranch dressing.  This recipe will be a keeper at our house!

I substituted rotisserie chicken with Jack Daniels pulled chicken with Jack Daniel's barbeque sauce and turned these into BBQ Ranch chicken tacks.  I should have doubled the recipe!  My family loved them and this will become a regular meal for us.  Quick and easy!

This sounds really good.The taco seasoning packets have a lot of salt in them,very salty.I am cutting back on my salt intake,so for this,I would bypass the seasoning and use chili powder and cumin and paprika.That's pretty much a good taco flavoring right there.That's what I use wehn I make homemade tacos myself.

This was a big hit for my daughter and her family for "dinner at Granny's" nite!! !  It was very easy and went a long way!  I used a rotisserie chicken I bought at Giant Eagle, and because it was still warm, was very easy to shred.

This was so easy to make.  I only made some minor changes based on other reviews. I boiled 3 half defrosted chicken breasts in chicken broth (adding water as needed as the broth evaporated).  Only had mozzarella cheese, which worked fine. I could do without the lettuce next time and think the salsa could be optional.

Just made this dish for dinner and Love it! Very easy to make and doesnt take alot of time either. I did use boneless skinless chicken breast in place of the suggested chicken. I cooked in in a skillet with some seasonings we like ( Hot sauce, fajita seasoning) and I am being told to make this again! Thank you for a yummy dinner!!!

This recipe was delicious. I especially loved the ranch sour cream sauce and would not change a thing on it. I had already cooked left over chicken breast that I cubed up and it turned out wonderful. I highly recommend this recipe

This was excellent. I did everything the same except the chicken different...I’m not a big fan of rotisserie.  I used chicken breasts seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic powder put it in the instant pot on slow cook for about 4 hours and the last few on low. I did dump in 1/2 cup of cola ...it seems to tenderize it as it cooks. They shredded nicely ...I drained the juice and put in the recommended amount of taco seasoning (I used taco seasoning for chicken). I shredded Monterey cheddar and served on Old El Paso crispy flour tortillas. Absolutely delicious!

1-20-2018 ~You just can’t beat a rotisserie chicken (especially Costco’s).  The legs for Hubs to munch on for his lunch, great broth from the carcass and wings, chicken pieces to add to the finished broth, and a fine chicken breast for other meals. Part off the breast meat was to be for this recipe; the remaining to add to Caesar salads for MY lunch. Not. First, the chicken simply mixed with the taco seasoning was dry and absolutely coated in the seasoning, similar to when you coat meat with flour. Adding water seemed to be the solution – after all, you do that when you make tacos with ground beef, right?  You don’t just add the seasoning to the meat and leave it at that. While that was a big improvement in its consistency, I found the amount of seasoning overbearing.  Adding the chicken I had set aside for my salad came to the “rescue.” While it was of some improvement it did little to improve the overall flavor.  We ate a bit of it in a couple of tacos (we had to eat, and all the other ingredients were prepped), but sadly the rest was tossed. Hindsight is 20/20 but I would have been better off  just rinsing the seasoning off.  So much for that beautiful chicken I had looked forward to for my lunch.  As for the sauce?  A definite make again – as a salad dressing!

I thought this was easy and delicious. We used flour tortillas instead of corn because that’s what we had in hand and they were very good. I used more than 2 cups of chicken and put it in a frying pan with a little water and the taco seasoning.   It will make a good leftover lunch. Would be good on tortilla chips too for nachos. Thanks for the great recipe

Easy, quick recipe. Followed the recipe pretty much to a t.  I waited a bit for the meat mixture to cool a bit before adding it to lettuce to avoid it getting soggy. also topped it off with extra cheese and sour cream. This recipe is a staple!!

Nice change for a taco Tuesday. Very tasty idea. I baked chicken breasts with a bit of taco seasoning on them because I didn't have any rotisserie chicken. Next time I will put the breasts in the crockpot  to make them easier to pull apart.

This is an easy staple in our home.  Especially during the summer months with fresh veggies for toppings.  We typically just put chicken breasts with chicken broth in the crockpot on low for 8 hours and then shred after. I am sure the rotisserie has more flavor.

I added  black beans and deleated the black olives becaue my hubby isn't a fan of black olives and I too used flour instead of corn tortillas, just a personal preference . Garnished with fine chopped green onions and bit of cilantro.  This is a keeper recipe.
I have served it in  taco bowls as a chicken taco salad, I have made it into wraps and I have piled it on nachos  for munchies, my husband is not usually a fan of ranch dressing but didn't even ealize it was ranch , I did add a bit extra salsa when I made the nachos and tossed in 1/4 c corn for color.

I've made this recipe 3 times. 
1 time as the recipe says and the other 2 times I used Tilapia.
The 1st time I used tilapia it was pan fry, and the 2nd time it was just cooked on the pan with seasoning ad I used spring mix instead of lettuce. Still good.
The ranch dressing mix went great with the three styles I used it in.
The only ingredient I did not use was olives. Not a fan of them.

Good concept, but will make changes like warming up chicken with taco seasoning with a little water in saucepan so the flavor comes out. Just putting in the microwave just didn't cut it, no flavor, blah.  I figure if when making regular tacos the directions say to do that & we can taste the seasoning it should work here, only won't need as much water.  We only made half the sauce but hubby wants more so will probably do 3/4 of what would be needed for the # of tortillas we'd be using. This is very quick & everything can be ready ahead of time. I think I'd put the cheese on right away so it can melt some before serving.

This  was good! Very easy and quick to put together. Added jalapeños and deleted the olives (not very Mexican, grew up in Texas and never had olives on a taco). Added sour cream to the ranch mix to tone it down. Next time I'll fry flour tortillas to make it more of a tostada.

I added corn and black beans to the rotisserie chicken and a little water with the taco seasoning..simmered for a few mins while I got everything else ready. Put chicken mixture on tostadas and topped with mexican mixed cheese..popped in the oven for a few mins. Topped with lettuce, salsa fresco (from harmons), olives, cilantro, guacamole (also from harmons) and the sour cream ranch dressing...delicious!!! Even my five year old ate is and my husband made sure it would make the meal rotations!!

Tasty! I used the leftovers from the buttermilk pecan chicken on this site and prepared the rest as directed. Refreshing variation on tacos (which my partner could eat almost every day...).

This was well received at our table.  I used my own cooked chicken in lieu of a rotisserie and I did not use all the taco seasoning, but rather to taste.  Nice change of pace for dinner.  Thanks for sharing, serenebeader!

A fast, easy and tasty meal. I used Chef John's flour tortillas.  It was perfect for a busy night.

Didn't use all of the taco seasoning on the chicken and had to add water to keep it from drying out.  Boiled two chicken breasts and shredded.

I'm a big Mexican food fan, so anytime it's anything remotely like a taco, I'm pleased. The sauce in this new combo was fantastic!
