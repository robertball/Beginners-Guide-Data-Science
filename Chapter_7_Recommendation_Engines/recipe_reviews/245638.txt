you have to use this recipe. I only used pepper, salt and garlic rub but use what you want. The rock salt is important for a great crust. I cooked mine to 120. you can cook it from 115-125. Many Cooks use this method of reverse searing, look it up. This is not the only person using this method. This is the best way, you won't regret it. just remember, when you pull it out, use the foil to canopy for 20 minutes, while you preheat your oven to 500. make sure your oven is at 500 before you put it in. Reverse searing cooks the meat more evenly inside instead of an overdone outer meat. Also, don't worry about losing juices because you didn't sear it ahead. They have found, it does not make a difference as the juices still remain perfectly juicy. No worries

I baked a 7.5lb prime rib at 190 degrees  for about 5.5 hours and pulled it around 131. Carryover temp maxed at 134 after a few minutes (the lower the roasting temperature, the less the carryover cooking I gather). This seemed like a pretty perfect medium rare. I can't imagine what it would've been like if I pulled it at the suggested 115 degrees #rawAF?
The reverse sear is a winning technique though and I will be using it again in the future on other foods. I read a number of recipes for prime rib and followed parts of several of them, but this one was the most influential. I saw one recipe that said to dry brine with salt a couple days in advance, but I'm not sure how much flavor that actually imparts or if it's more to retain moisture. Anyway, the beef was a hit.

It turned out perfect. I made a 9 pound and I gave it 4 and a half hours to come to room temp, I feel this is critical for a evenly cooked Prime Rib and was so evenly cooked with this method of reverse searing.. I will always make it this way, it is so easy and everyone loved it.

We had a 3 lb piece, and as one of the reviews mentioned, cooking at 200F left the roast looking downright raw. I upped the temp to 225F, cooked it for an hour and a half before the resting period, and it came out looking perfect, just like in the picture. Will be using this method from now on.

This was a great framework to make some minor adjustments too. Firstly i'd suggest cooking to 130 as prime rib does better at a medium than a medium rare I believe. I love medium-rare steaks but the prime rib cut just does a better job with a little more cooking.

Salting the day before makes a huge difference too with the crust of the roast, don't forget to salt and let it dry out for at least an overnight period!

Cooking time does take a long time with this method depending on how well your oven does at a low temp at 200 so give yourself more time than you think you need. You can have the roast rest under aluminum foil for up to 2hrs.

The butter rub really makes this a special roast too, just throw in a bunch of fresh garlic ,thyme, rosemary and some cracked black pepper. It'll be an amazing dish you won't regret!

Used garlic with olive oil. In a paste. Roasted @ 225* in a convection oven. Still came out perfect, & cut the cooking time down some. Seared as directed tho.

I cut slits in the roast and stuffed about ten cloves of garlic.  It turned out great, flavorful, and excellent!

This was a huge hit for the holiday!  Took 4.5 hours for a 7.5 lb, but everyone raved about it. Made exactly as directed.

I made this for Christmas dinner, and it ended up taking 2 hours longer than the recipe stated, even after I increased the oven temp to 225° and my piece only weighed like 7 lbs or just under. I let mine cook to 120° because I had kids and my parents here. Next time I’ll do it to 115 because I like my steak on the rare side. It was not ready in time for dinner, so be sure to give yourself extra time. With all that said, this was the best prime rib I have ever put in my mouth.

This was the best roast I ever made. I  cooked it little different. I set the oven to 200 degrees for 2 hours and then raised the temp to 275 degrees and cooked about an hour then I raised the temp to 325 degrees. For me by doing this I could control my cooking not to burn it.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a big hit!  I followed the directions and cooked my 8 lb. standing roast in a roaster oven and it took about 4 hours.  After reading the other reviews I did let it roast to 122 degrees, let it rest for 30 min. and then finished it off in my oven at 500 deg. for 10 minutes. (My roaster only goes to 450 deg)  It had a lovely crust and was incredibly tender.  It really was a perfect medium rare and I'll definitely make again.  As others did, I used an internal thermometer to monitor the  temp.  This was an easy and elegant meal, everyone agreed this was the best roast they ever ate.

Wow, so delicious with the butter/spice mixture and a beautiful perfect crust.  Highly recommend an external digital thermometer to monitor internal temp carefully, you have to get it at the perfect temp, not before or after.   Dont worry about resting it for at least 30 minutes, the outside may cool slightly but the internal temp went up 10 degrees and the meat was so juicy

Turned out great.  The only differences I made were that I only made a 3.5 lbs roast and a seared it in cast iron instead of upping the temp to 500 degrees.  A 3.5 lbs roast is like a big steak so I cooked it like one.   I've used sous vide in the past and this method turned out better.  I find sous vide tastes too mellow.  Roasting seems to concentrate flavors better.

I have come to like the reverse sear  cooking method. I like medium rare so pulled it out at 125 degree  internal temperature which was just shy of medium rare (130 degrees according to iGrill).  It took closer to 5 hours to complete and it was only a 7.5 Lbs, fully trimmed roast.  Next time I'll be better prepared to coordinate timing of side dishes.

Absolutely delicious!  I let the seasoned roast remain uncovered  in the fridge for two days before cooking.   After using the traditional method for years  this is my standard from now own.  The roast was incredibly juicy and well seasoned.

I love the idea and process of a reverse dear but the time is way office had a 6 1/2 lb roast ..  and following instructions should have been medium well or more ( I was aiming for medium rare). what I got was extremely rare. I carved the cap and served it and then carved the rest and finished cooking it. definitely use meat thermometer ... my bad for not.

This was an amazing roast. As per other reviewers suggestions, I let the roast sit at room temperature for almost 4 hours and I also added chopped garlic to the butter paste.
My roast was 5.1/2 lbs and I did have a bit of trouble with timing.  Thank heavens for meat thermometers. Although the internal temp measured 131 when carved, the inside was quite rare. Next time I will cook at 225 on convection. While the roast sits to let the oven heat to 500. Parboiled veggies roast and Yorkshire puddings go in with roast. An awesome dinner

I love this cooking method!  I used a full rib bone in...weight, over 20 pounds.  I used a different herb combo for the rub as I'm allergic to rosemary.  I brought it down to room temperature, about 4 hours then I put it in the 200 degree oven for 4 1/2 hours, let it rest then seared it for 15 minutes.  Everyone said it was the best I've ever made!  I'll definitely be making this recipe again.

First time making a rib roast. Came out perfect. My guest really enjoyed the rib roast and even received a few comments that it was the best rib roast they had ever eaten. I used a meat thermometer and cooked the roast at 225 degrees

I have been making a standing rib roast for MANY  years...always for Christmas Dinner. This method was absolutely the best ever! I put a 7.5 lb rib roast ...just seasoned with salt,pepper,rosemary and thyme on a rack over a baking pan in the refrigerator overnight . I got it out about 2hours before putting it in a 225 degree oven and roasted for about 3.5 hours...to 120 degrees. I removed it from the oven and covered it with foil for about an hour...I made Yorkshire pudding while the roast rested. I put the roast back in the preheated oven set to 500 degrees  for ten minutes. It was cooked evenly and had a perfect crust! Awesome!

THIS IS THE ONE ... My family decided on their first bites!  70 degree RoomTemperature is the SECRET!!! (If the meat is still cold center, this will take FOREVER).  Alter the seasoning as you wish, but salt and low & slow are the keys.  For time's sake I increased cook temp to 225 for a 130 degree center and it was an Entire PERFECT Medium roast!!!

Great base recipe. Recommend sticking to a 120 initial finish temp with 30 minute interim rest before the 500 finish;  and a 20 minute final rest. The resulting roast will be deliciously early-stage medium.

Perfect.  I roasted at 225 degrees, 30 minutes per pound, removed at meat temp of 130 degrees for medium rare.  Tented and left on the counter until ready for dinner, then seared at 500 degrees for 15 minutes on convection.  Served with no meat au jus recipe made ahead.  Easy.

Turned out great, only change was instead of straight pepper, I used a garlic and pepper mix. Well worth the time to make!

A great method and perfect simple seasoning. But, while I love really rare meat, taking my smallish 5.5 lb roast out at 115° was beyond rare. I wonder if larger roasts (like the recipe calls for) retain their heat better in the middle and "cook" more while resting? Taking mine out at 120-125° was still super rare and yummy.

The method is great. I made some changes to the timing and the recipe. 

It is very important to let the meat come to room temperature before baking. 

Based on research, I estimated 35-45 minutes per pound. A 8.25 pound rib roast was done (132 degrees) in 4 1/2 hours at 200 degrees. In addition to dry brining the roast for 48 hours I made a paste of butter, chopped garlic, pepper and onion powder and smeared it all over the roast before putting it in the oven. I also rotated the roast from back to front at 2 hours and put more butter on top. 

The finished product was incredible. Melt in your mouth tender and beautifully juicy.  Rave reviews from everyone and I will definitely make it again.

I made this for Christmas Eve party. It was a hit.
1. I used Kosher Salt,  garlic, and dry rosemary
2. Still need to figure out estimated time for future.
My prime rib is 5.5 lbs. 
For this time, 2 hours in the room temperature is not enough to raise inside to the room temperature.
I started oven around 225-250 F for the first 30 mins or so, then lower it to around 200F-225 F.
 After a bit over 1.5 hours, the inside temperature reaches 125F. I  pulled it out around 130F to rest. It continues to around 135 F.
 
3. Put it back in 500 F oven. 
The inside is perfect.

For next time, I may use cast iron pan for the last step though.

I made this and loved the end result but it took a lot longer than the 3 1/2 hrs when cooking at 200 degrees. I cooked a 6lb roast with bones and it took close to 5 hrs to get the roast to 130 degrees internally. I have nothing but praise for the way the prime rib came out. Juicy and near perfection. I took the roast out 3 hrs prior to cooking to get it to room temperature. Just be prepared to cook it at 45 mins a pound.

I've used a few prime rib recipes over the years and this is the one. Definitely pay attention to the in's and out's on the oven timing and be sure to get a meat thermometer. I neglected to do the salt rub the night before and leave it in the fridge overnight. I discovered that instruction when I took the meat out to let it come up to room temperature, so I did the salt rub then and it was just fine. My kids - big guys in their 20s - absolutely loved this!  It was crispy on the outside, with perfect seasoning. I felt like an amazing cook!

I dry aged the beef for several days in advance, then followed more or less this recipe.   I love the reverse sear recipes for prime rib.   The herbs and butter in this recipe makes this roast have an excellent crust.

Easy, tasty and now the only way I will cook a prime rib. I loved the flexibility with the herbs in the butter.
Thanks. :)

it is the only way to make rib roast. Fool proof and you have all the time in the world to measure temp to cook the roast at the 'doneness' you want (medium rare)

It took a lot more time than expected to roast.
