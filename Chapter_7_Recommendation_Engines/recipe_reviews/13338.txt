FANTASTIC!!  Don't make the initial mistake that I did when I first read the recipe and assume that it's going to boring.  This made the perfect veggie soup and got rave, I mean RAVE, reviews!  I did add some frozen green beans and corn, used only beef broth and no water and simmered it for a little longer to let the flavors mesh, but that's all I changed.  Very good...You should try it.  You will be surprised.

Very easy, quick, and tasty soup.  I made a lot of changes,but I'm giving it 5 stars for the proportions and idea of using V8 as a base.  I sauteed an onion, some celery, carrots and garlic in olive oil, then added the liquids as stated.  I added two diced potatoes, a can of corn, some green beans, a can of diced tomatoes, and seasonings (salt, pepper, Italian seasoning.)  This soup couldn't be easier and gets rave reviews every time.

I LOVE this soup!  I've made it a number of times and it's always so satisfying.  I use 2 cups of chicken broth, use a 28 oz can of tomatoes, omit celery (don't like) and use frozen corn and green beens as well as the fresh carrots.  Sometimes I also saute a large onion in the bottom of the pot and then add everything else.  I also use the Spicy V8.  The creole seasoning really makes it - but I also add at least 1/2 tsp. of cayenne pepper for some kick.  If you love your veggies, then you will LOVE this soup!!!  Thanks!!

I've been looking for a tasty homemade vegetable soup recipe and I'm happy to say this one surpassed my expectations.  It's delicious, and even my hubby who HATES vegetable soup with every fibre of his being, enjoyed it.  He even had seconds.  I changed some ingredients, this seems to be a very adaptable recipe.  I used vegetable broth and V8, doubled the amount of these and omitted the water. 

 For veggies I used carrots, red potatoes, celery, fresh roma tomatoes, fresh green beans, one can of peas, and before I added anything to the pot I also sauteed a medium onion and two cloves of garlic in 1/4 cup of olive oil, based on suggestions from other reviewers.  

For spices I used cajun spice instead of creole (it was all I had), a bay leaf, oregano, garlic powder, a couple pinches of ginger, sea salt, and fresh ground black pepper.  I also chopped up about a tablespoon of fresh flat-leaf parsley and put that in.  I definitely see this soup in my future.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This is delicious!  I found a recipe for a cajun spice mix online by Google-ing it.  The only thing I changed was I made it in my crockpot, while I was away for the evening.  Oh - and I used peas instead of greenbeans, but just because that was what I had on hand.  It has very nice flavor.  You should try this recipe.  :)

This reminds me of a soup my grandpa used to make.  I substituted chicken stock for vegetable stock and threw in a chicken bullion cube.  And I exchanged some of the veggies for what I had on hand, but I think anything would turn out good.  Boyfriend loved it and even the kids who don't like veggies ate it without complaint.  So all in all, this may be my new go-to recipe for a quick and easy soup.

This soup is hearty, tastes good, and very easy to make. It goes real well with French bread or sandwiches such as BLT's. I have made it at least three times as my wife requests it specifically.

I really liked this vegetable soup!  As a New Orleanian, I use Tony Chacere's creole seasoning on everything!  That really helped to bring out the flavor in this soup.  I will slightly modify this recipe next time.  I will use more chicken broth because I found a lot of it evaporated when I simmered the soup.  I will simmer the soup for at least an hour so that the celery softens more.  I live on my own so I am constantly looking for recipes that are both healthy and economical.  This soup costs about $10 to make and it lasted 3 days for me!  This vegetable soup was healthy, economical, and delicious, easily making this recipe 5 stars!

This was really good!  Hearty, filling, and healthy.  I did add a little more celery and also a small can of peas, so I had to add more liquid.  I think some of it also boiled down some.  I added about one extra can of chicken broth and one extra can of the tomato cocktail (I used V8).  My husband did the shopping and brought home canned green beans, but next time I make this I will use fresh ones and I bet it will be even better!  This is a great diet food.  I'll be having some for lunch tomorrow.

i just made this for my family and got on here as soon as i could. wow. it is absolutly wonderful!! i didnt change anything about the recipe and my picky 6 year old, my soup hatin husband and I(i love soup) absolutly loved it, gonna be a regular in our menu!! what i did was i peeled and topped and bottomed the carrots, then cut them lenghtwise then chopped up relativly small(not too small) the celery i did the same thing, cut length wise then chopped up even smaller than the carrots, i didnt have diced tomatoes only whole peeled ones, so i drained the can in the soup pot, then diced them up and  think it was even better doing it that way then if i had used already diced tomatoes i used old bay seasoning added a little more salt and our favorite pepper(fiesta brand ground pepper) and it was wonderful. super filling, i did make some toast and put softned butter on it and it completed our meal with tall glasses of cold milk, im gonna share this recipe with the rest of the family! you gotta try it!!

This was very good - just the right amount of spiciness. I used cajun seasoning instead of creole, since that is what I had.  I also used frozen green beans, and threw in a little frozen ocra.  It's a very flexible recipe.  Used vegetable broth to make it vegetarian.

Very easy and delicious. It gets better as it sits in the fridge. Just add extra water when reheating and it makes an excellent good for you meal. I din't have the vegtable cocktail so I used I can of tomato sauce plus a can of water in place of. You'll still want to add the other cup of water. Also, you can save time by using a veg-all or mixed vegtable instead.

This recipe was quick, easy, and had tons of flavor. I didn't have any fresh green beans or corn so I used canned and used Cajun Creole Seasoning. It made the soup excellent! If you don't have any on hand the ingredients are: paprika, onion, garlic, black pepper, lemon peel, chile, allspice, thyme, cloves, mace, cayenne, and bay leaf.

I've made this soup a number of times over the past several months. This is my go-to vegetable soup recipe. The great thing about is there is so much room to improvise and add your personal touches to it. I brown stew beef in a little olive oil with salt, pepper, and garlic powder and before fully cooked add chopped carrots, onion, celery, mushroom, and frozen corn, peas, and green beans. I sautee together with some butter. When the meat is cooked and veggies are soft, I add a combo of both chicken and beef broth, along with more V8 then called for. I skip the water altogether. I add a couple dashes of hot sauce and Worcestshire, and diced Italian tomatoes. I seasoned with the Creole, as well as dill, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, paprika, two bay leaves, parsley, cayenne powder, and thyme, as well as more salt and pepper and 2 tsp. minced garlic, all to taste. Let it simmer for a while and DELICIOUS! My whole family loves it! Quick, easy, and very good. I'm only rating it four stars as I deviated from the recipes quite a bit, but don't be afraid to do that! Be creative!

I generally followed the recipe but made a few alterations. I started by browning some onions, and also added an extra can of diced tomatoes instead of the water. I also added turnip instead of green beans. And for a richer, thicker soup, I used condensed tomato instead of a tomato cocktail. The flavors were hearty, and between the cajun seasonings and a thick red-chili-cumin curry paste I added built a little heat. Awesome!

The base to this soup is good - then you can add all the different veggies you want.  I added more tomato vegetable juice and a couple chicken buillon cubes.  This simply is a soup you can adjust to your taste.

What a great recipe!  You can build on it and change it so easily based on what you have on hand.  I added some small pasta and next time I'll use barley.  I used diced tomatoes with Italian seasoning, some additional Italian seasoning and a bay leaf.  The Cajun seasoning is a must in this.

Loved this soup!  I was a little concerned that it would be too bland, but the Creole seasoning really gave it a great kick.  The only change I made was to add 1 can of drained/rinsed dark red kidney beans, other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent recipe- very easy, cheap and healthy. I found fresh Shiitake mushrooms at the store and decided to take a risk by adding a handful. Major success! The mushrooms provide a meaty addition if you are a fungus lover. I used cajun seasoning- about half a teaspoon- and about 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper. I skipped the celery, used fresh green beans and frozen corn, and threw in an extra carrot and it turned out AMAZING!

Excellent.  My hubby is a soup lover and he's pretty picky about his soups.  When I prepared this one, I was expecting him to say that it needed more this, less that.  He said that this was the BEST vegetable soup he's ever eaten.  The only adjustment I made was to add a 1/4 head of cabbage.  Congrats and Thank You!!!

This soup was delicious. I modified it only slightly, using all canned veggies except fresh carrots & celery. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken. As opposed to Creole seasoning, I used garlic and an Italian seasoning blend because I don't like spicy food very much. It was excellent last night and I am sure it will be better when I have the leftovers this evening!

Edit:  After trying the "Slow Cooker Beef Vegetable Soup" from this site (with or without the beef) I must say that we much prefer that recipe.  The Creole seasoning is a nice change, and everyone can add more to suit their own taste as it's served.  I did leave out the celery.

This recipe came out very tasty and was very easy and quick to prepare, as the title states.  I used sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes, and I added a yellow onion and about three cloves of garlic.  I'm a vegetarian, so I substituted the chicken broth and used two 14 ounce cans of vegetable broth and then added two "Not-Chick'N" bouillon cubes to give it more flavor.  I used more carrots and green beans than the recipe called for.  I also didn't use the Creole seasoning only because I forgot to buy some, but it still came out very well.

Great tasting, healthy soup.  I used turkey broth for the water, 1 T "Creole Seasoning Blend" (from this site), 1 cup cooked Bulgar wheat for the potato, and used V8 Spicy Hot.

I added 1/4 cup of barley and I really enjoyed the thick consistency.  I didn't have a Creole mix of spices, so I added cayenne, black pepper, garlic and onion salt, cumin, and some oregano.  Very tasty!

Even though I changed a bit of this recipe this is a great soup!!! I used tomato sauce as someone else had done because I didn't have the cocktail drink on hand. I also used Emerils Original Essence to flavor it. Oh this was so good my little 4 year old loved it and my husband finished it off! Will do this one again and again!

This was very tasty!  I used Vegetable Broth instead of Chicken Broth, and I added an additional cup instead of a cup of water. I also added 1 chopped medium onion, and used Lawrey's Seasoning Salt instead of Creole seasoning.  I will definitely make this again.

This was such a great recipe!  I had just gotten back from a trip to Spain and was desperately craving some veggies (after eating tons of bread, ham and fish for two weeks) and found this recipe.

It turned out to be delicious!  I left out the creole seasoning (because I didn't have any) and added in a small can of peas, small can of corn and some garlic.  I would highly recommend this!

Absolutely fantastic!!  Exactly what I was looking for to get my 6 servings of veggies in a day.  I used the spicy hot V-8 juice and it was a good kick.  I'll probably make this at least once a week.  Thanks!!!

Very good.  Can add chicken.  Water is not necessary.  Can leave out potato and add pasta or noodles.  Done in slow cooker in a few hours.

My family LOVES this soup!  The creole seasoning gives it just the right flavor.  It's great that I can use whatever fresh vegetables I have on hand or frozen, and it still tastes fantastic!

I did make a few changes, but this soup was awesome! I threw the celery and half an onion into the soup pan to brown first with one clove of garlic. I also added a can of kidney beans and used spicy V8 instead of the regular stuff. This gave it just enough of a kick for us. We ate this for dinner with a loaf of fresh baked French bread...will definitely be doing this meal again soon :)

Excellent base to build on, especially if you love tomato based veggie soups.  I use beef broth instead of chicken, and this time I used a soup bone which I browned first first some cloves of garlic and a bay leaf.  I usually add 3 bay leaves and some whole black peppercorns to the soup as well, and I also add some barley.  Oh, and half a small head of chopped cabbage- perfect.  Yum, delicious on a cold day.

This soup is awesome! I take ideas from this site all the time and I read a ton of reviews. People always make a change but I love to make it the way it was meant to taste. I want to taste what the chef had on his/her pallet. This is my favorite veg soup so far. I changed one thing and its the broth to vegetable(I'm vegetarian) and it was still blowing my guests away. Kudos to you, great meal.

What a great easy recipe for a delicious soup! I love the idea of using V8 vegetable juice as the base, and since I bought a six-pack I have started experimenting with using it in other recipes such as beef stew and Spanish rice. This is a versatile base recipe that I intend to change up a little each time based on seasonal vegetables or what I have on hand. I definitely recommend subbing broth for the water for added flavor, and I like to throw in some extra spices like garlic salt, Italian seasoning, and aromatic bitters as well. Overall I think this a great recipe to use with fresh vegetables or just whatever you have in the freezer and pantry, and it always makes a healthy and flavorful soup.

Despite seeing all the rave reviews, I was expecting a ho-hum soup. Not so! It is wonderfully good - the key really is the creole seasoning, so don't skip it! I didn't have that on hand so I just did a simple google search and found out how to make it myself. I didn't even use all the ingredients for the creole seasoning and the soup was still great!

10 Stars! The only thing different I used was V8. Excellent and almost like my mom used to make. When the weather gets colder I will use Spicy V8 instead. A must try soup!

Wonderful recipe!  I made it just as suggested the first time.  Second time, I substituted a can of condensed tomato soup for the water- it gave it a little more substance.  Served it with warm rolls.  Perfect!

It was easy, but we didn't care for the taste of the broth.  We don't normally drink V8 and didn't know what that tasted like, so I guess that could be why.

This soup is very disappointing and I'm surprised by all the positive reviews.  It is very bland, even with the Creole seasoning, but I have noticed MANY of the reviewers said they made adjustments.  I have to say this is just a real boring soup and it takes alot for me to say anything edible is boring!  My husband agrees with me as well..I would try a different recipe!

This is a great base. But I added a lot more vegetables! 2 potatoes, 3 large carrots, a medium sized onion, and 2 14 oz cans of whole kernel corn. I also used Vegetable Broth rather than chicken. But the Spicy v8 really makes an awesome base. I needed a little more tomato juice due to my increase in veggies, and to make it a bit more creamy I added approx. 1/4 cup whipping cream. It turned out AWESOME, and we've made this recipe a few times. This is our favorite version!

Absolutely fantastic! I had mandatory vegetable soup in a diet I had to do and this was a great option. I didn'te even feel I was in a diet. I used more celery, because I love it, and no can tomatoes. I also used the spicy can jice version.

Oh my word, this was delicious.  My hubby started it and accidentally added a 46 oz bottle of V8 instead of 1 can and I just can't imagine how thick it would've been without the extra juice.  We added 2 cubes of beef buillion and prob 2 T of cajun seasoning to make up for the extra juice.  It was great and reminded me of the deli soup I used to have in my hometown, except they added beef stew meat and cabbage, which I will definitely try next time.  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!

I just made this soup. It's delicious. I doubled the recipe, but tripled all the liquids since we like lots of broth. I substituted beef broth for the water. I also added a grated onion. The onion makes a world of difference in the taste. And, I added 1 teaspoon Tony Chachere's Original Creole Seasoning and 1 teaspoon Italian Seasoning. The Creole Seasoning gives it quite a bit of heat. This is a really good recipe.

I loosely followed the Creole spice mix given in one of the reviews and added a can of creamed corn.  I was going to use a can of corn but I ended up opening a canned of creamed corn by accident.  It turned out GREAT!  A happy mistake.  Very healthy and very filling.

My husband is not a veggie lover but he rated this soup 5 Stars.
I thought it was yummy but needs to simmer much longer. Oh, I added peas  and tomato soup instead of V8 juice. I think it would be good as the recipe given also.

I lost count of the number of times I made this soup this past winter.  I never used creole seasoning since I don't have any, but everyone loved it regardless. I used frozen veggies a lot and usually whatever I had on hand.  I still can't believe how easy this is and how delicious it tastes.

I like a good, basic vegetable soup, but no one in my family does, so I made this with beef broth, ommitted the Creole seasoning and added some browned ground beef. Very good and filling! Serve with corn muffins on the side and chocolate pudding (homemade, of course)for dessert, and it's a good, basic meal. I don't thinkt his would have very much flavor made with chicken broth.

4 Stars for the 
'quick & easy" part...needs a little boost in the seasonings.  I added jamaica jerk blend to add a kick. Experiment with your own seasonings - it's a great base to build on.

Awesome!! My fiancee and his best friend went crazy about this soup!! Both had THREE servings! I did make a couple changes, omitted the celery, used canned corn and added a tsp. of cayenne pepper. I also threw the diced pototes in 10 minutes before the other veggies. I will be making this again and again. Thanks for sharing Anne!! :)

I just made this on a snowy day with what veggies I had on hand, so I used frozen peas instead of green beans, left out the potato, and added some diced leftover ham & minced garlic. It came out great! YUM

Thank you for a vegetable soup recipe that does not have beef in it!  I've made this two times and really like it.  I used vegetable broth and cajun spice the first time (didn't have creole).  I bought some creole seasoning for the second batch and like that better.

Great vegetable soup. My husband loves onions and hates corn, so I sauteed a small onion in the stockpot as my first step. Then I used spicy Hot V-8, and it gave the soup a spicy kick. I also omitted the corn. For Salt, Pepper, and Creole Seasoning to taste, I used a half teaspoon, one-quarter teaspoon, and one teaspoon respectively. Delicious. I will be making this again.

LOVE!! Add whatever, it's going to be great! I sauteed the onion, carrots and celery first. Then added the rest along (my tomatoes had green chilis in the can) with a bag of frozen spinach, chick peas, some kidney beans, a little leftover tomato paste, and enough V8 and water to cover. It cooked for about 3 hrs on low to blend the flavors. Nothing was wilted or mushy. The first batch isn't gone yet but my husband is requesting another go round already.

My favorite vegetable soup from now on - seriously, this just has the right combination/ratio of tomato flavor and the Creole seasoning is key.  Love it and have already made it three more times - oh and I add a can of rinsed white beans for more protein and fiber.

This soup is so wonderful. Very thick and loaded with veggies. The only change I made, which probably made it thicker, I used tomatoe paste (small can) because I didn't have any tomato juice. I have to say this is by far my hubbies favorite veggie soup and that is saying a lot because both his mom and grandmom are fabulous cooks. Definitely a keeper!!!

I didn't have tomato-vegetable juice so I used used 1/2 cup of water and 1/2 cup of tomato sauce mixed together. Also, I added some elbow noodles. It turned out very well! Such a good tasting broth!

I'm sorry but I did not like this recipe at all. I love V8, but for me, it does not belong in a soup. After making the recipe as directed (starting with 1/2 tsp Cajun seasoning) I tried everything to doctor it up (more seasoning, broth, etc.), but after a few days of retrying it, no success. Unfortunately, I will not be making this soup again.

This was really tasty. I did substitute pureed homemade tomato sauce for the V8 & diced tomatoes (just because I was trying to get rid of it) but I doubt that makes a big difference.  The chicken stock base & Creole seasoning make a big difference in this from the more traditional soup my mom makes, giving a more exotic taste. Still great with peanut butter sandwiches!

I absolutely loved this recipe! I did add a few changes that made it sooo yummy. I sauteed the onion and some minced garlic before adding the soup and vegetables. I added a few red pepper flakes because I like that extra kick. Then I added a 1/4 tsp. of chili powder. Needless to say, there was none left! Thank you!

This is a great 'jumping off point'.  I took this model and added hot pepper flakes, skipped the water and doubled the chicken stock.  It is really great served with rice.  Yum.

Great soup!  The creole and the V8 make this soup's broth very good.  You could add any vegetable to it, and it would still be good.

Not sure why, but this one didn't work for me.  I love this type of soup and I'm addicted to V8, but by the time the veggies were tender - and they were diced small - all the broth was gone.  Not very flavorful either.  I added a cup of water with bouillion and that bumped up the flavor, but I'll keep looking for a veggie soup recipe.

Finally a veggie soup that has flavor! I used 1 can of low sodium V8 juice, added garlic powder, a few shakes of cayanne pepper, used 1 c. each of frozen corn and green beans and 1/2 of an onion chopped. After cooking I let it sit in the fridge overnight so the flavors would meld together and I brought it for lunch today and it tastes great with a little cheese.

Didn't have the seasoning so I bought the hot and spicy V8. Also put green peppers in it instead of fresh green beans. Thats what I had in my fridge.
Was spicy from the V8 juice. I loved it but I like spicy. The gets a good rating from me but next time will add some pasta I think Need more then veggies for a hearty winter soup.

I love this soup--it's a great "go-to" meal for using up odds and ends of leftover meats and veggies. I use "Emeril's Essence" instead of Creole seasoning--it was just what I had on hand the first time I made it, and it provided just the right flavor.

This soup tastes almost exactly like my mother's vegetable stew (minus the meat)!  I also sauteed some onion before adding everything to the pot because I love onions.  (I also omitted the Creole seasoning) Tasted great!  Thank you!

Wow. What an awesome basic soup! I used low-sodium, fat free chicken broth and added a cup of peas in with it. It's extremely versatile and you could change and substitute ingredients easily. I seriously recommend this healthy soup. Almost no effort, but tastes great! Thanks so much!

absolutely excellent. I doubled the recipe and I used canned creamed corn and v-8. Added a bit of onion and cooked turkey and seasoned with a couple tablespoons leftover NC-style barbecue sauce (i.e. worchestershire sauce, vinegar, cayenne, mustard, lemon juice & catsup).

I am trying to get my husband to eat healthier by moving away from beef and pork to turkey. He absolutely hates turkey anything. As a healthy eater I cook everyday and out of all the meals that I have made in our 2 months together he said this was number one on the list. It even beat out my chicken potpie which until this was number one and stuffed pasta shells. The only changes thats I made to the recipe was to season and steam the fresh green beans and carrots before placing them in the broth. He loves lima beans so we also added them as well as doubled the potatoes. I also added doubled the broth to support the additional veggies.  When it was just me I would have enough to freeze and reheat throughout the winter. Guess that will not happen this time.

Have made this soup 2x now. I sauté onions, add the chopped celery, but for the remaining veggies, I throw in a 16 oz package of frozen mixed vegetables. Also add 1/2-1 T of Creole Seasoning and 1/2 t pepper. Fabulous soup! I have a vegan in the house, so offer beans and chopped meat on the side for adding to the soup.

It came out too thin and watery which made too plain. Maybe omitting the water would help idk. I started adding some other spices to see if would give it more flavor, which did help but I just couldn't get past how thin it was. I'll pass on this one.

I used canned cubed potatoes, green beans, corn and freshly sliced carrots and celery. Real time saver and easy as can be to have dinner ready in almost no time.  This was such a good soup with a crusty whole grain roll on the side. It was a little spicy but we like spicy.  Adding to my regular meatless Monday rotation. Thanks for posting this really great soup.

Great soup! I did make a couple adjustments. Left out the tomato-veggie juice cocktail. Added peas, and 1 chicken bullion cube. Instead of creole, I used a combination of pepper, garlic power, onion powder, and cajun seasoning. It came out amazing! I feel like I got way more than 6 servings, more like 8-10. Also cooked for about 1 1/2 hours. Very filling and healthy soup, less than 200 calories per serving, with some good fiber and protein thrown in there.

I made this because it said it was quick and easy and I wanted to impress my visiting parents, and impress it did! So simple and so good, they were raving about the soup I made for our lunch as we sat in a fancy restaurant for dinner. It went great with a fresh loaf of french bread. I made it the night before and warmed it up on the stove top to serve. When I was taste-testing as I cooked it up, I worried that I messed up the creole seasoning that I'd made, but as it cooked it settled into a very warm tasting soup, not overly spicy but not bland either. Such an easy and healthy soup, the recipe doesn't need any adaptations to make a  total crowd pleaser! Will make again.

This had great flavor.  I think I messed up because I put onions and peppers in and I didn't sweat them long enough so they were still a little crunchy.  Oh well, all in all a wonderful recipe, thanks!

Amazing recipe!! 
I had to make some modifications because I did not have everything in my pantry.
I substituted V8 for tomato paste. I added 1 1/2 cups of fresh tomato purée that I had made because I had no canned diced tomatoes. I used beef bouillon because I had no stock. I added all veggies and including a can of black beans. I used a mixture of seasonings that previous reviewers mentioned and added a tsp. of cumin. 

I served in soup mugs and topped with shredded mozzarella cheese. It melted soooooo deliciously!!! Everyone loved what I whipped together in a mere 30 mins!

I cooked this for a large group of 50 and got rave reviews!!!!  It's a very tasty and brothy soup, although, I didn't use the Creole seasoning as I'm not fond of using too many spices to cover up the vegetable and natural taste of the juices.

Yum! Easy, healthy and tasty homemade soup. I did substitute onions for corn because that just makes more sense to me.

I know it's not completely fair to rate a recipe when you don't follow it exactly, but this was so good and I only made the changes because I was desperate and didn't want to go back to the store:)  I didn't have everything in the house and, since snow was coming, I used what I had.  I didn't have any green beans, so those were omitted.  Also, based on what I had on hand, I used beef broth instead of chicken broth.  I also had some fresh thyme and rosemary and threw that in.  Really good and just what I wanted on a cold day!

Yummy soup.  Just made a few changes:  sauteed the carrot and celery until crisp tender.  Added frozen green beans and corn, the potato and spices (I made my own creole seasoning from allrecipes).  Added can fire roasted tomatoes, doubled the chicken broth - no water added, and the V-8.  Added fresh grated parm on top for extra yumminess.

I loved this recipe but I made a few changes. First of all I made it into a chicken vegetable soup. I diced up two boneless skinless chicken breasts, then sauteed them in a tablespoon of olive oil until cooked. Then I added the chicken to the other ingredients. I also omitted the water and replaced it with another 14 oz can of reduced sodium chicken broth. 

I replaced the green beans with one cup of frozen lima beans. Since these take a bit longer to get tender I brought the liquid to a boil, then added the lima beans and cooked them for a couple of minutes first, then I added the other ingredients. And I made one more change. I omitted the Creole seasoning and replaced the V8 juice with low sodium Spicy Hot V8 juice.

This makes a rather spicy dish. If you prefer yours to be not so spicy you might want to use regular V8 juice and then a small amount of Creole seasoning. 

This goes great with a fresh loaf loaf of french bread.

Great soup!  Even the kids loved it.  I've made it twice now with some variations each time and it's a great starter soup to tweak with whatever ingredients you have on hand.  I added a boneless chicken breast and shredded it for a very hearty stew-like soup.  I doubled the recipe and packed it for lunches and freezed part of it in mason jars for future easy meals.  I also added some other ingredients to my bowl for an easy change to a mexican soup:  sprinkled chili powder, dried cilantro, squeeze of lime juice, some shredded monterrey jack cheese and some avocado.  Yummy!  Better than restaurant quality.  Would probably be yummy with some crushed corn chips too.  Next time.

Quick and tasty...just the way I like dinner. As always, I use a mix of miso and Better Than Bouillon Veggie in place of broth. Instead of adding corn, I made up a pkg of matzo balls.

I love this vegetable soup! I must say the creole seasoning sets it apart, and it is virtually guilt free. I usually don't like reviews that totally revamp the recipe, but I did make some subtle adjustments which kicked it up a notch. They included: adding 1 cut up summer squash, 1.5 cups Bob's Red Mill Vegi Soup Mix (just alphabet pasta, split peas, and lentils-no seasoning), 1 small onion diced, some frozen green beans, and a can of garbanzo beans. All of these made wonderful additions, but the great thing is that this soup is so versatile and tasty that you can make it what you want! ALSO freezes well :)

This recipe is REALLY SPICY!  I even cut the spices in half and still had to add sour cream in my bowl because of the heat.  It's good, not great. Not a fan of celery due to the bitterness so omitted it, but V8 has loads of it in it.  I used all fresh veggies which I could barely taste due to the heat.

This soup is excellent, I made it in the evening for the next day but when I got home from work the next day it was gone!  I followed the recipe pretty closely except (always something) I didn't have V8 juice so used 1 can tomato sauce.  Also, didn't add salt with all the canned veggies, no need.  The first time I made it without potato or celery, but second time I made sure to get some to get the full flavors.  Both times, it was excellent and I will be making this many more times I am sure.

i made this for my husband who is a very picky eater and he loved it said it was the best thing i have ever made. i followed another reviewers advice and sauteed onions, garlic and mushrooms first then followed the recipe but made it vegan with vegetable broth(i made my own creole seasoning) but using tomato vegetable juice cocktail (V8) is genius, thanks for this one

We have made this twice this winter and really love it.  I like to add about a cup of dried pasta at the end, and more water if needed, just to make it go further.  I usually have a zucchini laying around to throw in as well.  You can't go wrong with this!  Also, if you don't have creole seasoning, you can search for Emeril's essence seasoning or any creole seasoning blend online.   I had all the spices needed to make it myself on hand.

Yum! This was really good. I was a little scared of the V8 (since I don't like it as a drink), but it turned out great. I took a tip from another reviewer, and pureed it for my toddler and topped with shredded mozzerella, and she loved it! I froze a portion and it reheated great...just have to add some water or broth.

Great! Only change I made was I pureed soup to "fool" my kids. They like it like this or with a little rice or pasta and a small amount of Velvetta. Excellent way to get your families veggies in!

Very good and easy.  My only suggestion is to add the cajun seasoning slowly and keep tasting it.  I put too much in and it was too spicy so I just added more chicken broth and V8 and it was fine.

Quick and Easy. Husband loved it. Said it was the best he has ever had. I browned bite size stew meat, 1 onion, TBSP garlic in bottom of soup pot until meat was brown.  Added remainder of ingredients with a little more liquid to compensate for the added meat. Delicious.

I was so surprised at how great this is!  So easy and tasty.  I'll never buy canned soup again.  I did use whole peeled tomatoes in place of juice.

Very good soup! I added more water and tomato juice to get more broth but otherwise it was easy and excellent!

Outstanding!!!  my 8 & 7 year olds said, "Dad!!, this is the best you've made in a long time!"  The key is fresh ingredients ... not canned ... but I did add canned field beans & navy beans.  All other ingredients were fresh.  Skinned & diced tomatoes ... so much better than canned.  Instead of creole seasoning I added paprika, garlic salt, tobasco (a little), and bay leaf.  Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow ...  I doubled the recipe.  Get some French baguette bread to dip!!

This is the yummiest and easiest soup to make. I just add a can of potatoes instead of fresh and add spicey V8 to give it kick.

This had a great flavor, however the next time I might just use half the vegetable juice it called for.  That flavor was predominant.  It is a good base to use and then add whatever vegetables you have on hand.

I am always looking for ways to get more veggies in our diets and this was a great quick and yummy way to accomplish that! I didn't have creole seasoning, so I used Cajun seasoning and ground cayenne pepper to taste. Delicious!

Very good! One thing I like is that is a very versatile recipe .. you can use just about any vegetable that you like.  I did add a tsp of red cayene pepper as suggested in one of the reviews and that made the soup just a bit too spicy.  I will cut it back to a 1/2 tsp next time because it does add a nice flavor.  Will make again!!!

This recipe was great!!  I was really impressed-- it was better than I thought it'd be.  Some things I did differently were 1) sprinkled with garlic powder and dropped in a bay leaf before simmering, and 2) I used canned diced tomatoes with Italian seasonings.  This is an awesome recipe because it's so easy to adjust and make it to your taste.  Thanks, Anne!

I can't say that I was overly impressed with this recipe.  I had to improvise on some of the veggies, but it just tasted bland to me.  I think I could have done just as well or better on my own without even using a recipe.  Sorry.

I have tried several vegetable soup recipes from here and this is by far my favorite.  I like my vegetable soups simple with a tomato base and this one does just that.  I used tomato juice instead of the tomato-vegetable juice and added diced steak to make it a complete meal.  The whole family loved it (even my 17 month old and three year old)!

This is an amazingly good soup considering how simple and fast it is to prepare.  I added lots more veggies to the pot along with several Italian spices and it was terrific.  This is a wonderful vegetarian soup with lots of flavor.  Thanks, Anne.

Very, very good. I don't like V-8, so I used regular tomato sauce instead, and added a little bit of chili powder to the mix.

I followed the recipe pretty close, except added some water and bouillion when the broth seemed to be boiling off. Also, I didn't buy creole seasoning, and just dumped some stuff from the shelf into the soup.  It ended up a little spicy due to a little too much cayenne, but we like spice so it was still very good.  I'll definitely make this again, quick and easy and very good.

I made this with frozen carrots, peas, asparagus, shelled edamame, and corn. A can of green beans, fresh russet potatoes, and some gluten free spaghtetti. I love that you can put any veggies you like and it's so filling but without feeling like you ate unhealthy!

Awesome and easy to make.  Even the teen who doesn’t like vegetables, ate it. I substituted and used vegetable stock and also added kale.  It’s our new favorite.

Fantastic! Easily adaptable to what you have on hand as well.   I added a can of okra, corn and tomatoes, a can of diced tomatoes, a whole bunch of fresh bok choy, half a bag of frozen mixed veggies, etc.    Definite do over!

Big hit with my family. I didn’t use as many fresh ingredients. It was a let’s use whatI have in my pantry kind of night but it was still delicious. Will definitely make again.

So easy. It’s my go to quick meal. Can serve with grilled cheese or add meat. It’s alway good. I use frozen vegetable soup mix instead of the cans of vegetables.

Amazing!  How can this taste so good?  I didn’t have creole season, so I used Cajun and it was awesome! It’s easy to add some mini noodles and hamburger, which I did the second time.  You just can’t go wrong with this recipe!

Broth was rich and very tasty. Will use a little less creole seasoning next time, will definitely be a next time. I also added some sautéed onion and cooked barley.  Very good and hearty.

I followed the recipe as directed. It was so flavorful! I will be making this regularly. I went a little heavy on the creole spice, so I'll go lighter on that next time. That was my fault, but it was so delicious! It's so easy to make.

yum and yum! we added a bag of frozen, chopped kale (because I had some on hand) probably doubled the veggies (we like chunky soups and stews) then doubled the recipe so we could share with another family. otherwise no changes. great starter so you can do your own thing- add meat, pastas, more veggies, garlic, onions, etc. GREAT RECIPE.

Good, healthy and easy. Takes longer to cook (I would allow at least an hour).  As others suggested, I used the Creole Seasoning Blend from this site. 1 Tablespoon of the Creole Seasoning Blend was about at my spicy limit but my husband would have liked more. I also added some cooked pasta.  I will be making this again, for sure.

Really good and really easy. I followed the recipe. The only exception is that I added some cut okra to it as well. Okra pairs well with the tomatoes. Otherwise, it was hit in my family!

Love this soup. Made it over and over this winter. Used receipt as written except I’m vegetarian so used vegetable broth. Last time I didn’t have any potatoes so used bow- tie pasta. Still very good.

Great vegetable soup. I did sauté the onions, carrots, and celery in a bit of olive oil beforehand and subbed lima beans instead of green beans. Used vegetable stock in place of chicken. Other than that followed recipe as is. Seasoning really makes this.

Doesn't last more than two days, my Mom started making this recipe some years back while I was still in Middle school now that I've moved in with a vegetarian (I  use vegetable stock if he's gonna eat some), it makes dinner easy for me something I can quickly throw together.

I followed the recipe and didn't like it. It was definitely missing something. I was able to save it by adding minced garlic, spinach, a onion, and parsley. I know this doesn't make it a vegetable soup but I added rotisserie chicken. It was a great save otherwise it would have ended up in the trash. No complaints from my kids.

I'm not a huge fan of vegetable soup, but this was SO good!  The only actual change I made was using vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, because it's what I had.  I also added some beef that I cubed and browned in minced garlic to make it vegetable-beef soup.  Even my picky kids ate it!

This recipe is so easy and so versatile! It is amazingly delicious with fresh summer vegetables and it's just as good with frozen/canned vegetables in the winter! We eat it with cornbread and it is my total favorite soup recipe! (I also love being able to control the sodium, which is my biggest issue with canned soups)

I basically stuck to the recipe.  I used only vegetables I grew in my garden (with the exception of the corn which I bought at a local farmers market-sweet and delicious, I was eating it as I took it off the cob, celery  and the potatoes) carrots, green beans, tomatoes. I did eliminate the water and used chicken broth in its place.  Bottom line: there is absolutely no reason to use cajun spices or spiced tomato juice.  They only mask the flavor of those fresh delicious vegetables, they do not enhance those flavors. Im making it again this week because fresh vegetables season in nearing an end and I know this will be 5 stars without the unnecessary heat.

Absolutely delicious. I am not a big soup eater. Ever since I made this, I can't get enough of it. I gave some to my brother and his wife. She is now asking for the recipe.

I was craving some vegetable soup and this was perfect! I doubled the liquids and added some pasta. I used all the listed vegetables - all fresh. I let it simmer for about an hour.

I sautéed the onions in olive oil before adding them to the pot. I substituted green peas for beans and used spicy V8. Thanks for the recipe :)

Delic! I didn't have V8 so I used tomato sauce and extra water, plus both beef and chicken broth for the liquid. I sauteed a whole onion and fresh garlic, and then added the rest of the ingredients. I used up some leftover broccoli and a yellow squash and added to the other veggies, and made the creole seasoning that another reviewer suggested. Both myself and hubby enjoyed it. It made a lot, and I'm looking forward to bringing it for lunch!

I made this recipe as stated, as I feel you should always do that the first time. I liked everything about it except the seasoning. I used 1 tsp. of creole seasoning and even though I love it in other dishes, in this soup I just didn't. But it was easy and delicious otherwise.

Quick easy and really yummy. I added to much Creole seasoning so to counter it I added two tablespoons of ketchup for the acid. It actually toned it down and brought out the tomatoe flavor. I also threw in a cup of elbow macaroni and some lima beans.  I will make it again without a doubt

I will definitely make this again. Easy, easy recipe that has a great flavor. I doubled the recipe, used onion and peppers, a large pack of frozen mixed vegetables, chicken stock, diced tomatoes, v8, and added one large baking potato. In addition to New Orleans seasoning blend, added bay leaf, garlic, and some Italians herbs. I omitted the water, and stirred in some chopped flat parsley at the end.  It  is really hearty.

Really good and simple. I didn’t have diced tomatoes so I chopped up a 28oz can of whole San Marzano tomatoes. I also didn’t have a can of V8 so I figured the whole 28oz can of tomatoes would account for this as well 14oz + 11 oz). I added a couple dashes of onion powder and chili powder and about 1/4 cup white wine.

I thought this was good as it (w/o the celery-yuck!) was but the second time I omitted the potato and the extra cup of water and changed the veggies to what I had on hand, which was a bag of frozen mixed veggies.  I also added shredded chicken.  AMAZING!  This makes a great soup that freezes well so I can grab a container on the way to work - I like to mix it with a pack of ramen noodles to make it more hearty for work lunches.   Also consider playing with the seasoning to spice it up to your liking.

made it w/o potatoes nor creole as I didn't have these on hand. Try it with water chestnuts for added crunch! Also added some dried oregano, onion & garlic powders & thyme. This is my go-to veg soup recipe bc u can clean out frozen bags of vegs & the soup has a very good shelf life as well as rave reviews!

This recipe was super easy and tasty! I basically doubled all the servings of vegetables, substituted the tomatoes for cabbage (not the biggest fan of tomatoes), added about a cup of lentils and a few extra spices. I used a 32oz carton of chicken broth, a 32oz carton of vegetable broth along withe about 3 cups of the vegetable/V8 juice. I did this to accommodate the extra servings of vegetables as well as the lentils I added. I am very happy with how it turned out.

I used vegetable stock instead of chicken - and it was really good.  The creole seasoning combined with V-8 gives it a nice kick.   It’s a keeper.

This soup is AMAZING!!!  I mean - it's almost perfect the way it is. I've made it and people have said "I think this is probably better than my mama's" LOL! I use the V8 (not regular tomato juice) and I add a little of Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning (can be found in walmart). That seasoning is the perfect touch!! It's an easy soup, takes about an hour, and absolutely delicious. If' you're trying to find a good recipe that people will love, no need to keep searching!

I made this the other day, and I wasn't very impressed with the recipe.  This didn't' taste like Vegetable soup like I remember. There wasn't no Flavor to it, It was just a batch of Vegetables with no real flavor. I even used a Can of Diced Tomatoes with Roasted Garlic and Onions in it and Beef Stew Cubes to give it a Beefy flavor.  This recipe is missing something as far as spices are concerned. I used 2 Bags of Frozen Vegetables. I'll probably make again and adjust this recipe where it has more flavor to it to make it better.

this recipe was extremely easy. I added a little red pepper flake to give it a little kick in and made it delicious. I will definitely make this again.

The only change I made was adding beef cubes. I browned the beef and onion in olive oil first, then added the rest of the ingredients. The seasonings were simple and perfect. I always add a little sugar when using tomato juice, just our preference.

I put  a pretty good sized amount of creole seasoning in it - but it is homemade and clumpy, so i don't know exactly how much. I pressure cooked 2 qts of chicken broth with 1 cup of soup mix and a can of tomatoes and the creole seasoning.  Then I moved that to the stovetop and added more water, 2 potatoes, a bag of frozen corn, 2 stalks of celery, 2 carrots.  Served with drop biscuits.  Very good.  Will make again - I have a lot of dry soup mix to use up - the kind with alpha noodles, lentils, rice and split peas.

Great recipe, very simple to throw together. I doubled the tomato cocktail juice and the water, and most of the veggies since we like our soups more chunky. As far as veggies, to cut down on time, I used frozen corn and green beans, fresh celery and around 75% of one large yellow onion, all finely diced with some fresh garlic. I used canned carrots, peas, and diced potatoes, diced tomatoes, etc. This helped shorten the time considerably and the soup still tasted fantastic. I did follow the tips in the comments section, by adding certain seasonings, like creole, pepper, garlic powder, and I threw in a bay leaf, but I left out other seasonings people recommended because of not particularly liking them. I did use V8 reduced sodium as well. It turned out great! Thanks for the recipe!

My mistake was adding  large quantity of seasoning while it was boiling and too hot to taste. Love it anyway but would cut down on the seasoning. Also I used Spicy Hot V8 juice for extra kick ! Next time I might add some shrimp toward the end of the cooking cycle.

This was delicious and the base is perfect! It did not disappoint. Only thing I did differently was use spicy hot v8 juice for a kick and omitted the water.

Delicious! If you can cook it longer the more the flavors meld. I had to modify because I didn't have V8 so I used a can of tomato sauce (not spaghetti sauce) and put a little more water to get the flavor right. Such a versatile recipe.

Easy and flavorful. I doubled the batch and basically threw in any veggies I had around the house, spinach, sweet pot, lima beans, peas. I used mostly frozen veggies. My kids loved it. I used a creole spice recipe that was given on this site but did not use all the cayenne pepper as my hubby dislikes it. It was very easy and will make for a great lunch tomorrow.

I made this the first time yesterday during a snowstorm, and my husband loved it!  Made a double recipe today so there was extra to freeze. Very easy to make. I actually used frozen cut green beans and corn to make it quicker and added onion.  This will definitely be my go-to vegetable soup recipe.

After my husband was put on a low purine diet I looked for recipes that would be healthy and tasty. This fits the bill. I make it exactly as the recipe states with no exceptions.

Easy to make and very flavorful.  Creole Spice gives it a mild kick.  I've made this twice now and it keeps well.  Can easily be supplemented with other vegetables, chicken or beef if desired.

This is the perfect supper for those cold winter nights.  I did change a couple things.  I used spicy v8, stew meat and beef stock.

All the kiddos in the neighborhood loved it. I may have used too much Creole seasoning (admittedly I did not measure) but otherwise it was good. Very easy. Pretty much have everything in the pantry or fridge.

Hubby and I thought it was very good. I took one reviewer's advice and added a second can of chicken broth but I think it was the wrong decision. It "watered" it down. Besides tasting good, the visual was beautiful. It was so bright and colorful! Yes, I will make it again.

Very good, even though I made some changes. I added some ground beef, which I browned in with onion and garlic. Then I added it into my soup pot along with chicken broth, high fiber V-8 cocktail, half bottle Dos Equis beer, potatoes, corn, more onion (I'm an onion freak lol), carrots, and instead of green beans I used zucchini. For seasonings I used a store bought Creole seasoning, paprika, garlic powder, celery seed (because I forgot real celery when I went to the store), and salt and pepper. Let it simmer for a few hours and man this was good. Next time I will add more seasonings because I aired on the side of caution and didn't use as much, so it was on the bland side but still good! Love a healthy soup!

Very good soup. The v-8 makes a great base. My wife is always requesting it and I don't mind making it because it is so easy. I double the recipe and all the ingredients are between  $15-$20 at my local "discount" farmers market!  I do add onions, okra and sometimes fresh garbanzo beans cooked previously.

I've made this 3 times so far for my family and I keep tweaking it, every time it gets better. What a great recipe. I've never added water or corn, just more v8 or chicken broth. It's a fantastic starter recipe and then make it your own. I don't measure things out ( I'm Italian)

It was just an average veggie soup for me but I gave it 5 stars because it was very cheap and easy.  doubled it and used canned green bean, corn, and peas.  For the tomato/veggie juice I used low sodium original V8.  I brought it to a boil then let it simmer on  low for 2hrs.  Some of the potatoes and celery were still a little hard so next time I will let it simmer even longer.

Very good and simple!  I sautéed onions in the pan first, then added all ingredients (except celery). It's pretty spicy with the regular Rotel, it's a good thin tomato vegetable soup!!

I have made this soup as a base and is very good. I've given it to my co workers and they liked it also.  I added red pepper flakes and some butternut squash that I had to use up. A different twist but gods none the less.  I topped or with sour cream and that was also good. So,  there's are endless possibilities.  I even pureed it to make a cream base which worked out well.  I've made this a bunch of times and don't think I've made of the same way too often

I love this soup. I have made it exactly as the recipe dictates and its delish. Even my young nephew asked for seconds! Now that I do low carb, I made adjustments to the veggies - I use squash, zucchini, celery, broccoli, and cauliflower. Still a household favorite.

I really like this soup. I made it for the beginning of Thanksgiving week, knowing we would need something healthy before the holiday eating started. It is filling and low cal. A few changes: used spicy V8 and added a can of tomato paste. I think the tomato paste made the soup just a tick heartier, which was nice. I also used frozen veggies because I had them on hand. I'm pretty sure I totally forgot the creole seasoning. Mercy. Next time I'll include that. Apparently it is good either way, ha ha. This would be great with ground turkey added, if you want to make it even heartier but still stay healthy. My mom makes a version of this soup that has cabbage in it. That would also be a great addition!

This receive is simple and easy! My family loves it. I use V8 and one can of tomato paste. I also cook my chicken breast for a few hours in the crock pot and shred from there and just add the ingredients and I serve the cornbread.  Quick and easy

I don't usually write reviews but the idea of the veggie juice (V8) is awesome. I added frozen mixed vegetables and also a small turnip and parsnip. My husband and I both love the flavor they add. I added a couple of bay leaves and extra chicken broth instead of water. Awesome! Thanks so much for the great and easy recipe!

Great recipe..I'll be keeping this as a staple! I made a few adjustments:
1. I chose not to use green beans and added peas instead.  2. In place of creole seasoning, I used a little chili power, rosemary and sage
3. I added another cup of water so the broth was a tad bit more diluted

Stayed faithful to the recipe except for Italian seasoning as a replacement for the cajun seasoning. I doubled the recipe and used three heaping teaspoons of the seasoning. My family liked it. We also give it a shake or two of Franks Red Hot when it is in the bowl. Awesome with grilled cheese made with thick cheddar slices on Texas style loaf bread. This will become my go to "quick" vegetable soup recipe.

I LOVED this! The key to it not being bland is the tomato base, whether you use the V8, or tomato sauce, or like me, tomato paste, because that's all I had (I did add water to even it out). I've made veggie soups that have tasted a bit plain, but this was SO delicious. 
It seems like you really could use any veggies you have on hand. The other thing that seemed to combine the flavors so well was the Creole seasoning! I didn't have any, so like another reviewer suggested, I searched the recipe on AllRecipes! I did cut down a teeny bit on the spicier peppers in the seasoning because I'm a wuss! 
If you don't like tomato soup or can't handle the acidity, I wouldn't recommend this. I personally used carrots, potato, onion, and tomato as my veggies. Very very good! Glad to come across this! It was perfect for me tonight as I feel I'm getting sick. The warmth and spices were very soothing :)

Used my canned tomatoes 1 pint jar plus my canned salsa 1 pint jar instead of tomato vegetable juice cocktail.  Used 1 T. and 1 tsp. Cajun seasoning and 1 Tbsp. onion powder, and a can of corn instead of fresh.  It was great!

Good soup.  I didn't have tomato juice so just used the juice from the diced tomatoes.  I also don't have creole seasoning.  I added a teaspoon of siracha sauce instead.  I used chickpeas instead of green beans.  You can really make any substitutes you'd like.  I allowed the soup to simmer for about an hour.

Loved this soup. I used all fresh vegetable where I could and the rest frozen. Also blended fresh tomatoes to cut back on sodium.  I have added ground turkey, ground beef, or chicken to make it a bit hardier.  I usually add more than one potato as well. Yummy!!

i really like this..i rarely cook and have been doing lately. I didn't have the v8 so I used a canned tomato sauce, frozen vegetables and added cajun mix, cayenne and italian spices. It all worked well and was so good. It took 30 mins or less. So easy and tasted so good. It is hearty and the vegetables taste good..

Great recipe for getting the kids involved! My seven year old and I made this for dinner. So easy and soooo good; a new family favorite! We added a bay leaf, used frozen corn and green beans, didn't have creole seasoning so we used herbs du provance, and we added garlic powder. I think next time we'll add the frozen veggies and celery after cooking for 20 minutes so they aren't so done. I'also sauté garlic and an onion next time for an added layer of flavor. Seriously, this was so easy for my son to get in to and very quick to put together. I let him do everything but chop the veggies. Next time he can help with that too!

This soup is perfect in the winter. I used low sodium hot and spicy V8 instead of Creole seasoning, and I won't make that mistake again. I'll try the Creole seasoning with the next batch.

Easy & quick I made as written but instead of using canned vegtables I added frozen mixed vegetables & dried kale. Next time I won't put as much spice in it (I added about 2 tsp. and it was pretty hot). Also try adding some lima beans in it.

It turned out pretty good. I only made one change and that was to add beef (only because I'm a meat eater and need the protein). I almost added a clove of garlic but I held back this time. Next time I'm going to add it. 
I like how I can throw everything together in the crock and walk away to dine later. Good recipe!

I looked up creole seasoning and made my own. It has oregano in it which I think ruined the soup. I did not like the Italian flavor that it gave it. I'm not sure what everyone loved about it unless they just didn't want traditional vegetable soup.

Fairly quick and easy.  30 minute simmer time is perfect.  Did not add the Cajun spice the first time around and it was still quite good following the recipe to the tee.  No real need to change anything to get a great result.  I will definitely make again.

Tried this for my 2 year old. He doesn't eat much meats , so I try to be creative with working with veggies. I changed recipe a bit. Added more water and vegetable stock , I read from other reviews that this recipe came out more like a stew than a soup. . And snap peas instead(they were on sale). Also added Brown rice. My kid loved it.

Start with this recipe and make it your own by adding your favorites and short cuts! This is a great, fast meal starter or wonderful to serve with your favorite sandwich or at the start of a meal.  I used store brand vegetable juice and canned vegetables, plus frozen, cubed hash brown potatoes. Instead of Cajun spice, I added a tablespoon of cayenne hot sauce.  Start with this recipe and make it your own by adding your favorites and short cuts!

This is a wonderful soup!! I've been sick with a summer cold and need something really healthy. I used beef stock instead of chicken, small can of tomato purée instead of the V8. But the best addition were the tortellinis!! Soooo good! I will make this over and over again.

So quick and easy. Tastes great too. The only thing I did differently was used a can of corn and a can of green beans. They were all I had. And home canned tomato juice instead is the V8. Everything else was exact to the recipe.

Made this today and followed the recipe exactly as written.  Used 1 T of the Creole seasoning and it had just the right amount of heat and seasoning. Will definitely make this again and again.

I used the base of this soup with chopped squash, onion, and zucchini from a local farm.  It worked out perfectly!  I also used spicy V8 for preference.  Great recipe!

Great recipe! Very easy. I first put the chicken broth the water and all the vegies. I left the diced tomatoes and the juice for last, so that my vegies can cook better. The beans take the longest so I will advice putting them at first for 5min. I also added very little butter. The diced tomatoes I got had basil, garlic and oregano, which gave a very good taste and smell to the soup. I also added chopped green peppers, because I love them. Great soup!

I followed the recipe as is, but found it rather bland. I am going to see tomorrow if it improves. I made just one small change and that is not knowing what creole seasoning is I had Cajun in the house and tasted it and found it way too hot. So, I used some old bay seasoning. As the seasonings are to taste, it shouldn't have changed it that much. I also cooked it for the 30 minutes and the potatoes were still hard cooking mostly at a simmer, as suggested. I turned off the heat and let it sit on the hot burner another 30 minutes and they became just soft enough for a soup at that point. It kind of just tastes like boiled vegetables in a salty tomato broth. Maybe rice or noodles, even 1/2 cup, might improve the texture and taste.

Very good recipe.  I added some chopped cabbage - good idea.  Add seasonings slowly and it will be 
just right.  Will definitely make again.

almost just like Mother used to make. I neglected to buy Creole spice so I used a little Herbes de Provence & threw in a Bay Leaf.  Going to try it with beef broth next time.  Very tasty.

This was very good. I did double the veggies and added peas.  I added the onion and garlic prior as some other reviews stated. I went all out and added dry oregano, basil, parsley and about 5 dabs of Worcestershire sauce.  Added alot of body

This is a great base for any vegetable soup. I was low on fresh vegetables right after the holidays. I substituted with one large can of Veg-All and one pint freezer bag of peas and one of butter beans. These came from my step-dad's garden. I used culinary beef stock as I was out of chicken.  I didn't add water. I seasoned with one tsp Italian seasoning, one tsp of poultry seasoning, one tsp Ruth Ann's Muskego Ave Chicken & Fish Seasoning by Penzey Spices, and 1.5 TBSP of Lea & Perrins Worchestershire Sauce. Lastly, one large clove pressed fresh garlic.

Tried this tonight & it was a big hit! Instead of a regular potato I used a sweet potato. As well no green beans but a can of mixed lentils. A must try. The Cajun seasoning totally makes the flavor for this. I also juiced my own tomatoes instead of using a can of V8

I made a big batch of this and split it up into portions for my husband to take to work for lunch.  Throw some browned and drained ground beef in it and some okra and he swears it could be his grandma's "secret recipe."

Eh. That's about all I have to say about this recipe. Bland, even with tons of seasoning. The V8 wasn't the best choice. Probably won't be making this again, but it did feel really healthy with all the veggies.

Super easy and good. I made a few changes for my own prefernce. I used beef broth, omitted celery as I don't care for it in veggie soup and I chopped cabbage and cooked it in the broth for about 45 minutes before adding the other ingredients. Also I added sauteed onions and a pinch of oregano, basil, garlic powder and cayenne pepper to sub for creole seasoning. Yum!-crewser

I chopped up yellow squash, zucchini, mushrooms, one potato, an onion, and added frozen corn and green beans. Didn't have creole seasoning but found the recipe for it in someone's review. Used a can of tomato juice and a can of V8. I guess basically I used the printed recipe as inspiration, and for that I say thank you!

I'm pregnant and make this often since I can cram so many healthy vegetables into this soup. I usually also add cabbage and lima beans as well. I use low sodium spicy V-8 to give it more of a kick. Perfection!

My husband has been bugging me to make him some homemade vegetable soup.  My soup somehow always turns out tasting like stew or is just not good.  FINALLY--I have a GOOD recipe.  The name says it all--quick and easy.  I used 1 TBSP Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning.  I also added 1 cup sliced okra and 1 cup frozen petite peas.  Because my husband likes meat in his soup, I added 1 lb ground beef (browned & drained).  In place of the 1 cup water, I used a can of beef broth.  This soup was GREAT!  This recipe is a keeper.

The was delicious!  I added onions and sautéed them in tbsp olive oil with the carrots, celery and potatoes just until the onions were transparent.  I then added the remaining ingredients plus frozen okra about 15 minutes before soup was done.  Also added garlic powder and a pinch of cayenne pepper.   I added more chicken broth as I love it to be extra soupy. Will be making this more often and with fresh veggies.  Good and healthy.

I use vegetable stock from campbells as opposed to using chicken stock and add additional mixed beans to provide protein.  Excellent soup for the kids so I add some alphabet pasta for fun.

I LOVE this soup! It is so simple & easy. I need easy--I don't cook much. I like SPICY things, so I used V-8 Spicy tomato juice. I've made this soup THREE times in the past month. I make this in my slow-cooker/crock pot and let it cook for several hours. Sometimes, I'll add some deli-ham when I re-heat the soup if I'm in the mood for some meat.

This vegetable soup was awesome!  Based on other reviews, I used chicken broth instead of beef broth.  Seasoned with 1 1/2 tbsp of the creole seasoning, 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper, salt and pepper, and one bay leaf. Increased the chicken broth to two cans as well.  Sauteed sliced onions, diced celery, and diced carrots in little bit of olive oil to start.  Then added all of the liquids and the rest of the veggies.  Simmered for about 45 minutes. Hubby ate 4 bowls so I know it is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I made the recipe as stated.  My family wasn't thrilled with this, nor was I.  The leftovers actually tasted better the next day.  Because this is such a quick and easy recipe, I will make it again but I'll definitely change the seasonings.

Super easy to make.  Hearty and very good all around.  Used 1 large bag of frozen Farm grown veggies I found at Walmart, 2 cans of beef broth, about 22 oz of V8.  Next time I think I will add rice or pasta.

very good, even my picky eating children ate it.  I sauteed the carrot, onion and potatoe and then let simmer in broth.  To add fiber I added cannelini beans.  Great flavor, will do again!

This was a great recipe!! My boyfriend loved it! be careful for the creole seasoning - I had never used it before and almost added too much. It gives it great flavor though. I am sure it will be even better then next day. Thanks for sharing the excellent recipe!!

I really liked this recipe.  It was easy, inexpensive and quick.  I couldn't find creole seasoning, so I used steak seasoning instead and it was delicious.  I doubled it to take some to a sick friend and she loved it too.  I'd definitely make this again.

I thought this recipe was very good. I made some additions, which I usually do to most recipies. I doubled the recipe, my husband and I like a lot of left overs. I thought the recipe was a little bland so I added dried basil, garlic powder, onion powder, a couple splashes of worcestershire and barley. The creole seasoning added a great flavor and a little kick! What a fantastic and heathly meal! I will definitely make this one again!!

I just didn't think it was that good.  Used the vegetable broth as suggested, it wasn't bad, just not good enough to make again.

An excellent soup!  Really fast and easy to prepare, even my kids liked it (but I had to go easy on the creole seasoning for them, my husband added more to his). I used V8 as advised by others and worked very well!

Very good, and very nutritious.  I added two cans of chicken broth, but that was a mistake. I will follow the recipe and only use one next time.

This was excellent.  I added cooked chicken (and more broth/tomato juice).  Served with biscuits, this made a hearty, delicious dinner.  Received rave reviews from all!  Good, easy, fast AND inexpensive. Perfect!
