This dish was easy, very tasty and the kids loved it. I did make a couple of minor changes.  I added 4 cloves of garlic, 1 large onion, salt, pepper and some fresh parsley.  I also used home canned tomatoes instead of the can of stewed tomatoes. I will make this recipe again for sure.

I absolutely loved this recipe!!!  I did substitute green peppers for zucchini.  I added it last as in the recipe and put the lid on my electric skillet and just barely steamed them on top of the other ingredients.  This has been my favorite dish on this website:) !!

I loved this quick and tasty recipe. I added Italian Spices, garlic and an egg to the pork to make meatballs and then sauted them with the zucchini and some mushrooms.  I also wanted a thick spaghetti-type sauce so I tossed in a can of tomato paste with the diced tomatoes.  Topped with some parmesan cheese and served with garlic toast this was a great meal to use up some left over ground pork!!  Would absolutely make this again!

Delicious - I used broccoli instead of zuchinni, and lots of jarred pasta sauce instead of stewed tomoates and the italian seasoning.  My 3 year old twins ate it and my DH and I loved it!

I used one whole onion, threw in some fresh minced garlic and added a little salt/fresh ground pepper. The italian seasoning I used was homemade. After serving in bowls, I sprinkled each serving with parmesan cheese. My two kids thought this was great, my husband said it needs more seasoning. All in all, a good meal. Very quick. It's like a healthier version of Hamburger Helper. I'd make it again but I'd goose it up a little.

Pretty tasty dish! I used about a half pound of pasta since I read that that 1.5 pounds was too much and it turned out to be an appropriate amount. I used mushrooms instead of zucchini, doubled the amount of tomato sauce (I dont like dry pasta) and added cayenne pepper for kick. Delish!

Great flavor, very simple, and great flexibility.  I made a few changes that weren't critical.  I gave this 5 stars b/c I will make this again and again due to its simplicity and flexibility....and i have lots of ground pork in the freezer.

I added some minced garlic with the meat and onions then mixed 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper and the dish came out excellent. 

Even my wife, who doesnt like meat and tomatoe sauce, cleaned her plate.

Very tasty, quick and easy. I seasoned the meat while it was cooking and added 3 cloves of garlic after the meat was browned. I used prepared spaghetti sauce and green peppers. Plates were licked clean!

Very disappointed in this recipe.  Smelled really good while it was cooking, but the flavor was dull and boring.  I think if I tried this again, I would used a spicier pork sausage, but frankly I don't think I'll try it again.

It was really good.  I was surprised as I thought it was "too simple", but it was actually just right.  I didnt quarter cut the zucchini.  I made them into chips to add some texture to the dish.

This was delicious! I really wasn't expecting to like it so much, but it was really quick and tasty. I aded a clove of minced garlic as other reviewers suggested. I only had large cans of tomatoes (796 ml) and tomatoe sauce (350 ml), but I used all of both cans as I didn't feel like putting away the leftovers. I also grated the zucchini to hide it from my kids.
It was a nice change from the usual ground beef and pasta dishes. My kids even had second helpings! It also reheated well for lunch the next day. This will go into the regular rotation.

Real good. I didn't have Italian Seasoning, but used Mediterranean salt mixture instead and added Basil, Tarragon, and Oregano. Also added garlic. The whole family commented how good a sauce it was (not that I don't usually make good sauces...)

I added lots of fresh garlic and did not use tomato sauce as I felt that would make it just like spaghetti. My husband loved it and so di my 14 month old. The whole family was happy with this and I found it all in the fridge without going to the store and on a rainy day it was great

I was looking for a recipe to use what I had on hand so I used this basic recipe.  I adjusted only because I did not have exact ingredients on hand.  I used one jar of pizza sauce and one can stewed tomatoes (fire roasted/garlic).  I added fresh spinach to the skillet since I didn't have zucchini.  I then added the cooked pasta, cooked pork/onion sauces to a casserole dish with a layer of mozzarella cheese. topped with Italian bread crumbs/parmesan and more mozzarella.  baked at 350 for 20 min.  Very good.  I just wanted a baked dish tonight, but would have been fine without baking.  Thanks

This recipe has become a "go to" staple in my house, it's so fast and easy.  When I coo the onions I also saute with some diced mushrooms and maybe sliced black olives.  Also, my husband doesn't like the zucchini al dente, so I put it in the pan when I add the tomato sauce--which I double the amount.  I use whatever canned tomatoes/sauce I have on hand and it always works.

This recipe is very basic - probably something I've thrown together myself in the past. I had a friend over the night I made it and she thanked me for the spaghetti.

I didn't have all the ingredients to make the original recipe, so I substituted Tomato Bisque Soup for the tomato sauce, added in a small can of tomato paste, and used a can of Italian herb canned tomatoes and a can of fire roasted tomatoes instead of the stewed as my family doesn't like stewed. I didn't have any zucchini but it was great without it, added some shredded Parmesan cheese on top. Pretty good the way I made it, great recipe in general.

made this tonight for dinner,  I was in a time crunch.  All in all I will give it five stars... however make sure to add your "own" seasoning.  I added some red pepper flakes, salt and pepper and some garlic... Husband and daughter loved it!  thanks for the meal idea!  Super fast super easy!

Tasty recipe.  I didn't have stewed tomatoes so I put in 15 oz tomato sauce, then, per another reviewer, added minced garlic and a can of great northern beans.  I served it over leftover mashed potatoes.  Thanks!

Yummy. Used fresh basil and oregano instead of italian seasonings. Also fresh tomato and tomato sauce. I think next time I will cook the meat directly with some thyme to add more italian flavor (before adding tomato). Also needs some salt!

This was easy AND delicious! I added dried minced onion (reconstituted in water), two tsp minced garlic and a can of great northern beans that was hiding in my pantry. Everyone in our family loved it, including the kids! :)

This tasted good but it was way too much pasta. I did add some cumin, chili powder, salt and pepper. It would have been too bland for me without the extra spices.

Very tasty. Mine wound up a little dry. Next time I will either add more sauce or cut back on the pasta.
