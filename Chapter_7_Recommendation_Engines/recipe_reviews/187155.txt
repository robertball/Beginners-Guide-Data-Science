Very similar to the one my mother used--only I never had a "recipe", just the basic ingredients to use.  Nice to have "amounts"!  For ease in cutting, use a pizza (roller type) cutter.

I've learned from my great grandmother to double boil my noodles. First put them in hot water on the stove to remove all of the flour and then cook them in the broth, we always use turkey!

Great recipe! I have always made them guessing at the amounts. But this works way better. Also a tip to cutting the noodles. Do not cut them until after the drying time. If the dough is still slightly sticky rub a thin layer of flour on top. Next roll into a tube. With a sharp knife slice to desired thickness. Then unroll them all and you get a nice pile of noodles.

This is an excellent recipe. I add about 1/2 teaspoon of poultry seasoning to the dry ingredients for more flavor.

This is pretty much the same recipe I've used for years to make all sorts, shapes and sizes of pasta.  The rule I learned from my husband's aunt is to use 1 egg per person you expect to serve, add other ingredients to accommodate any additional eggs.  I have also learned that weather plays a big role in getting the right consistency in the dough ... too humid out, takes longer to dry.  Lastly, I agree with the comment by alexislm001 to double boil.  On rare occasions when I did not have the time to do this, my soup got cloudy and it seemed to thicken up whatever sauce I served the noodles in.

My family has made these noodles for Thanksgiving for over 60 years.  The baking powder is new to me, but gave the noodles a lighter texture.  I agree that you don't want to knead them too much or they will not be as tender.  We cook them in broth from our turkey, and supplement that with chicken broth. We like the extra flour on the noodles to thicken the broth as they cook, because we pour ours over the cornbread dressing or mashed potatoes.  I know this is starch over starch, but Thanksgiving only comes once a year.

Fantastic! Very easy to make. For all of you that say too dry... You've never made noodles. It always starts flaky and dry until you kneed it many times. If you don't want to put in the effort then buy pre-made noodles :)

I found that my measure of flour  made the dough slightly dry. I think people forget that density of flour in the cup will either make it work, or make the recipe fail. I added a little extra water to make the cough come together. I wrapped and let it rest for 30 minutes then rolled out batches using my pasta roller. 

Another thing that can make the dough seem drier or wetter even if the flour is sifted before measuring. People often forget that flour will absorb moisture in humid weather and dry out in more arid air. So the amount of liquid needed will vary. It is usually a good practice to hold back some of the flour to be added later if the consistency warrants. JMHO.  :)

Perfect, thanks. I was looking for something different than the usual store bought Fettuccini Noodles to use with my Beef Stroganoff. This recipe was awesome, it gave new life to my Stroganoff.

I make these quite often, I have a noodle cutter, it rolls over the dough and cuts it into 5 strips about 1/2 inch wide.
 I too double boil the noodles, first in water to take out the cloudiness, and then they go into either chicken or beef broth.
Or sometimes if I am making chicken with vegetables, instead of making dumplings I will put in the noodles, and these I do not double boil.

This did not turn out well.  It was so incredibly dry.  I added an additional 6 tablespoons of water and it was still a hard ball.

I make these but do not put in Baking powder, I will try it. An easy way to cut your noodles, if you are in a hurry or your dough is a bit soft, use your Pizza cutter. If you need square noodles, make squares. Lift with a chop stick or floured hands and hang them to dry on a little rack if you have one. My Aunt Ethil always cut open a paper grocery sack, rolled out and dried her noodles on this. The brown paper absorbs moisture.  Easy clean up!  I never heard of double boiling but I'm going to do it, as I have had the noodles cloud the broth. Thanks!

These turned out great! I used them to make some chicken noodle soup, and let them dry all night so they'd absorb a maximum amount of broth.

I'd been using another recipe on Allrecipes as my standby, but thought I'd give this one a shot. I liked it a lot and it made plenty of noodles for a big pot of turkey soup with leftovers to dry further and use later. These aren't as fluffy as the other recipe, but in a way, they held up better for longer cooking in the soup than I was expecting. 

I did the recipe exactly as written with the exception of using a KitchenAid stand mixer with a dough hook to knead the dough to a soft consistency. I then rolled and cut them with a pasta maker, just to save time.

Will definitely use these again.

4 eggs make a very big batch. I tend to use 1/2 pasta flour and use garlic salt instead of regular salt. Even without these changes, homemade noodles are the greatest. And I use cubed fried bread (8slices) to put with noodles. Use lots of butter.

I was interested in the comments about "double boiling." I had never even considered their reasons for doing so.  I have always done a variation of this, but for a different reason.  So that the noodles don't soak up so much broth in their cooking, I first boil the noodles in salted water for half of their required boiling time (which of course depends upon the thickness of the noodles), and then I put them into the soup (so they can absorb some of the flavor) to finish cooking.

Great recipe. I did have to add a little extra water though, but no problem.
