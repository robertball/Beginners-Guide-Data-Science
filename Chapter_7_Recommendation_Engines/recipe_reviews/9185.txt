I LOVE this recipe. I got so many compliments on this pie. My Mom even wanted the recipe, and she's the Master Cook around my house! This recipe is inexpensive and tastes delicious. The only problem I had is getting the cream cheese to completely smooth. There were little lumps left and they didn't bake out- they were still there when the pie had cooled. Next time I will have to smoothen the mixture more. And the recipe calls for 1 pie shell, this mixture made 1 9" pie, 3 mini 1" pies and I had a lot left over. Better get 2-3 pie shells for this one.

Really liked this pie!  I used a shortbread crust, and added 2 Tb brown sugar and 1 tsp vanilla to the filling for extra flavor. Also needed a deep-dish pie pan.  I will definitely be making this for Thanksgiving and keeping this recipe!

This pie was a big hit at my friend's holiday dinner party.  Everyone raved and said I have to make it all the time!  I used a graham cracker crust, and it came out delicious.

I made this for "6" servings (i only had 1.5 c pumpkin), and it filled the pie pan perfectly -- I can't imagine if I would have made it for "8".  I added 2 T brown sugar and used fat free cream cheese and fat free condensed milk -- it turned out DELICIOUS!!  Will definitely make again.  The only reason it's not a 5 star is because I would add more spices next time.  :)  Yummy!

I used this recipe for my first cooked desert at my monther-in-laws Thanksgiving dinner and it was gone in a matter of seconds--which is what everyone wanted...She even asked me to e-mail her the recipe. Thanks for helping me make a bang with my first impression.

Honestly, I figured I would give it a try but there's something about pumpkin and cream cheese that just doesn't work.  I was not impressed with this recipe.  I think I will stick to good ol' pumpkin pie.

This was very good, but it made enough to make 2 pies. I added another brick of cream cheese to the second pie and it was even better.

I cheated and used a pre-made pecan pie crust and I added a tablespoon of maple syrup (my 8 yr olds idea). Amazing!

I have been cooking this for over an hour and it won't set. I am now at 11/2 hours and it still won't set and is burning.
I did everything it stated in the recipe but its watery.
