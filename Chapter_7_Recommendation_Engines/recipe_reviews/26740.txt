Tastes like a chocolate chip cheesecake and is so simple to make!  This was a HUGE hit at a ladies' luncheon that I made it for.  Everyone kept going back for more and everyone requested the recipe.  Just be sure you let everyone know that it's a DESSERT cheese ball.  No one had ever seen a dessert cheese ball before, and one lady got quite confused as to why a cheese ball had black specks in it and was served with graham crackers! I served it with regular graham crackers and also chocolate graham crackers.  I think it tasted best with the chocolate graham crackers.  A helpful hint: Add graham crackers and/or chocolate graham crackers to the ingredients list.  Since they weren't listed, when I made my grocery list I neglected to buy any and had to make a special trip back to the grocery store when I realized I had nothing to serve the cheese ball with!

so tasty! i have made this more times than i can count for certain occasions. some tips on this: NO LOWFAT ALLOWED! its too runny. and also, if you can't get it to form into a ball, you dont have enough sugar. add just a little extra at a time and it will be moldable. another good time saver- stick it in the freezer instead of the fridge. cuts the time in half. i also like to skip the nuts, add extra choc chips, and roll the ball in toffee bits. and then definately serve with chocolate grahms!

I MADE THIS RECIPE FOR THE FIRST TIME. I FOUND THE OTHER REVIEWS TO BE MOST HELPFUL,ESPECIALLY THE SUGGESTION OF INCREASING THE CONFECTIONERS SUGAR TO 1 CUP WHICH I DID.  I ALSO HAD NO TROUBLE WITH IT FORMING INTO A BALL QUICKLY.  MAYBE OTHERS HAD TROUBLE BECAUSE THEY SOFTENED THE CREAM CHEESE AND BUTTER IN THE MICROWAVE. I SOFTENED MINE FOR 1 HOUR AT ROOM TEMP.-NO PROBLEMS.  EVERYONE LOVED IT AND I PLAN TO MAKE IT AGAIN FOR ANOTHER EVENT THIS WEEK. THIS ONE'S A DEFINITE KEEPER!!!! KATHY

This is the best dessert ball I have yet to serve!  1/2'd the recipe and made the first cheese ball with toffee bits based on other recommendations and the second cheese ball with the pecans based on the recipe.  Needless to say our friends must all have sweet tooths, as the toffee bit dessert ball flew off the table dissolving into numerous mouths!!!  Sublime!!!

I thought this was easy!  I made it about a year ago, but remembered for a party.  Anyway, rather than deal with the "Will it set, or won't it?" issue, I lined a shallow bowl with plastic wrap, and scoop the mix into it.  I smoothed out the bottom, and stuck it in the fridge.  Next day, flip it over on a plate, press on the outer topping of your choice, and Viola!  Much easier to serve and scoop off of rather than a big round ball anyway.

This one took me for surprise ! I love it ! I used real butter and boxed cream cheese, I also used 3 TBS brown sugar. I did whip mine a long time in the mix master and placed in a bowl in the fridge over night. It was very soft,but after a day in the fridge, it formed into a perfect ball. I scooped it out onto waxed paper and rolled in Toffee bits. It really tasted like cookie dough once chilled. For those having trouble with forming a ball, you might want to chill it in a metal bowl, and be sure to use room temperature (real) butter and (regular)cream cheese. I don't know if the whipping had anything to do with it, but my cheese ball did form well. Good luck :) Thanks for a great new recipe.

This is the coolest recipe.  I shaped it into a ball and placed on a serving plate.  I cut a star out of construction paper and laid it on top.  I sprinkled chopped pecans all over and then removed the star which I covered with mini chocolate chips.  It was really neat.  I've also done just strips of paper altnernating between chopped pecans and mini chips.

I used 1 cup conf. dugar, sifted, 3 TBLS brown sugar, 1 cup mini chips and abut 1/2 tsp. vanilla. WONDERFUL! Took it to work today for Boss's Day.  Everyone gathered around and did not leave until the last chip was gone!  I served with the honey graham sticks and chocolate teddy grahams!  It is also great with fresh strawberries!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Taste is awsome but i used margerine vs butter - do not do this - the butter is needed to help keep in a ball form.  I will make again with butter

I made this yesterday for a candle party.  My friends sat at the table it was at and wouldn't move!!  I made it exactly the way it is written, and I served it with both the graham cracker sticks and chocolate wafers.  They were both great, but I have to admit I think my friends would have just used spoons if I had let them.  I gave out the recipe to about 6 of them before they left!!  Thanks

Can I give this like.. 10 stars?! I can't believe how something so simple can be so delicious. I made a few very small changes (all to quantity) based on the other reviews: I used just over 1 cup of confectioner's sugar (definitely wouldn't use any more), I purchased regular sized chocolate chips (less expensive) and I put them in the food processor, and finally, I only used 1/2 cup pecans, and I substituted the final 1/4 cup with the chopped chocolate chips. I think this is definitely the key to the cheese ball, because the coating was really just the "icing on the cake." I made sure to use salted butter and regular cream cheese (it's not meant to be healthy! if you skimp on the regular stuff, you'll have a difficult time forming the ball), and I put it in the freezer for 1 hour, rolled it, and then back in the freezer for 30 minutes. It firmed up PERFECTLY.. I took this to our weekly get-together and it was an absolutely hit. I served it with regular graham crackers, and seriously everyone was blown away by it (we do love our desserts). We contemplated just grabbing some spoons...

Absolutely fabulous little appetizer! This tastes just like cheesecake but without all the effort!  However, it does have all the fat! You really have to use full fat ingredients here or it won't set right. And, if you need it to set up quick you can place it in the freezer for a few minutes. I served it with an assortment of vanilla wafers and chocolate graham crackers. This is a definite keeper!

I could NOT get mine to roll into a ball, I added extra sugar as suggested AND put it in the fridge over night. It was just a bowl of mush :-(

4 stars as is, I customized the recipe and give the changes a 5 Star + rating!  I used neufchatel cheese (saved a calorie), which made it softer and not likely to form a ball.  Guess what, now it's a dip(not a "bowl of mush" as other have described!)! I reduced the confect sugar by half, doubled the brown sugar, and added a tsp of vanilla, resulting in a more "cookie dough-like" flavor.  I added 4 tablesp of powdered cocoa, and added the chopped pecans to the "dip" as well.  OMG, this was fantastic!  I served it at a party with salty mini pretzels, but my 2 1/2 yr old son and I ate bowls of it with spoons beforehand!  SO DELICIOUS!  LOVE IT AND WILL MAKE AGAIN AND AGAIN!

Everyone liked it but they liked the chocolate, chocolate chip cheese ball (a Paula Deen recipe) better.  The chocolate chip cheese ball was super sweet and even after being refrigerated for 24 hrs was still too soft to mold into a ball (perhaps because of the light cream cheese).  A good, solid recipe for those that like super sweet desserts.

This gets a firm 5 stars for taste, but 2-3 for method.  I followed the recipe to the letter, and there is no way this was ever going to form into a ball.  I refrigerated for 2-3 hours, took it out, still mush.  Then I wrapped it in plastic wrap, put it into a "ball" shaped bowl, put it into the freezer for 1 hour, still mush.  In the end I put the mixture into a bowl, sprinkled it with chocolate crumbs, chocolate chips, and sprinkles.  It was a huge hit with everyone.  I will use this recipe again, but don't know if I will try to form it into a ball.  It was good just scooping it from the bowl.  We served it with chocolate and regular graham crackers.  But my kids and I tried it on an apple, and it was a terrific combination!

This is a wonderful recipe! I know that some other reviewers had trouble forming the ball. I took a sheet of saran wrap and layed it on the counter. Then I dumped the mix onto the plastic wrap. You can then gather the plastic up around the dough and form it into a ball.  This way it doesn't stick to your hands! Then you just let it roll onto the plate that you will be serving on. Works like a charm. then I sprinkled the toffee bits on the ball and gently patted them into the surface of the ball. Your family and friends will enjoy this one!!!

Totally Gorgeous ~ I doubled all the ingredients just so I could have a bigger dessert.  Easy to make, had no problems making the ball shape.  I did use an extra 1/4 cup of confectioners sugar.  I used 1/2 portion of vanilla extra and then 1/2 portion mint extract, also added mint chocolate chips. As I am a choc-o-holic I thought why spoil it with nuts!!!! So coated in toffee bits rather than chopped pecans.  Tasted just like a mint chocolate cheese cake ~ delicious!

So delicious and so simple!  I let the cream cheese and butter soften on the counter for about an hour, whipped in my KitchenAid stand mixer with the flat beater.  Refrigerated in a stainless steel round bowl for a few hours before shaping into a ball.  Rolled in crushed toffee bits since I didn't have pecans.  Served with vanilla wafers and honey graham crackers.  A huge hit at the party, was the most popular item on the table!

Read reviews before making and saw many people had trouble forming into a ball. I added 1 cup of confectionary sugar instead of 3/4 cup and chilled for 2 1/2 hours. Had no problem forming it into a ball. Rolled in extra mini semisweet chocolate chips instead of the pecans. Served at our Super Bowl party with chocolate graham crackers. Everyone loved it. Will be making this again very soon.

2010-11-25 I made this as written with the exception of extra chopped pecans to completely cover the cheese ball.  The mixture was too soft to shape into a proper ball even after refrigerating overnight.  The end result was much too sweet for us.  If I were to make this again, I'd use bittersweet chocolate in some form to try to eliminate some of the sweetness & increase the chocolate flavor.  The brown sugar wasn't even discernible so I'd leave that out, too.  *Updated 2011-01-24  We prefer the cheese ball frozen & in a log shape to allow more pecan coating.

Everyone always loves this when I bring it to parties. I usually put just a few chocolate chips on the inside and then roll the outside in them, no nuts.

I couldn't get it into a ball, but wasn't too upset by it since I had read the reviews prior to making it, and kind of expected it. I simply put it into a decorative mini-loaf pan and pressed mini chocolate chips on top. Problem solved. It was simply delicious.

This is an outstanding, easy dessert that people love! All you have to worry about is allowing the necessary chilling time, but other than that, it's can't-miss. I chill the mix for two hours, then form into a ball and roll in mini choco chips instead of pecans. Then it goes back into the fridge for a little more chilling time. 
To make it even easier, though, just skip the "ball" part. Mix the ingredients as instructed, scoop it all into an attractive serving bowl, sprinkle more mini choco chips and top, and chill! Couldn't be easier.
FYI, I use the "1/3 Less Fat" Neufchatel cheese instead of the full-fat cream cheese, and it tastes absolutely wonderful. I serve it with Nilla wafers and graham cracker sticks. You should definitely give this recipe a try!

This is a good recipe; a nice change of pace from the usual apps.  I followed the recipe and had no problems shaping it into a ball (I did heed the warnings and use full fat cream cheese).  I served w/Scooby Doo bone shaped grahams (they were very sturdy and a big hit with the kids) and Nilla wafers.  Guests seemed to like it, I thought it had an overpowering cream cheese taste.  I will make again.

I've shared this at work and family parties.  It's always a huge hit!  Never anything left to take home.  

Like previous commenters, I roll my cheese ball in heath bar crumbs (sold in a bag at the store).  Delicious!!!

I have made this for years now.  Lately I have been crushing up the cookie part of Oreos to put on the outside instead of pecans.  I make it the night before I need it.  Put plastic wrap in a big coffee mug and then put the mix in.  Gives me the ball shape.  Unthaw it for 15 minutes before I put the Oreo cookie crumble on the outside.  Guests love it.

Love this one! I do part semi-sweet, milk chocolate & white chocolate chips- it gives a good flavor. I process into small bits in food processor. I also roll into a log as it stays looking nicer for longer when people dig into it. Serve with pretzels and granny smith apple slices. People always want recipe. It is unique and oh so delish!

Very well received at our office potluck!  I made the night before and kept in the fridge overnight and found it very easy to roll into a ball.  I rolled mine in crushed Oreo Cookies!  Will make again!

I am giving this a 5 because this is just soooo good.  But, you will definitely need more confectioners sugar.  After that there are endless possibilities with this base recipe (altering what you roll it in or flavorings you add to the center).  I doubled the confectioners sugar, added a tablespoon of unsweetened Ghiradelli cocoa to the cheese ball (but left out the mini choc. chips), rolled the chilled ball in sweet cocoa, then rolled it in chopped nuts and milk chocolate shavings.  I served it with honey flavored pretzels.  I'll definitely be making this again.  It's a great make-ahead dessert or sweet appetizer.

AWESOME recipe - easy to make, even easier to EAT!  For Christmas presents, I made these into Buckeye style truffles - a little difficult but if you put the mixture in the freezer for ~45 minutes before rolling into balls (and coat your palms with powdered sugar)it really helps.

This was a really neat and unique dessert-like item, and was great to take to an office party. I did dissolve the brown sugar in a tablespoon of butter, but other than that made it as the recipe states. After removing it from the fridge, I also stuck it in the freezer for about 5-10 minutes before I rolled it into a ball, which I think helped with shaping it. Otherwise, this was excellent with teddy grahams. It wasn't quite as good with chocolate graham crackers, but I think that may have been due to the graham crackers - they had a tendency to break more easily than the teddy grahams did. I suspect graham sticks, vanilla wafers, chocolate wafers, teddy grahams or anything more solid-like such as those are your best bet for serving with this. Otherwise, it's fairly rich, and really good, and I like how versatile it has the possibility to be! I rolled mine in miniature chocolate chips rather than pecans, for example. I definitely recommend this one though!

After reading the review by KIMAR, I decided to try this recipe.  I was not in anyway disappointed.  This cheese ball was easy to make, I had all the ingredients in my kitchen all ready, so I didn't have to go out to get ingredients.  I did however use chopped walnuts in place of the pecans, but no one complained about that.  It tasted just like cheese cake and although I served it during a football game where there were appetizers galore, it was the first dish gone.  All my friends asked for the recipe and couldn't believe that it was that easy to make.  Everyone thought I had spent hours preparing this cheese ball.  I believe most of my friends will be making this recipe in the very near future as I printed copies of the recipe for everyone there.  Even one of the single guys at the party wanted it.  he thought it would be a great way to impress his girlfriend.  Loved this recipe and will make it again very soon.

Omg... I made this recipe this weekend for the most picky family I know. They killed for the recipe. I decided with pretzels, graham crackers, and vanilla wafers. Also I went for the cup of sugar. I have to say I will make this for every party from this day on. Thanks so much.  note: this was my very first review and I have been a member since 2002.

Absolutely delicious if you are a sweets-lover and a chocolate fan!  I ate this at a bridal shower.  The hostess served it with chocolate and honey graham cracker sticks.  I loved it so then made it for a work party.  I had severeal people ask me for the recipe.  It's a KEEPER!

I think rolling this in crushed oreos is a much better idea than pecans. However, I am not comfortable with how much butter is in this. Just, wow. Next time, I will omit the butter and use more cream cheese. Also the preparation was not what I expected after making two other cheeseballs previous to this one. I had to freeze this one for an hour before shaping, that's in addition to the refrigeration. This is a 5 star IDEA, but this recipe as written, isn't what it should be.

Very good! Does kind of remind me of cookie dough. Wished I could have found chocolate grahams since so many suggested them. 4 starts just because I used half the butter and I dont think it needed a whole stick.

Fantastic!!!! I used the whipped cream cheese, which I think made it creamer. I also dissolved the brown sugar in the melted butter. I added some mini chocolate chips and Heath toffee chips in the mixture. Then I take a bowl and put Saran Wrap inside the bowl then scoop the mixture into that. I put the bowl into the freezer for several hours. This makes it easier to shape into a ball and it doesn’t get on your hands if you leave it in the Saran Wrap while shaping. Then I take off the Saran Wrap and roll in mini chocolate chips. I don’t like pecans so I didn’t use them. I made this for work and a baby shower and got rave reviews. Thanks!

I tweaked this recipe and it turned out great!! I added a little extra powdered sugar, and a little extra brown sugar. One thing I noticed is that I made this on Super Bowl Sunday. It is Wednesday today and I decided to eat some more of it. It tastes better today than it did Sunday. So if you have the time to make the cheese ball a couple days ahead of time and let the flavors blend, I would totally do it!

I made this for a girls night party.  It was re-named- "Ball of Goodness" and they all wanted the recipe!
I made it as directed- except added a bit more confectioner's sugar.  Butter and full fat cream cheese.  Rolled in pecan bits.  Served with Chocolate Wafer Cookies and strawberries.  Total hit at the party!

Turned out great; I read about the problems other reviewers had had, but my mixture firmed up great, and everyone at our pot luck loved it! Thanks, Kim!

An excellent twist on the traditional cheese ball. I've served this with thin chocolate wafers and graham crackers...both are delicious. This is really good!! I also used lite cream cheese...not one noticed. :)

It is sooo good, but you can't eat much its sooooo sweet and rich. I served it with waffle style pretzles, and some kind of nutty crackers. It was nice to have the salty with the super sweet. I might try it again and cut some of the sugar.

This recipe is the best..I had it in an old cookbook a long time ago and finding it on here was awesome! I usually make mine a dip instead of a ball by using margerine instead of butter and no pecans..it's a huge hit in our family and I'm asked to make it for every party

This was pretty tasty. I didn't have mini chocolate chips, but it was fine. I used chocolate teddy grahams for a sweeter cracker.

Loved this!! I had never thought of a dessert cheeseball so was intrigued by this. Sweet but delicious. I served it with chocolate wafers and vanilla wafers and pretzels. I rolled in toasted pecans. I will definitely make this again. Thank you for this wonderful recipe :)

Very good.  I read the other reviews before I made this and made some of the changes suggested like 1 c. powdered sugar and 3 Tbs. brown sugar.  Also I rolled mine in toffee bits instead of nuts for those that don't like nuts or allergic.  And I put mine in the freezer for about an hour before I rolled it into a ball and then placed it back in the freezer until I was ready to serve it.  I only rolled it in the toffee bits right before serving as well.  I didn't find it hard to manage at all.  Hopefully that helps those that had trouble getting it into a hard ball.  Everyone loved it!!!  I am going to make this again for sure:-)

OMG...So freakin good. I made this last minute for a New Years Eve party. The dessert I was making failed me so I had to come up with something with the ingredients that I had on hand. I had no chocolate chips so I chopped up a bunch of Herseys kisses I had from Christmas. I didn't have any nuts so I crushed a bunch of my daughters chocolate teddy graham crackers and rolled the ball in that. I didn't have anything other than Ritz crackers but man can I tell you that the sweetness of the cheese ball and the saltiness of the cracker go so well together. Everyone loved this and could not stop eating this. I would have never tried this recipe if I had not been under pressure to come up with something quick. Thanks for a great recipe!

I've made this many times now for parties and it's always a huge hit.  I seem to always be sending people back here to get the recipe.  Sometimes I cover the ball in chips and sometimes in pecans, both with great results.  We love this with Nilla Wafers and graham cracker sticks!

All I can say is YUM! I cannot believe how good this is, like chocolate chip cheesecake. I didn't have any trouble getting it to form into a ball. Like others who were successful, I let my butter and cream cheese soften by standing out, not in the microwave. It should also be noted that it is very important to use REAL butter. Margarine, especially the tub kind, can greatly affect the texture. The faster you work shaping it, the easier it is, since it will soften as it warms and make shaping difficult. I rolled mine in more mini-chips and served with regular graham crackers for an office potluck. People are currently fighting over the last bits on the plate. I will definitely make this again.
******
After making this a second time, something else that might be helpful to others who encountered shaping difficulties occurred to me. Some of the reviewers who had trouble getting the ball to hold its shape mentioned adding extra powdered sugar. Keep in mind that powdered sugar does not act like flour does in a dough. It doesn't help thicken or bind- it actually makes the mixture smoother. When making this, you might want to use a little less powdered sugar to start until you see how the consistency of the mixture is. I add the powdered sugar second to last (chips are last) when mixing this, and add it a little at a time. I hope this helps out those who had trouble getting the ball to form.

If you want to be the star attraction at a cook - out or party, this is your ticket! Every time I take this unusual cheese ball anywhere, I am bombarded with requests for the recipe. I now keep copies of this recipe printed up and I just grab them on my way out the door. At first people are a bit leery to taste it, but once they do... they are hooked! I like to serve it with chocolate graham crackers as well as the honey graham crackers. The new graham cracker sticks are also fun to use!

This recipe is a huge hit at family gatherings.  Someone always requests that I bring it.

The only thing I do differently is that I don't bother forming it into a ball and rolling in nuts.  I omit the nuts and just serve in a pretty bowl.  It's a less formal presentation, but also less fuss.

Great with graham crackers, vanilla wafers, or chocolate grahams. :)

So simple to make, perfect for parties!  I don't even bother with forming a ball, I serve this in a bowl as a dip.  I stir in 3/4 cup chocolate chips & 3/4 cup toffee bits.  Taste just like cookie dough!

Tasted amazing with chocolate graham crackers but I had a hard time forming it into a "ball"... it just wasn't stiff enough.  But I put it in a bowl and we all enjoyed it like that!

Fantastic. I brought this to a picnic in the park and received rave reviews from my foodie friends. I should also mention that there was some chaos when I arrived, and a glass of red wine was spilled over the cheese ball... and I think I will make it this way every time from now on. De-lish!

I made this a few times for the holidays last year. It is so good! I made it without the nuts. Instead I added mini chips to the outside too.  I'm going to make it again this year but I may use it as a filling for a dark chocolate cake.

I made this for our Christmas party and New Year's party - everyone loved it.  To try something different I added shredded coconut with the other ingredients.  It was a hit and gone in no time.  I served chocolate graham crackers and vanilla wafers.  Everyone liked the chocolate graham crackers better.  Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe.

This is one of our favorites!  I can't count how many times I've made it.  it's also good spread on warm toast!  I increase the powdered sugar to about a cup and a half and use a quarter cup of brown sugar.  I also decrease the butter by a couple of teaspoons.  This seems to make it a stiffer substance, but it still gets very soft if allowed to reach room temperature.  My daughter calls this chocolate chip icing.

I have to say that I LOVE this recipe.  I have made this recipe many times and I always get great comments on it. I would make sure to use butter as I think that may be the reason why some say it doesn't hold together well. I also let mine sit in the fridge overnight.  I have served mine with chocolate graham crackers, regular graham crackers, vanilla wafers, chocolate wafers,and pretzels.  Another suggestion a friend gave to me (although I haven't tried it yet) is right before serving also roll it in crushed up toffee.

I've made this recipe several times...some people are wary to try it at first, but once they do, they love it.

It makes a very soft mixture which doesn't hold it's shape very well.  So I freeze the mixture and then work quickly to shape it into a ball.  Then I keep it in the freezer just until serving since it softens quickly.  Next time I make it, I may halve the butter to see if it holds its shape better.

Also, use regular bar cream cheese and stick butter - not whipped cream cheese or tub butter/margarine.

I made this over the weekend for my Christmas party.  I followed the recipe with the exception of the pecans (we do not like pecans).  I used the nestle christmas morsels which made the cheese ball festive looking.  I also added some miniature marshmallows.  I serves them with the graham crackers sticks as suggested in another review.  My guests (especially the women) just loved it, and all wanted the recipe.  Thanks Kim for sharing your great recipe!!!

This recipe was quick and easy when going to go visit some friends. I am not a big nut fan though so I crushed up chocolate graham crackers and rolled the ball in that. It was very tasty, but I find it better to have both original and chocolate graham crackers to use for the less chocolatey taste

Good concept for a treat - original, too. However, as other raters mentioned, my cheeseball didn't harden enough even after 6 hours in the refrigerator. It is for that reason that I have to give this recipe only 4 stars. Had I had more time, I guess I could have put the ball in the freezer overnight. Maybe that's the answer to the problem.

Wow, this tastes like a very creamy cheesecake. I took it to a potluck dinner at church last night and at first everyone was just asking questions about it but as soon as they tried they loved it. They all asked me for the recipe. I took the suggestion of some others and used grahm cracker sticks. They were perfect but I do think it would be better with chocolate wafers although I     couldn't find any. It's very easy!  I used a cup and half of confectioners sugar and 3 tablespoons of brown sugar, to me it made it perfect(I like things a little sweeter). I also put it in the fridge overnight then I formed a ball in wax paper and put it in the freezer while I was at work. It was still softer than I thought but as soon as you put the pecans on it forms a nice ball.  I loved this recipe! Its very very bad but oh so yummy. I ate the rest of it for breakfast(which wasn't much after last night) bad me! :)

This is always the biggest hit when I bring it to parties!!  I call it 'Chocolate Chip Cheesecake Ball'. I think it sounds better than calling it a 'Cheese Ball'. I use twice as much vanilla extract and a little more brown sugar than the recipe calls for.  I serve it with Honey Maid Graham Cracker sticks.

I made this over the weekend for a neighborhood party.  I made it as stated in the directions except I left out the brown sugar - I didn't have any.  I actually thought the outcome was a little too sweet for my liking so I'm glad I didn't add it and I might cut some of the sugar next time.  I lined a bowl with plastic wrap and put the mixture in that and let it refrigerate for several hours.  I had no issues forming a ball at all.  I used the toffee for the outside as several suggested.  I also left the cream cheese & butter on the counter for about 2 hours to soften.  Served with choc teddy grahams, reg graham crackers and nilla waffers.  The graham crackers were the first to disappear from the plate.  I got several compliments.

Always a hit! I use about 2/3 stick of butter and increase the cream cheese to 12 ounces. I roll it in graham cracker crumbs instead of pecans since not everyone cares for nuts. Serve with vanilla wafers and chocolate graham crackers. So easy and YUMMY!

This was a HIT!!!  I did it for Christmas. It tasted like a cheese cake and we put it on Honey graham crackers.  I am not much of a nut fan.. but the nuts crushed super fine, I liked it.  Next time i want to experiment and instead of rolling into the nuts, roll it into crushed oreos (just a thought)

I made this and let some of my friends try it out....everyone loved it!    Since Graham crackers were so expensive I used Teddy Grahams...loved it!   I only refrigerated it for 1 hour instead of 2 and it did fine.

I have made this twice now and both times I get rave rewiews!  It is a big hit with the little kids (and big kids as well)  It is so easy to make.  1st time I topped with some Heath Bits and the 2nd time I didn't top it with anything, either way it is addicting!  I have now added it to my recipe box and will be making it for years to come.

Big hit at my holiday dessert party..it's a nice switch up from the usual cheese balls we make for the holidays and one that your guests will surely not expect. Everyone was pleasantly surprised by the sweet flavor! I served with Townhouse Flip Side Pretzel Crackers for the salty taste with the sweet cheese, perfect combo! Also, I doubled it and it became too hard to roll the nuts in so I plated it and added the crushed pecans to the entire top. Very tasty! Would def do this again but next time I won't double. Mmmm!

I really liked the cheese ball recipe, it was a great change from the cheese balls we usually have. I found that if you put plastic wrap in the bottom of two small round bowls and divide the recipe in half and ref. overnight the next day you will have no problem with molding the ball. If you put one half on top of the other and roll in the chips and nuts it will be a perfect ball shape, just wrap in plastic wrap and it's ready when you are.

Oh, boy I totally wanted to like this one. My kids said was too sweet, but I'll I could taste was chocolate and butter, more butter flavor then chocolate. I only used 1 stick of butter. I did this to a T, but I made this up the day before trying to roll it into pecans, it wouldn't hold shape at all and it wasn't stiff, it was thick but not stiff. I love making cheese balls, but I'm not sure what went wrong, I made a 2nd one took out the butter then it was overly sugary, I even attempted a 3rd time. And gave up. I photo'ed it in the crock, with pecans sprinkled on top but I'm soo sorry, I really thought this was going to be something we'd totally like and it wasn't. My apologies, won't be doing this one again.

This was a hit at our recent department open house. I definately recommend serving with the Mr. Christie chocolate wafers vs. graham crackers. I let the cheese ball sit for 24 hours before rolling in the walnuts and the flavours came together perfectly. I would also suggest using a mix of milk and dark chocolate flakes instead of chocolate chips to make this a more 'spreadable' treat.

I made this for my best friend's baby shower, and it was gone in a matter of minutes.  I followed the other suggestions and increased the sugar to 1 cup, the brown sugar to 3 tbl, and the vanilla to 1/2 tsp, and omitted the pecans.  I made three separate balls, and rolled one in toffee, one in peanut butter chips, and one in crushed oreos.  The oreo ball was gone first!  Hint: put the toppings in a big ziploc bag and put the ball inside to get an even and less messy coating of topping.  I served it with graham cracker sticks, oreos, and nilla wafers.  Can't wait to make it again!

Just made this again yesterday for a preschool get together. I used 3 heath bars finely chopped instead of the pecans, 1/3 less fat phili cream cheese and the 1 cup of the confectioners and it was great as usual! I just sent the recipe out  the attendees who all requested the recipe! I served it with graham sticks and apple slices.

I have made this three times now and everyone who tries it loves it! The first time I made it I softened the cream cheese and butter in the microwave for approx. 15 seconds. Because of this, it did not form into a ball but was more of a pudding like consistency. It still tasted great though and actually was almost easier to serve (I had it in a bowl with crackers around it) The next two times I made it I set the cream cheese and butter out at room temp to soften. Doing it this way made it easier to form the finished product into a ball. No matter how it finishes it easy to make and tastes great every time! Thanks for sharing!

OMG. This is wonderful. Imagine my happiness when I see that my favorite ingredients are all together in cheeseball form. This was not difficult to make at all. I made no changes, there was no need. I served mine with sliced Granny Smith/Honey Crisp apples and cinnamon grahams. Heavenly. EDITED NEXT DAY: I used the little bit that was leftover spread inbetween slices of bread and made stuffed french toast. AMAZING.

I made this for New Years eve for the kids to munch on.  They all loved it.  Used exact ingredients except I put regular size chocolate chips into small chopper and chopped them up.  Didn't roll in nuts for kids.  But I had leftovers so next day I took grand butter biscuits and cut them in half, flattened the dough, put a small scoop of this into it, rolled into to a ball put into small muffin pan and baked.  Kids LOVED them.  Will definitely make these again and again.

I have no idea why this is rated so high.  Just a gloppy mess that tasted like frosting.

Mine never became really firm, but it did stay relatively in shape after I took it out of the plastic wrap and put it on the serving plate. Thinking about the recipe, all it really is is cream cheese frosting with chocolate chips in it, so the expectation that it would ever get as firm as a "real" cheese ball is probably unrealistic. Everyone who tried it thought it was really good and several people asked for the recipe. I thought the taste of butter was a little too dominant and I might try it with only 1/4 cup next time.

The best party dessert ever!!!  I used crushed skor bar rather than pecans to roll cheeseball.  My next one, I may try toasted coconut to roll.  This has quickly become a favorite in our community.

This was wonderful.  I made it for a Super Bowl Party and everyone loved it.  I served it with combination of plain and chocolate graham crackers.  I did add the extra powdered sugar as suggested by another review and it turned out perfect.  I didn't have any trouble forming the cheese into a ball.

It tastes great. However, I think that the directions need to be altered. After letting the mixture sit in the fridge for over 3 hours it was still not hard enough to be able to form into a ball. So I just put it in a bowl without the pecans in order to serve it as a dip instead of a ball. Tasted great though!!!

This was a huge hit a party I had. It tastes like a chocolate chip cheessecake without the hard work. I think it is better with the Teddy grahams.  They seem to hold up and not break as easily.

It's true that people think you've made a dire mistake when they see the graham crackers or hear that it is a sweet cheese ball.  They always come around (and stay around the cheese ball) though.  I have put out the little teddy grahams with it which are cute and hold up to the cheese well.  Seems like the graham crackers are pretty fragile sometimes-especially the chocolate ones.

This recipe was a great success.  I served the first time at our Pastor's surprise birthday party.  I decided to roll it in mini-chocolate chips instead of pecans and everyone loved it.  Thanks so much for sharing.

I have had this recipe for about a year now and have made it about a dozen times.  No matter where I take it, I get requests for the recipe.  I had to quit making it at home because I would keep eating it until it was gone!! Everyone is a little confused that it is a dessert cheeseball, but once they get over the surprise they can't stay out of it.

Made this for an international dessert evening.  I was concerned because it is a very sweet concoction and most of my European colleagues are used to less sweet cakes and pastries but all my German friends devoured it.  Will definitely make it again!

I have to say that this recipe is one of the best I've made from this site! I prepared it the first time exactly as written & my guests enjoyed this on Christmas eve very much. Three people asked for the recipe! I didn't have any trouble with the mixture firming up, but I did use full fat cream cheese & butter with a low water content. I also lined a deep round bowl with plastic wrap, which made it really easy to then chill til firm & then roll in the goodies to serve. I served this with Nilla wafers, as suggested, sliced Granny Smith apples & the small square butter pretzels. Oh, my! The combination of the sweet cream cheese ball with the salty pretzel was a killer combination! I made it again the following week, but added peanut butter to the mixture & added an extra 1/4 cup powdered sugar & rolled it in mini chocolate chips. It was incredible & while I liked it even better than the original, my husband still liked the original recipe. I'm making it again for a gathering tomorrow. Heck, I think this stuff would even be terrific stuffed in celery stalks! Kim, thanks for a wonderfully easy & delectable treat!

Tried to make easier using whipped cream cheese, bad idea.  Could not form ball.  However even my mistake got rave reviews. Split in half and sprinkled nuts on one and toffee bits on other.  Everyone loved the toffee toppings over the nuts.  Will be making again with Reg. cream cheese.

Excellent!  Everyone devoured it!  I mixed in half mini chocolate chips and half Skor bits (I didn't bother rolling in nuts).  I served it with teddy grahams and waffle shaped pretzels (strong for dipping).  The pretzels were surprisingly my favourite!

I made half of amount of the recipe in order to serve with another savory cheese ball. It was great. Leaving cream cheese and butter at room temp is the key if you don't have electric mixer.

Made it today for a sporting event (i.e. healthy people.)  Thought it would last all night and maybe I'd get to eat leftovers tomorrow...  Wrong, it was gone in 40 minutes; the plate sat empty the rest of the night.   Yes, it was hard to mold, but I did as suggested and refrigerated several hours before shaping, then laid out a sheet of clear plastic wrap and put the nuts on that first and then scooped out the mixture on top of the nuts and sprinkled more nuts on top until I could rotate it and get whole ball coated.  Butter only.  Maybe a little extra vanilla.  Used pecans on outside but am tempted to try it with crushed chocolate graham crackers around the outside as well.   Really good.

Fabulously decadent! iI didn't have time to chill as directed, so I just mixed everything up and chilled it in a bowl for an hour or so, then served it as a "dip." It still tasted great. By the way, it is also very good spread on Oreos!!

I took this to a party and everyone enjoyed it.  I didn't pay close enough attention & got regular size chocolate chips and it was still delicious.  I also subbed Heath Toffee Bits for the pecans, YUM!  Thank you for this recipe!  (My friends enjoyed it with pretzels even more than the teddy grahams.)

I'd give it 4 1/2 stars. I made this last year for the holidays and it was very good. Those who love chocolate chip cookies and cookie dough, absolutely loved it. I served with honey and chocolate graham cracker sticks and vanilla wafers. My favorite was the chocolate graham cracker sticks. It doesn't roll into a ball easily. It actually is very sticky and messy if you try to roll it. I ended up patting more chopped pecans on top after I put it on the plate and reformed the shape. No one is going to see the bottom.

This cheese ball is Amazing! My whole family loves it, even the kids. I had to make two of them because not everyone likes nuts. The no-nut cheese ball went so fast! Now they all request this chocolate chip cheese ball for every gathering. :)

I loved this cheeseball its great for all types of get togethers. I did make a few changes, I added another pkg of cream cheese just because theres usaully a lot of people around that will be eating it, if not 1 pkg is fine. I also cut down on the chocolate chips a lot, I used only a handful. For the outside of the ball I used milk chocolate toffee bits. And for the cracker I used a regular ritz cracker. The combination of the salt from the cracker and the sweet from the ball is amazing! And if your a coconut lover some sweetened coconut would mix in good with the toffee topping.

This is ok. Very rich. I had a hard time getting mine to set up, had to have it in the freezer to make into ball. Next time I think I will use less butter (probably 1/2, and add a little peanut butter.)

This was very good, and easy to make but I found the recipe made too much for my 6 people. Maybe my friends aren't as crazy about sweets as I had hoped. I served it with several different kinds of cookies and crackers and cut up fruit. Had several requests for the recipe. Thank you for sharing.

I made this for a Holiday Party and served with different kinds of cookies. I powdered my hands before handling the mix because it was very sticky. For Xmas, I opted out of the nuts and rolled in christmas colored sprinkles all over the entire ball. I chilled overnight and that helped as well. YUM! Tasted like chocolate cheese cake!

I was looking to replicate a cream cheese ball I had at a party and the cream cheese part of this recipe was great, but I think it needed more stuff! Easily twice as many chocolate chips, toffee bits, and walnuts mixed into the ball. I coated it with toffee bits too. Served with whole wheat honey pretzel twists and little pretzels.

If you have only saved and not made this recipe you are missing the boat.  Everyone at the party asked for this recipe including all the men. I did increase the con. sugar to one cup and brown sugar to 3 tablespoons and rolled in Heath bar bits.  It is amazing!

I'm giving it 4 stars, even though I was not able to roll this into a ball.  It never firmed up enough and I added about 1/2 cup more conf.sugar than called for.  But - this tastes great!  I served it with graham crackers, stella d'oro cookies, nilla wafers and we even spread it on the brownies.  Mine came out more like a spread, but nobody complained.

What a fun recipe!  I took it for New Years wanting something different from the other cheese balls and dips.  Everyone LOVED it and asked for the recipe.  It reminded me of graham crackers and cream cheese frosting.  I rolled mine in crushed graham crackers and pecans.  Yum.  I think we will be having this every New Year's Eve.

Delicious recipe!!  Instead of making one big ball, I formed the dough into bite size individual balls and then rolled them in the nuts and it turned into a finger food dessert!!  They were a huge hit! Next time going to try the toffee bits instead of pecans:)

Be careful of this one, I swear it is addictive!  I made the recipe with 1/3 fat cream cheese, about 1 cup of pwdered sugar,  and  1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and it was great.  I put it in the freezer and was able to shape it into a ball within an hour.  I left it in the fridge overnight and then coated it with crushed graham crackers, it is easier to shape when I coated it with the graham crackers.

I guess I am the only nay-sayer here on this recipe. It is very rich and sweet and not in a good way. after I was done buying the ingredients plus the ghram crackers to serve with it, I had spent close to $12, and only about 2 tablespoons was eaten from it at a christmas party I took it to. I had no issues with rolling into a ball , it looked nie but wasnt popular.

My circle of friends and I call this a "Fat Ball".  I've been making it for years and it's always a big hit.  It's also known as Cannoli Dip.  I omit the nuts.  Enjoy!!!

SO EASY and pretty darn tasty! Made as directed and holy cow it makes a lot! It's so good though - I have half the batch in the freezer, as there was no way we'd eat through all of it. Served with graham crackers and mini vanilla wafers. It was a hit at a gathering at home!

This is such a fun appitizer/dessert to take to a gathering. I make just a couple of changes though. I add peanut butter chips in addition to the chocolate chips. And instead of rolling the ball in the pecans, I roll it in finely crushed oreos! I also have pretzels on the side (which is WONDERFUL) in addition to the graham cracker sticks. It gives people an option of sweet, sweet or sweet and salty. I always get requests for this! Enjoy!

I took this to a GNO, expecting it to be devoured.  The problem with this recipe is that if it's served as an appetizer, people don't want to mix it with the savory stuff.  You have to wait until 'after' the initial food is served and then bring it out.  Once the girls had switched to the sweet stuff, they raved about it!  A definite indulgance!

Sorry to only give this 3 stars, but I think it confused my guests. I served this at one Christmas party (as an appetizer) a couple of days before Christmas and NO ONE touched it. I guess they were going after my more traditional, savory tasting appetizers. I thought I would try to serve it again (since it was untouched) at my Christmas dinner.  One person out of 7 tried it and did not go back for seconds.  Sooooo....I don't know, I can't explain it...I tried it and it tasted good, and it looked ok, I just didn't have much success with it.  I explained to people that it tasted to me a bit like chocolate chip cheesecake (which I thought would get them to try it since they could get a good feeling for what flavor they were going to be tasting), but they all gravitated to my cajun meatballs, the bacon-wrapped smokies, the spinach dip, etc. I'm not sure if I'll ever try this again.

This is always such a hit! I roll my cheeseball in graham cracker crumbs. It makes it easier to form into a ball and it looks great displayed!

You cannot go wrong with this!! A MONKEY COULD MAKE THIS!!! EXCELLENT! Like someone else said in a review, it reminds me of a cross between a cannoli and a cheesecake. I might use Oreo flavored sugar cones, or even regular, broken into pieces for dipping next time. I used chocolate chips on the inside, and rolled the ball in crushed oreos on the outside. YUMMO. I'll experiment with crushed Heath Bar, Reese Cups, even peppermint patty in the future. The hostess at a party I brought this to scraped the empty plate to save collect a tablespoon or so from the streaks remaining before letting me wash the plate! YES, it's THAT GOOD.

Excellent recipe!  A great item when you want to bring something "different" to a gathering.  I do reccomend using less powdered sugar and more brown sugar.  I used equal amounts of each and it is still very rich.

I was soooo excited to find this recipe.  A co-worker brought it to a work party we had and I loved it.  I asked a few times for the recipe but she "conveniently" kept forgetting to write it down.  I followed the recipe exactly except I rolled it in nuts and mini-choc. chips.  If you have trouble rolling it into a ball, lay a piece of saran wrap on the counter and put the mixture in the middle and wrap it up then shape into a ball.  This keeps you from having cheeseball all over your hands.  This is definitely a must try!!!

A good finger food when you want to put out something sweet along with traditional appetizers.  If you like chocolate chip cheesecake, this recipe is for you.  This recipe works best when made with real butter, not margarine.  The butter firms up much better.

This was great!  I only used 1/2 cup confectioners sugar, but follwed the rest of the recipe.  I put the ball in the middle of a beautiful ceramic vegie/dip dish and put chocolate graham crackers, vanilla wafers, graham cracker sticks, in the bowls around the dip.  It made a nice presentation and everybody loved it!  A keeper recipe!

BTW, you can get all of the above crackers/cookies at the dollar store!

I have been requested to make this for Thanksgiving, so I tested it out last night.  I made three changes - I actually added small pecan chips to the cheese ball and finely chopped the chocolate chips (they seemed a little large for a cracker). Finally, when I was finished, I lined a small mixing bowl with plastic wrap and put the mixture in that.  When it had set, I put a plate over it and inverted it onto the plate, removed the plastic wrap and pressed the pecans onto it.  It's a little easier to serve this way and the crackers look so pretty fanned around it.  Thanks for sharing!!

Don't tell the ladies of the club how much butter is used in this recipe!  Although every one tried it, I had 75% of it left over.  I would make it again for my kids, but reduce the butter and try adding in some mini marshmallows or cookie chunks.  I seved it with graham cracker sticks that I found at the store.  It is a fun alternative to the usual cheese ball.  Mine kept its shape just fine.  Refrigerated it overnight before serving it.

Very tasty! Didn't have any trouble forming into a ball, even without adding additional powdered sugar.  Also, added Butterscotch chips and it tasted just like turtle cheesecake. Will definately make again.

I made this a while back and brought it to work. I did not use any nuts, I rolled the cheese ball in mini chocolate chips. I also brought along Cinnamon Teddy Grahams as a reviewer had suggested. I had a hard time getting people to try it, they were apprehensive. Those who were adventurous thought it was very good. I had a hard time keeping my hands out of it. I thought it was great!

This was an easy treat to take to Thanksgiving dinner. I was glad it was such an easy recipe because I had to write it down from memory for a family member.

I didn't read the suggestions to add more sugar but will definitely do so next time to see if it helps it shape up. I rolled mine in mini chocolate chips rather than pecans just to cut something out of my shopping list. I served it with the graham sticks.

Made exactly as the recipe lists it (without more sugar), I wouldn't make it in a ball. I'd put it in my round relish tray and surround it with a variety of grahams and wafers and strawberries and serve it like a dessert dip. Super simple to make and take with you anywhere and bringing home a clean platter is always ideal!

This has quickly become one of our favorite desserts!  The first time I made it, I attempted it in ball form as the recipe indicates.  That was disastrous as there was no way the gooey mixture was going to form into anything close to resembling a solid ball.  However, I didn't really care what form it was as the taste was delicious!  We've made it several times now, and we just make it into a dip.  Sometimes we sprinkle pecans on top, and sometimes we just leave them off.  Either way, it is awesome when spread on graham crackers!  The best part is that we always have the ingredients on hand, and it is a great way to use up cream cheese that is needing to be finished off.

Do not hesitate to make this......it IS wonderful !!!  I've made this a few times and people love it and ask for the recipe.  I serve it with chocolate graham crackers or pretzels.  It's quick and easy.  I roll it in toffee chips and omit the nuts.

I made this to bring to a weekend gathering so I just put it into a bowl vs trying to roll it into a ball. I figured that wouldn't work while traveling.  I've had this recipe saved for a couple of years and was so happy to finally use it!!! I was not let down! :)  My sister in law and I gobbled it up! Served it with chocolate graham crackers. Would also be great with vanilla wafers!

My family LOVED this! It was so easy to make and was delicious. I'm going to try to use part of this recipe to make a no bake cheese cake!

I also experienced where the ball was too sticky even after adding the extra sugar.  I also did not heat in the microwave to soften the ingredients.  Might try it again with 1/2 the butter since it did want to have a really good flavor and idea.

This recipe is easy to make and a crowd pleaser!  Do NOT be fooled by what appears to be a small amount of ingredients - I doubled the recipe thinking that it couldn't be nearly enough for the gathering that I was going to - I was wrong!  This recipe as stated above is plenty for a crowd of children and adults.  I served with pretzels (the best choice in my opinion), chocolate animal crackers as I could not find chocolate graham crackers, and Nilla Wafers.  As another reviewer noted - if you let the butter and cream cheese soften for an hour or so, you do not need extra sugar to form a ball.  It was sticky but formed a ball not problem.  I used the leftover mini chips, some Heath bits I had leftover, and the pecans to coat the "ball" to tasty results.

This was FABULOUS! My family of four devoured it, and by the second night, there was only a tad bit remaining. I used real butter and regular cream cheese (let it reach room temp...about an hour), and added a few more chocolate chips. I was skeptical as to whether or not it would set up. I had a perfectly sized deep bowl that I lined with saran wrap and formed the mixture to take the shape of the bowl, then smoothed out the top (which became the bottom). I left it in the fridge overnight and by the next day, it was perfect! I flipped the bowl over and it popped right out...shaped just like a cheese ball. I completely covered it in heath bits and scattered some milk chocolate morsels on it as well. Will definitely come back to this recipe. Served with honey and chocolate graham crackers. Great for parties!

I got this recipe from a coworker a few years back. Its my go to thing when I need to make something for a party. Most times people aren't too sure about it at first but once they taste it, I almost never come home with any. I do it without the pecans cause I'm not a fan of those and I feel like its a bit risky with nut allergies. Normally just pour it into a bowl instead of making a ball out of it. Either way, this is always a hit!

I did not have a problem forming the ball.  I did get mixed reviews.  Some people raved about it and loved it.  Others thought it was too sweet and that there was too much butter.  I didn't have mini-chocolate chips.  I took regular chocolate chips and put them in a bullet.  It's a great recipe.  I served with graham crackers.  Thank you Kim!

WOW!I would never think to make s cheese ball as a dessert but this is "the Bomb"!!! So very easy to make. I had no problems with the recipe. The cheese ball is nice and firm after chilling in the fridge. I spread mine on graham crackers & chocolate bears & it is excellent on sliced apples! My husband was reluctant to try this & his first bite he said "WOW, you put it in your mouth and it takes a second or two to really taste the flavors and then it is like an explosion of goodness!" Definitely try this recipe & don't change a thing! It is perfect as written! Thank you Kim for sharing such a delightful recipe. I will definitely make again & again. :)

I made this as a Christmas appetizer and everybody loved it!  I rolled it in toffe bits and served it with chocolate Grahm crackers.   You might want to get two boxes of the crackers if there will be lots of kids at the party as they seem to like just eating the crackers alone.  This will be a new staple for us.  You can make it ahead and it's a no bake dish which is great.  I also refrigerated mine for four hours before rolling and had no problems.

I love this recipe, I havent had a chocolate chip cheeseball in years and thankfully I found this recipe, no complaints with flavor at all! But,  I used chocolate chips to cover the outside instead of pecans and I also doubled the recipe...

This ended up being a dip instead of a ball because the mixture was too runny to mold. I did use margarine instead of real butter, so that could have been the problem. I did add some toffee pieces along with the pecans. I served it with chocolate graham crackers.. It was just okay for me.

This is a good recipe as is.  I also like to use coconut and chocolate chips for the recipe.  For Easter, I used chopped jelly beans instead of the chocolate chips!  It was colorful and it tasted wonderful!

OMG it was a good thing there were people to help eat this or I would have just sat down and eaten the entire thing!  Two of my favorites, chocolate and cream cheese, yummy!  I found chocolate wafers in the cookie aisle on the top shelf behind a column.

WARNING: Do NOT use reduced-fat cream cheese. I made that mistake and it wouldn't form into a ball -- it was just a blob!

Afterward I made it with regular cream cheese and it was amazing. I roll mine in Heath toffee bits. Altogether it tastes like cheesecake! So addicting!

Very good!  I big hit with my family.  This recipe does make a lot and it's quite rich so make sure you have a decent sized crowd to eat it.  I crushed up smarties and candy canes instead of choc chips and it was delish!  Rolled in Skor (toffee) bits.

I switched it up a bit and used skor toffee bits to coat the cheese ball with.  Next time I would omit the butter or just use 1/4 cup.  Otherwise, it's a great treat!

Delicious!  I placed the cheese ball in the freezer to firm it up then rolled it in Heath bar pieces.  Huge hit at family party.  I agree with other reviewers that it tastes like chocolate chip cheesecake.

this was a hit, although i bought the wrong chips (not mini) everyone loved it. i used 1 ff cream cheese and one 1/3 less fat, i did use the butter but if i make it again i will omit to save on calories because it didnt make a diff as far as taste goes to me.

Everyone LOVED this! It is a bit soft to form into a ball, so I did as someone else suggested and put it in a lined bowl, refrigerated, flipped out onto a plate and pressed the coating on the outside.  Next time I'm going to try using 1/4 of the butter. I think that is what's making it so soft.

I made this exactly as directed in the recipe, but it wouldn't shape into a ball, so I used it as a dip instead. It was more like a thick cake batter. My daughter had the same problem and she too used it as a dip. It was delicious.

A friend a work brought this as a dip, and it was so delicious that I asked for the recipe. She explained that it was supposed to be a ball, but it didn't turn out that way. I read some reviews before I made it to find that you must use real butter and the full fat cream cheese (not 1/3 or fat free). Either way, it's delicious. I can't wait for everyone else to try it out!

LOVE this recipe.  Have made it 5 times for different gatherings.  I use crushed Heath bars instead of nuts to give it a little different taste.  MUST use real butter & cream cheese if you want it as a ball.  You can use the lighter fat content but you will have to put it in a bowl as a dip.  It is always a hit.

This was a wonderful alternative to typical appetizers. I covered mine in chocolate buttercream frosting, over the chopped pecans. It tasted just like chocolate chip cheesecake. We termed it a "Cheesecake Ball". Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Delicious! So simple to make. We molded it into a football and served it with both regular and chocolate graham crackers on game day. Everybody loved it! As other reviewers mentioned, just remember this is a dessert, not an appetizer, as it is sweet. Thanks for a great recipe - I'll make this again!

I thought this was just okay. I might have liked it better with heath bar, snickers, butterfinger pieces. Something with a little more..."kick", instead of the chocolate chips. My co-workers enjoyed but I wasn't that impressed.

I doubled the powdered sugar as suggested by many other reviewers otherwise followed the recipe. I used my kitchen aid and whipped it to death as another reviewer suggested. I also used powered sugar to coat my hands as I tried to mold it into a cheese ball. I gave up, used plastic wrap and wrapped it up into a ball shape and threw it in the freezer. That seemed to work out better for me! Served with graham crackers.

I made three of these for a wedding reception this weekend. I always get lots of compliments and requests for the recipe when I serve this. I rolled mine in more mini chocolate chips rather than the pecans. I served with graham crackers, 100 calorie oreo snack crackers and vanilla wafers. Excellent.

I served this at a chocolate themed party.  It was a big hit.  I shaped it into a heart and topped it with mini chocolate chips.  I didn't have pecans on hand.  One guest said it was like eating cannoli filling.  I served it with graham crackers and some strawberries for garnish.

Thanks for this great recipe.  A keeper in my family for many occasions. I don't worry about shaping in a ball.  I put in a decorative bowl with a seal-able lid and refrigerate.  I sprinkle 1/2 with nuts (because most kids don't like nuts-my don't).  Use cute little spreading knives for the kids to spread on graham crackers or use graham cracker Scooby snacks for dipping.  Kids LOVE it.

Brought this to my boss' Christmas party...and also to the company potluck. Everyone that tried it just RAVED about it! The only thing I did differently from the recipe is that I did not roll my ball in pecans. Instead, I shaped the ball into a snowman shape, and I added a face with icing. The cheese knives stuck out as the arms. :)

I thought this was really good.  I was surprised though because it wasn't received well at my holiday party.   I think people were confused by a sweet cheese ball.  The flavor was really good though.

I followed one reviewers recommendation and added a Tablespoon of Cocoa.  I also used chopped bittersweet chocolate instead of semisweet chips.  This is a great recipe, Kim.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this for a Christmas party and it was soooo good!  Tasted like chocolate chip cheesecake.  I did replace the pecans with crumbled up chocolate chip cookies and it was great!  You should defiantly try this!!

This is easy and SO good!  I made this cheese ball for a baby shower I hosted last fall, and it was a huge hit.  I served it with ginger snaps, graham crackers, and vanilla wafers.  The ginger snaps were best with it IMO!

Maybe I did something wrong but it WOULD NOT form into a ball, even after trying to freeze it. Got it into a bowl and sprinkled with crushed heath bars and served with graham crackers. It tasted okay, I wouldn't make it again.

We've been making this for several years now.  I like to roll it in mini M&Ms for color and serve on a tray with mini pretzels for the salty sweet flavor.  I have made 2 smaller balls and frozen one for another time, it freezes very nicely.

TASTY!! Read other reviews and made with real butter, used 1 cup of confectioners' sugar, and 3 tablesppons of brown sugar. Rolled in extra mini chocolate chips instead of nuts. Big hit at our Labor Day party! Days later it is still being talked about!

Great desert for a party.  I like using the graham cracker bears or sticks on the side.  It's quick, easy, tasty, and it goes over well.

Yummy! I have made this three times in the past 2 months, and always get rave reviews. I do not use the nuts, and just leave it in a bowl instead of forming a ball. It is great with the cinnamon graham sticks, although I could eat it plain.

I made this for a Christmas party and was disappointed to find that even after an HOUR in the freezer, it was still too soft to form into a ball.  When I unwrapped the plastic wrap from it, it just oozed into a gluey pile.  Not too pretty!  I decided to use it as filling for some Famous brand chocolate wafer cookies and I made little chocolate cookie sandwiches, and people loved them, but I was annoyed that the recipe was so unreliable.  I won't be making this one again!

This is very sweet.  It got good comments at a party.  However, I was not able to form a "ball".  I served it as a dip.  Even after chilling, it never got firm enough to hold its shape.

Excellent! I get usual requests for this one at pot-lucks! The first time I made this I threw the ingredients in the Kitchen-Aide and started working on another dish.  I then realized I whipped it too much and it would not hold.  I just placed the mixture into a massive martini glass and called in a Chocolate Martini dip!  The second time I was more cautious of my mixing and placed in a bowl (once wrapped in saran) and then put in the freezer to speed up the molding. Instead of rolling in chocolate chips I chop up praline nut mix and skor bits - gives it a little toffee flavour - YUMMY

I doubled the batch, but used just over 3/4 cup of butter per previous reviews to reduce amount of butter. My cheesecake ball was still soft after chilling in the fridge for about six hours.  Thankfully, I was shaping it into a football for a Super Bowl party, and I didn't need a perfect circle.  Perhaps adding more powdered sugar will stiffen the texture.  It's very tasty though!  Update:  Everyone loved this at the Super Bowl party I took it to, and one of the pregnant girls could not stop eating it.  It was added to her shower menu!

I didn't think this was very good...it tasted too much like butter.  If I make it again I'll use 1/4 cup butter and more confectioner's sugar.  I also had trouble shaping it into a ball, it stayed very soft even after being in the fridge overnight.

ok so I made this for a christmas party and at first i didn't like it.  I thought it tasted like cream cheese frosting and it was too sweet.  However after it set in the fride overnight,  I couldn't stop eating it!  I guess the flavors had time to mix?  i don't know, but i LOVE this now!  I was addicted to it.  I served it with chocolate and honey graham crackers, however I prefer Triskets.  The salty/sweet combination is 100% better!  I love this and will probably be fixing it for every party I go to!

Very good- but I agree with others that this is nothing more than cream cheese frosting...in a ball.....without the cake. (Actually, when thinking of this as a frosting ball, the possibilities are endless. I bet lemon would be great in the spring, maybe with added blueberries or nuts...perhaps white chocolate chips.)

I added finely chopped maraschino cherries (that were really well drained and dried) to this recipe for a black forest taste. I also thought about doing this recipe with crushed candy canes in addition to the chips. That would be a fun holiday twist.

So good! Easy to make, and tasted wonderful! I followed the directions almost exactly and had no problems. I used a little less butter than called for (only so I could act like it was slightly healthier than it could have been).

It was a little sticky when I was forming it into a ball, but it worked just fine for me!

I added about 1/3 of a cup of heavy creay when I was whipping the cream cheese. This made it light and fluffy when I was done. I also toasted the pecans before I chopped them. I served my dip with graham sticks.

I made this for a party for some teens. Needless to say, it disappeared immediately. The only thing I did differently was roll it in mini M&M's so it would have more color. I think this a great idea and nice break from the traditional salty cheeseball.

After seeing this recipe for the longest time, I finally made it for a party this weekend. I wish I had read the reviews before making it and learned about all the other yummy toppings that can be used instead of the pecans. The pecans seemed to be an odd addition to this cheeseball and they had a very distracting taste that just didn't sem to mix well with the chocolate chips. I will certainly be willing to try this again without the pecans!

Excellent Recipe with great compliments.  Made a couple of changes based on other comments:  skipped the brown sugar, added oreo cookie crumbs to the filling, and then made the topping of mini chocolate chips, toffee bits, and oreo cookie crumbs.  Delicious!

Very good.  I used the Scooby Doo Graham cracker "dog bones" and Nilla wafers.  Make sure you put your cookies around the ball or people just won't know what to do with the ball.

Since it was to be served outside on a warm day I didn't want it to soften to quickly.  So I froze it and scooped it into a bowl so it looked just like chocolate chip ice cream.  It was the hit of the party.  Everyone kept calling it the ice cream dip.

I was really wanting to like this recipe.  With the high rating and good reviews I  normally always like the end results.  I guess I was just expecting a different taste.  It was still good, but I dont think I would make it for myself.  Everyone else that tried it really liked it.  So I would probably make it for get-togethers, but not one of my favorites.

I just made this for a party tomorrow. OMG its amazing! if it weren't so bad for you i'd have eaten the whole thing! I doubled the recipe and used 2 1/4 c powdered sugar. When i'm not pregnant and watching my weight i'm going to make this again and keep the whole thing to myself! Im going to serve it with the 3 different kinds of garahm cracker sticks.

I gave this 5 stars because it tasted awesome but for some reason mine was not thick enough to stay in a ball.  I ended up serving it in a bowl.

I brought this to a party and served with graham crackers and people were hesitant to try it. I think that was because they couldn't quite figure out what it was. I thought it tasted fine, and so did the people I convinced to try it, but I ended up bringing most of it home. Good if your friends are more adventurous than mine!

This was very good. I brought to work and also shared at home with my family. As it is Christmas time, I used Andes Mint chips and "rolled" my cheese ball in Christmas jimmies.

I put mine in the freezer for a couple of hours to harden it before I rolled it in shaved chocolate chips. I also put some whole chocolate chips in the ball itself and served with graham crackers. It took one person to dig in a go crazy about it before the others tried it but had many people ask for the recipe. Every time I serve this, people love it and now they request it for our yearly gatherings. I cannot imagine why anyone would give it less than the five stars unless they just don't like sweets.

When I made this, I added a little extra brown sugar because I love it but reduced the confectioner's sugar, and mixed some heath bits throughout and rolled the ball in the bits as well.  This got rave reviews at the party I brought it to.

I made this and it wasnt what I thought it was going to be.  Way too much of a good thing wrapped all together.  Better to leave it separate.  (and I have a huge sweet tooth.)  Just came out to be a big pile of mush.

I always just whip this up as a dip and serve it with those graham sticks.  It is always a hit and if you skip the 'making it into a ball' portion, super quick and easy!  My friend likes to eat it with salty things like pretzel sticks!

I have had this several times (oh it's so yummy) but it was the first time I made it.  After reading several reviews that mentioned it didn't "set", I tried something that worked pretty well.  I poured the mixture into a small bowl line with plastic wrap and let it chill overnight.  By the next day it was very firm and I just peeled off the plastic wrap and rolled in mini-chips.  I served with graham cracker strips.

this recipe was awesome!! i had to give our several copies of it. i highly recommend the toffee chips idea. mix some into the ball with the chocolate chips, and coat the ball with the toffee rather than the chocolate chips.

I LOVE this cheeseball!  Although, I use reduced fat cream cheese and don't form it into a ball.  I just mix it up w/o nuts and use it as a dip!  Everyone loves it and I've printed the recipe cards out a lot!  Great for any get together!

This is sooo good. I have made it a few times and it gets gobbled up. I will make it for Thanksgiving. When I make it, I do it one day ahead of time and wrap it in wax paper and put it in the freezer and at the very last minute form it into a ball with new wax paper. That way it does not melt in your hands. It's yummy

I made this cheeseball for a potluck at work and out of the zillion desserts that were brought, this receipe went the fastest.  I did put in an entire cup of powdered sugar, 3 tablespoons of brown sugar, and a 1/2 tsp. of vanilla. Tasted just like cookie dough....Served with broken sugar cones, graham crackers, and chocolate wafers....Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

I have made this recipe several times, and it's always a huge hit.  Fantastic taste, and super-easy to prepare.  Next time, I plan to use white chocolate chips in addition to the "chocolate chocolate" ones, and some raspberry powder added to the cream cheese.  Another tip I want to mention is this:  don't use soft cream cheese, as it tends to not set up as well as the block variety.  Thank you for this teriffic recipe!  ***AN UPDATE***  I did try the variation on this recipe (added raspberry flavoring I got from the cake decorating section of a craft store, and chopped white chocolate morsels), and it, too, was a HUGE success!  Tasted just like black raspberry ice cream.  When served on chocolate wafers, it had a black forest-y taste to it.  Can also be served on graham crackers or even vanilla wafers.  Thanks again, Kim, for the inspiration!

I had no problem making it into a ball.  It is a little sticky.  The best way to do it is to lay wax paper out on counter  spread with nuts (or chocolate chips) then spoon out the chilled mixture.  the nuts will coat the outside so it will not stick to plastic wrap or your hands

This is a wonderful dessert that always gets rave review and comments!  For Christmas I rolled it in mini chips, chocolate jimmies & red & green jimmies.  I'm not big on the pecans with it personally.

I also advocate using only real butter and "real" cream cheese.  I wouldn't want to waste such expensive ingredients on something that didn't turn out!

Excellent! I have been making this recipes for years and I have never had any trouble with it staying in a ball, but I refrigerate it overnight. Also, if you want to add nuts, mix them into the ball - if you put them on the outside then the first few people get a lot of nuts and other people don't get any.

THIS IS REALLY GOOD. EVERYTIME I MAKE THIS, FOR THE GIRLS AT WORK, IT IS GONE IN NO TIME AT ALL.
I TOO HAD A PROBLEM WITH GETTING THE BALL TO HOLD TOGETHER, BUT I JUST GOT MY HANDS A LITTLE MESSY, AND THEN PUT IT IN THE FREEZER, AND IT WAS OKAY. 
I SERVED IT WITH HONEY MAID GRAHAM STICKS.
I ALWAYS HAVE TO GIVE COPIES OF THIS RECIPE.
IT WAS A REAL HIT.

Everyone has loved this recipe.  I did not make into a ball, but I placed it in a nice dish and served it more as a dip topped with nuts.  I also am not a fan of semi-sweet chocolate chips so I used milk chocolate chips.  I make this often!

I sent this to my husbands work for a work party.  I wasn't able to try it before sending it because I wanted it to stay pretty.  I wish I had though, when he brought the leftovers home I was embaressed by it.  It was definitely not as good as I had hoped.  I will not make this again.

Mmmmmm!  So good!  Like cheesecake spread on a chocolate cracker!  Hint:  don't melt the butter.  Let it sit out at room temp for awhile.  I did that and mine made nicely into a ball.  Served it with graham crackers and chocolate wafers.  Was a huge hit!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This cheeseball tasted GREAT!!  However, I never did get it into the shape of a ball.  I used already softened cream cheese (in a tub) instead of a brick of cream cheese, so I'm wondering if that was the reason??

I took this cheeseball to a Chanuka Potluck and called it "Chocolate Chesseball Dip" instead!  Many people asked me for the recipe!

I'd make it again using a brick of cream cheese next time.

this is very easy to make. after the 3 hours chilling time, i wasn't pleased with the consistency. so, i left it in the fridge overnight, and it definitely hardened up -- like i expected in the first place. it's very tasty, but in my opinion pretty rich -- it reminds me a lot of a creamcheese icing, actually --  you probably don't want to eat a whole ton of this in one sitting due to the calories!! i'd make this again, ahead of time, to allow for the extra chilling. the honey maid graham sticks are a great idea too.

I  was looking for a new cheese ball recipe and came across this one.  I plan on making this again.  It was delicious--it really did taste like chocolate cheese cake.  I made it according to the recipe.  There was no problem forming it into a ball because it was refrigerated overnight.

It's so much easier to just put this in a lidded container & scoop it out than it is to try to fool with making into a ball.  And we don't bother with the nuts then.  (Too many people don't care for nuts or are allergic)  We serve it with graham cracker scooby snacks or vanilla wafers.

This is a great dessert ball :) I did as others suggested and added an extra 1/2 cup of powdered sugar had no problem shaping it into a ball. I would suggest not adding extra chocolate chips as this makes it a bit difficult to spread. Letting it set in the fridge for a couple of days makes it better!

Made it for a Super Bowl party.  It was a hit!  I substituted the chopped pecans for Heath toffee bits.  I separated it into 2 balls instead of 1 large one.  Some had trouble getting it into a ball...I scooped it onto a piece of saran wrap and forced it into a ball, wrapped it and refrigerated it.  Then when ready to serve, I just sprinkled it with toffee bits instead of trying to roll it.  Served with cinnamon graham crackers.

I found this recipe by accident several years ago and, since then,  I don't think I would be allowed into a party without bringing it.  I can't even  count the number of times I have given out the recipe.   i have only used chocolate toffee bits for coating, but I'm sure it's just as good with nuts.   It is a very easy recipe, but not something that can be put together at the last minute.  I usually try to make it a day ahead of time and let it set in the refrigerator overnight and I've never had a problem with it setting.   Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Sinfully delicious and so incredibly easy!!  Used Philly Cream Cheese, 1 stick salted butter and other ingredients as directed.  Only change was to put all ingredients in the bowl at once and mixed all ingredients thoroughly once.  Keeping the mixing to a minimum keeps the consistency firm to form a ball after chilling.  I also chilled it in a round bowl lined with plastic wrap to keep the handling to a minimum.  Wonderful treat.

My co-workers loved it.  I thought it was pretty good- think I'd definitely add the additional 1/4c of confectioner's sugar others mentioned as I'd have liked it a little firmer.

Tried this recipe exactly as original, minus  the pecan coating.
Divided the cheese ball into two plastic wrap coated small round bowls, refrigerated for a few hours.  It was so easy to serve this by unwrapping the plastic wrap, turning it upside down on a platter. Dusted with dark cocoa powder and served with assorted crackers and sliced fruit.  Tasted just like cheese cake.  Nice to have a second cheese ball in the fridge for personal indulgence.  Will probably make it again for Easter.

I made this exactly as stated and some liked it but for me, as one friend said, it was like eating frosting.  I served with Ritz crackers.  I would not make this again.  Just put a tub of icing and put some nuts on it.  I see this as having no redeeming value.  Sorry!

Just made this for a party and it was a complete hit. I followed some of the advice I read here: 1) I used full fat butter and cream cheese; 2) I used (close to) a cup of confectioner sugar instead of 3/4 of a cup; 3) I let  the dairy soften by leaving it out on the counter for about  an hour; 4) I let the mixture chill in a metal bowl. With all of that, I didn't have any trouble forming the mixture into a ball. I rolled it in toffee instead of nuts and served it with graham cracker dippers. It got rave reviews at the party and I can't wait to make it again.

I tried this recipes and just like some of other recommendations: added a little more powdered and brown sugar. I also lined the bowl with wax paper so it came straight. 
I also melted some of the chips for more choclate taste and I crushed peanuts that were coated in toffee and rolled the ball in it. 
It tasted like Cracker Jacks.

This is a fabulous recipe, but I like EVEN MORE chocolate, so I used cocoa powder in place of the brown sugar, and rolled it in more mini chocolate chips instead of pecans.  I am always asked to bring this to get-togethers!!

I added 1/4c confectioner's sugar, as some of the other reviews suggested.  It wasn't very easy to shape, but I put it in plastic wrap overnight, then dumped it out onto a plate, and it was fine.  I put crushed chocolate graham crackers on top, instead of pecans.  I sampled it, of course, and it is delicious!  I'm taking it to a Halloween party tonight and serving with chocolate graham crackers.  Check out the photo I took--to make it festive, I added pipe cleaners for "spider" legs, and served on a platter that looks like a spider web.  You could add eyes, etc, but I didn't want to do all that, lol! Looks pretty cool, and I know it will be a hit!

This was one of the easiest recipes.  I increased the confectioners sugar to 1 cup and the brown sugar to 3 tbsp.  I also pureed toffee, pecans, almonds and chocolate chips together for the coating.  It was a huge hit in my house!

I tried this recipe over the Christmas holidays and I could not get it form a ball too mushy.  I even tried to place it in the freezer but nothing helped.  Not sure what I could have done wrong.  So I had to make do with what I had.  I decided to layer the chocolate chip cheese with crushed graham crackers.  Like a lasagna.  I added too much graham cracker (my fault) and it over power the chocolate chip cheese.  Although the chocolate chip cheese was tasty I could not form the ball.  More than likely I will not make this recipe again.

I was concerned about this cheese ball because it seemed too soft but it ended up being a bigger hit at our New Year's party than my traditional cheese ball.  I'm glad I made it!  I did a snowman design by mixing in the nuts, rolling in powdered sugar, and then using more mini chips for the buttons and face of the snowman.  Very cute!  Served with graham crackers.  Everyone loved it and said it tasted like cookie dough.  This is a keeper!

My sister made t for Christmas Eve and it was gone in minutes. I made it last night for a get together and everyone loved it.  I made is without the chocolate chips (for a friends) and served it with plain and chocolate tea biscuits and they really complimented each other. I will definitely make this again.  I may even experiment with new flavors of "cheesecake".

This was disappointing. I love cheesecake and all types of dessert but this was just too sweet. I didn't have any trouble forming it into a ball.  Maybe if I used less vanilla or sugar it would suit me?  I really wanted this to work.

I made this for Christmas and it was THE HIT of all the food!  I made it just as the recipe is written.  The only thing different I did was split it into two balls and roll one in the finely chopped pecans and one in the toffee pieces.  I served them with chocolate graham crackers.  They were both delicious!  Everyone loved them and wanted the recipe.  Thanks for a wonderfully decadent dessert that is different than the norm!

I took the advice of one reviewer that put it in a ball shaped bowl, lined with plastic wrap. It made 2 nice sized balls.I chilled them until we were ready to eat it. Turned it out onto a bowl, I then pressed on heath bits as recommended as well. 
This is such and easy and delicious recipe! Inexpensive too!

Tried this for a Christmas party. Besides my higher math messing up the amount I made, (which turned out to be a ton) it turned out fabulous. People stood around the tray of cream cheese and cookies and ate, and ate, and ate. It was an amazing hit. Will definitely be making this again.

Excellent dessert dish and SO easy to make!  Tastes just like chocolate chip cheesecake.  We used chocolate graham crackers and pretzels for dippping...the pretzels were a better choice because of the salty-sweet contrast.

Delicious dessert cheese ball! I used 1 cup powdered sugar as it wasn't "stiff" enough, and instead of the nuts rolled it in mini chocolate chips and toffee bits. I served it with regular graham crackers and chocolate teddy grahams as the store had no regular chocolate graham crackers. Easy to make and tasty!

I have to say I was so excited to make these and looking forward to eating them but they really did not turn out at all .they were way too soft, even after adding the additional sugar as others had suggested and they were unable to roll into balls. I ended up using the ingredients to make a cheesecake

Amazeballs!!! I followed directions except I used 3 cups of powdered sugar because I couldn't sift it. I also used toffee bits. This was great and it formed into a perfect ball!

This was good, but I wouldn't serve it as an appetizer again.  I'd probably serve it as a dessert.  I took it to a holiday party and only a third of it was eaten.  I think it's just too sweet for most folks.  It's basically a ball of chocolate chip frosting covered in nuts!  Also, I served it with graham crackers and pretzels.  I preferred the pretzels as did most others since there were far fewer of them left.

I made this for a Christmas party and my friends loved it! I served it with square pretzels for a sweet and salty combo, and cinnamon graham crackers. To make it easier, I mixed everything together, put it in the center of plastic wrap, formed it into a ball, and set it in a small bowl in the fridge. After it was chilled and hardened a bit, it was much easier to roll into a ball and into the pecans. I made it as round as possible before I took it out of the plastic wrap. Easy cleanup too!

I made it as written with the exception of a cup of confectioner's sugar and 3 TBS of brown sugar as suggested by others.  I did not have time to make a ball but left it as a dip.  It was loved by all and a huge hit at my impromptu gathering.  I don't think I will ever make it as a ball no need IMHO.
Thanks so much for this recipe.

I add raisins dan mix dried fruits in the mixture, and rolled them with crushed corn flakes before serving. It turns out very unique and not too bad either.

I made this for a Christmas function, and it received mixed reviews. Most people said it was "okay, but too sweet" and only about half of it got eaten, which was probably by me. To say I have a sweet tooth is a drastic understatement, and I have never uttered the phrase "too sweet" in my life. I made this recipe without making any changes, but unfortunately I think I was the only one who liked it.

A few family members liked this sweet cheese ball but I wasn't so impressed. The recipe itself is fine but the taste was just lacking. I put this out a few times using different cookies, sweet type crackers and wafers. It just never won people over. 
Since I had a few who enjoyed it and I had no issues with the application of the recipe I will gave it 3 stars.

This was the BIGGEST HIT at the superbowl party. Everyone hovered around it and it was the only food item that was totally, 100%, plate-scrapingly GONE. Everyone went nuts for it. I made it the day before, and stuck it in the freezer for 1 hour before serving. Yes, it was softer than your average cheese ball but it worked. I topped with Heath crumbles before serving. Served with graham crackers, apple slices and chocolate teddy grahams. The teddy grahams were the group favorite. Will be remaking this!

Make sure to use real butter not margarine or it won't turn out right.  As is with most things cooking.  Also I put mine into press and seal then refrigerate and i can get a perfect ball....well perfect enough :)

I made this for a Christmas party at work. It was great b/c I made it the night before and brought it to work the next day. I served it with chocolate graham crackers, and people said it was so good & suggested fruit for next time! I would rate this a 4, but it was one of the first dishes gone & I had about 8 people ask me for the recipe, so it's a 5. I didn't see how this could form into a ball b/c it stayed soft, so I served it in a nice bowl & topped with crushed Heath toffee bits & mini chocolate chips. I'm glad I didn't waste my time trying to form it into a ball.
***Only changes I made were I added toffee instead of pecans, and I also added a dash of cinnamon & some mini marshmallows to the mix.

Followed the recipe exactly and could not get this to set. I ended up just putting a thin layer of pecans over the top of the rest and using it as a dip. Tasted great and worked just as well as a dip. I think that if left to sit for 24 hours it might have set for me.

Awesome! I make recipe as listed except..... I don't use pecans because many in my family don't like nuts.  I always use lowfat cream cheese and real butter. Also, we prefer the chocolate graham crackers with this. We have used the teddy Graham's with his, they r fun! Also I don't form into a ball. I put it in a pretty bowl place graham crackers around it and its more like a dessert dip. Then we don't have to wait to dig in!

So easy - so yummy!  A great addition to any party - especially football/tailgate parties and Christmas parties.  Transports very easily.  I serve with vanilla wafers or graham crackers - regular or chocolate.  This is always a hit!

I make this every year for my Christmas party and is always a hit! The one change I made is instead of the pecans I use red and green spray food coloring to color sliced almonds and then roll the cheese ball in that. It makes the cheese ball look very festive and colorful! I serve it with chocolate graham crackers. All the crackers are gone by the end of the night!

I have served this the past five years at our annual family Christmas Eve gatherings, as it is requested! The family LOVES IT!! I have rolled in graham cracker crumbs and mini chocolate chips, some of the family has nut allergies. I serve with graham crackers (both original and chocolate) and  teddy grahams.
The best way to form the ball is to leave it in the fridge overnight in a metal bowl! It's much easier to handle the next day.

I have made this a few times.  To prevent any foreseen allergies with the nuts, I grate semi sweet chocolate and roll the ball in that instead and it is quite tasty.  It is so easy and reminds me a of a richer, creamier dirt cake filling.

I opted to melt some of the chocolate chips and blend in before adding the remaining chips.  Of the 3/4 cup total chips, I melted a little better than 1/4 cup of them.  It was an awesome variation!!

I'm expected to bring this to most gatherings and it is always a hit.  Teddy Grahams are great with this and I usually leave off the pecans although it does have to stay cool and can get a bit sticky without the nuts.  The chocolate chip teddy grahams seem to be the favorite.  This is also a fun kids dish.

This was good...easy and quick, but it was very sweet. I would suggest to start out with 1/4 to 1/2 cup confectioners sugar and taste it...add more if you think it needs it :) I couldn't get it to roll into a nice ball, so I put it in a round serving dish and it looked pretty.

I thought I would get everyone's attention serving a dessert cheese ball as an appetizer for a Christmas party.  I did and it was a hit. Everyone compared it to a cannoli. Made it just as printed didn't change a thing.

Holy cow...I haven't even refrigerated it or rolled it in the toffee chips yet and it is AWESOME!!! I just transfererred the mixture to a small bowl to refrigerate overnight & basically licked every drop left in the mixing bowl! It really does taste like chocolate chip cheesecake. I followed others' comments & used a full cup of suger & it is perfect. I think I am going to be very popular at tomorrow's party!

Tried it out for something different and it was perfect. I grated the chocolate instead of using mini chips and then rolled it in the grated chocolate as well. I will be making it again for sure :)

This recipe is delicious just the way it is. While it is a little difficult to roll into a ball, I found that once I wrapped it in plastic, this process was not too difficult.  One small change I made was that the second time the cheese ball goes into the refrigerator, (after it's been shaped) I put it into the freezer instead for about an hour and a half. This helped make the consistency of the ball a bit firmer and easier to roll in the pecans. Definitely give this one a try though, it is phenomenal!!!

This was super easy to make, and it turned out awesome. I lined 6 muffin cups with plastic and spooned the cream cheese mixture in to each one to make them evenly sized (though they could easily be split into 3-4 evenly sized balls for larger gatherings than I was going to). I also made some without nuts for those who have allergies, instead using cocoa powder for the outside. Will use these with some Ritz Brown Sugar crackers that I mistook for regular crackers.

Unbelievable.  I could have just eaten this with a spoon.  Tastes just like a wonderful cannoli filling.  I made it for a party last night and everyone went off of their diet because of this.  I made it as directed except I used probably double the chocolate chips split between adding in and rolling in.  Super quick, easy and delicious.

Delicious, only thing I did was I increased the confectioners' sugar from 3/4 cup to 1 full cup.  Also, I had to refrigerate for 3-4 hours before shaping it into a ball.  It says to refrigerate for 1 hour, but I have made this the night before and left it in the fridge overnight in the plastic wrap and it turns out just fine.  Just keep it in the plastic wrap before placing into the pecans.  You might find it easier to use a paper plate to sort of 'roll/pat' it with pecans before placing it on the real serving dish.  Don't forget the graham crackers!! :-)

Excellent! I served with chocolate teddy grahams and it was a hit at my superbowl party! I shaped it to look like a football. I did leave off the pecans but otherwise followed the recipe! Some of the guys were even putting this on the brownies.

To avoid a mess when making ball -- after ingredients are mixed, scrape the sides of the bowl with spatula and leave cheese mixture in a rounded mound in the bottom of the bowl.  Place bowl in FREEZER for a couple of hours.  When you take it out of freezer, it is very easy to roll in the nuts without having a mess!

Super duper yummy!  I halved the recipe but didn't change anything else except to skip the pecan coating.  I love nuts but too many others don't so it's easier to just leave them out.  I made this up the night before and didn't have any problems with stickiness because it was nice and cold.  Served with regular graham crackers and nilla wafers.

YUM YUM YUM YUM  Made this for Christmas this year, and plan on making it for a super bowl party.  I used all mini chocolate chips to coat the outside. I think for the super bowl party I might try mini m&m's.  I also had to use chocolate teddy grahams and they worked great.  Very good!  Very easy!

This is wonderful!  I added in a little almond extract because everything is better with almond!  I also want to try it with some raspberry, orange, cherry extract etc. Everyone liked it but it does make a lot!

This was absolutely amazing! It tasted like a chocolate chip cheesecake. The only thing that I did different was I left off the pecans (only because I was serving it to picky eaters) and I rolled the cheeseball in crushed graham crakers and then decorated with leftover chocolate chips. I will definitely be making this again!

Once in a while a simple recipe yields spectacular results.  This is an example of that.  Oh my gosh, how delicious is this simple to make cheese ball.  Beware, as it is most certainly addictive.  I did use a whole cup of conf. sugar to make sure it set up.  Dipped cinnamon graham sticks and chocolate graham crackers (which were our favorite.)  This goes in the hand written file of only tried and ture recipes that will passed down to future generations!  Just make it!

I made this for New Years Eve and there was plenty to go around!  Instead of nuts, I rolled it in crushed Heath bars. I did use low fat cream cheese, and managed to roll it into a nice shaped ball... but I do believe it would have been easier with regular cream cheese. I'll definitely make this again!

Perfect as amended by someone else--1 c. powdered sugar, 3 tbsp. brown sugar. I skipped the nuts, doubled the recipe, and let it chill overnight before forming it into three balls for a snowman. I used regular chocolate chips for the eyes, nose, and buttons, and mini chips for the mouth. I also used pretzel sticks for the arms. Licorice would be cute for a scarf. I served this with teddy grahams--cinnamon and chocolate--I don't know how many times I had to write down the recipe! A huge hit!

I think that it is easier to not worry about a "ball" shape.  Do the shape you want  then press the topping(s) of your choice all over the outside.  We like the toffee/small choc. chip mixture the best on the outside.  The absolute favorite "dipper" is the square pretzel so that you can make a "sandwich" with the great dip in the middle.  The 3 and a half year old grandson loved asking for a "sandwich" off the Christmas food table.  I do increase the conf. sugar to 1 cup and the brown sugar to 3 TBS.  If people are not eating this it may be that perhaps you need to "show and tell" to get them interested.  Always remember you can cut the recipe in half and you will not have as much...

We love this cheeseball at our house.  Using my sister's idea, I roll it in miniature chocolate chips instead of nuts--more chocolatey that way!  We also eat it with chocolate graham crackers every time.  As someone said, it tastes like cheesecake on crackers!

This is very very sweet.  Would make an excellent frosting for carrot cake.  Also, for some reason mine never hardened enough to form into a ball.

This tastes amazing, everyone loved this it went fast!!! May be great with oreos instead of chocolate chips too, also maybe rolling it in graham craker crums to act like the cheesecake crust. Another idea is to not put any chocolocate chips in it and instead of rolling it in pecans, pour strawberry sauce over the ball like strawberry cheesecake...yummy, must try these ideas!

Really great, sweet cheese ball!  Just a note for those having trouble getting it to form into a ball.  I always line a small bowl with plastic wrap and put the mixture into the bowl.  Chill a couple of hours and voila!  You can use the plastic wrap to finish the ball and roll into the pecan mixture!  Soooo easy!

Very yummy if you like raw cookie dough. I had problems getting the ball to form at all, even after adding a bunch more powdered sugar, but i will certain make this again atleast to try and form the ball! Thanks for the recipe!

Great change from traditional cheeseball.  I used the chocolate graham cracker as some had recommended and it worked out great!

DELICIOUS. Sinful. Perfect for a holiday party. I agree with those who said it is best accompanied by chocolate graham crackers.

Great recipe.  Everyone always raves and wants the recipe.  Be sure to us real butter, not margarine, the cheese ball will set up better.  I also like to roll mine in the heath brickle and pecans.  yummy!

This was SO easy to make. My first attempt at a cheese ball and it was great! I left the pecans out though and crushed up 6 Oreo cookies and rolled the ball in that instead. WONDERFUL substitute!!

I made exactly as instructed and it wasn't a good experience for me!  It was runny and never formed into a ball. I had to put it in a bowl and serve as a dip with graham cracker sticks. Just so-so as a dip and had most of it leftover.

Excellent recipe!  Nice change of pace.  It's rich but you don't need big servings, just a little bit satisfies that sweet craving. I have rolled mine in Skor bits and nuts just for something different and it was fantastic!

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars for flavor. I must have done something wrong, but I could not form it into a ball. I double the recipe, so I ended up using 2 cups of powdered sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I even stuck it in the freezer overnight but this did not help. I thought it would freeze, but it stayed really soft. I didn't have any nuts, so I mixed graham cracker crumbs with sugar and melted butter and toasted them in a dry pan until lightly brown and crunchy. I tried rolling a ball but it ended up looking like a flat football. No matter what it looked like, it tasted amazing!

What an awesome cheese ball; it's much different from the usual savory ones I serve!!  It was a little sweet for my taste, so next time I will cut back on the powdered sugar.  I served it with graham crackers but I might try it with pretzels instead for a sweet and salty change.

Loved, Loved, Loved this! I made this for a social event since I ran out of time. Recieved rave reviews about how "decadent" it was. I omited the pecans because you never know who is alergic to nuts, and used thin almond sliver cookies, and chocolate gram crackers. Amazingly delicious for the simplicity of the recipe.

I made this for a Halloween party and it was a huge success!  Several people asked for the recipe.  After reading some of the other reviews, the only change I made was to use 1 cup powdered sugar versus 3/4 cup.

This turned out great for a quick desert. I let the cream cheese soften at room temperature, like the other reviewers. I also used real butter the stuff thats bad for you & this made it nicve and firm. Definatly going to make this again!

This was good but I was not blown away. I wish I would have increased the sugar just a bit. I added the pecans to the cheese mixture and then rolled it in the chocolate chips so everyone would know it was a dessert. I served it with animal crackers and teddy grahams which I thought was so cute!! I might make this again, it was very rich and less than half of it was eaten.

I followed suggestions of others, also adding the extra confectioners sugar and T of brown sugar, used a combo of toasted ground pecans and heath bar. Found the plastic wrap helped in shaping the rather soft ball and getting it on the platter w/o as much mess!

I have made this three times and it is so good! It impresses everyone who tastes it. I used chocolate graham crackers to dip with it but make sure everyone knows it's sweet as one of my freinds at the bar was eating it on tortilla chips. The way to roll the cheese into a ball can be made real easy by taking a large sheet of plastic wrap and putting into a salad bowl and then scraping the chocolate chip cheese mixture into it. wrap it carefully and set it into the bowl to firm up for the next hour. The 1/3 less fat Neufatel cheese is softer than philly cream cheese so the ball won't hold it's shape as well but you could always serve it in a plastic tupperware or something.

This was very good and well received.  Per others' reviews I increased the confectioners sugar to 1 cup.  I also used toffee chips instead of nuts on the outside.  Just personal preference.  What worked for me is making the mixture and just putting it in a bowl in the freezer for a few hours.  I then wrapped the mixture in plastic wrap and formed a ball and then placed it back in the freezer to firm up again.  Then I rolled in the toffee chips and refroze until ready to use.  It defrosts very quickly, so no worries about taking it out right before serving.  I served with chocolate teddy grahams and nilla wafers.

This was pretty good.  I added toffee bits to the filling and rolled it in mini chocolate chips and toffee bits.  Like other reviewers, I added extra sugar to thicken it up a bit.  The ball wasn't firm enough to roll in the mini chips and toffee bits at first, so I placed it in a bowl lined with wax paper and tucked it away in the freezer for about 15 minutes.  Then, it was easy to add the topping.  It softened up by the time it was served, but it was a great cnsistency, in my opinion.  Guests were able to scoop it out with a spoon.  I served it with honey bee shaped graham snack crackers, and it made a perfect dip.  I think the nuts would be great, but I chose not to use them due to picky kids and because I was afraid it would be taken for a "regular" cheeseball rather than a dessert.  This is a quick, no-bake recipe that I'll probably make again when I'm short on time.

This was fantastic and rich!!! Took it to a big party and everyone went crazy!!! I doubled it because it was for a lot of people. I had no problems with it setting up. Make sure you are using real butter and regular cream cheese no low fat stuff. I used Nilla Wafers to serve it with. People said it tasted like cheesecake or a canoli. The only thing I would do different the next time is to toast the pecans. I have to give this recipe out to every single lady that was there and there was a lot!!! Also took some in to work and everyone there wants the recipe too!!! Yum!

Don't bother with the ball business...just mix throw the nuts on top and dig in!

Pretty good!  I brought this to a Thanksgiving dinner last year and it was super easy to make.  I reversed the nuts and chocolate chips (I added the nuts into the mix and rolled it in mini choco chips after it was done.)  I served it with graham cracker sticks.  Tastes just like a cheesecake.  I would only recomment to let it sit out for about 45 mins before you try to eat it because it gets really hard and breaks all your crackers!  All in all, the taste was great and super easy to make.

Oh, my...the woman's group I made this for LOVED it.  Had several requests for the recipe.  Did not have the mini chips, but, put regular sized choco chips in my chopper and used those.  Had to let it harden overnight.  Served with thin cappichino cookies & the graham pretzels from Tastefully Simple...yum!

I never had any intention of shaping this into a ball cause I was just making a small amount for myself. I did scale the recipe down but upped the amount of confectioners' sugar and doubled the brown sugar. I put this dip in an airtight container in the fridge overnight and the next day it did have a consistency which could be shaped into a ball if I wanted it that way. This recipe is so delicious though! I think it has just a bit too much butter because it is the first thing I taste but then it leaves my mouth with a wonderful cheesecake flavour in the end. I ate this with fudge covered graham crackers and I kept going back for more! Next time I am going to make the full recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Want to make this even more delicious & sinful? My family make a version of this recipe (minus the butter, brown sugar, & nuts) and pours hot fudge over the top. Just warm an open jar in the microwave for 30 seconds. Irresistible!

I took it to a party and did get one request for the recipe...but I didn't think it was that good. Too me it tasted like chocolate chips in cream cheese. I might make it again for something different at a party, but I'm in no hurry to do so!

I used 1 c of xxx sugar and upped the vanilla to 1/2 t.  I rolled it with a mixture of half toasted pecans and half toffee bits, and used some of the mini chips on the very top.  Next time I would add more of the chips into the ball.  The older crowd of football fans didn't eat very much of it, but when I took it to the teachers' lounge at school, it got rave reviews with MANY requests for the recipe.  Guess you gotta know who you are serving!

This soooooo good. Definetly sweet but not overly sweet. I made this to watch for the superbowl and I'm sure it will get eaten up today just like the other times I have made it. Thanks for the great idea!

Such a hit!  I served this with homemade graham crackers and it was amazing. I also added about 1/2 cup toasted coconut and I used milk chocolate chips with I processed finely.  Very good.

This recipe for company is great, and I will definitely make it again.  It lacked a bit of flavor for my taste (I may add more vanilla next time...) but my guests loved it!  Like others, I left out the nuts and rolled in chocolate chips.  A big hit!

Delicious and addictive. The pecans are a great touch. I toasted mine before I chopped them. It really brings out the flavor.

This was a hit at my holiday party however next time when I make it I probably will halve the recipe, the ball was pretty big!  I followed other people's tips and refrigerated it overnight in a metal bowl, made with real butter and served with chocolate graham crackers.

I brought this over to my family's for Christmas and it was a HUGE hit.  I had no problem shaping into a ball and rolling in the nuts.  It looked exactly like a cheeseball - - my sister-in-law was very surprised it was sweet and not cheesy!  Very popular with the kids.  Served it with mini 'nilla wafers and honey graham cracker sticks.

I make this recipe a lot.  It is demanded that I bring it to our Christmas party at work.  It is also a requested item for our family celebration.  I don't roll it in a ball, I usually just put it in a serving dish and sprinkle the nuts on top.  It is always a hit.  I have caught my adult children just eating it with a spoon.  Just delicious

A friend brought this to one of our parties.  It was so addicting, I had to have the recipe!  You need to use real butter if you want this to be hard enough to make a cheese ball.  To make it a spread, as we often do, use margarine.

This was a very easy and unique recipe. I brought it to my office for everyone to share and they quickly dug in. I didn't vary any of the ingrdients. I just covered the ball in more chocolate chips instead of nuts. Yum!

I made this and served it with storebought gingerbreadmen cookies. It was very sweet but tasted good. I served it at a party and there was a lot left. I think because cheese balls are not normally sweet, people didn't know what it was. I liked it and will make it again.

This recipe is magnificent! I took to work and everyone loved it! Definitely added extra chocolate chips and I used milk chocolate chips rather than semisweet. I increased the confectioner's sugar to 1 cup but think it would have been good with less as well. 

Also, the mix will be very sticky when forming into a ball and rolling in the nuts so coating your hands with confectioners sugar or even a little cooking spray may help keep the mix from sticking to your hands. Make sure to let it chill long enough after you form it into the ball, I actually just did it in the bowl I mixed it in, chilled overnight then rolled in the nuts the next morning.

FIVE STARS!  I have been making this Chocolate Chip Cheese Ball for 6 1/2 years and have taken it to guild several times and today I took it to our family reunion.  As usual, someone had to ask for the recipe.  It is uncommon and delicious and I am never disappointed.

This goes over great at parties - its something different - not the usually salty type stuff!!  I would not suggest using fat free or reduced fat cream cheese for substitute - it completely changes the flavor...
For anyone that has trouble rolling it into a ball - place plastic wrap on your counter, sprinkle with generous amount of chips & nuts (or your rolling preference), place the ball of cheese in the middle. Gently sprinkle the rest of the chip/nut mixture on the ball. Wrap and put in fridge.  You can re-shape it when it comes out of the fridge!!

Ok... normally I'm really good about reading every review before I make something.... but I thought oh what could we change about a cheese ball... I saw that extra sugar would give it extra girth... so when it was runnier than runny I added and added and added sugar then... 5 minutes before the party started I decided it would just be a dip, it was still really good though. I made it with LOWFAT MARGARINE and LOWFAT CREAM CHEESE... I know now, after reading the rest of the reviews, that is the reason why it was so runny. Next time I won't be so calorie conscious and I'll just make it the right way. Good though!

Very addictive!  I omitted the pecans and didn't roll the mixture into a ball (out of laziness), just served as a dip with chocolate and regular graham crackers.  Some people will think this is too sweet but I can't get enough of it!

fun party appetizer!  I followed the recipe exactly except that I made it with 3T. brown sugar, a full cup of powdered sugar, and a 1/2t. of vanilla as other suggested.  used reduced fat cream cheese.  I mixed the ingredients the night before, refrigerated overnight then shaped and decorated the day of; it held its shape very well.  served with chocolate and honey teddy grahams.  try this!  thanks for the recipe.

This was a HUGE hit at a baby shower!  Based on other reviewer's suggestions, I increased the powdered sugar from 3/4 to 1 cup and decreased the butter from 1 stick to 3/4 stick. I actually quadrupled this recipe and it turned out great!  I omitted the pecans because I was serving to a crowd and didn't know if all liked pecans.  I let sit overnight wrapped in cling wrap and did not coat in anything when I served it.  It didn't need to be coated in anything because all the chips inside made a very pretty presentation.  I served on a platter with chocolate grahams surrounding it.  Definitely will make this a regular "go to" recipe!

My daughter made this to take to an 8th grade graduation party (point is...lots of teens!).  I had a 1/2 jar of Nutella that had hardened, but not expired.  After calling the company for assurance that the product was ok, I warmed it to soften it, and mixed it into this recipe.  We skipped the nuts per another reviewer and rolled the finished, chilled ball in mini chocolate chips.  My daughter says she got lots of recipe requests.  She gives this a 4 without the hazelnut spread, and a 5 with it.  She took a box of graham sticks as the "crackers". (Thanks to the photo submitter for that idea!)  Definitely a keeper recipe!

This was ok but a bit to sweet for a dip.  I think this would be wonderful as a frosting between a few layers of really dense chocolate cake.  If I make it again I would use it as frosting.

This was delicious!  Very rich, although some other reviewers said they thought it tasted like cream cheese frosting - mine was more cheesecake flavored.  I lined a round bowl with plastic wrap and filled with the mixture - after sitting in the fridge overnight it was still soft like cream cheese, but held it's shape nicely.  I omitted nuts and coated with crushed chocolate graham crackers, then decorated with Teddy Grahams as this was to be served at a baby shower.  Served with graham cracker sticks, honey  wheat pretzel rods and more Teddy Grahams - was also yummy with cinnamon sugar pita crisps, although those ended up getting served with Annies' Fruit Salsa.  This recipe is a definite winner!  Thank you!

Have made this recipes several times and it is a big hit.  I leave out the pecans and roll it in mini chocolate chips though because the kids don't like the nuts.  Serve with graham stickers or Scooby snacks.  Used it in a brownie recipe by dropping cheese ball into brownie dough then baking and got rave reviews.  Be careful when you make this because once you start eating it, it is hard to stop ;)!!

This is great for something different.  I will definitely be making it again and again. This was much softer than I expected it to be, but that just made it easier to put onto crackers.  We ate it with graham craker sticks, animal crackers, chocolate ghram crackers, and vanilla wafers.

I made it as a dip, served with chocolate teddy grahams, graham cracker sticks and cinnamon sunchips. We couldn't stop eating it!! The only alteration I made to the recipe is that I used reduced fat cream cheese and mini M&M's.  I am making it again this weekend for a kid's bday party. I am going to use little star-shaped foil cups and spell out the B-day girl's name in mini m&m's, and serve with assorted flavor,kid-friendly teddy grahams:)

This was a big hit when I served it with graham crackers, but it was even better with "Teddy Grahams". They have all kinds of flavors. Oatmeal, Chocolaty Chip, YUM!!!

I make this all the time, except I don't do the ball I just make it as a dip. Everybody who trys it always asks for the recipe. I sometimes add the little caramel balls that you can find in the baking aisle around the holidays and chopped pecans, which makes it a Turtle Cheesecake dip. It's always a hit.  I haven't found anybody who doesn't like it.

This will be a GREAT recipe that people will beg for IF you add some seasoning salt...about 1 tsp. per cheese ball. I've made this for years, but it looks like the seasoning got left out of this recipe. ENJOY!

Wonderful!! I loved this and so did everyone else. Tastes like a chocolate chip cheesecake. I served with graham crackers sticks and rolled the cheese ball in mini chocolate chips. I followed another reviewers advice and left it in the refrigerator over night and it was still a little sticky, but I managed to get it into a ball. Will definetly be making again and again! Thanks for the creative recipe!

I really wanted to love this recipe, as it seems others have, but I feel mixed about it.  Although the taste is what you'd expect (which is good, because Cheesecake is my favorite dessert), the texture and its inability to set was a big, fat minus.  I made mine the night before a potluck lunch, and so it was in the fridge for a good eight hours.  The next morning, it had barely firmed up and was still squishy.  I took it to work and stuck it in the freezer for three hours, and it STILL had that gooey texture.  I had it wrapped in plastic wrap from the night before, hoping it would be easier to roll into a ball that way, but there was no way to even begin to shape it, so I just unwrapped it, plopped it down on a plate (where it began to spread out), and poured my mini chocolate chips over top of it.  My coworkers approved of the taste, and liked the cinnamon graham crackers I served with it, but they said it was more like a dip than a cheese ball, and I agree.  There was also a lot of it left over at the end of the day.  I followed the recipe to the letter, so I don't know how I could have gone wrong.  I probably won't be making this again.

YUMMY.  It was slightly too sweet for me, but that just means that I will stir the pecans into the cream cheese mixture and forget about rolling it into a ball, just put it in a ramekin.  This is a keeper.

I took everything in this recipe except for the nuts and chocolate chips and churned it in my mixer as a frosting for poundcake. I added the chocolate chips at the end and it tasted like the richest chocolate chip ice cream ever. Not a recipe worth regretting.

Delicious!  I couldn't find the graham sticks the first time I made this (last weekend was about the sixth time) and followed the advice of another reviewer and used pretzel sticks, WOWZA, so good, a little salty and sweet.  I haven't had any problems forming it into a ball, I suspect those who have didn't allow it to firm up long enough or else they substituted neufchatel for cream cheese or margerine for butter, NO NO!  You have to use the real stuff (fattening, but tasty).  Make a batch and take it over to a friends house so you wont be tempted to plop it in front of your tv and eat your head off!

This was very good and different!  I made this for my son's first communion party and got lots of compliments on it.  I only made a half recipe, which made a nice size, and had to freeze the mixture after I made it into a ball, but it held up well and looked very pretty.  I rolled it in a combination of pecans and mini chocoloate chips, which looked great.  I liked the pecans because they cut the sweetness of the cheese ball.  Very good!

I made this for a potluck at work and everyone absolutely loved it!  It was the talk of the building!!  Instead of Pecans, I used Toffee and served it with Animal crackers (it enhanced the flavor instead of taking away from it like the graham crackers did).  AWESOME!!

I made this recipe for a Passover dinner. It was served with Matzah crackers instead of graham crackers. It was delicious and a huge hit! I mixed it all in a bowl and covered it. The next morning I took the bowl out of the fridge in to soften up and it was easy to form in balls wrapped in saran wrap in just 15 min. I will def. make this again!

This was divine!!!  I did not use the brown sugar at all because I read below that it gave a grainy texture and I used 2/3 C powdered sugar just to cut back on the sweetness a tad.  Heaven, heaven, heaven.  I really does taste like chocolate chip cheesecake!

This was the hit of my  Christmas cooking this year. I made two cheeseballs, one was roll in pecans, the other in crushed up Oreo cookies I had left from another recipe. Then I served them with chocolate grahams, it really does taste like a cheesecake. Will defintely make again!

this was awesome!  i'm not big on nuts so next time i would maybe put chocolate shavings to decorate.  i used margarine instead of butter so the consistency wasn't as firm but it was still okay.  i was looking for something to use with vanilla wafers and this was it!

This is so easy to make!  Every time I make this it gets rave reviews.  It's a nice change from the traditional cheese ball.  Very refreshing, and lite.

What an unexpected hit!  I followed the advice of others and used 1 cup powdered sugar, 3T brown sugar, and 1/2t vanilla.  I tried using the suggestion of 1 cup chocolate chips but found it to be too many, so the next time I went back to the original ¾ cups.  It was perfect!  I tried serving it with vanilla wafers and both regular and chocolate graham sticks.  The favorite by far were the chocolate graham sticks.  This was easy to make ahead and fun to swerve.  Thanks for the recipe!

This dip is so delicious-my kids can not get enough of it. It is so simple to make and a great recipe to let the kids help out with. We make this for all of our holiday get togethers. The only thing that I do differently is add more powdered sugar to give it a thicker consistancy....otherwise it's perfectly yummy!!!

This is fabulous! I'd give it 20 stars if I could. After making this a couple to rave reviews I did make one slight addition and I loved it even more. I added the crushed heath bars (chocolate covered english toffee) to the chocolate chips you roll it in at the end yummmmmm! Everyone asks for this recipe. It's different and its wonderful. Thank you so much!

This is SO. DARN. GOOD.  Due to an allergy, I make it with chocolate chips on the outside instead of nuts.  Also mixed some butterscotch chips in last time, which was pretty good as well.  I use margarine and low-fat cream cheese, and serve it as a dip.  I've doubled this recipe at least a dozen times for different gatherings and it always disappears.

This was a huge hit with the ladies at my bible study.  I substituted raspberry flavoring instead of the vanilla and it was just right!  Served with chocolate teddy grahams.

I used light cream cheese and light butter so it didn't set up very hard.  But the low far version still went over very well.  I just kind of shaped it into a circle and served it with vanilla wafers, graham crackers and chocolate wafer cookies.  Tasted great!

Thanks so much for this recipe...I bought a powdered mix that I had to add to cream cheese and roll in chocolated chips before which my son, who hates cream cheese went bonkers for...I have been trying to find a recipe to duplicated it for over 2 years now...this is almost identical...my son is so happy I have this now...he loves it with cinnamon graham crackers and teddy grahams..Thanks again.

WOW...this is delicious!!  I made it for a family gathering...everyone loved it ( especially the kids).  I did have a little trouble getting it to harden.  Put it in the frig for a few hours before rolling in the pecans...it was still a little soft, but worked just fine (the softness makes it easier to dip crackers into).  We used graham crackers and - as someone else suggested - pretzels...yum!!

My mother-in-law introduced me to this recipe years ago. It is always a crowd pleaser.  My top recommendation is to serve it with cinnamon graham crackers.  It tastes like cheesecake with a graham cracker crust. The cinnamon just adds a little something extra

I made this on Wednesday night for Thanksgiving yesterday.  The cheese ball turned out nicely.  It was pretty, but it I didn't care for the taste and I love sweet stuff and chocolate.  It was more of a cream cheese taste than a sweet taste.  I feel like it was missing something, but I can't put my finger on what.  My guests ate it, but I don't know if they liked it or they just ate it because it was dessert.  Maybe it would be better if crushed oreos or something were added.  Just an idea.  Thanks for the recipe.

Poor me!  Couldn't get this thing into a ball, but that was because I made it late at night and then once warmed back up couldn't get it right.  I do plan on making this again, people really enjoyed it.  I ended up mixing the pecans in and it was yummy on chocolate graham crackers.

I made 2 of these for a potluck where they disappeared quickly and received raves.  One was made as written and to the other I mixed in 2 Tbs of cocoa then rolled in toffee chips.  I had no problem forming this into a ball and suspect that those who have used margarine rather than butter as called for in the recipe. Served with graham sticks and vanilla wafers.

Loved this recipe!  Such a nice change from the standard appetizers.  The stick grahm crackers go great with it...try the chocolate and cinnammon for a switch.

This was a huge hit at my family function last year. Getting together again this weekend and my niece requested it. Thanks a bunch. PS who cares if it doesnt come out in a ball - throw it in a bowl like a dip - just as good!

This is great! I also found it to be more of a "dip" consistency, rather than a cheeseball, but that worked out great - I just stirred in the chips and nuts. I've served it with graham sticks, pretzels, and fruit. Another great idea for this dip is to make fruit pizza with it. Spread a tube of refrigerated sugar cookie dough onto a round pizza pan and bake according to the package directions. Once cooled, spread this dip over it, leaving a "crust" around the outside. Then layer sliced fresh strawberries on top. (To prep the strawberries, slice, then add a few tablespoons of sugar. Mix it up and let stand at room temp for about 20 minutes.) Fabulous!

Yum, Yum, Yum!  I made it just as a dip (instead of letting it chill and rolling it into a ball).  It was creamy and wonderful.  I served it with both chocolate and honey graham cracker sticks and everyone loved it. I had to give out the recipe to many co-workers.

Wow!  This was really really good.  I made it without the nuts and just rolled in more mini choc chips.  Combined with the graham sticks it tastes like little tiny cheesecake bites...only it was so much easier to make and PERFECT for parties.  If you want something different for a get together you gotta try this.

This is always a great hit, whenever I make it.  People always ask for the recipe!!  I never have trouble with it keeping shape, and use wax paper when forming the ball.  I use the mini chips to roll on the outside because I don't like nuts.  For dippers I have used both regular and chocolate graham sticks. This is one I will keep for sure!

GREAT!! I made this a bit different than the last time, i wanted some variety! I didnt use as much powdered sugar and added a bit more brown sugar, skipped the pecans and choc chips but covered the ball in cherry pie filling! YUMMY YUMMY:)

This recipe was wonderful!!!  I read the reviews before I made this dish.  I let the butter and cream cheese soften at room tempature.  *Real Butter made a difference also!  I added the confectioners sugar little by little.  It immediately held the shape of a cheesball.  I chilled it overnight and took it to work for food day.  The women went crazy!  It is truly a delightful dish and highly reccomend this recipe! 
Thanks for sharing!

Very good. This recipe is the same as the one submitted by Quick Cooking, so I'll review 'em both. Be careful when shaping, even after chilling it's very soft. I omitted the pecans and just sprinkled it with red and green sugar crystals. This tastes just like chocolate chip cheesecake, only creamier.

Tasted good, BUT the cheese ball would not keep it's form.  I used chips to cover the ball, maybe nuts would have helped keep the form.  May use recipe again, but not put in the form of a cheese ball.

This was such a hit at my company party!  I made it as a dip because I was not able to roll it - it was too runny.  However, I used reduced fat cream cheese, and I am not sure if that did it.  Just put it in a bowl with the pecans on top and serve.  It is SO GOOD!

This recipe is very tasty and not too hard to make.  I made it for a bunch of teenagers and they prefer cheese dip and chips.  But it would be a great thing to make for a party, church gathering or whatever.

This is an absolutely delicious cheeseball!! Everyone who sampled it loved it.  I agree with some of the previous reviews concerning the consistancy. It was not even remotely thick enough to shape into a cheese ball right away. I froze it over night  in a bowl. The next day I wrapped it in pecans and put it into the fridge to let it thaw. Then I kind of molded it into a better shape. I did use 1/3 fat cream cheese and light butter so this could have been the reason, but I didn't soften either of them in the microwave. I tried adding another 1/4 C of confectioners sugar to help thicken it. Although it helped some, it wasn't enough.  I also added a dash of cinnamon.  Minus the consistancy problem, this is a great cheeseball that I highly recommend!!

Nice recipe, but DON'T MELT THE BUTTER!  Let it
come to room temperature before using, and the ball will hold together nicely.  This is unusual,
and like many others, I served it with graham
crackers and chocolate cookie wafers.

This recipe is wonderful.  Everyone I served it to went nuts over it!  I served it in a fancy  dish with a little christmas themed spreader. (I didn't roll any of my cheese balls this year.  Ran out of time. Worked out just as well.)  I served with chocolate graham crackers.  I also put some in small containers to give as gifts.  I gave each person a package of graham crackers to get them started.  Thank you very much for this different dessert.  Everyone has cookies ... this was a nice change!!

Easy to make, But as far as Taste Goes ? Average "At Best" ?.  I thought it was going to be Much Better than it was, Especially because of all the Previous Positive feedback...But I was dissapointed ? It actually tasted somewhat similar to the filling I use in My Pumkin Roll's aroung the Halloween season...And it is Not something I would want to eat Alot of..?..
 "Way Too Rich!!! "

People from my party are raving about this recipe.  I have had people begging for the recipe.  I served it with chocolate graham crakers.  The ball never firmed up very hard, I even put it in the freezer for two days.  But the taste was heavenly. This was a hit and I will include next year at my party.

I made this for a Christmas party and it went over very well. Like some of the other reveiws it was to soft to form a ball so I served it in a bowl with chocolate teddy grams. Will make again.

We were absolutely divided on this one.  I made it for the Super Bowl and my family thought it was absolutely no big deal and our friends wouldn't stop eating it.  They ate the whole stinkin' cheeseball.  Obviously they loved it.

I thought this recipe was very good, although there was leftovers from my party but probably because there were so many other desserts.  This was nice.

too much butter. all I taste is butter. it's not bad, but I can't figure out what to eat it on because it's not as sweet as cheesecake but it's sweeter than a cheese wheel

I used double the vanilla, otherwise no changes. It's delicious.  Kudos to the one who thought up  this one. I did use a food processor to make this and pulsed when I added the chocolate chips.  I had Hershey Special Dark. Chips and with the pecan coating it will be sublime.

I've made this several times according to the recipe and loved it.  Our personal preference is to decrease the powdered sugar by 1/2 cup and add 1 additional tbsp of brown sugar.  Either way it's always a hit!

Froze at both stages to speed up.  Did about 1/2 cup chocolate chips and 1/4 cup toffee.  Could do more toffee. Used less than 1/2 cup softened butter because it’s what I had softened, probably a quarter).  Must used naturally softened cream cheese and butter.   No shortcuts.  Dyed with 2 drop orange food coloring.   1 cup sugar.  Served with graham crackers on pumpkin plate at Halloween party.  Big hit.

Took this to my ladies' club meeting.   It was devoured with gusto!  They took the last of it off the counter and set it on the  table so they could better scrape the plate.    My changes were:  About twice as much vanilla, a drop or two of almond extract in the first mixing step.   I used sliced almonds instead of pecans because I couldn't find my pecans.    I served it with sugar cookies instead of the graham crackers.  

Four stars because it was not as received as well at my mother's  birthday party .  It is very sweet, too sweet for me.

I made this for my book club and heard raves all night.  My only modifications were 1) as I didn't have miniature chips I put the reg sized chips into a processor to grind some of them and 2) adding more chocolate using some chopped dark chocolate to probably come to a total of 1 cup.   Put the cheese mixture onto a sheet of plastic wrap and fold the plastic over.  When sealed, pat it into a ball.   I chilled it for about 4-5 hours, and it firmed up nicely.  Not sure it used as much as 3/4 cup pecans but put a good amount in a small bowl and patted the cheese ball into  the nuts.    I used  Belvita chocolate breakfast wafers as I couldn't find regular chocolate wafers.

This is a really great recipe, I love cheesecake and this reminds me of one. It's really sweet, I made it as it says, but I added a little more powdered sugar too. I'm not a fan of nuts of any kind, so I covered it with Heath toffee bits. My daughter found chocolate Graham crackers, which worked really well to compliment the taste, I think the thin chocolate wafers from the baking section would be good too.

This mixture wasn’t sweet enough for my taste so I added a little bit of regular sugar to knock out the tang of the cream cheese. Delicious! It was a huge hit at my party. I served it with pretzels and cream cheese.

I made this for my Book Club and they loved it.  Since we were reading a book about South Africa, I served it with animal graham crackers.  Several people asked for the recipe.  It did make quite a large amount, so I had leftovers, which my husband and I HAD to eat!  I did follow the recipe pretty closely, with excellent results.

I love cheesecake, so I was so excited to try this recipe.  It was easy to make and it tasted just like cheesecake.  I liked using chocolate Teddy  Grahams to dip in it.  It was a perfect dessert to make for my niece's graduation open house, as she is having a  dessert bar...a cheesecake that looks like a cheese ball.  Perfect!

I made this for a Bunko night gathering. All who tried it liked it. Then, the kids came back from the movies, asked if they could have some, whipped out bagels and made Chocolate Chip Cream Cheese bagels!  We’ve decided to make the recipe but put the ‘ball’ in Tupperware for the kids to have for bagel breakfasts.

Oh my this was good. I hadn't made a cheese ball before and was disappointed I couldn't get this to actually form a ball, but it was still tasty served in a bowl and taking out pieces to serve on chocolate wafers. I will try on tiny teddys too since I have leftovers and some teddys in the cupboard. I did find it a little sweet, but that helps me only eat a small portion and not devour it all at once. Certainly wouldn't up the sugar any more than is in the recipe. Will make again for sure :)

So yummy!  I followed directions as written.  After chilling for two hours, I dumped it onto saran wrap and molded it into a ball after wrapping it.  This prevents your fingers from sticking to the cheese ball.  After chilling for another hour, I placed and pressed the chopped pecans onto the ball.  It was too awkward to roll it.  There were no pecans on the bottom of the cheese ball but that did not affect the taste or popularity of this crowd-pleaser.  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.

I  thought this was a very nice recipe for a pot luck although a bit too runny.  Unfortunately, I forgot to take the advice provided by other reviewers to increase the amount of icing sugar to one cup.  I think that would have helped.  I would make it again however.

I followed the recipe except for presentation (no ball).  I served it with the cinnamon Triscuits (NO) and graham crackers.  For a group I would use a variety of flavored graham crackers and vanilla wafers.  It is like eating frosting.  I have frozen the leftovers for another time.  Since cream cheese freezes well, I figured this would free also.

Very easy to make.  I used a cup of the confectioners' sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla.  It made a lot so I divided it in half and made two.  They were delicious and I would definitely make it again.

It came out bigger than needed.  I bought some Nilla cookies and made sandwich cookies with the left over cheese ball.  Everyone said they really liked it.  Could have been more flavorful but that was probably my doing as a newbee.  I also did not get miniature chocolate chips and the regular size chips were hard to chew.  All in all I liked the recipe and will make it again!  Thanks for entertaining my sweet tooth!

Very easy and delicious recipe!  It is a bit rich. I almost doubled the recipe but, I'm glad I didn't since as written it made a fairly large ball. Took it to a Super bowl party and everyone love it.

Very good.  You can increase sugar or decrease butter as needed for consistency.   Then add mix-ins.  Big hit with kids.

I've been making this for years and it is always a hit!  It is incredible spread on chocolate graham crackers.  If you are dealing with nut allergies just serve it as a spread and don't cover it with pecans!

My grandson doesn't like the ingredients in most cheese balls so I was looking for one he will like. I found it. This variation of a cheese ball is addictive to be some what sweet. I used the tiny chocolate chips and because he is allergic to nuts just rolled the outside in the tiny chips. I also have to admit the adults liked it as well. Try it.

This was excellent! I had no trouble shaping it into a ball, by just using a large wooden spoon. Also, we preferred to use pretzel sticks to scoop it up with, 2 pretzel sticks being optimal.

Only substitute was adding chocolate cups to to outside instead of nuts. Was incredible. Although I used full fat cream cheese and followed the exact recipe, it never would form into a ball for me. No worries! Put it in a bowl, served with chocolate grahams and it was delicious!

Will definitely make again. Instead of rolling into a ball, I simply put into a cute bowl to chill.   I was taking to a New Years Eve party and didn't know about possible nut allergies so I just sprinkled mini chocolate chips on top and omitted the nuts.  Very yummy and people asked if I made it from some sort of purchased kit - nope!  Simply and easy recipe from allrecipes.com

I didn't roll the cheese ball in pecans (I was too lazy to chop them). But the ball was just as attractive and delicious without the nuts. And VERY popular with my guests! Loved it and will make it again for my next gathering!

i liked this because i love cream cheese.  if you are having trouble forming it into a ball, serve it as a spread.  works just fine that way.  i wouldn't use anything light.  i liked the chips but preferred it made with crushed heath bars.  would not hesitate using milk chocolate chips at all.  served mine with chocolate grahams and mini pretzels.

My granddaughter is very allergic to nuts.  Any suggestions for rolling it in something else. When she is with us I made it and put in dip bowl without making it into a ball.  Help.

I have been making this chocolate chip cheese ball for years now.  It is an awesome appetizer.  We serve it with ScoobyDoo crackers.  In fact, I have to make 3 X the recipe.  Good stuff.

Oh my word this is so yummy!!! I use plastic wrap to form it into a ball. I don't want to add any extra sugar because I like to taste as it is. I found forming it in the cling wrap helped it take shape without sticking too much. I've tried coating this with nuts, toffee bits, graham crumbs and mini chocolate chips - all delicious! Once it's mostly coated it's easy to adjust the shape into a more perfect ball.

This was fun and simple to make. I rolled the ball in walnuts instead of pecans but it was still a big success at my family's Christmas get-together. Chocolate wafers go really well with this but so do pretzels. ;)

This is amazing! I made it as a dip and served in a bowl. I omitted the pecans as hubby is allergic. This is also great served with pretzel thins as you get the salty and sweet tastes. Will definitely make this again and again!

This is excellent! I would recommend a double batch if making for a group. Based on the comments, I used 1 cup of powdered sugar, 3 Tbsp. brown sugar, and 1/2 tsp. vanilla. Since I am making this for a group, I left out the nuts. Next time I would like to try it rolled in crushed pecans!

Amazingly easy to prepare and Everyone wants the recipe! I love the look on their faces when they  first see Graham crackers and the pecan covered cheese ball.
 TIP!!  Where it tells you to refrigerate for 1 hour? Refrigerate for 3 hours. Makes ball firm and easier to work with. :)
ENJOY!

This is dreamy. I took this to a party and everyone there, men and women asked for the recipe. Make it and they will eat it. I have used sharp cheddar, gouda, and other cheeses also. I melt my chips then swirl them into the cheese. I like the texture better and never have any to bring home after a party.

I have made it different times now with different things on outside and so tasty and so simple. I serve it with Nilla Wafers or Graham crackers. It is always a hit. Not sure what went wrong with the person who gave it a onecstar unless they did not use good cream cheese or not real butter, never had an issue

I've made this quite a few times and it's always a hit! If you are concerned with nut allergies, or just want a twist, buy an Oreo pie crust, crush it, and roll the cheese ball in that. That is my favorite. Also Nilla Wafers are an excellent alternative to graham crackers as are animal crackers. Really the possibilities are limitless!

Great recipe. After reading the reviews and how tricky it might be to make the ball shape, I served as a dip and it turned out great. Because I served it in a serving dish, I put the crushed pecans in a small dish next to the dip. Also to allow folks with nut allergies to be able to eat it. I served it with chocolate and regular grahams, plus some gluten free cookies. This one is a keeper.

WONDERFUL! I was concerned by the comments about it not being able to form a ball but I had no trouble at all. I made sure to use butter and regular cream cheese. I put it in fridge in a metal bowl overnight before forming a ball. I rolled it in crushed oreo cookie wafers. Will make this a lot!

I have made this twice and I followed the recipe exactly the first time.  The second time I made it I left out the nuts. Everyone loves it either way.  There's never any leftovers.  I even caught someone cleaning the platter with their fingers. LOL

So yummy!  I like to halve the recipe, because it is incredibly rich.

I doubled the recipe.  I added blue food coloring for a Frozen Disney party!  I didn't put the pecans on it, but I followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  It was great.  Not sure why so many people modified the sugars.

So easy, and so Yummy!  It does make a nice "sweet" cheese ball and served on graham crackers or with the chocolate coated Deluxe Graham cookies it is most definitely a crowd pleaser.  I gave this recipe 5 stars because it is yummy, the ingredients were items that I had on hand or could find at my neighborhood grocery store, the recipe was straightforward with simple to follow instructions, the results were delicious, and looked almost as good as it tasted. Margarine Will NOT work - Must use Butter.  However, I have used sugar-free sweetener in place of the powdered sugar and the results were okay.  Enjoy!

I used stick butter but its low fat, and I used low fat cream cheese AND I microwaved it a tad to make it room temperature.The first time I made it, it was in liquid form, impossible to form into a ball. The second time I made it, I didn't do any of these things, and I froze it to make sure it was solid enough, it cut the time in half and worked great. Very tasty, I paired with cinnamon graham crackers.

I needed this in a hurry! I started making it at 2pm and needed it at 4pm. I mixed it exactly to the recipe (minus the nuts) and put it in the freezer for 40 minutes. I removed it from the freezer, rolled it into a ball, rolled the ball in crushed graham crackers and mini chocolate chips. Then I plopped it into the center of a plate and let it chill in the fridge until I was ready to leave. (About 40 more minutes) It was just perfect. What a total hit. I served with cinnamon graham crackers.

Amazing taste!  It's a popular dish at work food parties.  I also had a hard time getting into a ball shape, so I just put it in a pretty dish and call it dip.

Loved this !!! If you have a sweet tooth this is sure to fulfill it !  The only modification I made was mixing the pecans and mini chocolate morsels together for the coating.  We served it with graham crackers and wafers, people seemed to enjoy it best on the graham crackers.

This is amazing!!! I made it exactly as is, and I was licking the bowl clean! It tastes like cheesecake. My only complaint was that it was really soft. I was able to shape it into a "pumpkin", but I'm not sure if it will hold until my party starts.. either way though, even if I have to put it in a bowl and serve it like a dip it will still taste awesome.

Made this for a bridal shower...total success!! Received so many compliments and requests for the recipe! I just mixed everything together and served as more of a dip rather than forming it into the ball, then just sprinkled the nuts on top! I could eat this everyday!!! Served with graham crackers, vanilla wafers, chocolate teddy grahams, and cinnamon sugar pita chips! Amazing!!

I didn't bother rolling this into a ball.  I placed it in a chip and dip bowl and sprinkled it with mini chocolate chips and crushed heath bar and left out the nuts.  Yum!  I served it with graham and animal crackers.  It was a hit!

This is a nice change from a standard cheeseball. Like others, I covered mine with the mini chocolate chips so everyone could tell what flavor it was. If you are having problems with it being too sticky roll in some powder sugar.  I like to serve mine with mini chocolate chip cookies or vanilla wafers.

I've made this for a baby shower! It was the biggest hit! I uped the sugars like some reviewers suggested, the only problem I had was it didn't set in that 'e hour' frame. Good thing I made it the night before and just left in the freezer for 6 more hours. I figured if it's hard I let it sit for a while, nope it was perfect to mold into a ball!! I dint use pecans, just crashed chocolate Teddy grahams, served with honey grahams. I had to give this recipe out too! And now I have to make it for every family get together lol!

Followed recipe exactly, then added more confectioners' sugar.  Did not measure, just poured until cheese ball reached consistency needed.  Every time I make this I am asked for the recipe.  Am taking to a family reunion this weekend.

I tried it with chocolate chips on the outside instead of the nuts and it's great! Makes it a little more kid friendly. My kids love it with teddy grahams.

Absolutely wonderful!  I never use the pecans because I prefer it without.  I serve this with graham cracker sticks.  Make extra because it will be gone in no time.

This recipe is great! I had a difficult time forming it into a ball when I tried to double it, and I had to let it chill longer than what the recipe called for. It chilled an extra hour.  By the time it was in a ball shape, we just sprinkled the nuts on it because we were unable to roll it

I have made many many recipes from this site, but I have yet to write a review until now! This cheese ball is unbelievable! I made it for our Super Bowl party and everyone LOVED it. I did use a little extra powdered sugar like others suggested and popped in the freezer instead of fridge. I coated the outside with heath instead of pecans. It was easy to shape into a football and I served with chocolate teddy grahams and honey wheat pretzels-although just a spoon would have been perfect. Absolutely AMAZING-I could have eaten the entire thing myself!

This is delicious!  The only thing I changed was that I coated it with chocolate chips instead of nuts.  I didn't make it far enough in advance to harden, but it was still good.  I liked it better the next day after it had a chance to harden in the refrigerator.

I made this for Christmas and personally, I thought it was a bit too sweet, but everyone else seemed to like it.  I had a bit of a poblem getting it to hold its shape when I first rolled it up, so after it wsas done refrigerating it didn't look as pretty as I had hoped, but still presentable.  I served with graham crackers.  All in all, I was glad everyone liked it--my cousin even asked to take what was left home! I'll probably make it again since it was such a hit.

I loved the idea of a dessert cheese ball. And it was delicious.  I served it with graham crackers.  The only change I would make next time is to use a bit less sugar. Left as is it was VERY sweet.

This recipe is GRRRREAT!  Everyone loves it from kids to adults.  Don't fret about not forming it into a ball - I mound it into a round'ish shape in a bowl or a nice plate and sprinkle toffee bits and/or mini chips on it...it looks just fine not being in a perfect ball shape.  Besides, everyone attacks it so who cares!  Enjoy!

This is sooo good!  I made it for a party we had at our house, and my guests literally crowded around the cheese ball and devoured it in a matter of minutes!  I followed the recipe exactly as written, except I omitted the nuts and just rolled the cheese ball in more mini choc. chips.  Served it with chocolate and honey graham crackers, and it was DELICIOUS!  Great recipe, and one that I will definitely make again!

I left the cheese and butter out to get at room temperature like suggested and had no problems with it at all.  I also rolled it in the skor bits.  All at our christmas party loved it, both men and women alike.  But I still think it is a "women's" dish.

ABSOLUTELY DELISH! Of course, when something is this fattening, it's bound to be good, right?    As other reviewers suggested, I rolled mine in heath crumbles, but I also mixed in the nuts with it.  Very pretty and very good.  Also, it is much better with the chocolate grahams.

I took this to a NY Eve party and it was definitely a hit! I doubled the recipe to make a large ball, which was perfect. I used margarine instead of butter and it held up quite well. I put it in the freezer for a bit before making into a ball, and I think that helped. This was a delicious dessert appetizer!

This was delicious!  I am not a fan of pecans, so I rolled it in crushed Oreo cookies and it was great.  The ball is not overly sweet, so the Oreos added a nice touch of sweetness.  I will make this again for sure.  I refrigerated it in a metal mixing bowl and had no issues rolling it.

This cheese"ball" was a huge disappointment since I wanted it to look like the picture.  I should have followed the photographer's directions/review.  I made it the night before, then mixed it into a ball in the morning.  It wouldn't really set up, and since I made a cheeseball at the same time it looked ridiculous next to the well-formed cheeseball.  I added 1 Cup of powdered sugar but it didn't seem like enough.  A couple hours later I added some cocoa and a little more sugar and mixed it up and pretty much gave up forming it into a ball.  By the next morning it was very hard but in a bad shape, and mostly tasted like frosting.  So then it didn't look good or taste good!  I regret spending the money/ingredients on this except for experiment's sake since it was a good learning experience.

Instead of rolling my cheese ball in the nuts and into a ball, I just put the mixture in a serving bowl with the grahams and wafers on the side for dipping. I omitted the nuts due to a family member's allergy. This is definately NOT your ordinary cheese ball.  Very yummy and will be a big hit!

Was very good, but like the rest of the viewers you for sure have to add more powder sugar because it stays runny. But over all the taste was great and it went over really well with the family and friends. Thanks for the great recipe.

Everyone loved this. I didn't mix the mini chips in but rolled the ball in them. I think it made it easier to spread on the vanilla wafers that I used. I spread the chips out on a piece of plastic wrap and then wrapped the ball in the plastic pressing the chips into the ball and the picked the whole thing up a put slid it into a leftover bowl that was about the same size and the cheese ball and put it in the fridge to chill. Then at serving time just picked up the plastic and ball and rolled onto the serving plate. Worked really well!

This is amazing! I made it for a holiday party with Chocolate chips and toffee chips and it was good.    Made it for Christmas eve with my family and put shaved semisweet bakers chocolate in it instead of chocolate chips (sometimes cold chocolate chips gets stuck in my teeth and shaved chocolate doesn't seem to have that problem). And rolled the ball in Crushed pecans. OMG!! It was sensational. My family devoured it on Chocolate graham crackers and there was none left. I will most definitely be making this for all special occasions from now on.

Made this for our small family Christmas dinner and it was a hit.  Followed the recipe exactly and it was very good.  Then ate leftovers with vanilla wafers (instead of graham crackers) and it was equally as good.  This is definitely a keeper and I am looking forward to experimenting with different ingredients.

This tastes fabulous!  Just like a new york cheese cake, but in a ball and you don't have to bake it.  I followed the directions exactly and it doesn't need more sugar if it's supposed to taste like a cheesecake.

This went over well at the party that I brought it to.  The only change I made was to rolls the cheese ball in a mixture of pecans and mini chocolate chips, since I was short on pecans.

FABULOUS! Make extra....you will need it. Once  I pried my sister away from this, and the other guests got their shot at it---INSTANT HIT! I was asked for the recipe numerous times. I love that this cheese ball stands out as unique--both as an appetizer and a dessert. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a delicious treat! They only modification I made was using 3/4 cup of grated milk chocolate instead on the mini chips, which evenly distributed the chocolate in the ball. Even my picky brother devoured it. I will be using this recipe again!

First of all, I must state that I excluded the chopped pecans because my in-laws do not like nuts mixed in with food. So, I covered the ball with powdered sugar. The kids liked the cheese ball but I just thought it was really sweet. Served with chocolate Teddy Grahams.

I love this and so did my husband. I love sweets so this was perfect. I did find it a bit soft and wonder if using a little less butter would be better. I might try that next time I make this, which will be soon.

This was good but it seemed a little too sweet.   However I had already eaten a ton of Christmas cookies!  I didn't have pecans so I just used more of the minature chocolate chips..which may have added to the sweetness :)  I served it with chocolate graham crackers and my favorite of the two, Nilla wafers.  I did have a hard time getting the ball shape however it may have been because the cream cheese and butter were too soft.  I would recommend this for a larger crowd because it may be hard to get thru for only a couple of people because it is so sweet.

I followed this recipe exactly for Christmas Eve family gathering! It was more than awesome, it was amazing! The only tip I used was putting it in the freezer for an hour prior to trying to roll into a ball, I am in South Florida and it is real humid.  Other than that perfect don't change a thing! This was the first thing to go at the party, next time I will double the recipe! Thanks!!

Delicious, you'll want to just eat it out of the bowl like cookie dough. Everyone who likes cream cheese liked these, including the kids. Warning don't let them eat too many, a tummy ache is guaranteed.

I used graham crackers for dippers.  I took it to a party and it was enjoyed. I didn't make any changes other than i was short on time so I popped it in the freezer for a bit.

This is delicious and it was more popular than someone else's homemade cheesecake with chocolate graham cracker crust at our Christmas eve dinner!  I left out the chocolate chips and called it a Cheesecake ball and served it with strawberry halves and quartered chocolate graham crackers.  Everyone's favorite was the cheese spread on strawberries.  Other than leaving out the chips, I followed the recipe exactly and it was a success!

Super easy dessert that everyone loved!!!  I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet and I also added some white chocolate with them.  I also added an extra tablespoon of brown sugar.

Amazing, amazing, amazing!! I brought this to a Christmas party a week ago and was continuously complimented...many asked for the recipe on the spot. Very simple to make and very delicious. After following the chilling directions and when I formed the cheese "ball" I wraped in plastic and put in the freezer(insead of fridge) I found it helped to form the ball form... Thanks Allrecipes for another incredible recipe

The only negative i can see about this cheese ball is the calories it must have!  It definitely is a special occasion treat and hopefully there are no leftovers as I have trouble leaving it alone.

I love this!!!! I used peanut butter instead of butter and it was way too soft to form in to a ball so I lined a bowl with wrap and let set for 2 days in fridge (it wont set hard so best to make a few days in advance if using peanut butter) then fliped over on to my serving plate...I rolled it in chocolate chips and pecans before I refridgerated it. I served with chocolate teddy gramhams...was wonderful.

Tastes yummy! I think it is important to note as other reviews state if it is runny add more sugar. I rolled mine in crushed chocolate graham crackers. This would be good for many occasions,even childrens events.

I have made this for several years. It is soooo good! When I make mine I line a cereal bowl with plastic wrap and scoop the mixture in there. Then wrap it up and chill for several hours. It is so easy to shape into a ball before serving.

I made this one for an office party, it was a huge hit. I agree with increasing the sugar to make it form a good ball. You can also omit the chocolate chips and put mixyure into a graham crust, makes a quick and easy cheese cake! Add raspberries or strawberries, it is delicious!

Tastes awesome for sure but I am sad because I used lowfat butter instead of real butter which makes it NOT want to form into a ball....

This was very good and a huge hit!  I used chocolate dipped graham crackers with it and I think they made a big difference.  I also mixed some of the mini chocolate chips with the nuts for the outside.  Very good and will definitely make it again!

This recipe is absolutely amazing.  I used heaths toffee chips instead of chocolate chips, and it was just as good.  Try this for any guests with a chocolate allergy or for a different taste.

This dip is delicious! I doubled the recipe, omitted the butter, and it turned out great for a girl's night in.  I served it with teddy grahams and nilla wafers...delicious! It never firmed up enough to roll in a ball, but it still looked great in a cute little bowl.

This was easy to make.  I used the freezer to cut my chill time in half as I only had a limited amount of time when I made it.  Excellent addition to a pot-luck!  It added the "sweet" factor for everyone's tastebuds!!

This is really good.  I do agree with adding more of both sugars.  Nice touch to use English Toffee bits rather than the pecans.

I doubled everything it made it for a party...it was a massive hit. I served it with plain & chocolate graham crackers. The only thing I will change next time is to use about 1/3 less chocolate chips.

This was a big hit with friends! I used 1 cup confectioners' sugar. I also let the cream cheese and butter sit out at room temp. for an hour so they weren't too runny. I put the finished cheese ball mixture in the freezer for an hour (to cut down the chill time) and put it in a medium bowl. Then I flipped the mixture out and sprinkled pecans on top (will try toffee next time) and it was easier to eat than a "ball". served with chocolate grahams, a serving knife to spread and told people it was a "cheese cake cheese ball" which made people curious to try- who doesnt like cheese cake??

This is always a hit!  I make it exactly the way the recipe is written except I do not use the pecans.  At first people will look at the ball and try to figure out what it is.  Once they taste it, it is usually demolished before the end of the night!

I have made this twice and each time it has been a big hit! I made the first one for a bridal shower and I used 2 C of the powdered sugar per some reviews. I put chopped milk chocolate inside and toasted pecans and heath toffee bits on the outside. The second one I made for a work pot-luck and I put in chopped white chocolate inside and heath toffee and shaved milk chocolate on the outside. I served both with honey pretzel sticks, cinnamon graham cracker sticks, and granny smith apples. The hardest part is getting into a ball shape. I froze mine in a metal bowl after mixing for an hour or so. Then I scooped it out of the bowl and though it was sticky, I could get it roughly into a ball. I put the toppings on a plate and immediately rolled the ball into them. Once you get the toppings to stick, then it is much easier to handle and it keeps its shape without sticking to your hands. I wrapped it plastic wrap and put in the freezer overnight. It doesn't get rock hard and softens quickly. The colder it is, the better is retains its' shape.  You will be asked for the recipe, I promise. It is such a simple recipe and it really makes a statement.

This recipe is amazing! Tastes something like chocolate chip cheesecake. The ball was a little difficult to form. I ended up do the best I could shaping it into a ball using a spatula and rolling it onto plastic wrap. I did put it in the freezer for the next hour before rolling in nuts because it seems really soft. After I covered in nuts I put back in the fridge where it chilled for 3-4 hours. This was very good I can't wait for an excuse to make again!

I love this recipe. I freeze to get it nice and firm. Then I usually split into 2 smaller balls since it makes so much and refill when the first runs low. Also, i find the perfect cookie for these are almond thins.  They are a little more pricey, but worth it. Especially, since I can't find the chocolate graham cracker sticks anymore.

Super cheese ball. My son chose this recipe because he loves cheese and chocolate and this seemed to be the perfect blend. It was sooooo easy to make and tasted great. The only recommendation would be to put a little less butter. It still turned out amazing without all of it.

This tastes super rich, super sweet & its good.  The reason I rated it only three stars is because the only time that I would make it would be to serve to others and it does not look appetizing at all because it will not form any sort of a ball and just ends up a big pile of goo & you have to convince all but the most adventurous to even try it!

Everyone really liked this! I thought it might have needed more sugar to counteract the strong cream cheese flavor. Rolling it in heath was awesome though. Served with chocolate teddy grahams and animal crackers.

I love this recipe. I have a huge sweet tooth, so it was right up my ally. I shaped it into two balls instead of one. I took one to church and the other to work. i did have to chop up more pecans to coat them well. Everyone loved it! This recipe is a sweet retreat to the usual salty cheese balls.

Maybe y'all will have better luck than me shaping this into a ball. I softened the cream cheese and butter at room temp and refrigerated the mixture overnight. I had a heck of a time rolling it in the pecans and shaping it into a ball. As for the taste, I liked it but my guests weren't crazy about it (I had a lot left over...even with 17 kids). Maybe more powdered sugar in the mix to firm it up?

I make this for parties all the time and everyone asks for the recipe.  both kids and adults love it.  I serve it with chocolate graham sticks and it is really easy to make.  I have never heard anyone say they don't like it and I have served it to many people.  Definitely one of my most requested recipes.

This recipe was very tasty with graham crackers. However I never got it to a consistency that would form a ball. I ended up serving it in a small bowl due to that. I added more powdered sugar and chilled it over night even. Still no "ball" would form. Good flavor though. Very sweet!

I made this for an Academy Awards party and it was GREAT!  Everyone was asking for the recipe.  I didn't worry about making a ball, I just served it out of a bowl after refrigerating it for about 2 hours.  I topped it with toffee bits instead of nuts and served it with graham cracker sticks.  Everyone was raving about it.

HUGE hit at my house. Everyone loved it. I was worried this would just taste like cream cheese frosting, but found that was not the case at all. Nothing new to say about it that other reviewers haven't mentioned, just wanted to share my satisfaction!

This was really good, but SO rich!  You can't eat much.  I shaped mine into a football for the superbowl and piped icing laces.  It was really cute.

Great recipe. I always roll mine in the mini chocolate chips. Very pretty, and serve with the Honey Maid Morning sticks, cinnamon toast, so no need for butter knife. Always a hit!!

My family has had this recipe for a few years. Given to me by a co-worker. We roll our cheese ball in more chocolate chips, or just leave it plain. If we leave it plain, I put a little chocolate syrup and a little powdered sugar on top. This is always a huge hit. You can even put cinnimon on top/in it, and serve this with cinnimon graham crackers. Many different ways you can mix it up..

I made this recipe for a Thanksgiving potluck at my office.  I made a double recipe.  One recipe serves 32?  Not in my world.  It was gone in minutes.  Everyone loved it.  I appreciate the variations posted by other members.  I chose to cover the cheese ball with toffee bits.

This was a huge hit! Made it for a Christmas party. Alternated mini chocolate chips, red sugar, chocolate chips and green sugar for the outside. It was so pretty! Everyone wanted to know where we bought it from! I didn't use any nuts or put any chocolate chips in the ball itself, only on the outside. Very good!

This was wonderful!  The only tip I can add is that the first time I made this I used margerine instead of butter (I thought I'd save a few cents) and it didn't turn out NEARLY as good as it did with real butter!  Definately make sure to use real butter with this recipe, it makes a big difference in the taste!

I used 2 tsp. of vanilla, 1 cup of confectioner's sugar, walnuts, and Hershey's baking cocoa powder.  I added the cocoa powder and about 1/4 finely chopped walnuts to the inside mixture.  I coated the ball in a mixture of mini chocolate chips, graham cracker crumbs, and finely chopped walnuts (almost powdered).  Received TONS of compliments!  The Hershey's cocoa added a little flavor, but I initially used it to change the color of the inside of the ball into a light chocolate color.

Fabulous!  I am asked to make this ALL the time for work.  The only change I make is sprinkling it with chocolate chips instead of nuts - due to allergies.  We usually use the graham sticks to dip in it.  Most people are wary of a sweet cheese ball, but all it takes is one little bite to be addicted!

I have made this several times for my daughter and her friends, with great results.  I make a few changes.  First, I make it as a dip and put it into a cute bowl.  Then I don't have to worry about it setting up.  I mix the mini-chocolate chips into the cheese mixture and I add about a half teaspoon of lemon juice to cut the sweetness.  Serve with the Disney Princess shape graham crackers and you will make a group of girls very happy!

OMG!  This is amazingly delicious!  I skipped the nuts due to allergies but sprinkled cinnamon on top for some color.  Served with thin Ginger snaps and it disappeared.  Definitely a winner.

This is very good and addictive!  I rolled half with pecans, half with mini chocolate chips.  I prefer the side with chips, although I think even just a few pecans mixed into the cheese ball would be good.  I also liked that when you roll it in chocolate chips, guests know to expect sweet flavor, not a regular cheese ball flavor.  Served with graham crackers.

I made this for my church  and for a work party.  It wasn't very long until the emails and phone calls strated wanting to know the recipe.  Everyone loved it. And it's so simple to make. I put the dip into a deep round bowl and freeze over night.  Then the next morning, I just pop it out and it's already shaped perfectly.  Wonderful recipe.

I made this for a party and everyone raved, most had never had a dessert cheese ball before.  The other reviews really helped.  I grated a chocolate bar into my mix and thenn made 2 seperate smaller balls, one with the pecans, one with out.  Around the pecan one I placed chocolate grams.  Around the non-pecan I placed Ginger Snaps.  My platter was emptied within 1 hour.  And I already have requests for more at Thanksgiving, less than 2 weeks away.

I always get rave reviews with this one, with a couple of changes:  I put only about 1TBSP of butter in, skip the pecans, and blend 1/2 package of Chipits Skor bits into the ball, rolling it in chocolate chips to finish.  Absolutely fantastic.

This is extremely easy and has an excellent presentation.  I agree with the other reviewer who mentioned margarine is not a good sub for butter in this recipe, but it was all I had and I can't have butter anyway.  I decided to use the help of the freezer in this one and chose not to make a ball.  Instead, I mixed it up, then put in a bowl with oiled plastic wrap and placed in the freezer for approximately 1 1/2 hours.  Then I inverted onto a serving plate and pressed the pecans in.  Looked good, except when I took it to the bbq I should have kept it in the fridge prior to serving--melts a little.  Was a hit with homemade graham crackers.  Thanks!

This was so good and I don't have a big sweet tooth! I even used 1 full cup of powdered sugar instead of 3/4C and upped it to a full cup of choc chips in the mixture instead of 3/4C. This time I think I'll mix some choc chips in w/ the nuts to roll the cheese ball in as well.

This wasn't bad.  Brought it to the families for the holidays and it was partially eaten.  I personally think it had too much of a butter taste.  If I make again I will try cutting out some of the butter and see if it's better.

This is a great recipe. I used a recipe similar to this last winter and made 2 and made it a snowman.  I used stick pretzels for his arms and red construction paper around his neck for a scarf I made sure the chips were on the inside or mixed in and used chips for eyes it was a big hit. My husband made him a black hat out a used ribbon holder.  it was really cute

This recipe was good, but came out more like a dip not so much a cheese ball.  I used graham cracker stix for everyone to scoop it with and that worked well.

This was really good, regardless of shaping issues.  I actually doubled the recipe and used the same amount of butter, but it was still quite soft.  I made it the night before, and froze until just before serving.  I think I will experiment with eliminating the butter completely, because I feel that it is simply unnecessary.  Just makes the cheeseball greasy.  And perhaps reduced fat cream cheese could be used if the butter were eliminated....regardless, it's delicious, you can't argue with chocolate and cheese!  YUM.

I substituted graham cracker crumbs for the chopped pecans and served it with graham crackers.

My husband and I thought there were too many chocolate chips -- I would probably reduce to just half a cup or less next time. And I'll probably label it the next time I take it to a potluck; I found my cheeseball next to the chili at the potluck I brought it for!

It tasted excellent and was only half gone when we brought it home, so we ended up finishing it off that night by ourselves. Sinfully delicious! :)

You are going to want to double this!  I took it to a "girls night out", served it with chocolate and cinnamon graham crackers and came home empty handed.  After multiple requests for the recipe, I had to come back and give kudos.

This was a big hit at a party I went to!  I did not have time to make it into a ball and refrigerate so I placed it in a pretty dish and used it as a spread that way. What a great recipe.  Thank you.

This is always what I am requested to bring to work potlucks.  Everyone loves it.  I do not use pecans, as I don't like them.  No one seems to miss them though.  I serve it with graham cracker sticks.

I chilled the mixture over night and it still wasn't thick enough to form a ball, but it tastes great as a thick dip. I gave out several copies of the recipe. This was a potluck favorite.

It tastes wonderful but mine never did harden enough to form a real ball.  We dipped it out of the bowl and used a spoon to get it out.  It was too thin to form into a ball after overnight even.  It did taste great though.

This is soooo delicious.  I don't bother with forming it into a ball though.  I just spread it in a serving dish and top with pecans.  I find its easiest to serve it with hte graham cracker sticks.  Everyone just loves this!

Have made this twice. I roll it in mini chocolate chips rather than the nuts. I would have given this a five because I thought it was really good and creative, but unfortunately I am the only one out of 5 people who liked it. I'm not sure why. Someone did mention that they could taste the butter and it bothered them. Oh well. I will make it someday again for myself.

This was awsome. I used this at our open house at work and everyone was asking for the recipes. The only thing I didn't use was the nuts but it was absolutely yummy!

I brought this to a holiday party (I only covered the ball in chocolate chips) and at first people didn't know what it was, but once they tried it they went crazy. It was great and everyone wanted the recipe.Thanks!

This is awesome!  I have made it many times before, and every time I get many raves!  Everyone is always asking for the recipe.  I made it today for a teaparty, and doubled the recipe.  Unfortunately I only had one stick of butter so I used half butter half stick margarine.  This is the first time that it did not form into a ball.  I was really disappointed because I was going for a nice presentation, but the flavor is still all there even as a dip.  This is definately something I will make again and again.

This was such a different and delicious treat!  It got a bit messy when trying to roll into a ball, next time I will just serve as a dip.  Served with graham cracker sticks, very yummy

I was wary about making this for my THanksgiving guests, but they loved it! I mixed the chopped pecans and mini chips together to coat the balls- which looked lovely. They assumed they were store bought until I told them I made them. I made tons of appetizers- and these went first-and fast! SERVE WITH GRAHAM CRACKERS!!!

It is best served with the graham cracker sticks.

This recipe is a must for my family.  I am asked to bring this to EVERY family gathering.  I made two changes, i do not roll it into a ball but just make it as a dip and I do not use nuts because my daughter is allergic.  If I could give it more stars I would!

Scrumptious served with vanille wafers, graham sticks, lemon cookies, ginger snaps or any other, 'plain' cookie.  I actually divided the end result in two and served it the first day at a wedding shower I hosted and the next day at a pot luck I attended.  Be prepared to share the recipe with others.  Children LOVED this!  I did not roll the ball in chocolate chips or nuts.  I just left it 'plain'.  I didn't miss the extra chips.

Pretty good.  Took it to a party and left with an empty plate, but no one really raved about it, except the kids.  They loved dipping the crackers into the ball.  I would make again.

This is awesome!!  The only thing I did differently was substituted the pecans for Heath toffee pieces, as someone in another review suggested and it was excellent!  Tastes like chocolate chip cheesecake and was so easy and quick to make!

This is a tasty and fun cheese ball. But here's the thing. I made them for a party and decided to roll them into individual size cheese balls (with a toothpick stuck in them), thinking it would be fun and creative.....Nobody really knew what they were, so they didn't get eaten that much. I also think that people had a hard time with the 'sweet' cheese ball idea. Nobody's really used to that. So even though there were graham crackers and nilla cookies right next to them, they seemed kind of confused. I also refrigerated it for a long time before shaping it, and it was really gooey. I think you could cut down on the butter a bit and still be safe, and it won't be so goopey. You know what, I'll bet this might even be good with some coconut, sprinkles (for the kids), or other small 'toppers' like that. Hmmmmm.... I don't know.

Very, very good!  I made the cheese mixture the night before my party, and then just before guests arrived, I first rolled it into a perfect ball, and then rolled in crushed oreos- skipped the pecans.  I had no problems getting the cheese into a ball.  Turned out awesome and received rave reviews from my guests!

This was a huge hit at our potluck at church.  I had several ask for the recipe and I know they've already tried it for various functions.  I thought it was a little sweet and a little difficult to shape (thus the four starts).  However, the compliments from family and friends made it worth the effort.

I took this to a Womens Bible Study and everyone loved it. I added 1 more Tbsp of Brown Sugar and alittle more powdered sugar. I also placed this in a bowl instead of forming it into a ball.
Thanks and God Bless!!!

This got rave reviews from partygoers.  I took it to 2 parties over the holidays, and it was a huge hit. I used regular cream cheese, and had no problems forming it into a ball.  I stuck it in the freezer for a few minutes before balling it up, and rolled it in nuts and mini choc-chips.  Very delicious!!!

This is so addictive! I let the cream cheese mixture sit in the fridge over night and it was super easy to form into a ball the next day. I had this and a real cheesecake in my fridge but this cheese ball is what I kept wanting more of.

Delicious! I took this to a potluck a few weeks ago & am still handing out the recipe! The only change I made was to roll the finished ball in both pecans & mini choc. chips. I served it with plain grahm sticks as well.

I was excited to try this recipe-I am taking it to my sister's bridal shower.  I had trouble trying to get it to form into a ball, I had it in the fridge all night and even put it in the freezer.  I think it might work better with less butter to get it to set up.  Next time I will try it with half the butter and I think it will set up better.  Tastes good, though!

This was a hit with all my guests for christmas!!! Everyone just raved over it. I have made it 2 or 3 times since. The only thing i do differently is that i roll in chocolate chips instead of pecans. We don't like pecans.

I have made this several times and am required to bring it to all neighborhood get-togethers. I find it easier to place it in a small bowl- too hard to get it to shape as a ball. I serve with graham sticks.

This recipe was a big hit!  I doubled it for a party and there were no leftovers!  It's so quick and easy and really a nice change to a dessert dip.  I found most guests, including myself liked the chocolate graham cracker sticks the best.  This is a definite keeper!

I made this for Christmas and it was so good ! The only change was that I couldn't let it chill as long as the recipe calls for (messed up and didn't have the time to). I'm pretty sure that I'm going to make it a tradition. For my Mom and I (who also really loved it) if no one else ! :D

big hit at the party i took this to. the brown sugar gave it a bit of a gritty taste, so i'm going to try dissolving it in ~1T of melted butter next time to smooth it out.

Very Good.  I took it to thanksgiving potluck at the in-laws and it went over very well.  However, i did learn a lesson with this!  Do not use store brand cream cheese-get the good stuff.  It really makes a difference in the consistency of the cheese ball.  Mine was grainy and never creamed properly.  However, the taste was spot on and i will make this again.

This was a huge hit. The kids and adults could not keep their hands off it. I served it with pretzels and graham cracker sticks.  I also froze the mix for about an hour to make it really firm.  It kept its ball shape for a long time.

I brought this to Thanksgiving and everyone loved it, but a few people thought it was too sweet.  I rolled it in crushed Heath pieces and served it with pretzels, which got compliments for the sweet/salty combo.  I would reduce the amount of sugar next time.

This was pretty tasty... I mixed the mini chocolate chips in and topped with heath chips.  But I couldn't get it to form in a ball for the life of me!  So I just put it into a dip bowl and had graham sticks to dip into it and it worked fine.  It's quite addicting but it really just tastes like frosting.  Different than what most people bring to a party for sure!

Oh my yumminess!!!!!  This was SO good, and super easy.  I made this for a party the other night, so I also made one for my husband to munch on while I was gone.  Needless to say it was a HUGE hit at the party!  One woman asked me what kind of cheese I used.  When I said cream cheese, she couldn't believe it....she hates cream cheese  but loves this cheese ball!  When I got home later that night my husband and kids had almost polished off their whole cheese ball!!  This will be a favorite for the holidays too! Thanks for a geat recipe!

This went over pretty well at a family gathering... but it didn't disappear as I'd hoped, and I ended up bringing some leftover home.  I eliminated the nuts for those who wouldn't like them.  I also rolled it in gourmet hot chocolate flakes (like a Williams Sonoma hot chocolate mix) instead of choc chips and got good reaction to that.  Served with chocolate graham cracker sticks.  I wasn't a huge fan of biting into the hard choc chips, so I think I might make it with shaved chocolate next time.  Awesome flavor though!

I make this every year for the holidays. Tastes great and I'm not a big fan of cream cheese. If you need something quick for a party or get together that's cheap to make-- then look no further, this is it!

Love it!  I have been asked to make this every year for our family Christmas gathering, I like to use the holiday chips such as the christmas stocking ones and we use the graham cracker sticks for ease of eating.

I didn't have any pecans or chocolate chips, but I used toffee chips and almond extract in the recipe instead. I'm not much on sweets, but everyone in the office loved it.

I haven't served this to anyone yet, but I really like it. I would definitely make it again, esp for a dessert-type dish when I have company over. 
I doubled the recipe, except that I added less powdered sugar. I think it may have been too sweet if I used all the sugar called for.  This tastes a lot like choco chip cheesecake when you use graham cracker sticks to dip into it. MMM! 
I also didn't bother making it into a ball.  Just put it in a bowl and sprinkled the nuts on top.  Looks and tastes great!

I did use lowfat cream cheese and a little extra powdered sugar. I froze it in a bowl for 2 hours and shaped it into a ball. Using the plastic wrap to hold it, I coated it in crushed chocolate graham crackers crumbs.  The reaction was mixed, but it did get finished that night.  People seemed to like it more with the (thick) pretzel sticks, as opposed to the chocolate graham crackers.  I may make it again.

This was REALLY good, but it seemed really wet and hard to handle to cover with the chocolate chips, but I had to give it 5 stars because the taste was so good and lets face it that's the only thing that really matters.

Fabulous! Even my husband (who HATES cream cheese) loved this! I used pecans on the outside the first time, but found that it was a bigger hit with mini chocolate chips (like the photo) the second time I made it.

YUM! The only change I made was to use less powdered sugar. I only used 1/2 cup instead of the 3/4 cup in the original recipe.  Still plenty sweet and a big hit at my Girls Movie Night!

This is ok, I don't think it lived up to the reviews.  I made it this past weekend for a baby shower and people ate it, but no one raved about it.  I found it to be too sweet and I like sweet things.  I might make it again and cut back on the sugar.

Very good. I used 1/2 the confectioners' sugar and it was plenty sweet. I served this with a variety of graham crackers. One guest ate it with sugar cookies.

Very Good! This will definitely be a keeper. I used Cream cheese with 1/3 less fat and it turned out just fine. I rolled mine in a mix of pecans and some mini chocolate chips. I think it gave it a little more texture. Yum!

This was a HUGE hit! I had to stop myself from eating the whole thing while I was making it! I didn't roll it in the nuts because of preference, but instead I rolled it in the extra chocolate chips. This is going in the recipe box! Thankyou!

I was so anxious to try this since it received so many great reviews.  It however, is probably my fault as to why I wasn't a lover of the cheeseball.  Maybe someone can learn from my mistakes:  1)Yes, even though many have stated not to use low fat, well I still used low fat and yes, I too had difficult forming the ball. 2) I wanted the cheeseball to be very smooth in consistency so I used an electric mixer to beat it. Bad idea.  This too contributed to the non-ball form. 3) Someone recommended increasing the vanilla extract. I over did it.  I added 3 tsp.s.  It is quite overpowering now and has an alcohol taste. I will definitely try this recipe again though.  Next time I will follow the instructions more carefully :)

Ok, I just made it again using the exact ingredients and it came out much better.  In fact Pretzels are delicious dipped in it.  It is that salty & sweet combo.  My husband loved the pretzel sticks with it too.

A hit!  I brought this to a party at my sister in laws house and everyone loved it...so much so that she put it away because she didn't want to spoil their appetites for dinner (she brought it back out with the desserts). It had a bit too much butter for me though.  Tasted like cheesecake! - Will definately use again!

I absolutely love this recipe.  We are having a girls weekend this weekend and it's the first thing everyone demanded that I make! I don't usually worry about rolling it into the ball.  I don't like nuts, but my friends do.  I actually quadruple the recipe usually.  I put half in a bowl with no nuts and half with nuts mixed.  It is sinfully good!  
No cutting corners on this one though, real butter, no low fat cream cheese.  If you're going for it, go for it fully! :D

I've brought this to two parties and have received rave reviews.  I use the recipe to make two cheese balls.  A large one for the party and a small one for the family.  I use neufchatel cheese instead of regular cream cheese and it is great (not runny).  I serve it with graham cracker sticks.  Thanks for the great recipe allrecipes!

Made this for a work pot luck- turned out really well. Doubled the cream and butter (used low fat versions of both) took another reviewer suggestions and made this as a dip rather then a ball. Also used graham cracker sticks--girls at work said it taste like choc chip cheesecake!

This is a great recipe for an easy, sweet treat to put out for a buffet or party.  I prefer to leave out the nuts and graham crackers crumbs, and I serve with chocolate graham crackers sticks.  Very tasty!

Huge hit at a recent party and was gone in a short time, haha!  This is a great way for me to enjoy 'cookie dough' since I can't eat regular cookie dough (gluten allergy).

This was pretty good but didn't go over as well with everyone as I thought it would - could have been the crowd?  I mixed the chocolate chips into the cream cheese mixture.  I rolled the ball in finely chopped pecan and Skor bar toffee bits.  I served with cookies and freshly cut strawberries on the side.

THIS IS DIVINE!!! Soooo very easy to make. (alittle difficult to mold into ball though) whatever shape it winds up looking like, it will still get scarfed up quick. The first time I made it it turned out to be a slop in a bowl covered w/chocolate chips (don't like nuts)-but got devoured quickly.

I found this recipe on here...and made it for a party I hosted last night. EVERYONE LOVED IT!... I recommend it highly...it will be my new signature take along app!

I did like the reviews said...and made sure I used REAL butter. I also allowed it to sit over night before rolling it in the chocolate chips.

You can't go wrong with this one!

This cheese ball is currently sitting in a Tupperware container in my fridge.  It has a good taste, but it wouldn't firm up for me, probably error on my part, but regardless, it'll be trash in a couple days...sorry...

I like so many before me had problems with getting it roll into a ball.  I used butter, not margarine, but I beat the cream cheese and butter together.  Perhaps that was the mistake.  As for taste, it was alright at best.

This is very tasty and easy. I did the nuts and choc chips backwards-put the nuts into the cheese mix and rolled the choc chips on the outside. Very pretty. I did have to chill the cheese mix before putting on the chips so it would hold shape. Kids liked it a lot.

Love this!  Used 1/3 cup regular sugar instead of powdered since I was out.  Tasted great, but did not solidify very well.  Perhaps the powdered sugar would have helped?  Used crushed chocolate bar, peanut butter chips & white chocolate chips in lieu of mini chips & was wonderful.  Everyone wants the recipe.  Thanks!

I made mine into a Cherry Chocolate Chip Cheeseball.  I added finely chopped dried cherries, 1/2 tsp cherry flavoring to it.  It is not very solid, but tastes great.

This had a good taste but mine never formed a ball. I even put it in the freezer and it still didnt get as firm as I would have liked. I ended up not serving it to guests as it didnt look pretty.. maybe it would be better as a dip like others suggested.

This recipe was very easy and delicious.  For those of you that are not chocolate lovers you can omit the chocolate chips.  The recipe recommends to serve with graham crackers.  Shortbread triangle are great too!

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly except I rolled it in remaining chocolate chips since we have a nut allergy in the family.  I took it to a gathering of friends on the 4th of July and not a bit of it was left halfway through the night.  It  was scraped clean!  Definitely a keeper!

Was told to bring something "different" as an appetizer and chose this... and it wasn't long before I watched a good friend dip a chocolate graham cracker into the very last of this fun dip (I think she would have licked the plate if no one had been around!).  Give this a try - you won't be disappointed.

I’m rating it at a 4, only because I had problems shaping the mixture into a ball.  After the two-hour refrigeration period, the mixture was still very moist.  I ended up putting it in the freezer for another 45 minutes, only then could I get it to resemble something like a ball.  However, the taste was fantastic!  All frustrations were soon forgotten as soon as I tasted it!  I served with Chocolate graham crackers.

This is great. Everyone at the party loved it. I served it with cinnamon graham sticks but next time I will use plane graham sticks. **I have made this so many times I pretty much know the recipe by heart! It's SO bad for you but it's SO good! Anyway, I mix the choc. chips right into the cheese mix, it's much easier than rolling it. Also, I move it from the mixing bowl into the bowl that I will serve it in then put it in the fridge (or the freezer depending on how much time I have). I found that trying to roll it into a ball was just too difficult.

This was really delicious. You just can't go wrong with chocolate and cream cheese to begin with. If you follow recipe exactly (i used real butter), you will have no problems forming into a ball that will keep its form. I took it to a family gathering and everyone loved it. SOOO simple and also something different. I mixed the leftover choc chips with the pecans and rolled it in that, which looked really good - and I served with choc graham sticks, cinnamon graham crackers (which were the best to me), and honey graham sticks. A keeper for sure!!

I made as directed and it was great. I like to find new and different snacks to take to a monthly gathering and this one scored big. I have already given recipe out 5 times in less than a week. Will absolutely make again and again.

Tastes great, but couldn't get it to shape into a ball. Let it chill overnight and it still wouldn't. Would love to hear suggestions on why some can't get it to shape into ball and others can.
But, it tastes sooo good!

This is a really good recipe.  I loved it and so did my kids.  My husband liked the cream cheese mixture but really didn't like the chocolate chips in it.  I am going to try to invent a new cheese ball with some kind of crushed candy in it, such as Butterfingers.  Watch for a new post for maybe a 'Butterfinger Cheese Ball'.  Good job Kim!!

This was definitely well received at the party I took this to.  It definitely goes in the "dessert" category - not really a cheesy appetizer though.  It's basically like thick cream cheese frosting with chocolate chips and pecans.  I will defintely make again!

I am not sure about this recipe.  I thought it was good..but I had a party and there it sat. People did try it - No raves about it..(one woman commented that she was expecting cheese - it does look like a cheese ball when you were done...but she did not say "yum" or anything complimentary)  It ended up with a small dent in the side and I had had a large group.  I can only say..that no one came back for seconds that is for sure.  I will not make it again. Perhaps I am not being fair on this..but this was my experience with it.

Delicious!  My husband is allergic to nuts, so I merely rolled the ball in the leftover mini chocolate chips.  I made it for my daughter's 2nd birthday party and everyone loved it.  Thanks!

This recipe was a hit at our Christmas party--not too sweet, and just the right consistency.  It would be nice to have graham crackers shaped like something other than teddy bears and squares to go with it!

I have been making this for a couple of years now, cant believe I havent reviewed it. I usually use lowfat cream cheese and yes it is soft but I dont roll it in pecans, I just put it in a dish and serve it as a dip with graham crackers.

I have been making this for a while now, and every single time I make it people ask for the recipe.  The bonus is that it takes ingredients that you probably have on hand, anyway, so it's easy to whip up any time (which can also be bad if you just make it for yourself, as it's impossible to stop eating once you've started!).  One recommendation I have is that it works out better to serve it with graham cracker sticks (chocolate ones are great) than regular crackers, which tend to crumble.

I took this to the Christmas party at my mother in law's house. I got in trouble becuase no one could stop eating it. It is awesome. I took along some graham cracker "sticks" in chocolate and cinnamon that I found at the local market. I also skipped the pecans and rolled it in mini m & m's. It was a big hit. Thank you for the recipe.

I made this but have no idea what went wrong.  It was runny and there was no way it was gonna go into a ball.  It was more like dip.  Still tasted good.  What went wrong???

This is the one food item I can take anywhere and be asked for the recipe.  I love this dish and so does everyone else.  I have never had a problem with shaping the cheese ball.  I use margarine and real cream cheese as this is not a diet dish anyhow.  Be sure to chill properly though.  I have made this dish many times and always with sucess.

thanks for this easy recipe.I was a bit skeptical because it sounds weird!I made it exactly how the recipe was written(added just a little more brown sugar)I let it sit in a bowl in the fridge overnight,the next morning had no problem forming it into a ball.Ididn't use any nuts,just sprinled with mini choc.chips.I brought this to my sisters going away party and brought home a empty dish.KIds and adults LOVED it!I will make this again.thanks!

We serve this with graham crackers and for pure decadence --- brownies! Either home-made or the store bought one-bite brownies. Will definitely try the Chocolate Teddy Grahams.

Have made this many times and never rolled it in anything. Also, use regular chocolate chips chopped up.

Well, I have yet to serve it, but i just made it up and who can resist licking the spoon! Absolutely wonderful, I followed the advice that said add a little more brown sugar and less confectioners. It's hard to think that i still have to wait 4 days before anyone will get to try it, oh well.

okay, it was a big hit. after the party was over there was just a little over half left (small party) and my older brother, who is notoriuosly picky, actually tried some and asked if he could take some to work! it blew my mind! i then put the rest in the freezer and took it to my mom's a few weeks later, and she loved it too. so i have nothingbad to say about it at all.

Great sucess at the baby shower I gave this weekend.  I could have saved $35 on the cake I bought and just served this dessert only!  I used walnuts instead of pecans, and next time I'll try macadamia nuts.

Terrific cheeseball and great for kids parties. I tried this recipe when it was originally published but cannot find my issue it was in.  Just reprinted it and ready to prepare it again for another party. Thanks!

Great recipe!  Decreased confectioner's sugar to 1/2 cup and increased brown sugar to about 1/2 to 3/4 cups.  Tastes just like chocolate chip cookie dough.

I have made this dessert many times. The only changes I made were that I use regular sized milk chocolate chips that I added according to taste and I have never rolled the ball in anything. I usually serve it in a bowl with just the top molded. 

People eat this stuff up like mad and I have even won a dessert contest with it. It is such an easy way to make a no bake chocolate chip cheese cake type dessert. Yummy :)

Good, but not as good as I had hoped. Sounded much better than it was.

Yummy!  I made mine with 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar and 3 tbsp brown sugar.  I like it sweet.  It is perfect with Graham Cracker Sticks!

Like previous reviewers, mine never reached the point where it could be shaped into a ball - even after putting it in the freezer overnight! It tasted o.k., but wasn't what I had hoped for.

Everyone who tasted this loved it.  It is  different, so it is a surprise when they discover that it is a sweet cheese ball.  My colleagues in a grad class were all asking for the recipe to take home.
