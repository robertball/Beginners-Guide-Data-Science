As usual, I adapted this to the human bread machine--me! I proofed the yeast in the warm water & a teaspoon sugar for about 10 minutes, then added the remaining ingredients, with these adjustments: I didn't have nonfat dry milk so I replaced about 1/4 cup of the water with 1% milk; used 1 T fresh rosemary, minced; I only added 2 cups AP flour, then added in a little more as I kneaded the dough. After kneading about 5 minutes I let rise for about 45 minutes, then shaped into the rolls & let them rise about 45 minutes. I did not brush with anything before they baked but did brush with melted butter when they came out of the oven. These are some of the finest dinner rolls we have ever tried. They are tender with a delicious chewy crust, fragrant, and savory--the perfect bread for the Brown Sugar Meatloaf, also from this site. Excellent and easy recipe going straight into my 5-star recipe file!

This is a great classic recipe but if you want more Rosemary flavor change one thing. Start with fresh Rosemary and heat it in the cup of water until just simmering. Let the water cool back to the proper temp with the rosemary in it. Remove the rosemary and mince it before adding to the other ingredients in the recipe.

I modified the rolls by using a muffin tin instead of a baking sheet. These turn out just as yummy, are easy to keep uniform in size, and when I've got kids helping it makes it more fun for them to roll the dough into a "snake" and put it in the tin!

Yummy! These rolls are sooo good.  My husband came in as I was pulling the rolls out of the oven and said "Wow!"  He then ate 6 of them at dinner!  I served them with a pork roast and mashed potatoes.  An excellent flavor.  You won't be sorry.

These were just OK, nothing bad but nothing special either.  I expected more rosemary flavor.  These were surpisingly bland, although very easy to make and beautiful.  However, my 6-year old loved them.

Absolutely fabulous rolls!  SOOOO easy to make!  My husband and I both just loved these rolls.  I am giving the recipe to all my family & friends!  The texture is perfect, nice & soft, not too tough.  The rosemary adds a nice flavor to them without being too much.  My husband couldn't believe that "I" made them.  I'm not a very good cook so if he was impressed, it must be a good recipe :) These are a nice light addition to any meal.  Definitely 5 stars!!!

Beautiful rolls! Tender and light with wonderful flavor. I used fresh rosemary - 3 teaspoons. This recipe is easily adaptable if you don't have a bread machine. I used my stand mixer, active dry yeast and all purpose flour. Mix the yeast with the water and sugar and let stand until foamy. Pour into mixer bowl along with oil, milk powder and potato flakes. Mix well, then add in salt, rosemary and two cups of flour. Knead until mixture comes together and then add the rest of the flour 1/4 c at a time, stopping when dough clears the bowl and clings to the hook (be patient with it as it seems to take a long time to incorporate the flour with this recipe, perhaps because of the potato flakes). Knead about 5 to 8 minutes more until dough is smooth and elastic. Let rest in a greased bowl, covered, about 45 minutes or until doubled (when a knuckle pressed into dough leaves an indentation). Form and let rolls rise again as directed, then bake. Before baking, I brushed my rolls with melted butter and sprinkled on the kosher salt. Delicious!

I loved the flavor and texture.  Went very well with "Lamb Chops with Balsamic Reduction."

TIP:  Substitute a tablespoon of the water with a tablespoon of lemon juice.  The bread has a subtle tang to it).

TIP:  When rolling them out to 10 inch ropes, first roll each out about 4 or 5 inches.  By the time you finish all 12, the 1st one has relaxed gluten, so roll it out to 10 inches and repeat in the same order.  This makes it much easier to roll out to 10 inches.

I have made these rolls a number of times, and they are always a hit.  I adore rosemary, so these are the perfect rolls for me.  Leftover rolls can be used to make great little ham sandwiches, too.

I did not use a breadmachine and replaced some of the flour and water with homemade sourdough starter, so I had sourdough rosemar rolls.  I also used fresh instead of dry rosemary.  They were so fragrant and flavorful, and the dough was very easy to handle.  They look so cute too.

This an 'old standard' from Fleischmann's Yeast.
It is absolutely wonderful and the all-time favorite roll at my house.

I'm glad these are such a good dinner roll... I just made 6 dozen for a big Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow! Made them just as the recipe is written and very happy with the results. I did these in the KA mixer, used instant yeast (didn't have to wait for it to proof), and let it rise in the bowl for about 35-40 minutes. Scaled for 12 rolls and let those set for about 15 minutes and used the egg wash and kosher salt. Baked 19 minutes and started the next batch. Fun, fun, fun, in the Kitchen! Happy Holidays to everybody!!

I've made these three times now, and have been delighted each time.  I do use fresh rosemary (1 Tablespoon) - and I make 24 instead of 12 rolls.  The original recipe is great - but I like a smaller dinner roll.

These rolls are soooooo good! The texture is perfect and they are simple to make. I added 1 teaspoon of chopped fresh thyme, 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley, 2 finely chopped shallots, as well as 2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary. I didn't have powdered milk so I added the same amount of milk. The rolls came out beautifully! I made them the day before Thanksgiving and had to make them again on Thanksgiving because they had “mysteriously” disappeared overnight! ;-)

One of our favourite roll recipes. They look and taste wonderful. I often use the shaping technique descriped for other dinner roll recipes. I substitute milk for the water/powdered milk and use 1 TBSP of dried rosemary (finely ground with my mortal and pestle).

I was surprised to find these to be unremarkable. The texture is just OK compared to other rolls I've made in the past (rather heavy.) The flavor was bland, which I believe could have been helped by the addition of a bit more salt to the dough. They weren't bad in any way, (let's face it - how bad can fresh home made yeast rolls be?) just OK.

These deserve much more than 5 stars.  They are wonderful!  I did the recipe entirely by hand, only used 2 1/4 cups of bread flour, used 1 T of fresh rosemary chopped into little pieces, and brushed with butter topped with kosher salt before baking.  The rolls were very light and fluffy and are absolutely delish especially dipped in olive oil.  This is definitely a keeper!  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent. I used a little more rosemary than suggested and because of my bread machine I need to add more water. Remember to watch the first part of the dough cycle to ensure the dough forms into a ball, if it is too dry add a little water mixed with olive oil. My bread machine required an additional 2tbs olive oil and 1/2 cup of water.

I didn't have rosemary, so I left it out.  These are delicious and will make them again with the rosemary.  Easy to make and so very pretty.  Did I mention how yummy these are.  Perfect for my Thanksgiving dinner.

I am not a fan of rosemary, so I subber a heaping teaspoon of garlic salt and omitted the salt called for. I have not had much success with making breads before, but this was fun. Even my two year old loved them. I followed GRANNYLOOHOO's suggestions, but used my kitchenaid for the first kneading. Brushed with melted butter and they were delicious! Awesome recipe, will be using again.

I loved these!  Easy and beautiful.  I used fresh rosemary out of my garden, a little more than called for.  I've made them several times for large groups and they are a great hit.

These were just okay.  Perhaps they were a bit heavy because my mother and mother in law took over at the last minute and decided they didn't want to take the time to make the long strips.  They just put globs of the dough on the pan.  So maybe that made the difference?  
I'll try a different roll recipe next time.  And won't allow anybody else in my kitchen when I'm cooking.

I made about 4 dozen of these for our Christmas dinner this year. Tried it out for the first time. I did what someone else suggested and heated the fresh rosemary for more flavor. BOO. Maybe I just like the idea of fresh herbs, and not really the taste, who knows. They turned out fine. The family liked them. They were not, however, FABULOUS beyond belief. So maybe I messed up. I'd try them again, they were certainly pretty on the table!

These are my husbands FAVORITE food in the world.
I made these mostly using GrannyLooHoo's modifications (no bread machine)
I use 2TBS almond milk (unsweet) for the milk, replacing both the powdered milk and the extra 1/8 cup of water.
I also used Garlic Parmesan Baby Red potato flakes, simply because that's what I had the first time I made them, and my topping is Himalayan Pink Salt. They are great, and it's been requested I make them every day. While I won't make them that much, I may be making these on a weekly bases!
I did leave out the salt IN the recipe, only putting a little on top.
Those of you saying this is too dense: Maybe you need less flour? I live in a fairly humid place and almost always have to add flour to recipes, but the 3 cups is perfect for me. So that may be a problem.
I also use a whole packet of regular yeast, which is twice the amount listed (but it's not machine yeast, so I think it translates similarly)

I usually purchase rosemary rolls from a local store with a bakery and I love them. So when I saw this recipe I had to try it. These are even better than the ones from the bakery! I will definitely will make them again!

These are absolutely gorgeous - both in looks and flavor!  The only change I made was to use 2 Tbsp. fresh chopped rosemary.  They came out perfect!  I think I like these better than Jo's Rosemary Bread from this site.  To make the shape of them, I coiled them around my finger, removed my finger, then put the outside end through the hole.  Easy!  I can't wait to make these for company.

It seems like I am the odd one out. The rolls turned out fine, However I did not like the taste at all. Not a lot of flavor in the roll its self. I was hesitant on the salt but used it. I think they might be better with out it. Too me, especially with the salt, they were more like a pretzel from the mall. I did have a couple of other people try them. They didn't care for them either. Sorry.

It's hard to get too excited about rolls usually, but these were delicious.  The texture was perfect and we even used them to tempt an Atkins-dieter!  Ha ha ha ha ha.  We will definitely make these again.

I thought this recipe was really great, I am a good cook, but have never been too successful with homemade rolls, this recipe has changed my mind!  Used a little more rosemary and divided dough into 16 pieces with all of them being really good sized.  My company loved them! Thanks

I love rosemary bread so this was a "must try".  The rolls are wonderful as is, soft inside and crusty outside.  I will make these again and will likely increase the amount of rosemary and probably make other tweaks as I rarely follow the exact directions twice (channeling my mom as usual). Thanks for a great recipe.

I've made this twice recently.  Once with white bread flour and again yesterday with my own milled flour with the bran sifted out.  I weighed the dough into 14 pieces instead of 12 as I wanted smaller dinner buns.  These are so excellent.

I made this recipe for a recent group Christmas dinner and it was a complete hit.  I took the advice given by simmering the rosemary and additionally used the water from the simmer as part of the recipe water.  If your using a bread machine, the 12 servings recipe is a 2 lb loaf and I used white corn meal for dusting the pan.  I'm making this again for Christmas day dinner!

I followed what grannyloohoo did: -Used real milk instead of dry, and cut down on the water -Proofed the yeast in the warm water and sugar  -used butter on top after removing from the oven -I only let them rise once, and used dried rosemary, whole, added to the warm water/yeast. Turned out fabulous! They had great flavor and texture and were awfully cute! I will make these again for sure. Next time, I'll use them as a starter to the meal and add a dish of olive oil for dipping.

YUM!  No breadmaker, so kneaded in Kitchen Aid. First proofed yeast, warm water and sugar together and added the rest.  Batter was dry so I had to add some water and half-and-half. Next time I'll do less flour.

My first ever review but had to do it b/c these are just so amazing: easy to do and delicious. Don't have a bread machine so I just proofed the yeast first in sugar water and then added the remaining ingredients. Only needed about 2C of flour rather than all 3.

Excellent recipe-they turned out wonderfully good.  The flavor of these rolls will depend on the quality of the rosemary that you're using--I think that fresh rosemary would work better for a more robust flavor.

Yes, they aren't kidding. ADD MORE ROSEMARY. I probably added an extra teaspoon or so, and it probably could have used more, or perhaps something else like oregano or garlic or something. But texture wise, I liked these. I didn't fool around with all that fancy coil shaping stuff. I just formed into 6 big rolls in a 9 inch pan. Pretty good.

These rolls are good, but they are nothing special.  They look special if you do the coils--I didn't, but only bc bf wanted salmon cakes so I made them into buns.  I'm a rosemary fan, so there definitely wasn't enough rosemary in them for me.  If you aren't  a huge fan of rosemary, there's only a bit of rosemary taste.  The dough was a bit dry--had to add about a 1/4 cup, but otherwise it was fine.  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe pretty much except I took another gal's idea about the muffin tin and I soaked the fresh rosemary in the warm water first.. They were moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. I brushed them with butter instead of egg whites. Really good!

I made this by hand - the first bread I have ever made - and it turned out really well.  The texture is lovely, soft and spongy.  I omitted the olive oil, and added more rosemary, but I still found that the flavour was a little subtle for me so next time I might add more or follow other reviewers and soak it.  Overall though, very good.  I will be making these again.

WE LOVE THESE ROLLS.  I HAVE MADE THEM A FEW DIFFERENT WAYS NOW.  MY FAVORITE IS SUBSTITUTING THE ROSEMARY FOR GARLIC POWDER.  MY KIDS ALL LOVE THEM..MY VERY PICKY 11 YEAR OLD SAID THESE WERE EVEN BETTER THEN SANIBEL ISLAND'S BUBBLE BREAD (WE WENT TO FLORIDA LAST YEAR JUST FOR THAT).  THANKS SO MUCH FOR A GREAT RECIPE!

I liked these rolls a lot ... I would leave the salt off the top next time, tho' ... my S.O. didn't care for the rosemary ... he said it covered the flavor of the bread itself ... they were beautiful, and rose wonderfully ... he would give them a 3, probably, and I would give them a 5, so I split the difference and gave them a 4.

So delish and SO EASY!  It was actually the first time I used my bread maker, and I was thrilled with the results!  These rolls were PHENOMENAL, and I can't believe they came out of my kitchen!  I will def. be making them again!

Although these looked really pretty, I didn't care for them.  I thought they were a little tough.  Maybe I over-kneaded or something.

My family loved these but they were a little dense and salty for me. Reminded me of a soft pretzel. Which I am not fond of. I prefer my rolls to be flakier and sweeter.

WOW!  These rolls are fantastic!  I made them to go with easter dinner and they were a huge success!  I was expecting them to be dense and was hoping they wouldn't "hit bottom" like a rock in our tummies.  They were light, fluffy and marvelous.  Great Flavor.
