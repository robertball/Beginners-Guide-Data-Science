We did not like this at all. The mustard taste was overpowering and it was too salty.

Lunch is my all time favorite meal of the day because I can make whatever I want without having to worry about anyone else. I love egg salad as much as I do ice cream and I wanted something a little different. I thought this was delicious, however, I omitted the salt and used dijon mustard but less than called for. I kept tasting along the way until I was happy with the flavor.

I made this for our lunch today.  Hubby and I love egg sandwiches, and this was a nice change of pace from our usual style.  I went with the majority and decreased the mustard.  I scaled the servings down to 10 since it was just 2 of us eating this.  I added some oregano and granulated garlic instead of garlic salt.  I didn't have any celery, so I used some celery salt.  My spices were dry..I didn't have the fresh, and it was delicious.  One word of advice...make the full amount..you'll want leftovers for later!! Thanks Jenna.

Reduce the mustard significantly, like maybe 1 teaspoon for four eggs (to start at least), and we've got something here - like a solid 4-star recipe.  The fresh basil and parsley add color and a fresh, herby dimension to an otherwise standard egg salad. But prepared as written (which I didn't do), with this overload of mustard (and hot pepper sauce too, for that matter),  I can't imagine how this would be palatable.

Instead of garlic salt, I used garlic powder. I didn't want this to be too salty. For us, this had WAY too much mayonnaise and mustard and not enough spices. If I cut back a bit on the condiments and doubled the spices, I think it would be a great egg salad. As is, it was too wet for us.

My husband who says you can't mess up egg salad did not care for this too much. He said there was way too much mustard. I agree. I would cut that in half and increase the mayo for consistancy.

This was sooo delicious. We spread it on garlic flavored crostini. I, too, reduced the mustard to 2T, the hot sauce to 1/8t and sub'd garlic powder for the garlic salt. Yummy. Thanks Jenna. This is a keeper.

I hated to be the black sheep (hi guys!) so I had to try this.  I actually made this yesterday, but when I tried it, I was like OH-.  The taste of the pepper sauce was overpowering.  So I stuck it in the fridge and actually forgot about it until today when I was looking for something to eat for lunch.  It was tasty, and the pepper sauce melded so nicely.  I added (yesterday) more parsley, & some chopped green onion and like Josie, used garlic powder, and had no celery so used celery salt, and cut the mustard to 1 tbsp. (even though I love mustard)  YUM!  Thanks for the nice change of pace Jenna!

My 2 year old loved this. I'm not big on Egg Salad and enjoyed this one myself. I used dried basil and parsley and also cut back on the mustard and half the hot pepper (just because I didn't want it to hot for my young one). We had left overs so the next day I added immitation crab meat and it was Wonderful!!  Thanks for the recipe.

My husband hates egg salad and loved this recipe. I think it is exceptional, of course we love mustard. There is a lot of mustard but that's what makes it so different and good.

I have to agree--way too much mustard in this recipe.  After reading the other reviews, I cut mustard by half and still the mustard overpowered the other flavors.

If you call 1 Tbs. a serving this may serve 20.  I cut the recipe in half.  I didn't believe the method of cooking the eggs but thought I would try it--it doesn't work here in Utah.  I put about half as much mustard as the recipe called for and it was too much.  I liked the basil, parsley & celery but will not be making this recipe again.

Looked up recipes to use fresh basil and parsley and found this egg salad. Glad I tried it. Left out hot pepper and decreased mustard by half. Substituted garlic powder for garlic salt.  Will make again. Basil flavor is so good.

I found this recipe today when I was looking for an egg salad recipe that might be a little more flavorful. I didn't have parsley and I used dried basil, but it turned out great. It tasted like a deviled egg in a sandwich. If yellow mustard is not top on your list...I would go with suggestions and lower it just a little. I cut the recipe in half since it was just for me and I have plenty for another couple sandwiches. Thanks for the recipe!

I am not fond of egg salad however my dad is. He is a really picky eater and sticks to what he likes. I changed up his usual egg salad with this recipe. He noticed the change right away and loved it.
 My dad thinks hotter is better so I added some extra hot sauce to give it a kick. I also dropped a bit a lemon juice into the mixture and took out some of the mustard.

I didn't use hot sauce and had to use all dried spices.  Other than being to salty it was delicious.  I'll make this again with less salt and may even try the hot sauce.

I can only give this recipe four stars because it is a very good base recipe, but not the best. I didn't use hot sauce or celery because I ran out of hot sauce and I don't like celery in my egg salad. Plus I didn't measure out my ingrediants, so I can't say if they were proportioned correctly or not. But overall I really enjoyed it, the mustard gave it a kick (I used spicy brown)and the basil and parsley enhanced that flavor. I really liked it but will stick to my normal recipe in the future.

Upon hearing all the "too much mustard" complaints, I started with a TBLS and added a little more to taste. I upped the mayo by just a little and in the place of garlic salt, I used garlic powder. I didn't have fresh herbs so I used 1/4 tsp of dried and added 1 tsp of sugar. Very good! I served this for lunch on croisants with lettuce and was very much enjoyed...except by my daughter. I would make this again for myself!

I made this for a wedding shower, and everyone loved it.  I eliminated the parsley, merely for lack of having it in the house.  I have since then made it for my dad and husband for sandwiches, and the Tabasco sauce makes it a HIT.  Kind of smoky, definitely a superior egg salad among egg salads.

Not a big egg salad fan, but wanted something different for weekend sandwiches.  Turned out OK, but a bit runny... maybe I used too much mayo??  The spices were great.  Used dijon mustard and added diced onions.

very good egg salad. i too used celery salt instead of celery and i used brown mustard instead of yellow and used a little more than half the amount of mustard. i only had dried herbs, but it still was tasty. much better after the flavors have a chance to blend. i always mash the yolks with the wet ingredients and then add the chopped whites, like when making deviled eggs. i just don't like to get a big bite of yolk. thanks for the recipe.

This is a great recipe for egg salad! My only complaint is that it was way too salty for my liking.  The only modifications I made were cutting down on the mayo by half and the mustard as well just because I like my egg salad to taste really egg-y. I'll make this again but with much less salts.

Pretty darn good! I took the advice of other reviews and cut the mustard. I also added horseradish instead of the pepper. A nice change from a plain egg salad sandwich!

Love this recipe!!!  I love egg salad, but if it's bland, YUCK!  This has great flavor and the fresh herbs make a difference!  Thanks, Jenna!

Loved it!  Most egg salad has too much mayo this had so much more flavor with the mustard.  I deleted the onion power and added real onion instead of celery and doubled the hot

I did cut the mustard by about a third and added mayo until I liked the consistency.  The flavors mellowed overnight and this was a very tasty salad (just maybe not for those who aren't keen on mustard).
