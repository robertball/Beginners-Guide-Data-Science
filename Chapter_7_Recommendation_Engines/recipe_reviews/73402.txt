This gets 5 stars not necessarily because of its gourmet flavor, but because of the perfect combination of ease of preparation, cost, flavor, family friendliness, etc. etc. etc. Definitely going to be a "pantry staple" in our house. We used ground turkey, two packs of Ramen (only 1 packet of seasoning), the corn and tomatoes specified, and a few frozen green peas thrown in with the noodles for some color. We also sprinkled cheese on top before serving. The only dishes to clean: our eating bowls and utensils, the one pot and spoon used during prep, and ourselves! Thanks for the recipe--this will trump ordering pizza or Chinese takeout next time we're wanting a break from my normal whole grains/low sodium/high veggie meals :).

For what this dish consists of, it is WAY more delicious than it has any right to be. I was looking for something easy to toss together after a late day at work, and this more than fit the bill! 

The only real change I made was using a can of (Rotel brand) tomatoes with green chilies. It gave it just a little extra kick. I used 2 packages of noodles (with an extra 3/4c water to compensate) and about a packet and a half of seasoning - perfect!

I think the key to getting the noodles to cook properly is remembering to COVER when you simmer. The steam gives them a delicious, chewy, al dente texture.

The only reason I didn't rate this one 5 Stars was the lack of visual appeal. It's not pretty, but don't be fooled - IT'S DELICIOUS! I raved, Boyfriend raved, and we will make this again and again!

I had to laugh when I read the Poor White Trash review lol. I guess I am poor white trash then because my kids love the ramen noodles and they love hamburger! I've made this a few times for them and they seem to gobble it up! I sometimes add other veggies to it, like thinly sliced carrots, broccoli and even zucchini. At our house we call it "Yucky Noodles" and it looks yucky, bu they love it! Viva Poor White Trash recipes!

This is wonderful.  I have made it two times, and my family really gobbles it up.  The first time I made it with beef flavored oriental noodles, and it came out good.  I had seasoned the ground beef while cooking, and it was too seasoned when done.  I used two pkgs of noodles and ended up cooking another bag afterwards to add to the pan.  

The second time, I made it with the oriental flavored noodles, and I did not season the ground beef while cooking.  I used three pkgs oriental noodles crushed.  My husband said it was better.  Therefore, next time, I will not season the ground beef while cooking, and I will use 3 pkgs noodles.  I will use 2 cans diced tomatoes, and 1 can corn. This will be a commonly found dish at my home.

Best described as PWT (Poor White Trash) food.  In this case, mixing substandard ingredients together does not improve their quality.  I think a much better meal would have been to just make hamburger patties and serve the vegetables and prepared soup on the side.

This is a very kid friendly dish.  I used frozen corn (no canned), 1 can of beef broth, and 1 can of stewed tomatoes (run through the chopper) as I had no diced.  I used 2 pkg beef flavored ramen noodles.  The next time I make it I'll use the oriental.  I put a dash of soy sauce and dash of worshestire sauce while cooking.  I served with some shredded monteray jack cheese w/jalepanos for the adults.  Good comfort food and easy to prepare.  I will make this again.  Thanks for the post!

When I presented the meal, my kids said "no way!" I talked them into one bite, and then I couldn't stop them! I used 2 pkgs. beef ramen noodles, but only one flavor packet. I also used the Italian seasoned diced tomatoes. My husband and I added hot sauce to ours--I'm sure salsa would be great as well. This is an easy, filling recipe. I'm definitely making it again.

Wow...I was very skeptical about this one but after reading all the great reviews I gave it a shot and...it was FANTASTIC and FLAVORFUL!  I added some garlic and onions to the beef as well as some salt and pepper, used 2 packs of Oriental Mr. Noodles with their seasoning packets, and added a bit of chicken broth as the mixture looked too dry to cook the noodles.  Oh and I also threw in a pinch or two of sugar.  I think I might cook the noodles separately next time and then throw them in once they are softened...might be easier and quicker.  I'd give this 5 stars if only it looked prettier.  Tasted great and husband enjoyed several servings of it!

Very good and very easy.  Disagree with someone else's "PWT" label.  Quick, easy and tasty is of great value, especially when trying to keep the food budget down!  I felt that the Oriental flavoring got a bit lost, so I added soy sauce & that perked it up.  Next time, I plan to add some chopped onion with the hamburger as it browns.

This is the best $1.88 I've ever spent! Had a 1/2 pound of ground beef left over and a very short amount of time before dinner. Paid less than $2 for a can of corn, a can of tomatoes w/ green chilis (highly recommend, LOTS of added flavor) and a pack of oriental Ramen. Super easy, super fast, SUPER tasty...my boyfriend ate my leftovers! Halved the recipe except for the seasoning packet, used all of that for addded flavor. Will definitely be making this again...if this poor white trash food is wrong, I don't wanna be right!

I first tried this recipe exactly as printed, and thought it was just okay.  Wasn't crazy about the oriental seasoning, and I especially did not like the sweet taste the liquid from the corn gave the dish.  Tonight I tried it again, this time using 1lb of beef, two cans of diced tomatoes, two packages of ramen noodles, without using the seasoning packets, one can of corn (drained)  and then added about 3/4 cup of tomato sauce, a little fat free half and half, and some parmesan cheese.  Delicious!!

My whole family loves this. Has become a must have on the monthly menu.  Easy enough for my teens to cook. I used the oriental noodles, left over bbq sauce and a diced onion. Followed the directions except cooked the noodles seperate and plated them first to make a nest for the meat & veg., looks much nicer that way. This dish has tons of potential. With todays economy this is a good tasting quick easy meal that all will love. (glad that some of the readers are rolling in the dough and can afford top shelf products)

Try adding V8 juice instead of juice from the corn can, and the tomatoes and it is a healthy and tasty alternative, overall this was a quick and good meal for me and my three daughters!

Wow, this recipe is shocking how it tastes much better than it sounds!  One thing I was impressed with was that it tasted even better as leftovers (I usually hate leftovers), I guess the flavor had more time to soak in.  I did add garlic and onion to the beef, but other than that, I made it just as written.  This is a great recipe that I'll have to remember next time kids are over or I need a quick meal!  Thanks for this recipe!

I have made this for a while now using whatever veggies I have on hand. I dont use canned veggies though. Frozen or fresh work best. I also add a tiny amount of soy sauce and fresh garlic which helps too.

I am giving this 5 stars not because it's a gourmet meal, but because it was super easy to make and everyone enjoyed it.  I am actually shocked it was as good as it was.  In order to shave off some sodium, I chopped up fresh tomatoes and used frozen corn.  I also used 2 packets of ramen noodles, but only one seasoning packet.  Because I used fresh tomatoes, I needed to add some water and soy sauce to get the noodles to soften.  But it was great, and GONE!  With growing kids/teens - that's all I ask for!

Been making a similar quick, but tasty dish for years, but instead of Ramen, I've used Kraft Delux mac 'n cheese and a can of Rotel original. Love that taste with cheddar cheese. Quick,easy, cheap, and good!

A great way to clean out your pantry staple items (and yes, Ramen is a staple item for us).  We used 2 pkgs (plus two seasoning packets) of Chicken-flavored Ramen instead of the Oriental, and perhaps 1/3 c. of salsa instead of the diced tomatoes--the salsa having more flavor in my opinion.  What amazing flavor this has!  Will definitely make this again and again.  The only reason for four stars is that I'm not certain the leftovers taste will match that as the "just cooked" taste since the Ramen noodles tend to become gummy when leftover.

This worked out great for my family. I doubled the recipe as I didn't think 4 servings would be enough. We still have plenty of leftovers for lunch tomorrow and that is with everyone having seconds and some people had thirds! Even my picky eater ate it up. Went well with skillet corn bread.

My family loves this recipe.  I used mixed veggies instead of just corn.  I also double it b/c I have 3 guys with big appetites eating this.  I also serve with bread sticks to round it out.  Cheap and easy.  Nothing fancy, so if you're looking for gourmet (or are a food snob) don't bother making a recipe that calls for ramen noodles.

Such a quick, flexible meal. I love recipes I can plug whatever is on hand into, and that's just what I did. I used a pound of leftover cooked brats and doubled the noodles, adding a can of chicken broth and thus draining the corn. I also added a medium zucchini I had in the fridge.  I skipped the ramen seasoning pack and added a lot of crushed red pepper. I had never thought of using ramen noodles for the "pasta" in a dish, thanks so much for sharing.

Good quick go-to recipe when you're running low on ingredients.  I used rotel, some carrots (I was out of corn), and added a few tablespoons of sour cream at the end.  I also used some from fresh herbs and spices instead of the ramen packet (I'm not fond of MSG).

Unfortunately this didn't go over very well with my family.  It seemed to have this funny little taste with all the different spices.  However, it was very easy to make so it was worth the try.

Good for a quick and easy dinner. I doubled the noodles and seasoning packets, added a few dashes of worcestershire and hot sauce. I also sauted some chopped onion and garlic in skillet before adding the ground beef to brown. It got two thumbs up from the hubby!

I found this recipe when doing an ingredient search for what I thought would be an  impossible combination of items. As it turns out, this was not only delicious, but easy, and incredibly budget-friendly! Our 3 year-old loved it. My husband and I both had seconds. It's a great, simple dish, perfect for a fast supper. I followed the recipe exactly except for salting generously after the tomatoes were added. Thanks for a quick, delicious meal!

Because my family does not like tomatoes, I substituted a can of cream of mushroom soup in place of them.  My family LOVED it.

This was very easy and surprisingly yummy.  I browned a whole onion with the ground beef..and added salt, pepper, and Worcestershire Sauce.  I used two packaged of Ramen noodles, but only one seasoning pack.  I also added a cup of water with the noodles as there didn't seem to be enough liquid.  Delicious. :)

I've made a similar recipe for years - I use rice instead of noodles and do cook chopped onions along with ground beef.  I use Rotel tomatoes and depending on how large a dish I'm making, I sometimes add a can of tomato sauce and add some dashes of Worchestershire..my family will say "time for us to have Winkie's goulash".....have also subsititued elbow noodles....whatever way it's worth ***** (5 stars)

I made this tonite for dinner. This serves 4 but I had to punch it up to serve 15. Shockingly it wasn't bad. I used the beef noodles, no oriental. I used some beef stock, also I added a little bit of better than bouillon beef to punch up the beef flavor. I also added black pepper and a bit of sugar to off set the tomatoes. Very very yummy!!!

You know how when you run out of ideas to make and your pantry is bare so you turn to this wonderful website.  Well, that is what I did and I made this last night.  Needless to say........Simple rated a 5!  Flavor "1"!  If I would ever make it again I would season my beef with 2 packages of flavor and 1 package of noodles.  There was no flavor at all even when I added soy to the beef.  I used 1lb of beef and it was very bland!  I did add cheese.

I really love how easy and quick this is! Yes it's raman and ground beef but that's just the base... I added the tomatoes and corn but then I also added can asparagus and green beans. I think any veggies added to this would taste great. The noodles do end up a little slimey but it was a HIT in my house.. everyone ate their veggies! 
I wish I would have known about this recipe when I was a young kid and living off plain raman.

Great Recepie.  I follow the recepie and it came out great.  Don't try to season the meat while cooking, it makes it salty.  I used Chicken flavored and had to doctor the seasoning a bit later, but it was still great.

This is a keeper!! Good tasting good looking and very economical. I modified it a bit because I don't use canned veggies and was out of tomatoes. 
So I used a large can of chunky tomato basil soup, and threw in a few peas for color in addition to the corn. I also used almost 2 packages of seasoning. My new go to meal for hamburger for sure.

I followed this recipe to a T... we really didn't care for it at all. We found it to be extremely bland, which was surprising because Ramon noodle soup is so flavorful. This was my one new recipe for the week and I won't be making it again.

My husband I loved this quick recipe.I doubled the abount of noodles and I also used 1 can of rotel tomatoes and 1 can diced, I also used the mexi corn. My 4 year old and 2 did not like because it was too spicy. Next time i will leave the rotel out for them. However;If your kids like a little spice leave it in.
Thanks

I just created an account with Allrecipes and this is the first recipe I've tried.  I usually cook once or twice a week when my wife gets stuck at the office.  This was a real easy recipe which I appreciated and it rocked! Very tasty and I guess it's pretty nutritious too.    My little guy and I ate most of it and when my wife got home she enjoyed what was left.  Thanks

I have had this in my recipe box forever just waiting to try it out. I wasn't expecting much because hello it's base is ramen noodles. I do like ramen though and all the other ingredients so I figured this would make one of those yummy so bad for you dishes. Well not so much. I made this exactly as specified and it didn't really have any flavor. The only thing you could really taste was canned tomatoes. I will say it was very filling though. I don't think I'll make this again. If I did it require lots of tweaks where I might as well just make something else.

Love this for a quick, throw together meal.  You can substitute any veggie on hand or flavored diced tomatoes.  I have also substituted black beans instead of ground beef for a non-meat version.  Give a try, and play with the ingredients!

It was really good! We used venison and added a can of Rotel and a can of corn. It was a little spicy so we toned it down with cheese. My 1 and 5 year old wouldn’t even try it. They pushed their bowls away.

This is a great idea, but with a history of cancer in the family, we've reduced beef intake, and have stopped eating ramen, and canned anything a long time ago. We used whole wheat noodles, turkey, and fresh vegetables, including sauteed onions instead. A dash of oregano or parsley finishes it perfectly. Very fresh!

I didn't have an ramen noodles and didn't have time to run to the store...but I just used normal spaghetti, to make the flavoring, I crushed up two beef bullion cubes mixed in a little bit of pepper and some garlic salt! YUM! I'm not a fan of tomatoes, but the flavor of this dish was GREAT! Next time I will just use tomato juice and maybe add carrots instead of the diced tomatoes!

The only thing I didn't like about this was that It didn't make enough for seconds.  I used 2 pkgs of noodles and went back to make another pkg.

I just tried this recipe expecting to get ho hum results. It was so much better than I expected. I didn't have Oriental flavor Ramen noodles so I used chicken. I also added about a cup of water to the recipe. I'm trying to lose weight so I recommend using frozen corn, which has fewer calories than canned. This is really good for a quick and reasonably tasty meal! To make it even better, it's really inexpensive. Try it!

Really easy recipe to whip up with stuff you most likely already have on hand. And if you don't... I only had a BIG can of diced tomatoes (28oz) so I used 2 packages of ramen noodles. Also didn't have canned corn at the time, so used a 8oz pack of frozen corn. came together really quick, I added about 1/2 cup water so it would still have a little liquid. My kids ate it! No complaints! we've renamed it Mexi-nese!

Very easy!  I used 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef and 2 pkgs of beef ramen noodles.  I also added about 1 cup of water, both season packs and rotel mild tomatoes, canned corn and covered as it simmered.  It was perfect!  Thanks for this quick and easy recipe!!

This was an excellent MEAL.  I didn't have any corn (imagine that) when it was time to make it so I substituted peas.  It was still good and the sweet taste of the peas complimented the spicy seasoning.  We also used Rotel, mild.  My husband usually doesn't eat tomatoes because it gives him heartburn but he had no complaints after eating! We will make this again.

For a standard, no fuss recipe this was pretty good. I doubled the noodles but only used one seasoning packet as others have recommended since they stated it was too much flavor with both, but then we found it sort of lacking in flavor. It was easy and quick, which is a must in our house, but next time I will either add both seasoning packets or flavor the meat a little.

Not bad at all.  I used 3 packs of oriental flavor, 1 1/2 lb ground beef, 1 sm can of tomato sauce, a can of beef broth, a little water and some frozen corn and green beans.  Quick and easy.

This turned out better than I expected.  I substituted frozen corn and added frozen peas & carrots.  Used 2 packs of the chicken flavor - was a bit salty - next time I will use 1 pack of seasoning.  I also used 1 can of whole tomatoes broken up and a can of tomato sauce rinsed with a can of water.  Will make again.

I made this dish because of all the good reviews, but it was only ok. My kids ages 5 and 9 didn't like it at all.  Also, I did not like the smell when it was cooking.  I think it was the canned corn smell that I am not used to using. Yes it was easy and different, but I wish I had used my ground beef in good ole' spaghetti instead! If you are wary, skip this dish.

VERY good.  I used 2 packets of beef flavored noodles, 1 packet of seasoning, homemade rotel tomatoes and since I didn't have corn I used green beans.  I also added several dashes of soy sauce.  Someone else mentioned how it isn't an appealing looking dish, and I imagine that it isn't with the corn, but the with green contrast of the beans it was.  Tasted good too.  Only 4 stars b/c I wouldn't say it was "the Best" but it is definitely yummy and something we'll have again.  Next time I think I'll add baby corn, bamboo shoots and water chestnuts.

Holy !! This recipe just didnt sound right. I would never think tomatoes and Corn would go good with ramen noodles at all But I was wrong. One thing I didnt understand was the portions of this recipe. I would like some noodles with my ground beef lol So what I did was boil 4 ramen noodles seprate and used only 2 flaver packets. Cooked the beef and when almost done added the tomatoes, corn. I did this too extract the juices. Than drained. Added pepper, minced onion and garlic powder. Next time Im gonna added chopped garlic. Great for Nothin in the house Deal or Being Broke!!:0

I really dig this recipe. It's so quick and easy, I honestly don't know why I haven't tried this before. I left out the tomatoes and used a red bell pepper instead. I also added more water and a little soy sauce. I thought the corn was kind of an odd flavor and texture for this - I think it made it taste a little too similar to shepherd's pie the way I make it, so next time I'm going to try snow peas and maybe even some broccoli bits or something like that. This recipe could really go whatever direction you want to take it just by using different meat, seasonings, etc.

Not bad at all! Doesn't look the most appetizing while in the pan, but once put in a bowl looks tasty and 'homey'.   I doubled everything except for the corn (I didn't have another can), and used Thai 'ramen' noodles called WaiWai. Used both the seasoning and spice packets but omitted the oil mixture. Also used a 28 ox. can of whole peeled tomatoes that I cut myself in place of the diced the recipe called for.  I'll definitely make this again, probably seeing what else would be good in it, but it's definitely okay as it is!

Awesome recipe! Really easy to make and cheap to boot!  All the ingredients are things I usually have on hand (what college student doesn't have ramen?) and it's ready in minutes - can't beat that!  I cut all the ingredients in half since I wanted to make just a little for my boyfriend and I for lunch, but I still used a full pack of beef ramen noodles and seasoning (ran out of oriental) and I didn't add the tomatoes because I didn't have it in my pantry like I thought I did :(  But instead I added a small chopped onion (fried in a separate pan), and I thought it really added something to the recipe :)  I also added about a 1/2 cup of water when adding the seasoning because it didn't seem like I would have enough juices to boiling the noodles in, and covered the pan while simmering.  All in all, very good recipe, thanks for posting it! :D

Great recipe to make in a pinch. I had all the ingredients on hand in the pantry. I doubled the noodles like most did. I cooked the noodles in advance but only till it broke apart. It continues to cook when you combine it with the meat mixture. It looked like alot when I was done but it was just the right amount.

As a family affected by job cuts and big mortgages I've been trying to pinch pennies on grocery shopping and by finding economical recipes.  This was a good one and everybody liked it.  I didn't spice it up at all since my little ones are too finicky.  Even if things pick up for us I will keep this in my meal rotation.  Thanks

It was pretty good as written, it is super easy to make and most likely you will have all ingredients on hand. I cooked the noodle mixture too long (I think I left it for an extra 2 min) which made the noodles too soft (my own fault). I doubled the amount of ground beef and added a can of drained little baby corns, and then added a few dashes of red pepper flake just to add some spice because as written it is pretty bland. All in all it was a simple fast meal and I plan on making it again.

This is 5 star based on taste and quick preparation! Presentation is not great.  My teenagers looked at it in the pan and said "Oh my gosh, what is it!"  But everyone loved it and wanted more.  I used 3 packages noodles, 2 packets of seasoning and a little water to compensate for the extra noodles.  Very, very, good!!!

We loved this recipe - came home from a  long trip and tried to pull dinner together from what was in the freezer and pantry.  This recipe was perfect I used two packages of ramen and added a little water because I used frozen corn.  My husband said he could eat it all night and all 3 kids ages 5 though 9 finished their bowls.  Will definitely make again.

This was great for a quick easy meal. I added some seasoning, and used thin spaghetti noodles, didn't have ramen noodles. Great!

quick, easy & customize-able dish! it didn't win any raves at our house, but it was eaten and with a little bit of creativity, i'm sure it could be made to suit everyone.

So simple and so delicious!! I anticipated the dish to come out not as pretty as it did - I put more beef and not as many noodles. Instead of the spices, I added taco seasoning. I also added fresh tomatoes and kidney beans. At the very end I added a lot of cilantro. My family raves about it! Will definitely make it another time! Very colorful, easy and yummy. Thank you!

This got mixed reiews. I made it two different ways. First, I made it exactly as written and 2 out of 3 liked it. I also made it vegatarian only subbing Boca crumbles for the ground beef and 1 of 2 liked that. I'm not sure if I will make this again.

Sorry.  Not for us.  It was OK, but my husband said, "This is OK, but I'm not going to ever ask you to make it again."  It was, however, cheap, easy and edible.  I was disappointed because I had read so many positive reviews.  Oh well, win some, lose some.  I'm not saving this recipe or recommending it.

This is a quick - "I have ground beef to use, what else can I make", kind of dish. As written I think it's too salty with the seasoning packet without any additional liquid. I used to make a version of this probably 25 yrs ago when first married only w/chicken breast and chicken flavored Ramen Noodles. I always boiled the noodles in a little less water than you would for soup. You can really add anything you want to this kind of recipe. My 2 yr old at the time loved this one plate dish. With adding ingredients (red pepper flakes/onion etc.) my husband liked it as well.

This was okay for what it is. My family ate it and agreed. Very easy and cheap to make so it's good for a quick whip up. I had everything I needed to make it so I liked that.   I used 2 packages of the noodles and added some water (about 1 cup) and halve of a bouillon cube when I added the noodles, corn, diced tomatoes and spice packs.

Although I thought this dish was so-so my family loved it so I'm giving it a 4. Sure was easy to make. I used 2 packs of noodles and a little water as others suggested. I think even 3 packs of noodles would be good and will try that next time.

This was quick and easy to make! As others have said, its not pretty, but works. I made a few changes....I added broccoli instead of tomatoes and corn because i didnt have them. Used two packages of noodles and added a little more seasoning and water for the extra noodles.

I'm always looking for ground beef dishes because they are one of my hubbies favorites.  I was skeptical about this one but because it has so many good reviews, I gave it a shot.  Should have followed my instints.  I will not be making this one again.

I used a can of rotel, an extra package of noodles, asparagus, edimame, and diced orange peppers. left out the corn.  was a little spicy for my liking but that's what I get for using rotel instead of tomatoes.  very tasty and simple.  thanks for the idea

This was a good, quick, easy dinner, and lends itself to lots of modification.  My 16-year old made it with ground turkey, also sauteed some onion and red pepper, and seasoned it with curry powder and fresh chopped scallions.  Good comfort food.

I give this 4 stars for how simple and economical it is.  It does not look pretty nor does it taste that grand but it makes for a quick easy dinner that's not half bad.  I made it with ground turkey because that's all I use and added garlic to it while I was browning. I wanted to make a bigger serving size so I used 4 packets of ramen, 4 seasoning packets, a 28.5oz can diced tomatoes, a can of beef broth, and added a bag of stir fry vegetables. My husband really enjoyed this dish but I felt like it was missing something.  It came off a little bland to me.  I will probably make it again but still searching for the missing ingredient. ???

I used two packs of ramen and only one spice pack.  Frozen mixed vegtables instead of canned corn and a large 24oz can of stewed tomatoes.  My family looked at it and turned up their noses, IT is NOT pretty.  But they tasted it and asked for seconds.  That rates as a hit at our table.  Quick and simple rates as a hit with me the cook.

Not the most elaborate, or fancy meal, but very easy and very tasty.  I added a can of green chilies, and used my own spices, instead of the ramen noodle packets, which contain MSG.  I also added just a little sugar to smooth the flavor - make it richer.  LOVED IT!

ok, my family ate the entire dish in minutes!!!!!
it only took max. 10 minutes to make and they ate it all in less time!!!

no joke , this may not be the healthiest but for a quick meal with a big family and lots going on this rocked the house!
trying to think of ideas to add to make it a bit healthier like : a scoop of crushed flax, puree veggie like carrot or cauliflower etc.. garlic

but this was tremendously great!
thanks

yes, this is a kid-friendly recipe, more distinguished palates, not so much.  for the kids, i added garlic & onion powder and used italian diced tomatoes which i gave a whirl in the mini food processor. like others who commented, i added beef broth and also a roux to thicken the sauce up a bit.  the kids loved it.

This recipe can't be beat for quick, easy, and only one dish to clean. It is great as is, and I also made it tonight with Italian diced tomatoes and a can of mixed vegetables instead of just corn (all I had). It was delicious! My 3 1/2 year old who only ate two things, now eats three....thanks for the great recipe. :)

This recipe is yummy!! My family absolutely loved this. (The hubby went back for more)! It is very quick and easy to make, perfect for the family that is short on time. I changed it up just a little bit to accommodate what I had on hand. I used frozen corn and Italian seasoned diced tomatoes. I also added a little bit of water since I used 2 packages of the noodles. This will be a regular meal in my house since it went over so well.

This dish is economical and very tasty.  I was surprised just how flavorful it was using such simple ingredients, and it was filling, too.  I stretched the pound of ground beef by doubling the other ingredients, and it still came out really good.  I didn't have Oriental ramen, so I used pork ramen instead, and it worked just as well.  I also used 15-ounce cans of corn because that's what I had on hand, and the liquid was still adequately absorbed by the noodles.  This is a very flexible recipe and easy on the food budget.

This was my second time with this recipe. I love it. I added an extra pack of noodles this time as other people have. Like others say if the picky husband eats it - it's a keeper. He may even request it.

I made this saturday night for my 12 and 7 year olds.  i added half an onion to the meat while browning as well as a clove or two of minced garlic.  i used the beef ramen and i used two pkgs.  it turned out awesome!  my son ate his so fast and told me the next day i needed to make it again.  in fact, as i'm typing this i'm eating the last little bit of leftovers! 
thanks for the recipe!

Good recipe to improve upon!  I sauteed a red onion, some minced garlic, and 2 jalepenos (chopped, and seeds removed) with 1.25 pounds of ground chuck.  I doubled the oriental ramen noodles, used mexicorn, and also added a small can of green chilles.  During the last couple minutes of cooking, I added a cup or so of salsa.  Very good!

My husband absolutely raved about this which was a little embarrassing because it took absolutely NO effort or skill.  I made it for him again a few days later, subbing a can of Rotel tomatoes and using 2 packages of Ramen noodles. Had to add a little water.  It was pretty spicy, but he liked it even better and ate the entire recipe himself. This has to be the quickest meal I've ever prepared.

EXCELLENT! I used the beef ramen noodles (1 pkg) and everything else according to recipe.  Delicious.  Will have to double the recipe next time so we have left-overs.  We added mexican shredded cheese to each serving and enjoyed it very much.

I loved how easy this was to make.  I used 2 packages of ramen noodles, like others suggested.  I didn't have Oriental flavored ramen, so I used Beef instead.  I thought it tasted pretty good.  I was more impressed with how easy it was to make.  My husband didn't like the flavor of the sauce.  Maybe the Oriental sauce would have tasted better?  Also, I doubled the recipe and it made A LOT!!  Too much for a family of four, but it was nice for my husband to take it to work the next day.  He said it tasted better the next day.

Not bad at all and a quick and inexpensive meal for this exhausting time of year!  I spiced it up like a lot of the reviewers and the family ate it all right up even though it's not too pretty a dish. I love finding these easy yummy recipes and will make again.  Thanks

It was quite bland but I decided to add some stuff to spice it up.  I added the tomato and corn (mexicorn) to the beef and cooked it all together and I also added Goya Adobo seasoning, garlic, onion powder, chives, salsa, chili powder, and some beef bullion.  These were things that most of us have on hand so it should be pretty easy to do. I Aalso used plain noodles. My 3 year old loved it!

I don't know what everyone's raving about. It wasn't completely inedible, but it wasn't very good, either. My kids took one look at it and refused to eat it.

I just picked up the ramen noodles on sale 8 packs for $1 and I went searching for recipes.  The funny thing is the corn was also on sale and I had picked up several cans too.  This turned out  really good and  was so quick to make.  My kids liked it a lot.  My older daughter wrapped her portion  up in a flour tortilla which was a little messy but she was happy. She's planning to take this recipe along when she goes off to her dorm next month.  What a good thrify meal.  Thanks

I had to try this when I saw several excellent reviews for a recipe with only 4 ingredients.  This was very good actually.  I can't give it 5 stars because it's not filet mignon after all, but it sure beats hamburger helper!  I served it with a salad and some red pepper biscuits from this site.  I also added a little red pepper to the meat mixture and it was yummy.  Thanks for submitting this.

I was looking for a quick recipe with ingredients that I had in the pantry when I found this one. At first I didn't think it would be very good, but I was wrong. There does seem to be something missing that I haven't figured out yet (maybe diced tomatoes with the chilis), but the hubby liked it a lot. I will most definately make this again! Thank you for sharing!

Nice, economical and quick. I omitted the corn and spiced it up quite a bit using salt, pepper, garlic powder and italian seasonings. I also browned onion and garlic with the ground beef. I served with shredded parmesan, asiago and romano cheeses. This was good, 4 stars only because I reserve 5 stars for the really exceptional recipes. This is great for kids!

I gave this five out five because it was simple, cheap, and quick to throw together with all the items right in your pantry! I did add a tiny bit of water (from the tomato can) and I also added some garlic, seasoning salt, and pepper. When I was about ready to fix plates I sprinkled shredded cheese on top. I was pretty skeptical about it being any good, but it was. Nice recipe!

I wasn't sure how this would turn out but it was a hit.  I'll definitely add this to my rotation since it's so quick and the ingredients are normally on hand.  Even my picky 8 year old twins liked it. It served 3 kids and 1 adult (my husband)  but next time I'll increase the quantities so I can get more than just a few bites since there wasn't enough for seconds for my hubby (who had a very generous first serving as well!)  I'll probably only use the 1 package of seasoning though to keep the sodium level down.  Thanks

HELPFUL TIP BEFORE YOU WASTE YOUR TIME: Big lover of ramen...  heck, I'm Asian.... also a huge lover of goulash, but....  this was NOT a kid favorite as so often talked about.  I have 4 kids.  They all said it 1) needed more flavor  2) would taste better with a different noodle  3) did I say needed more flavor?   Personally, I felt it was edible, but I'm the human garbage disposal in our home...and we COULD eat it again, but I believe in only saving recipes that you want your kids to remember.  This isn't one.  I definitely agreed with cooking the beef separate from the noodles.  Cooked the noodles in the liquids it indicates (from the diced tomatoes and corn).  Would be improved by adding some spices and other veggies.

o be honest, I wouldn't have tried this if it wasn't for all the good reviews. I used the recipe as written and yes, it was really good!. And what a simple dish! I was surprised how far it stretched to feed four of us.  I also tried it with beef ramen and we didn't like the flavor as much as the Oriental. I'm definitely keeping this in the rotation fora quick go to meal that everyone likes.

This was better than expected! I was out of oriental ramen and corn so I used beef ramen and a can of veg all instead. The variety of veggies in the dish turned out to be quite delicious. I’ll definitely make it again.

Made this for the family tonight - even hubby thought it was okay!  My boys are a bit picky so I pureed the tomatoes before adding them.  Served alongside nacho chips.

This was good, quick and easy. I substituted a can of creamed corn since it was all I had on hand.  It gave the dish a creamy, sweet flavor.  I also added chopped cooked broccoli and some thinly sliced baby carrots.  I’ll make it again.

This is really good especially for how easy it is to make. I used diced tomatoes with green chilies because it was what I had on hand.

I usually dont make ramen recipes, but this one looked good! However, I made the recipe with recommendations from other reviewers: Adding (1/4) onion and garlic to the beef, adding a small can of tomato sauce, and using Italian diced tomatoes instead of plain.  I also used frozen corn and added1/2 c water  This all added flavor and without these steps, the recipe may have been too bland.  For my family of five, I used 4 pkgs of ramen with two packets of seasoning.

This was so quick and easy and I really loved it. I double the recipe and used three packets of Ramen noodles that were beef flavored, 3. 14 ounce cans of tomatoes, 2. 15 ounce cans of corn. I used to pounds of beef. But it was all done and put some cheddar cheese on my surfing and served it up with some Italian bread and butter. Simple and delicious!

This was very tasty, I did double the recipe, it is a lot 'wetter' than I would have liked. I did put a lot more spice in it to 'kick it up' a little.
I will make this again.

The first time I made this, I didn't like the Oriental flavor ramen noodles.  I then tried chicken ramen noodles and it was better.

Wow. I read this recipe a few weeks ago. So simple. I didn't think my husband would go for it. Tonight I asked him if I could try this recipe I saw. He said sure. It is a keeper. I didn't follow it exactly. I didn't have canned tomatoes, so I used medium picante salsa. That gave it a great kick. I will definitely make this again. Going to share it with my bachelor sons as well.

Really very good... and I was skeptical! But I was desperate... it was one of those nights where I hadn't gone to the grocery store in weeks and the only thing available to prepare was a pound of defrosted ground beef! I had most of the ingredients required... used mild Rotel bc I didn't have the diced tomatoes, and used a can of southwest black beans with corn... i did have to add some chicken stock, and I also used 2 bags of noodles, instead of 1. Everyone loved it and said this was a keeper! My husband is very picky but loved it, as did my 10, 9 and 7 year olds!  Thanks!

It was awesome I seasoned the ground beef with salt and pepper with a little Worcestershire . Probably wasn't necessary but it worked out. Will make again.

This was too simple to be so good. It's easy to keep all the ingredients on hand to make it in any emergency. I added 1 medium chopped onion just because I like onion in ground beef recipes.

We've all been there, trying to make dinner that is delicious and trying to only use what you have on hand.  That is  me today.  When I went to put this dish together, I knew that I didn't have Ramen noodles in my pantry.  Nothing against them, I just don't buy them.    BUT, what I DID have is some cut spaghetti (it's curly, right?)  I also swapped out the ground beef for Johnsonville Ground Italian Sausage.  NICE choice!  Since I didn't have a flavor packet that would have come with the Ramen, I used 1 T. Italian seasoning instead.   Not only was it an appropriate choice given the ingredients I was using, it was DELICIOUS!  You can not go wrong with this combination, I promise.  If I had all of the ingredients that this recipe calls for, I wouldn't have known about these tweaks because I would have followed the recipe word for word.     Because I did make substitutions to this recipe, I am giving it 4 stars, but ONLY because I made those changes.  Give it a try.  It's so easy to make, takes just a few minutes to put together, it's very economical, and most of all, It's delicious :-)   #6IgredientOrLess

I thought this recipe was pretty good for something quick.  Some of the reviewers amaze me, this isn't a gourmet recipe, it's a quick meal that is all.  I added some soy sauce and sesame oil to the meat mixture, I also added an extra package of ramen noodles.  Quite yummy and I would imagine that you could change the veggies that you put in it as well.

Not bad, much better than expected.  I did add 1 cup of finely chopped onion while browning the meat, used 2 pkgs. of noodles and 1-1/2 pkgs. of the seasoning, added 1 can of peas/carrots though next time I'll cut that back to 1/2 a can.  I felt it could have used additional seasonings maybe some hot peppers of some kind.

We love this recipe at our house!! It's in my regular rotation now. I use 2 packages beef ramen and add a half cup water to compensate for extra noodles. I know this is kind of weird but I like to serve it with tortilla chips dipped in sour cream then in noodles. It's really tasty this way:)!!

I made this for dinner tonight, with a few alterations. First I started with 3 packages of oriental ramen noodles(only 2 flavor packets), then 2lbs hamburger, I added a tablespoon of minced garlic and a generous amount of black pepper to the meat when making, I then added 1 can of corn, 1 can of rotel, some salsa and 1 can of green beans. It went over really well for my husband and I but the kids thought it was a bit spicy. I will definitely make this again!

I followed the recipe exactly and used vegetable flavoured noodles.  It turned out great - the family really enjoyed it!  I added about a cup of water the beef as it was cooking and then drained, as other users mentioned it helps get rid of unwanted grease from the beef!

OMG!! this dish was fabulous! I took the advice of others and doctored it up a bit. I added fresh garlic, onions, red bell pepper, crushed red pepper, dice tomatos with green chilies and instead of the seasoning from the romen noodle pack I added fajita seasoning...lol...I know it was alot of doctoring but my food must have flavor and this dish definitely had it when I was done! I will make this again!!

I wasn't sure about this recipe, but it was easy to make and turned out great. The kids really ate it up, and Mom (that's me) really liked it, too. I changed a couple of things: used ground bison instead of ground beef, and used 2 packages of noodles with 1 flavor packet. Add beef or veg broth if you need more liquid.

If I could give this 4.5, I would.  It gets a high rating for the ease, inexpensiveness & the fact that most things can be found in our pantry. It will go into an infrequent rotation at our house, something different from the usual "goulash."  (Infrequent because ramen noodles are not the healthiest choice of noodle for us - maybe they will come out with a low fat, low sodium, whole grain ramen noodle!)

I followed this recipe exactly as written and was surprised to find that it was really good.  Served with strawberry muffins, we all enjoyed it.  It's definitely kid friendly and budget friendly, not to mention quick and easy.  It's a keeper in our house.

Pretty good considering the ingredients used.  I did used two packages of ramon noodles (and both seasoning packets) as some others had done.  Surprisingly tasty!  When cooking, I thought it was just going to taste like ramon noodles, but the tomatoes really gave it a good flavor.  Oh I did have to add a little water, maybe 1/3 of a can.  Will make again if I need a FAST & EASY recipe.

Sorry-this stuff was not to my tsate! It had very little taste.  I first did it following directions, then I went with reviewers and added flavoring from two ramen noodle packs-still awful! Would never make again. I cook off of this site all the time, first bad review I have ever left.

I was VERY sceptical of this recipe but since my husband LOVES ground beef and I was feeling under the weather I decided I would stray from my usual complex recipe.  My husband loved it and so did my 2 1/2 year old son.  I did add chopped onion and red pepper just to make it a little more healthy and it tasted great.  Thanks for the easy and really good recipe:)

I made a smaller portion w/ 1 pkg. ramen.  I added garlic to g. beef.  Probably add more ramen and water to full recipe.

This was so good! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there was something missing with the flavor. Used 2 lbs. ground round and added minced garlic (2 cloves) and about 3/4 cp. of chopped onion while browning. I used 1 can diced tomatoes with green chiles in it and the 1 can corn. I did use 3 pkg. of chicken ramen noodles, but only used 2 of the seasoning packets. I did drain the water that came in the can of corn and added regular water to compensate the liquid, but I did end up adding 3/4 can more water. I put in additional garlic powder, salt, pepper, parsley and a little oregano. It was excellent! Most of my family loved it, the others are just plain picky. There were NO leftovers!

This was a great, quick and easy meal to prepare.  My hubby liked it and my picky kids even tried it!  The changes I made were:  ground turkey instead of ground beef, 2 pkgs chicken-flavored ramen, added 1/2 cup chopped onions and 1 tspn minced garlic while cooking ground turkey and also stirred in 1 cup frozen mixed veggies (no canned corn on hand) with canned tomatoes and 1 cup beef broth with noodles.

Curiously simple, yet good!  I was skeptical that with so few ingredients it would produce anything worth rating.  The kids ate it up, the husband ate it...and there were no left overs!  I added garlic powder and frozen corn (with water to make up what I thought would have been in the canned corn).  We topped the dish with some shredded cheddar cheese.  Fantastic, fast dinner!

I didn't have tomatoes, so I substituted Great Northern Beans and the family loved it.   My daughters don't even like beans and they gobbled it down.  I also used the Roast beef flavored noodles.  This is a great tasting recipe and you can substitute almost anything.  Very quick and easy to make too!

Great recipe to build on to suit your personal tastes.  I made the following variations based on what I had available and also to cut the fat content (the packet noodle mixes in Australia are often high in fat).  I browned the mince with half a chopped red onion and 2 cloves of garlic.  I added julienned carrot and red capsicum in with the original vegetables.  For flavour, I used a packet of dry vegetable soup mix, a dash of worcestshire sauce, ground pepper and 2 tablespoons of soya sauce.  I added shredded cabbage with the noodles and the simmered as per the recipe.  I served the noodles with sweet chilli sauce and dried fried spring onions. Definite keeper.  My mum loved this dish as well - it reminded her of mee goreng.

Very quick and the variations are endless. I used crushed stewed tomatoes, beef ramen, kidney beans, and chili powder and it was great. I might try making it with Italian tomatoes and shredded mozzarella, or Oriental ramen with chow mein noodles and water chestnuts.

I thought this was great, especially considering how easy it was to prepare.  I followed the directions almost exactly.  The only difference was I used an extra pack of Ramen noodles.  Will make again.

This was excellent. We don't eat red meat, so I used soy crumbles from MorningStar farms and chicken flavor ramen. I also use frozen mixed stir fry veggies and add two cups of water and 2-3 packets of ramen. It's super quick and easy and everyone cleans their plate and asks for seconds.

At first glance this dish does not look very appetizing!  After reading others reviews, I knew this one would need some tweaking.  I doubled the recipe and made the following adjustments:  Use a stock pot!  I used 2 packages of noodles, 1 can of diced tomatoes, 2 cans of corn, 1 can of red kidney beans, and black pepper to taste.  The beans add nice color and texture, not to mention flavor!  Because I thought the mixture was still a bit dry I added 2 cans of chicken broth.  To that, I then added soy sauce and wocestershire sauce to taste (more soy, a little worcestershire).  I think once you try the original recipe, you'll want to make the above modifications, enjoy the flavor!

Great weeknight meal.  I will make it again and again.  Of course I do look forward to playing with it a bit.  I added some frozen pease for a hit of green in the recipe.  Loads of flavour.

I could not find the Oriental variety of the Ramen noodles so I used 2 pkgs of the chicken flavor.  I added a small onion because I thought this recipe could use the extra flavor.  It didn't help. I'm not sure anything would help this. It was quite bland and tasteless. I won't make it again.

Five stars since it was such an easy recipe that I tried for a quick dinner last night.  I may leave out the ramen noodles next time and try it over egg noodles.  Thanks

VERY good soup.Was very surprised when my picky 2 kids ate it..I had to add a little bit of spices though(like black pepper,cumin,taco seasoning) ended up really good..I do have to say if you will make this tasty soup make sure you will serve it right away..cause i notice i cooked it early ahead of time and by the time I served it for my husband who came from work it,the noddles drained up all the liquid that was in it..Other than that it was YUMMYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!

My family really liked how the flavors blended in this meal.  And it was so quick and easy with just one pan to clean up.  I wonder how it would taste with other flavors of ramen noodles.

Good, quick, easy and made with stuff I always have in the pantry and freezer! Picky husband had seconds, said keep this one in the rotation. I only had chicken ramen so I subbed 2 packets of beef bouillon for the ramen seasoning packets.

Four stars for ease of making. 
I added beef broth, onions, garlic, parsley and oregano. Used 3 noodle pack with one can diced tomatoes. Had to add water cos the noodles absorbed all the moisture very quickly. 
I’ll make it again if I’m in a pinch.

Used lean ground turkey (no drain) and 2 packs of beef ramen instead of oriental. Just a dash of worchestshire and yum! Stupid easy and surprisingly delicious! Will definitely make again as a go to quick meal.

Yum! I didn't have oriental ramen, so I just used beef ramen. I also used frozen mixed vegetables with corn instead of canned corn. Quick and easy weeknight dinner for me and my husband. He liked it, however, I love ramen, so I really enjoyed it!

I liked this recipe, but my 14-year-old said he wasn't fond enough of it to have leftovers.  ;-)  I didn't have canned tomatoes, so added a black bean salsa instead, along with a teaspoon or two of minced garlic.

I probably won't make it again. Nothing tremendous about it. I used beef ramen thinking that would help the flavor but maybe the Oriental flavor is better. Not sure if I want to try it again.

I used 2 packs of ramen, which was perfect and it absorbed all of the liquid. I also used Beef flavor ramen instead of oriental.  Maybe that's what I did wrong, but it tasted like something was missing. (though I doubt that was it)

This is a great recipe. I made a few adjustments because my skillet was so big. I kept all the same items, but I added garlic salt, a cup of water and an extra ramen pouch.

It turned out great!

Like many others I added more packets of noodles. I cooked up a pound of ground beef and did not season the beef. After draining the beef, I added one can of petite diced tomatoes, 3 packets of oriental flavored ramen noodles, with all 3 packets of seasoning, and 2 cups of water mixed with better than bouillon beef flavor and 1 can of corn drained. I also added a tablespoon of tomato paste.  I was a little leery of the oriental seasoning at first, but when I tasted it? OMG! It was delicious!! My husband and 24 yr old daughter went crazy over it!! I made it so I could take it for lunch the next day and there was barely any left!! Easy, cheap and tastes YUMMY!!! Can't wait to share with my friends!!!

My initial response to the person that made the "white trash" comment was impolite, but then I decided that everyone is entitled to their own opinion.   Personally, I quite liked this recipe.  No, it's not gourmet, but for a quick meal on a week night when every one is rushing out the door, it made for a good, flavorful meal that we all enjoyed.  We added some chili lime sauce, for a little bit of spice, but otherwise stuck to the recipe as written.

I made this dish because of the ease and products on hand.  I figured since it was raved about, it must be pretty good.  I thought it was just marginal.  I could see where fixing it up would be advised.  I only had chicken ramen so added soy sauce.  That did make it better.  My teenage son liked it but commented that he didn't care for the tomatos and thought it would be better using chicken or beef.

Well, being from Wisconsin, I added some shredded cheese....  But this great.  Very easy, especially for a warm day.  If you don't have AC, it doesn't heat up the house.  Hubby ate it up!!

This is so easy and economical and it really tastes good!  The drawback is the appearance!  Not a pretty dish!

Made this as written. It's a quick meal. But it's lacking in flavor. We added a salad with it to give more veggies. But it was the perfect softball night....need a quick meal....dinner. But I will play with the flavors next time.

While this was not an "incredible" dish, it actually grew on me the more of it I ate.  Being a 4 ingredient dish and taking less than 20 minutes to prepare, it does make a pretty good "OMG...what am I going to have for dinner" dish.  I prepared it as the recipe stated, tasted it about 8 minutes into the simmer and decided that it was bland....so I added Cholula to taste.  My thought is that this is a basic dish that you can do a lot of playing around with using different ingredients and spicing.  I'm planning on making this again.

A cold rainy day here and this easy recipe filled the bill.  Of course I changed things up a bit (doesn't everyone?).   Unfortunately, I don't measure things, so take that into consideration.  Added about a 1/3 cup of salsa (leftover), a few shakes of Worcestershire, dried spring onions and about a tablespoon of Better than Bouillon (beef flavor).  Used 1 can of Rotel w/green chilis, grated carrot, frozen peas and extra water.  Did not use corn.  Two packages of noodles, one of seasoning.  Topped w/shredded cheddar cheese.  Definitely not gourmet, but certainly satisfying.

This meal was super delish, affordable and liked by every member of the family.  I made a double batch the second time for leftovers.  If you've always wanted a ramen noodle recipe for a full meal that was actually good, this is it.

I have made this recipe. I used Rotella diced Hot tomatoes, chicken Raman Noodles as I did not have beef. used 3 pkgs but only two of the seasoning pkgs. I had frozen mixed vegetables on hand and used 3 cans of water from tomatoes. salt & peppered, with onion powder and garlic powder and then towards end I added fresh pares an cheese. it was a little hot but good. I only had the hot tomatoes on hand. next time I will use regular. all adults so it was fine this time but have to tone down next time for kids to eat.

I made this (almost) to the recipe. I added about half of a medium to large onion as I was browning the ground beef. I wish I had added a small can of peas and carrots. We really liked it. To the reviewer that called this poor white trash food; I for one like poor white trash food. After all I yam what I yam! :0)

I was really surprised by this meal. We really liked it. My 2 yr old loved it. I did add an onion and garlic to the beef while it coked and used two sets of noodles. I only used 1.5 of the season packets. We will def have this again. Just a nice quick meal for the week night.

OMGee  this was stupid good.  I wonder to myself how this can be a five star and so can prime rib because it is just a nothing dish with nothing ingredients that is bursting with flavor…that's why!  I added some onion to the ground beef when I was browning it.   I used 2 packages of oriental ramen noodles with both seasoning packets and 3/4 cup of water to make up for the difference.  Yum…so excited!!

Personally, I would give this 2 stars, but my kids liked it, so I compromised. I added 2 of the beef flavor packets & I found it still lacked flavor! The corn added nothing to the dish whatsoever. If I try this again I would use the oriental flavor and incorporate more Asian flavors/ingredients.

My husband recently had some teeth pulled so he can only chew soft foods for the time being.  I tried this recipe this evening and followed it mostly, with just some adjustments for our individual tastes.  I used garlic flavored diced tomatoes and a couple of handsful of frozen corn as well as the pound of ground beef.  Of course I had to add a little water to make up for the fluid missing by not using canned corn.  I only used one package of the noodles since I thought it would be enough for the two of us.  This made a good amount of food for just the two of us so we have more than enough for leftovers.  My husband had no trouble eating this dish and he really enjoyed the mix of flavors.  This is definitely a dish I will be making in the future.

We have had this a couple times now and I always put my own spin on it, and it's different every time.  I'm making it tonight, and it will have mixed veggies in it, since I don't have a can of corn.

I love how easy this is. When I put it down in front of my 4 year old, all I heard was, Mom! I hate this!! After arguing for 10 minutes, crying and pouting, he finally tried one tiny bite. Then all of a sudden he says, "Oh, I like this." And he proceeded to finish the whole bowl. My husband added cheese to his, and said it was great.

Very quick and very easy. I had 1.5lbs ground beef so I added one more pack of noodles with about a cup of water. I also did two full packets of seasoning. I added a little salt and pepper to taste. My kids loved it. Goes great with fresh made buttered bread. I'll definitely fix this again.

Quick, easy and it used up some ground beef and ramen noodles that I didn't know what to do with. But definately not a lot of flavor other than salt and sooo unhealthy. Tried it once, will finish the leftovers but I won't make this again.

Came across this and thought what a cool meal to make for me and my son...well I decided to dress it up a bit and use egg noodles instead...I did not use any seasoning packet, thinking that it really would not make that much of a difference...what I got was bland!! I did use diced tomatoes with green chiles, and that did not really pick it up...it was ok, I will eat more tommorow at work, but this is not something I see myself making again...sorry......

This is really good, and easy. I gave it 4 stars because I changed a few things. I cooked the ramen seperately, and then tossed it in the beef at the last minute. Also, I used like 3 packets of ramen instead of just 1, otherwise I felt like I was just eating ground beef with just remnants of noodles.

WOW! Am I impressed or what?  This was really good.  I did make a few additions (which I'm sure everyone does these)...I added some minced garlic to the meat while cooking and some onion salt; and I added 2 packages of noodles.  I will make this again.  Great quick recipe - thank you!

This recipe is awesome.  My husband told me this is his favorite meal and better the next day.  I added some beef broth to it.  My kids ages 10,7 and 6 love it also. Quick and easy to make and cheap as my 9 month old will be joining in the meals with us before long.

The recipe was great, easy, simple & quick! I used Ramen Noodles Chicken w/chili bits-gave it a little spicy taste.  I also added Garlic, oregano, S&P. My husband and I really enjoyed it! My 1st thought is next time I'd use the same recipe but 2 pkgs of Ramen Noodles. Recipe is easy to modify, and may try adding the veggie mix (peas, carrots & onions), even the kidney beans! Either way though it was delicious!

I used this for a camping meal and it was a hit. Easy to make on a camp stove. I followed other reviewers hints for modifications and am making it again for our upcoming camping trip.

***1/2 We liked this. I did add an onion, garlic & some celery. It's something that if your parents had made it when you were a kid, you'd now think of it as "comfort food": simple to prepare, plain, filling, nothing 'weird'. It's definitely something you can play around with. I will make it again, perhaps with the addition of some salsa & spices cooked in, and some cheese sprinkled on top.

We really liked this.   My family of five (3 under 6 years old) all enjoyed this.  I served it with salad and green beans.  Nice cheap and quick and easily adaptable to spices.  Thanks

We tried this over the weekend and it wasn't bad at all.  As a new bride it was easy to follow and not too expensive to make.  I have to pick up some new herbs and spices to add to my pantry and I'll try spicing it up some next time. Now that I've found Allrecipes maybe I'll be a gourmet cook one of these days and my hubby can really brag, but he was happy with this meal just as is!  Thanks

I suprised myself by trying this recipe, and go figure we liked it! My husband loved the fact that it was so cheap, but he dared me to serve it when we had someone over! It does look REALLY weird. I used a whole bag of frozen corn, cause I think it tastes better and a can of diced tomatoes w/jalapenos.Afraid it would have been bland w/o it. We will have it again.

I thought this sounded quick, easy and fairly good.  It met my expectations for quick and easy, but it needed something.  A little chili powder made it better.  I also think another package of noodles would be in order although perhaps not the second flavor packet.

This sounded strange but tasted pretty good. I probably wouldn't have tried it without the previous good reviews.   It was so easy to put this together with just one skillet which is a blessing in this hot sticky weather.  I served it in taco "bowls" even though it's not really a mexican recipe.  Thanks

This was a simple dish to make and pretty tasty .  I spiced it up by using mexicorn and rotel tomatoes with chiles  since my family loves anything with a mexican flavor. I drained the can of corn by habit then I re-read the recipe and realized I  shouldn't have so I added  water and a little dash of red pepper flakes.  I served it over curly pasta (gemelli) and it was very filling.
