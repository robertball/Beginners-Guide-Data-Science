A good recipe for oven roasted potatoes.  Not sure what makes these "Cajun" - given the recipeâ€™s title I would have expected to see some Cajun seasoning, befitting of its name.  Watch roasting time - it's not carved in stone; so dependent on size and thickness of potatoes.  Mine needed far less time!

this menu was ok, but i tweaked it a bit by first adding the potatoes to boiling water for 2 minutes then shocking them in old water, I also then added some oregano, to the spices. the potatoes came out crispy outside and soft and yummy inside.

These are nice, simple potato wedge.  I wanted to ensure a good crisp, so I cut my wedges a bit thinner and need MUCH less baking time (they were a tad dark brown at 20 min when I went to flip).  No error in time, just a heads up as all potatoes/cuts will be different, so keep an eye on them the first time you make them.  I followed the recipe, though I used jarred minced garlic (what I had) and eliminated the black pepper, per personal preference.  Mr. LTH ate these as is and I dipped them in a mixture of mayo/ketchup/yellow mustard along side our burgers.  Thanks for the recipe, KBT24!

I am a beginner in terms of cooking but my husband and son liked the wedges a lot, it's why I think I need to leave a positive comment. I did modified the recipe a little bit because I didn't have fresh garlic and onion powder, I used garlic salt instead. Before turning over I baked for 20 mins and after that, 15 mins. The wedges came out very crispy outside and it tasted very good. I will definitely make it again.

I have made these a couple times and I added about 1Tbsp. of Cajun seasoning. My husband loves them, and they're definitely healthier than frying.

I use all the spices as listed in this recipe but cook the wedges like the Baked Rosa Maria fries recipe (cook in the microwave for a few minutes first and then bake in the oven for about 20 minutes).  They seem to cook much better than just baking in the oven as well as more quickly.

I made the wedges according to recipe then added cayenne pepper and red pepper; also squeezed a whole fresh lime over the bowl the let it marinade for 30 minutes. Placed them in the oven for 20 minutes then flipped them and drizzled them with half the remaing marinade. Into the oven for another 20 minutes. They turned out bomb! With just the right kick of heat. I almost burnt them. Then I made ketchup and siracha mayo sauce on the side. I will definitely be making these again.

I also boiled these for about 10 minutes before baking them which I think reduced the cooking time. These were delicious!

Yummy! I had to give this one a 4 because I was looking for spicy (Cajun) and the base recipe didn't contain any zip. I halved the recipe because it was just me, and it was too much to eat, even though it was delicious. After tossing the potatoes in olive oil, I added the full tsp of garlic (yay garlic) all the seasonings except the onion powder, which I didn't have. I forgot the pepper (oops) but added 1/8 tsp of Cayenne Powder - which was plenty, and I like spice. 

The potatoes definitely needed a dipping sauce - next time I might try a couple of the other reviewers' suggestions, like microwaving or boiling the slices first, in an attempt to retain some more moisture. Still, yum! Will keep this in my recipe box.

I used yukon gold potatoes and microwaved for 2 minutes prior to cutting wedges as suggested by others.  While they smelled delicious cooking, they felt like they were missing a little something.  Next time I will try using garlic powder and extra salt?

I loved it. One thing I added was after flipping the wedges on the other side, I brushed them with the left over oil from the bowl, which has all the ingredients mixed within.

Followed the recipe exactly (just added some more paprika) and they're delicious! I've never made anything "creative" with potatoes before, so this is definitely my new favorite side.

Not sure what makes these Cajun but these are all of the ingredients I use when I fry potatoes in a skillet for breakfast so I thought why not? Mine got a little too done however I cut them in hearts for Valentines Day instead of wedges as the recipe calls for so mine were much thinner and it was my own fault for not checking on them more frequently. Great basic recipe for roasted potatoes in the oven. Get creative and add some herbs if you dare...

The name is a little misleading in my opinion (Cajun) but still very good. We add a little onion powder as well for a kick - good stuff!

Very excellent recipe-I added sweet onion slices with the potatoes for the first twenty minutes, then added fresh garlic cloves and fresh half cobs of corn on the cob(microwave for two minutes first) for the second 20 minutes of oven grill time. I also used coconut oil in the bowl instead of olive oil and drizzled coconut oil over the second 20 minutes of grill time! Yummy!
