This recipe is not for everyone. I enjoy juicing and can drink just about anything. I was able to make this with everything but the cauliflower. I already juiced some beets so I used that.

I agree,this recipe is not for everyone.  I used everything except celery.  It was too thick so I added orange juice.  It still doesn't taste very good.  I also tried coconut water with some success.  I think it is better than the OJ.
