Excellent tasting! I marinated in the fridge for 1 hour and then 2 more hours to bring it to room temp. I also used a light beer (that's all we had). This was not difficult to make, but the cook time needed much longer for my 6 lb. roast. Cooked for an hour covered, then uncovered and cooked for 1.5 hours. Then let it rest for 1/2 hour. Next time I will leave it in the oven for another 30 to 45 minutes. This was, by far, the best tasting prime rib I have ever made! The entire house smelled awesome too. Will make again next Christmas.

The best.  We had two ducks, a turkey and my roast.  Every one complimented the best prime rib they have tested!!!

Made this tonight and my husband and I loved it!!! I am known to mess up beef. Can't cook a steak to save my life! So my husband was not excited at all when I said I would try to make this.  Turned out amazing!  He said it was good. So happy I didn't Mess this one up! Thank you!
