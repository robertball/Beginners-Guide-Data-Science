Yum! Made it without the amaretto and it was fine. Ended up needing lots of extra water and much less boiling. Also used less sugar.

Even though I didn't carry this recipe through to the end (using the cornstarch), I'm giving it the full stars because it was thick and yummy without the last steps.  I think each piece of fruit (or each harvest) is so different in sweetness and in liquid that it is very good to have this alternative for thickening this syrup.  I didn't even cook mine as long as it called for.  This will be perfect for adding to my breakfast oatmeal, my Greek yogurt, mixed with sour cream for my pancakes.  And the list just goes on.  Very nice!  Thanks for the recipe, pomplemousse!

made it with peaches, only cooked it for about 45 minutes, and skipped the whole cornstarch thing (just a silly idea-it's plenty thick without!) very sweet, but i think i may make a large batch and can it for the winter months. it was very yummy over pancakes.
