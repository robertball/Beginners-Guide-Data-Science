This was very good and very easy as well.  I tripled the amount of curry to 1 1/2 tsp. Next time I will probably up it to 2 tsp and add some to the ham instead of just the batter.  I also added mixed veggies and minced onions instead of peppers and green onions and threw in 1/2 tsp of baking powder to the batter.  My three year old loved this too.  I'm sure I'll make this again and experiment with different fillings and spices.

I thought this recipe was great, but I must confess what I cooked was not exactly the original recipe.  I loved the idea of a popover topping.  What I ended up with was the original plus some cooked potatoes, frozen carrots and about a cup of frozen stew vegetables.  As for the batter, I didn't have curry as I'd thought, so substituted dry mustard and chives.  It still could have had more flavor but I will be happy to keep trying by adjusting the amounts and trying new ingredients (maybe in place of the potatoes).  Thanks, Roxanne, for a great, basic recipe I promise to try your way one of these meals. I'm sure it will have more flavor but I just felt I had to try more than onions and peppers the first time around!

The only problem I had was guessing the size pan to put it in, I made the wrong choice and put it in one too large. Next time I will try a pie pan.

This tasted fine, however it was definitely more of a frittata than a popover. Perhaps if some baking powder was added to the extra mixture.

The recipe doesn't state what size pan to use so I went with a 9" cake pan - a 10" Cast Iron skillet would have worked better.  The batter itself needs some salt - not a lot but without it the batter tastes pretty blah...  I used red peppers instead of green and followed the recipe as written.  This was just OK for us - nothing stunning but not bad either.  If I were to make this again I would start with a really hot cast iron skillet and into the hot oven.  It would probably have puffed a bit more.

This makes a good breakfast for low-carbers sick to death of scrambled eggs. Modifications: I used 1/2 cup LC bake mix instead of 3/4 cup flour which reduced total carbs by 57 g, doubled the green pepper and added 1 cup of mushrooms. This brought carbohydrates to 6.8 g/serving instead of 17! The flavor was pretty good, but it was quite salty, probably due to the ham I used. Kids weren't huge fans, but I'd definitely do it again -- it's VERY EASY and a nice break from plain eggs in the morning.

I couldn't convince my daughter to taste this, but my husband and I loved it!  It was super-quick 
and easy.  As suggested, it tasted great with chutney and I'm sure that it would be good
with some yogurt, too.  I'm going to forward the recipe to my mother, who is always 
looking for quick, easy recipes.  It's definitely going into meal-planning rotation at our
house!

Good and super-easy.  I couldn't taste the curry at all, but my husband said it was good as is.

I would make this again with the addition of brocalli, cheddar and delete the curry and green peppers

Combined reading of recipe and its reviews before trying it.  Agree with several reviewers that addition of vegetables enhances the recipe.  It is a basic for a variety of meat/vegetable combinations.

This was very good.  I used smoked turkey lunchmeat, which I diced, and I used about 2 tsp or so of curry, and it came out great!  Very easy.  I would like to try this with other fillings and seasonings as well.  Plenty of room for variation on this one...Thanks for the inspiring recipe, Roxanne!!!

I confess to a few modifications - I added chopped sauteed mushrooms to the ham cubes, and a little oregano, and a little smoked gruyere, cubed.  My partner liked the dish quite a bit, but I thought it somewhat mediocre.  Would be better as a brunch dish than a supper dish, I think - ended up sort of frittata like.

I used this for leftover Easter ham and it was pretty easy (although I've no idea how much "1 lb." of ham is since I have no scale in my kitchen).  It was quite tasty and was good as leftovers too.  Next time I may add some tomato.
