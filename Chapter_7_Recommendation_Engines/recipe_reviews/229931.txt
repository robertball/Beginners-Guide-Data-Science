I saved this recipe awhile back and finally made them yesterday for a Fathers Day gathering! I followed the recipe exactly! They were absolutely delicious and disappeared way to quickly! They were easy to make but the hard part is getting them started early enough to cook for 12 hours! We began sampling them about 1/2 hour ahead of time. They were practically gone when the 12 hour timer went off. There were 16 adults here and we fought over the last few! Next time I'll use 2 crockpots and double the recipe.  Everyone asked for the recipe and I will definitely be making these again and again and again! Thank you Melinda!

These would be great to serve with steak or over baked potatoes.  I almost think you could knock about 3 hours off the cooking time and I sort of wish that more of the bite from the wine came through, so when I make them again, I may add it in later or add more at time closer to serving.  It smelled so good in the first few hours and by the time the 12 hours was over, it was gone.  I did not think they were too salty as some other reviewers mentioned...I wondered if some may have used "garlic salt" instead of the "garlic powder" the recipe called for.  I would make it again, but might alter it just a bit next time for more flavor.  Thanks for sharing!

Oh my gosh! This is AWESOME. I cut the recipe in 1/2 but followed the recipe as provided. I started cooking this at 9:00 this morning.... but there's not going to be anything left at 9:00 tonight.  This is a new FAVORITE! :)

I really haven't made this yet but if it has mushrooms and a sauce, I'll love it. This is just to introduce those of you who are crying about the slow cooker and how you haven't got the time. Do you know the purpose of a slow cooker? You can actually work while cooking or as I do, you can sleep while cooking this. I will be putting this on around 10:00 in the evening and will wake up to great aroma and maybe even BREAKFAST if it smells great. By the way, in doing it overnight, unless the heavenly smell wakes you up, you are not noshing all day. When you wake up they'll all be there for your meal with plenty for guests!

I got a little lazy with it by boiling and then reduced the heat to medium and covered for about 20 minutes.  The only ingredient I changed was the dry red wine. Instead I used red wine vinegar.  I cut the recipe in 1/4 because I was only serving 2. I'm sure its better when you slow cook it for 12 hours, but ain't nobody got time for that!  Thanks for the inspiration!

I thought these were very salty (too much bouillon).  People left them on their plates.  I felt sad to see that as it was I brought to a big family Thanksgiving.

This was delicious, but I had to make a few changes out of necessity--I can't use alcohol in my food, so I substituted 2 tbsp. apple cider vinegar for the wine, and I added 1 tsp. of onion powder because it tasted like it "needed" something (perhaps due to the ACV substitution, so likely not the fault of the recipe) and it tasted wonderful.  The only thing I would change is to use less butter, as 1/2 a cup ended up being too much and made them a bit greasy for my taste, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  Next time I will use 1/4 cup and see how that goes.  Also, mine were done in the crock pot after about 7 hours on low rather than 12.  Cooking it for 12 hours would have been way overkill in my crock pot, so I would advise checking the texture after about 6 hours or so.  A delicious recipe that I would recommend and will very likely make again.

I used less butter (only used 2 tablespoons) to make these a bit healthier, and they were great! I may try them with more butter next time to see what the difference is like.

This is a great idea but for me personally it was really salty so just one of each bouillon cube beef/chicken added 2-cups of a basic German red (any would do I'm sure) and unsalted butter ...again that's just me but I could taste the wine and mushrooms better I like adding salt to taste thank you for sharing yummie

Turned out great! Carmelized onions 1st and added the rest of the ingredients. Used minced garlic and didn't have Worscesire sauce so I subbed in Hoisen to add an oriental flavor!! Cooked everything on high for 2 hours and then low for 3 more hours!!

Very easy and wows the crowd every time. The first time I made this the mushrooms didn't entirely fit into my crockpot, but I learned that they cook down very quickly. An easy side dish that can be made in advance. I tend to cut the butter in half, but that's my personal taste. Great with steak!

I enjoyed this recipe.  Have made it twice now.  Husband doesn't like dill, so used basil instead.  Guests loved it, served it warm in crock pot.

I didn't have 12 hours for the crock pot. Needed dinner in a couple of hours so fully lined a large edged flat pan with foil and mixed 1/2 the recipe onto it and cooked it at 400° a couple of hours, mixing a few times. Sensational yummy roasted mushrooms.

Super easy to make. Usually my crockpot is over flowing and I can't get the lid on. No worries-these cook down.  People see them and can't wait to grab some. I usually stand by the crockpot when people arrive to remind them that they can't eat straight from the crockpot or they burn their mouth :-)

I'm a horrible cook. Let's get that out there. But even I managed to make this, and it was actually complimented by my extended family (and that doesn't happen unless it really deserves it!). 10/10 would make again.

Been on this site for years and never left a review but let me tell you this deserves one.  OMG - so good.  The hardest part letting them cook 12 hours.  We were suppose to eat for dinner tonight, that would be 12 hours.  But they will not make it to the table - everyone keeps eating them.  THANK YOU so much for this recipe.  AMAZING!!!!

I added a sliced onion and some garlic cloves. Incredible! These are better than the steakhouses' around here. I did use more wine and let it simmer away to practically a syrup. My husband loved them.

It was one of the better mushroom recipes I’ve tried, but fairly salty. I like it with garlic bread to dip in the juice.

i will not make it again.  I followed the recipe but just got very salty floating mushrooms.  using boullion is not a great idea, they take in all the salt.  at the party i took them to they were not a success.

I followed the recipe to a tee.  They did not look like the picture!  I mean, there is nothing you can do wrong.  It's pretty simple.  No one cared for them.  I made cream of mushroom soup with the leftovers.

Yes I liked this recipe, but there was more juice than I had anticipated.  I think there was not enough heat in my crockpot. Next  time I will double the Worcestershire sauce and reduce the liquid, as mushrooms release their own while cooking. I can't wait to try these with a barbecued steak!!

I had to rate this before actually trying it, in order to ask a question.  The first photo looks like rosemary leaves are added.  Is that correct?

This was amazing!!! I took the extra mushroom broth (I had a lot of juice at the end) and used it to make risotto... so good! I also had some precooked chicken Italian sausage I chopped on top with some fresh parsley and Parmesan cheese... perfection. I did not alter the original recipe for the shrooms- it worked perfectly as is, I just wanted to use all that extra yummy broth

These mushrooms were definitely good, but not a Wow good.  I'd make again, but also look for other recipes.

Will be a keeper.  Didn't change a thing.  Broth came in very handy for a rib roast I had to put back in the oven after slicing.

Tastes great but did half the recipe since my 8 quart crockpot wouldn't fit any more than 2 pounds of mushrooms.
