This was almost perfect, but I would suggest the following modifications: Instead of the habaneros, which caused a lot of problems (to hands, eyes, and tongue), I would substitute 2 serranos. And also I would add 1/3 c. cream.

Wonderful recipe!  I did use the habanero pepper and loved it; DH and I like a little kick to our food.  I did tweak it a little, though -- we are  vegetarians so I subbed vegetable broth for the chicken broth.  I also boiled then pureed a potato and a few broccoli stalks to make it creamy without adding fat.  Also added a can of drained white cannelini beans to boost protein.  Made a yummy hearty meal with crusty wholegrain bread -- will definitely make this again!

Wow. Habeneros are HOT! If you want a little kick in your soup, use a 1/4 of a pepper. It won't look like much, but believe me, it will be enough. I used only 1 pepper (and was completely fooled by the small size). Holy cow, I can barely eat this soup it is so spicy. Completely burns going down.  Otherwise, very delicious. You can even add some cilantro and coconut water or milk for some Asian influence.

I was afraid of the habenero, so used a serrano instead.  The bit of heat does add to the dish, so I wouldn't eliminate the pepper...just choose one in line with your preference for spice.  I used an immersion blender to puree the soup.  I wasn't sure what my husband would think of this, but before I could ask what he thought he was getting seconds!

I thought this soup looked disgusting, tasted very bitter, and really wasnt worth the time i spent cooking and liquidising it all.

This was very tasty.  I think next time I will omit the pepper as it was a bit too hot for my husband.  Otherwise, it was perfect!

Nothing wrong with this, but nothing outstanding either.  Better as part of the meal -- would probably disappoint as the whole meal itself.

I didn't have  spinach so I used cut up Bok choy. added some small pasta and served with fresh buns. It was great. I'll make it again with spinach next time. Also, I added 1 TBSP of Kitchen Bouquet Browning sauce which has a bit of flavour.

Very tasty...but next time will eliminate the pepper flakes (had no habanero peppers) and added about 1 2/3 cups of mashed potatoes to make the puree a little more thick...

Does not look like the picture. Needs more flavor than the stock gives. Just strange and not good.
