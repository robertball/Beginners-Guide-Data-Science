The ice cream mix for this recipe is wonderful (I has some great, freshly picked tart cherries too) and I would keep that.  The problem for me is in the adding of cornstarch just prior to freezing.  I think this is an error in the writing of the recipe.  I went with it just for the sake of following the recipe as written (leaving out the optional liqueur) and was very disappointed by the chalky taste in the frozen product.  To add to the smoothness/creaminess of the ice cream, I think the cornstarch should be added to the mix as it is being heated, to activate the starch.  I would use the recipe for the mix again, adding the cornstarch as I just noted or leaving it out altogether.  The finished ice cream also remained somewhat soft (perhaps because of the problem with the cornstarch?) and there was no need to leave it on the counter prior to scooping.
