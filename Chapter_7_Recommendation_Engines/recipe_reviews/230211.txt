I used a very crisp pears, steam the carrots for about 8 minutes and then tossed the pears into the steamer and steamed them for just a few more minutes.  The amount of butter / glaze is over kill.  I scaled that way back, just enough to lightly coat the carrots and pears. The pears are naturally sweet as are the carrots, they just need a light coating of glaze. The cinnamon in the glaze is a nice touch.  Very good!

Much to labor intensive.  Carrots can be steamed for 5 minutes, and then you can throw in the Pears for another 5 minutes.  The recipe says simmer the butter/brown sugar part for 5 to 10 minutes. Ha! I didn't get to 5 minutes and the sauce was burnt.  Just simmer until the brown sugar dissolves......and combine.  After all this fooling around....my Easter dish "experiment" was a disaster. But I'll try the recipe again MY WAY!

Very good; I'm just not sure why the pears are needed... I don't like pears, so I left them out, and followed the rest of the ingredients.  Also, I don't have a steamer, and I like my carrots cooked through, so I just boiled some carrot slices for about 7 minutes, drained them and set the carrots aside.  Then I mixed the rest of the ingredients together in the melted butter - once it was all combined well, I added back in the carrots until they were well-coated.  They were fantastic, and very close to what I was looking for, but I'm only giving this 4 stars because, like another reviewer, I thought the directions were much too complicated for something that didn't need to be.  Thanks for sharing!

I had carrots and I had pears so I went for it.  Glad I did.  It is very hard to find recipes that the whole family liked, but this one was liked by 8 out of 8 at the Easter table.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because I save that for the "really really gotta try this" recipes. This is a good safe vegetable side dish with just a little wow factor.   As a side note: It seemed like you may not need all of the glaze. Flavor is right, just might be good with a little less.

With the directions as written, this never forms a glaze.  The butter and brown sugar donâ€™t combine even after the sugar melts.  I googled what could have gone wrong and all the pundits mention that you have to have an additional liquid, such as water or juice in order for everything to combine and form a glaze.  I will definitely try again though because the flavor was terrific.  The pears in with the carrots was an inspired idea and really fantastic.

I used brown sugar only and cut it in half. The natural sweetness of the carrots and pears was enough.It was a hit at my sons house on Christmas Day! Apparently my daughter in-law says I'll be making it again!

Like always, I read the reviews before making this dish, and followed most of the recommendations. I steamed the pears but boiled 3 lbs baby carrots. I cut 4 tbsp butter out of the recipe. I forgot brown sugar at the store so substituted with coconut sugar. I learned the hard way coconut sugar doesn't dissolve well. The recipe was still sweet, but it was a mix of butter and sugar, not a real glaze. Also I tweaked it by using about 1 tbsp honey and 3 tbsp sugar. I made this for an early Friendsgiving with very 'polite' reviews. I thought this recipe sounded so good! I went home and added a little salt to my leftover carrots, such a difference! I'm making this again today for Thanksgiving, and I'm definitely adding 1/2 tsp to 1 tsp salt to this dish. I'm also leaving out the pears, they didn't add much to the dish the first time, which will make the 1 stick of butter I have left just the right amount.

I was looking for a new recipe for carrots, as I am not an inventive cook.  I thought the combination of carrots and pears sounded interesting.  My family raved about them!  They will be made at our house again!!!

Way less time spent steaming pears, more for carrots. Between the brown sugar and honey, I had crispy bits of candy mixed in. Cut one or the other?
