Mmmmmm! Made a few changes. Along with the ingredients I also added some garlic powder, a can of diced green chiles and a large potato diced up very finely. Then I simmered the meat mixture on the stove for about 30 minutes to let the flavors really infuse. Instead of biscuits I used two boxes of good old Jiffy Cornbread batter (prepared according to directions) and spread it on the bottom of the pan. Then I spooned the meat mixture on top and added the cheese. Cooked for 40 minutes. This is wonderful! So easy to prepare and good comfort food. Thanks!

This was really good! I did sub 2 boxes of Jiffy Cornbread mix (prepared as per box) for the biscuits.  I used Green Giant Mexican Style corn. I also added chopped chili peppers,cumin, and garlic powder to the recipe, kept everything else as is.  Def will make again.

This recipe was really easy however I did make some changes to the formula. I used shredded chicken instead of beef, omited the chili beans, and used a can of french onion soup to cook the chicken in prior to shredding. Also used a bag variation of Bisquick biscuits (garlic/cheese) instead of pre-mades. We barely had enough for leftovers!!!

Very good!  I used ground turkey, added carrots, and Jiffy cornbread mix(instead of biscuit dough)on top, no cheese.  Seasoned with cumin and chili powder.

I used diced chicken vs ground beef just because that is what I had thawed.  I subbed in a can of Rotel for the regular can of chopped tomatoes since I love the flavor/spice but I did totally leave out the ketchup.  I just didnâ€™t think it belonged for my taste.  Very good!  I will make this again!!  Thank you for a great recipe!

Very tasty.  Made it in large muffin tins and it came out great. (just be sure not to overfill as biscuit on bottom will expand)  Note to self: Use 2 teaspoons cumin instead of chili powder, 2 lb ground beef, one pack of sazon to season meat while cooking, sofrito (about 4 Tbs.) instead of ketchup and rotel in place of diced tomatoes.

This was soooo YUMMY!!  I did make a few changes but nothing too crazy it would alter it all that much: I made the ground beef  added some spices, added canned black beans ( instead of Chili... cause I did not have any ) canned corn and Rotel tomatoes with green chillis ( instead of the chopped tomatoes ) and still added the canned tomato sauce.  I did not add the biscuits as bottom crust I added corn bread as a Top crust, ( cause honestly I did not read it correctly and was cooking in a hurry) But it was pretty close to one of the best casserole dishes I have  made!!   maybe next time I'll make it as it says to, Chili beans sound yummy too! Kids love it!!  with a dollop of Sour cream Oh So Good!!  KEEPER!!

Biscuits were still doughy after 25 minutes, but cheese was browned.

Made this for dinner tonight, and it was great!  Nothing fancy, but super quick and easy...definitely good on a cold night (the few we have in Florida!).  I varied just a little bit after reading other reviews - substituted a can of diced tomatoes and green chiles for the chopped tomatoes, added a little garlic powder, cumin, and a touch of cayenne.  We will most definitely be keeping this recipe on hand, thanks for sharing!

Tasty dish and quick to make. I did make some changes as I wanted more of an Italian-style dish. Check out my custom version.

My change was minor, but I used my mother's way of topping the tamale pie with Jiffy cornbread mix. Baked till it was brown on top, then sprinkled with grated cheese. Tasted great. (I didn't trust the biscuits to get done all the way through and thought they might be soggy from the sauce if they did.)

yummy but we don't have bisquits or jiffy cornbread mix here in France so, I just made some quick-cook polenta instead and upped the seasoning with more garlic and chillies.

Best use of leftovers!!! I lined my pan wth lefotover corm muffins crushed. Then used leftover diced pork loin, frozen corn, and salsa with onions , white beans, tomatoes. Added leftover polenta and sliced it on top then cheese... This could be made with chicken turkey pork or ground beef. I'm saving this one!!! Happy mom

I made multiple changes but the end result was wonderful (and still easy)!  I changed the tomato sauce to 15 oz., eliminated the chili beans because my family doesn't like them, put in 2 tsp. of garlic powder and 1 tsp. of cumin, increased the chili powder to 3 Tbsp. and used 1 box of cornbread mix (large) instead of the biscuits and corn meal.  You can choose sweet or nonsweet cornbread, to your liking.  I put the cheddar cheese on at the very end so as not to brown it too much.  All in all, excellent!
