This turned out really well.  I followed the suggestions of another reviewer and  used 1 cup of unsweetened apple sauce and 1/3 cup of oil instead of the full amount of oil, and the cake turned out moist and delicious.  I halved the sugar -- I think two cups would have been too much!  Indeed, the cake was still sweet, and I feel that I could have reduced the sugar even more, especially since we used cream cheese frosting.  This makes quite a lot of cake; in the future I may make halve the recipe and bake it in a loaf pan for our small family.  We served seven people and still ended up with leftovers for ten more!

Wow... i've been using this recipe for about a year now and it is awesome, the only changes I make are using 1 cup applesauce and 1/3 cup oil, and i use 2 tablespoons of cinnamon instead of teaspoons :P... just fantastic :D

I made this cake for a big family party and can honestly say I've never received so many compliments for any cake I've made before, and I've made quite a few! I stuck faithfully to the given recipe, but I would caution that it took about 20 minutes longer to cook, so look carefully at it before taking it out of the oven - it will be very sticky in the middle, but shouldn't wobble!

This was so moist and delicious!  I got rave reviews!  I made a few modifications to lighten it up a bit.  I substituted 1 cup of the oil with applesauce and used 2/3 cup of whole wheat flour for the white flour.  I also decreased the sugar by 1/2 a cup and think I will take even more out next time.  It was plenty sweet, especially with the applesauce and the cream cheese frosting.  This is definitely a keeper recipe!

I liked the flavor of this cake, but there is too much oil in it.  The texture was moist, but too oily.  The cinnamon was just the right amount and the cake wasn't too sweet.  I'll make it again, but I am going to put in about half the amount of the oil.

I cut this recipe in half in order to make a single layer cake (in a round 8 inch pan).  It worked out really well, I still followed what others said by cutting out some of the oil and substituting it with applesauce..I did about half and half.  I also added in some nutmeg and cloves.  If you do cut this recipe in half though you just have to remember to watch the baking time.. instead of 40-45 minutes, you only need about 30-35.    
I frosted the cake with cream cheese frosting, covered the sides with walnuts, dusted it with a little cinnamon and everyone loved it!

Im so glad i came upon this recipe, I looked long and hard for one that i would be able to reduce easily and that didnt have any pineapple! Ill definitely use this one again.

Taking advice from everyone else, I also used 1 cup applesauce and 1/3 cup oil. I didn't use the nuts (too many people with allergies), but I didn't even notice they were missing. I also used a bit of pumpkin pie spice in addition to the cinnamon. Yum! This makes a great cake, and it is also perfect for cupcakes for a picnic.

Best carrot cake!! Super moist! My Mom uses this recipe and it is delish! I use it now too, except I modified it a bit to make healthier. Use 1 cup no sugar added applesauce and 1/3 c oil (sometimes substitute all applesauce), 1 c sugar & 1 c splenda and it tastes just as good as reg. recipe. NO walnuts though, because we dont like them!
Use crm cheese frosting from site!

EXCELLENT!  This is moist, sweet and delicious.  We made it without the nuts (allergic child) and it was a huge hit.  Really delicious.

Turned out nice and moist. I cut the recipe in half and cooked in an 8x8 pan for about 50 minutes. Left out the walnuts, topped with Brown Sugar Cream Cheese Frosting from this site. Thanks for a simple recipe! UPDATE: Made this again, turning them into muffins. Mini muffins took about 15 minutes, regular sized ones took about 25.

As the baker, this cake came together very easily - I made no changes except I think I had less than 4 cups carrot (probably closer to 3 cups) and I used pecans instead of walnuts. I made it in two 8-inch round pans and it took a bit more than 40 minutes to bake, so I think a 9x13 would need more than the 40-45 mins baking time indicated. I'm not a carrot cake fan myself, but I made it for my mom for Mother's Day and she and everyone else who had a piece raved about it. I frosted it with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site.

Thank you for this recipe.  This cake XI was delicious. I took some advice from the other reviews and cut down the oil by using 1/3 cup oil and 1 cup Unsweetened Apple Sauce.  Added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and 1 tsp of vanilla.  To give it a kick I added 1/2 cup of unsweetened coconut flakes which add even more texture to the cake.  We  omitted frosting it as we're trying to cut down on calories.  It turned out perfectly moist and I grated my carrots using a Cuisinart shredding blade and the carrots did not require any draining at all.  This cake was a good as some of the ones I've bought in gourmet shops, so I really enjoyed making this one and it was a hit.  I'll make it again for sure.  Thanks.

This is the first carrot cake I've made from scratch, & the batter was so very thick and so full of carrots that I wasn't sure what to expect.  After the first bite, and a room full of "wow"'s, I realized the abundance of carrots made the cake so moist it literally melted in my mouth!  Awesome recipe!

I don't leave reviews often, but had to leave one for this recipe. It is simple, quick, and DELICIOUS! Someone bought it to an event and after tasting it, me and other moms were hounding the person who made it for the recipe and I made it as soon as I got home that day. Only thing she did differently was reduce the sugar to 1 3/4 cup and omit walnuts. I personally think it's good even without a cream cheese topping.  

Recipe is for a 9x13 pan, I used a 8x8 then used the remaining batter for cupcakes.

I give this 5 stars even though I never tasted it.  I made if for my husband to take to work and none came home.  Rave reviews.  I used 1 cup of sugar, and instead of all that oil 1 cup of applesauce and 1/4 cup of oil.  Turned out just fine!!

This was a very yummy carrot cake. The only problem was the mushyness of it. It was WAY TOO gooey... i thought maybe it was undercooked, so i shoved it back in the oven, only to find that it wasn't getting any firmer.  Don't get me wrong, the taste was absolutely delightful, but it definitely needs less of something... perhaps the oil (which i used half oil and half margarine).... I don't know. Taste was there.... texture wasn't all that. Again... Yummy, though.

I made this into muffins and the only change I made was to use one cup whole wheat and one cup white flour. They are pretty bland and the texture is kinda weird. Won't be making them again.

I made this today for my mother's birthday.  I followed some other reviewer's suggestion by using 1 cup applesauce and 1/3 cup oil, 1 cup sugar, and added a pinch of nutmeg.  The flavor was fabulous but the cake was a little on the heavy side.  I will definitely make it again but will play with the oil to applesauce ratio. 

 I made this again using less than 1 cup oil (I had no applesauce) and it turned out great again. I used brown sugar and white.   My almost 2 year old is tearing it up as I type.:-)

YUM!  I halved the recipe and used applesauce and less oil, as suggested by other reviewers.  I also added half of a ripe banana and a little extra cinnamon.  The cake turned out moist and delicious!  (I didn't add frosting, deciding to just eat it like a bread rather than a cake and to save some calories.)

So I didn't like this when it first came out. I added some cream cheese frosting and let it sit for day and it was better.  It was too moist for me at first and I don't think it was because it was undercooked. It's possible I messed up my measurements (I have kids and was multitasking) but I am not new to baking, so it's weird that I would have.  I did use 1 cup of applesauce and only 1/3 cup of oil and did not add the walnuts.  I think I'll try it again soon though.

Wan't moist and didn't have enough flavor. I guess if you like the blander flavor, but I would add some spice to it next time.

I DESPISE carrot cake, but this was the best cake I ever had!!! I made it involuntarily for school, but when I tasted the batter, I was in HEAVEN! It was about an hour before I cleaned up because I was so busy licking the bowl and the spoons!

This was the 1st recipe I tried on this site, and let me tell you it came out great. It was the first cake I ever done from scratch as well. it listed that you need about 8 carrots I thin you need about 10 I only got about 3 1/2 cups from 8 carrots.  I will be making this again and again in the future. Bob

Fantastic recipe!!  It is easy and worth the time to shred the carrots fresh.  The cake came out incredibly moist and wonderful flavour.  This one is a keeper!

Finally a real Carrot Cake recipe! Just like the one my mother had but lost. My husband prefers a Butter Cream frosting for carrot cake. It tastes better than the traditional cream cheese frosting.
I find the best cakes do not need frosting at all!
My husband says this is the best carrot cake!
Very easy to make with normal ingredients. Don't care for recipes calling for pineapple or can carrots.
Another winner!

This cake was awesome! It used lots of the extra carrots I had around. The only thing I did differently was replace 1cup of the oil with applesauce.

Delicious carrot cake! It is super-duper moist!! What is great is that since carrots already have a lot of moisture, you can substitute applesauce for the oil to make it healthier. I also sprinkled in ground cloves, ground nutmeg, and allspice to give it more spice :)

I made this carrot cake tonight...I am on my first piece and going for my second in a minute. I cut this recipe in half exactly. The only thing I did different was to throw in a bit more cinnamon....probably a tsp and a half, and about a tsp of nutmeg. I used raisins instead of nuts. Oh... i also used only one half cup of oil! I think it turned out really nice tasting! I iced it with a cream cheese icing recipe on this site! Really nice tasting cake!

Loved it.   Did make a few changes. Substituted apple sauce for most of the oil. Swapped 1/2 the sugar to brown. And doubled the cinnamon.   Also only used 3 cups of grated carrots (because I ran out of carrots)     Came out amazing though.

I made this for my brother's birthday and it was a huge success.  Here are my changes:  I used 1 c brown sugar and 1 c white.  Only 1/2 c oil.  1 c crushed pineapple, 1/2 t nutmeg and 1/4 t ginger.  Also, I didn't really measure the carrots, but it was between 2-4 cups.  This doesn't rise much, but it is super moist and flavorful and not too heavy.

This IS the best carrot cake EVER!  Very moist and very delicious!   I made my own cream cheese frosting to top it:  2 blocks of cream cheese, 4T cream, 2 cups confectioners sugar. (I found this on this website as well).

I just made this carrot cake a bit ago and I must say it is amazing! I did not use walnuts in the cake, but I did top it with walnuts, and it still came out very moist and tasty. The only thing is it took an hour to cook, but everybody's oven is a bit different. A great recipe, thanks for sharing it!

I made this cake with a couple of changes (1c applesauce + 1/3 oil, and I only used about half the amount of sugar called for in the recipe) and it was absolutely beautiful.  Moist, sweet, and delicious.  Just a word of caution for anyone who uses the Metric conversion: I didn't need anywhere NEAR 400g of grated carrots to make up the 4 cups.  I used two large carrots and that was more than enough.

I just made this cake for the 2nd time.  If you love carrot cake, try this one.  The only modification I made is I did bake it for an additional 5 minutes and put an extra shake of cinnamon in the recipe.....I used the recipe for Cream Cheese Frosting II which was the absolute BEST cream cheese frosting I ever tried.  Enjoy!!

i love this recipe and so do all of my guests.  i top it with a crumb topping instead of frosting when i use it as a cake, or i often don't top it at all and serve it as a side dish.  i never thought i could like carrot cake, but this recipe changed my view!

This wasn't as spicy or as dense as I'd hoped, but it was still good, and a cinch to make. I substituted half the oil for applesauce. I just might try another recipe next time, but I will keep this in the recipe box.

My family loved this carrot cake!  My husband is a huge fan, and said that it was a great recipe.  I liked the fact that it didn't use jars of baby food carrots, but instead used fresh, grated carrots.  It was very moist and rich.  The only thing I changed was that I added 1 teaspoon of allspice, to give it more of a spice cake flavor.  I will definately use the recipe again.  It's earned a permanent spot in my recipe box!

This is by far the best carrot cake recipe I've ever tried, and the best carrot cake I've ever eaten. I made it for a family dinner in which I hosted my in-laws, and I they could not get over how yummy, moist and rich this cake was. Thanks very much for this terrific recipe, I'll definately be making it often.

This recipe made a deliciious, moist carrot cake.  I live at high altitude and added a bit
of flour to compensate; I also used pecans instead of walnuts.  This recipe will
quickly become a family favorite!

I made this for our Easter brunch.  It was easy for us to grate 4 cups of carrots using our mini-chopper.  This cake was moist and delicious- even to non-fans of carrot cake!

I cut the recipe in half and poured into cupcake tins, it made exactly 12. Sadly though I found them flat (not a huge deal) and really oily (bigger  deal). I definitely could not serve them to anyone without frosting becaue they looked horrid, even with they don't look nice. But they tasted good, so I'm not entirely disappointed. I did substitute half coconut oil for the vegetable oil which may have made the difference, which is why I didn't give a lower rating. I realize this is a cake recipe and not a cupcake recipe but essentially it's the same thing just a different sized pan. I see now with reading the other reviews that though many people rate it well, they also adjust the oil...which isn't fair.

I had never made a homemade carrot cake before tonight.  Now I will never go back!  Everyone in my bunko group loved this and were quite impressed with me.  The only thing I changed was adding less oil -- I probably used only 1/3 cup, and the cake was still plenty moist and delicious. Thank you for sharing the recipe,

This Recipe was super quick Super easy .. Only thing I cut the sugar by 1/2 cup & brought the oil down by 1/3 Cup .. I added No nuts For a Smoother Bite and I'd definitely advise that when adding the wet ingredients to the dry make sure to do it slowly and gradually to avoid lumpy batter .. enjoy .

Wow..never been a big fan of carrot cake, but this recipe is amazing….  I only used 1/4 cup of oil the rest apple sauce but other than that, I made it as written.  This recipe has made me known as the cake baking queen at work - try it - you won't be disappointed!

lovely moist cake.. as others advised I cut the oil to one cup. I used only 1 tsp of cinnamon and omitted the walnuts for the kids. I split it between two smaller square tins and they were ready in 30-35 mins. I also used the cream cheese frosting recommended by others and from this site.

Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about how good it was! I followed others suggestions and used 2 tablespoons of cinnamon and then used one cup of unsweetened applesauce and 1/3 cup of oil. I used two 9 inch round pans and baked for about 40 minutes! Soooo good!

A fabulous carrot cake recipe: great flavor and texture.  I loved that it was not too sweet.  I made cupcakes reducing the baking time by about five minutes.   I frosted them with Cream Cheese Frosting II which was also a great recipe.  Yummy.

Very good!  This cake has great flavor and is very moist.  Personally, I think the recipe calls for too much oil - the only reason I didn't give a full five stars.  I cut the oil down to 3/4 cup and the cake was still soooo moist.  I also added a bit more spice (some ginger and nutmeg) along with the cinnamon.  I will always use this recipe (with modifications).

this was definitely a super good recipe. but i totally messed mine up. make sure you keep an eye on it if you're making mini cupcakes - they'll obv be done waaay faster. also, someone said to double the cinnamon,... which i did bc i love cinnamon, but it just became a spice cake at that point. still good but why did i grate so many carrots if i didnt taste them? also, 1 bag of carrots was enough for 4 cups, unpacked cups.

WOW!  This cake is EXCELLENT!!  I made it for my husband's birthday today and it was a hit with everyone!  I did cut the sugar in half as suggested and used 1 cup of apple sauce and a 1/3 cup of oil instead of 1 1/3 cups of oil.  I also added some raisins and we all liked the crunchiness of the walnuts!  I will make this recipe again and again!  My husband actually said "make sure you don't lose this recipe!"

I made this cake last night and it was exceptionally easy!  It turned out moist and tasty...even to my guy who is not a carrot cake fan!  I altered the recipe slightly: 1) I ran out of oil so I had to use a little shortening to make the amount of oil required. 2) I didn't have any chopped walnuts so I added 3/4 cup raisins instead - it was a good choice!  I will definitely make this one again.  When I do, I will also add a bit more spice. Only 2 teaspoons of ground cinnamon was simply not enough for my taste...I'm thinking some nutmeg, allspice or something along those lines.  And as far as the cream cheese frosting, I found a recipe here on AllRecipes.com (included in another carrot cake recipe I found :) and it was the cream cheese frosting recipe I've been looking for since I started cooking!  It was quick, easy and delicious and the recipe makes quite a bit extra to be used on other baked goods.

I made this cake for my boyfriend's birthday, and it came out perfectly. I got nothing but compliment for it. I'd NEVER made a carrot cake from scratch before, so I was a little nervous, but I followed the recipe to the letter, except I did substitute a cup of oil for apple sauce as someone suggested. To my delight, the apple sauce didn't affect the flavor or texture of the cake at all.

Amazingggg carrot cake. I made no changes except used MUCH less carrots and no walnuts because of lack of ingredients. The top and sides sort of crystalized into a sugary crust. I loved it! I frosted it with Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting from this website. The only problem was that if I hadn't frosted it, it would look horrible. It caved in in the middle. I have no idea why this happened or if it was because of some error that I did but it looked really bad. (Thankfully it looked fine when I frosted it and tasted amazing!)  Next time, will make with walnuts :)

Abolutely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except for the oil. I used 1/2 c Vegetable oil and applesauce for the remainder of the measurement. I baked this in 2 eight-inch round cake pans lined with parchment paper for exactly 40min and it was perfectly cooked (i was really worried about it being done). I will definitely make this again!

Best carrot cake I've ever made.  I cut the veg. oil down to 1/3 cup, and added 1 cup unsweetened applesauce instead.  The cake came out moist and delicious.  I also added maybe a teaspoon of ginger along with the cinnamon.  My family didn't want to stop at one piece!

I just got the cake out of the oven and they look great! Instead of using a 9x13 pan I used two round 9 inch pans and baked it for 30 minutes. The smell is amazing! Oh and I also left out the walnuts.

This is a very heavy and dense cake.  Not the recipe for those looking for a lighter and healthier cake.  I made this for a life long carrot cake lover and was told it was the BEST carrot cake she ever tasted!  I wasn't a huge fan of carrot cakes until I tasted this and I was hooked.

I made this for someone's bday whose favorite is carrot cake.  I've never liked carrot cake but I actually liked this.  I did half applesauce/salflower oil and added just a little nutmeg.  I covered it up with foil as soon as it came out of the oven to retain all the moisture and I loved how it was so orange from all the carrots.  Update-I stil had carrots left over so decided to make a loaf (i halved the rcipe)for my dad using the same recipe.  I wanted to make it healthier so I subbed all applesauce, used whole wheat flour, 1/2 brown sugar, 1tsp vanilla, and a generous dose of cinnamon and nutmeg.  When it was almost done I poked holes on the top and drizzled 2 tsp of melted butter with cinnamon on top.  I actually liked it better with the whole wheat flour.

The carrot cake was delicious! The recipe made more that expected and the cake rose above the pan but did not fall over. Fantastic!!
Btw, forgot to add this: I was short 1 egg so I substituted it for about 1/4 a cup of veg. oil; also, I like brown sugar better, so I put 1 cup of white sugar and 1 of brown sugar and the cake turned out puffy inside and crispy/caramelly on the outside ^_^ great cake!!

This is a good recipe. I used only 1 1/2 cups of sugar coupled with the 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce that others recommended and it was very sweet. Also not as spicy as I am used to with carrot cake and since it was very sweet I kept adding a lot more cinammon until I got more of that spice taste and less of the sweetness. Also added a little ginger, nutmeg and ground clove. I used this for cupcakes and they did not take long to cook at all. When they cooled they were very moist and not gooey. Great recipe! Topped with the cream cheese icing on this site that calls for 2 packages of cream cheese these cupcakes taste wonderful.

My first attempt at a carrot cake, so I'm not deducting any points for anything I might have done wrong. This is delicious, I'm almost regretting that I put on the frosting, because in the end it stole away from the taste. If I were to make a carrot cake again, this would be my recipe.

This is the best carrot cake I've ever made.  It has replaced my mom's recipe which I always felt was too dry. It was so easy, too. I actually like it without the frosting because it's so moist.

this was my first carrot cake ever, it came out ok.  i used baby carrots (that was a lot of grating, thank God for kids huh) and added raisons, i think i made the cake to think because it took a long time to cook and then the bottom was a little over done but for my first try it was pritty good will try this recipe again.

This cake is awesome.  I frost with a basic cream cheese/powdered sugar frosting.  I also put my walnuts through the salad shooter to it really finely graded.  It makes a wonderful dense filling cake.  Thanks for the great recipe.  It will be the only carrot cake in my recipe box!

Really great recipe.  The cake turned out really moist and delicious!! However I did add about a half teaspoon of Allspice and a half teaspoon of nutmeg and I used pecans instead of walnuts.  Wanted to add raisins but forgot them when I was in the store!!  will definately keep this one in rotation!

This cake was delicious!  My family loves it and it was a wonderful way to use carrots from our garden.  We made Cream Cheese Frosting II, also found on this site, and it complimented the cake beautifully.  I had to adjust the cooking time a little bit to about 55 minutes and it turned out perfect.  Thanx so much for this recipe.  Its a keeper.

Great carrot cake!!!  I didn't change a thing.  My son requested it for his birthday cake, and everyone adored it.  I liked how the calories for this cake weren't as horrendous as in some of the other cakes.  And it was very moist and tender.  I frosted it with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site, and it was a hit!!  Didn't change a thing, and this will be the recipe I use for carrot cake from now on.  Thanks Michele!

Pretty good! But too crumbly and not as moist as I like. Will follow recipe specs re 11/3 cups of  veggie oil next time; instead of cutting back on oil as so many reviewers suggested. Cut back cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp  & added a generous pinch of ground cloves & ground ginger, 1/3 cup crushed fresh pineapple, 3/4 cup raisins, for richer carroty taste. We can’t have & don’t like nuts in cakes, so no nuts. Can substitute unsweetened coconut flakes for texture and flavour. Great taste and not too sweet. Will make again with these adjustments.

Super good. Stayed moist for days. I used 2 tablespoons cinnamon instead of 2 teaspoons also added a can of pineapple tidbits which I strained first. 

I doubled the recipie I had lots of shredded carrots from my garden in my freezer. It made 24 cupcakes and 4 loaf cakes.  Topped it all with cream chz frosting. So delicious.

I marked this one "Outstanding!" I cut the sugar quantity in half, and replaced 1/3 cup of oil with peach butter. It made two 8" layers and took an hour to bake.

Oh Gosh!  I must have done something wrong, but this cake rose way too much and over-flowed the pan!  I used exactly the amount of powder and soda it called for.

Also, sooo oily.  I think you could get away with half the amount of oil.

I used 1 cup sugar and 1 cup splenda instead of the full amount of sugar. I also used 1 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/3 cup oil instead of the full oil. Absolutely  delicious and moist!

I really liked this cake and it was very easy to make by following the recipe. It has a different texture than the generational passed-down recipe for carrot cake I have used in the past in that it was not as dense and was more 'cake-like'. In my books, it was a toss-up depending on your preference of texture.  The only modification I made was to extend the cooking time to 50-52 minutes. Depending on your oven, do the clean toothpick test or by 'patting' the top for doneness at the 40-45 minute mark.

Straightforward, classic delicious Carrot cake recipe. Very moist. Have tried many carrot cake recipes and this is the best (no pineapple or other ingredients not in traditional carrot cake) Its going to be my go-to recipe. It was the only cake that was ALL gone on Easter!

This was the best cake I have made in the recent past. I followed the recipe and went with the applesauce /oil combo (1 cup applesauce and 1/3 cup oil) as suggested by so many reviewers. I also added a teaspoon of allspice and cut the sugar to 1 1/3 cups. It turned out better than I expected.

I only used 3/4 cup vegetable oil and it came out great!  Everyone loved it.  It  was very moist and flavorful.  I omitted the nuts and raisins and I topped it with cream cheese frosting.

I cooked it in two 9"round pans and it took 45 min to cook.

I'm not a huge fan of carrot cake until NOW! Made some modifications based on someone's request (this was a Birthday cake request) decreased the sugar, only used 1/3 of what it called for, upped the carrots by 1 cup and it was RIDICULOUS! So moist and delicious!!!! Topped it off with cream cheese frosting, but I tell ya, it didn't need anything! I could have eaten 1/2 of it myself! GREAT recipe!!!

I made this with half veg. oil and half applesauce only because I ran out of oil. It was very moist and had that rich carrot cake flavor! I made a half size in an 8 x 8 and cooked it for 45 minutes. This worked perfect for our small family of 3 for a birthday cake!

I made this recipe recently but had trouble applying the frosting because the cake was so soft. It came apart as I tried to put the frosting on. I adjusted the recipe by reducing by one egg and 1/3 cup of vegetable oil. My second iteration was more solid and was much easier to apply frosting to. I've gotten rave reviews from several people and enjoy how it tastes myself.

Great recipe! Easy, no nonsense, just what I had in mind to satisfy my hankering for carrot cake. I cut it in half, added dried cranberries, and baked it in an 8 x 8 in. Pyrex dish. Lovely!

Super moist! It is the first carrot cake I ever made. I do not care for carrot cake that much and the ones I tried so far were all blah and dry but since hubby likes it and I had carrots left that were about to go bad, I decided to give it a try. Really yummy. Might try the idea with substituting apple sauce for part of the oil next time.

This is just an awesome cake! I made 1/2 a recipe so we would have just one layer for a birthday cake for a 2 year old - big ,big hit with baby and adults alike.   I have a carrot cake that everyone loves that I've made for years, and is a lot more work than this one, but I have to say this is the only one I'll be making from now on!.  I substitured applesauce for 1/2 cup of the oil (I would have used all applesauce in equal parts as a substitute for the oil as I always do,  but all I had on hand was one individual 1/2 cup portion).  I did use a little more cinnamon, because we love cinnamon, but no other changes.  It took a little longer than directed to bake, but that's not ususual for my stove, even though the temp checks out accurately it's just a slightly slow oven, and this is a very moist cake.  For the one layer I made 1/4 of a cream cheese frosting recipe, and it was more than enough to cover the top of the one layer.

Very easy-to-make recipe that was just what a carrot cake should be.  As is usually the case with carrot cake recipes, I had to bake this about 10 minutes longer than called for to avoid it being too moist.  Was gone in no time from my office Christmas party.  Highly recommended!!!

My 16 year old son made this and followed it exactly... no subs. We enjoyed it but I have had better. I found it too oily. The reason we picked this one is because we had no butter so needed a recipe that used oil. So it served it's need. 4 stars for taste and simplicity.

I used coconut oil and cooked carrots until soft since I am unable to shred 4 cups of carrots. I reduced cooked carrots to 3 (three) cups roughly mashed. I add a small can rinsed crushed pineapple rinsed drained and moisture removed. I use turbine sugar for baking also 2 teas. Vanilla. Becomes a breakfast cake without frosting. I had a similar recipe but now I found this is closest to the other and was my favorite carrot cake. ??

Moist sweet and delicious! Perfect amount of carrots! 4 cups looks like a lot but do not skimp! The walnuts added the perfect texture, I even added a little extra. This cake does not need frosting!!!

I used applesauce and oil as others suggested. It sunk in the center and the carrots all went to the bottom( maybe if I mix them with a little flour next time) It did taste good though. I frosted it with a brown sugar cream cheese frosting, yum, sort of caramel tasting.

I followed the directions but added a cup of dried cranberries. It turned out more like a coffee cake to me rather than the old traditional carrot cake I was raised with. It tasted great. I did not frost it.

Only took 35 minutes to bake for me; omitted nuts.  THE best carrot cake Ever!  Simple to make, light in texture and very carrot-y.   Just a simple cream cheese frosting and you are done!

Flavor was great.  I'll not use so much oil next time and substitute with unsweetened applesauce.  I live at a high altitude and didn't add extra flour.  It fell in the middle a lot.  Any ideas out there.

I never made carrot cake before so I thought I'd try this recipe. In my opinion I just tastes like cake with carrots in it and not proper carrot cake (nice moist cake though). If you want proper carrot cake I'd suggest adding some nutmeg

Everyone raves about how moist this cake is! I substitute an equal amount of unsweetened applesauce for the oil to make it feel like I'm eating healthier.

Whoa. What an oily mess. Taste was pretty good but geez the oil soaked my cupcake papers. This recipe could be a winner if you sub half the oil with milk or applesauce.

Overall this is a fabulous cake ,but I did make a few changes.  The changes I made was in using raw sugar instead of white sugar and the reason for this is all euoropean recipes call for demerra sugar.  The other change was adding 1/2 tsp of ginger.  With these 2 changes I would give the cake a 5 star rating.

It has a great taste, and my daughter likes it for breakfast.  I tried making it into cupcakes, and used some in a small pan for a cake.  I agree with others that it's a little too oily, so if I make it again, I'll be using the applesauce.  However, I was trying to make this for a client, and it will not be shared because every cupcake as well as the cake all collapsed!  The edges turned kind of crispy like a cookie, but not one I will be taking anywhere...  Ever!

It is good! I took the advice of previous comments and put 1 cup of applesauce and 1/3 cup of oil, but it took a lot of time baking way more than stated, it took almost 25 min more..... Overall, I am pleased with the results.

As many of the other folks did, I subbed 1 cup of applesauce for one cup of the oil.  The cake was delicious, moist and very popular with my family and friends.

An amazing cake made with simple ingredients found in your pantry.  I substituted most of the oil for unsweetened applesauce, reduced the amount of sugar by a bit (it was still plenty sweet), increased the amount of cinnamon and added a bit of nutmeg.  It was delicious.  I will definitely make it again.

I loved the recipe I used that 
Recipe to make carrot cupcakes
They were really good because 
The texture of the batter
Was light and fluffy 
Which made them the 
Cupcakes great

It was ok, but not what I wanted. I followed the recipe step by step but it came out too spongy. I wanted the batter to come out heavier, dense.

This was a fantastic recipe.  I used all apple sauce instead of any oil at all(I was out of oil), also I used all brown sugar (out of white sugar).  I was a little worried about all the changes, I like to try a recipe the original way first, this turned out great!  Used "cream cheese frosting II recipe", total winner.

This was outstanding!  For frosting I used 12 oz. cream cheese, 1 stick of butter,4 cups conf. sugar, 1 TBS. good vanilla, and a pinch of salt.  Heavenly!

I was disappointed n this recipe. Too dry of a cake, could taste the oil, baking time overbaked it. Wanted to try a carrot cake without pineapple. I follwed the recipe, but still so so results.

First time to make carrot cake and it was really good. I did substitute all that oil for 1/3 cup oil and 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce like others had recommended, and used half a cup of white sugar and a half a cup of brown sugar. Very moist and will for sure make again.

After reading the other comments, I made some changes and came out with an absolutely fabulous carrot cake! I didn't have applesauce so I used 1/2C canola oil and 1/2C coconut oil. I also cut it down to 1C of sugar, and added 1/2 tsp of ground ginger, and 1/4 tsp of freshly ground nutmeg. Topped it with cream cheese frosting in which I also reduced the sugar by half. So tasty that I'm making another one today!

I made this cake for my mom's birthday, since she's a huge fan of carrot cake. It was a small family party, so I halved the recipe and made a little one layer 8 inch cake. Everyone LOVED it! I'm not a big fan of carrot cake, and my dad isn't a big walnut fan, but we both adored it. It was so moist, and had a fantastic flavor to it. I did make a few tweaks, I used half oil and half applesauce, I used extra virgin olive oil, I added extra cinnamon, extra nuts, and a half a cup more carrot. It was absolutely superb when topped with cream cheese frosting. This will definitely be my go to carrot cake recipe!

OMG!  This cake was AWESOME!  I, like others replaced the oil with applesauce.  I doubled the cinnamon, threw in a handful of coconut, raisins, dried cranberries .. and frosted with one of the cream cheese icing recipies I found on this site.  It was truly awesome!  Did the 2 8" round pans .. its very heavy .. and AS good if not better than any carrot cake you'd get at any restaurant!

I have never reviewed a recipe before however feel obliged to warn others, I followed exactly as posted and the cake erupted like a volcano in my oven. I have to think there is too much baking powder suggested. I have made many allrecipes from this site, my uncle loves the site and never had such issues with a recipe before. Sorry for the  negative review.

I'm giving the 4 out of 5 only because I followed some of the reviewers suggestions and did not have the turn out I wanted. I used 1 cup of applesauce and 1/3 cup oil instead and I found the cake to be a bit too dry. I also used only 1 cup of sugar and didn't think the cake was sweet enough. It was more like a sweet bread than a cake. Will may again and follow the directions exactly to see what happens.

Thanks for this recipe which I am sure is terrific as written.  However, it was also a great recipe to play with.  To make it more healthy I subbed 1 C of no sugger added applesauce for 1 C of the oil, cut the sugar to 1.5 cups and made the .5 cup Splenda, and subbed 1 C of whole wheat flour for one of the cups of reg. flour.  Because I was fooling with the recipe I added 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice.  I baked mine in an angel food cake pan and it took an extra 10 minutes.  It was tricky to take off the tube, but worth the effort.  My guests said it was very moist and asked for the recipe.

This is the BEST carrot cake!  I just can't get enough of it!  My husband said I can only make it for special occations because he eats it ALL!  I did a few things differnt like some oter users.  I used 6cups of carrots instead of 4 because I like the extra veggies and crunch, oh and the orangey color.  I used 1/4cup oil and 1cup unsweeted apple sauce and it was just as moist as could be.  I also halved the sugar. I think it balenced it out with the super sweet cream cheese icing!  Makes it a lil better for you and less guilty!  I make this cake as often as possible, none of it ever goes to waist!

We LOVED this recipe!  Since I mince my carrots (husband doesn't like to "bite" into carrots in the cake) I used only about 2 cups "minced" carrots.  Otherwise I followed this recipe exactly, and love it!  Thank you for the great recipe!

This is a super cake, moist and delicious. I used a loaf glass baking dish to cook it and thus had to increase the cooking time  by abt 10 mins. Though next time, I should reduce the oil. My hands were slightly greasy after eating it. But the best carrot cake ever and great job Michele!!!

I made the cake according to the instructions, only I quartered the amount of ingredients. It came out beautiful. This was my first attempt at Carrot Cake and I didn't know what to expect (I was afraid that it would taste like, well, cooked carrots), but I am pleasantly surprised that the most prominent flavours are cinnamon and walnuts (which is a wonderful combination, reminding me of Christmas baking). The cake is moist but light (I did not observe the baking time as my oven is a bit funny...). EDITED: I left the cake on the counter overnight and it did not change the tiniest bit. It's still moist. Wow, I would give the recipe six stars if I could!

This turned out great! I substituted applesauce for the oil, which made it nice and moist. I also used spelt flour instead of regular wheat flour (which my daughter is allergic to). I added about a teaspoon of allspice to the recipe (which I do to any recipe calling for cinnamon) and it had a fantastic spice flavor.

Fantastic and easy. I used half the sugar and oil as was suggested by other reviewers. Added 3/4 cup of cinnamon applesauce. Cake was moist and firm. I used "Cream Cheese Frosting II" recipe with half the sugar for the icing. It was great, but use more sugar if you prefer your frosting sweeter.

I had a taste for carrot cake and the ingredients are easy to find around anybody's kitchen. I wanted something plain and simple, but delicious. This was the first recipe I tried and it was fabulous!!!!! I found a recipe for cream cheese frosting on this website and the combination was out of this world! My family was impressed!
