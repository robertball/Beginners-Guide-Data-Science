This was pretty good. It was really lacking salt though. Next time I'll probably add at least a teaspoon of salt. I also used onion powder and garlic powder as I didn't have the dried minced garlic and onion on hand. Other than that it was very good and juicy

My son and I really enjoyed this. I didn't have any dried minced onion or dried minced garlic, so I used 1/4 tsp onion powder and 1/4 tsp garlic powder instead. I also used a mix of olive oil and canola oil, but aside from these, made no other changes. A keeper !

This is fabulous and my whole family loved it.  The chicken breasts I had were very large, so they took longer to cook.  Next time I will cut them in halve and pound them a little thinner.  I also used olive oil instead of canola.

My husband said, MMmm - what's in this?   We put it on pork chops as a rub and then made it up again and added it to the vegetables we stir fried.. just great! I sub'ed 1 tsp seasoned salt for the paprika and used 1/3 tsp of onion powder and garlic powder.

It had a nice kick but the flavor was not good. My husband and I both did not like the recipe and I love spicy food.

This turned out GREAT! It was my first "real" meal that I made after moving around the house, and it was a great experience. The recipe was very easy. I used slightly smaller chicken breasts, so I really had to watch them to make sure they cooked evenly. The flavors are phenomenal!

Super easy to make and was very tasty. My hubby said it puts Wendy's spicy chicken to shame! I will definitely make it again!

My husband and I were trying a wine that was best served w/ something spicy - I found this recipe and actually had all the spices on hand. It was delicious - my husband and I love it! I just added about a 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs to make it more of a breading! Wonderful.

Perfectly Spicy if you like SPICY. Had that chili kind of taste to it. You can adjust the level of spice which is nice. I will grill it next time for more smokey flavor added. I also used the same spicy mix for the potatoes in the oven.

Excellent spice for chicken or pork. I used this recipe to make a stir fry as follows:
I cut chicken breast into cubes.
Combined spices in a bowl then added three tablespoons of olive oil and mixed well. Then I added the chicken and mixed until all pieces were coated. I let it stand about 15 minutes, then stir fried in a hot pan until the meat was cooked. Added broccoli, mushrooms and onions and stir fried until vegetables were heated through. Served over white rice.

It was delicious! I did cut the cayenne in half, and added salt during the cooking. Next time I'll add some pineapple chunks. I think they'll be a nice layer in the dish.

It was OK. I was looking for a new way to spice up my chicken, so I decided to try this... but I've had much better luck just tossing spices I know I like together in a bag. I don't think I would go back to this recipe again.
