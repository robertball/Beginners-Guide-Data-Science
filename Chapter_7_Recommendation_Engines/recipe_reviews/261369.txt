Made as written and this turned out pretty good. The sazon and adobo made it a little bit too salty so I recommend cutting back some. Loved the additional of the green olives (also salty) but if you are not a fan, black would work too.

I have a son who has to watch his salt intake and Adobo and Sazon store bought seasonings have alot of sodium in them. I read where alot of people said the salt taste was a bit much. I found recipes for homemade  versions of both and omitted the salt (geniuskitchen.com for the Adobo and fifteenspatulas.com for the Sazon) You can make your own and use less salt or omit it altogether and it still tastes great!

A great way to change up your normal cooking patterns! This was fast and easy and flavorful, just as the recipe says.  I agree with one of the other reviews - the salt content could be reduced a bit.  Also, just a note - by the time I added the red beans, there was no water left but I mixed in the beans and we ate it as-is.  Thanks for a good quick weeknight recipe!
