This is a wonderful cake. I actually instead of the Betty Crocker frosting use a different frosting. I don't like canned frosting very well so I instead do this: I take 1- 8 oz. frozen container of cool whip that has been thawed and a 6 oz. conatiner of strawberry yogurt and red food coloring and stir it by hand and use this to frost the cake. It is wonderful like this. You actually have to buy 2 strawberry yogurts if you do it this way. The red food coloring makes the frosting look much nicer otherwise it is pretty pale pink and not near as fancy. I also then place sliced in half strawberries on top--  1/2 of a strawberry on each piece of cake. You need to refridgerate the cake because of the cool whip.  I also don't use 4 cups of strawberries because I put it in a 9x13 cake pan and use strawberries just on top-- 1 put piece of cake. I have brought this many places and people LOVE it!

This was a very good strawberry cake. It may seem difficult to make for beginners but it's not at all. I had it for my birthday. I followed a user's suggestion and stirred together 1 thawed container of whipped cream and an extra cup of strawberry yogurt in a small bowl. I then added drops of red food coloring to it and it gave the frosting a nice pink color. It turned out good.  I would recommend it to strawberry lovers like me. =)

I just made this cake for my sister-in-law's birthday and it turned out perfect! I used Betty Crocker Whipped Whip Cream frosting instead of the vanilla to give it a lighter taste and colored the frosting in the middle of the two cakes with red food coloring to make it pink. The strawberrys I used werent super sweet because they are not in season so I mixed them with a few tablespoons of sugar and dried them in a paper towel to give them a kick. All in all, great recipe.
