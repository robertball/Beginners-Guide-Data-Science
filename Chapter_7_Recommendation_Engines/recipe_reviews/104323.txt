This is a great salad! Using a red onion makes it even prettier.

This was a very tasty and different recipe. I used regular Broccoli and let the ingredients stand in the fridge for a few hours to bring the flavors together. Easy to put together in a hurry and very impressive taste!

This is a wonderful twist on broccoli salad. Stores are carrying the broccoflower more and more along with other variations of cauliflower.  Beautiful to look at and quite tasty.  (You can add crumbled bacon if you like, I do.

Very good.  Served it with the slow cook short ribs.  I didn't have slivered almonds so I chopped some toasted whole almonds in the food processor and it worked fine.  Will make again.  Terrific for a pot luck.

I use regular broccoli and cauliflower for variety, red onion, and often use walnuts instead of almonds.  Either way, people rave about this and I make it all the time!

I made this recipe using regular broccoli and green onions instead of minced onion (personal preference for this type of salad). It was great! I will definately be making this again.
