Great recipe.  Easy, quick, cheap, and adaptable.  Made as directed.  Tasted great.  Added some liquid smoke to the leftovers - even better!

I made this dish for some girls that came to the US from Brazil a few weeks ago. They loved it and told me it was just like how their grandma makes it! It has now became the favorite way my husband and I make beans!

The perfect side to a Brazilian churrasco or any other barbecue for that matter. This is truly quick and easy for a very flavorful dish.  I'll be making this again and recommend everyone to stray from the norm and make this.
