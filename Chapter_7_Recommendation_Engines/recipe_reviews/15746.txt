5 Stars.  A wonderful, tasty bread.  Used 1/2 Cup applesauce and 1/2 Cup butter in place of shortening, used 3 bananas for a moist bread, no raisins.  The crust came out really well!  Lovely.

I have made MANY banana breads, but this one is by far the BEST one EVER.

It is so very moist, and delicious. The oats give it such a wonderful texture!

It is a wonderful bread to have with tea, or coffee.

My hubby LOVED it! It was a hit over here in my house!! Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!

I call this recipe 'BOB' (: Great bread, have made several times! I really like the addition of oatmeal to the traditional BB...However, I sub 1/2 applesauce, 1/2 butter to make it a bit healthier instead of the shortening. Turned out very nice! Thank you! Note: only use 2 small bananas in this in the posted pic. Only added a 'splash' of milk.

Light, moist and flavorful. I used 1/4 c applesauce and 1/4 c butter in place of the shortening, and reduced the sugar to 3/4 C. I also used old fashioned oats in place of the quick rolled oats, and soaked them in the milk and applesauce while assembling the other ingredients (adding the oat mix with the whole raisins). Finally, I added a pinch of ground cloves and a tablespoon of ground flax seeds.

I made this into muffins this morning. Baked them for about 18 minutes. They turned out great! I have rated this recipe before and really liked it. My daughters & I love to bake. We have been searching for the PERFECT banana oatmeal muffin recipe. We have decided this is it! Thanks for a great recipe.

I've made about 15 loaves of banana bread for a bake sale today and this recipe was the big winner!!  I used 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 butter for the shortening, a full teaspoon of vanilla, and a 1/2 teaspoon of allspice.  It produces a very dense, chewy loaf of bread.  If you're want for light and fluffy keep looking, but this bread tastes great!

We really didn't find this bread too impressive,  which suprised me.  I followed the instructions to a T,  only substituting currants for the raisins.  The bread didn't rise at all,  and ended up really dark.  It was moist,  and the taste was ok,  but the texture was really strange.  Maybe that is just my own pre-concieved idea about what a quick-bread texture is supposed to be like though.

This is a very good bread. The oatmeal really makes a difference. It's not very sweet, but it is very moist and good. I just made it yesterday it's almost completely gone. Thanks for sharing, Carolyn!

this recipe yields a really great moist banana bread. the oatmeal does give it a special something extra.  i used butter instead of shortening and only 1/3c, with an additional 1/4c of applesauce.  i also probably had at least 2c of mashed banana.  thanks!

I used butter (about 6 tbs), walnuts instead of raisins, and I ground up the oats into a flour in a blender before using them, and used whole wheat instead of all purpose flour.  My bread turned out really, really delicious.  I have tried many banana bread recipes but this is my new favorite.

I have just moved to Holland from Canada and had to leave all my recipe books behind for now.I have been experimenting with a number of the sweet bread recipes on the site and this is the best one so far.Both my husband and I think it is delicious.After reading the reviews I opted not to sift the oatmeal and since I didnÂ´t have chopped raisins I added whole plump raisins.Other than that I followed the recipe as written and the results were great.As noted in previous reviews it is not too sweet and perfectly moist.This will be a recipe I use very often.Thank you Carolyn!

This is really good.  I did not have raisins or shortening.  I used melted butter and it did not look like to me it needed the milk so I left it out.  I had four bananas, so I did not measure just smashed.  My house smells wonderful and this tastes great!

It's a sad thing to watch a 34 year old woman give herself a stomach ache from eating 6 mini muffins and a small slice of this bread when it came out the oven. MAN is this some good stuff! Hubby ate some and said it's one of my finest breads to date. I subbed 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup butter for the shortening, omitted the raisins and added some walnuts and a few chocolate chips. DIVINE! It doesn't rise much but who cares! I'm soooo making this again. Soon...like probably tomorrow!

I have using this recipe for a few years now, but never rated it.  Excellent, hearty bread!  I make half the flour whole wheat, put in pecans instead of raisins and also add 1/2 cup of sour cream or yogurt.  Everyone asks for the recipe!

Great easy recipe, I do not like shortening so replaced with 1/4 cup Apple Sauce and 1/4 cup of Butter.  I did use the raisins which I had presoaked in Brandy, added an additional 1/2 teaspoon Cinnamon.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I'm not used to write reviews, but this banana bread definetely deserves it!!! It's simply delicious and healthy!  My husband and daughter loved it! I've done it four times already, and they don't get tired of it. Perfect for breakfast, or just to share it with some friends, which I did and they were surprised it was banana bread, they said it definetely has not the oily consistency other banana breads have!  It's with no mistake, a keeper.

It was the perfect banana bread. A definite keeper. I did make some fattening changes to it though! I used 1 stick butter plus 1 cup cinnamon applesauce, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 white,  2 bananas, and I poured half in...then a thin layer of nutella, and then poured the rest. It was to die for!

We thoroughly enjoyed this bread.  I make banana bread almost weekly ( I am beginning to think my family is forgetting to eat the bananas on purpose:)), and this was a nice change from my go-to recipe.  The oats add a nice texture to the bread.  I also love adding cinnamon to my banana bread, as I love that little added flavor.  I did use butter instead of shortening and only used 1/4 cup and 1/4 cup applesauce.  I did not add the raisins, but did add in a little bit of chopped pecans.  I am so glad that I deviated from the norm and tried this recipe!

I scaled this recipe to 27 servings as I had 10 bananas to use up. I used 1/2 cup canola oil, 1/2 cup each white and brown sugar, 5 eggs, 1 tbsp vanilla, 2 3/4 cups Robin Hood whole wheat and flax flour, 2 3/4 cups rolled oats, 3 tsps baking powder, 3/4 tsp baking soda, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 10 bananas and a heaping cup of mini chocolate chips. I omitted the salt and milk as it was not needed. This recipe has 2 main flaws, not enough flour and rolled oats and not enough leavening, the formula for leavening is 1 tsp of baking powder to 1 cup flour and 1/4 tsp baking soda to 1 cup of flour. I made muffins out of the recipe, my #50 scoop yielded 29 muffins that baked in 23 minutes, they were nicely domed and very tasty and healthy! Good recipe that just needed some tweaking.

I also substituted 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup applesauce for the shortening.  It was wonderful.  I think next time I will use just a tad less butter.

Excellent, moist banana bread made healthier with the following changes: 1/2 cup Smart Balance 50/50 butter blend instead of shortening, 1/2 cup sugar instead of 1 cup, and egg beaters instead of eggs.  Delicious!

I made this today, making it a little healthier by using all applesauce instead of shortening and 1/2 wheat flour. I also omitted the milk because the batter didn't seem to need it.  Everything else was according to the recipe.  It is a phenomenal lowfat bread!  The texture is hearty with the addition of the oats, and the flavor is great!  I don't know how it would turn out with the shortening/fat added, but if you want a low fat treat that is tasty and filling, this sure fits the bill!

Everone rally liked this.  We made muffins instead of loaves. Used 1/2 margarine,1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar we also used 1/2 cup wheat and 1/2 cup white flour.  We were a little short on bananas so we used 2 small bananas and 1/2 cup applesauce to make up for the lack of bananas and the margarine substitution.  Bakeing time for the muffins was about 15 - 18 minutes.  The brown sugar and wheat flour addition really made this extra yummy with a little bit of nutty flavor. If I use brown sugar again next time I think I will cut out about 1/4 cup because they were a little sweeter than i like.

Loved this bread.  Made it exactly as the recipe and it was good, but a little too sweet for me.  I then made it again.Replaced the shortening with Earth Balance, used raw sugar and cut the qty in half and left out the raisins.  It turned out pretty good.  Nothing wrong with the original, but it is a health issue.

yummy! I used butter instead of shortening, 1 tsp vanilla, added 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1/2 cup nuts instead of the raisins. I didn't sift any of the dry ingredients. absolutely delicious!

I followed the recipe almost to a T, except I cut the sugar in half.  They were delicious.  I've tried lots of banana bread recipes, and this one is the best!  I baked as muffins, also, and they turned out equally good.  It's flexible, too, you can add in coconut or nuts, but even without it tastes great.

I thought this recipie was great I added pecans and also use buttermilk a little over 1/4 cup. Two and a half bananas moist, delicious. Had no trouble at all with it not rising. Loved the addition of oatmeal also thanks.

WOW. This is yummy. I will definitely be making it again. I made according to directions except that I added 2 tbsp ground flaxseed to the batter. I baked it for 60 minutes at 350. It fell in the middle where it was undercooked so next time I'll be keeping it in the oven longer. But at the rate we're gobbling it up, it won't last two whole days. Even my picky toddler ate it and asked for more.

I had been searching for a recipe that was slightly healthier than my favorite banana bread (made with butter, sour cream, and chocolate chips, it that has a zillion calories). Looks like I got my wish. This one's a keeper.

My family is not a big fan of banana bread but this was so moist and tasty, it was gone in a matter of hours.  As some reviews suggested, I substituted 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup coconut oil for the shortening and coconut milk for the milk because I had it and it made it a little healthier.  I also baked it in a bunt pan and sprinkled a few sliced almonds on top for looks.  I cut the baking time by about 10minutes so just keep an eye on it.  Thank you for this recipe, I will definitely make this again!

I made this recipe two weekends in a row.  The first time I used margarine in the recipe.  The second time I used butter in the recipe.  The margarine made a far superior bread.  Better consistancy and better flavor.  The butter recipe was very crumbly and the margarine was very moist, but cut firmly.  I always add extra bananas to my banana breads as I did with this one.  I will definately continue to make this bread ~ using margarine.

I found this recipe quite disappointing. Though it had a lovely flavor (though a bit sweet for my taste)it was way too moist and did not set at all. I would omit the milk and reduce the sugar by a quarter cup if I were to try this again.

This is the best banana bread I've ever made.  I used sweet-cream butter for the shortening, half cup brown sugar and half cup of white, 1 cup whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour, added extra half teaspoon cinnamon, and added 1 tablespoon dark rum.  I also didn't use the quick oats, I used Old Fashioned Quaker oats instead.  They gave the bread slight texture and it was still very moist.  I've already made this recipe 2x in 2 weeks.  YUM!!!

Very moist and tasty- my 1 year old loves it for any meal!  Definitely make it more healthy by substituting a combination of applesauce and vegetable oil for the shortening- 1/4 of each.  3 bananas seemed just right.  I might try it with chocolate chips next time too.  Yummy!

Like others recommended I subbed 1/2 C butter and 1/2 C apple sauce for the margarine.  It was moist and yummy!  My kids voted it way better than the banana bread I've been making for years.

This is a wonderful bread.  I made some in muffin tins to cut down on the baking and cooling time.  These were gone in no time!  I added a bit of nutmeg to mine.  This is a favorite!

Loved this. I used coconut oil instead of shortening, and 1/2 cup white flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. We didn't have rasins, so I threw in some chopped walnuts.

Changed just a couple things: used half applesauce half butter, half brown sugar and half white and used old fashion oats instead of the quick cooking. I am eating it hot out of the oven and its really good! It will be interesting to see what it tastes like when its cooled but i suspect it will be amazing!!!

OMG!  This is a great recipe.  To say the bread is moist is an understatement.  We used red bananas and no raisins.  YUM!!  My 10 year old made it and nailed it without too much assistance from me.  We'll try out other recipes and compare the results.  This should be fun!!

WELL... I changed things but this was a good starting place. I used 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup softened butter, old fashion oats (because that's all I had), a little extra vanilla, and half brown sugar and half white sugar. everything else was the same and it turned out moist and yummy. It seemed thin when I put it in the pan but cooked well :)

I used 1/2 cup apple sauce in place of shortening. I also used 1/2c whole wheat flour and 1/2c white flour. I had to bake it for about an hour and twenty minutes... maybe my oven is slow... Worth the wait though!!! So moist and delicious!

This bread turned out good -- even with my modifications:  1 cup whole wheat flour + one cup oatmeal, Organic liquid egg sub in stead of whole eggs, applesauce instead of oil, and Stevia instead of sugar.  Usually I get something inedible, but with this recipe it turned out great!  I will definitely make it again and maybe use 1/2 sugar, 1/2 Stevia.
Now I won't feel guilty having it with my morning coffee -- a low fat, low sugar, high fiber treat!

Interesting texture.  I used the applesauce/butter combo instead of the shortening, and substituted chocolate chips for the raisins.  It tastes good, and is a snap to make.

I've made this a dozen times, always to rave reviews. You do have to make sure it's totally cooked - it's so dense that it may seem done before it really is. Just make sure it passes the toothpick-test with flying colors and you'll be fine. SUPER yummy!

Delicious! I substituted 1/2 of the flour with whole wheat flour and added 1/4 cup flax seed to the batter at the end. Very moist, dense bread in a good way. I will definitely be making this again.

This banana bread is moist and tasty. I was a little put off by the oatmeal, but it didn't alter the taste or the texture. I did make a few changes. As some of the other reviewers did I used butter rather than Crisco and added the half cup of applesauce. I added nuts rather than raisins. The next time I make it I will probably add nutmeg. But it really is a good recipe. I will use this recipe from now on instead of my old banana bread recipe. Thanks for sharing.

After reading some of the reviews...I made a lot of changes. I used the 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1/2 a cup of butter in place of the shortening. I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg and a dash of ground cloves; then doubled the bananas/vanilla and forgot the milk. I divided the batter 4 ways and added different things to each: raisins,crushed nuts,blueberries,and strawberries. (The mini batches that contained the strawberries and blueberries didn't rise as well as the others.) While all the muffins tasted good I liked the ones with the crushed nuts the best. I gave this recipe a 5 star rating because I love how much room it leaves for changes.

This seemed to taste way sweeter to me than typical banana bread, too sweet for my tastes (and I rarely complain on that issue). Maybe it really depends on your bananas. I would not sugggest doing what I did, which was to use "old fashioned" oats rather than the specified "quick" oats. The old fashioned oats did not blend into the batter to contribute to the structure of the bread, instead it was more like individual bits of chewy oats, which were interesting but made the bread texture less than it could have been.

I am not a very good cook...but I was able to make this very easily! I was a bit short on sugar, and my bananas were not quite ripe, so I simply added 2 tablespoons of honey. The bread was moist and delicious! My fiance ate the entire pan for lunch! Also, I used butter instead of shortening and it turned out just fine! Thanks for this great bread!!!

I usually make 'The Best Banana Bread' recipe from this site but wanted it a little healthier this time, and this was delicious. I used butter instead of shortening but followed the rest exactly, and it was moist and full of flavor.

The flavor was good and it was very moist.  I had a problem with the raisins settling and i lost the bottom of the bread when I removed it from the pan.  My co-workers enjoyed the flavor & texture.  I made the reipe as listed but also added walnuts.

Fresh out of the oven this bread is amazing.  I really enjoyed the oatmeal texture.  I didn't like it as much the second day however, because it became much thicker/heavier than normal banana bread.

This banana bread recipe is very good but not outstanding.  The bread was moist and not overly sweet.  The oatmeal gave it an unusual texture - different for banana bread.  I would make this again.  Also, I added a bit more vanilla to the recipe.

Turned out great.  I did make some substitutions when I made this bread.  I used Fructose instead of sugar, and 10 Grain Cereal in the place of the oats.  Cause of this I baked it at a lower temp and for a little longer than called for.  Turned out great.  Also added walnuts... was super!

I swapped out the shortening for  1/2 C unsalted butter and 1/2 C unsweetened applesauce.  Also eliminated raisins (not fond of them in banana bread).   Added 3 generous T of Chia seed to the dry mix.  Give 'illusion' of banana seed, but adds the benefit of Omegas and moisture!  Delicious, moist, and yummy!  LOVE this recipe!

Yummy!!  What I really liked was the hearty oatmeal.  I did make some additions, I chopped 2 apples and doubled the cinnamon and vanilla, this was gone in my house.  Just delicious.  I set some cream chesse out, it was evil.

This has a wonderful taste and texture.  I did add a rounded 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, subbed dried cranberries for the raisins (I didn't have raisins), used butter instead of shortening, and added a handful of pecans.  Next time, I'll try adding some wheat germ and bran and reducing the shortening and sugar, possibly adding some applesauce instead.  A great breakfast bread spread with peanut butter.

Sub'd butter for the shortening since that's what I had.  Made (29 lg) mini muffins. The flavor and texture are wonderful!  But the domes leave much to be desired.  In the next batch, I'll reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup.

This recipe is almost identical to the one I've made for years but I use only 1/2 cup of sugar (the bananas make it plenty sweet) and add 1 tsp. making powder, which helps it rise. And no raisins. 

It's a family favorite.

So good! I made them into muffins because I didn't want to wait an hour to cook.  I made 24 from the amount in the recipe, filled about 1/2 way.  I baked them at 350 x 19 minutes.  I did sub the shortening for 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup vegetable oil.  I also added about 1/4 - 1/2 cup more flour.  I used 3 mashed bananas.  They tasted great, good texture, and they were very moist.  I had been looking for a recipe to use overripe bananas and this is perfect!

This was a snap to make and the results were delicious!  I usually like nuts in my banana  bread but my husband doesn't so I didn't add any.  I was pleasantly surprised that the oats give just enough texture to give this bread good mouthfeel without needing to add nuts.  Loved it and will definitely make it again!!

This was an excellent recipe - I was looking for a banana oatmeal bread recipe that would use up the ingredients in my kitchen instead of going for my quick and easy bisquick route. This totally hit the spot. The combination of cinnamon and vanilla was completely unexpected but added to the bananas and oatmeal. The bread was also super moist. Will be making again, but doubling the recipe! Thanks, Carolyn!

Delicious!!!  I modified it by using unsalted butter instead of shortening, and 1/2 cup white sugar 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of all white sugar and used buttermilk instead of regular milk.  So moist any yummy!!!

I love this recipe, however I always make a double batch.  We freeze our bananas as they are turning and just get them out when we have enough for a loaf or two.    I add walnuts instead of raisins and it's great.  For those saying the texture isn't good, this is a very dense heavy bread because of the oatmeal.  I do add two tablespoons of brewers yeast and substitute 1/4 cup of flour for 1/4 cup of ground flax seed (and one tablespoon of milk) as well as the 1/2 cup of butter/ 1/2 cup of applesauce.  This is my 'nursing' bread recipe to boost milk production in lactating moms.

The flavor was very good, not the family favorite but up there.   Good color and banana flavor.   As with other dense sweet breads I make, the center remained a little raw.

Made it with Splenda (24 packets = 1 cup sugar) and it came out great.  And oatmeal always makes me happy.  V. moist and delicious.

This is a family and friend favorite! I make as muffins/cup cakes for ease of serving size to share and bakes a little quicker. We've tried plain or with raisins and even tried chocolate chip. all are good. Make for breakfast or your next pitch in.

Used the recipe as-is, without the raisins.  Every other bread I have made like this has turned out dry.  NOT THIS ONE!  You can't go wrong with this recipe!  So moist!  I took it to the office the next morning and my friend told me it was the best banana bread that she ever had.

Excellent recipe!  Bread was moist, slightly chewy, good, hearty flavor.  The only change I made was to use 1 teaspoon of vanilla instead of 1/2.  I also covered it with aluminum foil the last 10 minutes to avoid over browning.

This is really nice. Great flavor, lovely texture, extremely moist. It's a very dense, moist bread. I took the suggestion of other reviewers and used a 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup of apple sauce. I also only needed to bake for 40 minutes in my apartment sized oven. This came out great. Thanks Carolyn!

This is my fav banana bread recipe now.  I made a few modifications: Used 1/2 brown sugar; 1/2 white sugar Used 100% white whole wheat flour (King Arthur) Added a handful of ground flax seed (1/4 cup) Doubled vanilla & cinnamon Didn't chop raisins.  I found that I needed to watch the time and test more carefully.  The dense texture made this test done, but it was still raw in the middle.  I had put it on a rack to cool and the middle fell out.  I scooped it up and re-baked it 10 min.  Amazingly, it turned out great and tasted like a cookie.  My 5 year old boys love this stuff.  It tastes even moister after a day or 2.  It is a dark loaf and dense (not fluffy).  The crust is yummy.  The oatmeal adds a nice rustic texture.  High 5s and thanks for the great recipe.

I LOVE this bread! It tastes like a traditional banana bread but the texture is what makes it stand out! Very moist and hearty! I used 3 large bananas (I like a definite banana flavor), substituted 1/2 unsalted butter and 1/2 plain applesauce for the shortening (didn't have shortening on hand) and added 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon instead of 1/2 tsp. Left the rest the same and cooked for 55 min. The edges of the bread did start to get dark around 40 min. so I covered with foil for the rest of the time. Next time I may nor cover because I like a little crust. This is AWESOME bread!

Yum!  I just made these.  I doubled the recipe,  subbed 1/2 the shortening with butter and the other 1/2 with cinnamon apple sauce, did 1C white sugar and 1C brown and in addition to the cinnamon i added another teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, i used old fashioned oats instead of quick cook.  i also baked it in heart shaped muffin pans. this would be even better with pecans or walnuts in it.   Thank you for the base recipe,  this came out wonderfully!

I used butter, added a half tsp. of nutmeg and used leftover eggnog in place of the milk called for. Nice earthy tasting loaf. I don't normally think of oatmeal in banana bread, but it's good.
Great way to use up my excess oatmeal, because I have a ton. (And oatmeal is always cheap, yo.) YUM.

This bread was moist and fabulous.  I used regular rolled oats instead of quick oats, and it gave the bread a wonderful, thick texture. It is a little sweet, so I may use less sugar next time.  I definitely like this oaty version better than my regular recipe.

I've been making this recipe for years. It can easily be doubled, and even turns out perfect if you just throw all of the ingredients in the bowl (including the bananas!) and turn the mixer on! I don't take the time to measure the bananas, I just add about 3 large bananas. I measured the first time, and that's what it equaled up to. =)

I made this recipe, and added 1/2 cup more oats, 1 cup of blueberries, and also a dash of nutmeg, ground cloves, and ground ginger. It came out very well - flavorful with a dense texture. It was not too sweet, which I like, but if you prefer a sweeter banana bread I would add a bit more sugar. Next time I think I might use even more banana.

This was the best banana bread I have ever had. I used 3 large bananas since thats what I had to use up. Very moist, Very tasty. The raisins add a little extra sweetness that was just right. I chopped them up in a mini food processor so they weren't too prominient. I also added a cup or so of chopped walnuts. Yum Yum!

Excellent banana bread recipe.  I used 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 spread as suggested in other reviews.  I also used whole wheat flour.  It was absolutely delicious.  Thank you for the recipe!!

Loved it.  It tastes great, it uses up ripe banannas (which is wonderful since our banannas always seem to turn very quickly) and it adds a good boost of fiber.

This is a good version of the typical Banana Bread.  The oatmeal makes it  much more hearty and dense, but it is not dry!  My loaves did not rise much, but it was still good.  I took other reviewers advice and used cinnamon applesauce in place of the shortening.

This recipie is T-E-R_riffic!  Best of all my husband loves it, and I feel good about adding a few more oats to his diet.
You can cut the sugar to about 3/4 cup and then add mini-chocolate chips.  I add a whole tsp. of vanilla.  Excellente'!

This was soooo good!  We had different family members visiting throughout last month. I made this bread for breakfast each time & served with fruit salad.  Easy!  Everyone has loved it (I also added pecans & raisins).  Thanks very much for this recipe.

Love this recipe!  Iâve made it many times, usually as muffins, and sometimes substituting pumpkin purÃ©e or applesauce for the bananas. Bananas and blueberries make a nice combination too.

I liked the light taste of oatmeal, the balance of flavor in this banana bread.
I would make it again, very nice.

Have you seen that banana bread recipe that has over +999 reviews? I made that one on accident instead of this one today and it is definitely not as good as this one! This is the best banana bread Iâve ever had. Iâve made it several times and it always gets gobbled up before lunch.

Great results! I made this recipe into muffins, baked ~30 min, and used about half the sugar called for since I prefer milder sweetness. I did add some dark chocolate morsels to half the batch which ended up being a nice complement to the banana flavor. I'll definitely make this recipe again!

I double the recipe because I had lots of bananas to use. I threw in a whole cup of raisins and 3/4 of a cup of mini chocolate chips. I was able to use two 9 x 5 loaf pans. In the same batch. The banana bread is very moist but binds well. My grandkids loved it! Sugar them up and send them home! A grandmotherâs prerogative!

This is a delicious recipe! I kept the ingredients pretty much the same. Used golden raisins instead of regular, added a few tablespoons of chia seeds which wouldnât have affected the texture much. I changed up the execution slightly... I beat the mashed bananas into the creamed shortening and eggs, poured the milk into the oats, and then just mixed these two with the dry ingredients before folding in the nuts and raisins. Turned out so good and was moist. Baking time was spot on even at higher altitude (3,500 ft). Thank you for sharing!

My husband said it was my best banana bread so far. I used a container of 1/2 c. of instant apple/cinnamon oatmeal and coconut oil instead of shortening.  There wasnât any particular reason. It was just what I had on hand.

This is the best Banana Bread I have ever made.  I did substitute softened butter for the shortening and used 3 very ripe bananas.  I love the crispiness of the edges and the moisture and texture of the inside.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I used applesauce instead of shortening and only 3/4 cup sugar.  Mashed 4 smaller-sized bananas and just threw it all in a big bowl and mixed together with just a fork (didn't sift together, alternate adding, etc.).  Folded in chocolate chips at the end instead of the raisins because...well...why not?  Good texture, great taste, easy recipe that I made with my daughter's assistance--and will be making again!

This banana bread came out so moist and delicious! This is the best banana bread I've made! I made this into jumbo muffins. I added about a  cup of chocolate chips and 3-4 tbsp. of chia, instead of quick oats I used old fashioned oats, and used about 5 bananas . I topped the muffins with old fashioned oats and a dash of brown sugar. They came out amazing!!!

My daughter could not get enough of this banana bread. I added choc chips, and used the butter/applesauce combo in place of the shortening as others suggested.  
I made it twice in 4 days! Guess it's a hit!

Without a doubt, the BEST banana bread that I have ever made.  Easy, great consistency and super yummy.

I followed the directions and ingredients exactly as listed (raisins were omitted), other than I sprinkled some chopped walnuts on top prior to baking.  My whole family loved it -- so much so that this is now my go-to banana bread recipe.

Used half butter, half avo oil instead of shortening. 1/2 cup sugar was plenty sweet. Added nuts instead of raisins. Delicious! A bit crumbly but not greasy or too dense at all.

Wow..delicious bread. I did make some changes based on health needs and reviews. I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/2 cup apple sauce.  I used regular oats instead of quick. And lastly I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white.. 
 I normally try to cut sugar in half because we never like things really sweet. Based on reviews I added most of sugar. I regretted that. made it much to sweet with the applesauce and over ripe bananas..I added pecans instead of raisins also.
 The texture of this bread is devine. I cooked mine for 60 minutes. It was perfectly done.
 This will be my new go to banana bread recipe for frozen left over bananas. Num..thank you

It tasted amazing! I followed the advice of another reviewer and used applesauce and butter ILO shortening. It was crunchy on the outside and moist and delicious inside. I had a couple of false finishes - my toothpick came out dry although it was still 10 minutes from done - I think it was due to the hard exterior.

Turned out great, very moist. I followed recipe, but instead of raisins I used choc chips and used baileys instead of milk. Make sure to grease the pan like the recipe says, some of mine stuck to the bottom even after light greasing. I also topped the loaf with walnuts and more choc chips! Yum!

I love banana bread. So I decided to go ahead and make me some. Found this banana walnut recipe, and decided to make it. DELICIOUS!!! 
It's moist, has the perfect balance of the oatmeal and bananas, and it cooks  perfectly in the oven. I made it for my family and everyone wanted more. This is THE best banana bread I have had in a long time. (besides my grandmother's of course). I will make this again.

This is a great recipe. I've made it dozens of times. The oatmeal gives it texture. I usually add pecans and coconut.

The top of the bread had a funny bubbly texture but I used butter not shortening, may have used 1/2 teaspoon too much baking soda - my son distracted me, and I sprinkled some oats on top. So I was thinking it didn't come out very good but wow awesome flavor super moist. I added the raisins they're a nice addition

My family told me this was the best banana bread they've ever had- and I agree! Only changes I made were using real butter and brown sugar instead of white. I used 6 bananas from my freezer- they were black as can be. The crust was almost caramelized and so delicious.  This one is going in the books!

I LOVE this recipe, as do my grandkids. the only change I made was only using a half cup of sugar (not intentionally...itâs all I had on hand).  Still yummy and healthier!

This was WONDERFUL!!  As others did, I replaced the shortening with 1/2 C unsweetened applesauce and 1/2 C butter, added chopped pecans instead of raisins, and eliminated the milk.  I also increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp and added 1/2 tsp allspice (as someone else did.)  I didn't have instant oats, so used original oats and it worked fine.  This is overall amazing banana nut bread!  I will make this again and again!  My husband absolutely loved it.  It is perfectly moist, not too sweet, and a little crunchy with the nuts. Thank you for your recipe!

Delicious. But I use equal an amount of unsweetened apple sauce in place of the shortening. Often mix it up with walnuts, blueberries, adding a touch of nutmeg and cloves...whatever I have on hand. Has become a family favourite.

The BEST banana but bread ever. I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup of apple sauce, egg whites, crushed pecans, and once ready to baked I added some chocolate chips to the top. I took it work and it was a hit. Will absolutely make again!!

Delicious! Loved this. I love to make banana bread and I had lots of oatmeal in the pantry (good sale!)...so I looked to see if there was a banana oatmeal bread. This was really good. 

I did substitute unsalted butter for the shortening, because I don't care to use shortening. 

The bread was moist and yummy. I'll make this again!

Will make it again. Used only 3/4c sugar,  and 1/4c butter and applesauce instead of shortening. My bananas were medium size and used 4 for super-moist bread. Added 2 scoops of protein powder and white chocolate chips instead of raisins. Also no cinnamon. Turned out great.

...still on the search for a recipe that compares to the boxed banana bread mix that my family loves. - I was hoping this would be it, but I guess I'll have to keep trying. - Great recipe, just not a family fav :(

I use softened butter as the shortening, and be sure to beat the eggs before adding them to anything, and I use 1 1/4 C of gluten-free cup-4-cup flour instead of regular, and 1 1/2 C mashed bananas was 3 medium bananas, and I added 1/4 C chopped pecans and 1/2 cup chocolate chips instead of the raisins, and it can make 18 muffins which take 15-20 minutes to bake. The muffins freeze (and thaw) well. I am not a huge banana bread fan, and the oats (and chocolate chips and pecans) tame down the banana taste.

I didn't really have very high expectations for this recipe, since none of my family likes quick cooking oats. I had a 3 lb. package of quick cooking oats that were bought by mistake, so I figured this would be a good way to use them. My family loves this bread. Mom is living with us now and is diabetic, so after the first loaf I tried using a sugar substitute and no one knew the difference. I make a double batch of this bread at least once a month now and none of it ever goes to waste. Once I was out of shortening so I substituted butter which really added to the depth of flavor. Since my first go around doing the recipe exactly I have tried several variations - I have used King Arthur whole wheat flour, and Old Fashioned rolled oats, I added walnuts to one batch. It's a very versatile recipe and I thank you for making it available.

Pretty good. Used 3 bananas and butter instead of shortening. The instant oats didn't add as much oat texture as I was expecting but it was good. I may add flax next time!

Used butter instead of shorting, omitted eggs due to allergies, and baked them in muffin tin. 
They were a little flat but the taste was amazing

Love this recipe for banana bread.  I like to add butterscotch chips or chocolate chips instead of raisins. For finishing,  I brush the top with jelly (any flavor will do. Currently using lavender-violet jelly) and sprinkle rolled oats on top. If you like more crunch,  add you favorite granola mix on top before cooking.  Brush the top with jelly for a shiny look.

Added oil, chopped walnuts, two more bananas, and substituted some oats for a blend of ground flax and chia seeds (~1/8 cup) and the shortening for butter (I love the KerryGold brand). Try it If you like a heavy, nutty, moist bread. Put cream cheese on it.

As other reviewers mentioned this made a dense banana bread. While it was good it wasn't our favourite banana bread recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and didn't add the optional raisins. I doubt that I will make this again.

One of the best banana breads I've made, changed the quick cooking oats with quick cooking steel cut oats for a healthier bread  and no raisins,next time I think I'll add so chocolate chips to it give it a little sweetness to it

Excellent, I doubled the recipe and the doubled recipe made two loafs and 10 muffins.  When I doubled the recipe, I substituted 1 cup of coconut flour for the 2nd cup of flour.  Instead of adding another cup of butter, I added 1 cup of coconut butter. I added 1/2 cup chopped raw almonds, 1 cup of raisins, 1/4 cup of raw cacao nibs, 1/4 cup ground flaxseed, and used almond milk instead of regular milk. It needed1/4 cup more almond milk. I also added 1 tablespoon more baking powder. The result was moist, the top was crunchy, it rose in the oven, and it got rave reviews!

This banana bread was really good and moist.  I used blueberries instead of raisins and was worried it would be to moist but it was fine. The bread didnt rise much so next time I am going to use baking powder instead of soda.

This is a great recipe.  I doubled it to make 2 loaves.  For my 2 loaves, I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of shortening.  I also added a bit of nutmeg and 1tsp of baking soda.  The bread was moist and just perfect.

Have made many different banana breads but wanted to try one with oatmeal. Subbed butter for shortening and applesauce for milk. I didn't love the flavor (yes I know I changed it). The bread was mushy and undercooked, even after 55 mins of baking. Not making again.  Will go back to my other recipe.

I made this recipe with 1/2 cup of butter instead of shortening and its delicious! I tend to like my banana bread sweeter though so next time I will add an additional cup of brown sugar. I also might try using half butter and half coconut oil as another reviewer suggested instead of shortening.

Love love love this banana bread.  The cinnamon is so good.  I used butter instead of shortening and reduced the sugar a little bit.  I also put in only half as much salt as the recipe called for.

It was moist but not gooey.  Used butter instead of shortening and buttermilk instead of milk. Did not have raisins but added 1/ cup of sunflower seeds. I like that it uses two eggs.

Perfect Banana Bread! I used a half cup of grass fed butter and a half cup of coconut oil to replace shortening. I also blitzed oats with a food processor, added juice of half a lemon and replaced white sugar with coconut blossom sugar. Healthy, fluffy and so delicious!

Didn't use raisins.
Used block marg to grease pans, then used remainder of the 1/2 cup block in the recipe, added 2 tbsp oil.
I replaced vanilla with 1/2 tsp each of almond extract and coconut extract.
Used 2 cups of mashed bananas.
Used the large while cooking flakes oatmeal. Absolutely delicious!

So yummy! My bread did break in half/crumble a little when removing it from the pan - I'll try again with parchment paper and hope it stays together next time. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Just made this & love it. I used an oatmeal mix from Trader Joe's that has quinoa, flax, pepita & chia. Turned out wonderful. I sprinkled the top with about 1 tablespoon of the oatmeal mix for visual effect. I may cut the sugar when I make it again. Can't wait to make muffins out of this.

I used 1/2 cup agave instead of sugar and replaced the oil with apple sauce the second time I made it. My husband and I love nuts and semi sweet chocolate chips in banana bread so I added both.

Instead of shortening I did 1/2C of applesauce and a 1/2C of coconut oil. Added chocolate chips instead of raisins and used 2 bananas. I cooked it for 60 minutes but it could have been cooked for 65-70minutes. Tastes awesome though. Very happy with this.

Brilliant! I used 3 very ripe bananas, added 1/4 c. plain yogurt and only 1/4 c. milk. Delicious and moist. The oatmeal makes it hearty but not heavy. Yum!

Not sure why, but the middle didn't cook well. I preheated for :30 until my oven thermometer said 350 degrees but the middle of the bread was still very mushy.  Also, when trying the outside crust, I found it too sweet...maybe ? c. sugar would have sufficed.

Followed the recipe with slight changes... 
1. One egg
2. One banana (dint want the taste to be dominated by banana)
The output turned out to be very impressive. It was fluffy and crispy top layer. Nuts did top up the bite...

My banana bread always turns out gooey so I decided to try a new recipe. I read the reviews and followed some suggestions. 1/4 c margarine, 1/4 c Applesauce, no shortening. 3/4 c sugar instead of 1c. Sub pecans for the raisins. I also left out the milk because the batter seemed fine without it and my goal was not gooey. I used 2 large bananas but didn't measure them. made 12 muffins. Baked about 18-20 mins. They're perfect. And not too awful on calories - compared to my old recipe at least. This is my new go to for banana bread.

This recipe is very moist and filling! The family loved it and it made a great loaf! I personally have not baked bread a lot and was surprised at how well it turned out. I definitely will make again and suggest any who haven't tried it already, does. Thank you for the recipe and I hope this was helpful.

This is absolutely delicious! I don't buy shortening, so I used a stick of butter. I'll definitely make them again.

One of my very favorite banana bread recipes--crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside...perfect.  I used regular oats (not quick), increased vanilla, substituted butter and used half brown sugar and half white sugar (and about 3/4 cup instead of one cup overall).  No raisins...I just don't like them.  I use 3 or 4 bananas. I also added ground flax seed for a little extra nutritional value.  Terrific recipe and thanks for sharing.

Very moist and loads of banana flavor, and the oats gave it such a nice texture.  I used all butter and it was delicious!  I will definitely make it again.

This recipe really stands up on its own, and doesn't need any embellishments. 
However I substituted apple sauce and butter for the shortening to make it moister and added crushed pineapple and pumpkin spice chips one batch and  also use peanut butter chips in another, I'm sure you could add any kind you like.   this one goes in the recipe favorites!

I had 4 over-ripe bananas and too much oatmeal in my cupboard, so this recipe fit the bill! I loved it and will make again. I followed to a T except for: instead of 100g shortening I used about 40g butter and 60g olive oil (I used a scale to measure); I cut the sugar in half, using only 1/2 cup; and I doubled the cinnamon. Took more like 70 minutes to bake for me. Loved the result, thank you!

An excellent recipe!
To make it a bit healthier I used half the amount of recommended sugar, coconut oil instead of shortening, and used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose.
The bread came out super moist, sweet enough and was surprisingly fluffy. Next time I'll add in a handful of sesame seeds for a bit more texture.

Replaced shortening with 1/4 applesauce and 1/4 cup melted unsalted butter.   Reduced salt to 1/4 tsp.  Used a whole tsp cinnamon and a whole teaspoon vanilla.  Mixed the oats with milk and applesauce and let sit for a while before mixing with bananas and other liquid ingredients.  Batter tasted great.   Baking now.

This was great! I did make some substitutions: coconut oil for the shortening, hemp milk for the dairy, 3 frozen (and thawed) medium organic bananas instead of mashing out the cup and a half, and lastly I added 1/3 cup whole golden flax seed to up the fiber and omitted the raisins. The changes fit my family's dietary needs and really complimented the original recipe nicely. Very moist, appropriately dense, soft and delicious.

I have made this several times "as is" and it's GREAT! I love it so much that I wanted to try a lower calorie version so I could eat more! And I couldn't be happier with the results! I too, used 1/2 butter and 1/2 unsweetened apple sauce in place of the shortening. I replaced 1/2 the sugar with Splenda, and used almond milk instead of regular. I threw in some walnuts for heart smart eating. OMG! It's STILL great tasting and now also great for you!

This really is the best! I sometimes make it exactly by the recipe. Sometimes I mix it up a little. Today I made it with melted coconut oil instead of shortening and used spelt flour instead of white flour, and the result was amazing!

I am always a sucker for breads and cakes made with oats so when I had a few overripe bananas hanging about I jumped at this recipe!  This banana bread was moist, tasty, and a total hit with my whole family.  I noticed our fruit bowl has a few "past prime" bananas today and I immediately started pulling out the ingredients for this bread.  I can't wait for my tea and bread tonight!!!

I have made many banana bread recipes over the years. This is my new favorite!  Everyone loved it, old and young. I was a bit short on bananas so added 1/2 cup applesauce. It was even better the next day! I added cinnamon chips instead of raisins, but they were overpowered by banana and unnecessary. I might try the raisins next time. Try this if you get a chance.

Thank you Carolyn for sharing your family recipe, my husband stated this was the best Banana Oatmeal Bread!  I did not have applesauce, so I used 1/2 C. Apple Butter and 1/2 C. butter in place of the shortening, Almond Milk in place of regular Milk, Egg Beaters, 3/4 C. Sugar, 4 small bananas was just over 1 1/2 C. bananas, 1 tsp. Cinnamon, 1/2 C. chopped walnuts, and sprinkled sugar on top before baking.  I sprayed my loaf pan, and then placed a piece of parchment paper on the bottom of the loaf pan, sprayed the parchment and sprinkled that with a dusting of flour.  Baked for 65 minutes, tented at 45 minutes.  We tasted a slice of the bread while still warm, and I thought it might have been under cooked as a little mushy in the middle, even though the knife came out clean when tested.  I let it cool completely and it is now "set" and very moist.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This is a very versatile recipe.  While I know that not everyone appreciates reviews of recipes when changes are made, I felt I should let everyone know that this one is a good base.  After promising my kids that we'd make muffins, I realized we were short on ingredients.  I scrapped the original recipe, found this, made some substitutions and it worked great!  We made half a batch and got 24 mini-muffins (took about 12 minutes to bake).  We used softened butter for the shortening, brown sugar for the white sugar, no vanilla (I was out), no milk (how'd I miss that?!), pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon (heaping), pumpkin for the banana, and chopped apple for the raisins (about double the amount - I'm sure this moisture made up for the missing milk).  So we ended up with Autumn Muffins (per my 7 year old) and they are very good.  I can't wait to try the recipe the way the original chef intended it...then again, it's fun to experiment too :D

This is by far my favourite recipe for Banana bread.  I only had 1/4 cup left of shortening though, so I substituted the other half with margarine.  I also added 1/4 cup of fresh blueberries instead of raisins. It was absolutely delicious.  I have printed this for my personal book and will definitely be making this one a lot.

Made these as muffins. They were delicious! Would be better with walnuts. Also, I didn't have enough bananas so I added a dollop of sour cream.

Best banana bread recipe EVER! This is my very favorite recipe for banana bread as it is written. But today I found out at the last min I was out of cinnamon. I substituted some pumpkin pie spice a little ginger and a little nutmeg. It is even better!

This bread was wonderful and I love the texture the oatmeal gave it, I did tweak the recipe like others, I used 1/4 c of applesauce and 1/4 c of coconut oil, I also used 1 tsp of vanilla.  I made the batter and added 1/2 c of walnuts, poured out 1/2 the batter in a smaller loaf pan. Then I added 1/4 chopped dates to the remaining and poured that into a smaller loaf pan. My family doesn't like dates, but my boyfriend does. Hence 2 loafs.  I cooked those for 45 mins and they were done.  This is a keeper for me.

As I refuse to use shortening or lard, I substituted butter. 
Made this in a muffin tin as I needed it to be portable.
I also added 1/2 cup cocoa powder and peanut butter chips.  If you are worried about it being dry, you can add more banana and a touch more milk. These turned out very moist - reeses peanut butter cups meet bananas - yum!

AMAZING! Loved this recipe! I changed 1/2 t. cinnamon to 1/4 t. cinnamon and 1/4 t. nutmeg. I didn't have a full 1 1/2 c. banana so just added about 1 T. more milk. Old fashioned rolled oats worked just fine. I also added 1/3 c. sliced almonds with the chopped raisins. I knew there was more batter than a loaf pan so used a greased 8x8 pan and adjusted the cook time to 43 minutes. It came out perfectly. I love love love this banana bread!

Just tried this out in order to get rid of some old bananas and this is pretty good! I used 3 bananas and followed the recipe, but used a little less sugar (around 3/4 cups)and added walnuts. This was still a bit too sweet for my taste, but it's not bad. I love the crispiness of the top and edges the best, and it's very moist inside! Good recipe.

I've used a few different recipes for banana bread recently and this one is my favorite. Even my nightmare apartment oven managed to produce a tasty loaf of moist, golden-brown bread. I followed the recipe exactly and my only gripe is that it was a little sweeter than I like banana bread to be, so I'll cut back the sugar by a quarter cup next time.

This recipe is awesome.  I added flax and walnuts at the end.  I also made them into muffins and baked them for 30 minutes at 350. I will definitely be using this as my go to banana bread recipe.  Thanks for sharing! :)

Followed the recipe.  Yummy! I added 1/2 cup chopped walnut instead of raisins.  I also used old fashioned oats, instead of quick cooking.  Cooked for 57 minutes and it may have been a little too long.

I made this using some healthy modifications- used maybe 2/3 or 3/4 cup of sugar, 3/5 BIG bananas, and whole wheat flour. I also used butter because I don't have shortening. And I added chocolate chips, because chocolate is good for the soul. I also used flaxseed substiute (1 T ground + 3 T water = 1 egg) for the egg. And like others have said, my bread didn't rise very well- it rose a little and fell. Tastes delicious still. However, I was wondering if the recipe ought to call for baking powder instead of soda..?

This is a great recipe if you like oats or a texture like nuts in your banana bread. I substituted the shortening with unsweetened applesauce except for 2 1/2 tblsp. unsalted butter, used liquid eggs for the eggs, and used only 3/4 cup sugar. I only used 2 medium bananas, did not add the salt and only some of the milk. The bread baked very well and even with a wonderful aroma and was very moist and delicious. This is a healthier recipe (minus the shortening) than some other versions. My hubby loved it saying the texture of the oats offset not having any nuts in it. I personally don't like nuts in my deserts and this is a good alternative if you don't either but next time I will decrease the amount of oats used since I think it has a little too much. Otherwise it's really good!

Best banana bread I ever made. Moist and light. I replaced shortening with butter and added mini chocolate chips. My kids can't get enough of it. I doubled the ingredients and made 2 loaves and baked about 65 min.

This is good.   I didn't feel like getting out the beater to cream shortening and butter, so I subbed canola oil.  The result was a fairly wet dough, so I omitted the milk.  I also subbed chocolate chips for the raisin. Topped with oats before baking which gave it a nice toasted oat flavor and slight crunch.

I was looking for an easy Oatmeal Banana Bread recipe which this is definitely not, but the little time it takes is very much worth it.  I set out all my ingred. last night.  It's like a big oatmeal cookie, all crunchy on top. I love it.  I made a glaze of oj, pow.sugar and butter - just a little of each (didn't want icing), and drizzled after the 5 minute covered period.  It's so good, love it, definitely going to file it!

Great bread. Used butter in place of shortening (1 cube plus 2 T), added 1/2 cup chopped pecans and golden raisins. Used 3 bananas. Baked about 25 minutes in 9x9 square cake pan. Didn't find the loaf pan and it's so moist that I thought it might have been difficult to slice as a loaf. Loved it!

Smashing success! I took the advice of some of the other reviews and substitute 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 butter for the shortening. My fiance couldn't get enough! He actually finished the entire loaf in about 2 days. He apparently shared some with a co-worker who has already asked him when I'll be making it again.

This recipe is very simple and tasty. The loaves are not too sweet. I added 1 cup pecans instead of 1/2 cup raisins (I like nuts), and 1/2 cup butter instead of 1/2 cup shortenning. Turned out great. Looks nice if you sprinkle the loaf with some oatmeal :)

Just made this and it is wonderful, wonderful, wonderful! Used walnuts instead of raisins and doubled the recipe. My Mom and I didn't even let a speck of batter go to waste. The bread is done now, warm, and delicious. It's a little crumbly and I'll be greasing the pan better next time, but the 8 strap pan size loaves will probably be gone in no time.

Excellent tasting loaf!  I love the texture of the oatmeal and the feeling that it`s healthy to eat! I use 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce in place of the shortening and I use Splenda in place of the sugar. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Awesome!  Used butter instead of shortening, chocolate chunks and cut the sugar with splenda, half and half.  Didn't save all that many calories in the end, but didn't hurt the flavour any!  Great recipe!

Excellent! I used half quick and half regular oats. Next time I will not use quick at all, I like the texture of regular oats best.  I added mini chocolate chips.  Really good flavor and texture!!  It makes a large loaf and I probably over cooked it just a bit to make sure the center was done.  I will cut the cooking time next time by a few minutes for sure next time.

This was a great bread!  I used splenda and I added a cup of sugar free chocolate chips in place of the nuts and raisins.  This bread is a keeper!

Not bad. It was kinda greasy, a little bland, kinda flat. I think with some small tweaks, this recipe will turn out to be much better.

Made it with the raisins and it was excellent!  I plan to try it again with dates instead of raisins, and maybe some fresh raspberries another time.

I used French Vanilla coffee creamer instead of milk and it was delicious.  I also followed the other comments of subbing out the shortening for applesauce and butter.  The whole thing turned out well.  Good recipe!

Great flavor, and very moist. I used 3/4 cup white sugar, and 1/4 cup brown, the slight maple flavor goes great with the cinnamon and oatmeal.

This made a wonderful moist and tasty bread.  A bit crumbly when cutting, but a delicious way to use oatmeal into a staple recipe of mine.  My family loved it, and I shared it with my co-workers and they loved it too.  2 thumbs up!

Love the oats and the very banana-y taste, but this comes out very sweet, too sweet for me. I used wholewheat flour, with a little extra raising agent, to up the healthy factor, and next time I'll cut down the sugar, and try apple sauce or plain yoghurt as a sub for some of the fat. But basically - yum!

Very Tasty! Only reason it got 4 stars is I think 350 for 50 minutes was too much, it got REAL brown, verge of being burnt. I also used butter instead of shortening. Love how the top is a nice crunchy texture and the bread remains very moist.

This is awesome banana bread! I love the texture of the bread with the oatmeal in it. I used butter instead of shortening, reduced the sugar and didn't sift the dry ingredients. I will be making this often.

Yum!!!  Came out really moist.  I read some reviews and only made a slight change.  Instead of all shortening, I used 1/4 cup butter flavored shortening, and 1/4 cup applesauce.  And I like raisins so I put in a whole cup.  Will definitely be making this again.

Does anyone know the calorie count on this recipe using Splenda? I made a loaf using sugar & another using Splenda. Both taste great! I just need the calorie count if anyone knows. Thanks!

My husband adored this bread. It comes out thick and moist. Raisins are a nice treat. For the bananas, I substituted 1/3 of the quantity with cinnamon applesauce.

"BOB" is great.  I followed the advice of a previous comment to sub applesauce and butter and it turned out really well.  It didn't rise as much as I would have liked, but the taste was good and hearty.  Made a very good breakfast bread.

Very tasty, I did everything just as instructed, though I did not measure the banana.  I just mashed the 6 that I needed to use and added it to the bowl.  Delicious and moist, a HUGE hit around here, even with my picky 3 year old.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Just pulled this out of the oven and after cooling a short bit, sliced into our first piece. YUMMY!  I stuck with the reviews and used 1/2c apple sauce and 1/2c butter.  I only had 2 ripe bananas on hand so that's what I used.  The flavor and texture is great, but I could see adding more bananas the next time around to give it more of a banana taste.  Because I only had 2 bananas I added some extra milk to keep it moist.  The consistency was perfect.  The bread does come out looking dark, but it didn't affect the taste at all.  Definitly a great recipe!
