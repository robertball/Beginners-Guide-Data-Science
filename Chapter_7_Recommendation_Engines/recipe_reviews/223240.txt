The texture was a little weird and the flavor was different. The worchestershire sauce really gave it flavor. I used quick cook oats instead though.

I substituted Fat Tire Ale for the beef broth and soy sauce for the Worchestershire (out of necessity, not out of of creativity, and I loved it.  Ate it over mashed turnips.

A very simple recipe but it just says home to me! I grew up eating my gran's mince just like this. I like the addition of the Worcester sauce.

This was a good place to start, but it was fairly bland. I added a couple of minced garlic cloves, and a lot more pepper. I also had to add about 1/2 cup of water 15 or so minutes into simmering because there was almost no liquid left and the oats were still hard.

I made this because my husband requested oatmeal for dinner and I didn't want "same old, same old".  I followed the directions but had to add a 1/2 cup of water.  It is a bland dinner, though with the right spices it would be REALLY good!!  As it is, it wasn't so bad on it's own.  The old man liked it! :)  It definitely leaves room for improvement!  I served this with sweet peas.
