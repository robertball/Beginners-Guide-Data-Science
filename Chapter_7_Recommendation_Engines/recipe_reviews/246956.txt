Super tasty! It is pretty time consuming, but I chose to make the green sauce the day before and that helped a lot with prep.  I had some leftover smoked pork butt and OMG, what an amazing way to use it up! It just added another delicious layer of flavor. I have to admit I was skeptical of the coconut milk, however you don't even taste coconut, and it helps thicken the chili. This definitely needs more than a pinch of salt - adjust to taste, but you're going to need at least 2 teaspoons. I was tempted to add some to the green sauce, however I waited til the end to adjust the salt.  I didn't bother with adding the chicken broth in 2 different steps - I just added 2 cups at once and simmered til it was thickened to my liking, about 45 minutes. I served this as taco filling one night, and will be eating leftovers over rice. Finally, this makes a lot, but you'll be glad it did! Thanks for the great recipe!
