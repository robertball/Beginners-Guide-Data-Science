These were a hit.  A bit different than the recipe I usually use but it worked really well.  It made 9 yorkies instead of the six stated, might have been the size of my muffin tin though.  I served these with a hearty beef stew what a perfect winter dinner.

If you don't have drippings, use real butter.  My husband loves these with our Christmas Rib Roast dinner!

Fantastic, what a no fail recipe!  I have struggled making Yorkshire (or hockey pucks as my Dad would call my previous attempts) and now it's a Sunday staple.  Right after I put the Prime Rib in the oven, I whip this up in the blender and refrigerate.  When the Prune Rib comes out, I put a muffin pan for 12 with 1/4 tsp of the drippings (try using lard or even bacon drippings if you didn't collect any from the roast - real fat makes a huge difference in flavor).  Heat the muffin pan as you raise the temp. in the oven, then take the batter straight from the fridge and pour into the hot fat.  Huge puffy Yorkshires come out 20 minutes later.

I live in England (but from the USA) and have been using my MiL's recipe for 19 years and they've always been so-so. Made this recipe on Friday and they were fabulous! Nicely risen, crispy and delicious.

Great recipe! They rise sky high, be sure to place some foil or cookie sheet underneath your muffin tin as they drippings spill over in your oven and cause smoke.

First time out - no changes to the recipe. However, I would use a muffin tin that had larger spaces (deeper) in order to get a higher "puff" on the pudding. 
This is very similar to a Swedish recipe that I make in a large frying pan - great breakfast with syrup.
I found these are wonderful with a bit of wild honey.

I was very happy with this, but I will toss out this caution-- It's hard to estimate how much these things will rise, spilling the drippings to the bottom of your oven, making gobs of smoke. Maybe put some foil with the sides folded upward to catch the drippings.

These did not turn out for me.  They totally stuck, I could not get them out!  I probably overfilled because oil was leaking out onto the bottom of the oven and smoking.  Flavor was good.  I think they have the right amount of salt.

I made it and it is  very simple. How ever i will now only use 1 tsp of oil or drippings instead of 2. I use bacon fat.

I used canola oil instead of beef drippings as I didn't have any.  Turned out to be the best Yorkshire pudding I have ever made!

This is our go-to recipe when we have a beef roast! Tradition says you have to have Yorkshire Pudding.

I lived in England for years, and came home with 2-4 hole flat Yorkshire pudding pans. This recipe fills my pans perfectly and they come out crispy and light every time. I have never rested the batter, mainly because I don’t remember in time, but the final result does not suffer. I got a great compliment from a British friend who said their were better than his mother’s!

I tripled the recipe and got 6 Texas muffin sized and 12 reg muffin sized Yorkshire puddings. Recommend just covering the bottom of the muffin cups with oil. They are delicious, easy to make and they're a big hit with the family.

Couldn't be simpler. Used olive oil, just to sizzling. Wonderfully easy.
