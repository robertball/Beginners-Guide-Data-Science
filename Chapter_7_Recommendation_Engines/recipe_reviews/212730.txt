This was excellent. Pre-baking the crust made it very crispy. i took it a little further by adding some odds and ends from the fridge. I had about 1.5 oz of dried mushrooms I reconstituted, diced, and sauteed with the onions along with some minced garlic a a small amount of spinach. I also added a small amount smoked dried tomatoes that were julienned. The shredded cheese I had was a mixture of mozzarella, provolone, romano, parmesan and asiago.

Outstanding! My husband and I loved it, and we got our neighbors hooked on it.  The only thing I did differently was use Pillbury's canned pizza dough, since I prefer it over frozen dough.  (Theirs tastes sweeter and reminds me of their cresent rolls).

If you want to get SIX stars, add a little vanilla extract to the softened cream cheese and one packet of Splenda. Mix together before spreading on the pizza. No one will be able to pin point the "secret ingredients" and it's a total winner!

I used pre-baked pizza crusts and added artichoke hearts and Alaskan King Crab, which one would think would take this over the top.  But it was just okay for me, a bit on th boring side, but Hubs called it "pretty 'D' good."  I couldn't tell the cream cheese was even there; perhaps more would have made a difference. I believe caramelizing the onions is inportant, but even that didn't make this pizza stand out in my mind, nor did the addition of the crabmeat or artichokes.  So this was forgettable for me. Hubs enjoyed it, but even he rated it just three stars.

We loved it.  I did not add the red pepper and probably added extra mozzarella because I just topped it and didn’t bother to measure the amount of cheese.  This is a nice change from our usual pizza.  Absolutely delicious – fabulous recipe.  I’ll be making this again.

Delicious!  I had a pre-baked crust so I skipped the first cook time.  Sauteed the garlic with the onions.  I spread the cream cheese over the crust, topped with cobly jack instead of mozzarella cause that's what I had.  I then put the onion garlic mixture on that and topped with parmesan.  I know I made quite a few changes and I usually don't, but I know this would be delicious with the other cheeses too ;)

I followed the recipe exactly and I loved it.  I probably used a bit more mozzerella cheese but the cream cheese was still very tasty and the carmelized onions were wonderful.  The addition of the garlic to the first bake made it so good.  I'll be making this agian.

This type of pizza could have potential, but I thought it tasted more like an onion tart than any pizza I have tried. The onion flavor, definitely dominated the pizza. I basically made it near exact as the recipe. I am not a huge fan of hard cheeses melted. They do not melt well in my opinion. With the amount, it made all of the cheese on top hard, which I expected. I ended up using parmesan which is similar and I thought, for a hard cheese, 1/2 cup was way too much. I thought less than half that amount would have been plenty. The only other change I made was using only 1/4 tsp. of the red pepper flakes. I used whipped cream cheese and low fat mozzarella, but that did not seem to be a problem. I also sprinkled a little cornmeal on the pan, as I usually do with pizza. I can see something similar working as a small appetizer, but not as a pizza taste or texture wise.

This pizza was wonderful. I made my own crust by using another recipe from Allrecipe and it was delicious and filling. Whole family loved it.

This is hands down my favorite pizza. It is sooo good with really carmelized onions and I add a little more crushed pepper than called for. Everyone I've made this for has loved it.

Followed the recipe exactly (though my onions took much longer to caramelize) and it was so delicious!

Wow, what a surprise. Very tasty!  I kept with the ingredients but used a Shredded Italian cheese mix instead of just mozzarella since that is what I had.  Please make sure you use sweet onions to really get the best taste here and don't rush the cooking of them.  For my crust I used the Boboli 100% Whole Wheat. Since this was already cooked, I just added the minced garlic up with the onions during their last 5 minutes, but still brush the crust with the olive oil before added the other ingredients .  It's not your traditional pizza but it is well worth trying! I have to say it again, the sweet onion were terrific.

Omg this was wonderful!! I didn't follow the recipe, but rather used it as a base.  I cooked the bacon & onions in a skillet, then added some roasted red peppers, artichokes, and jalapeños till warm. Spread that on top of my cream cheese. Covered with a pizza blend, cheddar blend, and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese.  Then baked according to crust directions. We ate the whole stinking thing :-)
