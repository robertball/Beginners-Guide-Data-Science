Well, the first time I made this recipe it didn’t turn out that well.  I liked the idea of it so much though, that I decided to try again, with some tweaks.  The first time I used ¾ cup rhubarb and 1 ½ cups water and reduced the water/sugar down to ¾ cup, like the recipe states.  This ended up with way too much watered-down dressing!  So the second time, I used ¾ cup rhubarb and ¾ cup water.  I still cooked the rhubarb for 2 minutes and then removed and put it on the spinach, like the recipe states.  It also doesn’t hurt to leave a few pieces of the rhubarb in the water.  I simmered the water down to ¼ cup (about 10 minutes) – this made it more of a syrup with a more concentrated rhubarb flavor.  I also reduced the vinegar and olive oil to better proportions.  While the water/sugar simmered (without the vinegar), I combined 3 Tbsp. olive oil and 1 Tbsp. vinegar in a container with a lid.  I then took the reduced rhubarb water and poured it in the container and shook vigorously, then poured it over the salad.  Much better!  As written, this is a 3-star recipe.  With my changes, definitely 5-star!  I will make this again!  I’ve written up a custom version of this recipe so you can see my changes.  **UPDATE:  I made this again tonight and decided to serve it cold.  I chilled the cooked rhubarb and dressing, then tossed it with the spinach and some blue cheese, bacon bits and walnuts.  Yum!

This salad sounded a bit bizzaar, but since I had an abundance of spinach and rhubard, I tried it. Wow, it was great-even the hubby said I could make this one again!!!

What a tasty salad!  I followed the advice of another reviewer and cooked 3/4 c rhubarb in 3/4 c water with 1/4 c sugar.  After spooning the rhubarb chunks onto the spinach I cooked down the remaining water until it was about 1/4 c, then added 3 T olive oil and 1 T red wine vinegar.  I poured all of it over the salad and mixed it up. My kids said it tasted like cotton candy!  What a great salad.  I can see using this as a base and adding in a variety of other toppings like boiled egg chunks, bacon bits, nuts, etc.  So glad I found this recipe.

I love this recipe, but 6 tablespoons of olive oil must be a misprint. I lightly drizzled oil over the spinach. I have made it with spinach and Swiss chard, both were delicious. Give it a try but go east on the olive oil. A spinach salad should not have nearly 500 calories.
