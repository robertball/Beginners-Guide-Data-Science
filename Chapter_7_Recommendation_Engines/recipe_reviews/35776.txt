Wonderful recipe!  I've used it for 30 years except I use 5 teaspoons of lemon juice rather than vinegar.  For those of you who are having trouble getting your preserves to set - try a larger pot. If you aren't boiling your preserves "hard" enough they will not set.  NEVER double the recipe and use a large pot rather than a pan.  The preserves must be a rolling boil so that they reach 220 degrees and don't stir them often.  This recipe was given to me 30 years ago by a lady who was 75 and had been given this recipe by her mother.  It works, you just have to have patience and learn how to recognize the signs that the preserves are setting.  Have fun!

I think I may not of got it hot enough. Would that do it? I'm going to use the jars I made as topping for sundae's. Tastes Great!

I've never made preserves before, because I don't know how to can.  However, I had a 1/2 flat of strawberries on my hands so I decided to try making preserves.  This was the recipe with which to start.  Absolutely delicious.  Easy to follow and full of flavor, this recipe tastes like my grandmother's homemade preserves.  What a treat!  The only change I made was pulsing the berries in the food processor briefly, prior to cooking.  I did so that my 14 month old could enjoy the preserves, too.

I don't know what I did wrong. I used 2 lbs of Strawberries I picked up at a U-Pick farm and followed the direction to a T and I ended up with thick strawberry goop. It is two thick to use on toast or sandwichs and doesn't taste like strawberry preserves at all. 

I am now looking for a new recipie to use.

Stephanie thank you so much for adding this recipe to all recipes. All the other recipes I had would have taken a day to do because they called for the mixter to sit 12 to 24 hours, and with a 2 year old I wanted to get in and out of the kitchen as quickly has possible. AND THIS RECIPE MADE IT POSSIBLE, I thank you! I made the preserves today and tasted a strawberry I had lefted in the pot and it was great! Thank you again!!

I now have 14 4oz jars of strawberry ice cream topping!  I let the stuff cook for 40 minutes and I could not get it to reach past 205 degrees on my themometer.

I used apple cider vinegar because...well, why not? The preserves taste delicious, however it did not jell to quite the stiffness I would prefer. Actually, it took a LONG time for the mixture to thicken at all. Better consistency when chilled overnight.

Here's a few TIPS!! I tried this recipe for the 1st time day 5/26/10, which I have never made preserves before. I purchased 6 qt of very ripe strawberries from a local farmer. I followed the recipe to a T, I thought!! Well, IT WOULD NOT SET!  After I had jared it and let it cool down (about 2 hrs), I could tell right then. I reopened the jars, return to pot and recooked. Basically, I started the process over. Tip#1 - Have a thermometer. Tip#2 - Keep it at a Rolling Boil for the FULL 15-20 mins. Tip#3 - Stir and Stir ans Stir.

this is a quick and easy recipe.  I can go to the market for fresh strawberries and have jelly made two hours later.  I have some problem getting it to set to jelly.  3 out of four tries I had to take from jars and set back over the heat, bring to boil and put back into clean jars, maybe this is because I live at a higher elevation and I like to put less sugar than is called for.

Great jam - and very easy! Followed recipe as it is except I used Raspberry Vinegar.  I halved the recipe which I think really helped since there was no chance of boiling over and it didn't even take the full 20 min. I had the stove on full high heat the entire time.  You can tell its done when it completely covers a metal spoon when dipped in and removed and as another reviewer put it "hmmm, this looks like jelly."  Another reviewer had mentioned using a really big pot and I think that helped a lot too.  Excellent recipe!

I tried this recipe and it tastes great.  However, the next time I make it I will crush the berries because they floated to the top of the jars and did not congeal.  As a result, I have strawberries floating around in the top of the jar and jelly at the bottom.  Go figure! haha

I tried this recipe for the first time and had great luck. I had always used surejell and I did not like the texture it felt to rubbery. But this recipe worked great. I did substitute lemon juice for the the vinegar and I loved the taste. It took me awhile to figure out how to get it to set but once I learned it was easy. We use it on ice cream, cakes and bread of course. My family loves it and I will always use this recipe!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Made this recipe this morning.  Was easy and tasted very good. Not sure if it will set up to jam when cooled looks promising but we love syrup almost more than jam so would be ok anyway.

I follow the cooking instructions to a T and this recipe is always a big hit.  I use Apple Cider Vinegar, though, and it works great.  Everyone wants a jar when I am done, so I always double it when the strawberries are in season and on sale.  Super excellent on PB & J's, so my kids say.  I prefer it on biscuits, myself.

What a fantastic recipe. I had about a pound of strawberries that were "hidden" in the back of the fridge. They weren't "bad" but just not "great" to eat fresh. This was the PERFECT use for them. I halved the sugar (since I only had about a pound of strawberries) as well as the vinegar and salt. Cooked and stirred for 15 minutes. Used my thermometer it got to 220 just as I was thinking "hmmm...this looks like jelly". Can't wait for it to cool a bit and have it on an english muffin. Thanks so much for sharing this!

Delicious!  I only had 1/2 lb strawberries, so quartered the recipe--worked great.  Really had to turn up the heat and let it bubble for a while to get it to reach 220.  The poor reviewers clearly did something wrong, as I followed the recipe to the T and am enjoying delicious preserves on some fresh-baked bread for breakfast. Can't be beat.

I made this recipe exactly, and it jelled perfectly.  Can't complain at all!  I think you just have to make sure that it hits that 220 degree mark.  Turned out 4 and a half 8 oz jars.

This is an excellent recipe!  I couldn't get my preserves to get to 220 degrees so I used my stick mixer after they boiled for about 30 minutes.  That made the preserves the PERFECT consistency!  Yummy!

Great recipe and very helpful comments section.  I went all in with 6 lbs of strawberry which my family picked fresh from the fields this past weekend.  Some were getting a bit soggy and squishy so i thought it was the perfect time to make preserves (my first time).  First thing i did was cut the green tops off and sliced each strawberry in half.  Then i washed/soaked everything.  I had white distilled vinegar but opted to use apple cider vinegar as some had advised in the comment section.  But I couldnt bring myself to use anywhere near 15 cups of sugar for this batch.....i wouldnt be able to look my doctor in the eye if i did!  So instead i used 4 cups of white granulated sugar, less than a cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of honey.  Then i got to cooking.  The sugar and fruit started to liquefy almost immediately.  My pot boiled over just a little bit in the beginning so i had to cook with the lid off for almost 30 minutes at max heat (gas stove). I could tell it had not set yet because it was still too liquidy as i was stiring the pot every few minutes or so just so i could keep tabs on the progress and to prevent future boilovers .  So i put the lid back on the pot and lifted it ever so often to prevent boilovers but also so i could stir the preserves with a large wooden spoon.  The preserves wouldn't get hot enough with the lid off but it it sure did with the lid on.  Within 20 minutes of putting the lid on the preserve turned from a light fruit punch red to deep crimson re

I used fresh lemon juice instead of vinegar, and lemon peels. I love it. I'll make more and give it out as gifts.

I followed directions very closely and for some reason it did not get thick at all.  Had to throw away.  Wondering if I should have mashed the strawberries instead of leaving them whole?

Getting ready for the fair and I wanted a simple recipe that doesn't use pectin.  This was incredibly easy and fast.  I used this exact recipe but substituted a 2/1/1 ratio of strawberries/blackberries/blueberries to make a triple-berry preserve.  I also used a very large heavy pot and lemon juice.  Do not start timing until the mixture is a full rolling boil.  Not just a rolling boil in the middle.  I start the timer when I see a bit of foam start to form.  It took exactly 20 minutes and my thermometer reached 218 degrees.  It may be off a degree or two.  I can usually tell by sight when preserves are ready, but with the triple-berry combo I wanted to get a temp on it to be sure.   You will get great results if you follow these tips.

This was so easy and turned out great! At first it seemed to not set well, but after the waterbath and resting for 12 hours, it was quite thick.

So I definitely give this 5 stars! It takes superb!  A couple of important things:  1.  Make sure you get it to 220°! That's a must!  I put a plate in the freezer and when we tried the first batch, we did the plate test (101 canning) and put a little of the preserve on the plate, waited a minute and if it smeared and didn't run back together, it was done.  2. Follow the recipe!  We didn't use vinegar, but Lemon juice and it came out awesome!  I'd read some of the other reviews and preferred Lemon juice.  Very pleased with the results, just don't let it boil over.  Scraping carmelized sugar off your stove top sucks!!! LOL  Use Lemon Juice to help break down the sugar, takes a while but it works.  Will definitely use this one again.
