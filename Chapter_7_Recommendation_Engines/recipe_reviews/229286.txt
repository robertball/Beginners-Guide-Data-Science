These were THE BEST! My younger brother was so excited when I told him I was making these, instead of "those nasty chocolate chip muffins!" I did make some changes and substitutions, though. I didn't have raspberry extract, so I used almond instead. I also used two cups of raspberries instead of one, and made an icing to go on top. The recipe is below if anyone is interested.
Icing
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar,
3/4 teaspoon almond extract 
3 teaspoons milk

Combine all ingredients well. Drizzle over warm muffins.

Good taste in spite of the fact that the liners (and I rarely use them) all stuck horribly to the muffin.  If I were to use them again with this recipe, I would spray the inside of the paper liners.  Would have liked a little more chocolate flavor, so I'll probably increase the chocolate chips to 3/4 cup, but that's a personal taste preference.  The best part of the muffin definitely is the burst of fresh raspberry flavor that you get.  That's what will keep me coming back.

These were a hit and disappeared quickly. I did substitute chocolate chips instead of white chocolate because we didn't have the latter. I was disappointed because the streusel topping "sprinkled" on the top all fell off the muffin and baked onto the pan. Just be sure and pat it into the muffin mix with a spoon before baking.

delicious! I have some raspberries that I needed to use.   never made raspberry muffins before and I don't have good experience making muffins I tried this recipe and it turned out better then I was expecting. fluffy, delicate and sweet muffins. I add 2 cups of raspberries because I wanted to use all I have left and replace the raspberry extract for almond extract as other suggested because I didn't have the other ingredient. I didn't do the crumble top because I don't think I need that and it was perfect. I am so happy I gave it a try. I will keep it in my recipe box. thanks for the recipe!

Wow, these may be the best muffins I have ever had, including those expensive muffins available at coffee shops.  I used frozen raspberries and they were fine.  I suggest pressing individual frozen raspberries (4-5 per muffin) into the already-filled muffin cups so as not to end up with pink batter.  As much as I loved them, I could not have eaten three :-).

Absolutely delicious! I used Pam baking spray on the non stick muffin cups and they came out of the molds perfect.  Will make again. This is a keeper in my recipe box. Thanks for sharing.

Over all the muffins were great but I didnâ€™t find raspberry extract so I made them with lemon instead I my self think the recipe should include. Lemon extract l only youse 1 half tablespoon and I doubled the chocolate chips  I highly recommended this recipe for anyone especially people how love raspberry

Truly deserves the 5 stars!  I made the recipe and then made it again as small loaves.  Just watched the time closely and it took maybe 5 minutes longer - YUM

So delicious! I wish I had white chocolate chips, but only had semi-sweet. They were amazing.  Definitely a keeper!

These we're well received. The recipe description was only slightly confusing. I tried pressing a raspberry directly in the top of the muffin on a few for cosmetic reasons and it looked great with no negative effects on baking.

I would make these again with only minor ingredient changes. very nice!

These were excellent.  Like other reviewers, I used almond extract, instead of raspberry extract.  I hesitated at the "1 tablespoon baking powder", but did as the recipe said.  The muffins are absolutely outstanding!

The muffins came out just  delicious!  I used dark chocolate chips, which tasted so wonderful with the raspberries.  I will definitely make these again.

Really delicious.  Everyone loved them.  The crust on the top made it.  1 tablespoon of baking powder may have been too much as they overflowed.

I NEVER write reviews but these are worthy of a review!! The photos do not do justice! I followed the recipe exactly as written except I did not have raspberry extract and they still turned out amazing!! I would probably add another 1/4 cup of white chocolate chips next time since raspberries were tart! Seriously, make these!! They are sure to please anyone!!

These were great the first day!  I had one two days later and it was a bit dry but still good.  Used almond extract since I didn't have raspberry.  Easy and different than normal muffins I make.  I'll make again.
