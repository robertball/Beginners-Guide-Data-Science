EXCELLENT! I used a 4 cheese blend instead of the horseradish cheddar and rubbed the mushrooms w/ evoo, salt, pepper and a little garlic powder before cooking. The bruschetta topping is wonderful and just made these burgers perfect in every way! I served these on 'Soft Onion Sandwich Rolls' also from this site. I will def be making these again and again! Thanks, Andy, for sharing this awesome recipe! :)

We Loved the combination, very tasty. My hubby does not eat bread, so we did this instead; followed the recipe and as the 'shrooms were grilling we grilled 2 Turkey Burger patties as well (seasoned to taste). After heating the 'shrooms and topping we laid the burgers on top then added the cheese, we used shredded Cheddar/Jack as we are not horseradish fans. Had to cook up another batch as hubby ate his before I could get salad to the table, it smelled so good, he couldn't wait! We didn't miss the bread at all. Thanks for another way to fix up our favorite 'shroom.

I added quinoa to add some protien to this dish and it was delicious. I made a version for my daughter without garlic and she loved it as well.

This is delicious. I made it exactly as stated in the recipe. I feel like the horseradish cheddar was the wrong cheese for this. I love horseradish, but the flavors didn't work for me. I think asiago or mozzarella would be much better for this and will use that next time. I also think it would be much better without the bun. Just serve the mushroom filled with the delicious tomato basil salad and top with a delicious Italian cheese pair it with a side salad. Yummmmm My husband said he would like it much better with a 1/4lb burger under the mushroom and all the goodies haha

These were very good. I had some nice mozzarella cheese and used that instead of the Parmesan since my boys were eating with us and don't like Parmesan, but we did put a bit on ours along with the Mozzarella. My basil and tomatoes were fresh from the garden and we added some onion slices. Unfortunately we did not have the optional mustard topping, so made my own topping. We served on rye bread since that is all we had. These are very filling, you'll be surprised how one burger will fill you to the gills. Great dinner for a hot summer night.

Wow!  This recipe is awesome.  I made a few changes - we do not have a grill so I cooked on the stove at medium to low heat for the same time recommended in the recipe and brushed the top of the mushroom with olive oil.  I did not use fresh basil but that didn't seem to make a huge difference.  Lastly, I toasted the bun which I think really added to the burger.  I still can't get over how good this was...may be my new favorite meal!!

Ok...this was so good...and I went "Bun-less" for carb reasons....never the less...yummy! I loved the bruschetta and never thought to add grated cheese to it... I used Pecorino Romano instead of the Parm. I also used provolone instead of the horsey-cheddar that I could not find. The bruschetta is an and most appropriate topping for the shrooms. Loved it...once again...bet even better if I could have bitten into a wonderful roll....but my hips told me not to....lol....nice job CNM...will be making again.....great combo of flavors! Thanks!

Easy and so yummy!  This is the first time I've made portobellas, and I was in a rush...made the topping but used garlic powder...didn't have cheese, and cooked on the stove top, covered for 15 minutes.  Even my picky mushroom hating daughter liked it!

After tasting these at our daughters I decided to try it with friends - - success - - they also enjoyed them.  Used Italian seasoning instead of basil and topped it with a slice of provolone.  I love them with or without a roll.  Easy and elegant recipe!!

We cooked these in a grill pan on the stove because it was raining and as another reviewer mentioned had enough toppings for 4 mushroom caps.  Added Italian blend cheese to the caps towards the end, but no other changes.  Very tasty and will be making again.  Could easily skip the cheese for a vegan option.

This recipe was awesome!  My parents and boyfriend all loved it.  

Just note that this recipe makes waaaaay more filling than for just 2 mushroom caps (I doubled the recipe as I was making four portobellas and I ended up having a ridiculous amount of bruschetta leftover).

This is the first mushroom "burger" I've ever had and it was delicious! We didn't have parmesan or horseradish cheddar in the house so we used mozzarella instead. We also don't own a grill so we cooked the mushrooms in the oven for 15 minutes at 350, before and after adding the bruschetta mixture. I took the advice from another reviewer and toasted the buns. Glad I did because the "burger" was a little juicy and it would've soaked regular bread. This was surprisingly filling, all I needed was an ear of corn to feel satisfied. Great recipe, thanks for sharing. :)

Super good! The  bruschetta topping is really easy and delicious. It's a perfect addition for the portobellos. I cooked these on an inside countertop grill, which didn't take as long. I did gill-side down for about 5 minutes, then gill-side up for 8, then added the topping and covered with a wok lid for about 5 or 6 minutes.  They turned out great. Served with some oven fries and fresh cantaloupe slices.

I used Ciabatta bread for mine just because I couldn't find the bread that the recipe called for, I also ended up using basil paste and it still came out great! Next time I make it I'll use fresh basil. I can't wait to see how great it comes out then.

These were absolutely wonderful.  My daughter is vegan, so we omitted the parm cheese and sprinkled on her version of "cheese"-- ground cashews mixed with nutritional yeast...not a bad substitute.  Also, we did not top with cheese...no need.  Very satisfying.

Based on the changes I made I gave it 4 rather than 5. Im sure if you follow the recipe to a T you will love it. I have no grill so I sautéed mine. The mushroom was incredibly soggy and soaked the buns. I also only used mozz cheese because thats all I had. Bruschetta is amazing.

I recently quit eating meat, and this really satisfied my burger craving. It was delicious! Even my carnivore husband enjoyed it, although (like another reviewer's husband) he said it would have been even better on top of a beef burger! I only made slight changes, omitting the garlic, adding a little roasted red pepper, and using diced fresh mozzarella in the bruschetta in lieu of either of the other cheeses. The grilling time might be too long as posted, so just watch it depending on your grill. I cooked it less time, and it came out perfect!

Awesome! My hubby made it vegan by using soy cheese. It made more than the amount of bruschetta needed. Brilliant idea. Thanks!
