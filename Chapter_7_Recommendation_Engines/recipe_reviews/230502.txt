I used some celery instead of the fennel.  I also didn't have marjoram, so I used the same amount of italian seasoning.  Because we have some hearty eaters (teenage boys!) I also increased the veggies, which made it a larger meal.  Even the 10 year old devoured it!  Easy, fast (with a processor to slice veggies) and delicious!

little bland so i added some red pepper flakes and ground Italian spices.  My friends hates fennel but she didn't even notice it was in the dish so I just let her keep eating.
