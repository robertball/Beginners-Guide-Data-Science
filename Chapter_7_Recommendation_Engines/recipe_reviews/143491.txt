These shrimp were so tasty!  I don't like hot fruit, so I did not use the apples on the skewers, but didn't want to lose out on the apple flavor, so I added 1.5 T. of applesauce to the marinade (apple juice works, too), and used brown sugar instead of white.  Let the shrimp marinate 2 hours, threaded them onto skewers, boiled the marinade 3 minutes to use for basting, and they were out of this world!  I served them with garlic butter rice and sauteed zucchini.... delicious, delicious dinner!

GREAT shrimp! I pretty much followed the recipe except I made a little more of the marinade by adding a bit more of this and that accordingly and I also added salt to taste, and I used 2 lbs of frozen uncooked large white shrimp that were peeled & deveined. I thawed them in cool water, tossed with the marinade & made the rest of dinner. Threw them on the 'barbie' and they were perfect. Only use fresh basil please, and double the basil amount. YUM!!!! I also made them again about a week later and I sauteed' them in a hot skillet over the stove. They were great! Cokking them this way only took about 2 minutes, and I seared them along with the marinade.

I didn't change anything about this recipe except to use hubby's homemade, roasted pepper hot sauce instead of red pepper flakes & to double the marinade, reserving half. I plated the spears, after grilling, on a bed of grilled asparagus spears & drizzled the skewers & the asparagus w/ the reserved marinade. You're going to need extra sauce to drizzle on the skewers (they weren't nearly as flavorful w/out it) so you might as well grill up some asparagus, because it's wonderful on it as well. I started the meal off w/ grilled, prosciutto-wrapped figs w/ a balsamic reduction, Sweet Seductions (a drink recipe from allrecipes), the shrimp & apple skewers & asparagus & grilled corn (kept it very simple...just added butter & salt after grilling. The buttery/salty flavor was a great complement to the sweet/tangy flavor of the shrimp & apples). Homemade spritz cookies for dessert. We were still raving about dinner over coffee this morning! Thansk for an outstanding recipe, MOONROZE!

Wow, phenomenal! I marinaded the shrimp for about 1.5 hours- omitting the sugar and using fresh raspberries and whole fruit preserves. I served my kids and went into the house to grab the salad. By the time I returned to the outside table, my 2-year old son had already eaten an entire skewer of shrimp and apples. He begged for more! Definitely use this again and again! Goes great with fresh salad, berries, and spinach!

I think this is one of the best things I have ever cooked on allrecipes. I did this for a get together I had in my back yard. I also did another recipe for shrimp skewers that had zucchini and onions on them. Those were good, but couldn't compare to these and since we didn't have enough, everybody was fighting over these! Things I changed:  I let them marinate for a lot longer, like 2-3 hours. And  I doubled the marinade recipe, I had huge shrimp, and I usually always end up doubling it any recipe that has a marinade. Good thing I did or it wouldn't have been enough. One last thing, we added pineapple because we happened to have a bunch in the fridge and I knew it would be good, and it was. I think the amount was around 2 cups, but I can't be sure...about as much as the apple amount. You need to add pineapples to this for sure!

Great recipe! My husband and I make this whenever we have company. I have used both lemon juice, and lime juice, and both turned out great. Very simple, delicious, and looks nice for company. Definitely recommended!

Loved this recipe...I also followed it closely but subsituted orange vinegar for the red wine vinegar and left the shells on the shrimp to reduce the chance of 'over-grilling'.  I would definitely make this again.

The shrimp had a WONDERFUL flavor but the apples all broke off the skewers as they cooked on the grill.  Next time I'm going to grate apple into the marinade for the flavor but omit it from the skewers, leaving only shrimp.  Then serve with a great salad and egg potato salad.

Best. Shrimp. Ever!! I've made this multiple times for dinner parties, for boyfriends, and for family functions and it is a huge hit every time. Mostly I have followed the recipe exactly, a couple times I have substituted a small amount of dried basil when I did not have fresh and it was still tasty. I've also used various different kinds of apples and it is still good. This is my number one go-to recipe when I need to impress guests! Excellent all around. Thanks so much for sharing!

This is one of the best marinades that I have ever had on shrimp. the combination of sweet and spicy really make this shine. I've done this with chicken, scallops and shrimp. Everyone that has tried this keeps telling me I have to give them the recipe.

My son loved these!  I used rice vinegar, lime juice, pepper sauce because that is what I had on hand.  It is fall in New England, so the apples were nice and fresh.  I boiled down the leftover marinade for a basting sauce.  Only problem, the grill got pretty messy.

This was quite unique and tasty! Since it is winter, I baked these in the oven on skewers at 400 degrees for about 8 minutes. The apples were so tender and the shrimp just right.

wow!  made it as a freezer meal - tossed it all in the marinade in a freezer bag and froze it.  took the bag camping - skewered the shrimp and apples when thawed and grilled.  it was delicious!  apples were a little soft to thread because they had been frozen, but the final results were fabulous anyway!

Very good recipe! I left mine in the fridge for 3 days (we had some unexpected events occur). It was wonderful! I ommited the apples and just did the shrimp. I used 1 pound of raw frozen shrimp, defrosted them, and marinated them in the same bag the shrimp came in. Great taste- better than Red Lobster! Just be careful not to over cook- easy to do at night when the light is bad :) Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe, it has the perfect mix of sweet and spicy.  I made this without the skewers and would recommend starting to cook the apples prior to the shrimp as they take a while longer also make some extra sauce to use after it's done on the grill.

Only had cocktail/cooked shrimp so that's what I used. Did not use the apples, and the grill wasn't working to I ended up baking these on a foil-lined cookie sheet in a 350 degrees F oven for about 5-10 minutes. The marinade was delicious, I would like to use it on other seafoods and meats. My four year old gobbled this up.

Best shrimp skewers I've had in a long time. I omitted the sugar and they were fantastic - not sure what the sugar would have brought to the dish since the jam already makes it sweet. I halved (width-wise) the 1/8 apple wedges since I was breaking skewers to get the apples on in their original humongous state. I followed advice of others and put the skewers through the skin - so i didn't have any problem with them falling off on the grill. And the apples were delish - I wouldn't omit them.

LOVE this recipe!  Used Fuji apples instead (what I had), so the apples were a little more crisp, but still good.  Loved how the sweet parts of the marinade somewhat carmelized on the shrimp.  My husband couldn't stop raving about this recipe, will definitely make again!

Excellent!!! Made shrimp & apple and chicken & apple skewers. The key to keeping the apples on the skewers is to make sure to you go through the skin of the apple slices length wise. I didn't have strawberry preserves so I used seedless blackberry... Excellent flavor!!!

My family and I loved this recipe, even my 2 kids who are very picky eaters.  The marinade was a wonderful mix of flavors.  I loved it so much that tonight I'm going to try the marinade on grilled chicken.  This recipe is a definite keeper.

Thank you for sharing it.

I've made these twice in the last couple weeks because it's so good.  I would've never thought that apples and shrimp would go together, but this recipe kicks butt!  My husband hates most fruit, and he ate all his apples!

YUM. I used homemade strawberry0balsamic jam, dried basil (2 tsps.), garlic powder and apple cider vinegar as subs for the ones listed. Everything else was used/made as-is. Would make again.

I really enjoyed this! Like others mentioned, I grated apple right into the marinade and then based the shrimp with extra marinade on the BBQ

Wow, this was delicious! I followed everything, except I used 1/4 c. apple juice instead of actual apples. My favorite shrimp recipe so far. We didn't have a bit left!

This was the first recipe I tried from this site.  I followed it exactly except I left the peels on the shrimp due to someone's suggestion.  It was very good and I'll definitely keep this recipe for the future.

This was really good. Feel free to subsitute and of the ingredients that you don't have on hand, we didn't even have sugar, so I used brown sugar.
Just don't over cook your shrimp thinking that the apples are ready(I only buy gala so I was thrilled this recipe called for gala) and they turned out great too. Served with a plain salad with bacon and red pepper italian dressing salad. will prepare again. Thanks for submitting the recipe

This recipe is a keeper!!!  The shrimp and apples were perfect.  We enjoyed this meal quite a bit.  I did omit the sugar, so I guess I didn't follow the recipe to a T but I'm sure it was close.

Fabulous marinade.  I marinated shrimp for about 4 hrs. and they truly absorbed the flavor. As recommended, I doubled the recipe and used the next night on chicken. Guests loved it and asked for the recipe!  Will remain on my "favorite" list for sure.

Based on some other reviewer's suggestions, I added 2 TB of applesauce to marinade and used brown sugar instead of white.  I used fresh basil and doubled the amount.  I marinated the shrimp for about 2 hours, then sauteed them in a hot skillet over the stove.  Loved the taste, thanks Moonroze!

This was an excellent recipe.  We plan to figure out some type of sauce that could be made with the marinade ingredients to use over the rice we served it with.

This is wonderfully different dish, and so easy to prepare! I was a bit skittish on the hotness of the red pepper flakes, even with the strawberry jam, so I substituted a nice red and green pepper jelly instead. I also added chicken just because the sauce smelled too good to waste! Well, it was wonderful and we'll definitely be making it again soon! Terrific feast!

Great recipe! We all really enjoyed this and I'm always looking for new recipes for the grill.  I completely forgot to add in the sugar but once we were eating these, realized it wasn't even needed (nice to know you may not need those extra calories!)

This recipe was awesome!  Not only was it good for dinner, but when I reheated the leftovers the next day, it was still awesome -- I am not known for liking reheated shrimp, but I made an exception for this recipe.  The apples were so tasty! I didn't have balsamic vinegar on hand, so I used raw, unfiltered apple cider vinegar, and didn't have strawberry jam so I used gooseberry jam instead.  My husband loved this, as well!!  Will definitely make this again.

FABULOUS! I used chipotle powder instead of red pepper flake which really complimented the strawberry. Marinated it for 2 hours and doubled the sauce as suggested by previous members which was a fabulous idea. We decided to serve the skewers elegantly over spinach greens and thinly sliced red onion which was delicious. The extra marinate was then used as the dressing. Perfect!

I doubled the red pepper, basil, and garlic. Then I added a 1/2 teaspoon of smoked paprika. I didn’t want to use skewers so I put it all in a grilling pan. Very delicious.

With apologies for changes:  Doubled marinade.  Did not use grill, but added chopped granny smith apples, diced onion, celery, and bell pepper to marinade. Sauteed marinated shrimp  on stove top.  Removed shrimp and sauteed marinade til vegs. softened. and marinade thickened.  Served over green salad, using marinade as dressing. Despite my changes, I rated this recipe  5 stars because it was delicious.

I read the reviews because that always helps a ton. I used a 2 pound bag of raw shrimp and I figure my family can take the tails off themselves.  I doubled the sauce recipe too because my kids always like sauce.  I had only really nice basil olive oil which probably made it even better.  I used brown sugar because it's usually better and raspberry jam.  I buy chopped up garlic in a jar so you don't have to chop it and I always guess on the amount.  I used a granny smith apple and honey crisp.  It marinated for about 1.5 hours. I will continue when I cook it.

Made as directed, although since it was raining I baked at 400 for 8 minutes as suggested by another reader. Did not place on skewers, just put in baking pan. Was delicious, and apples were just the right amount of softness, without being mushy. I was a bit worried about red pepper, but added great flavor without being to much spiciness for me.  Definately want to try on grill next time, and would probaly add pineapple as suggested as well! But family loved this - a keeper for sure!

This recipe is wonderful! I made no changes to the marinade, but I did add fresh pineapple to the mix as suggested by someone else. I'll definitely make this again and with a little more crushed red peppers to give it an extra kick.

This was ok.  Some changes I made because it was all I had. I had to use red raspberry preserves instead of strawberry.  I used green apple instead of Gala.  I used metal skewers instead of wood. Cooked on the stove instead of grill.  I liked the way it taste, but I didn't think it was the best.

Double sauce!  I skipped the grill and used an iron skillet. One batch of sauce sautéed apples. The other was for the shrimp.  This was side dish at a dinner party and everyone asked for the recipe!

This was delicious! I prepared double for a party, marinated overnight and when it hit the grill the smell was amazing! Will definitely be a family favorite!

Had to swap the jam for another kind, quadrupled the garlic (still not enough for me!), and reduced the red pepper to a few flakes to sneak some heat past my fiancée: result still terrific!

Very good, but the sauce is soooo sweet (and I used unsweetened jam).  I would suggest cutting down on the honey by about ? (the fact that the apples marinate with the shrimps adds lots of sweetness to the marinade).  Otherwise the taste was good!

Increased to 6 people so I would get more marinade for veggie's.  Had 34 smaller size shrimp.  Did 1 T lemon and 1 T Lime juice. Put 1 T applesauce in veggie marinade because the 2 (not 3) gala apples were with the shrimp skewers.  NOTE: could do without apple and use applesauce.

These are DELICIOUS! I am eating the last shrimp now, and I am so sad I may just have to go back and make some more for myself.  I didn't have any basil, and subbed cider vinegar and pumpkin jam.  Also made in a skillet on the stovetop instead of grilling.

These were a BIG hit at our Christmas dinner this year.  I would not change a thing, but making double the marinade that is.  Highly Recommended!

My wife and two grown sons went nuts over this recipe!  It was easy to throw together on a work night when the boys came over.  Apple slices tended to split when skewered, so maybe use a variety that's less crisp.  I thought the recipe might be a bit spicy but used the recommended amount of chili pepper and it was not at all.  Here's a "green" tip - marinate in a reusable plastic container instead of a bag.  Worked fine and can be washed and reused.  Next time I plan to try this in my smoker.  The apple might be very good that way.

Didn't think this recipe was something to save. The apples seemed under baked by the time the shrimp was perfect. Tried recipe as was written with just one skewer before tweaking.  Needed more spices for me.  Marinated uncooked shrimp in seasoning 24 hours and it seemed better but still nothing to go on and on about. Sorry. Still, I can see how some would enjoy this recipe.

This is surprisingly really tasty.  Who would have thought to use strawberry jam and shrimp?  I marinated the shrimp for about 24 hours and after grilling, they had a wonderful slightly sweet flavor.  I'm not a fan of Gala apples so I used red delicious and it was still really delicious.  The only mistake I made was using shrimp with the shells on (whoops!).  Definitely try this one!

Really tasty!  I omitted the sugar and added a bit more dhili flakes...Next time,I'll grill apples separately for a little longer so they have a chance to carmelize.
