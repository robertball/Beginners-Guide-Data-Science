I think people are missing the point of this dough.  This dough is meant to be EASY so that you can make it last minute.  Adding the extra steps completely ruins the ease of this recipe.  It is delicious, AS IS.  If you want to tweek it to add flavor add some herbs to the dough.  Of course the dough could be better with more time and more steps (and it is, I've taken the time).  But the recipe, as is, deserves the full 5 stars.  You will never make pizza dough better than this with this little effort put forth.  Thanks for the FABULOUS recipe.  We will never order out again.

Good recipe, but like other reviewers, it's missing directions.  Here's my changes: 1 1/4 cups warm water, 1 pkg active dry yeast, 1 tblsp sugar, 1 tsp thyme or Italian seasonings, 3 tblsp olive oil, 3+ cups of flour, 1 tsp salt. Mix water, yeast, sugar & oil in mixer bowl.  Then add flour & salt.  Mix-knead for 10-12 minutes, sprinkling with flour to keep from sticking to bowl.  Dough should be elastic & smooth. Place dough in oiled bowl, cover dough with oil, cover & let stand 1 hr at room temp. Then divide dough 2 equal parts roll into balls, cover with damp towel & let stand another 10 mins.  Use immediately.  Don't forget to poke holes into dough with fork once rolled onto pan to let steam escape while baking.

Okay, we are sold on this dough!!  We are connoisseurs of anything Italian and this is the best!!  I followed some of the suggestions and added 1 tsp garlic, 1 tsp basil, only 2 1/2 cups of flour, olive rather than vegetable oil, and let rise for 30 mins.  I also bake the crust alone for 5-7 mins then add my toppings.  Yum, Yum.

I agree with the previous reviewer RenaKS27 - people who are knit-picking this recipe to death are missing the whole point of its "quick and easy"-ness.  It is a no-fail go-to recipe for pizza crust when you dont WANT to wait for dough to rise, or have to pull out fifty-three different ingredients.  By all means, personalize it to your heart's content, but also don't be afraid to make it as is.  I also use it for quick breadsticks: roll it out and cut into strips with a pizza cutter, bake as directed, then brush with butter that has been melted with minced fresh garlic and sprinkle them with grated parmesan.  yum!

I've made this dough four times now trying all the different suggestions and variations. The best result though was to make it as per the recipe! There is quite a big difference in the final result depending on how you add the yeast. You'll get a thin & crispy result if you add the yeast to the warm water first and a thicker bready base if the water is added to all the dry ingredients at the same time. I used olive oil and  also added lots of dried herbs to the dry mix. This recipe also makes a really good garlic bread if you top it with olive oil, crushed garlic and parmesan cheese. I doesn't seem necessary to let the dough rise first, I didn't really notice any difference. Maybe our yeast is a bit different in NZ!

I made this dough tonight and it was perfect! I took the time to dissolve the yeast and sugar in the warm cup of water though and let the dough rise for 30 minutes. Then kneaded it lightly and let it rise again for 15 minutes. I feel the dough doesn't need to be flavored like others suggested; pizza sauce and toppings add all the flavor you need :) I made a huge deep dish pizza using all the dough in a 9x13 baking dish; piled high with cheese and toppings..the crust was thick, soft and moist just the way I love it!! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe needs a lot of work.  First of all, throwing all the ingredients together will restult in a thin crispy crust.  If thats what your going for, fine, but you dont need the yeast.

To make a proper crust, proof the yeast, sugar and water for 10-15 mins, then add the rest of the ingedients.

The recipe is very bland by itself, you need, at the very least, more salt.  I just used Adobo (about a tablespoon) and addes some garlic powder and onion powder.  Not enough to over power, but enough to take away the blandness.  I've also found adding 2 tablespoons of honey, in addition to the sugar, helps a lot.

Also, once you form the dough, let it sit so it can rise, maybe 10-15 mins, then roll it out.

Excellent recipe.  I made the dough in my bread machine using 2 tsp. bread machine yeast.  I added a pinch each of oregano & garlic powder to the flour.  Also, I used olive oil in place of vegetable oil [just a preference].  My husband likes a medium thickness to his crust and I like a thinner [flat bread] crust, which this recipe accomplished.  I brushed a little olive oil on the shells I made and prebaked them at 425 degrees for 5 minutes and froze them.  No need to thaw when you are ready to use, just put on the toppings and bake.  I baked at 425 degrees, just perfect.  Depending on the size of the pizza shells you are making, you can  get several shells from this recipe.  Thank you.

This recipe is perfect.  Simple is always best.  I'm not shy adding garlic powder to it, and of course sweet basil.  I also let it rise for 30 min's, and bake the crust about 5 min's at 425F before adding the toppings.  My kids and husband love it, and we never buy DiGiorno's anymore!  I'M A STAR!  Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

I have been baking bread for many years and this is a wonderful recipe. One of the great things about this recipe is it versatility. I always like to try a recipe in its original form before I start tweaking and this one is good “as-is.” Honestly though everyone has their own idea about the perfect crust so of course I made my own changes to suit my tastes. To me the most important thing to this recipe is to proof the yeast in warm water with sugar before adding it to the flour mixture. To proof the yeast just add the 1 cup warm water and 1 tbsp. sugar and yeast in a bowl. Stir it and let it sit for about 5-10 min till it gets frothy. It is not a necessary step but it helps activate the yeast and develops flavor since it will not be going through a rising stage. After kneading I do like to let the dough sit for at least 5 minutes to let the gluten relax. It will help make the dough less elastic when you are ready to roll it out. The only other change I made was to add 3 tbsp. of olive oil rather than veg. oil. If you have the opportunity this crust cooks beautifully on a grill. It gets just enough char to make you think it was cooked in a wood fired pizza oven. Just lay it down directly on the hot well oiled grates. Cook till it is firm enough to flip. Repeat on the other side. When you get the amount of color you want brush both sides with olive oil, remove to a baking sheet, top how you like, and finish up in a 450° oven. Absolutely  delish. This one is a keeper.

I just made this exactly as written, not one single change. It was great! It was really quick, easy, the texture was phenomenal. I think that people need to think before they write reviews, if you're going to rate something low it should not be because of your personal tastes, but because of something integrally wrong with the recipe, and there was absolutely nothing wrong with the recipe it turned out exactly as described.

I made this dough with my 10yo daughter for lunch today, and it was excellent.  It was also extremely easy.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable, let the dough sit for 40 minutes, and added Italian seasoning (after spreading on the pan).  Then I baked the dough for 10 minutes, topped it and baked for about 15 more.  I really thought it was going to turn out terrible, but it was terrific!  My daughter wants me to make it again tomorrow!

Very easy and delicious.  My dough only took 2 1/2 cups flour and was perfect.  I didn't do all of the extra steps that others did and it still came out delicious.  Whipped it up in the Kitchenaid, pressed it into a round pan, topped it, and baked.  So SIMPLE.

I made the dough in the bread machine, AMAZING, I made two round pizza's with this recipe with a stuffed crust ( pepperoni and cheese) my whole family loved it :) Thank you very much for the recipe. No more take out for us. We also did this recipe as panzerotti's, another favorite. I brushed on oil, parmesian cheese and basil to the crust and on the top of the panzerotti :)

I made this last night after misplacing my "favorite" pizza dough recipe that I have been using for years.  I used olive oil and since I wanted to end up with thin and crispy crust simply withheld 1/2 cup of the flour during the initial mixing and added some of it as I mixed the dough until the desired very sticky consistency was reached.  It rose perfectly in 30 mins and rolled out very easily unlike some other recipes.  It baked up very nicely in only 15 minutes.  This is now my favorite pizza dough recipe. My husband really loved it too. I will not miss "blooming" the yeast and kneading the  dough for so long as in my old favorite recipe.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This was the BEST pizza dough I have made, it is soooo EASY.  My 15 year old was having a party and I wanted to make pizza for them. This was the answer!  It was quicky and simple to make.  I put all the ingrediants into the bread machine on dough cycle, let is rise for about 30 minutes and made the pizza crust.   For the oil I used olive oil and replaced the water with milk. I added basil, Italian seasoning and garlic to season it up a little...  I also cooked the dough for about 10 minutes before placing the cheese and sauce on them.  I cooked the pizza dough in the morning, refrigerated it, and put all the ingrediants on the pizza that evening...took no time.  Thank you so much for this!  I will use it again and again.

I 100% agree with the first reviewer of this recipe that everyone is missing the point of this recipe (it's simplicity) by messing with it. I made this recipe AS WRITTEN and as an avid bread baker I will say that there is absolutely NO reason to go adding ingredients/steps! This pizza dough is BY FAR the BEST home made pizza dough that I have made to date. It baked up phenomenally, rolled out SO easy and tasted fantastic! The reason it doesn't require all the kneading and rising is because it doesn't need to rise that much in the baking process so the gluten doesn't need that time to "grow" -- it also won't roll out as well if it is handled too much (kneaded). Just make this recipe AS WRITTEN and you will be very pleased with the results -- I promise!!

I have used this recipes a few dozen times. I really like it and it's easy. That is the point. I like it thin and crispy. I parbake it first then load up my topping. Then I put it directly on the rack. Voila. Delicious. Gudny, you are on to something good...

Excellent dough!  I added 2 ounces of vegetable oil in the bottom of a 9' cake pan, set the dough inside, and then let it rise for 60 min. - just like thick crust take out pizza!!!  Also, if you make a double batch, take the other half, shape into an oval, let rise 60 min, cut into sticks, brush with butter, sprinkle with parmesan cheese and garlic salt - just like take out breadsticks!!! Yummy!

Great basic dough for anyone. Here are some added tips that will increase the flavor and  make a softer texture.  Subsitute EXTRA virgin olive oil and use Honey for sugar.  Knead the dough for about 10 15 min and put it in the frige over night take out about 1 1/2 prior to use the results are dramatic.

I can't figure out how this gets such high ratings. I followed the directions to the letter, my yeast was fresh and I checked the temp on my water...110. I usually make Jay's Signature crust from this site, so I can make dough. This never rose, was very dry and hard to"spread" on my pizza pan and although it appeared done, it was like biting into raw, hard dough after I added the toppings and cooked again. If I knew what went wrong, I might try this again, but I'll stick to pizza on nights I have time to let the dough rise.

This recipe turned out wonderful. I did make some changes though. I used olive oil instead of veggie and I added 1 tsp. of basil and 1 tsp. of garlic to the dough. Because it wasn't that big of a deal, I let the dough rise on the stove top for about an hour. I had dishes and other things to do, so I figured, why not? It rose up beautifully and made an excellent pizza. I used a 9x13 baking pan instead of a pizza pan. I do believe that next time I will use an 11x15 pan. Update* I have tried many size pans with this recipe, most of the time my husband thinks that the crust is too thick. I found that dividing the dough into two 9x13 pans work perfectly for us. That way I can also make two different pizzas and everyone is happy.

This was a very easy receipe to make.. I've never made homemade pizza crust before, always just bought the premade ones at the supermarket so I was nervous and didn't know what I was doing so I read all the reviews and I wrote down all of the tips I could find. I put the yeast in the warm water first like others said... I put olive oil on my hands so the dough wouldn't stick to me, I let the dough rise on my pizza stone for about 20 mins and than I baked the crust for 15 mins in the oven before I added the toppings and finally before I put the pizza back into the oven I used a spatula and loosened the crust from the pizza stone. Also I used Hunts sauce and it already had Basil, oregano and garlic in it (instead of putting it in the dough) and I used cornmeal and garlic powder to cover my stone before I put the dough on it and it gave the dough a nice taste. This was the best pizza I ever made! My only complaint was the dough wasn't as crunchy as me and my family would like so next time I probably won't let it rise but that's just our personal taste. But this is definatly a Keeper! THANKS!

WOW this is wonderful stuff.  I used everyones suggestions and added garlic, italian seasoning and olive oil instead of vegtable oil.

I doubled the recipe and was able to make 3 pizzas.  It was sooooooooo good!

this is a good dough not great. better if you let it rise before using resulting in a fluffier less dense dough. I made it both ways and prefer to let it rise

I followed the recipe exactly.  When it was done I had this watery, gluey paste that did not rise.  I put it on the table with some flour and floured my hands and still could not work with it.  No matter how much I oiled or floured my hands it still stuck to everything.  I couldn't lift it off the table to put it in the pan.  I threw it away.  I will never make this again.

Perfect dough! Easy and quick. I did let it rise for 30 minutes just because it didnt look like there was much dough. I 30 minutes I had twice as much as I did when I started!  Great texture and taste. WIll use again. NO more buying dough from the store.

What a disappointment!  I followed the recipe to the letter, and read great reviews on it.  Nonetheless, the finished product was thick, dense, rubbery crust that tasted like wet flour—it tasted like dried-out dough rather than cooked pizza crust.  I will never make this recipe again.  I am puzzled by the great reviews.  No offense to the submitter of the recipe, but something just didn’t work out for me.  I do not suggest this to anyone who expects good pizza.

I really needed a new pizza dough recipe and this is it! I followed a few other reviewers advice and dissolved the yeast and sugar in the warm cup of water. Also I let the dough rise for 20 minutes and pre-baked it for about 8 minutes before adding the toppings. The pizza came out fantastic. I didn't add any herbs to the dough cause the pizza sauce I made was enough to compensate for the lack of seasoning in the dough. I must say the crust came out wonderfully soft and was just perfect. My dad said "this is the way I like my pizza." This will be the recipe I use from now on. Thanks!

I REALLY like this recipe - but I did things differently.  I used Rapid Rise yeast (following the directions on the yeast pouch) and let the dough rest 10 min. after kneading.  Then I rolled it out on my pizza stone and it was perfect.  NOTE: I like to partially bake my crust before adding toppings - about 10 min.

Wow, this is such an easy and delicious recipe for pizza dough.  I followed the recipe and I was able to make dough within 5 minutes.  I brushed the dough with some olive oil and baked in at 400 F for 10 minutes and then added my toppings and baked it for another 15 minutes.  This came out wonderful!  I use to make pizza using pre-made pizza dough because I thought making dough from scratch was way too time consuming.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This recipe is GREAT for a quick weekday dinner....no fuss, throw everything in a bowl and stir a turn or two and mix with your hands.....roll it out and voila! a tasty pizza dough for your favorite toppings. I used olive oil and baked the dough for 5 or so minutes before adding toppings. Far better than take out, far healthier! Thank you for a perfectly easy dough recipe!

I don't understand why anyone thinks this is good.  My pizzas have been in the oven for 30 min. already and the crust is so soft and undone but all the toppings are drying out and burning.  I will never use this recipe again.  I wouldn't give it any stars but I don't have that option.

Wonderful!!!  This dough was just as good (but different)than my bread machine dough and it takes much less time!!  I made a few changes though.  I put the yeast in the warm water for a few mintues.  Then added the remaining ingredients along with some Italian seasoning and oregano.  I let it rise in a warm oven (150 degrees) for 30 min.  Then I spread the dough out and baked it for about 15 min at 350 degrees.  Then I added the toppings and cooked until cheese was melted.  Great tasting and wonderful "pillowy" texture!!

very quick and easy to make, the kids could have done it.  But bland.  Very bland.  I added oregano and a ton of garlic powder after reading some of the other reviews calling it flavorless but it was still very blaaaa.  It also doesn't have that chewy texture that a good crust has, this brakes when you bend it.. like the consistency of corn bread.

This recipe is going in my recipe box! I added 2 Tbl of dried oregano and a few turns of cracked black pepper to the dough. It was delicious! Next time I make it, I'm going to divide the dough in half or else make 2 pizzas. It's too much dough for one pizza.

This recipe was good.  The ingredients were perfect but the directions were terrible. I think everybody was having trouble because it never tells you to kneed the dough or to let it rise.  Those are my tips. Hope they help.

i made a well in the centre of the flour and put the yeast sugar and warm water in. then i added the oil making sure to withhold the salt. i then put all the flour on top of the well and put it on top of the warm oven. i left it til the top cracked and then i mixed it all in and gradully added the salt. i then kneaded the dough for a few minutes covered it in cling film and left it for about 1/2 an hour to an hour and came back kneaded it a lil bit more to get out the bubbles cut it in half and made two pizzas. i think the other people had problems cause they didnt let it rise at all. it was beautiful crust and it was nice and high.

Disappointing.  The dough never rose at all in any way, and the resulting crust was tough and impenetrable by human teeth.  I could just as easily have spread my sauce and cheese on a drink coaster.

This was my first attempt ever to make pizza dough & it worked!  I read every single review first to get some tips from others who have made this.  I did cut back on the yeast and added basil, oregeno & garlic which gave it a nice flavor then let it rise for 1 hour. I also pre-baked the dough for 5 minutes (needs a few more, I think) before adding the ingredients. I will make this again!  Thanks to all the reviewers for their tips on this.

As is this recipe is too doughy. I halved the yeast, substituted olive oil for veg, added some spices. Instead of using warm water try scalded milk. It makes the dough taste much more like pizza. My husband and toddler love it!

Super easy and tastes great. I started the yeast, water and sugar, after 10 minutes or so mixed in the rest. Kneaded for about 5 minutes, perfect texture, it turned into a perfect pizza crust in under 25 minutes. I used olive oil instead of veggie oil.

it was ok. great for a last minute/nothing else to eat dish. I followed the recipe word for word and my only problem was the dough was to thick. i came back and read a lot of reviews and will probably go by either just using 2 1/2 cups flour or 1 1/4 cup warm water. not sure but will leave a review for when i do.

GREAT! And it doesn't need any complex rise time... As long as you make it in the right order.

I used fast-rise yeast just because I keep it on hand for my bread machine. Mix the yeast & warm water in a bowl and let it dissolve while measuring out the rest of the ingredients. Mix everything together, knead a few times until well blended, oil the bowl, and let it rise while the oven preheats and the toppings are being gathered and prepared. 

I made personal pizzas... Hand shaped the crusts and 6 breadsticks, and they rose more as I was topping each one.

The crust turned out perfect and not at all "cracker" like some people have said.

This was by far the easiest AND best tasting crust I've ever made. I prefer a softer crust as I have young children so I use a baking sheet instead of a stone and it turned out wonderfully.

Awesome. I used half whole wheat flour and I did let it rise a bit (15 or 20 min). Made thin crust pizza with it. Delicious!!! New favourite crust.

I love making pizza at home and have tried the pre-baked crusts and refrigerator roll-out crusts, but never tried homemade dough from scratch. I have found the pre-baked and refrigerator crusts to be disappointing and more difficult to work with (pre-baked crusts that are dry, crack, and fall apart, refrigerator crusts that do not roll well). This recipe was fantastic! I have made bread before so I began the same way by dissolving the sugar in 1 1/4 c warm water and sprinkled the yeast on top. I let it rise for a few minutes and added it to my flour, salt, and olive oil mixture.  My mixer's dough hook was perfect for the job; very quickly the hook evenly distributed all the ingredients. I lightly coated the ball of dough with olive oil and allowed it to rise about 10 min., covered, in a slightly warmed oven. I punched down the risen ball of dough, cut it into two balls, and rolled out two crusts using minimal flour to prevent sticking. The dough was not so elastic that it kept shrinking when I rolled it, but elastic enough to hold its shape.  After adding my desired toppings I baked two pizzas at a time on the top and bottom rack at 375° for 7 min., then switched them for another 7 min. They were perfect - light, soft, and lightly browned, not soggy or mushy. Roll the dough out more thinly for a crispier thin crust. This recipe is so easy and delicious that I would make it instead of buying a pre-made crust!

Easy to make and spread in the pan, but sooo soggy. A very moist dough and I had to add about a cup of extra flour. See photo for how soggy and wet the pizza dough was.

I added a little garlic powder and italian seasoning and let the dough rise once for about an hour.  I oiled a cast iron skillet, covered the bottom with a thin layer of rolled out dough, an baked 10 min before adding toppings to the edge-great pan pizza but not a very crunchy crust-next time i think I'll add a little cornmeal.

This crust wasn't bad for a throw together in a pinch crust.  It reminded me of the crust you got in the chef Boyardee pizza kits.  I had no problems working with the dough at all.  It spread out very nicely for me.  I prefer "Jay's Signature Pizza Crust" from this site, but should I be in a pinch again, I will definately use this as my alternative.  I enjoy a chewier crust.

This was  "good" but not the "amazing" reviews that I read here.  I would put it a bit better than the packaged pizza crust and it really is easy to make.  Maybe the reviews raised my expectations too high. I used olive oil instead of veg oil. I also brushed olive oil on the crust before putting on the toppings which may have helped to brown the crust a little.  It really did make a decent pizza, very chewy and dense crust. More bread-like than crust-like. So if that's how you like your pizza then you'll like this.  I will probably make it again and mess with recipe to lighten up the dough a bit. BOTTOM LINE: not bad but also not as "fantastic" as all the reviews say it is.  :)

I have tried a lot of pizza crust recipes...this is one of the simplest and the BEST!  Like others, I use heated milk instead of water, and added garlic and Italian seasoning.  I kneaded the dough very lightly (just to ensure the ingredients were totally mixed).  I then topped with store bought sauce, mozzarella and parmesan cheese.  This recipe definitely made enough for two crusts (to use this recipe for one crust would have made the pizza too thick for my taste).  I froze the second portion, thawed a week later, and baked into bread sticks brushed with olive oil and garlic.  Yum!

Love this dough! Quick and easy! I let it rise for about a half hour and cooked it for about five minutes before adding the toppings, as others suggested.

I took some of the great suggestions from other reviewers and WOW was this a wonderful pizza dough with a few of these additions.  I substituted the vegetable oil with olive oil and added garlic powder and basil to the dough (mmmmm).  I also put some crisco shortening and cornmeal on the bottom for a really great crust.  This is a keeper for sure and it was so quick and easy.  Best of all the kids loved it!!!!  
Thanks

The recipe doesn't mention kneading, but you absolutely have to knead it, at least enough to mix everything together (and you'll need more warm water, maybe 1/4 more, to get a nice soft dough). That said, this is our go-to crust recipe. I like to use half whole wheat flour, and I've added in dried herbs and fresh herbs frozen in oil with great results. We get 2 thin pizza crusts out of this recipe. You can make the dough the night before and let it hang out in the fridge to develop that nice yeasty goodness, and it freezes beautifully.

Wonderful recipe!  It's fast and my family loved the texture of it.  Exactly what I was looking for.  I added some Italian Seasoning to it which added all the flavor we wanted.  Thanks.

Have made this twice for dinner. I made the mistake of over working the dough the first time. I had a hard time streching the dough to fit the cookie sheet. The key with this dough is not to over work the dough.  I like to add the yeast to the warm water first and let the yeast soften for a few minutes. Add everything together, stir, and knead the dough a few times. I like to pat the dough on the cookie sheet until it is size I need.  I also like to add dried basil and garlic powder to the dough.

Wonderful! This is very fast and delicious, rolls or tosses out easily. I used EVOO instead of the vegetable oil, and added a few shakes of italian seasoning and garlic powder.  We've been using (and tremendously enjoying!) this dough for a while, and because I use a more liquid pasta sauce (pizza sauce can sometimes be rather sweet to our tastes) I find it helpful to bake the dough for 5-10 minutes before adding sauce and toppings. Thanks for this great recipe!

I read some of the reviews and decided to take a little advice from a few of them, and it came out GREAT. Way better than I expected. Usually dough and I do not get along well at all...but this time it was perfect. So here's what  did.. 2 3/4 cup flour, 1 package active dry yeast, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 tsp salt, 1 tbsp white sugar, 1.5 tbsp garlic powder, 2 tsp dry oregano, and 1 cup hot water as hot as my sink gets.  I added all the dry ingredients and mixed, then oil, then water and mixed it up and attempted to knead it. It was a sticky mess and I thought Oh No! But I set it aside in a large bowl, covered it with a kitchen towel and left it alone for 30 minutes or so.   Preheated the oven to 400.. greased my pizza pan with olive oil, used the whole dough for one pizza, it fit perfectly. Then take a fork and make indentions all over the dough (so the crust does not bubble up anywhere) Then bake for 5 minutes, take out and continue on making your pizza.  That may just be the best crust in the world.  *My pizza was loaded with chicken and veggies and I cooked it at 400 for about 17 minutes and all of it cooked perfectly.

This is a good recipe and I've used it several times.  I do make some changes.  I use honey instead of sugar, wheat or spelt instead of white flour, and olive oil instead of vegetable (you should always use olive in Italian cooking).  I like to proof the yeast and let it rise briefly, but I only leave it 15 - 20 min. instead of the usual hour or more.  It makes more than it says, but it depends on the thickness.  One batch gets us 4 individual-sized pizzas (enough for one adult).  Pre-baking the crust for a few minutes is a good idea, and the pizza REALLY needs to bake at 425 to 450 in order to crisp up properly.  Pizzas always bake HOT.  Because the recipe needed a few changes I give it 4 stars (and I'm not talking about my choice to let it rise; I'm talking about olive oil and baking temp).

This is my standard pizza dough recipe. I have made this recipe two ways.  The first time I made it I let it rise first. My family didn't like it.  It was too thick and bread-like. The next time I did not let it rise first and my family liked it much better.  I cut the flour to 2 1/2 cups and cut the sugar to 1 tsp and that improved the recipe.  My bread making tip is to always proof the yeast first.  Add the yeast to the warm water and sugar and let sit for a few minutes until the yeast begins to foam.  Then add dry ingredients and oil.  This ensures that the yeast is still alive and will actually work in your recipe.

Great as a quick thin crust or it is wonderful as a thicker crust dough when allowed to rise thirty minutes to an hour in a warm spot.

Loved it. Baked up nice and thick, but without having to mess with rise times! I added a dash of Italian seasoning. UPDATE: Made this again. This time I had to knead the dough to work in all the flour; once kneaded I divided the dough in half and rolled out two smaller circles. Prebaked for 8 minutes, then lowered the temp to 350 to cook the toppings and melt the cheese.

My husband and children loved this pizza dough.  I used only 2-1/2 cups of flour instead of 3.  I let the yeast dissolve in warm water before adding to the dry mixture.  I also added 1-1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp Oregano to the dry mixture.  Before baking I brushed melted butter around the outer crust and sprinkled garlic powder around it.  I did not let the dough rise; I simply let it sit on the counter while I chopped my ingredients for the pizza.  I did not prebake the dough either.  Turned out great! This is a keeper!

So fast and easy to make. It does need a little kneading which is not mentioned, but other than that, followed exactly the instructions. I did use half whole wheat and half all-purpose flour. Delicious, fluffy, and rises very well. My son helped kneading and he patted the whole thing down on the tray (which I had oiled with olive oil for a more golden crust. We did let it rest covered on the tray a bit to go buy some extra veggies for the toppings, and it became quite thick, which I love. IF you like a thinner crust, you should probably roll it thinner, or pat down thinner to make a large pizza. Thanks so much, so practical, love it!

Ive never made pizza dough before and this is a perfect EASY and QUICK recipe. I first mixed the water and yeast together and then added the oil and sugar to that before adding the flour. I also substituted 2 TBS olive oil for the vegetable oil and added 2 TBS Italian seasoning for extra flavor. I let the dough rise 30 mins prior to rolling it out. I like more of a thin crust, so I divided the dough between two 9x13 square pans and baked it 7 mins before putting sauce and toppings on. My pizza came out perfect!!

I was looking for a shortcut.  I guess with homemade dough there is no short cut.  I followed the receipe, with the exception of using olive oil instead of veg. oil.  The dough tasted like cardboard.

This was a nice, simple recipe, but the pizza turned out a little doughy. Like many other reviewers, I had to add a little water to the recipe, but next time I will take the advice of others and dissolve the yeast and sugar in the warm cup of water, let the dough rise for 20 minutes, and pre-bake the dough for about 8 minutes before adding the toppings and cooking.

Putting the dough together was easy to do . I also mixed the yeast ,water , then oil. I also let the dough rise 25 min. I used olive oil instead of veg. Added garlic, Itl. seasonings to dough. Pizza crust was soft ,brown, and chewy. Very good . My only wish is that the crust had some crunch to it. Family still gave it thumbs up !

This is a no-rise recipe which calls for regular yeast but I usually let it rise some anyway or use quick yeast. If I make a single giant pizza with it, I usually par-bake for 10-15 mins before adding toppings. Sometimes I add a tablespoon of Tastefully Simple garlic bread seasoning to the flour. And if I have cheese sticks, sometimes I cut them in half lengthwise and make stuffed crust.

Very good for how easy it is! I add olive oil instead, and also added garlic and Italian Seasoning to the dough, then brushed the edges with olive oil before adding the sauce.

Pretty good recipe. I added as suggested garlic powder and Oregano. Let rise or you'll have a flat crust!

My husband swears by this recipe!  He is the cook in our family and used to make pizza dough in our breadmaker.  This far surpasses that!  EXCELLENT!

very good.  I added some basil and oragano to the dough  for  more flavor.  It was a little underdone in the middle so next time i will try to bake and then add toppings and bake again.

Wow! This is such a great recipe. I don't have any trouble with the 3 cups of flour but I generally dump in a little more olive oil than called for anyway. The first time I tried it, it turned out kind of dry and hard. The next time I let it rise for about 30 minutes and what a difference. It was fluffy and you could taste the heartiness of it. I usually double it and make one a pizza for the kids and the other I make calzones for me and my husband. I don't need to look any further for dough recipes, this is it!

As Miss Rena says, this dough is meant to be simple.  Its not fabulous.  Its not gourmet.  It IS a wonderful, quick, easy, almost fool proof recipe for a very yummy pizza dough.  I always make a recipe exactly the way written the first time, regardless of what i want to adjust.  And I rate it based on that, not on my tweaks.  However, I did not have enough regular flour on hand, and no vegetable oil, just olive oil.  So i did half wheat flour, half white, and subbed olive oil.  This crust turned out a perfect, medium-thick chewy, breadlike 13" pie.  It required a little kneading on the flatboard for a couple of minutes, to be able to roll out, but i did not wait for it to rise.  No need.  I rolled it out on my pizza stone, and pressed the middle out just a little extra so it baked thoroughly in 28 minutes at 375.  My son and I loved it.  Will use this over and over.  And when I have the time, i'll play with it.  Parmesan, fresh herbs, garlic... this recipe can do alot, but its great as is, without a doubt!

This is a great and easy pizza dough recipe!!  I've made it at least 40 times, over the past two years.  The only thing I change is to let it rise for about 45 minutes, punching it down once or twice, and I occasionally add different spices for taste.  I will also use adobo for the salt for a change.  I up the recipe to 4 cups of flour to make two large pizza's on my cast iron pans.  Fantastic!!!

Followed the recipe exactly and it was such a lovely, fast, tasty treat to make. Not exactly the same as a risen dough but very close and perfect for impromptu pizza night!

This was the easiest dough ever.

I did however knead it til it was smooth and I added some parmesean cheese and 1 and a half tbs of Italian seasoning. It was great!

I love this dough because it's sooo easy!  Often I'll omit the salt and use two teaspoons of a spice blend (like the kind you add to olive oil to dip bread in) to give it a little flavor.  While I enjoy it as is, one time I made the dough and then got called away for a bit....it was even better when it got to rest/rise a bit!

This is quick, easy, and very tasty! I have used this recipe for pizza dough, as well as breadsticks and both turn out fantastic! I brush with a melted butter/garlic powder mixture as soon as it comes out of the oven! YUMMM!

I made this into mini pizzas using the "brownie bites" pan. My two year old loved it! Made "home made" sauce as follows: 1 can diced tomato, 1 can tomato sauce, garlic to taste, salt to taste, and enough Italian seasoning (herbs) to make the sauce look like prego, (more if you like...)

Followed the directions except added in a generous amount of onion powder, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning.  It turned out great!  I've used it three times so far, and everyone who tries it loves it!  I would recommend speading the dough over your pizza tray before prepping your other ingredients.  That will give it a little rising time.  I used half a jar of marinara sauce, cheddar cheese, fresh spinach, fresh sliced mushrooms, diced garlic and sliced onion.  SO GOOD!!!!!  Unless I'm feeling incredibly lazy, I will proably never by pizza again.  This was so good and truly easy!  And for those who don't use yeast packets, use 2 1/4 tsp of yeast.  To get the best results, put a little of your sugar in your warm water and add the yeast to that before mixing your other dry ingredients seperately.  It will let the yeast bubble up a bit, thus adding to the flavor.

easy and tasty! I made the dough in the morning, oiled my 11x15 pan, rolled out the dough, covered with saran and let it rise in the fridge, when I got home I let it sit out while the oven was preheating, topped with meatballs, onions, peppers, mushrooms and Italian blend cheese, 25 minutes was perfect.

I made this exactly the way it was written, and it was absolutely dreadful.  I've never been disappointed with any recipe from this site until now.  The dough did not raise at all, it was like trying to eat pizza on a cracker, but with a raw middle. Take the time and make dough that you allow to rise...when you try to cut corners, you end up with a disaster.

All I have to say is wow! This is easily one of the most rewarding experiences in my journey as a young, novice cook.  This is a great base recipe that yields phenomenal results. The biggest suggestion I would have for everyone (experienced or not) is to to learn how to knead pizza dough. It's not quite as simple as you would think, but it is VERY easy to learn and improves your final product exponentially.

I thought this was a great, quick dough. The people who have changed this recipe or complained about the lack of rise time aren't "getting it". It is a quick recipe. This rose beautifully - better than some doughs I have spent all day on! I divided it into 4 and my kids created their own personal pizza. I'm getting ready to make it again right now, and I wasn't even in a hurry - it's just that quick, easy and good.

This is an excellent pizza crust. I have made it exactly as the recipe states and I have also made it letting the yeast dissolve in the water for 10 min. and then letting the dough rise for 30. It is excellent both ways. The original recipe gives you a great crust quickly. If you do happen to have the time though, I do recommend letting it rise for just a little while, even if it's just while you get the rest of your ingredients together. In my opinion, it does make it better. I also like to sprinkle a little cornmeal on my greased pan before patting the crust down. I'm sure it's not necessary but I think it helps keeps it from sticking. It comes up perfectly every time.

It was decent but really not what we were hoping for. It tasted pretty homemade and not in a good way. For now I will keep looking for a better dough for pizza Friday's.

Excellent recipe.  Out of habit I add yeast, warm water and sugar to bosch for 5 minutes while I gather other ingredients.   Then I add oil and salt and mix in one cup of flour at a time until enough flour is added (usually 2 and 3/4Cup).  Make sure the middle of the pizza dough is pretty thin and the edges can be thicker.  I have made several times and it has always turned out perfect.  I usually make one pizza crust and 6 bread sticks.  Thanks for the great recipe!

super great!!!  My husband who thought he would never like homemade pizza LOVED it.  He's asking when I can make it again.  I did follow the recommendation of another reviewer and let the dough rise for 1 hour.  I had a little too much dough for my pizza pan, so I made fantastic garlic bread sticks with the extra dough.  Thank you Gudny for submitting this recipe.

I teach a foods class to high school students.  This recipe is by far the easiest for ADD/ADHD infested classrooms.  I have my students freeze it overnight, then I remove them the next morning and let them rest in the fridge for another 12-24 hours.  It is much easier to roll out and use.  I also instruct my students that want a "crispy crust" to put the raw dough on a piece of foil with oil brushed on it(to prevent sticking to the foil) and bake for 5-10 min. or until it is just turning brown.  They then remove the crust, apply toppings and place back in oven directly on rack with the foil on the rack below.  The crust is much better when done the "crispy" way.

If I was rating this recipe just on ease only, then I would give this a five star.  This version is easy to prepare, no doubt there.  I followed this recipe to a T, as I really hate seing reviews where the original recipe is unreconizable.  After trying this out two times though, I just could not get over the texture.  It tasted just like the pizza I ate for lunch in highschool.  The pizza looked great though, and I made this on a metal pizza pan, then on a pizza stone, but I ended up with the same results. Thanks for the recipe though, alot of people do like it, I'm just not a fan of this type.

So fast and easy. No need for time to rise, it plumps up perfectly in the oven! Next time I will pull it even thinner before baking because it does rise quite a bit while cooking.

I have tried several pizza dough recipes and this one is my favorite, it is error proof.  I have made this exactly as written many times, and was happy every single time. I make one large pizza with this recipe, but I often make up two separate batches at the same time to make two large pizzas.  Recently while making up two batches I unintentionally cut back the flour in one of the batches to slightly under 3 cups, and the dough was easier to handle, and had a  great consistency.  I also found if I am short on time and need a quicker rise that adding an extra 1/2 packet of yeast works great.  I try to make this on a weekly basis.  I also use this same recipe to make calzone, works perfect!

I took the time to proof the yeast and allowed the finished dough 15 minutes to rise. After I topped the pizza I let it rise an additional 15 minutes. My husband said it was the best crust I've ever made (and I've made A LOT). Update: I made this again and the results were just as good as I remembered. Yum!

I agree with the one who said this deserves the full 5 stars since it is designed to be EASY and FAST. I used to buy store bought bread, but my husband talked me into trying this and he LOVED it. I too thought it was fantastic and totally inexpensive and easy to make. I too will never order out again!!!

This recipe definitely was SUPER easy and had a GREAT taste.  I made an olive oil and spice mixture (EVOO, italian spices) that I spread around the crust to help with flavor. However, I wasn't entirely pleased with the consistency. I pre-baked the crust like another reviewer suggested for about 5 minutes, and then topped and cooked the pizza for 20 minutes - and then an additional 10 - and the pizza dough still didn't "cook up" fully and remained doughy and chewy. I'm not sure if I just didn't roll out the dough thin enough, or if it was because I am cooking at a high elevation. I am willing to try this again, cause the taste was good.

Fantastic! At a loss for words, but this was the best homemade pizza dough I've ever made. It was quick and easy. I took some of the other reviewer’s tips and reduced the flour to 2½ cups, used olive instead of vegetable oil, and dissolved the salt, sugar and the yeast in 1 cup of warm water. Mixing the dough was easy as items mixed well. There was plenty of dough for my pan and it spread easily. I topped the dough with Exquisite Pizza Sauce from this site and we had a winner!

Great recipe.  Like others, I used olive oil instead of vege oil, and reduced the water a little.  I always make ahead of time (in my bread machine on the dough cycle) and then refrigerate it for  a few hours.  It rolls out a lot better after resting in the fridge- it doen't "shrink" back when shaping it into the pizza.  I make two pizzas out of this recipe because I like a thinner crust.

I used olive oil and let the dough rise for about 15 minutes before baking.  The crust was a little too sweet... next time I'll use less sugar... and also too thick for me.  Next time I'll use this recipe to make 2 pizzas instead of one.  I also think it would be better if I added herbs to the dough.  Thanks.

My first try at homemade pizza dough and it was a hit with my family .  Prebaked for a few minutes before adding toppings.  I will be trying this recipe again tonight with whole wheat flour and flax meal.

This is a good recipe. But, did you see that coming? But, To make this good recipe great. Use, better for bread flour(high gutten makes the dough chewy) a pizza stone to dissipate the high heat. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees, cook for about 11 min.

My first pizza crust and it turned out perfectly! As per the other reviewers, I first mixed the yeast, sugar and water together and let stand for 10 minutes. Then I proceeded as the recipe suggests. I also added some crushed dried rosemary to the batter. Thanks for a simple and wonderful recipe! (Edit: I have now tried "Pizza Dough III" and it was WAY easier. This "Pizza Dough I" is quite dry and was way more difficult to handle. "Pizza Dough III" was way easier in the long run.)

Made as directed, this turned out so-so, 2 stars.  When the bread machine makes the dough, absolutely delicious!  So I am rating it 4 stars.  I used a packet of spiced apple cider mix instead of the sugar and it was amazing!

I work at a group home in Vinita, OK and I want to say that out of all 12 clients everyone thought this was the best crust they had ever tasted.  Some even said it is better than the store bought packaged and even better than Pizza Hut's thin crust pizza's.  I definately will use this recipe again.  Thanks so much.

Excellent recipe for dough! I kneed the dough quite a bit or it is too flaky for my taste, but it doesn't need to rise.  Makes one hand tossed thickness or 2 thin crust.

FANTASTIC!!!  This is the ONLY recipe I use for pizza dough now.  Works WONDERFUL on the dough setting in my breadmaker, couldn't be easier.  I sprinkle my dough with grated parmesean cheese and then bake for 10 minutes before adding toppings.  I bake an additional 25 minutes after that.  A true family favorite around here.

This really is a good dough, AFTER reading other reviews & adding a tsp. of Italian seasoning, a tbsp. of grated parmesan cheese, and a tsp. of garlic powder.  I mixed it up in my kitchen aid, and let it rest for about 10 minutes.  I also rolled & sealed the crust around mozzarella cheese sticks (my 11 year old LOVES stuffed crust).  It turned out great, they loved it.  Thanks Gundy!

This was BRILLIANT. I read thru all the reviews first, used ALL the tips - less flour & yeast, olive oil, herbs & parm cheese, I kneaded it, let it rise and it was so spongy & perfect! I even cooked it on a thin metal biscuit slide which is supposed to be a no-no and there was no soggy crust to be seen. My tips are put your cheese on first (after the tom sauce), drain all juicy toppings and let the pizza rest on a wire rack 2/3 mins before cutting.  WONDERFUL!

I always thought that pizza dough had to take a long time to make to taste good, but this recipe proved that wrong.  This is DELICIOUS and very easy to make.  My kids even ate the top crust!!

Update:  I'd forgotten I'd ever used this recipe...which shows how often I make pizza.  But I made it again tonight and (somewhat amusing) made the same additions as before.  This time I left it really thick and baked it as bread sticks.  After cooking about 20 minutes I brushed with garlic butter and baked 3 more minutes then topped with grated Parmesan cheese.  Delicious!

Original review:  I've never made pizza from scratch before. (Hard as that is to believe - I'm 49 years old!) I've always bought frozen or at least pre-made.  This crust, however, was so incredibly easy!  I did use olive oil, just because pizza is Italian and that means olive oil!  I also put a bit of garlic salt and oregano in the crust.  It mixed beautifully, using a spoon at first, then my hands.  I did let it rest for a short time, while making pizza sauce, then pressed it out onto my large Pampered Chef pizza stone.  I prebaked about 10 minutes, topped it, and baked it for another 15.  Next time I will prick the crust, because it wanted to bubble a bit, and bake it about 5 minutes longer.  It was a bit chewy still but I think that was because of the stone, instead of a pan.  But all in all, this is a keeper.  I'm so happy to have found a recipe this simple.  I'm picturing breakfast pizza and calzone and so many other uses for this dough.  Thanks!

it was quick, easy, and tasted great! Instead of pizza crust, I made breadsticks with it. I did let it raise for about 15-20 min just for some fluff, but I wouldn't have bothered if I were making pizza. This one is a keeper for quick and simple.

For a quick & easy, no fuss crust for a pizza or calzone, this works great.  All these reviews saying "you need to let it rise," or "you have to proof the yeast exactly 10.3 minutes in a 72.9 degree room" - ignore them.

Follow the recipe, as written - toss the dry ingredients together, add the wet, mix it all up well, make a ball & roll or spread it out.  EXACTLY...AS...WRITTEN.  If you're looking for some fancy crust that you can spend 5 days making, this recipe doesn't claim to be that.  But if you've got a hankering for a quick pizza & it's the middle of the night & you've got all the topping but no crust?  This is going to do you just fine.  You can add some herbs, brush it with olive oil, or tweak it if you want - that's fine.  But you don't NEED to do any more than the instructions say in order to have a fully functional, perfectly acceptable, basic pizza crust.

I'm 13 years old and LOVE cooking. I tried this once before but I made the crust too thick and it didn't cook. Also, it was bland. Today, I made it and it was awesome! I rubbed some garlic powder into it for extra flavor and made it super thin. Probably about the thickness of two fingernails. I baked it for 25 minutes on the dot. It was crunchy and soft at the same time. I topped it with tomato and basil tomato sauce by barilla, cheddar cheese, broccoli, spinach, and grape tomatoes. Also, I sprinkled a little parmesean cheese on as well. It was awesome and my grandparents and their caretaker raved about it!!! (Also, I made a huge mess and for the first time ever, I cleaned it up! Haha)
All in all, this is a great recipe! Make sure you season the dough with something or else it will be bland.

With a couple of adjustments, this recipe deserves 5 stars!! I tried it last night, we all thought it was missing something. So i tried again tonight and added more salt and more sugar. Not much, half a tea spoon of each and it did the thing!! I doubled the batch for pizza and breadsticks! You have to let the dough raised though!! 
Will do a lot of pizza now! And breadsticks! My sons are totally in love with that recipe! Even the picky eater! Thank you so much for sharing!!

This dough is really awesome! I had more time than most probably making this dough so I decided to put it in my bread machine for thorough mixing. I used the recipe as is except switched the oil for EVOO        (2 1/2 T). I also used bread flour in place of all purpose and 2 1/4 tsp yeast since I don't have packets. I then added some dried basil and garlic powder to the dough. I let my machine do the rest. When it was ready I floured a ziploc bag and put the dough in my fridge overnight. Next day I took the dough out and it had risen nicely. Left it out for about 1/2 hr then put 1/4 cup flour on my cutting board and shaped dough. I put my pizza stone in oven at 450. Let pizza stone get hot and took it out then put corn meal on it to prevent sticking. Transferred dough and shaped a little to fit. Baked the crust for 5 mins then put the sauce and other ingredients on it. Baked for about 15 mins then took out. Crust was hard when coming out but softened as it sat into really soft. It's the best I've tried so far! I think the idea is after it has come out of the machine not to manipulate it so much and you will end up with a nice dough!

Followed exactly as written and it was great! I used this for my Taco Pizza and was very happy with the results. The only thing I will do differently is stretch the dough a little thinner. This was my first time making pizza dough and I didn't realize the bread was going to rise so much. lol =)

If you are looking for a pizza dough that is meant to rise, then either adjust the recipe OR find a different pizza. Honestly, most of the crust recipes on here are basically the same. This is a wonderfully simple and FAST way to make pizza. Something that busy mom's like myself like. You can pick the recipe apart all you want but at the end of the day THIS recipe is not meant to be given rise time or have seasonings added to it. If you do, it's a different recipe, and it's ridiculous to make responses saying that it could have been better this way or that way when it's fine as is. 

That being said... I allowed this recipe to rise because I WANTED to, not because I HAD to. I added Garlic and Herb seasoning to the crust, not because I HAD to, but because I WANTED to. The things you do different from a recipe don't make the recipe off, inaccurate, or not that great... it just  makes it a different pizza crust.

This is an easy recipe that tastes great and works well as-is, or a little doctored up.  I did let it rise for 20 min, divided it in half, made a 10-in pizza in my little toaster oven (I live in a dorm) that turned out delicious.  The other half of the dough sat in the covered bowl another 40 mins and when I went to make the second pizza it had risen some more.  I made that into a smaller thick-crust pizza. I used Boboli pizza sauce. One small packet is enough for two 10-in pizzas.

Five stars for ease!  We've tried lots of pizza crusts - Boboli, Freschetta, a premade crust from an independent store, the Trader Joe's pizza dough that you roll out at home... None is quite right.  The Trader Joe's crust was especially frustrating, since it would always start shrinking back when we tried to roll it out.  I threw the ingredients for this crust together and had it rolled out in 15 minutes.  I did mix the yeast and warm water first and let it sit while I got the rest of the ingredients out.  I kneaded just enough to bring the ingredients together, and I was able to roll it out fairly thinly (the way we like it) to fill a cookie sheet with no snap-back problems.  I prebaked for 10 minutes at 400, put on toppings, then baked another 15 minutes.  It turned out crispy at the edges and chewy in the middle... just the way we like it!  My husband is VERY particular about his pizza, and he loved this crust.  Thanks for the recipe!
UPDATE: I've made this four times now and it's been just as easy every time.  Love it!!  I've been wondering if I need the yeast, since I don't allow the dough to rise at all.  Also, my daughter (7 months old) loves this pizza, and it makes a great teething biscuit (when prepared without salt) because it doesn't crumble in her mouth.  I usually use 1 c whole wheat flour and 2 c all-purpose and top with the sauce from World's Best Lasagna (on this site).

Made this in the food processor. All dry ingredients first, mixed, then added water and oil thru tube. So easy. Let rise two hours on counter under damp cloth cuz I had time. Also switched olive oil for vegetable.

I'd give this 5 stars because it definitely gets the proportions right, but as many have pointed out a simple "combine" direction isn't good. You should at least do the following (1) add warm water to yeast first (esp. if you refrigerate your yeast) and allow to dissolve (2) add sugar and let dissolve (3) add salt (more like 1.5 tsp for good flavor) and dissolve (4) add oil. This still only takes about a minute total but allows some proper yeast development. Then, add two cups of the flour and stir together in bowl. Put onto counter-top and knead in another 3/4 to 1 cup of flour and some herbs (oregano, basil, etc.). Then roll out after a couple minutes. In total your prep time is *still* ten minutes but you'll get a much, much better crust!

I LOVE this. I've made it many times just as the recipe requires and it's turned out perfect every time. The great thing about a simple pizza dough recipe like this is that you can do what ever you want for toppings. Since the dough is so easy to make its fun to experiment with too.

Easy, time saving or for a cook like me that decides what to make 10 minutes before she wants to eat =PERFECT! If you are accustomed to making your dough and going thru the 2 rises, and cannot eat anything but, don't try this recipe.  It's tasty, but it is not the dough you might be accustomed to - but it is a keeper if you are short on time and pizza is on the menu.  it's going into my recipe box!!!!

I was skeptical of this dough after all the ingredients were mixed- it was very crumbly. But after I formed the balls and pressed them out they came together. I used this recipe for my young kids and I to make personal pizzas. They were able to do most of it themselves. I poked holes, sprinkled some garlic powder, and rubbed olive oil on them and baked in the oven for about 10 mins before putting the toppings on. I also made pepperoni cheese sticks- fabulous. Overall, a decent recipe. Thx :)

Made as written (no real kneading, no rising), except with addition of spices and prebaked before toppings.  The texture is like really heavy bread, but still delicious.  This is not much like a regular pizza crust, but it was perfect and delicious for a last-minute supper.

Really good crust.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, added italian seasoning & garlic powder to the dough and brushed the dough with some butter after pressing it into the pan.

Pretty good for as simple and quick as the recipe is. I added some Italian seasonings to the dough before our toppings. Make sure you spread it out pretty thin and even because it rises as it bakes!

This came out great. All I added was some fresh italian herbs for a fuller flavor. Thanks for the great recipe, no more delivery for me.

This dough has a great taste and easy to make too.
However for my needs I doubled the recipe to fill a large baking pan then put on the sauce cheese and topings. My family and I like a thick crust and due to the fact that I had loaded on two pounds of cheese and a pound of ground round we need the thicker crust to hold the weight.

This was wonderful!  I read other reviews about it needing some seasonings, so I added 1 tsp. Italian seasoning + 1/8 tsp. garlic powder to mine.  I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, to give it more flavor.  Be sure and grease your pizza pan to avoid sticking.  Thanks for the recipe!

We used this recipe just as it is, except for mixing the yeast with the warm water and sugar.  Then continued with the rest of the ingredients as listed.  Used my Kitchen Aid with my dough hook until well mixed.  I then covered it, while I cut up the other ingredients, then cooked these on the grill!  Delicious!

Great recipe, simple.  Like others have said, if you want a quick, flatter dough, follow directions as is, if you want a thick fluffy dough, take the time to let it rise.  I like to add about 1/4 C of very finely chopped onion to the dough as well as basil. If you add the onion, remember to reduce the water as the onion juices will add liquid.

probably just me but this came out good 2x's but every time after that it doesn't!  the dough is all wrong and doesn't cook right (maybe it's the order of the salt but no matter what I do it's wrong).  have made this like 6x's at least and will no longer.

I added some Italian seasoning to the dough, just because I always do.  It was easy, fast, and my family liked it better than the crust I usually make.  
Two thumbs up!!

Thanks for the great recipe. I am trying to build a little repertoire of super-easy dinners for weeknights. I made no adjustments, just followed the recipe and added our favorite toppings.  The crust was delicious!  My husband and I both loved it.

This is a great QUICK pizza dough.  I normally love a rich doughy taste with homemade breads but the exchange on this one is the time.  It's great when you want to make (or crave?!) pizza but don't have one, want to make pizza healthier or don't want to spend the money on a frozen one or delivery.  I've made this a handful of times now and the ingredient amounts have worked each time.  I haven't tweaked anything.  Will continue to make!  Thank you!

I bake a lot so I don't mind a recipe with a lot of steps, but I'm not going to complain when something soooo easy tastes soooo good.  

If you stretch it thin, this makes a perfect Brooklyn style foldable crust.  If you keep it a little thicker, it gives a great handtossed style crust.  We always make extra dough for a dessert pizza or cinnamon sticks.

This is a great recipe for a quick pizza. If you have time to spare try adding 2 minced garlic cloves into the dough along with 1 tea. fresh minced basil. 
Since I did have extra time I used 1 1/4c. warm water, 3 tabl. extra virgin olive oil in place of the veggie oil, I decreased the salt by half, and allowed it to rise for 1-1/2 hours. 
This recipe is great just the way it is, but if you find you have a little extra time, try adding to it!
Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

Very good, quick, any easy pizza dough. I don't even want to attempt any other recipe. I did use quick rise yeast instead of regular active rise. Perfecto!!! Muah!!! :o)

I LOVE how simple this recipe is.  However, I live overseas, with much smaller ovens than I am used to.  I found that in order for the dough to cook all the way through, I had to put the plain, rolled out dough in the oven for approximately twenty minutes, then put the toppings on and cook another 10-15 minutes.  This recipes works great as a flatbread recipe too, when I use pesto instead of pizza sauce.

This pizza dough is wonderful! My kids wanted pizza for dinner but I didnt want to order out or run to the store and since it was nearly dinner time I didnt have the time to wait for dough to rise, etc so I thought I would give this a try. It turned out great and my family raved about it. We will definitely be using this recipe again!

This is so easy, even a monkey can do it!lol I used my kitchenaid with the dough hook attachment on speed 2 for 7 mins. I plopped it on a greased pan and pressed it down and out to the edges. I then added my toppings (chicken, bbq sauce, cheese and sliced onions) and when I was finished adding the toppings I then pre heated my oven to 400.  I won't be buying Trader Joe's Dough anymore. This one tastes better. So super easy and so yummy. I used Rapid Rise Yeast.

This is simple basic recipe you can add spices to taste to make it better but it's a great base recipe which is what it's was meant to be I think.  So all those that rated it less than 5 stars just didn't get that.  It's simple and ok on it's own.

I made the recipe two ways. Both times I let it sit 30 minutes and then rolled it out. One was exactly as the recipe calls for and it was AWESOME. The second one I used olive oil instead of veg, and I added dried basil, oregano, and garlic powder, IT WAS EVEN MORE AWESOME. great recipe FAST AND CHEAP.

My family loves my pizza's but I never make it cause the dough takes so long and you can waiste a day for 1 pizza.  This dough is excellent, quick and easy.  You got all 5 stars from me!!!!! yes it can be tweaked and made a little better but then it becomes time consuming, especially if you wait for the dough to rise twice. This moves to the front of my recipe box cause I'll be useing it alot.

I love this recipe.  I wouldn't change a thing - when my husband calls on his way home from work with a taste for pizza, this crust is a life saver!  I have used it many times, and will continue to use it.  I love the convenience, taste, and the ease of making this in no time at all!

This is so quick and easy!  I proof the yeast with the water, sugar, and oil first.  I add garlic powder, onion powder, and italian seasoning mix to the flour.  This is my second time to make this recipe and will keep forever!

LOVE this dough. Quick. Easy. Awesome. The only changes I made are dissolving yeast in warm water 1st, then add oil to that.  Mix dry ingredients, add 1/2 to liquid, mix a bit, then add the rest and mix about 2 mins. in standing mixer with dough hook till all clinging to hook and bowl is pretty clean.  Also, use 2 heaping tsps. of sugar instead of 1 Tbs.  Makes 1 very thick crust or 2 thinner crusts.

Wonderful recipe, quick, easy and delicious! I used 2 cups whole grain flour and 1 cup bread flour, to make pizza pockets. They came out just wonderful! The original recipe is just like the pizza dough my sister used to make, and I love it. Easy to roll out or pat into shape. It makes a crisp, thin crust, authentic Italian. If you like the pizza dough fluffier, try baking it without preheating the oven. While the oven warms up, the dough rises a bit, resulting in a lighter and fluffier crust.

Awesome! Perfect texture and perfect taste.  Followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. This is the first recipe that I didn't have to alter.

very very good!  this is the only recipe that we use for dough... I have even made it healthier by doing 1 1/2 cup white flour and 1 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour. I add in some seasoning to the dough just for some added flavor and use olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  We also prebake the crust for 10 mins to keep it from getting soggy

Come on, get real! What more do you want than simple and quick? Its' made  for the life-style we live and delivers as promised. If this doesn't satisfy your special touch, add what ever you want to the dough. If that's not enough, then order home delivery or go buy a a cardboard pizza look-alike at the market. So post your version of a doctored-up frozen box pizza. Go for it!      Just how fast and bad do you want it? I gave this recipe five stars and your criticism a zero until you can do better.

ok Pizza lovers, here we go - all (good) cooks' knows that cooking takes time, short cuts  is ok sometimes, but, I hate it because when we do sit to eat we usually say over and over "damm, I should've let it rise for a few more mins, or I should've let it cook a little more" I did not follow this recipe, however I made a few alterations and it was fantastic 4C AP flour/2pkg yeast/1/4c EVO/2tbs sugar/1-1/2 tsp. salt/1-1/2 c warm water. You will get 2 pizza dough, place water in bowl with yeast (5mins) oil another bowl whisk EVO-sugar&salt and then add to the yeast stir in flour - with serving fork-finish off with hands transfer to oiled bowl, brush with oil and cover with oiled plastic wrap - let rise and it will rise quickly (45mins) place dough on floured surface, knead for a little and divide roll - add your topping bake 375 for 25mins

I totally agree about not making this something it isn't. It is very good. Just made a pizza tonight. I did use olive oil, but only because I wanted to finish the jar. It was easy, fast, and very good. Thanks for a great recipe.

Awesome recipe!  I activated the yeast in the warm water for a few minutes before mixing it in (I've got time for that!) and was very pleased with how nicely this crust puffed up.  Don't forget to poke all over with a fork before baking, and par-bake for 5 minutes or so before putting your toppings on to avoid a soggy middle.  There was really no visible difference between this crust and a crust that has gone through the full rising process.  There may be a very subtle difference in the complexity of the taste and texture, but in my opinion it's slight, and not worth waiting for if time is an issue for you.  Thanks for this recipe!

This recipe is perfect just the way it is written.  You can let it rise if you wish, but as another reviewer commented, the results are the same.  For all you out there who think you need to add more flavor - IT'S IN THE TOPPINGS!!!  If your pizza is bland - check the sauce you are using.

I seriously do not understand how this recipe could have such high ratings. I just made it per instrctions and it was yucky. It was heavy and tasted like flour, never rose in cooking....and yes, my yeast was fresh. Bummer :(

For a pizza dough I could make this quickly, this is awesome! It's denser than other pizza crusts I've had (because it doesn't have much time to rise), but it's not a deal breaker at all. I would however throw the crust in the oven on its own for a few minutes next time before topping it, just so the middle can cook up a bit more.

Amazing, it is faster than take-out not to mention tastes SOOO much better. If you are having problems with the crust not being doughy in the middle, before you top the pizza put it in the oven for 5 to 10 mins and take it out when it is still slightly doughy, top it and then cook till the cheese is bubbly.

I did do the proofing of the yeast like the yeast package and others here suggested... also added some garlic and onion powder to the dry ingredients.  Let the dough rise about 30 mins, punched down and spread into a 9x13 greased dish, baked for 5 minutes, then put all the ingredients and baked for 20 mins.  Used the BBQ Chicken recipe on this site and this was DELISH!  Thick deep-dish crust, could have easily made 2 thin to medium thickness crust.  Will definitely make this again!

This was an amazing pizza dough recipe and so simple! My kids loved it. I made the dough and let it sit for a little bit like another review said. Then as it was sitting we made bread sticks out of more dough, we added Italian seasoning from McCormick. They were the best bread sticks we have had and the pizza was delicious!  I did use Olive Oil instead but everything else was the same.

I have been making my own pizza for a while, with my own sauce, I tried this recipe for the dough and it was pretty good.  But off hand from my own pizza making experiance, there is something that needs to be done that is not said in the recipe.  First is that after you combine the ingredients the dough needs to be kneaded for a minute or two, this is very important as it activated the glutten in the dough.  The dough needs to rise, it is very heavy if you do not and kneading is important to the texture of the dough.  Also I have always drizzled a little olive oil (not much!) after I put my sauce on this prevents the dough from drying out.  Overall the recipe is pretty good.

this is the perfect pizza dough and it doesnt require the dough to rise. The only thing i did differently, is i use cornmeal to roll out the dough so its a little crunchier.

It is a good dough very doughy though I would like it a little crispier so like someone mentioned earlier if you add water to the yeast and then to dry indregients it might be crispier it is like a thick doughy heavy bread. Very Filling!

While this recipe wasn't my ideal pizza crust, it was exactly what it was intended to be: a quick and easy pizza crust that would make an adequate base for sauce and toppings.  Because of that, I gave it 5 stars. My biggest complaint was that it was very bread-y and dense (I took care in not over-mixing).  Like I said, not my favorite but true to what it's supposed to be: a quick and easy crust!

This is a great recipe! I had time to let it rise because I was making the sauce and cutting up the toppings so I just put the dough in the oven with the oven off but the oven light on and it doubled within the hour. Then I just shaped it, topped it and baked it and it was perfect. Thanks for the recipe!

Instead of making a pizza out of this dough, I made rolls. What I did is let it rise, pat it down and let it rise again. Then I worked it for about 15 or 30 minutes. Then I baked it as normal in rolls. They where the best rolls I have ever eaten, and that is saying a lot! Make sure to use rapid rise yeast, or you will be waitin for it to rise for hours instead of like 10 or 20 minutes.  ~Pizzamaster47

This pizza dough was fast and easy.  I did have to bake it a little longer than expected as it came out doughy even after I pre-baked it without any toppings.  It had good flavor.

I made pizza for dinner tonight and used this recipe for the first time.  I doubled the quantity (I sent some to my sister)and added grated pecorino and grana padano cheeses for extra flavour (which is what I always do when making pizza dough).  I also cooked it for 5-10 mins before adding the topping just to be on the safe side!  My brother-in-law (who has an Italian background) called and asked where I bought the base from!  He thought it was great as it was thin (as I had intended it to be), and crispy.  The reason it gets 5 stars is because my nephew, who is a VERY fussy eater and usually only eats store bought pizza, ate the whole slice and didn't even leave the outer crust!  Yaay!  Thanks for the recipe!

Perfect for a fast and easy pizza dough recipe!  Just a note that it does make a thing crust.  And I usually use half whole wheat and half white flour to make the crust a little more healthy.

knocked it up a notch by throwing in some Pizza Seasoning that came with a spice rack I bought. It really made a big difference. I also mixed the water, yeast and sugar together and let it sit for five minutes to let the yeast do it's thing before I mixed it in with everything else. It made it a little puffier, which I prefer.

I made it the first time with traditional yeast and it was good but not as good as the batch I had stored in the fridge for a couple of days.  The next time, I used instant dry active yeast and it was perfect!  I preheated a stone in the oven and placed the pizza on the hot stone.  It was SO good!  I don't think I could go back to store-bought or take-out pizza!  A gem!

This is the perfect recipe for a quick dough.  I made a complete pizza in about 45 min.  A couple of things I found convenient:  I oiled the top of the dough and placed it in a metal bowl in the oven while the oven preheated.  After a couple of minutes it was nice and warm and super easy to spread on a greased pan.  Then I prebake the dough before adding sauce and toppings.  I usually make dough in the bread machine, and that takes 1 1/2 hours.  this dough was ready to bake in just 10 min.  Perfect!

I've made this recipe many times and not reviewed it.  Let me just say, that it's awesome!  I usually take the extra time to let the dough rest (at least half an hour) after kneeding it in my food processor or by hand.  If I have extra time I just throw it all in the bread machine on the dough cycle.  I always use olive oil instead of vegetable and I usually cut the recipe in half and it makes a great thin crust 14-16 inch pizza!  I have found that this dough doesn't freeze well, so either make half the recipe or make 2 pizzas, or make one and some breadsticks!

My kids were starving, we wanted to make a pizza FAST, so we used this recipe because you do not have to wait for the dough to rise. We followed the direction to a tee, and I will from now on use this pizza dough recipe. It was delicious! Crispy and not too thick and had a great pizza dough flavor.  I agree with one other reviewer, if you are going to pick a recipe and make changes to the original recipe to make it yours, just go ahead and post your own recipe!! 5 stars!!

O.k., so I tried the recipe out on the taste tasters in my house, just with marinara & cheese...they liked it just fine, then I made it again, same way, added dried basil and garlic to the recipe and it was a super hit...then, "drum roll" made it again, topped it with leftover homemade teriyaki sauce/chicken (recipe from allrecipes)that I had made the day before (no marinara), pineapple chunks, carmelized onions and just a bit of shredded basil and fresh moz....and, eureka! I am now the pizza pie queen of my home. It was a huge huge hit!  I've also used the recipe for bread sticks, flat bread, cinnamon rolls (I know, I know)and everything about it works and is simple!

This was so easy and quick to make.  I followed the directions and it came out great.  I've never made a pizza dough that I didn't let rise, but this was quick and easy and tasted delicious.  Highly recommended for those who don't have time to allow for the dough to rise.

Excellent and easy recipe.  I let dough rise for about 20 min., spread in pizza pan, and bake at 350 for 10 min. Remove from oven and using a paper towel, lightly coat the top of the pizza crust with olive oil.  Cool for 15 min. and then you are ready to add your sauce and toppings.

Perfect as-is...if you are in a hurry and still want real pizza dough taste, this is the recipe.  I used fast-rise yeast and the crust was nice and chewy/crispy. We made half veggie/half anchovies and it even tastes good with anchovies

This dough is great in a pinch.  It was Very dense.  I added italian seasoning to it for some flavor.  We will definitely use this again if pressed for time.   Jay's signature crust is great if you have the time.

A good (not great) quick dough recipe.  It's beauty is in it's simplicity and in how quickly it comes together.  But if you use 1/2 cup less flour, and then add more as/if needed, it won't take you any longer to make, and it will turn out better.

This was so easy, but with the lack of directions, I assumed it would make only one crust-Wrong! I doubled the recipe to make 2 pizzas. I let the dough rest for just a few minutes while I got the sauce ready (Pizza Sauce and Dough recipe from this site)  Patted dough into cookie sheets as we don't have pizza pans. Topped pizzas with less sauce than I usually use (I read here that helps make a better, less soggy pizza) and onions, peppers, pepperoni and cheese. Baked about 20 min.  The crust was crunchy, but too thick and bread-like for us.  It had a good flavor though.  Next time I will just one a single batch and spread it thinner.

I was really pleased with how this dough turned out. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, 2 tsp Italian seasoning, and 1 tsp garlic. I also ended up using a bit less than 3 cups of flour. I really love how quick and simple this is. I used a regular cookie sheet because I don't have a pizza pan, and it baked up beautifully!

I have to admit that I was skeptical of this recipe at first, because I've never heard of using yeast and not letting it rise. I was in a hurry and decided to try and it and I'm glad I did!!! Best recipe ever-I wouldn't tamper with it or change a thing.  It always turns out perfect and is the closest I've ever come to restaurant style crust. I like to top it with a 3 cheese combo-mozzarella, parmesan and cheddar-delicious!!!!!!

Perfect pizza crust. The first time I made it my husband said, "Wow, this is REALLY good." Great to use half whole-wheat, half white flour.

This is my FAVORITE pizza dough recipe, no one can believe it is as quick and easy as it is... I have to admit I used to make Baking Mix pizza dough when I was in a time crunch, and this one is just as easy and tastes AMAZING!  I don't change a thing. PERFECT!

THIS WAS A MARVELOUS PIZZA DOUGH RECIPE. GREAT AND VERY QUICK AND SIMPLE TO MAKE.  IF YOUR WANTING MORE OUT OF THE DOUGH THEN IT WILL REQUIRE MORE TIME.  BUT THIS IS EXACTLY AS STATED QUICK! FOR THOSE WHO COMPLAINED REREAD THE RECIPE IT DOESN'T SAY TO ADD ALL EXTRA STEPS. THIS IS A QUICK BASIC PIZZA CRUST NOT A FANCY RECIPE.  THIS ONE IS A SURE FIRE KEEPER NOT TO DRY AND MADE EXACTLY AS THE RECIPE STATED.  THANKS FOR THE RECIPE....ITS A SURE WINNER!!!

I didn't want  to give this recipe any stars because pizza crust is one of those things that is so individualized that to rate a recipe poorly doesn't help, in my opinion.  But I had no choice.  I prefer a crunchier, thin crust while my husband likes a doughy thicker crust.  Neither one of us cared for this one but that doesn't make it bad, just not what we prefer.  I proofed the yeast, mixed everything and let it rise for 25 minutes, punched it down, let it rise again for 10 minutes and cooked it on a pizza stone.  It didn't stretch very well like I'm used to.  The thinner center didn't hold up to the sauce and cheese well, and the outer edge had a thick dense texture.  Again just not our bag of chips.  I'll try another recipe.

Sorry...this was just awful. I bake with yeast a lot and have never really trusted the recipes where you don't dissolve the dry yeast first. This just proved my instinct. It was rubbery, tasteless, didn't rise even during the cooking time. Nope, won't use this again!

YUMMY Pizza crust. I followed several reviewers' advice and reduced flour to 2 1/2 cups and let dough rise for one hour. I also substituted in 1 cup of whole wheat flour. Turned out great.

I think I was pretty good. It was easy o make, although I think you should let it rise for about a half hour before kneading it, if not it gets a bit tough. Oh, and also, I found that baking the dough by its self for about eight minutes on the oven with olive oil on top really makes a big difference in taste! Overall It was great.

I have to say this is the easiest pizza dough I ever made. I did however let it rise for 30 min. I did mix the yeast and sugar together for about 10 min. I also added around 2 tsp of italian seasoning in it and some garlic powder. It turns out so perfect. I have used this dough for calzones too and its great. I recommend this recipe!

I dissolved the yeast in 1 1/2 cups warm water first, worked the dough and let it rise 45 mins, worked it again and let rise another 10 mins before rolling out 4 small crusts.  I made it a bit more diabetic friendly and healthier by using 1 cup of wheat flour, 1 1/4 cup of white flour and 3/4 cup of soy flour.  I also added a TBSP of oregano, 1 tsp of onion powder and a tsp of ground thyme to the flour mixture.
The kids loved it so much they had to make pizza again tonight!

Very good crust. I actually made 3 batches of this and had a Calzone party. I premade the dough a couple hours ahead of time and refrigerated it so I wouldn't have to worry about all that while trying to prep everything else. I rolled it out and each batch made about 3-4 calzone circles. Everyone at the party commented on how good they were. I didn't add anything to the recipe and just let each individual season their own the way they desired. This is another one chalked up as one of my picky husbands favories! Thank you!

This was great and so fast and easy!!!  I only used about 2 3/4 cup flour and added 3 tablespoons of olive oil in place of the vegetable oil. I added about 2 tsps of rosemary herb seasoning.  I also let the dough rest for about 30 minutes as another reviewer suggested.  I then rolled the crust and pre-baked it for about 10 minutes at 400 degrees, then took it out, added my sauce and cheese, and baked it for another 20 minutes. I baked it most of the time on a pizza stone, but for the last 10 minutes I took it off the stone and did it directly on the oven rack to firm the dough up a bit.  The pizza turned out Fantastic!  My husband couldn't believe I made the dough myself!  And my kids also devoured it! Thanks for the recipe, I will definately be using this again!

Pizza on Saturday nights at our house is a tradition. I've been looking for a new pizza crust that everybody likes and I've found it! This is delicious . . . moist, soft, fluffy and flavorful. Even my cousins who are very picky eaters, especically when it comes to pizza, loved it.  I did proof my yeast and let the dough knead a few minutes in the bread machine.  I also added a clove of minced garlic and about 1/2 tsp of Italian seasonings to my tripled batch of dough. I let it rise 10 min. (just enough to make rolling it out easier). Oh and the last time I made it I used half whole wheat flour and nobody seemed to notice or mind. It cooked beautifully and everybody couldn't wait for it to come out of the oven. I'll be usuing this recipe from now on.

What an easy recipe for pizza dough! I did take extra time to add some changes to the recipe. I proofed the yeast with the sugar and warm water, threw the rest of ingredients in along with some dried herbs (basil, thyme,  oregano) and freshly minced garlic, formed a ball, covered with a plastic wrap, and let it rise for 30 minutes. Then I kneaded the dough, then rolled it out (it was pretty difficult rolling it out thin enough), poked holes with fork, baked for 5 minutes, topped it with chunky tomato sauce that I had improvised, sprinkled mozzarella cheese, brushed the crust with olive oil, and finished baking. I wasn't sure how thinly I was supposed to roll out the dough, or how much it will rise during cooking.   Next time, I'll roll it out thinner, line the edges with some sticks of fresh mozzarella, roll up the dough around, to create cheese-filled crust. These will make excellent bread sticks!

Not bad but not the best I've ever made.  I added some extra seasoning - pepper, garlic powder, italian seasoning.  My problem was that the dough was a little too soft and after it sat for 15 minutes it was even softer.  Not quite soggy though.  If I had baked it any longer the toppings and cheese would have burned.  But I had to give it 3 stars for ease of preparation and the overall taste was decent.

we loved this. It was so quick and easy. Used olive oil instead of veggy, also after rolling it out, sprinkled with garlic powder, Italian seasoning and walnut oil.

Wow!!!!  I really didn't think this was going to come out as good as it did.  It sounded to quick and easy.  It seemed as though the recipe did need more water than called for.  I think I used 1.5 cups of water.  That made a very soft dough that was easy to work with.  I may never order a pizza again.  From the time I started and finished my pizza it was probably 1/2hr. Next time, however, I think I will try this recipe with bread flour.
Thank you so much for this great recipe.

I doubled this recipe and was able to make a small pizza and 5 calzones but I didn't take into account that the dough would rise so much while baking! The calzones ended up huge! I added some dried herbs and garlic powder and substituted some of the white flour for whole wheat (2 cups for a double batch). I ended up using more water than the recipe called for, not sure how much I eyeballed it. All in all this is a great recipe, next time I'll throw in some parm cheese, yum!

Third time was a charm...had to adjust recipe for my oven, preferences, etc..  I did allow yeast to dissolve and the dough to  rise, and I split the dough in half (I like my pizza thinner).  I started baking at the bottom rack of the oven, then switched to the top rack (saw many pizza bakers do this in restaurants).  The pizza came out exactly the way I wanted it.  Thanks!

This was a great easy recipe for pizza dough to make.  I added 2 tablespoons of minced garlic and some rosemary to the dough and it was awesome.  Always easy to get dough to rise if you proof yeast in warm water with or without the sugar for ten  min.  I also cooked it for 8 min in the oven before putting on the toppings.  Kids loved it. I have also used this recipe to make calazones...

This was really good.  I did follow the advice of other reviewers and let it rise for about 30 minutes.  I also added some oregano, basil, and rosemary to the dough for some flavor.  I pre-cooked the dough for about 5 minutes before adding the sauce, toppings, and cheese.  We baked it in a cast iron pan.  It was a little denser than I wanted, but still good.   Hubby wants me to make again for lunch tomorrow.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great pizza dough recipe. I added some chopped rosematy to the dough to give it a little extra flavor; however, it would be great with out it. I too added the sugar, water, and yeast together first. I also let the dough rise a bit while I chopped my veggies. I did not bake the dough as others have. I did not find it needed to be pre-baked because I like my dough soft. We had a great family night by everyone making their own pizzas. I made two batches for 3 adults and 2 kids since we are big pizza eaters! This is a keeper!

This has become a family standard.  I make two medium pizzas with this recipe and follow it as written.  I cook one on a pizza stone and one in a metal pizza pan.  We actually like the one in the pan better.  I continue to cook the one on the stone while I'm cutting the other to get it a little crisper.  Because I don't have to wait for it to rise, I can start it when I walk in the door from work and have dinner on the table in a reasonable time.

Couldn't agree more with other reviewers.  This dough required being baked at least 8 minutes prior to adding toppings.  Beyond that, it really worked for my family.  It's great with a variety of eaters and serves as a staple to have around.

This was really good.  I made a few changes as per other reviewers.  I mixed the yeast, water and sugar together and let double. Then I let the dough rise for 30 minutes.  I cooked the dough without toppings for 8 minutes.  Next time I'll add some herbs.

Good, quick recipe. I sprayed the top with nonstick cooking spray after patting the dough into a pan, and let it rise for 30 minutes in a warm, dark place.  Then I poked it down and finished according to the recipe.  It came out soft rather than crispy, but still good.

We made this with wheat flour, with 1 1/4 cup of flour, kneaded the dough and covered in a bowl with a damp towel for a while to let it rise and then rolled it out very thin and baked it in 10 x 15 inch jelly roll pan and it turned out really really good!  The only thing we are going to do different next time is to let the yeast do its magic and let it rise longer.

I've made this recipes two times.  The first time, it was a little bland, so the second time, I added Garlic Powder, about 2T salt and Parmesan Cheese.  It helped add extra flavor that was needed.  It's a good dough if you're impatient like me.

The last time I made pizza, I used storebought pizza dough that turned out bitter and disgusting. Then tonight I tried this dough out because it looked simple to make and I had all the ingredients available. It didn't have that bitter taste and was soft, tasty, and breadlike. It was interesting, a little different than regular pizza dough, and easier than easy to make. This recipe made enough dough for a whole cookie sheet pan pizza! It fed my family of 6. I will use this recipe again when I make homemade pizza.

good, basic, easy recipe, I suggest using this for a fry bread recipe as well, roll into 6 inch circles, brown quickly in olive oil, top with refried beans, meat and cheese or with cinnamon and sugar for a dessert treat. Easy and kid friendly!

It was fast to make, which is great when you forget to make dough ahead of time.  I left out the oil to make it even lower in fat and just added a little extra water.  I also added garlic salt instead of regular salt.  Turned out good.

I used olive oil & italian seasons as suggested by some of the others, but this recipe just wasn't what I was looking for.  It was still rather bland and wouldn't brown.  I finally took it out of the oven but the crust was pale and hard.  I'll keep looking...but thanks for sharing.  I'm glad that lots of others like the recipe!

This pizza dough is way better than average and more than qualifies as incentive enough to forget pizza delivery.  I made a double batch and used five cups of flour rather than six and it worked just fine.  I hand mixed the dough for a long time, following other reviewers recommendation of letting the dough sit for 30 minutes.  I'm glad I did.  The dough increased in size a LOT in the oven, so although I was concerned the pizza may be too thin, after rising in the oven, it was actually close to being too thick.  Just don't worry if it looks to thin when you put it in the oven - it will rise even more.  I used "Exquisite Pizza Sauce" which can be found on this website and flat out loaded my pizzas (I made two) with hamburger, canadian bacon, onion, pepperoni and cheese for a truly incredible meal.

This turned out perfect!  My husband can even do this one by himself.  We found we liked it a little more if we let it rise for about half an hour before baking (already rolled out onto the pizza stone).  Not so great for breadsticks in my opinion but the rest of my family found them fabulous.  Definently give this one a try for homemade pizza.

This was extremely easy to make but I wish I had read the reviews before doing it.  It was a little flat and the next time I will use olive oil and add seasonings.  I'm also trying less flour.  It made a huge pizza and it rose nicely.

Very easy but no one would eat it cause it taste like cardboard.  It did rise though.  Next time I'd like to add some seasonings to it.

this recipe is great!  it was quick, easy and tastes better than any yeast dough i've tried in the past.   the 3c. flour worked fine for me, i kneaded the dough however, so maybe that worked it in.  thanks!

who knew somthing could taste so good and only take you about 5 min to make! I made a cheese pizza with it. Other pizza recipes call for leaving the dow in the fridge for hours to rise. well i don't have that kind of time! This was the best pizza i ever made. My whole family loved it and wants it every week instead of our "pizza hut" pizza night.

One of the best home made pizza dough. 
After reading some of the reviews from other people! I can a sure you that I have the easiest and fastest way to make it.  Change de recipe a little it bit. 1 1/4 cup of water, 1 tbs of sugar, 2 tbs of olive oil, 1 tbs of Italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp of salt, and the package of yeast. In a bowl Mix first, the yeast, oil, sugar, water, Italian seasoning and salt all together. Than add the flour. With your hands combine everything together and knead the dough for about 8 minutes forming a ball. Spray the same bowl with oil put back the dough and covere it with a plastic wrap, and let the dough rest for 10 minutes in room temperature.! That should do. Dough should be soft and easy to work with it.!

Seriously, this dough is so easy, I've made it up in the middle of the woods while camping. It says you dont need to let it rise.  I've used it both ways, unrisen and after letting it rise.  Still a great dough!  I usually bloom the yeast, water, and sugar separately, letting it foam for a few minutes. I'll add it to the flour, salt, and oil and then knead for a few minutes.  Then comes the debate - To rise or to use.  :)  Sometimes, depending on what type of pizza I'm making, I add herbs to the flour.  Rosemary. Thyme. Oregano.  Whatever you like!  This recipe makes A LOT of dough!  When you only have 2.5 people to feed, you can easily cut the dough in half and freeze the unused half for a later time.  My cooking/baking tip - If you have a cast iron griddle, use that to bake on.  Spread a little cornmeal on the griddle and then spread your dough out.  Add toppings and bake!

This is a cool recipe, and it was so easy. I doubled the recipe as I have a big up crew to feed, and I found that while I was working with the first half of the dough, the second half proofed a little bit an was nice and soft and easier to work with than the first half, so I would recommend letting the dough rest for about ten minutes before you form it into your crust. That's jut about long enough to prepare all of the toppings, so it still saves time. I also think that brushing the crust with a little butter or olive oil after baking to make it a little easier to eat, as it was a bit too hard for my taste. I also think this would be delicious with some fresh herbs and cheese added to the crust. My whole fan enjoyed this recipe and I'll will be using this as my go to recipe for pizza, calzones, or even a flatbread. Thanks a bunch for such a neat recipe.

this was a good recipe but I made the change of putting the yeast, water and sugar in a bowl and stir until smooth then let it stand for 10-15 mins until it has a consistency like pudding on the top before adding the other ingredients. I doubled my recipe to have 5 small pizzas. I also couldn't find my thermometer so I just did the water by touch.

I followed the directions as written and the dough came out perfect with a few minor changes. After mixing my dry ingredients I added garlic powder and Italian seasoning. I then added the water and olive oil. Once I kneaded the dough and I let it sit to rise about 30 minutes. I then spread it in the pan and baked for five minutes then added my toppings. Perfect!!

I've made this dough several times. And we love it. My kids will not touch any other pizza then our homemade. I love pizza with thin crust just the way its made in Europe and this is it. It makes nice 3 medium size pizzas.
For best results we always bake the crust for about 5 minutes on a hot pizza stone (poke some holes in the crust to prevent bubbling) then we ad the toppings and bake some more until the crust is done. 
Thank you for great and easy recipe!!!

I've made this dough many times. Sometimes I proof the yeast, sometimes I add spices, and sometimes I just do as the recipe says- add mix and bake. And in my opinion, it works no matter what. Fail proof and quick.

I was the GM of a pizzeria that made their dough from scratch. We had many return customers that came just because of our dough. This is so similar to that dough (which was made in huge batches) and when I  made it, we were extremely pleased with it.

For a quick and easy dough this recipe really impresses! I did add a tablespoon of honey, basil flakes and garlic powder (about a tblsp each, but I looove garlic and basil)...I also let it 'rise' for 15 minutes while I whipped up some brownie batter (from a box but who cares?) ...put my toppings on and baked it for 15-20 minutes @ 425 (personal preference for my oven) ---- this pizza crust came out FAR better than any of the drive thru or chain pizzas. Delicious, fast and easy - it made pizza making EASY.

The crust is also great for stuffing. I used whole wheat flour instead and I stuffed cheddar strings in the edges and it still held that stuffing perfectly. I would recommend this crust for deep dish pizzas. Very good recipe. Thanks for sharing.

This made a good enough crust - I added parmesean cheese, garlic, and basil to the dry mix.  It wasn't really different than any other home made pizza dough I have tried.  It seemed a bit heavy; but my dough always seems to come out too heavy...regardless of what recipe I use.

I followed this easy recipe exactly and got a brick! If I would have thrown this at someone, it would have killed them. I DO live at a little bit of a high altitude, 3000 feet, and it was cold and dry today, so maybe that is what went wrong, but if so, this would be the first time. I just can't understand how else a recipe with so many great reviews turned out so bad for me.
 I added nearly double the amount of warm water and finally got something doughy. It spread out nicely in the pizza pan--that's the one thing I can say was good about it. The crust ended up tasting like cardboard. We ate it because we were hungry, (which is why I looked for a fast and easy recipe in the first place!) but I won't make it again...unless I have an enemy ;P

This was my first time ever making homemade pizza. (I made the sauce and dough). The recipe was super easy. The only change I had to make was to add more water because dough was too hard and not mixing properly. THIS makes a really thick crust, almost Chicago-style, so beware.

I like how easy this recipe is, but it's a little sweeter than I'd prefer.  I don't get yeast in packages, so I used 2 1/4 tsp from the jar.  And also, since my sisters and I like pizza differently, I divided the dough into three pieces.  We used 9-in pie plates, and topped them uniquely.
Maybe next time I'll use 2 tsp sugar?
Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Quick, easy, and no fuss.  Whipped this up on a holiday when I realized the neighborhood pizza place was closed and it was an instant hit.  Mine needed to cook longer than recommended, but other than that it was perfect!  I would recommend par-cooking the dough for 10 mins before you put the toppings on.

I've made this dough several times, and each time it tastes better. i suggest letting the dough rise as long as you can 30 mins to 2 hrs. when i left it for 2 hrs the difference was amazing, but even if you don't let it rise the dough is still good. I added a little garlic & oregano into the dough. Fabulous!!! My 6 yr old does not eat pizzeria pizza, but when i make my own using this recipe she eats it all. Love Love Love this recipe!!!

I thought the crust turned out hard. I kneaded the dough and let it rise and spread it in a pan but still the dough was to thick and hard.  Next time I try pizza dough I'll buy a pizza stone to cook it on maybe that was the problem.

Love it, so easy!  I just throw everything in my bread maker so no mess!  I add about 2 tablespoons of mixed herbs.  I let it rise then pound down and spread on sheet.  Then let rise again and push down right before pre-baking for about 5 min.  Perfect!  Better than any pizza place around us!

My family loved it!! No more store bought Sam's club boxed pre-made crusts. This was so quick, easy, and delicious. Very COST effective for a big family. Add some extra seasoning to the mix and it is amazing!!! We put everything in our KitchenAid mixer and turned on the dough hook. Five minutes and we rolled it out on pizza stone. YUMMY!

I put it at 425 because I didn't have time to wait... the crust stuck to the bottom of the pan...not sure why...  I have to say pretty good though...   I'm thinking more salt not much flavor to the crust... I added garlic and spaghetti season to the crust.  We made two batches... and the one that we needed and let rise for a bit turned out way better.

OMG!  This was the easiest pizza dough I ever made and it was Soooo Good!  Honestly, this dough almost tasted like what I bought from a restaurant for a pizza party I had.  I also only used 2 1/2c of flour, 3 tbls of olive oil & some spices.  I will definately use this recipe all the time.  Thx A Million!!!

I loved this recipe!!! I really wanted Pizza for dinner, but it was getting late, and I didn't want to spend hours waiting for the dough to rise... But this worked perfectly! I wasn't that rushed, so I took the time to dissolve the yeast, water, sugar, and oil together and let it sit for a couple of minutes. As other users suggested, after kneading the dough I tossed in some dried herbs to flavor it. It turned out really yummy!

Never knew that I could make such a great pizza dough, so effortlessly! We always double the dough, because we find that one is not enough :) We bake at the bottom of the oven first to crust the bottom of the pan, and then at the top for a golden finish! Very delicious!

I agree with the anti-nit-pickers. I made this recipe as-is and it was fabulous! It rose just like you want a pizza crust to rise. The ONLY thing I did differently was bake for 5 minutes before adding toppings. If you want to put your own twist on it, go ahead, but don't deny a great recipe 1/2 a star because you felt like tossing in some basil.

Recipe as is... Fabulous!  This is not time consuming, it does not need time to rise.  It's quick, it's easy and that's what I was looking for.  May be even better with a 1/2 tsp.  more salt, but I hate it when people review with alterations!  This recipe great as is!

Tips for good rise.  DO NOT use tap water if your water is chlorinated, it will kill your yeast.  Make sure your water is also the correct temperature (too hot... kills yest, too cool, does not wake up yeast). 

BREAD MAKER:  this can be done in the bread maker for an even easier crust!
Place ingredients in the following order:
water, sugar, yeast, oil
Flour
Salt
Run your bread maker on the dough setting. When mixing is complete tip out onto lightly floured pizza stone and roll.

Everyone I've made this for has thoroughly enjoyed it.  For what it is - a fast, easy dough - it it does its job well.  I do add an extra step - I knead the dough then let it rest 10-15 minutes to relax the gluten.  After that, I make the crust without letting it rise as per the recipe and it turns out great.  Definitely par-bake the crust if you aren't using a pizza stone.

I have made this at least twice a week since I discovered this recipe about a month ago. I've used it for pizza, for flatbread (brushed with olive oil, very thinly sliced onion, finely grated cheddar cheese). The only change I discovered was letting the dough rest about 5 - 10 minutes to give flour the chance to absorb the liquid better. I knead it in the bowl for just a moment, then it's ready to go. Fabulous recipe!

PERFECT dough recipe and just how I like a pizza crust. It makes for a very "fluffy" skillet type crust. After the initial mixing and a bit of kneading I do add a bit more flour as its a fairly sticky dough.

Made this tonight as written, except for using whole wheat flour instead of white.  Turned out well...no chew to the crust, but tasted good and is great for a fast easy pizza dough.  I'll probably look for another recipe that has more chew, but will keep this in reserve for nights when I need to make dinner fast.  Thanks!

Very good, quick dough. I was babysitting an 8-year-old and we made this together and we both thought it turned out great! We added some italian seasoning to the dough, but besides that stayed true to the recipe. Was great! Perfect for when you're in a hurry and don't have time to let it rise for an hour.

Easy! Followed directions and ingredients as listed.  Used it for pan pizza and put it in the oven for almost 5 minutes to 'seal it off' before topping.  Was not bland, as some have suggested.  Will definitely used this recipe again.

Very good started recipe!  I followed another reviewer's recommendations and it turned out very flavorful! 
1 1/4 cups warm water, 1 pkg active dry yeast, 1 tblsp sugar, 1 tsp thyme or Italian seasonings, 3 tblsp olive oil, 3+ cups of flour, 1 tsp salt. Mix water, yeast, sugar & oil in mixer bowl. Then add flour & salt. Mix-knead for 10-12 minutes, sprinkling with flour to keep from sticking to bowl. Dough should be elastic & smooth. Place dough in oiled bowl, cover dough with oil, cover & let stand 1 hr at room temp. Then divide dough 2 equal parts roll into balls, cover with damp towel & let stand another 10 mins. Use immediately. Don't forget to poke holes into dough with fork once rolled onto pan to let steam escape while baking.

Easy and fast recipe.  I added some Italian seasoning, Garlic powder, and used Olive oil as other some others have suggested.  My kids had fun making their own personal pizza's.  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious and so easy. I made it as written and was very happy with it. Next time I'll add some spices and experiment with it.

We love this recipe. Both as is (using bread machine directions) and for breadsticks.  Cornmeal on the bottom of the pan, sprinkle with parm, bake for 10-15 minutes. They are a hit!

I prefer to add the yeast to warm water and wait for it to disolve, but that's just me. It is a good recipe though.

This was quick. I had to change it up a bit for what I had on hand which was only whole wheat flour and agave nectar. Still came out great and tasty will be doing this over and over again for sure!!! Kids loved it too!!!

This is a wonderful recipe as is!  The point is efficiency, and very little is sacrificed texture and flavor-wise.  Consumers always rave, and never believe that it is as simple as 6 ingredients and 5 minutes of mixing!

Perfect!  Use if for chicago style deep dish pizza in a casserole dish and it is wonderful!  I cover the dough with a moist cloth and let it rise for about 20 minutes.

Simple recipe for a quick and easy pizza dough.  If you want a little more flavor, swap out the salt for garlic salt and add a tablespoon of oregano, basil or Italian seasoning.  Been making this one for years and it is my go to recipe for homemade pizza!

This was good for a quick, get-it-on-the-table meal.  But I think I like Jay's Signature Pizza Crust better, especially if I have the time for the rising.***Update 4-24-13 I finally got this dough to do what I want. I made it and spread it out on my pizza stone. Then I let it rest for 30 minutes. I baked it for 15 minutes. Then I added my toppings and baked it for 10-15 more minutes. Perfect!

I thought this would be a great on the go recipe and taste good. Oh man was I wrong. My crust turned out hard and dense (not a good dense). I'll stay with a traditional crust which allows rising time, for a fluffier, airy crust.

This dough turned out perfect.  I found a package of fleischmans "pizza crust" yeast at the market and used that instead of the regular active dry yeast.  I'm sure it wouldn't make a difference though.  Everyone wondered if I had purchased the dough pre-made!  Its super easy to make, and if you happen to let it rest/rise before baking, that's turns out fine too!  We separated the dough into a few mini pizzas and baked them in our oven on top of some parchment paper, on a heated pizza stone.

This pizza dough was as advertised basic and quick!  I made it Saturday night and our pizza was ready in no time.  I completely appreciated how quickly our meal came together, however, I would try to flavour the dough somewhat the next time I make it with herbs or garlic as it was a bit on the bland side despite the numerous toppings we had on the pizza.  This is the reason I only gave it four stars. Great recipe and will be my go to for future pizzas!

i was looking for a quick and easy pizza dough that i could throw together in no time and this seemed to be it. the dough never really came together. it was almost like playdoh where if the lid is a bit open, some hard crustiness develops. not all the flour would mix and i had to throw a good 1/2 c of bits out. after cooking it came out like chewy bread. my kids didnt complain though. i realized that i didnt have to use the yeast at all for this. i added in some spices as well to taste. i wouldnt make this for myself, instead my kids can mix and eat. this is more of a kids pizza dough.

I agree with RenaK - super simple, and depending on the mood I add tastefully simple garlic-garlic, or onion-onion, or sometimes parmesian, etc...no measuring, just pour it in with the rest of the dry ingredients and go...perfect recipe to change it out as the ingredients permit! excellent! baked up beautifully, thank you!

Very easy and versatile recipe that yields a tender, flatbread-like crust.  We added 2 cloves of crushed garlic, some basil, and an Italian Herbs mixture from Durkee.  We will be making this again for sure, and we're already talking about what other herbs and spices we can add. Thanks for this recipe, it was perfect!

This is such a great recipe. It's quick. It's easy..and yes I did tweek it the second time I made it. Instead of vegetable oil, I used olive oil. I also used a quick rise active dry yeast, it made the dough less dense.  I let this set for about 15 20 min before I made the pizza. I used a pizza stone at 400 degree with a little cornmeal on the bottom. This was a really good flavor. I will be using this over and over again.

Simple, good and easy. I followed the recipe as is and, although it didn't rise like a pizzeria crust would, the taste was fine, more of a crispy crust. I made the dough in my mixer and just left it in there to rest while I got eveything else together - 45 minutes - and it doubled in size. I was able to make 2 10" pizza crusts.

We made this today and it was fabulous!  My eight year old son wanted to make mini pizzas like they sell in Trader Joe's.  He used cookie cutters and made a lot of mini pizzas in assorted shapes.  His twin sister used the other half of the dough to make her own pizza.  This one has gone into my Recipe Box and will be a regular one in my house!  Great rainy day activity for kids because it is quick.  Keep yeast on hand for this one!

Needed to be altered quite a bit. Use an extra 1/4 cup of water, cover and let sit for 30 minutes. spread out on 9x13 pan, brush with basil and olive oil and bake for 10 minutes in a 450 degree oven. then take out, add sauce and toppings, and put back in for 5-10 minutes.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was wonderful.  The only change I made was to use 1 cup of Whole Wheat Bread Flour and 1 cup All-purpose flour.  I mixed everything in the stand mixer and baked the crust for about 10 minutes at around 400 degrees before I added the sauce and toppings.  I will make the many more times. Thanks for sharing.

very fast and easy for last-minute dinner. I just thew it all into my mixer and it was perfect. Even without resting the dough was still light. The only thing I added was some garlic powder but I throw that into almost everything I make (I'm a Total Garlic Fanatic)  To those saying there are steps missing and such, that's the point of this recipe. To by pass all of the extra steps and cut down the time it takes to get it from the bowl to your mouth. Chill out a little and just go for the recipe word for word - you won't regret it!

As another reviewer noted, this is meant to be a QUICK solution for homemade crust (Like when it is 5:00 pm and your kids remind you that you promised to make pizza for dinner!).   We really liked this crust.  I'd doubled the batch for two pizzas and ended up with pretty thick crust - I would suggest rolling very thin for a more traditional crust.  Great recipe and definitely a keeper!

Thank you for this great, easy and quick recipe. I am a working mom of 3 children and a wife of a shift worker. With all of the after school activities and the busyness of my household, this Recipe has proven to be the perfect chioce for dinner during the work week. When the cheese goes on sale, I stock up! I shread it using my food processor and  package it in sandwhich bags (perfect amount for 1 pizza) and freeze it. When time is ticking for dinner, I make the dough, snatch a bag of cheese from the freezer, put my toppings on and away we go! It's as easy at (pizza) pie! My eldest son has now started making his own pizza dough and is saving me even more time! Thanks again!!

Having read several reviews, I decided to follow the recipe exactly as written, especially since I was in a hurry.  I did use rapid rise yeast, since that was all I had.  I should have started with 2 1/2 cups of flour. The amount needed for a recipe does vary due to humidity.  Nevertheless, I used the full 3 cups, and the dough was quite dry.  I kneaded it until it was manageable, and then put the dough ball in the pan, flattened it out, and used a rolling pin to get it started.  It was quite stiff, but I managed to work it to the edges and up the sides of the pan. This brings me to a feature about this recipe that I really like.  When working with most yeast doughs, you end up with a lot of thickness around the edge of the pan, but with this dough, it stays put and does not continue to rise after you press it into place.  You don't end up with a thick ridge around the outside.   The directions are a little lacking, so I'm tempted to give this only 4 stars.  The end product is quite good, but not great.  Yesterday afternoon, though, when I was stressed out and in a hurry, this recipe came to my rescue.  Pizza dough this good, this fast, is worth 5 stars to me.

Good starter dough. A little difficult to roll out, but I forgot to put the oil in, so that could have affected it?

I have never made pizza dough that was this quick and easy before! I literally had dough in under 5 minutes. No kneading, no waiting for dough to rise. I tossed everything in my stand mixer using the dough hook and a few minutes later I had great pizza dough. Thank you for sharing this!

I have used the original recipe (with olive oil) many times and it is perfect but our diets changed so we do not add the oil now and it still turns out perfectly. Thank you for the great recipe Gudny!

great dough!  probably the first time ever that every one ate up all of the crusty outer pieces first!  I proofed the yeast with the warm water and a couple pinches of sugar before adding - and I did let it rise a bit on top of the stove while the oven was warming.

Loved this recipe!  It rolled out perfectly on my baking stone and was just the right thickness.  Topped with sauce, parmesian cheese, dried onions, mozzerella, and cheddar cheese.  Delicious!  My kids loved it and even took it in their lunch box the next day.  Will definately make again!

I had lots of time so I let the yeast sit in the warm water for an hour and then let the dough rise for an hour. Tastes FANTASTIC! Used olive oil instead of veg oil. Next time will bake at bottom of oven. Top of pizza browned before bottom.

I've made the recipe exactly as submitted and also dissolved the yeast in the water/sugar mixture first before adding to the flour.  Both are great but we prefer to dissolve the yeast first (just gives a less "yeasty" flavor). I'd recommend this recipe to anyone looking to make their own pizza dough.

Yummy! I added yeast to water instead of dry ingredients and let sit a couple minutes then added to dry ingredients along with oil.  I also let the dough rise a bit just because I had a fussy baby to tend to for about 20 minutes.  Will use again soon.

warm your water.  Then add yeast and mix, then add oil.  Dump into remaining dry ingredients.  Mix, roll out, and put in pan.  Partially precook dough then add toppings and continue. Perfect everytime!!

This is a great recipe.  The point is that it's FAST and you don't need to let it rise.  I found it to be easy and have good flavor.  It did add a random amount of garlic powder to the dough but that was my only adjustment.  It made a nice thick bready crust, which is how my family likes pizza.  It rises in the oven and we'll be using this recipe frequently!

This is one of the simplest recipes for pizza dough and it comes out the best.  It's easy to mix up by hand and rolls out very thin, just the way we like it.  Add other spices for a more customized taste.

I thought this recipe was fantastic! My family loved it, said it was the best I've made. I did allow a little more time for it to raise, and I added a few spices to the dough. But it was so easy and delicious I will be using it again!

Easy dough recipe made as is. I use a rolling pin and roll out the dough between two pieces of wax paper. Place the dough on a greased cookie sheet. I use the Easy Pizza Sauce III recipe and top with cheese and either pepperoni or sausage.

Excellent! I was looking for a super quick dough and thought I needed to adjust my expectations accordingly. But YUM! I added garlic, rosemary and basil to the dough, but otherwise, changed nothing. Perfect as is, and sooo easy!

This recipe was just okay.  I made it exactly as stated and it was too thick and doughy - I wasn't able to get it to cook it all the way through without it being too tough because the dough was too thick.  Tastewise, it was good enough.

This recipe was great! I use to use a recipe that called for no yeast in the pizza dough, however that one seemed to turn out doughy. Other recipes that I found wanted you to let the dough rise for an hour or so, and our family just can't seem to wait that long. This recipe was perfect! The only thing I did was let it rise for 30 minutes. It was a very tasty crust, and one that we will use everytime we make home made pizza!

Yummy yummy!  I made the crust PER RECIPE but added in ground flax seed and some wheat germ and it was DELICIOUS!  This is a fast, simple recipe when you're wanting homemade pizza!  My 3 kiddos and hubby really like the crust!  I was able to get 2 pizzas out of it which made the crust thin, but that is okay since we love thin crust!  Will be making this again!

This is just what I needed, with only a little time to prepare & no waiting for the dough to rise!!  The bottom was a bit flimsy even after I pre-cooked the base before putting on the toppings.  I always have this problem though, maybe I need to cook it longer.  Thanks for the great, easy recipe!!

This was easy to make and you can add so much other ingrediace to this dough. I had my 3 yr old son make his own pizza. it can be made just out of a bread. Very quick and easy. A must try.

I think this recipe is amazing!  I realized all to late that I need a bread maker for the recipe I was going to use and needed to come up with an alternative fast.  I was a little leary, but it turned out great and everyone loved it.  I added some garlic and italian seasoning to the dough to make it have more of a kick.  I have passed this recipe on to many other moms I know who may need to come up with a quick pizza.

This recipe is great AS IS!  The whole point of this recipe is to be able to make it in a pinch, without having to wait for dough to rise.  Just combine dry ingredients, add wet ingredients, mix and press into a pizza pan.  Takes less than 10 minutes!  I wouldn't say that the dough compares to other recipes where you put in a lot more time, but for it's purpose it's just perfect!

Its a basic dough recipe. BASIC. Complaining or adding "herbs" to make it better is like complaining about a basic doughnut recipe with "the only thing I changed to make it better was jelly"... Go to a jelly doughnut recipe then.....   The technique and fundamentals is there.. 5 stars

This was bad. WHat is the point of adding yeast if the dough is not going to rise? It was dense, bready, cracker-like. why is this recipe getting good reviews?

To all those who feel it is needed to change a recipe that someone has spent the time to add it here, you should just put your own recipe in. A few hints are good, but changing it completely and telling the author it is not right, is not acceptable. If you do not like it, leave it at that.  I have used this recipe for what it is, SIMPLE & QUICK.

Great flavor and ridiculously easy. And I mean RIDICULOUSLY. I added garlic powder and basil; I also had to add some extra flour to help in binding the dough. I let the dough rise only as long as it took to preheat the oven. Made steam holes in a fork and baked the crust alone for about five minutes before topping. Note: the recipe says it yields one pizza. For those of you who like a more thin, cracker-like crust, I would suggest splitting one serving of dough into two pizzas. I used one batch per pizza and it came out a little too bread-like for me.

This recipe was a life saver with a few alterations. I have been a camp cook and I was not thrilled with the pre-made pizza dough that we purchased for our supplier. So we thought we could save some money make it from scratch and make it good. This recipe did that. The recipe was easy and quick. I just made the adjustment of adding about 25%-33% more water, twice the salt and let the dough rise for about 20 minutes. Super easy to work with at that point. Especially when making 12 full sheet pan size pizzas.

This was AMAZING and amazingly EASY!!! My family, including my 4 kids (2-7) absolutely loved the pizza and the dough.  I did add Italian seasoning and garlic to the dry ingredients. Thank you THANK you for this wonderful and easy recipe.  With 4 kids, we hardly have time to cook, much less cook far enough in advanced to let pizza dough rise, and we can't usually afford enough pizza for all of us (that tastes any good at least).  We will be making this for just about every pizza night (unless we HAVE to get carry-out).  Definitely 5 stars for anyone wanting something super fast and super super easy.

One of my son’s favorite things I make.  I agree with others that you need to add basil, garlic powder and oregano to the dough and use olive oil.   I tried using an “Italian Seasoning” once instead of the spices separately; the seasoning mix had rosemary which overpowered everything.  It is really easy to make and I use the KitchenAid with the dough attachment to mix it all together.  Let rise for at least 30 minutes and you have a wonderful crust!  We like to add bacon bits to our pizza, I have found that you should put them on right after the sauce then the cheese…incredible flavor!

I love this pizza dough.  I would suggest that people mix the yeast and water for a few minutes before the other ingredients.  I have just mixed it all in a couple of times and found that the yeast takes much longer to dissolve that way.  I also change this up sometimes and add up to 1/2 whole wheat flour...with great success.  This recipe is YUMMY!

I love this recipe the only thing I would do is use bread flour instead of all purpose flour and spread some italian medley Mrs. Dash seasonsing blend salt-free. I suggest this because it makes you want to eat the crust as well. its an extra kick.

I had to bake it longer then the recommended time and it was still doughy. When I let the dough sit out so the yeast could rise, then it baked nicely.

This recipe was great.  My breadmaker recently packed it in so I was looking for an easy pizza dough recipe.  I used my dough hook on my food processer to mix the dough and then after a quick knead I covered and let the dough rise in a warm draft free place for 1 hour.  As my family likes thin crusted pizza I split the dough after rising and pressed it into two 12 inch pizza pans.  As the crusts were thinner I baked them for 14 minutes.  They turned out fantastic.

Super easy and crust turned out great.  This isn't take out pizza crust, but it matches and beats the boxed versions of make at home pizza dough from the grocery store.

For a last minute dough, I though it worked very nicely.  I'd use it again.

I have been using this recipe for several months now substituting gluten-free flour to make gluten free pizza for my husband, and he always raves about it.  I just recently made it non-gluten free for myself, and it is amazing!  My brother-in-law is also gluten-intolerant and said that this pizza is better than any gluten-free pizza he's had at a restaurant.  I've made several batches of this dough (both gluten free and regular) and frozen them for later use.  I pull them out and thaw them, and they're just as good as if they were freshly made.  If I'm not in a hurry, then to make it even easier I just dump everything in my bread machine and hit the dough setting.  Quick, easy, delicious dinner!  I doubt I'll ever go out for pizza again!

Great! I used 1 cup whole wheat flour, and olive oil.  I had some time, so let it rise for about an hour. I also baked it by itself for a few minutes.  Chewy, firm, perfect to hold a high pile of toppings. Thanks for sharing!

I have made this dough around 10 times now.    I recommend letting the dough rise about an hour for best results.

Husband loved it!! (NOTE: According to Fleischmann's Yeast- when using Active Dry Yeast- dissolve yeast in warm water before using. Add dissolved yeast to other ingredients. Don't use in recipes calling for Rapid Rise yeast. Rapid won't dissolve properly & water is too hot). Dissolving method made difference on high or low crust. Loved dough prepared both ways.  Tip: If you place pizza dough & on bottom of large mixing bowl & then transfer to pizza pan, makes it alot easier.

Perfect Recipe for a quick and easy dough.  I made it even MORE easy.. Took all the ingredients, put them in my breadmaker on "Dough" setting let it mix it up and turned the maker off, let it raise about 15 mins while I cut up toppings and presto.. it was PERFECT.  I used to work at a pizza shop.. this is easy to work with dough.  It tastes yummy too!  Added a tablespoon of Honey and some Garlic for flavor, otherwise the base recipe is fine as is.

I don't quite understand this pizza dough. It tastes Ok. Very simple to make. Comparable to any fast food pizza joint. But I don't understand why there is yeast in this dough. Maybe I didn't do something right?

This was AWESOME. So easy and it tasted so fresh and delicious. I don't think I'll ever buy another frozen pizza. I kneeded the dough for about 20 min. but only cuz I was stressed (had a bad interview and I didn't get the job so I wanted to eat my failure away). Then I made my own sauce out of tomato sauce that I seasoned and then I diced some tomatoes to make the sauce chunky. Topped with mozzarella, pepperoni and some pineapples and VIOLA! = )**

Call me crazy, but this is now my 'go to' recipe for pizza crust! I have made a few different crust recipes- some that have many steps and take a LOT of time. I still think this one is better. My whole family loves it and it doesn't get any easier than mixing it up and pressing it in the pan! The only change I make is using honey instead of sugar. Turns out great. We've tried this in a regular pizza pan as well as a casserole dish (for a deep dish) and LOVE it both ways! You won't be sorry you tried this recipe! Especially if you have hungry kids who want a homemade pizza in the next 30 minutes. :-)

I added some garlic powder and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, but otherwise followed the directions exactly.  I agree with those who say you have to roll this pretty thin or you get a very bread-like crust.  Good, quick, easy.  Will make again.

Though I did not follow this recipe exactly (therefore it is not actually This recipe). I did use all the ingredients, but I let the yeast set in the water until it started to bubble (about 10 or so minutes). Mixed the wet ingredients. Mixed herbs into the flour. Then poured wet into dry. I kneaded it. Then transferred into an olive oiled boil, covered, let rise for about 30 minutes. Baked for about 5 minutes on its own, then put the toppings on. It really was an incredible crust !

The perfect pizza crust. The closest I`ve found to the ones I had in Italy. I stretch it really thin and pre bake it for 5 mins.

Perhaps I am doing something wrong, but my dough turned out flat not puffy or bread like at all. My question is, what is the point of adding the yeast if no rise time is needed?

I had some hope that this recipe would at least resemble a pizza crust in texture. Although the flavor was ok, the texture was all wrong. Dense, thick, not appetizing at all. I would rather use a can of bisquits for a quick crust than this recipe. Take the time to make a rising dough in my opinion.

This is a super easy and delicious recipe. The best part is no rising is needed, and you'd never know the difference. I use my stand mixer to knead it and it turns out perfect. If you use a regular size round pizza pan, it is pretty thick- I like to use a bigger rectangular sheet.

Wow, I basically love the convenience of this recipe. I'm vegan, too, so I'm really glad that I can actually make my own pizza now! I'm really grateful for the versatility of this pizza dough, too. Most of the time I make actual pizza, by adding tomato sauce and veggies and spices, but sometimes I add a little melted butter, sugar, and cinnamon as a treat. ;-)

Made this last night, proofed the yeast as that's what I normally do.  Attempted to let it sit, but was too impatient and hungry.  I should have pre-baked the crust, as the top of the crust under the toppings was still doughy, which I can't stand.  It tasted good, but I added italian spices to the dough.  Was very nice and crispy, but was just too thick for my liking, maybe my pan wasn't big enough but I could probably get 2 crusts out of one recipe if I rolled it out thin enough.

This is wonderful! I can't believe it was so quick and tasted so good! I used about half all purpose and half whole wheat, olive oil, and I added herbs. Mine had the opportunity to rise as we went to the store to fetch an ingredient, but I can imagine it would have tasted about the same. Thank you!

I rated this high for how easy it was to make and how great it turned out.I actually like how basic and simple it is. I have 4 small kids and we were able to divide the dough into 4 small size and one med. size(for my husband and I). They had so much fun making there own pizza's. This recipe is a keeper!

This was amazingly simple and delicious.  The crust was just the right thickness, and had a wonderful, chewy texture.  We made breadsticks with it, and I made a stuffed crust pizza with it using mozzarella cheese sticks.  It was so fast and easy to use, I will be using this over and over!!!!!

I think closer to four cups of flour is needed than three, but it can be individually judged. Anyway, a quick and easy recipe, and it works very well.

Make it just the way it says, with the possible addition of spices along with the flour. It's more of a quickbread tasting dough than normal, but EXCELLENT! And ours wasn't thin and crispy at all. Do ingredients in the order called for and possibly leave sitting for a bit before rolling out, which we did.

This recipe is INCREDIBLE.  I am so happy to have found it!  It was just what I was looking for tonight - quick homemade crust so I didn't have to order out. ;-)  I made a few changes per my taste..  which was to add dried rosemary, dried basil, garlic powder, ancho chile powder, and black pepper.  I also used 1/2 all purpose flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour.  I sprayed a pizza pan with olive oil spray, and then rolled out the dough on it.. then brushed with an olive oil/crushed garlic mixture.. and baked it for 10 minutes.  Brought it out, brushed again with the oil/garlic - and then topped with marinara sauce and all the other stuff I wanted. :-)  Baked for 20 minutes.. PERFECTION!  I love a thin and crispy crust, so if you don't - you may want to look at a different recipe. :-)  I, for one, am permanently adding this to my recipe binder.. thank you so much for sharing your recipe. :-)

This is our new favorite pizza dough!  It's very close to restaurant style.  Our crust has actually come out thick and browned nicely with a little olive oil drizzled on it.  I added about 3 TBSP of sugar, since we like to taste the sweetness.

i have used this recipe about 20 times so far. it always turns out good. I do let the dough rest and rise about a half hour or longer --i mix it up and cover it and get other things done in the house and come back and finish it and pop it in the oven its so easy. i add a little extra salt and italian spices to the dough but thats just a personal preference. The recipe good as it is written too.

I am not certain if I mismeasured somewhere along the line but my dough was very sticky. Even after adding a lot more flour, it still seemed very sticky. I went with it anyway and it actually baked up pretty crispy. I baked my pizza on a pizza stone first and then finished it in a 400 degree oven on the middle oven rack. Even though it ended up good, I don't think I'll make this one again. I think I'm accustomed to the dough that needs to rise before baking. Thanks!

Really easy to make, spread it out thin and rolled cheese into the crust to make "stuffed crust". Was excellent! Thanks for such an easy recipe.

EDIT: I now make this slightly differently. I proof the yeast first, and then let the dough rise for a half hour. I also add about a tsp of garlic powder and a tsp of italian seasoning. I split it in half and use a rolling pin and flour to get the perfect thin crust. I then bake for only 15 minutes. I also use one of those trays with the holes in it. Amazing results! I know this isn't the original recipe, and the original recipe was good but if you've got an extra half hour, then you can get great results. By the way, the other half I don't use, I put in the freezer. Comes out perfectly.

Very easy.  Kind of bread-y, but incredibly simple and the best pizza dough recipe I've found that doesn't need a rise.  I used all ww flour and mixed it with the dough hook attachment on my mixer.  Wonderful!

This is a great simple recipe for those who don't have much time to make it a 'deluxe' crust. I alternate using this recipe along with 2 others when I make my bread/doughs. I don't know if I've quite found my personal favourite recipe for pizza dough yet, this may be close, though I haven't used this recipe in a while. I know I let this one sit overnight once and it was PERFECT after I baked it, just like in a restaurant. I haven't been able to replicate it since though for some reason...

You know what? I have tried endlessly to find a pizza crust that had the right consistency for pizza. This one had it. I did not let it rise, I did not cut the flour, in fact the only things I did were to add the italian seasoning and garlic salt to the crust  ( which I would have put on as toppings anyhow) and this was the BEST PIZZA I HAVE MADE AT HOME. Leave the recipe the way it is, and only adjust the flavour to taste. Leave perfection as is.

This is an easy pizza dough recipe. I recommend using a large pizza pan (14#) and really spreading out the dough to prevent the crust from being too thick. The 2nd time I made it I also spread olive oil on the crust which made it delicious!!

Very good. Added some garlic powder, didnt have basil by itself so i added some rosemary and thyme (dried not powdered), was told its the best ive ever made.(I also let the yeast double before adding it to the other ingredients cause i thought it would be gross if it didnt have time to activate) Thanks for the simple recipe-base.

So far I've not had great success with pizza dough -- UNTIL NOW!!!  This recipe was great.  I've made it twice now, to prove that it wasn't just blind luck.  And to top it off, we used it on the grill!  It has great texture and flavor.  Once I added a little garlic powder and dried Italian seasonings to give it a little twist.  Another time I topped it with a little bbq sauce grilled chicken and a light sprinkling of cheddar cheese.  This will forever replace any other pizza crust for me.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! I have made this dough numerous times and have always been happy. Only thing I do that is not mentioned in the original recipe is - I let my dough rise. Very easy recipe to alter with additional herbs and spices for outstanding home made pizza!

I followed the directions of LADYMHARRIS. I also added a tsp of italian seasonings. I made the mistake of not putting it in the oven a couple of minutes before putting on the ingredients so they dough came out a little too soft to me. My family loved it though. Next time I will put it in the over for a few minutes first so it gets crispy.

I love this.  I use 2 cups wheat flour and olive oil instead of vegetable.  I also put it in my breadmaker to mix the dough.  It's so easy and beats frozen pizza any day!

Easy easy.  Used olive oil, 2 tsp garlic salt, mixed with dough hook in the Kitchenaid for 8 min. and covered and let rise while I did the dishes and the oven preheated.
It's not super great but not bad either, esp. for a night when you have no other ingredients and no dinner plan! :)

I'm being generous giving this 3 stars. It's easy to prepare and would do in a pinch, but didn't taste good, and was very heavy. A decent pizza crust needs to rest and rise. Won't make again.

I'm 100% Italian, and I say that this dough is not the real thing but it is close to it. The pizza dough has to be always plain, you get the "big bang" from the toppings, so please don't listen to those that said differently! I made it with my bread machine because I didn't have time, when the dough cycle was done I split it in half and I made two regular pizzas! It was a thing crust but this is the way we like it. It was good the day after too!!

My 11 year old son made his first pizza tonight & used this recipe for his crust.  He did it all by himself, with me just supervising.  It was AWESOME! We were all so proud of him & it was delicious, too.  We didn't even have to fake it.

Yummy pizza with little kneading (just to combine ingredients) and NO waiting?? With two impatient boys under 5, this is a winner for us! We subbed 1c with wheat flour and turned out yummy!

This is such an easy recipe and it tastes so good.  Let it rise on your pizza pan before baking and you'll have a nice thick crust.

very good when I took the suggestions to let it rise.  It needs more flavor so I will add seasonings next time

This was my 1st time making pizza crust and it was not good at all.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out more like a biscuit.

THE BEST!  Hubby and I lived in Sicily for a couple of years, so when we decided to make our own pizza, we wanted it to be close to what we had in Italy.  I followed some of the suggestions and dissolved the yeast and sugar in warm water.  I also added seasonings to the flour mixture.  With a little practice with the baking, this crust has turned out GREAT!  We preheat the oven on a high temp and then bake it on the lowest rack with the bottom burners on only.  This ensures that the crust gets cooked thoroughly.  AWESOME!

I had a hard time rating this recipe.  When I first tried it (followed the recipe to a "t") it came out pretty badly.  Very heavy and dense.  However, once I made some changes based on other reviews (added some basil, let it rise 30+ minutes) it turned out amazing. I have used this revised recipe at least 20 times and every time it turns out great.  I have had no end of compliments!

This was very good crust!  I was pleased with how easy it was to handle.  I let it rise about a half hour in an oiled bowl.  I prebaked it about 5-7 minutes.  I made it in a 15x10x1 jelly roll pan.

I made this dough with great results.  Started with the reviewer recommended 2 1/2 cups flour, the recipe listed amount of sugar/salt/yeast, and the reviewer recommended olive oil, plus a few personal herbs and spices.  I didn't have a measuring cup around so I just used a mug.  It was obviously more than 1 cup so in the end more flour was needed.  Kneaded the dough for about 10 minutes adding more flour when neccessary.  The dough rose a little while waiting for the toppings to be prepared.  Rolled out the dough, set it over sprinkled cornmeal, let it rise a little more as more toppings were prepared, and baked it for 6-8 minutes to pre-cook the surface before adding all the toppings.  (It was a vegetarian pizza so all the topppings produced a good amount of moisture during cooking.)  Baked it at 400 instead of 375 because the crust was already precooked, didn't require a lower heat/more time to cook through.  Took about 20 minutes to nicely brown the crust and cook all the toppings.

5 stars for both ease and taste. Very simple and quick to use. I substituted honey in for the sugar and ended up needing just a little more flour. I put all the ingredients into my kitchen aid mixer and let it do all the work. So simple! It was also very easy to work with. I was surprised at how well it turned out considering you didn't need to let it rise. I posted pictures of what our pizza's looked like (we made them on a pizza stone).

I have tried many pizza dough recipes and this one has quickly become a favorite! It is so easy! I took the advice of another reviewer and added a teaspoon of dried basil and a teaspoon of garlic. I also only used 2 1/2 cups of flour and then after I mixed everything together I let the dough sit for 30 minutes before baking. First I put only the crust in the oven for 6 minutes and then I took it out and put the sauce and topping on and then it went back in the oven for 14 minutes. PERFECT! All my kids loved it!!!

My family loved this crust!  I didn't let it rise or knead it at all and it was light and tender.  I did add a little garlic, but I put garlic is almost anything!  Thanks for this simple recipe!

I used whole wheat flour instead and also used Olive Oil.  It came out alright, I think it might have been the flour I used next time I will try a combination of flours, dissolving the yeast in the warm water and letting the dough rise a bit.  It tasted alright it just didn't get crispy enough.

Great in Calzones but i have not tried pizza. I took some to school and they were great for lunch. My mom loved them alot and i have made them 3 times in the course of 2 weeks. It is great with oregano on top and with cheddar and parmesan cheese.

Note the two steps.  Yes, it's pretty much that easy and makes a great pizza crust.  My first attempt yielded a pretty thin crust so I increased the ingredients by 25% and got a thickness that I liked better.  My daughter is vegan so I use this to make vegan pizza, which turns out great.  So good that I'm happy to eat it and I'm not vegan.

Awesome!!! Added some garlic, oregano and basil, then let the dough sit for 30-35 min in a warm place and totally covered with a blanket.
I like my pizza to be very thin and crusty and this recipe worked perfectly, awesome!!!!!!!

The crust is definately on the thick side... but delicious.  May be a little bit too thick for some pizza lovers.  Myself and my very picky 3 year old really enjoyed it.  I put it in a 9x13" casserole dish - maybe could have put it on a cookie sheet to spread it out a little more. I will definately make this one again.

This is a great recipe.  I am not good with anything having to do with yeast and this worked out perfect.  The only thing I changed, per my Dad, is that I used quick rising yeast instead of active yeast.  Worked great.  My whole family loved it and I will be making it again!  Thanks!

This recipe is awesome! I was in a pinch when several of my neighbours kids dropped over to play.  I followed some of the advice and used olive oil (always a better choice I think) and I let it rise for 30 minutes.  The kids had a blast pounding and shaping it.  It rose beautifully and was light and puffy pizza dough.  I kept the seasonings down due to the kids but would definitely make it again! A real time saver!

Hmmm...mixed feelings.   It was extremely easy, not sticky, and very elastic, making it ideal for handling.  However, it had a hint of biscuity-spongy texture that I didn't particularly like.

This came out perfect!! I was VERY skeptical but so pleased. I followed the exact order of the recipe, just substituted olive oil for the veg. oil and added oregano. I made a taco pizza in a large glass casserole dish. Greased the dish with olive oil and sprinkled with corn meal. I left mine in until the crust was a little browned and the bottom was crunchy too. Will use again and again. This would be a good recipe for deep dish pizza as well! Thanks.

This was the best homemade pizza crust I've ever made.  I added garlic and seasoning to the crust.  Usually after I've added all of the toppings the crust doesn't get done.  Not this one!
It was great.

This was better than any delivery pizza. I added oregano and used olive oil the second time I made it, but the original recipe was excellent. It was so easy I will never order from a franchise again.

I did not like this dough at all.  It was dry and hard.  I will not make it again.  It was easy to make, but I'd rather have a dough that needs to rise a little.  I couldn't even cut this pizza.

This was easy but not a great consistency. More like a dinner roll than pizza dough. May try it for quick dinner rolls instead of pizza dough.

I found this dough very dry and plain. Although it was very quick and simple to make, there just was not enough flavor.

I followed the recommendations posted by "KIM", and I thought the dough came out great. I would make it again, it was very easy and tasty. Thanks to the poster of this recipe, and thanks Kim for your suggestions.

A very simple and easy dough recipe that turned out quite nice.  I used all-purpose flour throughout because that's all I have on hand, but it still turned out just the way I hoped it would.  I'm keeping this recipe for sure.

I was so glad to find this!  I had ingredients for pizza but didn't have much time, but didn't want to give in & call Pizza Hut.  Quick & turned out great.  I did add a little extra water, & a touch more water when I substituted 1/2 the AP flour w/ whole-wheat flour.  I put in oven on warm for 10 min. before topping, then pressed down next to edge to make a rim - nice!  Thank you!!

Didn't enjoy this at all, hard dough to work with and had a very doughy taste.  What you make up in the time you save to let the dough rise, you lose in flavour.

I thought this dough was fabulous!  It was very simple and came out beautifully golden and crunchy.  I used it for calzones and it was just delicious.  I would highly recommend it for quick dinners.  No rise crust?  What more could you ask for?! :)

Prep wasn't bad, came together quickly and took only a few minutes.

Came out a bit dry and extremely chewy, took 25 minutes to brown a little and that made it a bit overcooked.  Perhaps a lower temperature would have resolved this.

Flavor was, well, the recipe is water and flour, you aren't going to get much flavor there :)

It worked in a pinch, but I won't make it again.

I found this recipe to be a bit dry and heavy. I put everything in my bread machine and I had to add more water and oil. I like a lighter crust. My kids loved it so for them its a keeper. Thanks for the recipe.

This was a great pizza dough! I too used olive oil, but skipped the extra spices, we are purists. I used half and froze half, and I do recommend mixing with your hand to blend it well. I also used a hand roller right in the dish to get a nice even crust and prebaked it. I will use this again!

Much better than store-bought crusts! Followed suggestions and used olive oil and herbs. Prefer a thinner crust, so I only use 1/2 recipe for one yummy pizza. Will try freezing other half...it's so fast, that my boyfriend has a hard time believing it's made from scratch. Next step: get HIM to make it . Not much can go wrong, it's that easy! Dough handles nicely too.

This was my first attempt at making pizza dough from scratch.  I dissolved the yeast along with the sugar and let the dough rise for 30 minutes.  I could have made 2 crusts with the dough I had.  Great recipe!

This recipe is excellent. I as others substitute olive oil and use 1 cup of cake and pastry flour. I start with 2 cups of flour and work in an extra half cup. Adding the garlic and basil and italian seasoning adds a very nice flavor. If desired a 1/4 cup of fresh shredded parmesan is tasty also. I will probably never need another pizza dough recipe!

this is a real quick easy recipie, and it came out great the first time i made it. although many here suggest to let it rise for a little while first, it isn't needed. i put mine right on the pan and i still had a nice thick crust to work with.

I love this recipe!! This was the first time that I have tried to make my own pizza dough and it turned out great. I followed the suggestions of some of the other reviewers and used olive oil instead of veg oil, added italian spices and used only 3/4 of a package of yeast. I also let the dough rise for 10-15 minutes. This recipe is a definite keeper!!

This recipe was great! It was really easy to make, big bonus! I used all 3 cups of flour and it turned out wonderful. Also used olive oil  and added a little garlic powder and parsley to the dough. I let it rise for about 35 minutes (Had some extra time) and that made it not so heavy, as compared to not letting it rise. My husband raved about the pizza! It would also make great rolls/bread. Thanks for the recipe!

Great dough!  We've had to tweak it a bit to get the consistancy we like - a bit less flour, 1/2 the yeast, etc.  But all in all, this is GREAT stuff!  I'll never buy a delivery pizza again.  :)  Thanks

WONDERFUL!! My answer to pizza dough recipes! It was sooo easy, and the dough tasted wonderful when it was done, I couldn't tell if I loved the dough or toppings on the pizza more! :-)

Great recipe! My kids were able to make it with ease and perfection w/breadmaker. Loved it so much that we used the recipe for dinner rolls! Welcome change from the typically long process of making dinner rolls. This recipe is definately a keeper!

This is a very quick and easy recipe!! I placed the ingredients in my bread machine and ran the dough cycle, while I chopped my pizza toppings. I didn't have a problem with the 3 cups of flour. I started with 2 cups flour but did add the last cup. The only thing I changed was I used olive oil instead of plain veggie oil. The recipe was almost enough to fill a standard size cookie sheet (thin crust).
Thanks for a great recipe...it's a keeper!!

Yum! I don't like the taste of store-bought pizza dough, so I thought I'd give this recipe a try since it looked quick and easy... it was both AND tasty! Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was so good! Substitutions included- replacing coconut sugar for white sugar, I put the warm water and yeast in a separate cup while I prepared the other ingredients, and remember to poke little holes in the crust so that no bubbles form. Also, I cooked in oven for 10mins before adding any sauce or toppings so that it wasn't mushy. Then, I added the toppings and cooked for the remaining time.

This is touted as a no-rise dough, but when I made the first pizza (I doubled the recipe) without any rising, the dough didn't taste quite right. The second one, which had risen for around 40 minutes, was superb. So if you don't follow the instructions and let it rise, you'll have a great crust.

Never, it took almost 5 cups of flour.  I use instant yeast where you don't need warm water however I still used warm water.  To me I don't like trying recipes  that don't work it's a waste of money.  Yes it's easy, but putting it on the bottom rack might help the brown the pie on the bottom. Or try a higher temp.  I tried it because there were so many votes.  I was extremely disappointed.

I was using Fleishmanns Pizza Yeast because I liked not having rise time. I was out of the yeast packet so I looked up a no rise pizza dough recipe. It was exactly what I was looking for! This will be my go to pizza recipe! I even made bread sticks from the dough!

Our family loves this recipe and we have never had any of the issues that I've read in the comments. I agree with the 1st comment I read that this is meant to be easy and quick. Due to so many unsatisfied cooks I watched the video and saw a couple things. 1. The recipe says dry active yeast (she says that in the video) however dry active is little pellets and in the video she uses pizza dough yeast, which is ground up dry active yeast. This makes it so you don't have to "activate" the yeast pellets and wait for rising. 2. From making my own bread I've learned to mix the dry ingredients 1st, mix the water and oil in a separate container then mix them together. Honestly I don't know if this makes a difference for this recipe it is just one of the differences I saw I did.

I was in a pinch with only an hour to make dinner for the family, and had everything for pizza but the crust - but didn't want to run out and spend money on pre-made ones. This recipe hit the mark perfectly - it was quick, easy, and tasty as is, and even tastier  when I added Parmesan and garlic butter to the crust after baking (like flavored crust at hungry howies!) Definitely a keeper. My only suggestion is to roll it as thin as possible - that way you get a nice crispy crust that is perfectly cooked through while following the recipes directions. I tried upping the oven temp, as most pizza recipes call for the hottest oven possible, and saw the same results at 375 and 400. Thanks again for this great recipe!

This recipe is perfect for a quick dough or if you want to let it rise for about an hour. I do recommend dissolving the yeast , salt and sugar in a warm cup of water. The many other reviewers have done.

I have tried pizza dough so many times and it never comes out quite right.  This recipe came out perfect if a little plain for my personal taste.  But the crust and texture baked perfectly on my stone bake ware.
A few things I have figured out with pizza dough:
1. ALWAYS use bread flour to get the proper texture, other wise the dough will taste more like a biscuit.
2.  Handle the dough as little as possible.  This kind of applies to most doughs that need to be rolled out.  Just drop the sticky dough right onto a very floured counter top, then sift more flour on top.  I used a rolling pin to roll, then flip and flour, then roll, then flip, then flour.  The trick is using lots of flour.
4. Add some garlic to the dough, and put some melted butter on the crust.

This baked perfectly in about 18 minutes.  :)

This is a great EASY and fast recipe. Great for when you are in a time crunch but don't want to eat fast/processed food.  Sometimes I mix rosemary into the dough.
Sometimes I will roll out the dough, plop on some meat (like sandwich ham) and cheese and fold over the sides of the dough--kind of like a calzone. Turns out great... kids love it!! Definitely on a 'fav' list. Thanks.

Came together wonderfully! Quick, easy and bakes up great. The dough was workable enough for me to stuff the crust with cheese! Loaded it up with veggies and pineapple and the base held up perfectly no sogginess! Definitely a go to for us on pizza night from now on!

Great recipe on my 4th. I used what I had in my pantry, bread flour and 2-1/2 tsp. of active yeast from a jar. I had to use extra water when working with the dough. I have used at one time either olive oil or vegetable oil, both work. I layered the pizza dough with fried caramelized sweet onions, pizza cheese and feta cheese. Baked at 375 degrees 20-25 minutes. I love the thin crispy crust

I HAVE BEEN MAKING THIS RECIPE FOR YEAR i MAKE CALZONES WITH ON FOR ALMOST EVERY FAMILY EVENT IT WORKS  GREAT , FOR ALL YOU PEOPLE WHO GIVE THIS A BAD REVUE LEARN HOW TO MAKE DOUGH. FLOUR HAS DIFFERENT MOISTURE CONTENT BASED ON HOW ITS STORED AND TIME OF YEAR AND OTHER FACTORS SO YOU CAN ADJUST THE WATER OR ADJUST THE FLOUR THAT IS HOW PROFESSIONAL BREAD MAKERS MAKE BREAD. REMEMBER THIS IS PIZZA CRUST YOU CAN GO NUT ADD WHAT EVER YOU WANT TO IT. SOMETIME I MAKE IT THE DAY BEFORE AND LET IT RISE OVER NIGHT IN THE REFRIGERATOR IT TASTES EVEN BETTER

I like this recipe a lot but a couple things to note . Don't roll the dough to thin if you like chewy crust otherwise it becomes super crispy. Also cook the pizza at 375 degrees or the dough starts to dry-out. And make sure to grease the pizza pan or use a nonstick cooking spray or the pizza is hard to get loose from the pan. On the positive side you don't have to refrigerate this dough over night. It's ready to use as soon as you make it. Also my kids used a batch of this dough to make pretzels like you can get at the mall. They rolled the dough into long ropes fairy thick, folded them into pretzel shapes baked them at 375 and brushed  salted butter on the when they came out . They turned out great. Overall I really like this pizza dough recipe. Plus the fact it had duel applications. I will make this my stand by need it quick pizza dough recipe. Thank for sharing it.

This recipe is great as is! To add flavor I have used pampered chefs garlic infused canola oil or rosemary infused canola oil instead of vegetable oil. I also tried it with bread machine yeast after using the regular packets and the dough was much better.

The ratio of flour to water is way off, much too dry.   By omitting salt from the dough the crust became so bland.

Thank you for sharing this receipe .I loved this dough.I thought it was awesome that it came out so well considering that I did not allow it time to rise.The only problem that I had is that it stuck to the bottom of the pizza pan so next time I will definitely need to spray the bottom of the pan with oil.

Great recipe. Make it all the time. Makes 2 medium pizzas.  Takes a little getting used to when stretching it out. It wants to spring back. Found if you make  it a day in advance, split it in half and put it in the refrigerator overnight stretching it out is a lot easier. It doesn't want to spring back. Have made pulled pork with barbecue sauce, macaroni and cheese, baked potato with ranch dressing, french fries, bacon bits and chives, sausage with peppers and onions. The options are unlimited.

I tried this using LALDYMHARRIS's directions.  Instead of all purpose flour, I used bread flour (which was VERY old, and still worked out great).  I probably let is rise for about 45 minutes.  My daughter had a friend over, and we made about 8 personal pizza's out of this.  My husband used to manage a pizza restaurant, and he was blown away at how good it was.

We made two 9 x 13 pizzas tonight with thin crust and it was delicious, my guys loved it. I needed something fast! Hit the dough setting then browned sausage and cut up tons of veggies after it was mixed I let it sit for 15 to 20 min. I then began stretching out my dough to fit my cookie sheets (I should have waited maybe 5 more min. it would have been easier to work with and stretch out). Poked fork holes in the dough on my cookie sheets then prebaked shells in over 5 to 7 min like others suggested, pulled out and topped with tons of goodies my picky eater and hunny loved it. It was a hit and will make again in a pinch when we need fast!!!!

one word: THANKSSOMUCHFORAQUICKANDEASYRECIPIE!!!!! this was so simple to just put together before dinner. its really nice to have on hand when my seven siblings want pizza. fast. I would recommend baking it without toppings until solid, then adding on cheese, sauce, etc. and melting for about eight minutes- it hold together better. all in all it was quick and so simple. thanks for sharing this!

I've made it twice now and the dough comes out very thick and weighty with no flavor. I compared this recipe to the "Pizza Dough III" recipe and loved that one much more. I did let this dough sit for about 20 minutes as I prepared everything else and preheated the oven. Even having time to rise it didn't rise well. It tasted like a bad frozen pizza crust. The other recipe has you dissolve the yeast and let it rise for a few minutes before mixing it and also uses Olive oil. I think those two things made the difference. The crust came out nice and fluffy with a lot of flavor. Not my favorite recipe and I even gave it a second chance!

Yes! I finally found this recipe again! I made it twice, to rave reviews from the family, only to lose which one it was. I started to make the "Quick and Easy Pizza Crust" recipe on this website, and everyone complained. The crust didn't bake evenly, and it would either rise too much or not enough. But this crust? It has been a winner every time. I always double the recipe and make it in a rectangular pan. I sometimes get adventurous and add other things, like Italian seasoning, but it's not necessary. I find myself getting quite irritated with the reviewers who change the directions because it's not the way they've made pizza in the past. I have made traditional pizza doughs many, many times, and as a busy mom, I still prefer this one! Please just try this drop-dead easy crust exactly how it is at least once. You will be amazed that you can have such a scrumptious pizza with such little effort! I won't make the mistake of losing this recipe again; it's in my recipe box now.

This is a great recipe.  You don't need to make any of the changes that are suggested for it to work, because that's not the point of this recipe.  Just find the correct recipe for the situation you're in!  If you want a pizza dough that will be ready to go in 5-10 minutes, this is it.  It tastes fine, isn't too doughy, and is really really easy.  On the other hand, if you want a pizza dough that will make people think you should make pizza professionally, you need a DIFFERENT RECIPE.  This is not the recipe for that.  That type of recipe is great if you have the time and the means, but don't blame this recipe for trying to do something else!

Made for a Pizza Braid.  Slight changes: Dissolved sugar then yeast in warm water then added the remaining ingredients and I used olive oil instead of vegetable and added oregano (didn't measure)for flavor.  Cooked at 400 for 15-20 and it was WONDERFUL!!!!!

This recipe was great! I'm thankful for the reviews though as a made a few minor changes like adding garlic powder, oregano, Italian seasoning, a teeny extra sugar and salt and baking it alone before adding the sauce and toppings. Extremely easy and fun as I made it with my kid.

Great pizza dough.  Usually our pizza dough bubbles up like crazy.  This time we mixed the sugar, yeast, and water and let them sit for awhile before adding to the flour.  One the dough had risen, we made the pizza shape and put it on a pizza stone at 450 degrees for a few minutes till it hardened up a bit.  We then took it out and put the sauce and cheese on top, then put it back in the oven until the crust browned.  We've found otherwise that the cheese will be dark brown and the crust will still be a little raw in some spots if it all goes in at once.

I just made it. My family liked it, my husband couldn't stop eating. No adjustments to ingredients except I doubled the recipe. It was so fast, easy, I can not believe it, and came out perfect. There are so many negative reviews from the experienced bakers... you guys should know better than this, you have to start by adding yeast to a warm water/milk with sugar, you can not just mix all dry ingredients, flour and then add water, it won't work this way, yeast has to be dissolved and activated! I let dough rise for an hour, and it did double. I prebaked crust for 10 minutes at 400F (the higher temperature, the better pizza, don't bake at low temperatures), added sauce and toppings, cheese, and baked for 15 more minutes. You can sprinkle parmezan over crust prior to baking, it will keep your crust from getting soggy later. Another thing, I forgot to pock one crust with fork before baking, it bubbled like a balloon, and I pocked it at the end of first 10 minutes of prebaking trying to flatten it, but at the end this was the best pizza out of 4 I made, it actually came out fluffier. Some reviewers said they made their pizza in pyrex pans, I liked three I baked on a cookie sheet. Pizza was a bit soggy and flattish in pyrex, but still very good. Making this dough/crust was fastest and easiest part of the entire pizza making process (it used to be the worst part for me before I found this recipe!!), it takes more time to prepare toppings and clean up... :)

Made this last night and its a great basic pizza dough recipe. I followed the exact recipe but did 1 1/4 cup of water instead of 1 cup. I also added some seasonings which is totally dependent on the persons taste bud. The dough came out nice and soft. We also used it to make calzones. I also substituted vegetable oil with olive oil which is again a preference thing. Either oil would work great with recipe.

Ok ... Is this the best pizza dough recipe ever?  Heck, no. That said, it was exactly what it says it is - quick, easy, and you've got decent pizza in no time.  It's not a five-star recipe, but it's certainly four, with five-stars being reserved for outstanding flavor (and generally more effort as well!)

Absolutely worth having in the file for when you didn't plan ahead and crave pizza. Takes less time to make this than to order delivery, and it tastes better than that!

I followed exactly this recipe but after I baked it, it was too dry!! I did not like it.   But  I will try to reduce 2 1/2 cup flour instead of 3 cups next time since there are many postive comments about this recipe.    Also I did try another pizza dough recipe (Master Pizza Dough) with 2 1/2 cups of flour and it was delicious and soft!  I think 3 cups might be too much with just 1 cup of water.

Wow, made this as is and Wow.  I usually make homemade pizza one time per week.  It has to be on Sundays because of the dough rising and kneading and rising again.  I was looking for a new recipe for a thinner crust and stumbled on this one.  No way, can it be THAT easy?  I tried it, thinking that if this works out, I can make pizza on weeknights easily.  It's true!  In less than the time it would take for pizza to be delivered we had amazing pizza. I had some sauce I made previously in the freezer and some Gouda cheese, some olives, oregano and a bit of parmesian made this a fab pizza.  Thanks for this incredibly easy recipe.  My kids are eating the last pieces now (darn them).  Winner!

This was so easy and delicious! We like our pizza crust fairly thin, so we got two 15" pizzas out of this. Followed recipe exactly (2 1/4 tsp bulk yeast for the packet) and it turned out perfectly.

I made this crust on a whim as a late-night pizza.  I added garlic and dried basil, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  My crust was thick, doughy, and completely unleavened.  I think this is a good basic recipe, but next time I'll proof the yeast and take the time to let the dough rise for at least 30 minutes.

I tried this recipe twice this week. First I tried a suggestion from a reviewer that said that they let the dough rise for 30 min. first. Then tonight I made the recipe without letting the dough rise. There was no difference that I could tell. It was great both ways, quick and easy!

I go back to this recipe time and time again. The only changes I make are sometimes I use bread flour (when I have it on hand) , let it rest for ten minutes while I prep my toppings and pat into a well oiled pan. I bake at 400 for about 20 minutes. This makes the crust light and crispy and buttery. I also live in a humid sea-level climate and have a gas oven so this may not work for all but I get rave reviews whether I tweak it slightly or leave as is. No need to let it rise for an hour. That's not what this recipe is for!  Awesome recipe. Highly recommended.

I made this tonight exactly as written and it was FANTASTIC! (Well, I did let the finished dough sit for 15 minutes though while I was chopping pepperoni slices, strips of pepper and preparing the tomato sauce. However, I'm not sure that step was necessary; it didn't rise noticeably. But either way, boy was it fabulous!)

In any case, you do not need to proof the yeast separately as some have suggested. I didn't and my crust was delightfully thick, fluffy, rich and crispy. 

I only decided to try this recipe in a desperate attempt to save dinner when I discovered in horror that the pre-made crust I had purchased just a couple of days prior had sprouted mould all over. Ick. I didn't think it would work, but to my delight, it produced one of the best crusts I've ever tasted (way better than the $20 per pie variety we usually order in), and all in a knick of time. I will never purchase pre-made crusts again--this is my new go-to weekly pizza crust recipe.

Excellent! Easy to follow and make your own. I add a little basil, garlic powder and a pinch of thyme. Play around with it and have fun exploring. Follow the basic recipe and directions and you can't fail. Negative reviewers need to lighten up a little. It's meant to be simple.

This one's a keeper. Quick & easy. The family loves it. I sometimes add basil, oregano or garlic to the crust, but it's good on it's own too. Thanks for the recipe.

This dough is totally awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The texture is great and I loved that it didn't have to rise. So quick and easy! The only thing holding it back from five stars is the fact that it was a bit blander than I would have liked. Next time, I think I will add some seasoning or something to give it more flavor.

Thanks for the recipe. Will use again.

Absolutely love this recipe!  I've made it twice this week!  I read some of the other reviews and took some of the suggestions but honestly, I think the recipe would have been a home run either way.  I dissolved the yeast in the water with sugar while I measured the rest of the dry ingredients.  I added 1 1/2 tsp each of italian seasoning and garlic powder to the dry ingredients then added the water/yeast and oil.  I covered the bowl with plastic wrap and set it on the stove while I preheated the oven to 425.  I let the dough set for about 20-25 mins then I pressed it in my pans (greased with crisco and dusted with a bit of cornmeal).  It is one of the easiest doughs to press in a pan!  Not too sticky that it sticks to your hands and it doesn't "pull back" like other doughs do.  Pre baked the crust for about 7 min then took it out and added the sauce and toppings!  My husband said it was the best home made pizza he's ever had!  My daughter ate 3 pieces!  An absolute keeper!

I know this recipe by heart now.  Friday night is Pizza night at my house and I use this crust WITHOUT any modifications every Friday night without fail.  It is simple, easy to remember, and husband and kids love it!  I make my own sauce and we experiment with our toppings.  Love love love this crust.

If you're not looking to have the dough rise at all, adding yeast is pointless, especially since adding salt in the beginning the salt will kill the yeast. Otherwise it's fine, but you might want to add a few other ingredients to make it more flavorful.

The first time I made a pizza and it was wonderful. It helped me more that I've been making bread for a couple of months and the pizza dough is very similar. What I have to say is that I went to a couple of the reviews to get a better idea on how to do the rest because honestly, the directions on the recipe does not help a bit. So, thanks to you guys for sharing your knowledge! 

I baked the crust at 375 for 8 mins. then I put the sauce, 4 cheese blend, onions, tomatoes, peppers, artichokes, black olives, spinach and chicken. Right after that, I put it back in the oven for 20 mins. brushing the crust with olive oil and oh my....! The rest is history.

I didn't proof the yeast; so, don't be afraid to throw it all and mix it together; just be sure the water is at 110 degrees and put it in the oven a bit warm so it helps the yest to do its job for an hour. 

Enjoy!

I've been using this every time I make pizza.  The first time I did it as described and it came out just fine.  I did want to try letting it rise though, and so now I dissolve the yeast in water with the sugar first and let that sit for about 10 minutes before adding it to the other ingredients, then I let it rise for about 30-45 minutes.  It is good without, but it is even yummier with.  It is so nice to have a versatile recipe that I can whip up super quick if needed, or I can take more time on if I have it!

Very easy to make. Good easy night dinner. Have two kids and a husband in the military so easy dinners on the late night work days are for me. I simply love how easy it is to make. Wouldnt change a things about it. Also, the dough makes good bread sticks, and fried dough!

So I followed some people's advice from here and added seasonings, as well as giving the yeast and then the dough some time to grow. Let me tell you, hands down the absolute best pizza dough recipe EVER! And so simple! 

I doubled the recipe and put it into these medium sized stone dishes, and they kind of became more like Pizza Cakes because the dough grew so much in the oven, so if you double the recipe, divide it so that you get three portions instead of two (or use a really big baking sheet so you could spread the dough out thinner.

Great job with this recipe and great advice from the other users!

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe.  This is an excellent starter recipe, perfect for family pizza night.  I did, as others before me, make some minor variations.  I used 2 1/2 cups of flour instead of 3 and olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I added 1 tsp each of basil, garlic powder and oregano.  I kneeded the dough for 2 minutes before covering it with a damp paper towel and allowing it to sit/rise for an hour.  I then rolled out the dough and created a crust using a pinch/roll method.   I brushed the dough and crust liberally with an olive oil/salt mixture and baked it for five minutes.  Lastly, I added my toppings and baked for twenty minutes.  I made two pizzas; I did not double the recipe but made each dough independently: 1. Red sauce, yellow/white cheese mix, pepperoni, sausage, green bell pepper, onion, black olives, grated Parmesan (topping).  2. White (ranch) dressing, white Italian cheese mix, spinach, red onion, chopped grilled chicken, fresh chopped tomatoes, grated Parmesan (topping).  The dough/crust was thick and "doughy" just the way I like it!

Overall, I thought that this was quick and easy. I put this all in my Kitchen-Aid mixer. I substituted regular oil for olive oil(1/3 cup). Then added 1 tsp of garlic powder. When it was mixing a noticed it was still a little sticky so I added just a little mor flour. I let this rest for about 30 min or so, then baked the crust for 10 min. Added sauce, veggies, and cheese and it was a hit with my husband. I will for sure use this next time...Thanks!

I made this dough according to directions did not care for it. There have been so many wonderful reviews...should the dough be needed, let to rise, etc?

I was making pizzas on the grill for the family and wanted a dough that didn't have to rise for hours. Decided to give this a try, though I was skeptical: could something so easy be good enough? YES! I did actually wind up letting it rise for a couple of hours due to my schedule, and it was great. It grilled up beautifully--a little puffy, but maybe had I not let it rise it would have been thinner. Still excellent, though. Had some dough left over (I made three recipes) so I used some to make a gorgeous stromboli for lunch the next day. Perfect!

This is so fast and easy, I've stopped buying easy dough from the store!  I make this all the time, and the different things you can top it with are endless, just like from a pizzaria but much cheaper!

I confess to "doctoring" it up a bit with garlic and Italian seasoning but I still think this is a great week night pizza dough.  When I get home from work I don't have a lot of time to cook time consuming meals, but I made this last night. It was quick, easy, tasty and the 3 guys in the house loved it.  it IS a great weeknight fix.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.

We loved this! It was the perfect density - not too thick and not too thin, and chewy with just enough crisp. Making it was very simple too. We had enough dough to make two medium pizzas. This ones a keeper.

My husband and I use this recipe every time we make pizza. When we get home from work, the last thing we want to do is wait hours before eating dinner. This recipe is quick and easy and tastes great. Don't listen to any of the people who said the recipe didn't work or doesn't taste good. They obviously didn't make the recipe the right way!

I made this tonight for the first time.  I used olive oil in place of the vegetable oil.  I let it rest in a bowl for half hour or so.  Made two crusts about 14 inch diameter each.  I was GREAT!!!  And so easy.  Had a dinner guest ask for the recipe !!

Awesome crust!   This is not a fancy crust but it is easy and fast.  That is what it's ment to be.  You do not need to alter the recipe.  Try it once as is and you will be sold!

Reminded me of the dough that used to come in a box with a little can of sauce and a packet of parmesan cheese and was called pizza.  We are not a fan of this dough, though to it's credit, it was quick and easy.

Very good, and super easy.  Didn't need to let the dough sit or anything.  We actually turned this one recipe into two good-sized (but thin-crusted) pizzas that easily fed our family of four.  Then cooked them on a pizza stone on the grill.  Yum!

All in all a good dough. Easy to work with. I subbed whole wheat flour for all purpose. My kids didn't give a hoot, husband didn't like. But he though the dough had good texture and was thick enough. I used a 12" pizza pan. Needed at least the 25 min, I always lift the bottom crust up to see how dark it is. I like a golden brown and let it stay in a few minutes longer.

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you so much!!! Tonight was make-your-own-pizza night....I had forgotten to mix up my usual pizza dough recipe, which needs to rise for about an hour, so I needed something quick, easy, and tasty....and also not sticky!!  My 8 year-old and I had a blast making this (she put hers in her Easy Bake Oven), it didn't need time to rise, was easy to work with, and is baking up beautifully!

This wasn't terrible but not what I was expecting in a pizza dough. Very easy to make but was hard to spread in my pan and didn't cook well. My cheese started getting too brown before the crust was ready.

Great recipe! I've made a couple pizza dough recipes from this site and this is the easiest and the most consistent. I usually pre-make my dough earlier in the day so that gives it some time to rise, and this has come out of the fridge after a couple days just as excellent as freshly made. I wisk the sugar and yeast first, let it sit for a few minutes and then add the rest of the ingredients. I do find that I have to add a little extra water, but that's it.

This made a very tasty pizza crust. I made pizza rolls with them and everyone agreed that the pizza crust really made the rolls taste great! I followed the recipe exactly, but would recommend you let the dough rest for about 30 minutes so it'll be easier to roll out and work with.

Oh... My... GOODNESS! This is the first time I've ever reviewed a recipe, so that says something! This pizza crust was the first I ever made from scratch and I was so impressed and proud of the results. It held all of the toppings without sagging; 3 boys here so I load the toppings :) I did make some additions and one change: I used olive oil instead of vegetable, added about 3 Tbsp parmesan cheese, 3 Tbsp garlic powder, and 2 Tbsp Italian seasoning, for more an Italian herb and cheese crust. The aroma was so delicious as I pre-baked the crust for about 6 minutes before I topped it. Worst part was no leftovers :( Thank you, Gudny!

This is an excellent pizza dough recipe. I did add a little Italian seasoning, crushed basil and garlic then spread butter over the top for my own flare of this recipe. It was delicious. I used the Homemade Pizza Sauce recipe from Taste of Home Test Kitchen which was a great combination.

Overall a pretty good, basic recipe. The second time I made it I added in Italian Seasoning to the dry ingredients (just seasoned to taste) to give it a little more oomph.  I also used a food processor to mix the ingredients - so much easier! I also suggest letting the dough rise for about 30 minutes...it made for a better crust than when I did it without letting it rise. If you have a baking/pizza stone to bake it on it turns out better than using a cookie sheet or metal pizza pan.

Thank you Gudny for this recipe. It makes a wonderful crust, slightly crispy, yet still soft, and we all loved it. I did add italian spices, garlic and herbs as I love a lot of flavour. I tripled the recipe, making 2 batches on the dough cycle of my bread machine, and let the dough sit until I was ready to make the pizzas. It made 3 pizzas, with enough for a 4th, but I am going to try garlic sticks out of the 4th ball of dough. I also used a pizza stone sprinkled with cornmeal, baking at 425 Yummy!

Awesome easy recipe that anyone can follow. My best pizza ever. Wont ever waste my $ on store bought dough again! Even added some italian seasoning to the flour for a savory touch. I like my crust really crispy, so i baked it for a 5-7 mins before adding my sauce & toppings. Its a new family fave!

OMG!  This crust is so dang good!  Our family usually has pizza/movie night every weekend.  We have gone from take out (too expensive for good pizza), to freezer pizza which we were really tired of.  I came across this super easy recipe and it has changed our weekends!  Now, because we don't have to wait for the crust to rise, our boys make their own pizza and love it.  It is tasty, soft but crunchy oh and did I say easy??  You will absolutely love this crust.

Stop looking for a dough recipe - this one is it!  I've used it right after mixing and after letting it sit for 30 minutes - either way this crust is delicious.  We are a thick crust family, you can adjust this to whatever thickness you want depending on your pan.  Sometimes I use a round pan and push extra dough to the edges...then set string cheese pcs around the edge, pull dough over the cheese and press/tuck it into the flat part of the dough.  Add sauce (Easy Pizza Sauce III) and toppings - the absolute best pizza out of your kitchen!!!!!

QUICK! EASY! My favorite recipe for when we want pizza - FAST. I sometimes toss together all the toppings, combine with pizza sauce, spread on crust, sprinkle with cheeses, and faster than you know it, the pizza's in the oven. Not the prettiest, but pretty darn quick!

This was SO quick and easy!! It was exactly what I needed tonight when the kids wanted Pizza and I was unprepared.  I was not expecting it to come out as wonderful as it did, and in less than 10 minutes to get it in the oven.  Fast and easy were two things I needed.  In the future I may add soem spices or give it time to rise, but in a pinch it is perfect just the way it is.  I will never buy frozen pizza again---it IS THAT easy!

This is absolutely the best pizza dough recipe we have found. We love homemade pizza and this is definitely a keeper. I use cheap spaghetti sauce for a tomato base, sprinkle with cheese, add lots of meat and veggies and then sprinkle with cheese again. I use 1/2 of an envelope of taco seasoning to flavor the hamburger, slice deli ham into thin ribbon strips, crumble bacon, sliced olives and sliced onions. This makes a perfect cookie sheet sized pizza!

the best I've tried, and I've tried many different ones from the net and from books.

My way: I 'proof' the yeast, add it to the sugar water first, like another reviewer says. And I brush some butter on before adding sauce and toppings. I like to leave the dough in the refrig overnight; I think it improves the taste and how it works. Other than that, just like the rx says.

I've tried high gluten, low gluten, adding bread flour, pasta flour, different oils, different yeasts. Nothing works as well as this.

I like the fact that this is a very quick recipe, but it never got crisp even after nearly burning the cheese and toppings. It was okay, but I probably wouldn't make it again.

Great recipe that I can whip up real quick.  Not going to blow your mind but more than adequate considering the short amount of time it takes to prep.  I usually bake it around 415F on a pizza stone dusted with corn meal because I'm always aiming for a crispy bottom.

Fantastic!!
The only thing I would recommend is that you cook the crust with garlic butter brushed on for about 7 minutes before topping and baking the rest of the way.

I have been searching forever for a good pizza dough recipe. And since finding this one, there are no others I use. The pizza I make now is so so good that no one wants to order it, they just all shout "KAYLA! MAKE PIZZA!"
Best recipe for dough period.

We love this pizza dough recipe.  My daughter and I make it together all the time.  She loves to knead it :)  We also made this during a play date and her friends got to pick the toppings.  They still talk about that!

One suggestion though, we found that the dough is much more elastic if you sub. 1/2 the white flour with whole wheat flour.

5 stars for quick! It was good enough for my seven year old son, my husband, and I! My son wanted to learn about how pizza is made and I didn't want to spend hours on the dough - this is a great recipe when you don't have a lot of time.

I made this for a party recently and it was devoured before my very eyes. The only difference I made was, after mixing it together I needed it into a dough ball, then let it sit over the warm oven covered in plastic wrap I had sprayed with cooking spray. I let it sit for only 5 - 10 minutes to let it rise just a little and then spread it onto my pizza pans. A wonderful recipe for people on a budget :)

This was so easy and was good. I have a container of yeast and not the packets so I used 1 TBSP of it. I also sprinkled Italian seasoning on the crust and it gave it great flavor. Will definitely used this again.

I rated it 5 stars because of the ease to taste ratio.  You can get better dough recipes, but not this easy.  I knead it for a minute or two by hand, let it sit for ten minutes in a warm place and then bake it, but it doesn't even need that much attention, you can really just combine everything and bake it right away, as the direction say. I also use it as a foccacia base when I want a quick bread for parties.

I can't rate this recipe based on how it was written, but next time I will try it as was written to see if my results will be different method-wise. Instead of white flour, I used whole wheat flour 2 1/2C and 1/2C spelt flour (I was just curious) to make 3 cups of flour. I added 1/2C fresh parsley, dashes of oregano, paprika, basil, 1 tsp onion powder, and  a clove of fresh garlic. I combined the yeast, sugar, and warm water for about 10 mins to get it foamy, then after mixing with the dry ingredients, let it rest for an hour. I think this might have altered the texture of the dough and I am not sure in what way but I will try it the way the recipe states next time. The pizza crust turned out crispy and airy and was quite tasty (I think from the spices and herbs that were added) but I may increase the salt by 1 tsp next time. In comparison to the Whole Wheat and Honey Pizza Dough, this was a 100% upgrade (and my boyfriend said so too). The only thing I will remember for next time is to grease the pizza stone!  Thanks for the recipe.

Super simple recipe with good results. I did do 2.5 cups of flour and 3 Tbsp of olive oil per some of the suggestions. But no kneeding, no letting it rise, just mix and stretch and bake. Great recipe :)

Fantastic!  When we entered "super-budget mode", this recipe saved us a lot!  It's good as it is, but we also add a few twists of the italian grinder to give the dough some flavor.

Excellent for the purpose for which it was designed.  Only changes I made were to add whole wheat flour for half the flour and we used olive oil.  We did two batches and split the dough so that we had four decent sized, thin crusted pizzas (but it was still chewy!).  Will definitely be using this one again!

This was perfect for the holidays because it didn't require much rising and the kids loved decorating their own pizzas. The taste was surprisingly good considering how effortless this recipe is (we used a standing mixer).

I made this dough tonight. I made it as is, just added some italian herbs, garlic , and onion powder to it. Mixed it then sat it aside for about 10 mins. so i can saute some mushrooms with onions and garlic. It turned out nicely moist and chewy. Very good dough, i liked it a lot. quick and easy. Definitely a keeper.

Delicious and quick. I had some extra time so I did let it rise for an hour: "1 1/4 cups warm water, 1 pkg active dry yeast, 1 tblsp sugar, 1 tsp thyme or Italian seasonings, 3 tblsp olive oil, 3+ cups of flour, 1 tsp salt. Mix water, yeast, sugar & oil in mixer bowl. Then add flour & salt. Mix-knead for 10-12 minutes, sprinkling with flour to keep from sticking to bowl. Dough should be elastic & smooth. Place dough in oiled bowl, cover dough with oil, cover & let stand 1 hr at room temp. Then divide dough 2 equal parts roll into balls, cover with damp towel & let stand another 10 mins. Use immediately. Don't forget to poke holes into dough with fork once rolled onto pan to let steam escape while baking. "

Brilliant!  This easy and surprisingly good crust topped with pizza sauce 1 from this site and you can have a home made pizza in about 45 minutes made with common pantry staples and none of the scary ingredients found in a frozen pizza!  Thank you for sharing Gudny!

This was a perfect fix to frozen dough that didn't work out for me one evening.  Didn't want to have to wait for dough to rise and this hit the mark! Quick, easy and tasted great for a basic recipe.

Absolutely perfect recipe!  Don't change a thing when you make it.  The dough is the best I have ever made!  It doesn't rise while baking so it would be perfect to attempt stuffed crust!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I used this recipe at my daughters' birthday party, I made the dough just before the party, divided into 4 and at the party I let everyone roll out and decorate their own pizza. It was super easy and a big hit with everyone. No rising necessary, it rose in the oven.Thanks so much for this great recipe.

I made this recipe 2 nights ago. I browsed through  a few of the reviews and decided to combine the yeast, sugar, and warm water in a bowl for 15 minutes prior to mixing. I also added basil, oregano, and garlic herb seasoning to the flour mixture. I brushed the crust with olive oil and baked in the over for 15 min at 400 degrees prior to adding my toppings. The pizza tasted great and smelled even more divine! It's definitely more of a flat bread crust but that's OK. It was quick and simple. Gotta love it!

Added herbs, garlic powder, and onion powder. Otherwise I followed the directions exactly. Used ranch sauce instead of tomato. Delish! Well done.

Delish, easy, and cheap!  Made as written expect increased the salt to 2 tsp.  My husband and his friends devoured it.  Given the cost of pizza - plus delivery - I will be making this recipe over and over again.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I made this as described except I added some garlic powder to the dough mix...  This was actually a really great pizza!  The dough came out really nice from the oven... a little crispness, and a good durability for toppings... along with a really nice flavor.

We just made a standard pepperoni with it, but i sliced garlic cloves into super thin slices, and dotted the sauce with them.  They melted into it while cooking, and made this pizza AMAZING!  

This is what I will use most times to make pizza... super easy, super fast, and no one would ever know it wasn't a much more involved dough.

I am sure there are a few things you could do to customize this dough, or alter the final product to suit your needs at any one time... but for a really good, american type pizza this is PERFECT.  I am going to try it for a margarita style in a couple days.  This will really showcase the dough and see what (if anything) it needs to make that perfect.

Make sure your yeast is the right type, and is alive!  Warm water, not boiling to proof the yeast.

I actually ended up with inactive yeast the first time, and still used it, just to see what happened... and it still came out really good.  You could, however, tell that "Something" was a bit off, but not taste or usability.

Texture was similar to doughy rolls and didn't really remind me of pizza dough. Definetely think adding garlic powder and italian seasonigs are a must.

Very good and so easy! Took advice of others and baked 10 min (mine was thick) then brushed with olive oil and Italian seasoning, topped with toppings and baked another 12 - 15 min. Tasted great and the kids loved it!

This was SUPER fast & easy.  My 12 year old made it, and it was great!  I think that you can't really compare it to one that rises, but for as easy as it is, it was great!  Homemade pizza in less than an hour!

I don't know what I did differently than other reviewers, but I did not care for this. Very tough and no flavor.  Followed the directions exactly.  Will not be making again.  Very disappointing.

I just made this recipe, and I can say that it is gone already.  It is the best recipe for a thin crust pizza.  I followed exactly the recipe to the letter.  I don't have big pizza pan so I divided the dough on two patches, the second patch, the pizza crust was thicker.  So I guess, if you are looking for a thick crust pizza yo can let rise for 10 min. or 15min.
This pizza is good if you are in a hurry and don't have a whole a lot of time to cook.
Enjoy!

My Husband loved it, He ate half of a pizza by his self.  If I could I would give it 10 stars, This will be good for allot of different recipes.

This is such a great recipe! fast, easy and turns out really nice and fluffy. This dough also makes really great garlic bread sticks. I just rolled it out, placed in a greased pan, brushed garlic spread across the top and baked as directed, it was amazing!

I prepare it exactly as it is!  I want EASY and quick so this works for me.  I don't have the patience to wait for dough to rise.  If I want more elaborate, I'll find a different recipe.  Thanks for a winner, we haven't purchased takeout pizza in about 2 years now! :)  I use along with Easy Pizza Sauce I.

LOVED how quick, easy and cheap this is.  It also makes a bigger batch than I was anticipating. I easily made it into two pizzas.  I like the crust crispier so I precooked just the crust for about 8 minutes before adding toppings.

Use 2 to 1 regular to bread flour. Add semolina 1/5 cup for something textured nice. olive oil . let rise for at least 30 min if ur in a rush. Otherwise kill back the sugar and let rise longer (can take much longer with low sugar). Overall it is very recommended to mix all ingredients with 50% of total flour. Let the liquid dough sit for 10 min to mature. Then add the rest of the flour while kneading in mixer.  Overall quick and good recipe but gets boring.

Oh my!  I just made this for the first time, exactly as the recipe reads.  Remember that this is a K.I.S.S (Keep It Simple Sweetheart) recipe.  It made 8 mini pizzas, which  I baked on my pizza stone.  The crust stayed thin and crispy. This will be my go to recipe from now on.

Easy enough recipe, but as will all pizza crust recipes, it all depends on how you like your crust. As a Chicagoan, not all crusts are the same. This was easy to prepare and all, but it came out like bread sticks in consistency - soft. It didn't have any real chew to it and frankly, it was very bland. If you're looking for an edible carrier for your pizza, this works. I like a crispy thin crust with a definite chew so this had to receive only three stars.

quick, simple recipe that turns out great!  I love that I can make a pizza from scratch in less time than it takes to deliver one.

I was excited to find a pizza dough that would be quick and easy... I made it exactly as the recipe says. I have experience making yeast dough and have made many of my own pizza doughs and this was by far the worst I have had. The dough would not cook through all of the way and I always parbake my crust. "Quick and easy" was not worth it.

Very, very good for a nice, fast crust!  I used it to make a stromboli and it cooked up beautifully.  Thanks very much.  :-)

I followed this recipe to a T and it was ok. It was dense and chewy. It was ok for a quick pizza dough but I think I'll stick to the one that requires a little more patience.

My husband is a pizza crust critic! He is very finicky and he absolutely loved this crust. It was very easy to make. It is not a wimpy crust, it stands on its own...No Sagging! I added some garlic powder, oregengo and black pepper to the recipe, but that is just our liking. This is definitely one I will use over and over again!

This is my official pizza dough for our monthly "Pizza Nights" with our friends. It's versatile, too. I usually use all whole wheat flour and it turns out great. I always cut the dough in half and make two 12" round pizzas out of it. It makes a nice thin crust.

This recipe is definitely a keeper!  It's amazing that it could taste so good without going thru the pain-in-the neck process of letting the dough rise and rest and punch etc.

I feel like I've finally found a valuable recipe for making pizza last minute!! Kudos to the creator of this one! I've always made my own dough, but used a bread maker on the dough setting. It was good, but I had to plan ahead at least a couple of hours. Tried this in a pinch for time tonight  and it was a big hit!! I added a sprinkle of Italian seasoning to the dough and cooked longer and at a higher temp (375), otherwise followed the recipe. This one's a keeper!!! Thanks so much!

This is my go-to pizza dough recipe.  Over the years I've altered it slightly--I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil, sometimes use a half-whole-wheat flour mix, and add garlic powder, basil, or rosemary to the dough for extra flavor.  This recipe is a great basic dough recipe that is easy to customize to fit your tastes.

Makes a yummy crust.   I was disappointed in that it makes a rather small pizza, I had to switch out pans once the dough was done mixing, and I realized how much I actually had.   It is also fairly hard to work with to cover the pan, not a real smooth, elastic dough.   Despite those issues though, the taste is wonderful, so I'll award it 4 stars.  :)  I did add some garlic powder and oregano to the mix to add some additional flavor.  I also added corn meal to the pan before putting the dough on to add some authenticity.  ;)

I have made pizza dough so many times for our family and each time I try a new recipe everyone says it's okay but it's too thick, too thin, too crispy, not crispy enough, you get the point.  Everyone LOVED this, it was just perfect. Super easy and quick and delicious which is something I need!

This pizza dough turned out thin for me because I mixed in the oil a bit late, but still everyone in my family enjoyed it. I always prefer though to add some dried basil, oregano and thyme or some Mrs. Dash Basil and Garlic and some garlic powder to the dry ingredients, for an extra measure of flavor. I don't have a large pizza pan, so divided this recipe in two and made 2, 12 in. pizzas.

Super Easy and Nummy, I would add a little less salt next time. I also made 1/2 a batch and it turned out wonderful since the pizza I wanted to make would just be for 2 people. I also added 1/2 cup of wheat flour, and it was yummo !

Oh, this was so easy! Usually when we've had home made pizza we've used a box mix, but I don't think I will ever do that again. I always have all of the ingredients here in the house and it's so quick there is no reason not to make pizza dough home made. This made a great, soft crust, which is how we like our pizza. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us!

Very good! I used the pizza spices from Winco in the dough and it was great! Wish I'd have used non stick spray or olive oil on the bottom of the dough as some of it stuck to the pizza pan....topped with Easy Pizza Sauce III from this site and put 1/4 tsp baking soda to cut acidity...Monteray Jack and Cheddar blend cheese and Canadian Bacon it was fantastic!! Will definately make again! I froze these into 4 individual sized pizzas about 2 months ago and they still were very good!

This isn't my favorite pizza dough recipe, but it's nice because it's really quick and easy for weeknights. Many reviewers of this recipe make suggestions for letting it raise, but that kind of defeats the purpose of this particular recipe: quick & easy. The only change I would make is to use extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil, but for heaven's sake, don't make a special trip to the store if you don't have it on hand :)

This was perfect.  Fast. Easy. Common ingredients.  And I am not sure why people comment that it was bland.  I always thought Pizza dough was meant to be bland so not to conflict with or upstage the toppings.

I could not believe how easy this came together! For sure, the dough could probably benefit from some herbs, but you can not find an easier dough to make.

This turned out well for a quick and easy pizza dough. It clearly does not turn out like yeasty chewy pizzeria pizza dough, but good for quick and easy.  It makes a lot of dough, as I used a 14" pizza pan, made a lip, and the dough was 1/2" thick when baked.  I baked at 400", but otherwise followed the recipe exactly including the time baked.  It turned out crispy, not chewy, but firm and crusty  Despite all the toppings I used which were diced tomato,  olives, onions, peppers, mushrooms, pepperoni, and mozzarella cheese, the crust held up and was not soggy.  I was able to cut the pizza and serve a slice without it bending.  Of course i prefer pizzeria pizza that you can fold in half and is chewy, but this was not what you get with this quick and easy no rise pizza dough recipe.  If I have more time, I will let the dough rise, which is the key to chewy dough, but for quick and easy, this recipe works. I think I may try making up a batch a day before I need it and let it rise, punch it down and refrigerate until needed, as I have purchased it this way in the grocery bakery section and it was yeasty and fabulous.

Very happy with how easy this dough is to prepare.  The kids were able to help.  Pizza dough hand tossed was light and yummy. I rolled out an extra piece of dough really thin and was fine, just not as yummy.

This dough recipe is soft and thick! I make it in my bread machine on the dough cycle and bake it on a round pizza stone.

This was an ok recipe. This was my first time making pizza dough, so I'm no expert. I think I need a pizza stone, although I don't know if that would help or not. The crust didn't look anything like the picture and was rather thin instead. For a last minute dough, I would use this again, but I'd prefer to plan ahead and use a better recipe in the future. I like a thick, crunchy pizza crust and this was neither....although, again, maybe that's because I need a pizza stone? It did, however, taste just fine and I did not add anything to the crust. I agree with another reviewer that the crust is where you add the flavor, but that's just my opinion.

Great quick recipe!  The only change I made was honey instead of sugar (since we try and avoid white sugar.)  Definately will use this again.  :)

Really great soft pizza crust. We added some oregano and shredded sharp cheddar cheese to the crust and let it rise for about 30 minutes.

I don't know if it was just me because most have rated this pretty good.  My dough came out very sticky and I had to add more flour to get it to flatten out and it kept pulling apart.  I think kneading needs to be in the instructions.  I did knead the dough (as I was adding the extra flour just to get it off my hands).  I also agree with some others that possibly some garlic powder and some basil or parm cheese would help the flavor a little.

Easy and tasty.  Even better if you knead it and let it rise a little (I only did about 20 minutes).  I subbed 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and added 1/4 cup honey and 2 tbsp of Italian seasoning.  Yummy!

This dough is so easy to make and it comes out wonderfully.  It makes a great hand-tossed type of dough (this other recipe I used came out like crackers) and if you add some spices to the mix you get some great flavor.

Quick and tasty!  I substituted garlic salt for salt.  I rolled it out like others had suggested and let it rise for a few minutes while preparing the toppings (BBQ sauce, chicken, and red onions with cheddar and mozzarella cheese).  It worked well to make one, big thin-crust pizza.  We were so hungry that we only cooked 20 minutes - should have done 5 more.  I'll experiment with different flavors but this has become my go-to for pizza crust!  Thanks for posting!

Great recipe. Would definitely make this again...making pizza from scratch is awesome. This was fast, and yummy! SUGGESTION - roll it pretty flat unless you like really thick crust...for me, it took away some of the taste of the toppings but it was still really good.

Super easy and really tasty. I mixed the yeast in the water, sugar, and oil first, stirred until dissolved, and then added the flour and salt. I also added some garlic powder, basil, and oregano. I let it rise while I was getting the toppings ready, rolled it out, brushed the edges with olive oil, sprinkled with garlic powder and salt, then baked it for about 20 mins and it was perfect!

Easy yes, but the taste and texture was not very good. I would rather spend the time to make it right, or use a refridgerated dough if in a rush.

This will do in a pinch, though obviously you will get different results if you let it rise. It was a little doughy, so next time I will follow the advice to cook it for 5-7 minutes before topping it. Otherwise, pretty good.

I love this recipe I use it all the time for pizza. I only had 2 cups of flour then add to it in small amounts to get the right constancy. I also had 2 tsp garlic powder and 1 Tbs Parsley leaves and it tastes wonderful!

This dough rocks. I put the yeast, sugar, and warm water aside, mixed up the rest of the ingredients and then poured in the yeast mixture. I let the dough rise a little, half an hour, 15 minutes. I also added some garlic powder to the mixture. AMAZING! We made mini make-your-own pizzas topped with all sorts of vegetables and fried eggplant. Great dough.

This dough is the EASY, I added dried Rosemary,Basil and to garlic Granules to it.  Sooooo easy, and tasty. This recipe is perfect as is, once you've made it a few times, you'll be ready for adjusting the recipe to the type of dough consistency you like, and you'll be ready to add your own touches.  Enjoy.
Tip, if adding extra ingredients, lessen flour, add more olive oil and I use cornmeal underneath, to keep from sticking.

this pizza dough was so amazing!!! Ive tried so many recipes where you have to wait several hours for rising, but they never turned out that great. always too chewy...But this was so fabulouse and so easy. I cant wait to make another pizza! I substituted 2 cups flour for whole wheat flour, keeping one cup of white flour for aq healthier pizza, and topped it with turkey pepperoni and buffallo meat, my fam was raving about it!

I made this as directed and it was a wonderful change from store-bought crusts...and so easy! I gave this 5 stars because it is so versatile depending on your tastes. Using other reviews you can make a thin crust or a thicker crust, add seasonings or leave it plain. It really is a great basic recipe to have on hand...thank you for sharing it!

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this dough!  I use it for last minute pizza, rolls, and breadsticks....it's so smooth and yummy!  I brush melted butter with a little garlic salt in it on top after they're all done baking, and around the crust.  It soaks in and just finishes off a great meal!

I rarely use this recipe to actually make pizza, but it makes fabulous pizza bread.  Often, I add herbs to the dough when I am kneeding it.  Once it is spread out on the pan, I'll add herb oil and then sprinkle it with parmesean and feta.  Hot out of the oven, it's amazing and my family loves it!

This dough was so quick and easy that alone gets 5 stars!!! I know this is fantastic because I kinda ruined a little by replacing all flour with whole wheat flour and I should have only done half and half.. and I could still eat it! I'm excited to try it the proper way. it was just a little too much wheat.. so don't do this!  Oh I also used splenda which i'm not used to and i recommend that! Do try this it'll save so much time and energy and it's worth it!

This was a great pizza dough recipe.  I have a recipe that works great in a wood stove, but doesn't work so well in an oven, so I went looking and found this one.   I did it two ways:  The first way is the original way of doing it with the exception of dissolving the yeast and sugar first.  I used it in a breakfast pizza and it turned out great.  The second way is I took the advice of Cindy76541 and let it rise for 30 minutes while I prepared the toppings.  I also kneaded a few times (just because), and did the deep dish thing as Cindy76541 did.  It came out great.  The one thing I think I will change next time is take the advice of another review which said to use less flour - maybe by 3/4 of a cup.  Three cups seemed a bit too much and kept the dough from being "elastic-ish".  Dont know if that's the way its supposed to be or if it is because I live in a very high altitude (8,000 ASL).  All in all, it turned out great!  Thanks for sharing!

I can never remember to take the time to make dough.  This recipe is awesome in that I can "throw" it together, have kids make their pizza and it's GOOD!! :O)  Thanks you for the recipe.

I've made this twice. Once using only whole wheat flour and one using a combo of regular and whole wheat. The mixture of the two turned out better than the entire whole wheat. I find that when I use whole wheat flour I have to add more water or it's too dry. I usually add garlic and onion powder to the mixture as well for some flavor. A super yummy crust that's super easy!!

Very dense dough, I tried it more then once just in case it was me. It might be easy but it is tough and not enjoyable, I will just go back to my original family recipe. Short cuts aren't always the better way to go.

Made this recipe this evening and it was GREAT! I agree with many of the reviews that for a simple, quick and easy pizza dough...this one is it!  I will definitely make this recipe again...perhaps with some spices next time.  But I say again, for a simple, last minute crust...WOW!  I was very pleased!

This is a decent basic dough mix.  Like other reviewers I think that you have to personalize it.  My dough stuck onto the pizza pan so I wish the recipe had mentioned to grease the pan :(

Made this twice and it tastes like uncooked bread. Easy, yes but could taste better if I read all the other reviews and followed them instead of just this recipe.

My family really likes my homemade pizza better than the brick oven pies just down the street. And this is the basic recipe that I use. The only things I changed are that I added freshly grated pecorino Romano cheeses to the oil and I used EVO instead of vegetable oil. I substituted one cup of flower with one cup of whole wheat flower, I think it gives it a bit better texture. I also sprayed the outer edge of the pie crust with butter flavored vegetable spray and sprinkled freshly grated Romano cheese on it before baking. I baked mine at 550 degrees for 15 minutes and it turned out perfect for my family’s likes.

This recipe was sooo easy. Ive used it a few times when i come home from work and im too tired to cook. It takes just a few mins to mix together and roll out. My husband and i like to make mexican pizza and top the dough with beans, taco meat, cheese, salsa, sour cream, olives, etc. The only thing that i do differently is after i roll the dough out i bake it for 10 to 15 mins before i add the toppings to make the crust more crisp.

I give this crust as many thumbs up as I possibly could.  I made this recipe as written, except I substituted a gluten-free baking mix for the flour, as I can't eat gluten.  I did have to add a few splashes of water, but the gluten-free mix tends to absorb water differently, so next time I will probably just not put as much baking mix.  Oh, I also added a sprinkle of garlic powder, oregano, and parm cheese.  I live alone, so I usually make dough like this and portion into individual sizes, partially bake them, and then free.  I was able to get 6 9-inch thinnish crusts out of this recipe, so it makes a ton of dough!  I made one for dinner tonight, and oh my goodness, it's delish.  The crust came out crispy on the bottom but still chewy.  It had a really good flavor too.  I enjoyed this one way more than any other pizza crust I've made (and I've been eating homemade pizza my whole life), so I will probably keep it.  Can't beat it - it was ready within 1/2 hour and tasted good!

Great as is. As has been pointed out, if you want a fancy, make-it-3-days-in-advance kind of dough, this isn't it. If you want pizza in 30 minutes, this is your dough.

Use the recipe as it is. I tried a few variations and it was not good. First, I tried the 2tbsp of honey (as one person suggested). Bad idea. The dough never got crispy... and it's still in the oven after 45 min.... still doughy. Also, I tried adding 1 tbsp of salt. Who knows if it helped b/c I can't eat the pizza. Roll it out thin... that's my suggestion. If I ever do try it again I'll probably just follow the directions as written. Well, I added seasonings also. It looks a little strange with the basil mixed in. I'm a little disappointed. Better luck to all the other people out there. Just follow the recipe. It turned out so gross with me, that I had to throw it away. Inedible. :(

excellent quick - spur of the moment pizza crust!!! Makes a nice crisp crust very quickly.  Thank you!  (note, this is not a deep dish, risen dough, that takes a little more time, and planning ahead.  We use Jay's recipe for that.  This is for those times when you want pizza in 30 minutes - excellent!!!!)

This dough is definitely tastier than the store-bought refrigerated dough I usually get.  I just added a sprinkling of grated parmesan cheese to the dry ingredients and I baked it on my pizza stone at 450 for about 15 mins. and it was a nice texture.  Easy!!!

It is a little more dense than your average pizza crust, which can be good as far as flavor and texture if you prefer that.  My Husband does and he loves this recipe, however I found that the dough is so thick and dense that it is really hard to work with compared to other recipes I've tried.  It takes me 2 or 3 times longer to work this dough out to make a crust.  It is a good recipe and I will probably make it now and then because my husband loved the flavor so much, but it will not be my regular recipe.

Like a lot of people, I always tweak recipes. I learned to bake bread when I was 10, but have since lost my mom's recipe. Anyway, I always let my yeast "cook" before adding it to my flour mixture. I used 1 t honey instead of the sugar, simply because I like to use honey. Anyway, I added garlic, basil and oregano to my flour mix. After the yeast "cooked" 10 minutes, I mixed and kneaded everything in my stand mixer w/the bread hook; then let it rise {in my microwave(no power of course) cuz my apartment is drafty. }for 15 minutes. Added my homemade sauce and topping, it's just beautiful, smells great and tastes even better. Thanks for the original post and comments recommending the rising time. When I'm in a hurry, I will use this recipe without letting it rise. I'm confident it'll be fine if I let my yeast "cook" first.

Made exactly as directed and we weren't happy with it.  I think its worth the wait for the dough to rise.  Whats the since of adding yeast if you don't let it rise, if you're just going to bake it maybe a teaspoon of baking soda would make more sense.

I have made this as is, and I have also tried letting it rise and whatnot. I really liked that I could whip this up in no time without waiting for rising, and also if I plan on pizza I can make it earlier and let it rise. Definately a keeper.

Foolproof recipe.   Recipe is perfect as written, tuly not necessary to let dough rise.    I made this a couple of days ago, letting it rise for a couple of hours, because I had the time to do so.  It was very good.    I decided to try it for lunch today with my toddler.  It took minutes from measuring to oven, using the stand mixer to combine everything and give it a little kneading action.  The dough was easy to work with and was done in 20 minutes.  Highly recommended!

This worked out great! The kids got to top them themselves with whatever they wanted. We also used the dough to make calzones. I will definately be using this recipe again! Thanks!

If you are wondering what this is like, it tastes like one of the pizza dough mixes in the pouch at the store.  The difference is that when you mix the pouch mixes they are normally really sticky, but this is not.  Be sure to put some olive oil down on the pan before spreading out so it doesn't stick. No more pouch mixes for us, this is super duper easy and every bit as good.

This is my go-to pizza dough. I think it tastes better than other recipes that call for hourlong rising. I only gave it 4 stars, though, because I alter the recipe. I usually half the recipe, as it makes two 12" pizzas. I mix the yeast, warm water and sugar and let stand for 5-10 minutes. Then I add in the rest of the ingredients. Once the dough comes together, I let it rest for about 10 minutes in an oiled bowl. Cooked on a pizza stone, each pie takes about 30 minutes -- crust comes out perfectly thin and crispy!

VERY EASY and DELICIOUS! I just added some italian seasonings and it was perfect. The crust wasn't too thick or too thin - just perfect. I cooked it for a little longer than 25 minutes - probably 35 mintues. The crust was soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside - perfect!

I made this recipe for our Saturday night pizza, last night, without mentioning I changed recipes.  My husband immediately commented on the crust being like the crust back home (Wooster Street, New Haven, CT) where he grew up.  It was absolutely perfect! Thank you for sharing!

I would recomend making sure your pizza pan is covered with a light coat of veggie oil to make sure the dough doesnt stick!

This was a quick and easy recipe. I did let the dough rise for about 30 minutes and used olive oil. I will double the recipe next time to make garlic knots, a calzone or stromboli. Thanks for a great recipe!

Easy.  I do set the yeast first.  Tried it both ways and it just turned out better if you let the yeast set.

Brilliant! This was my first shot at pizza dough (although I've made plenty of breads), so I was a bit nervous, especially since this didn't call for any proofing or rising. I'll admit that I deviated from the recipe by proofing the yeast first in the warm water and sugar, but it was still super easy and it came out great. Next time I'm going to add some herbs to the dough.

This was super easy to make. The next time we make this, we will be using bread flower rather than all purpose flour. I feel it would be better because of the higher glucose content. We did add italian seasoning to the dough and let it sit on the counter for the yeast to rise for about 20 min.

Love this pizza crust! I had such a hard time finding premade pizza dough and wanted to save money. I found this one and it was so easy! I had never made my own crust before and it turned out perfectly! My family loved it and I will probably never buy pre-made dough again!

EXCELLENT!! TO BEGINNERS - SUUUPER EASY! Loved it! Crispy. Tasty. Next time i'll try with some Italian herbs added to see how i like it but it doesn't need it.  It's wonderful! This was the first time i made a pizza crust from scratch.  I have to work on my technique and i have a great recipe to work with.  Thanks!

I Loved Loved Loved this recipe.  It was delicious and easy.  It does rise a lot in the 30 minute bake time...well that's how long it took me, because I put way too much spaghetti sauce on and it took a while to cook in the center.  When I make it again tonight, I will roll it out thinner and make 2 pizza crusts with it, and of course a little less sauce.  Thanks for sharing it.

Not sure went wrong here but this was kind of flat and flavorless. I followed the directions although I did just cook the dough by itself, no toppings. I wanted to see how it was and I wasn't impressed. I'm curious if I did something wrong because it was edible, but not tasty. Thanks though.

The key to this dough is probably to use instant yeast as opposed to active dry.  Instant yeast DOES NOT need to be proofed first therefore it yields a fabulous last minute dough.  I used it for Stromboli and I couldn't have imagined it being better.  Think and chewy.

This literally take 5 minutes to make.  It's very tasty and very easy.  I'm sure there is a more delicious dough recipe that takes longer, but this is one for us becasue it's so fast and perfect for a weeknight dinner!

I have to say this dough is quite delicious.  I have made it twice in the matter of two days.  I did let it rise for about 15 minutes, just while I got the sauce and other goodies ready, but I know it would be just as good without rising.  The second pizza I made was with fresh mozzarella and Exquisite Pizza Sauce from AR sprinkled with fresh basil...absolutely the best!  Thanks Gudny for a fast and delicious recipe!

I used this recipe for homemade pizza on the BBQ. (You just oil one side of the dough, put it right on the BBQ rack, let it puff and brown on the bottom, flip it over and add your toppings and cook until desired crispiness - so tasty!) It turned out great! It's a simple, easy recipe that tastes great - perfect for a quick meal or snack.

I used this dough base for a homemade pizza party- and it was a huge success!  I really appreciate the versatility and "quick 'n easy" factor of the mix (particularly the latter since I prepped and cooked four different kinds of pizza in half an hour!).  I added in extra flavors, like parmesean cheese and basil, to really amp up the flavor.  Those at the party were impressed with the texture, and this recipe has become a permanent resident of my recipe collection.

This was very simple and tasted pretty good, I did add Italian seasoning and mediterranean seasoning to the dough and I had to add a bit more flour because it was too sticky but that was it. And we loved it.

I changed it a bit, using 1.5 C of AP flour and 1.5 C of Whole Wheat flour.  And I just tossed all the ingredients in my bread maker.  Great Dough!  Nice and stretchy, and smells wonderful baking!  My family loved the calzones I made using this dough!

This is a perfect recipe for me!  We do our own pizzas every Friday night and I have been looking for a good no-rise recipe that also is great grilled.  This one did not disappoint.  One batch yeilded 2 12" pizzas.  I love that the dough is easy to work with/shape (ie, not sticky and holds its shape).  I used 2 c white and 1 c whole wheat flour and proofed the yeast first, just because we like a crispier crust.  This is now my go-to recipe every Friday night!

Very quick, very simple & very good.   I added a bit more flour because I was out of cornmeal to keep it from sticking.  Fast and perfect!

This was a great recipe.  Yes I agree that it could be improved upon with olive oil, herbs and rising.  The point of the recipe was quick and EASY.  That is what it is.  My family ate up every piece.  I used a Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce,bacon,chicken,red onion,jack,garlic salt grinder, olives.  It was really good.  I baked at 425* on a lower rack to toast the crust like I do all my pizzas.  This is definately a repeat family favorite!!!!  Thanks

This was great! I love it. I like a thick crust so I used the water, sugar and yeast and proofed it before following the rest of the directions. Once again very good thank you very much! ^_^

This is verhy simple to make.  The dough was a bit too thick for us.  I added the salt and yeast to warm water before adding to the dry ingredients.  I kneaded for 1/2 hour and let it rise for one hour before rolling.  I would make it again.

We gave this a whirl when we wanted pizza last minute, but didn't want to spend the $30 on it. I had all the ingredients already, so we tried this and it was fantastic! I did follow some of the 'additions' (garlic, a bit of italian seasoning), and swapped the veggie oil with canola oil. I also gave it some time to rise while the rest of what we were going to put on the pizza was being prepared. We're making it again tonight! It was fantastic the first time and I'm really excited about tonight's dinner too!

Very good.  Easy to make and to work with.   Took another suggestion and proofed the yeast mixture first, 15 min.  Rubbed the dough with olive oil and let rise for 15 min.  Cut dough in half for 2 crusts.  Then stretched out with hands.  Olive oil helped alot.  I also added some honey, just a few drizzles, after I mixed the yeast and flour together. Seemed to be more workable.  i agree with others.....no need to order out!   Yum Yum...

This recipe is too easy.  I have four boys and a husdand with a huge appetites when I make pizza I have to make 5 at a time.  I double the recipe three times when I have pizza night.  I also make individual deep dish pizza's that I bake then freeze so the guys can take one or two out and nuke for a quick lunch. We have this at least once a week, the kids just love it and with homemade sauce it feeds a family of six very inexpensively and tastes great.

My step daughter was having a sleepover (8 11 yo girls) and for dinner we were making individual pizzas. Trader Joe's was out of dough.  I came home stressed because I never made my own pizza dough.  Ran across this recipe and voila, an easy delicious dough that makes a flaky yet chewy crust.  I  usually go through the reviews with a fine tooth comb but the only change I made was subbing olive  oil for veg oil.   In the end, it was much less expensive and tasted better than the Trader Joe's dough. Thank you Gudny

My family is sold on this recipe, the only one I make now!! This dough is so easy!!!! Just as quick as delivery pizza, but soo much more tastier since we know exactly what is going on it and who has been touching it! Amazing home-made pizza in less than an hour!! I double the recipe and get three pizzas out of it. I also have added a little dried oregano and garlic powder to the dough on occasion and sprinkled on parmesan for breadsticks to go with Lasagna and spaghetti.  This recipe ROCKS!!!!!!!!!

this recipe results in a gorgeous, silky dough when the yeast is proofed, dough kneaded for 10 mins. and allowed to rise for an hour. i would've made it without allowing it to rise but the hubby was skeptical. i made a chicken alfredo pizza with it tonight and it's yummy! instead of red sauce i used alfredo sauce, some grilled chicken and cheeses.

Really easy to make !!! I too let the yeast puff up in water with sugar, and then added it to the flour. Let the dough rise twice about 20 minutes and 15 minutes. Simply the best!! Thank you

Awesome easy dough. I used this with the Pepperoni Stromboli recipe and it worked out great. Very versatile.

This dough recipe is delicious and very easy to make. It works really well for making homemade "hot pockets" and filled braided breads. I mixed it in my bread machine on the dough setting so I didn't have to mess with it until I was ready to throw my pizza together.

I've made this dough twice now- the first time it was FANTASTIC. Super easy, fast and delicious. Put any chain pizza to shame. The second time, I gave it to my boyfriend to make... And quickly learned to watch how much flour is put in. Be sure to not just scoop the flour out, spoon it into the measuring cup; otherwise, the dough with be impossible to work with. Still, delicious! I added some Italian seasoning to the dry and it turned out really well.

This is a great recipe IF you can muster up the patience to let it rise for 15 minutes before topping/baking. Not waiting at all will result in a flat, dense crust. Still beats traditional recipes' waiting times, though.

Easy and very good as is.  I can get a nice pizza night done quickly and crazy cheap.  I do let it rest for a few minutes (use this time to prep any toppings) before rolling out to a thin crust.  I use a stone in my oven and I increase the oven temp to 400+.

After reading much of the rise/don't rise debate--I decided to let mine rise since I like softer dough. Warm water, sugar, 2 tsp. of yeast for 15 minutes was absolutely sufficient. But the point is the proportions and measurements are PERFECT as is--whether you raise it or not. Other things that went into the dough: subbed in olive oil, grated parmesan, chopped red onion, garlic, basil, rosemary and thyme (ALL INGREDIENTS FRESH). I, like others, cooked it for 5 minutes before adding toppings. If you're worried about the dough being too crispy, put some oil on the outter crust just before you throw it into the oven. It keeps it somewhat softer and is less likely to burn. But hands down, best dough I have had in a long, long while. While eating the pizza I found that the crust (for once) was actually my favorite part.  Lesson: it was good when I raised it, but I think either way porportions are perfect. LOVED IT.

The flavour was good but it didn't rise very much.  The second time we tried to let it rise, but it was too dry and had too be corrected.

This was my first time making any kind of dough or bread with yeast & I made the recipe exactly as stated, with King Arthur unbleached all purpose flour and olive oil.  I didn't know how much the dough would rise in the oven, & I didn't want a thin crust, so I used the smaller of our two pizza pans, almost 13 inches across.  The pizza baked for 25 minutes & the toppings were cooked perfectly (cheese just a bit brown) and the dough had puffed up so that it was nice and fluffy, but the dough was not cooked all the way through.  I think that either I would have to spread the dough thinner (or use a larger pan), or else I would need to let it rise for a little while before baking. I wonder if I could use quick rise yeast. Also I thought that the dough did not have much flavor so next time I will add some spices etc.  Otherwise I think that this is great - very simple & relatively quick!  Update 5/25/09:  I made this recipe again a couple days ago and I found out what my problem was.  The water I was putting in was too hot and was killing the yeast, that's why the dough was too dense and not cooking all the way through.  I put in "lukewarm" water this time and it was perfect.  The dough was soft and plyable and rose to be very fluffy!  I used the fast acting yeast and set the dough aside while I prepared my toppings, then rolled it out to size and left extra at the edge for a thick crust.  I added herbs and garlic, too.  It was great!  I'm adjusting my rating to 5 stars.

This recipe is perfect as is!  My wife and kids went to Grandpa's and my poker buddies and I outplayed the local pizza shop - needless to say, we needed something easy and FAST!!  No time to be creative, so we did it exactly as called for and it fed 5 "big boys".  I think it is better than anything offered by the national chains - not better than my local favorite pizzeria, but nobody would expect that!

This was a good recipe. It wasn't the best crust I've ever eaten, but for the amount of time and the ease of making it without having to let it rise, I'm giving it five stars. Next time I will try and roll it out with a rolling pin and make sure it's thin. When I made it, it was kind of thick,(thicker than hand-tossed pizza crust). But it was really soft and moist!

I've made this a few times in a pinch, and when I need to empty my fridge. I add 1tsp garlic powder, 1tsp Italian seasoning. I use a foil-lined sprayed pan, and after gently stretching the dough out in my hands, spread the dough more in the pan. I find it's easier to make a few "personal" sized pizzas. I cook for 6min then add toppings before cooking the rest of the way.  They aren't the prettiest pizzas, but you can't beat quick, easy, fresh, dirt cheap pizza!

I admit I used olive oil and not vegetable oil, and since I didn't have enough all purpose flour for the 2 batches I was making I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour in each batch with 1 cup of all purpose.  I ended up only using one batch of dough for pizza anyways, and it's all gone already.  It turned out very nicely.  So I'll be keeping this recipe.  As for the other batch of dough.. I ended up baking it for about 25 minutes in the bread machine since it was in there already for mixing.  It's an absolutely wonderful, although somewhat dense, loaf of bread.  It's not overly dry on the outside which has been a major problem in the 2 weeks since I started using my bread maker.  Thank you for this recipe, and the unexpected loaf of bread I got from it.  :D

Very good and quick.  I did let it rise an hour and it is definitely dense.  Maybe next time I won't let it rise or decrease flour to get it a bit thinner.  I used Easy Alfredo Sauce I from this site to make a white cheese pizza.

Ive made this recipe twice now.  The first time I did not like it, it was too dense and dry, and I followed the directions exactly by just mixing it in a bowl and not kneading it.  The second time I kneaded it and it turned out a lot better.  I had a little extra time also to let it rise a few min before I spread it out.  So Im sure the rising time helped a little also the second time around.  I only added 2 1/2 cups at first, then kneaded about another 1/4 cup in and it was perfect.  Overall I give it 4 stars.  I made this with calzones the second time, but the crust was too flat to use for them.  But it would of make a great pizza crust.  I will surely go to this recipe again when I need a pizza crust to whip up real fast.  I just know now to make sure to knead it a little and not to add the full 3 cups of flour in unless it needs it.  Thanks for the recipe!

For the way it is written, it is an excellent dough on nights I don't have time to wait for dough to rise. If you use a lot of toppings/extra cheese or you don't like your cheese brown, then pre-baking the crust is the best way. I've mixed in Italian seasoning, crushed garlic and finely chopped roasted red peppers and has always turned out perfect. I can be done eating and doing dishes by the time delivery would be there and cost doesn't even compare.

While this definetly was easy it was just a little too dense for me. Next time I think I'll try substituting bread flour and see if that results in a chewier and lighter crust. Either way, the fact that I made pizza dough in less than five minutes w/o having to knead rocks!

Not the best crust, but definitely better than already made crusts. Quick and easy. Perfect for nights that I didn't plan to make pizza.

I like this recipe for thin crust.  A word of caution though--I tried to make it with 1/3 whole wheat flour and it was terrible.  Stick to the original with this one!

This was so good and easy!  The only thing I did was add 1 t. basil and 1 t. garlic powder.  I also baked the crust for 5 minutes before putting the toppings on.  I'm usually not a crust eater, but this crust was wonderful.  I can't wait to make it again.

You must proof yeast and let your dough rise if you expect a decent pizza crust. This dough is okay if you are in a hurry, but you will be dissapointed in the quality and texture of the final product.

Put corn meal under crust.  Cook crust alone 5 minutes(?) first so it's not so doughy.

I was very disappointed in this dough--it was extremely sticky, tore like crazy and  was very difficult to stretch out.  I don't roll out my doughs in a pan, I hand work them in a circle, almost tossing them, and I've gotten pretty good with that system. However, this dough was so difficult and kept tearing. It eventually had to be rolled out on a cookie sheet w/ a rolling pin. Very disappointing. Will give it one more shot before abandoning recipe.

I've had a bakery for many years.  We think this is a simple, delicious recipe. It always works. As in all cooking, the key is fresh ingredients: good flour, good yeast, clean water.  Keep it simple and fresh.  Treat your dough with respect.  Good recipe!

Good recipe!  Replaced the white flour with wheat flour for a slightly healthier crust.  Also wrapped mozzarella sticks cut in half into the outer edge for a stuffed crust taste.

I followed this recipe as is, without modifying and it turned out bland and doughey. It does need a lot of work. What really ruined it for me was the cook time. The pizza dough, by itself, no toppings, needs to be cooked alone for 5-10 minutes first, before the toppings are added. And I even rolled it out fairly thin. How exciting it was to try this and then utterly disappointing when it didn't turn out.

Great quick recipe!  I used 1 cup of wheat flour and 2 cups of regular.  It was very tasty and my 2 year old loved it!  I do recommend spraying your pizza pan a bit so that it wont stick.

This pizza dough was wonderful!  I used 2 Tbsp Olive Oil instead of vegetable, and the flavor of this crust was delicious!  It was so easy!  I mixed the ingredients together in a bowl for about 5 minutes by hand, then kneaded for about another 5.  I let the dough rest for 10 minutes under a clean towel, and proceeded to shape it.  Yum!  Thanks for such a wonderful, easy recipe!

After making this a few times, I have a little input.

After making this with Bread Flour, instead of all purpose, and letting it rise for 30 minutes, the dough produced was a very chewy, airy, pizza dough.

Making it with All Purpose flour, and letting it rest for 10 minutes, resulted in a crispy thin crust.

Both were delicious!

I used with the "exquisite pizza sauce" recipe found on here.

I saved this recipe once when out of town and couldn't get to my usual pizza dough recipe. Now I use this recipe exclusively. We like to roll out our dough very, very thin and this crust gets nice and crispy without getting soggy.

Wonderful!  After using this recipe, I will NEVER buy pre-packaged dough again.  I made 2 thin-crust pizzas (12 inch) out of the recipe.  Even with plenty of toppings, the crust was still crispy and delicious!

I let the dough rise just a bit (20 minutes), halved it, rolled out two thin pizza crusts, and then pressed them into my pans.  The dough was EXTREMELY easy to work with and took no time at all.  I put it in the oven for 5 minutes before adding toppings.  The pizza on the bottom rack was crispier...so if only making one, put it on the bottom rack.  :-)  

Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This recipe for Pizza Dough is quite good. Tip for users, this dough usually turns out crisp and crunchy and is not your average pan pizza type of dough. To get it really crunchy, dont wait for the yeast to set. Overall, a very satisfying recipe.

It's ok. The first time I did it, I followed the instructions precisely. It didn't turn out well. Edible, but too thick and doughy. 

2nd time I followed other reviewer's suggestion to add 2.5 cups of flour only, but this time it was still very hard. So I added 1/4 additional warm water. 

This made the dough less tough and easier to spread, though slightly sticky. This was solved by flouring my hands and spreading the dough out over the pan. Doing it this way caused the dough not to shrivel up and it stayed put while topping it and cooking it. 

Will make again. It's the best I've found yet.

I just made this as the dough for a Stromboli. I used EVOO for the oil, added 1 tsp. dried basil and 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, and it turned out really well. I used to use frozen dough, but this was so easy and tasty that I think it will become a permanent part of the Stromboli recipe!

Very good pizza dough! I rolled it out into individual circles, sprinkled half of them with sauce and cheese. I Folded over half the dough and pinched it closed. I baked it in a 500 degree oven for about 10-15 minutes.

Very good, quick and easy.  I was surprised how well this came out with so little prep time needed.  This will become a mainstay for future pizza nights.

This is the easiest successful pizza recipe I have found.  Very quick to make, not much more time than it would take to open the package of a store-bought crust!  I bake for 14 minutes in my convection oven and it comes out perfect every time!  This recipe makes 2 thick crust pizzas in my pans.

This is the best pizza dough recipe I have ever had...no more take out. I make it exactly as the recipe says except I add 1 tsp granulated garlic and use olive oil. My family begs for pizza night. 
I make 2 batches in the bread machine on the pizza dough setting and let the first one rise a little while the second is mixing. I found that the bottom of a springform pan works great for personal kid size pizzas. They can put anything they want on their own pizza.

I don't know if I did something wrong, but I made this recipe twice in a row (for the same dinner) and the dough was dry and wouldn't stretch out over my pizza pan.  I mixed the dough with a fork and then by hand, since it didn't say to use a mixer.

if this recipe could have 10 stars, it would not be enough! this is, by far, the BEST pizza dough recipe i have ever come across. SO forgiving! i did toss it in the bread maker and allowed rising time. i also did prebake the crust about 15 minutes at 350. just a tip, try brushing the prebaked crust with melted butter. it give the pizza a flakey golden crust. it is much more attactive. you can also brush in garlic and dried herbs. i doubled the recipe, used half for pizza and made bread sticks and "cinnastix" with the rest. all very delicious, no left overs! TRY THIS RECIPE!!!!

The pizza dough was fairly easy to make.  i slowly added the water and oil (like one would do for any other kind of dough). however, i had troubles baking. the dough would still be white, and my cheese and the verge of burning. i suppose next time, i will pre bake the dough for 10-15 minutes and then add on the toppings. other than that, everything was super.

This recipe was fast, easy and delicious. We were eating faster than we could of been if we had it delivered! We added some Tastefully Simple seasonings to the crust to make it even tastier. We will make this again for sure.

This was alright. It's just a quick pizza dough. I think if you have the time, you should definately use a recipe in which you can let the dough rise. Otherwise, this is a great recipe in a quick fix...and you probably have all the ingrediants in your cupboard.

This was OK for a quick crust. I was expecting more considering the 4+ star rating.  I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and added some italian seasoning as suggested by others.  Still not what I was hoping for, but again, good for a quick meal. I will keep searching.

Not my favorite dough recipe, but I REALLY like that it was quick.  

I rolled the dough in a 13x9 inch pan and it worked out great!  Not too thick, not too thin.  Just perfect.

This recipe is pretty good for what it is: a quick, no rise pizza crust.  In a pinch I'd use it again, but not for a pizza I was planning ahead for.  For that I'd use a 'regular' style pizza dough to get an airy, puffy crust.  This crust was pretty flat and solid and got quite hard on the edges.  However, I gave it 4 stars because I actually didn't expect it to be as good as it turned out to be.  Thanks for posting!

I feel that the proportions were off since the initial mix didn't have enough water.  As I added in extra it got better, but the consistency and taste were still off.

Definitely quick, but not too tasty.

This recipe is okay.  It tastes pretty much like a quick bread rather than a yeast bread.  I added garlic powder and italian seasoning.  Also, I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour to replace 1 cup of all purpose flour.

For a really Quick pizza, I would recomend this.  For a really Good pizza,  I think I will look again.

super quick & easy & tasted great! we used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and added a little garlic powder to the mixture & it turned out perfect.  the kids really liked making our own pizza dough & we doubled the recipe to have enough for everyone to make their own "personal" pizza.

Not fab but good in a pinch.  I'm used to making 24-hr pizza dough(which is the best, in my opinion, because the fermentation makes for an outstanding flavored pizza crust) but today when my two kids each had a friend over I wanted to throw together a quick lunch that they all would like.  They did, but I thought it was chewy despite my having rolled it very thin.  I know my yeast is good because it's fairly new and I keep it in the freezer.  I bake artisan loaves all the time and my yeast works fine in them.  I baked the pizzas on my stone and both browned on the bottoms but the edges of tops were pale even after the cheese had browned.  I don't think I'll make this again; I'll just plan ahead and use my 24-hr recipe.  The kids'll just have to have peanut butter and jelly next time...

where i live (the southwest; dry climate, high altitude) you have to proof the yeast and you have to double or triple the yeast in every recipe.

we also have to let the dough rise.

those things are absolutely necessary if you live in a climate like mine.

i tried this recipe anyway, just to see if it had some magical power that might work, and it tasted like a cracker.  very hard and crunchy.  

i wish it did work though, cause it seems so easy.

This was a very good very basic pizza dough recipe.  I use this when I don't have time to make a dough that needs to rise.  In all honesty it tastes almost as good as the more involved pizza dough recipe that I usually use.  I added oregano, basil and fresh minced garlic to give it a little more flavor and it was delicious.  Thanks for a very good quick and easy recipe!

This recipe is SO easy to make, I love it. It's fine as is, but I love to add a heaping amount of garlic powder to it. It gives the pizza a very nice flavor. Tastes good with regular sauce as well as BBQ sauce (try it!). And you can't beat how quick it is. From start to finish, including time taken to wash, cut, and saute some veggies as well as shredding my fresh mozzarella, it took less than 80 minutes. So good, I'm about to make some right now!

Okay, I was looking for cheap, easy pizza dough and this is perfect... It's just like school pizza! My almost four year old daughter (who has autism) helped me make the pizza and dough from start to finish, and she is eating lots of the pizza! Made a 9-13 inch pizza. Very simple, quick and tasty! Thanks! Will make again and again!

I gave it two stars because it was edible and it was easy, but it really was dense, thick, and boring.  I rolled it out to about 1/6th of an inch and poked holes in the dough with a fork, and still it was thick and dense.  I would not make this again.  I think this would be a good crust for anyone who likes thick crusts.

If you're looking for a dough that is like a good restaurant's hand tossed style crust, this is it.  This is the only kind of crust I use for pizzas anymore.  I don't do frozen pizzas anymore thanks to this dough!

This is an amazing recipe for a pizza crust.  I followed some other users ideas and replaced the veg. oil with olive oil and added 1 tsp. garlic powder and 1 tsp. basil to the dough.  I think I will leave out the basil next time though since it was a little overpowering.  The consistency was great after baking on a pizza stone.  I also let it rise for 1/2 hour under a hot damp towel following the mixing of all the ingredients.

Great recipe.

This is an excellent recipe. I use it to make pretzels all the time. I recently added bits of chopped jalapeños to the recipe and it was amazing !!

I consider myself a good cook with a general knowledge of baking.  I've tried this twice.  It just didn't work for me.  It was flat, hard, bland (although a bit sweet), and just not good each time.  It was a lot like a frozen pizza.  Taking time with pizza dough is worth the effort.  I give it a two because it wasn't inedible and because I recognize that it is possible that I just missed something.

This dough is simply delicious and excellent.  I am one for flavor and it hit all the right buds.  I have recommended it to quite a number of friends and they stated the same thing.  It is quick, easy and the ingredient measurements can easily be adjusted depending on the type of crust you enjoy eating.

This was so easy to make. I shy away from doughs because while they are probably easy to do I haven't made them enough to feel comfortable with it. But I needed pizza dough and I came across this recipe. I will definitly keep this around for future use.

This recipe was indeed very easy and fast. The flavor is good, but the texture was disappointing. It did not have the elasticity of a normal dough, but rather, was reminiscent of using biscuit dough for a pizza.  I had hoped to cook the pizza on the grill, but it did not seem to have enough body to allow for that.  I live at 7,000 feet elevation which may have contributed to the problem.  I will be looking for a different recipe.

I subtituted 1 1/4 cups water and olive oil rather than veg oil like others had suggested. Overall it was a good crust! I make my pizzas on the bbq and this turned out crusty on the outside soft on the inside, a good combo.

This is my favorite pizza dough recipe.  I actually just throw it all together in my bread machine on the dough cycle and let it do the kneading and rising in there.  I use Olive oil instead of Vegetable oil, but other than that, I do everything else exactly as is.

SOOOOOOO EASY!!!! I used this recipe exactly as is, and it came out great! this was my first time using yeast, so I was nervous, but even my picky husband loved this one. We are from NY and are hard to please. With 5 hungry people, it was quick, easy and tasty. Definately a keeper.

This is an easy, delicious recipe. Perfect when trying to make a quick meal. Of course if you have more time, I would suggest letting the dough rise for 30 minutes to an hour, but you definitely do not need to. I added some italian seasonings to the dough and substituted olive oil for vegetable.

Very convenient, this is definitely going to be our fall-back on Friday nights rather than calling Domino's!  Needs some flavor...next time will try adding rosemary, oregano, basil, maybe even some sauteed minced garlic or parmesan to the dough.

Really fabulous! This recipe makes a truly quick and delicious pizza dough; my husband went especially crazy for it and is now excited to make it himself. I added some dried basil to the dough and used quick rising yeast. Since I had some time (10 minutes) while chopping the veggies for the pizza, I let the dough ball sit in a cloth-covered bowl to rise a bit; it puffed up beautifully. Because I didn't have a pizza pan, I just patted out the dough evenly into a well-oiled (olive oil) 9x13 glass baking pan, and it came out so fluffy and delicious, with a slightly crunchy bottom and sides. Thanks!

Fast quick easy recipe. Taste great. I have made it several times. One time I halved the recipe and made a thin crust. I have also tried adding herbs and parmesen the the dough before I cooked it. It always comes out great!

This was very good, quick and easy. I added fresh chives and garlic to the dough, used olive oil in place of vegetable oil.

This would also make a good crust for breakfast pizza.

Great recipe if you are in a hurry to get something on the table.  I had to add 2 more tbsp of water to the dough b/c it was bit too dry. 

If you want a real yeasty crust and have time to let it rise, then you should try another recipe.

No rising, no punching, quick and easy for when you need quick and easy dough! Five stars for the simplicity and no hassel of this dough. It's not gourmet but we don't always have time for that.

I followed the recipe to a "T"  and I think I will keep looking. First, the dough was extremely sticky and wet. I made 2 pizzas with this. One was very thin and it turned out pretty good. The other one was thicker and was horrible. It was the consistency of a biscuit. So, keep the dough rolled out on the thinner side!

I am shocked by how well this turned out!  I proofed my yeast/sugar/water before adding the other ingredients, kneaded in the KitchenAid on medium for about 5 minutes, kneaded by hand to smooth out, let rise for 30 minutes, pressed out into a round pizza crust, and let rise for another 15 minutes.  We pre-baked it on a pizza stone in the grill, but later found that it really didn't need it.  The flavor was fantastic without any additions - quite a surprise!  This is definitely a keeper in our house!  Thank you!!!

I used this recipe tonight.  I made a pizza last week using my bread machine's recipe.  It was ok, but not great, so I came to allrecipes to find a better one.
I made this dough in my bread machine, which took about an hour.  It came out great.  Elastic, but malleable and not tough.

I will re-use it for certain.

This was my first time making this dough.  I do love it, but suggest a few small changes.  Next time I make this, I will add seasonings to the dough, I reccomend others do the same.  I also took the time to dissolve the yeast, allowed for the dough to rise, and took the time to knead it.  If you prefer a light, bread-like dough....kneading and rise time are key.

Could use more salt.  For those of us that buy yeast by the jar, 1 tsp does the trick.

This is a great recipe... All I would say for a change is that letting the dough sit for about a half hour before spreading on the pan is key. I always add cheese or spices to suit whatever flavor pizza I'm making.

The recipe was good,  I prefer the basil and added garlic, I do agree that you need to slghtly decrease the flour. next time ill make sure to add a little olive oil on the crust. But all and all the recipe was very tasty.  thank you for everything.

This was excellent mainly due to the speed.  I made two large pizzas for 6 people in about 15 minutes!  Saved about 20 dollars and had a happy clan!

I have tried this recipe twice.  I did let it rise for about 1 hr both times.  In the mean time I got all the toppings ready to add to the pizza.  The first time I used the whole dough to make one pizza.  The second time I actually divided the dough into 2 parts and made to two pizza's.  This gave me a crisper shell, which I liked better.  I will definably make this again.

So easy and absolutely wonderful! My family loves it. I've made it once a week ever since I found the recipe. We've stopped ordering out and I feel so good about giving the family something homemade! Two extra things I do- I add pizza spices to the flour and mix it right into the dough. I also cook the undressed crusts for 5 minutes, then top them and pop them back into the oven. This doesn't take away from the ease of the recipe, which by the way, is very appreciated by this busy mum! Delicioso!!!

This is a great dough, if for no other reason than that it's super easy, and you can make it into ANYTHING. There are only two in my family, so 1/2 of this dough is more than enough for a pizza for us. I usually mix the dough, and then let it rise while I cook whatever meat will be included on the pizza, or prepare the veggies. I bake at 375 for about 10 minutes and then add toppings. I've also used this to make delicious breat bites with cheese centers, as well as pretzels. Add garlic or just about any spices to this dough to change the flavor to suit.

By far the easiest and best dough i've made. I tried an experiment and made it both ways (letting it rise for a half hour, and not letting it rise). While I preferred a lighter dough that had risen for a half hour, my boyfriend preferred a more dense dough that was used immediately after mixing it. Definitely cook the dough a little bit before topping... and might i suggest putting aome ham, pineapple, green pepper and onion on there ? :)

Oh. I mixed fresh basil and parmesan into my dough. It was great.

I've used this one twice and it is pretty good!  I cook for three people so I double the recipe to have enough.  Also I let it rise in a warm location in a bowl with a damp cloth covering the bowl.  After it has risen I work the dough before I divide it into two pans (which I spay lightly with olive oil spray, for a low cal option)... works very well and taste great!

I have to give this only one star based on the directions.  This dough absolutely needs time to rise.  Crust came out very thin and crunchy, which is fine if that is what you are after, but the title or recipe should indicate that.

This is my new favorite pizza dough!  I followed other reviewers advice and used garlic infused olive oil instead of veg oil, I added italian seasoning to the dough and I too let it rise for 20 minutes after putting in my stoneware pan.  I also baked the dough for 10 minutes (stoneware needs a little longer)before I added my toppings.  YUMMY!!!

This was a very quick and easy recipe. However, this is not my favorite kind of pizza dough. Mine came out fairly dense. I'll stick to recipes that allow time for the yeast to rise in the future. Not a bad recipe for a quick pizza though.

A great dough for home-made pizzas. The only big variation I would suggest is to just let it rise for about an hour and then use it. I tossed in a bit of basil into the dough and it gave it just a pinch of flavor, but I don't think the basil was even necessary. It's a good dough.

Edit: I cannot get this to come out the same way twice. Some times it'll be too sticky, Some times it'll be too powdery, Some times it won't spread, and other times it's like an oil slick. I've since abandoned this recipe and started buying the Jiffy brand packs. They cost 40 cents, they only need water, and they are consistent. We actually think the Jiffy packages are close to restaurant quality. Much less fuss and I know what I'm going to get out of it every single time so it's far less stressful.

This was my first time making my own pizza dough.  This recipe was quick, simple and definitely delicious!  I baked it in a quiche pan and had a nice thick crust pizza.  I don't plan on buying pizza dough again.  My pizza was a hit!

This dough is really easy. My kids loved it. I needed something quick and easy for dinner tonight. This fit the bill. I made 2 batches. The first I followed exactly. The second I used 1/2 cup less flour and added a bit of pizza seasonings. Both turned out great. I will definitely use this all the time. Even the kids can help make it.

Great recipe! I made this for the Sunday football game. Went over really well. It was pretty bready, which I don't like, but it was actaully liked it this time. I made two, both times I desolved the yeast in the water first. I also added garlic and basil like someone else suggested. On the first one  I let the dough rise for 30 min. The second one I didn't. I think it taste better when you let it rise, but the dough is easier to work with when you don't. Great receipe!

This pizza dough made the perfect crust.  We made one pizza following the recipe and another using half wheat flour and half bread flour.  They both turned out great.  The wheat version doesn't rise quite as much, but still tastes great.

Tasted really good, and didn't make any changes other than prepping the yeast in the warm water and sugar before adding the rest of ingrediants and kneading for about 5 minutes. Really easy! UPDATE: I've been using this recipe for almost a year now and it's fantastic. I still prep the yeast, just because I can't imagine not preping yeast, but that doesn't take away from how easy this recipe is, and it really does tastes great. You can add any herbs you want to it to make it more flavorful but it's great as written too. It always rises really well in the oven and is a nice thick crust, so if you're looking for a thin pizza dough, well, I'd look elsewhere. Otherwise, you'll never need another pizza dough recipe.

Nice flavor on this fast and easy crust. This turned out a firm crust, not too thick, not thin at all. Crispy and crunchy when I cooked this on a perforated pizza pan on the lowest oven rack for 16 minutes at 425 degrees F. This is very very fast and has a nice flavor so overall, it's a great recipe for what it is. The only sub I made was olive oil instead of veg oil. Thanks Gudny, this was great.

I added some Italian season to this and let it rise for about 40 minutes. It was SO good. I have also made it without letting it rise and it was a lot tougher crust. It was amazing when I let it rise. I have also substituted in whole wheat flour, brown sugar and olive oil and it turned out very nice when allowed to rise.

This was easy and good! We like thin crust, so I used about 2/3 of the dough. I used a baking stone and the crust turned out delicious. Like some of the other reviewers, I baked the crust for 6 minutes first, then put the toppings on and baked for an additional 15 minutes.

So great! I used 1c flour & 1 & 1/2 c. of wheat flour, and honey instead of sugar and it was so fast and easy and delicious!

This was a really good pizza dough recipe that can be made quickly.  However, I had some problems cooking it, next time I'll probably put it in the oven to bake for 5 minutes before I put the toppings on.  I'll definitely use this recipe again.

Very pleased with this recipe. I halved the ingredients because I like thin crust and it was just enough to stretch across a cookie sheet. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I added minced garlic into the dough then let it rise for about 30 minutes. After that I kneaded it a bit, working the garlic through, then let it rise again for another 15 minutes or so. Came out great, nice crispy and flavorful crust just the way I like it.

I really thought this was easy.  I added basil, oregano and garlic powder to my crust for flavor.  I also put it on the lower rack for the 10 minutes, then moved it up to the upper rack for the last 10 minutes. My kids loved it, even my picky eater who doesn't care much for pizza!

I had to try this recipe with all the input from the other review, I put fresh garlic and herbs with the dough and made garlic twisty breads too. And sprinkled parmasen cheese on top to bake. Was good. Next time I must add more herbs to make the tastes stronger

Chewy and yummy!  It works especially well if you actually remember the yeast! (Fancy that!).  I added fresh rosemary from the garden and it was wonderful.  The kids all ate it (which is really a miracle around here!).   Will definately make it again!  Thank you very much!

I baked it for 10 min. on it's own before adding toppings, then baked another 10 minutes.

Did what others recommended and let the dough sit for 30 minutes before lightly kneading it. Didn't put in any extra ingredients -- my toppings were enough. Yuuum!

This pizza dough was OK. It was very simple and fast to make, great for when you want pizza on a whim. I spread mine out on a nonstick rectangle cookie sheet and it fit perfectly and came out as a medium-thick crust. I dissolved the water, sugar and yeast for a few minutes before adding to flour, then I baked the crust for 6 minutes before adding toppings. I gave it 5 stars because it definitely worked out as a quick and worthy crust, but it is pretty plain, so I would add herbs and brush with garlic & oil next time.

My husband and I love this recipe.  Quick and easy.  I reduced the amount of flour by about 1/2 cup, and I put the dough in the oven while the oven is warming up.  It's wonderful and fast.  Update:  I recently made this dough into quick rolls.  Just brushed the tops with some oil.  Great!

This was my very first pizza dough from scratch.  I was quite impressed with the result.  I followed other reviewers suggestions to use olive oil, a little less flour, and herbs, etc. for taste.  In very little time we had a pizza that was definitely as good as regular frozen pizza.  I need to experiment with a few others before I can crown this one "5 star."

The pizza dough recipe was very fast and very easy. The only thing I did not like was the yeast taste. I think not letting it rise does that. But myself and my husband both liked it.

This is especially good for when you don't have time to do all that kneading and waiting for it to rise 2 times! The texture was good, crispy on the outside, although I think it could use a bit less flour.

I loved the ease of this recipe, however, I'm not sure what I did wrong because the crust seemed dry and kind of firm once it was cooked.  We ate it anyway because my toppings were yummy and we couldn't resist.  I will definately try this recipe again, but I'm going to try the advice of another reviewer and see if it creates a more softer, moist crust.

This is a great recipe!  I've made it with my kids and even made idividual sized pizzas for slumber parties, which was a big hit!  Thanks for the recipe - my husband compares it to Digiorno Pizzas, very thick and delicious.

This is a great recipe. I add a good ammount of olive oil to the pan before I put the dough in the pan. It tastes like take out. I didn't change a thing.

I consider myself pretty apt and able when it comes to cooking and doing a nice job at it, but for some reason, this recipe just didn't turn out for me. I know some have raved about it, but like a few others, I've found this dough comes out a little tough. It also tends to cook super fast on the outside and not enough on the inside. I have a hard time keeping the bottom from burning. I've used it a couple of times and both haven't been what I was really looking for. It's not bad tasting but I think it could use improvement. I'll probably keep searching for a pizza dough recipe.

This was very good, and very simple, not quite a regular pizza dough but yummy non the less... I made it and put a little butter on top of the crust with some ricotta and moz. cheeses and it turned out really good! Anyone who complains about a simple tasty recipe that is this easy to make is crazy...
 Oh and I didn't think this crust was tough at all, follow the directions and it turns out good!

Excellent for what it is. It takes no time to make. I like a soft crust, so I was careful not to bake it too long. Some of it was a little underdone, but that was my fault.

It was easy enough to make, but the crust ended up being hard.  The end result could have doubled as a frisbee.  I think the recipe needs some tweaking.

I first made this one 5 years ago when I began my quest for the perfect pizza crust.  This one didn't impress me because it's quite dense.  Although I've since found a great dough recipe (the one from the Our Best Bites blog), I still use this one sometimes if I need a really hefty crust to stand up to lots of toppings.  It's great when I make taco pizza which has refried beans and other taco toppings on it.  I have used this recipe for pepperoni pizza and the like when I was in a serious pinch for time but it isn't my favorite for regular pizzas.  One note is that you DO need to bake it before putting on the sauce and toppings.  What I do is grease a cookie sheet, press out the dough, stick it in a cold oven and set the temp to 375 for 15 minutes.  The cold oven helps give the yeast at least a few minutes to think about rising before baking through.

Great pizza dough recipe.  I have tried many.  Good amount of dough.. not skimpy.  Best of all this was the first pizza dough I have made that I actually got the air bubbles in the crust just like the pizza shops.

I've made this recipe twice. The first time I followed reviewers suggestions and cut the flour to 2 1/2 cups and let the dough rise on my pizza stone. It turned out very doughy and raw in the middle. The second time, I followed the recipe exactly. It turned out much better; although I'm not sure I'll quit looking for the perfect pizza dough recipe.

My boyfriend loved it, I'm not quite sure if I like the heavy doughieness of it.  The 2nd time I made it I dissolved the yeast in the warm water, but I still didn't get any rising out of the crust.  Maybe my water was too hot, I'll give it one more try.

This recipe was fairly terrible.  I made the recipe as written, and the dough wouldn't even stick together, it flaked apart.  I added a bit more water and oil, and eventually got it to stick, but it still tasted bad.  I will not make it again.  Sorry....

I have never made pizze dough (or any type of dough for that matter) before.  I decided to try this recipe, and followed some of the other suggestions given by the reviewers.  I added some italian seasonings, garlic powder, and used olive oil.  The crust turned out great, although was a little tough to work with - but that was probably my own fault.  Great recipe!  I will definately make more homemade pizza using this recipe!

I halved the recipe because I wanted to see if it was good as bread sticks. I substituted one third of the all-purpose flour for cake flour. Also added 1/8 tsp dough enhancer for crusty bread. I let the dough rise for 45 mins and then shaped and rolled into an 8x8 brownie pan, that was brushed with Crisco. I took the suggestion of a fellow member to brush the top of the dough with butter and sprinkle with parmesan cheese and garlic salt. The bread came out AWESOME!!!!!! The outside was so crispy [and not dark as my bread usually gets] and the inside was so tender! The texture was surprisingly sooo good - maybe the dough enhancer did that. Next time, I will add garlic powder and oregano to the recipe for a twist.

THIS IS A GREAT RECIPE... I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HOME AT 5PM, MY HUSBAND ACTUALLY STARTED THE  DOUGH BEFORE I GOT HOME. HE LET IT TO RISE AN HOUR BEFORE I ARRIVED HOME. I THAN LAID IT OUT, TOPPED IT, AND BAKED IT. EVEN MY KIDS LOVED THE CRUST.... IT WILL BE A REGULAR DISH NOW IN OUR HOUSE....THANK YOU!

I did as many suggested and used olive oil and let it rise about 30 minutes. I also added garlic, basil and Italian seasoning to the mix. It was wonderful. The kids and husband loved it. I am going to make a flat bread for dinner with the same recipe tonight!Kat in SC

I liked how simple it was, the dough was easy to roll out, not too sticky, but I found it to be very heavy. I will try it again using tips from some of the other reviewers.

Both my husband and I loved it.  It was quick and tasted great.  I love that it is for one pizza crust.  There was not a piece left over.  It was the best!  :)

Great, great pizza dough!  I used 2 cups of flour at first, and added as much as it could be incorporated into the dough.  The only other change was that I added 1 tsp. of garlic powder.  The family likes this better than my usual dough, and the bonus is that it's SO much EASIER!

Wonderful, QUICK, Pizza dough recipe. As a mom of 3 young children, I love the fact that we didn't have to wait around for the dough to rise. Simple, easy to follow recipe that we'll use OFTEN!

This dough is easy to make and I agree with holding out on the last cup of flour, start with 2 cups and add the third as needed to dry out the dough.

The dough was a little dry, but this can easily be remedied by not putting all 3 cups of flour in at once and just adding the last cup or so as necessary.

This is a great no wait pizza crust recipe. Before I found this recipe, it seemed too much of a bother to make pizza unless it was planned in advance. I followed the recipe as is and get pizza in under an hour instead a few hours. To do a thin crust pizza, I split the dough in half for a 13” pan.

I used bread flour for some reason, did make crust a little more chewy, but good flavor and a tremendous improvement over the store bought frozen dough sold at the deli.  Easier to stretch.

Actually for being so simple I was surprised how it turned out. I rolled it out a bit with a rolling pin but used hands as well to stretch in into a 12" pizza pan. Nice and crunchy with good body. I used spelt flour but I think next time I'll mix half spelt and half wheat for better flavor.

I followed  recipe as is. I added herbs with seasonings to enhance flavor to the pizza and the breadsticks. I also made my own pizza sauce  which made it even better. But overall crust recipe is good.

Really good and easy.  I’ve made this twice and I increased (1 1/2 size batch) the second time so I could fill a jelly roll pan sized pizza.  I didn’t need to.  I rolled it out and it looked very thin but  it raised thicker when it cooked and had a tough time getting done.  Do, roll it thin and recommend making two separate pizzas if you need more pizza rather than trying a jelly roll pan!  We heated the stove top center grill and browned the bottom of the middle pieces, they browned nicely!  A good and easy recipe.  Thanks!

I followed the previous reviewer's instructions and activated the yeast for 10 minutes (until foamy). I also let the dough rise for ~10 minutes. Added garlic powder (LOTS!!) and oregano. My family loved it, will definitely make again!

The dough was easy to put together.  Simple ingredients and cook time was a breeze. 
If you like thin crust crispy pizza this is for you. 
I usually like my dough to rise but in a hurry this recipe is aces. 
Topped it with mozzarella and pepperoni.

I made this with olive oil in place of vegetable, and I proofed the yeast first- added it to the sugar and water and let stand for 10 minutes to make sure my yeast was active. I added 1 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp oregano to the flour and salt, and I used a mixer with a dough hook to pull it together in the mixing bowl and I kneaded it for about 5 minutes on low. The dough was sticky & I oiled the bowl and let it rise in a warm place for about 30

Very easy recipe! The only problem I had with it was getting it out of the bowl onto the pan. It was a bit sticky but that was probably my fault. A little extra flour fixed that.

The pizza turned out great! The dough was fast and easy. It tasted good and rolled out to a nice size. I could've gone even bigger for a thin crust. Kept it on the 3/4" (after baking) and it was tasty. I followed the directions and threw it all in my it in my Kitchenaid. Walked away for 5 minutes with it on setting 2. Tada! Dough ready to roll.

Super easy to prepare!!!   Using a stand mixer, all the dry ingredients, then the oil and water.  I used olive oil. Let the mixer run another 5 mins to knead.  That's it !! Presto speedo !! Makes awesome Calzones too !!

Made it as described. Very happy with it. So easy and the family loved it. Just covered it with spaghetti sauce and topped with mozzarella and put in the oven. I am sure a more complex pizza crust is much better. This is more dense. But when the kids are crying for food, there's no time for pizza crust to rise. With the kitchen-aid mixer, this couldn't be easier, so I will definitely make it again.

Except for the addition of sugar, this is essentially the food processor pizza dough recipe from Fleischmann's Yeast. It's easy and that's exactly what I needed. Thanks for sharing!

There is a difference between traditional active dry yeast and instant active dry yeast. Traditional dry active yeast did not work for me.

I let the dough rest for 30 mins after it comes together.  Then I gently knead it adding flour to my hands and surface ( I use an old cotton pillow case.) until it is smooth and elastic.  Half is put into a Pam sprayed container and frozen.  The only changes were to increase water temp to 115 to 120 degrees and add 1 TBLSP extra water.  This will leave less flour in the bowl.  The temp increase is ok because you are adding the yeast to the flour mixture not the water.  Thanks a lot for the recipe.  We now have pizza every Friday night.  No allergy worries with home made pizza!

I liked the simpleness of this recipe but I did tweek it a bit.
I added the oil,yeast,warm water, and sugar and let it activate for five minutes. Then added it to the flour plus a little extra so it's not as stick. Then let it rise in a warm place for 30mins. After that I split it into even pieces and put in the freezer

I think this recipe was great. I was really craving breadsticks so I decided to whip some up, the problem was I only had an hour. I made this recipe and it satisfied all my breadstick cravings. At first it seemed dense and chewy but when cooked it came out airy and delicious. I did have to add about 1/2 more flour then the recipe said.

Simple and blank slate recipe.  You could add some oregano and garlic to add flavor or keep as is - it's a great recipe for cooking at home.

This recipe is wonderful.  I have made it many times.  It is quick and easy.  This is also good as a hot dog wrap.  Take a partially cooked hot dog, split and wrap. you may also add cheese.  Bake 350 til brown.

Kids loved getting their hands in the dough and to stretch it and shape it up. And it came out great! Made two 12" pizzas and 4 pig-in-a-blanket with full size hot dogs. Kids wanted to eat them before even putting them in the oven. 
Oh, I messed up when reading the ingredients, and I added a spoon of apple cider (I have no idea how, where or why I saw that), but it turned out great even with this. Thanks for sharing! Will definitely make it again.

I have made this several times now. However, I always end up using about 3/4 cup LESS flour. I do preproof the yeast in the water and sugar (because I just don’t trust those little yeast guys to be active and I want to see it first, lol). I have made it and used it immediately as well as let it rise for 40 mins or so one or twice, and even put it in the fridge after the first rising, brought it out, punched it down, let it warm up and rise a bit and then used it. It always comes out perfectly no matter which way I do it. It’s like Superhero Dough, lol. Almost Invincible. I currently have some dental issues so I need things a bit softer (even though I love chewy and crunchy), and this is beautiful, not just as crust, but as buns and cinnamon buns. It’s just how it works for me, so if your dough is too hard, back off on the flour. I think I’ve even managed to memorize the recipe now, because it’s SO simple. My usually impatiently hungry son and I thank you for this great, simple recipe.

I used this recipe to make homemade hot pockets. It was very easy to make and roll out to make the pockets. As it baked it turned a very nice golden brown and it all came out delicious.  I will be using this recipe again, it was perfect. Thank you for sharing.

I'm very happy with this recipe. I divided it by three so I'd be able to make it with one cup of flour. I let the initial dough rest, then mixed with dough hook, then let rise, then halved. The other half has been frozen. In the meantime, I defrosted a little bit of hamburger, cooked with seasonings, including fennel and hot pepper seeds so it would taste like sausage. I heated up my toaster oven, rolled out that piece of dough and placed on baking pan sprinkled with cornmeal,  adding to edges, and let it rest. Made pizza with small amount of canned pizza sauce, the cooked ground beef, cooked red onion, a few canned mushroom pieces, cheddar cheese (what was here), and parmesan. It took about 40 minutes to bake . It was the best pizza that I've ever made. Probably because of parsimony with sauce and lack of grease from beef. As you can guess, this was for one person. Cleanup is easy. The oven pan was lined with tinfoil and sprayed with Pam olive oil spray.  The stand mixer bowl and hok were washed as I went along.

I have made this on more than one occasion.  I use my kitchen aid mixer with the dough hook. It always comes out perfectly.  I don't use all 3 cups of flour.  I just keep adding the last cup a little at a time, till it is a nice ball on my dough hook.  I actually make two pizzas from this one recipe.  (I like a thinner crust)

I made the recipe as directed and I tripled it. I let it rest for about 10 minutes after kneading. I made 2 pies and put the rest in the freezer for next time.  It was sooo good and it came together fast. I will be making this again soon.

I followed the directions to the letter and the crust was not brown on the bottom. It had to bake longer than 25 minutes which made my cheese too brown. Not making this again.

It was good, but the dough was too sticky to use straight from the bowl so I had to knead it a bit more before I could put it on a pan- still much faster than other recipes. It's a similar crust to a gourmet frozen pizza.  I halved the recipe and was able to make two small pizzas. The first I baked for the recommended time and the crust was a little crunchy. The second I took out a couple minutes earlier and it was soft and puffy, but definitely done.

Definitely a quick and easy recipe for those who are pressed for time.  Thank you so much for sharing this!  I was in a real bind today, and was so glad to see this.  I followed the instructions exactly, and the crust came out perfect.  Definitely delicious.  Will definitely use this recipe again and again.  ^_^

I agree with one of the other reviewers here.  Obviously extra steps could have been taken, but then this wouldn't be a quick and easy recipe anymore.  No need for changes.

This is a super easy way to make pizza crust. The only step I changed was to mix the yeast and warm water first and added that last. Thanks!!

I allowed dough to rest in a bowl with olive oil for a half hour.  It came out perfect!  Will be the new go to recipe for pizza dough.

It is  easy and quick which it's supposed to be. The reviews that modify the recipe to point that it's not even close to original always baffle me but to each their own. 

Do yourself a favor and start recipe as is and don't read or put a lot into the reviews that say rest here add this don't do that and change the water to x and rest again. 

Try it as is first you won't be disappointed

I have made this multiple times. SO easy! And SO good! It's good as is, but I've found that adding some italian seasoning with a little more salt really kicks it up a notch.

It's the recipe my mom made.   Dad always thought the best pizza ever was in Biloxi.  Mom tried hard to imitate it for him and she used this recipe.  Years later we found that pizza place and sat as a family to experience this "legendary" pizza.   However, time has a way of romanticizing things and later privately I heard Dad say to Mom, "your pizza is better."    I guarantee this recipe is good!

This is a great recipe!! My whole family loved the way it turned out...Only a couple of changes I made...I made a double batch so as I could freeze the other half, then I added .50 ounces of yeast to 2 cups water and let it set for 20 min. mixed it with 4 tbl. spoons of olive oil, and then mixed it with the dry. Keep in mind, this is a double batch....Also added about 1 tbls. of Oregeno...Then I let the dough rise for 20 min. and prepped it on a floured cutting board. After all the toppings were placed, I brushed the exposed edges of the crust with olive oil and let it bake...Hope someone else will enjoy this.

The only things I did differently was to let the dough rest after mixing. I just flipped the bowl over and let it rest for about 30 minutes.  I pressed out and par baked it at 375 for 10 minutes and then added all my toppings and baked an addition 15 minutes. Delicious!!

Perfect for making pizza in a pinch.  I split the dough in half to make two very thin pizzas.   550 on a pizza stone for 8 minutes.   Yummy

I made this almost exactly as written. The only thing I did was added a tablespoon of Italian seasoning. This was the best and easiest pizza dough recipe I have come across. I will definitely be making this again.

Exactly what I was looking for in a quick, simple pizza crust that cooks evenly and rises nicely in the oven. I used the crust to make a chicken bacon ranch stuffed pizza in a 9x13 pan, (just made the recipe as is and split it in half before rolling out) baked for 35 minutes at 350 and the crust was perfectly done in the middle (which is hard to get with stuffed pizzas).

Perfect recipe as is, however this time when I made it I needed 3 crusts and I only had 1 pkg of yeast. I doubled everything but the yeast and made 3 thin crust pizzas. They were delicious!

I don't feel that this has a pizza taste and texture. I threw the called-for ingredients into my bread machine and let the dough cycle run, split the ball for two 12" pizzas, panned and prebaked 5 minutes before topping. My disappointment is the too sweet taste and the sandwich bread texture, with no chewiness.

This was the best thin crusted pizza crust that I have made.  I added garlic powder and basil and it was delicious.  I kept it in the refrigerator and used it for 3 days to make a small pizza each day.  The first day the dough was a little hard to deal with  and the pizza was a little thicker.  The 2nd day and 3rd day the dough was very easy to deal with and the pizza was cracker thin.  The only problem that I had, was after the basil and garlic sat for 3 days they became bitter.  Maybe it is not such a good idea to use the herbs unless you use the dough right away.

I also froze 3 pizza's with sauce and cheese for later.  I cooked the dough for 5 minutes before adding the toppings and the froze them.  I added fresh onions, tomatoes and green peppers before cooking on the grill and they were great.

Does the job. :) I used a rolling pin to shape and baked in a 12 inch pizza pan with border crust. I rolled it 1/4 inch thick. It rose to 1/2 inch thick so the dough could be rolled thinner for a bigger pizza. Topped and baked 20 mins. Let cool 2 before cutting.

I made this last night for dinner with the help of my 5 year old.  pretty easy to measure and mix and knead to finish combining ingredients.  Rolled out on my pizza stone pretty easily.  Kids and hubby enjoyed it.

Great recipe that's super easy.  I modified the recipe slightly using KAF bread flour and changed the water accordingly to achieve the consistency I wanted.  I also added some Italian seasonings and let the dough rise for a little bit to get the full flavor.

five stars for easiness! I brushed on some egg white and baked at 425 F for 8 minutes before adding sauce and toppings. After I added sauce and toppings, I cooked for an additional 8 minutes at 425.

I make this maybe once a week.  It is a great pizza crust.  I have found that baking it on parchment paper and putting oil on the top before you add ingredients works the best. Bake only on the parchment - no pan.  It took me years to figure out how to get my crust done on the bottom and not burn the top - parchment paper.  Also having a peel is a must.  I bought a cheap metal peel and it works great.  I make my pizzas on the smaller side so I get three pizzas out of this recipe.   I love it and am so glad I stumbled across this recipe.

Had to make some modifications since the 3 cups of flour to one cup of water didn't quite work out. Too much flour was left over and it was hard to knead.

Another reviewer stated the dough was gummy when taken out of the machine.
I had the same problem.   After cutting the dough in half, I put half in a bag with oil. (thanks to another reviewer for that idea).        While my pizza crust was baking, I picked the bag up to put it in the fridge.   I noticed that there were bubbles inside.
The next day I used the dough, and it was easy to work with.
I came to the conclusion that it was the humidity in the kitchen that caused the problem.

It was cooler today, so made another batch.   No problems with gummy dough.

I've made this so much, I'm surprised Pizza Hut hasn't called me to see if I was ok...lol.

Fool proof.  I mixed wet ingredients and sugar with yeast and then flower and salt. Wasn't ready to use yet, so let rise 1.5 hrs.  Used for 4 calzones which we cooked at 350F for 35-40 min.

This pizza dough was very easy to make. Unfortunately, it was bland like cardboard. If you choose to use all purpose flour instead of bread flour, then your gonna have a bad time. You need the extra gluten of the bread dough and let it rise or you will have cardboard with excellent toppings.  Also, always proof your yeast first.

I made this a couple of times already.  I really like this recipe because I hate to cook and can quickly have pizza without having to spend $100 on take out.  The only thing that I do differently is that I add a little seasoning in the dough like Italian seasonings or garlic salt etc.

Ridiculously easy, super taste, and QUICK to make. This is our family's new "go-to" for avoiding carry out. Better by far than any frozen pizza dough, this will will save time & money, and make your tastebuds happy.

Added 1 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp basil . Cut flour to 2 1/2 cups and used olive oil. Let rise 30 minutes. Cook 5-7 minutes before topping. 

First time topped with mozzarella, minced garlic and fresh basil.

I hate to be the one who made changes,  but there were very few.  I let the yeast sit in the hot water for 5 minutes,  then after all ingredients were mixed I placed the dough in a covered bowl on the stove with the oven preheating for 10 minutes.   The warmth helps the dough rise.  It was perfect.  I'd love to try the recipe verbatim,  but the few extra steps made an amazing pizza.

I just made this tonight, and it was excellent! So much better than the previous recipe I was using to make pizza. After mixing, I kneaded it a bit, let it rise for 30 min, and kneaded again before rolling out. It was  delicious .This will be the recipe I use from now on.

Okay, I've made this recipe 3 times. the 1st time worked out great with a couple of tweaks suggested by other users. I added the herbs because, I wanted to make bread sticks with half of the dough. I also let yeast rise or mix or what ever it does. I put it in the warm water with sugar and honey (about 1/2 teaspoon). the 2nd time I made it, it don't know what went wrong it didn't rise like the 1st time. the 3rd time was a disaster, I forget to let the yeast rise separately and I added to much water. this last time, I was back to what I did the first time.... magnificent! even tho I'm sure this recipe would be great as written, I really think it benefits from the herbs and setting the yeast to the side and letting the dough proof. I would give 5 stars, but I have to give it a 3 star and 5 stars to myself for making it my way.

This is the best quick and easy pizza dough recipe I have ever tried.  I made it first and let it rise in the pan for a few minutes while I prepared the toppings. I pre-baked it for about 5 minutes before adding the toppings, and it turned out fantastic!

Was my first attempt at home made pizza dough - everyone loved it.    I did split the ratio of flour to half white and half whole wheat, but that is just a personal choice - I am sure would have been just as good with all white flour.

Absolutely loved this crust! Quick and simple. I made 4 good sized pizzas from one dough batch, then made 2 more batches and froze a bunch of personal size pizza crusts, and made a calzone. Great as is, great altering and playing with seasonings. Even amazing if you do let it rise a little (which happened with the calzone crust, and I just punched it back down and it was great). Prebake the crust if you want it crispier, skip it if you want it softer. We did add half a tablespoon more olive oil to our dough and it really helped the dough come together just a smidge more!

The quickest and easiest pizza dough that we've found that you don't HAVE to let rise! A lifesaver for busy, impatient, and/or hungry people when you still want a great tasting crust.

It is a quick and easy crust to make. It is a bit denser than typical pizza crust, but for quick and easy, it is awesome and my family did enjoy it.

I read all the reviews and added the spices.I let the yeast rise before adding the dry ingredients. I added mushrooms , red peppers and sundries tomatoes. It was great and I will make it again.

I found the dough to flavorful enough but it was much to bready. I'll be looking for a way to get a thinner crispier crust next time.

I love how easy and basic it is. I did do what someone suggested and let the water sugar and yeast dissolve and let the dough rise for about half hour.

No need to change anything. This is my go to for pizza dough. Quick, easy and delicious!  I have used it many times. Of course you can experiment with adding herbs and spices if you want but the basic recipe is great as is!  Thanks for sharing this.. My boys love homemade pizza night!

I HATE to cook and I LOVE this recipe!  I mix it in the bread machine.  I have also used this dough recipe to make pigs in blankets.  Who ever said it would result in a thin crisp crust has never actually MADE this recipe.  The dough is nice and soft.  I think it would also make good pretzels.  I've taken to throwing fresh oregano from my garden into the machine when mixing the ingredients, that's big time experimentation for me.  Thank you so much for this versatile recipe!

Good, basic dough. Not for pizza connoisseurs, but considering how easy it is to make, I'd use it when limited time is a factor. 

We baked the pizza at a hotter temp (425 F), and brushed the edges with olive oil. Adds flavor, and browns the crust better.

Made this tonight, only added Italian spices. Needs more salt, needed to cook more than the min 20 minutes to be crispy in the center. Not bad for a quickie recipe. The dough is VERY sticky - be sure to grease your hands before handling.

This is FAST & EASY pizza. The only thing I will do different is either make the center thinner and the edge thicker or use a larger pan. I used a 13" pan but I put almost a pound of mozzarella and a whole can of pineapple chunks. The center was a little underdone but I like it that way. The two odd pieces were for my husband who only likes pepperoni ;)

I tried this tonight and it was really good. I decided since its Cinco de Mayo I would make a taco pizza, but it was last minute and I didn't want to wait forever on the crust. This is a simple, last minute pizza crust that tastes great. I was worried at first if it would turn out. We devoured it in no time. Made me wash I had made two. I noticed some complaints about the crust, but  great for what it is. A last minute lets have pizza moment.

The perfect quick dough recipe. I'm skittish in the kitchen but this one was basic enough to give me courage.
Be careful not to use self-rising flour! Fourth time making this, I did & it was thick, chewy, stubborn dough.

Tried the recipe as written.  Ingredients wouldn't mix together unless I added some more water, and even then it was incredibly stiff.  Crust came out hard and chewy.

My first time making any kind of pizza dough, but I did follow the instructions...they just seem too simple to mess up.  My only change is to put the dough in the oven about 5 minutes to bake it a bit before adding toppings, and it did not help, but I get the feeling had I not done that, it would have come out much worse.

After fully baking, the dough was still dense and doughy.  Even my daughter who will eat whatever I make, even if she doesn't like it, so that she doesn't hurt my feelings wouldn't eat this. That's pretty bad. There is such a thing as bad pizza afterall :(

This pizza crust was so rock hard we could hardly chew it. I followed the directions exactly. If anything, i baked it a few minutes less than it called for cuz it smelled and looked done and 20 minutes seemed like a long time to bake a pizza.

I've used this recipe a dozen times by now and I make it a little different every time. If I am in a hurry, I don't let it rise, and it tastes fine. If I have enough time, I let it rise for about 30+ minutes, as a lot of reviewers have suggested, and it does taste a lot better. I usually add some herbs and/or seasonings also. It's pretty much just a perfect base recipe for you to change up however you want.

I'm really happy with the recipe since I don't always plan ahead, especially when it's something I'm craving, such as pizza. With this recipe, I can turn on the oven, start a quick sauce, make the dough, put it together, cook it, then enjoy!!! All within an hour or so.

I agree with other reviewers that some people simply don't GET the point of this being a quick dough.

Tried this today, and it's excellent.  I did add some garlic and onion powder to the mix, and did let it rise a bit before I spread it into a pan. Then let it sit for a while before I pre-baked it for 7 minutes.  I am sure it would be all right as written, thus the 5 stars.  I just had time to kill before dinner.  It is great tasting, and I will continue to use this recipe from now on.  Froze half of it too.

I love this recipe and always follow it exactly. It's the closest thing to the southern NJ style pizza crust I'm used too.

Just add a tiny bit more sugar and flour, a pinch and it's great and easy.

Crust was ok as written. I prebaked crust for 7 minutes before topping with sauce and meat. Next time I will prebake for at least 15 minutes before adding toppings. Crust was not done. Maybe a hotter oven would help. Making the dough itself was super easy and fast, taste was good. Will try this recipe again using above tips.

It's OK. Good when you're in a hurry. Don't forget to perforate the crust and add some cornmeal to the bottom of the pan for extra texture.

Who knew you could make pizza dough without needing to wait an hour for rising?!  I followed the directions but subbed white whole wheat flour and added an extra 3/4 c water.  It was very good and soo easy-I'm adding it to our frequent dinner rotation.  All 4 kids plus husband approved!  Thanks for the recipe!

Perfect every time and simple to make. I usually make a double batch and roll out half of them for bread sticks for a side. Truly worth a try if your making homemade pizza. I usually add a tablespoon or two of granulated garlic and a few chili peppers to spice up the crust for added flavors. Great base dough!

This recipe is simple and fast. I'm not a good baker (or a good cook for that matter) but I have made this several times and it hasn't failed me yet. I do bake the pizza at a much higher temperature though, and it still works great!!!

I mixed a tablespoon of melted butter and 1/2 of garlic powder together and brushed it on the crust before baking. It added a little more flavor to it. You can also brush it on halfway through the baking time as well.

This was my first time ever making pizza dough and my husband and I were pleasantly surprised how good it was.  We do like our pizza to be thinner crust, although we love pizza of all kinds. I do feel like it needed more water and I needed to add some seasonings.

This is perfect for a quick pizza.  I added a little packet of seasoning you add oil to to dip bread in.  Perfect.  My 2 year old asked for it for breakfast the next morning.
Also, the crust was crunchy, and the rest of the dough came out soft.

This did not turn out well.  It was my first attempt at making pizza crust and I was attracted to the recipe because it didn't require yeast.  As a result, the crust was dense and not very soft.  I probably won't try this recipe again.  It may be entirely my fault it didn't turn out, but I appreciated simplicity of the recipe.

This is a great basic quick dough! I have been using it to make pizza crusts or even bread rolls and they always come out great. I even used it for runzas tonight, I added a little more sugar then called for, and butter instead of oil and it was the perfect runza dough.

Good dough and easy to make. I agree with other reviewers that the dough didn't have a lot of "flavor." But I don't usually eat pizza dough with flavors in it so it was just perfect for me.

This was so easy. I've tried many pizza dough recipes and never had this kind of success. I even made it,let it rise on an oiled cookie sheet for about 1/2 hour, then something came up so I covered the pan and put it in the fridge for a day. I was going to make it the next day so I put the sauce and toppings on, but then the family was on the run so - back in the fridge for another day. The next day I baked it. It was excellent. This is my kind of no-fail recipe!

Just made this because I knew I had Mozzarella and pepperoni in the fridge and nothing else thawed for dinner. So I mixed this basically as it calls, but not an entire 3 cups of flour and not packed flour. It may have taken me a few minutes to roll the dough into a circle and put on all my ingredients, but a little olive oil and loose salt on top and it was delicious for a last minute pizza dinner!

This is a keeper!! What I did was dissolve the yeast with the water and sugar, oil, let rest for a couple of minutes, mixed in flour and then mixed enough to moistened. Turned out on floured board and kneaded for a couple of minutes. Put in a greased bowl with olive oil and let rise for about 45 minutes.Punch down and rest for 5 minutes then took half for crust and lightley rolled out and oiled my #10 cast iron skillet, little corn meal, then shaped up the sides. let rest for 10 minutes and prebaked for 5 minutes @ 350. Took out and filled with all the good toppings and back to the oven @400 till crust browns. Took the remaining dough and made bread sticks with butter, garlic, cheese. Thanks for the base recipe, rave reviews!

Just made this dough for a quick pizza for dinner tonight. It was a huge hit!! For an "instant" pizza dough I thought it was awesome! I added onion powder, garlic powder and basil to the dry ingredients and used olive oil. I will definitely use this dough again.

For what it was, a quick and easy recipe, I liked it. I was very easy, and it didn't taste bad.  On the other hand, it was very dense and bland. Still, 4 stars because I will probably make it again, it was that easy.

This is a very basic dough recipe. The only change I did was let the dough sit for 1 hour covered, in a warm place, before getting ready to use it. I tried to store it in the fridge as some others suggested - it exploded :( It had continued to rise quite a bit. Haven't tried storing it in the freezer. I would only make this when I'm ready to use it. Really simple.

Question: Would this work just as well with 100% whole wheat (or any other) flour?

We used this dough for pizza tonight.We made 2 batches and proofed the yeast on both. We let one batch rise for 30 mins the other went straight to the oven. Par cooked them for 15 mins, dressed the pie and cooked 10 mins more. We couldn't tell the difference. Great 5 star recipe Gudny and thank you for sharing!

The only reason I didn't like it a lot  because the dough was dry and trying to roll it out didn't work. So my pizza was on the small side but the dough got super thick when baked. Anyone have a problem with your dough being too dry? It was my first time so was a little scared to add more water.

I don't get all the positive reviews, just couldn't get this to work out for me.  Crust came out dense, heavy, and raw-tasting.

I followed this recipe as written. The hubby loves thin crust pizza, so I hand pressed the dough into a 15" x 17" rectangular pizza. The end result was a thin and tender bottom crust. We loved it.

This is a great recipie for dough on the fly! It beats spending the extra $ at the supermarket for the premade dough too, especially for those on a limited budget! I would have to say that this recipie would have gotten the full 5 stars if the first batch had come out correctly...I followed it to a T, but I ended up with a brick VS a stretchable dough, so that one got chucked. The second attempted I used 1 1/2 cups of water over rather than just the 1 cup the recipie asks for.  Yes, it was VERY stick after doing this, but is much easier to fix a stick wet dough by adding additional flour a little at a time, than a rock hard block. Once I got my desired consistancy, I shaped it directly on my pizza pan that I had drizzled with olive oil earlier.  I will use this recipie again, but next time I will pre-bake the crust for a few minutes to harden it up before adding any toppings. Although my pizza was still delicious, I like to use fresh tomatoes, which with the extra liquid caused the crust not to bake as well as I had liked.

Excellent quick recipe!  Only modifications: combine water, sugar and yeast and let sit ~5 minutes till foamy on top.  Combined with flour, salt, and oil in mixer with dough hook.  Kneaded ~4 minutes.  Heat oven to 500 degrees, place rack in lowest position, used cornmeal on pan (stone), add pizza to oven, turn oven down to 475 degrees, bake ~10-12 minutes. Perfect!!

I have made this recipe with the suggestions from LADYMHARRIS >10 times, and the pizza dough is perfect! I understand this particular recipe is meant to be simple, but it just doesn't produce the right texture. I highly recommend following LADYMHARRIS's suggestions. You will be very pleased with the results.

I just made this pizza dough recipe and it was wonderful. Easy to make and tastes great. I did add another quarter cup of water to the batch to make the flour all absorb. I also put the pizza onto the bottom of the oven the last ten minutes for a nice browned crust.

Ok, this dough is my "goto" dough. I mix it in the bread machine, water, yeast, sugar, oil followed by flour, I add 1T of Italian seasoning and 1T of granulated onion. I use the dough for hamburger buns (12), what I call "weeny" buns, rolled around mini sausages (24), Calzones (4 big) as well as pizza...all come out so good, I make a batch almost every day. This has become our daily bread.

Quick and easy recipe that can be modified to suit your tastes. Not the best overall but when you need a pizza dough in a pinch, it works very well.

This dough is super sticky at the beginning, but after letting it rise if you add some flour it's not hard to work with. Tastes good! I'd use it again just because it's so simple.

Loved this recipe! It was quick and fool proof. My husband actually liked it alot more than the traditional dough .. This was the perfect dinner after a long day at work... quickly made the dough.. added some ready-made pizza sauce and some leftover chicken & cheese... Yummy! Thanks for the great recipe :D
A few tips:
1. Spiced up the dough a bit with a little onion powder, bread crumbs & thyme
2. Greased the pizza pan with a little oil 
3. I left it to cook for 25 mins, and it was slightly brown at the bottom.. next time I will bake for 20 mins only.. it's more than enough
4. Didn't pre-bake.. & it was just fine..
P.S. I had left overs 2 days later & it tasted even better!

Simple.  I didn't want to leave the house today and my kids wanted pizza.  Not wanting to leave the house limited my ingredients.  So this recipe was PERFECT!  I made it just as the recipe says, topped it with fixings, put it in the oven and hoped it was at least edible.  And it was!  My son said it was better than his usual pizza place, and my husband liked it better than the quick french bread pizza I usually make.  I won't be serving it to company, but it's perfect for a quick weeknight meal.

I am not a baker so I really appreciate how easy this recipe is.  It turned out a bit dense the first time, but I think rolling it thinner and prebaking for few minutes would help.

This was perfect for a quick dough. It took little effort to make and my family loved it. I left out the sugar and used 2 cups of all purpose and 1 cup of whole wheat. Great recipe, thank you!

I liked this quite a bit - in fact, I made it three weekends in a row, exactly as written. It's indeed a basic-tasting pizza crust, but it's also very easy. (Actually, the first time, the dough was sticking to my hands and making a mess. After that, I found that a non-stick spatula worked like a charm to mix the dough.) The first time I made this, for a 14-inch pizza pan, it was much too thick for my tastes. After that, using a 16-inch pan, it worked out very nicely.

This was a great recipe that turned out better than I expected.  I did add Italian seasoning and garlic powder to it, which I think really boosted the flavor.  It was a little dense for me, I think next time I will try the suggestion of combining yeat and water first to make a thinner crust.

I have used this dough exactly as written and also taken time to dissolve the yeast, knead, rise, etc.  I do prefer to take the time, but it comes out nicely either way.  Parbaked the crust and loaded it with pierogi pizza toppings (brushed crust with olive oil, spread layer of mashed potatoes, topped with bacon and cheddar cheese (not as much cheese needed as a regular pizza).  When done, drizzled with sour cream and sprinkled chives on top.  Delicious!

A good, quick dough. I used half white flour and half whole wheat and had enough dough for three personal pies when I cooked it up in my 6" cast iron skillets. One was a white pie, the other was double cheese, and the last was with ham & pineapple. I used coconut oil to coat the last and olive oil on the first two. I put the ingredients in my Ninja, using the dough paddle and it took only a minute to process. It may feel a little sticky, and that's okay, because once you flour up the board and roll it out (I used a bottle filled with rice) it's easy to handle. Precook the crust, so it won't be soggy. If you do opt for the cast iron method, the cooked crust goes on a lower setting and the toppings go on! I heated up a larger skillet and put that on top to seal in the heat. It melts well, but won't have a brownish crisp unless you give it to the broiler but this was just a quick snack for friends. Everyone liked it.

first time making homemade pizza! Made exactly as directed and the crust was soft, doughey with good texture! It was not crispy or thin (although I think that has everything to do with how flat you make it when forming the pie...) This is a keeper!

I have tried this recipe twice as is. As RenaKS27 and Clare have mentioned: it is best to follow it as is for a nice quick pizza dough. Adding some dry herbs doesn't take too much more time. So the second time I did add some herbs to our liking. But overall, I love the ease of this pizza dough. You can make the entire pizza in less time than ordering in, and for about pennies to the dollar.

Delicious with a few of my alterations: used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 2 cups flour, honey instead of sugar, olive oil instead of veg oil, I also added italian seasoning and garlic powder. This dough was very easy to make and tasted delicious! It's a definite go to!

I made this recipe as stated above and loved it. of course, i did add seasoning to flavor the crust. but LOVED that i did not have to wait for the dough to rise. i did not end up with a thin crispy crust and was very pleased. i have made a lot of homemade pizza and this crust was super easy and as good as the recipes that take longer.

Way too much flour-I was done adding flour at just over 2 cups.  It helps to mix the flour into the liquids 1/2 cup at a time, then you know when to stop adding flour.  Awesome bread tutorial on YouTube- search Crafty Gemini and view the one for bread.  Otherwise it was quick and easy.  If the recipe had listed "thin crust dough" I think many more people would have given it higher scores.

I made this twice tonight.  The first time I made it, I proofed the yeast in the water with sugar before adding it to the dry ingredients (which yielded a thicker, chewier crust).  The second time, I made according to the recipe directions (which yielded a thinner and crispier crust).  This is actually very easy and it serves the purpose.  My kids and I felt that this is a homemade version of the pizza dough mixes sold in stores that we use quite frequently.  The bonus with this recipe is that I didn't have the pull back that I normally get with the store bought mixes.  I look forward to working with this recipe to try and tweak it.  Maybe give it a bit more crunch and a wee bit more flavor.

Tried this tonight - Very easy - very good. 
I liked that I could make a pizza from scratch at the last minute. I did not change anything, except used Olive oil instead of vegetable oil. 
Added my seasonings to the toppings, not the dough.

I was surprised at how quickly everything came together.I followed the advice of other reviews by mixing the water, yeast and sugar  first and let stand for 10 min. Also added oregano, basil, onion, powder and garlic powder to the flour mixture. Our family enjoyed it!

I made this dough adding 1/4 cup minced parsley and 1 teaspoon black pepper. It was quite easy and a success!! It is not necessary to bake the crust beforehand. Just mix, spread, add sauce, toppings, cheese and bake. There is no need to add unnecesary steps. It is simple, yet perfect.

I tried this first in November last year and we love it.  I have only used this recipe for pizza crust ever since.  This recipe is quick and easy.  I use my baking stone and bake it 25 minutes.  Give it a try.  It's awesome.

We followed the recipe "as is", and thought it was pretty good.  We'll use it again as the base recipe and try some of the "modifications" others have done.  All in all, we liked it and it will go in my recipe box for next week.

Was okay, too doughy for my taste. My hubs liked it and it was quick, so I'd probably try it again when pinched for time. I proofed the yeast first and let it rise for about an hour.

I had to knead the dough a bit since the ingredients didn't come together that well, but the pizza turned out well and I might add some italian seasoning like some other reviewers did last time. Overall, very easy recipe, simple and tasty.

I made this into mini pizzas yesterday. I used onion salt and olive oil. Kneaded dough for only 5 minutes. I divided the ball in half and put one ball into an oil sprayed gallon bag. The other ball made 4 mini pizzas, prebaked for 4 or 5 minutes, topped and baked 8-10 minutes. Today I made 1 more mini pizza to see how the dough was. It was softer after baked. I let it set out to rise until puffy. Tomorrow the others will be baked.  This recipe is easy, fast and fun...delicious, thank you!

Made using gluten free flour and it turned out great! Used olive oil and reduced to 2 1/2 cups flour as others suggested.

It is fast and easy.  I do dissolve the yeast and sugar in water like some of the other reviewers. I like this one for the quickness of the dough.  My house is too cold in the winter to really get dough to rise well.  I have added Italian spices and made calzones with this dough.

i made this with my 5 year old tonight.  first off, i had to add more water to it because all of the dry did not mix together with the wet all the way.  i had to add almost another 1/4 cup to it, but after that, it came together rather quickly.  we turned this into 2 personal pizzas (im guessing 6 inch each?). i get that this isnt a very sophisticated, and you can tell by the taste.  it is very dense and slightly tough.  the bonus to that is that it is very filling as well.  i think next time i make it, i will try to make the pizzas a little thinner (although they were fairly thin as it was) and see if that helps with the denseness.  if you like an airy (lighter maybe...more like delivery i guess) crust, this wont be for you.

I LOVE this recipe! SO easy... the only suggestion I would make would be to add garlic powder, basil and parmesan to the dough to add more flavor. Also, once dough is rolled out on pan, brush butter/parmesan on it. YUM! I highly recommend this to anyone =)

It's not the best pizza dough recipe I've ever made, but for being simple and no-rise, it's very, very good!  I usually let it rise for an hour while we go to church on Saturday nights, but other than that, I follow the recipe as is.  My husband actually prefers this recipe to other more "legit" pizza dough recipes I've made.  We like to top it as a Margherita pizza with just Romas, basil, and fresh mozza...yum!

I followed this recipe EXACTLY, without adjusting ingredients/amounts or directions. I love this pizza dough! It's so easy to make, and the best part is you can make it into whatever you need. I made a regular pizza, but I also made a buffalo pull apart bread with this recipe. Either way, it turned out really tasty. No need to alter this recipe in ANY way.

It's nice when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise. It's just a basic bread dough recipe and tastes like it. I've made it a few times and my husband said I need a new recipe.

Omgosh! So I make another dough from another site usually. I decided I wanted a change & found this recipe. Now, I'm sure there are things I can do to make the dough a little more flavorful, but I have to say, this recipe was absolutely beautiful in the oven and rising up! I doubled the recipe right off the bat bc we have a large family. It was perfect! This is now my go to recipe. You really don't have to do any extra steps! That was the beauty of it. I definitely recommend this one to ANYONE who doesn't have the time to wait! Thanks for the recipe!

LOVE THIS RECIPE! I hate waiting for dough to rise, so this was perfect. The dough came out squishy and moist! I used a homemade tomato sauce that I made with chopped fresh tomatoes, canned whole tomatoes, and many spices that tasted great with the homemade dough! Yummy!! Use this for an easy recipe and especially if you don't have time to wait for the dough to rise!

This recipe has become my family's Sunday night tradition. I have a deep dish recipe that takes several hours to prepare and raise; this recipe doesn't come close. It is, however, significantly better than any frozen pizza and more affordable than delivery. 

I sprinkle the pan generously with cornmeal and pre-bake for ten minutes before adding the sauce, cheese, and toppings.

The recipe is great as is, and I always use the full amount of flour. If you have it on hand, it benefits from 1/4 tsp each of garlic powder, basil, and oregano.

OMG!!! Possibly the easiest and best homemade dough recipe in the world! I loved the fact that I didn't have to wait for it to rise, then bake, then top, then bake again! My kids loved it because it was done super fast and they got to help :) 2 BIG thumbs up!!!

Wonderful crust made two double batches last night one with a herbs in the dough and one regular, both were fantastic crispy on the outside chewy inside. Made a stuffed crust pizza for the kids they raved about it. I had a little dough left over so I made it into garlic cheese bread and that was a hit too. I can't wait to make home made pizza again!

Made breadsticks with this recipe.  So easy.  Mixed up the dough, formed the breadsticks, baked them and then in the mouth.  So good and fast!!  Will use this recipe again for breadsticks or for pizza dough.  Wonderful.  No changes made to the recipe.

So easy! Stop over thinking it some of you, do just as it says. Mix all the dry together then pour the combined wet ingredients, stir, toss a slight kneed roll it out or pat into the pan add toppings and bake. Nothing hard about this. I'm an impatient cook and this is now going into my files. Only suggestion is for the amount this makes perfect for thick crust, if ya want thinner I would divide the dough and make two.

This is a tasty, easy, pizza dough!  It's also an amazing base for other things too....so far I've made cinnamon twists (added cinnamon and sugar to the dough and coated with the same), and breadsticks (added garlic powder, italian seasoning, and parmesan to the dough).

I altered the recipe some by adding oregano and garlic to the flour and activated my yeast beforehand with the water, sugar, and salt. Then let the dough sit overnight in the fridge (wasn't my original intention). It was probably one of me and my wife's favorite so far. It filled about an 18" pan with a hand-tossed fluffy dough, then the outer crust ended up really good too. Definitely keeping this one.

This was my first time making pizza and was a little nervous but thanks to the recipes being shown how to make it, I had no problem making it and will make it again! Just to see how I did for the first time I just made a simple cheese pizza, but since it turned out good I can go ahead and get creative like adding brocoli, mushrooms, and peppers.

I can say this is NOT the best. Nothing really can be perfect. But being quick and simple it is defiantly the best I prefer to use out of all I have tried simple or not.
I like to mix Garlic and union powder seasonings into this dough to add more flavor. When I cook it I have to go a full 25-30 minutes, or else it wont be cooked all the way since the first time I attempted this recipe was all messy going only 20 minutes. I also like to take Virgin Olive oil and rub it all over the dough once it has been formed into the pizza shape, square or round before adding sauce and toppings.
I have yet to try it without this, but defiantly easy and tasty with what I have experienced and very pleased with this recipe.
It is a very good one for someone new to making Pizza dough, to experiment with or try something new. (: Have fun!

Super quick and easy, mix was very dry so I added a touch more water and topped with store bought tomato sauce and some strong Irish cheddar, my family liked it. I used Olive oil in the mix.

Great recipe! Been my go-to recipe for about 3 years now. If I have time on my hands, I mix the dough and leave it to rise for about 60-90 minutes in the bread maker, which results in an airy dough. Sometimes I cut the flour 50/50 with Gold Medal whole wheat flour and that usually turns out good as well.

I made this recipe. it was a simple recipe. although if i didnt know to let dough rise and then roll and let rise in pan. i dont know if it would have ben that good lol. anyways made a small pizza with half the dough and used the other half to make breadsticks. brushed with some melted butter garlic powder a pinch of salt and oregeno and parsly. then sprinkled with some parmeasan cheese. was yummie. only one complaint i think this recipe needs about 1 to 2 tablespoons more watter in the recipe. because the dough didnt rise as much as i would have liked.

Great easy, basic dough. We always turn our oven up as high as it will go (500) and let it preheat for like 30 min for homemade pizza crusts. Spread a little cornmeal on the pizza pan before you put the dough on, pre-bake for 10 min or so, and then top and bake just a little longer until the cheese is melty. It'll only take a few minutes, and you'll have a nice, crispy crust!

I think this recipe is great for people like me who like to keep it simple, fast and easy. I've made it 3 times now and every time it's awesome. I don't really measure as exact as most people do, and I use organic ingredients and 2.5 cups flours and .5 cup of ground flax seeds. Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

This is a good basic ingredient list. I have used it many many times and have added what my family has found to their liking and what I have in my pantry. I don't usually follow any recipe to the T but tweak it to my liking. I always refer back to this recipe for the ingredients etc which is why I give it 5 stars!  It has worked great for me.

Excellent recipe! We LOVED it! I used spelt flour and honey instead of sugar, and it was perfect. It made a nice, thick, tender crust. We'll be using this recipe from now on!

Some of the reviews suggested making breadsticks with this recipe.. Don't even try that.. It was soft n soggy. As a quick pizza base, it's good n easy to make. Made a thin crust pizza n it tasted really good.

Really super easy to make! I made 2 batches, the first batch was cooked right away, super dense, the only reason I will rate this as a 3, the second batch I let rise for about 10 minutes, this batch was better and would be a 4 star! definately will be making again, maybe take one batch and split it between two pizzas with a 10 minute rise time.

This dough baked up nice thick and chewy. Was very simple and easy, especially if you've never made it before. I did have to add about 1/4 cup more water. because dough was falling apart too easily. for flavor taste I also used garlic salt instead of salt. and added a pinch of italion and pizza seasoning. Bu its good in its ariginal form too.

Wake up, people!  This recipe is/was intended to be a FAST crust when you need pizza dough-  NOW.  It is not as good as one that has rested for three days, but it WILL make a darn good pissa, faster than you can get everything else ready.  It will work in a pan and it will work on a stone.  However, if you're using a stone, PLEASE use a lot of corn meal.  Baking parchment and a little corn meal is even better, but please slip-out the paper after 2-3-4 minutes in the oven and then continute baking on your stone.  As much as I like well-aged and flavored pizza doughs, this recipe works well for the "I need it NOW" pizza dough.  Double or triple batches are OK, if you have a strong mixer - and do not over-mix or machine-knead.  Divide as soon as mixing is done and let it rest as directed.  It may lack the flavor and texture of a mature dough, but it is a  site better than bought/delivered pizza, if you can wait 90 minutes.

This is a great little recipe for a QUICK dough.  I followed the one reviewer's advice by adding the yeast and sugar to the water to dissolve before adding the liquid to the flour.  I doctored it up a little, though.  I added garlic and onion powders, red pepper flakes and Italian seasoning to the flour mixture.  It was delicious. Thanks!

Best basic pizza dough recipe, love it! It is so quick to make and it tastes yummy. I have used this recipe countless times. I use one less cup of flour when I want thin crust and stick to three cups when I want it pan style. I also use whole wheat flour sometimes and it tastes great! Thanks much for a straight forward recipe!

A wonderful recipe for pizza crust. After stirring everything together, I found that this dough really needed to be kneaded, and would not have worked without this step. After kneading for about 10 minutes, I oiled the dough and put into an oiled bowl, then covered and let rise in a warm place for about 30 minutes. After stretching to fit on a cookie sheet ( this dough is NOT elastic like traditional piazza dough) I parbaked it at 350 for about 5 minutes. Then I added my toppings and set in the oven to bake. The consistency of the cooked dough has a slightly crisp surface and soft inside. It almost reminded me of foccacia. DELICIOUS.

Love how easy it is to make, and I don't have to buy premade dough full of preservatives and who knows what. The whole family loves it. I use olive oil instead of vegetable. Perfect with sauteed onions, gruyere, and kalamata olives.

Outstanding.
I did let it rise for 30 mins and baked for 5 before topping with melted tomato and onions with garlic and olive oil for the sauce, sausage, green onion and pancetta over fresh grated mozerella. My wife said it was the best pizza she has ever had.

excellent recipe, it was just what I was looking for. I made two pizzas from the recipe and they were gone in 2 minutes. I had to make another batch to feed all the kids. I agree that letting the yeast and sugar sit in the warm water for a few minutes really helps.

This came out great! I added pizza seasoning to the dough and rolled it out very thin. It wasn't chewy, but worked great considering I cooked it right after making it. No waiting. I also dissolved the yeast in warm water before mixing.

Perfect dough for pizza! We love the texture, it's awesome! We made it twice, and find out it will be more crispy if you bake it at 400F for 20 mins. Love it!

FAN-TAS-TIC.  I used exact ingredients, and added a little flour as needed.  Although this is a quick recipe and good as- is without allowing dough to rise, I was able to let it rise without prolonging the prep time anyway (which does add a little special something to the end product).  It turns out, if you mix the dough ingredients first knead dough and set it aside covered, you will likely have plenty of time to let it rise while you brown your meat and chop your other ingredients.  I also make my own sauce, so I did all of the topping prep while my dough sat covered, and it turned out soooooo good.  I did not bake the dough before adding toppings and used a large cookie sheet.  Perfect medium thickness crust.  It is not a hard dough, not crispy or thin, and did not get too big or tough, it was so perfect.  Don't hesitate to try this.

I followed this recipe directly in terms of portions and what to do. For my own taste I like to use whole wheat flour so I used two cups whole wheat and one cup all-purpose flours. This recipe is easy and quick. The best part is that my husband loves it. Makes a delicious pizza.

Great, easy recipe. Took very little time and prep. Could also be used as a breadstick dough. Yum.

After making this recipe a couple of times, I would suggest cutting the sugar back to 1 tsp.  Furthermore, while you can use the dough immediately, it is best to allow it time to raise.  The best results so far have come from allowing it to raise for nearly two hours (punching it down twice during that time, and I use Rapid Rise yeast), the raising time improves both the flavor and texture of the finished crust.  I also bake the final pizzas at 450 for 18 minutes, a crisper crust without burning the cheese and other toppings.

It's not perfect, but it'll do for getting on with.

If you are making this recipe and do not have the time to let it rise, I would suggest adding some spices to the dough, italian seasoning, basil, oregano, garlic and onion powder all work well...

Excellent for the busy week night and you just HAVE to have pizza (okay maybe it's your 5 year old who HAS to have pizza :)  So fast & easy - beginning to the table about 40 minutes.  The only change I made was to add 1/4 more water - it was a little dry at first.  Thank you so much for sharing!

I think I have to agree with the previous commenter. People are missing the point of this recipe. It's supposed to be a last minute thing, and for what it is it's absolutely brilliant. The only thing I did differently was add some garlic powder and it turned out great. I agree that the extra steps do make a better dough in general, but for being a no-rise last minute recipe, it doesn't get better than this!

I'm a beginner who never tried any baking with flour things before. My husband loves pizza but I don't want frozen things come to our dining table so often. So I tried this one twice, the results are great. I'll try other dough recipes which include rising some other time. I appreciate traditional ways of cooking, but when it comes to a beginner like me, or when time is limited, this QUICK recipe would be just right. I'll try making breadsticks with this like KRYSTENL mentioned. Thanks!

I did not care for this. I'm not sure if I did something wrong or what (but there were two of us working to follow the recipe), but it was far too thick and dense. As other reviewers have said (those who gave it one star), it is more like partially-cooked bread than pizza dough. I will say, however, that it was very quick to make!

This dough is a WINNER in our house! My kids usually leave the crust on their plates whenever we have pizza and they ate it all up! They even commented that this was the best pizza dough ever! I made minor changes - used 2 1/2 cups flour and let the yeast sit in the warm water for about 10 minutes - but other than that, I followed the rest of the recipe and it was a big hit! We'll definitely be using this recipe from now on! It was so quick and easy and they LOVED it!

Super easy! I let it rest in the fridge for a couple hours before using and used a half whole wheat/ half regular flour mixture instead of just flour. It turned out delicious! Will use this recipe again!

My favorite pizza crust recipe is Jay's Signature Pizza Crust recipe from this site. However I did not have the time to let the dough rise. I followed it exactly and this recipe was quick, easy and delicious!  Will definitely keep on hand for those evenings when we are short on time but pizza is what the kids want. Thanks Gudny!

I loved the fact that this pizza dough didn't have to rise!  I was able to make pizza in an hour!  Even if you're craving pizza, you can still wait an hour to eat it and the best part is you don't have to tip the pizza delivery boy!

Not the best...followed to a tee but the crust was bland and a weird stiff texture. It was quick and easy but I'll be looking for something else.

The only change I made to this was substituting 1 cup of all-purpose flour for 1 cup of whole wheat flour and using olive oil, like many have suggested. Baked up light and fluffy! WONDERFUL!! (c: We topped ours with alfredo sauce, chicken, feta cheese, and fresh mozzarella. PERFECT! Thanks for this awesome, EASY recipe! I LOVE IT!

It's the pizza dough recipe that I've been looking for 50 years!  Other recipes have the dough rise first and then it's so difficult to spread out.  This was great!  I did dissolve the yeast in the water and then let the bread machine do the mixing.  I put olive oil and corn meal on the bottom of the pizza pan before I spread out the dough.  This is a keeper!

I have used this recipe for over two years. GREAT! I load my bread machine, set it for dough & sit back. I use Splenda instead of sugar, regular yeast,regular flour & I do not add salt. Very easy & tasty.

Great taste, easy, and quick to make in a hurry. I ended up with enough dough for 2 pizzas that were standard cookie pan size. I noticed that it is more of a "pan" style pizza crust, as both of my batches turned out dense and thick. Taking a whole ten minutes to put together, and with taste almost comparable to Rocky Rococo, this recipe makes it as a permanent recipe in my box.

I love love love this super easy crowd-pleasing recipe! My only change was to make it with olive oil instead of vegetable oil and throw in some Italian spices! I've made it several times now and was wondering if anyone thinks it would be possible to make this recipe with wheat flour? Anyone tried it?

This recipe was fantastic! I just put the water, sugar, and yeast together before the other ingredients to let it froth a bit (5 minutes max!) then incorporated the rest of the ingredients as it directs. My only added flare was dried oregano and a clove worth of pressed garlic. But its just fine the way it comes if your short on time and extra ingredients.

What a wonderful recipe. I was VERY skeptical that a pizza dough recipe could be mixed & then used immediately...but this one can it and it is a winner! I read through some of the other viewer's responses and I did add about a teaspoon of Garlic seasoning & about 1/2 teaspoon of oregano and everyone in my somewhat picky family LOVED it!! Follow the recipe and you won't be disappointed. This is a KEEPER!!

Loved this pizza dough.  I made two batches and then divided the dough into personal pizzas, par baked them and then let my guests create their own pizza creations.  REALLY fantastic dough, many compliments and a great time with friends.

Solid.  I added a tablespoon of minced garlic.  I think think that the fact you can add the spices that work for you without ruining dough makes this worthy of a five.

True enough you can make different crusts, but who knows they will be craving some pizza the day before, or even several hours?

This is now our staple pizza dough recipe. I don't even want to bother with any others! I really enjoy the pizza it makes, I could eat it just about every night! I use 2 teaspoons of salt instead of 1, and sometimes add garlic powder and dried herbs to the dough. It also works well with a mixture of whole wheat flour - 2 cups whole wheat with 1 cup all purpose makes a very tasty crust.  Love it, thanks for sharing this!

This recipe is ok, I've used it maybe 6-7 times now. I did notice that 1 cup of water was not enough. As it was mixing in the kitchenaid it was still really dry, and I had to add in an extra 1/4-1/3 cup. I also used olive oil instead of veg. oil. I added some Italian herbs, some garlic salt, as well as some hot garlic powder (garlic w/ cayenne). 

Each time I made this the crust turned out pretty dense, which some people may like. I also let it cook for 10 mins or so prior to adding the sauce and toppings.

Great! It was VERY quick and delicious! It was thick and fluffy just the way I like it. Although, I don't think the serving size is 15. I will definitely use this in the future. I made this pizza in about 35 minutes. (including bake time and toppings)

This pizza dough is so easy and makes GREAT thin crust pizza! The recipe gives you all the basics and you can spice it up however you like. I like to add onion powder, and maybe some herbs. What it comes down to is that this recipe is very versatile and can be thrown together in a matter of minutes. No waiting for the dough to rise. Perfect!

This recipe is so easy and turns out great! I mixed everything together and let the dough rest for about 20 mins as I decided on what I was going to put on it and then prepared the toppings. I'm not sure if letting it rest for 20 mins helped or not but it turned out delicious. And unlike what others say, you do not get a thin crispy crust with this recipe just because it's quick. I made my crust very thin and it did not come out crispy at all.

This is a fantastic recipe for last minute pizza dough - with more time and effort, it can easily be transformed into gourmet fare, but as written is perfect for a delicious base with less than one minute of prep.  

For quick and easy notching up, subsitute 1 cup of wholewheat flour for a cup of white and add some herbs.  Delicious!!

It's the perfect consistancy to work with.  Used to make pizza cups in a muffin tin!  Can add herbs & seasoning to the mix for extra flavor!!

Very easy, but a little on the plain side. It was still a great pizza dough.

A good stock pizza dough recipe. Obviously, disolving the yeast and proving dough for 45 mins to an hour will impove it considerably, but it can be used as is, and is quick and easy.

Suggestions: rip into golf ball sized pieces and brush with garlic butter prior to baking for an accompanying batch of dough balls.

I cut this to 2 and 1/4 cups flour, 2 tsp sugar, and put the yeast into the warm water while I mixed the other dry ingredients and then add the yeast water and olive oil to the flour mixture and mixed with a dough hook for 5 mins.  Initially this is very wet and sticky, but with kneading, comes together beautifully.  Let it set and rise 30 mins while preparing toppings.  I bake it at 400 degrees for 12-15 mins--watching the cheese to make sure it doesn't brown.  Makes 2 med size pizzas.  Has turned out great every time--we stopped ordering take out pizzas!

YUM!  This is the best pizza dough.  And it is so EASY!  Everyone in my family loved the pizza and it was such a hit that we had it three times in one week.  The only change I made was that I let this dough rise for 30 minutes before I rolled it out and it made two 11x17 pans.  Also once I placed it in the pan I poked holes all over the crust (with a fork) to eliminate bubbles and then baked it for 5 minutes before I put the sauce and toppings on.  After trying this, I won't ever use another pizza dough recipe!

Perfect quick dough. I followed the directions then brushed with margarine while still hot to soften the crust very slightly. One the margarine is absorbed, this crust almost tastes like a soft pretzel.

I don't understand the high rating on this at all. I followed exactly and it tastes like school pizza. If you want pizza crust you're better off buying one in your local grocery store isle than using this recipe. I had high hopes for this but sad to say it was not good at all.

LOVE IT!!!!
Add an extra 1/2 cup of warm water and it makes it easier to work with... just make sure your pan and hand are oiled.
Everyone loves it when I make this and they are worried that they won't ever have it again after I get married in a few months.... Don't worry guys, I'll leave a copy of the recipe :)

A little bready, but a great option for a quick crust.  Add the basal and garlic as suggested, it's a nice extra touch.

This pizza dough is incredibly easy to make and turned out very tasty. Some reviewers say that their crust turned out thin and crispy - mine did not. I followed the recipe to the letter, and it turned out thick and delicious. Yum!

This recipe is perfect as is.  I might do like some other suggestions and pre bake it for a few minutes for a crispier crust then add my toppings.  The ways to flavor this or personalize it are endless, but it's also great just the way it is.

This recipe is perfect for allowing you to make homemade pizza without much warning.  I followed the recipe to the letter, save that I sprinkled the pan liberally with cornmeal before spreading the dough.  I got rave reviews from everyone in the family!  The texture isn't quite like what you're accustomed to (a little more bready and a little less chewy), but it's still a very good pizza base.  If I have more time, I may try one of the recipes that calls for some rising, and refrigeration, and all that.  But if I don't have time, I can get results almost as good from this recipe right here!  I'm adding it to my recipe box!  Thank you!

I give this recipe 5 stars for ease and quickness!  I give it 3 for taste.  It could be jazzed up, I suppose.  Works great for quick lunches, which was exactly what I was looking for.

I love how simple this was to make! I let my yeast dissolve in the water with the sugar for the recommended amount of time. But while I was waiting, I was chopping up toppings for my pizza! Absolutely Delicious Crust! Thank you!

This was easy and delicious.  All it promised to be!  I let it rise while I was sauteeing my topping of chopped green and red peppers, one onion, half a pint of shitake mushrooms and that took 45 minutes, including the chopping prep time in my food processor and starting the homemade sauce.  I also used spring water and not tap water for the warm water it calls for.  amazingly easy and great tasting! thank you for the recipe!

This dough was soo easy to prepare!  I needed it in a pinch and it took me less than 10 minutes to get the pizza in the oven.  I did read some other reviews where they suggested mixing the water, yeast, sugar, and salt ahead of time to let it dissovle before mixing in with the flour and this really helped.  The best thing I liked about this recipe was that the dough was VERY easy to work with and mold...and of course my kids absolutely loved it because the crust was not too crispy and easy to eat like a breadstick!  I really loved the homemade freshness as well.  Will keep this recipe for years and years for pizza and stuffed breads!

This was VERY easy.This is my first time making pizza at home and I had no problem. The ingredients were all on hand, and directions were simple. The only problem I ran into was that the dough started to dry out before I could finsh pushing it into the pan. All I did was run my hands under the tap and go back at it! Poof! done!

Convenient because it's fast, but not very tasty. Too dense, and because the yeast isn't dissolved its taste is very apparent. I think I'll pass on making this one again, even if it is quick.

Great as is, no extra steps necessary but I do sometimes add some cornmeal and the only added thing I do to not get a floppy is put the crust in the oven 5-10 minutes then take it out and add the toppings before putting in back in for 25 mins

This is a thicker dough but the flavor is good.  Not enough to make 2.  Will keep this one.  Baked for 10 minutes before adding any sauce or toppings.

Thank you for this recipe!  I had time to let the dough knead in my KitchenAid and then rest a bit while I prepared the toppings. My family loved it and thought it was a special treat!

CROWD pleaser! Simple quick rises in the oven so if you like it thicker us a regular pizza pan if you like the crust thinner go ahead and get a larger round pan or even a larger cookie sheet. My kids are 13,9 & 4 not only could they help it satisfied their time limit of feed me fast. Thank you!

It is quick and easy...I loved it!   I added garlic powder, and some spices (thyme and basil) and it turned out fabulous.  I also used Olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

this was so easy and good and the only thing I did differently was use olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I prepared the dough and let sit covered in the bowl until I was done preheating the oven and prepping the pizza ingredients. it rose very well around the edges because I used to work at a pizza place and know how to toss the dough and indent the outer rim of the dough. YUM and sooooo easy!

Great recipe. I made a few changes, though. 1) I used bread flour instead of all-purpose flour so it would come out more chewy, 2) I didn't use the full 3 cups of flour, and 3) I used rapid rise yeast. I also used this to make bread sticks rather than a pizza base.

I'm probably an idiot, but I could not make this work. I made it PRECISELY as directed and ended up with an immovable ball of clay. I threw it away and started over following some suggestions. It was edible but still touch, not pliable and elastic like every other bread dough I'eve ever made.

I love this recipe! It will be my go-to pizza dough recipe from here on out. Super simple, I followed the ingredients and directions precisely and started to panic a little when our Kitchenaid Mixer wasn't forming the ingredients into a dough. Well, just about a minute or two later it really came together! Perfect sized dough, super easy to roll out and it was enough dough to fill out our very large round pizza pan. The dough itself rose beautifully when baked into a thick crust and tastes much better than store-bought. In the future I will add different herbs for additional flavour. Thank you!

I have 3 young children and pizza is a favorite, so I've tried many pizza crust recipes.  Nothing is easier or quicker - and it still tastes good!  We even served it to 25 guests for a Superbowl pizza party with rave reviews!

Substitute 1/2 cup of the flour for 1/2 cup of oat bran for a healthier dough.  Adds a subtle but very nice flavor too without changing the consistency of the dough at all!

This recipe is awesome!  Best at home pizza we've ever had.  My teenagers can even make it themselves.  They split the dough in two halves and make their own individual pizzas for a quick afternoon snack.

This dough is better if it's rolled out a little thinner. If it's too thick, it comes out far too bready. It's a great simple dough though. Will make again.

Just made this dough. I came home late today and the kids had a friend over. When they saw me they asked if they could have pizza! Didn't have a pizza dough in the freezer so used this recipe and judging by what's left, I think they liked it..!!! I altered the yeast mix though- gave it a bit time to proof. So what I did was poor 1/2 of lukewarm water into the yeast and add2 1/2 tbsp. of flower. I set that aside to rest for 12-13 mins until it was foamy.  As fas as baking is concerned I baked it in a aluminum baking pan and it turned out really soft and pretty much doubled in size...!  With some mozzarella slices on top, some pecorino and some fresh basil leaves it was perfect!  Def. will make it again if the kids ask for pizza..!!

This recipe was absoutely as quick and easy as it says. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Crust was beautiful and tasty. Thank you for sharing. Oh by the way, this was my very first homemade pizza dough. I am forever grateful.

Delicious and easy but you can easily make this for two pizzas. It will stretch for sure. I had to add a 1/2 cup of water more than it called for. Try adding rosemary or any herbs you'd like! Yum!

My family loved it.  Very easy to prepre, as it is very similar to making french bread, expect you don't allow the dough to rise.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars even though I changed it up a bit.  I did everthing the same except I used olive oil and added italian seasoning and I let the dough rise for a little while.  I didn't realize making pizza was this easy!  I'll be making my own pizza more often :)

i can't believe anyone could complain about this recipe.  it's quick, easy, and adaptable.  i used the olive oil and herbs, and i did dissolve the yeast in warm water, but it seems like this works out great no matter what you do, which makes this a 5 star recipe.  add whatever flavor you like and make it your own.  perfect!

This was my 1st time making pizza. I followed the recipe exactly. It looked just like the pizza doughs I see at the bakeries. I added 1 egg and an egg yolk just because it seemed too dry; I addded as much extra flour as I needed for a workable dough. I thought it wouldn't turn out right because I changed the recipe..but IT DID!!!....my pizza was big and raised high! It was yuuuuuumy!!!!...I give this recipe more than 5 stars!!!.....at least 10 stars!!!!

I'm sure this is a great quick recipe.  But its an awesome "wait and rise" recipe.   I added basil, oregano, parsley to the dry ingrediants.  Dissolved sugar and yeast in warm water.  I let it sit for about 30 min before kneading it and let it sit for another 90 minutes (husband late for dinner).... and it was perfect.  Try brushing the rim of the dough with egg white prior to baking for that golden look.

Turned out good.  I put the yeast in the water with sugar because I wasn't sure if it was still active.  I followed other suggestions and let the dough rise and pre-bake for 5 minutes.  I will use this recipe again.

this recipe is so super easy! i love that i don't have to do a ton of prep work or think about making it way in advance. i can just whip it up, just as the recipe says, and it's ready in about 30 minutes from start to finish. i didn't believe when i first read the recipe that you could do pizza dough in so few steps but it is true! i just brush some olive oil on the crust and sprinkle some garlic on that and it is delish. i also used olive oil the last time i made it instead of veg because that's what i had and it worked just fine. try it!

Excellent recipe and VERY quick.  I agree if people are after more then they should not use this recipe.  The whole idea of this recipe is for it to be quick.

I did everything wrong with this, I didn't read the instructions and I didn't measure anything, but it came out the best crust I've ever made

I loved this recipe. It was tasty and so very simple. Great way to get dinner on the table in under an hour. The only thing I'd suggest is letting the dough rest for just 5 minutes or so. It makes it a little easier to work with

This was perfect!! I made few changes (added herbs, let the the dough sit for an hour b4 baking) just cos I had time that night, but based on other reviews doesn't look like it's necessary.   FYI - This produced a slightly thicker crust though I spread it thin...will modify next time to make it thin crust, which i personally prefer.

Best pizza dough I have ever prepared for my family.  I found that after I topped it and let it set on the counter for 10 minutes it became much fluffier/thicker, or bake right away for a thinner crust.

I love this dough. As suggested I used olive oil in place of vegetable oil and added some dried or fresh herbs. It's great if you don't have a lot of time on hand and it's way better than the stuff out of the can.

Super quick and super easy. Took longer to find a quick and easy recipe than it did to actually make the pizza. Thanks again. I will tweak it a bit, adding some herbs and garlic next time... when I have more time!

I loved it! All i did was use olive oil instead of veggie oil and i added some oregano. Lazy me even put it in the breadmaker, selected the dough setting and let the machine do the kneading... ;-) Will probably stick with this recipe from now on! Thank you!

This crust is definitely a 4 1/2 stars as written, but with the suggestions of adding 1 tsp of basil, 1 tsp garlic powder, reducing the flour to 2 1/2 cups, plus i myself, adding a bit of parmesan and romano cheese and cooking the crust at least 5 minutes before adding any toppings, this is easily a 5 star recipe!! My only complaint is that i did not get my crust crispy, crunchy enough for my own personal taste...but this is my first time making it and i am quite sure with a few more attempts i will have mastered  that as well...try this recipe and i am sure you will agree!!

Great recipe!  I found it quick to make and throw into the oven, which I really needed.  I was even surprised by taste as it didn't take near the prep time that other dough recipes I have used.

I didn't have great luck with this. It just had no flavor, it probably needs a bit more salt or sugar or maybe even some basil. Maybe I'll try it again, and I get that it is easy but i still think it's missing some directions (like kneading...)

I came across this today, looking for an easy pizza crust that I could throw together in a snap. This one worked perfectly. I would definitely recommend adding some seasoning to the crust. We just threw in some garlic and kept the other ingredients the same. Excellent! Thank you for sharing!

If you follow these direction you will get a very quick and easy to make pizza crust.  The taste isn't crazy amazing or anything, but it is very simple to make!  I was out of bread dough for my bread machine, which is how I usually make pizza dough.  All I had was all-purpose flour and I used this recipe with success.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe. I wouldn't make it again. If you don't want to take the time to make pizza dough the right way you should just buy some pre-made. I've seen it at walmart for $.88. All you have to do is roll it out.

This was an awesome dough! I did reduce the flour to 2.5 cups and let it rest for 10-15 minutes. I then used the dough for grilled pizzas. The Family was happy and full!

It comes out smoother if you mix all ingredients but flour first and then add flour a little at a time. Very quick and easy!

Great recipe when you need a fast pizza!  Definately not like the traditional pizza crust taste. It was still delicious and EASY! Doubled the recipe and made two large think crust pizzas.  One was cheese the other one was a "green" pizza.  Pesto, spinach, roasted bell pepper, and feta.  THe kids loved both.

Simple pizza dough recipe!!! Turned out great. I added some garlic, and italian seasoning to the dough. I also covered the dough with a Tablesoon of EVOO and it spread out very nicly on the cookie sheet. It didn't even stick to my hands! I will use this recipe over and over.

Oh My Goodness!! We have fresh pizza faster than we could have had it delivered! No more than 30 minutes from start to finish and my 3 and 5 year old daughters were helping me! (could have been faster otherwise). :D  Thanks for this great easy recipe!!

I have made this twice now and I have found that with other reviews' suggestions that it makes a good dough.  The first time, I followed the directions and it came out flat and tough.  The 2nd time, I kneaded the dough for about 10 minutes in my KitchenAid then let it rise for 30 minutes.  Much better!  Both times I added spices, garlic, thyme, oregano.  Good recipe if you're in a hurry, but I think I will try to make pizza dough only when I have the time to do it right.

Awesome pizza dough recipe! Unless you like super thick crust, I would suggest separating it to 2 pizzas. I used a regular circular pizza pan and found the crust too thick.

This is a really good quick and easy recipe. I did one pizza dough using my bread machine, but that takes up to 1.5 hours. So while that one was going, I did this one. Both pizzas turned out great. I will use again for sure!

For time & effort, I thought it was GREAT & super easy.  Our family all gave it a thumbs up.  It's a great starter base and can easily be spruced up w/ some seasonings.  I used 1/2 WW flour & 1/2 white flour to make it a bit 'healthier'.

I did not care for this recipe. What this has to do with pizza dough? Tastless, breaking like a dump cracker. And yes, yeast needs time grow. You can't cheat here.

Pretty good.  yes, it would probably be better if you let it rise and did all the normal pizza dough stuff, but  this recipe is designed to be quick.  Next time I'll bake it a bit longer--it was a bit dense, but I think that's bc I didn't give it enough time in the oven.  I used the dough for Black Bean and Spinach Pizza on this site and it was great.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great quick and easy pizza crust.  Family enjoyed it.  I followed the directions, and just subbed EVOO for the oil, and used cornmeal on the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking.

This was so easy.   My 11 year old son wanted to make homemade pizza and this was JUST perfect, he did it all by himself!  The only thing different we had to do was sprinkle a little flour when rolling so it did not sick.   We loved it!!!!!

This was great. The dough came together really nicely. I made two 16" pizzas with one recipe. I substituted olive oil because I did not have vegetable oil. Otherwise followed the recipe. Fed our large family of 6!

this is a great recipe for a quick easy crust! there are lots of things i will do differently next time I am planning on making pizza, but when my first attempt at dinner fails and I know I have cheese in the fridge this will be my old reliable. I may proof the yeast next time and see how that goes. My husband was happy, so it's a keeper!

Very easy and tasty dough.  I agree with other reviews that this is meant to be a simple dough.  Must admit, though, that I add some extra garlic and italian seasonings to the flour mixture and salt, make a well in the middle and then add the water, sugar and yeast.  Let it sit for 10 mintues while I prep the veggies, then ad the oil and mix.  The yeast is activated and I can let it rise as a dough if I have time, or just pop it in the oven if in a rush.  Still yummy.

Fantastic and easy recipe!!!  I've made it a few times now and have learned that I need to bake the crust first until lightly browned, then add the toppings and bake until the cheese is melted and slightly browned.  Otherwise the crust remains a bit too doughy.

This is a very good and easy recipe.  I like it that the crust came out very nice and thin and crispy.  Although I did add a couple of extra ingredients to it like other reviewers suggested.  Add oregano, sugar, italian seasoning, parsley....

It's definately quick and easy to make. It reminded me of an old "stir and roll" recipe I used to make. However, I prefer the taste of frozen bread dough for a shell compared to this.

Thanks Gudny for the recipe! Yes folks, there are many different styles of crust. If you are looking for one that has to be kneeded and rise and takes hours to prepare.... THIS IS NOT IT. What this is though, is a very good, simple, speedy recipe for crust that you can make and be eating in under an hour! I made as written, and yes, ALL the directions are there don't try to make this harder than it is people!! I coupled it with Easy Pizza Sauce III which is also terrific, and surprised the family with pizza in about 45 minutes. No more store bought dough, frozen or take and bakes at my house!!  This is way too easy  :)  Thanks again!

This pizza dough was absolutely delicious! My boyfriend and I made it for a nice, deep-dish pizza last night. The only alterations we made, as per another reviewer's suggestion, was to add 1 Tbsp. Garlic powder and 1 Tbsp. oregano. Other than that, followed the recipe to a "T."  It was perfection. Thanks so much!

GREAT PIZZA CRUST!  My family loves the flavor of this crust -- I love how easy it is!  I've made it dozens of times now.  Sometimes I use it right away.  Other times, I will knead it and let it rise.  Either way, it's delicious!  I also have made it with the olive oil; sometimes have added the Italian seasonings, as well.  Thank you for sharing!

Good for what it is.  This dough is fast, easy to handle, and tastes good.  It does not create that luscious stretchy holey crust you find at a great pizzeria, but I've never been able to recreate that at home anyway.  This is shorter/cakier than my favorite crusts, but the trade-off in prep time will sometimes be worth it.  Heartily approved by children and in-laws.

This recipe was not too bad, considering that you didn't have to wait for the dough to rise.  The dough was just a tad dense, but over all not too bad.  I would totally recommend this recipe if you don't have a lot of time and need a tastey pizza.

I was hopeful when I read this recipe. Skeptical when I made it. But pleased when I tasted it. No changes neccessary. This is a good go-to for pizza in a hurry.

Also would like to add to the review from Kim, it helps to sprinkle your stone or pizza pan with a light coating of cornmeal to prevent burning and/or sticking :) My rating is based on my results with the suggested touchups!

Dough was a little tough but it was certainly good for the speed and ease at which it is made. I used a rolling pin to try to even out the dough and it worked pretty well. Likely will make again.

Easy and simple to make.  This is a basic recipe and I can see where you can tweak this to make it what works best for you. I used this with the Unbelievably Awesome Barbeque Chicken Pizza from this site and it was very good. Thanks for sharing.

30 minutes. Pizza from scratch. Please don't review this recipe unless you make it as directed! yes! it's really THAT easy! Mix your dry ingredients (if you must make changes add some herbs such as basil or italian seasoning or garlic powder - about a tsp of each). Then add you liquids. I let my kitchenaide knead the dough for me for about 5 minutes so I have time to get all my toppings ready. Top and Bake. SO easy it should be illegal.

A great big THANK YOU for this recipe! I've tried dozen of recipes for pizza dough, and this one is by far the best. I've tried it both ways (with and without the extra time and effort) and actually prefer it without the rising. The crust is crispy on the bottom, but cooked all the way through (i can't stand a really bready crust). THANKS AGAIN!

This was great!  Far better than frozen.  It's not as fancy or deep-dished-delicious as a risen dough, but it was superb and FAST!  A family staple.

This dough tastes great and is easy to make.  I made it twice, and the second time, I rolled it out very thin, which made it less "bready".

Very good quick pizza crust. I love preparing this with finely chopped garlic and basil mixed in. Good texture for a quick pizza dough.

You can make changes to this recipe like other reviewers, but the point of the recipe is how easy and quick it is.  This dough tastes great the way it is.  I definitely recommend this especially if you are short on time.

This was wonderful!! I am pregnant so when something sounds good I want it right away, this was perfect. I added some spices and  I did add a little extra water and oil because I didn't feel like there was enough. But seriously the texture and density was great! Thank you!!

this pizza dough is too good to be true. i doubled the recipe exactly, put everything in my 5 quart mixer with dough hook attachment and let it go for about 5 minutes. it forms a nice ball, not too sticky and can be handled right away.

Too good to be true.  I was suspicious that this recipe would be good after looking at it, but tried it any way.  I didn't alter the recipe at all.   It was not good, tasted like flour and water with a horrible texture. Gave it 2 stars instead of one because my 6 year old would eat it.  The only think I think may have affected the outcome was possibly altitude (I live at 4,800 ft).  From now on I will take a little extra time and use a more traditional recipe.

I had so much fun making this!  It was fantastic. I did proof the yeast and let it rise twice, mostly so I can finally say I had a good experience with yeast...yay!  Only things I did different were, swap for olive oil and add sprinkles of garlic powder and black pepper to the crust.  For the pizza, I used Italian flavored pasta sauce instead of plain jane tomato sauce to enhance the flavor and I used leftover pineapple chunks and ham deli meat, chopped those and made my favorite pizza...hawaiian!  Also added in a leftover portion of an onion.  I threw on some dry basil on top of the cheese for good measure but honestly the tomato sauce was flavorful enough.   I might try this one next time with no proofing so I can compare, or I might be in a pizza making mode again and do it the hard way, either way all I know is...there WILL be a next time! :)

If you like a dense crust this recipe is perfect as is.  I took the advice of others and made it just as it is written (with the addition of powdered garlic) and it turned out wonderfully for the 5 min of preparation!

We really like thin crust, so this was perfect as I was in a time crunch.  I did add about 1/4 c. water as it was too dry without.  May try the other suggestions when I have more time.

I've made this dough quite a few times and the whole family loves it. The recipe is quick and easy. I should mention that I live in Japan and  the consistency of the flour is like a cross between bread flour & pastry flour--quite different from all-purpose flour that I'm used to. That may be the reason my dough doesn't come out as doughy & thick as others who reviewed this recipe have mentioned.

This really surprised me! My husband picked the recipe so I wasn;t sure. I usually make a Whole wheat dough, but didn't have the time.  I threw this together quickly. Rolled it out and there we were. It was easy to roll out not too sticky. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the dough was still a little doughy for me after 25 minutes but my cheese was getting too brown. We're going to try it again tonight and I plan on adding a few dry herbs to the dough before adding the liquid and baking the dough about 5 minutes before adding the sauce and toppings. I like my crust a combination of crispy and chewing.  We will continue to use this for our quick recipe. Otherwise my whole wheat recipe we use (see heather's whole wheat pizza dough)

I did let this rise for awhile, but other than that followed the original recipe.  Was simple, tasty, and for those that want to do more - makes a great jumping off point in terms of adding spices, etc.  Good basic pizza dough.  Thanks!

This did not come out well for us.  If you are looking for a quick crust, I recommend "Crazy Crust" (another recipe here that is quick and easy and our family really enjoys)

Super fast and pretty tasty. Of course its not as good as it could be, but we're sacrificing a bit of flavor for speed. Adding a little seasoning or herbs help, as does using a really good pizza sauce.

This crust was EXCELLENT!  I'm the type to decide at the last minute to have pizza, so this crust is perfect for us.  I threw the dry ingredients into my kitchenaid bowl, whisked them a little to make sure they were mixed, added the warm water & oil, & used the dough hook for 10 minutes while I assembled toppings. I spread it in the pan with my hands as thin as I could & it turned out great because it rose so much as it baked. This one's a keeper!

OK. I made this dough tonight and it was great...but its missing something...I cant quite put my finger on it. I'm going to try butter instead of oil on the next batch I make.  Dont get me wrong its delicious...but its missing something.

This dough is fabulous!!!!!!!!! I am waiting for the bread pan in my bread maker to be replaced, so I thought I would do it by hand with this recipe. Wow - it's great!! The crust holds up very well after baked with all of the toppings and it doesn't become limp or soggy afterwards. I agree with other reviewers that the crust doesn't have much "taste", however I don't eat pizza for the crust. Its the sauce & toppings that make a pizza taste great. When I made pizza dough in the bread maker, I used beer instead of water. When I made this recipe for the first time, I did it exactly as is except only used 2 1/2 cups of flour. Next time, I'm going to try the beer in this recipe!! I can hardly imagine that it could get any better! Thanks for this fantastic recipe!! I'm using this one from now on!

Awesome! I was really skeptical about this recipe... But It works! I did knead the dough for a few minutes. My family thought this was the best pizza dough, better even than my usual knead 10 min and rise 1 hr dough. So this is our new recipe. Thanks!!

I added a little bit of seasonings and made the recipe as is.  The crust was tasty and fast but not like a real pizza crust.  It's ok if you're in a dinner pinch but I think I'll stick with the old fashioned crust from now on.

This was my first attempt at making pizza dough and it was fine.  I wouldn't say it was great, but for the ease of the recipe I'm giving it 4 stars.  I happened to have some basil infused olive oil, so I used that instead of Veg oil.  Other than that I stuck w/the recipe as is.  My son liked it, hubby not so much.  It's more of a bready consistency, which isn't bad but it isn't like pizzeria dough.  Anyway, would I make it again? Not too sure. Might try a more timely dough next time, or just go to the local pizzeria and buy the dough like I usually do. It was nice to make my own, just to try it. Thanks for sharing.

Thought this was very tasty but the amount of flour should be reduced as there wasn't enough liquid to integrate the 3 cups.  I think 2 1/2 cups would probably be about right.

This is the recipe I have used for YEARS!!! I do knead it for 10 minutes and let it rise - just how I do it. After I seperate the dough and roll it onto my two pans, I do let it rise a bit more to thicken the crust. This is way better than Delivery!  The best sauce to use is Contadina pizza sauce, too! Try this several times - my dough never turns out the same way twice - sometimes the yeast makes a difference if it doesn't turn out!

The best and easiest pizza dough recipe out there!  Anybody can make these, even a 2 year old.  I have followed the recipe to a tee with awesome results and have also let the dough rise multiple times and it doesn't make a big difference.  I always add a teaspoon of Italian seasoning & a 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt to give it a little more flavor.  SO GOOD!!!!

This crust is perfect - crispy on the outside, just chewy on the inside. I did allow the yeast to proof with the sugar for about 5 - 10 min, and only needed about 2 cups flour. Let this rise for at least 30 minutes, punch down dough and roll it out as the crust. I added some herbs per other reviews and it turned out great.

Great stuff. If you use milk instead of water you get a little more crisp and browning but recipie as is is delicious.

Not real happy with this dough.  For one, it calls for too much flour (maybe 2-1/2 cups would be about right).  It was very difficult to spread in the pan, certainly couldn't just pat it out - had to get out my roller to get it to do anything.  Once baked, it was more like a dense biscuit dough than pizza dough.  I don't think the yeast had a chance to do anything at all.  It might be quick, but not really worth it.

Mega Easy and even fun to make.  Pizza dough has always seemed like such a chore to me....but this recipe is really fast and even fun.  We made a whole wheat version by substituting one cup of all purpose flour for only one cup of whole wheat flour.  AWESOME!

This was a hit in our house.  I let the yeast disovle in the water for 10 mins. and let the dough rise for 30 minutes.  I will definitely be making this again.

Tasteless and WAY too dense. I even added some brushed on melted butter, herbs to the dough as it was being mized, and it still came out extremely bland. Plus, as was mentioned in most of the negative comments, the texture of it is just way off. I won't be making this again.

We really like this recipe but we let the dough rest for about an hour and the pizza was ALOT better! We also add oregano, basil & rosemary to the dough & it adds a subtle but good flavor to the pizza. This recipe is good for bread sticks too!!

Very easy and delicious. The crust is just slighty chewy so if you want it to be crisper try cooking the pizza on a ceramic pizza stone.  The only thing I do differently is I double the sugar and let it rise for about an hour and a half.

Fantastic recipe!! I make the dough before I start prepping the pizza toppings. By the time everything is ready to go the dough has rised just a little. Turns out perfect every time! Wonderful wonderful wonderful and so simple.

Made this as is, then with half white half wheat flour, turned out great both times!  As for adding garlic and italian spices I add those to the sauce so this recipe stands on it's own for me.  Great for weeknights!

Excellent for easy pizza in a pinch! I used my bread maker on the dough cycle, for an hour instead of the 1 1/2 hour it usually runs. Added a Tbsp. of honey and Tsp. of Italian seasoning.  Really glad I tried this!

It does the job when you have little time.  I'd rather spend the extra time for a risen dough though.  I added garlic and basil to the dough.  Like, not love.

I used this to make bread sticks and they were OKAY. The dough was more dense and chewy than I prefer though. good in a pinch. I like recipes that rise because you get more dough for your buck.

From flour to pizza in under an hour? And it didn't taste like cardboard. Fantastic. I made it exactly as recipe stated. Will be a staple when I'm in a hurry and family wants pizza.'
Update: still a great recipe...needs a little more flavor, maybe more salt and a seasoning? Anyway, my 12 soon to be 13 yo SON make this for dinner for us and it was fabulous!

I LOVE the simplicity of this recipe.  I can whip it up and make a quick dinner or special lunch for my toddler and husband when short on time.  It's great just as it is.

I made this exactly as written except added some garlic powder and oregano to dough.  Mixed it all together with my hands and spread it out, put the sauce and other ingredients on top, and baked.  Worked perfectly just as written. Very easy to make and with ingredients always have on hand anyway.  Gets 5 star for ease in making but only 4 star for taste.  Was good tasting just not quite 5 star.

Made this last night for friends that came over. They loved it and talked me into making another pie! For never having made pizza dough before it came out quick, easy, and best of all great tasting! I did add the extra spices that others mentioned. Between pizzas and bread, I guess it's time for a baking stone!!

A quick and easy pizza dough recipe that makes a nice thick dough.  I did proof the yeast only because I can't imagine not doing so.  I also added italian seasoning, onion powder and garlic powder.  This will become a staple.

Great....for a fast pizza dough recipe.   I used 1 cup whole wheat and 2 cups all purpose flour.   This made enough for 2 large THIN crust pizzas.  I plan to cut the recipe in half next time.

Great in a pinch. If you want something better - you'll need more time. But I think that's why this recipe is cool; it's QUICK and SIMPLE. Actually, it tastes just like that dough mix that's included in the Chef Boyardee pizza kits, if you've ever had those. I usually make a different, more involved, pizza dough but I needed to make one fast, as I had company coming over for dinner. It got the job done.

Love Love LOVE this dough! For many years I've been buying a premade dough from my grocery stores bakery. I decided I'd always wanted to try it from scratch but thought it would be too hard. This is an extremely easy recipe and it wotked out great. Never will I buy dough from the store. One tip i have is to proof the yeast for ten mins first. thsts it though. WONDERFUL recipe.

This just went like "clockwork". Made the dough as directed, spread it immediaately, topped with a canned pizza sauce, home-prepared sausage and mushrooms, and baked it right away.  Very good, no problems, well received. I will try different sauces, to try to find a favorite.

As an American living in rural Romania, good pizza is hard to find.  This was PERFECT.  It was my first time working with yeast and this made it seem easy.  I added garlic and some spices, kneaded it, and let it rise (just while the oven heated), as suggested by other reviewers.  Thanks for a taste of home!

I made this exactly as stated- just mixed it together and patted the dough on my pizza stone. It was wonderful. From 'what's for dinner? to eating in  30 minutes... the pizza delivery person can't even get me pizza that fast!! Very nice!

Great base recipe!  I substituted the vegetable oil for olive oil to give the dough a richer flavor (a little extra flour needed so dough isn't too sticky), and I added some dried basil and oregano to the crust.  For the topping, I spread some olive oil and jarred minced garlic on top.  Then I put slices of tomato, chunks of marinated mozzarella cheese and a little sea salt and black pepper on top.  It was a real hit!

Stellar, easy recipe. I've had best results when I let the dough rise, but when I proof the yeast it' terrible. Don't know why? But this dough is fast, easy to work with, and is so much fun to play around with and customize. Excellent recipe!

This recipe is fast and easy so I can make it at the last minute. I toss everything into my bread machine and let it make the dough for me. I also substitute 1/2 whole wheat flour for the amount called for. It turns out great every time and my family loves it.

Was a very easy crust to made, and I was able to stretch it into a fairly large baking pan easily. The only thing is I felt like I had too much dough, cause it was very thick and when my pizza was finished the crust almost seemed foccacia like. Good thing to note though, I accidentally put too much oregano into my dough and the dough came out tasting very good! Will definitely use again.

This is one of the easiest pizza crusts I've ever made! I've made quick crusts before that don't require yeast but they are always so dense. This one is nice and chewy. I coated the crust with oil and pizza seasonings for extra flavor but only because I had the time. This crust is great just the way it is when in a time crunch!!

This was a great recipe.  While, it's not gourmet-style crust, it's absolutely fabulous for a regular old meal and my family loved it.  It was a total no-brainer.  I put the ingredients in my mixer and let the dough hook go to town on it and just kind of forgot about it for a while, then took it out and made some great pizza.  If everyone had an easy recipe like this on file, a lot less people would be ordering out.

This was so much easier than any other recipes for pizza dough I could find. I did it exactly as the recipe calls for, the only difference was I also used Olive Oil as opposed to vegetable oil. I also added some garlic powder, basil and oregano for flavoring. It was so simple and DELICIOUS.

I threw mine in the breadmaker on the dough setting and let it sit until we were ready to use it. I had time on my hands, so started it early. It rises wonderfully and has an amazing taste!! My family raved about it!

We did not care for this pizza dough. Even though it is quick it still needs to be good.  It was very dry and bland and i even added fresh diced garlic, oregano, kosher salt,  butter and parmesean cheese on top.  Will not make again.

This recipe is meant to be simple and easy which it is exactly that. This pizza dough recipe is actually on the back of most yeast packages with one difference, the added sugar. A special touch that I recommend is when the pizza gets close to being done, spread a mixture of olive oil, garlic salt or powder, and parsley on the crust to make it nice and flavorful.

I love this recipe!! I like being able to decide that I want pizza and not have to wait for dough to rise. I make this atleast once a week.  I add about 1 tsp of oregano and 1/3 tsp of garlic powder... not sure about the oregano and garlic measurments because I just freehand it. Adding those two things makes the dough soo tasty! oh also *the temperature of the water makes a big difference on how flaky the dough comes out. The warmer the better.  I also let the yeast sit in the water whithout stirring while I prepare the toppings.

Giving it 5 stars because it saved me today.  Daughter wanted homemade pizza and I didn't have a lot of time to spare.  Easy, easy, easy.  I did add some herbs and spices to it, but only because I wanted to.  With all the toppings, you probably couldn't really tell. I'm sure there are better crusts out there, but this was what worked for me today and I will use it many times again.

My son wanted pizza on his first day back to school. We whipped this up without any changes. I put all the ingredients into a big bowl, stirred with a pastry cutter. 
The ONLY change I made was a suggestion of someone was I baked it for 5 min (approx) then added my toppings! It was MUCH better than the last time I made when I added a bunch of herbs etc to it. 
From start to finish we were eating in 35 min -- homemade pizza! LOVE IT!

I was so excited to try this recipe due to the great reviews, but some how it came out tasting like a biscuit. It was also flaky like one to. I dont know what went wrong.I followed the directions just like it stated. The only diffrnce was i only had self rising flour not all purpose.

I needed a last minute recipe and this was the only one you didn't have to let rise. My husband and 1 year old loved it. It was perfect for what I needed and my husband says we're never ordering out pizza again.

Quick and easy.  I prefer thicker dough, but it tasted great.  It had a cracker type crust for me.  I rolled it with a rolling pin after I banged it into shape.  I also cooked it on 400 degrees for about 20 minutes.  I'm sure this affected the texture.  (Crispy)  I am giving 5 stars due to the fact that I didn't have to go to the store, (Had everything I needed.) and taste.  Now i can make pizza any time.  Awesome!

I loved this recipe!  As a parent, I'm always looking for ways to sneak healthy ingredients into whatever I'm cooking so I did everything exactly the same, but added 3 Tbsp of flax seed.  (I do it with just about anything 'doughy')  My family LOVED this recipe (plus my secret ingredient) and we will definitely be using this over and over.  So easy and economical!

I love the quickness of the recipe - just mix everything and throw on the toppings, and then into the oven it all goes!  I did proof the yeast first, just because I was taught to do that with any yeast dough.  But that only added 5 mins into the entire recipe.

Wow, this is a fabulous recipe. I made two pizzas out of it, a cheese pizza and a dessert pizza (just mix in about 1/2 -1 cup of sugar, and cinnomon to taste, spread 2 cans of store bought frosting, top with whatever cookie or candy you want, and voila, dessert pizza!). Everyone loved it! =) Best ever pizza dough!

I love this dough. It makes for a perfectly crisp pizza crust and it's so simple! I made it according to the recipe but did end up letting it rise in a greased bowl covered with plastic wrap for about an hour, as I wasn't ready to roll out the dough after I completed the recipe. I would have been good either way! Makes a perfect 1/2 sheet of pizza after the hour long rise. Delicious!

Fabulous!  I made it exactly as the recipe states then made it several times with variations like proofing, rising time, etc. All are good but the original recipe is perfect as is. this will be my #1 pizza dough recipe from now on.

It is a great easy quick crust. My mother-in-law helped and was so worried because it was nothing like the doughs she has made. When it was done though she was amazed that it actually worked, LOL.

Reviewers, please read: THIS IS A FAST RECIPE. I REPEAT. THIS IS A FAST RECIPE. Do not add your "modifications" that include letting the dough rise for an hour. That's ANOTHER recipe, not this one. This is not the best pizza dough, but if you have a couple hungry kids, and no time to wait for a 1-hour + rise, then this is a GOOD pizza dough. I do add 1tbsp of basil to my crust and I usually use a garlic olive oil. That's it. I have a whole other recipe I use when I have time to make proper dough, but this one has a specific purpose, and it's really  to add rise-times to this recipe. Nuff said.

I needed a quick recipe for a simple pizza crust and that's exactly what I got! I'm glad it didn't have step, after step, after step with tons of ingredients. It was easy and FUN to make and my kids (and husband) loved it. No more buying pizza crust mix, I'll use this recipe from now on. It's better!!

I loved it, and so did my 4 and 8 year old brothers. I would sugest adding a pinch of baisle and garlic powder. But only if you like more flavor.

Excellent!! It took about 5 min to gather ingredients, dump in my kitchenaid mixer, and viola. I used a regular sized pizza pan and hubby and I loved the thickness. Next time I might slide off on to oven rack for the last 5 min of baking to crisp up bottom. I love the fact you don't have to waite for it to rise, making this a perfect weeknight meal!

I had a lot of difficulty cutting my pie! It was a ittle too tough. Next time i will be sure to roll out the pie very thinly or maybe even treat the yeast with some warm water and letting it rise for a little bit. Maybe adding oil on the outside.

Very yummy!!  I had another homemade pizza dough recipe I used to use, but it involved kneeding and rising time.  It also tended to come out with a crunchy, thin crust.  This pizza was nice and soft!  Less time and better flavor than the old one.  We're making it again tonight!

I subbed half whole wheat flour for the all purpose. I also proofed the yeast. I rolled the dough out thin and it was perfectly crunchy and chewy.

Incredible recipe!  I've tried many dough recipes and have never been as satisfied as I am with this one.  Made it exactly and was thrilled with the ease of rolling it out - it was smooth as silk and didn't fight me at all.  Got it about 18" in diameter and my pan is about 15, so I cut strips of cheese and rolled it into the excess for a stuffed crust! BTW I sprinkled semolina in the pan generously, really added to the nice chew. When I make it again (maybe right now!) my only adjustment will be to up the salt by a pinch.  Thanks for providing this winner!

It wasn't necessarily bad, but it didn't quite turn out like the picture.  It did make a quick pizza dough though.  Probably will not try again.

This is the first time that I have ever tried to make a pizza crust from scratch. I have to say that it may be the best that I have ever had. I am not a great cook but I did manage to complete this recipe without too much hassle or drama! I pressed this recipe into a 13" pan which made this seem somewhere between a deep dish and thin crust. I really liked it because it was both crunchy and chewy. Also, the flavor was great. I must admit that I put a teaspoon of whole thyme in the recipe. I liked it but it might be a little strong for many. Still, I will probably tweek this over the years; yet, this will be my recipe for pizza crust from here on.

Tastes good and super easy to make. I found using a rolling pin worked best to roll out the dough onto the pan. Thanks for the recipe!

I think this recipe it great. Pizza dough always seems to fail me. This was a success on the first try. The only suggestion I followed was dissolving the yeast and sugar in 1 cup warm water.

I made these in two flavours: Oregano and sunflower seed (Very yummy) and I made a raisen and basil version (Savoury and yummy), I made both with olive oil instead of vegitable oil. It was quick and easy and barely left a mess, thanks :)

Ok, I made two pizzas tonight.  One I didn't add all the oil, just a screw up and it came out thin and crispy...very awesome.  The other one was not as crispy, but just as awesome. I used Olive oil instead of veg.  I think there should be more salt and less sugar.  I plan to use this one again!  Oh, make sure to cure the yeast in warm water not the 110 degree water.  The thin crispy crust was with the 110 degree water and it didn't rise at all.  I made the dough and let it rise while I got the rest done and the oven preheated.  Worked well.

Great recipe, the only changes I made were to add 1 tsp of Italian seasoning and a little garlic salt to the dry ingredients and dissolved the yeast in the water before putting it in. I also used olive oil instead of veg. oil. I let it rise for about 20 min before making my pizza! It made a huge pizza and it came out awesome!!

I will never use another pizza dough recipe or store-bought version again! This recipe is SO simple and it tastes wonderful. It makes a nice thick crust. I love it especially with my hawaiian pizza and buffalo chicken pizza. I really recommend trying this recipe at least once.

I took someone else's suggestion an added the yeast to the water then added it to the flour.  I thought this pizza dough was fantastic since it's quick and easy to make.  I made it just like the recipe calls for, at first I thought it needed more water but it was perfect.  I used a pizza stone and found that I needed to bake it for another 5 minutes.

I agree that this recipe is fabulous AS IS! I added some thyme, but that's it! I also split the dough in half and made a second pizza covered only with melted margarine and garlic topped with parmesan cheese(I pulled the second pizza out half way through and added the butter/garlic/cheese topping and then put it back in for the remainder of the time). It was AWESOME!

This dough is perfectly simple and will save you a bundle on pre-made pizza crusts in the store.  I like to experiment and add herbs to the dry ingredients if I don't have a large variety of toppings.

Considering it didn't take 1-2 hours to make this dough, I was very pleased with the results. I made it for a quick "Hawaiian Pizza" lunch and it was great. I was more dense than the average pizza but still very good. Not too thick and not too thin with my 16 in pizza pan.

This was an amazing crust!  I spread the crust on a pizza stone and covered it with a melted butter/garlic mixture.  It really made me look like a chef!

Very simple and easy to throw together on a week night. Not exactly what I wouldd prefer in a crust but if you are in a hurry, this is a great recipe to have on hand. Will use again!

This crust is wonderful IF a)you like thin crust and b)you don't really want any flavors from the crust. It is very plain but very good. If you like a thicker, more flavorful crust, this isn't really the one to make.

This is great for an EASY dough. So quick and simple to make. GREAT last minute meal and I will use this frequently. We've already made it twice in a month and that RARELY happens with anything around here.

for a quick, no rise dough this is very good. Super easy. Don't forget to put oil on your hands so the dough doesn't stick to you! I did use olive oil instead of veg. oil in the dough. I may try adding a little garlic to the crust next time I make it.

This is an easy go-to pizza dough.  There's room for variations, for example, I've tried grating garlic into my dough and other times I've sprinkled about 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese.  The only trouble I had with this dough was the rolling out part.  I found out that kneading the dough after it has risen will make the dough my rigid and difficult to roll out.  I found it easier to roll out the dough as is after it has risen, on a floured countertop of course.

This recipe was very easy and quick to make, which is a big plus when your hungry and want a quick meal. The flavor isn't too bad - a bit on the bland side for me. Having seen some of the other reviews and the other ingredients might help in spicing up the flavor - I'll have to give some of those tips a try.

This is an awesome versatile recipe!  Its great how it is, and even better with different tweaks.  I actually use a cup of whole wheat flour and 2 cups white to make it a tad healthier and the taste is awesome.  I also include about a tablespoon of garlic powder and substitute unsweetened applesauce instead of oil.  I preheat the oven after I'm done mixing it, then set the dough in a covered dish on the oven so it has a few minutes to rise.  After the oven is preheated, I then make up the pizza and it comes out 13 minutes late absolutely delicious!  This is definitely a staple in my house!

Love this - quicker than most pizza doughs, but still delicious. I thought I had rolled it pretty thin, but it still became quite thick in the oven. I made two smaller pizzas in 8-inch cake pans, and baked on 425 for 15 minutes. I did have to add just a spoonful or two of water while the dough was mixing, because it wasn't sticking together. But overall, it's great and I'll definitely make it again!

This is a really good recipe. I have used it several times. I actually used it to make my kids a great breakfast treat this past weekend. I omitted the salt and added a tablespoon of cinnamon. I sliced some apples and softened them in the microwave with some more cinnamon and then layed them out on the crust. Then I made a crumb topping of butter and brown sugar and crumbled it all over the top. We had apple cinnamon crumb pizza and it was very good. Be sure to bake it on a cookie sheet with sides or a deep dish pizza pan in case the apple juice runs.

This Dough was PERFECT! I used it to make pigs in a blanket for the Super Bowl (8 regular sized hot dogs) and everyone LOVED them! I did put too much dough on each so I could have probably made about 10 or 12, but this dough is awesome will def. use again thank you for the recipe!! :-)

The dough came out way too chewy for me.  I'm not sure if I kneaded it too much or not enough.  Either way, next time I'll try a more traditional dough recipe.

I have always been fearful when I need to bake anything with yeast. But now I'm a changed lady. This simple recipe made my day since the first try. An easy recipe for all...whether you are in hurry or just want to try something new.

Worked very well for a dough recipe that doesn't need to rise. It was definitely more of a thin crust and as is the dough (crust) itself isn't really spectacular. But it tasted good with the toppings we added and it saved time so we will definitely use it again for our family.   I may try to take some of the other reviewers' advice on how to give the crust more flavor (with spices) and work with it before serving it to guests.

This was really good! Made according to direction except I used garlic salt (instead of salt) and added a little italian seasoning, for extra flavor.

This was a super easy dough recipe.  I will def use it again for myself but not for friends.  The dough was hard to shape and sticky but I just used flour to keep it from sticking.  Also the crust was very hard, which cut my gums up a little but other than that it was good.  Try being a little creative and adding your own spices to the dough, it def worth it.

this was just okay. I added garlic powder & italian seasoning to the dough & let it raise for about 20 min before flattening.  It was just okay.  I'd make it again if I had ingredients on hand, but wouldn't plan this for dinner.

This pizza dough is very easy to make, it is something that I can quickly put together after I get home from work.  I added a little bit more sugar because I used this with spicy pizza.

I didn't care for this recipe. The dough was very dry, and broke a lot when I put it in my pizza pan, then it came out very dry and tasteless from the oven. It could have been my fault, who knows...

This is fast and it's good. A great recipe when you're short on time. We really liked this. I mixed everything together as directed, subbed EVOO in place of the veg oil and added a bit of garlic powder and Italian seasoning to the dough. Shaped it on parchment paper and let it sit until the oven heated up then pre-baked the crust for about 7 minutes, added toppings and baked again for about 10 minutes. Delicious! Crust has a great texture - it was crunchy, not rubbery or chewy.

This is good stuff!!  My husband made it twice.  The first time was good, the second time was better.  My husband let it sit for awhile and rise and it made the crust even better.  I will keep and continue to make.

Fantastically easy! I made this in the bread machine with 2 tbsp rapid rise yeast and a dash of Italian Seasoning. I substituted the all purpose flour with bread flour and the veggie oil with olive oil - just personal preferences. It tastes great, especially considering how quick it is to make. My boys loved it for lunch, we'll be making this quite frequently now! Thank you for sharing!!

This dough was wonderful, I also added some basil and garlic to the dry mix. It was wonderful though. We are huge pizza eaters and my entire family (picky eaters) loved it and never wants me to order or make any other dough again. thanks for the wonderful recipe..

Very easy and quick. The crust is a thinner style crust which I really like. This recipe is a keeper and I don't need to search any further for a good pizza dough recipe.  Will try adding some herbs the next time.

An excellent fast dough!! I needed a fast pizza dough for a last minute dinner decision and tried this,  Now as an avid baker I had a very hard time not wanting to let this rise but as many reviews prior have indicated-you do not need to let this rise. I was quite amazed how very good the crust was and how easy it was to handle.  A keeper!!

LOOOVVEED IT!! This was simply easy! I made it with my three kids, they had a blast throwing it up in the air ( so did I!). You can leave it as is or spice it up! Perfect either way, we tried whole wheat flour and bread flour, they were all great!! It was my first try ever making pizza dough and I don't feel the need to try any others!! Thanks for this wonderful recipe, we'll certainly use it over and over!!!!

Absolutely agree with all the others this is a great quick and easy recipe, I do not order out anymore plus I don't care for tomato sauce. I did this recipe and added fresh basil from my garden and just drizzled olive oil over my vegies, which consisted of roasted garlic, atrichoke hearts and fresh spinach. Kudos to this recipe.

This is a wonderful dough. I like to add basil, rosemary, and thyme to the dough to give it a bit more flavour (especially since I don't use sauce when I make pizza, instead doing a thin layer of tomatoes under the cheese). It also works wonderfully for focaccia bread with a bit of honey, garlic, and onions mixed in.

This dough turned out really good.  I used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour in place of some of the all purpose.  I also threw it all in my mixer, and kneaded it with the dough hook for a couple of minutes.  This is our new family favorite.  It tasted great, was done in no time, and rolled out really easily.  I pre-baked the dough for about 6 minutes, which results in a crispier crust.  Really good, give it a try!

This is so quick and easy!  It bakes great and tastes great.  The dough rises in the oven! I make this dough all the time.  It's a keeper.

I liked the ease of this recipe, although I did decide to let it rise for about 35-40 minutes before shaping, and I added granulated garlic and Italian seasoning to the recipe. The recipe yielded 3 small thin crust pizzas. We found that it wasn't heavy and it baked up nice and crispy. Would make this again!

Super easy, super delicious! I made no changes whatsoever except I added some Italian spices to the dough. This is my one and only pizza dough recipe from here on out!

This recipe was ok. I made it twice,and both times it came out a little dry. I also added some extra seasoning to the dough. Very easy though! Good post :)

I have always loved making homemade pizza but seldom did it because it took so long that I'd wind up serving dinner at 10pm. Then I discovered this recipe, and I now make it at least twice a month. I can have a great pizza on the table within an hour. It works great just as the recipe reads, but it's even better if you crumble up dried herbs or Parmesan cheese into the flour. I often split off about 20% of the dough so that this makes a personal-sized pizza for my daughter along with a large pizza for the grown-ups, both nice and thin with a great texture. 

For an unconventional pizza treat, brush the crust with pesto, crumble up hard-smoked salmon, and lightly top with the cheese of your choice; feta and goat cheese are both great.

An excellent recipe for quick pizza dough.  You can add in whatever herbs or seasonings you like.  I stretched my dough out to fit on a cookie sheet, baked it for 10 minutes, topped the pizza, and baked for 15 minutes more.  Quite yummy.  At this size it didn't rise a ton, but that's ok since we like a thinner crust.

So easy! I can't believe how easy this dough is to make. Not that normal dough recipes are extremely difficult, but this dough is so convenient. I did let it rise for about an hour or so, and it turned out beautifully. There are better doughs out there, but none as easy as this one.

Was fast, easy and great! Used Olive oil.  I did however take 10 extra minutes and let the yeast dissolve with the sugar before kneading it.  Also added a dash of garlic powder, basil and oregano! Let it rise for 10 minutes and I then had awesome pizza dough!

I have made this several times and it has turned out great! I love it, but I do add garlic salt and Italian seasoning to give it some flavor. The only thing is I would pre-bake the crust for a few minutes before putting on the toppings or the else the dough might end up a little soggy.  Try this recipe!

I really liked the flavor of this crust. the only thing I did was replace veg oil w/olive oil, and added a tbsp of wheat gluten. so easy and I didn't feel like fussing tonight.I pre-baked my crust; usually I have oven @400 for pizza but went w/the recipe and it was perhaps a little white-livered on the bottom. I would use this recipe again for the long method because I liked the flavor of the crust.

Five stars for an easy, great recipe.  I let the yeast bubble in the warm water for a few minutes before adding it to the flour and other ingredients.  I added a little garlic powder and italian seasonings, then kneaded it a bit and rolled it out.  It was very easy and good!

So easy!  This was my first try at pizza dough.  I am blown away by how easy it was!  The dough was great, easy to work with, and didn't stick to anything!  I made a stromboli with it.  I can't wait to try some of the suggestions from other users i.e. mixing seasonings in the dough or bread sticks!

The recipe is very quick an easy but needs an extra 1/4 cup water.  Also, we added a little fresh basil and garlic to the dough for a kick.  If you leave it plain it will be bland.  We used fresh pizza sauce, fresh basil, fresh garlic and fresh pepperoni and it turned out wonderfully!  This is a keeper.

This is my favorite pizza dough recipe by far!  Not only is it quick, but it tastes delicious, is easy to roll out, and makes a nice thick crust.  It's more dense than other crusts, but I think that's because you don't give time for the dough to rise.  Long story short, this is the only pizza dough recipe I plan to use from now on!

I followed the recipe exactly.  I do have to admit I've tasted better dough BUT the key is it was INSTANT dough.  No waiting for it to rise, no waiting for ANYTHING, and that truely is the key.  I also made two mediums out of the suggested 1 large.  We like a thinner crust so it was good.  It rose a bit in the oven, tasty and good.  I LOVE a thick and chewy dough BUT can't eat enough of the pizza to make it worth it.  SO thin it is, then this crust beats all hands down cause its quick AND simple!  Thanks!

Definitely a keeper! Dry active yeast helps this move along fast. I also let my dough rise (after shaping) to do other things before topping the pizza. I split my dough in two nearly 10in pizzas. the only complaint I had was the dough lacking any flavor. I will rub some minced garlic into the crust next time and add more than a tsp of some italian seasoning. the 1 tsp of salt wasn't enough. i baked at 400 degrees, but next time i may broil the pizza because it seemed the 20ish min wasn't long enough to get a crispy crust.

I really liked this dough.  The only change I made was to use olive oil.  I made our pizza in a deep dish pan and it rose up nicely.  Will definitely use this dough recipe again and again.

Quick and easy dough. I divided it in half and made a thin crust. Sometimes I made 1 1/2 recipes and had plenty of pizza (thin crust) for 4-6 people.

We like thin crust pizza so I split the dough into two balls. Very easy to whip up.

I love this recipe... so fast! To stay away from wheat, I substitute it with light spelt flour and it works perfectly.

Although it was easy, it is a little too tough for us.  We prefer Quick and Easy Pizza Crust from this site.

This was really yummy and very quick! I used it to make pizza twists with pepperoni and cheese in the middle.  I opted to substitute 1 cup of wheat flour for 1 of the cups of all purpose flour and it still tasted great.  We will use this recipe from now on instead of buying refridgerated crust!

For the simplicity of it, I give it 5 stars.  You can't expect a quick crust to be "out of this world", but for the time factor, it's very good.

This is a wonderful quick and easy pizza crust.  I always have these ingredients on hand and made it last min, yet it didn't taste like 'one of those meals mom just makes up'. Pizza is always a hit at my house, and this was right up there with the best, but none of the hard work.  Thank you!

This was very easy and I loved the way it went into the pan.  I baked the crust alone for a few minutes before adding topping.  BUT the crust ended up very flat and gummy.  What did I do wrong?

Quick & easy!  Followed as written and tasted good.  Next time will try adding some seasonings.  This was my first time making any kind of dough from scratch and it's a good recipe to start with.

Very quick.  Very easy.  Very tasty.  I stuck to the recipe by the letter.  The dough DID sit for a few moments while I prepared all the other stuff (grated cheese, etc.) so it cooked fluffy and crispy all at the same time.

The dough was quick and easy as the recipe states and looked great when it came out of the oven.  My 5 year old son took his first bite asked if we were eating "Play Dough" pizza and I had to chuckle because that is how it tasted to me as well.  Maybe I did something wrong, however, I will spend the extra time in the future on a quality dough.

Good, easy recipe.  I dissolve the yeast in the warm water before adding the rest of the ingredients.  I also prefer whole-wheat flour and I cook the rolled out dough for 10 mins. before adding the toppings and cooking an additional 10 or so minutes.

Exactly what it claims to be.  I literally realized last minute that the pizza dough I had was bad.  The hubby really wanted pizza, so I looked this up and made it.  It  wasn't the best pizza dough ever, but it was extremely good considering the thyme (ha...pun...although I really did but some thyme in it) and effort involved.  It was very simple and functional.

I have tried several pizza doughs recently, and this was by far the easiest and the best.  I did leave the crust out for about an hour before constructing pizza and had tucked it away in an off oven, which my boyfriend had started to preheat the oven with the pizza inside for about 7 minutes without thinking.  The crust was a little prebaked, but turned out excellent still.

We have been making this dough for over a year and love how easy it is.  The dough is VERY thick though, so in order for it to not turn into a loaf of bread with some toppings, you have to roll it really really thin.  We have started cutting the yeast in half though which seems to make it into regular pizza dough that isn't quite as thick.

Substitute oil for olive oil. Add basil, tsp. of garlic. Maybe herbs. Bake it for 5 minutes before you put the toppings on. Used other half for bread sticks topped with garlic butter and parm.

This is our newest favorite.  We don't even bother with the cheap package mixes from the store anymore.  We make this dough and then use a can of jazzed up tomato sauce, plus our favorite toppings of course.  This recipe is a good base to try different seasonings with too.  We like garlic powder or italian seasoning.  Just through in the bread machine with the other ingredients.  I also dissolve my yeast in the water before adding the other ingredients (don't know if that makes a difference or not.)

I've tried a lot of pizza dough recipes and  this one is very good--best of all, the dough is easy to work with.  The only change I made was substituting olive oil for vegetable oil.  It isn't like the pizza dough at my favorite pizzeria but it is the best homemade pizza dough recipe I've come across.  I love how easy it is to make and use.  No need to let it rise.  It is a keeper!

This crust was a lifesaver! My kids were clamoring for pizza and I didn't have time to let my dough rise so ! tried this. I thought it was awesome for being so easy and it tasted good. Definitely not parlor crust but it passed here! 

Thanks!

This did not turn out for me at all. I followed the recipe but my dough was soggy and the top of my pizza was way over done. The cheese was all brown. I don't know why it turned out so bad but I'm not making this one again.

It wasn't the best crust, but passable. My dad said it was close to store-bought, but not yet there. If I had more time to take care to use a pizza stone or pan of water, the crust probably would have been of higher quality. At least this recipe was easy to follow.

Sure it is fast and easy but to me the dough tasted bland and boring. Although it does give you a good idea of how pizza dough is made. Will definately not be making this dough again! You're better off with pre-made Boboli dough unfortunately. Not sure what the rave is all about on this dough..

Very easy recipe--I use it to make calzones.  I just add a little garlic powder and some dry basil for flavor.  It's fast, easy and you can make it to taste.  Thanks!

Excellent crust, a snap to make. Had the pizza in the oven in 10 minutes...and that included sauteeing the veggies first. My family really enjoyed it -- thank you!

Very easy to make! Use olive oil. i added some italian seasonings to the dough also. This is a great recipe b/c if you have the time to wait for the dough to rise, that is great! But if not just press it into the pan and it works like a charm. I've done it both ways. Brush crust with milk if you like it a little more crispy.

The pizza dough is AMAZING! It's so simple and tastes wonderful!  I was surprised/worried of how quick it claimed to be but followed the directions word for word and it was so great I couldn't believe it!  My friends and I are all in love with this recipe and I recommend it it to anyone looking for a quick/easy/good pizza dough :)

So easy and delicious!  I would recommend rolling it pretty thin though.  As a thick crust it doesn't quite do it for me.

Making this dough for the second time tonight.  Last time the whole pizza disappeared!  Crust is not too thin and not too thick.  I followed others' advice and added a tsp of garlic powder and 1/2 tsp italian seasoning before letting the dough rise in a warmed oven.  I also waited to add the salt until the dough had risen for 30 min.  Great recipe!

This recipe made me enjoy making my own pizza! Even my husband enjoys making this. I have shared this recipe with friends and family and they all rave over the simplicity and ease of this dough. I do let the dough rise for at least half an hour or so, but no need.

I use this at least 2 times a week.  Sometimes I just roll out and use as flat bread for sandwiches. Adding sweet basil and powdered garlic makes for an excellent bread.
Easiest and fastest to bake on a Pizzaz.It's a cheap pizza baking machine that doesn't get the kitchen hot.  It comes out perfect in about 12 minutes.

This recipe is fantastic if followed as is.  However, I did make some changes I feel improved the overall taste of the dish.  

Firstly, I proofed the active dry yeast in 110 degree water for ten minutes with the sugar.  Then added the flour (2 1/2 cup), two basil leaves from the garden, 1 clove minced garlic, and 2T olive oil and mixed for 5 minutes on speed 2 (KitchenAid) with the dough hook.  Then I added the salt and mixed for 1 more minute.  Let the dough rise in a warm place for 30 minutes.  Roll thin and bake for 5-7 minutes then topped with sauce leftover from The World's Greatest Lasagna (also from this site), cheese, and fresh basil from my garden.  

It was amazing!

Very easy, and easy to work with, but was chewier than I'd hoped. I prefer a crispier pizza crust, and I even rolled this pretty thin. Husband really loved it, though, so will make it again.

I've been so unsuccessful at making pizza that I finally found an easy recipe.  This was AWESOME!!!!  I think I might take another reviewer's suggestion and use less flour.  It all stuck together with the exception of about a 1/4 cup of flour.  I ended up adding more warm water and a tiny bit of olive oil to make it stick.  I made the Exquisite Pizza Sauce from this site to go with it.

This is a pretty good recipe. I made it because I didn't have time to let the dough rise. I used garlic salt instead of salt and olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I also kneaded the dough rather than mixing it with a spoon, because the spoon didn't work very well. I made one large pizza with it, and the crust turned out really thick and overpowered the toppings (cheese and pepperoni). I think it would be better to split the dough and make two medium pizzas instead of one large pizza. But it served its purpose and didn't take extra time to rise, so I'm happy.

This was very good.  I didn't use all the flour, and I think next time I would let it rise for a while, I also used olive oil.  I will make it again for sure!!  No complaints in my house.

Very good!  Any loss of texture (which I did not notice) is well made up for by not having to spend three hours making dough.
Baked it on a sheet pan, and it made a very good thin crust pizza.  Next time I will add herbs to the dough, and bake it for 5-10 minutes before I add the toppings.

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but this didn't quite turn out like I expected. I did follow other's suggestions and let it rise for about an hour, and even pre-baked it for 8-10 minutes beforehand. The result is something like a foccacia bread instead of pizza dough - good, but not what I envisioned based on the pictures. I will keep searching for a good pizza dough recipe.

This was pretty good. My first batch came out too dry so I added water, which made it too wet,so I added some flour. In the end, it was really chewy and good. My kids, who normally don't eat the pizza dough end ate it up. My second batch came out perfect. I made sure to scoop the flour into the measuring cup and then leveled it off. I will use this recipe every time I want to make home made pizza crusts.

This pizza dough is the bomb-diggity! It is so easy to make. I have an industrial Kenmore stand mixer and it kneaded this dough perfectly. I added some Italian seasonings, used olive oil instead of vegie oil and also added a bit of garlic powder. I was able to roll it out with no stickiness! Great recipe!

This is just a basic recipe, there is nothing special about it.  I added seasonings to make it my own.

Good flavor.  I did have to add extra flour b/c it was too moist. I also baked it for 5 minutes before putting toppings on b/c I like crisper crust. Next time I will either bake longer or use it for 2 sheets worth of pizza.

Good recipe, but I found it hard to get into a big enough circle to make a good sized pizza out of it. It took a little work, but in time I am sure that part will get easier.

This came out as a really heavy, not quite cooked in the middle crust.  Maybe it's because I tried it for a deep dish pizza, but I thought it was way too heavy, even after following yeast-rising tips and recommendations from other reviews.

This is a wonderful, quick and easy recipe for pizza dough. I made a few alterations... I substituted olive for vegetable oil, added some herbs and fresh garlic to the mix and also let it rise for about 45 mins (lightly oiled dough and placed in bowl covered with a dish cloth). Also, before baking I brushed the crust with roasted garlic olive oil. Delicious! I'll definitely be making this recipe again.

This recipe was awesome. I used the measurements listed in the recipe, and I did let it rise for about 30 minutes, and it was VERY GOOD. Will continue to use this recipe.

I added 1 tsp of garlic and oregano as suggested.  Turned out great.  I may bake at a higher temp next time so it's a bit crispier.

Fabulous, thick crust with a nice chewy texture. I did precook the crust for about 15 minutes. Then I layered my toppings and spread a little softened butter around the exposed crust. This adds some flavor and makes it look pretty.

Very good pizza crust!  I did add 1 tsp italian seasoning and 1 tsp garlic powder after reading some other reviews - but would probably be just fine without it.  I let the dough rise 30 minutes before rolling out.  Brushing edge of crust with olive oil after baking helps with the presentation of the pizza - and also adds a little more flavor!

We used the exact same ingredients and let the dough rise 1 hour.  It made 2 large crusts.  We also pre-baked the crust 5 minutes then added the toppings. We will prebake it a little longer next time.  The crusts were really good and we will make this recipe again.

It makes a difference what you cook the pizza on, I cooked mine on an oiled oven tray and one on baking paper and the baking paper pizza was a bit soggy and needed to cook for longer. I topped with boiled and sliced potatoes, garlic, rosemary, and marscarpone cheese! yum!

I had to make 2 batches of this and they were COMPLETELY different. One was thick & too chewy, with lots of large air pockets, the other turned out thinner, hard & chewy & I followed the directions. I always try a recipe as is at first before tweaking it. This one need to be tweaked as we won't be doing it again.

This recipe makes a delicious pizza dough. I followed the recipe except when the dough later required more olive oil and flour during the kneeding process. Also, the dough was even more delicious when giving it two 30 min. opportunities to rise. Very good!

Super recipe! I followed tips from other reviewers and let my dough rise 30 min.,puched down, kneaded, and let rise about 10 more minutes. It was so easy to roll the dough.I like a thin crust so I cut the recipe to 5 serving plus a little added flour and I easily rolled out a 16 inch thin crust pizza dough. Other than some added spices for taste the proportions are perfect!

Just made this tonight. I used 2 cups of white flour and 1/2 cup wheat flour. I added a little Italian seasoning (but of course!) and a bit of garlic salt. (I'll probably use garlic powder the next time. It already had enough salt in it.) I also followed what others said about allowing the yeast, salt, and sugar dissolve in the warm water for 10 minutes. I then allowed the dough to rise for 50 minutes. It was very tasty and my husband said it was a winner! (He's pretty picky, too.) Thanks for the recipe!

I know the crust is only part of the pizza equation, but this was so blah it actually detracted from the toppings. I wasn't looking for foccacia so I didn't add all the seasonings as other reviewers suggested, but I'm sure they would have helped.

This recipe makes a delicious pizza or stromboli crust.  I adjusted the recipe slightly by flavoring it with 1 tsp. garlic powder and 1 tsp. basil.  I only rated as four stars, simply because it wasn't quite as simple as "mixing" and "pressing".  I followed the wet and dry measurments exactly and wound up with a very lumpy dough - which I then added some extra flour to, kneeded for a few minutes, and let rise for half an hour bofore rolling and baking.

I don't use the word perfect very often but I've always wanted to make a great pizza and today I finally achieved that with this recipe.  I did let it rise, then spread it out onto a deep cookie sheet.  this made a large pizza with a nice thin but not dry crust.  
I was inspired to make pizza after visiting a highly rated pizza restaurant in Hollywood.  I'm happy to say I was not at all disappointed by this recipe!  I think our home made pizza was even better.

This pizza dough is so easy to make.  I made it once following the recipe exactly and then a couple more times adding different spices to the dough everytime.  Turned out perfectly each time.  I even froze some and it still turned out perfectly.  Definately a keeper!

It is ok.  I will keep the recipe but just to save for emergencies.  For example, expecting guest and my other dough doesn't rise as expected.  A great dough is recipezaar #1005.  I used that one for a party and then had two batches not rise so I used this recipe to replace those batches.  I got a lot of request for the other recipe, not this one.

I tried this pizza dough recipe the other night. I thought it was pretty tasty, but still on the heavy side(like bisquick). I did not follow other viewers directions to dissolve the yeast in the water. That may have been where I screwed up.  I have tried a recipe from my BHG cookbook several times, but it never comes out like store-bought pizza dough. So, I'll keep trying your recipes untill it comes out satisfactory. Maybe bread flour would make a difference. Thanks for the recipe.

I also followed LADYMHARRIS's recipe and made two pizzas out of the dough. The second one tasted much better because it sat for closer to an hour per her recommendation. The first batch of dough only sat for about 30 mins but we were too hungry to wait! It really made a difference so hold out if you can. Makes for a great home pizza and I definitely recommend.

I thought this was ok, but heavy and dry for a pizza crust. I even added extra oil when I was spreading it out, and I brushed the crust with oil before baking. But, it ended up dry and cracked.

This was allright, not chewy enough for me.  Very easy to make though.  TIP: Add herbs to the dough.

I made this pizza dough for a get together with some friends, and they loved the crust! everyone was saying that they just wanted to eat the pizza crust! One of my friends said that it was the best pizza crust she had ever had! I Loved how easy it was to make. The only things I did different than the recipe is I let the dough rise for about 30 min. and I cooked the dough for 7 min. before adding the toppings.

A very good pizza crust. I let the dough rise for an hour before patting it into the pan. I used a deep dish pan greased with garlic butter for extra flavor. Will make again.

This is a great quick crust recipe.  I did dissolve the sugar and yeast in the water and after mixing ingredients I did kneed the dough a few times and let rise for 30 min.  I divided the dough into two round pizza crusts and it was kinda thin, but very good.  I will use this again when I want a homemade crust really fast.

Hubby made this tonight and it turned out great. Reason for 4 stars and not 5 was that it wasn't the "perfect" dough but great. Followed the recipe rated by LADYMHARRIS.

We added crushed garlic, basil, italian seasonings and basil, only 2 1/2 cups flour, and olive oil. I placed this in my bread machine and let it rise an additional 30 minutes. I will definitely make this as my main pizza dough again. 
We doubled the recipe and made pizza dough sticks. They came out great, served with spicy pizza sauce

Fantastic pizza dough!  I highly recommend following the instructions left by another reviewer (LadyMHarris) though - letting the dough rise really made a difference.

Actually, used this for Zeppolas "Fry Bread" take your pick of the name.  I let the yeast rise like the other reviews and then I let the dough sit for about an hour more after that.  It made for a rather simple way of making something I really love.  After deep frying the triangles, we dusted them with sugar. So good they didn't last through the night.

Very easy to make.  You can't really mess this recipe up.  I let it rise for about 15-30 min after the dough is mixed.  I also use this same recipe for bread sticks as well.

This was my first from-scratch crust...it was AWESOME!  I did follow the direction given by LADYMHARRIS though.  My dough only raised for about 30 min, but it came out soft center, crisp outside.  I only altered the recipie by adding Italian seasoning and replacing 1c. of flour with white whole wheat. I also baked the crust alone for 10 min at 375 before I put on the toppings.  Then baked for 15 more min.  The crust was golden and perfect and the cheese was melted and starting to crisp on the edge.  Will definatly make again!

Excellent! I now use this dough recipe every time when I make pizza (almost every Friday). I haven't ordered take-away pizza since I found this recipe, it's THAT good!
If you're not in hurry let it stand for an hour.
My advice - bake the dough 10 mins before you put anything on it otherwise it won't cook completely under the filling.

Two thumbs up! I have only made pizza dough using the bag mixes but this is SO easy I will always use this recipe going forward. I made it exactly as written. I have one slice left after serving my family of 5. They all loved it and the crust was perfect!! I didn't even allow rise time. I did dissolve yeast in warm water with the sugar before adding to flour. Thank you for this keeper!!

I tried a couple of suggestions my first time making this dough.  I disolved the yeast and sugar in the warm water, and I baked our "pie" deepdish style.  It was perfect for such an easy recipe!  Not quite what we are used to here in New Jersey, but the family gobbled it up and I'll use this recipe again and again!

This dough is flat and flavorless.  It is very thin and tastes like cardboard after it is cooked.  I don't think the yeast does anything. I won't be making this again.  Sorry.

Great dough recipe, but I definitely have to add seasonings to the dough when making pizza, otherwise it's too bland.

We enjoy this recipe and use it but we don't *love* it.  It is a very easy recipe.  I can make it right before dinner or make it in the morning and leave it until dinner (if I'll be out all day).  We usually make it as a deep-dish style pizza (as another reviewer suggested), so I pre-bake the crust for about 5 minutes before adding toppings.  I find the crust gets done better that way.

First time to make pizza dough; Easy recipe , However I'm not sure if it's just me, but I taste an excess amount of oil. I'm not positive if that's what it is that I'm tasting. Something just seems a bit off here. Next time, I might try using olive oil in place of the vegetable oil. Even though vegetable oil is usually intended to bake with, I feel olive oil would be healthier, as well as a little less overpowering. After baking the dough, I was weary at first due to the texture being kind of uncooked/soggy. After waiting a few minutes, it hardened a bit. Also, I may add my own choice of seasoning because the dough seemed a bit bland. Overall, I gave this a 3 for being so quick and easy to make.  Looks like a beautiful dough, the taste in the end isn't as good as it looks on the outside.

It works, but not the greatest. I added garlic powder to the mix and allowed the yeast to set for ten minutes in the warm water and sugar. Then left the dought sit for 20 min. However, it didn't rise. Made stromboli with it. If you are looking for a thin crust this works, but not for a deep dish!

wonderful, quick, simple and tasteful. I made oval shaped pizzas out of the dough, that looked like little gondolas. I topped them with ham, pineapple, mozzarella and tomatoe sauce.

This was my first time making pizza dough and now I will NEVER go back to the store-bought kind!  This dough was delicious and incredibly easy to make.  The only changes to the recipe I made were to let the dough rise for about 30 minutes after making it, and I also added some dried basil.  I can't imagine a better recipe!

Awesome...I've never made my own dough before and I'm so happy I finally did.  Now I wanna make pizza all the time.  I did let it rise for a while because I had time to waste, and I made a deep dish pizza in a pie pan.  It was delicious.  The only thing I will do differently next time is cook the dough by itself longer before adding the toppings and maybe try my baking stone.

This wasn't too great. i had too much flour, so I hadded 1/4 cup extra water and and extra spoon of oil, like somebody else mentionned, and it was still way too dry. 
The dough did not rise as much as shown in the picture. Maybe I had to let it rise before adding the toppings and putting it in the oven.

Of course there are better pizza dough recipes out there, but who really has 2 hours to let pizza dough rise? Not me. This recipe is really fast and easy, and it tastes good. I even used this recipe for a cooking class with junior high girls, and it was a hit. I add rosemary to the dough to perk it up a little, and cut back a little on the flour so it rolls really thin.

Quick and easy. If I have time I let it rise a little. Sometimes I add some herbs or crushed red peppers, but it is good on its own as well.

Very good and super easy recipe. I will never use store bought pizza dough again. I did add a few cloves of chopped garlic and some italian seasoning to flavor the dough because I made a white pizza with fresh tomatoes and garlic. I have two little boys and dough was easy for them to eat than the crispier kind. Thanks for the recipe.

I thought the flavor of the dough was good, but the crust didn't crisp at all on the bottom. In my opinion it was way too soft.

We love this recipe, we used Olive oil and 2 1/2c of flour, basil and black pepper.  Let dough rise for 30 mins, Cooked for 20 mins but next time we'll leave it in longer.  Otherwise AWESOME dough.  No more ordering in. Thanks.

An excellent, fluffy crust. If you are looking for crunchy or chewy, this may not be the one for you, but it made a wonderful deep dish.

Everyone I have made this for loves the pizza, even those who are not big fans of pizza. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and upped the salt to 1-1/2 tsp. I also baked the dough for a few minutes before I put the sauce and toppings on.

I also made bread sticks with the dough. I did not have time to let them rise but they STILL came out nice and fluffy! I just rolled out the dough, transferred it to a cookie sheet, cut it with a pizza cuter in to strips, and threw it in the oven. Yumm!

Thanks for a great recipe!

My kids loved this recipe...I took some of the suggestions from others and let the yeast bloom in the water before adding to the flour mixture.  I also found that I needed a tad more than one cup.  Definitely something great for the kids to help with - they loved eating the pizza they made!

Wonderful basic pizza dough recipe. I like to add my own seasonings to the dough (garlic, oregeno, whatever I might be in the mood for). Makes a very light, and tasty dough.

Great simple recipe!  I added some oregano, bout a teaspoon and a teaspoon of garliv powder before letting my dough rise.  I also let my yeast double while I fried up my sausage topping for my pizza.  Thanks!  This one's a keeper!

This was just ok...not the worst, but not the best. The first pizza I followed directions exactly, and I could not get it onto my stone without completely warping the pizza. The taste was ok, and my littlest ones liked it...I think because it was kind of "bready." The second one I doubled the yeast and it came out much fluffier, however, still kind of like a bread. But taste wasn't too bad still. But I couldn't get the bottom of the crust the way I like it, and usually cooking on a stone ensures it, but it didn't work. I would only use again if I didn't have time to let it rise. Thanks :)

Very very quick and easy. Tastes great, I buttered a round cake pan for half of the recipe so it took a few minutes longer, well worth it.Thanks for this recipe.

This was good enough for me, however, my husband said it needed more flavor.  I didn't have any Italian seasoning to spice it up with, as others have suggested.  I cooked it for 10 mins, took it out, basted the dough with melted butter and onion powder, topped it and stuck it back in.  That did a little bit, but it was still too tasteless for him (although I should have used onion salt). Side note, I used Hunt's Garlic and Onion sauce, as I didn't have any pizza sauce. It was disgusting! Too sour. I'll stick with this recipe though, with lots of seasoning.

I found the dough was a little tough and tore easy althought the flavor was good in the end.  I will follow advise of LADYMHARRIS next time.

Very easy & quick to make, however very basic as well.  Next time I will add some spices to the crust to liven it up.  This was by far the easiest and quickest pizza dough I've ever made & I will definetly use this recipe again with a few additions of my own!  Thank you!

This is a very quick and easy dough recipe that tastes good.  My husband and daughter really like the pizza when I make it using this recipe.  However, for me, it is a little bland and more like bread and so I only gave it 4 stars because of that.  But, I have made it twice and I'm sure I will continue to use this recipe in the future while I search for another one.

This recipe wasn't all that good. I ended up having to add a couple tblsp of milk when I was making it because the dough didn't want to cling.
Once cooked, it was a little soggy, and over all we really wern't impressed. Sorry
