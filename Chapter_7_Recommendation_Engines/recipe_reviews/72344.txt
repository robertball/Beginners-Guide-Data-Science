Flavor was o'k but I don't think these should be called Cocoa Muffins; you really can't see or taste the cocoa. One reviewer mentioned putting in chocolate chips and I will probably do that next time to up the chocolate flavor. UPDATE: Added 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips this time and they turned out extremely yummy. Definitely give these a try!

This was not worth the ingredients or effort put into it.

MMMM!! We loved 'em! The cocoa needs to be doubled or tripled. I doubled the cocoa and it was definitely not chocolate flavored but it WAS delicious(whatever the flavor was!) I didn't have an egg and I wanted to use up my starter so I used 1 cup of starter instead of 1/2 cup my mom couldn't believe there was no egg because it was moist and had a wonderful texture. Will make it again but maybe I'll triple the cocoa this time.

I made mini-muffins and sprinkled a little of the cocoa and sugar on top of the batter before placing them in the oven. Delicious!
