This was absolutely fabulous. I didn't quite have enough of the rice vinegar so for the rest of it I used apple cider vinegar.  I didn't have any precooked shrimp so I cooked some with Old Bay Seasoning on them and chilled them before marinating.

I recently had jicama in Mexico and wanted to try to experiment more with it.  I made this but only had plain rice vinegar.  Next time I will try it with the seasoned to see if it spices it up some more.  I served it to some guys that were working at our business and it was very well received and the 4 guys eating it all went for seconds. Two asked for the recipe to take home to their wives.  Nice refreshing salad.

Really good. I didn't change anything except to eyeball measure the veges. I used jumbo shrimp and that made it  even more pleasing. Makes a great side dish to substitute in the summer as opposed to rstandard rice and beans. Keto friendly.
