it's a interesting twist on the standard cucumber salad. i like the addition of radishes. however there is way too much dressing. i'd start off with 1/4 cup of the mayo & ranch, for me that was fine but i know other people might prefer more dressing. so i'd keep adding 1/8 cup of each until it suits your tastes.

It was ok, I liked the concept of adding the radishes, but its not something I'd make again.  Way too much dressing and its an "eat it that day" recipe.  The next day it was limp & soupy and on Day 2 (after making the recipe for dinner one evening) it was so unappealling looking I just tossed it.

My husband is allergic to onions, so I added carrots instead. This mix is a great side for pasta dishes.

We liked the recipe, but we also like cucumbers and radishes. I made it for the two of us and nothing was left. I will make it again.

We enjoyed this salad.  Had cucumbers & radishes, didn't know what to do with them.  This was a nice change. :)

Needed to use up a bunch of radish; this simple and delicious recipe saved the day. Thanks!
