THIS WAS SPECTACULAR! I needed to make something festive for a Christmas potluck at work, and a cake seemed pretty easy to transport. I chose eggnog because that flavor isn't my favorite and I didn't want to be tempted to eat a TON of it. I cut a piece to bring a coworker and noticed how moist it looked, and had to try some myself. PEOPLE, this has got to be one of the most delicious and professional tasting cakes ever. It has a strong but delicious and rich eggnog flavor. It was very easy too aside from the weird geletin in water thing which I found to be clumpy but mixed into the whipped cream anyway. I sprinkled mine with some color since it was white white white. If you are a fan of eggnog, do NOT pass this one up! My house still smells delicious days later too!

This recipe was really great!  I did make some alterations - I used a white cake mix instead of yellow, I didn't have rum extract, I used vanilla instead, I also used oil instead of butter.  I baked in a 10x13 pan and didn't use the filling.    For the icing, I used 500ml of whipping cream, 1cup of icing sugar, 1/2cup of eggnog & 1 pkg instant vanilla pudding.  This cake was super moist & even my husband who doesn't like eggnog loved this cake.  I will definitely make this again!

I submitted this recipe, but forgot to tell you that you can put it in a 9 by 13 inch pan, also.   Make sure that you use a deep 9 by 13 because there is a lot of filling and toppings.     Enjoy!

For an easy icing just mix eggnog and powdered sugar...sprinkle nutmeg over and voila!

I went looking for a recipe to use up my Christmas eggnog, and was very happy I found this one.  This recipe is very easy to make, since it starts with a cake mix.  In no time at all it's in the oven.  Filling and frosting are also easy.  The only thing I would recommend is that there is too much batter for 8-inch pans.  Next time I will use 9-inch.
I highly recommend this cake.

I was so disappointed with this recipe.  Followed the recipe to a T. The cake was just ok.  Tasted like regular boxed mix to me.  The filling was not spreadable at all and the icing was beyond sweet.    Add super sweet icing  on top of a bland cake with thick looking filling and you get something that just isn't eatable.  Maybe a kid with a sweet tooth will like this, but it won't be on my table again.   Sorry.

Wow o wow o wow..... First let me start off if you are an eggnog lover then this is the cake for you! I followed the recipe to the T except I changed the rum extract to 1 teaspoon instead of a half a teaspoon. This cake is extremely rich in flavor and oh so decadent.  

I made this for my great uncles birthday and everyone raved about it! I was told I must make it again. I am going to be making this for our church Christmas party this weekend. 

Thanks for an awesome recipe!

This was okay. The gelatin in the frosting was unneccesary and created little gelatin chucks in the frosting. The rum flavor was a little too much.

The recipe is way off and ruined the dessert. I made the filling as the recipe stated, and it remained pure liquid, even after following the instructions to a tee and letting it stay in the fridge for 2 hours, not just 30 minutes. It did not solidify at all. At that point I did not even attempt the topping, fearing it would further ruin the cake. I just put on a vanilla frosting. Pretty disappointing after reading all of the glowing reviews.

Wow! This cake was amazing! My MIL made it for New Years and boy was it a treat! The only thing she did different was she used rum instead of rum extract because that's all she had. It still turned out great! Very moist and rich. A real show stopper!

This cake is moist, but way too sweet! It didn't even need the filling and frosting. There is quite a bit of eggnog flavor. I only ate it to taste the cake, and that was it. I would recommend this to those who enjoy very, very sweet cakes.

I made this into cupcakes and didn't use the filling because I couldn't figure out how to get the filling into the cupcakes easily.  I also used pre-made buttercream frosting and added the 1/2 tsp rum flavored extract.  The doctored cake mix is pretty good...the only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because my version didn't taste all that eggnog-like...but prolly because I didn't use the filling.

I make this every year for the holidays. This is the first year that I have been married and made it for my husband and he practically licked his plate clean. The only change I make is to use cool whip with the rum extract and nutmeg. Thanks for this heavenly recipe!

I would make this cake again with some alterations. It was way too sweet. I don't believe 2 cups of eggnog are necessary for the filling.  I will use 1/2 cup of milk and 1 1/2 cups of eggnog for the filling the next time. I will also use 3/4 cup of sugar for the frosting rather than 1 1/4 cups of sugar. You can always add more sugar to taste to the frosting.

I've made this cake three times now! It is so good! I follow the directions exactly as stated. For the eggnog, I use Southern Comfort Vanilla Spice. Yum!!!! I haven't made the frosting. I just use the pudding in between the cake layers ( I make two rounds) and then also put the pudding on top. The pudding recipe is plenty and you will even have a little left over. Love love love this recipe!!! Thanks!! *I will also post my pic. :)
