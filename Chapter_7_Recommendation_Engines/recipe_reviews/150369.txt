Rasam was one of my first introductions to South Indian cooking. Now I've used it to introduce my mother to the cuisine.  The only drawbacks to this recipe derive from personal tastes.  I don't like oil or ghee in the poppu/tadka for rasam.   Let's hope more people try this.  It's the best cold remedy and light meal I can imagine.

I'm not sure if this is an authentic recipe, but I have made this many times when getting over a cold because it uses ingredients that I nearly always have around. I've even subbed tomato sauce for the fresh tomato and it still hits the spot. I just use less tamarind because my paste is very concentrated, and sometimes I add dried red chili to the tempering.
