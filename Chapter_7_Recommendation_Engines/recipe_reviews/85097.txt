Used instant potatoes, heavy cream instead of half and half, more butter, seasoning salt, minced garlic and wasabi paste. Keep tasting to get the flavor that you want and adjust accordingly. Great with beef tenderloin.

We love Wasabi so I thought this would be a hit. It wasn't. Maybe if you add wasabi paste instead of powder it might work.  Not worth the effort to even give that a try.  Did not eat all of the portion on my plate and threw out the leftovers.
