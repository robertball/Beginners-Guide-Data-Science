I also added one turnip pealed and cubed and two potatoes pealed and cubed. (My husband has to have a potato in all his veggie things LOL) and one stalk celery chopped.

I was a little skeptical because parsnips and rutabagas both have such distinctive tastes, but this soup was delicious. It was a complete winner!

I'm neither a soup lover nor frequent soup maker but this record breaking winter has me branching out. I took many liberties as I'm not a fan of celantro. Just for personal preference I added summer savory, marjoram and tarragon. To make it a meal I added about a cup of dried navy beans that had soaked overnight. When everything was cooked I removed roughly a litre of soup, blended it with an immersion blended then added it back to thicken the broth up. Yummy!  Thanks for the inspiration

Have never cared for parsnips so I didnâ€™t add them, but the soup was very good.

Nobody in my family would like this again. It lacked a fulfilling richness and taste.

This was OK, but I would not make it again. Not what I expected. The broth was too sweet, I did not realize the parsnips would flavor it so strongly over the other roots. I would definitely not make it for Christmas!

Added leftover  pork roast just because it needed to be used. It was okay but just as good without it.

This would be better without the chicken broth and more veggies added.
