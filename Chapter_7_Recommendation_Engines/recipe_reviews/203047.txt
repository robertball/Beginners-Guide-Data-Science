Great recipe.  Good old comfort food. Smells wonderful! Very easy to make and love how the coating stays on chicken so nicely.  I used 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts with total weight of 1.7 pounds.  Needed about double the corn flakes called for.  One other hint...be sure to really mix corn flake, onion soup combo...the onion soup wants to go to bottom of bowl and you end up having much more of it on the last pieces of chicken dipped than the first.

This was delicious!! I made it once by the recipe word for word, another time I didn't have enough sour cream so I added some ranch dressing to the mix and it was AMAZING!!!

This was so good! I left out the onion soup mix because my husband's not a big onion fan, but I bet it is good that way too.

This recipe was good.  I substituted greek yogurt instead of sour cream and panko crumbs instead of corn flakes.  I will make it again but probably only use 1/2 the onion soup mix.  The whole packet made it a bit too salty.

Very nice flavor with the sour cream/dijon combination. Chicken was moist and delicious. I omitted the dry onion soup mix because it contained MSG, and instead used some onion powder and sea salt in the cornflakes mixture. At the end of the baking time I put the chicken under the broiler for 3-4 minutes to make the cornflake coating more crispy. Will make again.

WOW!  This is really good.  I've made many receipes from this site some great & some not so great.  Let me tell you this was was wonderful!  I used tenderloins (because my local Kroger didn't have breasts) and it was so good!  I'm a little confused about the time because since I used tenderloins I thought the time would be less but, (I was using a convection oven)  I had to cook them 25 min.  but that said  it was the best receipe I've tried on this site.  Easy & so good!

This was really delicious!  I used more cornflakes like one reviewer recommended and marinated the chicken in the sour cream mixture all day.  It was so flavorful.  I would definitely make it again.  My friend from Fort Bragg loved it!

this was SUCH a big hit in My house! i did make a few changes though...i used rice crispies instead of cornflakes bc im not a fan of the corn flake texture. also instead of onion soup mis i used a rosemary/garlic seasoning blend from the local spice shop! i also added a little more mustard bc i felt it lacked something...but ths was delicious! i served it with some whole grain pasta with roasted red bell peppers, olives, shredded parmesean cheese, and a drizzle of olive oil! definitely putting this in my dinner rotation! this is great for any new cook in the kitchen! :)

My husband enjoyed this more than I did.  I liked the crunch of the cornflakes but I found the onion soup mix overpowered all the other flavors.  If I make it again, I'd leave that out.

Made this tonight for a family dinner and it was a huge hit!  Everyone loved it.  Doubled the recipe to feed 8 and wish I had tripled it to have leftovers for lunch.  Agreed with other reviewers, need a bit more corn flakes and have to mix it well but so delicious!

This was really good and easy to make. My husband would not stop telling me how good it was after I made it lol I sprayed the baking dish with pam instead of coating it with butter, and didn't drizzle any butter on it at all. Other than that, I followed all of the directions. The chicken is so good! It doesn't need anything extra or any dipping sauces. Thanks for the great recipe!

YUMMY!!!  My daughters, 16 months and 3 years LOVED this!  Very easy and so tasty.  I only had a 1/2 envelope of onion soup mix which worked great so it wasn't overpowering.  I added more corn flakes so I didn't run out.  Perfect recipe for kids.

I have made this twice.  Once just for me and yesterday for some of my friends.  Each one wanted the recipe and one of them wanted to fix it for her family last night.  I too, as others, used more cornflakes and I think it is better if marinated in fridge for about an hour.  I am making it again today to take to a couple that both have been in the hospital recently and yes, I am saving a piece for me.  This is so easy.  Anyone can make it and have it turn out good.

Very good. I liked how the sour cream mixture "stuck" to the chicken. Needed more corn flakes.

Loved this recipe! I had to make a few changes but I think the results would be the same. First, since I don't use sour cream, I used 0 fat greek yogurt. It has the same taste and texture. And instead of drizzling butter on top, I drizzled it with lite olive oil. This took out a lot of fat and cholesterol. My husband and I loved this and will definitely make it again soon!

This was delicious! I prepared this tonight for the fiirst time and it was a hit! My husband loved it! I did add a little bit of ranch dressing, and since I didn't have the dijon mustard I added 1 tsp of dry mustard, 1 tbs of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of ketchup. Turned out wonderful. I will definitely be making this again!

Very good and flavorful.  I had 4 very huge breasts, so I cut them in half to make 8 servings.  Doubled everything but the onion soup mix.  I used regular Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream, and powdered garlic  as I was lazy.  Instead of butter, I sprayed the baking dish with Pam and also sprayed the tops of the chicken with Pam ( a secret catering trick)  Overall, very good.  Just be sure not to overcook the chicken.  Pull when it's ALMOST done, as the carry-over temp will finish it off.  I found 18 minutes to be just right.

I was looking for something new to try and this looked good. It turned out way better than I thought. It will definately be added to the menu list at my house. The only thing that I did different was I used Roasted Vegetable Ritz crackers instead of cornflakes.

Liked it but made one change in the process; I put the chicken on a wire rack in a pan to ensure crispness all around.

I have made this recipe many times using a Ranch dressing seasoning packet; tasty & the sour cream keeps it so moist!  Next time I'll try the onion soup mix. 

This is absolutely my husband's fave

Yummy!  I substituted light mayo for sour cream.  I also read it wrong and added the soup mix to the mayo mixture.  I cut the chicken up smaller for Chicken Tenders, too (cooks faster).

Perfect! Although I used 2 large chicken breasts and 1/2'd the recipe except used the full amount of corn flakes and onion soup mix.  Could have used a lot less sour cream even when using 1/2 the recipe. But it was delicious! My 4 year old loved it! Will definitely make again. So moist!

This was excellent! Lots of flavor, the only thing I added was fresh parmesan. It looked just like the picture, nice and crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside. This will become a staple in our home. Thank-you for sharing!

I'm usually not one to hate, and I'm not a picky eater by any means- but I just wasn't diggin this recipe. I'm extremely suprised more people didn't mention how SALTY this ended up being with all that onion soup mix!  (I added about 2 cups more cornflakes like others suggested, too). I had to scrape most of my breading off just to get through my piece of chicken, and to tell you the truth, the smell in the fridge the next morning was pure onion soup mix.  I wouldn't put more then a third of the packet in next time, if any at all!

This is the best breaded chicken recipe I haved made.  So tender and tasty. I have also made it with non-fat yogurt with some extra salt and it was just as good.  I generally add a few extra herbs in the breading - but the basic recipe is still amazing.

Pretty good, but I didn't like how the sour cream mix kind of glopped on and slid around on the chicken. It did help the crumbs to stick well, though. I used half a package of dry ranch dip mix instead of the onion soup, and it was good. Just the texture of the sour cream wasn't awesome. I also wonder if the shortage of crumbs comes from people using whole chicken breasts instead of halves, as in the recipe? The rest of the recipe is plenty for whole chicken breasts, though. That will also increase the baking time considerably too. Mine baked for about 50 minutes (covered for the first 20), then after another 30 minutes and 180 degrees, I turned off the oven and let them sit while I finished the sides.

This was so delicious and even my 7yr old was able to eat this chicken. This was so tender very soft. I only made 3 chicken breast since it was only for my 2kids and myself. I pounded the chicken so it could cook evenly and didn't marinate. It was a last minute meal. I didn't have any onion soup so I used onion powder and a little bit of garlic salt. I think I did over do it on the dijon cause I went a little overboard putting about 3Tbs next time I will use what is recommended or less. Other than that like other reviewers which I had made extra for leftovers but one chicken breast is more than enough. I would like to try to bake this chicken on a wire rack to get the crisp on both sides, next time.

I was a little disappointed! I thought the taste of mustard was overpowering. I will use honey mustard next time and lower it to 1 tablespoon. I thought the chicken was very tender though.

Honestly it was really overpowering with the Lipton Onion Mix and I had to add a lot more corn flakes than what the recipe called for in order to cover the chicken completely.  If I make this again I think I am going to skip on the Lipton Onion.
Thanks for submitting the recipe.

This was absolutely fantastic!  I followed the recipe 100% and wouldn't change a thing.  The DH loved this too and has asked that I make it again!  Now that I have a gallon of Cornflakes, I may just have to repeat very soon!  Thank you Atarah for a superb recipe!

blended into a cordon bleu version... I pounded the chicken flat. Dipped in the sauce as stated. I wrapped the chicken around swiss cheese and ham. Then finished as described (used a little less onion dip). I added all remaining sauce to the baking dish. I added sliced mushrooms...I had to bake it longer...very good

I would give this recipe a strong B+.  It definitely needs more cornflakes than what it calls for.  I think 2 cups is about right.  It had a good flavor and was definitely tasty.  We all enjoyed!

The idea sounds nice, but this didn't come out so well at all. The cornflake breading all ripped off and the chicken ended up tough and tasted quite odd. I really thought it was going to be good, because it sounded great...but I actually had to make something else! I was really disappointed!

I would've given it 5 stars, but the time isn't accurate. You can't refrigerate it for 20 minutes but say the prep time is 10 minutes. So that caused some unnecessary inconvenience because I trusted the time quote as being accurate. Otherwise, the rest of the recipe was probably good enough to do again. This is my first non-5-star feedback, which is disappointing.

This was simply ok.  There seemed to be a conflict of flavors for both my husband and I.  I may try it again but I would probably leave out the dijon mustard.

This was delicious, quick and easy. I didn't have cornflakes so I used panko breadcrumbs.  The chicken comes out moist and delicious. I did pound the chicken breasts to get them thinner with a meat tenderizer. Wll definitely add this to my regular recipe box!!

Delicious, easy recipe!  I made this using Rice Chex instead of corn flakes.  (I knew we wouldn't eat the rest of a box of corn flakes, but we will eat the rest of Rice Chex).  This was very flavorful - thanks for a great recipe.

Very tasty--I used more cornflakes and only half a pkg of onion soup based on former reviews. Could still taste a lot of the onion flavor. The kids even liked it!

This turned out great! Be sure to crush the cornflakes thoroughly. Otherwise it looks pretty funny. Still tastes terrific, though! I doubled the recipe except for the onion soup mix, which I left single. People really enjoyed the sour cream flavor.

This was really, really delicious.  The chicken was so moist and the coating was so yummy.  I didn't have any corn flakes so I substituted regular bread crumbs.  Thanks to the subby for sharing!

I did two things differently - first, I left out the butter because I just didn't want the unnecessary fat. Then, I took a cookie cooling rack and put it inside a regular cookie sheet and baked it that way. It came out perfectly crunchy and not soggy on the bottom as it would have by following the directions. I would probably add a little more spice to the mix like some cayenne pepper, but just a bit. Be sure to use a meat thermometer and take it out at exactly 165F. You don't want to overcook it.

Delicious crust.  I followed the recipe exactly but since I don't buy corn flakes, I used crispy rice cereal.  However, my chicken breasts were too thick.  I should have rolled them flat and I had a time crunch, so I microwaved after about 30 mins of oven time.  3 extra minutes to get to 170.  And I lost the crunch of this recipe.  Sad!  I am definitely going to try again!

I thought this was ok. My man really enjoyed it but I found it soggy on the bottom and a little dry? Maybe I overcooked. We are our own worse critics.

I've made many recipe for baked chicken and I can tell you this one is a keeper.  The coating had a great flavor and didn't pull away from the chicken.  Im sure I will make this one again and again.

Amazing!!! Super easy to make tastes delicious! I didn't have corn flakes so I used panko crumbs and no dijon so I used spicy brown mustard instead. I will definately make this again soon!

I made some changes to throw it together with what I had. I didn't have dijon mustard, so I used a little honey mustard, and I used crushed sailor boy pilot bread. It turned out really crunchy and moist on the inside. Will make again!

This was very moist chicken.  I was tempted to modify the recipe to replace the sour cream with something else.  I decided to follow the recipe and glad I did.  The chicken was moist and crunchy with the corn flakes.  I will make it again.

This was A really good idea.

I first read ALL these great ideas, and then changed some stuff.
(Like I alwys do.)
Instead of Sour Cream, which I am NOT a fan of, I used Low Fat Mayonaise, I skipped on the super salty Onion soup mix entirely, and used Granulated Onion, a jar of Garlic in oil, used half a cup of corn flakes smashed flat with a wooden kitchen hammer, and 1/4 cup spicey bread crumbs, and 1/4 cup Panko bread crumbs...

(I used the wax bag the corn flakes came in to mash them up. I also use the same type bag to freeze up Chicken breasts in my big freezer for a day before I repack them. That bag is GREAT for freezing stuff.)

I also adde some dried Parsley and dried Basil to the mayo mix to add some color and flavor.
Then I cooked it all at 300 degrees for an hour. Using Cast iron pan and skittle.
It being a 7 Degree night here in NY, I also filled my oven with ALL my cast iron stuff, and threw in a big pan filled with sliced onions and some Salt less Butter.
 The Onions can stay inside the oven and cook all night AFTER I turn off the oven.
Oh, I add a Heaping teaspoon of brown sugar to the 4 big onions when I turn off the oven, and mix them all around, and then recover the pan.
They come out like CANDY.
And will keep for a week in the fridge.
I add them to Stuff like Rice.
Ahh, while I am here...I always make half rice / half Spanish rice whenever I am making rice.
(The sodium in Spanish rice is CRAZY high.)
And regular rice is, as Homer Simpson might say: BORING!

Very good.  I used mayo instead of sour creme and I left out the soup mix. I also added thyme, rosemary and a little sage as well.

Loved everything about this recipe! Chicken was SO juicy and tender. I doubled the cornflakes as suggested by other reviewers. Cooking time was spot on for me. I had three breasts and a package of tenders, cooked them all in the same dish, same amount of time, and they came out perfectly! All plates were cleaned! Definitely making this again.

I thought this recipe was great!  I didn't have corn flakes, so I used Panko breadcrumbs instead as a reviewer suggested, and I used the zesty honey mustard I had on hand rather than dijon mustard.  The flavors were still delicious!  I also only had bone-in chicken, so I followed the recipe, but cooked the chicken for 30 minutes at 400 degrees, then lowered the oven temp to 350 degrees and continued cooking for another 20 minutes.  The chicken was EXTREMELY juicy and delicious, and even my picky young eaters devoured it!

I used honey mustard (instead of dijon), garlic powder, onion powder, and salt (instead of garlic cloves and onion soup mix), and wheat chex (instead of corn flakes) and it turned out fantastic.

This is great!!  I used one of the other comments because I did not have enough sour cream and added ranch dressing.  I also found a recipe on this website for homemade onion soup mix and made my own.  Left the chicken (thighs, that's what I had) in the refrigerator all day and then breaded with the flakes and onion mix....Baked and wow!!!  What a success

This is delicious! The favors are well-balanced and come together very well. I only had chicken thighs, so skinned those and followed the recipe accordingly. The only other change was that I had to use Special K instead of corn flakes, and this worked out very well. This recipe will be a regular favorite for sure!

This was delicious! I modified the recipe to what I had on hand;1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup Bison French onion dip, yellow mustard, Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb Seasoning; plain bread crumbs.  My son and I enjoyed it with fresh green beans, mashed potatoes, dinner rolls and chicken gravy.  We will be having leftovers for dinner tomorrow!

Main part of nephew's birthday dinner...rather than using cornflakes, I followed someone else's recommendation to coat with panko and flour; I also used sour cream and egg whisked together for flavoring & moistness...dredged breast halves in flour, then sour cream/egg mixture & let excess drip away, then coated in panko w/flour & seasoning of Mrs. Dash, Garlic Powder and black pepper...baked in oil-glazed pan and everyone loved it...had ten people, of which 4 were children...needless to say, there were leftovers as I cooked 14 breast halves...what WAS I thinking? lol, leftovers!! 
Only complaint was the coating didn't stickk to the meat enough, think maybe baked a little hotter than necessary...but it tasted great!!

very good flavor, great for salads. Used bread crumbs instead of corn flakes turned out nice and moist it also had a nice slight crisp on the surface. Only problem, not enough room in my tummy to eat it all :D

While I am  not a fan of dijon or onions I happened to have all ingredients for this recipe while looking for a new way to cook my chicken leg quarters.  Obviously had to cook much longer than the breasts but meat was still juicy with a crispy and flavorful coating.  Can't wait to try it with the breasts.  Excellent!

The melted butter made the cornflake/onion soup mix soggy. The taste was quite good but I couldn't get past the sogginess.

Made these TWO nights in a row!  I used shredded chicken instead of beef, flour tortillas instead of corn, and mild cheddar instead of mozzarella.  Topped them with the green onion as well as olives.  YUM!  Also, frying the tortillas ahead of time makes them less "soggy" or "mushy".  This totally changed my way of making my usual chicken enchiladas!

This was a delicious baked chicken BUT unless you are a lover of onions either downscale the onion soup by about 3/4 or omit it. It is very over powering. Other than that, excellent!

This recipe was so simple and the flavor was great. Surprisingly moist as well. I did double the recipe and had a tough time "fully" coating the 13 chicken breasts I had, so next time I will prepare more cornflake/onion soup mix for the breading.

Good recipe if you're looking for something new to try with chicken, not a big fan of dijon mustard, but once all the other spices/flavors are added, it tastes pretty good.  I liked how the crust stayed on after baking!

Just made this last night and it was great. I used Panko crumbs and only half of the onion soup mix. the only thing I may change the next time would be to use a little more Grey Poupon or choose a dijon with a little more kick.

My daughter, who usually likes fairly mild food, thought this could use a little more flavour. It was tender and juicy, though, so I may try it again with some more garlic and a dash of hot sauce, and marinating it longer. It is so easy to make that I would hate to just give up on it. Thanks!

I didn't add the onion soup but followed everything else and I loved it. I did slice the chicken breasts in half so they would cook in the 25 minute time frame. I sat the chicken on a cookie cooling rack over a 9x13" pan so the chicken would be crispy on both sides. This is a keeper.

I made half the chicken as directed and a couple of pieces without onion pack, just corn flakes. Delicious both ways.

I didn’t have any corn flakes, so I substituted Panko crumbs. I only had about 1/4 cup sour cream, so I mixed ranch dressing with it. But it turned out moist and tender, not as dry as skinless chicken breasts can be. My family loved it, so I will make it again.

Hubby and I loved this chicken and he asked me to keep it in the rotation. The chicken was the most moist and tender chicken I ever ate. I used Nancy's mustard. After reading the reviews I crushed up my cornflakes really well so the onion soup would mix better with it. I really liked the flavor the cornflakes gave, and the amount of soup mix didn't overpower. If you don't like the soup mix you can substitute other spices, but really, this is wonderful!

This was a hit. I boned and skinned 6 chicken thighs instead of breasts, and used cornflake crumbs.

I know there are those who hate it when people change up a recipe as they feel you aren’t really reviewing the true recipe. I am right there with you, however, I had to change this because my husband is gluten intolerant. So, instead of cornflakes I used instant potato flakes and instead of onion soup mix, which is not gluten free, I found a recipe for GF onion soup mix and and truth is, it’s better than the packaged. I also used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. There you have it - a delicious gluten free option.

Good results followed the recipe, but I did leave out the onion soup mix. Also cooked in air fryer which gave it a very crispy crust.

As is often the case, I did not have exactly the right ingredients.  I used chicken thighs, greek yogurt, Special K, and omitted the onion soup mix.  It was delicious:  tangy from the yogurt and mustard and very crispy.  This is just what I like, easy and good.

This was a great recipe. Simple ingredients and easy to put together. The smell was wonderful. I use very large chicken breast and had to bake about 15 extra minutes to get the temp to 165. Very moist and flavorful. We will make this one again for sure.

I made this but my breading didn't really come out crispy it was kind of soggy. The flavor was good but the coating just wasn't there. Any suggestions? I would try this again.

Added some Organo, Basil and Mrs Dash and used Panko bread crumbs. Very tasty and Krispy. the family loved it. I did leave it bake for 50 min because I used some pretty thick chicken breast.

I made this for dinner last week ( husband and myself) and we both absolutely loved it, not a bite left. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly. It's this amazing balance of flavor, crunchy from the topping and the chicken is kept moist. It was so good, that we are having it again this week.

We found this recipe to be quite good. The meat was moist with good flavor - just an underlying hint of the mustard. I used 6 large chicken thighs (skin and fat removed), baked for about 35 minutes in pan sprayed with Pam. I did drizzle with the butter but next time will skip because it didn't seem to add anything except calories! I actually marinated the meat in the sour cream mixture for 4 hours. Since we like a lot of coating, I used 2 cups crushed cornflakes with the entire onion packet. We did have 1 or 2 salty bites, so other reviewers are right about making sure you keep stirring the coating mix!

It was delicious. I didn't get the cornflakes crunchy though. I'm sure that was me bc whenever I make fried chicken it's never crunchy.

This recipe was frigging awesome!  I did add ground up salad croutons to the coating as well.  Very crispy and delicious!  Almost as good as deep frying without the mess and the hassle.

The chicken turned out very moist and tender, and this dish was quick and easy to make. Used spicy brown mustard instead of dijon and added more spices, like salt, pepper, extra garlic, and Montreal Steak seasoning to the chicken before I coated it in the sour cream mixture. I only had a honey cluster cornflake-like cereal available, and I figured it would give it a sweeter taste, but it was not too sweet when mixed with the onion soup mix. Just such a delicious take on a well-known favorite!

I used Panky breading as I had no corn flakes.  And used dry Italian dressing instead of onion soup mix. Absolutely loved the flavor! But next time, I won't drizzle butter before baking as the drizzled butter made the breading mushy and I like crunchy. Will definitely do again as the family enjoyed it too.

Good.. I made it exactly the way it was written.  My 18 yr old daughter and 13 yr old son liked it…my 15 yr old daughter thought it was ok.  I just used two chicken breasts and cut them to make 4 total because we aren't big eaters.  I did double the amount of cornflakes, but that's the only change I made.  I would make again.

I made without sour cream. I used a bit extra butter and added some low fat ranch dressing instead. I used funions and the onion mix instead of cornflakes and it was a bit too much.
My version was butter, garlic, mustard, funions and chicken. Smeared some ranch on top before dipping in the garlic/mustard butter mix

The onion soup mix made this way too salty.  However, the chicken was very moist which I loved.   In other words, use the marinade but forget the onion soup mix.  Next time I will add dried onion flakes to the crushed cornflakes and a small amount of seasoning salt.

Delicious and easy.  I substituted Raisin bran cereal, sans the raisins, they were a tasty treat separately, and yellow mustard (a little less than called for)  as I had no Dijon or brown mustard on hand.  I used a spice mix (Trader Joe's grinder of Everyday spice mix) instead of Onion Soup Mix as they almost always have MSG which I avoid completely. I cut everything down about a quarter as I only baked a single large (organic) chicken breast.  It was delicious paired with steamed asparagus and a small baked potato. Oh yes...and a brown ale.  Yum!

This was a great dish, my family loved it! I put my own spend on it after reading reviews. I used ranch dressing, sour cream & spicey ranch dry mix packet. I also used ritz crackers, honey bunches of Oates flakes. I put garlic powder & fresh rosemary in the flake mixture, which really made the chicken pop with flavor! I used a spice rub,  lotta zing that I get from golden chick. My family couldn't stop raving about it & devoured it all. I made a strawberry green salad, which really complimented the chicken. Will definitely be making this again. The spice was not over powering

My entire fam loves this chicken.  The only suggestion  is to be sure and only leave a small coating of the sour cream on the chicken, if there is to much on it the crusty outside ends up soggy and not so good! Otherwise, a great change for chicken.

Very easy and very delicious. The only change I made was to substitute panko bread crumbs (what I had on hand) instead of crushed cornflakes. I only had about 10 minutes to let the chicken marinade, and it still was tasty. I used two large chicken breasts (1.7 pounds), pounded them down and cut them into 4 pieces. Even after that, they took 35-40 minutes to bake to the proper temperature. A tip I love: use a gallon sized Ziploc bag, add the breading (or cornflakes) and onion soup mix, shake it up really well, then add the chicken in to coat it. This is definitely a keeper, only next time, I'll try it with smaller pieces of chicken for faster cooking.

This was a very easy and fantastic recipe. My parents raved about how tender the chicken was. I served with a side of wild rice and green beans. It was a hit. I like recipes that are easy to tweak with what you have in the house and this is definitely one of them. Will be used again!!!

Very tasty and moist.  I omitted the dry onion soup as one of my dinners is on a low sodium diet. I, however like my salt and even though no additional salt was added, I found the dish just right.  I will do this one again.  It was quick enough for a weeknight.

I give this recipe a 4 star because the chicken itself was very moist and I will definitely make a version of it again, but I did not like the onion soup mix. The flavor was too strong for my taste and I didn't even use the whole packet.

Made the mistake of using chicken with skin.  Make sure you don't do that, it will be a greasy disaster.

This was pretty amazing. Even my hubby enjoyed it. I did pound my chicken breast out for better baking, but everything about this from the wet ingrediants to the dry ingrediants was spot on. Went great with some pasta and veggies on the side.

Was great!  A few alterations to make it a bit more low-cal: use fat-free plain Greek yogurt in place of sour cream...tastes EXACTLY the same! ...and use PAM rather than butter.  Will make again and again...

I must have done something wrong because my chicken was soggy and the cornflakes slid off.  Maybe by chicken breasts were too thick?  I will try again with a super thin breast.

Really liked it. Had lots of flavor & very tender. I only used 1/2 pkg of onion mix as others suggested & I also added a little more cornflakes.  The top of the chicken had lots of crunch but the bottom was a little soggy.

The flavors are great!  Wow!  I've made other cornflake and chicken recipes before, but those pale in comparison to this.  Hubby thinks it is one of the best things I've ever made.

Good, very tender. Used Ritz cracker because I don't have cold cereal in the house. Also used chicken tenders. Cooked in 18 minutes. Next time I am going to use a bacon onion spice pack I bought at a craft fair. This onion soup was a little strong.
I will keep using this recipe but change up the spices and coating to find one I really like.

Ok, so I'm an idiot -- 1 cup of cornflakes is NOT equal to 1 cup of crushed corn flakes and I didn't read enough reviews to realize that you need more than 1 cup of cornflakes for this recipe.  In fact, just after I put the chicken in the oven I noticed that there was a recipe on the corn flake box that said to crush 7 cups of cornflakes down to 1 3/4 cups!  My guess is that you actually need 4-5 cups of cornflakes to produce 1 cup of "crushed corn flakes".   Having said that, the recipe was delicious, I wound up adding about 2 TSB of mayonnaise to the sour cream just because I was shy on sour cream and I think it gave some extra flavor.  I will definitely make this again!

Very good.  I have made something similar using mayonaisse and parm cheese.  But this gives it a better taste I think using sour cream and onion soup mix.  Everyone loved it.  Came out crunchy and very very moist.

Amazing. Simple and easy but so so good! I left out the last step of drizzling melted butter over the breast and they were still moist and delicious. My boyfriend went back for seconds! I served with yellow saffron rice and steamed vegetables. We loved this. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe. :)

I made these last night for dinner and everyone loved them. I made a few changes to make them more enjoyable for my 12 and 6 yr old. I left out the garlic and the onion soup.  I used honey Dijon mustard and added a package of Hidden Valley Ranch mix to the sour cream mixture before coating the chicken.  The ranch added a nice taste. Will definitely make again.

I thought this was okay, but my husband really liked it a lot.  Followed the recipe to the letter, but I guess I just didn't like the flavor combination of cornflakes and onion soup mix. I'm giving it 4 stars for the husband endorsement.

This was good BUT the onion soup was overpowering and way too salty.  I will try this again but with dried onions and my own seasonings.  Sour cream amount was excessive I thought but the flavor from the combination of the sour cream and dijon was good.  I used corn flakes but will probably try it again with panko or regular bread crumbs. Not one of my favorite receipes from this site and I have never had a dud using them.

My mom thought this was ok but I found this to be the worst recipe ive tried from this site and I NEVER have had a bad recipe experience from here till now. If your not a fan of onion soup I defenitely wouldnt try this. The flavor just was not at all tasty to me. It wasnt even making any sense to me while I was making it :/

My family absolutely loved this chicken.  They inhaled it, after just a few weeks ago sticking their nose up at the thought of using crushed corn flakes in the breading.  It turned out perfect and they've already asked when I am fixing it again.

this recipe was bomb. we substituted ritz crackers for cereal and it worked out great i think panko would work too. part of what makes this recipe four stars is its apparent adaptability.  i think it would also work just fine without the onion soup and simply adding seasonings to your liking.

Did not like this.  I'll probably try it again without the onion soup mix - it seemed to overwhelm it.
