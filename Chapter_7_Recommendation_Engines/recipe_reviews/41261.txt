Extremely tasty, only reason it wasn't a five star was I found there was a little too much lemon flavor

I love this soup! For those that said you couldn't taste the apple I wonder which type of apples were used? I usually opt for tart green apples and find the flavour to be just present, but not overpowering. I use slightly less broth (4 cups) to avoid having an overly watery soup and I always leave out the cream entirely - the soup is so yummy, there's simply no need for it. I've made this soup a few times now, and the only changes I made aside from those mentioned above is adding three small-medium carrots, if they're on hand, and putting goat cheese on top before eating.

A great, hearty soup, but next time I would opt to omit the lemon: it was just a bit overpowering.

Fantastic Fall soup!  Rather than garnishing with goat cheese, parsley is a nice alternative.  To really spice it up, add cinnamon!

Yum!  I changed a few things, mainly due to ingredients I didn't have on hand.  I had no chicken stock or cream, so I used water and added 1 Tbsp of soy sauce to each cup of liquid (an allrecipes ingredient substitution suggestion).  I used a few tablespoons of lemon juice and doubled the apple.  I served it in Taste of Home's Bread Bowls (recipe available on allrecipes).  We really enjoyed it.  Thank you so much for sharing!

I enjoyed this soup, but I had a difficult time getting it to a soup-consistency and not having little carrot bits in it.  I used a braeburn apple, which may not have been tart enough. I used vegetable stock to keep it vegetarian, and this worked fine.  Since some reviews said there was too much lemon, I mixed lemon juice with cranberry, and this worked well. Also added some cinnamon!

Everyone in my family LOVED this, even my 8 month old. I used 3 apples, cored and sliced with a corer before baking, then they peeled easily.

My family and I didn't care for this at all. I followed the recipe exactly, but it still was not something we cared for. I didn't even like it enough to try to play around with it to see if I could make it more suitable for us.

This was good. I couldn't taste the apple, so if I made it again I'd probably use 3 instead of one and leave one of them cut in pieces instead of blended in with the rest of the ingredients. I added garlic and a bit of pepper and nutmeg to spice it up a bit. Perfect for a chilly fall or winter day!

This is a great soup to serve in the autumn time, it warms you right up! I love how simple it is, and it has lots of great vitamins and nutrients. If the lemon is too much, try a small lemon or perhaps less juice. The apple is awsome.

I agree with the others - omit the lemon - it really does overpower the soup. I used the feta cheese and also omitted the salt as I thought the feta would add enough of its own salt. I couldn't taste the apples and that was fine with me. I used unsweetened almond milk instead of cream to lower the calories. I will make this again and maybe try to hide some greens in here to get more veggies into the kids.

This is excellent, but it's definitely a taste for experienced palates.  I've varied the salt from none to a TB, and it's delicious both sweet and savory!  I did leave out the lemon, and dumped everything but the cream and feta in the crockpot (then added them just before serving): easy peasy!

I used three sweet potatoes and excluded the lemon as suggested by others.  I almost wish I'd included the lemon just to know whether that might add a little extra to the soup as otherwise the soup tends to be a little on the bland side.  However ours could have been bland from the extra sweet potato, and salt and pepper helped bring out the flavors a lot.  I used feta as the garnish and would have preferred something different, such as perhaps grated parmesan or a dollop of sour cream.

This soup was a HIT! Even my husband loved it, and he doesn't like sweet potato.
I gave this a 4 star because I forgot to add the lemon...Next time I make this, I will add less salt and more apples!

Wonderful soup! THRILLED with this recipe as a base. I omitted the cream and the lemon and used only one tablespoon oil. No cheese needed. It was so good!

I liked this soup. I left out the carrots and lemon because I didn't have any, but I think the carrots would have helped with the flavor. I'll try it without the cream next time to cut the calories.

Just lovely!  I served this with my first ever Thanksgiving meal cooked by myself.  It was the perfect appetizer and the flavors were awesome.  I think I used a little extra cheese on each, but really, who wouldn't?!!

Just made this for the 3rd time (I was finally able to use a bay leaf and an immersion blender!). I LOVE IT! I think this is the best soup I have ever made and couldn't be more proud to serve it to my family on Thanksgiving. I have never added cheese to the top - I don't think it needs it - but followed the recipe to a T otherwise. Keep to the directions and you'll have a sweet-yet-savory winner on your hands!

This recipe is pretty decent, but the end result, for me, lacked balance. I agree that there is simply too much acid from the lemon juice. It's too disproportionately high to the rest of the recipe. I'd also have liked a bit more apple flavor as well. Overall, the soup was well received by everyone, myself included, but I'm definitely going to monkey with it to make it mine. Oh, I also used goat milk instead of cream, which worked nicely.

I boiled the sweet potatoes and apple instead of cooking them in the oven.  I omitted the carrots.  I used vitamin D milk.  I also pureed the feta with the rest of the mixture.  I used 24 oz. sweet potatoes because that's what I had.  Turned out fine.  I got 7 large servings out of it.

It turned out great. My dad is a meat man so I had to add chopped up fried pork. (I didn’t have chicken.) I also added a little more than 1/2 c real maple syrup. Also, I sweated the veggies that needed sautéing. What I mean is I kept the temperature at medium and put a lid on the pot. I stirred the veggies every so often and kept them like that for 20 minutes. Nice and soft. It tasted very good.

Yummy soup, due to reviews, I only added half the mount of lemon and it was a perfect amount. I did have to add other spices to get a little more flavor. Garlic powder, paprika, cinnamon, and nutmeg. This isn't jaw dropping amazing but I definitely enjoyed it.

Loved it!!! Followed some suggestions and added an extra apple. Omitted the cream and added 1/2 cup fat free milk, it's what I had on hand. Also, sprinkled bacon on top -(no cheese) and sautéed veggies in bacon grease instead of olive oil. OMG Delicious!!!

Outstanding.  I used two apples, juice of half a lemon, and a tsp. of lemon zest.  The consistency was just right-creamy.

wow this is super weird. others were right about the carrots not blending well, which i've never experienced before. here's what i did, aka what not to do: didn't use the full lemon, but put in a bit of lemon juice. used two mac apples and two carrots. used beef broth. didn't use any form of cream or milk. liked the goat cheese though.

3 stars as is. Too much lemon for my taste, just like many others stated. 

Made a few adjustments of my own which I really loved:
2 Granny Smith apples
Used about 1/4th of what was called for for lemon
Added a bit of cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, ginger, brown sugar
