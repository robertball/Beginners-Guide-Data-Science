Made this for pool party we went to yesterday and it was hit with everybody. I followed the smaller recipe amount for 12 servings. Didn't use Hellmann's mayo, just used our favorite light Kraft mayo. I did add in a tablespoon of sugar since Hellman's tends to have a sweeter taste. I also used red potatoes and didn't need the full amount of mayonnaise, I added until it reached a good consistency, about 1 1/2 cups total. More than likely because red potatoes are smaller. I also added in more of the olives and pickles. People were getting seconds and raving about it and asking for the recipe. We loved this salad and will be making it again. Now I must email the recipe to some friends. Thanks Lela, a real hit.

I love the fact that this recipe got published, now I could care less if mine, which is the same one minus green olives, gets published or not.  
This IMO, is the only way to have potato salad! It is not sweet and tastes Fabulous!!  Perfect salad for  any occasion!  Thanks Lela and I don't have to tell you I will be making this for the rest of my Life!

I'm a huge fan of tangy and tart combinations so I thought this salad was fantastic. My husband doesn't like tart things at all, so I get it all to myself...even better!

Great potato salad!!! Loved the crunch of the pickles! This recipe makes a lot and is great for large crowds :) Update: Made this again for the 4th of July and was another successful hit at our family barbecue! This year, I diced the pickles, onions, and olives up into smaller pieces to get more flavor in every bite. The smaller dice turned out to be a just what it needed! 5 stars a second year in a row!

good potato salad!  I loved all the olives and pickles.  I even used regular old potatoes that you buy in the 10lb bag.

I can't believe I never thought to put olives in potato salad! (I added green pepper too because in my brain, dill pickles and green pepper belong together, but it would have been delicious even without the GP.) What I liked best about it is that it isn't loaded with sugar or vinegar. The amount of both present in the mayonnaise is plenty.

I added some honey and it really helped to round out the flavor. Was also really good without it though.

Fabulous recipe. My variations due to time and ingredient availability: cut up potatoes before boiling (con: mushy outsides), saut√©ed onions (because I can't stand crunchy onions), 2 cups mayo only. You could cut the olives down up to half and be okay too.

This was okay and enjoyed the olives and pickles, but won't be making this one again.
