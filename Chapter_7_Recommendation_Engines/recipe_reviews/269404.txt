I wanted to keep the almonds really visible in the cookie, so I didn't stir them in, but rather  pressed the dough balls into the almonds so they embedded in the dough.   These were delicious .. next time I would add more orange zest.

I added just a touch more amaretto, and then dipped one side in chocolate for an added zing.  Great recipe

This is a delicious little shortbread cookie to add to this year's  holiday cookie platter.  I followed Linda T's lead and added the almonds on the top to add interest, and it lets anyone with nut allergies know that nuts are involved.
