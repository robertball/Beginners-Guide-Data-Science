This was my first attempt at making a brittle, and wanted to do something with our homemade maple syrup. I loved how simple this recipe is and the flavor is absolutely delicious. Iâ€™ll definitely make this again, using this recipe, and will likely try variations including dark chocolate chips, shredded coconut, salt. Thanks to my friends at Maplewood Farms, I resolved foaming by coating the inside lip of the pot with butter.
