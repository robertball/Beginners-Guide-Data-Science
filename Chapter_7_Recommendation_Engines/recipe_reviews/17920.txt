I thought this came out very good, and I have some odd results with my new bread machine sometimes. I left out the hot sauce, because I don't like it, and scaled it down a bit to fit in my machine, but it came out great. Very light and not dense at all, I found. And the crust was nice and crunchy. I will try it again for sure.

This really is an excellent recipe.  The crust is quite crisp and the inside has a nice, firm texture.  This is a good sandwich bread.

This is the first loaf of bread that my new bread maker has truly successfully made. It must be fool proof! I did not use the hot sauce and I used self rising yellow corn meal. All my ingredients were at room temp (except the water, which I heated in the microwave with the automatic "beverage" button. I added the dry ingredients first (contrary to my machine's instructions), then the yeast in the corner, and then the water/oil to the other corner. It's best if you do not directly scoop out your flour with the measuring cups...in other words, it shouldn't be packed tightly in the measuring cups, so use a spoon to scoop into the cups first. The crust is crispy and the bread is soft and light with a hint of cornmeal. Use the lightest setting on your machine.

This yeast cornbread lives up to its name--its crust turns out really crunchy. I loved it. I baked it in the oven for 30 minutes at 375 in a 9x5 pan. I also added about 1/2 t. more salt.

Crust was great and taste was good but way too heavy, dense loaf that made a 2lb weight loaf, but it did not fill pan.

Easy interesting hybrid of regular bread and cornbread.  Turned out really well for chili night.  It also makes very delicious toast, somewhat similar to english muffin bread.  Would definately make again, got the thumbs up from my family.

My family loved this bread.  It's a little grainy, a pretty color, a change from eating regular white or wheat.  Delicious toasted, for sandwiches or plain.  Perfect for breakfast or with dinner!

I made this with all whole wheat flour, but do not add any more water as suggested by one reviewer.  Let the breadmaker start to mix and add if necessary. I added it at the beginning and it was like soup and had to quickly compensate with more WW flour.  Otherwise, this was very heavy with the change in the flour, but actually was better the next day.  Will make again.

For some reason, my bread was a little soggy on the bottom.  I agree with everyone that this is not cornbread.  It's also not the typical bread that comes out of my bread machine.  It's some kind of weird hybrid.  If you keep in mind that it's suppose to have essence of cornbread, it's not bad.  Otherwise it's a big disappointment. It takes more like hush puppy batter without all the good mix-in's.  Next time I think I'll add more sugar. If there is a next time.

Not cornbread in my opinion.  Good if you like white bread with a crunchy crust. The next day I used the leftover bread to make french toast and it turned out very good.

I made this bread to go along with a bowl of my turkey taco stew. It came out great! My family raved about it! and even my husband, who is often not a fan of the bread machine breads, loved it! we used the rest the next morning for toast. Delicious!! i changed a few things a little: instead of vegetable oil i like to use coconut oil for both the nutritional boost and flavor, and i added a big tablespoon of honey for extra sweetness. Thank you for this recipie!!

My manager at work gave me a bread machine and I never got around to using it until now.    I didn't have a lot of ingredients but wanted something heartier than plain white bread.  I also didn't want to take too much of a chance my first time using the machine.     This bread is really good.  Crusty on the outside, soft (but not too soft) on the inside.  It is like white bread with a nicer color and texture.  I used the basic medium crust setting on the machine.

Not much corn flavor.  My husband liked it though because it doesn't like cornbread, so he liked that there wasn't much corn taste.

I don't think you can call this a cornbread, but it's a pretty good white bread with a pleasant texture. Will make it again, but I'll look further for another (real) cornbread recipe for bread machine.

I made this in the oven, and cooked it at 375 deg. for 30 minutes, in an 8 " skillet. Very tasty, and great texture. Thanks for the recipe!

This bread is very light, great texture and a nice crispy crust but the cornmeal is much too crunchy, it's not cooked. I will make this terrific bread again but because we prefer cornmeal cooked I will soften the cornmeal first.  I think if I soak the cornmeal in the warm water for a bit, re-heat the water/cornmeal mixture before putting it in the bread machine the results should be a "no crunch" cornmeal - I hope.  I'm sure more water will be required if the cornmeal is soaked.

My family really enjoyed this corn bread. However, I'd use a little extra hot sauce to give it a kick.

I did not care for this bread at all.  The loaf came out fine, but I prefer my cornbread sweet.  Unfortunately this cornbread isn't even slightly sweet. I should have guessed when the ingredients called for only a tablespoon of sugar. That made me suspicious when I was putting it together.  Rather disappointing, because this recipe came so highly rated.

Made it with 2 cups wheat flour substituted, will go all wheat and a little more cornmeal next time but still turned out 5 stars. Half the loaf was gone in 30 minutes (mostly by me) and the crust is amazing :)

I was pleasantly surprised at how well this bread turned out. I always have to add an extra half cup of flour to my bread machine recipes otherwise there is too much moisture and the loaf will fall. My husband even thought that this is one of the better recipes that I have tried, and he doesn't usually care for bread done in the machine. I don't really care for the dry crust that bread machines tend to make, so I wrap the loaf in plastic wrap when it is warm. This really helps the crust to stay soft. Since the bread is usually eaten in a day or two, I don't worry about the extra moisture in the loaf.

This recipe was surprising; I wouldn't exactly call this bread a cornbread, but I don't think it would make good sandwich bread, either, as some reviewers suggested.  We enjoyed the taste very much, and the smell was d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s.
