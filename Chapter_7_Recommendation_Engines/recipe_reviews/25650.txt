Yum! I had adjusted the serving to a third and used it for my butter flake cresent rolls (pillsbury; 8 triangles). Scooped a  tablespoon for each pastry and added more raisins for an equal bite. The only thing I did different was that I didn't add eggs to it and didn't 
soak the raisins with brandy (formnon-alcoholics),instead, used whatever juice I have on hand. You may use with or without sour cream.

A sweet, but yet wonderful zip so too speak, soft on the taste buds, yet just the right amoumt too make your cheeks shiver, wonderful filling.

My appetizers included rum soaked raisins instead of brandy. Everything tasted great! I also added crushed nut on top of the cheese filling.
