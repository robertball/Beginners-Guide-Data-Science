I made this cake for my mom's bday because she LOVES milky ways.  It was really yummy, but I have some advice...  The recipe calls for pecans, I didn't have any, so I used sliced almonds...  but I really wished I had left the nuts out... not only because my 2 brothers dont eat nuts and they were very dissapointed when they found out there was nuts in the cake, but also because I didnt feel as though they belonged in the cake, and if you think about it, milky ways dont have nuts, so they really shouldn't be in the cake!  ALSO, very important, the frosting...  I had the cake on a raised cake plate.  Once it cooled, and the frosting cooled, I poured it over the cake, but not all of it because it was very very 'liquidy' and it drizzled down the sides, it was a big mess, it dripped off of the cake plate and onto my counter.  The frosting was very yummy, but if it was thicker, it would have been much better.  Alot of it did stay on the cake , but alot of it also dripped right off, and I still had 1/2 of it left that I poured on individual pieces when serving. YUM 
Good Luck!!

This cake was a hit with my family.  It was nice and moist and the frosting was the best part.  I had the fun size milky way bars not the normal size bars and 14 of the fun size bars are equal to 8 of the normal bars the recipe calls for.

I made this for my husband for his birthday and everyone really liked it. Snickers are one of his favorite candy bars so I used those and left out the pecans. The frosting was his favorite part!
