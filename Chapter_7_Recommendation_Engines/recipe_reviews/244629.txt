I was really excited to try this recipe because it seemed like a nice baked good to have for breakfast or with tea. I wasn't wowed with the result, though. I really like the flavor of molasses but thought it was overpowering here. The texture did change after a few days, and it tasted better when I warmed it up a bit today. If I try the recipe again, I would replace some of the molasses with honey and/or add some apple or pear to cut the bitterness. Make sure you watch the bake time - mine was done after 1 hour.

Parkin is a ginger cake from Yorkshire in England that is typical for Bonfire Night (5th November). I don't really understand why this recipe doesn't have ginger in it! I added ground ginger to my recipe to give it authenticity. I found that my Parkin sank in the middle throughout the whole time in the oven. I preheated properly, didn't open the door, measured and mixed correctly and in the right order etc. so not sure why it should sink except that the temperature isn't right? I read somewhere that most cakes are baked at 350 F so perhaps it needed to be baked at that slightly higher temperature but for less time...? Anyway, the cake takes good (although ginger is an absolute MUST for Yorkshire Parkin!!)

I learned about Parkin while watching Escape To The Country.  It sounded like something we’d like, so  when I found this recipe, I had to try it!  It’s like a very hearty gingerbread.  I followed the recipe, except to add a tsp and a half of ginger and 2 tablespoons of minced crystallized ginger after reading that Parkin has ginger in it.  Very tasty!  I will make this again!

This parkin is delicious and perfect for fall! The oats give it a nice, chewy texture. Definitely let it rest for a couple of days so it gets good and gooey.
