I used this recipe as a starting point. I like to create my own varaitations. I had a plan to slow cook a beef chuck roast with some green enchilada sauce. This recipe gave me the idea to add the broth which I definately recommend for flavor as well as moisture. I buy low sodium because the sauce and taco mix already have enough. From another recipe I used half a chopped onion to line the bottom, placed the roast on top and added the enchilada sauce and a can of green chili's, broth and topped with cilantro. This made some wonderful meat to be used in burritos taco, enchilada's or just over rice and beans. It was not spicy so add some heat if you like or simply eat with hot sauce as we did.

WE LOVE THESE. No, really. I thought we were the only family who made them this way. It comes out like carnitas. I use my own homemade taco seasoning and Campbell's beef broth. Always a hit. NOTE: This also works with chicken and chicken broth.

This looked interesting, so with a pot-roast in hand and no desire to break out the Lipton + C of M soup, I gave it a try.  What can I say except EASY and delicious.  Served it the first day as soft tacos.  Leftovers went into an enchilada-casserole thing that DH favors.  I plan to try this next with a pork shoulder roast and call it M's Easy Carnitas.

I have to say right off the bat that this recipe needs to cook a LOT longer than 4 hours on low.  At 4 hours it wasn't nearly ready to shred.   At 6 hours it was closer and then by 8 hours it was good to go. (I am really glad I started it at 5 AM for dinner that night.)   I used mild green salsa and I should have used medium or hot.  My chuck roast was 2 1/2 lbs, I used the full amount of salsa and taco seasoning and only one can of broth. (I could have used less broth and it would have been fine.)  I did layer thick slices of onion on the bottom of the crock pot & then fished them out before I added the shredded beef back into the juices.  Next time I will use a hotter salsa and add a couple of whole jalapenos and a bay leaf.

Gotta love it...4 ingredients.  I was trimming this roast...very dense, firm and what I felt would be inedible.  I used ONLY the listed ingredients....  extremely RARE for me but I restrained myself.  In absence of the bi-focals I left it in the crock-pot for 14 hours rather than 4.  That inedible piece of meat is the tastiest thing I've eaten in a long time.  The beef soaked up all the broth and salsa and although I like it hot, the spiciness was evened out by the extended cooking.  Next on the list is chicken and pork.  As stated in prior reviews, this can be used in many different dishes....tacos, enchilladas, salads, flautas.  Simple and inexpensive.

I changed nothing in this recipe as far as what the recipe called for to make. I decided instead of using jar green salsa and taco seasoning. I'd make mine fresh and use equivalent measurements it asked for to stay true to the recipe. What I found that others were talking about how, 4 hours wasn't enough time to cook the meat. And will agree to that. There is no way 5 pounds of meat being a chuck roast will cook in a slow cooker in 4 hours. Mine was done in 7. I feel there was too much broth mixture in when it was done, I did shred the meat and place it back in the broth, but I strained out about a cup and a half of the broth and reserved it to the freezer for another time. The meat held no flavor as it was in the broth. My family said it was fine but I thought it was ok.  Sorry, it's not something I'll be making again.

All I can say is WOW these are amazing!!! I used a smaller roast and used 1 can beef broth and half a jar of picante sauce instead of the green salsa and that was the only change I made. I will be making these again, the husband loved these also!!! thanks for the recipe :)

Such an easy recipe. Just throw it all in the slow cooker. I cooked it for about 6-8 hours it wasn't really shreddable at 4 hours. Also, I would imagine you can use any salsa.

I think this was a good start. I will not add so much broth next time as I felt it was very runny when you assemble the tacos; even after draining. I used green salsa, and did everything the same. I will also add perhaps some chili powder, and diced chilis for some kick.

You can play around with this quite a bit. I added a can of green chilis. I enjoyed my tortillas filled with this mixture and also had them in lettuce leaves. Tasty change from ground beef.

I agree with other reviewers.  I don't know how this could cook in the slow cooker for 4 hours.  Mine took 6-1/2 hours and then sat in the warmer another 45 minutes.  Definitely leave yourself more time to prepare. I used a jar of hot green jalapeno salsa.  I thought it was going to be very spicy and flavorful.  I was disappointed in the flavor.  Most of the spice & heat seemed to dissipate in the beef broth.  If I made this again - I would have make several adjustments to fit our taste. 1/14/12 Just wanted to add a note.  Still didn't have the heat and spice we liked, but, after the shredded beef sat in the sauce overnight - it had much better flavor the next day.

This was good but not I-can't-wait-to-make-it-again good.  I followed the recipe except that I had to let it cook all day, about 12 hrs. The meat was nice and tender but the flavors were nothing remarkable.

I had made French Dip Sandwiches the day before and had a lot of beautifully seasoned shredded chuck and broth left over.  Instead of green salsa, I added a tiny can of green chilies, a packet of taco seasoning mix and some of the well-seasoned broth from the French Dip sandwiches.  I put all the ingredients in a pot on the stove, since everything was already cooked, and just let it simmer while I heated up the tortilla's, shredded some Cheddar, finely sliced some lettuce, diced a tomato, pulled out the sour cream and dinner was amazing.  Really wish I had taken a picture of our taco masterpiece but by the time I thought of it, over half was already gone!  We will definitely do this again.  Good way to use up shredded beef when there are only 2 of you and I've never seen a one pound chuck roast...ever!

Great flavor. Though I did add some stuff that I had on hand. I added can of tomatillos, jalapeno, 2 garlic cloves, an onion and I only used 1 cup of water. I still had quite a bit of broth left but it was so good that we were dipping our tortillas in it. YUM.

Thanks for this basic recipe which I made today. I used my pressure cooker to make this, I seasoned and browned the roast first, then added all the ingredients and cooked at medium pressure for about 30 min. for a 2+ lb. roast.  VERY tender, shredded perfectly, very moist.  Other than cooking method, I followed recipe exactly (except that I make my own taco seasoning with less salt) I think everyone's version of this will be different depending on what salsa you use, but my tip is to cook the roast in smaller sections, not whole, so that the juice & spices cook into more of the meat.

Cooked as is, it seemed not very flavorful. I used all ingredients listed and added the following extras: chopped bell pepper and onion, two teaspoons cumin, 1 crushed garlic clove and 1 teaspoon of beef bouillon and cooked for 6 hours.  After shredding the meat I put it back in the crock pot with the juices for another hour.It was out of this world fabulous.  My kids and hubby kept commenting on how good it smelled while cooking and they all went back for seconds!!!

I agree with the others as far as cooking time goes.  It should really be 8 hours for that amount of meat.  I have made this at least six times and it is loved by all.  The only modifications I made was to only use one can of broth and add diced Ortega chiles and three jalapeño peppers that were sliced in half.  The peppers add the kick the original recipe was missing.

I bought a chuck roast at the store and needed a recipe.  So when I found this, figured I'd give it a shot.  Mine was only 2.5 lbs, but I still used the full packet of taco seasoning, can of beef broth and 16 oz of Salsa Verde.  I did add 4 tbsp of diced green chiles to it also.  I made this in my dutch oven, and even in that on a steady medium setting, it did take 5-6 hours till the meat was tender enough to shred.  However, we loved the finished product.  Will definitely be making this a regular staple in our home.

Easy and delicious!  But I cooked mine a LOT longer than 4 hours (closer to 8).  I also used extra spicy taco seasoning with a small jar of diced jalapeno peppers which was too hot, but I still couldn't stop eating it!

My husband and I loved this!  We ate it in taco shells, but I would also use it as filling for enchiladas or fajitas.  I cooked it while I was at work, so it was on low for about 10 hours like all of my crockpot meals are.  It was perfectly tender.

This recipe was awesome. Super easy and the whole family loved it. We made burritos with the meat and then added avocado, cheese and sour cream.

Good Recipe but expensive.  Need to find a better deal on the chuck roast.  Did not make a lot of meat with 2 lbs.

Made it for dinner tonight.  I didn't actually change anything much!  I only had about a 2.5 pound roast and I remembered this recipe too late to put into the slow cooker.  Based on the reviews and my family's taste, here' what I did:  I started by pouring about 1/2 the bottle of green salsa into my roaster pan, sprinkled that with taco seasoning, added a small amount of ground red pepper, put roast in pan and topped with more taco seasoning and the rest of the green salsa.  I only added about 1/2 can or so of beef broth; I figured I'd check it as it cooked to see if it needed more (it didn't).  Anyway, covered, flipped once about halfway through.  The meat was really tasty; however, I don't think 5 pounds of meat would have had much taste, I used half that and 16 ounces salsa and the packet of taco seasoning.  Served as (I guess it's what you'd call them) soft tacos on large flour tortillas with sour cream and shredded Mex cheese blend.  Will make again!  I also wish I'd had some cilantro on hand as one reviewer mentioned adding that.

My husband said that this is the best dinner I have ever served! It was extremely tasty! It was just the two of us but there were no leftovers. I did have to turn the crockpot up to high, though. Low wasn't getting the meat "shreddable".

After 4 hours on low had to cook 2 more hours on high to render the beef shred-ready.  Probably should just do this for 4 hours on high from the start.  When done the meat doesn't absorb the flavor. There was way too much liquid, so I strained it, added a dash of garlic powder, black pepper, chili powder and cumin to taste and then simmered it for 15 minutes.  Then added a cornstarch-water slurry to thicken into a spicy "gravy". I added some (not all) of this to the shredded meat to flavor and moisten.  Made taco and topped with shredded cheddar, sour cream and homemade pico de gallo. Not bad, but it tasted like a spicy pot roast taco.  Doubtful I'll make again, but thanks for putting it out there!

This was awesome and so easy!  I put this in the crockpot overnight for 8 hours then refrigerated it.  I then put the shredded meat in a glass pan and reheated it the oven and broiled for a few minutes.  This is a definite keeper!

These were good! I had 2.5 lbs beef but still used all of the taco seasoning and green salsa.  Only used about 1/2 bed broth so it wouldn't be too liquidy.  Will make again!

I made this in the instant pot using high pressure.  I added extra broth since I wasn't sure if I needed more since I pressure cooked it.  it wasn't necessary.  everything else in the recipe was followed. I had a 4lb chuck roast, so 20 minutes per pound using high pressure and the meat came out great.  had a hard time getting it out because it kept falling apart.  if I change anything next time,  it would be to add some jalapenos to bring up the heat a bit.

I made this as directed, using a 3 lb roast. After 4 hours of slow cooking, it was as tough as leather! The liquid tasted divine, but I couldn't shred the meat. I added a bottle of Corona beer to tenderize the meat and after another 4 hours of slow cooking on high, it was ready. However, the great flavor of the initial recipe was lost. Also, a 3 lb. roast did not yield enough meat for more than four tacos, so definitely use a 5 lb. roast in a 6 qt. slow cooker. I'll try this again but will cook it all day with the original ingredients and hope that that takes care of the toughness issue. Adding the beer may have helped break down the meat, but it definitely ruined the great taste of the salsa and broth. That was my fault, not the fault of the original recipe.

Easy and not bad.  Kind of bland and runny though.  I think next time I'd add more taco seasoning and less beef broth.

Needs a little less broth in my opinion. Next time I make it I will reduce it in 1/2. I cooked the meat overnight (8 hours) It was yummy. Good basic recipe, really good with the tweek of timing.  I served it with the option of flour tortillas and ciabatta buns in case people wanted a sandwich.

I made this with a venison roast (because that's what I had). I cooked it overnight in my crock pot, then shredded the meat and let it refrigerate in the juices for 2 days. It made the meat so tender. The flavor mix was perfect, and both my kids gobbled it up. We served it as tacos with cheese, salsa, Guac, and tomatoes.

I just tried this for dinner today. It's definitely easy and it tastes good, too. I used lean meat(London broil)?? and it was about 3lbs. I used a whole jar of green salsa but used only half of enchilada seasoning(I was out of taco seasoning and I was afraid that it might be a bit too salty if I put a whole packet of it.) and about 1.5-2 Cs of beef broth(I measured the first cup but I added a bit more just to cover up the beef so I'm not sure how much more that was exactly) and it came out good. I think I definitely prefer green salsa over red one. This one was very similar to carnita recipe from here but much easier and less ingredients.

This has become one of our favorite recipes!  We cook on low in a slow cooker while at work (8hours).  We freeze or use the leftover meat later in the week to make amazing beef nachos. Thanks for the recipe - we love it.

These were amazing! I added white onion as another reviewer suggested and 1 jalapeno, leaving half the seeds in. Next time I will add all the seeds from jalapeno and add 2.

Awesome! I used my pressure cooker so was quicker.  I served it over cornbread garnished with pico de gillo, guac, and shredded cheese. Excellent!

excelent and easy, I made it in a pressure cooker done in about an hour. Save the juices for a soup stock after. I also used a couple of different salsas along with the green salsa. I then used the leftover meat mixture to make quasadillas the next day and everyone loved them as well. Got alot of requests for the recipe
