I have a similar recipe I use for Old Chicago's style Italian nachos. Here are my alterations: I make my own chips by cutting up pita bread into nacho sized triangles and lightly toasting them. Regular tortilla chips are a bit too salty with the salt from the meats. I also serve the marinara sauce on the side for dipping, and seed and slice the pepperoncinis before adding them. If you love cheese (and who doesn't?) you can grate some parmesan over it too once it's done baking.

You should read more carefully before reprimandng the person who submitted the recipe.  They do say the sauce is for dipping!

My husband and kids absolutely loved this new way of eating nachos. I used my own homemade pizza sauce. They swarmed over the nachos and inhaled--I didn't even get to try one! I guess I'm gonna have to make this again soon if I'm going to get to try it myself. This recipe's a keeper.

These are delicious, by far my favorite go-to appetizer when we are thinking of eating out at night.  I have made these both with regular tortilla chips and with fried wonton wrappers (just like the restuarant) and I think the wonton wrappers add another dimension to this recipe!

Not bad. While I'm a sucker for authentic nachos, I found these to be a fun change of pace. Actually, If it weren't for these being so dry, I'd award a perfect rating. I definitely woulddn't attempt these again without making TWO very important adjustments. First, I'd fry up my sausage and then add just enough pizza (or spaghetti) sauce to moisten. This time, I drizzled my nachos with sauce as Christina did (over the meat layer). Had I served it on the side, my nachos would have been SUPER dry (even more so than they already were). I'd also change the cooking method. Instead of broiling, I think baking at 350 for 10-15 minutes would yield a better outcome. I nearly burt my nachos and I rarely ever burn anything! Other than slightly modifying how I prepared these, I only made one additional change. I sprinkled my nachos with a couple of sliced green onions  because they just seemed to be missing that little something... I think sliced olives would be a nice touch too, but since my hubs and I don't care for them, I didn't bother. All in all, these were good, but my allegiance still goes to Laura B. for her restaurant style chicken nachos, also on this site. I'm glad to have given your recipe a try, but I'm not a convert just yet.  Thanks anyways, reneeg! :-)

My family absolutely loved this. I didn't have the pepperoni or the banana peppers and I used Cheddar cheese instead of mozerella. I thought it was okay, but like I said the hubby and kids thought it was the best thing ever. My hubby said this recipe is a keeper!

The sauce is supposed to be served as dipping sauce.  I'm not sure how it ended up as a topping.  Just to let you all know!

Recipe Group Selection:  4, February 2012  Big hit in this house.  DH really liked the Italian sausage on this one.  The one change I made was after putting the sausage on the chips, I drizzed the pizza sauce next, and then added the other toppings.  It was much easier than trying to dip and  keep the toppings on.  I broiled in the toaster oven and that worked great.  Thanks reneeg for sharing your nacho recipe.

I made these nachos for Recipe Group.  We loved them!  I just eyeballed the ingredients and in hindsight could have added more.  I used hot Italian turkey sausage and added green onions to the toppings.  Instead of broiling, I baked these at 350 degrees for about 5 minutes, until the cheese was just melted.  This was a nice change and I will make them again!

I made this for the recipe group.  VERY yummy!  Instead of dipping into the pizza sauce I poured it over the cheese (which I meant to pour under and forgot)  then took a fork and kinda mixed the cheese and sauce together.  Added some black olives as well.  This had wonderful flavor and is pretty addicting and hard to stop eating.  I made this for lunch for myself thinking my family wouldn't like it, but now I plan on making it for dinner for them cause I know they'll love it!

I wasn't too keen on these, but DH really liked them. My issues were not ones that are likely to bother other people and have to do with my own taste profile preferences. My DH is a much more accurate judge for these, and he liked them. I did run into the same problem with these that I do with Mexican nachos which is that once they are no longer piping hot, the cheese makes everything stick together. That's just the nature of cheese and I can't fault the recipe for it, but it's something to keep in mind if you're serving to a crowd who isn't already sitting around waiting for them! Thanks for sharing.

Made this for Recipe Group and it was AWESOME!!!!! I don't make major dinners on Saturdays b/c, I like to have a day off from cooking sometimes, lol, so I decided to make this tonight for something fun and different. I layered mine like this: chips, sausage, pepperoni (that I cut into 4th's), pizza sauce (that I drizzled around randomly), cheese, sliced black olives, chopped green onions and chopped hot banana peppers. I also made a side of ranch for dipping. These were sooooo good! My only tiny complaint is that they are a little hard to eat due to the melty, stringy mozzarella, but totally not a big issue, and one that hubby, the little guy and I are willing to put up with in order to enjoy these again and again...a winner, and new favorite for sure~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

YUM YUM YUMMY!!!!!!  Made Exquisite Pizza Sauce from this site & mixed in with the crumbled,cooked sausauge (used mild) until the meat was moist and not too "saucey".  Spread tortilla chips over large baking sheet with release foil, trying to make a single layer.  Spooned lightly sauced sausage on chips. Subbed turkey pepperoni, sliced into strips & sprinkled over chip/sausage mix on tray.  Subbed italian six blend shredded cheese, sprinkling over top of previous ingredients, using a little less than a 1/2 pound.  Sprinkled top with banana pepper rings, then baked at 350 for 25 minutes.   I liked that the nachos stayed crunchy because the sauce is served on the side...nice not to get stuck with "mushy" parts.  Next time I will make it with italian turkey sausage to see if it makes a difference.  Absolutley delicious & certainly a keeper recipe!!!

Nothing like old Chicago nachos. The taste was awful using the tortilla chips not to mention they burned under the broiler with the designated time you specified. Good thing I checked on them halfway through and they were already Black. Absolutely no flavor and I followed the recipe to a T. I do not recommend

These nachos are like everything you love on top of a pizza, without having to make a pizza crust (having added a bit of minced bell pepper, olives and minced red onion).  I thought the tortilla chips might seem a bit strange with the Italian toppings at first, but the flavors complimented the yellow corn chips quite well.   Re: Cocook's comment.  The photo shows these nachos were NOT DIPPED.  The sauce is UNDER the cheese.

Make sure you don't use too much chips (use half bag, not whole bag). Cooked perfectly in iron skillet. Probably 5 stars with less  chips.

We enjoyed these nachos, the banana peppers are a good addition .  What difference does it make how you use the sauce it is in the food either way.

I liked this recipe and would do it with tortilla chips if I were having a party. I took the idea and twisted it a bit for dinner. I sliced a broiled polenta and then arranged them in a deep dish pie plate. Topped next with far Diavolo sauce, cooked chopped Italian sausage, chopped banana peppers, olives and the mozzarella . Came out delicious! Thanks for the inspiration.

These are a keeper! We were at a luncheon Birthday party so I planned these for our Sat. night supper. Very easy and sooo good! Perfect! Fun supper too! The only change I made was to mix the sauce in with the cooked sausage and extra pepperoni. I added choopd pepperchinos to mine. Yummo! Thanks!

My husband and I love these.  Mazzio's Pizza used to have Italian Nachos on their menu as an appetizer, but we would often order it as a meal.  When they removed it from their menu, I started making them at home.  Their recipe (and mine) also includes sliced black olives, green onions, diced tomatoes and seasoned grilled chicken strips.  My husband prefers to use salsa for dipping.  I don't use any sauce at all.

These are REALLY great nachos, but if you want to make them EVEN better, then buy wonton papers (wraps) It's raw dough. 
If you cut them in diagonally and deep fry them and use them instead of tortilla chips they are 10 times more awesome!! 
That is how they make them at the restaurant (OLD CHICAGO)

We were looking for recipes for our super bowl party. This one is definitely a winner. I am making a batch as written and then a veggie batch with veggie chicken chunks,  mushrooms bell peppers and adding feta cheese in addition to mozzarella for some added flavor, as well as the olives and onion as we have some vegetarians coming today. This is a keeper. 
We made a batch last night to try out and they were great. I made myself some without meat and they were still great.

The chips i use is deep fried wontons. Just toss the wontons in the deep fryer for a few minutes and then add the layers of mozzarella cheese, Italian sausage slices, pepperoni and top off with the pepper rings. Dip in a side of Marinara sauce.
