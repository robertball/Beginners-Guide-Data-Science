This recipe is awesome! My boyfriend and I couldn't get enough! I did reduce the water to 2 1/2 cups like someone else suggested. I also left out the carrots, because I didn't have any, but I'm glad I did. It was great with just the chicken and broccoli-and I'm not usually a fan of cooked carrots. I also cooked the chicken with some minced garlic(tossed it in when chicken was almost done, to avoid burning the garlic).   The sauce got thick quickly once I added the cornstarch, but still cooked for 2 min.-stayed the same thickness. Served it over rice and it was PERFECT! Update: I have since made this a few times. My only new changes are I add 1 more Tbs. Soy sauce and about a Tsp. of Worcestershire Sauce. I also add onion powder to the chicken while is cooks with oil and garlic. Yummy!!!

The way I made it,I would give it 5 stars.  I reduced the 3 cups of water to 2 1/2 cups, added minced garlic (to taste) and hoisin sauce (about 2 Tbsp) to the boiling water.  I don't think it was too liquidy.  I saw that someone tried to substitute flour for the cornstarch.  You can't really do that and get the same results.  I used the cornstarch, and it thikened up perfectly and my boyfriend LOVED it.

This recipe overall was good. I tweaked alittle by adding some minced garlic. I didnt have any carrots so I just used broccoli. I seasoned my chicken with garlic and onion powder, adobo, and black pepper. I sauteed some minced garlic in olive oil then added chicken and cooked for about 6 minutes until no longer pink. In a seperate pan I added more of the olive oil and minced garlic then added the broccoli and cooked for about 5 minutes. At the same time in a pot I used 1 1/4 cup of chicken broth and 1 cup of water added the bouillon, soy sauce, cornstarch and once again more minced garlic( I love garlic so much). Once I got my sauce to the consistency I wanted it I combined the chicken, broccoli, and sauce in one pan then simmered for about 5 minutes. It was more like a chicken and broccoli with garlic sauce than a stir fry. I served with yellow rice and it was delicious. Will definitely make again.

I cooked this for my boyfriend and I last night, and we absolutely loved it.  I followed other posters' recommendations and used 2 1/2 c. of water, 2 tbsp of soy sauce, and added minced garlic to the chicken when it was almost done.  I also added a cup of onions to the chicken (when it was almost cooked fully, though not finished browning).  I used 4 tsp of oil when cooking the chicken and onions, and another tsp for the veggies.  Served it over Cal Rose rice.  This is the first time I have ever cooked an actual meal in my life, and it came out great - the recipe was easy and the meal was delicious.

Any recipe claiming to be a 'stir fry' with over 500ml of liquid has gotta be taking the mickey.  Aaaanyway, what i did was use 60ml chicken stock instead of the water. Oh and i added a roughly chopped garlic clove when i cooked the chicken as well.   And completely ignored the whole cornstarch thang. If you use little liquid, like i did, its just not neccessary.

This is now one of my families favorite "take out" at home recipes.  It is not a stir fry, but is more like Chicken and Broccoli from our favorite Chinese restaurant.  (Except mine is better!!)  To cook the chicken, I use a few dashes of sesame seed oil mixed with some olive oil.  When it is time for the veggies, I add a bit more sesame seed oil, an onion, sliced water chestnuts and canned mushroom slices along with the broccoli and carrots. I then add about a tablespoon or so of Szechuan Spicy Stir Fry Sauce and a few dashes of soy sauce.  (And maybe some red pepper flakes)   I am trying this with steak tonight, with beef bullion, so we shall see!!

I loved this recipe, I added some sliced onions.  I read the review that it was to watery, so I cut back on the liquid to 2 cups, then it was to dry.

Really nice recipe.  I did make a few additions only because we like a hotter sauce.  I added 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes and 1 Tablespoon Srirachi sauce.  Next time I may add a bit more of the Srirachi; it could have been a bit hotter.  Will definatley make again.

Not a stir-fry, too much liquid. On the other hand, it makes a yummy dinner. I used homemade chicken broth (found on this site) and it was tasty.

This is a good foundation, but awfully short on flavor. The next time I make it I'll be doubling the ginger and soy sauce.

Excellent.  I have been looking for a chicken and broccoli dish like this for a long time.  This is it.  I changed it slightly. I always add water chestnuts or bamboo shoots, carrots, 2 scallions.   I cut the liquid amounts by about 75% and I make the liquid portion in a separate pan. (Basically, I add just as much liquid is as needed to the pan with the chicken and veggies to create the desired consistency of sauce.)  Quick easy, healthy.  Thanks for posting!

3.5 - 4 stars for this recipe - 5 for my version.  

Great basic recipe for stir-fry, however less liquid is in a stir-fry so no matter what changes you make to this you must decrease the liquid.  

I made some family preference changes.  I added garlic, mushrooms and onions.  I used peanut oil instead of canola (sesame works very well too).  I used 2 1/2 cups chicken broth instead of 3 1/4 cups water and omitted the granules.  I grated the carrots instead of julienned them.  I used 2 Tbl regular soy sauce and added red pepper flakes to taste.  We had guests over that evening and there wasn't a speck of stir-fry left!  Everyone devoured it and raved about it!

5 stars for taste 3 stars for changes made. I didn't use any water for the chicken bouillion used 1/4 c of broth. I cooked the chicken 1st shredded then stir fried everything in the broth and other spices. Didn't need to thicken after everything was cooked and had didn't have carrots so used baby corn and mushrooms and broccoli.

This had a GREAT flavor, but I agree there was just to much liquid.  Good thing I'd made some fried rice to soak it up.  I also added some fresh minced garlic to the spices.

I did not put any ginger in the recipe. I used frozen broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots, but defrosted them before frying them. I added extra soy sauce and extra seasonings. Next time I make it I am going to add mushrooms, green pepper and some other Chinese type veggies. I also added 4 chicken bullion cubes, and did not put the chicken in strips, but in small pieces (easier for my son to eat) and it went farther. I cut the rice in half as well, used 2 cups instead of 4 and had tons of left over rice. Definitely a must try!

I have made this several ways, but the best so far was lowering the water to two and a half cups, and adding onions. I tried leaving out the ginger once, it was not the same. Canned carrots worked in a pinch once when mine were not very tasty. Brown rice and a little soy sauce make it perfect!

AWESOME...with a few tweaks! First, I seasoned the chicken strips with black pepper, onion powder and Accent and let it sit for 15 minutes before cooking. I also sprinkled Accent and black pepper on the broccoli. I then cooked the chicken and added 1/4 of freshly chopped onions the last 2 minutes. For non garlic fans like myself, I know we are few and far within:), this is a great option. 
I also cooked the broccoli with another 1/4 of an onion. I did cut the water down to 2 1/2 cups. After combining everything except the cornstarch, I added some ground red pepper and curry ( LOVE!!!) for spice and more flavor. As soon as I added the cornstarch, it thicken right up. In fact, I wish there had been a little more liquid so next time I think I will use 2 3/4 cups of water instead. We had it with white rice and not a drop was left...it's a keeper!!!

This is wonderful.  I used two large boneless chicken breasts, 2 1/2 c of broccoli florets.  I doubled the sauce as someone suggested, and doubled the ginger.  I added 1 T of brown sugar to the soy sauce. (Taste before adding to the chicken.)  I did have to increase the cornstarch by 2 Tbsp.  I think water chestnuts would be great also.  VERY good!

I took some other reviewers advice and added a bit of fresh garlic and some crushed red pepper, reduced broth amount to 2 cups, doubled soy sauce and still found sauce to be BLAND and tasteless!  Next time with try Martin Yans recipe on food network site. I won't be making again.  Sorry.

This is an absolute keeper.  The only changes I made were:  I did not remove the veggies from the pan.  I added 2 cups of hot chicken broth instead of the granules, then the other ingredients and put the chicken back in the pan.  I cooked it on medium heat for about 5 minutes, then added the cornstarch mixture.  I think next time I will add some water chestnuts for some crunch.  I served it on brown rice.  Excellent!

This was a great recipe when made following the other reviewers suggestion of adding minced garlic and decreasing the amount of water. The bit extra soy sauce makes a difference. 

 I lightly season ALL of my meat with a bit of Adobo & garlic, delicious with ANY recipe! I promise!

Made tonight for dinner for the first time and it came out delicious. Just like chinese food but not as greasy and salty as some dishes. Nice and light. I made a few changes. I browned chicken in garlic and onions to add a little more flavor. Also,added mushrooms as well as carrots and broccoli. I used chicken broth instead of the cube and followed the advise of other reviewers and used less liguid. I'll make it again and I might try  it with shrimp the next time. My husband loved it too.

This was pretty bland but it was easy to prepare and easy to adjust to suit ones taste.  I used a little less bouillon because I’m concerned about sodium intake, which may be the reason it was bland; therefore I’m giving this 4 stars.  I’ll make again but will add different seasonings and less water.

The "sauce" for this did not have much flavor and it was definitely too soupy, even though I reduced the water to 2 cups. I won't be making this again.

I thought this recipe was really good. The only change I made was adding some green bellpepper, it spiced it up a bit. :) and be sure to serve this with soy sauce on the side because it is a bit bland

we found this recipe bland, even with the addition of mushrooms and garlic.  Very easy to make however.

This recipe was very bland. I had to use flour as a cornstarch substitute, but I couldn't get it to thicken at all.

This was okay. I think it needed onions and more spices and flavor. It was easy enough to make for a okay dinner though.

This recipe was very good!! The family loved it! I will definitely be making it again, it was quick, easy and yummy! These are ingredients I always have on hand which makes it even better!! I definitely followed suit with everyone else and used less fluid, 2 1/2 cups water and only 2 Tbls cornstarch, this was more then enough sauce, I also added fresh garlic with the chicken, delicious!!

this was really good. I did however add garlic and dried onion to the chicken and cauliflower because we are big veggie eaters.  Overall a good quick dinner.

I tried this recipe last night and while my husband and I both enjoyed it, the flavor was nothing like we were expecting (which is the reason I'm only giving it 3 stars).  We couldn't taste the soy sauce at all.  I served this over rice and it tasted like chicken rice soup (without the broth).  Next time I will cut back on the chicken boullion and add an extra TBSP of soy sauce.

I was disappointed with this recipe. I found it flavorless, but I did like the way the broccoli turned out, so I rated it two stars instead of just one.

This was pretty tasty - though a bit soupy.  I used brown rice vermicilli with it.

I reduced the liquid as other members suggested and decided it was a bit bland. I tossed in some oyster sauce, an dhad a pretty decent brown sauce.

Quick and easy.  I made it with couscous (no time to make rice) and it was delicious with all the liquid.  Will definitely make this regularly!

Thankyou for this easy recipe! I couldn't believe how delicious it turned out. An idea for next time is to add baby corn to the mix.
