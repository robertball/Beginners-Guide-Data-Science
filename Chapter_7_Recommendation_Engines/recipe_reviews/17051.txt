This is delicious and couldn't be simpler to make! Like some others, I used salted cashews as I had a large can of those on hand. (And yes, they are MUCH more reasonably priced then Macadamia nuts.) I loved the combination of the sweet chocolate, slightly tart cranberries, and salty nuts. I will definitely make this again!

I made this bark recipe along with several others to give as Christmas gifts.  It was very easy to make and I liked the taste of the dried cranberries and macadamias in the white bark. 

After the holidays I asked my gift recipients to rate the barks from most favorite to least favorite.  This came in as the LEAST favorite.  In the future I will NOT make it again for gifts, but will make it for our family.

By the way, the bark that was everyones favorite was the Oreo Cookie bark on this site.

YUMMY!!! Not syruppy sweet, but is just right, beats all the holiday sugar, sugar, sugar.  Looks pretty on the cookie/candy trays, a hit here, made it 4 times for the holidays, everybody loved it.

This is pretty to have sitting out at a party and like the recipe author said, it is nice in gift trays/baskets.  A little bit goes a long way.

YUUMMM! And sooo easy. I used white chocolate chips and salted cashews. I wasn't sure how much 3 1/2 ounces was so I added about 1/2 cup - same as the cranberres. A few more cashews would be good. My problem now: Staying out of it until my geusts arrive tonight.

Very quick and easy.  I used wax paper instead of tinfoil with good results.

Loved this recipe, very easy. The only change I made was with the nuts. I used cashews instead, a little less expensive and worked really well. This is a keeper.

This was very good! Instead of heating on the stove I used the microwave and this worked out well. I used a little more macadamia nuts (salted).This was an easy recipe than took no time at all to make.

Very easy to make.  I followed directions
exactly; attractive and would be nice to give for holidays.  I would like to try making a variation using peppermint candy instead of the dried cranberries. 
I recommend you try it.

The tart cranberries or cherries, the slight salty crunch of the macadamia nuts & the creamy sweetness of the white chocolate are wonderful!

This was super simple and yummy... I did add more macadamia nuts, the amount stated just seemed too skimpy to me. I bet this would be good with any type of nuts, I just had a lot of macadamia already. This recipe could not have been any easier..
