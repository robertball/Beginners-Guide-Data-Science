I made the full recipe as is, but used low-fat cheese and whole wheat pasta. I do not believe this had any negative impact on taste.   I opted to split it into (2) 8x8 pans as it really makes a large portion.  One of which I baked & served that evening, and the other I assembled & then threw in my freezer for another night.   In each pan, I had room for a layer of sauce, a layer of the pasta mixture, another layer of sauce, and topped it with cheese.  But as a side note, I did not add cheese to the one I froze. When I was ready to finally bake the frozen pan, I let it thaw overnight in my fridge.  I threw it in my preheated oven (375 F) and cooked for approx 45 min (wrapped in tin foil).  I added the cheeses, and let it cook for another 15 minutes. Good taste, easy to make (and freeze for later!), and the sausage adds substance.  Will make again.

I made this recipe to feed a hungry group during a ski weekend and it was amazing!  Both the picky adults and the pickier children loved it.  I increased the amount of sausage slightly and used italian style turkey sausage.  I prepared the recipe up through step 5 and then put the tray in the fridge all day.    When we got home that night, I increased the oven temp to 375 and cooked it covered for 45 minutes and uncovered for 15.  It was perfect!

Very good basic recipe. I made modifications to suit my family's tastes. I used ground chuck vs sausage (family does not care for it) and sauteed the onion and garlic with it. Used a can of diced tomatoes to mix into the ricotta cheese, egg, etc. Because it can be a little bland, used allot more spices in the mixture, such as Italian Seasoning, parsley flakes, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, chili powder and cumin powder. Used 40 oz of Prego spaghetti sauce to keep it from drying out.I also used 16 oz of Italian shredded cheese (8 oz per layer). I sprayed the aluminum foil with Olive Oil Pam before covering (to keep the cheese from sticking) and baked it at 375 degrees for 45 minutes, then uncovered and baked an additional 20 minutes. I let it stand for another 15 minutes while my garlic bread was baking to let it set up. This was delicious!!! My son was over for dinner and wanted to take the leftovers home (a first!) but I wouldn't let him. Instead, I gave him this recipe (with my modifications, of course, lol). I've made other baked ziti recipes, but this was the best by far.

Everytime I've eaten baked ziti it's always been dry and flavourless, but this recipie is EXCELLENT! I love it!! I followed the recipe the same other than cooking the onions and garlic with the sausage since I don't like raw onions. The noodles stayed nice and soft and were sooo creamy and delicious!

I make a similar recipe, minus the ricotta. I use hot Italian sausage instead of the mild for a little kick. This is an excellent dish for a busy day, easy to put together and bake.

Very Good. I added a 1/2 lb of ground beef and mushrooms to the mixture. I also mixed mozzarella cheese in the layers and topped it off with parmesan cheese. This was very good and enjoyed by my family. Thanks for the great recipe.

GREAT! Made a few suble changes, but stayed within the perimiter of the original recipe. I added 1 lb. ground venison to the sausage (We are big meat eaters). I sauteed the onions and some fresh garlic, added 1 tsp. dried mint (the secret to REALLY GREAT sauce!), upped the salt to 1 tsp., used 4 more ounces shredded cheese and used FRESH basil. I did need to bake it 10 minutes longer than the recipe stated. This was nice and creamy, not at all dry. Just perfect! I will be making this again.

Really lovely and simple recipe.  Didn't really make any significant changes, and it turned out lovely.  Making sure the noodles are still a teeny bit undercooked is definitely key though, since they definitely continue to absorb moisture in the oven.

This recipe was super easy to make.  I used mozzarella and provolone cheese for my Italian cheese blend and it was great!  Next time I will split this recipe up into two pans and freeze one for a later date.

When I got married and moved out the house, I actually used THIS recipe instead of my mom's. Now I LOVE my mom's baked ziti...but...this beats hers. (Sorry mom.) This is now my husband's favorite thing I make. Amazing recipe.

I only change I made to this recipe was that I cooked the onion with the sausage. I will make this again, the whole family loved it and the only change I will make to it next time will be to cook the onion with the sausage. It is a very good recipe. Thank you very much.

This recipe was sooooo good! I used sausage. I cooked the sausage and then drained it and then ground it up because I don't like the sausage to be chunky. I then returned it to the pan and cooked some sauce into it while I was waiting for the pasta. I made this exactly as the recipe called except I didn't add the onion and I use a little bit more sauce than the recipe called for. This is a keeper!

I didn't have any homemade spaghetti sauce in the freezer and had to use store bought. NO brand compares to homemade, so I had to add a LOT more Italian type seasonings and Parmesan cheese -- and fresh basil helps.  I like that this recipe uses an egg to bind the mix. I did NOT mix the ricotta in with the sauce, rather, I mixed all the sauce, sausage, and pasta together, put half in the pan, did a layer of ricotta mix (lasagna style), then cheese blend, and the rest of the pasta w/sauce. Topped with cheese blend and chopped fresh basil. This will be awesome when I can make some homemade sauce! Thank you for the recipe.

This is a 3.5 star recipe for me, but only because I love Italian dishes and if it has pasta, red sauce, cheese and is baked, I like it!  Anyway, this ziti was a bit bland for my family. I made (and rated) as written with the exception that I only used 2 italian sausages (was all I had on hand) and made up the rest of the meat using ground beef.  No other substitutions.  Next time, I'll add more of the spices, a dash of chili pepper flakes for some zing, and I'll make my own "italian cheese blend" with mozz, parmesan and provolone (heavier on the latter two because the store bought one tasted like shredded mozz).  Not a fantastic recipe, but worth making again with some minor adjustments.

This is a good recipe.  This is now my go to when I don't know what else to make for dinner.  Easy to make in large quantities.  I use hot turkey sausage and I saute the onions and minced garlic with the sausage.  I also add fresh mushrooms and spinach to the sausage mixture to get some veggies in my diet.   I add more of the spices than called for, and I don't use salt.  I also use 2 jars of sauce because I don't like dry pasta.  I also top it off with a little fresh mozzarella, extra italian seasoning and then I broil for the last 2 mins or so to make the cheese nice and bubbly.  Serve with a nice green salad or green vegetables and you have yourself a great meal!

YUM-O!!  I made as directed, however replaced sausage with ground beef as we already had pork this week.  I also sauteed the garlic and onion with with the beef and simmered with half of the sauce for about 15 min (for the kids!)  Everyone gobbled it up...and I have a tough crowd these days!   Thanks

I made a lazy version of this ziti. I first mixed the pasta with a little bit of sour cream and plain yogurt since I only had a little bit of sourcream left. I then dumped everything in the pan. Ricotta, pasta sauce, italian blend shredded cheese, salt, black pepper, italian seasoning. I mixed it all up w/o an egg. I cut up italian turkey sausage distributed throughout the pan. Topped with more mozerrella cheese and baked. It was easy simple and deelish

We really liked this recipe.  I added an extra egg.  Like others, I browned the sausage, out of their casings and then added the onion and garlic to the sausage instead of the ricotta mixture.  I also seasoned the sausage a bit with salt, freshly grated pepper and oregano.  Great results all around.

I made this for friends and it was a huge hit. I also cooked the onion and garlic with the sausage, added some red pepper flakes and some diced tomatoes. I think it would have been a bit bland without these additions. Will definitely make this again.

This was very easy and delicious.  I decided to add a bit more cheese and I am sorry I did - it was way too cheesy.  I will make this again and I will follow the recipe exactly.  Thanks submitter.

This ziti is delicious!  I use spicy italian sausage, extra mozzarella cheese, fresh basil and Rao's Marinara Sauce.  I also put a  can of diced tomatoes in my riccotta cheese mixture to keep it from drying out.  I read that in one of the other reviews and it did the trick.

Thought this was a great recipe. Followed it almost exactly except I sauteed the onions with the sausage as other reviewers suggested. I divided it into 2 batches and baked one now and froze the other. Will definitely make this again. Next time I will use a bit more sauce  though. It wasn't dry at all, but I prefer more sauce in my pasta casseroles.

UPDATE: I just now got around to eating the second batch that I made up and froze (it's been about 3 months). I froze it before baking, being careful to wrap it in wax paper first, then foil and put the whole thing in a big ziplock bag to protect from freezer burn. I put the entire frozen casserole in the oven and baked according to the recipe, but added about an extra 15 minutes. It came out just perfect, except I wish I had added more sauce, which was my same complaint with the first batch. Will definately make this again.

I made this tonight for the family and they all loved it!  Served with a nice side salad.  I followed the recipe but was shy on the sauce since I read some of the other reviews.  I will definitely follow the recipe to the tee next time!  Plus we have plenty left over for tomorrow. Yay!  This will definitely be in the monthly rotation!  Thanks!

Almost exactly like my recipe. I use ground beef instead of sausage, and I use Classico sauces. I added some fresh chopped garlic to the cheese mixture along with parmasean cheese and rosemary. It was GREAT!

This came out great. My mother in law asked me for the recipe after. What I changed. I added a block of fresh spinach to it, precooked it in the microwave, drained it and added it to the cheese mixture. Also I added 1 1/2 tablespoons of red pepper flakes for a kick and a 1/4 cup of low fat sour cream for more creaminess as well as used low fat ricotta and whole wheat rigatoni. No one noticed THAT IT WAS A HEALTHIER VERSION. YUM! If you are having a dinner party and want to spend more time socializing than cooking, pre-make this a few hours before, leave it on the stove top and pop it in when you are ready, :-)

My husband said it was OK, but I did not care for this at all, and my two kids - normally great noodle eaters - just picked at it.  I made the recipe as written, but it just tasted like jarred spaghetti sauce and raw onions to me.  I much preferred another ziti recipe on this site which uses provolone in the layers.

Every beginner cook should have this simple yet very good recipe in their recipe box. My daughter and her college friends went searching AR, found this and of course, loved the results.  The kids followed the recipe but decided to take the sausage out of the casings before browning. Miss Tyler says Thank You!

Delicious! I served this at a party recently and got rave reviews. One guest told me, "I've eaten a lot of ziti in my life but this is by far the best I've ever had." I tripled the recipe so it's hard to give exact measurements on the things that I changed. I used only one large onion for my triple batch and sauteed the garlic and onion with the sausage. Used a little more ricotta than the recipe called for. Didn't use any black pepper. Lost track of how much spaghetti sauce and cheese I used -- just kept piling it on! I baked it uncovered for an hour. Cheese on top was nice and golden brown. YUM!

Yummy! My husband and kids loved it.  I did add some provolone to each layer and I added more seasonings to the mix. The cheese made it super stringy and delicious.

This is a great recipe.  As per the other reviewers' advice, I sauteed the onion and garlic and cooked it along with the sausage.  I also used hot Italian sausage to add a bit of a punch.  My boyfriend, who isn't the biggest fan of pasta, gave it two thumbs up last night.  Thanks :)

I made this recipe exactly to specifications, except i used a little more sauce - my jar was bigger and I shredded my own mozzarella. It was very good, and not dry like the last time I made ziti. I do have to say that I bakes it at 350 for 25 minutes, and then another 10 without the foil and my onions were still very crunchy. Sautee the onions first, and maybe not use a whole onion. Otherwise, really good. I used the Bertolli Tomato and Basil sauce!

I didn't like the ricotta mixed in with everything.  Think I would prefer it as a layer.  I even used whole milk ricotta and I still found the final product gritty.

The best Baked Ziti recipe I've tried! Only thing I did differently was sautee the onion and garlic in the pan with the sausage after it was cooked. I also added a can of diced tomatoes w/ the meat meat mixture. I just like chunks of tomatoes, and I was afraid it may be too dry. Will definitely make this again!

This is really good. I would only make one change. The onions really need to be browned with the sausage. After the ziti was all baked the onions where still very crunchy & it just didnt taste right. Other then that this is very tasty.

This is a great base recipe, but a little bland.  Next time I would add spinach or green peppers and some extra seasonings.

THis was really good. It is so much better than the boring Ziti I have been used too. I didn't do the sausage part because I didn't have any pulled out, but it was still good!

This was really good, even with having to get a bit creative since I had no ricotta.  I used a mixture of cottage cheese, cream cheese and plain fage.  It worked out great and definately made it creamier.  I used whole wheat pasta, I didn't like the texture of that so next time I'll use smart taste or barilla plus.  I added green peppers. needs mushrooms too or really any veggies.  I used italian chicken sausage.  It makes a lot, so split in 2 next time.

Not too bad. I made a couple of adjustments:
1. I used hot italian sausages
2. I folded in some baby spinach for fiber and color
3. I also put in some Tony Chachere's seasoning for flavor.
Delicious.

Wow, this was the bomb!  We just finished our dinner of leftovers and it was even better today than it was fresh out of the oven yesterday!  I changed one thing...went with spicy italian sausage over the mild and it had just the right heat for our family!  Thank you Ashley for the fabulous recipe!

My kids LOVED this recipe!! My husband and I weren't so crazy about the texture. I made several changes. I used turkey italian sausage and whole wheat pasta. I also sauteed the onion and garlic with the meat. And last, I only had mozzarella cheese on hand, so I used that and added some fresh grated parmesan. We will try this again, without the ricotta! Thanks for the recipe. It's not often that I find something that all FIVE of my kids will eat!!

Really good recipe!  Used lowfat ricotta cheese and rinsed the Italian sausage to try to remove some fat.  Also used hot Italian sausage to give it a little kick!

I followed this recipe pretty much to a "T". The only change I made was to cook the onion with the Italian sausage cause hubby doesn't like un-cooked onions. Hubby has actually eaten left-overs which is almost unheard of in this house.

A whole onion is to much for this recipe. the onion taste is overpowering. If you do follow this recipe, only use half the onion.

You might want to cook the onion and garlic with the sausage. Unless you like crunchy uncooked onions. Otherwise very good.

This was wonderful... we used Bertolli sauce with sausage in addition to the Sweet Italian sausage. Great !  If you follow the recipe it is not soupy at all and the seasonings blend so beautifully. A Family Favorite.  Thanks, allrecipes.com

Great recipe. I used the whole 2 jars of spaghetti sauce. I also sauteed the sausage with the onions and garlic. Did not turn out dry at all like many ziti recipes I've sampled. This will be my go-to ziti recipe from now on. Makes a lot of food. Great for inviting guests over!

I made this as written except for sautéing the onions, garlic with the meat.  My only issue was that mixing the pasta with ricotta first gave a grainy consistency to the pasta even though it was thoroughly heated.  Next time, I will mix the ricotta into the meat first, and probably double the Italian cheese too.  I make something similar with mostly ground turkey, so you could do that too.

made per directions.  just awful.  the onions remain raw and are the predominant flavor.  soupy, mushy ziti.  sausage isn't noticeable.  nearly tasteless.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY on this.

Great, easy crowd pleaser.  I followed the recipe the first time, substituting jarred sauce for homemade and it was great.  My husband asked for more sausage the next time I made it... This last time, I doubled the ground sausage and used 1.75 jars of sauce (San Marzano jarred sauce - no sugar or preservatives)... again, it was excellent.

I made this last night. My husband said it was "ok". I thought it had great flavor but was kind of dry. I used hot Italian sausage and swapped the Classico sauce for Prego beause I don't care for Classico sauce. I also didn't put the amount of onions in that was called for, my husband doesn't care for onions.I will make it again but will increase the amount of sauce I use.

I don't cook much in my household. But when I do this is the meal that everyone wants! I usually include a garden salad, garlic bread and a nice Merlot such as Barefoot Wine when I make this dish.

This was a great recipe and turned out YUMMY! It was my first time doing baked ziti and I brought it to a potluck. I received lots of compliments...even left some in a tupperware for someone to have lunch the next day (per request)! Next time, I'll try it with a little extra spice! Thanks!

Very good ziti recipe. Not the least bit dry, and I only had 1 jar of sauce on hand and just made it work. I also only had a white onion. I sauteed it in the pan that I cooked the sausage in (after the sausage was done and set aside to drain). I think that added a little more flavor, but otherwise I followed the recipe as written. Great job, Ashley!

I made this dish for the first time for a family gathering and I have received great reviews! This was an easy dish to make and it tasted awesome. I used spicy Italian sausage instead which gave it a slight kick. I will definitely make this dish again and will add chopped spinach to give it some color. Great recipe!!!

Very very good.  Instead of ricotta cheese i used cottage cheese to make it a bit healthier and creamier. I also sauteed the onion before adding it to the mixture since I'm not a big raw onion fan.

This was absolutely delicious, So very filling! I served this with a nice crisp iceberg salad.  I did do a couple things different with the suggestions from others I added a little more spaghetti sauce and cooked the onion with the sausage. I definitely used more mozzarella and only one teaspoon of garlic, this was awesome!  Oh, cooking time:  350 for 45 min, covered 30 min, last 15 min take cover off, I actually had to broil for a few min to get my cheese to fully melt.

I think this was very tasty.  I doubled the recipe and it still came out good.  It could use some more spices if you like it that way, especially if you use plan pasta sauce.  My one suggestion to the author:  Tell us in what form the sausage should be before we cook it!  I cooked Johnsonville mild Italian Sausage links in their casings, but because I only browned them they were not cooked through and cutting them up was a mess.  Next time I would either cut them first and then brown them or use bulk sausage without the casing.

I changed the recipe just a little to meet our tastes.  I used 2 bags mixed shredded cheese instead of the ricotta.  I also used half hamburger and half pork sausage.  It was so delicious!!

I made this for my husband, who loves pasta. It was a hit! I will definitely make it again, but next time I think I'll try to freeze half of it because it makes way too much for the two of us.

This is a keeper. So easy and delicious. My 4 year old gobbled it up. I didn't layer it because I ran out of room in my dish. So I froze the other half. Perfect!

I'm making this now and I came back to the recipe to double check the oven temp. I just realized that I added a LOT more ricotta than is called for.. I bought a 1lb15 oz package instead of the 15oz package. It looks good though so I'll update when it's finished.. **update** this was very good.. since i accidentally doubled the cheese it was a little bland, so i added the other half jar of sauce and some red pepper flake.. talk about good! very saucy, but we like that in our house.. at least we do now haha

delicious! I did make a few changes; bake in oven at 375 instead of 350 to get center hot, 45 min covered and 15 min. uncovered as it bakes. dice sausage for even distribution, (origianl recipe does not state what size sausage pieces should be.) Also, 2 jars of spaghetti sauce are more appropriate due to the volume of this hearty dish!

I followed this recipe exactly, and I was honestly disappointed.  First question: why weren't the onions sauted with the sausage? The onions were crunchy! Also, I really like more sausage so, I'd add a lot more.

This was OK.  I used spicy sausage and it still wasn't that flavorful (and I am sensitive to spices.)  It made way too much and after the first helping, I didn't really want any of the leftovers.

Totally delicious, but my kids wouldn't eat it because they could tell there were onions in it.  I think the onions and garlic should have been cooked in with the sausage instead of mixed in the cheese mixture.

His momma is 100% Italian from the old country and although this dish was easy, it is authentic especially if you use homemade sauce but I used quality bottled tomato and basil! I melted a stick of butter in the pasta! Gave it a richness! A serious keeper! I also made an extra batch for a friend who lost a loved one and had family in from out of town! Glad I came across the recipe today!

Family favorite.  The only change I made is that I make my own sauce.  We are a family of 2, so this makes plenty to share with elderly family and neighbors.   Everyone I have served it to loves it.  I call it cheaters lasagna, as it is easier to put together.

Fantastic! Only changes I made to the original recipe were  to add more garlic and sauté the onions and garlic with the sausage (after I drained the sausage). I also added some red pepper flakes and doubled the shredded cheese. Used 40 ounce jar of sauce-was perfect.

I followed the recipe word for word, but it would have tasted better with half the amount of onion. The onions and garlic should have been sauteed with the meat. Maybe it was common sense to make those modifications along the way but like I said I wanted to follow the exact instructions. What a waste of time and money, all I can taste is onion.

I have made this recipe at least ten times now and it is great. I use gluten free Penne pasta with no other modifications. For the left overs, I add a tablespoon or so of sauce to bring back the moisture.

We didn't care for this recipe. 
I found the raw onions to be a bit odd and should have known better to pre cook them. The raw onion flavour took over the entire dish and I couldn't taste anything else. 
The ricotta cheese also just didn't seem to work, you have a creamy texture with no flavour since ricotta is very mild it took on the onion and everything else.

Great recipe!! Made it for my boyfriend and daughter who are both picky eaters!! They went back for thirds!! Only change they suggested was to use hot sausage instead of mild next time... I didn't have ziti so I used rigatoni. They loved it. Think you can use whatever pasta you have on hand or whatever your preference is

This was great except for the onions....leaving them raw left a weird crunch that I didn't really care for. Next time I will cook them in with the sausage.

I'm very picky about ziti and this one is great! The texture is just right. It isn't runny or dry and is exactly the texture I prefer. If I had to modify anything I would use about half of the large onion and add a bit more garlic just because I love a stronger garlic taste.  This is a great go-to meal during the week.

Great flavor! Made this on vacation and gobbled up all the leftovers. I omitted the basil just because I didn't have any, it still turned out great

Homemade sauce made this much better than the first time I made it. I followed the recipe exactly the first time and it was bland. My sauce is much better so tried it again with this and used both ground beef and sausage this time and it was decent. I covered the top with fresh mozzarella and served with salad and garlic bread.

I had been craving baked ziti for a little while now and decided to check out all recipes for the steps and ingredients. It was an easy meal to make and very delicious... My prep time was less than 30 minutes and I used all the ingredients, I added more ricotta (because I love ricotta lol). My family also enjoyed the meal as well. I will definitely make this meal again!

Great recipe!  very flavorful!  Brought it to a meeting so just mixed it all together in the pot.  I left out the cheese and egg and it still tasted wonderful!  Great for a crowd.

Sooo good! I will definitely be making this again. Even my toddler ate it. I followed the recipe exactly. For some reason it took mine way longer to cook than the recipe stated - probably more than an hour. Before that the onions were completely raw, and it was so cool I was worried the egg would still be raw as well. But after doubling the time it was excellent.

I would definitely sauté the onions prior to mixing into the dish. We ended up eating raw onions in each bite. It had a little too much sauce for me but my husband liked it.

I thawed and baked the casserole for dinner tonight after freezing it for 2 weeks. I always follow a recipe exactly when I make it the first time so didn't make any adjustments. The family found the texture mushy and the flavour too bland for our liking. Am looking for make-ahead casseroles but don't think I will try this again.

I used 4oz. of cream cheese instead of the Ricotta...my husband and I are not fans of stinky cheese. I also used a Sweet Peppers sauce and cheddar and mozzarella cheese to layer. I put the basil in the mix and added sage to the (hot) sausage as it cooked. It was a hit!

I made the recipe pretty much as is, with whole grain pasta and low-fat mozzerella cheese.  Added turkey pepperoni to the recipe and eliminated the onions and minced garlic to make it more kid-friendly for my family.  This did create a huge portion size so in hindsight I may have added an extra egg to hold it all together.  This was very easy and delicious!

I'm giving this a neutral because I hated it and my boyfriend loved it. Followed the recipe as is but found it really bland. On the flip side...the boyfriend loved it and asked that I make it again...I won't but he asked anyway.

This was excellent, family loved it!  I followed other reviewers and cooked the onion and garlic, removed from pan and then browned the sausage.  I did not have ricotta and honestly am not a fan of the gritty texture, so I took about a cup or so of cottage cheese and blended it, added the egg and spices and blended again.  Made for a nice and creamy dish.  Will make this again and next time try with turkey sausage and some lower fat cheeses.  I always use the Dreamfield pasta which is a lower carb pasta, and the family has no idea.

Rave reviews from the whole gang!  I used Alla Vodka Sauce and I added Mushrooms.  I also used Mozarella, Asiago and Cheddar cheese instead of typical italian blends.  I used Fresh Basil.

Made few changes: didn't have sausage so used pepperoni, used sharp cheddar cheese and cottage cheese.  These changes were yummy and the fam liked it.

This was really good.  I added parmesan cheese to the ricotta mixture. I also made extra sauce to pour over  the ziti when serving.  I added ground beef, ground  sausage, and onions to the sauce.

Very good baked ziti, I usually don't follow a recipe to make this dish, but decided to this time. I used an entire 32 ounce container of ricotta, because for us, the 15 ounce was just not enough. I added more sauce to the ziti mix, and also added more while layering. I felt the seasonings were fine, and the addition of the onion is really good also. Thanks for sharing :)

This was very good and moist the only thing I will change the next time around is using only half an onion and I would also recommend cooking the onion and garlic with the sausage.

Hi All, I used this recipe with a little tweeking of my own. I also, as some others, added a bit more spices to the ricotta mixture along with an extra egg for a bit more firmness.  Additionally, I changed the type of pasta to shells. I love the little pop of sauce and cheese you get when you bite into eat little shell. My Grandma's cousins in Monte Malone Italy served a dish so very similiar to this when we went to visit and I have been on the endless search to replicate thier dish. This one does comes pretty close.  The sausage they used, well, we can't find it here at all. My Great Grandfather had an Italian provisions store Martoccia's in Orange, NJ and he had the best Italian sausage around for over 60 years and our Italian cousins came pretty close in tatse and fond memories! All in all this recipe is easy, quick and with some personal touches just as good as Grannys'!!  Bon Appetit!

Well done.  I followed as written and enjoyed the Zita all week.  I used turkey Italian sausage to pretend it was healthy.  Couldn't tell the difference! I'm keeping this recipe!

REALLY REALLY GOOD. use this for baked ziti from now on.  it's not dry the second day at all.  moist and creamy, yummy.  i left out the onion, added garlic to the sausage after it was cooked and sprinkled the basil in the ricotta, and a little on top at the end.  everyone loved it...used premio sw. it. 1 lb just like it says. i took it out of the casings and crumbled it up. better this way. smaller pieces.

Delicious! Rich but in a good, want seconds way. Didn't look very "bubbly" in the oven, but had plenty of sauce when spooning it out. My husband and 13 year old loved this. I used Trader Joe's Quattro Fromaggio (Italian shredded cheeses) and Trader Joe's sweet Italian sausage-squeezed out of casings. My husband said it might be good next time to try a spicy sausage. Definitely a keeper!

Great recipe!  I only had one jar of spaghetti sauce so I used a can of diced tomatoes as the last (top) layer right before the cheese.  It was delicious and my husband and kids loved it.  I'll continue to use the can of diced tomatoes instead of an additional 1/2 jar of spaghetti sauce.

Nice, easy, quick dinner.  I did as others and sauteed the onions and garlic with the sausage.  I don't think I'd make this for company, but it made a great easy dinner for my husband and me.  If I make it again, I'll probably use more cheese or decrease the amount of pasta.

Overall a good dish.  It was a bit spicy for my taste.  If I make this again I would use a small to medium onion and probably ground beef, turkey, or pork that is not already seasoned.  I really like cheesy dishes, so I might add some extra mozzarella and maybe even a bit more ricotta.     A nice meal!

Delicious, moist comfort food. Adding chopped spinach or thinly sliced zucchini makes a more complex dish, which is also more healthy.  Sauteing the onion with the sausage is preferred, and leaving the ricotta mix sauce-less (white) gives better color. I also add mozzarella to the ricotta mix.

Great recipe! I made it last night exactly following the instructions. I have to agree with the others that its best to saute the onions with the sausage so it gets rid of the raw onion taste but even if you don't they work fine for the recipe. So much flavor, I was not disappointed and neither will you be.

This is an easy-to-prepare, tasty recipe, and I will definitely make it again with two changes.  First, I will saute the onion with the sausage so it will cook longer and have a sweeter taste.  Secondly, I will bake this twice as long.  After the 20 minutes covered and 15 more for the cheese to melt on the top, the ziti was NOT hot.  I ended up putting individual servings in the microwave for a quick fix.

Great base recipe. I always spice up a bit as my boyfriend and I like more veggies and spices. Browned half 93% lean ground beef and half spicy sausage added onion and 1 red bell pepper, fresh crushed garlic, some oregano, white pepper, basil and red pepper while cooking. drained and put back on stove for 5 min and added diced mushrooms. Followed the rest of the recipe with 2 layers of sauce, noodle mix and cheese. My boyfriend loves pepperoni so added a layer on top layer of sauce under the cheese. Made 2 pans and froze one. My boyfriend licked his plate!

I prepared this dish for a potluck and it was the HIT!!!  I followed instructions except I added mushrooms and omitted onions. When I make it again I will add more sauce as I used parmesan and found it a bit dry for my taste, yet everyone else loved the less sauce and more cheese.  Will definitely make this dish again.  Thanks!!

This is just like the lasagna my mother and grandmother made. We are Sicilian. My grandparents came right from Sicily. 

I put my own sauce plus 1 jar RAOS marinara. Added more sausage lots of onion,garlic and cooked it longer.... about 45 min at 350. afraid of egg not cooking and it came out of this world.

Agree with others that the onions need to be cooked with the sausage first.  They are basically raw.  Also it took way longer than 20 minutes to really heat through all the way (closer to an hour).

Used Italian Chicken sausage. I sautéed the onion and garlic a little bit to soften first because my daughter freaks out if she finds an onion and I wasn't sure that a 1/2 hour in the oven would be enough to soften onions into obscurity! Delicious!

I sautéed the onions before mixing them in. Also, I didn't use garlic but used Emril's roasted garlic sauce in jars. Delicious.

I didn't have onions, so I threw in some onion powder to compensate. Recipe was still delicious.  My ultra picky eater fiance loved it!

It was rather bland- I would increase the spices and doctor the tomato sauce- this is an easy dish to improve and be creative to up the flavor.

This recipe would’ve been delicious, if the taste of raw onions wasn’t so strong....next time I make it, I’m gonna mix them in with the sausage so they’re actually cooked in the finished product.

To move a little faster, I used a onion flavored  pasta sauce.  I also used a little more than one jar of pasta sauce - one jar just seemed a little light.

Amazing!!! This recipe makes A LOT but that's fine with me because I love leftovers (Nuke dinner in the microwave after a long day after work? Sold!) And my boyfriend who is 6'2" 220lbs eats like a baby elephant, so this is enough to feed us for half of the work week. The only changes I made was 1/2 jar more sauce because my boyfriend likes his pasta saucy and I used 3 tsp of italian seasoning instead of the basil and oregano (because I'm lazy and adding one spice instead of 2 was easier). Also I sauteed the onion with the sausage so it was soft and tender. But my boyfriend who is picky about pastas loved this!

I have used the recipe a few times now. My family loves it! My husband asks me to make it every couple of weeks. I add a pound of hamburger. It's almost like eating my grandma's baked ziti. She passed 8 years ago, so this brings back fond memories of my childhood!

Just not a good recipe as written, the onion needs to be cooked and the sauce to be heated with the sausage,  onion, garlic and  seasoning . Twenty minutes is way to short of a time. It was way to watery and tasted like uncooked sauce and raw onion and garlic...  I thought it would be a good quick dinner but I can see that my old prep methods were not a waste of time at all. Will not make again.

I made recipe exactly as  written, and it was only so-so. There was too much pasta in comparison to sausage and too bland for my family. We don’t like spicy food, so for us to say it’s too bland is saying something.  Plus it was way too much for a 9x13 pan, so we used a larger rectangular shaped pan.

I get compliments on this recipe every time I make it! Unfortunately, my boss /close friend's brother passed away suddenly and all I could think to do was make her and her daughter food. It put a smile on their faces and requested I triple it for when the whole family gets there. A little comfort goes a long way in times of tragedy.

Thank you for posting this recipe. For us the crunchy onions weren’t appealing, thought hot italian sausage would help and more cheese on the top.

This was a great and simple recipe! Super easy to follow. If you’re at high altitude, I would suggest bumping up the heat to at least 375F for 30 minutes. I ended up going up 400F for about 15 minutes after instructed cook time because it wasn’t cooked all the way through (barely hit 100F internally)—gotta cook that egg thoroughly! Outside of the temperature adjustment, the meal tasted awesome and was well liked by my picky husband and six year old. I used Mazzetta basil and garlic marinara sauce to kick up the garlic flavor and I’ll do it again in the future!

Thoroughly enjoy.  The proportion is excellent. For the homesteaders out there. Don't be afraid to use goat cheese instead of ricotta. It works great.  And of coarse fresh is ALWAYS better.  If you have fresh Italian herbs go nuts!    I don't do canned sauce.    home made Italian sauce is delish.   I made it twice.

My wife and I really enjoyed this.  It was simple to put together and tasted great, even reheated the next day.  We used freshly shredded mozzarella and parmesan cheese in place of the "shredded Italian cheese blend".

Made this twice, and am sharing if it helps anyone.  The second time I made this I used the full pound of ziti, with extra sausage (1.5x the recipe), mozzarella (1.5x), and sauce (extra cup), because that is what I did the first time - and LOVED it.   Sauteed the onion separately.   Made it the day ahead and refrigerated it.  Cooked at at 375 for 45 minutes covered with foil, 15 mins uncovered.  I think extending the cooking time 5-10 minutes, and allowing it to 'rest' for 5 minutes before serving would have done the trick.  It was an item at a summer BBQ and DH brought in the burgers and dogs .... 
Apart from cooking time, I also wanted to let folks know the first time I made this I used 12 oz. ziti, sauce etc., in the same proportions, but the whole 15 oz. container of ricotta.  That proportion of ricotta to other ingredients was the key - it added a creamy quality that was missing the second time.  
Bottom line - I will totally make again, cook longer, and up the proportion of ricotta.

Easy, cheap, filling comfort food. This isnt gourmet but its delicious and makes a ton. Plan on making a few trays and freezing them before the next baby comes - one of these puppies will feed a hungry family for at least two days. Thank you for sharing!

Should have read the reviews and SAUTÉED the onions. If you follow it exact and mix them raw with the cheese mixture they don’t cook. So gross.

I followed this recipe exactly but used my own homemade sauce and it was really good!  This is my go-to for Baked Ziti.

Lots of great flavor! I used hot Italian sausage combined with mild sausage and I wouldn't change it....otherwise, it may be slightly bland.

Instead of the ziti I ended up using rotini pasta and instead of the Italian sausage I used spinach feta chicken sausage which gave it a different flavor ! Will definitely make this again

The receipt made too much and there was not enough sauce. I added additional sauce and split it in half. I froze half and made the othe half but it was good.

This was definitely a hit...even with my young picky eater!!
I did add more shredded cheese, both shredded mozzarella and shredded parmesan. I also used a little less sauce and omitted the onion. I used 4 cloves of fresh garlic that I skinned and minced just before adding to the mixture. I used a bit more sausage, sweet Italian, that I removed from the casings before cooking.
I think I will add a little more sauce or crushed tomatoes the next time I make it....which I will definitely be doing soon!! ??

This was excellent. A big hit with my family. The only thing I did was add red peppers and mushrooms. One thing I will do differently next time is to cook the onions in a pan to soften them up a bit before adding to the mix. Just found some who didn't like the strong raw onion taste as much.  I will definitely make it again!

FYI.... I improvised with what I had on hand. I used 1/2 large red onion instead of yellow onion, 2 large tsp Italian seasoning instead of Oregano, mozzarella cheese and parmesan cheese instead of Italian cheese. I  used 2 whole jars of spaghetti sauce instead of 1 1/2 jars. I mixed in 2 tbsp. of fresh basil with the pasta mixture. I used 3 large tsp minced garlic instead of 2 tsp.  I added NO salt.  I  didn't add the last topping of cheese until I took the foil off. I cooked it 35 minutes first, took foil off, then added last layer of cheese, then cooked 10 more minutes uncovered. It was amazing!! 

2 days later: Next time precook the onions with the sausage . It was too crunchy .

I NEVER write reviews and I’ve DEFINITELY never written one here. I’ve used a ton of recipes from this site but this recipe deserved the rating and review. The only things I changed were the following:  sauteed 1/4 of a small yellow onion in the skillet the sausage was cooked in (to keep the flavor & because not everyone likes onions),  used 3 tsp of salt and a 1/2 tsp of garlic powder (because I was out of minced).  I LOVED it!  Thanks for sharing this gem.

Excellent base recipe for baked ziti with sausage. My husband said I did a good job with dinner and that means it was really good because usually he'll say something was "pretty good". Of course, I customized it by sauteing whatever veggies we had in the fridge- onions, carrots, peppers-and added that to the sauce. Also added in fresh basil and oregano and some Italian seasoning with sage. Delicious!

Definitely a family  favorite in our home!! After making it per the recipe once I made a few changes. I use half Italian sausage and half hamburger (sausage gives me heartburn  so I have to watch how much I eat).  I cook the garlic and onion with the meat. I also doctor the spaghetti sauce to our preference (pinch of sugar, garlic salt, Italian seasoning , onion powder and a little Parmesan cheese). Everyone looks forward to baked ziti night ??

Used 1/2lb 93/7 ground beef + 16oz mild italian ground sausage. 2 cans of Hunts garlic & olive oil sauce. 16oz of shredded mozzerella, and 15oz of ricotta.  This was much more saucey than ziti I have made in the past, which we like.

Instead of using prepared sauce I always make my own using crushed and whole tomatoes and I saute the onion, garlic and red sweet pepper and put into the sauce. I also prefer the hot Italian sausage. My wife loves this so I make it regularly.

Everything was wrong with this recipe for my family.  I think it had to do with the type of sauce we used.  I usually do not have an issue with sauces bought from the store, but this particular brand, Kroger, was an EPIC fail.  My family was not happy.  They politely ate their no thank you helpings and then had cereal for dinner!

Great recipe but I believe it needs a little more cheese including some provolone and just a little parmesan to give it a little bit of a bite.

The first time we made this recipe, we made it exactly as written. That accounts for the two star review. The onions must be cooked before adding them to the ziti, or the whole dish is ruined. the onions never cooked and absolutely ruined the dish. That said, the next time we made it we sauteed the onions before adding and it was absolutely wonderful.

This is a great recipe.  However, I did make some changes.  I used sweet Italian sausage and sautéed the onion with it, throwing in the garlic when the meat was just about browned.   I did add about half cup of heavy cream in the ricotta mixture and doubled the amount of shredded cheese and pasta sauce.  I forgot to add the salt and pepper, but it really did not  need either one (I'm sure the extra cheese and basil garlic sauce had enough of each).  This came out perfect.  I will say, we are meat lovers, so next time I will probably add at least another half pound of sausage.  Oh, and this makes a HUGE pan.  Great for a gathering...we probably should have froze half but we were hungry and thought we would finish most of it on day one. The two of us.  Didn't happen!

Very good recipe, I cooked the onions and garlic with the meat and it was better than eating the onions raw the first time around I made this dish, very good quick and easy to make.

It’s not bad. I would just recommend to sauté the onions first. I was initially going to do this but wanted to follow the directions exactly. The onions are too crunchy and potent. Other then that it’s pretty good

This is wonderful when you make it, but it does not freeze well at all.  I also added extra Ricotta and it was a mistake.  I always add extra cheese but found out not to do it with ricotta...too gritty.

Made this tonight and loved it!  The only thing I did differently, but would not make a big difference, was that I used penne rigate instead of ziti because that is what I had already.  I was  going to make lasagna, but  was feeling too lazy to deal with the lasagna noodles so I whipped this up and I was not disappointed!  Am looking forward to having leftovers tomorrow.

Onion was not cooked at all. The recipe says to combine the onion with the ricotta, egg and other spices and combine then with the sausage and noodles. I would highly recommend pre-cooking the onion with the sausage or perhaps by itself. My dish came out with under cooked onion. I re wrapped the dish back in aluminum foil and put back in the oven for another 30 minutes. Only at that time was the onion edible.

I doctored the spaghetti sauce by adding the seasoning to it, minced garlic, diced onion, and diced pepper. I browned sausage, ground beef, and cooked in sauce for a couple hours. In the ricotta cheese mixture I used mozzarella instead of an Italian blend. Also, I did a third of cup of Parmesan Cheese. I reserved 1/3 of the sauce so people could put more sauce on ziti. I made this for a group of people and the one thing they said was they like cheesy. It's the lazy man lasagna.

I’ve made this recipe countless times and it is always so good!  It also freezes really well as I made several when I was preparing for our new baby!  A few minor changes - I leave out the onions and opt for onion powder instead, and rather than do the layers I just mix everything together and top with the cheese.  So good!!!

Very good hearty winter comfort food. I would recommend sauteing  the onions for a few minutes (5 or so) with the sausage, otherwise, they don't get cooked through.

Go to recipe for Baked Ziti. I halved the recipe and add extra cheese using provolone, mozzarella and shredded parm. Also extra sauce helps since it does soak up some.

I didn't care for it.  It didn't have a lot of flavor or enough cheeses.  I probably will use a different recipe next time.

This was a hit at our house.  The end product was creamy and very tasty.  One enhancement I made was to add pepperoni in addition to the sausage.

This recipes makes a huge portion.  my 9x13 pan was filled to the brim. Nice basic baked pasta recipe. Doubled the amount of meat. Did not have fresh onion, so used dried onion flakes.  Will make again, but probably make 1/2 portion.

This was a huge success!  I was having my sister over for dinner with my husband, 1 yr. old son and 4 yr. old daughter (going on 34!) and everyone was going back for more, but I still had plenty of leftovers, because it was very filling. I also made salad and garlic bread to complete the meal.  I made a few tweeks...combo of spicy and sweet Italian sausage, added fontina for more creaminess in the cheese and decreased the recommended amount of ricotta, simply because my palate doesn't appreciate ricotta as much as mozz, parm or other saltier cheeses, but completely a preference call.  Regardless, FANTASTIC dish. You won't dissapoint.

Not bad. I didn’t have Ziti so used some penne and medium shells. I cooked the onions and garlic, and half a green pepper with the sausage. Also added a layer of baby spinach. Added 1/3 cup of the pasta cooking water to the mixture as well. These additions gave the dish a bit of texture. Topped with the Italian cheese blend, parsley and red pepper flakes.

Excellent! I took other reviewers’ suggestions and sautéed the onion with ground Italian turkey (instead of sausage). I love basil but didn’t use it this time and the recipe was great without it. Also, I froze the casserole, thawed overnight and then cooked at 375 for a hour (last 15 uncovered). Perfect for taking a meal to someone in need.

I made this and followed the recipe exactly.  Upon serving it, it was lukewarm in the middle, and the onions were still raw.  Completely dissatisfied with this recipe. It would have been good had the recipe allotted for more time in the oven.  What a waste of time and effort.

NEVER EVER  add raw onions to casserole and expect them to cook in the oven. Won't cook in a 350 degree oven for 30 minute total.  I always follow the recipe the first time making but in this case I'll make it my last time. Sorry

If I do this agin, I will saute the onions in a little olive oil. Portion is huge. we are a family of 2, so I cut the recipe in half, then baked it in 2 small baking dishes, & we ate only ½ of one of them. Lots of future meals in the freezer.

Halved the recipe in my 8.5 x 11 but not the sausage, and used 1 26 oz jar sauce, and an 8 oz bag of italian cheese mix.  Next time try with hot sausage.  Made it the day before and covered with foil sprayed with pam- took out of the fridge and baked 375 for 40 minutes covered, then 10-15 with the foil off

Love this dish! Easy to make and absolutely delicious. Like many other reviewers, I toss the onions and garlic in with my hot Italian sausage so they soften up. It should be noted that overall flavors are dependent on your ingredients here, especially the sauce. Use a sauce that you like, whether it's homemade or a jar. You should like the sauce by itself. The onions, garlic and sausage obviously add flavor too, but start with a great tasting sauce!

I love this recipes just the way it is. I used Ragu's Sauted onion and garlic sauce, plus two ounces of another sauce in the fridge.  Delicious, love the sausage instead of using ground sirloin.

This turned out great.  I made it for a family party.  It fed 7 people easily.  The only changes I made were cooking the onions and garlic with the sausage, adding some fresh basil to the ricotta mixture and using mozzarella slices and grated parm. on top.  It took 15 minutes uncovered for the mozzarella to melt.  It turned out really moist but not soupy.  Very good.  I will definitely make this again.  Several people went back for seconds and even thirds.  Winner!

I cut the recipe in half, using penne pasta because that's what I had. I did add a bit more Mozzarella cheese than called for and used hot Italian sausage. It will be a pasta dish that I will make frequently.

I used my homemade marinara.  I added grated Pecorino Romano cheese to the ricotta and egg mixture.  I used microwave frozen spinach which I squeezed dry before adding.  Makes a large amount-I froze half. I would definitely make this again.

I made this with Johnsonville sweet Italian sausage. Used Ragu chunky Sautéed onion and garlic pasta sauce for added flavor. This is my go to recipe for company or to take to a party. Be sure to use Ricotta cheese...cottage cheese will not give it the same creamy flavor!

This was my first time making baked ziti and this recipe worked out great. Like someone else said, I would just use half an onion so it doesn't overpower the dish, but otherwise it was a great meal!

This was a major hit at my house. I made a few changes though. I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta (texture thing for me), omitted the onion entirely since I don't like them, used 2 lbs of spicy Italian sausage because in our house, you can't ever just use 1 lb of spicy Italian sausage, and I used 2 jars of sauce because I didn't want know what to do with the other 1/2 jar and didn't want to deal with it. =P 

My boyfriend and I are fighting over who gets leftovers for work and how much. I'm VERY excited to eat this tomorrow for lunch. If it was this good tonight, I know it will be even better tomorrow! 

Next time I'll use more cheese though. We love cheese. Lol.

really liked this recipe the only thing I did different was I cooked the onions with the ground sausage and added the garlic the last few minutes just until I could smell the garlic then I drained other than that I followed everything else it was a hit with my family def going to make it again :)

I made the recipe except I browned my onions and garlic with my Italian ground meat instead of stirring them in raw for the pastas/ cheese mixture. It helps the texture in my opinion and it flows better as a whole dish.

This was super quick and easy to make. Made a few change: I used whole grain pasta, a white onion, fresh basil, mozzarella and parasian cheeses. I cooked covered for 15 mins then uncovered for 12. This is perfect for meal planning and came out to 1 1/4 cups per container with 9 containers.

It was a base for no meat. I used three potabella mushrooms. Cottage cheese in still of ricotta and if I had spinach in the house I would of added that too. It was so good.

I used a 32 oz jar of sauce ( due to some "soupy" reviews),  cooked the onions with the sausage, minced garlic and 1 sweet pepper  (for extra vegetables) and used part skim mozzarella (didn't realize the recipe called for Italian blend.) I increased the sausage to 1.5 lbs. I also included the basil and sprinkled with parm-reg cheese before baking.   I made ahead of time,  divided into 2 casserole dishes and gave 1 away for a meal train.  Kept in refrigerator all day, then baked for 50 minutes covered,  10 minutes uncovered.  Very good.  Would make again.

Great recipe!  I made a few changes after reading some reviews; I sautéed the onions and garlic with the sausage; increased the sausage to 1 1/2 lbs and added some grated Parmesan (2 oz) to the ricotta mixture and on the top before cooking. I increased both the cheese (12oz of 5 cheese Italian blend) and 1 3/4 jars pasta sauce (spicy tomato and basil) as a result and used fresh basil on the top before cooking. It was a hit!

Very flavorful dish. I followed the main recipe but I added 1 lb ground beef to the sausage and cooked the onions and garlic with it. I also added adfitional cheese to the ricotta mix and used fresh chopped basil instead of dry. This was a hit with the crowd I served it to.

I've tried other ziti recipes from this site. This is our favorite. I split this between two 8x8" pans, putting one in the freezer without the cheese on top. Looking forward to pulling it out at a later date and determining how well it does after being frozen.

I added a can of diced tomatoes along with the jar of sauce and added hamburger along with the sausage.  I would have liked a little more sauce.  It makes a massive amount, my 9X13 was almost over flowing. I'll divide into 2 pans next time and freeze one.

Delicious! Used 1.25 pounds of spicy Italian sausage because that's how much comes in the pack. I cooked the onions with the meat.  Everybody had seconds!

I made it according to the recipe except that I used Hot Italian Sausage.  I would never make it again.  The sauce was like Campells Tomato Soup.  The onions were raw.  Our lasagna with the same ingredients is far superior..

I stuck to the recipe exactly with the only exception of using sweet instead of mild sausage.  The beauty of this dish is you can add anything you like. I think the ricotta is what makes you want to inhale this and I couldn't eat it fast enough, excellent dish which is large enough to feed many or have it 3 nights in a row with leftovers,  do it, make it, inhale.

Very easy and quite good, but the onions were not really cooked through with just baking. Next time, I'll sauté the onions before adding to the cheese/sauce/sausage mixture.

I liked this recipe because it wasn't too complicated and didn't have a ton of ingredients.  I think next time I will try to cook the onions with the sausage, I think the raw onion was a little too much for this recipe.

The only change I made was to cook the onion with the sausage when the sausage was partially cooked. I  also added an egg yolk because I had extra from the lemon fluff cake.

Could not find Ziti at my grocery store for some odd reason, so I substituted Rigatoni. Worked fine.

I had extra Ricotta leftover so I added spoonfuls on the top at the end. I also doubled the garlic because we like it a lot . Also had some extra shredded Mozzarella in the fridge, so added a bit to the cheese layers. Came out wonderful - in fact so much my family wants me to make it all the time!

Next time I may add just a little bit more Italian Sausage though, as I felt there wasn't as much as I prefer in a dish like this.

Lastly, I doubled the recipe. Not a good idea unless you want to feed several armies! Next time I'll stay with the original quantity.

I follow the recipe as written.  It was delicious and well received.  One teen that ate it liked it so well that he sent his grandmother to get the recipe.  She gladly did, because he doesn't usually like anything but fast food.  I have served it several times.  It makes a lot.

This was absolutely the best baked ziti I have ever eaten.  The only thing I changed was to make the sauce from scratch instead of using store bought.

I made this recipe for the first time using items that I already had available. I substituted Kielbasa for the Italian Sausage, but already had some sausage in the spaghetti sauce I had previously made and used up. I like the Italian Sausage in this better. The meal was still good though. I also added some Monterey Jack Cheese along with the Mozzarella to make it real "gooey". This was a winner.

As mentioned in other reviews I cooked the sausage meat with the onion and garlic, and did not mix the pasta with the ricotta but layered the tomato sauce,  then meat, then ricotta then cheese and repeat.  I also added some red chili peppers to give it a slight kick. But be warned, as others have said, it makes a huge casserole that could easily feed a dozen plus people!

It was just ok. I thought it was kinda dry, even though I added the rest of the spaghetti sauce.  I was disappointed that the cheese stuck on the tin foil when I uncovered the pan. Not sure I'd make it again.

I didn't have ziti noodles so I used some egg noodles I did have. It was good, but the ziti noodles as recommended in this recipe would've been much better!!  I also added parmesan on top of the cheese layer and really liked it!  This recipe is really similar to how I fix lasagna so it was very easy to follow!

My husband and 17 year old liked it especially, my husband.  He said "this is really good".     I forgot to buy the onion and was stuck using dried onion flakes.   I'm sure it will be better next time.

I would probably bake it at a slightly higher temperature.  The amount of food that this makes does not want to heat through in 30 minutes in a moderate oven, at least not my oven.  So, I raised the temperature for the last 10 minutes to 375 degrees F. This make it bubble.

Great recipe as written. I had to change it so only 4 stars. I recommend making your own sauce and doubling the amount. I also had to bake it for 20 min longer for it to cook completely through.

I liked this recipe very much, I grew up with homemade spaghetti sauce & I have always made my own, so naturally I did not use jarred sauce in the recipe. So other than the sauce, the only other change I made was that I used Jimmy Dean HOT sausage. I was in a time crunch so I didn't have time to make my usual sauce, instead I used one can 28 oz can diced tomatoes, small can of paste, put in my Ninja, I added basil, oregano, Italian seasonings & a dash of water, blended & used that for my spaghetti sauce. I baked in a a covered casserole dish for 20 minutes covered & then 10 minutes uncovered.  I love spicy so of course topped my portion with crushed red peppers. My husband loved it so much he gave me a high five twice!!

Make exactly per recipe (as should happen first time) and it came out great.  Served with cheesy garlic bread and was able to use the remaining 1/2 jar of sauce.

I followed this recipe exactly as written and it was wonderful!!!  I always use Classico "four cheese" sauce and it turns out very well.  Like most recipes that call for prepared sauce, make sure you find one that you really like- not just anything.  The sauce will make or break any recipe.

Really liked this one!  Based on other reviews I did tweek a few things, but just slightly!  Added a bit more sausage and made a mixture of regular and spicy sausage.  Also, used less sauce, maybe a jar and a half altogether.  Followed the rest of the recipe and it was great!  I will definitely make this again and it was so easy!  Thanks for a great recipe!

4/8/2017 Made this tonight. Very Good! I used hot Italian sausage (casings removed) which gave it a nice little bite. I eyeball things more than actually measuring so I may have gone a little heavier on the spices. I used two jars of Classico spicy tomato and basil. Cooked the pasta very al dente. Pasta finished cooking in the oven. The Zita was perfect, not dry and not soupy. Make sure you let this rest for about 10 minutes before serving.

I made a few changes to this recipe I added 2 lb. mild of Italian sausage. I also add more cheese to this dish.  When I was done it look like a lasagna. I added more spaghetti sauce to where it was not dry. I I use the whole jar of prego with Italian sausage When I. was done it look like a lasagna but didn't taste like one. There was one complaint about the oregano everyone in. the family love it.

Very easy, very good. I used 1 jar of sauce rather than 1.5 jars.  I also used spicy Italian sausage, cut into small pieces. With the noodles and cheese, this gives the dish a very mild spice...Nice!

Thought it was a good basic recipe. Changes I made were to use ground round and cottage cheese instead of ricotta, as I don.t care .for it

Being Italian American I never use bottled sauce...ever!
We always make our own from Italian canned plum tomatoes or at lease a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes.  Bottled sauces have too many preservatives and sugar.

This is very good but needs more sausage. The recipe calls for the cheese/pasta mixture to be mixed in a large bowl, but don't believe it. You will need a gigantic bowl!

Are used chickpea pasta instead and Parmesan cheese because I didn't have anything else.

Given that, if I had It would still ended up cold, with raw onions.  It's a good base though, I would suggest cooking the onions and garlic with the sausage then mixing everything together because things don't cook at that temperature for that amount of time correctly.  and maybe using fresh basil would make this better .

375 -400 seems like a better temperature and I would double the time with the foil on top.  I'm starving and I just had to bump up the heat to 400, re-cover it and stick it back in the oven for another 20 minutes I'm going to leave it uncovered for 5 to 10 again as well.

Baked in a 7 x 11 pan and it was a bad idea.   Mounded out of the pan and came out cold, but still good; surprisingly didn't spill over while baking.  Just microwaved servings to make up for being cold.  Super cheasy; if you want to work on your winter survival layer, then cheese it up; however I felt like a fatty with the cheese to noodle ratio.  I would not sub a low fat ricotta, but perhaps cut the portion.   Next time I'll sauté the onions slightly just to experiment.

I made this last week for a pot luck, and it was a hit.  I used the exact ingredients that are in the recipe, except for the fact that I needed enough to fit a 10x15" pan.  I doubled the recipe except only used a pound and a half of ground sausage which was plenty.  I not only filled that pan, but had enough to put into an 8x8 pan and put in the freezer.  There were ppl that went up for seconds and asked where I got the recipe.  I've made baked ziti before but never with the ground sausage...it will now be a staple when making it again, it really does add flavor to the recipe.  i give it 5 stars...3/8/2017

I found this to be simple and tasty.    I had to sub cottage cheese for the ricotta because I didn't have any ricotta on hand.  It was still great. I also added some grated Parmesan cheese to the top.

I made the recipe as stated, but used 1/2 lb hot Italian sausage with 1/2 lb regular Italian sausage.  Also, one of my kids won't eat things with visible onion in it, so I subbed 2 T onion powder in place of the large onion.  I used a 45 oz jar of Prego Tomato, Onion and Garlic.  Everyone loved it!  Next time I will add some extra sauce though as a personal preference.  Thanks for a great recipe!

An excellent recipe. Very flavorful and didn't dry out even when reheated. Not a fan of oregano so I left it out, and that was the only change I made. Everybody loved it, from my in-laws to my grandson. Will definitely make again.

This was really good!  We had 12 ample sized dinner portions!  So next time, I'll definitely add more meat.  I liked 1/2 Sausage and 1/2 hamburger, but might try kac2research's suggestion of adding 1/2 pound ground beef to the 1 pound of sausage.  I used Penne pasta because the store didn't have Ziti.  Everyone enjoyed it--all 3 times!

It was quick, easy and tastes pretty good. When I make this again, I will cook the onion with the Italian sausage. It was raw after 25 minutes in the oven, and had to cook longer to get rid of the bitter taste. Also, I used less basil on top; 1 teaspoon of dried herb is A LOT as a topping.

I made this as written and it wasn't that great. In future, I will sauté onion and garlic with the sausage - then add the sauce and heat through. This had a raw taste with crunchy onions and garlic.

This was just okay. I increased the garlic and added some red pepper flakes but it wasn't outstanding in any way. My husband said he'd be happy to eat it again but wouldn't care if I didn't cook it again. I think it might be a good potluck dish, nothing too offensive. My sister probably said it best when she described it as forgettable. You could probably spend some time tweaking it to make it more exciting but I'm not sure it's worth it. Sorry, I was hoping this would have been better.

I thought this was rather bland, dry, and average. Next time I will make my own sauce and spice it up a bit. Add more meat, and double the ricotta. Won't add the ricotta to the sauce but rather make a layer in the middle. Sorry.

Edible but not enjoyable. Should have known better but the onion remains raw. Probably should have been browned first.  Also,  it ends up being Ziti w/ Ricotta and little sauce. I'd prefer more sauce and less Ricotta. Overall, it just isn't good. Can't understand all the high reviews.

It was absolutely delicious, my first go around with Baked Ziti. My son made the choice out of 3 choices I gave him for dinner (he also had never had it). The only change I made, because that is what I was cooking with, I used hot sausage instead of mild and no hot red pepper flakes. Will absolutely make over and over!

This is my second attempt at writing my first review ;) This was a delicious recipe and may be the best baked ziti I've ever had. I did make some changes because I didn't have all the correct ingredients and we like bold flavors. I basically doubled all the seasoning but used Italian seasoning instead, used 28 oz of Ricotta, 1 jar of vodka sauce and 1/2-3/4 jar of water. I also used a combo of mild and hot Italian sausage, mixed it all together and then put it in a big pan instead of layering. I then added a thick layer of mozzarella over the whole thing. I baked for 20 minutes covered with foil and 15 minutes uncovered. My husband and I loved it and had seconds! I look forward to making this again.

Very tasty! I added mushrooms and zucchini to the onions and sautéed them briefly. It was hearty and hit the spot on comfort food!

Fantastic! I only had cottage cheese on hand so I used that instead of ricotta, and it still came out awesome. Everyone loved it.

This wasn't bad, but it isn't something anyone in my family took seconds of or requested to have again.  It needed less ricotta and more sauce, and the amount of pasta listed was too much for a 9x13 pan.

This was absolutely divine! I was looking for a recipe I could give away to a family so they could either cook that evening or freeze for later. I was able to make a fully stuffed 13x9 pan and still had a perfect amount for a loaf pan. I think it's important not to skimp and use cheapy thin sauce that tastes like ketchup. I used Bertolli porcini mushroom and added freshly ground Italian seasoning and lots of fresh basil. I also strained one block of spinach (from frozen) which made it not just more pretty, but more healthy. Kroger had ground mild italian sausage so there was no need to take out of the casing - and it cost half as much. I cooked the sausage, drained and left a little fat in the pan to cook the onions and garlic. I had to use penne pasta. I've never had luck finding ziti unless it's a specialty market. Make this pronto! This is going into my holiday rotation. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

Used spicy turkey sausage and it was fantastic. My kids didn't love the spice but they don't love much so we will add it to the rotation.

I did not make any changes but wish I did. Way too much onion that was undercooked. Every bite had crisp onion, no one in family enjoyed.  I recommended cooking down the onions with the Italian sausage if you must attempt this recipe.

This recipe is delicious - especially with the sausage added.  I did make a few changes after reading other ziti recipes from this site.  I had provolone cheese and sour cream on hand so I added both.  This made for a very creamy texture which was out of this world delicious!!  I will make this again and again.  Definitely a crowd pleaser

This had good flavor, but I did end up changing a few things. Our family isn't big on onions so I left those out. I added zucchini, but wasn't happy with that change so wouldn't repeat. If I end up making this again, I think I'll try mushrooms and spinach to add some more veggies. Also we didn't have oregano so I used an Italian medley, which I think gave it a more interesting flavor. All in all I liked this and so did my husband.

I made the recipe without modification.  I thought that the raw onion was overpowering.  I will try it again someday but I would recommend reducing the amount of onion and sautéing it with the sausage as others have recommended.

Fast, easy and delicious! I added a pound of ground beef for a little extra protein. Makes a HUGE 9x13 pan(full to the brim), so great for a crowd. I froze half of the pan after cooking and brought it out a week later to defrost in the fridge, and it still tasted great after being warmed up. My picky four-year-old said, "This is the only thing I want to eat for dinner ever again. " :-) A definite winner that I will make many times in the future.

Delicious!  Only issue I had with the recipe was that it took about an hour to cook through the onions, 20 minutes barely heat up the corners.

I made it for the first time.  I used spicy sausage instead of mild, otherwise I stuck to the recipe.  Next time I will add fresh sliced mushrooms and some extra sauce.

This is one to make again.  I had to use rigatoni instead of ziti since here in Nevada I had a hard time finding ziti.  The only thing I did differently was add a can of diced italian tomatoes just for an extra bite.  I have to warn you this makes alot!  Great for after the game or make ahead for another night.  There is only 3 of us at home right now so afer we ate I refrigerated the left overs (so it could set nice).  The next day I put away to freeze about the amount we had eatten for dinner and still had enough for 3+ lunches.  will make again.

This is delicious. The only thing I'd change is to sweat the onions  and let them cool. This is otherwise a perfect recipe. I will be making this again with the one change.

This is a dish I have made several times. My family loves it and asks for "that baked ziti with the sausage". I use a spicy sausage to kick up the flavor a bit though. Mixing the ingredients in a large bowl does make the assembly much easier. I have found that keeping the dish in the oven for 40 minutes gets it to the temperature needed for serving. I also heat up a bit of extra sauce in a pot and have that on the table in case someone wants to top their ziti with extra sauce

Really, really good! I made this just as written except I used gluten free pasta and it worked out great. Honestly, you can't tell the difference so it is a great recipe to make if you have gluten eaters as well as gluten free diners. Both will enjoy this. And it makes enough to feed a crowd!

I loved this recipe but it needs more sauce. Rather than alter the recipe I served warmed marinara on the side. Perfect!

This was a good base recipe I added ground meat instead of pork and added garlic and spices to taste and it came out amazing. I can't wait to use this again.

Made this recipe exactly as posted... Omg! My family said... This is definitely a keeper! The only thing I slightly changed.. Instead of a whole onion.. I used only 1/2 onion.. That's my only change! Make it exactly as posted.. You will not be disappointed!

I used the same ingredients, I just mixed all together rather than layering it and it was a rock star.  This was better than the ones using Ricotta cheese, the sour cream and Provolone give it a nice kick.

I think this is just an okay recipe. I followed the directions exactly, and have the following thoughts. This recipe depends largely on your choice of pasta sauce. Using a jar makes this easy, but difficult to control flavors. The ricotta mixture is fine, but seems a bit too sweet. I don't think 20 minutes is sufficient, the dish comes out just warm enough to eat, not hot, and I don't think the amount of meat is enough for the volume.

This was delicious! I made it for a funeral and a sick family member and got rave reviews multiple times! I made it just as directed a day in advance. Coming cold from the fridge does require the baking time to be increased by about 10 minutes, just an FYI if you do the same.

I was a little suspicious when I realized that the onions and garlic go into the recipe raw but I followed the directions exactly as written since this recipe got such great reviews.  I thought that it was horribly oniony and garlicky (and these are both flavors I enjoy in moderation or when sauteed).  Also, I do not think that the cook time of 20 + 10 minutes was long enough to really "bake" the dish.  If I were to make this again I'd use half ground beef and half mild Italian sausage, I'd sautee the onion and garlic before adding to the mix, and I would cook covered for about 30 minutes before cooking uncovered for 10.  This recipe has potential but as written it's really disappointing.

The dish was wonderful. Everybody loved it with the exception of my hightened pregancy  scenses. I cut down on the spagetti sauce and the onions but still felt the onions were very overwhelming for me. I will definitly cook this again without the onions and maybe after my child is born i will try it again with the onions.

I made half of this recipe using hot Italian turkey sausage.  I used cottage cheese for the ricotta and I sautéed the onions, garlic and some crushed red pepper flakes with the sausage.  I got a bit ahead of myself and dumped all the spaghetti sauce in with the meat and pasta mixture.  Oooops!  No problem though, I put half of it in an 8x8” baking dish, sprinkled on half the cheese, using a bit more than called for, and repeated the two layers, adding a few tablespoons of freshly grated parmesan cheese to the top.  In hindsight, I’m not sure all of the layering indicated in the recipe is necessary , so I may repeat my "mistake" when making it again.  I made this ahead of time, covered and refrigerated it until I was ready to bake it.  Since mine was refrigerated, I baked it for 25 minutes covered, and another 15 minutes uncovered.  And I let it rest about 10 minutes before serving.  This made four large servings, or six more modest servings.   I froze two nice size servings to enjoy another time (soon), and Hubs ate some for lunch the next day.  Nice recipe, and one that will be repeated!  Thank you, Ashley!

I made this dish but unfortunately I forgot to pickup the ricotta cheese so my substitute was cottage cheese 2% low fat. I used fresh everything in seasoning. The wife thought if was amazing and wanted me to make sure I didn't lose the recipe. I'm wondering how it would of tasted if I would of had the ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. Just think thought, to make lasagna you use cottage cheese right, so I figured since I forgot the ricotta cheese at the store I figured I was the next and closes substitute I had on hand. I also use 3 large garlic clovers cause we love garlic in our Italian dishes, and three was just right for us. And I used just plain sausage instead of spicy. It's turned out great for me with all these substitutes I used. I gave this 4 stars, I thing with all the correct ingredients I don't think I could still give it 5 stars.

Made this as directed except I accidentally used extra spaghetti sauce. It was so delicious everyone at my home loved it. Make sure you cut the onions small, I didn't and that's the only thing I would do different.

Delicious! Only thing I would change for next time is to sautée the onions and garlic with the sausage. The onion pieces were still a little raw when it came out of the oven. Overall a great, flavorful recipe!

I made this tonight for dinner and it was delicious.  Next time will do half an onion and will be sure to chop it smaller.  Not just a throw together.  Be prepared to do some dishes.  But it's worth it!

Great recipe. First baked ziti I ever made that didn't turn out too dry and had lots of flavor. Not so hard to make. It did make a lot. It barely fit in the 9 x 13 dish. Thanks.

I thought this ziti had good flavor.  I find the directions, however, to be a bit confusing and will make the dish differently next time.  First, like other reviewers, I recommend cooking the onions and garlic with the sausage.  Next, to be clearer, I think step four should be two steps.  I believe the ricotta cheese, egg, and oregano should be combined.  In another dish, the pasta mixture, the sausage, the salt and pepper, and a portion of the sauce should be combined.  When I first made this dish, I interpreted the directions as indicating that the pasta, sausage, salt and pepper, and sauce should added to the cheese mixture after the cheese mixture was thoroughly mixed.  The result was a creamy tomato sauce covering the pasta, and the ricotta cheese got lost in the dish.  Next time, I will keep the ricotta cheese mixture separate from the pasta/sausage/sauce mixture, and then layer them in the casserole dish like I would a lasagne.

Really dice the onion into tiny pieces or just use onion powder instead.  This was a hit with the family!  I used spicy sausage for a kick.

Will not make again.  I made the mistake of making the full recipe and now am stuck with all the leftovers.  I agree with the other comments that the onion does not cook at all in the oven and is far too overpowering, and sausage is not a good combination with the rest of the ingredients.  The sauce is bland and tasted bad.

I did use whole wheat rotini and hot Italian sausage(fried and rinsed).
An easy dish to prepare and very tasty.

A great meal for a large family!  Very tasty and the texture was fine, unlike reported by another review I've read here.  The only changes I made were to add sliced fresh baby bella mushrooms and use a spicy spaghetti sauce.  Will definitely make again.

SO GOOD!!!  I didn't have ricotta and substituted cottage cheese.  It was still so delicious.  The sausage makes a great compliment.  I added fennel to the sauce and it was just amazing!

This was very good ! I browned the onions and garlic right in with the sausage and used the whole jar of spaghetti sauce. Only made half the receipe & it was perfect for just the two of us. Served it with garlic Ciabatta Rolls !

Well, this is a keeper! I've made it twice in four days! Family LOVED IT! A couple, teeny changes. As I browned the sausage, I put the onion into my food processor to make it applesauce consistency. I then poured the onions in with the sausage to simmer together a bit. Did this mostly because my son will not eat onions if he knows It! I also added pecorino Romano cheese to the ricotta cheese mixture. Can never have enough cheese. But needless to say, this will be made at least monthly and for parties!!

My only change was using whole wheat pasta.  Made enough for several meals.  I froze one & we still had enough for two more dinners (I cook for just two of us).  Hubs said it was the best  pasta dish ever!

An excellent recipe. I will make it again, however I'll precook the onion a little as they didn't get done. My grandsons & the whole family love this!

Wow!  I made the recipe with only a few minor changes.  I browned the onion, garlic, and herbs (I used fresh basil and parsley) along with the sausage.  I made a slightly larger pan (10x14) so I used about a cup more of ricotta cheese.  I also added in some grated Parmesan and Romano cheese, both into the mixture and sprinkled on top.  It was so delicious!  My family gave it rave reviews.  I'll definitely be making it again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I like this recipe. The only thing I wish I had done differently was sauté the garlic and onion.  That definitely needs to happen next time I make it. I did add mushrooms and spinach to mine. I will make this again. It's fast and easy.

Love how easy a and cheesy this recipe turned out! Definitely a 5 star dish! I put the onions, garlic, and seasoning in the pan with the sausage. Added extra mozz cheese on top, baked it for 25 minutes, then 10, then let it sit for 15 minutes. Husband and his friend ate two servings and wished they had room for more.

I followed the directions for the most part except I combined sauce, sausage and a diced zucchini.  I also used a little more garlic. My husband and son loved it!  My husband said it tasted gourmet compared to our traditional pasta dishes.  I like it but perhaps next time cut back a little
On the ricotta cheese.

Because of amounts of sauce I had available, I mixed Fire Roasted pizza sauce with the spaghetti sauce I had, to make enough for the recipe. It was very good. It's definitely a keeper for our family.

If you like lasagna you're going to love this recipe! I followed the advice from others and cooked the onion and garlic with the sausage. I used 1.5 lbs of sausage and a 45 oz jar of delgrosso meat flavored sauce because I like extra sauce to dip my garlic bread into. I also had leftover mozzarella that I added to the italian cheese blend. Received several compliments, will definitely make again!

Made some minor changes based on personal preference - used hot Italian sausage, and cooked the onion and garlic with the sausage - turned out great! Was kind of like lasagna in a different form with the layering of the pasta, red sauce, and cheese sauce. And who doesn't love lasagna?!?

This was very tasty and easy to make. I didn't bake it but combined it all on the stove and cooked it in a big pot. I did however double the meat. Even my kids liked it!

Very easy to make and it makes a lot.  I didn't change a thing.  The sausage gave it a nice spicy taste and the ricotta made the whole dish very creamy.  Great for leftovers or a freezer dinner.

I followed the directions as best as I could but my onions still turned out crunchy. Also, it was pretty watery on the bottom. It did taste very good to me, although my husband couldn't finish it. I would definitely try to make this again, but make a few changes.

I added a few more spices and it was delicious. We're on our 4th night of eating it as leftovers so you know it's good!

We enjoyed this, but felt it needed more flavour. Next time I will add some sweet red chili sauce, a few red pepper flakes, and grated fresh parmesan.  Thank you original submitter!

I substituted sausage for chicken apple sausage and 1/2 lb of ground turkey. I also added some chopped mushrooms and chopped bell pepper. It was delicious.

Easier to make than lasagna with a similar taste.  We always like extra sauce so I made a meat sauce instead of adding the sauce and meat separately .  I also prepared gluten free using 12 oz of gluten free pasta because it only comes in a 12 oz package.  I added an extra cup of shredded cheese too.

Turned out great , I substituted vegan sausage ( homemade-basically textured vegetable protein, veggie stock and spices) for the sausage  and added a little Parmesan cheese. Lunches for the next couple days. The only thing I'd consider changing is adding a little more salt but that's easily done after the fact , if one so desires.

I didn't make any changes except to add more seasoning b/c what's listed didn't seem like enough. 
This was OK, and I expected something a bit more flavorful (for my taste) than the end result. It wasn't hard to make, but with all the steps and dirty bowls/pans, the final dish wasn't worth it to me. Thanks, anyway, for posting the recipe.

Decent recipe. Made this with ground beef and the sausage. Added sautéed mushrooms, of course, upped the garlic. Whole wheat ziti. Next time I will try the no-boil pasta for simplicity in preparation.

I used 0.5 kilogram of spiral pasta; 0.5  kg spicy Italian sausages; roughly 0.5 kg of ricotta cheese; parmesan instead of Italian because I couldn't find in supermarket; 4 crushed garlic cloves; and half cup of red wine.

It was a good recipe, although a little bland for our taste.  I even used hot italian sausage and enjoyed it with that change.  But not sure if I will make again.

This was pretty good I used 4 cheese  sausage instead of mild and mozzarella cheese instead of Italian blend and I didn't put as much sauce because I didn't want it to drown with sauce and it came out perfect ?? I would probably make this again but with  lasagna instead of ziti

Very easy and tastier than spaghetti because of all the added cheese. I only used one jar of sauce and it wasn't quite enough so be sure to use the full suggested amount. Ground beef and cottage cheese work as substitutes.

My husband and I both liked the dish a lot. It is easy to prepare with readily available ingredients, the instructions and timing are easy and accurate.  We liked the fact that the pasta is tossed in the cheese blend before layering.  Every bite had pasta, cheese and meat. The only change I made was 1 tbs onion powder instead of the onion. I did not miss the onion bits and the flavor was good.

This was very good and I will make it again with a couple of tweeks. I will add some red pepper flakes to the sausage for some added spice. Also, the onion didn't soften very well when baked and was a bit too crunchy for my family's taste so next time I will either sauté the onion with the sausage or grate the onion into the cheese mixture. I also divided this into two portions and will freeze one for later. Great easy baked pasta recipe!!!

Super yummy! Tastes like a really good restaurant pasta. Honest. Husband who HATES pasta said it was the best pasta he ever had and brings it up occasionally. I used rotini and it was still great. Used the whole 2 jars of sauce and was a little too much so I would stick to what recipe calls for

I made this for my son's birthday dinner. It was a big hit. I added 1/2 c sour cream, based on reviews, to make it creamier. I also used 1/2 lb ground beef and 3 Italian turkey sausage for  flavor. The combination gave it good texture. It's consistency is a  cross between lasagna & mostaccioli that is full of flavor.

Everything was fine except there was a little too much oregano. Also, something told me to sautee/soften the onions or add them to the meat while cooking instead of adding them raw to the ricotta mixture, because they didn't soften once the dish was done. So, for those reasons, I gave the dish 3 stars. Other than that, it was good and I will make it again after making some changes.

Loved it! 
I did use the basil. 
I would recommend cooking onion first, unlike the recipe calls for. 
I used PREGO Sundries tomatoes & basil sauce.

I doubled the recipe for my dad's 80th birthday party. The whole family was there and it was a hit! My changes: I used a combination of beef, veal, and pork instead of the sausage, After browning the meat and draining most of the fat, I sautéed the onion and garlic in the same pan with the meat, and then added about a cup of red cooking wine (1/2 cup for a single recipe). Lastly, I added salt to the ricotta cheese mixture and for the sauce I used Victoria's marinara sauce from a jar. I also used a little more sauce than the recipe called for. It was absolutely delicious.

My family cleaned their plates! I decided to make my sauce from scratch and I'm so glad i did. If i had to add anything to this recipe it would be to add 1/3 more sauce , 1/3 more ricotta and 1/3 more Italian spread cheese.   Great recipe!

Absolute favorite for teenage son and it is inexpensive to make.  I found the amount of onion to be excessive even when I sauteed it, used 1/4 instead.  9 x 13 is a HUGE amount, so when a smaller batch is needed, I use a scale to cut the recipe in half and the results are the same, just 1/2 as much =)

LOVED this recipe!  Made it last minute last night and followed the recipe with the exception of adding more sauce (my husband likes lots of sauce).  Had I not, I think it would have been too dry.  I make sauce in big batches, so added one cup to bottom of baking dish.  Two cups to first layer and another 3 cups to top to make sure it wouldn't dry out.  I minced the onion fine so that was not an issue.  Added 2 1/2 tsp. of fresh garlic, and did sprinkle the dry basil on top before baking.   I found that I also had to bake much longer than directions.  Baked 20 minutes covered and then another 25 uncovered.  It was perfectly heated through and the balance of ingredients was great.  Will make this again.

Very good, this will now be my baked ziti recipe! Kids loved it and asked that I make it more often, hard-to-impress husband gave it two thumbs up. Followed the recipe exactly with the exception of cooking the onion and garlic along with the sausage, it seemed strange not to do that (wondered if it was an omission). Awesome!

Though that the large onion was too much for the pasta. That and it needed to be precooked and not tossed in raw, very crunchy, not something you would expect baked ziti

This was very good. My 10 year old daughter cleaned her plate. She said she loved it! My 20 year old daughter is vegetarian so I made a small batch in a bread pan without the sausage. She loved that as well. This does make a lot. Plenty for if you are having company or for leftovers. I will definitely make it again.

Well, we have been eating this ziti casserole all week so I thought I'd better rate it before I forgot.  It was certainly better the 2nd day.  Nice balance of flavors.  I added some chopped peppers, mushrooms and a few black olives that I had on hand. Lightly roasted some eggplant and put a layer of eggplant in the middle of this as well.  Very nice dinner for several nights;  will make again. Thank you.

I made a few changes like adding more sauce and green pepper. I found that after the suggested cooking time the casserole did not heat all the way thru. I had to add about 25 minutes more . Each family member had to heat it more in the microwave which held up the dinner. It  was okay but I do not think i will fix it again.

I made this for a potluck at work and it was good, apart from the onion. It calls for one large yellow onion, diced. I would, in the future, change this to 1 medium sized or small onion. All I could taste was onion. I'm someone who *really* loves garlic, and I knew the guests at he potluck were like minded, so I even doubled the garlic and still, all you could taste was onion. Other than that, solid recipe. I'll certainly make it again, it was crazy easy to slap together.

we really liked it, but next time we will make it with a lot less onion. i used a whole medium onion and we all found it too overwhelming. but it is definitely making it into rotation.

I liked it as written, however modifications I made the next time was to use a combination of italian sausage and ground beef, and added mushrooms.   Next time I need to use a few more spices to make up for using part ground beef instead of all sausage., and I think I'll add some red bell pepper, and using another tip will sprinkle some parmesan cheese on top.

This turned out great, and made great leftovers since it reheats very easily. A few modifications was that I used sweet sausage instead of mild, I used rigatoni instead of ziti, and I used my own personal sauce recipe.

Too much onion. If I made it again, I would omit the onion, and replace the ricotta with cottage cheese.

This was very good! I didn't make any changes and thought it turned out well. I'm only giving it 4 stars because there wasn't enough cheese in my opinion. It seemed to get overpowered by the rest of the ingredients. I really love cheese in my pasta dishes so that was a little disappointing. Still tasted great though and I will be making it again. Very easy to prepare!

This is my favorite ziti recipe.  I've been making this for a few years, and it is a family favorite.  

In addition, I add a few cups of chopped spinach to the ricotta mixture.  My boys hardly notice, but it's an easy veggie to add.

It was really good. It makes tons!! What I'll do different next time is sauté the onions until they are no longer crunchy. The onion taste was especially overwhelming with the left overs.

I used Prego and Newmans own sauce and added six cloves of minced garlic and instead of using ricotta cheese, I used about a half a jar of garlic flavored alfredo sauce. Layered everything together, sprinkled alot of cheese on top and baked until it was bubbly and cheese had a good light brown crust on top from the broiler.

This recipe is on point, especially if you love cheese!! Even my husband who claims to not like pasta enjoyed this. Followed the recipe exactly and we served with garlic bread. This makes a lot, so it's great for groups or a pot luck.

Made this exactly as the recipe called for.  The only change I made was adding a bit more garlic.  It was delicious.  Next time I will add a bit more Italian sausage and more tomato sauce.  These ittle changes will make it perfect!

WAY too many onions, recipe calls for 1 onion, I would use maybe half at the most. It was pretty much onions with a little pasta in it. I stopped short of one full onion as I was wary of it when I was making it, but even about 3/4 of one is too much. Besides that I liked the sauce and everything else, just could not get passed the insane amount of onions.

Slightly larger 9.5 X 13.5 glass dish, only 2 bottles of marina, may need more than 8oz of cheese to top off. Bake for 30 min then 15 min w/no foil. Spray bottom side of foil so as not to stick to cheese

Kid approved!  It was very good and lots of flavor.  I added more Italian seasonings and doubled the cheese.  I'd also recommend sautéing the onions with the Italian sausage.   Great leftovers!

Great recipe!  I made one change, I reduced the amount of spaghetti sauce and added cottage cheese.  Then I added two extra ingredients, zucchini and green pepper.

This is a fabulous recipe! So simple yet packed with flavor. They key is to use a high quality Italian sausage. We are fortunate to have a great Italian deli/meat market in town. This recipe is great for sharing (potluck, meal train, etc.)

I make this recipe often.  I sometimes use hamburger in place of the sausage and it is great either way.  The recipe comes together quickly and feeds a bunch! One of my favorites!

This was a Father's Day hit.  The only change I made was to add fresh basil I was growing.  It will feed a crowd, or do as I did and put half in the freezer.

My family loves this recipe.  The only changes I made was to sauté the onions with the sausage and add a little Italian seasoning and fresh basil.

This was delicious.  The whole family loved it and couldn't get enough. It also made great leftovers for lunches.  I have made this twice now.  The first time, I didn't make any changes to the recipe - other than using fat free ricotta. The second time, I sauteed some mushrooms and threw those in.  It was excellent either way.  We'll make it again often!

I made the recipe exactly as instructed and it was delicious. Good thing, too, as I made the full 8 servings version for three people, and was eating leftovers for a week. :-)

I have a tiny, petite, little 20 month old daughter who weighs 20lbs soaking wet and holding a brick... At least, she did before I made this. She ate what can only be described as disturbing amounts of this ziti. Oh, the adults all liked it a lot too!

Loved it!  So did my husband and kids.  Even the 3-year-old asked for seconds.  Definitely serves 8 hefty portions, maybe more like 10.  Great flavor!  We didn't have mozzarella, so we used Colby Jack, and I really liked it.  It seems like this recipe would handle additions and substitutions well, and it was easy to prep and baked fast.  Can't go wrong with this dish!

I used a combination of beef and Italian Turkey sausage.  After the bake is finished I stirred and topped with parmesan and stirred a splash of olive oil.  It gives the food a more robust flavor in my opinion when this is done just before serving.  One of my all time favorite dishes.

Huge portions. Great recipe. Versatile: used what I had, which was black bean burgers instead of sausage and rotini instead of ziti. Excellent. I will make it again for sure and can't wait to try with sausage.

Made this several times and is great, easy recipe.  Only recommendation, I omitted the onions, seemed overbearing on the taste and 1 whole onion was a lot.  Other than that, always followed the recipe exactly!

This tasted amazing! Instead of a jar of pasta sauce I used homemade marinara that I stewed all day in the crock pot and added Italian flavored ground turkey. YUM!!

I was running late bringing this to my boyfriend's work so I just skipped the layering and mixed it all together evenly before baking. It turned out great! I also added some crushed red pepper for spice, and everyone loved the dish. Thanks!

This was really good. The bake time needs adjustment considering the amount this makes. I followed it almost perfectly, only difference is I used sweet Italian sausage. Poached and then browned in a frying pan, I added minced garlic while browning the sausage, cut into cubes and mixed with part of the sauce and ricotta. I used mozzarella and sharp cheddar (both shredded) because that's what I had on hand. It was really good, needed more garlic for my taste and I omitted the onion and used a generous amount of onion powder throughout each stage. I served it with cheesy bread and a small side salad. Definitely one of my favorites. Next time I'll add a little more sauce and ricotta mixture. Oh and I added about 1/2 cup of cheese extra. Delicious!

My family LOVES this recipe. However, for a quick alternative, we use frozen meatballs (Italian or turkey) in lieu of the sausage (my husband not a fan of sausage) and add extra cheese (both ricotta and mozzarella). Just heat up the meatballs so you can cut through them and add to the recipe. I have made this countless times and it is always a hit!

This recipe was simple and delicious.  As some of the other reviewers have stated, cooking the onion slightly before mixing it in would create a better balance of flavors.  I love onion, but it was a little too much with the more mild tomato flavor.  Excellent dish though!  I definitely plan on making this again.  It's also nice that the ingredients aren't too expensive.  And leftovers will last for the next few days!!

I usually add mushrooms and spinach to the sausage. I also cook the onion and seasonings with the sausage mixture. I use whole wheat pasta and fat free ricotta. I don't always layer it either, I just mix it all together and top with cheese.

I made this for a Small XMAS family gathering and everyone loved it. We had 12 people and the original recipe said makes 8 servings so I doubled it. We went thru the first dish and a partial of the second. We all had left overs for the next day. I used ground beef in place of sausage and it worked well. I will definitely make this again!!!

I made this and it was just ok.. I felt like it tasted like something you could buy in a frozen bag. It was very boring.

This recipe was really flavorful. Only thing different was I used my homemade sauce, but kept the amount the same. I baked this for 1 hour on 350, removing the foil in the last 15 minutes of baking time. From the looks of it, it may have been too soupy baking for only 30 minutes.

We loved this recipe!  I added a little more spaghetti sauce otherwise I followed it exactly.  My entire family loved it including my picky 6 year old.  I gave a little to a friend of mine and she said it was restuarant quality!  We will be making this again!

My family liked it. Very moist and cheesy. I used really cheap spaghetti sauce, but now that I know the recipe is a keeper, I'll use a better, more flavorful sauce next time. I cooked the onion and garlic with the sausage, and had to bake in the oven about 10 minutes longer than the instructions said.

Okay so tried tonight and not great.  Next time, if I do, you have to sauté onions and for a couple minutes and then add the garlic and then sauté the sausage, I used spicy turkey.  Onion and garlic to strong a flavor.

Excellent recipe. Changes I made (due to lack of ingredients): Only had 1 jar of pasta sauce so I reserved about 1 cup of the pasta water and mixed with the jar of pasta. Didn't have sausage so I used sliced mini-pepperoni from a bag and also cut up some homemmade soppresata. Turned out delicious! Served with baked Butterball turkey meatballs (which in-and-of-themselves are delicious) and asiago cheese bread. Excellent dinner and totally easy to make!

I made this as the recipe stated but did not use the ricotta. I think that was a mistake. I'll probably make this again and I'll be sure to add the ricotta when I do. But I'll also add some additional spices because I thought it was a tad bland for my taste. This was a good recipe that I'll continue to make but I won't be raving about it as I have some others.

I wasn't sure what to expect from this recipe, as the ingredients suggested it might be a little bland. I am so glad we tried it! We used turkey sausage instead of Italian and omitted the onion (we didn't have any). It was very flavorful and creamy. What leftovers we had were gone in a day or so, and my husband never eats leftovers! It's a great standard that you can play around with.

Good base recipe. I replaced about 1/4 of the pasta with veggies: diced peppers, and carrots + spinach minced in the food processor (my husband barely notices them this way!) Also used reduced fat cheese.

It was quite tasty.  I used my homemade marina sauce, so the seasoning was just how we like it in my house.  I keep trying to replicate the ziti from a restaurant I frequented in college, and this didn't do it - not cheesy enough.  I guess I'll keep looking, but I'll hang on to this recipe b/c it was easy and yummy.

I made this for dinner tonight and my family loved it! It was very easy to make. The only adjustment I made was I used my own pasta sauce instead of sauce from a jar. Even my youngest son who is very picky asked for seconds! We will definetly be adding this into our dinner rotation. Thanks for a great recipe.

I have made this recipe quite a bit. It is lovely. We are a gluten free household and this recipe was simple to convert. My husband doesn't care for rice pasta and I miss it. He sure likes this recipe though there is enough flavor to cover the nutty taste of it. Thanks!!

I had last minute company coming over for dinner, and they had two small children. This recipe was incredible! It was quick and easy and even the kids loved it! One of our guests expressed that she was not a fan of lasagne and was nervous to try it, but she LOVED it just like we all did. Best ziti I have ever made! Thank you!

Well, I have a new dinner staple.  It was very tastey and very easy to prepare.  It does make a very large amount - I would say it makes 10 to 12 servings.

My husband works in the meat industry, so we get a LOT of Italian chicken sausage from the factory.  This is a great recipe to use up all the sausage I have.  Kids love it like spaghetti, and you can actually use whatever pasta you have handy.

When I make this, I usually double it, split into several disposable casserole dishes (4 8x8's), and freeze for extra meals. I use 1Lb mild and 1Lb hot Italian sausage, and after cooking I add the onion and diced red pepper, cook down a little then add fresh spinach and garlic. I also use jarred sauce with mushrooms. I love making this dish!

The best baked ziti ever! I made a few very, very minor changes that wouldn't affect the results. I used a bit more cheese and sauteed the onion and garlic with the sausage but...that's it. I followed the recipe and it is fabulous!

This was really really good.  I used Andouille sausage but truthfully, it didn't even need it..next time I think I'll make it w/out meat, its that good and doesn't need anything else.  Very tasty and a good consistency.  Loved it!

Cheesy and delicious! My husband loves Ricotta, and this was perfect... it didn't make the dish too heavy. As I can never follow a recipe without modification, I added orange pepper and spinach... delicious!!!

Excellent recipe. Sausage makes ziti a perfect alternative to lasagna. The only change I would make is that next time I will use less pasta in order to increase the flavor of the other ingredients.

I think this is better the next day.  Nothing wrong with it, just could have a bit more flavor.  I'll keep this recipe, but will look for a better one too.

This is a delicious recipe! I made it to bring to a friend's house and it travelled really well right out of the oven.  The modifications I made: I used 2 full jars of pasta sauce because I used Classico which is very chunky. I think if you use a thinner, pourable sauce you can use less. But, my friend really liked the chunky tomatoes so I would do the same thing again.  I used a little less onion than was called for and I pureed the onion and garlic in a food processor with a little bit of the ricotta before adding the rest of the ricotta, egg, etc. I find pureeing onions to be a good solution to making sure you don't get the raw onion pieces and it seems to hide them from the kiddies : )  Finally, I used sliced sausage links instead of ground and instead of combining them with the pasta I laid the slices evenly across the pasta layers. This was good but I would try the ground if I could find it.

This was a really good recipe, but I thought it needed a couple small modifications.  I followed some earlier reviewers' advice and sautéed the onions and garlic in the same pan when I cooked the sausage, and added a bit of extra herbs (extra oregano and basil, some parsley, and a dash of cayenne pepper) to the ricotta mixture.  I thought it looked a little dry, too, so I added almost two full jars of sauce.  My roommate and I both loved it like this - delicious!

Next time I would only use half an onion... it was way to oniony for me!  My fiance loved it though.

This was pretty darn good.  I made it for my hubby's class while they were testing and they loved it.
