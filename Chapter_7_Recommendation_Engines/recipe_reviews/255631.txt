I never make changes the first time out with a recipe. This one doesn't need changing.

Yummy goodness!! Usually I don't change the recipe the first time I make it, but we were missing a few ingredients so I improvised . Used peaches and Ginger ale instead of apple cider because we didn't have apple cider or apples. Next time I would double the spices but we all loved the recipe! Thank you

Chef John is right on about cooking up the apples before hand; they were delicious and didn't make the batter too wet like can happen sometimes.  I will be incorporating this step into other apple recipes like apple blondies.

As for the rest of the fritter, well, it was an utter disaster.  they were too airy so that I could barely flip them without them falling apart.  So, I added more flour which helped a little but they were still too airy and the flavor was dulled a bit because of it.  

I have to blame that on the baking powder.  For some reason the listed amount was too much.  Does it have to do with altitude?  (I'm in a high altitude area) I don't know, but it never effected any of my other recipes this way.  Regardless, I love apple fritters so, I will try again with less baking powder next time.

My husband, the guinea pig,  said the flavor was good and we will salvage the crispy bits to eat with vanilla ice cream.  :0)

I have always preferred a yeast dough for my homemade apple fritters but I tried Chef John's recipe because of time and everyone loved them.  I made half apple and half raspberry, really yummy warm!

I used apple pie filling instead of apples and I used 1/2 Bob's Red Mill and white rice flour  to make it gluten free.  I also used hard cider because I didn't have sparkling cider.  They tasted great just didn't look like fritters.  Love Chef John's you tube video's!!

I doubled the recipe and it worked great. Since frying isn't one of my favorite things, I fried the  all the fritters on both sides (but not fully), drained them and then put them in a 350 F oven for about 10 minutes to finish the dough in the center. It made it easier for me dealing with twice as many fritters. My son and husband loved them.

I doubled the batch ( guess I have faith in Chef John... he hasn't steered me wrong yet!). I didn't want to change the recipe but I had to make some substitutions out of necessity.  I didn't have baking powder  so I used baking soda and yogurt as a rising agent instead. Because I used the yogurt, I didn't need as much liquid so I only used about 1/2 c. of liquid. I didn't have sparkling apple cider so I used a combination of the juice drained off of the cooked apples and some sparkling spiced pumpkin cider. I also covered them with cinnamon sugar in lieu of the frosting because was out of confectioners sugar. I fried them in peanut oil because that's what I had on hand. (I definitely need to go shopping!) I used more batter than Chef John but still ended up with 17 apple fritters approximately 3-4" in diameter. They're awesome!

The final batter came out too mushy so I had to add more flour. Taste wise, they were very good.

These are amazing!!! I used Martinelli's Apple Cider in the dough and glaze, do not skip this ingredient. I think that is what makes it so delicious and addictive!! I followed all of the instructions. The only issues I had was having too large of scoops when frying (my dough was a little thicker) so the dough was raw on the inside and cooked on the outside (it was my first time frying). But I was able to place them in the oven (center rack and used parchment paper on a cookie sheet) at 370 degrees for about 10-12 mins and that saved them. There were a few that cooked all the way through from frying, so I tried those and was very impressed with the flavor. Next time I'll use smaller scoops of dough in the oil. Also, the glaze is great drizzled on top and as a dip on the side. I've definitely added this to my arsenal of recipes -- thanks Chef John!

I followed this to the letter. Perfect! Please do not get confused about the apple cider. Donâ€™t use apple cider vinegar as one reviewer did. Just apple cider

Really nice! I skipped all the spices except cinnamon (and I put a lot more) and it was delicious! First time I did fritters and it was sooo easy!!! I'll do it again, for sure. Thanks Chef John!

Really liked the apple cooked partially before putting in the batter. Made it per instructions. Good fritter. I think Iâ€™ll up the spices a little next time. Thank you for my new go to recipe!

Very good but hard to control oil spatter in a pan. Made in a deep fryer, which made cooking them cleaner... but now I still have a mess to clean up the deep fryer!! This was my first foray into fried foods and will probably be my last, but not because of any deficiencies in this recipe: it's delicious. We did skip the topping, though: they are plenty sweet without it.

It didn't have enough dough to apple ratio. If I were to do it again, I would have to alter the proportions.

Fantastic!! I doubled the recipe and had 18 good-sized fritters. Instead of apple cider, I used another's suggestion to use ginger ale. Instead of glazing them, I tossed them in cinnamon & sugar while still warm.

These were good, but I would prefer the batter to be a little sweeter with a touch more cinnamon. Next time I would also add some cinnamon to the apples when adding the sugar. I would also use any drained liquid from the apples to make the glaze, double the glaze and dip the fritters to coat completely. They came out nice and crispy and stayed crispy even after cooled. Very tasty as well. Easy enough to prepare.

Now I admit, it could easily be me.  I tested my Baking powder and it's oh hummm, the fritters seemed a little heavy, not cakey enough, tasty for sure but I'll have to give this a second try with fresh Baking Powder, and as an aside, it did seem like there were too many apples.

These were amazing!! I did not have sparkling apple cider so I used apple wine instead! It worked perfectly and I even had to make my own confectioners sugar but the glaze turned out fine. I will definitely be making these again!!!

Very yummy. Made them 2x now. First time I added the soda, second time all I had was milk. Honestly I liked the milk version better. First time was Apples and I think the Apple pieces need to be smaller then recommended. The second time I tried pears and they turned out super yummy. I made them for a big dinner party and everyone raves how good they were. If you have not tried them with pear I recommend the experience. Yum.

I made the recipe as written and they are delicious, however, I think the batter needs to be just a tad sweeter (I have a real sweet tooth). Next time I will thin down the glaze and dunk the whole top in it rather then drizzle...just my preference.  Thank you for posting this wonderful, easy recipe.

I made these using gingerale. Followed recipe exactly as written except for the size. I have a very small deep fryer so had to make smaller fritters. Cooled each batch while starting the next, glazed those that were done while the next batch was frying. When they were all done I had enough glaze left to glaze all of them a 2nd time. OMG! So good! Took them to a Farkle gathering with friends & they've been bugging me ever since to make them again. Next time I'll use the sparkling apple cider.

The dough is great combination.  The only trouble I had was getting the fritters flat enough so the dough cooks throughout.

This recipe was so easy and really good. I made a few ingredient alterations because I used gala (3) apples and they did have excess moisture. I just added it to the sparkling cider. I also didn't ice them, they are sweet enough as is.

Easy to make. I added a bit more cinnamon to everything as I prefer my apple fritters to be more, well, cinnamony. My son wants less apple but I found the portion of apples to be fine. I liked that the apples weren't crunchy. I did find it hard to keep it together in the deep fryer but I'm sure that is more my technique I will make this again.

My only change was to add an extra pat of butter to the apples while cooking.  I almost subbed plain apple cider for the sparkling cider, but I'm glad I didn't. The sparkling stuff added a little extra to the taste. They were delicious and easy, and we'll definitely make them again.

Followed the recipe as written.  Didnâ€™t have sparkling cider, but had sparkling white grape juice.  Outstanding!   I was really upset to see that someone gave a low rating because they couldnâ€™t read the recipe.  Nowhere does this recipe call for vinegar!

Everything about this is perfect. The one thing thatâ€™s been tough on a stovetop is regulating the temperature of the oil during frying. Iâ€™ll try it again in an electric skillet to try for more consistency in cooking. After the first batch, I was asked to make another a few days later because they were gone so quickly. Definitely worth the time and effort!

These apple fritters turned out great! I have never had apple fritters before but they looked fun to make so I made them. I loved the cooked apples and the sparkling cider (especially drinking it afterwards!) I want to thank Chef John for making the changes to the traditional apple fritter recipe and having me have such good apple fritters!

This turned out wonderful! I had to substitute red mills gluten free flour and coconut flour b/c of food sensitivities. They turned out great! Didnt rise but only b/c of the flour I used but they fried up wonderfully! My boys loved them! Definitely a great treat esp for someone who misses fried donuts and fritters!

I did this for an Indian Festival (Diwali) and it turned out fantastic! Everyone loved it. I followed the recipe except  that I replaced the egg with an egg replacer. I will definitely make this again. Thanks Chef John

Only change, I used regular cider instead of sparkling cider. Very easy to do and got several compliments on them. Oh, I did not bother to peel my apples. They were diced tiny and cooked. The peels gave us extra fiber and saved time.

It was surprisingly easy to make, and very good! The only thing that I didn't like was that the glaze had too much cinnamon in it. There was no measurement for it listed. I may have added too much cinnamon to it. Other than that, it was very good. It is a hit in my house.

For much of my 86 years I have enjoyed apple fritters from shops all over the US and Canada as well as England and Australia.  They have ranged from "So-so" to "Delightful".  This recipe produced a fritter that failed in its struggle to reach "So-so".  The cider vinegar should not have been used.

Followed the directions carefully but I wasn't pleased with the texture. I was hoping they had a firmer 'shell'.  In order to make the glaze thicker and whiter I found it necessary to use a lot more powdered sugar. Not sure what I did wrong or how I could make these again and have them be much crisper. Open to ideas!

used allspice in place of nutmeg turned out so good I did it again.  Fried in cast iron, use thermometer to be sure you have the right temp!

Soooo good! I decided to make these last minute but didn't have fresh apples, I used pie filling instead added a little more honey cinnamon to that. Followed the recipe exact besides the apples and my husband LOVED them! Will make them for our next family event, sure to be a hit!

Were really good and not too complicated. This was my first time making them, and, while they didn't look exactly like the picture, they still turned out really tasty; I'll definitely make them again.

Never made fritters before and I think this recipe turned out pretty darn well.  I almost burned my mouth tasting the first batch.  I just couldn't wait  and I wasn't disappointed!  I subbed ginger ale for the cider because that's what I had on hand and used it in the glaze!  Hoping they freeze well, no way I can eat 9 of these!  Chef John, keep'm coming!

I have made this twice for my family and they are a hit. Only change is I did not use sparkling ciders replaced with water.

The apple fritters had a little bit of taste, but still ok for me.
