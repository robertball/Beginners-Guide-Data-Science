This was delicious!  My local grocery stores carry sun-dried tomato pesto in the deli and in the pasta sauce aisle (Classico makes a good one) so check both places in case you have trouble locating it.  My husband loved this, I loved this, and the friends I made it for also loved it--you really can't go wrong!  Next time, I'll use chicken instead of steak, but this is a recipe I'll make many more times in the future.  Thanks!

Wow, where did this come from?!?  Sun-dried tomato pesto? Strangely, I could only find it at Target. What a surprise! The mix of ingredients was heavenly! FLAT IRON STEAK WAS PERFECT...LESS PREP TOO. I DID CUT BACK THE OIL A BIT.  Gimme more from this chef!  THIS PICTURE DOES NOT REALLY LOOK LIKE THE DISH....AND THE SPINACH IS NOT PART OF A "SAUCE" it's part of the dish.  i used the whole grain penne and LOVED it.

I could not find sun-dried tomato pesto at the store so I made my own with a combination of minced sun-dried tomatoes and pesto paste.  Not as good as the real thing I am sure but still very tasty!

Made a few changes:  Used NY Strip steaks instead of rib-eye (delicious!), sauteed the spinach in garlic and olive oil before adding to pasta.  Omitted olives, added chopped onion and portabella mushroom to the steak instead of shallots.  Used fresh grated parmesan cheese instead of feta.  Definitely more of an italian taste than greek, but was very delicious!  Much lighter than I had expected.  I will make this again and keep experimenting.

This was amazing--I was nervous about using sun-dried tomato pesto (we've never tried it) but it gave such a rich depth to the steak. When my husband came in he said it smelled like a restaurant. It was fun to make and unbelievably good with simple ingredients. I left out the olives and used asiago, romano & parmesan cheese instead of the feta, but I want to try it with feta. I had a bagged salad I needed to use, so I served the pasta/steak mixture on a bed of greens and it was so good, even down to the crunch of the sunflower seeds. Fantastic recipe Jennifer!

I couldn't find the pesto, so I used julienned sundried tomatoes and just chopped them up finely. I also added more feta and seasoned the steak with salt, pepper, and Greek Seasoning (Penzeys.com). Wasn't in the mood for pasta, so tossed the meat into spinach leaves, chopped fresh tomato, cucumber, and pepperoncinis for a great warm salad (added a little red wine vinegar). Next time I'll use kalamata olives for more flavor.  Will be making this again!

This is so good. I have made this twice already and love it! I leave out the black olives, but that is personal preference. Also, the only sun-dried tomato pesto I could find (after searching 3 supermarkets) is made by Classico. The jar is small, about half the size of typical spaghetti sauces, and will probably be on the top shelf. The pesto is amazing, making the dish to die for! Highly recommended...

Yummy!! I didn't have spinach on hand, but I'm so excited to try this again when I do have it.  Also, I didn't have feta cheese but I substituted monterey jack, cubed small.  Wonderful!

I love this recipe.  I have made this multiple times, and the key is to find a really good sun dried tomato pesto.

We really liked this.  I found the sundried-tomato pesto at Trader Joe's.  I used sirloin steak and herbed feta.  I like how this recipe called for whole wheat pasta.  I used Trader Joe's whole wheat flax pasta.  This recipe does not taste like "steak spaghetti", as one reviewer put it.  I guess some people don't appreciate a good dish for what it is.  This was full of flavor and I can't wait for the leftovers!

I made this today & it was absolutely DELICIOUS! I used 16 oz of Penne instead of 8 oz & I used NY Strip Steak since it has less fat (and it was on sale). I will most definitely make this again, HUGE hit. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!!!

This recipe gave me an excellent base for a pasta salad even my husband loved. I used alot of feta, no olives and plenty of thinly sliced red peppers. I took this to a low country boil (I am not a fan of shrimp) and it was gobbled up pretty fast.

Really good recipe, nice change from conventional pasta dinner.  I have made the recipe twice... do not use cheap meat!  First time I used New York Strip and it was great, the second time I used some cheap sirloin that I had in the freezer and it was really chewy.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find sundried tomato pesto in my town. I could have made my own, but instead subbed what I could find at the store which was a tomato bruschetta spread. It was good, but I think the intensity of sundried tomatoes would have added a lot.  That aside, we still loved it.  The taste of the ribeye was great with all of the accompanying flavors.  Wasn't sure if it was calling for dry or fresh basil, so I used about 1T of fresh basil since I had it on hand.  Did everything else as recipe calls for.  Thanks so much, Jennifer!

This was an excellent and quick dish. I did not include the spinach (it's not available right now) or the black olives. The longer the sauce was on the pasta, the better the flavor.

This dish was great! Being a busy single father, I am always looking for something simple, quick, delicious and different to eat. My 8 year old put this dish on the same level as Chicken Mc Nuggets! Cant get much better then that.

A real winner and the men loved this dish. A top sirloin steak worked wonderfully with this recipe. The guys only complaint was I didn't make enough, but it was just fine for four people. You can easily add in more spinach and black olives, and mushrooms are a great addition too (I had four portabellos that needed to be used, so threw them in the mix). I used Classico sun-dried tomato pesto, found next to all the spaghetti sauces in the grocery store. I'm surely making this one again, really was an easy summer meal.

Wow! This was great! I doubled it for my family of 5, because the recipe says it makes 4 servings. No need - as written it makes way more than 4 servings. My husband and I both LOVED this. The kids didn't like it as much, but one kid doesn't like olives or spinach, one doesn't like steak (actually fat, and I used a well marbled rib-eye)and two didn't like the sunflower seeds. I wouldn't change a thing for my tastes!

This was only OK for us.  I didn't make the steak portion of it and I'm glad I didn't go to the trouble.  I think the type of sun-dried tomato pesto used could make all the difference and maybe making one from scratch might make all the difference.  Probably will not make again.

This was great!  Don't skimp on the pesto.  It takes the full amount to add the right amount of flavor.

The flavor was ok--if you are looking for steak spaghetti. I was very excited to try a new dish, but to me, this was another variation of spaghetti, and I don't even like spaghetti.
Won't be making this one again.

I've made this multiple times now, and even make 6 batches of the marinated steak at once to put in the freezer and have ready for a super-quick weeknight meal. I've used tri-tip steak and flank steak both, which I marinated in "Best Steak Marinade in Existence" (also found on All Recipes) and grilled. This marinade is a PERFECT complement of flavors to this dish. Otherwise, followed the recipe and it is amazing! One of our favorite summer dishes!

Made this recipe exactly as written and would't change a thing! The sunflower seeds added a delicious crunch and all the ingredients just blended for a wonderful taste treat! Hard to stop eating it! Thanks, Jen!

Delicious and nutritious! I had trouble finding the sun dried tomato pesto, but finally located it next to the jars of spaghetti sauce. The fresh basil was a wonderful accent flavor.

This was excellent!  I couldnt find sun-dried tomato pesto, so I bought regular pesto and added some diced sun-dried tomatoes to it.  
The only complaint I have is that it is a bit to oil-ly.  I think next time I make it, i will use just a touch of olive oil to the noodles instead of the recommened.  I think there is enough oil in the pesto to maintain moisture.  
Other that that... A Wonderful Dish!!!
Thanks for submitting it!

I've made this twice now. My husband and I really enjoy it. I never had the sunflower seeds and I don't really think the recipe needs it. I added pine nuts the second time, but I don't think that was necessary either. One note, the leftovers as not as good as when it's made fresh, but that might be because I microwave it. I'll have to try eating it leftover cold. All in all, great recipe!

We thought this was very good.  ALthough next time I will make it vegetarian and omit the beef. I added extra spinach -  about 2/3 of a 10oz bag.  Also, only used 6 oz. of pasta instead of 8.  Came out very good!  Thanks for the recipe.  Will make again.

This is delicious.  The only change I made was substituting roasted pine nuts for the sunflower seeds.  My whole family loved it, and it was even better the next day.

This pasta salad is wonderful.  I did however make a few changes.  I used chicken in place of the steak and scallions in place of the shallots.  Also added a little red pepper flake in at the end and left out the sunflower seeds as well.  Made it for some friends and all of them loved it.  A great dish for picnics and family gatherings too.  Great warm, room temperature or served cold.

This is excellent.  I made it a little before I was actually serving so teh pasta could soak up the sauce flavor.  No shallots, so I used a little mild onion.  I also substituted parsley adn basil for a little jared pesto, same brand as the tomato pesto.

Loved, loved, loved this!  I omitted the black olives because my husband does not like them and the sunflower kernels because I didn't have any in my pantry.  I grilled steak on the side and used the pasta as a side dish.  The flavors of the sundried tomato, spinach, and feta worked perfectly together.  This was a big winner in my house and I will definitely be adding this to my recipe book.

It was surprisingly good. It was also quite easy to prepare. I don't think that it was necessarily something that I would've come up with on my own, either. So, it was a nice surprise.

Excellent. I'm not a big fan of sundried tomato so I used regular pesto. I also increased the garlic to a tablespoon. I will likely add more spinach next time. Thank you for sharing!

Very good!  I didn't have some ingredients, like the spinach and olives, so I just left them out.  I had already cooked steak, so I warmed it up in a pan with some olive oil and garlic, then tossed in the soy sauce.  This was perfect to use up leftover goat cheese and steak in the fridge, and I thought it was a very tasty steak pasta.  I made my own pesto with the Sun-Dried Tomato Pesto Recipe from here, which worked perfectly using half of the recipe for this pasta.  Despite the long ingredient list and making homemade pesto, this was a very quick lunch--I had it on the table in less than 30 minutes today.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this  as written and it was fantastic. It was to die for the second time I made it. Omitted the block olives, used parmesean and toasted pine nuts instead of the feta and sunflower seeds. Amaaaazing!

One of our favs! Found this on here as the featured recipe of the day and was so glad I did. I've made it with the steak and chicken before which works too. I omit the olives and sunflower kernels to suit our taste, but otherwise works as is. Super tasty and quick and easy!

A good recipe, but way too oily.  I made a large batch for leftovers and got sick of it quick for this reason.  With half the oil/butter I think it'd be excellent.

This was excellent!  I will say a few things that would make it better.  1) I did not use whole wheat penne, and the dish turned out fine, however...  2) ...As much as I love an excuse to put steak on things, since I used regular penne, this dish would be better with chicken.  Without the whole wheat pasta the steak is just a bit too powerful for the delicate flavors of the pesto and herbs.  I can see the steak working nicely with the recommended pasta though--if I use whole wheat pasta, I'll go with the steak, but from now on when I use "normal" penne, I'll use chicken instead.  3) Lemon, lemon zest, or a splash of white wine.  It feels like it needs the acidity.  I might try playing with this next go.  4) I'll either make my own sun-dried tomato pesto or buy a different brand.   This dish gets a good bit of its flavor from the pesto and I was not that impressed with the brand I picked--it was too oily.  5) Speaking of sun-dried tomato pesto, our grocery store has them (and most of their sun dried tomato) in the produce department, not in the isles where you might expect.  I do think a traditional pesto would work well though, and might give that a shot next time around.  6) Like others, I used pitted Kalamata olives--straight black olives wouldn't add enough punch.  Otherwise, I can't think of much I'd change besides the name--it isn't really a salad but a pasta dish :-)

a 4.5*.....used a N.Y. Striploin - well aged. Accidently forgot the basil and parsley. EXTREMELY flavorful dish - loved it. Strongly recommended for steak salad lovers.

Oh my gosh, I just finished eating this for dinner and I'm soooo full cause I couldn't stop eating it, really delicious!  The only thing I omitted was the seeds cause I don't usually have them on hand and I didn't feel like buying them for one meal. But I don't feel they were missed at all. This dish is so flavorful and I love the tangy combo of the sundried tomato pesto(which I found at Trader Joes in the refridgerated section with the gourmet cheeses) and the feta...yummy! I used some leftover bbq'd top sirloin, but I think it would be great chicken too.

This was really good, though I did make a few changes.  I got rid of the olive oil altogether, quickly spraying the noodles with a little olive oil cooking spray to keep them from sticking together.  The sundried tomato pesto provided quite enough oil on its own, so it wasn't missed.  I also subbed Smart Balance for the butter to lower the calorie content.  Because we don't eat wheat, I used rice flour penne, and I used pine nuts toasted in the toaster oven for a few minutes instead of sunflower seeds.  I also used Kalamata olives because I'm allergic to black olives.  While it tasted fine at this point, it still wasn't quite right.  I added half a teaspoon of salt and a dash of cayenne pepper, as well as three-fourths a cup sliced grape tomatoes and a fourth-cup golden raisins.  Another reviewer suggested adding a splash of basalmic vinegar, and this proved to be the key.  I'm serving it for dinner tonight and will be surprised if there are any leftovers!

I had never heard of sun dried tomato pesto, but it works well for this recipe. I used pine nuts instead of sunflower seeds as it seemed "more Greek" to me. My family really enjoyed this- gave it 4 stars. I felt it was more like 3.

This was really great - I used leftover steak, and skipped the initial cooking step for that reason, but otherwise followed the recipe. I didn't have pesto, so I used the pesto with arugula recipe on this website, and added sundried tomatoes to it. This made a great dinner and two great lunches! I also think this will be a recipe that I can play with as far as ingredients. I will make this many times this summer for sure.

excellen!  We love pasta and we love steak in our family.  This is a great blend of both.  I love to cook, but don't have the time.  This is easy but tastes like I spent the time.  Even my very picky teenager eats this, (she picks out the olives).

This dish is great! Great taste, great texture. I've even tried it with ground beef for a cheaper alternative and I love the way it blends together. Sometimes I use green onions and sometimes I use sweet onions. I also like to sprinkle Parmesan on the top. Yum!

This would also be good without the steak.  I really don't think it added to the flavor.

This recipe is soo good and even a novice like me can make it! Tastes great as a warm pasta dish, room temperature or even cold as as pasta salad. Make it with filet, instead of rib eye, instead of for really spectaculor flavor!

Tastes great as-is. Did not change a thing. No trouble finding tomato pesto @ Kroger. Found this looking for something to do with left over steak. Like the idea of doubling the pasta for next time. There will be a next time!

First time made this with what I had on hand, used bowtie pasta and didn't have the sunflower kernels, and it didn't matter---I still made a fantastic salad that between the competing taste flashes of fresh spinach / basil, pesto, Feta cheese and finely tender marinated steak  presented a traditional Greek taste. Many thanks and kudos to "Polo" for offering this easy salad idea.  My toughest food critic ( the wife--who HARDLY EVER compliments my cooking efforts ) raved enjoying this recipe; it's a keeper....and I guess the wife is too.

This recipe is so good!  Especially easy with left over steak!!  Followed the recipe accept for  using the same cut of beef; we needed to use up leftovers.  We had a gourmet tasting meal in no time!  Really was fast to prepare, was nice to slow down after making it and really enjoy this meal.  Thanks for sharing.  This is a keeper and I want to make it again soon!!!

I used regular penne, and didn't include the seeds, but I didn't enjoy this at all. Way too many flavour combinations, and in my opinion it just doesn't work.

This dish was delicious. I made with split chicken breast baked in the oven until almost done and then torn up and sauteed with soy sauce and pan drippings.  I added spinach to the garlic and shallots and then added more spinach when the dish was completed.  My son loved it.  I would like to try with steak next time, but you can definitely keep it inexpensive and have great dish with chicken!

Great recipe!  I made a several modifications: I eliminated the soy sauce, used basil pesto instead of sun-dried tomato, substituted Kalamata olives for black, goat cheese for feta and toasted pine nuts for sunflower kernels.
I also upped the spinach to 2 cups, fresh basil to 1/4+ cup and added 2-3 chopped Roma tomatoes.   A family favorite!

Very good recipe ,only thing I did differently was add extra boursin cheese and used 24oz of quinoa penne because there was a lot of sauce for just 8oz of pasta in this recipe.

Omg! This was so good and tastey. My whole family loved it. I didn't add the scallops or the sunflower kernels, not my taste. I'm not a steak eater so this was a great way to mix up the same old boring steak dinners. This recipe will be a staple in our home for now on. You absolutely have to try it!

I can no longer find progresso's tomato pesto so now I use marzetti's tomato pesto and Kirkland 's basil pesto together. Kirklands pesto is very tasty and goes nicely with this recipe.

My family LOVED this salad.  Even my cousin's 5 and 2 year olds enjoyed it.  I was a little torn on which tomato pesto to buy - get a jarred pesto that looks like it has a lot of oil in it.  Don't drain it.  Also, instead of black olives, I bought Greek kalamata olives and sliced them in half.

A quick, easy meal that looks a little better than it tastes. It's quite good, but needs a little something to give it more bite.

My husband and I loved this salad.  I didn't use the olive oil, but other than that, I made the salad as written.  This is something I would serve to dinner guest along with a Greek salad.

Excellent! Made this as close to the recipe as I could, but without the Sun-dried tomato pesto that I couldn't find; had to get next closest thing. Tasted great and it was easy to follow. Thanks, I will be making this again.
