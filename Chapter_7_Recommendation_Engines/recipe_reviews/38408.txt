I have been making this for 40 years.  Not quite the same recipe however. I use one can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh...oregano instead of basil...and FRESH parmesan cheese.  People who dislike squash love this (if you can get them to taste with an open mind)  :o)   Jerri

This an excellent recipe.  One point though, be careful not to over cook or vegatables will become soggy.

This recipe is fabulous!  I added a splash of balsalmic vinegar when adding the tomatoes and it added a yummy contrast to the blue cheese and some nice color contrast for an attractive dish.  MMMMM!!!  My family loved this one.

Great recipe.  I made some modifications.  First of all, I did not use the bacon at all.  For frying I used olive oil.  I used yellow onions, minced garlic (lots), a dash of balsamic vinegar, and added ripe olives.  I used feta cheese instead of blue cheese.

I really liked this. I made a couple of changes based upon what was in the fridge. I used fresh basil instead dried, turkey bacon and ff feta cheese instead of blue. I did think it needed a bit more taste at the end, so I added a dash of tabasco and a little garlic salt. I can't wait to try this with the blue cheese next time.

This is a delicious recipe! Great way to use local fresh veggies. I made as written other than subbing parm for the blue cheese at the end. Another reviewer suggested adding a splash of balsamic vinegar. I'll think that would go great in this so I will try it next time.

I needed a great recipe after my neighbor gifted me a huge zucchini.  First of all, my husband hates zucchini.  I normally just grill it with EVOO, salt, and pepper (then I eat most of it and beg him to eat one slice).  Somehow adding bacon and bleu cheese changed EVERYTHING.  We've had this dish twice in one week.  It's super fast, easy, and I am literally picking the basil and tomatoes straight from the garden prior to preparation. EASY! Many reviewers have stated their use of feta instead of bleu cheese, but I think the bleu cheese ties the dish together with just enough tang to delight the palate.  I followed the recipe except for adding an extra piece of bacon and fresh versus dried basil.  Definitely a keep and repeat.  Does anyone have suggestions for making this a complete meal?  Maybe adding beans or another protein?  Thanks!

Very bland and watery.  Not enough seasoning or flavor. Good idea, but needs a lot of expanding.

Wow, we loved this recipe! In fact, it's probably one of my favorite ones off of this site. My extremely picky, veggie-hating son even ate this one right up. Thank you for posting this wonderful, healthy dish, Douggee! Will definitely make again.

So simple and still so delicious! I'm counting calories and this was just what I needed to fill up without going overboard! I did use a basil tomato flavored feta cheese which just added to the delicious!

Nice! I totally spaced out on the basil, but it was really good anyway. I used feta instead of blue cheese because it went better with what we were having tonight. Thanks!

This was really great. My boyfriend and I are trying to eat more vegetables and this was a big hit! I did  add a bit of olive oil because the pan seemed dry, most likely because I used turkey bacon. I also added a bit of garlic salt. Will definately do again.

We love zucchini and this recipe made us love it even more.  Like one other reviewer suggested, I put it a dash of balsamic vinegar and it was absolutely perfect.  Thanks so much for a great recipe.

A wonderful and easy side dish.  I served this with grilled steak.  I did use Feta instead of blue cheese which was just a personal choice.  It was really delicious and I highly recommend this recipe.

The small amount of bacon really gave the zucchini a lot of flavor. I used fresh basil and added some fresh parsley. Great for all those zucchinis that won't stop growing!

i thought this recipe tasted better than i anticipated and my husband, who doesn't usually eat his veggies had seconds of this! i didn't have bacon but i used bacon grease to cook the veggies in and i used white onion instead of red because i was out of that too. it still came out yummy enough that I'll make it again!

This was really good! I had a couple extra slices of bacon to use up so I just doubled the bacon - there was plenty of zucchini so the amount seemed right for how much we had.  The only thing I'd do different next time is drain some of the liquid the vegetables release before adding the seasoning & tomatoes next time. There'll still be some liquid but not as much as we had - seemed to steam/ boil some of the squash because of it. DH cooked this for me while I prepared the rest of the meal and I didn't realize the liquid issue until everything else was added.  The flavor was great though - great way to use up some zucchini!
