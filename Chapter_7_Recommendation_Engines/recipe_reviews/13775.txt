This soup is wonderful.  I left out the butter, as suggested by another member and added a little olive oil.   I would suggest adding more garlic, I love garlic and feel the recipe needs more.  Otherwise this is fantastic!  I will make it again!

Okay, I have made this soup about 5 times.  This last time was the best!  I used baby carrots and omitted all butter and oil.  I doubled the garlic and used chicken broth powder.  It was AMAZING!  also, try sprinkling chives ontop, yum!!!

This is heavy on the butter but you can cut back. Great if you like dill. Do not make if you do not like dill. This is a GREAT recipe to use up lots of carrots that are getting old in your fridge.

Very delicious. Loved the garlic-y taste. Added very little butter but you could easily leave it out completely to reduce the fat content. I added fresh dill as well and it was fabulous. Will make for my Christmas company.

This is excellent!  It tastes wonderful, I can't wait for my husband to come home and try it.  I feel like it might be missing one small thing, but I can't put my finger on it.  Until then, I'm going to have a little more with some bread & butter.  Maybe I'll make this for Thanksgiving for a change of pace!
UPDATE: 1/23/07 - Made it again.  This time the hubby made a suggestion to add a little milk to the pot.  Wow!  That had to be what I was missing before.  Mmmmmm!

EASY AND GOOD!  I put all the ingredients except the butter in the crockpot and cooked it all day on low. Blended it up and cooked it on high for another 2 hours- added the butter at this time- ALL of it. I also added two ears of corn- cut off the cob and 2 bay leaves.  Blended the corn right up with the carrots.  I thought this soup was FANTASTIC.  Oh- I used 6 cups of veggie stock instead of the chicken.

I expected a sweet mellow taste.  This was very bitter!!  Would not waste all the time or ingredients in making it again!  I followed the recipe to a "T"....even tried adding some cheese later on!  It just got worse!

I'm sorry, I did not like this.  I love all the ingredients, nothing strange on the list.  But the overall flavour was not pleasant to me.  Maybe if my carrots were sweeter?  I might try it again without the garlic.

Easy to make, could use less butter to make it lighter. I added one extra clove of garlic.

This soup tastes so good I can't believe it has no cream in it.  I use closer to 5 pounds of carrots, vegetable stock instead of chicken, double the garlic and half the butter and it comes out amazingly smooth and creamy every time. Note - you MUST puree this soup with a blender.  The hand held soup mixer does NOT get the right consistency and it will not taste right otherwise.  This is one of my favorite recipes, so easy and delicious. Great for a dinner party.

Don't blame the bitterness on the recipe!  YOU didn't buy the right carrots. I've found organic carrots from the  local Coop to be much sweeter when I juice, steam for a veggie dish at night or make soup with. You do have to ALWAYS peel the carrots.  Hope this helps!

Fantastic! I have made this soup several times now doubling it as well, because it freezes wonderfully. As suggested by others, I use only 2 Tbsps. of butter but I also use 2 Tbsps. olive oil.  I also brown the carrots and garlic first-we like that 'roasted' flavour.

EMERGENCY TIP: This soup smells so delicious and I have pureed many other hot soups before; however when I went to puree this carrot mix it exploded out of my blender. 
   Even with my hand holding over the top of my blender, like I always do as a precautionary measure, the hot carrot may have had a chemical buildup which pushed the top off my blender TWO TIMES! Resulting in hot puree all over myself & my boyfriend (ouch!) as well as our kitcken. Although not mentioned in the recipe, I definetley recommend to allow the carrots to cool for a while before attempting to puree and reheat.

Was good but a bit bland so I added an 8 oz block of reduced fat cream cheese (everything's better with cream cheese!), a fairly large pinch of cayenne and a big splash of soy sauce for a little "umami"

Loved this soup!  I did add some milk to thin it a little and make it a little creamier.  I garnished it with a ball of cream cheese mixed with dill and a little salt, and my family raved.  I will most certainly make this again.

This is a nice soup. I did not add any butter. I added two tablespoons of sour cream. I also did not add dill. I did add 1/2 cup chopped white onion. I blended the onion and carrots into the puree. It has a great flavor,. and it is not bad to look at. Will make this one again

This was far more flavorful than I expected it to be! I had some carrots that were going to go bad if I didn't use them, so after a quick allrecipes search I settled on this recipe. It is delicious! The ingredients are so simple, but the flavors are so good. Great recipe! 

Note: I used an immersion blender right in the stock pot and had a smooth result, so I recommend that rather than the blender transfer to puree.

YUM! I used black pepper and curry powder to season instead of dill weed, since I didn't have any. It came out GREAT! So creamy without any cream or flour, so lactose and gluten free to boot!

Easy and "ok" just ok; probably would have benefitted from some cayenne or curry or both.  As it stands rather bland and sweet.

I left out the butter, and was a wee bit hesitant at the amount of dill but wow is this soup ever fantastic!  I used garden carrots, and the homemade chicken broth recipe from this site (Taste of Home test kitchen)... will definitely be making this soup time and time again... next time I will be doubling the recipe!

This soup was amazing! My little kids loved it. We served it with honey cornbread. So easy and the family loved it. I had to use beef broth bc it's all I had and it was still great.

Delicious and easy!  I initially used less butter; after I pureed the soup, I added a bit more butter to taste to make sure it was not overwhelmingly buttery.. just perfect!

This was a very nice soup - I originally found it very slightly modified on another website, but then found it here on Allrecipes. I made the Allrecipes version exactly as written, opting to cook for the shorter of the "30 to 45 minutes" at the end.
For just a few ingredients, it has a nice texture and subtle flavors besides the dominant carrot flavor. I think the large amount of butter is a good substitute for the usual milk or cream in this kind of soup. I did find it a bit thick, though, but perhaps I should have pureed the soup longer. The serving size of 6 is about right - this made 5 fairly-large bowls for lunch for me. I enjoyed it and just may make it again soon!

Because I used a hand blender, I blended at the end of the time instead of the middle (so the carrots would be softer). Definitely a great recipe for using up carrots that are getting a little on the old side.

Super easy and perfect! Just got a ninja from my daughter so we needed a recipe to try it out. I added a little less butter than called for and a little extra garlic. I also added red pepper flakes for a kick. We both ate two bowls! And...like other reviewers said, it’s a great way to use up that 10 pound bag of carrots before they go bad!

a quick and easy soup to make, especially with the carrots no one will eat cuz they don't look "good" but still are.  I agree with one reviewer the taste was a little off, so when i made it a second time, I sauted the garlic with onions to an almost carmalized stage and then added the carrots and cooked them for 5 minutes in the onion and garlic mixture.  I used a splash of olive oil to do this.  I also added the salt at this stage to draw out the flavours.  I added the broth and let it cook.  Then added the dill after blending.  It was still a bit meh, so I squeezed lemon juice in.  That made a huge difference.  Next time I will zest the lemon and add that during the cooking faze.

Followed the recipe as written.  I love dill, so I used the full 2tbsp as directed, even though it seemed like a lot of dill.  The soup is good, but dill was definitely the overwhelming flavor - I couldn't really taste the carrots.  I've never had carrot soup before, so I have nothing to compare it too.  I'll try other carrot soup recipes from this recipes so that I have a point of reference next time.  Thanks for the recipe Joan.

I added a teaspoon of fresh chopped thyme in place of the dill and did not use butter.  I softened the onions and carrots in 2 tbsp olive oil.  I agree with the reviewer who said to use only organic carrots.  They are definitely sweeter.

Made this per the recipe-it was good, but like a few other reviewers, thought it was missing something. I added (1/2 c) milk as another reviewer's husband suggested, and it was really good! Will make this again. The butter in the recipe does make it rich, but I'm a butter lover!

I make my own broth and garlic is included in that. I also used fresh dill. I put a whole clump in the soup and removed it before I blended the soup. I also omitted the salt as the butter was salted. I LOVED this soup! So easy too!

I wanted to half this recipe as I live alone, but I didn't have enuff carrots so to make up for the lack I added onions and red peppers.  First I roasted the veggies with garlic in olive oil and then pureed with the broth, butter, and seasoning.  I garnished with seasoned croutons - really bold flavours!  Nice with red wine.

Simple and delicious. I added an extra clove of garlic and more water to thin it out as it simmered. I don't think I've ever cooked with dill before and it's wonderful.

For how simple this recipe is, its pretty good. Definitely use less salt, or sea salt because lower sodium broth is still packed with it. I cooked it in half the time as well, because I like the strong carrot flavor and wanted to salvage nutrients.

I used chicken broth in place of the stock  which I added an extra 1/2 cup because the soup was very thick. I also added an extra teaspoon of dill. Was very happy with this soup & will definitely make it again.

I took the advice of others and added more garlic but still felt it needed a kick, so  I added 2tbls of honey and 4 dashes of Tabasco sauce for sweet hot flavor that provided the kick I was looking for.

Wow this soup is amazing. I was not expecting it to be delicious actually (just healthy). I had lots of carrots in my fridge that I didn’t want to go bad so I looked up carrot recipes. I had all the ingredients. I made the recipe as written. While it was cooking it smelled amazing.

Great and easy recipe! I added celery and onion for a little more veg. I used a blend of chicken and veggie stocks along with a spoonful of the roast chicken better than bullion. Added garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, more salt, and white pepper. served in bowls with a garnish of a dollop of non-fat Greek yogurt (or you could use sour cream or creme fraiche) and fresh dill. The soup was delicious! Will definitely make this again!

I did not expect to like this, but it is ridiculously addictive ! I made a half recipe but with the full 3 of garlic. I'm already planning to make another pot as soon as I get home again. Who knew carrot soup was not only a thing, but a very good thing?

I made it exactly as the recipe was written, using dried dill from my garden and freshly pulled carrots from my garden. I took the suggestion and made sure they were peeled. Can't wait to see how it freezes and thaws bc I would love to make more.

Delicious!! I made it as is other than adding a little bit more salt. I made it for my kids since they love carrots. I don't really love carrots but I really do like the soup! I'm converting to becoming a vegan so next time I won't use the butter but I may use coconut butter or olive oil.

I just made this & it is so good!  I followed the advice of other reviewers & used less butter & only added about a tablespoon.  The soup was too thick for my liking so I added two more cups of stock & it was perfect.  I used chicken stock because it was what I had.  I added double the garlic as my family & I love garlic.  I will definitely make this again!

It turned out real nice. Though my mother and I aren't fans of dried dill. So what I did what replace the dried dill with two tablespoons of lemon pepper, and a few sakes of ground mustard in its place. That made it taste much better.

Made following recipe and reviews; I did use organice vegan base instead of chicken, baby carrots, no butter, and just a bit of coconut milk. Oh and extra garlic (personal preferance) as this recipe is added to my Kick Cancer Cooking rotation as I care for a sick person and continue to keep myself C-free. Thank you for the awesome base recipe.

The original recipe looked a bit bland to me. I omitted the butter and used 1tbs. OO to saute 6 chopped garlic cloves, and 1/2 cup diced onions. I also dropped in 1 whole habanero pepper for some extra kick. I substituted 1 cup almond milk for 1 cup of water (chicken broth), and followed the rest of the recipe. I served it with thinly sliced green onion as a topper. Pretty good. Not great. Very healthy!

I used only 2 1/2 lbs. of carrots so I adjusted all other ingredient amounts to correspond with the amount of carrots.  I did add lots of garlic,  as garlic gives delicious flavour.  I left out the butter, and added some milk.  I think the trick is to taste the soup as you go along and add more or less of what you like.  Savory recipes are usually just guidelines, so make it to suit yourself.  I blended it well,  until it was smooth and creamy.

This soup is one of my favorites, as is. I have made it many times. My recent modifications have been to use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, and I add a bit of cooking sherry.

Kid approved! I made a couple of slight changes...I used a couple tablespoons of butter to sauté 1 chopped onion, double the garlic, and dill. Once the onions were soft, I added the carrots, salt, and broth/stock. Boiled until the carrots were soft & then pureed the whole thing. I did not return it to the stove to cook any longer. Kids loved it, and I did too. Would be great w/croutons.

Wonderful recipe to get you started. Used a semi-home made chicken broth, cut back on the butter, and added green onion, ginger, lemon juice, habanero hot sauce, a little heavy cream and a tsp of sour cream for serving, plus a few herbs and spices. Oh so good!!

I ended up really liking the soup after a few tweaks.  First, I cut the butter down to about 2 Tablespoons, used vegetable broth instead of chicken and added a small amount of nutmeg plus a dash of cayenne pepper.  I also added about 1 packet of Truvia because my carrots were not very sweet.  Additionally, I thinned it down with unsweetened Almond Milk.  It had a kick, but we really enjoyed it.  I will definitely make this again.

Amazingly yummy soup. I swapped out the butter with margarine and reduced the quantity by half; and I doubled the garlic.  I let the soup simmer for a while until dinner was ready and the carrots get even sweeter as the soup breaks down. The flavours are incredible, I could eat this soup all day.

I used a small amount of coconut oil instead of butter and added some sauteed onions. I also left out the dill as I'm not a big fan of it. This is such a tasty recipe!

So easy and so delicious! I love this soup! I make a big batch and freeze individual portions for a quick lunch during the week. I add an onion because I like the flavor it gives and I'm a garlic lover so I bump that up a bit.

This was a great soup! Will definitely be making it again. Silly me, I forgot I was halving the recipe after putting in half the carrots and stock, giving it effectively double the butter, salt, dill, and garlic that it should've had. Was pretty potent but still delicious. It'll be even better next time when I pay better attention. And the smell as it's simmering ... mmmmmmm.

I was looking for a simple carrot soup - this for the bill perfectly. I used half the amount of dill, added 1 tbsp fresh ginger, and eliminated the butter. Usually I try not to make so many changes, but I had to go with what was in the pantry. This was a perfect low cal, low fat dinner for one.

So, so, good and simplistic.  I used reserved carrot water in place of broth, just because broth is hard on my system.

I halved the butter, left out the dill weed, added a little more garlic and also added 1/4 cup of heavy cream at the end. This is delicious!

This is delicious! My husband chose for me to not purée do that it seemed more "hearty" but either way would be yummy. I added about a quarter of a cup of finely chopped onion and only used only a quarter cup of butter as well. Will most definitely be making this again!

We didn't care for this soup at all.  Followed the recipe exactly but it was a bit bitter and desperately needed something added to brighten the flavor.  The dill was very prominent;  maybe doubling the garlic might have helped.

Fantastic! I added in a bit of ginger, and about a teaspoon of yellow curry powder, cutting the dill out. This time, i tried using a savory, carrot curry tea as the base instead of chicken stock. SO YUMMY.

This was great!!  After reading some of the reviews, I used half of the butter and dill but I did add some black and white pepper and a dash of Goya Adobo all purpose seasoning. It was even better the next day.  This is definitely a remake!

Pretty good. Mine tasted a little flat at first and I added more garlic (can't really taste it and i added 5 gloves) and about a little less than 1/4 of butter (80/20 kind), but then I added some lemon juice (to taste) and I found it really picked up the flavor a lot, just needed that bit of zip is all. Next time I'm going to add Greek yogurt to see if that will make a difference.

Good bones to this recipe, but i needed to change a bit of the method.  I added the butter to the pot first by it self and melted it. I then chopped a small onion and cooked them in the butter.  Added the garlic next and allowed it to cook for a minute. I cut the dill by half as I felt it would be too strong with more. I proceeded with the rest of the recipe as listed. Great soup!

Very good and easy.   After I blended I did not cook any longer.  I could see no reason to.   It was very flavourful and was good cold as well.  I will leave the butter out next time just to see how it turns out.

This is seriously the best soup I've ever made.  I threw it together bc I had some leftover broth and about 6 carrots I that I didn't have plans for.  I used beef broth instead of chicken.  It's fantastic!

Hearty and yummy! I added a couple of mint leaves while boiling.
