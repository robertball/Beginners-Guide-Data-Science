3.26.20  I steam a lot of veggies, so I have a microwave pot and didnâ€™t use the paper towel method for cooking.  The only thing that I would do differently in the future is not steam the crisp bacon because it gets soggy, rather, just sprinkle it on after it comes out of the microwave.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.
