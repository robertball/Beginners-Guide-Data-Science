Made as written and these were good. The chicken wasn't very crispy and that was my only complaint. It was flavorful but not crispy.

This is really good!  I was a little nervous that I could smell the barbecue sauce in the marinade, but the flavor blended well when cooked.   I let the chicken marinate overnight, and then made sure to drain the chicken (there was a bit of liquid with the chicken after sitting overnight) before cooking.  I cooked the chicken until the marinate had completely cooked off, and it was so good!
