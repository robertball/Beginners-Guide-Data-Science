These are fantastic.  I have made them probably 4 times already and just realized I hadn't rated them yet.  I usually do half white and half whole wheat flour and I add a bit of ground flax seed too. I have done strawberry and raspberry.  But our favorite  was using my homemade Wild Maine Blueberry freezer jam.  Oh So Good!  They do crumble a bit at first but if they cool all the way they hold together just fine.  I am going to have to try putting nuts in it too.  I bet that's a great addition.  Thank you wwgirl.

Excellent bar cookies. Very easy to make. Brought these to a party and they went fast.  Crumbly and smooth at the same time.  I also made a batch with apricot preserves and it was just as good.

Very, very good bar! 4-1/2 stars, since they're delicious, but didn't rock our world or make us crave them. I made easy even easier by combining all ingredients in the food processor. A few pulses and you're done! Good, short texture to the cookie part. Used 1/3 butter and 2/3 margarine in order to give a little more flavor. I multiplied the recipe by 1.5 and made in two 9" square pans, one with raspberry and one with strawberry. Both are tasty. Because eggs don't divide well, I couldn't use 1-1/2 eggs. I used 2 eggs and the dough wasn't crumbly at all. I flattened pieces to lay on top. Both varieties were done at 30 minutes. Sprinkled with powdered sugar for a pretty finish. Note: These bars can be made with fresh berries, too. See Berry Crumb Bars on this website, which is almost identical (with the exception of replacing preserves with fresh fruit.)

These are very sweet and delicate.  I only had half a jar of seedless raspberries so I added the only thing I had left in the fridge...grape jelly (that could explain the sweetness)!!!  There are crumbly and at first I didn't think they would bake up very well.  Make sure you let the bars cool completely before trying to cut since they do crumble easily.  However, we couldn't stop eating them!!!  I would like to try these with other jam and jelly fillings next time.

These were good and very easy to make.  I used sugar-free strawberry jelly (to get that bottle out of my fridge already) and added a handful of chopped pecans to the top layer before baking.  I won't use sugar-free in the future and I'll probably add a little more than the recipe calls for since it was a very thin layer.  I also lined my 9X13 pan with wax paper and sprayed with non-stick spray.  It made it a little easier to get the bars out of the pan without breaking them.  They are very crumbly and delicate and worth making again!

I didn't like the recipe of Jammin bars. I didn't like it because I didn't really like the taste or the texture of it. It was to crumbly and just not very good. I don't think I would make these again.

Made these late last night-as I was patting the dough into the pan I realized I forgot the egg! But I went ahead anyway-I used fig jam, about 14 oz. & baked for 35 minutes. hubby loved them, took some to work- they disappered quickly. Also took some to a neighbor  & they got a thumbs up there also.  Tomorrow, the last of them will be  the Sat night dessert to our weekly wii get-together. They are crumbly so I cut them into very small bite-size pieces, to eliminate that problem & it sure makes them go further. So many variations could be made w/this-can't wait to make some more & use a different filling.  Oh, & I did sprinkle confectioner's sugar over after they came out of the oven.

These were very easy to make but they just didn't "hit it off" with me. My DD liked them. I probably will not make them again.

I used about 16 ounces jam, and put chopped almonds on top. I had no problem removing them from the pan. The nuts browned fast, and I was worried it was undercooked, but it wasn't. I'm guessing those that had difficulty with the bars crumbling overcooked them. This is fast and easy for potlucks - not my personal favorite, since I'm not big on sugary things.

Very simple and DELICIOUS!  I use butter flavored Criso to add a little more flavor.  I also add a half cup of finely chopped nuts (whatever I have on hand - almonds, walnuts, pecans, etc) to the crust and topping mixture.  YUM!!!!!

I did substitute 1/2 cup sweetened butter for half of the shortening- really good. I also omitted the cinnamon-

I just pulled these from the oven. They smell so good. I did use my homemade cherry jam.  We are having them for Father's Day supper. I thought they were easy to made. I will post how they tasted after supper tonight.

Very tasty, I really liked it. Not too sweet. I'm sensitive to small seeds, so I have to use raspberries sparingly, so when I do, I like it to be delicious, and these were. Thank you.

I give the recipe 4 stars, it was good, but it was also kind of sweet. It was really crumbly and kind of made a mess. Maybe thats because we didn't let it sit long enough. It tasted pretty good. They were very easy to make if you follow the recipe exact.

These bars tasted alright and were sweet.  The only thing wrong was that they were dry and crumbly because they'd fall apart and made me thirsty afterwards...

I thought these were pretty good. If i could change something I would've left it in the oven a little longer to get the golden crispy color. But overall I thought this bar was very good and I would probably make it again.

These bars were pretty good. I loved how crumbly they were and I think it is the perfect amount of jam. I used strawberry jam, but I think that was the wrong choice.

It was fast and easy to make, but personally I didn't like it. The taste was not good, and it was really crumbly.

My Foods class made it yesterday, but I was gone. I still got to taste it though, and it went down very smooth. I liked the crumbly, semi-crunchy texture it had. The only complaint I really have is how sweet it is. It tastes good at first, but the aftertaste really gets to me. All around good bars.

They were fairly easy to make, and didn't take very long at all. The bars looked as thought they were very good, and they baked well, turning a golden brown on the top.

They tasted very well and were amazing, I just loved how they looked they look appetizing. I say I would enjoy making them at home and have more later on in life.

Very easy to make and ready in a decent amount of time. Good recipe for the beginner baker or the expert baker. Even though I'm not a big fan of jam, even I can't deny of good they are!

These bars were very good. They were crumbly, yet delicate all in one. I would make these bars for my family over and over again. They were very easy to make. I give these bars 4 stars for sure.

This recipe was great, and the bars tasted so amazing I teared up. When they came out of the oven I was like  ah-he-hay-hoooooo. The texture was crumbly and it had jam in the middle, a perfect combination. I loved it.

This were easy and delicious. DH couldn't get enough of them - said they were like raspberry pie. I would add a tad more sugar to the shortening mix next time - maybe 1/4 cup because I thought they could use a little more sugar. Other than that they were great.

I was looking for a jam bar recipe that did not use oats when I came across this one.  I made a 9 x 13 pan of them for a potluck last Sunday, and they were such a hit!  I used exactly half the crumbs for the bottom crust, and half for the top, and I thought it was a perfect ratio.  I did use a 20 oz. jar of jam; less would not have been good.  I used an apple pie jam I bought in Amish country, dusted the tops with powdered sugar, and called them apple pie bars.  I'm looking forward to making these several times using different flavors of jams.  Thanks for a terrific and easy recipe!

These taste great!  I cut the recipe in half because I was using a smaller pan, and I used strawberry preserves.  I lined the pan with wax paper beforehand, but it's still a little tricky getting that removed without causing the bars to come apart a little.  That's when you say, "Oops...this little part just came off.  I guess I'll have to eat it."  :)  Overall, tasty recipe and it looks nice too!

They're really good! I used all whole wheat flour, but added only about 2 1/2 C. Plus I only added 1/2 C of sugar, and I used fresh raspberries that I smooshed up. It was very good, but I think I'm going to use less of the flour mix and more of the reaspberry mix next time.

These were very good, however I would make a few slight adjustments if I were to make them again.  I would use more than 50% of the crumb mixture on the bottom and less than 50% on top.  I would also use more than 10oz of preserves - I had an 18oz jar but did as the recipe said and used only 10oz - they would have been even better if I had used the whole jar!

these bars can be made using frozen fruit which is what I did.  I used 4 cups of frozen berries, mixed variety and cooked it for about 40 mins, till light brown and starting to bubble.  Turned out perfect!

If you're in the mood to bake but don't have alot of special ingredients, this is the perfect recipe. So easy and so good with just simple ingredients.  I used marge instead of shortening.  They were still great.  This one is going in my fav's.  Thank you!!

My family loved this recipe, and it's so easy to add to such as shredded coconut or nuts into the top layer. The only trouble I had was keeping the family away from it long enough for it to set.

These are the best raspberry bars. There are no complaints and they go very fast.

Very good recipe!  I substituted splenda for the sugar and used 100% fruit spread, also added almost a full pkg of grain sweetened chocolate chips.  Very sweet, but very  good.I will make these again, varying the fruit part.

This was an easy great recipe.  I think I'm going to add some mini chocolate chips next time to make it even better.
