I was shocked by how little flavor this had, considering it begins w/onion, garlic, and bacon! I kept taking a bite, searching for the flavor I never did find.  Perhaps one less box of spinach may make a difference?  THANKS for the recipe, mommy_of_six!

I made the recipe as written and it turned out delicious.  My husband also loved it, so I will definitely make it again.

A good version of creamed spinach if you are short on time. Use large cloves of garlic and onion salt for a little more flavor. Freshly grated Parmesan on top.  Yum!
