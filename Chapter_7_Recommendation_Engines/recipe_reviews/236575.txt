This is a 5 star recipe.  Exactly what I was hoping these pancakes would be.  At first, I was a little overwhelmed with the large amount of batter, but they fry up super fast and in no time youâ€™re done.  They will be excellent to freeze leftovers for another meal.  Will definitely make these again!!

Excellent, not too sweet at all, which means any toppings work. I had to add a little extra flour to get the batter thick enough for thicker pancakes.

OMG these pancakes are the BEST I EVER MADE that's the direct comment from my husband 
He requests that I make these every Sunday sometimes he asks me to make these for dinner during the week. 

If I make them for dinner I let the batter rest between 1-2 hours considering this is on the weekday.

*** NOTE. my husband likes a thinner pancake, I whisk in between 1/4 to 1/2 cup of water, orange or Apple juice just before using.
I also add in 1 Tablespoon of sugar...

I didn't have vanilla during one use so I substituted 1 Tablespoon of maple syrup (it use just as delicious.

*** I also melted some butter and used a pastry brush and brushed the pan with it before my first pancake.  It worked quite well

These pancakes were delicious, but next time I make them I will add more flour as they were quite thin.

missed the sugar, I don't like very sweet pancakes, but I have to put sugar or something on these. Very easy to make, maybe even over night if u put it on a colder spot
