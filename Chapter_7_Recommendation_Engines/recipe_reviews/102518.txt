I give very few 5 stars, but this one deserves every star!  I'd give it ten if I could!  This is absolutely wonderful!  I made a couple minor adjustments.  I used whole wheat corkscrew pasta (couldn't find bow ties at a large supermarket!), doubled the kale and probably tripled the cayenne.  Next time, I'll use even more kale.  This dish will grace my dinner table weekly as long as kale is in season.   Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I added kalamata olives, zucchini, extra cayenne and extra kale. It was great, but I think it would have been too bland without the olives.

This is really good! The garlic & the cayenne really compliment the kale. I love the IDEA of kale -- it's soooo healthy -- but don't love the taste, so this recipe addressed that. Make sure you use one "packed" cup of kale, as it really shrinks in the cooking, so more is better here.

I used Dino kale, ribs removed, and doubled the amount. I used Barilla Plus penne, and only used 1 red pepper. I also added 4 chopped green onions, green and white parts. I used a little less feta, I love feta but there was a LOT of it there. I always saute peppers first, and then add the rest so the garlic doesn't burn. It was very good. Also, I boiled the pasta in water in which I added paprika, garlic powder and cayenne. I didn't put the cayenne in the dish itself and it was spicy enough for me. Delicious!

Delicious!! Made a few changes -- tossed the dish with Wostershire, black olives and capers. Gave it a richer flavour -- also added more cayenne; we like it spicy.  Wonderful recipe!!!

Was a great dish and was our first experience using kale. We substituted pasta shells. Loved the combination of the pasta, peppers, kale and feta. We used it as a side dish with our baked fish.

This was very good, but the kale cooks down a lot, so I suggest quadrupling it to 4 cups.  I also suggest putting in only half the recommended amount of feta.

My family said this was one of the best pasta dishes they've ever had.They want me to definitely make it again!  I used one box of bowtie pasta together with five bell peppers (red, yellow and green) and the whole bunch of kale. I also used extra olive oil. We like lots of veggies. Very colorful.

Very good. Grated some Parmigiano Reggiano over it instead of Feta--didn't have any. Even better the next day. Ate it cold tossed with a little Italian dressing. Next time will add more kale since I'm suppose to get more greens in my diet.

Made this for dinner on a weeknight and it turned out fabulous! I added some grilled chicken to make it a bit heartier (for my husband) and he absolutely loved it! It is even better cold than hot in my opinion. I used a different pasta shape than the bow ties and it turned out fine. I really don't think it matters what shape pasta you use. Also, I think any kind of leavy green veggie, such as spinach, would also work well in this recipe. Highly recommended. Will definately be making again.

This was fantastic. I used green instead of yellow peppers (for cost) and wide egg noodles instead of farfalle, since that's what I had on hand. It was a very good, very satisfying mediterranean  (?) type dish that I love. I might cut back on the feta just a little.

This was very, very good. I used fresh grated parmesan cheese instead of feta (didn't have any on hand) but can't wait to try it with feta. I added a bit more cayenne pepper and also added a little bit of Worcestershire sauce. So simple, so good. Yum!

Very good.  Used more Kale as others suggested and a bit of chicken broth.  Also used garlic scapes rather than garlic cloves - a subtler flavour but good.

This is a great use of kale - but I suspect that spinach would taste great in this as well. I read through most of the reviews and I modified the recipe based on the feedback that there needed to be a sauce and to double the kale. I used the Butter Sauce that I found on this site and it worked out great. I also added a grilled chicken breast on top of the bowl of pasta, to add some needed protien. I will definately do this dish again.

This is a keeper of a recipe.  Easy to prepare, colorful, and best of all delicious.  It will be served regularly at our house...and probably served to guests, as well.

First time my husband and I have eaten kale, we loved it! We had this as our main meal, by adding boneless, skinless chicken breast. With a cast iron griddle, I cooked the salt and peppered breast, then let them rest to simmer in juices, in some reynolds wrap. Sauted peppers, mushrooms, garlic, and one small onion. Added an entire bunch of kale, but first I removed the stem. Added cooked pasta to this, cut up breast, added those, poured in small amount of chicken broth. Last but not least topped with some fresh grated Parmesan, only because we don't care for feta. Delicious!!!

Have had this in my "Recipebox" for awhile and finally cooked it last night. Used about 4 times the kale, 1/4 tsp cayenne, 4 ozs feta. Definitely a keeper. Am eating it cold for lunch today and I think it tastes even better!

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this dish!  I make a large batch and have it for lunch at work everyday.  It becomes a higher protein dish by adding edamame to it.  Love it!

Pretty good dish, although a bit bland.  I used almost the entire bunch of kale (it really reduced down to almost nothing in the skillet), while cooking the veggies I added some chicken stock.  I used feta seasoned with mediterranean herbs.  I think it could have used some halved cherry tomatoes thrown in as the kale is almost cooked.

This has a good taste but was a little "dry" as there is not real sauce. Increased the amount of kale to four cups and next time will add even more.  Next time I will decrease the amount of pasta by 1/2. I will also make a few changes to the directions. Will saute the peppers until soft before adding the kale, garlic and seasonings.  After combining the pasta, vegetables and cheese will add some pasta water to create a little "sauce" and make it a little creamier.

I've done this recipe a few different times, and its been well received by both my husband and toddler. I've actually done the variation suggested by another reviewer (used mushrooms instead of pasta) and it worked so well that it's now added as a permanent side dish on my weekly menu.

Wow, a popping good recipe - served as an accompaniment to vino & formaggio sausage on a bed of butter beans.  This sweet pepper pasta toss with kale really hits the mark.

Of course, I modified a here and there by 1. roasting and peeling my peppers, and 2. adding 1 tsp vermouth the last few minutes of cooking.

An excellent vegitarian recipe - hearty enough for a cold winter's night, but at the same time, light enough for summer fare.

Extremely easy to make. I used some spinach from a leftover salad bar salad, and used some crushed and ground red pepper in place of cayenne. The peppers and spices added a nice flavor, but to make it a little saucier, I added a bit more olive oil and some tarragon white whine when I tossed it all together. Also served with "Fast and Friendly Meatballs" (turkey).

I'd definitely make it again (the same way).

I loooooved this!  I didn't have farfalle so I used whole wheat organic rigatonei instead and that added its own flavor to it, which was a plus.  Also, I only broke up 6 oz. of feta and we used it as a topper.  I'm sharing this with everyone I know.

This made a nice meal for me! I really enjoyed it! I did make a few changes though just to make it a bit more healthier I halved the amount of pasta and doubled all the veggies!Also I had no feta on hand so I substituted gorgonzola cheese! it was Amazing!!!

I rarely review things on here, but this dish was so bland I had to comment. The pasta overall is very dry and the ingredients don't mesh well in my opinion. A dressing on it would help.

Quick and tasty. Didn't like the kale so will use baby spinach next time and jalapeño peppers for heat instead of cayenne. Thanks for sharing!

It was dry, had to had more olive oil at the end. Also, it was a bit bland, I added more cayenne. If you like the tartness of feta and sparse dishes, this one's for you. I prefer something a bit more substantial. I used this recipe mainly to introduce myself to kale.

I made this for lunch today and I loved it! I only gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I personally thought the recipe was missing something. I love that this recipe gives me another way to incorporate Kale into our diets and the taste of the cayenne pepper is a perfect fit! The only thing I did different was to use elbow pasta because it was what I had on hand, and I also did two pinches of cayenne pepper instead of 1. Delicious! I will definitely make it again!

I used brown rice (gluten-free) rotini, and tossed in some sliced turkey sweet italian sausage.  I used goat cheese (casein-free) rather than feta, and not quite as much as called for.  Other than that, I made exactly as specified, and it was phenomenal!!  First time using kale...and it adds a neat sort of meaty dark green flavor, which is mellowed nicely by the peppers.  The cayenne and basil compliment it nicely.  I'll definitely make this one again - thanks MOTTSBELA!

So easy, and really good!  I used whole wheat pasta and probably closer to 4 cups of kale, omitted the salt and just used a little bit of feta on each plate before serving.

Yum! Added some chopped red onion, and about 1/4 cup of vegetarian "chicken" broth to the saute.  Added red pepper flakes instead of cayenne.  Thanks for the recipe!

This dish is so yummy and EASY:) I also added extra kale (about 4 cups) and instead of cayenne pepper added oregano. Once the kale just started to wilt I added the pasta right into the pan and just heated through. Great way to incorporate more kale into your diet.

I read many reviews that said this needed more kale and I agree. I used an entire bunch of kale and it was perfect. I wanted a main dish the night I made this, so I added shrimp & it was fabulous! I will definitely make again, either with the shrimp or as a side dish just as is....wonderful flavor! Thanks for sharing!

This was a marvelous recipe. We like more veggies than pasta so I doubled the kale, used whole wheat bow ties (decreased the amount recommended), upped the feta and in the last phase of sauteing, threw in some shrimp. Delightful! Makes a hearty cold salad for summer, too.

Great, colorful and healthy dish. I, like others, increased the kale to the whole bunch and also increased the feta. Easy. I do suggest cooking the pepper a little bit before adding the kale. The kale cooks much faster than the pepper. I also put a lid on it once I added the kale, for more even cooking of the kale.

This recipe was just fair for us...because we found it kind of flat-like it was missing something.  I followed it as listed but since many people recommended using more kale I did increase that.  To help make it pop we had to drizzle it with a little bit of italian dressing and sprinkle a bit of parmesan on it...only then did we feel like ti was "good."  With some tweeking I will make this again but as a side dish to something like chicken.  Thanks for sharing.

What a lovely colorful dish! I used what I had on hand (whole wheat penne, red, yellow & orange peppers and baby spinach. I also added a small chopped onion as well. I omitted the basil as I had none on hand. I seasoned the pepper, garlic and onion mix (I had about 2.5 cups of veggies) with red pepper flakes (maybe a 1/4 teaspoon). I added the spinach to the sauted vegetables for the last minute or so of cook time. I drained the pasta, reserving a cup of the cooking water.  Dumped the drained pasta into the saute pan with the veggies, (wished I had used more than 1C of spinach!), added about a 1/4 C of the reserved pasta water along with about 3/4 C of crumbled feta.  I served the pasta over a couple of handfuls of raw baby spinach. And topped with just a bit more feta.  YUM!  This will make my regular dinner rotation!  I was very full and since I am only cooking for 1, there were about 3 cups of leftovers. I think it would be delightful served cold as well-maybe with a bit of sour cream added for moisture and more flavor.  I am eager to try it with kale as well since kale is so healthy. I may make a special trip to acquire some kale from the farmer's market.  Since I always have feta, tri-color peppers and baby spinach on hand (from Costco; this gives me a great, easy and satisying meal to make from those ingredients with leftovers to take for lunch or the next day. I generally make this recipie on my "meatless Monday" menu, though I think it would be good with some leftover

MMMMMMMMM.........very satisfying. I didn't have kale, but used chopped collard greens instead, pretty much the same. Drizzled extra light virgin olive oil on top before serving. Perfect as a main dish or a side dish. So quick and easy to make, and I loved how colorful it was. Thanks!

Solid recipe with kale! Very flavorful dish - the peppers, garlic and kale all blend together very nicely. I made sausage on the side and was going to add it, but the taste of this dish stands on its own.

Yum!  I followed other suggestions to use 3 cups of kale and I'm glad I did as it really reduces down when you cook it.  I used a green pepper instead of yellow so lost some color but the taste was the same.  I also used 4 oz. of feta cheese and I think that was plenty; 8 oz would overpower the dish.  This one's a keeper!

Delicious.  Used 1/2 the recommended feta cheese and thought it was perfect.  Will probably add more kale next time.

This was pretty fabulous...probably a 4.5 star based on taste, and the health factor just bumped it up a notch!  I used Barilla Plus rotini (just to make it super-healthy).  Would probably use a bit more kale next time, it just cooks down so much (and I love kale!)  I was worried because the garlic didn't seem to be browning at all and I was afraid it would be overwhelming, but the flavors just blended so well.  Could maybe use a bit more cayenne, just because I like things spicy.  I never knew how much I loved feta before I tried this!  WONDERFUL.  Even got guy friends to eat veggies!  A+

This was alarmingly good!  I've been trying to work more leafy greens into my diet and this was the perfect dish for it.  Based on previous reviews I didn't measure out my kale, I just used "a bunch" and it worked out great.  I also substituted campanelle pasta because it's more bite sized and crushed red pepper because it was what I had.  Overall it was delicious.  I made it for dinner last night and brought it for lunch today - it's great cold too!

this recipe was delicious!  we doubled the kale, but we could have had even more, because it wilted down so much (which i didn't think would happen).  it could do with a bit more flavor, but i'm not sure what at this point.  the feta complemented the flavor from the peppers and cayenne perfectly!

I quite enjoyed this recipe. My family felt something was missing. (sauce)
Next time l will use W/W pasta, a lot more kale and balsamic vinegar to give it zip. It's really good the next day also.

So good. Had almost every ingredient in my sparse kitchen, meant to be. Used what I had: quinoa elbows, added 2tblsp pesto, doubled the kale and cayenne, goat cheese. It's a flexible recipe. I saw someone added kalamatas, I'll do that next time.

It was okay. I must have done something wrong, because it came out like an oddly flavored pasta salad. I think if there is a next time, I'll add veggie stock to make more of a sauce and add cherry tomatoes like another reviewer suggested.

This is really good! Instead of feta I used Parmesan, plus added more Kale! Tasty!

Surprisingly light, moist and tasty. I added an orange pepper to the mix and used parmesan cheese.

This was a fantastic dish for our vegetarian household. I loved the subtle hotness the cayenne pepper added! I put in about twice as much kale and maybe four instead of one pinch of cayenne pepper. Yum!!! I added some chopped avocado and tomato on the side, sprinkled with salt and fresh-ground pepper.

This recipe was delicious!  I also added an orange bell pepper, a pint of cherry tomatoes, about 1/2 cup of Kalamata olives, an additional pinch of basil, plus I increased the cayenne pepper by a good bit.  In all, I probably used almost 2 teaspoons of cayenne.  I prefer my spiciness level to be medium.

I would say add a little more kale, and I think it would be great with some pine nuts in it.  I needed a bit more olive oil than the recipe suggested.  Nice complement of flavors and a great use for kale!  Thanks!

This was such a simple and delicious dish. I added some red onion and used the small sweet peppers, they are less expensive and taste so good. i saute'd the onions, garlic and sweet peppers first then added the kale by placing it on top and drenching it with lemon. i also added fresh basil. sooooo good.

Absolutely delicious! I've never had kale before and wanted a vegetarian meal for a change. I did make a few changes. I added half an onion and a zucchini to the saute and used an orange instead of a yellow pepper. I left out the cayenne and used thyme instead of basil. Also it isn't necessary to use 8 oz of feta, 4 is more than sufficient. I will be making this again!

Loved this!  Easy to make for a novice cook like me.  The best part was the leftovers were just as good cold like pasta salad, no need to reheat.  I will bring this to the next potluck I go to to introduce people to kale.  I used one whole bunch of kale from the store, didn't measure it, and used some reviewers suggestions like: added Worcestershire sauce, capers, and kalamata olives.  I used a 6 oz package of feta instead of 8, and I might cut that down to 4oz next time.  My husband liked it, too, and we both took it to work the next day.

This recipe is so good!  I used ground red pepper flakes instead of cayenne pepper to add some spice, and added about double the kale.  It turned out great!  I had never tried kale before, but will defintely be eating more of it now.    I also only added the feta to each individual dish, that way it keeps better and can be refrigerated longer or frozen for leftovers!

This recipe has been in our weekly menu rotation for a few years now.  I use whole wheat bow pasta and the entire head of kale (it cooks down to nothing).  I also use chili powder instead of the cayenne pepper and add a few chili flakes for extra spice.  This recipe is a fantastic way to eat kale on a regular basis.

This was okay, but not great.  I took other's advice and used more kale, and added tomatoes, but the flavor was still lacking.  Some chicken broth next time would improve the kale and make more of a sauce when combined with the pasta.

This was superb!!!!!  I'm a kale lover! So much so that I often blend it into my smoothies. My only modifications to this were to that I used sea shell pasta (on hand) and I didn't cook the kale with the peppers. I like my veggies to have a bite to them, so I merely lightly sauteed the peppers, tossed with pasta in and then tossed the entire chopped bunch of kale. I just let the kale wilt down by the heat of the pasta and peppers. It was perfect!!!

This dish was a great way to eat more vegetables!  I used spinach instead of kale, and I used 4 cups of it.  The feta complimented the pasta very well.  A pinch of cayenne was perfect, any more and it would have been too much.  The basil and garlic added a lot of flavor.  This will be my go to dish when I feel like I need to eat more greens!!

Really good. I made this because I received kale in my vegetable box and I wasn't sure what to do it with it. It had a great flavor. I only used 4 ounces of feta cheese and cut up some italian sausage I had in the freezer. I also roasted the peppers before putting them in with the rest of the ingredients. Vey good recipe.

This was super yummy but I made a few changes. I added 1 orange bell pepper, 1/4 cup chopped purple onion, and a pound and half of chopped chicken breast that I marinated for a few hours in a tomato garlic basil marinade. I also used whole wheat penne pasta. Super yummy and the kids ate it up!

Just made this. Eating it right now! I added lots of balsamic vinegar, paprika and olives. It's kind of bland on its own, so don't skimp with the seasonings! Also, like other reviews have said, the kale cooks down a lot. I used the entire head of kale and it was a good amount.

I am so glad I found this recipe or I probably never would have cooked kale. It looks beautiful and tastes great, and is good for you. I changed the cheese from feta to crumbled goat. Will make again and again.

I love this recipe.  I made a few changes but the base of the recipe is excellent.  I used spinach and mozzarella instead of kale and feta.  I added onions in with the peppers and did not have any fresh garlic so at the end I added in a can of petite diced tomatoes with garlic and olive oil.  It was delicious, fast, and simple.  I will make this often.

Sun-dried tomatoes also go well in this and parmesan is a good substitute for the feta, if that's more your style.

Excellent recipe. I doulbled the Kale and spices and a little red hot pepper. I also used goat cheese instead of feta. This is definately a repeat as a main coarse or side dish.

This was a great way to use up the Kale I had laying around.

I used a lot more kale, a little less Feta, and added some kalamata olives (and a bit of the juice from the bottle).  Turned out great.  Was just as good the next day as a cold pasta salad.

Very good; nice flavor combination!  I made the recipe as described except:  used four ounces of pasta (which I typically do with any pasta toss recipe, just because I like a little pasta with my veggies!!); one red pepper on hand; no yellow, so compensated by adding three-fourths cup edamame.  I also used four loosely-packed cups of chopped kale, as my purpose for making this at this time was to use up the kale.  I kept the methods and seasonings the same.  This recipe really doesn't make a sauce, but that's OK because the flavor is there.  I did add one ounce of fat-free cream cheese when I heated the leftovers the next night.

This is an amazing recipe.  Very flavorful as is.  The only modification I make is I use whole grain pasta.  This recipe is otherwise perfect.

I really enjoy this nice simple clean recipe.  It’s good whether it’s warm or cold. I will probably try this again and add a few different things although I liked it as it is.

I've been making a version of this for ten years! It's a great recipe. I use spinach instead of kale, rotini or penne pasta instead of farfalle, I skip the cayenne, and instead of feta I do parmesan and mozzarella. The whole family loves it.

It’s fabulous! I had lots of kale so probably added 4-6 cups. I added sliced mini portobello mushrooms because I needed to use them & kalamata olives. Hubby added fresh grated Parmesan cheese, I thought the feta was enough. I’ll make this again and again, many thanks!

The only reason I'm giving three stars is that you really do have to take advice from other cooks for this to be successful. I had to increase the kale to 3 cups, increase the spices a LOT. I enjoy the idea and the fact we ate kale again on purpose. But I think the recipe needs tweaking based on many reviewers

I made it just as recipe called for and thought it was very good, but maybe lacked just a little bit of flavor.  So I added just a touch of white balsamic vinegar into my leftovers...and thought it gave it a nice pop of flavor!

I liked this recipe but found that the pasta was a little dry. Since my wife does not like spicy food, I omitted the cayenne pepper but added some Garlic & Onion Powder and some Olive Oil for taste and texture.

I was inspired by this, but didn't have a few ingredients so I substituted a few ingredients. I had no peppers so I used onion instead. I used more oil (just free poured it to my preference) than the recipe called for, and I used minced garlic versus cloved. Lastly I added crushed red pepper flakes (I love heat in my food), and mozzarella cheese. This turned out far better than anticipated. Thank you for the inspiration!

Pretty good, but like other reviewers, I found this to be a little bland.  I used a full 1 lb. box of pasta, a whole bunch of lacinato kale, and added a few chicken breasts.  The whole family enjoyed this meal, and I would make it again.

My husband and I and even the baby like this one.  We make it often.  It is perfect as is and has plenty of flavor but we've made it so may times that we just wing it so sometimes it turns out a little too spicy.   We usually use the whole batch of kale.

Very good recipe! I added 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts that I cut into chunks. I sauteed the chicken until it was almost done and then followed the recipe. Little squeeze of lemon at the end too. We loved it.

I absolutely love this recipe.  I am a Master Gardener and because of the nutrient density of Kale I had always wanted to try it but I was turned off by just the thought of eating it, since using this recipe I cannot get enough.  Also I plant the Lacinato variety of Kale which is an abundant and large producer.  Just recently we were out of dried basil and added fresh basil to the mix and it was outstanding.

This looks attractive and is healthy with the kale; also easy.However, I prefer a similar but tastier recipe on this site where the veggies are roasted (peppers, eggplant, yellow squash)and it uses balsamic .Feta,garlic and basil are used also,as in this recipe.I might make again though if I have kale to use up.

This was really easy and a great new way for me to use up all the kale in my garden. I used probably 5-6 cups of kale, and it still cooked down to almost nothing. I added more seasoning and some chopped black olives. We both really liked this. Great summer time meal. Served ours with steamed squash.

This was too bland for me. I tripled the kale and still could have added more. I added black olives for more flavor. I also increased the cayenne pepper, but it was still dry and bland.

This recipe is fantastic!  In fact, I finally joined allrecipes just so I could review it. 
The last time I made this, didn't have all the ingredients on hand so I had to improvise.  I used orzo pasta and all red peppers and only 6 oz. of feta, and I think I actually liked it better this time.  This is definitely a must try recipe.  Love it!

Very easy & delicious. The next day my husband commented several times how much he liked this dish -- I will be making this on a regular basis. I used only what I had on hand: yellow gypsy peppers only & pecorino romano cheese since I didn't have any feta. I didn't have to chop the kale because I had a large bag of baby kale which reduced prep time!

My husband and I both loved this dish.  We are always looking for good meatless dishes to add to our catalog and this one is a keeper.

Really loved this recipe to used our garden full of kale.  Loved that it only took a few minutes to put together.  We're veggie nuts in our house so we increased the amount of Kale and pepper to aid more vitamins and veg.  We also used a bunch of fresh basil instead of dried.  Delicious!

i accidentally used 16 oz of pasta, just threw in some more kale and spices and it was excellent.  I will definitely make this again.

I loved the recipe, but thought it needed a lot more kale!  I also used mustard leaf w/ the kale and that worked great.

Great recipe - my first time cooking with Kale. I used a gluten-free rice pasta, and I didn't have feta, so I used goat cheese instead (I found with that I needed just a touch more olive oil.) Thanks for sharing!

Quite delicious! I also quadrupled the amount of kale (love the stuff), used fresh purple basil, kalamata olives, habanero sauce (also love spicy), and an aged stilton instead of feta. There's a lot of room for experimentation with this recipe!

Very nice, basic recipe. I think that it could use touches to make it great, but is also good as is.

This was my first time ever cooking kale, although I don't have picky eaters in my family I was nervous. Everyone loved this meal! Even my 4 year old. They ate seconds and took it cold to school for lunch the next day. I will definetly cook this again. thank you.

This recipe is a winner. It went over great with the fiance and our dinner guest, but I would make one small change in the future. I've always been a fan of crisp-tender veggies and am always worried about over-wilting greens, but I wasn't wild about the texture of the kale in this recipe - it was still a little too tough for my taste. Next time (and there WILL be a next time!), I'll chop the kale even smaller, and then cook it alone in the covered pan for a bit, so it will have time to sweat and soften without compromising the crispness of the peppers. If that doesn't work, I'll probably revert to blanching it quickly in the pasta water. Overall, this recipe is a great way to enjoy ultra-nutritious kale.

This recipe was pretty good, but bland.  I would probably double or even triple the kale next time, and also add more seasonings.

Good quick midweek meal.  Next time I will add more kale, as I couldn't taste it too much.  But still, the recipe is very tasty as written.

Delicious! The feta cheese is the icing on the cake, so to speak. I added chopped zucchini, used fresh basil, extra garlic, and more than a pinch of cayenne pepper. Also, I added a little water to the vegetables after they had been cooking for a little while. I had never used kale before, but I will definitely make this again!

My first recipe from AllRecipes -- made it last night and my wife and I loved it. Very easy to prepare, and very tasty.
