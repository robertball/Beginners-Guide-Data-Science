I love this recipe!  The homemade l;ady fingers are awsome and easy to make.  I'll never use stale, packaged ladyfingers again.  I made several modifications to this recipe.  Fisrt of all, like one other reviewer, I found this recipe very sweet.  I omitted sprinkling of powdered sugar on the lady fingers.  I substituted coffe liquour and creme de cacoa for the rum, to give it more chocolate flavor which was one of the coments I recieved the first time I made it.  Because they are very sweet, I reduced the sugar in the filling by about 1/4 cup.  To give it more chocolate flavor I also sprinkled grated chocolate and powdered cocoa on top of both layers.  The result was perfect.  I also make this in a square pan, without the lady finger "sides" when I need to bring it to a function.  Much easier to cut and serve, and still delicious!

I have made this tiramisu many times.  Each time I received RAVE reviews (some people are still talking about the first one I did over 2 years ago).  Anyhow...the only thing I change is that I use an equal amount of Irish Cream instead of rum as I personally do not like the flavor of the rum.  Aside from that, this last time that I made it, I tried what one reviewer suggested, doubling the marscapone.  I would NOT recommend it.  The finished product was much firmer and easier to cut (more like that of a cheesecake), but the flavor was just totally off balance.  I would recommend following the ORIGINAL recipe amounts exactly, as that is the way that I received the most amount of compliments.

My wife's Mother worked in an authentic Italian deli most of her life. My wife grew up enjoying the best Tiramisu by real Italian cooks. Being who I am I had to make a better Tiramisu to win her heart even more. I made this recipe and I have completely won her heart.  I have made this with the ladyfinger recipe and with store bought. The homemade lady fingers taste so much better. The store bought will work in a pinch though. Thanks Emily!

Super recipe.  To substitute mascarpone you can use cream cheese 16oz, 1/2c whipping cream, 5 Tbls sour cream.  You need about 27-30" X 3" to wrap the cake. I make the long side using a cookie sheet lined with a 6" wide strip of parchment.  I spread the cake batter 1/2" thick on the parchment and bake.  I then use a sizzor and cut the strip in half then square up the ends. (You end up with 2 strips that when cut square on the ends is un-noticeable)  I leave the parchment paper on and brush with coffee mixture and place in the spring form pan (parchment facing outwards)  I use a 9" spring pan and make 8" rounds with parchment lined cake pans for the bottom and middle layers.  The presentation is incredible.  This way you can only see the sides when the pan is removed.  I also used emrils coffee and filling recipe with 2 cups of whipping cream instead of one.

Oh my...!!! I opted out the rum and used cream cheese instead and this was still the best tasting and easiest Tiramisu I've ever made. Even my great cook mom says so. She really loves it and has asked me to make it again next week. The ladyfingers batter was easy to manage and didn't spread out like other recipes I've tried. I was afraid the cheese mixture wouldn't set, but it did. So I really had no problems. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This was my first time making this and I did not care of it too much. I followed the recipe to a T. The rum flavor was too much to handle for me. The heavy cream layer did have a nice texture and mine did not leak. Also, I didn't have enough batter for the outter circle of ladie finger. Although the lady fingers were yummy and I will use the recipe with a diff. filling recipe. I ended up buying ladyfingers for the circumfrance. If any of you live by a Polish deli I suggest the Polish ladyfingers as they are A LOT softer than the Italian ones. Look for a box that says "Biszkopty" on them.

Yum Yum! Wonderful Recipe. Tastes better the longer you let it sit in the fridge. The strong Rum taste went away after the second day. Will Make again. My Husband loved this. One thing I will do differently is soak the bottom layer a little more with the syrup. Mine was just a bit too bready still, while the midddle layer just melted away in your mouth.

This recipe has WAY too much sugar in it. The ladyfingers were fine, but 3/4 cup of powdered sugar was too much; I could not even taste the marscapone cheese over the powdered sugar in the filling.

Wow!  This was a group effort with the hubby and the 5 year old, but it totally paid off.  I followed the recipe to a T (almost) used godiva liquer in the syrup, and made three rounds of lady fingers for the trifle dish (no sides)  had to cut them a bit to fit in the bottom of the trifle (aka the bottom is smaller than the top that you trace ;-)  Next would shave the chocolate on each layer and then just a little on top for decoration.  The flavor was great, maybe a little strong on the liquor. The pieces themselves were great, but the soupy stuff on the bottom shouldn't be served.  After the first scoop was taken we "drained" the trifle and the rest was great!

This recipe is truly Devine.  If you are a tiramisu lover, this is the one.  I was asked to make a tiramisu for an Italian themed dinner party.  I loke tiramisu, but it normally isn't one of my favorit deserts.  This tiramisu is definately on my list of favorites now.  Making your own lady fingers is well worth it.  I didn't use all of the rum as called for in the cream, but instead used a little bit of the rum and added a bit of rum extract.  It was perfectly well balanced in flavor.  Next time I make it though I will make extra of the lady fingers.  They weren't enough of them to circle around the timamisu all the way.  Thx. Emily

This was quite easy for an experienced cook. I made it for Thanksgiving and my in-laws who are used to restaurant tiramisu gobbled it up. I made mine in a triffle dish and used a mocha kahlua. Tonight I used the filling recipe using Irish cream to make tiramisu cupcakes. Yum!

I only used the ladyfingers recipe and it was excellent! I used these lady fingers with "Classic Tiramisu" from this site and it was to die for!

Have had tiramisu in many fine restaurants, but none were any better than this recipe.  It wasn't difficult, but a bit time consuming.  It was worth the effort!

This recipe was fine - I think I just prefer a more dense tiramisu and the flavor was a bit eggy.  My grandfather called it "poofy" and I think that describes it perfectly.

Really good tho I cheated and bought ladyfingers from the Italian bakery.  Unfortunately it was wasted on my family who didn't even know what tiramisu is.  Their loss.

I've made this Tiramisu a number of times -- it's great. The first time I made the Lady Fingers as discribed, and they came out perfectly. However, they were a lot of messy work for what they are. From then on, I decided to use a vanilla cake mix, subsituting half the liquid with Ameretto Liqour. Then I cut the cake into full layers and followed the recipe to the letter... I've also played with using Ameretto in the filling as well -- vrs Rum. Very nice.

It's always been a total hit at dinner parties, not overly sweetm creamy and light. The longer it sits the better it seems to get which is perfect when throwing a party -- I make it the day before or in the morning...

I even turned it into a birthday cake a few times... but digging a well in the layer cake for the filling, and going a little lighter on the syrop -- Boiled frosting all over... Yummy!

Used store-bought cookies (layered them and poured the syrup on top)... used TIA MARIA instead of the RUM, used just unsweetened cocoa for the topping, reduced the sugar in syrup and filling by about 25%... still MORE than sweet enough and super yummy!  thanks for a keeper!

fantastic recipe...I got tired of chasing store bought ladyfingers. also the cake itself is prettier and more impressive looking than a square cake. I have to be honest though, I use a different filling as there are so many out there that individual tastes dictate whats best.

I fixed Emily's Tiramisu for an Italian themed dinner party.  My husband who haad tiramisu at almost every restaurant we ate at in Italy thought mine was better.  Will do this again.  I used Meyer's Original Dark Rum for the dark rum. Based on the starbucks staff I ordered a cup of the Starbucks Verona - french pressed for the strong coffee. (I am not a coffee drinker)

I have made this twice in one week, for two different parties and everyone loved it each time.  Thanks to the other raters saying it was too sweet, I had cut the sugar in HALF and it was just right. Great recipe, Emily.  It's in my recipe book to make many more times. Shirley

This recipe is what my friend asks for as her birthday present!!  I only use about 3 TBSP of rum as a personal preference.  The syrup recipe is too much, so half the recipe is more than enough.  As far as some reviewers mentioning the recipe being runny, add the heavy cream a little bit at a time...be patient since the process will take a while (using a whisk attachment works well).  A pricey dessert to make, but well worth the rave reviews you'll receive!

Excellent recipe with a bit of tweaking. Have made it a few times, so I think I've perfected on it - recipe needs a bit more cheese in the filling layer (I double it) to make it less runny. I also use 1c. powdered sugar in the filling, instead of 2c. (too sweet otherwise). For syrup, only make 1/2 of what recipe calls for - the extra is totally unnecessary. And when layering the cake, I like to shave semi-sweet chocolate in the middle as well. Good luck!

I have made this recipe many times, and often get requests for it.  I found it to be a little too sweet, so I have backed off on using a full cup of sugar in the syrup, and I use 1 cup of coffee instead of 1/2 cup to bring out a stronger flavor.  Over all I love this recipe!

I love tiramisu, so I thought that I'd give it a go.  I would recommend some changes.  I made this with store bought lady fingers and would make them if you have the time.  I also thought that this was WAY to sweet, so I'll cut the sugar in half all the way around next time.  I had LOTS of the coffee-based syrup left which makes me wonder if most people are using all of it in the recipe.  Don't do that, because it will turn out way to runny.  I made this in a trifle dish and it was very pretty.    Sooooo, I'll try again and post the results after!

This recipe is well worth your effort. Forget about making changes. If you make it as described you will get rave reviews. I made mine three days ahead and it was perfect. Don't forget to line the pan with parchment paper and store on a plate or it will drain all over your fridge. This Tiramisu will hold up beautifully and looks so perfessional.  Personally I won't bring the lady finger dough up and beyond the actuall cake as it doesn't absorb as much of the sugary boozy flavor. The lady fingers aren't hard to make if you trace the pattern first on wax paper. This will bring you much praise and you won't like any other Tiramisu after you've tasted this. My first attempt I ommited alot of the powder sugar as suggested in the other reviews, but next time I will use everything called for. This is a lovely dessert and I THANK EMILY for sharing. Bravo! I'm making it next week for our boss ... GREAT! because I can make it early in the week and it will be ready for our entertaining. Lots of work, but worth it in every bite!  Give it a try and W~O~W your company.

Tasted really good, not coffee'y enough for me, but good flavor!  I had to make 2 batches of the ladyfinger dough to make the cakes and sides though.

The ladyfingers were easy to make and turned out well.  I used boxed lady fingers for the ones around the edge since they looked nicer than mine did, but the taste and texture of the homemade ones were better.  
I soaked the bottom layer as was suggested, and this turned out fine, although it did leak out the bottom of the springform pan a bit.  I let it sit 2 days before serving, and this was fine.  
I thought the syrup was a bit too sweet and the ratio of cream to ladyfingers was a bit high.  When I make it again, I will cut back on the sugar in the syrup to at least half and decrease the ratio of cream layer to ladyfinger layer.

This is a fabulous tiramisu recipe.  Everyone who has tried it raves about it.  The ladyfinger circles and strips are just genius.  I always use Kahlua instead of rum, and I refrigerate at least 24 hours before serving.  Super!

This recipe was easy, and my husband's family loved it.  They were also impressed by the homemade ladyfingers!  Following the advice of other reviewers, I omitted the top sprinkling of powdered sugar and let it chill for 3 days.  My ladyfinger sides baked a couple of minutes too long and were not pliable, so I made extra syrup to soak them in before pressing them into the pan.  The excess syrup drained out of the bottom of my springform pan - I would definitely advise setting the pan on a plate!  I would definitely make this recipe again and experiment with different liqueurs.  I have another tiramisu recipe that calls for brandy, and I may try that next time.

WOW should be enough, but for helpful purposes, I will continue with the rating.  Initially, I was not very impressed with the ladyfinger recipe, but I will try it again.  May have been my fault!  I had only rum (no dark) and it turned out so good.  I was totally disappointed in the recipe the day after I made it.  However, before I threw it away (3 days later), I tasted it again and WOW!  My conclusion: let it sit for a few days so the coffee and rum flavors can mix and saturate the ladyfingers.

I've been making this recipe for years now and it's amazing. I usually add a bit more liquor (and even add different kinds to complement the rum), and tend to use a little more mascarpone.

I'm amazed that there aren't more comments about the excessive sweetness of this recipe. It's a shame, because in all other respects it is an amazing dessert - the texture, the appearance, and the underlying flavors are all wonderful. But ackkk! the sugar destoys the delicate mascarpone taste; you can't even tell it's there. Next time I will do as another reviewer suggested and halve the sugar all around. BTW, I served this to Italian friends yesterday who finished it politely but certainly didn't rave or ask for seconds. Nor did my friend whose absolute favorite dessert is tiramisu. But overall, the recipe is easy and beautiful.

This was my first try at Tiramisu and I am totally hooked on this recipe.  I have a friend who is an executive chef and he said I nailed it with this recipe.  I bought 2 6" springform pans and have made small ones.  They freeze and thaw well in the fridge.  This way I have some on hand for unexpected guests.

After looking at several different recipes, I made this tiramisu for my boyfriend.  I followed some of the suggestions, but would try a few differently next time.  First, I only brushed on the syrup for the bottom layer of ladyfingers. Next time I will soak it.  Also, soak the sides that are lined with the ladyfingers.  Also, I doubled the cheese layer which was great!  Secondly, I used only strong coffee in the syrup.  Next time I am adding espresso to it to give it a stronger coffee flavor. Let it set in the fridge for 3 days...that is a definite.  I also used dark rum which worked very well.  In addition, I made my own ladyfingers from Roxanne's recipe and they turned out great.  My boyfriend loved this tiramisu and now calls it "our special dessert."

This was not a tiramisu, it contained too much sugar, and was too fluffy. Pretty bad! The lady finger recipe was good but the over all recipe is no where close to what the classic tiramisu is! a real dissapointment.

This was a nice Tiramisu recipe.  My husband is a tiramisu afficionado and thought this was a worthy version, except he thought the mascarpone cheese layer was a little too sweet.  I'd probably reduce the sugar next time I make it.

this is a great basic recipe.  i have made other tiramisu using raw eggs and worried about eating it.  this uses no eggs, but has a very authentic taste.  i wouldn't try making the spring form pan assembly--but i made smaller lady fingers and used large wine goblets to make individual servings--they looked great when i served them to my guests.  so easy to take out of the frig and set on the table!  i added chopped semi sweet chocolate as a layer on top of the cheese filling and instead of rum, i used a combo of marsala wine, orange liquor and brandy.  i had half of the recipe left over and tried freezing it--it worked--the presentation suffered, but it still tasted yummy!

I made this for my mom and my sister, and they absolutely LOVED it. Now I am notorious in my family for burning macaroni and cheese, so they were shocked that I was able to make something that tasted so amazing! I couldn't find the mascarpone cheese, so I substituted cream cheese, I used Bacardi light rum (never dark) in both parts and it wasn't overwhelming at all, and I made the 9" ladyfinger circles too thick, so I didn't have enough dough for the 3" sides, but it still turned out wonderful-- worth every bit of the time it took to make. Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't know if I could handle a recipe with 10 steps, But I toughed it out and the results were outstanding! Everyone's eyes rolled back in ecstasy as they savored each mouthful - It looked like a feeding frenzy in a Zombie movie! I'm so proud of myself for making lady fingers from scratch, and the rest of it was a breeze. I had this recipe framed so I can hang it in a place of honor in my kitchen.

Superb! I substituted Kahlua for part of the rum.
Drew raves from my family. The ladyfingers are easy to make, albeit a bit time consuming, but far superior to anything you can buy. I forgot to put the sides in the pan before adding my second layer, and layered those in a separate bowl. Surprisingly, the presentation was still great.

This was incredible and as good as any from a restaurant. It really wasn't that hard to make either. I did cut out some of the confectioner sugar dusting and dusted both  filling layers with cocoa. Very good and would make again!

EVERYONE I have made this for who LOVES tiramisu has declared this the BEST tiramisu they have ever eaten. I don't like coffee, so I never really enjoy the finished product but I do enjoy taste testing while assembling. Quality control, of course!

I made this with a combo of store bought lady fingers and some angel food cake cut into ladyfinger size, and kahlua instead of rum, all leftover stuff. I used store bought whipped topping . I made it for DH's book club dinner, got raves about it. It really is better the onger it sits, I made it in the am and it would have been better if I had done it 1-2 days before. The angel food cake worked great.

I didn't have time for making the lady fingers, so I bought them.  This was still really wonderful.  There was a lot more syrup than necessary - I ate it over ice cream.  Yum.

I use this recipe and it is flawless.  The only thing that I don't do is the handmade lady fingers, I use Goya Lady Fingers, because they are crispy and when you soak them they become cake texture.

I've made this a couple of times to rave reviews (one guest said it was the best tiramisu he'd ever had, and the whole thing disappeared rather quickly). However, I like my cream really thick and dense, which isn't quite what you get from this recipe--doubling the amount of mascarpone cheese and reducing the heavy cream by about half seems to work.

I would make it with less rum and more coffee. It was too sweet to stomach, I would probably put less sugar.

This was OK. I followed the recipe as written. Very "creamy" though. I felt that a previous recipe I'd made which used zabaglion (sp?)had more flavor. I probably won't make this one again.

This is so yummy. Everybody loved it even though I used cream cheese and some sour cream in place of the mascarpone. This has earned a place in my permanant cookbook!

This was the best Tiramisu I have ever eaten. We had a big card party with 12 people and evryone said the same thing, it was great. I will make it again for our family get together. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was wonderful and EVERYONE I served loved it!  I made the recipe with skim ricotta instead of marscipone and it still turned out rather well -- I couldn't taste the difference (and neither could my date who is a tiramisu conoisseur).  I'd reccomend it to anyone. . . and it's FANTASTIC the next day, too!

Absolutly Awesome!  I plan on making this for my father (its his favorite) and I decided to do a trial run and test out the product on the guys I work with.  They loved it.  I followed other reviews and used less powdered sugar on the lady fingers and a mix of rum, coffee liqour, and chocolate liquor for the syrup!

Best tiramisu I've ever had! I made a few adjustment to make it a little more interesting. I added chocolate chunks in one of the layers and I baked the Ladyfingers in an 8x8 pan to make solid layers of ladyfingers. Excellent!

Fantastic tiramisu. I added cocoa powder while drenching the lady fingers with the syrup; it gave it a heavenly chocolately flavor.

I made this as a practice-run, for a special event.  It made enough for about 8 people.  It was special and elegant, but not quite as tasty as I thought it would be.  Very nice to add to my collection though.

I was a little afraid of this recipe but I decided to try it and I’m glad I did! After reading other reviews I used a little more then half of the sugar and I’m glad I did. They said I t was a light dessert, even though I told them it wasn’t as light as it tasted. They loved it and were so glad I made it. I was glad too and I will make it again.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out fantastic. Everyone loved it. I had some trouble with the lady finger batter sticking to the parchment paper. Will definitely make this one again and again-PS you MUST use Mascarpone Cheese, cream cheese is too strong in flavor.

I've made this several times and every time it comes out perfect. Everyone who has tried it raves about it, we've even done a taste test between this one and one bought from a well known italian restaurant and their doesn't even come near to how amazing this one is. As far as presentation goes, the ladyfingers on the sides never look great, they are always uneven but when it tastes so good, nobody cares what it looks like. It is melt in your mouth creamy and a strong rum taste. Absolute perfection!

I used this recipe for the lady fingers only. They came out very beautiful and tasty! They were light and fluffy, and I only sprinkled a tad of powdered sugar on them. I didn't have parchment paper and it seemed like a lot of extra work to make lady fingers the way mentioned, so instead I sprayed a cookie pan, and spread the batter in there. I cooked for the time suggested, allowed to cool, and cut them how I needed. Excellent! No more store bought lady fingers! Thank you!

This recipe worked out for me with a few modifications due to necessity. I would like to try making it to the T next time. 
I didn't have a coffee maker or regular coffee so I brewed up my hazelnut coffee in a coffee press which made for some really strong coffee. I also reduced the water in half. 

I couldn't find Mascarpone cheese in my local grocery store (I live in a primarily Latino neighborhood in Los Angeles and they were like "Que es eso?"). I substituted the Mascarpone with 8 oz of cream cheese and 3 tablespoons of sour cream. Poured in heavy whipping cream a little at a time. This was totally worth it. The most time consuming part of it but overall the texture and taste was well worth the effort. 

My whole family loved it. Next time I will soak the ladyfingers more. I followed the recipe here to the T and it turned out amazing. I am already imagining what else I can make with ladyfingers :). 

Thanks for this recipe. I will surely make it again for Thanksgiving.

I'm a beginner cook, and this came out absolutely superb! My only thing is that its WAY too sweet. I even cut down on the sugar. I don't think you need this much sugar in it. Is there a way to make the filling more creamy? Mine came out nice and fluffy, but I want it more creamy/fluffy. --- Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was excellent.  Actually, it was fairly simple to make even with baking your own ladyfingers. I will definitely make this again.

SOOOO Good!!!  I used half the sugar and it was still sweet enough.  This recipe is great because there are no raw eggs in the cream mix.

This is my "go to" recipe if I'm pulling out all the stops.  It is amazing.  I do go the extra mile with this one and make the lady fingers from scratch.  It is totally worth the effort to see people ooooo and aaaah over it, and be able to say "Yeah, I made that."  ;-)

Excellent recipe - thank you! I made this for a gathering of my in-laws, and they all agreed that it was better than any restaurant tiramisu they had ever eaten. Making the ladyfingers is definitely worth the bit of extra time.

I have made this twice, and everyone who has tried it, loves it.  I have to substitute cream cheese for marscapone, because I can't find it.  Even though it tastes great, you can tell there is a little something missing because of the cheese swap.  The best part of this recipe, is making my own lady fingers - i never new it would be this easy!

Possibly the best dessert I've ever had. The recipe makes a whole lot, so I usually make a half - even if it would not be a problem to get rid of the whole portion :-) 

Also, I usually use a litlle bit less sugar in the syrup.

I had never even tried tiramisu but needed an Italian dessert to compliment an Italian Christmas dinner.  The dinner was a huge success due, in great part, to the tiramisu. Thanks for the easy to follow instructions and a great recipe
