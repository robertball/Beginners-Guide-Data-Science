This is a Betty Crocker recipe that has the 2 eggs omitted. They should be added in the first step. My mom made these and cut them in long, thin bars and then rolled each bar in powdered sugar. One of our childhood favorites!

Impossible to make as stated in recipe.  Not nearly enough "wet" ingredients to match dry.  Obviously some typo in recipe.  I have similar recipe that uses at least 1 cup wet ingredients.
