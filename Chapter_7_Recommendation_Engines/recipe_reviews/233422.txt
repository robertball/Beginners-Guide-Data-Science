Why have I never thought of this before? This is MONEY. I followed the directions exact using dixie cups and popsicle sticks to make popsicles without actual molds. Worked out great--we loved them!

Well, this was a disaster!    I made it just like it said and my root beer sugar mix congealed.   The sugar mix turned hard as a rock in the root beer.  There was no way it was going to mix into a root beer float pop.  I don't know what happened. Sorry.
