I would give these 3 1/2 stars as written, if I could.  With a few minor tweaks these would be 5 star biscuits.  The dough was very dry and I was afraid to over work the dough (making for tough hockey puck biscuits) so I added a splash of buttermilk to bring the dough together.  Rather than roll the dough I would suggest patting it into shape on a lightly floured board.  I suggest pre-heating your oven well in advance to make sure that it really is at 400, as these come together very fast. I brushed the tops with melted butter as I don't use shortening.   15 minutes bake time was spot on and I ended up with a very tender, light biscuit.  The pumpkin adds a nice color without tasting like pumpkin.  These were great for breakfast sandwiches.  Thanks!

These are okay. Bland flavor; they need a bit of sugar and some pumpkin pie spice or cinnamon.  A dense, hearty biscuit.  Probably wouldn't make again unless I tweeked the recipe a little.

Delicious.  Didnâ€™t have maple flavouring so I used hazelnut.
