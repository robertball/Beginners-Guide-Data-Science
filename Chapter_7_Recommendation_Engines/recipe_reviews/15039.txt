While these tasted good, they spread everywhere for me. I added jam before baking on most of them, the ones I indented and baked without had no indentation left once baked. Maybe they needed more flour in the recipe. I also baked some without rolling in the nuts. They spread almost completely flat. I think it could also use some vanilla in the dough. I like the almond shortbread thumbprints better. Thanks anyway!

These are excellent. I made a batch for my choir and they were devoured within minutes. The recipe made about two dozen. There was no opportunity for the jam to fall out because the cookies never made it into a cookie jar. Also, the jam dries out a little and adheres to the cookie as it cools. I'd like to give this four and a HALF stars.

Yummy cookie.. easy to make. i had some homemade persimmon jam so I used that.  I let the dough chill several hours and  found that putting the dough back in the fridge between batches kept the cookies from spreading.  When I left the dough out, they spread more.
