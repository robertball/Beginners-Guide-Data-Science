Great recipe - we have tried many to try to imitate the corn fritters my husband's mom made - this is pretty much it! I have to admit we fried them in bacon fat - a nono for a vegetarian or the healthwise - but OH so good!I would also encourage the use of superfresh corn. Thanks for the recipe Helene!

I reduced the eggs to 3 and added onion, garlic and a dash of cayenne pepper.  These turned out light and crunchy.  Delicious.

I served these to my boyfriend as an appetizer; he was the one who rated 4 out of 5 stars.  They seemed to be a little light and airy after frying, but he did say they were very good. I used canned corn instead of the corn off the cob.  Thanks for a nice recipe Helene.

Great recipe in which to use fresh sweet corn!  I made this when the farmers were all selling corn out of the back of their pick-ups :)  As is, it needs a little more flavor, so I added some onion powder, garlic powder, and a little cayenne pepper.  We loved them with a little butter on top!

This was a let down....too bland and it had a spongy texture. I won't waste good fresh corn on this again.  If you do choose make this at least make some kind of dip to go with and add some bell pepper or something. You'll be much happier!!!

My husband *loves* this recipe and requests it all the time. I usually half the recipe when it's just the two of us and use a quart-size freezer bag of locally grown corn that we freeze ourselves. I also add some kind of onion or leek too. And since we like these served with fresh tomatoes and bacon, I usually fry them up in bacon fat. ;-)

These were fabulous and I made them with (low salt)canned corn - corn wasnâ€™t ready yet but I had a craving for corn fritters. We sprinkle sugar and butter on ours when we eat them.

I will definitely make these again. I used a bit more flour than called for, but otherwise didn't change a thing. Crispy and sweet. Excellent!

It turned out nothing like I expected, which was a crunchy little corn pancake. I would liken it to egg fu yung... a little soy sauce on it, and not bad! And yes I did add a little onion and pimiento for extra flavor.
