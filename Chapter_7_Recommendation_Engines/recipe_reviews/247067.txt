I made it with boneless pork filets and it was fantastic. My husband asks me regularly to make it now. A big hit.

very good flavor.  However, next time (and there will be a next time) I will bake longer, 45-60 minutes as the pork chops were still raw in the centers  AND make about half of the bread crumb mixture.
