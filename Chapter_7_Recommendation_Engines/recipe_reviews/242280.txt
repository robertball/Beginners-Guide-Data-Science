Very tasty! I used less celery than called for b/c of personal preference. This tasted great before I baked it so I knew this was gonna be good hot too though I could've eaten it either way lol. The whole family liked this. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing.:)

This is pretty much how my Mom made it in the 60's.  No slivered almonds, though.  Back then we were not that fancy.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's a bit of sodium overload however, with bacon and potato chips, but then you just have to eat carrot sticks and an apple the next day and hope that there's no leftover hot chicken salad in the fridge.

This is wonderful! I have been craving Hot Chicken Salad and am of the mindset that all things are better with bacon. I used a small rotisserie chicken (just the easy to get off bits:) ) regular onion since I didn't have green onion and crushed Goldfish crackers since I didn't have potato chips and it turned out fine. One can add mushrooms or water chestnuts like other recipes but this is enough for comfort creaminess & the nutty-crunch that makes hot chicken salad so wonderful. Thanks for a good recipe!
