Very nice winter side dish.  Added a few dried cranberries for a little color.  That sprinkle of cinnamon and drizzle of the maple syrup really complement the apple stuffing.  Easy to make, and tasty to eat.  Thanks, Rebecca, this is a nice recipe!

Well, I did add some things, but the basic flavors of squash, apple, cinnamon and maple syrup prevailed.  To the stuffing I added hot Italian sausage, a tablespoon of finely minced dried cranberries and 1/4 diced onion.  Stirred in some chopped celery leaves - why not?  Put buttered bread crumbs on top.

I am always on the lookout for new side dishes, especially for Thanksgiving. This is awesome on both accounts. Its simple and tastes of Autumn. I added some dried cranberries after reading the other review and it definitely fits as an ingredient. Baked the filling separate for the first 30 minutes and then combined for the last 15. The apples still had a little crisp which added texture since the squash steamed itself so tender. I did rub olive oil on the inside of the squash and added salt and pepper before baking. Served with pork loin and kohlrabi but this squash turned out the star of the plate. I can't wait to start playing with other "stuffing" ideas for this. It has definitely made me a fan of acorn squash. Thanks for the great recipe!

I'm sorry, this recipe wasn't for us. Normally, I am a big fan of sweet and savory combinations. However, the sweet apples and maple in this recipe did not combine with the onions and celery in a pleasant way at all. It was a very awkward combination of flavors.

I wanted a recipe that was different for Acorn Squash.  Well I found it. This was absolutely delicious and went along well with an Apple Smoke Pork Roast.  I will definitely make this again, but may reserve it for Easter/Christmas dinners.  I made as directed except I accidently put in sugar-free syrup before putting in the over. Came out great!!!!!

This is a winner and will be served on Thanksgiving. I added sausage to half of the filling and baked separately. The original recipe without sausage was hands down better. No changes needed, with the small addition of some salt to the squash halves before adding the stuffing. Dee-lish!

Halfway through the eating process I drizzled more maple syrup and sprinkled more cinnamon. We loved it.

I loved this! Didn't add celery because I'm not a huge fan of it but I did add some breakfast sausage. Baked at 350 for 25 min cut side down then added the filling in and baked for another 25 min. Could have gone longer, the apples were still kinda crunchy, but that's my fault. Next time I'll bake for about 35 min once the filling is in.

This was my husband's first-ever, fully-eaten acorn squash recipe!  I S&P'd the squash before baking (BTW 35 mins was even too long for our small/med squash in a gas oven)...the apple stuffing was definitely good but I think I'll play around with seasoning and potentially add some 'Homesteader Cornbread' from this site or something else for texture the next time around....we ate this with a play on the 'Butter Schnitzel' along with buttered, parmesan egg noodles.  An interesting squash twist that we'll use moving forward - thanks so much!

I'm generally not a huge fan of acorn squash but this was great! the tart apples mixed with the soft squash was perfect. while rummaging through my spice cabinet for the cinnamon I found pumpkin pie spice so I used that instead. very good, definitely will make it again. very easy, too. would make it as an impressive side for a dinner party, for sure!

Followed recipe exactly and it was perfect with the Puerto Rican Pork Roast. With 14 people over for dinner it was nice having something that can sit in a warm oven and stay fresh, waiting for everything to come together before serving.

I made this, with a couple changes.  I microwaved the squash face down for 10 minutes.   I mixed the filling & stuffed the squash, finishing with maple syrup & baking per the recipe.   I would make again, however leave the onions out. The flavor just don't fit.

I baked this yesterday with a few variations, and it was fantastic. I didn't have celery or maple syrup, so I skipped those ingredients. I also added cinnamon, and it was divine. 

I used honey crisp apples because I already had them, but I can't wait to try this again with granny smith apples. I might add a few raisins and/or pecans as well.

This was good.  Everyone enjoyed it.  I don't know if I will make it again or not.  But I will be having leftovers for breakfast and lunch tomorrow and will enjoy every bite.
