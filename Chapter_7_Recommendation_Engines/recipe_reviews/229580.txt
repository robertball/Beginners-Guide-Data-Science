The bottom of the baking dish had way too much liquid, and you’ll have to drop the batter by spoonfuls because it’s too thick to pour on the blueberries.  In the future, I will cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup in the blueberry layer, just too sweet for us, but that could be taste preference.  Grunts are easy to make, blueberries are in abundance right now, and this is a nice way to use them.  Passion to cook, we enjoyed your dessert.

This is exactly the recipe I was looking for.  It came out just like Mom's. Perfect,  with the following notes:

1) Don't add the water to the berries.  Instead add just the sugar and 1 tbsp of lemon juice,  then wait 5 min before heating.  The sugar will draw the juice out of the berries,  no water needed.   Also you can reduce the sugar by up to half if you like. 

2) The dough recipe is just perfect,  but doesn't make enough.  Double the dough recipe.  Also the milk should read UP TO  1/2 cup milk.   The dough should have to be spooned into the berries,  it should not pour.  When I used all the milk the dough came out too runny.

I took the other folks advice in that I cut the sugar that I mixed with the berries in half and didn't add water to the berries. I also doubled the topping but didn't use quite all of it. Turned out delicious!!
