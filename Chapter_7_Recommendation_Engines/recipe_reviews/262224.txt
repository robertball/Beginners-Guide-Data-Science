My entire family loved this dish.  If you don't like spicy food, you should probably cut back a little on the red pepper flakes.  It was not overwhelming, but had a bit of a kick to it.

My first attempt at using the Instant Pot was a huge success!  I stuck to the recipe except used only 2 chicken bouillon cubes, as someone mentioned 3 made their's too salty.

This is absolutely delicious! My husband and I both loved it.
The only change I made was to cut down on the amount of red pepper flakes.
Will be excellent to serve to company

Will definitely make this again.  No peppers, because my husband doesn't like them. Next time I'll thicken with flour instead of cornstarch (preferred texture). Two cups chicken broth instead of bullion. Served over linguine with parmesan sprinkled on top. Delicious.

If you prep everything in advance, this is ready in no time! The flavor was delicious, with a good kick. I skipped the corn starch, added more stock and shredded the chicken. It was great!!

This was pretty good. Oh so easy to make, the prep is easy and the Instant Pot does all the work! I used chicken breasts because that's what we eat. The celery didn't cook all the way but it was still good. I would add more tomato paste or sauce next time. Will be making again!

This recipe was really good.  I didnâ€™t have any roasted peppers, so I just left them out.  I added a can of diced tomatoes.  Really easy, just a little prep time cutting the veggies.  Done in 15 min in my instant pot.  Will definitely make it again.
