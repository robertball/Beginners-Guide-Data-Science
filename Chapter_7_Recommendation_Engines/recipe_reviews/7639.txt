I was looking for a lighter, fluffier cheesecake, similar to the one they serve at Capitol Grille.  This was it!  Because of the cream and egg whites, it is not as dense as traditional cheesecake, yet creamy and delicious.  The recipe photo that shows layers, is because the egg whites were not mixed into the batter enough.  Mix them in gently but thoroughly as instructed and you will not get layers.  I will make this again with one change - I will mix the graham crackers and butter and press it to the sides of the pan beforehand like most cheesecake recipes, rather than pouring the butter in and rolling the crumbs around.  This did not provide a thick enough crust, although it did not stick to the pan.  Overnight in the refrigerator is adequate for cooling.  Also, I used a 9" springform pan, which worked perfectly.  I fear a 8" would be too small to hold the batter.  I wrapped the bottom of the pan in tinfoil to prevent water from entering the pan and baked in a 1" waterbath.  I almost baked without a waterbath since it seems like too much work, but it really turned out perfect baking at 300 for 90 minutes exactly.

It was just OK for me. It was easy to make which really surprised me,but it tasted a lot like custard and I was looking for a thick creamy cheesecake. I was really excited because this was my first baked cheesecake and I was a bit disappointed. Neither my husband nor I were big fans of it. I don't think I will be making this again.

This cheesecake was wonderful. I am on a Low Carb diet and this worked great.  I left out the graham crackers and used Splenda in place of the sugar.  The 2 tablespoons of flour is not going to sabotage a low carb diet.  My husband liked it better than the regular cheesecakes that I make.  Of course his had to have cherries on top!

This was the first cheesecake I've ever made and got rave reviews with my dinner guests.  I didn't have enough of the heavy cream, so I upped the cream cheese to 16 oz, then did 1 C heavy cream and 1/2 C milk.  It was great - not too heavy, not to 'whipped'.  Just right!

i was asked to make a cheesecake for my managers boss, and i chose this one. when it came outof the oven it looked burnt compared to other cheesecake recipes i have used, which was kind of offputting. the only change i made was that once it had cooled, i dropped blobs of melted chocolate around the outside so that there was 1 chocolate blob per portion. it was very good, but the burnt look was a bit offputting. i would recommend cooking for 1 hour then turning the oven off and leaving the door ajar for about an hour, as is suggested in other cheesecake recipes. very tasty and deserves 5 stars for taste.

This was my first cheesecake, and I couldn't have found a better recipe. I made it for my father, and he couldn't get enough. The texture was exactly what I was looking for, not TOO creamy but not spongy either. Just perfect.
Thanks, Maureen!

Restaurant style cheesecake, not too sweet. Came out perfect! I increased the cream cheese to 16 oz. Baked as directed for 90 minutes then turned off oven and left the cake in an additional hour.

This is by far one of the best Philly style cheesecake recipes you will ever find.  I have been making Maureen's recipe for over 5 years and it has been an absolute hit every time.  If I take one to a pot luck it's gone in less that 15 minutes and I've even caught people licking the pan on more than one occasion!  One day in a rush I forgot to separate the eggs and discovered this can also be a New York style cheesecake.  If you don't like the light custardy texture of this one, just don't separate the eggs.  Bake as directed, but you will end up with that thick, creamy, stick to the top of your mouth cheesecake instead.  Either way, this recipe is a keeper!  And it really is divine without any fruit or toppings. Thank you Maureen!

Excellent cheesecake, which is the easiest I've ever baked, too. Mine turned out extra creamy and, somehow, had two layers. It was exactly as if whipped egg whites separated from the rest of the mixture while baking... This made like kind of a meringue on the top of the cheesecake, which was great. By the way, this is probably why this cheesecake look overdone even though it bakes for 60-90 minutes at 300.

This was a great recipe. I was looking for a coffee cheesecake recipe but I couldn't find one so I added 1/2 a cup of strongly brewed coffee. Also, I only had 3 eggs and 3/4 cup of heavy cream. I only had time to bake it for about an hour. Despite all the changes I had to make it was WONDERFUL!!! I'm going to try it again with the recommended amounts but try it with coffee, you will love it!

Really, really good. Easy to make, light fluffy texture. Almost too delicate, had lots of trouble cutting it, and chilled it                                                                                                                               for over 24hrs. first.  Ran a sharp knife under hot water and dried it for each cut. Any ideas or help here for slicing?

Was not a firm cheesecake. It was too soft and custard like. had a good flavor but was not like a cheesecake at all. I got compliments on it but probably will not make it again.

Tried this recipe and the family loved it. They now ask me to make one a week. I did add some blueberries to the mix so they cooked with the cheesecake. Add a blueberry sauce topping on top of that and it's like a little slice of heaven.

I made this for a labor day picnic and it was a hit.  Was fairly easy for cheesecake and it wasn't too sweet.  I did add cherry pie filling to the top because my top got too brown for my liking so I covered it up but no one seemed to notice.

Thanks for sharing.

Oh my, this cheesecake was by far the best I have ever tasted and the trick was, It was incredibly easy!!! I have never made a cheesecake before and you never would have known it by tasting the cake. I'm not the type to follow a recipe and have the end result be what was expected that's why this cake was so great. I did however follow all of allrecipe.com's cheesecake baking tips. I also added 1/2 teaspoon more vanilla extract, (by accident) and it was still so delicious. Will definitely make one every holiday. Thanks Maureen!

I am a really good baker, and this is just lame. I was looking for something quick and easy to shoot out for a party. The mix is runny. I knew it the minute I started mixing, but had no time to fix it. I would rather spend the time in advance making a better recipe.

Very good (and easy) recipe to follow.  Not sure why some reviewers had overly browned tops or ingredients seperating.  It may have been their oven temp or amount of water around the pan, etc.  When folding in the egg whites, make sure you've mixed them in completely.  Using a wooded spoon to do this thoroughly will not hurt it.  I was very pleased with the final texture and look , although it was lighter in texture than I'm used to.  I followed the directions exactly.  My only compliant was the graham cracker crust which did not work at stated.  Once the fine crumbs hit the butter, nothing else would stick.  Best bet would be to use directions for a graham cracker crust (more crumbs needed than mentioned in this recipe) and continue on from there.   Definitely a keeper for a lighter version of cheesecake with a great flavor.

This is an excellent basic cheesecake recipe.  It was just sweet enough, and had a very smooth, soft texture, yet maintained its shape nicely.

This was my first attempt at a cheesecake which I made for a going away dinner.  Everyone loved it that it wasn't too heavy and the right amount of sweetness.  I will definately make this again!

I'm going to have to disagree with majority opinion here and say that this cheesecake didn't quite work for me. It was passable, but there wasn't enough crust, and the recipe didn't state to wrap foil around the springform pan before placing it in the water bath. My top got too brown before the cheesecake was baked (this is probably the fault of my oven, though, which is quite old), and the flavor of the cheesecake itself was off, not quite sweet enough, not rich enough, a bit mushy.

This was the BEST cheesecake I've ever tasted (and I've made and eaten many cheesecakes).  Everyone who had a piece of this LOVED it.  It was just the right texture...not too light, not too heavy!  I used cinnamon graham crackers for the crust, which added a little different taste.  I'll make this again and again and again and...

This cheesecake had a good flavor and was easy to make but it wasn't the texture I was looking for. My husband and I enjoyed it though!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was the best I've ever had!  My daughter and son-in-law raved over it!  I topped it with whipped cream and fresh strawberries/blueberries.  Will be making again!

My daddy's favourite dessert is cheesecake and every year for his birthday we've always just bought one from Walmart. This year I decided to do something special and homemake one and this is the recipe I chose! It was a huge success, and everyone absolutely loved it. My sister said that it was the best cheesecake she's ever had, my dad told me to save the recipe, and my boyfriend told me I /have to make it again. The only change I made was to drop the salt and use self rising flour instead. It was absolutely wonderful!

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner, it was the 1st time I've ever made a Cheesecake from scratch I usually just buy a pre-made crust and a tub of pre-made cheese cake filling and call it done or even a box of no bake cheese cake.. But I wanted to be adventurous this year. I followed the recipe to a T except I used a glass 9'' pie pan , as I don't own a spring form pan and didn't want to go out and buy one for something I'd only use 1 or 2 times a year. 

I didn't do the "water bath" either I just baked it as  I normally would  using the oven temp and cooking time of this recipe, I didn't change any of the ingredients . It was  a HUGE hit I was lucky to even get a slice! It was nice and thick and creamy and so yummy! Everyone was disappointed when they went to get more and it was gone! I will be making it again, and I'll continue to use my glass pie pan and just bake it like a normal cake/pie (no water bath it wasn't needed!)

overall it tastes great and just like the ones I had in restaurants, but there was one tiny thing I didn't like about this recipe, which is when you add egg whites by themselves to the rest of the cream mix, and that causes your cake have egg's taste on some parts of the cream (I mixed em all thoroughly with mixer)
So my suggestion is to allocate a bit of the vanilla (like the half-spoon) to the egg white and that would make egg taste go away.

Wonderful.  Not too sweet. Light because of the whipped egg whites. I used 1 cup milk instead of cream. Today I'm trying 1/2 cup of milk. My 5 year old helps to make it and the kids love it (husband too).

I have made this recipe 2 times now and it is simply wonderful!  The beauty of it is you can do it by the steps as written or or do it backwards (like my 2nd one). Both times added fruit compote on the top. I will only use this cheesecake recipe. Note: using one reviewers advice on putting foil around the bottom so that none of the water gets into the crust.
