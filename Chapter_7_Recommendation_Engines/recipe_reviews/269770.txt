Attracted to the variety on one pan. Made this for super bowl - easy to prep before event then popped in oven for halftime. I had to cook wings and potatoes longer before adding nachos to pan to get the crispness I desired. Added cheese to potatoes when I added nachos for a little more goodness. Wing sauce has fantastic flavor. Overall a great hot app to put out for a crowd - everything was well received. Will make again!

The nachos were okay, they needed some meat. I would've grilled some yellow onions instead of using raw red onions. The wings had a great sauce, but I'd sprinkle some sesame seeds up on there.  The potatoes were on point!
