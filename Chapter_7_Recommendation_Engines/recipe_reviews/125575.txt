I thought it was very good. I ate it mixed into farina with fruit.  One thing I have to say is that it has a bad name. Reminds me of the obgyn

the taste is ok. it has a lot of vanilla in it. the thing is, when i followed the recipe, it took a lot of turns that i was not expecting. like, in the first microwaving, it bubbled over a lot. in the second microwaving, when it came out after 45 seconds, it was a bit lumpy. i dont know. i think i would microwave it for less. but besides those suprises, it was all right. and to anybody who wants to make this: you should follow the recipe even if it is a bit disproportional because it wil turn out the way it is supposed to after

This is basically rice pudding without the rice. I ate mine over fresh blueberries. Sort of like a thin custard sauce. I bet it would be great with pound cake dipped in it.

Okay, not my kind of flavour. I followed all the instructions but it came out lumpy and more like a jam then a dip.

This was delicious! I'm not sure I'd eat it with a spoon but it was really good on toast! The only thing keeping this from a five star is the time. It took a while to make and made a bit of a mess. I recommend it, but I wouldn't make it very often.

My first attempt I followed the recipe exactly and the stuffed bubbled up all over my microwave, but I tried again. It turned out thicker than I expected, so I thinned with a little more milk. Pretty good, of course my little one loved it. Served with Whole Wheat Honey Bread and sliced strawberries. I may make again, but not for awhile. Thanks for sharing.

I followed the instructions, and I didn't get any lumps at all!  I didn't have a whisk available, so I used a sturdy fork, and it still came out great.  You do have to be very careful when stirring the hot mixture into the eggs, else you get scrambled eggs.  ;)
