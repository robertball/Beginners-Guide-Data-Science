I couldn't bring myself to add BBQ sauce because the thought of BBQ sauce and feta was just too weird for me me so I made them more Italian flavored by leaving out the BBQ sauce and corn. I used fresh tomatoes so the liquid from cooking the tomatoes down was plenty to keep the turkey from drying it. I also added chopped brown mushrooms, fennel, fresh Italian parsley, thyme, and red pepper flakes. Just prior to baking I pressed a ball of mozzarella into the middle for a little cheesy surprise. I would definitely make them the same way because they turned out great.

Thought this was delicious! Made it more healthy & tastier by: Reducing olive oil to 1 tbsp. Adding 2 cloves garlic (minced) with onion Replacing water with low sodium chicken broth Removing corn Replacing diced tomatoes with fresh sliced grape tomatoes (about 20) Removing fennel/ replaced with 1/2 tsp. of cumin Added large bunch of fresh chopped basil Replaced white rice with brown rice (meant adding at that point 2 cups of chicken broth & simmering 45 min in total vs. 15) Removing bbq sauce. To speed up time that I lost from changing rice, I cooked at 350 convection roast for 30 min. Turned out perfect & I will definitely make this again!

Very good! The ingredients all came together nicely.  I did make a handful of changes.  I left out the corn and replaced it with chopped fresh mushrooms.  Added garlic salt and a couple tablespoons of worcestershire to season the ground turkey. I also went with a half cup of rice and probably could have gone to 3/4 cup.

Excellent, and contrary to what others may say, pretty easy to throw together.  I left out the fennel seeds and replaced the feta with a smaller amount of shredded sharp cheese because that is what I had.  Already planned to make this again.  It will make more filling than 6 peppers.

I tried this last night for the first time.  the feta smelled amazing when it was cooking.  I think next time I would add a little garlic (just because I am a garlic fan and I think it would add a good taste)

This was a great mid week dinner!  Not the fastest meal to put together but it was worth it.   I added fresh garlic, chili paste, fresh spinach and fresh diced tomatoes as I didn't have canned diced tomatoes.  As a side dish, I added Honey Corn bread and had many compliments!  Will make again!!!

This was a delicious low carb recipe, my husband and his dad loved it. The Feta really adds flavor and I used ground turkey which kept it at a healthy fat content. will definitely be making this again!

I think this is a really really good, fun and easy recipe. Easy to follow the directions, time consuming yes, but anything worth waiting for is! Simply delicious! Everyone at work the next day was jealous of my left overs! I couldn't find any fennel so I didn't add it. I did add 2 tbl. of Liquid Aminos (soy sauce substitute) b/c i put liquid aminos in/on everything! My boyfriend had leftovers and shared them with his boss, who then made the same recipe! Good job, lots of us will be making and enjoying this again and again!

We really liked this!  I used chicken broth and brown rice.  And I always drop the cleaned green peppers in boiling salted water for a minute and drain them before stuffing.  The sweet and smokey BBQ sauce really made the dish!

Not at all a fan of fennel.  Pretty decent other than that, but I cannot get past that flavor!

Wow these may be the best Stuffed Peppers I've ever found!
I changed 2 things, I used red peppers instead of green (taste preference...) and I didn't use the fennel seeds. Not because I didn't want to... I couldn't find them anywhere!
The pepper stuffing is outstanding, you almost don't need the peppers! It makes for a great stew.
I will definitely make this again.

This was a great alternative to the traditional stuffed peppers.  My husband doesn't eat tomatoes or tomato sauce.  This was an excellent Tex-Mex style dinner.  I used cheddar cheese because that is what I had at home.  I also added black beans in addition.  It was WONDERFUL and my husband LOVED it!  Thank you

Great change up from your usual stuffed green pepper.  I especially loved the herbs in this recipe. The fennel seed makes a pleasing taste along with the rosemary and the thyme. I did not add the corn and it was not missed. Actually had corn on the side. I used 2 cans of healthy tomato soup and added some steak sauce to that and mixed it. It made a great sauce to put over the peppers.

Excellent flavors!  I cut up the green peppers and placed them at the bottom of the dish, then added everything else on top.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This sooooo good, just the way the recipe is! I know feta and bbq sauce sound like strange additions but they are perfect, giving the filing a sweet tang. I've also made this as a soup by adding pepper slices and either chicken or beef broth to the filling mixture and letting it simmer for 15-20 min. more.

USED LEFT OVER BAKED TURKEY, and it was awesome.  I followed the recipe for everything else.  I thought the bbq sauce would be weird but I hardly even noticed it in the final product.  The smell of all of those spices cooking together was amazing.  I really thought all the spices and the peppers would make an over whelming flavor but in the end it was nice, really blended well.

Fantastic!  This was fun to make and so beautiful to serve!  The turkey makes it more healthy and I love the variety of veggies, rice and sauce!  I was hesitant about the BBQ sauce but it really brought everything together!  The feta cheese is a bonus!  Even our daughter ate a whole one (she is age 8) and I sent some to my parents, too.  I was hesitant about the amount of fennel seeds but in the end, it was perfect.

This was surprisingly wonderful and a big hit. I was nervous to add the BBQ sauce, but it made the flavor really delicious. I used chicken broth instead of water, left out the fennel and used fresh tomatoes instead of canned. I also added a 1/3 cup of quinoa, which in hind site wasn't necessary. I particularly liked that the peppers weren't par boiled first. They were cooked perfectly.  I also added I little more feta to the top and only cooked for 30 mins. Served with steamed broccoli and a fresh garden salad. Divine! Great recipe, I will definitely be making again.

I very seldom follow recipes exactly but I thought for a change I would. I should have stuck with my instinct and not added the fennel, this spice has a very distinct taste and for us did not suit the type of dish it was going into. I will not make this again.

Very good recipe, even my kids liked it.  The only change I made was to use less fennel.  I thought the rosemary and thyme that was recommended was the perfect amount.  I really liked the feta cheese in this recipe.  Will definitely make it again.

i made it in a casserole dish. broiled the peppers for about 3 to 4 minutes to soften them. cut them into quarters and put them in the dish and put the stuff on top. i used fresh tomatoes that i peeled and chopped, skipped the bbq sauce, and added cooked brown rice in with the turkey, onion and feta. I loved the fennel seeds.

These weren’t anything special, but they were okay. I might use a different cheese next time, like mozzarella, instead of the feta. I made the filling ahead of time so I just assembled and baked the night we ate it.

I thought it was great! The blend of spices, bbq sauce, and feta are things I would never imagine mixing together, but they totally worked. I did nothing to change the recipe. In the future, I might cook the rice separate and then add it because I never get the rice to cook perfectly (especially since I reduced the recipe to 1 serving).

My family loves this I make it just like it says. Sometimes I used colored bell peppers and it's great and I couldn't find the crushed fennel so I use fennel seeds. Love it love it so do my kids and that is a big deal.

Not sure which spice we didn't like, so will make again without  spices.

Ok, only use s&p and a little basil. Excellent!

This is one of my favorite recipes on the site and my boyfriend begs me to make it. :) I omit the onion when making it for him. Otherwise, I don't change a thing. So amazing!

Trying to eat healthier and since I usually stuff my peppers with sausage I decided to try this recipe. I made very few changes. I added a few cloves of chopped garlic because I love garlic. I used Italian seasoning instead of the thyme, rosemary and fennel seeds. I added a little cayenne pepper. I omitted the corn as it just didn't sound good to me. I was going to omit the barbecue sauce simply because so many reviewers did but I came across a review that said the barbecue sauce made the dish so at the last minute I added it. I thought the barbecue sauce added a nice touch. I prepared a tomato sauce with a little garlic and Parmesan cheese to pour over the peppers before serving. They were delicious. I'll definitely make them again.

Amazing!!! This is the first time I made this and I made a few changes... I used basil oregano diced tomatoes which added extra flavor, I did not use the barbecue sauce and instead of cooking the rice in the pan i added precooked brown rice (omitting  the extra water).  I added a heaping pile of finely chopped spinach as well. I thought the turkey mixture could use a little more flavor so i added a generous amount of garlic powder.  Absolutely amazing everyone loved it!!!

It was ok, but just not my cup of tea.  My husband and I both thought it was a bit bland except for the fennel.  I was a good sport and tried using the fennel even though it sounded like a lot, but if I made this recipe again, I would be tempted to leave it out all together and use minced garlic instead. Ours also came out almost unbearingly sweet.  Some people might be ok with that but I was looking for something a little more meaty for dinner time.  I think it was the combo of the corn and bbq sauce that put it over the top for me. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly except I left out fennel and I added some additional spices. It came out amazing!  My boyfriend was really impressed and liked the bbq sauce in it.

Did not add the fennel as we do not care for fennel.  Stuffed bell peppers are a staple in our house but these did not work. I will eat the leftovers but hubby will not.

I cut the recipe down to serve two people. And left out the seasonings except the fennel seed. I thought it was great but my hubby didn't like it at all. He has no taste :)I got two servings of it that night!

This was a fairly easy recipe for a weeknight dinner. I didn't have fennel and I should have used more rosemary and thyme to compensate. I used more cheese than the recipe called for and I will make this again. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

This recipe was great for what I had around the house. I had just enough peppers and feta to do 3 servings. I would personally cut back on the fennel some--but that is because I'm not a big fan of it. I also would add some more cheese than it calls for. All things considered it was a good recipe. I will try it again.
