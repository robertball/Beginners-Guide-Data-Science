I personally would have given this recipe only three stars where it not for the fact that my friends raved over these wings.  I made them for the super bowl and followed the recipe exactly.  The taste was good but I felt that the soy sauce was a little overpowering and the hot sauce taste was not strong enough.  The sauce was also a little runny and not as spicy as I would have liked.  I prefer a rich and hearty sauce with a little extra bite to it.  When I make these again (which my fiends will kill me if I don't) I wont actually cut down on the soy sauce used but instead double the amount of hot sauce used and possibly melt some butter into the sauce as well.

These are very very good!  Since it was early Feb., I decided to try this inside the house instead of on the grill-simmering on the stovetop, then baking in the oven for 10 minutes at a time.  It turned out very good, and they were a big hit with the family!

Wonderful Wings! Before placing the wings in the sauce, I rubbed them down with salt & papper, garlic powder & cayenne pepper. This seemed to give them that extra little punch. My guest raved about them and could not stop eating them. Everyone left with the recipe in hand. Thank you so much for sharing this with us!

I love your recipe but I think  for safety reasons ,you should put aside the sauce for dipping and eating , You should use sauce that you have set aside to dip the raw chicken and then put on the grill. then the sauce that you have put aside for eating you can use for after the chicken is done for dipping.

This is an awesome recipe... My husband and I love buffalo hot wings and I was looking for something different to make.  These wings hit the spot!!  I used more hot sauce and a little less coke because we LOVE our wings spicy.  Thanks for the recipe.

A little work but worth it!Try using CHERRY COKE and adding a little honey(but watch it carefully on the grill, it will burn easy).

These wings turned out great.  Dip in the sauce one last time for hot wings, serve dry for medium wings.

Good wings! For those who are worried about putting cooked chicken back in the sauce that raw chicken was in, as long as the sauce is kept simmering, it is no different from cooking raw chicken in a sauce for 1 hour.

Turned out great.  Not as spicy as I normally like, but definately a lot better than deep frying.

This was a very good starter of a recipe to be used on any kind of chicken.. I marinated some split breasts and legs for about an hour in the sauce(minus the soy..)I added Weber cajun seasoning and a couple pats of butter to it. I then baked in the oven till about 3/4 of the way done..foiled lined pan sprayed with cooking spray.. handed over to hubby to put on the grill and while he was doing that I made an additional batch of sauce for him to baste while cooking..this was one of the BEST version of chicken we have had in a while.. all my guests loved it!

AWESOME WINGS! I just moved away from my favorite place to get wings. And we missed them. But now we can make them even better at home for about 1/5 the price. Thanks

This is an excellent Buffalo wing recipe for the grill. Since I live in Buffalo I know the flavor and consistency of a good wing ;) I used my backyard fire pit, all wood, no charcoal. Couple modifications: instead of Coke, use 1 1/2 tablespoons of molasses. Add 2 tablespoons of lime juice and 1/2 cup more of Louisiana hot sauce. (Never EVER use Tobasco for Buffalo wings.. for shame!!) Texas style hot sauce is good too. No need tpo cook the sauce.. just mix it up and go. Slow cooked them for an hour and a half turning and brushing sauce on them.. enjoy..

First time making these wings.  Had 1.7# of wings (16 wing pieces), which was about right for an adult male.  I also had a spinach salad and celery with ranch dressing.  I made a full recipe of the sauce.  I heated the sauce with the wings on the stove while the grill was pre-heating; then transferred the pan to the grill on high which seemed to keep the sauce simmering.  I grilled the wings for 5 minutes on a side, turned and grilled for an additional 5 minutes, then transferred the wings to the sauce for 5 minutes.  I repeated this 15-minute cycle for one hour and then served the wings wet.  I used Trappy’s Louisiana Hot Sauce, but will try something a little hotter next time.  The sauce did evaporate but didn’t really thicken.  A very good sauce flavor did seem to permeate through the wings.  I made this again (Third time) with the following additions: 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, 1/2 teaspoon Cajun Seasoning, 1+ teaspoon garlic powder.  1/2 cup Trappy’s Louisiana hot sauce, 1/2 cup Frank’s Original Hot Sauce.  Hotness was just right (I like hot).  The sauce thickened at the end to just the right consistency and the wings were done to perfection.  Note that I did change my burner, briquettes and grate recently and got a much better heat distribution than when I earlier reviewed this recipe. 5 stars for sure!  GREAT – Thanks!!

I really, really, really, REALLY wish that well meaning cooks would not rate a recipe they have not tried, especially just for the sake of blasting the recipe/ingredients/method because it does not fit their life style.  Very irritating.  Please get over the need to preach and just move on to a recipe more to your liking.

GREAT wings, by the way!

Love It!!!  I followed the recipe, but added a little crushed garlic.  The flavor was great.  It had a nice medium heat, your lips tingled, but you didn't get burned, and it didn't overpower the other flavors, you got the sweet from the cola, the garlic & the chicken still came through. I let the pan of sauce come to a simmer before adding the chicken and by the end it was down to a really nice glaze, we ran the wings through it after they came off the grill & it was perfect.  It is a little time consuming, but it's easy (like guy easy).  I used an aluminum foil pan, so scrubbing the grill was the only clean-up.  To me it was a lot less work & clean-up than breading & frying wings.  Will make again & again.

It is January 8th here in Louisiana and yes I'm using the grill outside because it's nearly 80 degrees!  This was my first attempt at ever cooking hot wings and I definitely wanted to do something besides fry.  I found this recipe and it is awesome!!  I only had Frank's wing sauce on hand since I bought it when I was shopping sometime back.  Will definitely use again and thanks!!

A Word of WARNING: Be sure to bring the sauce to a simmer, otherwise it breaks a paramount food-safe rule when working with raw chicken. NEVER return your cooked chicken to the same sauce that has or has had raw chicken in it!

Having it simmering on the side of the grill will reduce the risk, but I still prefer to cook the wings until they are crispy and then coat in sauce for the last few minutes.

I've only given it two stars, because it is some of the variations that others have suggested that make this recipe work. The recipe on its own is not that great.

I much prefer Franks Red Hot/butter/vinegar/ and a little sugar to taste (coke might work! - I'll have to try that!) Two stars for the suggestion of using coke in the sauce!

These wings were wonderful! Just enough kick...used Frank's Red Hot and left out soy sauce to reduce sodium, will add next time to try but tasted yummy w/o it. Used foil pan and made it super easy for clean up. Did wings on med grill 10 min on direct heat 3 min in pan w/ sauce on grill back on for 10 min etc...for an hour. Tasted great!

This is the recipe I'm using from now on!  We always grill.  That's a given. The fact that I didn't have to marinate or rub the wings ahead of time is what made this recipe appealing.  That I can do this with STILL FROZEN wings is even better.  It's much less of a production when I get a hankering for hot wings. I had two concerns when I read the recipe. My first concern was that I was afraid the cola would take the "heat" out of the hot sauce.  This was not the case at all. These were plenty hot! Second, I didn't know if I would feel good about using the simmering sauce as a final coat of sauce.  But by the time my chicken was crisp and ready, the sauce had boiled for over an hour.  There is no chance that any salmonella could survive that amount of heat for that long.  Simmering the wings in the sauce adds a ton of depth to the flavor, and color as well.  Recipes like this really take the fun out of going out eat for wings, because these are WAY better and less expensive than any restaurant!

Really liked the idea of using coke in wings, but I tweaked the original recipe and love the way I do them now. People are always asking for the sauce, and we've found it goes well on burgers and hotdogs... here's how i changed it:

3 lbs chicken wings
3 parts Kosher salt, 1 part cracked pepper, 1 part garlic powder (or just Garlic Southern Flavor if you have it) - just enough to sprinkle evenly over the cut wings

Sauce:
12 oz Coke - go ahead and open it, so it'll flatten out a little. you just want the sugar/flavor not the fizz
1 bottle Trappy's Louisiana hot sauce
1 cup Frank's Original hot sauce
0.5 teaspoon Cayenne pepper
1.5 tsp Cajun Seasoning (like Emerald's or Tony Chachere's)
.5 tsp black pepper
1.5 tsp garlic powder
1 stick of butter 
1 tablespoon Worcestershire
3 tbs white vinegar

We love wings at our house and these were out of this world. The disposable pan is a must. I could have tripled the recipe and there still wouldn't have been leftovers. You won't believe how good these are until you try them. Not as spicy as some may want, but good for the general gathering.

I grilled even for 1 hour but it didn't taste much. So I needed to put some mayo with the buffalo wings...
I was quite disappointed. I marinated first for a few hours, maybe I should have grilled right away after I marinated it with the batter? I couldn't finigh the wings yesterday, so I will probably use the rest to make pasta this evening.

I fried the wings without batter and used the sauce at the end to coat them.  I also added a little honey to thicken the sauce.  WONDERFUL.  I have told everyone at work about this simple, delicious wing sauce.

I made these for dinner tonight. I followed this recipe as written except for using more of both peppers. I also used a 4 pound bag of wings that I had extra from an experiment that didn't turn out a couple of months ago where we tried different ways of baking them. I love wings but not all the fat that comes with frying them so baking was tried and not successful at all. I was very excited to find this recipe in my inbox the other day and knew I had to try them with the ones I had since I knew I had all the ingredients except to pick up a can of pop. 

I started them with the wings frozen and let them soak while the grill was heating up. My grill isn't big enough for all of the wings and the bowl, so I rotated half the wings at a time on the grill with the other half simmering. The sauce thickened up and reduced down nicely and the wings browned up very nicely (actually some looked like they were burnt but they weren't). 

I was a bit skeptical because of the failed baking experience, but I really enjoyed these and will DEFINITELY make them again. I actually enjoyed these more than I should have since I ate a bit too many and am now stuffed!! :) I have some really spicy sauce from the local wing place, and I think this is a good recipe to use it up in since just a little bit will add enough spice without it being too much since I thought the original recipe could use a bit more spice. 

All in all a DEFINITE keeper!!!!

BEST WINGS EVER!!! I was looking for an easy recipe for wings and came across this...I used Frank's Red Hot Wings Sauce - Buffalo Style and a can of Pepsi and left out everything else. I also used the bagged wings. We coated aluminum foil with olive oil for the grill and used one of those throw-away aluminum pans for the sauce for easy clean-up. The Pepsi made the wings kinda sweet, and I thought they weren't going to be hot enough, but then the hot sauce kicked in perfectly! These WILL be made again...SOON!

I followed the recipe exactly and people couldn't get enough of them.  In the week following the initial use of the recipe I had to make the wings about 8 different times because of the demand.  The flavor of the sauce is great, and is in my opinion, one of the tastiest wing sauces I have ever had.  Everyone that ate the wings said they liked the wings more sloppy then they did dry, so that was the popular way to serve them.  Will continue to make these wings as long as there is chicken to make it with.

I followed the recipe precisly.  A huge disappointment! With the ratings, this is obviously a desired receipe for many.  However, to me, they tasted boiled and inadequately flavored and spiced.  So, I'll stick with the oven or grill.

I'm giving you 4 stars for impressing the boyfriend so much.  I however use butter, Louisiana hot sauce, pepper and a dash of minced dried onions and a little soy sauce, maybe a little beer too.  I just keep em on the grill and slather with sauce every 8 minutes or so and turn em each time.  My result is drier on the outside so it is crispy, the soda seems to make em not crunchy at all but they are moister.  It's personal preference, I like crispy and he likes moist.

AWESOME! I had no idea that wings could be so good off the grill. This recipe is definitely a keeper - and we can't wait to make them again. Perfectly written instructions - and incredible as is. You must try this one.

I loved this. I love that I get the same satisfaction of eating a greasy fried chicken wing but for so much less fat! These were awesome. They were simple to prepare. I used 1/2 buffalo flavored sauce and 1/2 pepper sauce. I also used Dr.Pepper. I could just taste a hint of the soy sauce and I am glad I added it because I think thats what takes it beyond just hot sauce on some chicken. I used 7 chicken thighs and all of the sauce. This was great thank you!

Very very good. I might add a little bit of honey to the mix next time. The recipe will make mild wings, if you like it hot, add more wing sauce. All in all, the best wings I have ever made on a bbq!

This was awesome! I was a little apprehensive at first, the sauce was really thin, but after simmering for a while it was thick enough to make the wings perfectly saucy when I served them. I also baked mine in the oven rather than on the grill. Defiantly a keeper!!

I'd give this 4.5 stars if I could.  This turned out great.  After 2 pieces of chicken, it got a little too sweet for me, but it worked out good, because my husband likes a sweeter sauce.  I was impressed.

These are awesome. Work, yes, but isn't most good food? People are so used to whacking open a cardboard box and throwing frozen processed 'food' into the oven that they forget how to make a real (tasty and healthy) meal. The wings weren't greasy and not too spicy. I liked that I could easily pull off excess chicken skin that I didn't want to eat. I will make these again and again.

These were extremely tasty, very messy but so good.  You do have to watch them closely on the BBQ so they don't burn too much.  Using the hot sauce is deceiving, they really are not that spicy, just a bit of a bite but my 10 yr.old son who won't eat anything spicy loved them.

These wings are delicious! I made them for a family gathering, and everyone has been asking me to make them again. I used the small, party style wings that weren't frozen, so it took less time on the grill. They are very tasty on the George Foreman grill if you're making it during the winter months. I used a can of diet cherry Dr. Pepper because I liked the flavor that the cherry adds, and I wanted to cut back a few calories by using diet. I also added about 3 tablespoons of margrine to it and about 1 1/2 cups hot sauce to make it spicer. The soy sauce is a little on the strong side, next time I'd use 1/2 a tablespoon instead a whole. Very tasty wings!

This was an incredibly delicious recipe!! My husband LOVED them and was looking forward to the leftovers the next day (maybe about 6 wings left between three of us). Very easy recipe with lots of heat. Excellent dipped in blue cheese dressing. Will definitely make again.

I made these this weekend and everyone loved them.  I doubled the recipe, used lime d. coke and d. coke.  Rubbed the chicken with garlic and will make this again!

Very good, not too spicy just medium hot. Made the recipe just as it is and seemed just right. I used regular soda not diet. I think this is important. I don't think that diet soda would give the sauce the stickiness that makes this recipe so good.

Hubby made these last night and they are awesome.  Did not have Louisiana hot sauce used red hot and they just fell of the bone and melted in your mouth.  This will be how we make our wings from now on, no more deep fried greasy wings.  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! Just need to get the hubby to not get sidetracked, ended up burning one side!

they were excellent...yes for you less then proficient grill masters this can be a little challenging because you aren't making soup/ its sauce, a rue if you will..
I used half my grill with the gas on one side when grilling the wings, and the other just put the sauce and wings all in a cast iron skillet with some oak smoldering under it ...and did as the recipe says ...the secret is to keep the sauce bubbling and stirred while the wings are on the grill roasting. dip/ roast, dip/roast,.. and there ya go 2 thumps up form the Captain and yes Ive ate and made alot of wings!

Very good recipe.  I used Dr. Pepper because I like the fruity taste.  Also added one diced Chipotle pepper (in Adobo) to ratchet up the heat and a tsp. of garlic powder.  Everyone loved them!!

great recipe. i doubled the servings and they came out perfect. i used Franks Red Hot and the heat intensified. will use a little butter to cut the heat. these are a lot of work, but waaaayyy better than deep fried and dipped in sauce.

very very good, i would recommend doubling the sauce, so you have room for error. it is a little time consuming and requires a lot of attention on the grill. the tast was amazing i used franks hot sauce. will make again!!!

I used Frank's Red Hot as that is the only hot sauce I will use.  I did not marinate then return to sauce as I was worried about contamination.  I made two pots, one to cook in then after grilling put in the fresh stuff.  Awesome task although a bit hot for me, I would leave out the cayenne pepper.  After eating three of us got sick, not sure what that means but I am not trying it again.  I am going back to baking, grilling, then smothering in Franks.

I have been making a similar recipe for years but I use Franks Red Hot sauce. Chicken comes out soo much better. Put the finished wings on a platter to serve family style and garnish with celery and carrot sticks around the edge. Toss some crumbled bleu cheese over the chicken too.

Fantastic!!!!  I loved this recipe.  I'm on the South Beach Diet, so I used a Diet Coke and added about 1/4c Sugar-Free Maple Syrup.  It was great!!  Next time I'm making it a little bit spicier, and that will probably be sometime this week because I can't wait..

@Jim
The recipe doesn't say how long to put the wings in the sauce between grillings, so that may be confusing..  So, I just dipped them and put them back on the grill on about a medium temp.  Don't boil the wings.  The sauce dries and the chicken cooks, and you get multiple layers of dried sauce.  I actually boiled the sauce to thicken it before I even started grilling, which helped as well I think.

Did this with drummies tonight in the oven. Five minutes in the sauce then 10 minutes in the oven, back and forth, for about 45 minutes.  I was on the phone and my husband gave me the thumbs up so that says it all.  Served right in the sauce to get all the flavor.  A little ranch dressing and a lot of napkins made it complete.

Absolutely delicious!  My husband substituted his favorite hot sauce (the Blazing Sauce from Buffalo Wild Wings) instead of the Louisiana hot sauce.  I made a separate batch for me and the kids (we don't care for foods too spicy), I substituted bbq sauce instead of the hot sauce and omitted the cayenne pepper.  Both batches of wings turned out great!  We will definitely be making these many, many more times!

I expected hotter wings. Considering the volume of hot sauce called for, I'm surprised the wings were so mild. My other gripes are that, 1) the sauce seems too thin and as such, doesn't adhere to the wings, and 2) it's a hassle and time consuming to keep moving the wings from the grill to the pot and back again. On a positive note, the flavor is pretty good. After all, grilled chicken is pretty good, but if I use this recipe again, I will modify a few things.

We made this recipe as is.  Excellent! 5 Stars!  I do have to say that I will not give up my breaded, deep fried wings, that we occasionally prepare.  Comparing good, old, deep fried wings and these wonderful grilled wings are 2 separate animals!  Had a small problem with the wings falling through the grate and the meat falling off the bone so we will try whole wings, not cut up, the  next time.  He also put them all on the grill for the final cook time and ended up basting the wings for the last 8 minutes.  Definitely going to have these again.  Ranch dressing and celery sticks on the side for dipping and a good cold beer.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This recipe worked great the only thing is that I kinda scorched the outside of the wings a little and I am not sure if the burntness added to the deliciousness of the wings or what. I made a few adjustments to the recipe for my own tasting and it was 1/2 tsp of Cayenne (this added just the right amount of heat) and 3/4 tsp of garlic powder. Also if you reduce the sauce it becomes very good as one last tossing in the sauce to add the heat and flavor.

This was a great recipe.  However, I did make a few changes.  First off, I used a deep disposable turkey roaster for easy clean-up.  Secondly, I eliminated the Coke and used beer instead (Miller Lite).  Also I added minced garlic.  They turned out great!  I also tried this with chicken legs, they weren't as crispy as the wings.  Definitely recommend using wings.

The flavors of these wings were really excellent (much better than expected from hot sauce and coke!). I took these on a camping trip and couldn't get enough of them! I made the marinade according to recipe, and added some fresh garlic and ginger for extra flavor. Marinated it for 2 days before taking it on the camping trip. I didn't do the thing with cooking the sauce on  top of the grill, just grilled the wings and brushed them a couple times with the sauce while grilling. The saltiness was just right for me, but could use more cayenne pepper or fresh chiles next time, since it wasn't spicy enough for me.

Absolutely the best!  Made these for a football party a year ago and they're still talking about it.  First time I tried it at home and it was very salty....I deleted soy sauce and I use the Mexican Coke (real sugar) and Frank's Red Hot, and it was a hit!  Love 'em!!

I have made these wings several times. I will make them the day before and put them in the crockpot. Reheating the next day. They tend to be a bit more spicy from sitting overnight but they are so good. I found using the crockpot a great time saver on the day of the party. Wings are already cooked and ready to go.

Awesome recipe! You can mix up the ingredients to your own tastes, but this method of cooking the wings is the best by far. Take a little time and enjoy your grill, these wings will blow your mind. Have turned these on to many friends and family members!

These wings are great.   We always go out for hot wings and have never found a recipe at home that tastes as good.  This one is wonderful.   The whole family loved it.

I don't keep soda at home, so improvised and used a sweet molasses type BBQ sauce. Just used a little and it gave a nice slight sweetness for us, we're not huge fans of too much sweet. I will try it with cola sometime. Because I changed the ingredients, my rating is based mostly on the cooking technique, which I think kept the wings flavorful and moist! You do have to tend to the chicken so might not be great for a quick weeknight meal. Great for the weekends though, just grab a beer and turn on some good music and they are done before you know it!

Made sauce just as the recipe said except that I used a diet cola. Our grill wouldn't work so I baked the wings in the oven instead - 10 minutes in the oven at 350, 5 minutes in the sauce.  Enjoyed immensely.  Really cut downon Points Plus value for Weight Watchers,  Will make again and again.

Pretty good, although with all the simmering the texture became a little too fall off the bone.  The flavor was really good though.

Great recipe in that I could put the wings in the sauce frozen; which I did! Simmered on the stove until the grill was ready! Oh, substituted Dr.Pepper for Cola....I know, it sounds too sweet, but I used the bottled sauce that came in a thick variation. Soy was no issue as it, too cut the sweetness.
Grilled for 5-7 minutes, then back in the sauce.
, these were good!,

These wings were fabulous...a little time consuming but well worth it!! I only had a diet coke so I used that and they had a salty taste to them, it was not the soy because I forgot that. Will definately be making again and sharing this one. Thanks!!!!

Never had this recipe with cola but willing to try.  I usually pre cook the wings for 15 min in my oven then pour some of my hot sauce over them in a bowl, cook them on the grill, then return to the remaining sauce and toss.

These are excellent wings.  We soaked the wings in the mixture for about 30 minutes and then grilled the wings on our Big Green Egg to brown them.  The sauce is thin so while wings were cooking I thickened the sauce with corn starch.  I cooked the sauce and wings for 20 more minutes in a cast iron bean pot on the Egg.

Have been using a version of this recipe for 20 plus years. My parents brought it back from a remote village in Alaska. No BBQ Sauce so they used Ketchup, Coke and onion. In addition to BBQ also put sauce and wings or drum sticks into baking dish and bake in oven. Best thing about this recipe is you can add whatever spices you want to the recipe and make it as mild to hot as you want.

I had never made wings before these but, these were easy and delicious! My husband loves them too! The sauce didn't thicken as much as I would have liked so I did the following on the stove top after the wings were done on the grill. Take a half cup of water and stir in some cornstarch. Heat the wing sauce until it starts to boil then add the water/cornstarch mix and stir until it thickens. Just like you would to make a gravy. We take these to all of the neighborhood potlucks and there are never any leftovers.

I love these bad boys but I don't grill them.... I hot smoke them in my gas smoker (or use a Weber set up as a smoker, coals to one side with boiled water and wood chips in an aluminum bad to smoke 'em, and the saucy wingettes on the "cool side".) As for the sauce, I have a wok ring to simmer it down on my barbie island. Sure the skin would be a little soggy if this were all I did, but right after the last dip, I finish them with direct heat (I use my gas sear zone but you can toss them on directly over the coals in a Weber) to crunch up the skin. Crispy outsides, moist insides... this is a taste of heaven, if Bobby Flay were catering!

Tried this recipe out yesterday and the wings turned out great!  I added a little more hot sauce and cayenne pepper to the mix which gave the wings a pretty good kick! Will definitely be making again.

This was a simple and easy recipe!  The sugar makes everything burn a lot quicker which is my only complaint.  By keeping the sauce on the grill it reduces very quickly and the sauce burns over medium heat because of the sugar from the soda.  I added a cup or so of water throughout to keep the sauce going.

I really liked this recipe!  It was delicious and tasty and the sauce was simply delicious!  I think that the chicken didn't really get anything out of being on the grill honestly, I was expecting a subtle smokey flavor but all that I tasted was the sauce.  None the less, it was delicious.

I have NEVER thougth about making wings at home but let tell you these were a HUGE hit.  Because I have younger ladies in the house I did make a "sisssy" sauce of store brand bbq sauce and honey and these were almost gone...only one left!  Because I am a bit lazy and Sunday meals, which is when this was cooked, is happy hour day, I baked the two different batches with the sauce for about 30 minutes in the oven.  Then I placed them on the grill, basting them in the sauces between turns, until we had the right amount of crispiness.  I have to say they were wonderful!!! The flavors of this sauce is wonderful...just when you think you might be getting more heat than you can handle everything calms down!!  These are really great and will be added to our finger lickin' good weekend dinner rotation!!!

These were great!  I love wings, but the fried part always prevents me from making them at home. I was really excited to try these, and they went fast.  For the hot sauce, I ended up using a mixture of three different kinds to use them up...still tasted great! Definitely a keeper.

These were great--I did add just a small amount of melted butter to the sauce.

Great Recipe....also try to pour some bbq sauce in the same pan and dip them once or twice in that sauce after the hot sauce is about done....makes for a great spicy & sweet combination!!!

Phenomenal! Not sure why the others found this too mild. I'm an Indian with an Indian's palate & found this so spicy I had to leave out the cayenne. I add a generous amount of garlic powder to the sauce & up the cola to about a 20oz bottle. Never imagined cola in a recipe like this! Is one of my keepers & I've made this about 10 times since finding the recipe last year & have shared it with others who love it too!

These are excellent.  You have to be patient to get them falling off the bone good (I use a tin from the dollar store I guess its approx 9x13 or so - get the wings to a simmer point for a while - then wings back and forth (out of the bath wings on the grill both sides for a while (5 minutes or so per side) - then back in the bath) (keep a tinfoil cover on the tin to keep the sauce simmering) - I like to cook them on medium heat which will cool down to medium - low at the end of the grilling process so you don't burn the wings when on the coals (about an hour or so).  A couple libations - watching the Packer game with family and friends (small tv in the garage) - grilling wings - doesn't get much better than that!

These wings are great!  They taste better than most restaurants fried wings and I think they'd have to be better for you.  I was worried that the sauce might be to soupy as some other reviewers had mentioned, but if you follow the directions and continue to heat the sauce on the grill (or side burner) while rotating the wings between the sauce pan and the grill, the sauce will reduce to a very thick consistency by the time you're done.  I had one sub, and that was chipotle powder for cayenne because my wife picked up the wrong thing.  I can't decide if I'll try the cayenne next time or stick with the chipotle which was delicious.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I don't think I'd have thought of doing wings like this without it.

I rubbed down chicken with Virgin Olive Oil and salt/pepper the day before and refrigerated. I then wrapped chicken in foil and smoked with hickory chips (low heat) for 2 hours..Doubled measurements for ingredients,mixed and put in large tin pan, added chicken and set pan in grill and let simmer on low heat..Used tonges to take chicken out of pan and place onto direct heat of grill rotating chicken every 6 to 8 minutes..There were 8 people and 10 pounds of chickens wings/legs and nothing but bones left over..An awesome recipe,not to hot..just enough kick to still enjoy the meat without overpowering the flavor..

I love traditional style wings, but I am looking for more healthy alternatives.  This is it.  Great taste!  The Coke base is the key.  Many southern recipes use Coke, so I was glad to see this ingredient.  I cut back a little on the heat, so the kids would eat them.  The kids loved them.  Thanks for the recipe.

If I could give this 10 stars, I would, all my husband could say was "these are awesome", "man these are awesome". My husband and I went on a vacation to the mountains and I grilled these for us...it was way easier than I thought it would be. I set a timer for 5 minutes and instead of flipping, I put them into the pot of sauce for 5 minutes, then took them out and turned them on the other side...you get the picture.  I will be making these again.

These wings are awesome and much healthier than fried wings.  I have made them many times. They continued to be requested for our weekend get togethers on the Ohion River islands. I make them a day ahead and serve them cold. Thanks Matt

The best wings ever.  Add butter to the sauce and cook on the side burner.  Not your typical buffalo wing, but that's what makes them awesome.  Grab a few beers and head out to the grill, no need to run back to the kitchen for anything until your ready to eat!

Great wings! I did use a throw away pan on the grill as others had suggested. Sauce thickened up and the wings were wonderful.

Wow! I have been searching for the best way to make wings and my husband likes them hot!  These were awesome.  I didn't have enough room on the grill for my pan and the wings at the same time. So I grilled the wings for approx 10 min and then put them in the pan with sauce and then put the whole pan on the grill(direct heat).  I removed them after about 5 min and put just the wings back on. I decided then just to finish grilling the wings.  They had a great grilled look and flavor.  They also had the crispness just like you get when frying. I'm guessing that first layer of sauce on them helped with that.  We then tossed them with a fresh batch of the sauce.  The ingredients really surprised me, but the taste was amazing!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Okay...so I wasn't so sure about this recipe at first because of the unexpected combination of ingredients and the cooking method but it was worth the risk! This receipe is an absolute crowd pleaser. When we have guests over...I normally pull out all the stops to impress them with the food but this was the first time I had so many people actually ask me for the recipe. Everyone wanted to know what was in the sauce that made the wings taste so delicious! The other great thing is that towards the end of the grilling process, I just dipped half of the wings so folks had the option between wet and dry. They were both great! I will definitely make my wings like this from now on. Thanks!

Hands down the best wings I have ever eaten! I did not add the cayenne pepper. They had just enough bite without it.
I will not make wings any other way again.

My husband and I just made these. Not that hot, but they have a slight lingering after-burn. Excellent! We will definately make these again. I will add a little more hot sause next time. Thanks for a great Superbowl snack.

Excellent Wings!  My boyfriend and I prepared 1/2 the batch but with the full amount of sauce.  We marinated them for 24 hours.  They fell off the bone.  Great taste.  Tender.  Only thing I'd change would be I like them to be a little sweeter.  Next time, I'll make a sauce of honey and brown sugar, pull the wings off the grill dry, and then dip them in the sweet sauce so it doesn't burn.

This was my first time making wings. I follwed the directions with the exception of cayenne pepper. I grilled them over charcoal as directed and they not only looked delicious, they were the best wings we've ever had! I don't like them too spicy and didn't like how spicy they were when we added cayenne (the second time we made them). I'll make them often without the extra hot!

UNBELIEVABLE wings!  I had my doubts when I saw the ingredients, but I made the marinade, put it in a metal pot, and threw it on the bbq with 3lbs of wings.  It never really came to a simmer, but it was on the bbq for about an hour.  I put the wings on the grill for about 10 minutes at a time, enough to char them lightly, then threw them back in the marinade for a few minutes.  The result was fantastic.

They were spicy, but juicy, pleasing to everybody.

I can't recommend these enough!!!

Phenomenal way to cook wings to save on all the butter and frying.  The wings pack plenty of punch, too.  I've gone 50/50 beer cola and 100 cola and it's great both ways.  Thanks for the recipe!

The wings were good, but I also had trouble getting the sauce to stay on the wings.  I didn't use the pepper, because I wanted the kiddos to eat them too.  Overall, they were good, but a lot of work.

I'm not a wing fan by nature. My husband & I have been been eating healthier so tried this recipe. The only change I made was I did not have enough Louisiana style hot sauce so used a bottle of NM style hot sauce, same ingredients just a little more to it. I'll tell you they were fantastic. No dipping sauce needed. Definitely a keeper!

Super good. Definitely add some butter to the mix.   Nice alternative to fried.

I've been making this recipe all summer since ive found it
best wings ive ever had, i will never bbq wings any other way.
MAKE SURE TO COOK CHICKEN IN THE SAUCE UNTIL IT BECOMES THICK.
By the time this is finished. The chicken is falling off the bone. 
Entire family and friends love it.

Wow, this came out awesome! What a great way to cook the wings (used drumettes) and keep them moist and flavorful. Very spicy. We loved them!

This has been my go to recipe for years. Each year camping, Super Bowl, and on weekends all year long. I like a final dip in the sauce to make them a little hotter. The key is to not rush the grilling process I like my wings crisp and not chewy. This takes time. Low heat. Longer grilling time.

Turned out great! My Wife likes when I use Big Red, but I like using Dr. Pepper in the recipe.
Because the sauce is constantly simmering, I think the bacteria from the chicken does not survive, therefore removing the risk of getting sick.
I have made this recipe over 10 times, and it is a huge hit. I usually double the recipe and add extra hot sauce in the sauce.

This Grilled Buffalo Wings recipe has been a huge hit every time I've made them. The last time I made them I had bought a 12 oz bottle of Frank's Red Hot, so instead of using the cayenne pepper, I used the entire bottle of Red Hot. I also did more than 3 pounds of chicken wings... closer to 5 pounds with this sauce recipe. I served them with homemade Bleu Cheese dressing. My dad said they were better than any restaurant!

This recipe is fantastic.  Added Dr. Pepper instead of cola and threw in a couple of cloves of garlic for good luck (love garlic) and my daughter (who usually eats nothing) and I finished over 5 lbs of wings.

Fabulous and fun. I like my wings to have some heat so I added a good helping of Sriracha to the mix. These cook up nice and sticky.

5 stars for the method, can't rate the sauce because I used my standard hot sauce recipe: 12 oz Frank's hot sauce, 1/4 lb butter, squirt lemon juice and because I needed more volume, about 4 oz of spicy barbeque sauce.  I use 10 full size fresh wings and don't separate the pieces.  These wings are like crack!  They come out absolutely spectacular using the 10 minutes in the pot - 10 minutes on the grill for an hour method.  Fantastic!

Awesome! I used Franks Red Hot Wing Sauce (because I already had it in the fridge). I also read one review where they said they wished it was thicker so I thickened the sauce using a heaping tablespoon of cornstarch with two tablespoons of water and added that to the bubble sauce and that did the trick.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  We used chicken legs as they are cheaper and you get more- everything was done exactly the same on the recipe except that we used Franks red hot sauce since that is what we had on hand :)

These are good! Love the cooking method. I made with coke zero and we loved the lower calorie meal and it helped some cravings! Wife wants me to make them again but im not about to freeze out in the cold to make them :) We actually used boneless skinless chicken breast also

Awesome recipe/flavor!  Unfortunately I tried it with whole wings which was a real pain.  Will definately use this again using the little wings.  Well worth the time and definately better than deep fried.

These wings were great!  They were nicely charred and fall off the bone tender.  We finished 1/2 of them off on the grill and dunked the rest in the sauce as a last step and I thought both were yummy, but the saucy ones were a bit spicier.  I will definitely do this recipe again!

Awesome!  My husband is a big wing eater, so he is very picky about how his wings are cooked.  He loved these... and my son loved them too.  I made a triple recipe and used only about 2/3's of the soy sauce.  I added a generous amount of minced garlic and garlic powder.

We used about 7 chicken legs.  Added 3 tablespoons of butter to the sauce & a tablespoon of barbeque sauce(which I don't think I could even taste that).  My husband loved them!!  They had a bit of a kick to them.  Will be making these again using drumettes.  Thanks for sharing the recipe  :)

The wings are terrific, don't get me wrong, but I think this recipe is more about the method than the ingredients.  Having to satisfy multiple taste buds, including children of 9 and 15 yrs, I decided to make several different sauces.  The first, was the recipe as written, minus the cayenne pepper.  next was Heinz 57 in place of the hot sauce, and last was Sweet Baby Rays original in place of the hot sauce.  By a unanimous decision the Sweet Baby Rays won hands down.  The recipe as written, minus the cayenne, is not overly hot, and is nice for a football game or backyard partying, but it just doesn't appeal to everyone's palate.  A little Ranch dressing on the side for dipping tempered the heat for those that were on the bubble.  The Heinz 57 just didn't show up, it wasn't hot or sweet, and not "zesty" as the label suggested.  Everyone enjoyed the sweet baby rays, regardless of whether they were "heat" fans or not.  For those that have concerns about moving the chicken in and out of the sauces, the sauces are constantly simmering, so I don't think there is much need for concern.  This is not a recipe that you throw in the oven and check back on it in an hour.  It requires actively working the barbecue for almost one hour, but it is worth the effort.  I will make the recipe as written, minus the cayenne, and the Sweet baby rays in the future.  Something for everyone to enjoy.

My suggestion for less work time, and a more TRUE Buffalo wing...use the mini drummettes.  They are the "bite size" wings usually sold in styro packs of 12.  Also, I dip the grilled wings in the sauce (with some butter added) immediately after taking them off the grill.

Wow. this is a bit labor intensive, but actually worth the effort.    I had no Coke, so I used Sprite, and added extra Cayenne and Frank's hot sauce, as suggested by previous posters.  Also put about 3 TBL butter into the pot about half way through, along with a little more Sprite.    This is a unique, very tasty recipe.  Really tastes hot, sweet, and "grilled."  5+ stars from me.   Will make again soon.

I made these last night and they turned out to be some of the best wings I have ever had.  The flavor was great, the fact that they simmered in the sauce made them tender, and they are much better for you than fried.  I love spicy food so I added a bit more cayenne pepper to taste.  I highly recommend this wing recipe for your next outdoor grilling adventure.  Thanks for sharing!

These were very good! I simmered them on the stove and browned them on the griddle and rotated between them. They turned out great !I didn't want to stand outside in the rain to grill them:) I only used A teaspoon of soy sauce,because someone mentioned the soy sauce was to strong on the original recipe. Perfect for the kids not to hot!!! Just enough zing!!

Recipoe is fantastic.  Takes a decent amount of time but totally worth it!  The only change I made was I added some fresh garlic to the recipe.  Wings come out moist and tasty and much better for you them traditional buffalo wings!

I use recipes from here all the time and have never wrote a review but I think these were the best wings I have ever had!!  I wasn't sure about the ingredients in the sauce, and they do take a little time to cook but the end result is worth it.  I doubled the sauce recipe and was glad I did because mine did cook down quite a bit.  I followed the recipe exactly and I thought the flavor and heat was just right. Fell off the bones.  Disposal pan is a must.  Definately a keeper!!!

Great recipe. I made these twice this weekend with very different results. The first time I used a little less than 2 cups of Louisiana hot sauce instead of one and cooked the wings over charcoal for about an hour going back and forth from the grill to the sauce. They came out great with an awesome smokey flavor from the sauce dripping onto the coals causing the smoke. They were VERY hot though, and I love hot food. The second time I used a wing sauce instead of hot sauce to tone down the heat and only cooked over charcoal for about 35 minutes. The time on the grill made a huge difference. They didnt have the same smokey flavor that was amazing, so it's really worth the extra time.

I have tried many styles of wings.  I used this recipe and added an extra cup of Frank's sauce.  I simmered them on the stove for 45 minutes prior to cooking them on a Foreman grill to build a light glaze on them.  I put them back in the simmering sauce and then onto the BBQ grill.  I took them off the grill and placed them into a 9X13 baking dish.  I used the sauce to glaze them and put them in the oven at 350 degrees for 15 minutes.  It takes a little bit of work but the end result is the best tasting wings ever. Thanks for the recipe!

I'm a critic when it comes to wings and these wings were awesome!  I grilled them last night.  They definitely have a kick to them.  Going to have to alter the recipe a little bit for my girlfriend because she doesn't like spicy wings.  Maybe will try mixing in a little ranch dressing for her.

Not bad, the cola and soy could got though. I read on the bottle of Franks red hot, the recipe for wing sauce and found it to be just like what you get at the authentic wing shops. Turns out, it's franks, and butter. This was good though and I suggest giving it a try. (Use Franks red hot for the sauce)

This recipe was amazing. I didn't have any coke though. I ended up using Ginger Ale and It was amazing.  

The only problem was my sauce never thickened.

Overall very good. Worked well for tailgating using a foil pan, even on a small portable charcoal grill. Only complaint is it takes a while to cook but its well worth it!

Love the fact that this recipe doesn't have the extra fat of oil (frying) and butter( sauce). So it was a good alternative for that fact. But in the bigger picture, they were just OK. My sauce took forever to simmer on the grill - even on high heat. The wings weren't as tender as I had hoped they would be - they definitely didn't fall off the bone. I cooked them for about 45 minutes; maybe they needed to be cooked longer, but even on medium heat, the sugar (from the soda) caused them to burn pretty quickly. I may try again but will definitely need to make some alterations.

After reading many people's reviews, I chose this recipe because I was looking for a very mild buffalo wing for my kids.  I omitted the cayenne, and kept the rest of the recipe the same.  It still turned out to have some heat...too much for my kids, but perfect for me!  A good recipe for those of us who can't stomach a five alarm wing!  The cooking method was a bit intensive, but the wings sure turned out good!

I changed the recipe because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand.  I used 8oz beer instead of coke and 1 cup of wing sauce.  My husband and I had them tonight and they were awesome!  A little more work, but well worth it.

Good flavor, but the sweet of the coke kills the spice. I have used up to 3 tablespoons of cayenne in the recipe with the same results - not spicy enough. If wings don't make me sweat, I want them hotter! I am going to try it with beer, as others have suggested, to see if the sugar is the culprit.

Wow my husband and I really ejoyed this. I thought I might miss the fried taste like at wing places, but I didn't. Every couple of bites tasted too salty, I don't know if that was the soy sauce or what, but overall very yummy and we will be making it again.

OK...like others I was a bit skeptical of both the ingredient combination and the cooking method.  But boy was it worth the risk of trying this recipe.  My 9 yr old son and my husband are big wing fans.  They both loved them.  Between the 2, they ate all by 9 wings!  I did add a few drops of habernaro sauce because a few reviewers stated the sauce wasn't that spicy.  Our's had the right amount of heat.  Thanks for the recipe.

I have made this recipe a couple times for football. These wings are so tender and have a ton of flavor. You better enjoy spicy wings because they do have quite a bite to them. My friends have already requested these for the nest game :)

What an odd mix of ingredients. It's delicious! I was very suspicious while watching my husband prepare these wings. I assumed I wouldn't like them, but boy was I wrong! The two of us loved the way they tasted and will definitely be making again. He found that the sauce started to get too thick and he was running out of it while he was cooking. So he decided to just pour some beer into the pan to thin it out and make a little more. It worked!

We loved grilled wings and this was a hit. We did use Cherry Coke as another reviewer suggested.
They do get a little black in some areas. It's just the sugar from the sauce. I was shocked at first when my husband brought them in from the grill, but they were juicy and far from being dry. Even my picky teen daughter ate these.

I gave this recipe 4 stars for one reason only.  The claim is that they are better than fried wings.  If you are a die hard fried buffalo wing fan there is a big difference between frying and grilling.  However, this was an excellent recipe for the bbq grill.

These were really good wings. I love that they were not fried and that the sauce did not have butter in it.  I may have went a little heavy with the cayenne pepper because the family loved them but they certainly were hot.  I would omit the cayenne pepper or use less hot sauce and more cola next time.

These are the best wings ever!!  I made them the 4th of July and they were gone in a flash.  Much better than the fried variety.  I found that the pot that the sauce is in is hard to clean so I recommend getting a disposible cassorole tin that way there is no clean up at all.

These were very good!  I did them in the oven instead of the grill, It took a little over an hour, but they were very good.  They turned out a little hot for our taste, but that was my own fault!

the flavor was terrific. although grilled and re-dipping in the sauce in a little work. Talk the advice of others when reducing the marinade. A keeper for outdoor grilling.  Thanks.

Yum!!!!!!  I've been looking for a different way to prepare buffalo wings rather than the fried version we've been using.  Everyone in my family raved about these.  Definitely a keeper, didn't have to change a thing!

This recipe was great.  I made a batch of hot and a batch of mild using half of the hot sauce for the mild and they turned out great.  Will definitely do again.  Thinking of adding barbeque at the end to enhance flavor.

This turned out great!  It was borderline too hot ( used extra hot sauce and cayenne), BUT.....the taste was so good I kept going back for more.
