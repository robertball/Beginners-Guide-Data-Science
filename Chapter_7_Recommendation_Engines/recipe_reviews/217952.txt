Excellent recipe! Easy to make, full of flavor, and open to variation based on preferences and what’s available in the pantry (this recipe is quite forgiving). Here are mine:

Use a large crock pot. Additional ingredients: 1 chopped green pepper and 1T each of nutmeg, cumin, and smoked paprika. Save the collard greens as a garnish.

Mix the stock, tomatoes, peanut butter, and seasonings in the crock. If you’re preparing in the morning, set crock to low; otherwise, set to high.

Sauté the onion and green pepper; add the garlic about a minute before you are done sautéing. Add to the crock.

Add the chunked sweet potatoes. Don’t bother peeling, just give them a good scrub. The skins are full of nutrients and they’ll soften.

Add whole, uncooked chicken breasts (thawed or frozen). After a few hours, remove chicken and shred by pulling apart with two forks (I prefer the look and texture of shredded chicken in my stews). If the chicken is fully cooked, it will pull apart quite easily. Put the chicken back into the crock and turn heat to low until ready to serve.

Right before serving, sauté the collard greens with a bit of butter and a generous pinch of salt. Use tongs to toss the greens. Sauté until slightly wilted and a pretty green.

Serve over quinoa, and garnish with wilted collard greens, shredded carrots, and coarsely chopped peanuts.

Love, love, love this recipe!  Many thanks!!

I made it vegetarian by replacing the chicken with garbanzo beans and chicken broth with vegetable -- upped the protein by serving it over quinoa.  Delicious!

Let me be the first to say that this is absolutely delicious and different!  I followed the directions exactly except for subbing regular potatoes for the sweet potatoes.  Shared with some friends that couldn't believe how tasty it is.  If not for the high fat/high carb/high cholesterol I'd make frequently.  As is...it will have to be a rare treat.

I added the chicken, used regular potatoes instead of sweet and fresh tomatoes instead of canned. It was really good. I thought it was a tad bit too spicy, but dad and hubby both thought the spice level was perfect. Next time, I will add the tomatoes and greens at same time I add potatoes, didn't think they needed extra cooking as they came out very soft (maybe because I cut them in small bite size chunks).

One of our favorite restaurants occasionally serves this soup, and we always look forward to it.  I generally followed the recipe and used red garnet sweet potatoes as they are chock full of nutrients.  We omitted the greens, cut the red pepper flakes by half, and used chunky natural peanut butter (no sugar added) so I tossed in a small fistful of brown sugar, and a little cinnamon, ground cloves and cumin for added aromatic spice.  I actually liked that the potatoes cooked down and gave the soup a comforting thick texture perfect on a cold day.  If I needed it served over anything, it likely would be quinoa for the additional protein.  I will be making this again!

Love this dish! I've always called it African Groundnut Stew. I like it thick so cut way down on the chicken stock. Added tomato paste - did not add potatoes. Eat over rice.

This an amazing dish....I made some changes I used smoke Turkey wings instead of chicken and instead of sweet potatoes I used white potatoes.  I cooked this for my husband and kids and having him tell me as soon as he put the spoon in his mouth..... that it brought back all his childhood memories of his mom cooking that dish and the fact that my husband mother pass away when he was only 8yrs old and he really didn't remember her that much up until that very moment..... meant a lot to me.

My bestie was down for a much needed visit, and having told me she just decided to go Vegan, I thought it would be best to take her to this Vegan restaurant I love so much. Well on this particular day, one of the chefs just had HIS best friend from Senegal over, who made this dish for him, so he was trying it out on the patrons. We were the first tasters!INSTANT LOVE! I felt it wasn't decent to ask a chef for a recipe to something, so as usual I came here!
So far so good! In the finishing stages of cooking it now. Did a taste test, almost identical to the one I tasted from the vegan restaurant :D! Definitely a keeper!
The only things I needed to change (And thus the reason for 4 and not 5 stars) was I did find that 5 cups of chicken stock is quite a bit, especially when you then add the juice from the diced tomatoes. So you may want to use 3-4 cups of stock, and none of the juice from the diced tomatoes. OH! And I ended up adding a cup of creamy Peanut butter in addition to the crunchy for more peanut buttery taste and not SO many nuts (Although I think that is more Brand specific than recipe specific). All in all, I DEFINITELY think you should give this a try!

I made this for a co-worker who is from Benin in West Africa. He loved it and deemed it very authentic! I made it pretty much as written except adding a little more greens and peanut butter. This recipe is the real deal!

It was surprisingly delicious. Like lick the bowl good. I changed the recipe to use what.I had: 1) used 32 oz / 4 cup of Swanson Thai Ginger broth instead of chicken broth.  I think five cups is too much. 2) used two 10 oz cans of Rotel diced tomatoes with green chili's instead if 16 oz chopped 3) Used five cloves of garlic 4) I think I'll add more sweet potatoes next time, they cooked down more than expected. 5) used 1.5 lb boneless chicken thighs. It was very easy and a gorgeous dish.

Very tasty!  Used cubed butternut squash instead of sweet potatoes and left out the crushed chili pepper for the kids.  Probably easier to make with the sweet potatoes because the squash was tough to chop but that is what we had on hand.

Amazing! I always adjust the recipes that I use and it was still awesome!  I used kale instead of collard greens, some homemade cashew/almond butter instead of peanut butter, vegetable broth (only 4 cups) instead of chicken broth and I did not put in chicken.  I also used olive and grapeseed oil instead of peanut oil. Like some of the other reviews suggested, I added some cinnamon and cumin.  Our family likes spice, so I added more red pepper flakes.  Fantastic! The flavor is rich and very satisfying but yet still healthy...this is def one of our new favorites!

I made this with the closest ingredients I had (yellow onion instead of red, regular greens instead of collard greens) etc, and I thought it came out very good.  There are a lot of veggies and the peanut butter adds a nice flavor.

I've tried many recipes from this site, and most have lived up to their ratings.  However, this is my first review.  After trying the west African peanut stew I was blown away!  I like peanut butter,  but do not consider it a staple.  I made the stew for my family, following the recipe, and everyone loved it!  The aromatic spices set the stage, the chicken and greens blended nicely, but the sweet potatoes and peanut butter were the stars.  The potatoes held their shape, but cooked down to velvety pieces.  The peanut butter thickened the stew and mellowed into a subtle earthy flavor.   There was nothing wrong with this dish.  Had it re-heated the next day and it was just as delicious.   Thank you for a brand new taste, what a great dish!!!

Delicious and different! The collard greens added to the broth flavor, and the potatoes came out really good. I don't eat much meat, so these two ingredients were great. I changed the recipe a bit, and replaced chicken with pork, and used russet potatoes. When browning the meat, I also added in some cumin, turmeric, and ginger powder.

So delicious, deserves 10 stars. Used kale as I didn't have collard greens and it was great but next time, and there will be a next time!, will add it along with the sweet potatoes so the potatoes aren't too soft before the kale is cooked tender.  Used creamy PB instead of crunchy.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

There's only one word to describe this soup, OUTSTANDING. I fought temptation, and followed the recipe precisely. Pure perfection. Because my family devoured it so quickly, I will double the ingredients when I prepare it tomorrow (it beckons to be shared with friends)! To spice it up, I will increase the red pepper and add additional crushed peanuts and kale instead of collards (only because I always have kale in the frig). I have a gathering planned for later this month, I will eliminate the chicken and use vegetable stock for my vegan friends --they will be pleased. This soup is so versatile. Thanks, KM1312!

Excellent! Cut your ginger thick and it has the most beautiful crunch.  Doubled the red pepper and added 1/2 tsp allspice.  Super yum.  Definitely gonna try other greens in this.  So many possibilites!

My family loved this dish and it made plenty for leftovers. As per other suggestions I used chickpeas and veggie stock instead of chicken and chicken stock to make it vegetarian and cut the crushed peppers in half, it was plenty spicy for us. I also used one medium sweet potato and two red potatoes just because that's what I had. Instead of including the greens in the stew I fried them up with some crushed peanuts and cilantro to top the dish, turned out incredible!

This is a delicious stew! Flavors can be tweaked to your liking. I used less red pepper. And actually the chicken doesn't add a lot and could easily be a vegetarian stew ... yummy!

I've never tasted anything like this! Very different but couldn't stop "tasting" it. I copied others and added a dash of cinnamon, cumin & a pinch of sugar. Also subbed dried ginger for fresh. (I know, a big no-no) But I was out. I'm letting it simmer on the stove until dinner. Will serve over jasmine rice.

I made this skeptically the first time, and have since made it twice. My family absolutely loves this! I use homemade stock and omit the chicken. I put shrimp in it last time and served it with rice. Excellent meal!

I was nervous the whole time while it was cooking but I followed the directions exactly and it turned out wonderful. My man doesn't like stew and soup very much but he stated, "Add this one to your book!" We will definitely be eating this more often.

This was one of my favorite soups before I developed an allergy to peanuts (sad). I just made it with sunflower butter and it was so good!

Definitely make this again!  I skipped the onion, diced fresh tomatoes in lieu of the canned, and only used 4C of broth.  Husband and I both liked it.  I ladled it on plates over brown rice.  My favorite was the little bits of ginger root.  I wouldn't make this if I didn't have the root.

I like it very much that African peanut butter soup/stew allows a lot room for creativity. I heard that there are many versions of it and African men usually know how to make it. If you like the combination of tomato and chunky peanut butter, don't be discouraged if you don't like this specific recipe. Go search for others and you'll find what you like to make one yours. I love spices, so I added some cumin, turmeric, and saffron. My choice of vegetables were potato, cabbage, carrot, celery. My choice of meat was turkey leftover from Thanksgiving. My friends preferred chicken usually. In addition, I usually grow collard greens and kale in summer, so I'll add them into the stew next year.

Really wonderful and unique recipe! I'm a calorie counter, so I had to lower the cals/serving to fit this into my daily intake budget. So....I only used about 2/3 cup peanutbutter. I also didn't put in the greens due to personal preference, and I didn't add chicken out of sheer laziness (would've had to thaw it). I think 1 tbs was too much crushed red pepper, but this is up to the individual, so I recommend you start with less and work your way hotter to get it right. Also, I used an immersion blender and preferred this consistency because the potatoes ended up too mushy for my liking after 35 min of boiling/simmering. 

Anyway, fabulous - thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe in Ecuador, with the ingredients we have available here.  It was delicious!  My (necessary) substitutions were as follows: purple camote for sweet potato; fresh tomatoes for canned; chard for collard greens; and canola oil for peanut oil.

I should also note that it was made with homemade chicken stock.

It only required fifteen minutes for the final cooking step, not twenty.

Thanks for the great recipe!

Slow cooked it using fantastic guidance by another reviewer. I would recommend using 3.5 to 4 cups of chicken stock. 5 cups is way to much and makes it more of a soup than a stew.

MMMM MMMMM!!!  Made a version of this today with several variations:  used about 20 oz. of nice tri-tip beef cut into large chunks.  Used  fresh garlic, ginger paste, chili paste, cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes, along with a good amount of smoked paprika and a bay leaf.  I added some green and red bell pepper strips, three peeled sweet potatoes cut into small chunks, and two sliced medium carrots.  I don't like onions, so I omitted them.  For the liquids, I used a total of about 3C:  about 1/2C old red wine, about 1C of water with chicken stock paste (Better than Boullion--used about 2 1/2 tsp), and 1 1/2C light coconut milk.  I added one 14oz can of whole tomatoes in puree and smashed them a little and 1C of chunky peanut butter.  Once I had everything together and to a boil on the stove, I put it into a preheated 300 degree oven for a total of 1 1/2 hours.  I checked and  did add some of the liquid that made the total above as needed.  I checked and adjusted the seasonings along the way too.  I didn't want to make it too hot or have too much ginger, but I added more of these and would probably add just a smidge more next time.  Before the last 30 minutes, I threw in just a little frozen chopped kale.  I served this with brown rice and it was spectacular.  I would probably leave the kale out next time because I feel it didn't really add much with all the other flavors in the dish. Play around with the recipe and enjoy!

Loved this! Ate it over rice. Added some other veggies - carrots, beans and celery. Didn't have collard greens so used turnip greens. Will definitely make again, but will leave out the chicken since we are trying to eat more vegetarian and the chicken really didn't add much - the peanut butter is the protein source.

Pretty delicious! I made and used my own chicken stock and ended up using about 4 & 1/2 cups (cutting back based on other reviews). It was thick. But I also used fresh cherry tomatoes (quartered) instead of canned diced tomatoes. I substituted kale (that I already had on hand) for the collard greens and it was great. It's nice that's it's full of healthy power foods: sweet potatoes and dark, leafy greens. Will definitely make again.

This recipe was really awesome.  Tons of delicious peanut flavor.  I used chickpeas instead of chicken, as another reviewer suggested. Try it-you won't miss the meat.

This recipe is fantastic! I subbed kale for collard greens but kept everything else the same. Also... the recipe says this only makes four servings? Maybe my husband and I just have small appetites, but I would put this at six servings instead.

This was good but needs a few adjustments. First off the sauce is way too thin. I only used 3 and a half cups of chicken stock and next time will use even less. I also used a bit less PB since I was using less stock (about 2/3 cup). I used 2 lbs of chicken thighs and a can of garbanzo beans. The sweet potatoes got too mushy so next time I will add them with only 20 minutes left. I didn't have collard greens so I used spinach which worked out great. With these changes I will certainly make again.

I made this vegetarian style (no chicken, veggie broth), with curly kale instead of collards and it was amazing. We had it over white rice which held it together very nicely.

I make it completely vegan using vegetable stock instead of chicken stock.    i put in red beans.  The peanuts and beans make a complete protein which makes the meal filling even without meat

This stew is delicious and filling! I would say the amount is closer to 6 or 8 servings than 4, as the recipe states. I left out the collard greens because slimy green stuff isn't my thing (or my kids'). I also cut the crushed red pepper to about 1 tsp and it had just a hint of spice. The fresh ginger may have been a bit short because I didn't have enough on hand, but it was enough to still get a little of the flavor; I would use the full amount if I had it.
I served the stew over quinoa, as others suggested. It is plenty filling without the quinoa, but the addition didn't take away from the stew.

Great flavor! DO NOT add 1 tablespoon of red pepper flakes though! Woo was it spicy and I'm usually a person who can handle their spices. Maybe go with 1/4 or 1/2 tablespoon

This soup sounds strange as most of us have never thought to use peanut butter in soup. However, once you’ve made it you’ll want to make it again and again. Delicious

Loved it! Only used about 1/2 cup or so of the peanut butter and 1/2 Tbl of the cayenne pepper but followed the recipe for the most part to a T. Lots of flavor!  My husband ate two bowls of it for dinner. Will definitely make this again. Thanks for a unique stew.

I first tasted this stew in the late 60's when I was a child, and a West-African student came to our house and cooked for us. I never forgot the taste. Fast-forward 50 years later to this recipe, which is PERFECT. I didn't change a thing.

This recipe has become a standard go to for a quick hearty dinner. I have made it vegetarian, made it with pork, and made it with ground beef. I  have used kale, I have used spinach in place of the collard greens which I prefer, but not alway easy to get fresh, in Canada. I have added kidney beans, pinto beans, and garbanzo beans on different occasions as the legume whim hits me. This recipe is super versatile, and forgiving.

Great recipe.  five stars for the original.  over time i have changed the peanut butter to peanut butter powder. ( 1 cup).  I am on a diet and I wanted to eat a lot of this soup.  I love that you can add your own spices and switch out vegetables at will.  Love it.

This recipe came out excellent. I left out the salt since there was enough in the recipe to begin with. I did add 2 additional cloves of garlic and about a 1/4 Tablespoon each  of Cumin, Paprika and Nutmeg as was suggested by others. Because we had large sweet potatoes I went with the 5 cups of stock so all of it was covered by liquid to cook down but I did have to thicken it towards then end so it was more of a stew. Also I doubled the collard greens. Will definitely make again.

I will definitely make this again! I will play around and tweak it a bit but this was definitely delicious. The one thing to note is I do love my food spicy but 1 tablespoon of red pepper flakes is quite a lot for these proportions ! I used about half of that and it still had a nice kick.

I’m so glad I made it. Super simple and quite tasty.  As everyone stated, use less stock. Also, I’ve upped the seasoning for my taste.  Since I didn’t have collard greens I used the Swiss chard I had on hand.  Who would have thought that the combination of tomatoes and peanut butter would work.  It smelled terrific as it was simmering.  Served it with white rice.  Will definitely make it again.

Well, i was a bit skeptical at first with this recipe but it turned out AMAZING! I left out the potatoes and used Coconut Oil instead of Peanut cause thats what i had and i used Spinach instead of Kale. I put it on top of rice and it was honestly delicious. My husband who is african said he loved it. I put the ingredients pretty much by eye and I would taste it every so often and modify along the way and it turned out REALLY good. Will definetely make again.

Delicious!  I added carrots and replaced the chicken with stew meat, and it was still amazing.

I had this last night at my sister's house and WOW!  What an amazing combination of flavors and textures! (I generally shy away from African cuisine because I'm not a fan of what I perceive African spices to be.  This could of course all be in my head.) 

The only variation we made was to add an additional sweet potato. We served it up with some warm, multi-grain bread and everyone had a second  helping. I can't wait to make this for my family!

This was amazing! I made some tofu in a separate pan and added it to my portion, as I'm cutting down on meat. However- my partner unexpectedly LOVED this recipe too, and he's hard to please. So I will definitely be making this again soon! (Hint: use natural, good quality peanut butter!)

I followed the recipe overall but doubled the collards to get some more greens in the diet and halved the red pepper because 1T is a LOT) and it was good, but we felt like it lacked something to tie it all together and bring out the flavors.  I added 2T garam masala and some extra salt, but felt like it still needed some kind of acid.  I squeezed in the juice of two clementines from the kids' lunch stash, and that did the trick!  We will definitely make this one again!

I made zero substitutions and was in love at first bite. After nearly four years of searching for recipes my picky husband would like I was sure I had hit the jackpot! I was wrong, naturally, but I stand by my five star rating. One of my favorite dishes I’ve ever served.

I used crushed chilis instead of crushed red pepper as I couldn't find any but I only used a teaspoon. Great flavour! 
Everyone loved it.

West African food is so underrated. Why isn't peanut butter stew more popular internationally?!

I more or less followed this recipe as written, and it turned out wonderfully. It's delicately spicy, and eventually thickens up so that it's more of a peanut butter-flavored curry than a stew. It's hearty and would be a great winter dish. You could pour it over some rice, or eat it on its own. Enjoy!

My husband called this "man-pleasing". I made a few adjustments based on other reviews. Added smoked paprika and cumin which gave it a nice flavor boost. Used kale instead of collard greens. Added chickpeas instead of chicken. Only added 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes and it's plenty spicy for me. Fantastic!

Made this exactly as the recipe says, and added chicken because we had some leftover from another meal.  This stew was raved about by myself and the six others who shared it!  I'm going to make it again really soon.  It's delicious!

Excellent stew!!! Do cut broth to 3.5 or 4 cups. Red pepper flakes could be cut somewhat unless you like your food spicy.  I added 2 chicken breasts,  turnips  & carrots (with sweet potatoes) and red peppers ( with tomatoes). You could add anything. Otherwise made as is! We liked the red pepper flakes as called for. Served with Quinoa and it was perfection!! I will make again and again! a new favorite!

Love this recipe! Very versatile. I’ve never had true West African Stew so I didn’t have a baseline of what to expect, but this was delicious! I ended up tossing everything in the slow cooker for 6-7 hours. I made several modifications which all worked out great: I didn’t have collared greens. I added 1 huge sweet potato (with the skins)  and supplemented with a bell pepper, couple of small turnips, and 3 carrots. I had a small white onion instead of red. I added 1 tablespoon of cumin, nutmeg, and paprika. I used half as much red pepper flakes, and only 3 cups of broth. I added frozen chicken breast and about 5 hours in pulled it apart and mixed it. I didn’t need to use any oil, though could have sautéed the onions in advance (though it tasted great without this step). Lastly I used 2 fresh tomatoes instead of canned. Great served over rice or as is. Highly recommend playing around with this recipe - it’s delicious! Thanks for sharing.

THIS RECIPE is one my family will not stop asking for!! So delicious, nutritious, and easy to make in the slow cooker. And any collard greens I have leftover I turn into gomen waat! So nothing gets wasted!

I love this recipe, it's delicious, nutritious and very easy. I have personalized it by seasoning with smoked paprika, cumin, cloves, and coriander. I also use only 4c chicken stock. I add 1lb mushrooms after the sweet potatoes, I prefer to use fire roasted tomatoes and add the collards at the very end to keep them just barely cooked. Lastly, I like to cut the peanut butter just a little and add dry roasted peanuts; the texture of the cooked nuts is one of my favorite parts of this dish.

Seriously good AND healthy.  I didn't have everything the recipe called for and it was still outstanding.  I would say if you are on a budget skip the stock and use water. Start with half the peanut butter and add more to taste.  It's worth it to make sure you have sweet potatoes.  I made it twice and cut the crushed hot pepper in half the second time. I liked it the first time but it was too spicy for my friends. It really is a great recipe that you can play with and make your own version. Thank you SO MUCH to the person who posted this recipe. It's a super keeper!

Not only is this recipe easy it is also delicious!!  I omitted the collard greens simply because I did not have any on hand.  I also did not have peanut oil nor did I have crunchy peanut butter.  So to substitute I crushed up some peanuts and added it to some canola oil.  I let that simmmer for about 10 minutes before adding the onion.  Then I used smooth peanut butter instead.  What a hit!!  I will be making this recipe again and again!

The chicken and collard greens went very well together, and I loved the peanut butter with the tomatoes. I wish the broth had been thicker.. I think if it was 4 cups of water with the bullion to make chicken stock instead of 5 it would've been better. Overall, I still really liked it.

Recipe is soooo good as is!  I've also made a vegetarian version substituting chick peas for chicken and using veggie broth.  Also used half chunky and half smooth all natural peanut butter. Using fresh ginger and garlic over powdered makes a difference!

Wonderful! Cut back to 1 Tbsp. ginger,  2 cups rotisserie chicken, 1 1/2 teaspoons red pepper, 2 sweet potatoes  and 4 cups of chicken broth. Did everything else as written. This is my new favorite recipe. My husband loved it too.

I made the vegetarian version -- vegetable stock, not chicken -- and even the meat eaters in the family enjoyed it.  I liked the thick consistancy and chewiness of using crunchy peanut butter.   Could have used a little more ginger, garlic, and hot sauce for flavor.

Really nice recipe!  I used only .5 TBSP of red pepper and it was still spicy enough! Can use ground peanuts to add crunchiness if you have creamy peanut butter.

I really liked this soup and would make it again!
Here is what I changed to make it veg-friendly, and it was delicious: 
Used coconut oil instead of peanut oil, veg broth (called not chick'n) instead of chicken broth, can of chickpeas instead of chicken, and kale instead of collard greens.

Will definitely make this again! Used leftover turkey and it was delicious. Microwaved my sweet potato chunks a couple minutes first because we were wanting to be sure it would be ready at the end of the listed time. Turned out great, even with powdered ginger.

This is one of our favorite soup recipes!  It is delicious and feels healthy and filling. We make the vegetarian version, using veggie stock and 1 can of garbanzo bean instead of chicken.  I also reduce the amount of peanut butter to 1/2 - 2/3 cup; otherwise it's too thick and the p.b. flavor overwhelms the rest of the soup. We also add a 12 oz. bag of chopped kale instead of the collard greens.

Great recipe.  I did add the cumin, paprika, etc. suggested in the comments and made it in a slow cooker.  Shredded the chicken breasts after 4 hours on high.  My two sons who had never experienced W. African cuisine before both loved it.  Definitely will make again.

I try not to rate anything that I have not made according to the original recipe. I have to defer here to my better judgement because this stew was very good, even though I missed the ingredients just slightly.
I used olive oil and butter to saute the onion and peppers (couldn't resist some extra veggies) and used about 2 T. of flour to create a roux before adding the chicken stock. I just wanted to make sure it wasn't greasy or oily. The only other substitution or change I made was using spinach instead of collard greens 'cause that's all I had.
We both loved the stew and will definitely make again. Thanks!

I make this all the time in the winter. I follow the recipe unless I can’t find collard greens, then I use kale (cannot tell the difference) also sometimes I use the cubed butternut squash from Trader Joe’s instead of sweet potatoes. This recipe is excellent and full of flavor. Super interesting and addicting. Oh. I never have fresh ginger! I omit it.

This is a killer recipe!! I did add a small chopped jalapeno pepper and a yam but stayed pretty close to the basic recipe. I cook for a gout sufferer among others so I use no or very little meat. I  finished with a 50/50 mix of collards and red chard.Served it over a bed of yellow sticky rice. The next day, I was asked several times "when are you going to make it again?"

As one poster suggested, I also added cumin and nutmeg.  Since my husband has a heart history, I left out the salt.  Added all ingredients into the slow cooker and cooked on high for about 4 hours.  Just before serving, I added a small jar of coconut milk and stirred in roasted peanuts for texture.  We have a lunch club where we try out different international foods.  Despite people looking very dubious when they heard about this recipe, everyone LOVED it!!  Several people said it was their favorite of all the dishes we have tried over the last 4 months.

This is really good. I subbed collards for kale and crunchy for smooth, also added some cumin and cinnamon. We ran out of chicken but was great as a vegetarian dish. Tasty!

True to description- this was a very adaptable recipe, I wanted a meatless Monday dish with lots of peanuts for protein...this fit the bill! We added chickpeas and lots of veggies and bright kale- topped with chopped peanuts and served over fluffy brown rice. Made wonderful quick lunches throughout the week, too. Nourishing and delicious!

On the first run of this recipe, in which I followed the directions and cooking methods it did start to burn on the bottom, and I saved it with the old trick of pouring it into a clean pot and scraping ever so lightly to get everything that wasn't singed, discarding the bottom layer. 

The second time  I made the recipe I changed cooking methods and changed the recipe, and my results were as follows:

I modified the recipe for a slow cooker and applied some of the techniques recommended by Cooks Illustrated for increasing the strength of the spices and the tenderness of the chicken. I doubled the recipe, but that is a challenge for all but the largest slow cookers.

First thing; do NOT be afraid to load up on the spices. I shorted them and then had to add more later. This soup needs them for its characteristic taste. The amounts below have been changed so they are all in there in the correct amounts from square one.

Second thing; do NOT add the peanut butter until the very end, and once you do, turn down the heat and watch it like a hawk. Even having singed the bottom the first time and adding the peanut butter later, I still singed the bottom again, just not  nearly so badly.

It was okay.  Based on the other reviews I was optimistic about this recipe.  I tried it for dinner one night and leftovers the next day and just didn't care for it that much.  I did use a little more sweet potato (because I couldn't find any small ones) and greens (just to use up what I had) than what the recipe called for.  Perhaps that was the problem.

I made some changes. I added okra and kale, omitted paste and substituted ginger for turmeric.  I used cayenne for heat and it was wonderful!  Can be served over rice.

I made this for my guy, who is South African. He lied it. Said it was so close to a stew his Mom made. My only change would be next time I'll use chicken thighs instead of breaths. They work better with long cooking times.

I used rotisserie  chicken and 3-4 cups stock.  Would use half cup chunky peanut butter next time.

So good, and I usually don't eat spicy food. I recommend only going with 4 cups of broth like others have suggested. Beans would be a good addition too if you want something to substitute for the chicken.

Really good. We have had a recipe for this, we have used for years. Tried this one and family was very impressed. Will be using this version again. Was a little watery, but after boiling it down i think it made texture better and flavor. Yummy

this was not very good. I didn't add garlic and used kale instead of collard greens.  the flavors just didn't go together.  My family didn't like either.

Wow, so easy and delicious! Really easy to adapt to use what you have available. I didn't have a red onion, used a yellow one. Didn't have sweet potatoes, used yams. I smashed the yams up a bit once they were soft and it thickened the stew right up. I ended up putting extra garlic, a dash of cayenne and just a pinch of all spice. It was just a bit too bland for our taste seasoned according to the recipe. My husband asked when it would be to soon to make again...lol.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was absolutely delicious!  I used coconut oil to saute the onion and garlic; used ginger powder because I didn't have any fresh ginger; a box of frozen chopped spinach; and some chopped rotisserie chicken out of the freezer.  I chopped some dry roasted peanuts to sprinkle on top.  Clean eating at its finest!

Made it with a blend of kale, collard and mustard greens.  I would have put a bit more than a 1/4 lb of greens in retrospect.  Also used one sweet and one regular potato because that's all I had.  I think 5 cups of stock is a bit much, so I brought it down to 4, it seemed perfect that way.  Served over brown rice.  Quite good and quite different!!

Delicious!  I did not change the recipe other than to drastically reduce the amount of red pepper flakes to just a couple of shakes and I threw in a can of cannelli beans just because.  My husband asked me when I planned on making it again.  About the most positive review he gives any new dish I make.  Do not hesitate to make this one!  Thank you for this recipe.

I was really excited to find this recipe as I have seen multiple versions of it made on TV cooking shows.  I was very pleased with the recipe.  I did follow the recommendations of a few other reviewers though:  cut back the stock to 4 cups, I used ground turkey instead or chicken because it's all  I had (and it was delicious), cut back on the red pepper flakes for my little kids, but added cinnamon and cumin.  I didn't have any greens on hand, so I tossed in green beans - it was good.  I will definitely make this again!  Served with quinoa.

Absolutely loved this recipe!  I made it with some of the suggested substitutions - 1 tsp powdered ginger, kale instead of collard greens, 2 tsp crushed red pepper, and I also used 12.5 oz canned chicken.  I reduced the stock to 4 cups.  Tastes like chicken satay soup.  Fantastic!

I replaced collared greens with spinach and made my own broth (from leftover veggies and turkey bones/skins).

Really great recipe to switch things up during soup season. I made this for vegetarians, so used 2 cans of white beans instead of the chicken. I also used 6 cups vegetable broth, omitted the onions, doubled the garlic, used 3 tbsp chopped fresh ginger instead of 2, added 1 cup chopped carrots and 1 cup chopped celery, used 1/2 lb of chopped kale instead of collard greens, and used 2 cups chunky peanut butter instead of one.

Great with pita chips for some crunch.

Really enjoyed it, had to use some flour to thicken it to more of a "stew" consistency, and 100% recommend that you use natural peanut butter.  I made a similar recipe using ground up peanuts and it was AMAZING and this time all I had was Skippy peanut butter.  Huge difference.  Highly recommend getting fresh ground peanut butter.

Excellent recipe! I made it vegetarian and substituted spinach for collard greens. I also used 1 tsp ground red pepper instead of red pepper flakes. It was a tad spicy, but my young kids loved it. Served alongside curried quinoa.

Omigosh.  This is by far the most delicious and simple stew I have ever made.  I was a bit wary about adding the kale, but in the finished stew the kale was delicious.

A big hit!  I forgot to buy sweet potatoes, so I used regular potatoes.  Next time, with sweet potatoes (and maybe a little less peanut butter) I'm sure it will be even better.

DIdn't have collards and I don't like kale, so I used spinach, but otherwise, made it as described. Loved the flavors. Served it with hot crusty bread -- I bet it'll be even better on day 2 after the potatoes have fallen apart (and it is). 

Second time, I used collards, and I liked the way it balanced the sweet and spicy flavors more than the spinach. Again, better the second day after the potatoes melted.

Also made it for a work function, and it went over extremely well. I think some finicky people were intimidated by the idea of it, but once they tasted it, they were hooked.

OMG! So Delish! Followed all exactly except for 1 less cup of broth and I probably added more chicken and collards than was called for. Definitely making this again.

I LOVED this soup. I didn't have kale or collard greens so I used spinach instead. I also used double the stock (I like mine a bit more soupy instead of stew) and I doubled the tomatoes too. The flavor was incredible with the ginger and peanut together. I will definitely make this again. My hubby raved for days!

I did love this recipe. Like many others I only used 4 cups of stock to make it thicker and used fresh tomatoes instead of canned.  Also, about 7 minutes before it was done cooking I added in a pound of medium shrimp.  Not my wife's favorite dish which just means I get all the leftovers!

So good. I made it veg with tofu and veg broth, also I used a stick blender to make it more creamy, then threw in a handful of peanuts at the end.

This recipe is so delicious.  I felt like I was eating at a restaurant.  It has so much flavor you won't regret making it. I tried the vegetarian version with white beans. I put all the ingredients in my crockpot and OMG! It's amazingly decadent.

Love this recipe!!! I served with brown rice, cilantro and peanuts. Next time I would love to make with dark meat instead of breast for jucier meat.  Was sooo good

Loved this!  Used leftover sweet potatoes and cut the cooking time by 15 min.  Added peppers and rice.

I loved it, my boyfriend refused to try it. Just means more for me! I made it as the recipe states and it was really good. I think for next time I would add rice and more chicken and throw in some shrimp, and maybe some more vegetable. To make it more of a meal, and stretch out the peanut broth for it's pretty fatty. I'm a big fan of cooking up a big batch and freezing for quick lunches. I'm going to make this one time and time again.

This is a new family favorite. Made vegetarian by omitting chicken and subbing vegetable broth for chicken stock.

Great recipe!  No potatoes so I added a can of garbanzo beans.  The remainder I followed the recipe, except I exchanged thighs for breasts.  Borderline too hot, but I have extremely hot crushed red pepper.  I am looking forward to trying this with the summer tomato bounty.

Excellent recipe and awesome helpful reviews. I added tomato paste to compensate for the lack of canned tomatoes; turned out great. My husband lived in West Africa and this was his favorite meal there.

Great recipe! I generally followed the recipe, but with a few extras. I added more red pepper, some cinnamon, and some nutmeg. I also used fresh ground peanuts instead off jarred peanut butter and used closer to a cup and a half. I substituted coconut oil for the peanut oil and cut back on the sweet potatoes a bit and the sick by a whole cup.  The chicken was thigh meat. It made a huge amount - 6 nice sized bowls. It was served with some wheat yeast rolls. I'm definitely adding this to the rotation.

This was very good, especially the way the sweet potatoes got very soft and kind of melted into the stew a bit.  But I would say it is a little too tomato-y, my whole family agreed.  Next time I make it, I would use a regular size can if tomatoes instead of one of the big 16oz ones, and I would add the tomatoes in after the onion, garlic and ginger are sautéed and cook them down a little, because adding the tomato at the end left the dish with a canned-tomato taste, even though I simmered for an additional hour.  I also changed a couple things - I used spinach instead of kale which worked fine, and I added about 1 tablespoon of cumin, and 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon (from another recipe) -- the spices added a nice subtle flavor to the stew.

I just made this and stuck as close to the printed recipe as I had ingredients. I loved this and will make it again.  I had to substitute Siracha for heat and romaine for greens and it was wonderful.   I don't know that I will want a plain sweet potato again. Thanks

Yum! I omitted the meat and used a mixture of sweet potatoes and russets. It was very different and delicious! I love spicy food, but if you dont id recommend using a lot less crushed red pepper.

truly outstanding especially of you like the taste of peanut sauce.  Used less red pepper to dial down the heat and white beans in place of chicken.  This is a keeper!!!

Delicious!  I used chunky peanut butter because I grabbed the wrong jar, but it turned out lovely even with that slight difference in texture.  Since the ingredients and recipe reminded me of a cross between Thai peanut sauce and a Thai curry, I had it with steamed Jasmine rice and it was sooooooo good!

I made it into a vegan dish, tofu instead of chicken and veggie broth instead of the kind listed.  Also I added a little more water and put all the ingredients into a slow cooker on low over night.  I served it over quinoa also - first recipe ever that I ate the WHOLE thing.  It sounds strange but it is good.
