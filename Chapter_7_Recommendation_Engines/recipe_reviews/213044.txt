I've been looking at this recipe for quite some time. I was very tempted after someone else had made some sausage balls that looked devine. So taking the part of this recipe being faceless, I wanted to make them. I followed to a T. And instantly knew...to much baking mix. Not enough sausage and wow...loads of cheese(this after being in my mixing bowl and trying to mix all the ingredients). Still trying to make my way through the recipe, very thick to mix by hand(so others need to know, electric mixer with a dough blade)....it is very simple & easy recipe. The end result is where I had the most problems. At 25 minutes they looked done on top(used a broiler pan) so I pulled off and they were doughy and wet still on the bottom. Transfered & inverted the balls to a baking sheet and 10 minutes later...still looking undone. I broke one open and it appeared done, but was still dense, moist and doughy. With the hint of sausage flavor under the big biscuit flavor that was way more pronounced. This recipe needs to be modified big time. While my kids thought the "dumplings" as they called them were okay and filling, it didn't hit the mark over all with me and I was disappointed. There is obviously too much baking mix, not enough sausage & parsley. Not sure if there is too much cheese as well. Because the whole recipe was too dense. Sorry for a poor review, but it's my honest opinion. Won't be making the recipe as is...will play around with it until I get it how I feel it should be.

This did not turn out well for me... granted I am a novice cook, but I followed the instructions to a T. If you make these spread them WAY apart on the baking sheet because they grow HUGE due to the biscuit mix. Also they were brown on the outside and hard but really mushy and sticky on the inside...impossible to tell if they were done because of SO much cheese. They smell good, taste okay but were way too hard. My boyfriend wasn't about to go get seconds...I would put a lot LESS cheese in next time.

I've been using this recipe for years! My husband got it from a former co-worker after she brought them in one day. They are delicious served with fresh Ranch dip!

I've been making these for about 30 years. I like changing it up sometimes and this is a good way to do that. For those of you familiar with Bob Evans Sausage, try using the Zesty variety (red package) instead of the regular. It gives it a good spicy taste but not too spicy. My family loves these!

Too dry and bland with regular sausage, will try a spicier sausage next time.

I used 2 lbs. of sausage instead of one. I liked the extra meatiness and not so much potato.

This is an awesome recipe and has been a huge hit. i just added another half cup of milk to make it more moist and I didn't do the parsley. I also use the sage-flavored sausage. Everyone has loved them so much and said they're the best sausage balls they've ever eaten and have kept wanting me to make more for other occasions.

These are great very tasty, but do not reheat well.  They get hard.  If you are bringing them to someones house you should bring them raw and pop them in oven there, or just serve room temperature whish is fine.  Good with a Heinz chili sauce
