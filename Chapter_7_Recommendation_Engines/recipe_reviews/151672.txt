Having a hubby on the couch with a cold, I looked this up.  It was a good start.   I like how I enhanced it: two chicken breasts, which I simmered in about 5 c. water for a half-hour.  Removing them to dice them up, I added about 1 T of minced garlic, a few handfulls of angelhair pasta, a few large pinches of dried parsley, and a few large pinches of oregano. I added the recommended Mrs. Dash's, which gave it a lot more zip. I also grated some mini-carrots (about 8), and let them simmer with the broth for about 10 min., before I added the diced-up chicken.  Salt and pepper to taste.  It was really yummy, and became 5-star!

Quick soup. I did add some chopped onion and fresh minced garlic as well as a bay leaf, fresh ground pepper and chopped parsley. Good for using leftover chicken. I'd make this again when I need chicken noodle soup in a hurry.

I loved this recipe! My husband, myself and our daughter ate it all in one meal! I also used an extra 4cups of broth, as suggested. I added to it gralic powder, oregano and chopped onion. The amount of onion really depends on your own tastes. I used a whole chopped onion. Will definately use this recipe again and again!

This is such an awesome quick and easy soup. I added some onion an sauteed all of my veggies in a little butter to start, then added the broth an brought to a boil. I used leftover turkey for the meat, an bow tie pasta since that is what I had on hand, 1/2 cup did not seem like enough so I bumped to 1 cup. I seasoned with a little salt & lots of pepper also added some fresh flat leaf parsley since I had some. OH! I did add two 1/4 teaspoons of garlic powder since I didn't have any garlic cloves. 1/4 tsp of garlic powder is the equivalent to one garlic clove. Just thought I would throw that little tip out there. This soup is a must try. I will be making this again and next time I think I will even add in some frozen green peas.

Taken as soon as it was finished cooking. Turned out fan-tastic. I added 2-cups of Peaches & Cream corn and some fresh chopped garlic. In addition to the garlix and corn, I also added an extra 4-cups of Chicken Broth to ensure "soup" consistency. Used large egg noodles and felt that if I hadn't added the extra 4-cups, would have been more of a chicken noodle stew. Will definitely make this again.  Is already a hit with the family.

Yummy! I cooked a whole chicken in the pressure cooker for about 20 minutes, and used that broth in the soup ... wow, how great! It was the first time I'd ever made homemade chicken noodle soup, and I was totally amazed that it came out so well! Yummy! Thanks!

I loved this recipe for its simplicity but I did alter it a bit. First I boiled three thin chicken breasts for 30 minutes. I sauteed the carrots and celery in a quarter cup of butter.  I used two carrots and three celery hearts. I put the celery leaves aside, chopped them up for later. After I sauteed the veggies, I doubled the amount of broth and used two containers of Swanson broth. I threw the carrots and celery in a pot with the broth along with the chopped celery leaves,  added a pinch of salt, a pinch of ground pepper, a quarter teaspoon of oregano and a couple sprinkles of garlic powder. Brought that to a boil, added 10 oz of egg noodles and cooked that for 10 minutes covered.

While this was happening, I cut up the chicken that I had put aside into shredded cubes. Threw the chicken in at the very end and voila. I cannot put onions in my food which is a drag but my boyfriend loathes them so I deal lol. It came out delicious. My slider door was opening and the neighbor's cat was going nuts for the smell trying to get in haha. I will definitely make it again but I may even triple the broth or add less noodles as it was a very hearty soup.

This recipe definitely needs to be doubled. I used the No Yolk brand dumpling noodles and they were so good! Not as long as egg noodles and a little wider and tad denser. (I used 1/2 the bag) I added some chopped onion and used leftover chopped turkey. My son ate 2 bowls, and that's unusual for him. Can't wait to make with chicken.

The recipe was wonderful!  I  made enough for 12 servings to make sure we had leftovers.  I used part chicken broth and part chicken stock.  I boiled some dark and some white meat chicken and shredded it.  Shredding gave it more of a home-style texture.  Once the chicken was done boiling I added some shredded carrot, celery, parsley, and some salt and pepper.  I boiled it then strained out the vegetables.  This was also added  to the liquid.  The extra liquid was great because once the noodles went in, they sucked up a lot.  With the vegetables I added a whole onion and some minced garlic.  My boyfriend had a pretty bad cold so he added some habanero flakes to his bowl to kick up the heat and clear him up a bit.  It was really good if you can handle spicy foods.  I will definitely make this again.

very tasty! I added 3 cubed potatoes, and I used 3 bullion cubes to the water I boiled the chicken breasts in for my base. I added a sprinkle of dried parsley too & it needed a good dose of salt for some flavor. Wonderful recipe!

Very good, simple recipe. Great for small kids who are picky eaters.  My 3 and 5 year olds gobbled it up.  There are, of course, other recipes that have more vegetables and herbs but I chose this one for the simplicity.  I also used leftover Thanksgiving turkey in place of the chicken.

Thanks so much!  I needed the proportions for a basic noodle soup, as I was making turkey soup for a crowd.  I scaled it up to 12 servings, and the proportions were spot on.  I added some parsley and garlic powder.  A simple and delicious soup... just what was needed! Thanks much.

I thought it was ok, but the family didn't go for it at all. It's a little boring, but very easy to make.

Yum! This is a great jumping off point to make soup. I had all sorts of Thanksgiving leftovers so any veggies and turkey I had I put in here. Using the Swanson broth makes it so easy! Just finished my first bowl and it was delicious!

Delicious! I made some modifications. I doubled the chicken and added a cup or more of noodles. I like a thick soup. I used sodium free chicken stock so I could add salt to my taste. It is an easy and tasty soup.

This is a great BASE recipe if you need to know proportions for meat, noodles, veggies and broth. After you have that, you can double... and of course you can add more kinds of veggies (we did onions, carrots and celery) and played with favorite spices and seasonings. Thanks for giving a great jumping board!

I should add we had to add extra noodles. Also salt. And added: Garlic power, thyme, 2 bay leaves,  ground pepper.

Great easy recipe! The only changes I made were 1) I used Penzeys Mural of Flavor instead of straight black pepper and 2) I added more noodles (preference). My whole family liked it. Thanks for posting! Will definitely make again.

Used chicken thighs + rosemary, thyme and garlic to make the stock. 35mins, and removed meat, and simmered bones etc for further 40mins letting stock reduce. Used root veggies, but, used soup-pasta instead of rice, and added the chicken meat 10mins prior to serving. Enough soup for dinner 2 nights running (2nd day's soup even better) + a further 3 portions in the freezer. Love the app and the input from all various contributors

Made this tonight using our leftover Thanksgiving turkey. I added chopped onions, garlic powder,  and a few additional spices. Turned out great. You'll want to double (or even triple) the recipe if your making this for a family.

Terrific as is!  No kidding!  I made no changes and it's right up there with my favorite ever Chicken Noodle Soup.   I've made all day chicken noodle soups and complex chicken noodle soups.   With this recipe, I'll no longer have to do either!  Does only serve 4 though, so next time,I'll have to double the recipe so my family gets enough to eat.   They all loved it!

I made this soup using homemade chicken broth. The broth was highly seasoned so there was no need for additional seasonings. The soup was quick and easy and only contained ingredients that I would typically have on hand.  It was a huge success with my 4 picky eaters (3 of whom are under the age of 3). I decided to make it a little thicker due to my little ones and their desire to self feed. I added extra noodles and a can of corn drained. Then, because it was thicker, we served it over mashed potatoes. Lordy, Lordy... Comfort food. This will be repeated at our family table frequently both as a soup when we are sick and as a farm table classic.

Without my few additions, it is a little bland. Still good, though, so three stars for the original recipe. I added half an onion, minced, minced garlic, and plenty of basil. I threw the veggies, onion, and garlic in the pot with some unsalted butter and cooked it for about five minutes, then added the broth and seasonings and followed the rest of the recipe exactly. With these changes it gets four stars, easily. I will certainly be making this again.

My husband had a cold and felt lousy.  I needed something fast and comforting.  This
was perfect.  Nothing fancy just a good base recipe to which you can add your own
spin.  Leftover chicken broth and chopped chicken in my freezer--check,  leftover peas in the freezer--check, love onions-chopped 1/2 onion and thinly sliced some baby carrots.  No celery--used celery salt instead, perfect. Needed additional broth so I used instant chicken bouillon. Threw in extra noodles.  Lunch in 25 minutes!

Pretty good soup and very versatile.  I doubled the chicken broth (I was going to use three extra cups and was glad I put in the extra fourth one), shredded one large chicken breast, added two chopped up potatoes and left out the celery.  I also added an additional quarter cup of the pasta.  It was so easy to make which was nice since I felt a little rushed for time.

I used potatoes instead of noodles.  I also added fresh lime juice and cooked the lime rind.  The lime juice took the soup to a greater level - it was awesome!
