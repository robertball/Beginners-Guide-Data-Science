4.9.17 This stew has deep, rich and robust layers of flavor with Mexican tastes  lingering in the background, and the beef almost melts in your mouth.  Followed the recipe to the letter, with the exception of using regular oregano instead of Mexican oregano.  Do yourself a favor, and bring out that electric pressure cooker or an Instant Pot® or and give this recipe a try, you won’t be disappointed.

I have made this twice. I do not own a pressure cooker or instapot  so I used a stock pot. The only changes I made were adding 3 stalks chopped celery and cooking time.  I  brought beef mixture to a boil then simmered for 2 hours,  simmered veggies for 45 min then added cabbage and simmered 30 min more.  This was excellent and beef melts in your mouth!

Wonderful flavor!  I used my Dutch oven instead of an electric pressure cooker and it took about the same amount of time. I didn’t have a quart of beef broth so I used 14.5 oz of water and added a tsp of Kitchen  Bouquet. It was so tasty and full of rich flavor. I added the cabbage after turning off the heat and let it set for approximately 20 minutes, it turned out great. Definitely a new favorite.

My family loved it. The only change I made was I didn’t use a pressure cooker. I made it in my big cast iron stew pot. I doubled the recipe and the leftovers were even more amazing. I also added some celery and zucchini cut in quarter rounds  because we like a lot of vegetables. The seasoning was perfect.

will make it again, thinking about putting the cabbage in on the second round of pressure cooking not at the end. It was a little too crunchy for my taste. The potatoes came out a little mushy, but I cut them a lot smaller than the "quartered" the recipe called for. Everyone had seconds so it was a winner.

This did not go well. The only change I made was to add 1/2 lb of meat. I followed the recipe to the “t”.  I repeatedly got a read-out on the IP of “burnt.”.  I swapped it out with another Instant Pot of mine and again, “burnt”.  This happened  4 times. I ended up finishing the stew in a crock pot. I’ve had an IP for a year now, this was my first “burnt” sign.  Maybe here is another explanation for the error code. I think it was that the flour sank to the bottom and caused the error. N XX time, I’ll brown the meat in a skillet.

Great flavor, with a bit of a kick, this stew is hearty and filling for a chilly evening!  I made it grain-free, and there was plenty of flavor.  The directions for a pressure cooker are spot on, yielding tender meat but veggies with some structure.  The family really liked it, and I like that there are leftovers!  This makes about a gallon, so it's a great way to  stretch that protein dollar!  Thanks!

A great stew with just a hint of Mexican flair. This was my first attempt at a stew and I love the use of the InstantPot. I used sweet potato and parsnips instead of red potatoes and added green beans.  Followed the cook time directed and the meat turned out melt-in-your-mouth tender and the vegetables were perfect! Spot on cook time! Great job Baking Nana!

I made mine according to the recipe and we loved it. Easy to make and a flavor profile a little out of the ordinary for a soup. I used the amount of pepper flakes called for and the heat was perfect - spicy but you could still get the flavor of everything.

I made it in the Dutch oven, doubled the spices, and added half a chopped cauliflower head that needed using up. Good flavor. Ended up being more of a crowded soup than a stew, which suited us fine.

Delightful change from traditional beef stew. This was my first instant pot recipe, and I’m glad I chose itI think it bodes well for my instant pot future!  Fresh baked French bread rounded out this simple meal. I’m already dreaming about leftovers for lunch tomorrow! Also going to freeze a couple of servings to see if it holds up well for use when I work late and don’t have time to prep a full dinner after work one of these cold nights.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  The meat was so tender and the stew was even better the second day.

It was a cold and blustery day today, and this stew was perfect to warm us up. I used beef cheeks instead of chuck, and topped with crispy tortilla strips and green onions. I also used my traditional pressure cooker and not an electric pressure cooker; and ended up cooking the beef cheeks for 20 minutes instead of 10 in the beginning.

Excellent.   Just a slight bit of Mexican flair.   When I started making this, I didn't realize how crunched I was for time.   I rushed this a LOT.   I shaved probably 20 minutes off of this recipe and it still came out fantastic.   Thanks for a great recipe!
