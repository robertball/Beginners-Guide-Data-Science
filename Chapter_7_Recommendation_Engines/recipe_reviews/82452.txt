This was sooo good! However, I did change the procedure a little bit. I saute the potatoes in oil with some onions and garlic first, then added the rosemary and a little bit of cayenne pepper for heat. Then I tranfered it to a sprayed dish, and baked covered for 15 min, and then uncovered for another 15 min. The potatoes where soft and crispy, and the spinach added wondferful color and texture. Will definaly make again!

Any previous potato recipe that I have rated 5 stars has now become 3. WOW! These are fantastic! We love roasted potatoes in our house, and these have so much more flavour than my usual method of tossing in olive oil, garlic and rosemary. I doubled the recipe and my husband and I were fighting over who got to finish them off! Adding the spinach is a nice touch - even the kids ate it - although I will be making these potatoes frequently with or without the greens. Maybe using the small red potatoes is the secret here; they were so soft and creamy tasting but held their shape nicely. And for sure the fresh ground sea salt and black pepper are a must. I shredded some asiago cheese over them before serving, as it was the hardest cheese I had on hand. I forgot the drizzle of olive oil, but they didn't need it. Fabulous potatoes, Lisa! Thanks for an awesome recipe!

These potatoes are phenomenal!  I increased the recipe to use 2 lbs of tiny red potatoes, and used a 10 oz package of fresh baby spinach.  It looked like a lot of greens, but wilted down to the perfect amount.  I didn't have any rosemary, but this recipe doesn't need it.  Freshly grated parmesan cheese sprinkled liberally on top is the crowning glory.  This one will definitely be a staple at my dinner table from now on!

I wanted these good and golden brown, so I increased the oven temperature to 425 degrees.  I gave them a stir midway through the roasting time.  When I tossed in the spinach I found it wilted quickly, so returning the pan to the oven wasn't even necessary. This was extraordinary, simple as that.

This was very good.  I made a few changes, though.  I used regular potatoes because that is all I had.  I steamed them for a few minutes after cutting them up to start the cooking process.  I used extra garlic.  (My husband said to use even more next time!) I cooked them covered in the oven for about 20 minutes then uncovered them for another 15-20 minutes so they wouldn't dry out and get hard.  I drizzled a little olive oil after tossing the spinach with the potatoes.  Good.  I will make these again.

My these were tasty.  I used tiny multi colored potatoes as that's what I had on hand and it worked beautifully.  The outside had a slight crust on the potato and the inside was perfectly soft.  Adding the spinach gave it wonderful presentation appeal as well.  Next time, I'll back off the rosemary somewhat as I didn't particularly care for the strong flavor in this dish.  Thanks Lisa!

This side dish is absolutely wonderful!  We loved it and the addition of spinach was brilliant!  The combination worked beautifully.  I'll be making this time and again since it works well alongside just about everything!  I did add slightly more spinach than the recipe called for because the first time I made it I found the spinach wilted away and there was barely any left.  Thanks for sharing such a simple but great recipe!

The rosemary and spinach made my home smell wonderful and added a subtle but delicious taste.  However, I would spray the pan next time or use 3T of butter.  Great side dish.

These were delicious!  I used this as a very last minute thing so was worried because I did not have any spinach - but read other reviews that said it would also be good without the spinach and it was!  I also had to use canned whole new potatoes and they turned out perfect - nice and browned on the outside and yummy soft on the inside!  The flavors were fabulous.  I will make it again with fresh potatoes and spinach, but in a pinch it was good with the substitutes.  Very easy to prepare as well.

I thought these were good but not necessarily great. I ended up drizzling extra virgin olive oil over everything before I put it back in the oven to wilt the spinach. I'm glad I did because they were looking really dry when I first took them out.  As for flavor- all I could really taste was rosemary (which isn't so bad) but from that aspect I have another recipe for roasted rosemary potatoes that I like much better. I probably won't make this again but I'll definitely add some spinach to my potatoes from now on- very nice combination!

This was awesome, my husband said it reminded him of a recipe his Grandmother from Italy use to make. I did add an additional 4 tablespoons butter, the amount specified did seem to cover all the potatoes. Will make again!

This was a big hit at Easter.  We served a Lamb Roast with these potatoes and steamed broccolli.  The potatoes were devoured!  My husband says that these are his new favorite.  Also, he likes that the sodium is low.  Thanks for sharing this recipe! We will definitely be having these often.

I mostly try recipes as written then variations but I knew I liked rosemary potatoes and all roasted veggies.  I also needed to serve more than this.  I more than doubled the potatoes and seasoning.  I had a 6 oz bag of spinach and also added an onion chopped in large pieces and two stalks of celery that I needed to use.  The celery would be fine either way but I liked the onion with it a lot.

I LOVE this recipe! I did what others suggested and cooked the potato's with the butter/rosemary/garlic mix first on the stove for about ten minutes before transferring them to the oven. However I did cut the butter by a third and added three times as much garlic. With the added bit of olive oil at the end there is more than enough butter even with the cuts for my taste. It also helps if you like your potato's a little crispier like I do. This recipe is do delicious, easy to make and the presentation is A+! This is a 10star recipe in my opinion!

These potatoes are so good!  I make these often, in fact I am making them with dinner tonight.  The second time I made this I didn't have any Parmesan cheese on hand, so I grated up some swiss on top and it was equally delicious.

YUM! YUM! YUM!  I looooved these potatoes!  I did microwave my quartered taters first (under a wet paper towel) for a few minutes, just to make sure that they cooked all the way through in the oven without getting dry.  One issue I always have with roasted potatoes is the dryness, but these were perfect.  These would also be great made with turnip greens instead of spinach.  Thanks!

FANTASTIC potatoe receipe... not to mention the lovely spinach for that added nutritional value. My husband and I tried this with regular russet potatoes since I was out of red, and I cut them into sections which resembled the size of quartered red potatoes. No issues at all with the substitution.

I think it's the garlic infused butter which really makes this receipe. Husband tried it with olive oil at serving, I tried it with cheese... think I'll go the olive oil in the future.

Excellent receipe, thank you so much for submitting it!

Sooo good! I multiplied this recipe and it took longer than expected... I think you have to make sure you have ample surface area in your dish for the potatoes to spread out. But it still turned out fab. thank you!

I would replace the butter with olive oil and at the point the potatoes are tossed with the spinach leaves, I would top with Romano, Parmesan or any combination of Italian cheeses.

This was truly delicious! I used two regular red potatoes, and fresh rosemary, and put in about 2 cups of spinach. I loved that the spinach absorbed the garlic and rosemary flavour.

This is such a good side dish! I made it the first time for a dinner party/pot luck and there was not a shred of it left. I did manage to get a spoonful before it was all gone and promptly made it again for my family the next night. It was a huge hit. Now that I can find spinach again, it's on tap tonight for dinner.

Good!  I liked the idea of the veggie and the starch mixed.  I would add a lot more spinach next time since it wilts away into pretty much nothing.  It was nice to try something different for a change.

Love roasted potatoes anyway. Nice to add spinach to them. Used mini gold potatoes cut in quarters and store bought garlic butter. Went wonderfully well with the BOTTOM ROUND ROAST WITH ONION. Keeper for my kitchen.

Very good. I use more spinach than called for since a cup really ends up being little after it wilts. Good to serve with grilled foods.

Great Recipe!!! I will definately make this one again... and again.. I sprinkled the parmesan over the potatoes at the end.. For some reason it took a while for the potatoes to be cooked 45 mins.. it's probably my stove! Thanks so much for submitting this!!!!

I thought this tasted pretty good. I had a mix of red and russet potatoes and just used both. I couldn't taste the difference. They varied in size and I cut them into about 1 1/2 inche sized pieces. I also used whipped dairy butter to lesson the saturated fat. To save dishes I just microwaved the butter and mixed in the garlic and rosemary. I didn't have fresh and just used a scant teaspoon of dry. I got busy and they baked about an hour and seemed perfectly baked. I also added 2 cups of packed spinach, and probably could have added more, as it wilts down to not very much. The only thing was I thought it was missing seasoning or seemed a bit dry. I added about another 1-2 tsp of butter when done to help with the dryness. Otherwise, good side dish. Thank you

Followed recipe exactly except used 1 large baking potato and 1 large sweet potato. I thought this was excellent and easy! Accompanied Chicken Marsala very well!!  The only thing I might do is decrease the butter.

This was okay, nothing special. Ate it and it tasted good, but I like anything having to do with potatoes. I might make this again.

I think this recipe is a fabulous idea! You can have your "fries" and eat your veggies too. It's a perfect side to sloppy joes or burgers. I didn't have fresh rosemary, so I used 1 tsp. dried and crushed. We don't shy away from spinach in this house, so I used 3 cups. Next time I'll probably add even more!

So simple and so good. I've never been a huge fan of rosemary but decided to give this recipe a try and it was amazing and smelled so good in the oven. I used medium/large red potatoes so the cooking time was extended.

This recipe rocks! Saute with onion then add aromatics, with cayanne as another reviewer mentioned, then pour into sprayed ceramic plate. Baked uncovered for 20, fold in spinach, turn off oven, place inside two minutes and it's f'n awesome.

These potatoes were good but roasting them at 400 didnt make them crispy enough for my taste.  I added additional garlic, spinach and used margarine instead of butter.  I added parmesan cheese at the end.

Excellent and quick recipe. I made them in a round pan, and added more spinach. I could also see adding bits of bacon to this in the future.

I only had Yukon Gold potatoes, so I used them in this recipe.  The only other alterations I made were to follow other reviewer's suggestions to sauté rosemary, garlic, potatoes and butter in a saucepan prior to placing them in the oven.  I added 3 cups of fresh spinach as others reported 1 cup wilted down to near nothing.  It was a very good side dish that we had with Sweet Hot Mustard Chicken Thighs also from this site.

I made this dish with Yukon Gold Potatoes (all I had available), and since it was for a 4th of July party, I increased the serving size to 6.  Other than that, the only thing I did different was cook the potatoes in a glass baking dish because I don't have any ceramic dishes.
  This recipe came out great!  One thing I did notice was, by tripling the recipe, the end result was a little oily.  I would recommend using a little less butter if making great quantities of this recipe.

Turned out great! I took advice from reviews, and sauteed potatoes, garlic, and spinach (I used frozen), and then cooked for 15 minutes covered, and 15 minutes uncovered.

Excellent potato dish Lisa! I used butter gold potatoes skin-on and kosher salt. I could have used twice as much spinach though as this all wilted down so I would double the spinach next time. I only used half the rosemary at hubby's request, but I would have loved all of it. I did used dried spices in the jar and prechopped garlic.  I had to roast these about 15 minutes longer though as the potatoes weren't quite done and the spinach took about 5 minutes to get wilty, so the dish took longer than I expected, but it was so delicious that the wait was ok. This was so amazing it's a diet buster for sure. I really wanted a second serving it was so tasty. Thanks for the fabulous recipe for veggies Lisa!

These potatoes are absolutely WONDERFUL!  The spinach makes this dish go over the top.  My husband's words after our meal was "This is was the best meal ever!" :)  Thanks for the recipe!! Loved it and will make this again!!  Next time I will cut the butter in half and substitute for olive oil to make it a bit healthier.  YUM YUM

Roasting red potatoes and fresh rosemary in the oven is a regular meal in our household. However I've never thought of tossing fresh spinach in with them once done. What a great addition and you get your vegetables and potatoes all in one. Not to mention how easy it was to make. I did use a bit of olive oil along with the butter. Rosemary from the garden...oh my! Thanks Lisa a great recipe.

I really liked these! The flavor was subtle and delicious. I would definitely recommend doubling the butter mixture though. I had to add some extra oil so it would cover all the potatoes. 
I'll probably up the rosemary next time too. Overall though, easy and delicious!

I really liked this, but I made quite a few changes.  I put 2 extra cloves of garlic, because I just think there's no such thing as too much.  I also used regular potatoes, it's what I had.  I cut them small to cook faster.  I don't like rosemary so I used dried oregano instead, same amount.  Delicious!

So easy and tasty. I melted the butter in the microwave with the chopped garlic and subbed fresh parsley because I didn't have the rosemary. I served this with Golden Baked Chicken and Cheesy Baked Cauliflower, also from this site. The other recipe called for a 375 degree oven so I cut the potatoes a little smaller and that worked fine. Very nice recipe to use up some random items. Will make often

Very Very Very good!! I did however make some changes/ additions to the dish. I used kale instead of spinach and I boiled the kale in 2 ounces of  low sodium chicken broth and I added to the potatoes in the end like the spinach. I also added chopped onions. This dish is versatile and I will def do again!

Excellent! I used red potatoes cut into small pieces & sauteed them in an oven ready pan in butter w/garlic & onion to help soften them up (about 10 min.) before baking. I didn't have fresh rosemary, so I ended up using crushed rosemary along with 2 cups fresh spinach. Definitely will make these again ... Yum!

Love it! We eat this all the time at our house! If I'm in a hurry I will put a bit of olive oil on the skillet and fry them for about 10-15 min. covered, with the same ingredients. Great!

Rosemary adds flavor but had to add more salt and I am not a salt person. Probably do this again and add more herbs.

I made this as part of our special Valentine's Day dinner.  Wow!  They were great.  I followed the recipe exactly and served it with the "Roasted Rack of Lamb" recipe found on this site. Although it was perfect with the lamb I am going to try it with other meats as well.

Excellent dish!  I love the addition of spinach. I parboiled the potatoes to speed up cooking time and also sauteed them briefly with butter, garlic, Italian seasoning and herbs before transferring to ceramic dish in oven. Topped with grated cheese, the dish was beautiful and delicious.

Fantastic recipe, and so simple.  I used baby Yukon Gold potatoes and they were so sweet and creamy.  I do agree that you need more spinach.  I doubled the amount.

As other suggested we doubled the amount of spinach and would use even more next time - and there will be a next time for sure.  This was served with Filet Mignon With Mushroom-Wine Sauce for a romantic Valentines dinner.  Delicious!

I thought spinach and baked potatoes together sounded a bit stange but both my wife and I loved this one. I didn't have red potatoes on hand so I used Idaho russet potatoes instead.  Ya gotta try this one.... I think you'll be surprised!

I tasted these potatoes just before I put in the spinach and they were GREAT. But, after adding the spinach and returning to oven, they came out very soggy. I did add extra spinach as others suggested. I WILL make these again, but I will not add spinach.

Loved this recipe! Reminded me of my Nana's roasted potatoes.  

Added  a some drops of Tabasco sauce to the cooked garlic, oil and rosemary step to add some zip. Also I didn't have small red potatoes and so substituted pealed, sliced small, russet potatoes which worked out fine (this is what my Nana used in her recipe at any rate). I also added much more that 1 cup of Spinach. It looked overly green at first, but withered down nicely to a crunchy addition to the toasted garlic potatoes!

I really liked this, though I will have to vastly decrease the rosemary in the future and possibly add an onion. I also thought this could tolerate a lot more spinach, making it an even better side dish (for my family). We'll make this again, thanks!

Absolutely delicious!! I decided to use one pan; the cast iron skillet. So, I browned the potatoes and garlic (had to add onion, because we have to have onion with potatoes!) in the butter. Then added the rosemary, salt and pepper. Stuck it in the oven, uncovered, for 25 minutes. Then added in the spinach and baked for another 5 minutes. Just excellent with grilled steaks and grilled cabbage! There was enough for steak, potatoes and eggs the next morning too!

My new favorite potato recipe ever! I didn't have spinach, but had kale I needed to use, so I subbed kale. Just used garlic salt cause I was feeling lazy,  and realized I forgot the rosemary as I was eating them. Still good but I will add it next time. Cooked it in my cast iron Dutch oven with the lid off as directed. Both the greens and the potatoes were super tasty.

Great! I had to double the butter. Best to mix in bowl and then put in casserole dish.

I've made this twice now. I probably triple the amount of spinach I use and often add in a sweet potato in additional to the normal ones.

This is wonderful...I broiled for a few minutes before adding the spinach.  I did also add Parmesan at the end.

EXCELLENT! I used this recipe more as a starting point, and went with it... I used baby yukon gold potatoes, that I halved, and also added some crushed pepper flakes, dried, minced onion, more garlic than called for (I just did larger pieces of it) and some parm cheese. Oh, and I opted to use evoo instead of butter (just eyeballed it). I really loved the idea of adding the spinach...it worked really well in this. I will def be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Very good potatoes!  Mine needed to bake an extra 15 minutes for all of them to be done completely, but that is fine--I usualy have to bake potatoes longer than every recipe I've ever come across.  I think the only other thing I'd change in this recipe is to use olive oil instead of butter--I like the flavor of olive oil much better.  Will try that next time instead.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was quick, easy, and delicious. I ate it along with some salmon for dinner. I wish I had used more than 2 cloves of garlic, and seasoned a bit more heavily. Will definitely make this again!

I was leary about this recipe but decided to make it for Thanksgiving anyway. I had many compliments on the dish and I liked it quite a bit. I used less rosemary then the recipe called for and I am glad I did because it was slightly overpowering as it was in my opinion.

Loved them.....followed one of the recommendations to sautee them on the stove for a bit, and ended up doing the whole thing on the stove...... ended up amazing. Nice and crispy on the outside, and soft and moist on the inside!

These were ok. They made a LOT more than 2 servings, more like 6 servings. I tripled the amount of the butter sauce, and I thought they still needed more sauce. Next time I may cut them into very small pieces and use more sauce. Overall ok, not my favorite recipe for potatoes though.

This is such any easy dish! I actually used canned whole potatoes and it was fine. I am sure it would have been better with fresh potatoes though. I used a lot of garlic and added some onion. My husband is a picky eater and it is hard to get him to eat veggies but he loved it!

AWESOME!!  We love these potatoes with just about any grilled out dinner.  It is perfect with chicken, fish or just about any meal I can think of.  I have also some fresh Thyme and it is wonderful too.  My family isn't too excited about the spinach leaves but personally I think they are delicious.  This is a winner in our house!

This was a great side dish, easy and very good.  Next time I would use less rosemary as it can be overpowering and a lot more spinach.  I used 2 cups and still could have afforded to use more.

These were good! I was looking for a recipe to use up the rest of the spinach and potatoes I had. I did like another reviewer suggested and sauteed the potatoes with the garlic in oil, then added rosemary, baked for 15 mins. covered and 15 uncovered and followed the rest of the directions. I really liked the crispiness of them and the garlic/rosemary taste. It also made my house smell really good while cooking!

Was alright - didn't think the butter would be enough, so I made it 4 tbsp!  Coated well... didn't care THAT much for the spinach... was more of a garnish for the dish / main entree.  Still smelled and tasted delicious!

This dish was very good! I used extra virgin olive oil instead of butter to make it healthier and roasted the potatoes a little longer because I prefer well done. Served with grilled chicken and stemead cauliflower.

very good!  Like the others....I think you can use a lot of spinach....adds great flavor.  My potatoes did not get as crispy as I like....(what is the secret please tell me)  But it WAS a great sidedish and I will use this again.  I love the receipes on this site.  I'm a novice chef that likes simple, easy to prepare items that have good taste...I like this place for that....I keep looking for more as well.

Yes- these are that good! I just now ate it as a meal in itself- very hearty and I used a ton of spinach (it really does shrink a lot)... yum! Thanks for a truly 5-star recipe!

This was wonderful! I hate when people change the recipe then review, but I will admit that I used rainbow chard instead of spinach and it was so pretty! I'll be making this again.

These potatoes are great! Used tiny red potatoes, halved, and followed exactly.  The crusty bits of garlic tasted really good with the potatoes. Next time I would try a mixture of butter and olive oil instead of just butter.

This was very simple, but delicious!!! I added some fresh basil as well, just because I had some on hand. Wonderful with any kind of fresh herbs. We had this served with steak, and grilled zucchini, and this dish was my favorite part of the meal!!!

Was great!!  Added extra spinach and did not add any cheese - also added a little green onions as I had it on hand about 3/4 of the way through cooking and broiled for a little bit for crispiness.

I did not add cheese - certainly not needed as these were wonderful without.  Loved the simple addition of spinach and I will add more next time. I did need to cook longer - almost 20 min. longer but my red potatoes were med. sized. Thanks Lisa - this was enjoyed by all.

My fiancé and I thought that this was a good potato recipe, but we’ve definitely tasted better potatoes before.  It was easy to make and would be good for busy weeknights.  The use of spinach and rosemary was nice as well.  I’d make it again.

Excellent ! I followed the recipe pretty closely. I made 8 servings but I halved the amount of butter since I knew I was going to drizzle them with olive oil at the end and sprinkle some parmesan.  My husband adored these potatoes and they are beautiful with the addition of the spinach.  Elegant and delicious. Will absolulety make over and over.  Thank You !

This got rave reviews at our house, even with the picky kids!  I add the garlic and rosemary for the last 15 minutes of cooking only, to avoid scorched, brown garlic bits.

Wonderful recipe!  The first time, I made it according to the recipe and absolutely loved it.  But I have to watch my cholesterol, so the second time I made it with olive oil instead of butter.  It was still wonderful.  (But what can be as good as butter, really?)

Waaay too much butter in my opinion. The potatoes ended up greasy. It's much better to toss them in olive oil, better flavor than the butter.  The fresh rosemary and garlic made the house smell wonderful, but the taste didn't live up to it.

These were superb, and so pretty. Something you can definitely serve if you're trying to impress someone. I omitted the rosemary due to personal preferences. Hubby picked out all his spinach, but I thought it was a lovely addition as did our dinner guest. I can't wait to make these again.

Perfect recipe! Instead of rosemary, I used basil and thyme to pair with the roast that I was making. It worked out wonderfully.

I thought this was great! I did add a bit more garlic. I thought this was a perfect combination of flavors. All in all this was a great recipe and worth making over and over!

This recipe is very good, although I think amount of potato called for is far too much. I only used one really large white potato and kept the butter measurement pretty much the same.  I didn't have fresh rosemary so I substituted a good tsp of dry, and also added a large sprinkle of parmesan a couple of minutes prior to tossing the spinach in.  This dish had great flavor and I loved the added greens in here.  Thanks for the recipe, I'll definitely make this one often.

Easy side dish!  Tastes good and the colors are beautiful on the plate.  Sprinkled parmesan cheese over the top during last few minutes of baking.

Recipe was "ok" at best.  I tried to use butter as the recipe called for and everything clumped together.  I had to remake using oil in place of butter.

Wow.  These are some of the most delicious potatoes I have ever eaten.  This recipe was easy to make and rewarding.  I followed the recipe with a few changes.  Instead of small red potatoes, I used white, and I let them remain in the oven for an extra 5 minutes to give the inside a softer texture while still reserving a crispy skin.  5 stars, though.  Absolute love.

This recipe was easy and tasted fabulous. It is worth the extra step to saute the garlic before pouring over the potatoes. It's a new way to get more spinach in your diet.  My family ate it all!

Very tasty and nutritious.  I really enjoyed the combination of potatoes and spinach.  I added more spinach since DH and I both like it.  This my first time to use fresh rosemary and it added a very nice scent and flavor.  I think I would like a bit more garlic.  The spices did not overpower the veggies.  This made a lovely side dish for the Filet Mignon with Rich Balsamic Glaze on this site.

These were okay.  My husband, a picky eater (as in, he only likes "normal" foods) loved them.

You really need to watch how much sea salt you sprinkle on - I think I put too much on it, and that's what turned me off.  Had it not been for that, I would've loved them.

This recipe needs a better measurement for the sea salt.

To make sure these got done I boiled them for 8 minutes first then put them in the oven for about 20 minutes at 350. It worked perfectly. I used 4 cloves of fresh garlic and some paprika also. It looked so pretty when the spinach was added. I did not drizzle with olive oil and did not even see a need for it. Sprinkled with parmasan cheese and they were so tasty!!!

This was absolutely awesome!!! The potatoes were great. Sea salt definitely made a difference but the spinach not so much. I would highly recommend this recipe as is. I did however grind some peppercorn over the melted butter and it was a great addition.

I'm not a potato eater, but these were very good.  They had a lot of flavor and were cooked perfectly.  I cut them into small cubes as I only had large red potatoes on hand.  For so few ingredients, these are very tasty.

Pretty good overall.  After reading reviews, I added extra spinach.  I should have also added extra butter.  Parmesan melted on top at the end adds great flavor.  This dish makes a beautiful and inviting presentation.

I made this for a friend visiting town and it went over very well.  Only thing I would do differently is bake this in a single layer like the recipe says.  I just dumped it in a casserole dish and they didn't crisp up but were a little greasy for me...still delicious, just not crisp enough for my liking.  I added this to my master recipe book.  Single layer next time.

This was fantastic. I made them almost exactly as instructed, and they were delicious! A great way to get a veggie and a starch in one dish! Yes, it does take slightly longer than recommended to cook.

Great recipe!  Served with Pork Tenderloin and steamed green beans.  The presentation was perfect!! The butter helps to crisp the potatoes better than cooking the whole time in olive oil.

I used about 6 oz of baby fresh spinach and more butter.  The potatoes were still hard after 30 min, so I put them in for 15 more minutes and they were perfect.  The presentation is wonderful.  I did add some shredded cheddar cheese when I took them out of the oven.  I still added more butter and sour cream when I ate them becuase they were a little dry.

These were pretty good.  I doubled the amount of spinach but still could've used more to suit my taste.  I also pan fried the potatoes first and used olive oil instead of butter.  I would've liked it if they were a tad crunchier but the flavour was really nice.

My son who never eat potatoes, unless they are fries,ate these. They were great! If asked to bring potatoes, i'll take these but at home next time I will add a pound of spinach. Per the recipe, the spinach seems to only serves as a garnish.  Can't wait to try it again.

This looks and tastes great.  I didn't have rosemary so I substituted with oregano.  I used lots of spinach which was recommended and the next time I'll used more garlic.  This will be done many times again in my house.

I will definitely spray the pan first next time as the potatoes got stuck.  They were very nicely roasted and crispy.  I used double the spinach and it still could use more because it welts away to nothing.  The taste wasn't as fabulous as I expected.  I probably won't make this again.

Delicious recipe...fast and easy! I do emphasize that you don't overcook the rosemary because it will give off a bitter tast..so really just cook unit fragant. I added an extra cup of spinach, one cup is not quite enough. Will definitely make again.

As far as potato side dishes go I rate this a 5 star. It's a great basic recipe that you can really use as a springboard. I added carrots and fresh basil and extra parmesan cheese.

This dish turned out very good.  However, I don't think I will combine the potatoes and spinach next time.  We didn't care for spinach with rosemary flavoring.

This came out very good.  I used small red potatoes and it came out nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and flavorful!  I had to substitute dried rosemary (1/3 of the amount of fresh) and used cooked frozen leaf spinach on top, since I had it leftover.  I'm sure it would be even better with fresh.  I will definitely make this again!

I cheated and just threw everything except the spinach in a roasting pa. I had Yukon gold potatoes that I cut into chunks. I had about 6oz of spinach and layered it on when the potatoes were done. Took about five minutes to get the spinach the way we liked it. Served it with Trader Joe’s cod and it was delicious.

All went well, but wish the spinach looked a bit spiffier at the end.  But it tasted very good.  Will use the recipe again though.

Excellent! For something so easy to make this was delicious. Did sauté the potatoes a little first with the rosemary, garlic and butter. Added some chopped onion and some fresh mushrooms to the sauté as well. Really good side dish and will be making it again.

I must have found this recipe on here years ago; I have been making this dish for over ten years. Everyone raves about it. I use a glass casserole dish and it works just fine. I usually "doctor-up" recipes to my liking, but this is one of the few that I love just the way it is.

I love it when a dish is dead easy but does something new. In this case adding spinach at the end was the new thing, and it was a delicious way to combine starch with a vegetable. Not to mention making the potatoes look more interesting. Adding it to my repertoire!

Cooking time was off.  Weren't done when everything else was.  These were okay but nothing special. The spinach was the best part as it was crispy.  Probably won't repeat.

My husband and I both liked this dish, but agreed that the combination of potatoes & spinach was a little strange. Since both are a different kind of mushy, the texture just didn't really work for us. Also, the rosemary was very strong—next time I would use half as much. I would also put these on broil at the end for 3-5 minutes to crisp up the outside even more. Good starter recipe for a yummy dish.

Cooked for about 15 minutes longer to make the skins a little crispy. Otherwise this was really tasty and super easy! Good for a college student on a budget.

Mmmmmmm..... I easy and delicious. No need to return to oven  with spinach, as adding it to the hot potatoes wilted it perfectly. I didn't measure my spinach but I'm sure it was more than called for.   I'm making this for Christmas!

This was delicious! My husband said it was one of his favorite sides ever. I did follow the advice of others and added garlic, onions and cayenne to the butter mixture. Baked covered for 15 minutes and then uncovered for the other 15 minutes. I doubled the recipe, and it came out a little too buttery for my taste but that was my fault as I doubled the butter as well (no fault of the original recipe). Will be a regular staple for us!

These were good. The addition of spinach is a nice way to add veg and a different take on roasted potatoes. Did boost the oven temp. to 425.

These were delicious and easy. I didn't have red potatoes so sliced up some organic russets. I added extra butter and garlic as I seemed to have more potatoes than recipe. I went back for seconds and scraped the bottom of the baking dish. YUMMY!!!

Used olive oil, garlic and paprika to sauté the potatoes before placing them in the oven, followed another comments advice on cooking 15 min covered and 15 uncovered. Then took it out and tossed the spinach in and cooked for 3 more minutes. Delicious!

It was okay. I would not recommend the sea salt.. it made it "salty".  I used Swiss Chard instead of Spinach. I like being able to use more superfoods.

This one's a staple in my home now, and it's my boyfriend's favourite potato dish! I like to use yellow potatoes instead of red since they're both our favourites. I usually substitute the butter with olive oil for a lower-fat alternative, but they're fantastic either way. (I also like to heavily up the garlic amount, we're both big garlic fans. )

This is an excellent recipe! Being a cheese lover, I disappointingly forgot to put cheese on this dish...BUT it was still amazing! I also used Olive Oil (wasn't paying enough attention to the recipe), but when I realized my error I added the butter anyways. I used my cast-iron skillet to brown the garlic and rosemary, tossed the potatoes in, and put the whole skillet in the oven. Love when I get to use my cast iron! The recipe is full of flavor with just the right amount of crunch...we have wild golden potatoes grown in our backyard (planted them once and they just keep producing with no attention, no pests, nothing but pure goodness - all they need is water) so I used those. The addition of the spinach was superb, but I love, love spinach. What a nice bonus! This would be a very simple, but impressive dish for guests. Thank you!

I microwaved the small potatoes for five minutes first to cut down on the oven time---everyone was hungry! I was happy that our teen house guest from Hong Kong liked it, too.

I really liked the seasoned potatoes and would probably make those again without the spinach.  The spinach was an easy addition and a good way to use up a bag of leftovers.

I made these without spinach; I also used regular red potatoes and chopped them in small-ish chunks. And to top it off, I don't own a ceramic baking dish so I baked them in a regular, non-stick one. Nonetheless, we all liked them. My boyfriend was especially impressed, and he is not a big potato lover. He said that these potatoes has so much more flavor than the ones his mom makes. Well that did it for me! Definitely a keeper!

Very tasty, although it needed about an hour instead of 30 minutes in the oven. I didn't have any fresh rosemary so I substituted for some dry thyme and dry sweet basil. Everyone loved it. Thanks.

It's an easy and pretty side dish. I served them along with a filet of orange roughy. I also added one extra cup of spinach. Next time I might add even more.

These potatoes were fantastic. Even the kids ate the spinich with no complaints. I sprinkled pregrated (large grate) parmesan cheese for spaghetti (best I could do)and baked another 5 min and it turned out great.

I liked these.  I have many potatoes + rosemary recipes, so what I particularly liked was the addition of some greens.  The mix of colors looks great and of course it's more healthy.

Great potato recipe.  I used a whole 10 oz. bag of baby spinach and it was perfect.  My whole family enjoyed this dish.  I did cook my potatoes about 15 minutes longer to get them nice and tender.

Though this recipe was exactly what I was in the mood for, it was a bit bland for my taste.  I did everything the recipe called for, I did not change a thing.  I will definitely be making this again but next time I may add more garlic or maybe even some red onion.  My boyfriend loved it but it was just "ok" for me.

I usually don't like to use rosemary, but this was a great recipe. I baked these for about an hour, stirring frequently because my boyfriend and I like them crispy. I forgot to use the cheese, but they don't need cheese. I will try with cheese the next time. I will definitly make again and again.

I am so glad I tried this, the most tasty and easy potatoes I have ever made.  I agree with other reviewers; more spinach.  Also, I subbed EVOO for the butter, just a personal preference.  Other than that, I couldn't be happier.  Thanks for the awesome recipe.

My family loves this recipe every time I make it.  I never use Rosemary because I don't have any, and it still tastes good. There are never any potatoes left!  Great side dish!

These were so good!  I didn't have rosemary so I used a tsp of dried basil and it turned out great!  I think next time I will use olive oil instead of butter for a healthier version.  Also, I did need to up the cooking time to 45 minutes.  After the 30 minutes it called for, I tossed them every 5 minutes until they were done.  More spinach would've been nice, too.

Loved these.  I had no spinach left so made them without.  Used a little more garlic and they were very tasty.  I used small little red potatoes (almost bite size) and cooked in a good creuset roaster.  Very yummy!  Took about 45 minutes at 400 degrees with the small potatoes.
Thanks for sharing!

Loved this dish! I added some chopped shallots with the potatoes, but other than that, didn't change a thing. Loved the spinach mixed in with the potatoes... different, but a refreshing twist on a new way to serve spinach. Very tasty!

This was really good although I baked for longer than posted yet my potatoes were still a little firm.  Next time I will cut into smaller chunks.  Served with G's Flank steak.  Yum!!

These were fantastic - followed others advise and added a handful more spinach - forgot to add the cheese at the end and it was still delicious - I'm adding this to my cooking repertoire.

All I can say is "WOW!"  I was some what skeptical as to how the spinach would work with this meal so I did not add too much of it.  The spinach was definitely a delight to the meal.  Next time I won't be so scared and will probably ending up using more than the meal called for.  I also used 3 TBSP of butter vs. the 2 TBSP the recipe called for.  I also used Tony Chacheras (sp) seasoning instead of salt and pepper.  But My daughter and I both LOVED this side dish! I would highly recommend this to dish to anyone.  This is a great way to combine your starch with some "green" vegetables.

Very good core recipe.  I screwed it up and used 1T dried crushed rosemary which took right over.  I might leave the rosemary out next time, or at least use my head.  The potatoes turned out well though, and the greens in them were very good.

The best roasted potatoes I've ever had or made. The greens were a great addition, and the dish made my whole house smell wonderful.
