Comfort food!  I subbed pinto beans for the others, so I cooked those with the rye berries.  It wasn't until I was enjoying my serving that I realized I had forgotten to add the cabbage!  I'll put it in when I reheat this delightful soup!  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed your directions, except added canned white northern beans with the vegetables, instead of the cannellini beans. (The dry beans probably would have been better if I had them.) We never had borscht before. It was pretty good, but I expect it is an acquired taste.  We'll have plenty of opportunity to find out, as it made enough to last us for a couple of weeks.  There are just 2 of us.  Anyway, thanks for the recipe.  It was fun trying something different.  Mar. 14 update: I put some of this in freezer containers and saved. My husband and I happily did acquire a taste for it, and now we love it.  Just had some for lunch today, and my hubby asked, is that all?  There wasn't enough left for seconds. :) Have to increase the rating to 5 stars. Congratulations for a distinctly unique and very delicious recipe! Now I have another good use for all my rye berries.

It was a lot of work compared to how we usually cook, but turned out good!  Great way to use rye berries, which is why I tried it.  We didn't use exact amounts--some extra here and there, like with the tomatoes--and it made a huge pot!  We are going to have a lot to freeze for later.  Thanks for the recipe!

This has a three-star taste, but the recipe itself gave me some trouble. First off, 2 cups of water was nowhere near sufficient for the rye berries. After about 1.5 hours, they were scalded and stuck to the bottom of the pot. I tried again with three cups of water and had success. Problem number two (this is minor, but still inconvenient) was that the beets were still quite crunchy after 30 minutes of simmering. It took more like 50-55 minutes to get things to the right consistency. As for the taste . . . well, it tastes like a bunch of vegetables cooked in water. That shouldn't have come as a surprise, I suppose. And that's not a bad thing. There just isn't anything particularly special about this recipe. I had hoped it would be more flavorful. I'll stick with the Ukrainian Red Borscht Soup in the future, which is exceptional.

Did not care for this! Basically a cup of blaahhh... not alot of flavor. Will not make this again & have taken it out of my recipe box. Too bad, I'm an experienced cook and most recipes on here are actually quite tasty.

This is the first borscht I ever made, and it was grrreat!  I made a  few modifications because of what I had on hand.  I used wheat berries instead of rye berries, and kidney beans instead of the cannelini.  I also garnished the soup with shredded cheese and used stale homemade bread as croutons.  I'll definitely be making this again.  Thanks, Robyn!

Good as it is, but I added a big if pork sausage to add a bit of salt and fat. So good. Just fresh clean flavored.
