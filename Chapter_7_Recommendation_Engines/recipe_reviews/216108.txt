DANGER!
Hard to give a rating, beause the turkey turns out great, but it MAY kill your crock pot! For that reason, I'm giving it 4 stars, with a few words of caution.
Although I have made this delicious recipe 3 or 4 times, last night was a REAL problem! I mistakenly turned my cooker to high, instead of low. I heard some crackles, and passed it off to the turkey skin, but later that night when I put water in the crock to soak it, I ended up with water all over the counter!  Those sounds were being made by the crock as it cracked!  I called the manufacturer today, and they said that no matter what the recipe says, you should at least cover the bottom of the crock with fluid. I WILL make this recipe again in the future, but will add the fluid and souble check the temperature, in case that's what caused the problem.

I believe that Allrecipes has edited my original recipe.  The amount of seasoning is approximately 3 teaspoons for all 6 turkey legs--works out to approximately 1/2 teaspoon each leg.  Or, use as much or as little to your liking!  Sorry for the confusion--not sure why the editors changed this.

I made this yesterday. I used 1 pkg of legs & 1 pkg of thighs. I sprayed the foil with nonstick spray. Also I sprayed the turkey pieces a little so the seasonings would stick better to the meat. I tried 4 different seasonings out of my cabinet  put a different seasoning on each piece of turkey to see which one turns out the best. After removing the pieces from the slow cooker & removing the foil, the turkey fell right off the bone. The bottom of the slow cooker was full of juices from the turkey pieces. I do believe that the turkey was in the slow cooker TOO long. The skin on the turkey was almost completely gone. When the bones were removed from the turkey they looked like they were all cooked out & dry. The meat was juicy & tender. Next time I make this I'll take the turkey out when the internal temp is 170 degrees in the thickest part of a thigh. Yes, I would make this again. Tom, from Wisconsin

I like the idea and the simplicity, but it is way too heavy on the poultry seasoning. Next time I will use about 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon per leg.  Definitely remove the skin before serving.    I also plan to wrap in some cubed potatoes and carrots with each leg.  2/4/12 - Now that the recipe has been corrected this goes to 5 stars for someone who does know the difference between a tablespoon and a teaspoon.

This recipe was pretty good. I rated it four stars because I love turkey and it is awesome that I can skip the oven and make it in my slow cooker. Minus one star because of the nature of cooking the turkey legs for that long. The bone starts to splinter off and if you take bites you get slivers of bone in your mouth. So, when plating, cut the meat off and serve without the bone. It's disappointed because one of my favorite things about turkey legs is picking up the leg and eating it like I'm a lord in a medieval castle...lol. But, what can you do? 

In short, good, moist turkey that needs to be served off the bone. this is important if cooking for kids or company.

This was delicious. Instead of putting the foiled turkey legs in a dry cooker, I placed a cup of water in the bottom and used a trivit to put the turkey legs on, therefore ensuring the cooker had some liquid and would not be damaged.
I also used all purpose seasoning which I sprinkled over the legs before wrapping in foil. I certainly will be cooking these up again. Thank you for posting.

This is the BEST crock pot turkey-in-foil recipe EVER! I used my own spices & herbs (or you could marinate overnight if you choose). After rinsing the turkey I took my spices & herbs and rubbed them all over each piece, wrapped each leg (or thighs & legs we prefer dark meatbut you can use breasts as well) into a piece of foil. Fold the foil into a "pouch" and toss them into the crock pot. Cook for 8 hours on low. When it's fully cooked your dinner is ready and it is super tasty and so tender it just fell off the bone! Word of caution - be careful when opening the pouches, they can get steamy. I'll use this recipe again & again! Great for when you just feel like some turkey and it isn't the holidays (or even for the holidays if you're not cooking a whole turkey). You can also use this for cooking chicken as well. I like to 'over cook' the amount I need, let it cool, & strip it from the bone, put the meat into freezer bags and when your ready for some turkey or chicken salad, or some yummy lunch meat just thaw it out and you've got a whole bunch of really delicious versatile meat! Much cheaper than buying it packaged from the grocery store and much healthier for you and your family too! I think the key here is to experiment with a variety of spices and herbs. You can make lemon or teriyaki chicken, or BBQ'd turkey or chicken by just dribbling a little BBQ sauce onto the meat into each "pouch". There are just endless ways to spice up this delicious fast and easy meal maker!

What a great way to cook Thanksgiving style turkey on any night of the week. I cooked 3 legs, which ranged from sorta small to pretty darn big, for 6 hours. They were all tender and moist.  The skin was gross though, so you definitely want to remove it before serving these for dinner.

For those of you who are confused by the measurements for the poultry seasoning; 3 tsp = 1 TB.  If you divide the 3 TB by the 6 legs, you will get 1.5 tsp per leg.  Hope this helps with the confusion.

This was good. I just eyeballed the seasonings and made sure the turkey legs were well coated. I sprinkled with poultry seasoning, garlic salt, pepper and some Tony Chacheres Creole Seasoning (which is really good to use in place of salt as it gives a lot of flavor). Wrapped in foil and put them in the crock pot for about 5 hours. They were falling off the bone. I liked having them wrapped in foil because it made for easy transfer and cleanup.

Very good. Great for turkey pieces. We like turkey year 'round, and this recipe will be adapted to a dry barbecue rub this summer. I love crock-pot recipes. When it comes to seasonings, always use your own judgement.

Made this for Thanksgiving today! Loved it! Used seasoned salt, garlic, pepper and poultry seasoning. I fried the skin first in the skillet before wrapping them in foil. Added 1/4 cup of water at the bottom of the slow cooker. Cooked for 6.5 hours on low

Wow!  First time ever making turkey.  I was always too afraid it being bland and tough.  But my turkey legs came out so flavorful (next time I will use a tad bit more salt). They were falling off the bone.  My husband first words was WOW!  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

The Ingredient list calls for 3 TABLESPOONS of poultry seasoning.   The Directions call for 1 1/2 TEASPOONS of poultry seasoning.   Sounds great; I'll cross my fingers & give it 5 stars.

This was really good.  I made it exactly as written, and no, I didn't add water to the bottom.  I cooked it on low, and the turkey legs made broth as it cooks, which fills the bottom of the crockpot.  Legs were very tender and flavorful.

I wanted to check this out...and by gosh it worked...
Took the hind end of a turkey...seasoned, put in a carrot,celery & onion, double wrap in foil...did not tie it up...cooked for 9 hours.
Pulled it out of the pot, opened foil & the dark meat people oh & Ah.

Took another two (2)-- 14#ers, cut in half & joined them. the middle screamed for stuffing...put some in & tied up the bird.  Cooked in a cooking bag...wow, when I learn how to down load the pictures..beyond wonderful.
This recipe had me curious enough to work with, and the courage to try.
So, thanks...Also, I took a bolt cutter for the leg nubs to remove the tendons after cooking...also easy.

The amount of poultry seasoning given in the 'Ingredients' list and then given in the 'Directions' don't jibe. I'm pretty sure that the amount sprinkled on each turkey leg is supposed to be 1/2 tablespoon and not the 1 1/2 tablespoon shown in the 'Directions'.

I was skeptical at first but they did come out tender and hubby loved them.  I only cooked 3-4 legs because that's all my slow cooker could fit so I shortened the time a little.  They did not come out crispy and brown like the picture so that person must have seared, grilled or broiled them afterwards.  I will try this in the oven when time is short.

Was a little concerned about wrapping the turkey leg in foil, however, it turned out nice.  The meat was very tender and fell off the bone,  Next time I will check the legs at 6 hrs and consider  putting them in a brine prior to cooking.  Will cook this again.

This was a quick and easy way to cook turkey legs!  I sprinkled seasoned salt and garlic salt on the legs before wrapping them up.  I did put a small amount of water at the bottom of the crockpot, too.  Yummy!

Great recipe! And this is coming from non dark meat lovers. The only thing we do different is when the turkey is done, we carefully place the legs on the George Foreman to crisp up the skin.  It's wonderful.

The turkey legs didn't fit into my crockpot, so I put the wrapped and seasoned legs into my dutch oven, set the oven at 200 degrees, and crossed my fingers!  I had to leave for work, so I was REALLY nervous (afraid that I'd burn down my house!), but when I arrived home 9 hours later, the house was NOT on fire, and the turkey legs were wonderful!!!

Wrapping the legs in foil in a slow cooker was a great idea. I pulled the skin down on the legs, sprinkled them with kosher salt, coarse pepper, garlic granules and "beer can chicken rub". Pulled the skin back up and wrapped them with the foil.  7 hours later...

This turkey is delicious and so easy! I put this on low for 7 hours with a couple tablespoons of water at the bottom of the pot. The meat fell off the bone and my very picky 5 year old actually asked for seconds.  The turkey went well with buttery pasta shells and broccoli.

Easy enough, and the meat fell off the bone. I added fresh jalapenos and mushrooms. I only had turkey thighs handy, but hey it's dark meat no? :-) Thanks for sharing.

Loved it!  Super easy!  We just put salt and pepper on the legs.  Cooked ours for 7 hours.  Fall off the bone great!  Perfect for pulled turkey sandwiches.

Don't you people know the difference between a Tablespoon and a teaspoon. Even the person that entered this wonderful recipe does not know the difference. Maybe to eliminate situations with measurements, and educate the cooks, at the same time - ALLRECIPES would put out a chart and make it very available and easy to use for all.Thank you, Thank you ALLRECIPES for all the wonderful recipes that you have offered us.

I had a lot of turkey legs to cook so I actually made this two nights in a row using different seasoning each night. My 7 year LOVED it. My family raved about it both nights and didn't care that we had it back to back. I always remove the skin. The first night I used mr weber beer can chicken seasoning with some salt and pepper. Wrapped each in foil. Then I peeled two whole onions and cut slits in them and used the same seasoning and wrapped in foil. Cooked on low for 7 hours and when I came home the smell was amazing coming from the garage!!  I made fried broccoli as the side dish. Just so yummy. The second night I used mr weber Montreal chicken seasoning with salt and pepper wrapped in foil cooked on low for about 7 hours. This time I made extra so I can use the extra chicken for homemade chicken and noodles tomorrow night!!  No onions tho the second night, instead I made teriyaki broccoli and cornbread stuffing. My 7 year old devoured it!!  The chicken falls off the bone and anyone should know to cut the meat away from the bone versus picking it up as the meat falls off immediately. I will even use the juice as part of the broth after I cool it and take away the fat top layer. This is an extremely easy meal. Thank you for the recipe.

This recipe was awesome, I used turkey thighs instead of legs and added my own spices of kosher salt, paprika, garlic powder and rosemary.  I never measure spices I just know what I like so it was not a concern on the amount of seasoning,  My family gave it rave reviews,

Makes perfect turkey legs! Only thing missing is the crispy skin...I guess you could pop them in the broiler. The meat was sooo moist and flavorful. My mom even enjoys it and she's not fond of turkey.

This made incredibly flavorful turkey. I was cautious and put a little water in the bottom of the slow cooker. Also, I don't know how everyone was getting dissolved bones. We didn't have that problem at all. The kids loved it and this is absolutely going in the slow cooker rotation!

I used a sweet and spicy BBQ rub and cooked on low for 6 hours.  Perfect and tender.  Will cook turkey like this forever!

It was a waste of food. The legs were seasoned as instructed, cooked according to the directions and the results were horrible. The meat was under seasoned and over cooked. We consumed, I say consumed because it was not eating, a portion of two legs and threw away the other two.

Makes for super tender and moist turkey.  I took the skin off my leg and sprinkled the spices directly onto the meat.  Left the skin on for my husband who likes it.  Came out great both ways.  None of the juice dripped out of the foil the way I had it wrapped.  I was worried about cracked crockpot so before I started I actually added a small amount of water to the bottom of the crockpot which ended up evaporating.  Highly recommend adding water or making sure the juice from the legs drips into the bottom of the crockpot.

I made this today and the kids loved it. I increased the seasonings and added some chicken broth to the bottom of the crock. I was afraid of cracking. Delicious, will definitely make again.

Very tasty. I didn't really measure the spices just sprinkled them on. After cooking the skin is really gross so I removed it before serving. Family enjoyed this. And the juice that is left in the crockpot makes amazing gravy!

The flavor was good . It was easy to make. The reason that this dish only gets 3 star is because of the fact when I think of a thanksgiving dinner I want crisp skin. This way of cooking the legs does not make crisp skin. The photo for this dish is misleading .

I'm working on Thanksgiving so I'm going to try this.
My hubby doesn't cook... so he is a lover Turkey Legs and I prefer the breasts... so I'm only concerned about the crockpot having no liquid for 7 hours...

They came out good, but could have been better. Cooked it 5 hours and probably would have been juicier if cooked 4.5 hours. Next time I’m going to season under the skin

I also sprayed the legs with a little butter and used knorr chicken seasoning, salt and pepper. I made 4 legs and cooked low they were done in 4 hrs. Then I used them to mix into some collard greens!! The turkey was heavenly!! Great recipe

Like anyone I was a bit skeptical...but I’m
a believer! The meat was so tender, just falling off the bone; I will definitely cook my turkey legs like this in the future... forget about turning on the oven.

Super easy. Used peppercorn mix instead of poultry seasoning. Used leftover meat for taco soup the next night.

Six turkey legs do not fit in my crock pot. Maybe they bought smaller ones? Also not good for no liquid in the pot.

I made this yesterday for Thanksgiving  to go alongside a turkey breast and did not make one change.   It was such an easy recipe and those that like dark meat loved it!  To quote my son in law, "this is money".!  Will make this every year from now on.  Took all of 6 1/2 hours.

My husband and I love turkey legs and wings.  We typically bake them in the oven and they would come out a little tough.  I ran across this recipe an decided to give it a try.  Absolutely the best turkey legs and wings that I've ever had.  I altered the recipe with spices that I like (paprika, garlic salt, adobo seasoning).  My husband was thrilled also.

My family lives in an apt with a small oven, so our slow-cooker is a great friend, especially on Thanksgiving Day. This makes for a delicious and easy way to eat turkey while focusing on other activities.

Tender & flavorful. Best of all easy!!!! My only question is do you HAVE to cook it in aluminum foil? I've been reading about how aluminum can leach into your hot foods.

My slow cooker held three legs. I sprinkled seasoning on them and wrapped them in foil. I put about 1/2 cup of water on bottom ( just in case) and they came out tender and juicy. I cooked on low for three hours then checked the internal temp. I pick the skin and bones off and served them with mashed potatoes and gravy made from drippings. YUM!

This is one of my 'go to' meals. It's so easy to make. I put different seasoning, based on my likings, in the wrapped turkey leg. Comes out perfect each time.

Bought 2 packages of turkey drumsticks on sale, wondered what to do with them, and then found this recipe.  It seems most reviewers made their own combinations of seasonings, so I did likewise.  I used 4 kinds:  poultry seasoning, onion powder, garlic salt, and cajun seasoning.  I made a total of about 1/3 cup, pulled the skin down halfway, and rubbed some on the flesh, pulled the skin back into place, and rubbed more on the skin itself.  As a number of reviewers recommended, a put a small amount of water in the bottom of the crockpot.  After wrapping in foil, I cooked on High for about 4 hours and 1 hour on low.  Family accepted very well!

Good, simple recipe. The meat is tender and just slides off the bone. It's also good with chicken - same cooking time, but increase the amount of chicken. Great by itself or to make shredded chicken/turkey for something else.

A great no-fuss way to cook turkey.  I used turkey thighs and they came out just fine.  Served with cranberry relish, stuffing and green beans so the meal was a snap!

I learned that removing the turkey legs from the turkey and cooking them separately, the turkey breast will come out more tender.  After some trouble removing the legs, I eyeballed the seasoning and but did not wrap in aluminum foil because I didn't think it was necessary.  I added a little water to the bottom. The meat was tender, not oily, flavorful and fell off the bones.  I was cautious to remove the splintered bone as recommended by another reviewer (GOOD TIP!).  I will use the juice to make the gravy, because cooking the breast separately produced very little juice (mostly fat) and the breast was more tender than usual.

An excellent, no fuss way to prepare turkey.  My kids and my husband loved the results and I loved the ease and the clean up.  Only problem is that my grocery store doesn't always have turkey legs in the poultry case!

These were good. Just need more seasoning for my taste. Will make again and play around with my seasonings.
