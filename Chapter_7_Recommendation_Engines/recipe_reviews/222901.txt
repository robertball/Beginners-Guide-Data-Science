This is a lot better than I had expected it to be. I used 1/2 teaspoon of dried thyme in lieu of sprigs, added 1/2 teaspoon of rosemary and used 2 teaspoons lemon peel and 1/4 cup lemon juice instead of a zesting /juicing a lemon. I was really, really impressed. There are several distinct, yet not overpowering flavors in this dish. While like most vegetarian dishes this was a bit, well, mushy, the kale was a nice addition. I may throw in some extra diced carrot at the end for crunch next time. Definitely a keeper though!

That was so good! I ate a whole bowl before I realized I didn't put any lemon in it so I didn't end up putting any in. I only used 1/4 tsp. of crushed red pepper because my children do not like anything spicy. It was still a little spicy for them but my husband and I loved it! I also used a sprouted bean medley instead of just lentils because that is what I had on had. Loved this recipe! Will make it again for sure!

Just what I was looking for! Always looking for a way to cook the seasons best from the farmers market. Served with Grilled Chicken Kabobs from this site.

Loved this recipe! Tasty, healthy and filling. I made changes to suit what I had availabe. Don't know if it was dinosaur kale - I just used a big thick leafy kale with red veins. If you fold the leaf in 1/2 you can cut right down the big middle rib to take it out. Then roll up the leaf and cut it up into strips that way. I also used 2 carrots instead of 1, and substituted 1/2 tsp of dried thyme leaves for the fresh. In step 2 - I used one 19 0z can of rinsed and drained lentils, then added them in with 1 x 19 0z can of diced undrained tomatos, skipped the chicken stock all together as my lentils were already cooked from being canned. Then after that heated up a few minutes I added the kale and cooked it for 5 minutes or so. I also only added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice as my boyfriend doesn't like a strong lemon flavor and you could still taste the lemon with the juice from 1/2 of a lemon in this. Was still excellent with these changes and ready in a much shorter timeframe so was very easy and fast to get this on the table. 15-20 minutes from start to finish. I also served it with a baked chicken breast and toasted ciabiatta buns. It would go very well with pork also if you wanted to add meat to your plate. But this recipe is very good on its own too! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is one of my favorite recipes. I'm vegetarian and my husband is vegan. Instead of using chicken stock, I just use water. I add a little bit of cumin to add more flavor. The vitamin C in the lemon, kale, and tomatoes helps your body absorb the protein and iron. (Plant based iron and protein is harder to absorb.) there is so much nutrition in this dish with no compromise on flavor. I highly recommend it. It's pretty easy to make too.

Really great side dish - I used dried thyme and added one jalape√±o (omitted the red pepper flakes) to add some color and heat. I also added two more carrots. This could be a great meal if you add some roasted sweet potato and/or grilled mushrooms! 

Some reviewers complained about the lentils being mushy. To prevent this, check them at 30-35mins. Mine were ready to eat after only a half hour.

Love this recipe, I make it almost once a week. The only real change that I make is to use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.

Very simple and good.  I used dried thyme leaves and lemon juice, because that's all I had on hand.  I love making lentils, so this was a good variation.  This was my first time eating kale, and I liked it!  It keeps its crunch; doesn't get slippery like spinach. Very mild flavor.  My almost-3-year-old ate a whole bowl of this (I omitted the red pepper flakes because of her).

Very tasty!  A little less liquid (or a few more lentils) and this will be a 5 star recipe for me.

pretty dang good! My daughter did NOT like this but both me & my husband did.  I halved the lemon juice & red pepper flakes.  I let everyone added more if they wanted it. I also used 1/2 cup less of broth. I also added a few sliced shrooms. Served it with quinoa and a baguette.

Wow!  This is so good.  The only canned tomatoes I had were Rotel brand with green chiles, so I used that and left out the crushed red pepper.  I served this over quinoa.  Perfectly nutritious and delicious!  Will definitely make this again.

OH Man!!!  This is very tasty.  Will be included as one of my FAVES.  Easy on the pepper flakes and lemon...start with half listed and add more later according to individual tastes.

I was looking for a recipe to use some kale in our garden,  decided to try it, and loved it way more than I anticipated!  So much flavor! My husband and 7 year old loved it also. The 5 year old said it was "too spicy" so maybe I will leave out the pepper flakes next time and add it to individual servings. I will definitely make it again!

I like the results of this recipe very much.  It was flavorful and easy to make.  I also used two carrots and an extra clove of garlic.  I used homemade chicken stock which makes everything taste better. I cooked the lentils a shorter time prior to adding the kale and then cooked the kale longer than the recipes said.  I added the zest and lemon just after cooking.  This will be my go-to selection for lunch this coming week.

Very Good! I wanted to use up what I had on hand so I made a few substitutions. I had just over 8oz of lentils, so I added them all. I did not have canned tomato so I diced one large tomato and put a second large tomato in the food processor until it was a lumpy consistency. Because I substituted fresh tomato and added extra lentils, I had to add a cup of water as well. I did not have Kale and omitted this ingredient, I also omitted the red pepper flakes so that the kids could eat it. I used half of a squeezed lemon, which gave just the right amount of brightness to the flavor. I also used dried thyme. Flavors were delicious and I imagine even better the next day. Without the Kale, this is a great recipe to freeze and then reheat adding fresh kale later. Thank you!

I made this for dinner last night.  Totally divine!  I followed the directions but here are the minor changes that I made:  I didn't have fresh thyme so I substituted approx 1/2 t of dried thyme, rosemary and italian seasoning.  I also threw in some mushrooms since I had some laying around.  I also used red lentils instead of green because that's what I had.  
This tastes so good - the lemony citrus with the pepper flakes makes such a great combinations.  I suspicious husband tried it gingerly - and ended up going back for more twice!  I highly recommend!!

I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe. It's very flavorful, fresh and the red pepper gives it just the right kick/warmth. It's perfect for a cold, winter night when you want something hearty but also healthy. Had two bowls right off the bat!

Oh yum!

I didn't have green lentils so I used red which got a little mushy. I'll use green next time. Regardless -- the recipe tasted great.

Per another commenter, I added a bit of rosemary which I liked.

Thank you!

This is a great recipe! I make this pretty often and serve over rice. My husband is a vegetarian and this is a great, flavorful meal we both enjoy, but if you want to add meat, some chicken mixed in is delicious. I typically add celery and zucchini when I make this to bulk it up, and I always just substitute frozen spinach (which I keep on hand) instead of the kale. It usually takes a bit longer to make than the recipe states since I like to let it simmer at the end of cooking to reduce some of the liquid, so give yourself a bit of extra time when making this in case you get to the end and want it to be more saucey than stew-like.

I love this recipe!  Sometimes I add chopped chicken to make it more "robust" and dinner-like for my son, but I could eat this every week!  So healthy and tasty!  Another option is to add some grated parm at the end.  YUM!!

This was so much better than I thought it would be! The mixture of lemon juice and rep pepper gives it sick good flavor. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. Will definitely make this again. Thanks!

I absolutely love this. The lemon really sets this apart I think. I also used dried thyme and may try adding Rosemary as another reviewer said just to change it up some. I used a lot more red pepper to give it some bite. This is a great recipe, healthy, and very inexpensive to make.

I love lentils and this recipe didn't disappoint. I served these with a lemon garlic tilapia filet and it paired really well.  This is good warm or cold and tastes even better the next day.  Yum!

I made this as described, and it was okay.  It was a little too lemony for my taste.  Be aware, too, that using a whole pound of lentils makes a TON!!! You can easily half this recipe for a family of 4.

I made it as directed with no substitutions or additions and it turned out to be a great, healthy recipe.  It was soupier than I had expected (which is on me since it looked almost exactly like the picture), so I probably should have served it separately from the salmon with balsamic reduction glaze, but it was delicious.

I substituted the chicken broth with vegetable broth because I'm vegan and it turned out great. I absolutely LOVE this recipe and will definitely be making it again. It's delicious and so so healthy.

Great recipe to add to the rotation if your garden is producing way too much kale! I added 4 boneless skinless chicken thighs to this recipes for some added protein: just lightly brown the chicken before adding the onions, then let it cook with the remainder of the recipe for fall apart on your fork chicken.

great recipe for my garden kale.  I doubled the recipe and added sausage and extra carrots and celery.  I chopped up 1lb sausage link and browned it with butter/oil on the bottom a large pot.  then I added onion, celery, carrots, and garlic and cooked until translucent.  then I added everything else and extra spices.   Ben loves this recipe but the boys not so much.

This is utterly delicious. I actually forgot the thyme and seasoned it only with salt and pepper; and I had vegetable broth rather than chicken, so I used that. Still one of the best things I've made recently.

This dish is delicious! I used rosemary instead of thyme, upped pepper flakes to 1 tsp., so versatile, it's main dish worthy as well as soup or side. Definitely a keeper.

This is one of my favorite recipes of all time - delicious both hot and cold. It is my go-to recipe for ailing friends - when I want to bring a meal, it is gluten-free, can be vegetarian,  and keeps well.

I make dishes similar to this quite often depending on what I have in the fridge or garden--so I didn't measure exactly, but the combination was great! I really loved the addition of the lemon zest and juice. That added a noticeable difference and gave a hearty dish a light, fresh feel. I would definitely make this again.

This is so delicious and healthy!  I have made it several times and the only change was I used vegetable broth and used 1/8 tsp. of red pepper flakes.  I used the full amount of red pepper in the winter and fall and used less in the spring.  The leftovers disappear fast!

I have been making a soup similar to this for years. I only rated 4 because the lemon was too much. I think there is enough acidity in the canned tomatoes.¬†I would suggest that a squeeze of lemon be added according to individual taste.  The kale can easily be substituted for fresh chopped spinach. But definitely the cumin is essential. I added a tsp while cooking. Good recipe and full of nutrition.

I love lentils and kale so this was a great flavorful combination. I would add a little less lemon at first and see if you need to add more. I thought it was good but my husband said it was too lemony. I also added grilled chicken for extra protein.

Delish! I used green tomatillo salsa (about 1/3 cup) and omitted the lemon since the salsa is tart. Also added a little cornstarch thickener at the end to get consistency I wanted.

Delicious, used brown lentils because that's what I had.  Added a couple more carrots.  Other than that, followed recipe exactly.

Really enjoyed this last night. I added a drained & rinsed can of cannelloni beans, as well. I will be making it again.

Very flavorful! Used 1/2 tsp dried thyme instead of fresh sprigs, but left everything else exactly the same. It's a definite keeper!

This is my go-to recipe when I'm craving comfort food but want to eat healthy. It's a great one-pot dish and is filling and flavourful enough that I can convince my boyfriend to go meat-free for a meal (well, almost - if you don't count the chicken stock!). Instead of a crusty baguette, I scoop it up with pumpkin seed and oat ryvita crispbreads. It's even better the next day for leftovers!
