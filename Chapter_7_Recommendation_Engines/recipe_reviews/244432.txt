Really? You would rate a recipe one star just because you have never seen coffee flavored yogurt? Go to any  town with a population of more than 50 people and you will find it in any grocery store in several brands. Do you not realize that you are putting down the submitter of the recipe just because you live in BF and can't find all the ingredients? Amazing.

And now someone else has rated it one star, just to comment on ingredients.  Google coffee yogurt. It listed Dannon,  Chobani, Brown Cow, Oikos, Norman's, Liberte, Mountain Yogurt, Morrison's, Tillamonk, Yoplait, among others. Half of them are available in our local groceries, and I live in a small town.

Anyone else as annoyed (more like outraged) as I am by the review of the man who downgraded this recipe to a 3, saying he hadn’t tried it yet but wondered if it could be used as a “toping” for ice cream??Talk about sabotaging the ratings system, which is what we all use to determine whether we want to try a recipe. 

This was a perfect, simple recipe for my young grandkids to make by themselves to top the cupcakes we just made together. We all thought it was delicious; not gourmet, but how many of us cook gourmet every day? Thank you for sharing it with us.

I posted this recipe several years ago and since that time  our stores stopped offering coffee flavored yogurt, which was a favorite of mine. Other flavors of yogurt work about the same, or you could add instant coffee crystals to plain yogurt, but you'd probably want to also add some sugar or sweetener according to preference. The coffee yogurt had a lot of sugar in it.

A number of companies make coffee yogurt.  Dannon has been making it for at least 45 years.  Some brands call it mocha.  Dannon is the best.  You can make your own with vanilla yogurt and instant coffee powder or plain yogurt and instant coffee powder and sweetener.

We certainly don't have coffee flavored yougurt here in Brazil, although we are avid coffee consumers...but i bought a container of plain whole yogurt and flavored it with a teaspoon of instant coffee...worked really well......and i might add this recipe is lighter than the ones with chocolate/heavy cream....and tastes great !!!!!!!!!!

Sounds amazing, but I have never ever seen coffee yogurt?  I live in a suburb of LA and have never come across it anywhere . . .

First time I make a new recipe, I follow instructions exactly.  I will make this again but I’ll use 1/2 cup of the dark chocolate chips instead of 3/4 because mine was a little to thick.  I wanted more of a glaze than heavy frosting.  The taste was exceptionally delicious.  Much healthier than frosting with powder sugar

Easy and yummy! And yes there are only 2 ingredients...coffee yogurt and chocolate chips.  There is nothing misleading about it.

Thanks for an easy recipe! Wow, so many negative comments about "no coffee yogurt" available. Use plain and add powdered instant coffee, either decaf or regular. I always make coffee frozen yogurt, using plain with added decaf and it works great.  With the recent explosion of flavored yogurts available, I'll bet white chocolate chips and a fruit flavor would be good, also. Such a creative solution - thanks, ROSEP47!

This is my comment to Rose.
You were very rude in your comment about not being able to find coffee yougert in the. stores.  I currently live in. a small town of about 11,000. We have two grocery stores. I have not seen it either. I eat a lot of you very. I am from CA. in a very large city. never seen it there.  Please try to be more thoughtful and kind.
You never know about other people. Be glad you live in a large city and can find everything you need.

Sounded strange, but very easy. Coffee flavored yogurt can be found easily at Walmart. Depending if you want straight coffee flavored or latte it can be found easily by different brands. I used Oikos greek. My mistake was using choc chips with the coffee on a dark fudge cake. It was just to much. I'm thinking I might try a yellow cake with white choc chips & maybe a vanilla peacan yogurt. At Walmart they had so many different flavors of yogurt your options are endless. My regular grocery store doesn't have this type of selection. Even a honey vanilla yogurt might be good on a white cake. Would recommend trying caused this is a good basic idea to expand on & a lot better than butter cream or other types of icing for you.

This recipe is sort of misleading, because it's not actually 2 ingredients.  While it technically requires you to mix only 2 things together, that's because someone else (the yogurt manufacturer) put all the other ingredients (coffee flavor, sugar, milk) together ahead of time.  As someone else said, where can the average person actually find coffee-flavored yogurt?  That said, if I could find the coffee yogurt, I might be interested in trying it.  It does sound yummy, and at least you get the pro-biotics and less fat.

Should I store this cake in the refrigerator because it has dairy in it? Going to until I hear otherwise.
