I used red potatoes in place of white and then used a white onion in place of the red onion due to what I had on hand. I made a tzatziki recipe from this site and left the peel on because I am a rebel like that. This was a really nice change from traditional potato salad. The only one thing I think it was missing was some salt. Other than that, perfect as written.
