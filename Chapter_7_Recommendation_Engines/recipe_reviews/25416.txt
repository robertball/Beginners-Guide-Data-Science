Well, no one in our house can eat MSG, so that made this one questionable! But, it is much like a recipe for something I had in Colorado (diff name, but can't remember it at the moment!). You really don't need the MSG - just cook the cabbage in chicken or beef broth.  Use Mrs. Dash for extra zing, and it is a very good sandwich. You can also use refrigerated dough instead of bread dough - just as good!

This is a great recipie, very similar to my mom's recipie.  she did not add MSG, she would add lipton onion soup mix to the ground beef as well as cabbage and onions. A lot more flavorful to those of you who said it was too bland! Next time I make these I think I will try the cheese! Yummy!

we call these cabbage burgers...the trick here is to salt and pepper your hamburger mixture well...it will save time if you make the meat mixture the night before and put it in the fridge then you can make your bundles the next day

The recipe I got from a college roommate for this called them Fleischbrooks.  I've always loved them.  I didn't put in MSG, though.  I usually put in some cumin and I like that taste.  When they come out of the oven, I like to cut open the top and sprinkle in the cheese and top with some sour cream.  One thing, though--The bread dough should probably be brought up to room temperature.  I thawed mine in the refrigerator and it was impossible to roll out the dough until had warmed up.  I like the idea of spreading butter on the finished product.  Maybe some garlic powder or some other seasoning in the melted butter might be tasty too

  Super Duper; I had this recipe years ago and had lost.A German lady in Kansas gave it to me.  The only addition I make is a whisper of allspice.

We make this even easier by using the prepared cole slaw (shredded cabbage & carrots) bought in the produce section.  To cheat even more, we put it on store-bought potato hamburger buns.  If I use very lean meat, I add some water and simmer to add moistness.  A boullion cube or 2 will add flavor as well.

I've only used cabbage in cole slaw so when my produce shipment came this week I was looking for a different way to use the cabbage. This recipe is excellent. I used 93/7 hamburger and drained and rinsed. I added water and 2 beef bouillon cubes to the onion and cabbage while it was wilting, at the recommendation of other reviews. I did not add the MSG and instead added plenty of salt and pepper. The flavor was excellent. My only problem was that some of the bottoms of the Bierocks were too thin and broke through. I would make the dough thicker in the center next time and make sure there wasn't too much liquid in my filling mixture.

Thank you for sharing this recipe, my husband and boys loved it.  I did add a little water and bouillon as another person had suggested.  Since I only had extra lean hamburger, I also added a couple tablespoons of butter.  They turned out great, but next time I will set out 2 loaves of bread, I had pleanty of filling left.  Great recipe and nice change of pace.

These have been a family favorite for years!  My mom obtained the recipe from one of our neighbors.  I use a head of cabbage and one medium onion.  I brown the meat and onions(adding olive oil if the meat is too lean), then add the cabbage and season it all to taste with salt, black pepper, some garlic powder and a little sugar which brings out the flavor of the cabbage.    I've tried it with bread dough (both frozen and home made), but by far the easiest way is to use canned biscuits.   I buy a 4-pack of 7.5 oz cans of buttermilk biscuits.  (It has to be the regular, inexpensive biscuits because the dough on the Grands and flaky varieties won't seal properly).  Use two biscuits (put one on top of the other) and roll them out with a rolling pin.  I like to put a small piece of velveeta cheese on the dough (small! about the size of a quarter - too large and it will just melt out), then add about a tablespoon of filling.  Bring the edges up and pinch together.  Be careful not to overfill because it won't seal.  Place sealed side down on a greased baking sheet (that way the cheese melts into the filling).  If you line your baking sheet with foil it makes clean-up a snap, especially if you are using cheese.    These are great hot out of the oven topped with a bit of butter and some yellow mustard.   I freeze the leftovers in a single layer in gallon-size freezer bags.  They are also delicious warmed over.  I will be serving these to company tonight!

Good and easy, but the mixture needed some spice.  Maybe next time I'll try adding the fennel seed.

This was delicious.  We aren't big on beef at my house, so we used ground turkey instead of beef, and mixed shredded cheese into the meat mixture while it was still warm.  Everyone had seconds!

I've made these for several years.  Love them!  Great way to use up cabbage, serve something different.  There are lots of ways to change it up--you can use your favorite homemade bread/roll dough recipe.  I never use MSG, but different seasonings like sage, parsley, red pepper, etc.  I also like to make it with half ground turkey and half pork sausage, but ground beef is good too.  I always serve it with soy sauce (probably TOTALLY against what native Runza-eaters do, but I'm American, right?  At least soy sauce is classier than ketchup, ha ha).

I add grated cheddar and american cheese to this too - so that it tastes like cheese Runzas from back in Nebraska.  The Kraut Bierocks recipe by Kim Van Pelt has a good sweet bread recipe that I occasionally use too.  I use the frozen bread dough when I'm short on time.

This is the way I make my krautkuchen. Frozen bread dough is a very easy substitute for making your own dough. I left out the msg, and I put alot of pepper in the meat mixture for a little pep. I love these things!

I doubled the recipe, drained ALL the fat and did not add MSG.  I added one packet lipton onion soup and 1 can fiesta cheese soup.  Then I put it in the dough for Amish White bread on this site.  Fabulous and plenty of flavor!

I have always wondered what those meat pies were called. My husband is of Polish descent, and his grandmother called it Cabbage Bread. Our filling is made with both ground beef and ground pork, browned with onion. Then add Bay leaves and chopped cabbage and let simmer in covered pot until cabbage is tender. Then add cooked rice. That's what we add to the frozen roll dough we're thawed, kneaded and rolled out. No MSG needed. Plenty of moisture from the pork -- in fact a little too much so we have to drain some of the grease.

I had a teacher that made these, but she used sausage. I made the same substitution and they were just like the ones I had as a kid. Great appetizer. Made them for a party and they were gone before anything else.

This recipe is awesome! The first time I made it as written and loved it but wanted to jazz it up the second time, so I swapped out the beef for ground pork, and added a small can of mushrooms (drained) and some Italian seasoning, holy cow! Yum! Also, if you get Rhodes frozen Texas rolls, one roll is the perfect size for each runza. PS... I have worked in restaurants for years, MSG is literally in EVERYTHING! (Including Lipton onion soup mix and most frozen bread dough) to anyone who is sensitive to it, please check labels.. It can be avoided, but it's far more common than you think, and it's also a lot less harmful than you think, read up on it, you may agree to disagree, but you probably eat it everyday anyway without even realizing it,  so the  1/2 tsp in this recipe won't kill you, but you can certainly skip it, it's not necessary.

these were very tasty! Not sure why, but mine turned out pretty salty. I nixed MSG and instead, opted for a bit of beef bouillon, so that could be the answer to the saltiness question. So delicious, nonetheless, and definitely will be making this again (with no-sodium bouillon).

we call these PEROSKIS.  We make a variety of fillings, but the concept is the same.  unthawed frozen bread dough cut into about 8 slices and then each rolled out into a flat round and then fill with your filling, fold and seal - and we have actually pan fried them (much quicker) just cook slowly so they won't burn.  Drain on paper towels well.  Yum Yum.   We have made them with pizza type fillings, ground beef and cheddar cheese, ground beef with a homestyle gravy and mixed veggies depending on our mood at the time.  Very easy and so versatile.  Keeper.

After eating the regular Runza's in NE. for years (it's a franchise) It was great to find this reciept! Next time we will use a reciepe with the sweet bread, the frozen just doesn't have the same taste. The filling was great - we did 1/2 with MSG and 1/2 without. We could taste the difference the MSG makes. Overall a great quick reciepe!

This recipe has been in our family over many generations and we make it every winter usually. We usually do not drain the juice off so they aren't dry. Also, I have had these with steak & cheese or steak, sauteed onions and white american for like a philly steak. They are very delicious.

I am Czech and we do this a little differently.  Our family uses hambuger and german sausage (if you can't find that we use bratwurst and take off the casing).  I use seasoning salt, pepper, minced garlic and celery seed.  I also use Velveta cheese as it melts the creamiest.  My family absolutely LOVES these.  Love the idea of using slaw mix!!!  What a time saver!

Tastes very good.  I'm czech too.  Well my mother is.  We make a similar filling with hamburger, onion, butter, cabbage, rosemary, salt and pepper.  

If you want to replace MSG, try Parmesan cheese.  Parmesan has the highest amount of naturally occurring MSG than any other food and is often used because of that.  You can also try to find Torula yeast (yeast extract).  MSG is a flavor enhancer and so is torula.

This was a great recipe, particularly for a Sunday night, as I ended up with a LOT of left-overs.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find the frozen bread dough, so I went with refridgerated bread sticks from Pillsbury.  It still turned out great!  The only problem I had was that after baking, the bread dough came apart, so instead of closed balls, I had open packages.  The taste wasn't affected though, and it might have been due to the different dough I used.  I think the filling is also good by itself:  I have a lot of filling left over and I'm thinking I might just eat it as is, rather than putting together the actual runzas.

Excellent--added garlic, allspice, and cumin. Had a little leftover cream cheese that I added to make the mix a little creamier.

This recipe was GREAT! I didn't add MSG, I just seasoned the ground beef with cummin, garlic powder, and onion powder, I also cookied the cabbage first in beef broth... I'm sure whatever kind of broth you have on hand would do. I also added cheese and green peppers. I just bought pilsbary french bread dough (2 tubes). I made this for my husband and his, plus my 6 year old, we ALL loved it!! And my husbands friend was VERY impressed... and it was SOO easy!

Loved this! The cafeteria at the hospital I used to work at many years ago made these and I  used to eat them every time they were on the menu. This is almost exactly like the ones they served. I served them with beef gravy, and my husband asked for seconds- almost unheard of for a new recipe for him. Will see how the left overs heat up tomorrow... if there are any once my son gets home!

I had some gorgeous cabbage from my CSA and didn't know what to do with it, so I used this recipe.  I LOVE IT so much.  I didn't use the MSG.  I seasoned with salt and pepper and a little adobo to taste.  Man, was this insanely good.  I am not even that big  a fan of cabbage.  A++++++ Thank you

You do not need to add the MSG.  I make this and never add that.  They freeze wonderfully.   I brush mine with a egg wash and put a small slit on top. The egg wash gives it a shiny glaze. If you don't want to use frozen bread use the frozen dinner rolls instead.   If fact think I'll make some.

I've made these for over 30 years.  I make them with homemade yeast bread similar to what I saw in another recipe, but I am looking forward to trying them with frozen yeast bread. As far as seasoning, I salt and pepper them like crazy, and we taste the meat and cabbage as we go. I also use worcestershire to the meat and cabbage.  Warm out of the oven, or even cold the next day from the fridge, we LOVE them with ketchup. I'm not a big ketchup fan, but I love to slice them and squeeze in ketchup.  There's something just delectable about the meat, cabbage and yeast bread along with the ketchup.  Everyone who's tried them agrees they're "gold" with ketchup. Once, I added ketchup to the meat/cabbage mix before filling and baking but it's not the same. Thanks for sharing!  I will make it more often now that you made me think of frozen bread! ??

A family favorite! I've made these several times. I'll get the kids involved and have them help me. I use frozen yeast rolls instead of bread dough and make slightly smaller sandwiches,  and they always come out great. Little pockets of goodness! I'll also add a slice of American cheese in there sometimes too. The kids love to eat them the next morning for breakfast too.
