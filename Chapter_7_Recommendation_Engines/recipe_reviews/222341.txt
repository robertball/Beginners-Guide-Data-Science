It's CSA time and I was looking for something interesting to do with too much summer squash.  This was delicious!  I couldn't find the spicy lamb sausage, so I improvised:  I used ground lamb and spiced it with minced onion and garlic, cumin, paprika, and cayenne as well as salt and black pepper.  This seemed easier than removing the casing from an already prepared sausage anyway.  I considered skipping the cheese to cut down on the richness, but decided to use feta instead of the goat cheese.  It really added an interesting dimension, so I am glad I didn't leave it out. Because I didn't have the small round squash pictured, I used a larger elongated "mediterranean" squash, and it took longer to bake.  More like 40 minutes.  Both my husband and I gave it 5 stars.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

Also, I felt badly about tossing the scooped out squash so I sauteed some onion and garlic along with the chopped up squash, added a half a seeded fresh tomato and stir fried the mixture with some cooked brown rice.  It made the perfect side dish to accompany this meal.

Delicious and couldn't be easier. I used hot pork sausage, the kind that comes in the thick tubes, and garlic and herb bread crumbs. The red peppers add the most delightful kick!

If you're using yellow summer squash like in the picture, you'll need to make the following adjustments. I cooked three medium yellow squash, and I needed twice the amount of filling the original recipe calls for. Also, the squash needed to bake for about an hour. I put foil over it for second half of the baking time so the filling wouldn't burn. 

Like other reviewers, I used hot italian sausage. I also brushed olive oil over the squash and seasoned liberally with salt and pepper before adding the filling. Then I put a few pats of butter over the top of the bread crumbs.

It came out very tasty!

I also had a hard time finding the lamb sausage (San Antonio is dominated by one grocery chain and few finer food stores, sadly) so I used spicy Italian sausage with no other modifications.  Amazing results! The video on this was very helpful, and I didn't expect goat cheese to pair so well with squash flavors/textures. As soon as I can get my hands on some merguez, I will definitely re-review.

I could not find merguez and didn't have time to make my own so I used hot italian sausage instead and this turned out incredible. I used zucchini from the garden because, well zucchini plants are ridiculously prodigious. I used 3 ounces of goat cheese because 2 was not enough and used panko on the top.

I used zucchini and Italian sausage..... Fantastic! I also followed another reviewers recommendation and sautéed the scooped-out zucchini along with onion, garlic, green tomato, and brown rice....WOW! Everyone was eating it up as fast as they could! I can't wait to make this again!

The recipe came out great - I couldn't find the type of sausage referred to in the recipe, so I used just a sweet Italian.  I think it would be even better with the Merguez, but it was pretty good as is.  The video was EXTREMELY helpful as well when it came to preparing the squash - thanks!!!  Edited to add:  It was MUCH better reheated the second day - the flavors melded better.   Also, I doubled the filling.

Delicious! I made it with both yellow squash and zucchini. It was great with both. Goat cheese and sausage and red pepper was great combo.

I didn't like it and everyone else said it was Ok.  I don't think we care much for the spices in the sausage.

I loved the goat cheese in this recipe. I didn't have sausage so I used ground beef and seasoned to my preference. I know, I really should try it with Merguez sausage. A great use of summer squash especially if it grew a little too large for other uses.

You can't get much easier for such great gourmet taste. I prepared exactly as directed and it was absolutely delicious. Light for summer yet hearty with the bit of sausage. Will definitely make again.

My husband doesn't eat red meat so I used mild Italian chicken sausage and it was still amazing.  My whole family loved the blend of all of the flavors.  Thanks Chef John!

This was a great low carb treat. I used my giant overgrown zucchini from my garden, stuffed with ground beef and Italian sausage, mixed spaghetti sauce into meat mixture  and  then topped it with shredded cheese. Was a little bland so I topped it with a nice portion of Old Bay to add flavor and spices.

The most surprising feature of this recipe was the fact that I did not feel hungry a short while after eating it. We ate this as an entree and were satisfied.

YUM!  I tried this with yellow squash (used two squash, scaled the recipe for 7 servings).  Also used a blackberry jalapeno goat cheese and some kielbasa--diced finely--that I got from the farmers market.

Delicious. I totally revamped it but as a base it was a great recipe. I used Chimichuri Chicken sausage and a blend of tiny sweet red, orange and yellow peppers and a jalapeño for kick. Yellow onion, shallot and garlic. Instead of bread crumbs, Parmesan. Yummy!!

This looks like zucchini was used even though I’ve never seen zucchini shaped like that. I’m gonna use yellow squash. They are really small and use regular ground pan sausage. I know it will turn out amazing. I’m gonna salt and pepper liberally like some have done too.

This was so good and quick to make. I had to tweak the recipe a little  to use what I had available in my kitchen. I used 4 medium size Yellow squashes and for that I doubled the filling. I used Feta for goat cheese. Also, I couldn't help adding some chopped onions and garlic in, with the pepper. The grapefruit spoon did a great job scraping some of the seeds and flesh of the squash halves. I stuffed the squash halves in the morning, put them on a cookie sheet and covered and put in the fridge. I took them out an hour before dinner and let them come to room temperature for 30 minutes then baked and served.

This turned out FREAKING AMAZING. 
The only adjustments I made was I didn't have the lamb sausage so I found a pound of ground lamb and added onion and garlic powder a little bit of cumin, Cayenne, smoked chipotle powder, smoked paprika salt and pepper to the lamb before I cooked it up.
Ratio wise, I used 2 small acorn squash and I didn't really scrape out much of the insides... Any insides that did get scraped out got thrown in the pan with the sausage and bell pepper... I also used 4 oz of garlic and herb goat cheese.

These are sooo good! Couldn't find lamb sausage so used Italian  (I bet chorizo would be awesome too). And used regular small long zuchinni. Since its too hot to be using the oven I cooked them on our charcoal grill...and Wow! Gave them a great smoky taste with slight char on the bottom. Will make these over and over, thank you Chef John, love your recipes!

Delicious and easy. I couldn't find the merguez either so I used breakfast sausage and it was really yummy. I added some crushed red pepper for spice and used panko instead of regular bread crumbs. I used two small yellow squash and the timing was right on. Will make again!

I could have brought the Merguez sausage online but found the recipe online so started from fresh - lamb mince and spices. In the UK the supermarkets (I go to) only do butternut squashes so that's what I used.  I mircowaved the squashes for five mins to make them cutable and then put them in the oven for half hour so I could scope them out.  I lost the first one for being too vigorous in my scrapping but the other three were fine. I used 500g lamb mince and 70g goats cheese but I suspect I probably needed more cheese for that amount of lamb. Very tasty for a treat. Made fried rice and squash to go with it.
