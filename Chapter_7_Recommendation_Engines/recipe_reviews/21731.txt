I decided to use what was left of my Easter ham on a ham load, I looked in Allrecipes web site and found this one.  It was simple to make (with the help of a food grinder), everything mixed easily and the finished product was delicious.  This one is a keeper.

Great!  I found it needed a little something else though.  I added a half cup of Graham Cracker crumbs along with the bread crumbs.  It was delicious!

I have made this recipe and served it to several different people with A+ reviews. It isn't dry and has a wonderful taste.  I purchase my meat  already mixed from my local butcher.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I have tried other Ham Loaf recipes and found them much better then this loaf.  It was very dry and did not have much flavor.  I would not make this again.

This was pretty good! I found some ground pork in the freezer and went searching for a recipe. Well, I got lucky, I had most everything, Plus it was FACELESS! I did add onion & fresh rosemary to the ham as I pulsed it up in the FP. Added some garlic salt / pepper. I loved the glaze too! Never thought of That combo;) The sweet n salty of this loaf is just terrific! Thank you Penny;) Delish!!
