I used almond milk instead of cream. This was wonderful on rice rotini!  Because I really like hot peppers, next time, I might even try a habanero peppers instead of the jalapeno one!  I loved seeing that bit of green in the sauce!

this recipe is a big 5 star hit! My husband said that he prefers this alfredo over a traditional one for the savory flavors. I,  for once, followed the recipe exactly, and found it excellent in flavor and consistancy. I served it over mezzaluna pasta as a side dish to Italian sausages and peppers. Thank you MsDo, for a winning recipe! Double compliments as I'm of Italian heritage!

EXCELLENT! I loved how this was made with olive oil and no butter. Made exactly as written, but reduced the rosemary to 1/2 tsp. because I was using on 'Alfredo Lasagna Roll Ups' from here and I didn't want it to be too strong, which ended up being just right for us. Also, I had to use more cheese to get it to the consistancy that I wanted. This had excellent flavor! I will definately be using this recipe again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was very good.  Mine seemed a little too thin, but that may have been because I used half & half instead of heavy cream.  Next time I will thicken it with a little corn starch.  I served this over linguine and added roasted chicken and sautéed bell peppers.

This made a fantastic alfredo sauce.  I used 2 garden-fresh jalapenos and a little extra cream/parmesan.  The end result served over fettuccine with a grilled chicken breast and Jo's Rosemary Bread was truly restaurant quality.  I can't wait to impress some dinner guests with this recipe.

Delicious alfredo with a kick.  I made using fresh rosemary as opposed to dried as I have a lot growing in my garden.  The first night we used it as a dipping sauce with french bread.  Then we used the leftovers over pasta.  It is wonderful both ways - it is very rich to use as a dipping sauce.  I think when I make it again it will be for pasta.  Thanks MsDo for sharing your fantastic recipe.

Outstanding.  An instant classic in my household.  I doubled the recipe and only used one jalapeno because I have small children and it still had a nice amount of background heat.

I attempted to double this b/c I had a large jalapeno and I didn't want the sauce to be too spicy for my son, and we like leftovers just fine...however when I tasted it, it wasn't spicy at all and needed a little kick.  I think it was the jalapeno I got, it didn't seem hot when I was chopping it, which has been a problem I have noticed in the past...anyway I added some cayenne a little garlic salt, and black pepper, and we all loved it.  Will make again for sure!

I'm sorry but I made this exactly as written and it was unedible. I had high hopes with all the great reviews but I will not make again.

This is perfect. I threw this on some angel hair pasta with some grilled chicken and zucchini, and my kids ate it all up and loved it. Thank you! I've also used it on lasagna rolls that my husband loved.

OMG this sauce is so tasty and easy to make! I always have trouble with my alfredo sauces being bland and just not tasting right, but this one is so full of flavor! The ingredients go together so well. I only had a jar of sliced jalapenos on hand, but they worked out fine. Will definitely make this again!

Perfect!  The rosemary works great in this.  I served it over some meatloaf that was topped with tortellini's!  I know sounds weird but it was SO GOOD!  Thanks!

This was a very easy recipe and delicious. I did not know exactly what to expect but those flavors went very nicely together. The only thing I did different was use 2 tsp of black pepper. I will definitely be using this the next time we have company!

Like one review suggested, I used almond milk instead of heavy cream(trying to watch the calories) to thicken it a little I added some cornstarch.  I would definitely use 2 jalapenos next time. 
It had great flavor! We also grilled some chicken breasts to have with it over pasta. With a few more attempts this will definitely be added to my regulars.

Great way to spruce up Alfredo! I doubled the rosemary, should have doubled the jalapenos too.

Oh my gosh, I was looking for something to do with some homegrown jalapeños and found this recipe.  We grow rosemary too and love Alfredo. Use real fresh grated or shredded Parmesan, that will make a world of difference! Delicious, and a keeper!

My husband and I just finished eating this.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It actually wasn't spicy at all.  We are guessing the cream and parmesan must have balanced out the spiciness of the jalapeno.  The only changes I will make next time is adding another jalapeno and an extra half clove of garlic.  One jalapeno simply wasn't enough to give this sauce the boost of flavor it needed.  I served it on linguini and topped it blackened chicken - you can see my photo at the top of the page.  You may need to flip through the photos in case it has been replaced by another person's photo.

I made this last night for dinner. I doubled the Jalapenos, threw in some shrimp and cooked up some noodles, poured the sauce over buttered noodles. We enjoyed this very much .Thank you for posting!

This recipe needs more jalapeno. I added tomatoes, red pepper and broccoli to the recipe, and used linguine pasta. The flavour is really good, and even better as left overs.

This was amazing. The sauce came out a little thick for my liking, but it was still awesome. I will just add a little milk next time (: I added hot pepper flakes because we like spicy. I will be adding a serrano pepper and a jalepeno next time too.

Family loved this sauce and it was super easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly except used fresh rosemary since I had it available. I served this over crispy oven "fried" chicken and a bed of angel hair pasta. Husband took one bite and said "this one is a keeper!"  Even my teenager who was skeptical the sauce would be too hot cleaned her plate and was looking for seconds (there were none). Next time I'll make more of the sauce and probably try it with low fat milk instead - the Parmesan thickens it up and makes it plenty creamy. This one is a winner!

This recipe is fantastic. Plan on just about tripling it for a pound of pasta. I like to use fresh rosemary, as it gives the dish more flavor. I also add extra garlic, because you can never have enough garlic. I also add chicken for a more hearty meal.

I've made this several times and found it's really good with blackened chicken. I use penne noodles instead and shred the chicken into the pasta. The flavors mix really well!
