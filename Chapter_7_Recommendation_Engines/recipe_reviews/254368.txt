Found this to taste rather authentic. Love all the textures and layers of flavors in this one. I have made this recipe multiple times. Great as it is but now I use the following modifications. 

I cut cayenne and chili powder in half. I've also found it be good cutting broth in half, eliminating water and using 28 ounces of diced tomatoes. Adding some celery and chickpeas gives it some extra substance.

Extremely good texture and flavor.  Like others I substituted chicken stock for water yo add flavor.  This recipe is spicy HOT, to hot for my wife who doesn't mind medium hot, it calms down a bit overnight but I'll definitely cut way back on the Cyan pepper next batch.

My husband and I loved how spicy it was.  It was also easy to make-all in one pot!  I forgot the tomato paste, and didn't have 1 cup of mushrooms.   I added more carrots and some red peppers.  When I make it again, I might add even more veggies.  Great combo of spices.  thanks for sharing this recipe

Indian spices taste authentic in this recipe. I used red quinoa and ended up using up my chile and cayenne pepper, so I included about 1/4 tsp. less of these seasonings, which probably made it less spicy for us. If you want to tone down the spiciness, you can add plain yogurt as a side and mix it in slowly. I also included basmati rice as a side. Additionally, I sprinkled fresh cilantro on top to try to use up what I had left. I wish I had understood how to cut the carrots before making the recipe. Next time I am going to dice the carrots into small squares rather than discs.

Fantastic recipe, and instant favorite. Fantastic recipe, and instant favorite.  I substituted Cayenne pepper for ground chili, and the extra shot of cayenne really turned up the heat.

I thought this was great. I used brown lentils because that is what I had, and didn't add all the spice because my husband does not eat spicy food, but we both really enjoyed the flavors.
