Ohhh, I SO enjoyed this bread! Regular ol' sliced bread works out better for our needs, so I made this into a loaf rather than rolls.  Because I like less sweetness and more density in my breads I reduced the sugar to one tablespoon.  I also used butter instead of oil, but that's no biggie either - I'm sure I would have been equally as happy with the canola oil (if, in fact, I ever used canola oil in the first place). I threw in a fair amount of fresh dill just for a flavor variation but this bread is just fine on its own. It's rich and flavorful, which I fully expected because of the egg yolk, buttermilk and  brown sugar.  It has a beautiful pale golden blush of color. Rolls or bread, this is a real winner - one of the better recipes I've tried.

Yum SO good! I ended up adding a bit more buttermilk than called for (about 1-1/4 cup) because it appeared to be a little dry after my bread machine got it all mixed up.  Also, next time I will just go ahead and add the oil with the rest of the wet ingredients into my machine before beginning the dough cycle.  I don't see any point to adding it later.  Instead of using a whole stick of butter I just melted about 2 Tbsp. and brushed it on with a pastry brush during and also after baking.  Instead of rolls I chose to make the dough into a loaf by rolling it into a rectangle and rolling it up from the long side, tucking ends under.  The result was beautiful!  Sliced beautifully, smelled wonderful and tasted even better.  I will definitely use for rolls next time I need them.  Thanks so much!

I was drawn to this recipe because of the buttermilk (needed to use some up) and the smaller amount of flour. I gave it five stars, because it fit just what I was looking for. Tried this for Sunday dinner.I was worried about the buttermilk not being warm when I started but it seemed to make no differance. I made only one change.I used brown sugar splenda blend; but will warm the milk, egg and oil next time and add togeather to see if it does.As Valerie did. I made smaller rolls about 24 as I was hoping to have some leftover for Monday's dinner will have to make more. Son and husband took them for a snack on the way to work and class.  Now I have a use for buttermilk beyond ranch dressing and fried chicken.           Thank you Musterdseed for a wonderfuly easy & tasty recipe.

Fabulous, silken dough, a dream to work with. The rolls are good. However, there's an elusive something missing from the flavor. After a bit of analysis, I believe that they're lacking that ever-so-slight sweetness the palate expects to taste in a dinner roll. Presumably, this is because the acidic contribution of the buttermilk serves to counteract and cancel out the sweetness of the sugar addition. It's quite possible that this could be improved by doubling the sugar - don't know. It falls short of the 5 star rating because Colleen's Potato Crescent Rolls on this site produces the quintessential dinner roll, the touchstone against which all others are judged for me. If you make the two recipes side-by-side, you will understand there is absolutely no comparison. That said, this is a respectable alternative. Note: I also baked as a loaf, and the consensus is that it's more successful when baked in this manner. The lack of sweetness, which makes the flavor border on blandness in a roll, translates better into bread. The ideal backdrop for whatever meat and fixings you choose to place between the slices, its lovely, moist texture contributes to a memorable sammie. Sturdy enough to stand up to slicing, without crumbling. In fact, when I ate my sandwich, this bread was so moist that not a single crumb fell on the plate! Great for morning toast, as well. Baked in a 9"X5" loaf, I get 14 full slices and 2 heels. I always keep slices in the freezer. As bread 5 star, as rolls 4.

WOW! WOW!  I have been searching for the best recipe.....and this is it my friends!    The only tweaking involved was getting rid of the brown sugar and using white sugar.  I had to add a bit more flour, but I think that was personal preference.  I also made them into "cloverleafs"(3 small dough balls) in each cup of the muffin tin.I let them rise most of the afternoon and kept brushing melted butter on top (butter kept absorbing into the dough).  When they came out of the oven they were crispy on top and absolutely delicious!   A total family pleaser...my 4 year old Daughter even ate them and she does not like bread at all.  THANKS!!  :D

Really delicious with a rich taste that makes you think they are full of fat but they're not!  I even used fat free buttermilk and did not brush with butter.  Instead I beat the unused egg white slightly and brushed it on the rolls before putting in the oven for a beautiful golden brown finish and nice crust.  I did the cloverleaf style and they looked great.

I thought these were awesome! My husband would have rated a 4 because he likes his rolls crunchy on the top and I could have made them that way but following the directions exactly-I loved how dense and soft these were. I used all-purpose since I couldn't find bread flour and I made my buttermilk since I didn't have any on hand and they still came out perfect. So excited to have found an easy and quick roll recipe!

I replaced 1 cup of flour with whole wheat, used only one tablespoon of (white) sugar, and used a whole egg. This made eight of the best hamburger buns I've ever eaten. Highly recommended!

I made this recipe for my family, and they loved it! I don't have a bread machine, so I made the rolls by hand and they turned out great. We even had some for breakfast the next morning with jam!

I've made these twice now, both with excellent results.  The second time around I didn't have any buttermilk but made a sustitute by mixing 1 cup of milk with 1 tablespoon of vinegar and letting the mixture sit for 5 minutes before adding to the bread machine.  Both times I got great reviews from my family (in contrast to another roll recipe I tried which to this day haunts my reputation in the kitchen).  Highly recommended!

I needed to use up some buttermilk when I found this recipe. They were very easy, from start to finish and came out beautifully. My husband absolutely LOVED them! Thanks so much for sharing.

something went wrong for me. I made buttermilk using 1% milk and vinegar, as I've done before and as several other reviewers did, letting it sit 10 minute before adding anything else. Otherwise, I followed the directions - took the dough out of the machine just after it did the "punch down." It was a little stickier than I was expecting but nothing ridiculous. made the balls, put them in the greased muffin tin, covered with a towel and put in the sunlight for half an hour. They rose a little more, but not doubled. Went ahead and baked them ten minutes later - they were thick and a bit hard on the outside.

I used this recipe to use up an abundance of homegrown/made kefir milk. The rise was phenomenal - I almost didn't want to make the dough into rolls!  I did need to increase the milk to close to 1 and 1/4 cups as another reviewer also did.  My dough just looked too dry.  I used the muffin tin for single rolls (will try clover ones next time).  And I rubbed a cold stick of butter on top when they were done baking.  Yummy!  I will make again.

EXCELLENT! These rolls are easy, easy, easy, and so good! I used milk with 2 T white vinegar and let sit 10 -15 minutes in place of buttermilk since I didn't have any. I believe these would probably be even better had I used the buttermilk, but still produced a wonderful full flavor roll with this substitution. The dough was sticky and a bit tricky to shape into nice smooth topped rolls because of this, but I used a little bit of flour to help. Brushed tops with butter right after they came from oven. It produced a beautiful golden brown glossy topped dinner roll. Went perfectly with the two different potato soups we had for dinner. The recipe did not say to warm milk before adding to machine, but I did as I felt it needed to be in order to activate the yeast.

Wonderful flavor and full bodied texture. I brushed tops with leftover egg white and baked 18 minutes. These are my Thanksgiving dinner rolls for this afternoon -- THANKS! ******************************* Just baked a batch of these rolls that I'd put in the freezer. This time I brushed tops with butter when they came out of the oven. Much better than when I used egg white, as the crust is softer. (19 Jan)

These were awesome!  Next time I think I'll double the recipe, as they disappeared so fast.  First time I made these, I made them exactly as stated in the recipe.  Second time I experimented and used the whole egg instead if just the yolk.  I also put the oil in when I put the rest of the ingredients in - I didn't pause it to add it later.  Still turned out great, no noticeable difference.

I wanted rolls to go with dinner and had buttermilk to use up so this was the perfect recipe.  The rolls turned out great.  They have a great tangy taste from the buttermilk which I enjoy because they're not overly sweet.  I didn't change a thing with this recipe.

Great recipe, my kids liked it.  First time I used buttermilk so I followed the recipe exactly.  I'm trying it again as a loaf of bread today in the bread machine using turbinado instead of brown sugar.

These are the best!!!  They are soft, moist, and would go with just about any meal.  In fact, these were more popular than the meal itself.  My kids inhaled these, wanting more than just one each.  They also make great sandwich buns the day after.  I didn't put the melted butter on all of them, fearing this would make them mushy the next day.  And, the best part, the bread machine does all the work for you.  This is an easy and excellent recipe for rolls.

So soft and delicious with an irresistible aroma. We ate ours warm with gobs of butter. Not being a bread maker I was surprised how well I did for a first-timer. The recipe instructions are easy to follow. Only had powdered buttermilk on hand. Substituted 1 cup of water for the liquid buttermilk and added 4 Tbs of the powdered along with the dry ingredients layered in the manner the manufacturer of my bread machine recommends. Really Great!

Tasted good.  Made with milk and vinegar since I didn't have buttermilk.  I'll try with buttermilk just to see if it changes the flavor, but these were good.

Sorry, did not care for these rolls.  The dough was fabulous to work with, but the rolls were tasteless.  Don't know if it's because I'm not used to cooking with kosher salt or what, but my family and I didn't care for the taste (or lack thereof).

EXCELLENT ROLLS! Had some buttermilk to use up, so that made this recipe even more appealing to me. Made it just as written, except I accidentally added the oil in with all the other ingredients, but I don't really think that affected anything. The dough was a dream to shape...so silky and smooth and not sticky at all! This recipe made 12 beautiful, delicious rolls. They will go perfectly with our soup and salads tonight. I will definately be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

These were ok for us.  They were very dense and I didn't get a good rise from them.  My buttermilk was not heated or at room temp which I thought might have affected that.  These still don't beat the taste of my personal favorite from this site.  Thanks for sharing.

Unfortunately mine did not turn out very well. I must admit I used whole wheat flour and mixed with hands instead of bread machine. So my review is not fair!

These are incredibly delicious.  We don't have a bread machine so I made these with my kitchenaid mixer.  I mixed all the dry ingredients in the bowl with the egg yolk, while the yeast proofed in the warm milk with a tablespoon of sugar.  (I doubled the amount of sugar in the recipe to make them a little sweeter).  Then I added the milk/yeast mixture to the bowl and mixed it all together, adding the oil right at the end.  I kneaded the dough by hand, then let it rise in the oven with the light on for a couple of hours.  Baked for 20 minutes and they were perfect.  Thanks for sharing!

I made these today, I thought that they came out wonderfully but even after me doubling the brown sugar they still didn't have a sweetness to them which I was looking for since they have brown sugar in them, actually i didn't taste any. Next time, I will adjust the sugar to my liking but over all these were great and I will make them over and over.

These were very easy to make. I followed recipe as listed. I gave these 4 stars though because mine tasted a little saltier than expected, not sure if it was the salt or the buttermilk that did it, but to me it tasted more like a biscuit instead of a roll.

I made a loaf in the bread machine.  Cuisinart 100. Basic White setting, 2# loaf with med crust. 
Ingredients in order from wet to dry.
Only tweak was 1/4 C more buttermilk.  It was slightly too dry not catching scraps with the extra milk it was perfect. 
And using butter instead of Canadian oil.

It was beautiful and tasted so good.  The texture was like pillowy rolls in a sliced shape.  The crust was not thick or hard.  It reminded me of the very soft roux type bread without all the fuss.  

Thank you so much for this recipe a definite keeper.

This recipe made me realize you CAN have soft, fluffy, chewy  homemade bread. I tried probably over 30 bread recipes and they all turned out dense and crumbly. My husband and eight-year old son have suffered through all my unfortunate bread-making.  I almost gave up! This bread saved homemade bread-making for me. It's very close to store bought sandwich bread. They ask for sandwiches again! It stays fresh for almost two weeks if you always wash your hands before handling. I did have to add about a half cup of water to get the dough to come together, but other than that...perfection!!

I made this as the recipe says and these rolls are  delicious. Remember in a bread machine; put the liquids in first, add salt to the liquids. Then add flour, sugar and the yeast on top. I added the oil about ten minutes into the dough cycle.

This is a staple in our house when I have soups or stews! I follow the recipe exactly except for a possible tablespoon of water added to the bread machine shortly after I start it. I've found this isn't always needed so you need to watch your dough in the beginning. Also, I used the substitute for buttermilk, add 1 Tbsp. vinegar to a glass measuring cup then add the rest of the milk needed (I use 2% and it works great). Let sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes. Also, I add vegetable oil in the beginning and have never had a problem. Awesome recipe!

Husband approved.  My hubby is a HUGE bread eater and he loved these rolls.  I made them to serve with 'Smothered Pierogies' from AR.  DH managed to eat 4 1/2 rolls before and with dinner.  Starting them in the bread machine was a great time-saver for me.  Because the house was cool (-20° wind chills, outside) it took about an hour for mine to double in size.  Great recipe and one that I will be using again.  Thanks DwightNT for sharing your recipe.

The rolls were great!  I tried them out before Thanksgiving to see what they would taste like.  I think I waited too long to add the oil, so I needed to add more buttermilk.  Once I added more buttermilk, they looked very wet, so I had to add more flour.  They definitely rose to double in size.  I can't wait to make more Thursday!!

This is now my go-to recipe for all things yeast-bread. I did heat my milk (I use milk + a splash of vinegar if I don't have buttermilk) slowly in the microwave before adding to the bread maker, and also followed the manufacturer's directions to put the yeast in first, then dry stuff, then wet. I also let the rolls touch when I put them in the pan so they're like those school lunchroom-style pull-apart rolls. And, to help them rise, I put them on a heating pad. They get huge!

I had to watch a YouTube video to learn how to form the rolls -- there really is an art to it! -- but it was sooo worth it!  I served them last Thanksgiving along with little tubs of garlic butter and cinnamon butter and they were inhaled!  I definitely plan to make them again this year!

P.S. This is also a great recipe for cinnamon roll dough. Flatten it out, pile on your filling, roll, slice, let rise, bake and glaze. Yowza!

Even though I used regular flour, 1 1/4 cups of 2% milk. Both batches of rolls came out beautifully and taste divine. After trying many other recipes (which were epic fails because they were too hard, too dry etc..) this is the one I will use hands down. Thanks for sharing the recipe !

My 12 year old daughter loves these! She's always telling me to make more! She could eat about 20 of these things if she could :)

Awesome!!!! I LOVE these rolls!! They were so easy to make and the dough turned out perfect!!! I had  buttermilk that I needed to use up before it spoiled so I just searched for buttermilk recipes and I am so glad I found this one!! The buttermilk makes them extra soft and flavorful!!! As suggested by another reviewer, I made mine into a cloverleaf shape (three small balls in each muffin cup). I definitely will be making these again and again!

I found the recipe dry, when mixed in bread machine. I had to add more and more buttermilk. End result, the rolls were tough.

Not bad, rather easy--measurements are perfect for a nice, light bread.  I made rolls, as directed, but deviated and made 8 large sandwich rolls.  I'm too impatient to make smaller rolls most of the time.  I didn't brush with butter--or anything, and they came out soft and golden brown.  Hubs enjoyed these, which means it must be a nice light bread.  He's not a fan of heavier, chewy breads.  I thought it baked up well.  Thanks for the recipe!

One thing that I'd change for sure is to use warm buttermilk... I'm sitting here waiting for my dough to rise, but it's very cold...not rising at all. Hope they end up turning out for our T-giving meal in 4 hours.

I used all whole wheat flour.  And, these turned out delicious!  We used them for buffalo chicken sandwiches and they were YUMMY!!!!
